I hung in there thinking some actual laughs would come during the heist portion of the film which took forever to come. Eddie Murphy doing his same old schtick and Ben Stiller as flat as possible left me expressionless. Also, were the film makers freakin kidding me with Matthew Broderick. The guy looked half dead and uttered words that looked like some untalented schleps first audition.Toss in a depressing ultra straight portrayal by Alan Alda to secure the fate of this bomb. The film was trying to be outrageous to the point of distraction on one end while not knowing where else it wanted to go with the serious elements . I cringed at the dialogue.A heist comedy with this kind of talent should have sailed. The only standout was Gabourey Sidibe. Her scene with Murphy where she asks if he's married was funny.

And while it would have been easy to dismiss Tower Heist as a probable bomb due to its outlandish premise, seemingly mismatched cast, and critically unimpressive director, well, it turned out to be another of 2011's pleasant surprises, thanks in large part to Murphy himself. The story centers on a group of luxury apartment employees who lose their pensions in a Ponzi scheme to a businessman and decide to take back what's theirs by ripping him off in an elaborate, well, tower heist. Aided by a star-studded cast that included Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Casey Affleck, and Gabourey Sidibe, Tower Heist represented a return to form for Eddie Murphy.

It's about a group of people who team up and break into the upper room of a hotel to take back the money that was stolen by a Wall Street businessman played by Alan Alda.  They come up with a rather unspectacular and unappealing plan to search for a safe hidden in the wall that supposedly contains millions of dollars.Really, if it wasn't for Eddie Murphy starring in the film, I'd have turned it off before the halfway point.  The first 40 minutes are really THAT boring.  In fact Eddie Murphy's character never really saves it either despite playing the role of a crook who's good at stealing things.  His character and communication with Ben Stiller are actually highlights and they aren't even anything particularly memorable.  That just goes to show how unpleasant the movie is.The only worthwhile scene is the one where Eddie's character gets released from prison and while in a shopping mall he makes those who are planning to go through with the robbery prove they have what it takes to succeed by stealing 50 dollars worth of items throughout the mall.  This was actually funny and a rare example of good writing, especially when Eddie walks away with all their wallets.I guess the ending is satisfying enough, not to recommend, but to feel like I didn't totally waste my time.  I won't spoil it, but everyone who had their money stolen receives surprise package deliveries and well, let's just say they're quite surprised alright.  I wish I'd gotten my money back for watching Tower Heist.

Drawing on our sympathy for the working stiff that gets screwed over - which, sadly, happens a lot these days - made our band of mismatched average Joes that much more endearing to watch and we can't help but root for them as they go about planning and preparing the whole heist. Alan Alda also doesn't let the film down by making Arthur Shaw a despicable character, I mean peel back the layers and Shaw's just rotten, the kind of villain we love to hate.While Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena and Gabourey Sidibe were pretty funny, I couldn't help but find Eddie Murphy's Slide a little annoying, I mean I know it's just Eddie doing his thing, but I just didn't see the humour in his antics. Still, the comedy wasn't over-the-top and it hit the right notes and gave us a few laughs. As much as I enjoyed it, though, I can't recommend this for a purchase. It's worth a watch, but it's also pretty forgettable by the end.The DVD includes two alternate endings, one of which I thought could've worked, the other; no way.

Honestly, you can't. ""Tower Heist"" is what a movie with an ensemble cast is supposed to be. It is constantly interesting, always moving with twists and turns, a great script and laughs throughout that don't insult your intelligence.""Tower Heist"" is about a group of employees that maintain, run and devote their lives to a collection of upper-crust socialites in a downtown Manhattan high-rise residence. At the top of this high-rise is Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who lives a life of spoil and wealth. Shaw can quite simply be compared to the likes of Bernie Madoff, which is another reason why this movie may hit home with some, and is most definitely a lot of the inspiration for the movie's plot. So when Shaw is exposed for milking people of their life savings and retirement funds, the employees of the Tower's lives come crashing down.""Tower Heist"" has more entertainment value, fun and creativity than any of the newer ""Oceans"" movies and much of that comes from the band of unlikely misfits that choose to embark on a life of crime; the newly fired tower manager feels responsible, the wimpy divorcee who is being kicked from the tower with his new home, a box, in hand, the former BK (Burger King) employee and the expected father who has no money to support his coming family.""Heist"" benefits from its ability to stay home and realistic. Even when things get crazy, the movie stays feasible and that is the most enjoyable thing about it. The creators could have gotten silly, like some of Stiller's movies, but they didn't. They kept things real and that made you feel like you could be in their shoes at anytime. Someday when your bottom falls out, you may have to resort to the same things.Also, remember when Eddie Murphy was funny? Like, really funny? I'm going to go all the way back to the late 80s with ""Harlem Nights"" and ""Coming to America"". Well, ""Tower Heist"" has `that' Eddie Murphy; the attitude Eddie Murphy and the change on a dime Eddie Murphy, the ""banana in my tailpipe"" Eddie Murphy.""Tower Heist"" is a movie that will challenge your mind, make you laugh and give you a little bit taste of how it feels to stand up for yourself, even if we don't always get to do that in our own lives.

1392335,ACJVGDN8G386P,B004A8ZWWO,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 0]","I've begun to notice particular cinematic devices in these kinds of escapist heist and robbery stories. A group of characters resolve to pull off some kind of &#34;job&#34;, usually against someone who buys $25 hamburgers, $95 t-shirts and $5000 suits. This group may be professional or amateur depending upon the context. In &#34;Ocean's 11&#34; they were pro's. In &#34;Tower Heist&#34; they're amateurs. At the same time, both kinds of heist movies, whether being enacted by pro's or amateurs, have many identifiable traits in common.First, the rich guy being pinched is so flush with dough losing a million dollars would be the equivalent of dropping a penny down a storm drain for the other 99.99% of the working population. In other words, we have about as much sympathy for the victim as we do for a bacterial infection. Second, the motivation for the heist/robbery is usually engaged as an act of revenge, not just for pure monetary gain. So we sympathize with the robbers. Thirdly, we don't know how the heist will be enacted exactly until it occurs, which is a good way of keeping the audience in some suspense.One common device I notice with more frequency occurs during the planning stages of the heist. The characters are trying to figure out how to solve some problem which seems insolvable. For example, one of the characters might point out something like &#34;How are we going to get $50 million past the security guards even if we get the money?&#34; Then there's a brief silence as the characters contemplate the problem. Then one character blurts out of nowhere, &#34;Who says the money has to leave the building?&#34; Then we see the quizzical expressions of the other characters before an immediate cut to another scene. We don't find out what the character actually means until well into the heist itself. While it's not a bad story device, I have become more aware of it among these kinds of films. &#34;Tower Heist&#34; has this sort of device in spades.Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller) is the building manager of a New York high-rise reminiscent of Trump Tower. The building is residence to a combination of home-owners, renters, and businesses. He not only knows the building itself from top to bottom, he is expected to jump through hoops to fulfill all the eccentric needs of many of the residence, particularly the high-paying ones. He knows when certain little old lady's dogs need a walk, or when someone likes have their favorite drink brought up. So Kovaks has to not only keep the building functioning he has to care for the residence like an on-call valet. The highest renter living in the top-floor penthouse is Arthur Shaw, a hedge-fund/securities magnate. Kovaks knows the kinds of food he likes, when he needs his car brought to him, even his favorite wine for a dinner party. Kovaks even has to play him in an online chess game. Part of Kovak's job is to keep the residence happy by knowing all of their funny little needs but gets very little recognition for it.Then we learn that Kovaks invested the pension funds of all of the tower's worker's hard-earned money into Shaw's investment firm. But now, Shaw has lost the money and has been arrested by the FBI for securities fraud. Only, despite being arrested and under investigation, Shaw appears to have lost all the money which means the workers have lost all their money. The doorman of the tower attempts and fails to commit suicide.In retaliation, Kovaks confronts Shaw in his penthouse and damages some of his property. As a consequence, Kovaks is fired from his position and charges against him are filed by Shaw. Now out of work, Kovaks finds out from one of the female FBI agents there may be some money which Shaw may have hidden but the authorities have overlooked and/or can't find. Kovaks is convinced the money exists and sets out to pool a group of the workers to enact a possible heist of the hypothetical money. A street-smart robber and drug-pusher, Slide (Eddie Murphy), joins this unlikely team of amateur robbers. Kovaks had walked passed Slide nearly every day on his way to work at the Towers.A fun, sometimes predictable but occasionally unpredictable heist movie designed as pure entertainment. Aside from the somewhat current events issue concerning bad securities and hedge funds, this film does not have any real new ideas. No greater message concerning the meaning of corporate America. Rather, the film is about enacted justice, not unlike the battle between the social classes stories of the 18th century where the mean old lord gets his just deserts. I just hope the public will not allow real Wall Street schemers to get it away with it. Sometimes I wonder if the public watches these sort of escapist fictions as a way to &#34;get back&#34; at the real corruption of Wall Street. As far I know, no CEO of JP Morgan-Chase or Saks Fifth Avenue were ever directly victimized by investors who were &#34;taken&#34;. But at least the present film provides some sort of an outlet.",3,"Entertaining Heist Movie Relies on Typical Hollywood Tricks and Enacts ""Cinematic"" Justice",1385942400,"12 2,

1392340,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004A8ZWWO,C. Sawin,"[6, 12]","Brett Ratner isn't exactly a director people love these days. After the below par Rush Hour 3 fell well below expectations and X-Men: The Last Stand genuinely pissed off comic book and movie fans alike, it's difficult to really get excited about anything he's a part of now. So along comes Tower Heist where Ratner teams with Eddie Murphy, another example of someone in Hollywood people have grown sour on, to assemble a movie that seems to have thrown together a wide assortment of middle class actors that hope to capture the same magic the Ocean's Eleven movies did. Sometimes you can predict a movie at face value and what you see in promos is what you get with Tower Heist.Tower Heist did seem to finally get going in the middle of the movie; it showed signs of heart, jokes actually felt a bit more on point, and the story was progressing nicely. Unfortunately, it's sandwiched between an extremely lame opening half hour or so featuring what feels like nothing but rectum and feces jokes and a really stupid final half hour that is just too over the top to believe or actually pull off. Pe&ntilde;a and Murphy seem to be in a competition with one another on who can say the most ignorant things that come to mind while Broderick falls victim to the same character flaw despite showing signs of intelligence in more difficult areas. Casey Affleck doesn't do a whole lot other than worry about his pregnant wife while Ben Stiller puts in one of the tamest performances of his career. Nearly all of the characters felt flat and underdeveloped. Despite having their own quirks and brief background stories, they all seemed to go in the same direction which was blurting ridiculous one-liners to try and make the audience laugh rather than try and move the story along.There is some good buried in the middle of the movie though. The entire Lester (Stephen Henderson) subplot is the closest Tower Heist gets to developing any sort of heart even though it feels like it drops the ball as soon as it tries to pick it up. The conversations the team has before the actual heist take place are easily the funniest segments of the film; the lesbian conversation and Lego layout scene with the ""Webster"" line specifically. Gabourey Sidibe is used pretty sparingly in the movie, but seems to do the most with what screen time she does get. She's genuinely pretty funny nearly every time she shows up. T&eacute;a Leoni probably gives the strongest performance though. Special Agent Claire Denham is an FBI agent that does everything by the book and puts her job before anything else, but it's obvious she develops a soft spot for Josh Kovacs (Stiller). The scene where she and Stiller get drunk is charming in this awkward sort of way.Tower Heist would actually be pretty decent if it wasn't for how everything is resolved at the end. What the team ends up stealing, how they get it out of the hotel, where it ends up, and what they do with it just ruins anything you may have liked up until that point. Nearly every actor that's part of the main cast at least has one line that will make you smile or laugh out loud, so everyone gets their moment to shine. It doesn't save a shoddy movie that can't find its footing in the story department though.

The dialogue and character interaction was simply unimaginative and predictable. Eddie Murphy is back to his quick talking, bad boy ways, but this routine was more tiresome than funny or nostalgic. Ben Stiller is playing one of his typical roles, but really brings nothing new to the film. And Matthew Broderick seems a little out of his element. It's too bad the script couldn't have been a little more inventive.  Also, the plot alternates between being ridiculous and very predictable. It is watchable? Yes, but you can pretty much guess what is going to happen. There wasn't much of a payoff at the end, either.The film was entertaining at points, but seemed long, longer than its running time.

Now we have a comedy version and the script  (a group recipe effort by Ted Griffin, Jeff Nathanson, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage) borders on the weak side, depending on a huge cast of well-known actors to pull it off.  Everyone tries, but despite some good moments the effort is thwarted by too many sidebars getting in the way of the momentum.Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the manager of a residential apartment in New York. He is close to all the tenants, especially Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a financier. As it happens, Shaw is arrested by the FBI for fraud. Josh thinks it's a misunderstanding that can be resolved. But later he learns that the employees' pension which he asked Shaw to handle is gone. When one of the employees tries to kill himself, Josh's views of Shaw change. He goes to see him and loses his temper. He loses his job. The FBI agent (T&eacute;a Leoni) in charge of Shaw tells him that Shaw might walk and recovering the pension fund is unlikely. She tells him that it's been rumored that Shaw has 20 million laying around if he needs. Josh thinks he knows where it is. And that hatches the plot for pulling off the heist of a sophisticated Ferrari supposedly mad of gold) and Josh gathers the most obtuse group of people to pull of this heist: Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Stephen Henderson, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Gabourey Sidibe.  The outcome is predictable but it is the getting there that holds some funny lines, as we would expect from this groups of actors.No, it is not a great movie, but it has its entertaining moments and a very beautiful red Ferrari to hold our attention.

He finds out the boss he used to have respect for Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is actually a crook who has stolen not only his money but all the employees money in the whole building. We're talking wages, life savings, what have you. Shaw is already under investigation by the Feds, so he has nothing to lose and could care less if he's brought a lot of suffering to people he swindled ala Bernie Madoff.Josh vows to get revenge assembling all of the people with an axe to grind on Shaw and planning an elaborate heist. Trouble is no one has a freaking clue how to pull it off.Josh enlists a crook named Slide (Eddie Murphy) to bring his expertise to lead the plan.This movie is very funny. Obviously all of the big names here are all comedy veterans: Stiller is a joke a minute, Broderick has always been good in whatever role he's been given, Michael Pena is a good and up coming actor,but probably the biggest surprise here has to be Eddie Murphy.Eddie is a comedy veteran to be sure, but he has been in a A LOT of bad, bad movies, so this was a nice change from all that. In fact I got a ""Trading Places"" vibe here when he gets recruited by Josh to be part of the team.There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie that everybody will have a favorite one.

1392368,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004A8ZWWO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","What with the big Hollywood names recruited to this caper picture, I was expecting much more out of TOWER HEIST. I figure when you rope in the likes of Matthew Broderick, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, and T&eacute;a Leoni, that you're in for sensational stuff. But TOWER HEIST is okay, just okay. It should've been more.In a brilliant bit of counter-casting, Alan Alda plays the heavy. Alan Alda, who is such a nice guy that, next to him, Norman Rockwell is a piker. Alda plays unscrupulous Wall Street kingpin Arthur Shaw (ranked #138 on the Forbes 400 list), a man so self-satisfied he's got Steve McQueen's original 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Luso on wanton display in his swank penthouse. But there's no crime against smugness. Except that Arthur Shaw is also an embezzler, a swindler so slimy he's been running the Ponzi scam on those what had been diligently staffing the New York luxury apartment high-rise in which he resides. Alan Alda is pretty spectacular in his heel turn.What's that phrase? Never crap where you eat? When the Tower's wound-up building manager Josh Kovacs (Stiller) learns that Shaw had cleaned out his work force's pension funds and investments, he concocts a plan to break into Shaw's penthouse and crack his safe. To pull off the heist, he engages the services of a crew of losers and underdogs, including an evicted math whiz (Broderick), the daughter of a Jamaican safecracker (Gabourey Sidibe), a low-rent street hood (Murphy), and a tech ""expert"" (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) who took an online electrical engineering course at the DeVry Technical Institute. I guess the Three Stooges weren't available.I did like the character dynamics. Even though Stiller's schtick is more suited to his playing the put-upon target of fate, he pulls off his mastermind role while retaining his trademark quirks. And, frankly, it's just nice to see Eddie Murphy go back to his roots and channel his edgier side. But the film criminally underutilizes Matthew Broderick and T&eacute;a Leoni (who plays the FBI agent on the case).The Tower - refusing to own up to the missing ""Trump"" in the middle - flaunts a sophisticated seucrity system and is, to boot, guarded by a complement of FBI agents (because the G-Men had finally caught wise to Arthur Shaw and had placed him under house arrest pending his trial). So, yes, another impediment facing our amateur crooks is that the target site is always inhabited by Shaw. Anyway, cue the time-honored montage in which the crew cases the joint and identifies the obstacles. Cue also the internal infighting and fall-outs. And cue the last-minute swerves and then watch as our hapless squad tries to adapt. Props, by the way, to the funky cool theme score. It's very reminiscent of the theme songs from those 1970s caper films (THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 comes to mind).Given that Kovacs and his squad are woefully unschooled in the art of taking what's not yours, I'm still bothered at how weak their execution was, and how lame the idea behind the heist itself was, to begin with. Writer Ted Griffin slavishly follows the mechanics of the heist film, and the shocks he injects - as the heist naturally goes horribly off the rails - won't have anyone suddenly gripping their armrest. At least the experienced cast gets to dabble with comic chemistry, and so we're treated to amusing scenes in which Murphy, Stiller, and Broderick interact. Imagine how much better they could've been if only they were working with superior material? Sucks that, ultimately, the rallying theme of the little guys versus the big, bad crook is undercut by the slick but impersonal tone the film generates. TOWER HEIST will entertain you; it goes down easy. But, two days later, you'll probably have forgotten about it.Okay, I love movie quotes, and three quotes have stuck in my brain: ""I never saw an episode of Matlock... where the criminal banged Matlock."" (Broderick's remark when he thinks Stiller and Leoni are acting too chummy); ""We stick to the plan. We go on Snoopy."" (Stiller's cue for his crew to spring into action); and, lastly, Leoni's outburst when she catches sight of that Ferrari.The DVD's bonus stuff:- 2 Alternate Endings: ""15 Months Later"" (00:00:37 seconds) & ""Lester's Bar"" (00:01:50 minute)- 9 Deleted/Alternate Scenes (totaling 00:05:58 minutes)- Gag Reel (00:04:18 minutes)- Plotting TOWER HEIST: 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes (totaling 00:47:19 minutes)- Audio Commentary by director Brett Ratner, editor Mark Helfrich and co-writers Ted Griffin & Jeff Nathanson",3,"""You've got Steve McQueen's car parked in your living room?

This satisfying romp is for the people whose finances took a hit from the notorious felon Bernie Madoff. All of his victims should attend this film because they want to see a heartless crook get his comeuppance!This is a low-tech version of ""Ocean's 11,"" with another likable cast, a loathable villain, and a laudable cause. A wealthy shyster has squandered and lost billions, including the pension plan for the hard-working staff in The Tower, his ultra-elegant, supremely secure high-rise. It's fun to watch some earnest amateurs try to get their pensions back!Here is the gold-plated cast:* Eddie Murphy (""Chicago"") has to be bailed out of jail; none of our heroes knows how to steal, so they need his professional advice.* Ben Stiller (""Tropic Thunder"") is the extraordinarily efficient manager of The Tower, organized, resourceful and loyal. It's that loyalty that drives him to even the score.* Matthew Broderick (""The Producers"") is a trader who just lost everything: his wife, his kids, his job, and now his home...but he sure has a knack for numbers!* Michael Pe&ntilde;a (""Crash"") is a former Burger King counter man; he has just been hired to run an elevator in The Tower.* Alan Alda (""Flash of Genius"") is the penthouse-dwelling scumbag behind the Ponzi scheme.* Casey Affleck (""Ocean's"" franchise) cares more about the pending birth of his first child than he does about planning a robbery.* T&eacute;a Leoni (""Ghost Town"") is a smart FBI agent who has nothing but contempt for the crook who just might be getting away with it.* Gabourney Sidibe (""Precious"") is an immigrant from Jamaica. Her papa was a locksmith, so she learned the trade...* Stephen Henderson (""The Good Heart"") is the long-time doorman who gives us a face and a heart that represent all the powerless victims of Wall Street.Combine a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, a cute little Brussels Griffon looking for a doggy treat, a funny script, great pacing, plus appealing stars, and you have an entertaining 104 minutes.

I won't go through the entire movie but in a nutshell, here's what happens.Ben Stiller's character Josh Kovacs is the General Manager of a high priced condo building in New York called The Tower.  Each unit in the building costs $5 million or more dollars and comes with a staff that caters to the owners 24/7.  Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is a big time money manager who owns the penthouse apartment.  Early in the movie, we see the FBI arrest Arthur Shaw for fraud and theft.  We find out that Josh Kovacs had asked Arthur Shaw to manage the pension money for the staff at the Tower so everyone has lost their money.  After one employee tries to commit suicide, Josh decides to take matters into his own hands and try to find Arthur Shaw's secret stash of money.  He believes it could be hidden in a wall safe.  So Josh recruits some of the other people in the building, employees and one former owner to help him break into Arthur Shaws apartment.Without giving away the whole plot, the movie is about how they go about doing this and the ending is very unexpected.

This is how the story goes: Queens native Josh Kovacs has managed one of the most luxurious and well-secured residences in New York City for more than a decade. Under his watchful eye, nothing goes undetected. In the swankiest unit atop Josh's building, Wall Street titan Arthur Shaw is under house arrest after being caught stealing two billion from his investors. The hardest hit among those he defrauded? The tower staffers whose pensions he was entrusted to manage.With only days before Arthur gets away with the perfect crime, Josh's crew turns to petty crook Slide to plan the nearly impossible, to steal what they are sure is hidden in Arthur's guarded condo. Though amateurs, these rookie thieves know the building better than anyone. Turns out they've been casing the place for years, they just didn't know it.The cast led by Ben Stiller (as Josh) & Eddie Murphy (as Slide, who was also a producer on the film) is great. The directing by Brett Ratner is great. The story by Ted Griffin, Bill Collage & Adam Cooper is great & the screenplay by Griffin & Jeff Nathanson is also great.The music by Christophe Beck is great.

Yes, as some have pointed out, there are implausibilities in the film, but in my opinion these just make it funnier.  It's a comedy, after all, not a scientific treatise, and the idea is just to go along for the ride and have fun.  Ben Stiller is at his best in roles like this one where he is a regular guy and not a comic buffoon. He comes across as authentic and determined in his intentions and yet way out there in terms of the ideas he comes up with to solve the problem; it's those way-out-there ideas that add to the humor.  Even so, his instincts are right on the money, and the breakthrough comes as a result of his ability to think his way through the evidence to arrive at the truth.I had not seen Casey Affleck before and had no idea he was such a good actor.  I thoroughly enjoyed his performance, from his first day as a boss to his frantic response to the text message.Eddie Murphy, although not at his peak in this film, still added that brand of humor that is his trademark.  He is the wild card that this film needed to keep from being too cliche.Tea Leoni was superb as the attorney, and the rest of the cast was also good.

It's a fun heist film with some surprisingly good scenes and focuses around a group of high class tower employees who find out their pensions have been mismanaged by one of the big tenants of the tower. A group of them decide to rob the big tenant's safe and that's pretty much the rest of the story. There are alternative endings but I think I liked the bittersweet one they gave to the Ben Stiller character at the end. Murphy got a lot of acclaim in his role as the two timing thief who reluctantly offers to help the others rob the tower. Alda did a wonderful job as the overall antagonist of the picture. It's a fun picture that definitely was influenced by Occupy Wall Street following.The budget was $75M (after tax rebates) and it made a bit over $152M at the Box Office. It was conceived as early as 2005 when Murphy pitched it as a group of men played by black comedians who do a heist at Trump Tower.

Granted, his is not the good performance he had in ""Dreamgirls"" but it surpasses most of the fare he's been associated with recently.  The film is pretty standard stuff along the lines of the ""Oceans"" series.  Not as good as the best but certainly better than the worst.  Hotel manager Josh (Ben Stiller) decides to go after a Madoff-like bizillionaire investor, played by Alan Alda, after he loses all of Josh's money along with the entire hotel staff.  Josh enlists several of the staff members to help him as well as parolee Slide (Murphy) who Josh knew from grammar school.Shaw (Alda) is believed to have a large sum of money hidden somewhere in the hotel/residence (played by Trump Tower) where he lives.  It turns out it's not cash, jewelry or bonds but something less obvious and in plain sight.  The movie does have some very funny lines, many of which are delivered not my Murphy but by Matthew Broderick in his role as accomplice, Mr. Fitzhugh, an evicted tenant and former broker.  The final act however goes beyond the laws of reasonability and becomes ridiculous.  Overall the film is a pleasant time waster and not much else.Although this film is mildly entertaining, the transfer to Blu ray is top notch.  It is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and looks great.  Even the small details are evident.  The colors are good.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 is equally impressive.

While Tower Heist is a well-executed, lively and entertaining feature, it would have to be special indeed to live up to its billing. It doesn't, quite.Alda plays it straight as Arthur Shaw, a Bernie Madoff style tycoon living atop the titular Tower, an exclusive Manhattan high-rise with a swimming pool on its roof decorated with a $100 bill. Stiller is Josh Kovacs, the perfectionist building manager for the Tower: A soul of discretion and tact, catering to every possible whim of his residents. He lives way uptown on the other side of the tracks, arises at the crack of dawn, irons his own shirts, plays chess online with Shaw, and still arrives before his clients awake. He also looks after his ever-loyal staff: Josh has arranged for the staff pension plan to be invested by Shaw, a genius money manager, who has reluctantly acceded to the request. No prizes for guessing the surprise Alda has for everyone, and which drives the action in the film. Alda is put under house arrest by improbably-named FBI hack Gertie Fiansen (T&eacute;a Leoni), but not before secreting away $400m of missing cash, the only remnants of which are some modern art-works and Steve McQueen's 19634 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso, which he has had restored and installed in his top-floor penthouse living room: how the other half live, to the max.Josh hatches a plan find the cash and steal his staff's pension back, and ropes in a few helpers. Much frivolity and hilarity follows. Eddie Murphy is Slide, a local hood in Stiller's neighbourhood, enlisted for his criminal smarts, and is on fine form,  machine-gun wise-cracking as if Beverley Hills Cop was only yesterday. Matthew Broderick is an overweight quant, down on his luck and recently fired from Merrill Lynch, who adds a couple of nice lines but generally seems underused, or perhaps overwhelmed, by the occasion. Judd Hirsch plays Stiller's boss, and he plays it even straighter than Alda.There is an interesting on-screen rumination about the value of parts as against the whole which I can't disclose for fear of spoilers, but given the cast it struck me as ironic to say the least.This is a fun Manhattan caper movie, but never quite reaches its potential. Tina Fey and Steve Carrell's Date Night was to all intents the same film, only better, but it was bracing all the same to see Murphy in top gear, greats like Hirsch and Alda on the screen even if they didn't have much to do, and interesting to see what had become of Broderick, although on this showing, I fear he is likely to head right back into the Where Are They Now file from whence he was apparently plucked.Fun, but inessentialOlly Buxton",3,On the value of parts,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,2991,"['When', 'assemble', 'one', 'place', 'such', 'comic', 'luminaries', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'own', 'right', 'legend', 'last', 'millennium', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quieter', 'one', 'have', 'current', 'A-lister', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'bargain', 'then', 'questions', 'values', 'parts', 'sum', 'whole', 'will', 'surely', 'arise', 'Tower', 'Heist', 'well-executed', 'lively', 'entertaining', 'feature', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'special', 'indeed', 'live', 'up', 'billing', ""n't"", 'quite.Alda', 'plays', 'straight', 'Arthur', 'Shaw', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'style', 'tycoon', 'living', 'titular', 'Tower', 'exclusive', 'Manhattan', 'high-rise', 'swimming', 'pool', 'roof', 'decorated', '100', 'bill', 'Stiller', 'Josh', 'Kovacs', 'perfectionist', 'building', 'manager', 'Tower', 'soul', 'discretion', 'tact', 'catering', 'possible', 'whim', 'residents', 'way', 'uptown', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'arises', 'crack', 'dawn', 'irons', 'own', 'shirts', 'plays', 'chess', 'online', 'Shaw', 'still', 'clients', 'awake', 'also', 'ever-loyal', 'staff', 'Josh', 'arranged', 'staff', 'pension', 'plan', 'be', 'invested', 'Shaw', 'genius', 'money', 'manager', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'acceded', 'request', 'prizes', 'guessing', 'surprise', 'Alda', 'everyone', 'action', 'film', 'Alda', 'put', 'house', 'arrest', 'improbably-named', 'FBI', 'hack', 'Gertie', 'Fiansen', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'not', 'secreting', 'away', '400m', 'missing', 'cash', 'only', 'remnants', 'are', 'modern', 'art-works', 'Steve', 'McQueen', '19634', 'Ferrari', '250', 'GT', 'Lusso', 'had', 'restored', 'installed', 'top-floor', 'penthouse', 'living', 'room', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'live', 'max.Josh', 'plan', 'find', 'cash', 'steal', 'staff', 'pension', 'back', 'ropes', 'few', 'helpers', 'Much', 'frivolity', 'hilarity', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Slide', 'local', 'hood', 'Stiller', 'neighbourhood', 'enlisted', 'criminal', 'smarts', 'fine', 'form', 'machine-gun', 'wise-cracking', 'Beverley', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'was', 'only', 'yesterday', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'overweight', 'quant', 'down', 'luck', 'recently', 'fired', 'Merrill', 'Lynch', 'who', 'couple', 'nice', 'lines', 'generally', 'underused', 'perhaps', 'overwhelmed', 'occasion', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Stiller', 'boss', 'even', 'straighter', 'Alda.There', 'interesting', 'on-screen', 'rumination', 'value', 'parts', 'whole', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'fear', 'spoilers', 'given', 'cast', 'struck', 'ironic', 'say', 'least.This', 'fun', 'Manhattan', 'caper', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'potential', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Date', 'Night', 'was', 'intents', 'same', 'film', 'only', 'better', 'was', 'bracing', 'same', 'see', 'Murphy', 'top', 'gear', 'greats', 'Hirsch', 'Alda', 'screen', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'become', 'Broderick', 'showing', 'fear', 'likely', 'head', 'right', 'back', 'Where', 'Are', 'Now', 'file', 'whence', 'was', 'apparently', 'plucked.Fun', 'inessentialOlly', 'Buxton']",Tower Heist

I actually went in to this flick thinking it may end up to cheesy for my liking, but I am thrilled I did not listen to the negative reviews & watched it myself to form my own conclusion, & obviously I thoroughly enoyed this flick.So folks, go ahead & watch it & form your own conclusions.To the reviewers who said this was 'boring & slow paced' - Personally, I found the opposite to be true. VERY FAR from 'boring' & even further away from 'slow paced'..I thought this was a very fast paced flick that was anything but boring.To the reviewer who said this flick is only good if your an eddie murphay fan - EM, in my opinion has not had a good flick in ages. In fact, im struggling to think what his last excellent/good flick was.....1st let me say that EM was just fine in this flick.....he played his part very well, but if anything, he was about the only 'critical' part of this flick, but the flick was good enough to carry em, hence, im still giving it 5 stars, although I cant say this was a 'great performance' by EM...Again, imo, he was fine..not great, not bad, just a smallish & simple character & the movie carried him....I actually think EM fans would be disappointed if they watch this expecting to see his 1st great performance in a long time. But they will see a great flick that is fast paced, enjoyable & should enjoy EM's character, albeit, certainly not at the top of EM's list. Then again, considering the bulk of EM's movies since ages ago, were pitiful...pitiful movies & pitiful acting by EM, Tower Heist was quite good so it certainly doesnt rank as one of EM's worst, & is likely in the middle somewhere. If anything, with all his latest flicks bombing, although this wasn't his greatest performance, it should help get him a few more flicks so we can then see if EM's best days are behind him or if he can manage to resurrect what appeared to be a dead career.FUN & ENJOYABLE FLICK.....Watch & judge for yourself.Happy Holidays.",5,fun & enjoyable,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2245,"['Lots', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'hated', 'loved', 'it.I', 'loved', 'plot', 'was', 'cool', 'slight', 'twist', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'visuals', 'were', 'striking.With', 'so', 'many', 'loving', 'so', 'many', 'hating', 'rec', 'ignore', 'reviews', 'wont', 'know', 'liked', 'not', 'watch', 'actually', 'went', 'flick', 'thinking', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'cheesy', 'liking', 'am', 'thrilled', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'negative', 'reviews', 'watched', 'form', 'own', 'conclusion', 'obviously', 'thoroughly', 'enoyed', 'flick.So', 'folks', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'form', 'own', 'conclusions.To', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'was', ""'boring"", 'slow', 'paced', 'Personally', 'found', 'opposite', 'be', 'true', 'VERY', 'FAR', ""'boring"", 'even', 'further', 'away', ""'slow"", ""paced'..I"", 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'flick', 'was', 'anything', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'flick', 'only', 'good', 'eddie', 'murphay', 'fan', 'EM', 'opinion', 'not', 'had', 'good', 'flick', 'ages', 'fact', 'im', 'struggling', 'think', 'what', 'last', 'excellent/good', 'flick', 'was', '..1st', 'let', 'say', 'EM', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'flick', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'anything', 'was', 'only', ""'critical"", 'part', 'flick', 'flick', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'em', 'hence', 'im', 'still', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'cant', 'say', 'was', ""'great"", 'performance', 'EM', 'Again', 'imo', 'was', 'fine..not', 'great', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'smallish', 'simple', 'character', 'movie', 'carried', '.I', 'actually', 'think', 'EM', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'watch', 'expecting', 'see', '1st', 'great', 'performance', 'long', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'great', 'flick', 'fast', 'paced', 'enjoyable', 'should', 'enjoy', 'EM', 'character', 'albeit', 'certainly', 'not', 'top', 'EM', 'list', 'Then', 'again', 'considering', 'bulk', 'EM', 'movies', 'ages', 'ago', 'were', 'pitiful', 'pitiful', 'movies', 'pitiful', 'acting', 'EM', 'Tower', 'Heist', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'certainly', 'rank', 'one', 'EM', 'worst', 'likely', 'middle', 'somewhere', 'anything', 'latest', 'flicks', 'bombing', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'performance', 'should', 'help', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'flicks', 'can', 'then', 'see', 'EM', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'can', 'manage', 'resurrect', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'dead', 'career.FUN', 'ENJOYABLE', 'FLICK', '..Watch', 'judge', 'yourself.Happy', 'Holidays']",Tower Heist

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out.

This film is a twisted wreck of inane plot points, a few of which I'm about to point out, BUT if you haven't already seen it then don't read what follows because I really think you ought to waste a couple of hours finding out how bad it is for yourself.There, now I'm not a special kind of jerk...This movie has to be the all time champion of inane plot points. It's actually stunning to sit there and watch how one senseless scene leads to another. The first hint that this is going to be a turkey of epic proportions comes during the opening sequence when they show two of the lead characters playing chess via computer. One quick glance at the board and anyone who knows anything about chess can see the game is long over. But they play on as the obvious loser makes a move and acts as if it's a real gem.Among the many, many plot points that will leave you speechless...In what condo building does the manager, who is just an employee himself, get to decide how all of the other employee's retirement accounts will be invested without their knowledge or consent?If the heist gang has all the access and security codes to the luxury condo building why does Eddie Murphy lock them on rooftop so they can learn to open a door with a hair pin? His character is a small time crook who steals things from people's balconies, why do they even recruit him for the luxury condo heist?Why does Alan Alda have an empty safe hidden within in a permanent wall of his condo? How could he ever use this safe? Seriously, they break the wall down with sledge hammers only to find a hidden EMPTY safe! They know the safe is in this wall because it's the only one that wasn't torn down years ago when the owner remodeled. So they figure that's where he hid $20 million that he recently set aside... in the safe that's been hidden in the wall that he hasn't touched in ten years. Did NO ONE on this set say, ""Um guys, does this make any sense?""Why in the world does Ben Stiller recruit a down-on-his-luck, ex-tenant with no related skills to help out with this heist?The theives wear masks until all of the security cameras are covered and yet the FBI knows who to round up immediately after the heist, including the superfluous ex-tenant! How?How do you knock out an FBI agent for an hour or so by running a cleaning cart into his knees?How do they fool the FBI into thinking that they're due to bring their suspect into court on Thanksgiving Day? (To their credit when a guard tells them that the court is closed on Thanksgiving they quickly realize that it's a deversion!)How did Alan Alda manage to get a solid gold car assembled his penthouse without anyone knowing that it was a solid gold car? Why would he even want a solid gold car in his penthouse living room? Was he going to break peices off as he needed the cash?They tell Alan Alda that one employee he bilked has ""stepped in front of a train"" and then a moment later they say, ""Ah Ha! You really don't care because you didn't ask if he was dead or not!"" Really? You tell him someone stepped in front of a train and he's supposed to ask if he's OK!? What kind of moron would he have to be to ask if the guy who stepped in front of the train is OK?Trust me, I'm just highlighting a FEW of the jaw droppingly inane twists in this bomb. It just goes on and on. You could actually invent a drinking game based on taking a shot evey time something inexplicable happens. You'd be soooo drunk!By the time they start moving the solid gold car around the building like it's made of styrofoam you'll just be shaking your head.

Unfortunately the writers may have put in the foundations but didn't get round to furnishing the jokes or thrills a comedy heist movie needs, leaving the cast with surprisingly little to do as the film continually sets up would-be comic situations only to cut away to the next order of business before they have a chance to pay off. Even more unfortunately there's either no room or no incentive for them to improvise either, with Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick and Casey Affleck seemingly sticking to the unfunny script with dogged but unremarkable professionalism while director Brett Ratner, this millennium's Michael Winner, lazily treads water and brings nothing to the party like a man who wants to finish early every day and spend all the money he's making for this old rope. Things pick up slightly during the heist itself as they find themselves trying to smuggle their unexpectedly bulky loot out of the building but it's never more than watchable but completely forgettable even while you're watching it.Not much in the way of extras on the DVD - a few brief deleted scenes including an unconvincing alternate ending, gag reel and a self-congratulatory audio commentary - but after the film it's doubtful you'd want to spend any more time with it anyway.

Meanwhile, the money in your paycheck earmarked for your pension has evaporated into thin air. While this might be enough to make anyone snap, imagine being at the beck and call of the man responsible for bankrupting, not only your retirement fund, but that of all your coworkers.The Tower is home to the most expensive real estate in New York City. But the real draw of The Tower is not the location or the amenities in any of the individual apartments, but the staff which is on duty 24/7. The penthouse apartment is occupied by The Tower's wealthiest resident Arthur Shaw (played by Alan Alda) who is the CEO of a high-return investment group. When his fund is exposed to law enforcement and in the press as a Ponzi scheme, it falls to building manager Josh Kovacs (played by Ben Stiller) to inform the staff of The Tower that he'd invested their pensions with Shaw and that said pensions are most likely lost. And during all this, Shaw (Alda) is under house arrest in The Tower. But when a doorman just shy of his retirement becomes despondent and attempts suicide, Kovacs resolves to find the rainy day fund that FBI Agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) assures him Shaw is hiding. All in the hopes of retrieving what's rightfully theirs Kovacs, Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck), the building concierge and Josh's brother-in-law, and Mr. Fitzhugh (played by Matthew Broderick), a former Merrill Lynch employee who was evicted from The Tower after losing his job, savings, and marriage, join forces and begin devising a strategy for the caper. But knowing they're in over their heads, Josh enlists Slide (played by Eddie Murphy), a thief and Kovacs neighbor who he once went to school with.I've never been a big fan of Ben Stiller and while I have great appreciation for Eddie Murphy's early work (the Beverly Hills Cop series, Coming to America and even The Distinguished Gentleman) I've long-believed his best years as anything but a voice actor were behind him.

Perhaps ""Tower Heist"" is not as hilarious as a John Landis' classic comedy, but the slick caper comedy manages to entertain with the solid acting from the cast. And good news is that Eddie Murphy is back. Maybe not as great as when he was Reggie Hammond or Axel Foley, but still very good.After losing their money because of a corrupt billionaire Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a group of his employees including Ben Stiller's hard-working building manager Josh Kovacs enlists the help from a small-time crook Slide (Eddie Murphy) in order to get back what belongs to them - 20 million dollars - from Shaw's penthouse of a New York high-class apartment building.The storyline itself is not very unique, and the heist sequence is a bit slack, but the cast including Casey Affleck, Matthew Broderick, T&eacute;a Leoni, Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Gabourey Sidibe did a great job. Eddie Murphy is back in top form as a fast-talking, street-wise guy opposite straight-faced Ben Stiller, who is also very effective.""Tower Heist"" is not a satire of the current economic problems.

The film is not exactly OCEAN'S 11 (new & old), but comes close. The plot is very simple, a Bernie Madoff-type/Wall Street billionaire composit, Arthur Shaw (played by Alan Alda) 'steals' money from unsuspecting (the common man) investors and Josh Kovacs(Stiller),one of the investors, heads a group of five unlikely mercenaries to try to get some of that money back. [They] plan to infiltrate Shaw's penthouse because there's a tip that there may be $20 Million stashed in a hidden safe. The film then spends it's time by showing how the group comes together and plan the heist. In-between, you get some character development, but mostly it's the comic banter between the mostly mis-matched wannabe 'thieves' that makes the film worthwhile. A couple of slight-of-hand twists to the heist plot is thrown in for good measure, but it doesn't deter from the overall plan. Lastly, as with all great 'heist' films, there is always a happy ending, and this film doesn't disappoint. Overall, a decent heist film, with Stiller and Murphy heading a pretty good ensemble cast...with an inside nod/joke (or pure coincidence) to Broderick's ""Ferris Bueller"" character 25 years ago.

The downside is that it doesn't quite make it into the league of above average heist films and is not a full-blown comedy either. This is a pity because the cast is awesome - there's Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Alan Alda, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Gabourey Sidibe, Casey Affleck, and more.The premise of the story is one that many can relate to - the employees at a posh apartment complex discover they've been duped by a rich businessman in a Ponzi scheme. Ben Affleck plays apartment complex manager, Josh Kovacs, who due to his implicit trust in said businessman, Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda pulling off a very credible Madoff-like role), gets Shaw to invest not only his pension, but those of all the employees at the complex, believing their portfolio would increase threefold. When Shaw is arrested for his Ponzi scheme, the lead FBI investigator (played by Leoni) fails to find any incriminating evidence. Meanwhile, Kovacs decides to rob Shaw, believing Shaw has hidden the stolen money somewhere in his penthouse. The rest of the story follows Kovacs and his accomplices as they try to plan a heist.There was much potential for this to be an above-average comedy-heist movie but it sort of flounders due to a lackluster script. The cast is a talented one but the actors could only work with what they are given, resulting in weak character development, and some lags in pacing. Overall, my husband and I were entertained - this makes a fun rental movie, but not a keeper.",3,Fun but nothing spectacular,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1557,"['Tower', 'Heist', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'fun', 'movie', 'downside', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'league', 'above', 'average', 'heist', 'films', 'not', 'full-blown', 'comedy', 'either', 'pity', 'cast', 'awesome', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Gabourey', 'Sidibe', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'more.The', 'premise', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'employees', 'posh', 'apartment', 'complex', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'been', 'duped', 'rich', 'businessman', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'apartment', 'complex', 'manager', 'Josh', 'Kovacs', 'who', 'due', 'implicit', 'trust', 'said', 'businessman', 'Arthur', 'Shaw', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'pulling', 'off', 'very', 'credible', 'Madoff-like', 'role', 'Shaw', 'invest', 'not', 'only', 'pension', 'employees', 'complex', 'believing', 'portfolio', 'would', 'increase', 'threefold', 'When', 'Shaw', 'arrested', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'lead', 'FBI', 'investigator', 'played', 'Leoni', 'find', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'Meanwhile', 'Kovacs', 'rob', 'Shaw', 'believing', 'Shaw', 'hidden', 'stolen', 'money', 'somewhere', 'penthouse', 'rest', 'story', 'Kovacs', 'accomplices', 'try', 'plan', 'heist.There', 'was', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'above-average', 'comedy-heist', 'movie', 'sort', 'flounders', 'due', 'lackluster', 'script', 'cast', 'talented', 'one', 'actors', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'resulting', 'weak', 'character', 'development', 'lags', 'pacing', 'Overall', 'husband', 'were', 'entertained', 'fun', 'rental', 'movie', 'not', 'keeper']",Tower Heist
