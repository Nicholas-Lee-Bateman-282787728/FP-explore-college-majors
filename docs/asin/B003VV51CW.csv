When an Old Family goes quiet, followed by a strange looking contingent claiming to be their successor, you'd send someone to find out what happened wouldn't you?  Underneath all the compliments and lubricating flattery, both Marco Polo and these two travelers show just who these Mongolians are.  These people who find more profit in short term gains of strong-arming communities and the cause of the treacherousness of the Silk Road route.  Ever notice no one is afraid to bad mouth the Chinese?  Why is that?  This is a must buy for Chinese families especially for the Overseas Chinese who most often have forgotten, not inherited the wisdom of experience of why the Chinese are circumspect, cluster their residences and how we have been misrepresented and by who.  This is a great companion for visiting the Great Wall.  But doubly precious are the characters and style of the two guys from Queens, New York - because there is no way to describe New Yorker Americans.Why would China build and maintain the Great Wall at the cost of human lives and disrupting families?  What would happen to Chinese families that would be so terrible that the successive dynasties would jeopardize their hold on power to keep the wall?  What was happening to communities whenever the wall was breached?  It's hard to understand from written accounts like Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking but check out the Discovery channel's The Whale that Exploded in Taiwan to get an accurate visual.  What happened to Europe when the Mongolians couldn't get past the wall and headed West?  Why are fighting in Afghanistan?  Who was Attila the Hun and why did the French describe WWI Germans as Huns?",5,2 for the price of 1,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1796,"['am', 'so', 'grateful', 'two', 'guys', 'Queens', 'decided', 'share', 'videotapes', 'excursion', 'following', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'route', 'When', 'Old', 'Family', 'quiet', 'followed', 'strange', 'looking', 'contingent', 'claiming', 'be', 'successor', ""'d"", 'send', 'someone', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'would', ""n't"", 'compliments', 'lubricating', 'flattery', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'two', 'travelers', 'show', 'just', 'who', 'Mongolians', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'more', 'profit', 'short', 'term', 'gains', 'strong-arming', 'communities', 'cause', 'treacherousness', 'Silk', 'Road', 'route', 'Ever', 'notice', 'one', 'afraid', 'bad', 'Chinese', 'Why', 'must', 'buy', 'Chinese', 'families', 'especially', 'Overseas', 'Chinese', 'who', 'most', 'often', 'have', 'forgotten', 'not', 'inherited', 'wisdom', 'experience', 'why', 'Chinese', 'are', 'circumspect', 'cluster', 'residences', 'how', 'have', 'been', 'misrepresented', 'who', 'great', 'companion', 'visiting', 'Great', 'Wall', 'doubly', 'precious', 'are', 'characters', 'style', 'two', 'guys', 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'way', 'describe', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Americans.Why', 'would', 'China', 'build', 'maintain', 'Great', 'Wall', 'cost', 'human', 'lives', 'disrupting', 'families', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'Chinese', 'families', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'terrible', 'successive', 'dynasties', 'would', 'jeopardize', 'hold', 'power', 'keep', 'wall', 'What', 'was', 'happening', 'communities', 'whenever', 'wall', 'was', 'breached', 'hard', 'understand', 'written', 'accounts', 'Iris', 'Chang', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'check', 'out', 'Discovery', 'channel', 'Whale', 'Exploded', 'Taiwan', 'get', 'accurate', 'visual', 'What', 'happened', 'Europe', 'when', 'Mongolians', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'wall', 'headed', 'West', 'Why', 'are', 'fighting', 'Afghanistan', 'Who', 'was', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'why', 'did', 'French', 'describe', 'WWI', 'Germans', 'Huns']",N/A

1367974,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B003VV51CW,K. Gordon,"[9, 9]","Two best friends re-live their incredible 25,000 mile journey followingMarco Polo's fabled routes through the east.They had no crew, no support team, just two guys from Queens, New YorkCity with a bunch of cameras and video equipment in their backpacksslogging alone through unbelievably difficult territory, risking theirlives by crossing into hostile countries without visas, or enteringstrictly forbidden areas. Sometimes they would get stuck in a locationfor weeks before being able to find a way to go on.But these are two tough, as well as endearing dudes. They seemed tomanage to make friends wherever they went, but also to stare downChinese army officers with nothing but a bluff.It's interesting and effective to see these guys, now ten years older,reliving the journey in an interview setting, inter-cut with theirvideo footage and still photographs of the journey. You get both theimmediacy of the events, and the benefit of hindsight and memory.Even though the film is only 90 minutes, it somehow doesn't feelrushed, although I could have happily watched hours more. In fact, myonly complaint is that I wish it was longer so we could have seen evenmore details. Quite unique, and a lot of educational fun.",5,Tremendously entertaining documentary,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,1218,"['Two', 'best', 'friends', 're-live', 'incredible', '25,000', 'mile', 'journey', 'followingMarco', 'Polo', 'fabled', 'routes', 'east.They', 'had', 'crew', 'support', 'team', 'just', 'two', 'guys', 'Queens', 'New', 'YorkCity', 'bunch', 'cameras', 'video', 'equipment', 'backpacksslogging', 'alone', 'unbelievably', 'difficult', 'territory', 'risking', 'theirlives', 'crossing', 'hostile', 'countries', 'visas', 'enteringstrictly', 'forbidden', 'areas', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'get', 'stuck', 'locationfor', 'weeks', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'go', 'are', 'two', 'tough', 'as', 'well', 'endearing', 'dudes', 'seemed', 'tomanage', 'make', 'friends', 'went', 'also', 'stare', 'downChinese', 'army', 'officers', 'nothing', 'bluff.It', 'interesting', 'effective', 'see', 'guys', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'reliving', 'journey', 'interview', 'setting', 'inter-cut', 'theirvideo', 'footage', 'still', 'photographs', 'journey', 'get', 'theimmediacy', 'events', 'benefit', 'hindsight', 'memory.Even', 'film', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'feelrushed', 'could', 'have', 'happily', 'watched', 'hours', 'more', 'fact', 'myonly', 'complaint', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'evenmore', 'details', 'Quite', 'unique', 'lot', 'educational', 'fun']",N/A

I am from New York City as these boys are and I think it was there NY ways that kept them alive & full of helpful strangers to help them on their journey. Just strictly from the standpoint that this trip trip they took was prior- 9/11 and could never be done by two Americans today (even if they balls to do it)  made this film blow my mind! It was about two regular guys from America meeting people & seeing things that 99.9% of Americans will never ever get to see. Places that probably aren't even on a map. The guys suffered the heat, cold, hunger, exhaustion, fear, etc... BUT also soaked in the beauty, culture, people & landscapes and they captured it all on film. I have this on film & book and anyone who thinks this is a 3 star film or below must be blind....I have never seen anything as great as this.This is a must see for everyone. Highly suggest this for parents to watch with there kids & discus foreign culture.",5,I will NEVER forget this film!,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,962,"['WOW', 'film', 'was', 'super', 'amazing', 'am', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boys', 'are', 'think', 'was', 'there', 'NY', 'ways', 'kept', 'alive', 'full', 'helpful', 'strangers', 'help', 'journey', 'Just', 'strictly', 'standpoint', 'trip', 'trip', 'took', 'was', 'prior-', '9/11', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'two', 'Americans', 'today', 'even', 'balls', 'do', 'made', 'film', 'blow', 'mind', 'was', 'about', 'two', 'regular', 'guys', 'America', 'meeting', 'people', 'seeing', 'things', '99.9', '%', 'Americans', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'Places', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'map', 'guys', 'suffered', 'heat', 'cold', 'hunger', 'exhaustion', 'fear', 'etc', 'BUT', 'also', 'soaked', 'beauty', 'culture', 'people', 'landscapes', 'captured', 'film', 'have', 'film', 'book', 'anyone', 'who', '3', 'star', 'film', 'below', 'must', 'be', '.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'as', 'great', 'this.This', 'must', 'see', 'everyone', 'Highly', 'suggest', 'parents', 'watch', 'kids', 'discus', 'foreign', 'culture']",N/A
