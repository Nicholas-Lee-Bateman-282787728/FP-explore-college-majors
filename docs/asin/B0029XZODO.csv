1257631,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0029XZODO,barry,"[1, 1]","DEXTER is one of those rare dramas that started with a bang from the get go and has only gotten better with each season.  I purchased this set of the first three seasons and watched all 36 episodes over a matter of two weeks.  It honestly takes only the pilot episode for the show to strongly establish the story line, introduce all the characters as fully developed people and even start a strong plot line.  Of course what holds the show together is Dexter himself.  If this show hadn't been handled so perfectly it could have easily crossed many lines of taste and morals.  But instead it is written, directed, acted and produced with intense loving care and intelligence.We have Dexter Morgan who is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.  He was orphaned at an early age and brought intro a cops family where he quickly formed a strong bond with his sister Debra as well as Harry, his adoptive father.  Dexter saw much bad as an infant and his father notices his tendencies that aren't fully human.  Dexter cannot feel emotions and doesn't understand the difference between right and wrong.  He also has a strong desire to kill.  His father Harry teaches him a code to live and  also to kill by when he must.  He teaches him how to fake emotions and how to behave to appear as belonging in normal society.  Michael C. Hall embodies the adult Dexter fully.  He had a strong character on a previous series SIX FEET UNDER but all that is forgotten with his tour de force performance on DEXTER.  The show is seen through the eyes of Dexter.  His voice over tells us all Dexter is experiencing as the plotlines develop.  We have here a serial killer who only kills people who deserve to die - the serial killers and murderers in society.  For the writers and Michael C. Hall to get the audience to root for a serial killer is a great feat.The first season is amazing and concerns the search for the Ice Truck Killer.  The season runs strong and the finale is amazing - so amazing that season two seemed to start a little slow.  But leave it to DEXTER.  The writers were only continuing the story as necessary to keep everything believable.  And with the blink of an eye season two becomes amazing as well as we now have the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Season three was the first to introduce a guest star throughout the season and we have Jimmy Smits as Miami DA Miguel Prado.  He and Dexter become friends which is a new and confusing thing for Dexter.  Miguel also becomes a sort of apprentice and things get out of control.  In season four John Lithgow appears as The Trinity Killer and DEXTER raises the bar in all areas and it becomes the best season thus far.All characters are believable and acting superb.  Introduced in the first season is troubled soul Rita, a woman with whom Dexter can find some peace.  Her presence other than Debra is the only calming influence for Dexter.  Many tv series have been put on blu ray and it is only a gimmick to take advantage of the new media.  Often picture and audio is lacking and honestly not much better than the dvd option.  DEXTER is the definite exception.  Taking place in Miami there are many beautiful outside shots of sea, sky and beautiful scenery.  It is all crisp and clear.  Facial tones are impeccable and everything about the blu ray video transfer is first rate.  Seeing the close ups and the crispness and ratio of colors and great definition between black/white colors will have the viewer amazed.  And the audio is also heads above the dvd and tv digital options.  The series opening segment begins each episode with strong bass and vibrant sound.  Dialogue is crisp and over it all Dexter's voice over is strong and prominent. It is as if the viewer is in his mind.  And the music is so much more noticable.  When the killings happen all speakers are put to scary use.  The show is more of a front speaker driven show with home theater systems and it is utilized well.  Also when needed the rear speakers come to life full force.  Audio is definitely superb.DEXTER only gets better with each season.  With a great cast, superb writing and the amazing presence of Michael C. Hall as Dexter the show is the most innovative, risk taking and simply the best on tv.  When will Michael C. Hall finally get his well deserved Emmy?  And finally, all the seasons on blu ray come highly recommended.  It ups the ante on the show in every way and shows just how great blu ray can be.",5,Best show on tv - amazing on blu ray,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,4459,"['DEXTER', 'one', 'rare', 'dramas', 'started', 'bang', 'get', 'go', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'season', 'purchased', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'watched', '36', 'episodes', 'matter', 'two', 'weeks', 'honestly', 'only', 'pilot', 'episode', 'show', 'strongly', 'establish', 'story', 'line', 'introduce', 'characters', 'fully', 'developed', 'people', 'even', 'start', 'strong', 'plot', 'line', 'course', 'what', 'show', 'together', 'Dexter', 'show', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'handled', 'so', 'perfectly', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'crossed', 'many', 'lines', 'taste', 'morals', 'instead', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'produced', 'intense', 'loving', 'care', 'intelligence.We', 'have', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'who', 'blood', 'splatter', 'analyst', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'Police', 'Department', 'was', 'orphaned', 'early', 'age', 'brought', 'intro', 'cops', 'family', 'where', 'quickly', 'formed', 'strong', 'bond', 'sister', 'Debra', 'as', 'well', 'Harry', 'adoptive', 'father', 'Dexter', 'saw', 'much', 'bad', 'infant', 'father', 'tendencies', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'human', 'Dexter', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'emotions', ""n't"", 'understand', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'also', 'strong', 'desire', 'kill', 'father', 'Harry', 'code', 'live', 'also', 'kill', 'when', 'must', 'how', 'fake', 'emotions', 'how', 'behave', 'appear', 'belonging', 'normal', 'society', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'adult', 'Dexter', 'fully', 'had', 'strong', 'character', 'previous', 'series', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'forgotten', 'tour', 'force', 'performance', 'DEXTER', 'show', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Dexter', 'voice', 'tells', 'Dexter', 'experiencing', 'plotlines', 'develop', 'have', 'here', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'deserve', 'die', 'serial', 'killers', 'murderers', 'society', 'writers', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'get', 'audience', 'root', 'serial', 'killer', 'great', 'feat.The', 'first', 'season', 'amazing', 'search', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'season', 'strong', 'finale', 'amazing', 'so', 'amazing', 'season', 'two', 'seemed', 'start', 'little', 'slow', 'leave', 'DEXTER', 'writers', 'were', 'only', 'continuing', 'story', 'necessary', 'keep', 'everything', 'believable', 'blink', 'eye', 'season', 'two', 'becomes', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'have', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'first', 'introduce', 'guest', 'star', 'season', 'have', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Miami', 'DA', 'Miguel', 'Prado', 'Dexter', 'become', 'friends', 'new', 'confusing', 'thing', 'Dexter', 'Miguel', 'also', 'sort', 'apprentice', 'things', 'get', 'control', 'season', 'four', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'DEXTER', 'bar', 'areas', 'best', 'season', 'thus', 'far.All', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'acting', 'superb', 'Introduced', 'first', 'season', 'troubled', 'soul', 'Rita', 'woman', 'whom', 'Dexter', 'can', 'find', 'peace', 'presence', 'other', 'Debra', 'only', 'calming', 'influence', 'Dexter', 'Many', 'tv', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'blu', 'ray', 'only', 'gimmick', 'take', 'advantage', 'new', 'media', 'Often', 'picture', 'audio', 'lacking', 'honestly', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'dvd', 'option', 'DEXTER', 'definite', 'exception', 'Taking', 'place', 'Miami', 'are', 'many', 'beautiful', 'outside', 'shots', 'sea', 'sky', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Facial', 'tones', 'are', 'impeccable', 'everything', 'blu', 'ray', 'video', 'transfer', 'first', 'rate', 'Seeing', 'close', 'ups', 'crispness', 'ratio', 'colors', 'great', 'definition', 'black/white', 'colors', 'will', 'have', 'viewer', 'amazed', 'audio', 'also', 'heads', 'dvd', 'tv', 'digital', 'options', 'series', 'opening', 'segment', 'episode', 'strong', 'bass', 'vibrant', 'sound', 'Dialogue', 'crisp', 'Dexter', 'voice', 'strong', 'prominent', 'viewer', 'mind', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'noticable', 'When', 'killings', 'happen', 'speakers', 'are', 'put', 'scary', 'use', 'show', 'more', 'front', 'speaker', 'show', 'home', 'theater', 'systems', 'utilized', 'well', 'Also', 'when', 'needed', 'rear', 'speakers', 'come', 'life', 'full', 'force', 'Audio', 'definitely', 'superb.DEXTER', 'only', 'better', 'season', 'great', 'cast', 'superb', 'writing', 'amazing', 'presence', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Dexter', 'show', 'most', 'innovative', 'risk', 'taking', 'simply', 'best', 'tv', 'When', 'will', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'finally', 'get', 'well', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'finally', 'seasons', 'blu', 'ray', 'come', 'highly', 'recommended', 'ups', 'ante', 'show', 'way', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'blu', 'ray', 'can', 'be']",Dexter: Seasons 1-3

1257635,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0029XZODO,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","For those of us who have been watching DEXTER since its premiere season, this collection of all three seasons is a treat - a reminder of how some of the aspects of this strangely lovable 'serial killer' who only kills (most of the time!) criminals who slip through the cracks of justice came to be.  The series is well written and manages to continue to open up hints dropped in the first season in the just-completed third season.  We now are more fully informed of Dexter's childhood incidents that pushed him into the strange state of existence he now lives  - a married man with family - the fact  which modifies the way he approaches his inner darkness to stalk and destroy evil people.  Characters throughout the show are more credible, the various subplots continue to be developed well - facts that now make Dexter seem more a part of his job as a forensics specialist in a Miami police unit that has many interesting variations of normal police behavior.  Adding such guest stars as Jimmy Smits and John Lithgow raises the show to a different level: the show is now an ongoing story instead of weekly dipping into death.  Who knows how the series will continue to develop, but if the writing and acting continue on this level, season four can only be terrific. Who will they invite into this strange but fascinating atmosphere next?

1257640,AJ66SZG3DGVH1,B0029XZODO,K.H.,"[0, 3]","A lot of people rave about ""Dexter"" and it's won awards, which is why I purchased the Blu-Rays.  I figured that even though I hadn't ever seen the show, so many people couldn't be wrong.  Unfortunately, however, in my opinion, they are.  It's certainly not a bad show, it's just not a great, or even a very good, one.  I think a lot of the appeal that the show has is the fact that the title character is a serial killer.  Throughout the show, you get voice-overs that let you hear what he's thinking and I'm sure that people enjoy the psychological ""peek"" into the mind of a killer.  For me, however, it just came across as over-done high school angst.  Every episode, you're treated to Dexter's thoughts about how he's ""empty inside"" and ""this should bother me, but it doesn't ...and I like that"" type of thing.  After a while, it actually became a little embarrassing to listen to.My other major problem was that the show relies on the viewer completely suspending any and all disbelief.  For example, as a spoiler, take the entire issue of Rita's abusive ex-husband, Paul.  Here's a guy who Dexter decides needs to ""go away.""  So how does he do it?  Elegantly and with an elaborate plan that thwarts detection?  No.  He just smashes the guy in the head while they're in Rita's kitchen and shoots the guy up with heroin that he obtained from, uh, somewhere.  I realize the guy was a former drug user and had been in prison, but it's still a rather large stretch to think that right in the middle of a heated custody battle that he's winning, he gets into an argument with his wife's new boyfriend, winds up with a skull fracture, and everyone just ignores it all and he conveniently drops out of the picture.  That's pretty lousy writing.That's the problem.  There's this phony semblance of tension because, of course, it would be really ridiculous to believe that if I wanted to go kill someone for whatever reason, I could.  Even though that's basically what happens.  So every so often the writers will attempt to inject a ""ooo, Dexter is just about to get caught!!"" moment into the show.  That's basically all of Season 2.  Except that when his bodies get discovered, he just breaks into the police station and destroys the cooling system on the temporary morgue and everyone buys that it's a bunch of clumsy garbage men who did it and goes ""aw, shucks.""  When they tape him black-lighting his boat and cleaning it of blood, he just pulls a fire alarm in the station and everyone runs outside and he erases the tape.  It's almost pathetically silly.  They send an FBI man to help with the investigation, but for some reason that agent keeps the FBI organization formally out of it and just acts as a consultant on loan.  Uh, what?And it extends to other aspects of the show.  The lieutenant is demoted and a woman is then installed as the new lieutenant.  She then promptly goes off the deep end because she suspects her boyfriend of cheating.  That's plausible.  Except that she'll be in the middle of a crime scene with a murder victim and start arguing with her boyfriend on the telephone.  Or there will be a huge breakthrough in a murder case and she'll run into the room and demand that someone analyze her boyfriend's shirt that ""smells like a woman"" (that's the actual line).  Who buys this stuff?  It's at the level of ""recurring joke"" like Joey on ""Friends"" using the line ""how you doin'?"" every time he meets a woman.  Literally every scene the new lieutenant was in, she was spazzing out about her boyfriend.  If you go back and watch the series, she doesn't ever actually do any police work.  I can't even figure out how her character advanced the plot or enhanced the series in any way.  It was like the writers said ""we have to distract viewers from our lazy script where Dexter can literally attempt to kill a guy two times unsuccessfully and the guy sees his face and nothing ever comes of it ...I know, we'll write in this crazed lieutenant for comic relief!""And if that doesn't work, how about gratuitous nuidity?  It's Showtime, so they blatantly show you the breasts of every single female character at some point.  If there's a woman on the series, you will see her breasts.  I'm not saying I'm against that, as a guy, but it's like the rest of the series.  It's just lazy.  There's no real reason to show them, is there?I would rate this show as average.  It will certainly pass the time, but it is definitely NOT gripping in any way.  The writing is, as stated, very simplistic and lazy.  There is nothing mind-blowing or intricate about the series and the premise of a serial-killer performing vigilante killing gets old very fast.

While Dexter's struggle about how to interact with those around him in any given situation is a bit to the extreme and very self-aware so that we the viewer can ride-along with Dexter, it's not so different than the struggle that many people have in trying to relate to others and fit in. Dexter's internal voice is the one we all have subconsciously have mulling around just below the surface. It's the voice we all share even though we're not driven to kill or infatuated with death in the same way Dexter is and as such, Dexter's a character who resonates with most people in many ways.As for the show itself, Dexter's very well written and plotted out. The stories told unfold piece by piece, thus building the suspense and surprise when some new twist to the story is introduced and usually leaves your jaw on the floor. There are elements of everything in Dexter's stories from suspense, mystery and a bit of horror to humor (usually of the dark variety), action and some great dialog. The characters are mostly believable though initially a few of the characters are a bit one-note. However, as the show progresses, so to do the characters and the cast ends up being very strong if not a bit small at times.This show probably isn't for those people affected by violence strongly as it does contain some fairly intense and graphic stuff from time to time (though certainly not over the top or gratuitous. It is an intense study into human nature and in a time when most of the airwaves are filled with vacuous tripe like Jersey Shore, WWE and all the silly ""reality"" TV shows, it's a real blessing to have thoughtful, intelligent scripted drama even if it can be a bit dark at times.",5,The Dark Traveler within all of us,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,1813,"['someone', 'who', 'intelligent', 'story', 'telling', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'introverted', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Dexter', 'many', 'levels', 'Dexter', 'struggle', 'how', 'interact', 'given', 'situation', 'bit', 'extreme', 'very', 'self-aware', 'viewer', 'can', 'ride-along', 'Dexter', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'struggle', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'trying', 'relate', 'others', 'fit', 'Dexter', 'internal', 'voice', 'one', 'have', 'subconsciously', 'have', 'mulling', 'around', 'just', 'surface', 'voice', 'share', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'driven', 'kill', 'infatuated', 'death', 'same', 'way', 'Dexter', 'such', 'Dexter', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'many', 'ways.As', 'show', 'Dexter', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'plotted', 'out', 'stories', 'told', 'unfold', 'piece', 'piece', 'thus', 'building', 'suspense', 'surprise', 'when', 'new', 'twist', 'story', 'introduced', 'usually', 'jaw', 'floor', 'are', 'elements', 'everything', 'Dexter', 'stories', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'bit', 'horror', 'humor', 'usually', 'dark', 'variety', 'action', 'great', 'dialog', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'believable', 'initially', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'one-note', 'However', 'show', 'so', 'do', 'characters', 'cast', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'strong', 'not', 'bit', 'small', 'times.This', 'show', 'probably', ""n't"", 'people', 'affected', 'violence', 'strongly', 'contain', 'fairly', 'intense', 'graphic', 'stuff', 'time', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'top', 'gratuitous', 'intense', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'airwaves', 'are', 'filled', 'vacuous', 'tripe', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'WWE', 'silly', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'real', 'blessing', 'have', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'scripted', 'drama', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'dark', 'times']",Dexter: Seasons 1-3

I avoided this series because the story sounded like it had been done many times before...I couldn't have been more wrong!  I started with the first episode streaming on netflix and found it to be kinda interesting.  I had to watch the next episode, this continued through the the entire first season, where I decided to order 1-3 on Blu Ray.This is easily one of the best tv shows I've ever seen.  I would rank it better than Lost, Sopranos, and Prison Break (some of my previous all time favorites) The characters are spot on, and Michael C. Hall is absolutely fantastic, hes so quite and dark but at the same times make you laugh (especially when he makes cocky remarks in his head).  I'd have to say this show is like a combo of CSI, Law and Order, and your favorite Hollywood serial killer flick.I don't wanna ruin any story details, or twists and turns...but let me say they are all over, and each one will have your nose to the screen waiting for the outcome of each.  If you haven't seen Dexter yet, definitely pick it up and watch it, its one of those seasons you can start all over from the beginning and watch all over.Now onto the Blu Ray disc details.  As I said I started watching on streaming Netflix, which wasn't HD and only used stereo sound.  The Blu Rays are a huge step up, the 5.1 is awesome, and surrounds you in the story even more.  The picture is also very impressive bringing Miami to life.  This is important because alot of the areas used in the show include restaurants, nightclubs, and lots of outdoor scenery.  Colors are very sharp, blacks are nice and inky, and whites don't washout...for the most part.  I did find a few spots in Season 3 that got a bit pixelated in a few parts (mostly dark scenes) This however is in no way a deal breaker, and to be honest this show could be on VHS, with mono sound and still be a thrill ride that you don't want to walk away from!If you decide to start this series do yourself a favor and set away some time...your gonna need it, after the first and second episode, you wont wanna stop, this really is an A+ TV series.",5,A rollercoaster of awesomeness!!!,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,2189,"['could', 'find', 'writers', 'show', 'would', 'shake', 'hands', 'maybe', 'even', 'throw', 'hug', 'avoided', 'series', 'story', 'sounded', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'started', 'first', 'episode', 'streaming', 'netflix', 'found', 'be', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'had', 'watch', 'next', 'episode', 'continued', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'decided', 'order', '1-3', 'Blu', 'Ray.This', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'tv', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'rank', 'better', 'Lost', 'Sopranos', 'Prison', 'Break', 'previous', 'time', 'favorites', 'characters', 'are', 'spot', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'hes', 'quite', 'dark', 'same', 'times', 'make', 'especially', 'when', 'cocky', 'remarks', 'head', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'show', 'combo', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'favorite', 'Hollywood', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'ruin', 'story', 'details', 'twists', 'turns', 'let', 'say', 'are', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'nose', 'screen', 'waiting', 'outcome', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dexter', 'yet', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'one', 'seasons', 'can', 'start', 'beginning', 'watch', 'over.Now', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'details', 'said', 'started', 'watching', 'streaming', 'Netflix', 'was', ""n't"", 'HD', 'only', 'used', 'stereo', 'sound', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'are', 'huge', 'step', 'up', '5.1', 'awesome', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'picture', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'bringing', 'Miami', 'life', 'important', 'alot', 'areas', 'used', 'show', 'include', 'restaurants', 'nightclubs', 'lots', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'Colors', 'are', 'very', 'sharp', 'blacks', 'are', 'nice', 'inky', 'whites', 'do', ""n't"", 'washout', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'find', 'few', 'spots', 'Season', '3', 'got', 'bit', 'pixelated', 'few', 'parts', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'however', 'way', 'deal', 'breaker', 'be', 'honest', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'VHS', 'mono', 'sound', 'still', 'be', 'thrill', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'walk', 'away', 'decide', 'start', 'series', 'do', 'favor', 'set', 'away', 'time', 'gon', 'need', 'first', 'second', 'episode', 'wont', 'wan', 'stop', 'really', 'A+', 'TV', 'series']",Dexter: Seasons 1-3

This is a cop who goes around killing the bad guys in the most gruesome of ways and yet you can't really hate him for it; actually he's most likely cheered on. Those he kills are the bad guys; the filth of the earth; the killers, the rapists and the like.  He got married last season and has two step-kids.  Now this is not the best example of a good dad but somehow he makes it work.It is awe-inspiring to watch him weave his tales (have to work late; etc etc) and nobody has caught him yet.

Dexter is a sort of superman, batman, and superchick (I just made that one up) all in one--however, he can't fly.....to bad....that would be even more interesting.This is not a show for kids - too gory and may give them ideas but for the adults (don't be a prude) it is a ride you'll not soon forget.I'm waiting for the last series to come down to a decent price and can't wait to get my hands on it.Dexter is delicious!!Sher Holtz",5,TO LOVE A KILLER,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,1382,"['Dexter', 'show', 'other', 'cop', 'who', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'most', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'hate', 'actually', 'most', 'likely', 'cheered', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'filth', 'earth', 'killers', 'rapists', 'like', 'got', 'married', 'last', 'season', 'two', 'step-kids', 'Now', 'not', 'best', 'example', 'good', 'dad', 'somehow', 'work.It', 'awe-inspiring', 'watch', 'weave', 'tales', 'have', 'work', 'late', 'etc', 'etc', 'nobody', 'caught', 'yet', 'have', 'episodes', 'latest', 'one', 'what', 'hell', 'wrong', 'distributors', 'come', 'let', 'get', 'prices', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'Last', 'season', 'floored', 'audience', 'killing', 'someone', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'well', 'maybe', 'little.There', 'are', 'few', 'known', 'stars', 'trickle', 'show', 'bottom', 'line', 'good', 'bye', 'good', 'riddance', 'bad', 'asses', 'earth', 'Dexter', 'sort', 'superman', 'batman', 'superchick', 'just', 'made', 'one', 'up', 'one', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.This', 'not', 'show', 'kids', 'too', 'gory', 'may', 'give', 'ideas', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'prude', 'ride', ""'ll"", 'not', 'soon', 'forget.I', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'last', 'series', 'come', 'down', 'decent', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'it.Dexter', 'delicious', 'Sher', 'Holtz']",Dexter: Seasons 1-3
1257649,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0029XZODO,Sky,"[23, 27]","I finally took advantage of getting what I pay for with my cable company. Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD (Season One&Season Two). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3.So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO'sSix Feet Underfame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this ""stuff"" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from Season 1. I dare you to just try watching Season 1 and then not go for Seasons 2 and 3; I simply don't believe that anyone could possibly do that.Side note: At the time of the original writing of this review it was cheaper to buy the first three seasons on Blu Ray individually than paying the price for this package of the first three seasons, but then a few days later it was cheaper to buy this package.

I find it hard to believe that there will be a show to top it during the rest of my lifetime.  Then, throw on top of this the fact that it looks FLAWLESS in Blu-Ray format.  The macro-photography during the intro is just jaw-dropping (esp on my 46"" 1080P Samsung LED TV)!Considering the seasons are $40-50 apiece a-la-carte, you really can't argue the value you're getting with 3 seasons for under $100.

1257652,A96JD9312DHWC,B0029XZODO,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[2, 3]","Here we have the entire Dexter montage painted on a few discs. this means that we have the beauty of seasons colliding with the beauty of other seasons, showing a person what will be draining the sleep from their body for at least a week or so. Just be careful when working with the sets because, above all, sleeping is the force that lets us operate. Granted, you can go a few weeks without dying from sleep deprivation, but handling addictive thingas like Dexter with care is good for the mind.And, to the seasons:In the first season, we find ourselves introduded to the characters that will stay with us for quite some time. amongst those is our loving host, Dexter, and the wonderful slide collection he takes time and energy collecting. This seems to be the one driving force in his life until he sees something that changes everything: he is called to a crime scene and finds a body that is devoid of all blood. This makes Dexter drool and, before long, he becomes entangled in what the press is calling the Ice Trcuk Killer, actually finding himself invited to play a game with him. This leads to a lot of revelations about his past, and awakens a few things that make him wonder what Harry really was when it came to the both of them.- What a beautiful season -In the second season a certain person's body dump is found, and the FBI bring in a Special Agent by the name of Frank Lundy to look into the case. This makes Dexter feel cornered, but not as cornered as the the things that dealing with Rita's ex make him feel. she insists on a 12-step program and he finally goes, meeting a force called Lila in the process. Lila makes Dexter a promise that she will heal him, too, and he hopes everything he hears is true. along with that are troubles that involve Dokes, the man who killed his mother, control, and a sister that is climbing the ladder as she works toward that detective badge.- Feeling the world through Dexter's eyes makes you afraid in this trip to Oz/Miam1 -In the third season, things have been concluded and the butcher is done. It isn't Dexter, mind you, but things got close enough for him to evaluate his style. He also had to evaluate the things with Rita, and his decision is something that powers the third season. also powering the third season is a little thing called firendship, and moreso Dexter's need for human contact. So Dexter finds himself becoming fast friends with someone - and sharing secrets that he shouldn't be sharing. In this season Harry starts to appear to Dexter quite a bit, and this helps him out in ways he needs. There is also a new addition to the team, and a new killer that has a thing about skinning.Putting all these seasons together is a great thing and one that you would like to have. There are odds and ends on the discs that come as extras, but the main point is to have Dexter in a neat little package. Dexter would appreciate that: neat packages are his M.O.",5,Dexter Wrapped in Plastic,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2930,"['Here', 'have', 'entire', 'Dexter', 'montage', 'painted', 'few', 'discs', 'have', 'beauty', 'seasons', 'colliding', 'beauty', 'other', 'seasons', 'showing', 'person', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'draining', 'sleep', 'body', 'least', 'week', 'so', 'Just', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'working', 'sets', 'sleeping', 'force', 'operate', 'Granted', 'can', 'go', 'few', 'weeks', 'dying', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'handling', 'addictive', 'thingas', 'Dexter', 'care', 'good', 'mind.And', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'find', 'introduded', 'characters', 'will', 'stay', 'quite', 'time', 'amongst', 'loving', 'host', 'Dexter', 'wonderful', 'slide', 'collection', 'time', 'energy', 'collecting', 'be', 'one', 'driving', 'force', 'life', 'something', 'everything', 'called', 'crime', 'scene', 'body', 'devoid', 'blood', 'Dexter', 'drool', 'long', 'entangled', 'what', 'press', 'calling', 'Ice', 'Trcuk', 'Killer', 'actually', 'finding', 'invited', 'play', 'game', 'lot', 'revelations', 'past', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'Harry', 'really', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'them.-', 'What', 'beautiful', 'season', '-In', 'second', 'season', 'certain', 'person', 'body', 'dump', 'found', 'FBI', 'bring', 'Special', 'Agent', 'name', 'Frank', 'Lundy', 'look', 'case', 'Dexter', 'feel', 'cornered', 'not', 'as', 'cornered', 'things', 'dealing', 'Rita', 'ex', 'make', 'feel', '12-step', 'program', 'finally', 'meeting', 'force', 'called', 'Lila', 'process', 'Lila', 'Dexter', 'promise', 'will', 'heal', 'too', 'everything', 'true', 'are', 'troubles', 'involve', 'Dokes', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'mother', 'control', 'sister', 'climbing', 'ladder', 'detective', 'badge.-', 'Feeling', 'world', 'Dexter', 'eyes', 'afraid', 'trip', 'Oz/Miam1', '-In', 'third', 'season', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'concluded', 'butcher', 'done', ""n't"", 'Dexter', 'mind', 'things', 'got', 'close', 'enough', 'evaluate', 'style', 'also', 'had', 'evaluate', 'things', 'Rita', 'decision', 'something', 'third', 'season', 'also', 'powering', 'third', 'season', 'little', 'thing', 'called', 'firendship', 'moreso', 'Dexter', 'need', 'human', 'contact', 'So', 'Dexter', 'finds', 'becoming', 'fast', 'friends', 'someone', 'sharing', 'secrets', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'sharing', 'season', 'Harry', 'appear', 'Dexter', 'quite', 'bit', 'out', 'ways', 'also', 'new', 'addition', 'team', 'new', 'killer', 'thing', 'skinning.Putting', 'seasons', 'together', 'great', 'thing', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'are', 'odds', 'ends', 'discs', 'come', 'extras', 'main', 'point', 'have', 'Dexter', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'Dexter', 'would', 'appreciate', 'neat', 'packages', 'are', 'M.O']",Dexter: Seasons 1-3
