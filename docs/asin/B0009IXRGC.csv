This production struck a perfect balance of going from Perlman to specific players, to specific sections, to Barenboim and beyond.  The only ""bad"" shots were the ones shot from way above where they tried to capture the whole orchestra (which they did, but the lack of any detail at all was off putting).I have owned this DVD for a few weeks and watched it several times and imagine watching it dozens of more time over the years.For what it's worth, my 2 year old also loves it because it allows him to see people playing specific instruments.I recommend this DVD for everyone- especially since it contains two great concertos.  In this sense it is better than a live concert since those almost invariably include a crowd pleaser(like these) coupled with a post-modern dissonant tone poem with lots of screetching precussion.",5,Perfect - In alll ways,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,935,"['exactly', 'what', 'music', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'Beautiful', 'sound', 'crisp', 'clear', 'images', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'struck', 'perfect', 'balance', 'going', 'Perlman', 'specific', 'players', 'specific', 'sections', 'Barenboim', 'only', 'bad', 'shots', 'were', 'ones', 'shot', 'way', 'where', 'tried', 'capture', 'whole', 'orchestra', 'did', 'lack', 'detail', 'was', 'off', 'putting', 'have', 'owned', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'imagine', 'watching', 'more', 'time', 'years.For', 'what', 'worth', '2', 'year', 'old', 'also', 'see', 'people', 'playing', 'specific', 'instruments.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone-', 'especially', 'two', 'great', 'concertos', 'sense', 'better', 'live', 'concert', 'almost', 'invariably', 'include', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'coupled', 'post-modern', 'dissonant', 'tone', 'poem', 'lots', 'screetching', 'precussion']",Beethoven/Brahms: Violin Concerto

906443,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B0009IXRGC,David M. Goldberg,"[3, 6]","All but one of the previous 14 reviewers have given this DVD 5-stars. In my opinion, the lone exception is nearer the mark. I have no idea how so many persons can reach such an evaluation, but here is the justification offered by one: &#8220;The performance itself was nothing to rave about, not exciting, but it was well played&#8221;. While agreeing with his verbal assessment, I wonder how he would score an exciting performance that was worth raving about? By any standard, these are good performances of two of the towering masterpieces of their genre, but they are not exceptional. Perlman is an accomplished player. He has an awesome technical ability, sound musicianship, and a sensitively sweet tone that can melt the heart, and is best suited to the lighter concertos, and to the sonata form and chamber ensemble music in which he excels. What he does not have is the sheer power and brutality that is necessary in a violinist who is going to take on the Berlin Philharmonic, and this is especially evident in the Brahms concerto. Paradoxically, although the Beethoven concerto is more suited to his refined and reticent approach to music in general, his performance is spoiled by an excess of gentile sweetness. The great Ludwig Van had many virtues and some vices, but never could he be praised for his sweetness or gentility. He was a raging spiritual torrent of creativity, which is why he was the favourite of Alex --- villainous hero of A Clockwork Orange. Many of my Jewish friends are enraptured by Pearlman, and I think it is the &#8220;schmaltz&#8221; they enjoy most of all. This is something of which Daniel Barenboim cannot be accused. If anything, he is the archtypical &#8220; Sourpuss&#8221;, with never a glint or a smile, waving his baton and keeping his emotions buttoned up as he moves the music along. It is an unusually stern, authoritarian and Germanic style he brings to these performances, but it works. The orchestra plays superbly; the woodwind sings like a flock of birds, and the brass intone with a mellow golden sound. At the same time, he shows every consideration for the lone soloist aligned against his forces.Camera work and sound are satisfactory, but not exceptional. It was interesting to see the BPO in the older conventional Schauspielhaus rather than in the more contemporary Philharmonie. The DTS audio setting rather than Stereo is the way to go. The price is more than fair and the thin leaflet that comes with the disc provides useful information. But for a DVD of the Beethoven that will make you sit up with the force and majesty of the performance, try the less-than-ten-dollar version by Anne-Sophie Mutter and the same orchestra under Karajan.",4,Sweet and sour,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,2704,"['one', 'previous', '14', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', '5-stars', 'opinion', 'lone', 'exception', 'mark', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'persons', 'can', 'reach', 'such', 'evaluation', 'here', 'justification', 'offered', 'one', '8220', 'performance', 'was', 'nothing', 'rave', 'about', 'not', 'exciting', 'was', 'well', 'played', '8221', 'agreeing', 'verbal', 'assessment', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'score', 'exciting', 'performance', 'was', 'worth', 'raving', 'standard', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'two', 'towering', 'masterpieces', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Perlman', 'accomplished', 'player', 'awesome', 'technical', 'ability', 'sound', 'musicianship', 'sensitively', 'sweet', 'tone', 'can', 'melt', 'heart', 'best', 'suited', 'lighter', 'concertos', 'sonata', 'form', 'chamber', 'ensemble', 'music', 'What', 'not', 'have', 'sheer', 'power', 'brutality', 'necessary', 'violinist', 'who', 'going', 'take', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'especially', 'evident', 'Brahms', 'concerto', 'Paradoxically', 'Beethoven', 'concerto', 'more', 'suited', 'refined', 'reticent', 'approach', 'music', 'general', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'excess', 'gentile', 'sweetness', 'great', 'Ludwig', 'Van', 'had', 'many', 'virtues', 'vices', 'never', 'could', 'be', 'praised', 'sweetness', 'gentility', 'was', 'raging', 'spiritual', 'torrent', 'creativity', 'why', 'was', 'favourite', 'Alex', 'villainous', 'hero', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Many', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'are', 'enraptured', 'Pearlman', 'think', '8220', '8221', 'enjoy', 'most', 'something', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accused', 'anything', 'archtypical', '8220', 'Sourpuss', '8221', 'never', 'glint', 'smile', 'waving', 'baton', 'keeping', 'emotions', 'buttoned', 'up', 'music', 'unusually', 'stern', 'authoritarian', 'Germanic', 'style', 'performances', 'orchestra', 'plays', 'superbly', 'woodwind', 'sings', 'flock', 'birds', 'brass', 'intone', 'mellow', 'golden', 'sound', 'same', 'time', 'consideration', 'lone', 'soloist', 'aligned', 'forces.Camera', 'work', 'sound', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'exceptional', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'BPO', 'older', 'conventional', 'Schauspielhaus', 'rather', 'more', 'contemporary', 'Philharmonie', 'DTS', 'audio', 'setting', 'rather', 'Stereo', 'way', 'go', 'price', 'more', 'fair', 'thin', 'leaflet', 'disc', 'useful', 'information', 'DVD', 'Beethoven', 'will', 'make', 'sit', 'up', 'force', 'majesty', 'performance', 'try', 'less-than-ten-dollar', 'version', 'Anne-Sophie', 'Mutter', 'same', 'orchestra', 'Karajan']",Beethoven/Brahms: Violin Concerto

Still it haunts me.  Anyway.  I bought this DVD because I really wanted to watch Perlman playing.  His violin was shiny and beautiful and new.  He plays well, of course I knew that.  Also I knew the 2 warhorses he was playing.  No surprises there.  So on to other things.  I was told by my violin teacher many years ago that he does something odd with his left index finger or thumb or something.  I didn't see it.  Also, contradictory to his very handsome photos, he grimaces when he plays.  I found this disturbing.  Surely it isn't affectation, yet I didn't notice any of the violinists in the orchestra do it.  He smiled his charming, ingratiating smile when he took his bows, but his face when he walked off stage (every time) looked very grim and sad.  That hurt me.  The show must go on, I suppose.  But it made me sad to think that my beloved Itzhak Perlman could feel so unhappy, particularly when he smiled his usual smile during his bows and played with his usual brilliance.  Perlman was my favorite violinist for 25 years, yup, on LPs.  Now (sigh, am I fickle?), I like Heifetz better.  But I still love Perlman.

906449,A3UC3JEGFDVGM8,B0009IXRGC,Paco Yez,"[31, 31]","I know this two concerts since a long time ago, from the time when I played violin when I was a child, and I'm still in love with them, a long relation that grows every time I listen and understand deeper this wonderful scores.After having some other versions of the works I finally bought, in the `90s the Beethoven & Brahms concertos played by Perlman & Berlin & Barenboim (EMI), the couple I think give the best for this two masterworks. Brahms version I had on CD (EMI 7 54580 2; released too in mid price: 5 62598 2) is the same you can watch and listen now in this wonderful live DVD from the Schauspielhaus in Berlin, recorded in 1992. Beethoven's Concerto is a different version than the CD I had, EMI 7 49567 2, which was recorded live in Berlin, but in the Philharmonie a year before. Both performances are wonderful but I have to say I prefer a bit more the CD one from the Philharmonie.So, what we have here is an outstanding DVD, one of the better I know in classical music. It use to happen we have on DVD some concerts not very good and finding this level of excellence is something really grateful for all those who love this music. From the technical point of view, the realization is very correct, modern and well done, with lot of good takes of Perlman's playing and some good medium and general takes of the orchestra and the scene.The performances are so great as we know from the CDs, based on a very idiomatic versions, in really german style. I've listened lot of versions of this two concerts played by some outstanding violinist and conductors, but no one with the inspiration and technical precision of this EMI recording, developed with a great germanic taste in the way they play this music.It's very well known Daniel Barenboim's affinity with the music of the genius from Bonn and you can listen it very clearly in this live-recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker, in my opinion the most beethovenian orchestra in the world, much more than the Wiener, because of the very german sound the berliners have, a very complex concept to explain but very easy to recognize if you are used to listed some compared versions between the most strong, deep, dense and male Berliner Philharmoniker, and the most clear, opened, crystal-built, and female sound of the Wiener; a difference that was appointed by many artists in different areas of arts and philosophy.So, what we have here is a high performance, from the technical point of view and from the sense of the performance, a really beethovenian-language version, built up with the conviction and the strong stream Barenboim creates with the orchestral sound. Perlman gives his best in one of his top performances, in my opinion better than the recording with Carlo Maria Giulini for EMI label too. As I wrote before, I prefer a bit more CD release with the two romances, but this is outstanding too.In the case of Brahms's Concerto I have to say that I prefer a little more Perlman & Giulini's version released by EMI on CD (Mid price No. 5 66992 2), a studio recording wonderfully performed. This one on DVD is a bit more european in the way the berliners play, and in the more german way Barenboim conducts, based on the own Beethoven's Concerto as the origin of the late romantic Violin Concertos.The sound it's not bad at all. Of course it's not the best DDD recording I've listened, but it can be enjoyable with a good Hi-Fi system. It's well known that EMI recordings use to be poor sometimes, specially in live-recordings, but this is correct enough. The image is great. I use to watch it in a Philips Pixel Plus 2, which improve the image very much, but I think it could be good enough in any TV.The final conclusion is this is a DVD for not mi missed, a jewel to be enjoyed with your eyes and with your ears.",5,One of the best DVDs of classical music.,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,3797,"['know', 'two', 'concerts', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'time', 'when', 'played', 'violin', 'when', 'was', 'child', ""'m"", 'still', 'love', 'long', 'relation', 'time', 'listen', 'understand', 'deeper', 'wonderful', 'scores.After', 'having', 'other', 'versions', 'works', 'finally', 'bought', '90s', 'Beethoven', 'Brahms', 'concertos', 'played', 'Perlman', 'Berlin', 'Barenboim', 'EMI', 'couple', 'think', 'give', 'best', 'two', 'masterworks', 'Brahms', 'version', 'had', 'CD', 'EMI', '7', '54580', '2', 'released', 'too', 'mid', 'price', '5', '62598', '2', 'same', 'can', 'watch', 'listen', 'now', 'wonderful', 'live', 'DVD', 'Schauspielhaus', 'Berlin', 'recorded', '1992', 'Beethoven', 'Concerto', 'different', 'version', 'CD', 'had', 'EMI', '7', '49567', '2', 'was', 'recorded', 'live', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonie', 'year', 'before', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'have', 'say', 'prefer', 'bit', 'more', 'CD', 'one', 'Philharmonie.So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'one', 'better', 'know', 'classical', 'music', 'use', 'happen', 'have', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'finding', 'level', 'excellence', 'something', 'really', 'grateful', 'who', 'love', 'music', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'realization', 'very', 'correct', 'modern', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'good', 'Perlman', 'playing', 'good', 'medium', 'general', 'orchestra', 'scene.The', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'know', 'CDs', 'based', 'very', 'idiomatic', 'versions', 'really', 'german', 'style', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'lot', 'versions', 'two', 'concerts', 'played', 'outstanding', 'violinist', 'conductors', 'one', 'inspiration', 'technical', 'precision', 'EMI', 'recording', 'developed', 'great', 'germanic', 'taste', 'way', 'play', 'music.It', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'affinity', 'music', 'genius', 'Bonn', 'can', 'listen', 'very', 'clearly', 'live-recording', 'Berliner', 'Philharmoniker', 'opinion', 'most', 'beethovenian', 'orchestra', 'world', 'much', 'more', 'Wiener', 'very', 'german', 'sound', 'berliners', 'have', 'very', 'complex', 'concept', 'explain', 'very', 'easy', 'recognize', 'are', 'used', 'listed', 'compared', 'versions', 'most', 'strong', 'deep', 'dense', 'male', 'Berliner', 'Philharmoniker', 'most', 'clear', 'opened', 'crystal-built', 'female', 'sound', 'Wiener', 'difference', 'was', 'appointed', 'many', 'artists', 'different', 'areas', 'arts', 'philosophy.So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'high', 'performance', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'sense', 'performance', 'really', 'beethovenian-language', 'version', 'built', 'up', 'conviction', 'strong', 'stream', 'Barenboim', 'orchestral', 'sound', 'Perlman', 'best', 'one', 'top', 'performances', 'opinion', 'better', 'recording', 'Carlo', 'Maria', 'Giulini', 'EMI', 'label', 'too', 'wrote', 'prefer', 'bit', 'more', 'CD', 'release', 'two', 'romances', 'outstanding', 'case', 'Brahms', 'Concerto', 'have', 'say', 'prefer', 'little', 'more', 'Perlman', 'Giulini', 'version', 'released', 'EMI', 'CD', 'Mid', 'price', 'No', '5', '66992', '2', 'studio', 'recording', 'wonderfully', 'performed', 'one', 'DVD', 'bit', 'more', 'european', 'way', 'berliners', 'play', 'more', 'german', 'way', 'Barenboim', 'based', 'own', 'Beethoven', 'Concerto', 'origin', 'late', 'romantic', 'Violin', 'Concertos.The', 'sound', 'not', 'bad', 'course', 'not', 'best', 'DDD', 'recording', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'Hi-Fi', 'system', 'well', 'known', 'EMI', 'recordings', 'use', 'be', 'poor', 'sometimes', 'specially', 'live-recordings', 'correct', 'enough', 'image', 'great', 'use', 'watch', 'Philips', 'Pixel', 'Plus', '2', 'improve', 'image', 'very', 'much', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'TV.The', 'final', 'conclusion', 'DVD', 'not', 'mi', 'missed', 'jewel', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'eyes', 'ears']",Beethoven/Brahms: Violin Concerto
906450,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B0009IXRGC,R. Nicholson,"[66, 67]","A fabulous DVD!This disc features Itzhak Perlman* playing two of the worlds most famous violin concertos. ( Beethoven and Brahms). They have been recorded in 1992 at the Schauspielhaus in Berlin with Daniel Barenboim conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.There are so many things to like about this DVD... to mention a few-the audio is simply superb. I'm fortunate enough to have a fairly good sound system and I must say that the audio on this DVD is by far the best I've heard when playing either of these two concertos. The basses are deep and rich and the orchestral passages have a real sense of presence and fullness. Obviously, the acoustics of the theater, along with the sound engineering has resulted in a superior product.-the video was generally well done; the lighting, camera angles and switching were performed, with a couple of minor exceptions, with skillful timing and good effect.-the Beethoven is played with smoothness and grace; the grandeur of the opening bars has always been one of my favorite musical passages. The cadenza is played with skill and technique that Mr. Perlman has become famous for.-the Brahms, to me, is the best I've ever heard and it is different, wonderfully different. The first movement, at times, is played with a sense of primordial passion and well....almost aggression by Mr. Perlman. The notes are seemingly ripped off the instrument with sense of urgency and power. The second movement is the antithesis of the first, played with a quiet sensitivity and beauty that would allow you to hear a pin drop in the audience during one of the brief lulls in the music. The third movement showed unabridged joy and happiness as it pulsed on toward its conclusion.The only niggling feature (from a strictly video point of view) on the entire DVD was perhaps Daniel Barenboim's conducting style; he appeared very stiff on the podium, almost marionette-like at times.All in all, an opportunity to add another masterpiece to one's classical library.
