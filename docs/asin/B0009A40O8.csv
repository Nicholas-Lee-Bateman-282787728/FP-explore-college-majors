The film is a hilarious combination of slapstick comedy and serious social commentary. Domestic abuse is one of the storylines in the films.  Within this storyline, viewers are introduced to some of Medea's kin people who have paid the ultimate price to elevate their social and economic status.  In an effort to provide her kids with the plush comforts of life, Medea's niece sacrifices the love of a daughter and the connection to her extended family.  The downcast daughter internalizes the mistreatment from her mother and develops a protective shield around her heart that nearly causes her the love of the one man who could truly make a difference in her life.  The mistreated and downcast daughter plays opposite of her dearly loved and pampered sister.  Having received all of the material things in life that she's ever wanted, the pampered sister is engaged to a wealthy investment banker who insists on control and domination at all times.  Both sisters survive their past and present with the advice and direction of Medea whose old school approach to love and family always pulls everyone together.This comedy/drama is an extremely enjoyable escape.  The film is packed with high profile stars including Maya Angelou and Cicley Tyson and graced with some of the most popular (and sexy) African American movie stars at work today.  The films culminates at the family reunion where the elders, appalled by the lifestyle and behaviors of the family's youth, dispense the wisdom and guidance that will hopefully put the family back on course.  Typical of Perry's works, the films spoofs well known African American films and figures.  Didactic and often preachy, the film is quite entertaining and reflects, in jest, many serious issues affecting American culture in general and African Americans in particular.  Well worth the viewing.

Blaire Underwood was stunning on ""The Tyra Banks Show"" when he mentioned how fine his wife was and very cute on this movie as well. The character he played seemed so different from his usual demeanor, so I felt he played the most remarkable role.  The new lady who played the wife-to-be is such a pretty woman and a great actress. I wish her the best of luck in her next movie.  Ofcourse Boris Kodjoe was charming and Tyler Perry was debonair, as usual.There were the usual funny scenes like the family reunion, the older women preaching on young folks and good love, the dirty old men with crass humor, and Tyler Perry as both Madea and the Dirty Old Man.
