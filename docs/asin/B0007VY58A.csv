891941,A3UPDQ8750BVAE,B0007VY58A,Christine,"[1, 2]",I wasn't going to finish watching this movie because I thought it would be boring and it was. The story line was not very good. The idea that this man and his 12 yr. old daughter were traveling all over the United States and Mexico looking for work was unreal. The police never caught up with him to find out why the girl wasn't in school or had an address always kept me wondering. The movie also started with the guy and his daughter driving Lord knows where. There was no real beginning or end.,2,Boring,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,497,"['was', ""n't"", 'going', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'was', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'man', '12', 'yr.', 'old', 'daughter', 'were', 'traveling', 'United', 'States', 'Mexico', 'looking', 'work', 'was', 'unreal', 'police', 'never', 'caught', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'girl', 'was', ""n't"", 'school', 'had', 'address', 'always', 'kept', 'wondering', 'movie', 'also', 'started', 'guy', 'daughter', 'driving', 'Lord', 'where', 'was', 'real', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

891946,A1QIGFZMTDF1XW,B0007VY58A,"PZio ""Pasha Zio Satara""","[1, 2]","This movie is superbly filmed in one of my favorite places - Baja, Mexico. The acting is honest, understated, and never over-the-top. It's easy to identify with the characters. These are people who don't always mold to society's demands, yet they love fiercely and have a strong sense of morality that makes them vulnerable and appealing. The coyotes in the film are there for several reasons. There is a lot of symbolism in the movie. This film takes you in and wraps its arms around you and doesn't let go until long after the last credit rolls. I cried; ""Coyotes"" broke my heart.",5,This should be a timeless classic...,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,582,"['movie', 'superbly', 'filmed', 'one', 'favorite', 'places', 'Baja', 'Mexico', 'acting', 'honest', 'understated', 'never', 'over-the-top', 'easy', 'identify', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'mold', 'society', 'demands', 'yet', 'love', 'fiercely', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'morality', 'vulnerable', 'appealing', 'coyotes', 'film', 'are', 'there', 'several', 'reasons', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'film', 'wraps', 'arms', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'long', 'last', 'credit', 'rolls', 'cried', 'Coyotes', 'broke', 'heart']",N/A
