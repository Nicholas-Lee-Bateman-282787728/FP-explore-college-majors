1432291,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B004XJ4QIQ,Anne-Marie G,"[2, 3]","Note: This is a review for the drama and not this DVD set.This show for me, just sort of bottles the giddiness of a first love.Oh Ha Ni has gone to high school for the last four years with her pretty but super brilliant crush, Baek Seun Jo. To to a freak earthquake she had her father end up moving into Seung Jo's house (both fathers are old friends, who only have rediscovered each other).  Unfortunately for Ha Ni this happens right after she has given Seung Jo a letter of confession which leads to public humiliation on her part (the boy grades it and it ends up  being read out loud by a mean girl who also finds Seung Jo attractive).  It is very clearly a case of opposites attracting. Oh Ha Ni is bubbly, optimistic and very friendly--also the worst student in the school.  Seung Jo is emotionally stunted, distant and good at everything he does (except for human interaction--his mother, thru the entire series is saying what a bad personality he has).Of course, their having to live together allows both of them to see the other in a different light. Ha Ni's nickname is 'Noah's Snail' because while she can't do anything really well, if she sticks to something long enough she will eventually succeed.  Seung Jo is able to admire her determination, it is something he has never had to do, he never has to try for anything.  At the same time Ha Ni begins to understand why Seung Jo has such an emotional wall built up and slowly works her charm on him, like the snail that she is.It is a bubbly and frothy drama, pretty light on the intense emotional stakes. Oh Ha Ni is so adorable, and watching Seung Jo's icey self melt into someone who cares for her is really fun to watch.  This is one of the few dramas so far that I have gone back to again again. It has so many great scenes.  It also has by far, one of the best supporting cast of characters I have seen.  Bong Joon Gu is a great second lead male character, like most of the characters he is painted with really broad, comedic strokes at first and as the drama continues more subtle details about his character are layered on. Seung Jo's mom steals the show in every scene that she is in. (This probably has the best set of parents in any K-Drama I have seen, too.  They actively take interest in their children's lives and are always trying to do what is best for the kids, not themselves. You can really feel their concern and love.)So plot isn't the strongest point in this drama, I'm okay with this. The characters are so adorable and they all have pretty well thought out arcs that make sense and are very consistently portrayed. I started watching this drama because of how much I loved Kim Hyun Joong as Ji Hoo inBoys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles).  He didn't really disappoint me in this. I can see his growth as an actor between one and the next (I also think the writing and character direction were a bit stronger in this show, so that helped).  Both characters are quieter than most around them, so there is an acceptable degree of stoicism which also allows him to be a great foil for the emotive characters he shares scenes with.I also love how each episode ends with a little teddy bear reenactment of a pivotal scene from that episode (a laPalace).Just writing this review makes me want to go back and rewatch my favorite scenes.",5,"I can't help myself, I just love this",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3356,"['Note', 'review', 'drama', 'not', 'show', 'just', 'sort', 'bottles', 'giddiness', 'first', 'love.Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'gone', 'high', 'school', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'pretty', 'super', 'brilliant', 'crush', 'Baek', 'Seun', 'Jo', 'freak', 'earthquake', 'had', 'father', 'end', 'up', 'moving', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'house', 'fathers', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'only', 'have', 'rediscovered', 'other', 'Unfortunately', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'right', 'given', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'letter', 'confession', 'public', 'humiliation', 'part', 'boy', 'up', 'being', 'read', 'out', 'loud', 'mean', 'girl', 'who', 'also', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'attractive', 'very', 'clearly', 'case', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'bubbly', 'optimistic', 'very', 'friendly', 'also', 'worst', 'student', 'school', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'distant', 'good', 'everything', 'human', 'interaction', 'mother', 'thru', 'entire', 'series', 'saying', 'what', 'bad', 'personality', '.Of', 'course', 'having', 'live', 'together', 'see', 'other', 'different', 'light', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'nickname', 'Snail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'well', 'something', 'long', 'enough', 'will', 'eventually', 'succeed', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'able', 'admire', 'determination', 'something', 'never', 'had', 'do', 'never', 'try', 'anything', 'same', 'time', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'understand', 'why', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'such', 'emotional', 'wall', 'built', 'up', 'slowly', 'charm', 'snail', 'bubbly', 'frothy', 'drama', 'pretty', 'light', 'intense', 'emotional', 'stakes', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'so', 'adorable', 'watching', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'icey', 'self', 'melt', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'few', 'dramas', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'also', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'Bong', 'Joon', 'Gu', 'great', 'second', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'most', 'characters', 'painted', 'really', 'broad', 'comedic', 'strokes', 'first', 'drama', 'more', 'subtle', 'details', 'character', 'are', 'layered', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'mom', 'show', 'scene', 'probably', 'best', 'set', 'parents', 'K-Drama', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'actively', 'take', 'interest', 'children', 'lives', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'kids', 'not', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'concern', 'love', 'plot', ""n't"", 'strongest', 'point', 'drama', ""'m"", 'okay', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'adorable', 'have', 'pretty', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'very', 'consistently', 'portrayed', 'started', 'watching', 'drama', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'Kim', 'Hyun', 'Joong', 'Ji', 'Hoo', 'Flowers', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'Complete', 'Set', '8', 'DVDs', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'disappoint', 'can', 'see', 'growth', 'actor', 'one', 'next', 'also', 'think', 'writing', 'character', 'direction', 'were', 'bit', 'stronger', 'show', 'helped', 'characters', 'are', 'quieter', 'most', 'so', 'acceptable', 'degree', 'stoicism', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'foil', 'emotive', 'characters', 'shares', 'with.I', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'episode', 'little', 'teddy', 'bear', 'reenactment', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'episode', 'laPalace', '.Just', 'writing', 'review', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'rewatch', 'favorite', 'scenes']",Mischievous Kiss

The subtitles were a little questionable with letters crossed out instead of erased and some of the translation needs further interpretation like instead of telling her to do nothing she should be still? But the actors are so animated you almost don't even need the subtitles. These Koreans can really act! Episode one was a little out there but everyone was hooked by episode two.

1432298,A57UZXTQU9DJE,B004XJ4QIQ,Supernatural Rocks,"[2, 2]","Based on the popular Japanese comic Itazura na Kiss is an adorable Korean TV drama series that follows in the footsteps of hits like Boys Over Flowers.  Spunky high school student Hani isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  In fact, she is in the worst class at her school (the vice principal refers to her class as cancer cells bringing them down).  However, thou she lacks brains; she is true to her heart.  Her problem is that she is head over heels in love with her school's top student, the handsome genius Seungjo (played by cutie Kim Hyun Joong from Boys Over Flowers and boyband SS501). Hani finally gathers up the courage to confess her love in a love letter to Seungjo, but he coldly rejects her and embarrasses her in front of the whole school.  He even goes as far as editing the love letter and grading it with a D minus.  And if that wasn't enough, a string of unfortunate events forces Hani and her father to move in with her father's old childhood friend - who is none other than Seungjo's father! Hani does what she can to win her dream boy over and break through his cold shell.  I didn't love this drama but I did like it.  What was hard for me is that Hani is so weak.  She constantly stalks Seungio to the point where you want to yell at her yourself.  Maybe it's because I've seen K-Dramas were the girls always stood up for themselves and fought back (like Jandi in Boys Over Flowers and Eun-sung from Brilliant Legacy) that made this one a little hard to truly enjoy.  I wanted Hani to stop obsessing over Seungio and make him want her but he is the constant center of her universe throughout the series. I did like the guy who played the Korean Elvis type.  He was hilarious.  And you will ADORE Seungio's mother.  She is so sweet to Hani and tries desperately to get the two together.  I loved how devoted she was to Hani.  And I LOVED Kim Hyun Joong.  He played the cold, arrogant, genius Seungio perfectly.  It's a fun drama to watch but don't expect it to thrill you like other K-Dramas.This review is for the YA Entertainment Studio Version of the Korean Series Mischievous Kiss.
