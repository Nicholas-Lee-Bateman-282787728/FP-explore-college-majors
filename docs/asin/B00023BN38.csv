Apparently this was a common practice back then. Mike Pinder and Tony Clarke (the Moodies' producer and the man who oversaw the overdubbing) confirmed this at Pinder's web site, One Step, shortly after it was released in 2004. It's obvious too; I mean you can't hide the fact that keyboardist Pinder was playing a Hammond organ as opposed to a mellotron here.Nevertheless, it's immensely pleasurable to see a twenty-something Hayward, Lodge, Pinder, Thomas and Edge performing ""Lovely To See You"", ""Tuesday Afternoon"", ""Nights In White Satin"". ""Ride My See-Saw"", ""Legend Of A Mind"", ""Lazy Day"", ""Never Comes The Day"", ""Are You Sitting Comfortably"", ""Gypsy"", ""Candle Of Life"", Tortoise & The Hare"", ""Don't You Feel Small"" and ""Question"". Although some of the tracks are definitely a direct lift from their albums, the DVD is worth owning.The guys appear laid back, talking, smoking and drinking between tracks on and off stage. And they do certainly look at ease and enjoying themselves, more so than they seemed in their 1992 Red Rocks concert. You get the feeling this is how it all really started out for them, playing before a small audience in a tavern.For die-hard fans of the Moody Blues, ""The Lost Performance Live in Paris 1970"" is a must-have collectible, especially since it's probably the only film footage showing the 1966-1978 Moodies line-up at their peak. However, should one want to hear a raw performance of the Moodies from this period, listen to the Albert Hall concert from the albumCaught Live + 5.",4,Rare performance of Mk.

I guess it is pointless to blame the French on everything. The camera angles are horrible. Sixty percent of the views are backs, rear-end shots and scans behind amplifiers. Even a few of the songs beginnings and main focal melodies are shot with the cameras behind the artists, its an embarrassment of French filming altogether and is a confirmation never to use French in filmmaking.The band lipsynchs and it is obvious none of the instruments are actually plugged in, especially with the drummer tapping throughout the complete performance.If you would just like to ""see"" the Moody Blues during this era and learn about HOW TO NOT FILM A FAKED PERFORMANCE, this is the DVD for you, but if you expect a live and enjoyable performance of ""Knights In White Satin"", or ""Questions"", you may as well watch it from one of the archives of a TV show from that time.",2,Disappointing,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,974,"['First', 'am', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'whom', 'are', 'musicians', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'guess', 'pointless', 'blame', 'French', 'everything', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'horrible', 'Sixty', 'percent', 'views', 'are', 'backs', 'rear-end', 'shots', 'scans', 'amplifiers', 'Even', 'few', 'songs', 'beginnings', 'main', 'focal', 'melodies', 'are', 'shot', 'cameras', 'artists', 'embarrassment', 'French', 'filming', 'altogether', 'confirmation', 'never', 'use', 'French', 'filmmaking.The', 'band', 'lipsynchs', 'obvious', 'none', 'instruments', 'are', 'actually', 'plugged', 'especially', 'drummer', 'tapping', 'complete', 'performance.If', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'see', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'era', 'learn', 'HOW', 'TO', 'NOT', 'FILM', 'A', 'FAKED', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DVD', 'expect', 'live', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'Knights', 'White', 'Satin', 'Questions', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'one', 'archives', 'TV', 'show', 'time']",N/A

I never saw them in concert until March 2008.  For me, this is a treat.  Also, overdubbing was done a lot in those days.  I expect it.  It is still interesting to hear them sing live.  I always wondered how they harmonized.  It is also interesting to see how they treat each other's songs.  They look so cool.  The price is right for what it is.  If you don't know much about the Moody Blues, you can check them out on lots of YouTube clips.  I sampled clips from this DVD and decided I wanted a copy for my library. I really liked The Moody Blues: Legend of a Band and another history DVD The Moody Blues which give the full story and show them through the years and more recently telling what I found to be a really inspiring story of some young men who really loved music, passionately believed in what they wanted to do and have been letting that drive their success through generations of change.",3,Dubbed but should not be forgotten by Moodies fans - others might want to check out other Moody Blues DVDs,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,1010,"['love', 'Moodies', 'flipped', 'switch', 'long', 'ago', 'about', 'when', 'television', 'performance', 'happened', 'never', 'saw', 'concert', 'March', '2008', 'treat', 'Also', 'overdubbing', 'was', 'done', 'lot', 'days', 'expect', 'still', 'interesting', 'hear', 'sing', 'live', 'always', 'wondered', 'how', 'harmonized', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'treat', 'other', 'songs', 'look', 'so', 'cool', 'price', 'right', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'lots', 'YouTube', 'clips', 'sampled', 'clips', 'DVD', 'decided', 'wanted', 'copy', 'library', 'really', 'liked', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'Legend', 'Band', 'history', 'DVD', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'give', 'full', 'story', 'show', 'years', 'more', 'recently', 'telling', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'inspiring', 'story', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'music', 'passionately', 'believed', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'have', 'been', 'letting', 'drive', 'success', 'generations', 'change']",N/A

With The Moody Blues on stage in this concert video, and overlaying them with studio recorded versions of their songs is an awfully tacky and deceiving way to market this product.  There are much better Moody Blues Concert videos out there. Instead, check out The Moody Blues at The Isle of Wight concert from 1970 which presents the group in raw and live concert form.  In my opinion, their best concert of recent vintage is their Red Rocks concert from 1992. The ""Lovely To See You"" concert video from 2005 is more recent vintage, and is pretty good too.

Honest live performances were not invented in the 21st century, and in fact predate recording equipment by many centuries.  I have many performances on DVDs from the same era that are truly live.  Sure a lot of TV shows used to do (and still do) Milli Vanilli style lip-sync.  But that does not excuse DVD manufacturers from misrepresenting media content!On the good side there are a couple of songs where Justin Hayward seems to be actually singing, along with the backing of the original studio track.

Although I ended up paying a little more I got it autographed by him. Anyway, I really enjoyed the concert. It's in an intimate club setting in Paris. You actually get to see the band members walking up to the stage. This is kind of similar to the CAUGHT LIVE album in the sense that Mike and Ray introduce all the songs. As far as the songs they chose to play there are none sung by Mike Pinder and there are no poems by Grame Edge. They open up with ""Lovely To See You"" which is also the first song on ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM. Mike announces that they are going to play ""Question"" which will be released as a single in 2 weeks. The audio doesn't really seem to be on the same track as the visual or there's some problem. There were a couple times where I'd hear the flute but Ray wasn't playing it yet. What's up with that? Whats great about the concert is that the band looks very enthusiastic and they're having a good time. It's interesting to see Pinder adjusting the nobs on his mellotron especially before the orchestral ta-da! on ""Question."" It does look like your typical video performance from that time where you can't really tell if they're actually playing or lip syncing.
