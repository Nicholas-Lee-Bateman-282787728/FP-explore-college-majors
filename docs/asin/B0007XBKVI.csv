However, we found the script/dialogue too simplistic or unreal and the acting effort too obvious in some of the scenes. I would buy it again because I liked ""The Waltons""  TV series and other stories I have seen of that era. I am buying all of the series because I still want to see how the characters progress even though the dialogue and acting fails to completely convince me at times.",4,Awake One,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,503,"['love', 'era', 'story', 'line', 'depression', 'family', 'coping', 'setting', 'views', 'beautiful/nostalgic', 'scenes', 'However', 'found', 'script/dialogue', 'too', 'simplistic', 'unreal', 'acting', 'effort', 'too', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'would', 'buy', 'again', 'liked', 'Waltons', 'TV', 'series', 'other', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'era', 'am', 'buying', 'series', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'progress', 'even', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'fails', 'completely', 'convince', 'times']",Wind at My Back: Season 1

The reason for my selecting this particular series was that it was produced by the the same producer of Anne Of Green Gables which I absolutely LOVED!!! I did not find that it lived up to that expectation but my family and I are coming to enjoy it. The very first episode was a lot to digest in that there were a lot of hardships all compounded in the very first one!,3,Wind at My Back review,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,533,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'family', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together', 'do', 'find', 'be', 'appropriate', 'entertaing', 'being', 'inappropriately', 'provokative', 'reason', 'selecting', 'particular', 'series', 'was', 'was', 'produced', 'same', 'producer', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'lived', 'up', 'expectation', 'family', 'are', 'coming', 'enjoy', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'lot', 'digest', 'were', 'lot', 'hardships', 'compounded', 'very', 'first', 'one']",Wind at My Back: Season 1

893246,A2M8OE1V6DOD3Y,B0007XBKVI,"David R. Seid ""drseid""","[85, 85]","Wind At My Back originally began airing on Canadian TV about 10 years ago.  I first saw the series when I was living in Buffalo while an undergrad at the University there (as I could get both US and Canadian TV)...  When I heard the show was created by the same team that brought Anne of Green Gables to the small screen, I figured it could not be *too* bad, so I gave it a try...To cut to the chase, it definately wasn't ""too bad"" at all... In fact, it was absolutely brilliant!  I soon found myself pushing aside all my US (and Canadian) favorites, making sure I watched every episode week in, week out.The show takes place during the Depression in Canada in the early 1900s...  The Bailey family happily runs a convenience store in a small town, but soon gets swept into the hard-times others are suffering around them, and has to make do after a series of tragic events occur.Due to these events, the family heads to the mining town of New Bedford, where they meet up with the town's matriarch -- May Bailey.  May is a subborn, hard woman who has never even met her grand-children, and was against her estranged son marrying Honey (the family's mother).  Now the family must depend on May for its daily survival or starve to death (and May, not being the forgiving type does not make it easy).The show can run the emotional gammot from tear-jerker to hilarious to heartwarming-inspirational.  It is that brilliant range mixed in with brutal realism that makes it such a pleasure to watch.Also making the show a pleasure to watch is the fabulous overall cast.  Every one of the characters is well-developed, and superbly acted.  The standount of the show is definitely Shirley Douglass as May Bailey though.  Every scene she is in is absolute magic, going from the heartless grandother and business person one minute, to a person with real feelings and pain the next...  Great stuff all-around.Needless to say, I think Wind At My Back is a must watch series, and one of the best ever created.  If you or your kids like to watch well-acted realistic family dramas which don't hold anything back, then this series is for you.",5,My Favorite Family TV Series of All-Time,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,2126,"['Wind', 'My', 'Back', 'originally', 'began', 'airing', 'Canadian', 'TV', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'living', 'Buffalo', 'undergrad', 'University', 'there', 'could', 'get', 'US', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'When', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'same', 'team', 'brought', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'small', 'screen', 'figured', 'could', 'not', 'be', '*too*', 'bad', 'gave', 'try', 'cut', 'chase', 'definately', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'fact', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'soon', 'found', 'pushing', 'aside', 'US', 'Canadian', 'making', 'sure', 'watched', 'episode', 'week', 'week', 'out.The', 'show', 'place', 'Depression', 'Canada', 'early', '1900s', 'Bailey', 'family', 'happily', 'convenience', 'store', 'small', 'town', 'soon', 'swept', 'hard-times', 'others', 'are', 'suffering', 'make', 'do', 'series', 'tragic', 'events', 'occur.Due', 'events', 'family', 'heads', 'mining', 'town', 'New', 'Bedford', 'where', 'meet', 'up', 'town', 'matriarch', 'May', 'Bailey', 'May', 'subborn', 'hard', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'met', 'grand-children', 'was', 'estranged', 'son', 'marrying', 'Honey', 'family', 'mother', 'Now', 'family', 'must', 'depend', 'May', 'daily', 'survival', 'starve', 'death', 'May', 'not', 'being', 'forgiving', 'type', 'not', 'make', 'easy', '.The', 'show', 'can', 'run', 'emotional', 'gammot', 'tear-jerker', 'hilarious', 'heartwarming-inspirational', 'brilliant', 'range', 'mixed', 'brutal', 'realism', 'such', 'pleasure', 'watch.Also', 'making', 'show', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'fabulous', 'overall', 'cast', 'one', 'characters', 'well-developed', 'superbly', 'acted', 'standount', 'show', 'definitely', 'Shirley', 'Douglass', 'May', 'Bailey', 'scene', 'absolute', 'magic', 'going', 'heartless', 'grandother', 'business', 'person', 'one', 'minute', 'person', 'real', 'feelings', 'pain', 'next', 'Great', 'stuff', 'all-around.Needless', 'say', 'think', 'My', 'Back', 'must', 'watch', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'created', 'kids', 'watch', 'well-acted', 'realistic', 'family', 'dramas', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'anything', 'back', 'then', 'series']",Wind at My Back: Season 1

893248,AUW19MI6R6A1X,B0007XBKVI,Mike Z,"[1, 3]","Certainly, this series is great for family values. But the acting, at least in episode 1, was very bad. And frankly, I did not like the writing. The story line was too contrived and cliche - script seemed like what a freshman in high school would dream up to complete a writing assignment the night before it was due. I don't mind cliche (like MacGyver) but I watch it for humor, not so much drama. Just the wrong mix for me - I found it difficult to even sit through the first episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah ""would you rather watch the trash they show now-a-days?"" and my answer is ""No"". I like family value shows and I like the classics. I never heard of this show until yesterday, thus it could not be the smash hit that many make it out to be. But if you like, watch it - there is plenty worse you could tune in to with your family.

893250,AMDTFK7NPWQRE,B0007XBKVI,Shoekitty,"[14, 14]","This is one of my favorite all time shows.  I discovered it on INSP while channel surfing.  I tuned in toward end of series, so I bought all five seasons and the Christmas DVD to catch up and eked each episode out sparingly as the series came to a close. Then when I bought the series INSP started it over! LOL.  In fact July 17th they are starting from the beginning again. This is the story of a family Jack and Honey Bailey, their 2 sons Hub and Fat, daughter Violet that has to reunite with Jack's side of the family after his shocking , sudden death. The bitterness of May Bailey, Jack's mother, tears the family apart and the saga begins!The actors were perfect!  The boys, Hub and Fat did some of the best child acting I have ever seen.  They were good to the end as they grew from young boys into young men without skipping a beat.  Shirley Douglas owned the role of May Bailey, and I would go between hating her, and loving her. Man, did she get nasty.  I'd be yelling out loud at some of the stuff she pulled.  Her role was very varied.  Grace was my favorite, and the actress did such a wonderful job.  The costumes are award winning, and oh my..the hats. I did hear the designer who did costumes for this show won all kinds of awards.  The sets were historically accurate, and they built a special town for this series.  Although the show takes place in Canada during the Great Depression, it seemed just like any town during the depression.My only complaint is that one, the series ended so abruptly and two..they never ended it properly.  The series was ended without warning to cast and crew.  There was a public outcry and 2 years after ending it, they came back with a Christmas special.  It was suppose to tie the story together.  For me it didn't totally.  First of all May and Grace are not in it. It is explained they cannot come to Christmas because Grace is retrieving her husbands body (killed in Spain), and May went with her then came down with pneumonia in London on the way home.  The Christmas DVD concentrates more on Hub, and many stories and endings are left out of the picture.  The Christmas DVD is still worth getting if you are a WAMB buff.I bought this series for 125 dollars in April, all 5 seasons.  I think price went up as the DVD's became scarce, and the series became cult like due to the INSP showing.This show has everything, and is suitable for the entire family.  It is not hokey, just carried through realistically because of good scripts and top notch acting.  I cannot get this show out of my head.",5,It was a horrible blow when series ended,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2548,"['one', 'favorite', 'time', 'discovered', 'INSP', 'channel', 'surfing', 'tuned', 'end', 'series', 'bought', 'five', 'seasons', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'catch', 'up', 'eked', 'episode', 'out', 'sparingly', 'series', 'came', 'close', 'Then', 'when', 'bought', 'series', 'INSP', 'started', 'over', 'LOL', 'fact', 'July', '17th', 'are', 'starting', 'beginning', 'again', 'story', 'family', 'Jack', 'Honey', 'Bailey', '2', 'sons', 'Hub', 'Fat', 'daughter', 'Violet', 'reunite', 'Jack', 'side', 'family', 'shocking', 'sudden', 'death', 'bitterness', 'May', 'Bailey', 'Jack', 'mother', 'family', 'apart', 'saga', 'actors', 'were', 'perfect', 'boys', 'Hub', 'Fat', 'did', 'best', 'child', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'were', 'good', 'end', 'grew', 'young', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'skipping', 'beat', 'Shirley', 'Douglas', 'owned', 'role', 'May', 'Bailey', 'would', 'go', 'hating', 'loving', 'Man', 'did', 'get', 'nasty', ""'d"", 'be', 'yelling', 'out', 'loud', 'stuff', 'pulled', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'varied', 'Grace', 'was', 'favorite', 'actress', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'costumes', 'are', 'award', 'winning', 'oh', 'my..the', 'hats', 'did', 'hear', 'designer', 'who', 'did', 'costumes', 'show', 'won', 'kinds', 'awards', 'sets', 'were', 'historically', 'accurate', 'built', 'special', 'town', 'series', 'show', 'place', 'Canada', 'Great', 'Depression', 'seemed', 'just', 'town', 'depression.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'one', 'series', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly', 'two..they', 'never', 'ended', 'properly', 'series', 'was', 'ended', 'warning', 'cast', 'crew', 'was', 'public', 'outcry', '2', 'years', 'ending', 'came', 'back', 'Christmas', 'special', 'was', 'suppose', 'tie', 'story', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'totally', 'First', 'May', 'Grace', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'Christmas', 'Grace', 'retrieving', 'husbands', 'body', 'killed', 'Spain', 'May', 'went', 'then', 'came', 'down', 'pneumonia', 'London', 'way', 'home', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'more', 'Hub', 'many', 'stories', 'endings', 'are', 'left', 'picture', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'are', 'WAMB', 'buff.I', 'bought', 'series', '125', 'dollars', 'April', '5', 'seasons', 'think', 'price', 'went', 'up', 'DVD', 'became', 'scarce', 'series', 'became', 'cult', 'due', 'INSP', 'showing.This', 'show', 'everything', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'not', 'hokey', 'just', 'carried', 'realistically', 'good', 'scripts', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'show', 'head']",Wind at My Back: Season 1
