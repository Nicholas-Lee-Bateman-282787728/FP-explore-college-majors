1575423,A182VTJIIEVM37,B008SAPC9S,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 2]","It's kind of obvious that Unova saga is my favorite (mainly because I'm one of the few people that hate Misty and thought Brock needed to go.) Set in a far region away from ""Japan"", Ash is now in ""America""......Which means losing his brain cells again with forgetting the basics. In this season, Team Rocket has suddenly become competent (actually this was built up for people who were paying attention to the Diamond and Pearl arc. After taking credit for the fall of Team Magna, Aqua and Galactic, Team Rocket got promoted and not wanting to disappoint their boss leave their cute/comedic Pokemon behind to get serious.) As luck would have it, Pikachu is zapped by Zekrom (the black dragon) and loses his electricity. Ash doesn't realize that until he battles his new (unappreciated) rival Trip (who chooses Snivy like the majority of the fanbase did when Black/White came out because he was cool while Ash had the reaction of the fanbase that saw Oshawott for what it was and ends up taking Oshawott with Juniper's approval.)From there, Ash meets Iris and then later Cilan and the trio form the group similar to the Kanto group and travel Unova only all have a goal in mind.If you can survive the first 12 episodes, then you'll be pleased with the quality episodes coming afterward. In fact, the quality of the Unova arc is very good until the Unova League (where it's at its worse) and then it picks up again with the N arc.Personally, I find Iris and Cilan being part of the group as refreshing. With too girly and annoying female characters -cough- DAWN -cough cough- and characters that needed to go because their jokes were boring and repetitive...(Brock) While Iris is annoying with her ""Just a kid"" comment repeated once or twice per episode, its to be noted how this statement is meant to be filled with hypocrisy as her rival Georgia will point out multiple times. Iris does suffer from an inferiority superiority complex and has to insult Ash to make herself feel better when she's not that good at being a trainer (at first). She has ways to go before she ends up like her game counterpart. Cilan is my new favorite being fabulous and a wonderful trainer unlike Brock who always lost. -_-Ash builds his team relatively quickly this season similar to season 1 and the mistakes he makes aren't as noticeable in this season as did the DP saga (losing to the first gym anyone?) Ash overall in this season while more excited (given he's in Unova) is noted to be MUCH calmer in threatening situations as well as handling Trip way better than his previous two rivals. (He doesn't get too upset for losing against Trip and makes it obvious that his goal is to open Trip up instead of hating like Paul or trying to be better like Gary.)The worse part of the season is obviously the voice actors mainly Ash again (I want his old voice back). Also, I don't like how this doesn't have dual audio for Japanese. To watch the better version, just go online because the Japanese version actually isn't being taken offline for once.",4,A Great Start to the Unova Series,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3029,"['kind', 'obvious', 'Unova', 'saga', 'favorite', 'mainly', ""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'people', 'hate', 'Misty', 'thought', 'Brock', 'needed', 'go', 'Set', 'far', 'region', 'away', 'Japan', 'Ash', 'now', 'America', 'Which', 'losing', 'brain', 'cells', 'again', 'forgetting', 'basics', 'season', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'suddenly', 'become', 'competent', 'actually', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'Diamond', 'Pearl', 'arc', 'taking', 'credit', 'fall', 'Team', 'Magna', 'Aqua', 'Galactic', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'got', 'promoted', 'not', 'wanting', 'disappoint', 'boss', 'leave', 'cute/comedic', 'Pokemon', 'get', 'serious', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Pikachu', 'zapped', 'Zekrom', 'black', 'dragon', 'electricity', 'Ash', ""n't"", 'realize', 'new', 'unappreciated', 'rival', 'Trip', 'who', 'Snivy', 'majority', 'fanbase', 'did', 'when', 'Black/White', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'cool', 'Ash', 'had', 'reaction', 'fanbase', 'saw', 'Oshawott', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'taking', 'Oshawott', 'Juniper', 'approval', 'there', 'Ash', 'Iris', 'then', 'later', 'Cilan', 'trio', 'group', 'similar', 'Kanto', 'group', 'travel', 'Unova', 'only', 'all', 'have', 'goal', 'mind.If', 'can', 'survive', 'first', '12', 'episodes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'quality', 'coming', 'afterward', 'fact', 'quality', 'Unova', 'arc', 'very', 'good', 'Unova', 'League', 'where', 'worse', 'then', 'up', 'again', 'N', 'arc.Personally', 'find', 'Iris', 'Cilan', 'being', 'part', 'group', 'refreshing', 'too', 'girly', 'annoying', 'female', 'characters', '-cough-', 'DAWN', 'cough-', 'characters', 'needed', 'go', 'jokes', 'were', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'Brock', 'Iris', 'annoying', 'Just', 'kid', 'comment', 'repeated', 'once', 'twice', 'episode', 'be', 'noted', 'how', 'statement', 'meant', 'be', 'filled', 'hypocrisy', 'rival', 'Georgia', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'multiple', 'times', 'Iris', 'suffer', 'inferiority', 'superiority', 'complex', 'insult', 'Ash', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'when', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'being', 'trainer', 'first', 'ways', 'go', 'up', 'game', 'counterpart', 'Cilan', 'new', 'favorite', 'being', 'fabulous', 'wonderful', 'trainer', 'Brock', 'who', 'always', 'lost', '-_-Ash', 'team', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'season', 'similar', 'season', '1', 'mistakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'season', 'did', 'DP', 'saga', 'losing', 'first', 'gym', 'anyone', 'Ash', 'overall', 'season', 'more', 'excited', 'given', 'Unova', 'noted', 'be', 'MUCH', 'calmer', 'threatening', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'handling', 'Trip', 'way', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'rivals', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'upset', 'losing', 'Trip', 'obvious', 'goal', 'open', 'Trip', 'up', 'instead', 'hating', 'Paul', 'trying', 'be', 'better', 'Gary', 'worse', 'part', 'season', 'obviously', 'voice', 'actors', 'mainly', 'Ash', 'again', 'want', 'old', 'voice', 'back', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', ""n't"", 'have', 'dual', 'audio', 'Japanese', 'watch', 'better', 'version', 'just', 'go', 'online', 'Japanese', 'version', 'actually', ""n't"", 'being', 'taken', 'offline', 'once']",N/A

I wish they would combine this and volume 2 together for 24 episodes, but it looks like they are breaking them up to have a total of 4 volumes.Still doesn't make sense why other regions have complete season box sets and we have to have them broken down into small volumes. Plus we still don't have seasons 3, 4, 7 and 8 in box sets. Plus with Master Quest box sets being very rare, they made need to re-release them for fans to get them.Anyway, get this if you are a fan and would like to complete your Pokemon-on-dvd box sets!I made other reviews for Battle Dimension, Galactic Battles and Sinnoh League Victors.
