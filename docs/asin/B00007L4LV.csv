731125,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00007L4LV,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[4, 5]","The sociopath Roc Tremain (Luc Picard) is the Canadian version of Charles Manson.  He ruthlessly manipulated those within his community of true believers.  They refused to abandon Tremain even after witnessing his torturing and murdering one of their fellow members.  Their own children were readily sacrificed to this mad man's lust and violent behavior.  Disgustingly, Tremain had little sexual interest in the older children.  He apparently preferred his female victims to be no older than five or six years old!  Government officials did next to nothing until a brave social worker (Polly Walker) relentlessly forced the issue.I thoroughly enjoyed Savage Messiah.  The acting is superb along with the dialogue.  Why am I among the very few who thinks so?  I cannot begin to understand why this gem of a film is so ignored.  It is truly a four and a half to five star film.  Please make a point of seeing it.  I'm sure you will agree with me.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness",5,Savage Messiah is Something of a Hidden Treasure,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,978,"['sociopath', 'Roc', 'Tremain', 'Luc', 'Picard', 'Canadian', 'version', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'ruthlessly', 'manipulated', 'community', 'true', 'believers', 'refused', 'abandon', 'Tremain', 'even', 'witnessing', 'torturing', 'murdering', 'one', 'fellow', 'members', 'own', 'children', 'were', 'readily', 'sacrificed', 'mad', 'man', 'lust', 'violent', 'behavior', 'Disgustingly', 'Tremain', 'had', 'little', 'sexual', 'interest', 'older', 'children', 'apparently', 'preferred', 'female', 'victims', 'be', 'older', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'Government', 'officials', 'did', 'next', 'nothing', 'brave', 'social', 'worker', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'relentlessly', 'forced', 'issue.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Savage', 'Messiah', 'acting', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'Why', 'am', 'very', 'few', 'who', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'gem', 'film', 'so', 'ignored', 'truly', 'four', 'half', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'Please', 'make', 'point', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'agree', 'me.David', 'ThomsonFlares', 'Darkness']",Savage Messiah
731126,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00007L4LV,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This is a sensational, tabloid type story that the producers/director thankfully didn't turn into heavy handed schlock.Here's the scoop. Taken from a true story, this Ontario set film revolves around a Manson-ish cult leader who is very charismatic and keeps a harem of women and their offspring to do his bidding. A local social worker thinks things might not be so rosy and mounts a campaign to get the children and women out of there. It's not as easy as she'd hoped.This is a decent, low budget, independent type flick. There are very few sets and no frou-frou. The focus is on the characters and the script and both are good enough to see this through. Polly Walker, as the social worker, was herself an abused wife, so she has a keen eye for this situation, along with a personal desire to see that no harm comes to these ""church"" members. Luc Picard as the leader of said church also does a fine job. Though not handsome, he still has an arresting presence. He can be charming when needed but, underneath, he's a snake who just wants to have his cake and eat it too. He dishes out punishment and death with little remorse of conscience. You want Polly to succeed and get all these folk safe and make certain Picard pays for his cruelty.The director, Mario Azzopardi, has a ton of credits, mostly TV, under his belt. To his credit he made this story believable. What could have been a heavy handed effort is told with a quiet authority that allows the story to speak for itself.This is probably more three and half stars than the four I gave it but it's more than a worthwhile watch.",4,Thankfully Understated,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,1589,"['sensational', 'tabloid', 'type', 'story', 'producers/director', 'thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'heavy', 'handed', 'scoop', 'Taken', 'true', 'story', 'Ontario', 'set', 'film', 'around', 'Manson-ish', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'very', 'charismatic', 'harem', 'women', 'offspring', 'do', 'bidding', 'local', 'social', 'worker', 'thinks', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'rosy', 'campaign', 'get', 'children', 'women', 'there', 'not', 'as', 'easy', ""'d"", 'hoped.This', 'decent', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'type', 'flick', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'sets', 'frou-frou', 'focus', 'characters', 'script', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'see', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'social', 'worker', 'was', 'abused', 'wife', 'keen', 'eye', 'situation', 'personal', 'desire', 'see', 'harm', 'church', 'members', 'Luc', 'Picard', 'leader', 'said', 'church', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'not', 'handsome', 'still', 'arresting', 'presence', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'when', 'needed', 'underneath', 'snake', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'out', 'punishment', 'death', 'little', 'remorse', 'conscience', 'want', 'Polly', 'succeed', 'get', 'folk', 'safe', 'make', 'certain', 'Picard', 'cruelty.The', 'director', 'Mario', 'Azzopardi', 'ton', 'credits', 'mostly', 'TV', 'belt', 'credit', 'made', 'story', 'believable', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'heavy', 'handed', 'effort', 'told', 'quiet', 'authority', 'story', 'speak', 'itself.This', 'probably', 'more', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'four', 'gave', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",Savage Messiah

731131,A55B9VCC7F2ZL,B00007L4LV,SkookumPete,"[0, 0]","It's an honest and competent telling of the story but never rises much above the level of a TV movie, and the bland musical soundtrack puts it squarely in that category. Luc Picard does a decent job without really conveying Roch Th&eacute;riault's sinister charisma -- it's more of a hail-fellow-well-met public persona than one that would draw in worshipful cult members. Polly Walker's flitting smile is almost creepier, and her brittle portrayal of the social worker never convinced me that she was the type of person who could establish a rapport with any of the victimized women. Easily the most interesting performance is that by Isabelle Blais as the subdued yet radiant Lise.Despite the darkness -- it's not till the last half hour that we become aware of the magnitude of the horrors that have been taking place at the commune -- there are laughable moments involving the police, who speed to the commune with sirens blaring to apprehend the children, but later arrive like casual visitors to arrest Th&eacute;riault for aggravated assault. Maybe they didn't have SWAT teams in 1989 rural Ontario? When they find the fugitive in the woods, he assumes a pose of crucifixion with his women around his feet as in a Renaissance painting, a bit of cinematography that strikes a completely false note.",3,Merely adequate,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1304,"['honest', 'competent', 'telling', 'story', 'never', 'much', 'level', 'TV', 'movie', 'bland', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'squarely', 'category', 'Luc', 'Picard', 'decent', 'job', 'really', 'conveying', 'Roch', 'Th', 'eacute', 'riault', 'sinister', 'charisma', 'more', 'hail-fellow-well-met', 'public', 'persona', 'one', 'would', 'draw', 'worshipful', 'cult', 'members', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'flitting', 'smile', 'almost', 'creepier', 'brittle', 'portrayal', 'social', 'worker', 'never', 'convinced', 'was', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'establish', 'rapport', 'victimized', 'women', 'Easily', 'most', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Isabelle', 'Blais', 'subdued', 'yet', 'radiant', 'Lise.Despite', 'darkness', 'not', 'till', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'become', 'aware', 'magnitude', 'horrors', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'place', 'commune', 'are', 'laughable', 'moments', 'involving', 'police', 'who', 'speed', 'commune', 'sirens', 'blaring', 'apprehend', 'children', 'later', 'arrive', 'casual', 'visitors', 'arrest', 'Th', 'eacute', 'riault', 'aggravated', 'assault', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'SWAT', 'teams', '1989', 'rural', 'Ontario', 'When', 'find', 'fugitive', 'woods', 'pose', 'crucifixion', 'women', 'feet', 'Renaissance', 'painting', 'bit', 'cinematography', 'completely', 'false', 'note']",Savage Messiah
731132,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00007L4LV,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[14, 17]","Savage Messaih is the true story of Roc Tremain who had a commune up in Canada where he lived with his 9 wives.  On the outside it would seem like they are a happy and peaceful folk, if not a little kinky at times.  However whn dweliing upon the inner mysteries of the commune it was revealed that Roc was truelly a monster who physically, psychologically, and sexually abused his 9 wives and 17 children.This stroy story tells how he was found out about what he did.  ALthough the movie cannot even begin to explain what all he really did (and still hold the R rating as well as being viewable in most nations) it does show mostly how he manipulated his wives especially when they all claimed to love him.The reason this story is so sad and disturbing is the fact that it actually happened, and to many degrees still happens not just in Canada, or BRitian, or any other nation, but also here in the United States.
