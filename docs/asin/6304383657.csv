Whether discussing the big chill{the return of the seacaucus seven}or the Blacksox scandal{eight men out} or an Irish Legend{the secret of roan inish}, Sayles is on target,literate and ENJOYABLE. Matewan is a cold heart in american history,when workers actually cared about their fellows,and were willing to put themselves, LITERALLY, on the line. This story takes place in WestVa. in the 1920's. The always excellent Chris Cooper{a sayles staple} is brilliant as the pacifist union leader of the united Mine Workers. James earlJones,the corporate shill who  was once an accomplished actor, and turns out what might be the finest performance of his career as a poor mine worker. The cinematography is pitch perfect{the legendary Haskell Wexler,I later discovered, was responsible}. Even the child actors are superb{a notoriously difficult feat}. The scenes of the poverty as gut wrenching, as is the violence. Sayles spares us little. The ditty I sold my soul to the company store has mnore meaning after watching this movie. A brilliant social and political commentary, and a master crafstman at work. HUGELY RECOMMENDED.

417702,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6304383657,Bomojaz,"[3, 6]","Coal miners in West Virginia going union in the early 1920s; Matewan is the town where union busters tried to ""dissuade"" them. Very meticulously filmed, but overly long. The union troubles in the coal fields involved long waiting-out periods, interrupted occasionally by sporadic confrontations. Not much goes on during the waiting; the violence is over in a hurry: if a movie is going to focus on these aspects only, the movie will suffer. The movie only half-heartedly tries to portray any of the people, other than stereotypical views of oppressor vs. oppressed. There are some interesting ideas here: a group of blacks are brought in to work the mines and, despite prejudice, are persuaded to join the strikers. But not much is done with this situation. The sheriff, who tries to straddle the fence (though he's obviously on the side of the workers), is among the more interesting charcaters in the movie.",4,Matewan,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,909,"['Coal', 'miners', 'West', 'Virginia', 'going', 'union', 'early', '1920s', 'Matewan', 'town', 'where', 'union', 'busters', 'tried', 'dissuade', 'Very', 'meticulously', 'filmed', 'overly', 'long', 'union', 'troubles', 'coal', 'fields', 'involved', 'long', 'waiting-out', 'periods', 'interrupted', 'occasionally', 'sporadic', 'confrontations', 'Not', 'much', 'waiting', 'violence', 'over', 'hurry', 'movie', 'going', 'focus', 'aspects', 'only', 'movie', 'will', 'suffer', 'movie', 'only', 'half-heartedly', 'tries', 'portray', 'people', 'other', 'stereotypical', 'views', 'oppressor', 'vs.', 'oppressed', 'are', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'here', 'group', 'blacks', 'are', 'brought', 'work', 'mines', 'prejudice', 'are', 'persuaded', 'join', 'strikers', 'not', 'much', 'done', 'situation', 'sheriff', 'who', 'straddle', 'fence', 'obviously', 'side', 'workers', 'more', 'interesting', 'charcaters', 'movie']",Matewan VHS
417703,A1B14DFG0ATRV9,6304383657,Bullwinkle,"[13, 24]","I've just read the reviews of the DVD version,and want to let people know that the sound is as lousy on the Evergreen Entertainment VHS tape as they say it is on the DVD. I bought the movie new and watched it last night,and if you don't use the close-captioned display,you miss maybe 10% of the spoken words. There are whole scenes were not a single word is heard. If you couldn't read them from the screen,you wouldn't have any idea what is being said. It also has the same problems with the nighttime scenes filmed on the mountain. The lighting is so dark you can't see a thing that is going on. It is inexcuseable for them to produce a movie without any quality control whatsoever. Hard to believe they produced and sold this tape,and nobody envolved in the process even watched it.I gave it two stars based purely on the technical quality of the recording,NOT the plot or the actors.Beyond that,it is a very gripping story with 1st class acting by everybody involved. I agree with the reviewers who state that the director's and producers Marxist views are on full display and distort reality to the point where ""union=good,business=evil"". Life ain't that simple. There was and is as much evil in the union management as there was in the management of any business,and nothing on earth has ever managed to match the evils of communism.Having said all that,the union was clearly neccessary for the workers living in ""Company Towns"" in America during that period. They wouldn't have been neccessary if the Rockefellers and others hadn't tried to bring feudalism to America by buying these towns and turning the workers into serfs with no rights or freedom at all. What made this even worse were the politicians in the state capitals and in DC took company money and let them get away with it. Even FDR sent Army troops in to protect non-union workers during a coal strike,and the local DA's would allow the company goons to kill local workers without even bothering to have them arrested,much less put on trial.One day maybe people will realize that nature will always win,and that nature demands that for every action,there is a reaction. Nothing happens in a vacuum. The communist organizers and agitators would have never been able to get in and establish a foothold without the companies being so brutal and greedy. It's a wonder to me that the workers didn't get fed up and hang the company men and owners. Many of them sure deserved hanging. In turn the unions went too far once THEY got in the drivers seat,so they are on their way out now.At any rate,this movie tells a story that needs to be told. I doubt there are very many people alive in America today who really remember the company towns of old,and damn few under 40 who have even heard of them. These company towns were not only in the coal fields,but also in the textile belt and the tobacco belt. This is a lesson in history the younger generations need to be made aware of to prevent a return to it. This is especially true today given all the illegal aliens being brought into America to work cheap. If we are not careful it may happen again,and it may result in widespread revolution this time.I only hope a decent DVD version of this movie comes out. When and if it does,I hope every high school social studies and US history teacher in America show it to their students and get them discussing what happened.",2,Sound on VHS tape is as lousy as the DVD's,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,3383,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'read', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'version', 'want', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'sound', 'lousy', 'Evergreen', 'Entertainment', 'VHS', 'tape', 'say', 'DVD', 'bought', 'movie', 'new', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'close-captioned', 'display', 'miss', 'maybe', '10', '%', 'spoken', 'words', 'are', 'whole', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'single', 'word', 'heard', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'screen', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'same', 'problems', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'mountain', 'lighting', 'so', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'thing', 'going', 'inexcuseable', 'produce', 'movie', 'quality', 'control', 'whatsoever', 'Hard', 'believe', 'produced', 'sold', 'tape', 'nobody', 'envolved', 'process', 'even', 'watched', 'it.I', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'based', 'purely', 'technical', 'quality', 'recording', 'NOT', 'plot', 'actors.Beyond', 'very', 'gripping', 'story', '1st', 'class', 'acting', 'everybody', 'involved', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'state', 'director', 'producers', 'Marxist', 'views', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'distort', 'reality', 'point', 'where', 'union=good', 'business=evil', 'Life', 'ai', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'evil', 'union', 'management', 'was', 'management', 'business', 'nothing', 'earth', 'ever', 'managed', 'match', 'evils', 'communism.Having', 'said', 'union', 'was', 'clearly', 'neccessary', 'workers', 'living', 'Company', 'Towns', 'America', 'period', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'neccessary', 'Rockefellers', 'others', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'bring', 'feudalism', 'America', 'buying', 'towns', 'turning', 'workers', 'serfs', 'rights', 'freedom', 'What', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'were', 'politicians', 'state', 'capitals', 'DC', 'took', 'company', 'money', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'Even', 'FDR', 'sent', 'Army', 'troops', 'protect', 'non-union', 'workers', 'coal', 'strike', 'local', 'DA', 'would', 'allow', 'company', 'goons', 'kill', 'local', 'workers', 'even', 'bothering', 'have', 'arrested', 'much', 'less', 'put', 'trial.One', 'day', 'maybe', 'people', 'will', 'realize', 'nature', 'will', 'always', 'win', 'nature', 'action', 'reaction', 'Nothing', 'vacuum', 'communist', 'organizers', 'agitators', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'establish', 'foothold', 'companies', 'being', 'so', 'brutal', 'greedy', 'wonder', 'workers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'hang', 'company', 'men', 'owners', 'Many', 'sure', 'deserved', 'hanging', 'turn', 'unions', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'once', 'THEY', 'got', 'drivers', 'seat', 'are', 'way', 'now.At', 'rate', 'movie', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'doubt', 'are', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'alive', 'America', 'today', 'who', 'really', 'remember', 'company', 'towns', 'old', 'damn', 'few', '40', 'who', 'have', 'even', 'heard', 'company', 'towns', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'coal', 'fields', 'also', 'textile', 'belt', 'tobacco', 'belt', 'lesson', 'history', 'younger', 'generations', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'prevent', 'return', 'especially', 'true', 'today', 'given', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'being', 'brought', 'America', 'work', 'cheap', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'may', 'happen', 'again', 'may', 'result', 'widespread', 'revolution', 'only', 'hope', 'decent', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'out', 'When', 'hope', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'studies', 'US', 'history', 'teacher', 'America', 'show', 'students', 'get', 'discussing', 'what', 'happened']",Matewan VHS

417706,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,6304383657,Dai-keag-ity,"[4, 4]","I grew up hearing about these events from my grandmother, whose father was in management at a barge company that sent loads of coal from Appalachia to the industrialized cities along the Ohio River, but it surprises me how few people my age know about the Matewan massacre and the events that led up to it.In 1920 in a small town called Matewan, in Mongo County, in the heart of West Virginia's coal belt, local families attempted to organize a labor union in order to better their lives and free themselves from the oppressive stranglehold of the local coal companies, which owned ""everything but the immortal souls"" of those whose only choice in life was to work for these mafia-like corporations. The film Matewan is an impressive production that utilizes such actors as James Earl Jones and Chris Cooper to tell the story of the misery of the miners' lives, the corruption of the coal industry, the arrival of organized labor into this boiling maelstrom, and the violent events that ultimately culminated in a brutal firefight that left nine people dead.Matewan is heavy on characterizations and back story which is a brave and wise step on behalf of director John Sayles, and far from being the centerpoint of the picture, the bloodshed of the massacre comes only at the movie's conclusion and is not sensationalized, which only makes it seem that much more horrific when it passes. To some who see it Matewan could register as a gloomy film but if that is tempered by a comparison of how things have since improved in coal country, then the deaths which drew attention to the region, could almost be regarded as having happened with some purpose.",5,Bringing A Little-Known And Shocking Episode In US History To Modern Audiences,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1652,"['grew', 'up', 'hearing', 'events', 'grandmother', 'father', 'was', 'management', 'barge', 'company', 'sent', 'loads', 'coal', 'Appalachia', 'industrialized', 'cities', 'Ohio', 'River', 'how', 'few', 'people', 'age', 'know', 'Matewan', 'massacre', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'it.In', '1920', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Matewan', 'Mongo', 'County', 'heart', 'West', 'Virginia', 'coal', 'belt', 'local', 'families', 'attempted', 'organize', 'labor', 'union', 'order', 'better', 'lives', 'free', 'oppressive', 'stranglehold', 'local', 'coal', 'companies', 'owned', 'everything', 'immortal', 'souls', 'only', 'choice', 'life', 'was', 'work', 'mafia-like', 'corporations', 'film', 'Matewan', 'impressive', 'production', 'such', 'actors', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'tell', 'story', 'misery', 'miners', 'lives', 'corruption', 'coal', 'industry', 'arrival', 'organized', 'labor', 'boiling', 'maelstrom', 'violent', 'events', 'ultimately', 'culminated', 'brutal', 'firefight', 'left', 'nine', 'people', 'dead.Matewan', 'heavy', 'characterizations', 'back', 'story', 'brave', 'wise', 'step', 'behalf', 'director', 'John', 'Sayles', 'far', 'being', 'centerpoint', 'picture', 'bloodshed', 'massacre', 'only', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'not', 'sensationalized', 'only', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'horrific', 'when', 'who', 'see', 'Matewan', 'could', 'register', 'gloomy', 'film', 'tempered', 'comparison', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'improved', 'coal', 'country', 'then', 'deaths', 'drew', 'attention', 'region', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'regarded', 'having', 'happened', 'purpose']",Matewan VHS

417708,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6304383657,darragh o'donoghue,"[6, 8]","'Matewan' reeks of authentic American History.  We are so used to a certain, triumphalist, distorted version of 'America' transmitted throughout the globe, it's refreshing to be reminded that there are other Americas, other communities, other histories - some deeply shameful, some quietly inspiring.  In telling the violent, unmythic Western story of corporate greed, violence and murder against labour poverty and resistance, John Sayles seems to bring, as the cliche says, a sepia photograph to life.  From the creak of the frame buildings to the dank, dangerous mines; from the accents and idioms of dialect to various national laments and protest songs; from worn costumes to significant decor - everything in this film bypasses the museum mummifying of the period film, and feels lived in, real, the way it must have been.Of course, this is a carefully crafted illusion that becomes increasingly apparent as the film continues.  Imposed on this meticulous atmosphere and re-embodiment is a characteristically didactic and contrived Sayles script.  The bad guys are simply vicious; the good guy is a saint too impotently good to live in such an America; the workers have the dignity of being flawed and complex.  The film is full of Ken Loach-like political speeches (at least Sayles humorously acknowledges this by himself playing a hellfire, reactionary preacher), and some of the intercutting (e.g. between a prayer meeting and a union meeting; like Pasonlini, Sayles taps into the radical, proto-socialist impulses behind Christ's teachings) is hardly subtle.  Some of the plot developments - including a misplaced love-letter, a false accusation of rape and eavesdropping in a cupboard - are the cliches of Victorian melodrama.That none of this detracts from the power of 'Matewan' is due to the sensitvity of Haskell Wexler's cinematography; the solemn dignity of the acting; the savage indignation that went into the making of the film; and the brave refusal to dilute the stern politics with a trite love story.  More a liberal than a left-wing polemic, much of the film's brilliance lies in the way the period story reflects on Reagan's America - the hypocrisy of a conservatism trumpeting family values while allowing an unchecked capitalism that destroys those families; the glorification of selfishness at the expense of communities; institutional racism; the excessive war-mongering to deflect domestic problems, and the centrality of a gun culture - without once destroying its integrity.",4,Heroic.,1013731200,"02 15, 2002",2002,2507,"['reeks', 'authentic', 'American', 'History', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'certain', 'triumphalist', 'distorted', 'version', ""'America"", 'transmitted', 'globe', 'refreshing', 'be', 'reminded', 'are', 'other', 'Americas', 'other', 'communities', 'other', 'histories', 'deeply', 'shameful', 'quietly', 'inspiring', 'telling', 'violent', 'unmythic', 'Western', 'story', 'corporate', 'greed', 'violence', 'murder', 'labour', 'poverty', 'resistance', 'John', 'Sayles', 'bring', 'cliche', 'sepia', 'photograph', 'life', 'creak', 'frame', 'buildings', 'dank', 'dangerous', 'mines', 'accents', 'idioms', 'dialect', 'various', 'national', 'laments', 'protest', 'songs', 'worn', 'costumes', 'significant', 'decor', 'everything', 'film', 'museum', 'mummifying', 'period', 'film', 'feels', 'lived', 'real', 'way', 'must', 'have', 'been.Of', 'course', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'illusion', 'increasingly', 'apparent', 'film', 'Imposed', 'meticulous', 'atmosphere', 're-embodiment', 'characteristically', 'didactic', 'contrived', 'Sayles', 'script', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'simply', 'vicious', 'good', 'guy', 'saint', 'too', 'impotently', 'good', 'live', 'such', 'America', 'workers', 'have', 'dignity', 'being', 'flawed', 'complex', 'film', 'full', 'Ken', 'Loach-like', 'political', 'speeches', 'least', 'Sayles', 'humorously', 'playing', 'hellfire', 'reactionary', 'preacher', 'intercutting', 'e.g', 'prayer', 'meeting', 'union', 'meeting', 'Pasonlini', 'Sayles', 'radical', 'proto-socialist', 'impulses', 'Christ', 'teachings', 'hardly', 'subtle', 'plot', 'developments', 'including', 'misplaced', 'love-letter', 'false', 'accusation', 'rape', 'eavesdropping', 'cupboard', 'are', 'cliches', 'Victorian', 'melodrama.That', 'none', 'detracts', 'power', ""'Matewan"", 'due', 'sensitvity', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'cinematography', 'solemn', 'dignity', 'acting', 'savage', 'indignation', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'brave', 'refusal', 'dilute', 'stern', 'politics', 'trite', 'love', 'story', 'More', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'polemic', 'much', 'film', 'brilliance', 'way', 'period', 'story', 'Reagan', 'America', 'hypocrisy', 'conservatism', 'trumpeting', 'family', 'values', 'allowing', 'unchecked', 'capitalism', 'families', 'glorification', 'selfishness', 'expense', 'communities', 'institutional', 'racism', 'excessive', 'war-mongering', 'deflect', 'domestic', 'problems', 'centrality', 'gun', 'culture', 'once', 'destroying', 'integrity']",Matewan VHS
417709,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6304383657,Douglas Doepke,"[16, 18]","Quite simply, Matewan is the best labor film since 1954's Salt of the Earth. There are flaws. Sayles crowds too much into his screenplay, as though no aspect of labor's long struggle should be left out. Moreover, the movie at times comes awkwardly closer to an organizer's handbook than to an artistic recreation. Still, what's up there, on the screen, far surpasses anything depicting America's hidden history in decades, including the badly compromised but award-winning Norma Rae. Chris Cooper shines as the low-key organizer, and who else but an independent filmmaker would dare present a red in sympathetic light. I like the way he thoroughly Americanizes Cooper, unlike the sinister foreign weasles of studio stereotype. Outstanding too is Kevin Tighe  as an arrogant union-buster who, as the screenplay makes clear, is also a WWI war hero, having killed many Germans and proud of it. In fact the contrast between the two sides is capsulated by Cooper's observation that the war was about workers killing workers for the benefit of industrialists and politicians. A point Tighe could never comprehend, but one Eugene Debs could not have said better.The photography and costuming are outstanding, conveying genuine period flavor. The town of Matewan appears appropriately gritty and depressed, lending a nobility to those who defend it. Moreover, the struggle, as Sayles shows, is not only the classic labor vs. capital, but for the soul of Christianity in which Will Oldham's social gospel competes with Sayles' (in a bit part) hellfire and brimstone. Like Salt of the Earth, feminist themes occasionally surface with vivid force, such that it's no surprise when the disrespectful Tighe gets his final comeuppance from a woman. The ending is suitably ambiguous, with a begrimed Oldham staring balefully into the camera and into the future. Sayles has always had a strong social conscience. Here however he shows real guts in taking on themes that send cold shivers down Hollywood's spine as studio heads cast a wary eye toward their Wall St. bankrollers. Like so much else, Matewan demonstrates that in America, truth, such as it is, is only to be found on the margins.

On the union's side were both the town's mayor, Cabal Testerman (who was shot and killed in the battle even though he was unarmed) and the sheriff, Sid Hatfield, who survived this fight only to gunned down on the steps on the county courthouse some time later. These men and what happened to them were real. To this mix writer and director John Sayles has added a composite creation to represent the union organizers who were also present that day. His union organizer is Joe Kenehan (played by one of his stable of regulars, Chris Cooper), a man of principal and compassion dedicated to easing the life of the working man. Kenehan is a combination of all the organizers who would have flourished under the abysmal conditions of the mines and factories of this period; Wobblies, socialists, communists, and ""non-affiliated guys who just got involved."" People who never would have given unionizing a second thought if it hadn't been for the overwhelming greed and callousness of the mine owners and giants of industry at that time.We are given a glimpse of how profound their greed really is when a new group of scabs is brought in. One of the ways that organizing was kept to a minimum was by insuring that miners wouldn't speak to each other. This was accomplished by bringing in foreigners who simply didn't speak any English at all (in this instance some Italians) or by playing on people's innate racial hatreds, the remainder of the group was composed of blacks. Once new miners were hired on they were forced to rent their work clothes and equipment from the company store as well as pay for their housing and food all at exorbitant fees. In fact everything they needed could only be purchased through the company and prices were so high that it was guaranteed that they would never be able to pay back the inital outlay of monies they were fronted so that they could START to work! It was the original vicious circle.MATEWAN is one of Sayles earliest films and it is also one of his best. It full of powerful imagery and quiet truths that will stay with you long after it has told you its story, a story you have never heard before. Sayles is a true auteur; he produced, wrote, directed, and edited this film. He even has a bit part in the film as a fire and brimstone preacher who is another tool of the company.

From this review you might percieve this film to be a bunch of boring left-wing moralizing, but Sayles will entertain you and keep you interested in these people and their lives.

417722,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6304383657,Linda Linguvic,"[47, 50]","This 1987 film, written and directed by John Sayles, is based on a real incident from the 1920, when workers from a West Virginia coal mine went on strike.  Chris Cooper stars as a labor union organizer who comes to the town which is run the Company that  have just brought in a trainload of black men as well as a group of Italian families to do the work of the strikers.  James Earl Jones is cast as the leader of the blacks who says out loud that he understands people can't help calling him the ""N"" word, but no man can ever call him a ""scab"".  Will Oldham is cast as a 14-year old mine worker and sometimes preacher.  There are heroes and villains in this film, and Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clapp are the kind of bad guys you love to hate.The pace is slow as the story unfolds, each actor giving depth to his or her role.  The Union is represented as a good and unifying force for the diverse types of people caught up in the drama.  The company is represented as bad.  Really bad.  Not only did they exploit their workers and push people out of their homes, they also did not stop at brutal murder.  There were enough personal stories to keep the film interesting although I found some of the speeches a little long and talky.  It was all about mood and bleakness and John Sayles sure is a master of setting the mood.  Most of the extras in the film lived in the area of Appalachia where it was shot and the close-ups of their faces added to the film's authenticity.One of the problems was that the transfer of the film to DVD wasn't done well.  The sound was muffled and some of the words were indistinct.  And the shots set in the forest were so dark that it was hard to tell what was going on.  I enjoyed the film although I thought it was too long.

The pacificism of Sayles' union organizer stands in contrast to the quick-tempered violence of the miners, but both stand against the pure brutishness of the Baldwin-Felts agents. Matewan's mayor and Sid Hatfield stand as heroes, as do more than a few who pick up guns in the final confrontation.

417732,AGK4BEIQ017HY,6304383657,P. I. Johnson,"[6, 8]","Everyone who loves and appreciates movies should revere Sayles as the most coherent, consistent and independent voice of American cinema. Through a succession of truly great and criminally unrecognised films (Brother from Another Planet; Return of the Secaucus Seven; Eight Men Out; Lone Star) Sayles powerfully projects the earthy, progressive and - yes - left-wing convictions that once informed the views of the majority of ordinary American working men and women. The cinema of Sayles is somewhat like the music of Woody Guthrie - grounded in the views and experience of ordinary people, tinged with melancholy, yet coupled to a vision of a better America. At a time when even an enjoyable popcorn movie like Gladiator is confused as progressive filmmaking, Sayles' movies are the perfect reminder that there is still a REAL cinema of commitment in much the same way that somewhere in the midst and to the left of the Democratic Party there is still a REAL progressive movement. Like his English counterpart Ken Loach, Sayles chooses not to shy away from progressive presumptions in his storytelling - and the resulting integrity of his work accordingly demands respect no matter what your political viewpoint. Amongst his illustrious films, Matewan towers above all as Sayles' magnificent and epic signature film. Telling the heroic and tragic tale of the Virginia coalminers' strike, Sayles sides squarely and refreshingly (for an American film) with the striking workers. As with Eight Men Out (the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series scam), his view of the interests, needs and sentiments of owners is unrelentingly unsympathetic and scathing as he reveals them for what they were: ruthless, greedy robber-barons who built their fortune on the sweat and backs of American labour. But the quality and depth of Sayles' understanding of strike dynamics allows him to avoid the potential counter-pitfall of romanticizing union solidarity. Instead, he reveals with great frankness the racism, suspicion, manipulation, violence and treachery that oftentimes see workers self-destruct their own cause. The manipulated role of religion, church and authority does not escape Sayles' penetrating gaze either as he reminds us of uncomfortable truths in the history of class struggle in the US. Chris Cooper is SUPERB as the union organizer sent South to unionise the striking miners. Sayles regulars Mary McDonnell and David Strathairn provide strong support. Strathairn - as the laconic six-gun toting local Sheriff - is particularly rousing in his role as ultimate protector of the mining community. But before you think this movie is some long, boring, red flag waving political lecture, let me give you the good news quickly. THIS MOVIE ROCKS! Sayles' decision to play it like a Western is inspired - and it delivers in terms of every aspect of expectation in this regard (including, yes, the High Noon-style showdown). Riveting, violent and riddled with intrigue, this is a film that would not be out of place next to The Wild Bunch or Shane in your collection. That it also delivers powerful food for thought and that its heart - and head - is in the right place, will make it possibly the best movie in your collection that no one's ever heard of.

My grandfater was one of the minors who was in the strike. We forget that not that long ago the mines was a death trap, but the only work available for the people of Kentucky, and West Virginia. Most men had black lung and died before 50 from working in the mines. My grandfather took part in this strike. My family home which is in Dingess is about a Half mile from the big tunnel, which use to be a coal railroad. Above the tunnel is where alot of the miners marched and was met with bullets from the men the coal mines had hired to basicly beat the miners into submission. Today you can still walk the path and find shell casings of the firefight. I do agree that the sound is off in some places of the movie, but this movie is so much apart of history. This is a true story for so many of us who came from the back hills of coal mining counties. I think some times that people forget that it was a struggle to get mining to the standards it is now. I remember my granddaddy once saying that hell was only a quarter mile below ground. Matewan West Virginia is a real place, and these events really happened. We tend to forget I feel sometimes about the struggles that happened to get this country to where it is now. Miners died and went through hell to help make mining safer for today energy needs.

417734,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,6304383657,Rocco Dormarunno,"[21, 25]","It's difficult not to get your personal feelings called into play when watching an obviously slanted film like Matewan. John Sayles, like Oliver Stone, is an obvious agit-prop master for the left. But so are several others. However, those others do not get the responses that Sayles has evoked because they don't have half the movie making talent that Sayles possesses. There is no fence-sitting when watching his films, and that's because his visions and messages are clear, uncompromising and passionate. Matewan is his highest achievement in those regards.Using the coal miners' unionization efforts of the 1920s as his springboard, Sayles explores one of the dark truths at the heart of free-market capitalism: the unblinking willingness of those in power to crush--physically and spiritually--those who work.Sayles' gritty realism, the gaunt faces of the actual citizens of West Virginia who serve as extras in the film, Haskell Wexler's recreation of a long-gone era, and, of course, the great performances all around, drive that dark point home. Sayles' script, although a little long-winded at points, illustrates well how employers pit worker against worker, worker against scab, scab against scab. In fact, the workers do as much violence to each other as the bosses do to them. Don't dismiss this as a masnifesto disguised as a film. In the tradition of On the Waterfront (also based on an actual event), the characters, situations, and dialogue are all convincing.This is a great film but be sure to see it on video, not DVD, as others have pointed out.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS",5,An exploration of America's terrible dark side,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1608,"['difficult', 'not', 'get', 'personal', 'feelings', 'called', 'play', 'when', 'watching', 'obviously', 'slanted', 'film', 'Matewan', 'John', 'Sayles', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'obvious', 'agit-prop', 'master', 'left', 'so', 'are', 'several', 'others', 'However', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'responses', 'Sayles', 'evoked', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'making', 'talent', 'Sayles', 'fence-sitting', 'when', 'watching', 'films', 'visions', 'messages', 'are', 'clear', 'uncompromising', 'passionate', 'Matewan', 'highest', 'achievement', 'regards.Using', 'coal', 'miners', 'unionization', 'efforts', '1920s', 'springboard', 'Sayles', 'one', 'dark', 'truths', 'heart', 'free-market', 'capitalism', 'unblinking', 'willingness', 'power', 'crush', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'who', 'work.Sayles', 'gritty', 'realism', 'gaunt', 'actual', 'citizens', 'West', 'Virginia', 'who', 'serve', 'extras', 'film', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'recreation', 'long-gone', 'era', 'course', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'drive', 'dark', 'point', 'home', 'Sayles', 'script', 'little', 'long-winded', 'points', 'well', 'how', 'employers', 'pit', 'worker', 'worker', 'worker', 'scab', 'scab', 'scab', 'fact', 'workers', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'violence', 'other', 'bosses', 'do', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'masnifesto', 'disguised', 'film', 'tradition', 'Waterfront', 'also', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'characters', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'are', 'convincing.This', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'video', 'not', 'DVD', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out.Rocco', 'Dormarunno', 'author', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'POINTS']",Matewan VHS

417743,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6304383657,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Matewan was a pleasant surprise. The subject matter cried out 'dull but worthy' and John Sayles is distinctly hit-and-miss when dealing with historical subjects, as the problematic Eight Men Out underlines, but this is quite a superb movie with a scope well beyond its budget. Almost a slow burn western as a miner's strike leads slowly but inevitably to a violent shootout between the railroad detectives and the local lawman and strikers, it's an involving and intelligent piece of work. That's not to say it's without problems: it perhaps overstates Kevin Tighe's villainous stupidity (could he really have laughed his way through a sermon without seeing the relevance?), a scene where the white, black and Italian miners set aside their differences through music feels too Hollywood, and Haskell Wexler over diffuses the light a couple of times in that irritating late-70s-early-80s way in his otherwise exemplary cinematography. Sayles briefly offers another one of his stomach-turning cameos as a preacher, but at least he's only in it for a minute or two (unlike his genuinely irritating Ring Lardner impersonation in Eight Men Out) and he's on much more solid grounds with his impressive ensemble cast - a young Chris Cooper on excellent form, Mary McDonnell before she got irritating, James Earl Jones before he stopped acting, David Strathairn, Bob Gunton and Will Oldham among them. You get the sense that Sayles likes his characters and cares for them. It's that which prevents the film from slipping into easy dogma and posturing and which makes it still seem surprising and shocking when the inevitable violence breaks out.
