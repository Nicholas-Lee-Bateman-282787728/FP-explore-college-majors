1434022,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004Z1HY2W,B. E Jackson,"[4, 4]","The Clinic is a REALLY disturbing horror film.  Yes it falls under the category of ""torture, rape and physical and mental abuse"" similar to the Hills Have Eyes, but even *worse* on an emotional level.It's about a man/father and his pregnant girlfriend/wife who spend the night at a hotel, and upon the man momentarily leaving his hotel room and coming back, he discovers his girlfriend is missing without a trace, so he goes around the small town asking people concerning her whereabouts.  It turns out he asks the wrong people and makes trouble with the law enforcement.  However...Where his girlfriend/wife ends up is the WORST place imaginable.  She wakes up in an ice-soaked bathtub at what appears to be a rundown and secluded abortion clinic and she's alone, cold and frightened.  We soon realize that... uh this is hard to write... that her baby was ripped out of her stomach and stolen.Eventually -without spoiling much more about this surprisingly enticing storyline- the woman meets 3 other women who've also had their babies stolen and looking for some answers/revenge.  From here, it's a mad quest for the mothers to retrieve their babies and find out what happened to them, and who's responsible.An interesting element is that the man/father doesn't play much of a role at all after the beginning 30 minutes, which I honestly did NOT see coming.  The best part without a *doubt* is the REALLY intense ending.  Talk about loads of heavy and emotionally unbearable atmosphere!  Everything will make sense by that point.Besides this, I'd just like to point out that Tabrett Bethell has a REALLY beautiful face.  She's honestly someone I now have a crush on thanks to her appearance and performance in this film.A must watch movie for the more graphic-loving horror fans out there, this is NOT for the faint of heart.  Watch it under extreme caution if you're a huge baby lover.",5,puttin' on a clinic,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1887,"['Clinic', 'REALLY', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'film', 'Yes', 'category', 'torture', 'rape', 'physical', 'mental', 'abuse', 'similar', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'even', '*worse*', 'emotional', 'level.It', 'man/father', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend/wife', 'who', 'spend', 'night', 'hotel', 'man', 'momentarily', 'leaving', 'hotel', 'room', 'coming', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'missing', 'trace', 'small', 'town', 'asking', 'people', 'concerning', 'whereabouts', 'out', 'wrong', 'people', 'trouble', 'law', 'enforcement', 'However', 'Where', 'girlfriend/wife', 'up', 'WORST', 'place', 'imaginable', 'up', 'ice-soaked', 'bathtub', 'what', 'be', 'rundown', 'secluded', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'alone', 'cold', 'frightened', 'soon', 'realize', 'uh', 'hard', 'write', 'baby', 'was', 'ripped', 'stomach', 'stolen.Eventually', 'spoiling', 'much', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'enticing', 'storyline-', 'woman', '3', 'other', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'also', 'had', 'babies', 'stolen', 'looking', 'answers/revenge', 'here', 'mad', 'quest', 'mothers', 'retrieve', 'babies', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'responsible.An', 'interesting', 'element', 'man/father', ""n't"", 'play', 'much', 'role', 'beginning', '30', 'minutes', 'honestly', 'did', 'NOT', 'see', 'coming', 'best', 'part', '*doubt*', 'REALLY', 'intense', 'ending', 'Talk', 'loads', 'heavy', 'emotionally', 'unbearable', 'atmosphere', 'Everything', 'will', 'make', 'sense', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Tabrett', 'Bethell', 'REALLY', 'beautiful', 'face', 'honestly', 'someone', 'now', 'have', 'crush', 'thanks', 'appearance', 'performance', 'film.A', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'graphic-loving', 'horror', 'fans', 'there', 'NOT', 'faint', 'heart', 'Watch', 'extreme', 'caution', ""'re"", 'huge', 'baby', 'lover']",N/A

Also, I'm not too hard to please when it comes to low budget horror movies.  But I have to say, this movie was just boring.  I actually didnt finish it, which is unheard of for me to not even finish a movie.  I'll probably go back and watch the end one of these days.  The movie is so unrealistic in so many ways.  They could at least try to make it believable.  Just one example, the girl who was pregnant had her baby removed, and she awakes with a tight flat stomach not to mention unsightly implants.  Didnt look like a girl who was 9 months pregnant 1 hour ago.  Hard to buy into the storyline of a movie when they didnt even attempt to make the situations realistic.  Another example, when the 5 girls were walking around (the completely empty) facility, they all had the exact same little blood stain on the front of their shirts.  Can they at least try to vary the blood stain?  Seems like no thought was put into the details here.  And what is this, some kind of reality show, the way the girls are allowed to walk around this facility freely, killing eachother and doing whatever they want, while some men are in a room somewhere just watching it all on monitors?  But I can look past all that in a low budget horror movie; my main problem here was just that it was so boring.  Watching these girls walk around the faciltiy with not much action or even suspense.  Matter-of-fact, I think I need to finish watching it just to see if Andy Whitfield is going to come to the rescue or what.  But my main point here, this is a boring movie.

1434035,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004Z1HY2W,trebe,"[0, 0]","The Clinic (2010) is an Australian suspense thriller that doesn't quite hold together, but some original elements and odd plot twists, help to make it a little more memorable, among the many entries in the horror and suspense genres.  Some spoilers follow.The story is set in the year 1979, some six years before DNA testing became common.  Cameron (Andy Whitfield) and his pregnant girlfriend Beth (Tabrett Bethell) are travelling cross country, and stop at a motel for the night, where Beth is abducted, and awakes naked in a bathtub, with her baby surgically removed.  Beth discovers that she is at a livestock facility (there is no actual clinic), trapped with a group of women, who have also recently had their babies stolen in a similar fashion.  The new mothers determine that another mother is in hiding, and is killing members of their group, in an attempt to discover the identity of her baby.The Clinic tosses a few curve balls, as what starts out as abduction, turns into an examination of maternal motivations, and a test of survival.  The level suspense and gore increases, as a twisted master plan unfolds, featuring some tense moments, including one with attacking dogs.Although very physically active, the women somehow manage not to tear open their recently sutured abdomens.  There's not a lot of logic involved in what happens, but if you can ignore some rather large plot holes, the story is fairly engaging.  A really crucial turning point occurs, when the mothers discover six infants trapped inside wire framed cribs, but instead of staying with them, they decide to leave them, in order to try and determine which child belong to what mother.  Even in the pre-DNA era, this is a questionable act that few real mothers would probably consider.The Clinic is an uneven thriller with an overdramatic conclusion, which mixes some standard horror clich&eacute;s, with a number of unexpected developments.  With some scary moments and decent acting, this 3.5 star effort is worth a watch for horror buffs, but with too many pieces that conveniently fall into place, the movie just doesn't quite reach its potential.",3,which baby is mine?,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,2133,"['Clinic', '2010', 'Australian', 'suspense', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'together', 'original', 'elements', 'odd', 'plot', 'twists', 'help', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'memorable', 'many', 'entries', 'horror', 'suspense', 'genres', 'spoilers', 'follow.The', 'story', 'set', 'year', '1979', 'six', 'years', 'DNA', 'testing', 'became', 'common', 'Cameron', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'Tabrett', 'Bethell', 'are', 'travelling', 'cross', 'country', 'stop', 'motel', 'night', 'where', 'Beth', 'abducted', 'awakes', 'naked', 'bathtub', 'baby', 'surgically', 'removed', 'Beth', 'livestock', 'facility', 'actual', 'clinic', 'trapped', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'recently', 'had', 'babies', 'stolen', 'similar', 'fashion', 'new', 'mothers', 'determine', 'mother', 'hiding', 'killing', 'members', 'group', 'attempt', 'discover', 'identity', 'baby.The', 'Clinic', 'few', 'curve', 'balls', 'what', 'out', 'abduction', 'examination', 'maternal', 'motivations', 'test', 'survival', 'level', 'suspense', 'gore', 'increases', 'twisted', 'master', 'plan', 'featuring', 'tense', 'moments', 'including', 'one', 'attacking', 'dogs.Although', 'very', 'physically', 'active', 'women', 'somehow', 'manage', 'not', 'tear', 'open', 'recently', 'sutured', 'abdomens', 'not', 'lot', 'logic', 'involved', 'what', 'can', 'ignore', 'rather', 'large', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'really', 'crucial', 'turning', 'point', 'occurs', 'when', 'mothers', 'discover', 'six', 'infants', 'trapped', 'inside', 'wire', 'framed', 'cribs', 'instead', 'staying', 'decide', 'leave', 'order', 'try', 'determine', 'child', 'belong', 'what', 'mother', 'Even', 'pre-DNA', 'era', 'questionable', 'act', 'few', 'real', 'mothers', 'would', 'probably', 'consider.The', 'Clinic', 'uneven', 'thriller', 'overdramatic', 'conclusion', 'mixes', 'standard', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'number', 'unexpected', 'developments', 'scary', 'moments', 'decent', 'acting', '3.5', 'star', 'effort', 'watch', 'horror', 'buffs', 'too', 'many', 'pieces', 'conveniently', 'fall', 'place', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'potential']",N/A
