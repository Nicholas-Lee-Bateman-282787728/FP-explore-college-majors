And for that reason I have to disagree with the reviewer who dislikes the interspaced commentary by Otis Williams. The performances at the beginning are very dated with some in black and white.

So clear that you would think that they just filmed them a minute ago - except for the clothes of course!Each video is preceded by Otis Williams explaining how each song came to be and the events surrounding each song.  Normally I would say just give me the videos, but this was actually a good addition.  About 98% of the videos are in color and all are very clear and clean.  For those of us who were not around and view the 1960's as a period that we cannot imagine ever living in, this gives us a better idea for the period.  I still cannot get over how during the worst years of racism in the US, they would be invited to sing on TV and whites could listen to the music, but hate them for being black otherwise.  Not to mention anything else they had to go through during those times.  Funny how a lot of that died down after J Edgar Hoover died...Anyway, I would highly recommend this as it probably cannot get any clearer than this, unless they HD'd it.  Even then there may be a problem.  The sound is right and exact and I like the sound options.  This is one of the few DVD's with actual DVD features that we expected in the late 90's!  This one puts the Supremes DVD to shame and maybe whoever did this needs to do the Supremes!This disc has all of their hits and most of their performances.  There were others that I saw that did not make on here.  If they ever do a Blu Ray verison, I expect ALL peroformances since most are dead.It is too bad other material from the 60's cannot be made to look this good.  If they could, the 60's would not look so much like another dimension in time.  It is also too bad many shows did not tape in color since ot was available.

These are the Temptations as I remember seeing them as I was growing up. Even our grandchildren were enthralled with exactly seeing the real Temptations (""But they don't look like the people in the movie,"" said our six years old grandaughter). Once we explained to her that these were the real people and not actors playing parts, she just couldn't get over how good they were. They were a very talented group of young men who helped change the music industry. If I could change anything about this DVD it would be to include more selections and cut back on some of the commentary by Mr. Otis Williams. Don't get me wrong, the commentary was great, but it did kind of cut in on the selections.  My husband was especially pleased with the booklet that was included.

I received this DVD last week, and I am so truly mesmerized by the Temptations at their finest.  I watched the performance of I Wish It Would Rain 3 times this morning before leaving for work!! It's addictive.It is a privilege to see these performances in such good quality, but mostly to see these fine young men called the Temptations.  And when I say fine, I mean that in terms of dignified and classy (unlike the pitiful excuse for R&B; music that is available today).  And I am 28 years old mind you, so I wasn't even thought about when the Tempts were doing their thing, but I feel like I am right there with the studio audiences watching these beautiful performances.Their energy, their love for what they were doing, their ability to make the song scream from their hearts, and of course those untouchable dance moves make the classic line up of the Tempts (thats the line-up I love the most:)) a force to be reckoned with, for all time. I wish so badly I could have had the experience of seeing them live in the sixties.  But this video is the next best thing. What's sad is that these are apparently rare films of the performances.  Back then I guess they didn't realize the treasure they had in the making, the history they had in the making.  That this music would influence generations.

I was particularly moved with the scene where the Temps are recording with the terrific, but then unknown Funk Bros. Motown's house band who were class A musicians themselves and how simple and honest the whole performance and recording process was, without all the electronic gizmos they have to use nowadays to manufacture pop figures who don't have either the talent or the appreciation for real music these great performers had.

Groovy shows such as the Hollywood Palace, The Ed Sullivan Show (of which I have many video clips of the Tempts on VHS) and Murray the K features the Tempts doing what they are known around the world for...doing their precise movements, singing their tight harmonies AND looking good doing it!For me, the extras are what impress me, especially viewing the Tempts hard at work on SORRY IS A SORRY WORD, a taping for the CBS News segment, THE MOTOWN SOUND.Otis's interview throughout the DVD and during the bonus feature is also another highlight for me.  He was there through it all and is still around to tell us about the magic of the Temptations!The acapella section on 15 of their biggest hits continues to awe and astound me!
