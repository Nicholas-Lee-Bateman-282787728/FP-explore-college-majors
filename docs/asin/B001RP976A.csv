""Charlie""","[1, 2]","I opted to buy this from Target instead of Amazon because it was $12.99, but at only 54 minutes, this DVD really should be under $10 in my opinion.  The shorts are truly hit or miss.  You're either going to find them funny or you won't.  I got a few good laughs in, but maybe about 45% of the DVD.  If you're a fan of Family Guy or American Dad I would exercise caution before purchasing only because this doesn't trump the two shows, just adds an extension to the legacy Seth MacFarlane has created.  Family Guy fans in particular will notice some of the shorts featured are [uncut] flashback scenes (like the $25000 Pyramid short with the man and the dog, Wily E. Coyote finally killing Roadrunner, and Fred and Barney trying to get into La Deaux nightclub).  I purchased because some of the shorts were featured on the Expedia Internet ads months ago and were pretty funny (like the mad cow short), but I could've honestly borrowed or burned this from someone else or NetFlix.

1233630,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001RP976A,David J. Brown,"[8, 19]","I love Seth Mcfarlane and his writing team's sense of humor.  He's got a dirty mind and his opinions(social, pop culture, political) are all worn on his sleeve.  I love him for this.  Plus, he's made a show, Family Guy, that speaks to people my age.  All the references require one to be at least 25 years old to get.  Though, it amazes me to find even younger folks loving the show too.  Wonder what they think is so funny about it?Well, this is basically 54 minutes of shorts with nothing but dirty thoughts on its mind.  Each segement runs under a minute with a few exceptions.  Most are really funny.  Some are mildly funny.  And some are just not funny at all(the Quentin Tarantino segment pops into mind, the second segment with the Scottish man yelling at the screen does too).  It seems the Mcfarlane's writing stlye is just a stream of conciousness that bounces from the years of pop culture cultivated in his brain.  This dvd works on the same level.  It's got the Family Guy tone but it seems to want to go to places that were too abstract or too racey for broadcast television.  Hell, some of the bits seem like things they couldn't put on Family Guy.Is it funny? Sure, I thought it was funny enough for the price I paid to own it.  If you like Family Guy, then you most likely will enjoy it.  It's missing the familiar characters from that show, which helps in its humor, but it hits its targets more then it misses.Personal favorite segments are The Frog Prince, The Cats in a Board Meeting, the Sex With...segments, and the Sheep Shearing segment was hysterical.  Good luck.  Have fun.  Lighten up.

1233631,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001RP976A,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 8]","What do you get when ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane is uncensored?  You get ""CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY"", featuring mini animated shorts with unrelated characters that pushes the envelope of animated comedy that goes into sex, racism, bestiality and anything he and the writers could think of that would be crazy and offensive.  What these shorts come down to is how amusing and hilarious the story comes down to for the viewer.  Otherwise if one is easily offended, this is not for you.The shorts are featured on YouTube.com via SethComedy and is one of the most watched YouTube channels each week.  Featuring possibly over 50 or more animated shorts (some last anywhere between a minute to three-minutes long), you can expect to see the following:* Super Mario Rescues the Princess - Have you ever wondered what happens after Mario saves the princess from Bowser?  Well, in this segment, all Mario wants is a kiss for all the hard work but what happens when the princess doesn't want to?* Mountain Climber - What happens when a mountain climber needs to take a dump while climbing a mountain?* The Gay Knight - What happens when a gay knight doesn't want to fight a killer dragon?* Dracula Meets Magic Johnson - What happens when Dracula decides to go after Magic Johnson and sucks the blood from his neck?* Small Talk with Aunt Helen - A story about a guy who talks to his aunt about what he did with the frozen wedding cake he and his wife stored in the freezer.* Fred Flinstone - What kind of bodily sounds does Fred Flinstone make when he's taking a dump?* Die, Sweet Roadrunner, Die - What happens to Wiley Coyote after he succeeds in catching the roadrunner?* Name that Animal Penis! - Animals stick their penises inside a hole and contestants must know what animal the penis belongs to.* The Frog Prince - When the Princess believes that she should kiss the frog to turn into a prince, what request will this certain frog make the princess do?These are just among the few several animated shorts in ""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" with dozens more included on the DVD and Blu-ray release.VIDEO & AUDIO:""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is featured in Full Screen (1:33:1) and for those with 16:9 TV's, you will see the black bars on the side.  The video is featured in AVC @ 35 MBPS.  Because the videos were designed for the web, it's not exactly what one would expect to see on High Definition. If anything, it's quite normal and truthfully, there may not be much of a huge difference between the Blu-ray and DVD release.Colors are not necessarily vibrant for this release but knowing that the intention was not for home viewing but more for online viewing through YouTube, I was not expecting much when it comes to detail for the character designs and animation.The goal of these shorts were to entertain people online and the goal in mind was not to produce high quality animation but animation in the Seth McFarlane style but humor that is much more over the top.  So, don't expect hyper-detail, a lot of shadowing or anything like that with this release.As for audio, audio is featured in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Similar to the video, these shorts were produced strictly for online.  So, you're not going to hear an immersive soundtrack.  In fact, it's front channel, dialogue-based animation.  So, audio is clear and understandable but this is not an animated release to expect immersive audio.As for subtitles, you get the English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" comes with a free download code for people to download the first episode of ""Family Guy"", ""American Dad"" and ""Futurama"".  As for the special features on the Blu-ray disc, the following is included:* Red Carpet Premiere - (4:21) A premiere party featuring Seth MacFarlane and guests which include Seth Green (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ""Robot Chicken"", etc.), James Kyson Lee (""Heroes"") and many more.  Discussions anywhere about the meaning of ""Cavalcade"" and discussion about boobs.* Still Galleries: Character Models - An image gallery where people can use their remote and forward through over a hundreds images and see the development of the characters before and after and the final version and then afterward when the characters are colored.JUDGMENT CALL:""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is definitely hit or miss.Some will find some shorts hilarious and some will find them absolutely stupid.  For me, I found some shorts to be quite hilarious but I found it much more easier to watch them in short bursts and not watch all one after the other in one sitting.  Otherwise, the humor can get it old.I watched this with a few friends and some found it absolutely disgusting and some shorts to be hilarious but they couldn't watch it completely and felt it was too overboard for them that it was more disgusting and crude than funny.So, I think people who are familiar with Seth MacFarlane's animated series and are familiar with these shorts, will enjoy watching how far he will go in making people laugh or raise an eyebrow.  It all comes down to one's sense of humor and if you can laugh it out, that's good but otherwise, if you are serious minded, some shorts may be quite offensive.  You can read the YouTube,com comments of the shorts that you will see people on both sides who feel his ""Cavalcade"" works are enjoyable and the other side who feel otherwise.As for Blu-ray or DVD?  Personally, this is one of those releases where the Blu-ray is not far off compared to the DVD.  Aside from a 1080p transfer and DTS-HD Master Audio, ""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is not exactly a release that takes full advantage of High Definition.  If you are a Seth MacFarlane fan and you can get the Blu-ray at a low price then go for it!  Otherwise, if the DVD is much cheaper, go for the DVD.So, this release is definitely for those who found these shorts enjoyable.  I found them hilarious but then again, I'm more open to this type of lewd and naughty type of humor.  For those who are a least bit curious and enjoy ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" and are debating if they should purchase this release, my best advice is for you to check out the videos first on YouTube.com and if you enjoyed them, then this release is definitely for you.",2,It's best to watch this not at one sitting...watch a few at a time or else the humor grows old.,1243468800,"05 28,

I am someone who enjoys Robot Chicken, Family Guy, the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, etc.... I didn't even think this DVD wouldn't be something right up my alley. Boy was I wrong.The Cavalcade is similar to Robot Chicken in that everything is a series of shorts. Most attempt (and I stress attempt) to use vulgarity, sex, (you get the point) in order to get a quick laugh. The bad part is nothing is funny or well done. I'm ok with toilet humor, heck that is what I was hoping for in this DVD. What I got was the toilet without the humor. I can sum up most of the shorts as simply showing two animated characters having sex, something vulgar (but not funny) is said and then on to the next similar and still not funny short.Since I like the majority of the stuff these guys put out, I cannot explain why they so badly missed on this but they did.

The rest were just either too gross to be funny (and trust me, I love gross humor if it's done...humorously), lazy, or bland.  And why would anybody get a blu-ray disc of this?? They are just simple cartoons! Plus, I couldn't find any hidden easter eggs on here and the extras were really dumb: a still gallery and a short of his red carpet premiere of this release.

Most of them are bland and just not all that funny.  Each skit averages about 2 minutes each in duration, if that.  There are certain skits that are more watchable than others, such as skits involving Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda.  But that does not excuse the high price that you will normally see this going for, anywhere from $[...] on Amazon.com to $[...].Certain skits like the Scotsman who yells at the TV shows he's watching, or Bob Marley's confession are barely even worth a suppressed chuckle.  This has been toted as a collection of clips you can't see on TV no matter how hard you try.  It's easy to understand why.  It has also been boosted up for its unabashed, uncensored material.  You can see the same lack of censoring on later seasons of ""Family Guy"" on DVD.

1233653,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001RP976A,Mark Turner,"[6, 8]","Seth MacFarlane has become and industry into himself, just as Matt Groening did when he brought the world THE SIMPSONS. MacFarlane has ingratiated himself into the world of television fandom with his series FAMILY GUY. In an attempt to not limit himself to one thing, he's decided to make something new, a skit based direct to DVD release called SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY.With a title like that it's hard not to go in expecting the funniest thing since...well what ever you think of as the funniest thing. I mean some laugh at jokes while others laugh at skateboarders breaking an arm. For MacFarlane this release is just like his series in that it gives some tremendous laughs at times and some jokes that start off as unfunny and turn into items that are dragged out far too long. Not only that, his penchant for attempting to offend someone somewhere along the line is blatantly obvious in more than one skit.Each skit is offered with black screen title cards letting you know what is coming. And given the chance to break free of the bonds of television censors, MacFarlane does just that in spades. A sample would be a skit that revolves around a group of animals in the forest who have had it with the most obnoxious creature there they know, the bad boy of the woods, the beaver. After arguing with one and calling him out on several issues of bad behavior, they call him a vagina. And afterwards decide that yes, using his name to represent the other seems fit. If you don't get the reference don't ask. You will be one of those people who don't get offended but at the same time doesn't get most dirty jokes when told.Skits involving the act of sex with various celebrities or people are some of the funnier moments found. Again, they might be a bit more than most youngsters should see let alone understand, but for adults you'll get a laugh out of them. Most notable are ""Sex with Mr. Sulu"", ""Sex with Optimus Prime"" and ""Sex with a Tube of Toothpaste"".Jokes involving excrement, 5 foot nipples, horny frogs and more are offered here. And while some are actually funny, most run the usual level of grade school humor that we all laughed about when young but hate to admit to these days. Still, a few can bring a chuckle now and then.Among the good is a piece where Wile E. Coyote actually catches the road runner. What happens after answers a question few have ever considered. Among the bad is a Scotsman who feels the need to comment on every movie he watches, the far too long piece referred to earlier.For those who are truly easily offended, watch out for the skit involving fat Jesus which has an obese Jesus to busy discussing his gastrointestinal problems to heal a dying man brought before him. As I said, to me it seemed that MacFarlane was taking aim at what he considers easy targets with the hope of offending as opposed to offering a bit higher level of humor than usual.While I love FAMILY GUY, even when it tosses in those questionable moments, this one offers fewer laughs per minute than the series does. Just because the opportunity to break free of the reins of limited censorship arise doesn't mean that you can make something funny without the restrictions. Offensive or insulting don't always make humor. And preaching to folks with similar opinions doesn't mean the jokes are funny. It's like making your friends laugh at a personal joke. You and your friends might get it, but the rest of the world won't.Strange as it may seem from these statements I can still find humor in this release to DVD. My only problem is that I think there is something better, something funnier, still to be mined from the brain of Seth MacFarlane. My wish is that he attempt to take that route rather than the easy one next time.",2,"THREE BEAR COMEDY: TOO HOT, TOO COLD, JUST RIGHT",1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3765,"['Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'become', 'industry', 'just', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'did', 'when', 'brought', 'world', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'MacFarlane', 'ingratiated', 'world', 'television', 'fandom', 'series', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'attempt', 'not', 'limit', 'one', 'thing', 'decided', 'make', 'something', 'new', 'skit', 'based', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'called', 'SETH', 'MACFARLANE', 'CAVALCADE', 'OF', 'CARTOON', 'COMEDY.With', 'title', 'hard', 'not', 'go', 'expecting', 'funniest', 'thing', 'well', 'what', 'ever', 'think', 'funniest', 'thing', 'mean', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'others', 'laugh', 'skateboarders', 'breaking', 'arm', 'MacFarlane', 'release', 'just', 'series', 'tremendous', 'laughs', 'times', 'jokes', 'start', 'unfunny', 'turn', 'items', 'are', 'dragged', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Not', 'only', 'penchant', 'attempting', 'offend', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'line', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'more', 'one', 'skit.Each', 'skit', 'offered', 'black', 'screen', 'title', 'cards', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'given', 'chance', 'break', 'free', 'bonds', 'television', 'censors', 'MacFarlane', 'just', 'spades', 'sample', 'would', 'be', 'skit', 'group', 'animals', 'forest', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'creature', 'know', 'bad', 'boy', 'woods', 'beaver', 'arguing', 'one', 'calling', 'out', 'several', 'issues', 'bad', 'behavior', 'call', 'vagina', 'afterwards', 'decide', 'yes', 'using', 'name', 'represent', 'other', 'fit', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'reference', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'offended', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'when', 'told.Skits', 'involving', 'act', 'sex', 'various', 'celebrities', 'people', 'are', 'funnier', 'moments', 'found', 'Again', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'most', 'youngsters', 'should', 'see', 'let', 'alone', 'understand', 'adults', ""'ll"", 'get', 'laugh', 'Most', 'notable', 'are', 'Sex', 'Mr.', 'Sulu', 'Sex', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Sex', 'Tube', 'Toothpaste', 'involving', 'excrement', '5', 'foot', 'nipples', 'horny', 'frogs', 'more', 'are', 'offered', 'here', 'are', 'actually', 'funny', 'most', 'run', 'usual', 'level', 'grade', 'school', 'humor', 'laughed', 'when', 'young', 'hate', 'admit', 'days', 'Still', 'few', 'can', 'bring', 'chuckle', 'now', 'then.Among', 'good', 'piece', 'where', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'actually', 'road', 'runner', 'What', 'answers', 'question', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'considered', 'bad', 'Scotsman', 'who', 'need', 'comment', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'piece', 'referred', 'earlier.For', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'easily', 'offended', 'watch', 'out', 'skit', 'involving', 'fat', 'Jesus', 'obese', 'Jesus', 'busy', 'discussing', 'gastrointestinal', 'problems', 'heal', 'dying', 'man', 'brought', 'said', 'seemed', 'MacFarlane', 'was', 'taking', 'aim', 'what', 'easy', 'targets', 'hope', 'offending', 'opposed', 'offering', 'bit', 'higher', 'level', 'humor', 'usual.While', 'love', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'even', 'when', 'questionable', 'moments', 'one', 'fewer', 'laughs', 'minute', 'series', 'Just', 'opportunity', 'break', 'free', 'reins', 'limited', 'censorship', 'arise', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'make', 'something', 'funny', 'restrictions', 'Offensive', 'insulting', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'humor', 'preaching', 'folks', 'similar', 'opinions', ""n't"", 'mean', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'making', 'friends', 'laugh', 'personal', 'joke', 'friends', 'might', 'get', 'rest', 'world', ""won't.Strange"", 'may', 'seem', 'statements', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'humor', 'release', 'DVD', 'only', 'problem', 'think', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'funnier', 'still', 'be', 'mined', 'brain', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'wish', 'take', 'route', 'rather', 'easy', 'one', 'next', 'time']",Seth Macfarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy

Well, chances are that there is a good handful of these scenes that will make you laugh until you wet your pants, but there are also scenes that are either pointless or to the point of gut-wrenchingly awful.

It's hard...","[3, 4]","WatchingFamily Guy Presents: Something Something Something Dark Sidelast week, I saw the promo for this show, was highly intrigued by the prospect of Family Guy-like characters truly let loose and uncensored, so I ordered it through Netflix.  And Jeebus H. Krist on a vibrating pogo stick--this thing is awful, just absolutely, completely, every stinking bit, head-shakingly bad.My only guess as to how a series of 30-odd ""comedy"" vignettes this repetitive, derivative, scatological and just plain stupid actually can get produced and distributed is that Seth MacFarlane's ego and more importantly his wallet are so big and powerful that literally no one can stop him now.  It started with that not quite equally bad (but close) ""Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show"" on Fox.  I mean,Family Guyis really funny, yeah, but who in the name of Grandma's famous basted turkey breast wants to hear MacFarlane croon ""Edelweiss?""  That's not ironically funny, or even funnily ironic; it's just base indulgence, and we all suffer for it.  Apparently no one has the courage to tell MacFarlane that this ""comedy"" emperor has no clothes.This show is not a Family Guy spin-off; there is no relationship whatsoever.  There are more than enough characters who've got the stock, Brian-like voice, and there's one very, very stupid sketch in which a massively overweight Jesus looks exactly like Peter Griffin, but that's about it.Man, does Seth MacFarlane have a thing for feces.  From the very first bit, and sprinkled liberally throughout the show, you get quite a bit of it.  And MacFarlane digs FredFlintstone, too, and unfortunately Fred and feces come together in one of the worst sketches of this collection, a scatological eternity waiting for a punch line that never comes.More than anything, this show is just raw, without being funny.  Now, raw can be funny; witness theJackassofferings.  You get a lot of profanity in this show, as if just having cartoons uttering goofy strings of hard-core obscenities in itself is something funny.  Not quite.  Now, the delicately inserted obscenity, even if really filthy, with the right timing, in the right comedic environment, by the right character, can be really funny--most recentlyStep Brothersgave us quite a few of those, not least Mary Steenbergen dropping the F-bomb.  But here, the profanity is forced and awkward, as if someone had given the writing direction, ""Okay, let's put lots of swear words in here so, you know, it'll be really dirty and funny and stuff.""The special features consist only of a poorly produced, ultra-lame ""documentary"" of the ""gala premiere"" of this video.  It's McFarlane and his fellow ""actors"" responsible for this thing larfing it up and being smug and wacky at some West Hollywood bar (Seth Green shows up, and with a full beard and hat pulled way down tight, looking strangely like Woody Allen's Castro persona fromBananas).  Lame.  The only other special feature is a series of stills from the show, which actually aren't quite bad, and are more or less presentable in public.  The only value these could have would be for a computer desktop.Bottom line: If you're a Family Guy fan, don't bother, as this thing has nothing to do with the show, other than its production paternity.  If you dig really low-brow toilet humor, and obscenity-laced doody gags that go on interminably, then this is the one for you.",1,Awful,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,3407,"['WatchingFamily', 'Guy', 'Presents', 'Something', 'Something', 'Something', 'Dark', 'Sidelast', 'week', 'saw', 'promo', 'show', 'was', 'highly', 'intrigued', 'prospect', 'Family', 'Guy-like', 'characters', 'truly', 'let', 'loose', 'uncensored', 'ordered', 'Netflix', 'Jeebus', 'H.', 'Krist', 'vibrating', 'pogo', 'stick', 'thing', 'awful', 'just', 'absolutely', 'completely', 'stinking', 'bit', 'head-shakingly', 'only', 'guess', 'how', 'series', '30-odd', 'comedy', 'repetitive', 'derivative', 'scatological', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'actually', 'can', 'get', 'produced', 'distributed', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'ego', 'more', 'importantly', 'wallet', 'are', 'so', 'big', 'powerful', 'literally', 'one', 'can', 'stop', 'now', 'started', 'not', 'quite', 'equally', 'bad', 'close', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Presents', 'Seth', 'Alex', 'Almost', 'Live', 'Comedy', 'Show', 'Fox', 'mean', 'Family', 'Guyis', 'really', 'funny', 'yeah', 'who', 'name', 'Grandma', 'famous', 'basted', 'turkey', 'breast', 'hear', 'MacFarlane', 'croon', 'Edelweiss', 'not', 'ironically', 'funny', 'even', 'funnily', 'ironic', 'just', 'base', 'indulgence', 'suffer', 'Apparently', 'one', 'courage', 'tell', 'MacFarlane', 'comedy', 'emperor', 'clothes.This', 'show', 'not', 'Family', 'Guy', 'spin-off', 'relationship', 'whatsoever', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'characters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stock', 'Brian-like', 'voice', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'stupid', 'sketch', 'massively', 'overweight', 'Jesus', 'exactly', 'like', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'it.Man', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'have', 'thing', 'feces', 'very', 'first', 'bit', 'sprinkled', 'liberally', 'show', 'get', 'quite', 'bit', 'MacFarlane', 'digs', 'FredFlintstone', 'too', 'unfortunately', 'Fred', 'feces', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'worst', 'sketches', 'collection', 'scatological', 'eternity', 'waiting', 'punch', 'line', 'never', 'comes.More', 'anything', 'show', 'just', 'raw', 'being', 'funny', 'Now', 'raw', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'witness', 'theJackassofferings', 'get', 'lot', 'profanity', 'show', 'just', 'having', 'cartoons', 'uttering', 'goofy', 'strings', 'hard-core', 'obscenities', 'something', 'funny', 'Not', 'quite', 'Now', 'delicately', 'inserted', 'obscenity', 'even', 'really', 'filthy', 'right', 'timing', 'right', 'comedic', 'environment', 'right', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'most', 'recentlyStep', 'Brothersgave', 'quite', 'few', 'not', 'least', 'Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'dropping', 'F-bomb', 'here', 'profanity', 'forced', 'awkward', 'someone', 'had', 'given', 'writing', 'direction', 'Okay', 'let', 'put', 'lots', 'swear', 'words', 'here', 'so', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'dirty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'special', 'features', 'consist', 'only', 'poorly', 'produced', 'ultra-lame', 'documentary', 'gala', 'premiere', 'video', 'McFarlane', 'fellow', 'actors', 'responsible', 'thing', 'larfing', 'up', 'being', 'smug', 'wacky', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'bar', 'Seth', 'Green', 'up', 'full', 'beard', 'hat', 'pulled', 'way', 'down', 'tight', 'looking', 'strangely', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Castro', 'persona', 'fromBananas', 'Lame', 'only', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'series', 'stills', 'show', 'actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'presentable', 'public', 'only', 'value', 'could', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'computer', 'desktop.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'thing', 'nothing', 'do', 'show', 'other', 'production', 'paternity', 'dig', 'really', 'low-brow', 'toilet', 'humor', 'obscenity-laced', 'doody', 'gags', 'go', 'interminably', 'then', 'one']",Seth Macfarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy

(1) It not HD so why bother with BluRay?  (2)It's not wide screen, it's 4:3.  (3) It's encoded with 7.1 DTS MA.  Guess what, it's realy only stereo.  Now to the cartoon shorts.  Not even a chuckle.  I kept advancing chapters hoping to find something funny.  Nada.  So save your money and let Amazon keep this disk on thier shelves. Shame on you Seth for turning this out with the ""From the creator of Family Guy & American Dad"" as a selling point.

There def were some that were rather funny and clever (if you like Seth MacFarlane of course). But a good portion of them were just gross, annoying, or kind of stupid. And while it goes along with the territory sometimes the lack of variety in his cartoons' voices gets a bit annoying. I mean, for one guy he's got a pretty good range...but even then the voices tend to repeat a lot. It did get some good laughs, but it's def not worth $15. I paid a cheaper price for it here on Amazon but you're better off just looking up the few good bits of this DVD on youtube rather than buying it.",3,Eh...it's all right.

1233665,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B001RP976A,Wicked_Smaht,"[1, 1]","Sure, it's probably unfair to compare these shorts to Family Guy, but truth be told, if you're thinking of picking this up, it's because you love Family Guy, so the comparison is inevitable. Ultimately, this DVD will only appeal to hard-core fans of Seth MacFarlane. What you get is a series of shorts that barely approach an hour long and are mostly lacking in the ""comedy"" portion of the product's title. Many reviewers have noted that the format follows that of the cutaways of a typical Family Guy episode, but these aren't really Family Guy material (and you really shouldn't be expecting Family Guy-esque humor from this set of shorts - this set is a different sort of beast). Most of these shorts rely on lazy writing and the shock value of being uncensored which somehow excuses the shorts from actually having to be funny. Admittedly, there's about 5 or 6 amusing bits, but realistically, it's not like you can't find those on YouTube and the likelihood that you'll rewatch this entire DVD to get to the 5 or 6 amusing bits is slim to none. Overall, it's a bad return on investment unless you're the sort who feels that Seth can do no wrong. To be honest, I would recommend renting this if you feel you HAVE to see this. If you still feel it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, then go ahead and buy it, otherwise you'll feel cheated no matter what price they put on this thing. Unfortunately, that's the ugly truth concerning this thing.
