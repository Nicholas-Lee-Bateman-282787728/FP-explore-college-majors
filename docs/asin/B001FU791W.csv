This is just one big advertisement for getting stoned.  I actually felt embarrassed for the actors.  What were they thinking?!  As for the writer and director, well I have my own theories about where they got their ""inspiration"" for this story.  I've watched my fair share of surfing movies, and they run the gamut from corny to nostalgia to documentary, appealing to people casually interested in the sport, to die hard surfing addicts.

1192377,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B001FU791W,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 2/12Rate: 82/12: Surfer, Dude is an enjoyable light fare of a film that was unfairly panned by critics. I found it to be akin to Easy Rider but not as deep as I hoped. It was a good film to watch regardless. Matthew McConaughey is a very talented actor, and it was a perfect piece for him. I loved the re-teaming of him with Woody Harrelson, bringing back the good ole memories from EdTV. Making it even better is Willie Nelson. It is sort of The Endless Summer for them except there is very little surfing involved. Mostly, it is just a lot of ganja smoking, being stoked, plenty of goat farming, some didgeridoo involved, and rolling in with the times (flashback to Dave Wooderson's scenes). So, that's why it worked for me, and the length of the picture is pretty decent too. All in all, Surfer, Dude is actually a good film because it does have a message about money is the root of all evils and how people want to be independent, away from control and puppeteering. I totally understand what's it like to go to a beach and see flat waves. Either people get the film or they don't.

1192380,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B001FU791W,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[4, 8]","Wow, I really was hoping for so much more.  Is this the same Matthew McConaughey who took on the screenplays Amistad, A Time to Kill, and We Are Marshall?  Now I have to be completely honest.  There are only three movies that I could not make it through the first hour of the film: Dune, Moonstruck, and now this atrocity in movie making - Surfer, Dude.The first 30-minutes of Surfer, Dude is so bad that I had to actually squint my eyes to see if that helped things become more bearable.  It didn't.  McConaughey's character is offered a whole lot of money to live in a beautiful home, hang out with beautiful women, and surf as part of a reality show competition, and he wants no part of it.  That makes Surfer, Dude one of the most unbelievable and stupid scripts ever written.  A huge cast couldn't even rescue this film from the depths of Ignorance Ocean!From this day forward, I will look for the names of writers S.R. Bindler and Cory Van Dyke on every movie I rent or buy, and then I will avoid that selection like the plague.  If you are still thinking about buying or watching or renting this movie, just close your eyes and picture naked women, lots of pot smoking, and Willie Nelson hanging out with goats...then rent or buy something else, cause you've already seen Surfer, Dude.This movie is a COMPLETE and UTTER WIPEOUT!See ya next review!",1,A Complete Wipeout - And Not In A Good Way!,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1354,"['Wow', 'really', 'was', 'hoping', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'same', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'took', 'screenplays', 'Amistad', 'A', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Are', 'Now', 'have', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'Dune', 'Moonstruck', 'now', 'atrocity', 'movie', 'making', 'Surfer', 'Dude.The', 'first', '30-minutes', 'Surfer', 'Dude', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'actually', 'squint', 'eyes', 'see', 'helped', 'things', 'become', 'more', 'bearable', 'did', ""n't"", 'McConaughey', 'character', 'offered', 'whole', 'lot', 'money', 'live', 'beautiful', 'home', 'hang', 'out', 'beautiful', 'women', 'surf', 'part', 'reality', 'show', 'competition', 'part', 'Surfer', 'Dude', 'one', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'stupid', 'scripts', 'ever', 'written', 'huge', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'rescue', 'film', 'depths', 'Ignorance', 'Ocean', 'day', 'forward', 'will', 'look', 'names', 'writers', 'S.R', 'Bindler', 'Cory', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'movie', 'rent', 'buy', 'then', 'will', 'avoid', 'selection', 'plague', 'are', 'still', 'thinking', 'buying', 'watching', 'renting', 'movie', 'just', 'close', 'eyes', 'picture', 'naked', 'women', 'lots', 'pot', 'smoking', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'hanging', 'out', 'goats', 'then', 'rent', 'buy', 'something', 'else', 'cause', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Surfer', 'Dude.This', 'movie', 'COMPLETE', 'UTTER', 'WIPEOUT', 'See', 'ya', 'next', 'review']",N/A
1192381,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001FU791W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","This movie is about 45 minutes too long. The opening say 20 minutes is really not half bad; the editing is kind of tight, the story moves along pretty well, and it's not bad. Just after the pool party scenes with a lot of fine jiggling going on, the film jumps the shark badly. The story grinds to a halt, we're blugeoned with no waves for some huge number of days, and our surfer dude fasts; as if the world does rotate around him. There's some good moments with Add (Matthew McConaughey), Danni (the beautiful Alexie Gilmore), and Willie Nelson. But that about does it. The ending, totally predictable, you can see that one a thousand miles away. Cut to about 20 minutes before the end of the film, and there you have it, a 45 minute film that is just not too bad.Willie Nelson as a goat farmer kind of surprised me. He's been just pitiful in other movies. Willie is probably playing himself in this movie, he shines as Willie the wheat grass smoker. Alexie Gilmore was a stand out in the females, she might be known as a doctor on Fox's New Amsterdam. Woody Harrelson was just pathetic as the burned out manager. The rest of the supporting cast just didn't really cut it for me.If you watch this movie with really low expectations, you will not be disappointed. But have the fast forward button handy.There is one of the oddest things I've ever seen in a movie. The credits start to roll with 12 minutes to go on the DVD (that normally happens around 4 to 6 minutes to go). During the roll the viewer is treated to movies of goats. The credits finish with about 3 minutes to go and some really lame movie starts up. It's some Japanese business men that ask Add to use their surfboard and they will film him surfing. Somehow Add crashes, the board breaks, Add ends up on the beach, and Woody Harrelon says, ""so if you only made one, what were you going to sell?"" The end. Yes it was weird.This film is definately R rated. There is a ton of nudity including Matthew McConaughey full frontal nude, language, and shall we say ""herbal cigarette"" use. After the 1.5 hours, I didn't even look at the bonus features on the DVD, it's hard to imagine what more I would want to watch about this film.Even with the naked bodies, this is just too long.",2,Wayyyy Tooo Lonngggg,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2242,"['movie', '45', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'opening', 'say', '20', 'minutes', 'really', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'editing', 'kind', 'tight', 'story', 'moves', 'pretty', 'well', 'not', 'bad', 'Just', 'pool', 'party', 'scenes', 'lot', 'fine', 'jiggling', 'going', 'film', 'shark', 'badly', 'story', 'halt', ""'re"", 'blugeoned', 'waves', 'huge', 'number', 'days', 'surfer', 'dude', 'fasts', 'world', 'rotate', 'good', 'moments', 'Add', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Danni', 'beautiful', 'Alexie', 'Gilmore', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'about', 'ending', 'totally', 'predictable', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'Cut', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'film', 'there', 'have', '45', 'minute', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'too', 'bad.Willie', 'Nelson', 'goat', 'farmer', 'kind', 'surprised', 'been', 'just', 'pitiful', 'other', 'movies', 'Willie', 'probably', 'playing', 'movie', 'Willie', 'wheat', 'grass', 'smoker', 'Alexie', 'Gilmore', 'was', 'stand', 'out', 'females', 'might', 'be', 'known', 'doctor', 'Fox', 'New', 'Amsterdam', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'just', 'pathetic', 'burned', 'out', 'manager', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'cut', 'me.If', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'low', 'expectations', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'one', 'oddest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', '12', 'minutes', 'go', 'DVD', 'normally', 'around', '4', '6', 'minutes', 'go', 'roll', 'viewer', 'treated', 'movies', 'goats', 'credits', 'finish', '3', 'minutes', 'go', 'really', 'lame', 'movie', 'up', 'Japanese', 'business', 'men', 'ask', 'Add', 'use', 'surfboard', 'will', 'film', 'surfing', 'Somehow', 'Add', 'crashes', 'board', 'breaks', 'Add', 'up', 'beach', 'Woody', 'Harrelon', 'so', 'only', 'made', 'one', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'sell', 'end', 'Yes', 'was', 'weird.This', 'film', 'definately', 'R', 'rated', 'ton', 'nudity', 'including', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'language', 'shall', 'say', 'herbal', 'cigarette', 'use', '1.5', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'more', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'film.Even', 'naked', 'bodies', 'just', 'too', 'long']",N/A

The 7 Jan 09 5 star review is very telling.I quote ""McConaughey gives performance of his career..., January 7, 2009"" and ""Now, it's even being rumored that Matthew McConaughey (The Wedding Planner, Fool's Gold) may score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of legendary soul surfer Steve Addington. Some critics even speculate an Oscar sweep, including but not limited to, a 'Best Supporting Actor' to Harrelson and 'Best Achievement in Directing' to Bindler.(Amazon should receive some sort of payment for this under the radar advertising.)This movie was an attack upon my intelligence. If it intended to display just how morally bankrupt the movie industry has become it succeeded. I was insulted by this movie; I am outraged by the complete decay which has occurred within the film industry. Hollywood has become a sewer line pumping brain death into the culture of this country. Why would someone even think to make a movie like this? I cannot believe an excellent actor such as McConaughey would stoop to the level of appearing in or let alone being the star of this garbage can production.This movie portrays drug use as normal behavior. Did anyone notice the BBQ seen where small toddlers and children are playing among the adults while they are using drugs?  Parents protect your kids. Don't let them watch this garbage. Don't lose them to the drug culture which is destroying the souls, minds, and lives of our children. Protect them from the corrupting influence of Hollywood which is destroying the very fabric of the American family. Do you want your children to become Heath Ledgers or Lindsey Lohans? Do you think the parents of Paris Hilton are proud of their little baby girl?Between the pornification of our youth and the mainstreaming of ""If it feels good do it"" mentality, Hollywood has once again demonstrated its total commitment to the destruction of good values and morals.",1,This movie is mind rot of the bassist level.,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,1969,"['Marty', 'DieBergi', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'agent', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', '7', 'Jan', '09', '5', 'star', 'review', 'very', 'telling.I', 'quote', 'McConaughey', 'performance', 'career', 'January', '7', '2009', 'Now', 'even', 'being', 'rumored', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Fool', 'Gold', 'may', 'score', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'legendary', 'soul', 'surfer', 'Steve', 'Addington', 'critics', 'even', 'speculate', 'Oscar', 'sweep', 'including', 'not', 'limited', ""'Best"", 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Harrelson', ""'Best"", 'Achievement', 'Directing', 'Bindler', 'Amazon', 'should', 'receive', 'sort', 'payment', 'radar', 'advertising', 'movie', 'was', 'attack', 'intelligence', 'intended', 'display', 'just', 'how', 'morally', 'movie', 'industry', 'become', 'succeeded', 'was', 'insulted', 'movie', 'am', 'outraged', 'complete', 'decay', 'occurred', 'film', 'industry', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'sewer', 'line', 'pumping', 'brain', 'death', 'culture', 'country', 'Why', 'would', 'someone', 'even', 'think', 'make', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'excellent', 'actor', 'such', 'McConaughey', 'would', 'stoop', 'level', 'appearing', 'let', 'alone', 'being', 'star', 'garbage', 'can', 'production.This', 'movie', 'portrays', 'drug', 'use', 'normal', 'behavior', 'Did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'BBQ', 'seen', 'where', 'small', 'toddlers', 'children', 'are', 'playing', 'adults', 'are', 'using', 'drugs', 'Parents', 'protect', 'kids', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'watch', 'garbage', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'drug', 'culture', 'destroying', 'souls', 'minds', 'lives', 'children', 'Protect', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'Hollywood', 'destroying', 'very', 'fabric', 'American', 'family', 'Do', 'want', 'children', 'become', 'Heath', 'Ledgers', 'Lindsey', 'Lohans', 'Do', 'think', 'parents', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'are', 'proud', 'little', 'baby', 'girl', 'pornification', 'youth', 'mainstreaming', 'good', 'do', 'mentality', 'Hollywood', 'once', 'again', 'demonstrated', 'total', 'commitment', 'destruction', 'good', 'values', 'morals']",N/A

Matthew McConaughey is absolutely brilliant as So Cal surf legend Steve Addington. A modern day stoner Buddha seeking enlightenment thru the meditation of carving waves, riding girls, and sipping doobage. McConaughey walks thru almost the entire film shirtless and barefooted, wearing only a pair of baggies. Even when McConaughey is just walking down the street, he's surfing. He's like a fish out of water, brah. His swaggering swaybacked bowlegged performance is fully righteous. And, totally funny. (Not quite, but almost as good as his role as Wooderson in DAZED AND CONFUSED.) His performance is DEAD ON TUBULAR. (Ladies, you're gonna want his bod.)Obviously, this film is not for everyone. But, this short comedy is rife with religious and aesthetic symbolism. I was stoked by its heaviosity, brah.Like an aesthetic Christ, The Addman is a free spirited surfer, baptized in The Ocean, who cares nothing for the material world of money and fame. He seeks only religious adoration and worship of God thru The Living Wave, The Sacramental smoke of The Wisdom Weed, and The Unification of The One Body thru sexual concourse with chicks. Upon returning home after being away from Cali on a surfing sojourn, Addington is tempted by The Devil into a starring role on a TV Reality Show about surfers, ala Big Brother, and a chance to profit from his digital image in a virtual reality game called FREE SURFER. Representing Lucifer, ex-surfer and evil TV producer Eddie Zarno (Jeffrey Nordling) entices The Addman with a totally humongous bag of sheckles. ""We own his image. And his image is reality."" But, Addington is hip to the fact that the illusion is transitory and meaningless. While contemplating a monitor of virtual tropical fish in Zarno's beachhouse studio, The Addman poses this saltwatery Zen koan: ""Something's wrong with these fish, dude."" No way, brah. The Addman refuses to sell his soul to The Devil for material gain. ""I'm not some _ssclown in a greenroom. I'm a surfer, dude.""For what does it profit a dude to gain the world, and lose his wave?The Devil metaphorically breaks The Addman's skeg, and there is a sudden drought of waves. ""Something's bogus, dudes."" Totally like Christ, The Addman wanders the desert beaches in prayer, for MORE than 40 days and nights, fasting from the pleasures of The Scented Lotus Blossom and the sustenance of The Good Green, until God's return on The Waves of Everlasting Life Giving Water. It's The Addman's Dark Night of The Soul, man. BRAH?! Why hast thou forsaken, dude?!Willie Nelson as John The Baptist, who passes his shepherd's rod to The Addman. Will Addington become The Good Shepherd of The Goats? Yay, though I surf through the barrel of the shadow of death I will fear no shark infested waters, for thy rod and thy board they confront me, dude.Who else but Woody Harrelson, as The Apostle Peter and The Addman's dope smoking manager? ""We got financial worries, brah.""Will the Addman sacrifice himself on The Cross of Virtual Surfboard to save the souls of his brahs? You grommets should ask yourselves only one question: WHAT WOULD THE ADDMAN DO?A perfect Double Feature alongside Swayze's POINT BREAK. Funny, symbolic, and full of topless chicks and bud. (Bitchin'!) This film is defintely worth the rent for Matthew McConaughey's performance, and for all the stoner surfer aesthetes out there. It's like THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST for surfers, dude.
