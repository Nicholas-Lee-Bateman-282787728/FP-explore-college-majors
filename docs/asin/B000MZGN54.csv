This is a story that puts me in a tailspin - Rosalind Franklin discovered the structure of life. Three scientists, unbeknownst to her, used her data and discoveries, published their work, gave her no credit - and then used this (her) work to go on and win the Nobel prize! If there ever is a time when the world needs to ask the Nobel committee to rescind the prize it is now. Bottom line, Photo 51 was the basis of everything - all the modeling, the antiparallel strands, the base pairing predictions, the 10 base pairs per turn. Without Roaslind's work there was no data/ modeling/ predictions of structure and no Nobel prize for Watson, Crick & MauriceShame on you Watson & Crick!If you find this documentary interesting read 'Rosalind Franklin and DNA'.",5,PLAGIARISM WINS - a heartbreaking story!,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,846,"['moniker', 'am', 'scientist', 'specifically', 'work', 'DNA', 'pharmacology', 'story', 'tailspin', 'Rosalind', 'Franklin', 'discovered', 'structure', 'life', 'Three', 'scientists', 'unbeknownst', 'used', 'data', 'discoveries', 'published', 'work', 'gave', 'credit', 'then', 'used', 'work', 'go', 'win', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'ever', 'time', 'when', 'world', 'ask', 'Nobel', 'committee', 'rescind', 'prize', 'now', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Photo', '51', 'was', 'basis', 'everything', 'modeling', 'antiparallel', 'strands', 'base', 'pairing', 'predictions', '10', 'base', 'pairs', 'turn', 'Roaslind', 'work', 'there', 'was', 'data/', 'modeling/', 'predictions', 'structure', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'Watson', 'Crick', 'MauriceShame', 'Watson', 'Crick', 'find', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'read', 'Franklin', 'DNA']",NOVA: DNA - Secret of Photo 51

James Watson and Francis Crick, gaining access to a key piece of her research (Photo 51), managed to solve the puzzle of the shape and nature of DNA's structure.This DVD discusses the poor treatement of Franklin in Watson's later memoir and the fact that she was not mentioned when Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins (Franklin's coworker) accepted the Nobel prize for their work on DNA.

1052146,A3THSGE4JMQRJC,B000MZGN54,James M,"[2, 3]","This is a very good presentation and a good revision of the presentation of Rosalind Franklin's importance and character; it is particularly important given the way she is presented in James Watson's Double Helix.That said, I don't know if we need to portray Watson as a ""villain"", which almost seems to be the objective of this video at times. Watson and Crick had access to Ms. Franklin's data without her knowing but that is not the same as saying Watson and Crick were plagarists (which almost seems to be the take-home message some Amazon reviewers have been left with).Had Ms. Franklin published Photo 51 in a journal, perhaps some other chemist (such as Mr. Pauling in the states) might have figured out the chemical structure first. In that sense, all the ""naughty"" behaviour might be partly seen as an attempt to be sure that a british lab got the credit not an american one. It is certainly very unjust that Ms. Franklin did not get proper credit or that she was portrayed as she was by Watson in his book the Double Helix.It is not the first or last time that everyone who made a key contribution to a discovery did not receive proper credit. It is also fair to suggest that Watson's book is shown to be in even worse taste than one might have thought. The desire to portray Mr. Watson as a villain seems out of place and may stem from the same desire for a simplistic narrative which may have motivated Mr Watson to write the story as he did in the first place.",5,Giving credit where credit is due,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1473,"['very', 'good', 'presentation', 'good', 'revision', 'presentation', 'Rosalind', 'Franklin', 'importance', 'character', 'particularly', 'important', 'given', 'way', 'presented', 'James', 'Watson', 'Double', 'Helix.That', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'need', 'portray', 'Watson', 'villain', 'almost', 'be', 'objective', 'video', 'times', 'Watson', 'Crick', 'had', 'access', 'Ms.', 'Franklin', 'data', 'knowing', 'not', 'same', 'saying', 'Watson', 'Crick', 'were', 'plagarists', 'almost', 'be', 'take-home', 'message', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'left', '.Had', 'Ms.', 'Franklin', 'published', 'Photo', '51', 'journal', 'perhaps', 'other', 'chemist', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Pauling', 'states', 'might', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'chemical', 'structure', 'first', 'sense', 'naughty', 'behaviour', 'might', 'be', 'partly', 'seen', 'attempt', 'be', 'sure', 'british', 'lab', 'got', 'credit', 'not', 'american', 'one', 'certainly', 'very', 'unjust', 'Ms.', 'Franklin', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'proper', 'credit', 'was', 'portrayed', 'was', 'Watson', 'book', 'Double', 'Helix.It', 'not', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'everyone', 'who', 'made', 'key', 'contribution', 'discovery', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'proper', 'credit', 'also', 'fair', 'suggest', 'Watson', 'book', 'shown', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'taste', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'desire', 'portray', 'Mr.', 'Watson', 'villain', 'place', 'may', 'stem', 'same', 'desire', 'simplistic', 'narrative', 'may', 'have', 'motivated', 'Mr', 'Watson', 'write', 'story', 'did', 'first', 'place']",NOVA: DNA - Secret of Photo 51
1052147,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000MZGN54,Jeffery Mingo,"[10, 19]","Male scientists steal a female scientist's DNA work.  They call her diminutives behind her back.  They portray her as a shrew in their biographical book.  They act as if she were a trivial part of their publications.  Still, they win Nobel Prizes and she dies before the age of 40.  In the same way that my pro-feminist sensibilities made it difficult to watch the film ""North Country,"" it was very painful to watch the oppression described in this documentary.This is very important for all female scientists to see.  Like the Curies, R. Franklin's research may have played a role in her death.  Though non-religious, R. Franklin was a Jewish woman and there is a Hebrew phrase written on her gravesite.  Perhaps, she can be deemed an important figure in Jewish women's history texts and lists.  I really hope that feminists, in Britain and across the globe, can organize to get Dr. Franklin a posthumous Nobel.The work has female and male interviewees.  The work conspicuously states that Sigourney Weaver narrates.  Though her voice is recognizable, I didn't feel that Lt. Ellen Ripley was speaking to me as the actress told the facts.Scientists often imply that they are beyond oppression and interpersonal matters.  However, the history of science is marked with much sexism, racism, and other prejudices.
