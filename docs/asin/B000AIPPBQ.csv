926961,A38WJYEMGT0DTA,B000AIPPBQ,Joanna,"[6, 6]","This bittersweet exploration of the emotional collapse of two families due to a horrible accident is raw, gritty, heartbreaking and truly shattering, and I highly recommend it - although it's not at all easy to sit through.Multiple viewings only make this film stronger, and no one walks away from the horrible wreckage of these two breakups unscarred. Nicholaj Lie Kaas and Mads Mikkelsen (a terrific duo) play a young man paralized in a car accident and a doctor who is partially resposible for his fate - his spouse was driving the other car. As the stress of the painful situation causes everyone to emotionally and physically fall apart - noone is truly innocent or completely guilty in this tragedy - the levels of abuse and denial inflicted upon the various members of the two families is gut wrenching and truthful, whether the actions come through shock, thoughtless dependence or neediness manifested as passion. Mads Mikkelsens' face in the penultimate scene is dazzlingly moving - as in a split second - he contemplates what he has done and what he is left with, in the wake of passion and loss.This Danish film is unafraid to show characters without glamour and to explore a story with no easy heros and victims. I dare the viewer to watch this film and NOT want to shout at the screen at certain points - to warn/to cajole/to rebute/to scream. This is a very painful and very great film - one best for adults due to some nudity and vicious emotional behaviour.If you enjoy Dogma films, if you look for Mads Mikkelsen or Nicholaj Lie Kaas in films, if you want a film that will challenge you and possibly break your heart - you will want to see this one!",5,Open up for Open Hearts,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1667,"['bittersweet', 'exploration', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'two', 'families', 'due', 'horrible', 'accident', 'raw', 'gritty', 'heartbreaking', 'truly', 'shattering', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'easy', 'sit', 'through.Multiple', 'viewings', 'only', 'make', 'film', 'stronger', 'one', 'away', 'horrible', 'wreckage', 'two', 'breakups', 'unscarred', 'Nicholaj', 'Lie', 'Kaas', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'terrific', 'duo', 'play', 'young', 'man', 'paralized', 'car', 'accident', 'doctor', 'who', 'partially', 'resposible', 'fate', 'spouse', 'was', 'driving', 'other', 'car', 'stress', 'painful', 'situation', 'everyone', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'fall', 'apart', 'noone', 'truly', 'innocent', 'completely', 'guilty', 'tragedy', 'levels', 'abuse', 'denial', 'inflicted', 'various', 'members', 'two', 'families', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'truthful', 'actions', 'come', 'shock', 'thoughtless', 'dependence', 'neediness', 'manifested', 'passion', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsens', 'face', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'dazzlingly', 'moving', 'split', 'second', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'left', 'wake', 'passion', 'loss.This', 'Danish', 'film', 'unafraid', 'show', 'characters', 'glamour', 'explore', 'story', 'easy', 'heros', 'victims', 'dare', 'viewer', 'watch', 'film', 'NOT', 'want', 'shout', 'screen', 'certain', 'points', 'warn/to', 'cajole/to', 'rebute/to', 'scream', 'very', 'painful', 'very', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'adults', 'due', 'nudity', 'vicious', 'emotional', 'behaviour.If', 'enjoy', 'Dogma', 'films', 'look', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Nicholaj', 'Lie', 'Kaas', 'films', 'want', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'possibly', 'break', 'heart', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'one']",N/A

This is truly an emotional tour-de-force that has me analysed about what love is.  When what we have taken for granted is taken away from us immediately, are we to confront our life head on or that we would remain submissive and giving in to what life has in store for us? In this story, a young loving couple meant to get married soon.  A freak accident permanently handicaps the man.  Whilst recuperating in hospital, he self pities himself & feeling vengeful against the world for what has become of him including his girlfriend.  Being left alone, she resorts to the woman driver's husband to console her who coincidentally enough works as a doctor in the same hospital.  Soon, the doctor-patient line is crossed.  Does he do that out of sympathy or that he loves her?  Is it okay for us to move on with our lives if somebody we love truly, deeply, madly is permanently impaired?  Would we be defined as being selfish?  When we know that love is no longer in a marriage, is that okay to walk out of it even if that means we are to forsake quality time with our children?  Once again, does that constitute as selfishness?  Rather than having an open ended finale, this movie has a resolve which to me is an appropriate closure to a chapter which does provoke discussions about nature of relationship.  A very well-made intelligent movie for adults.  Mads Mikkelsen is the leading baddie in the latest Casino Royale.

926964,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B000AIPPBQ,S. Spilka,"[7, 12]","In the passionate, and passionately executed Danish movie ""The Royal Affair,"" also starring Mads Mikkelsen, the extra-marital affair between the doctor and the queen is, in truth, an innocent and brave love, crushed by the overwhelming might of the king and the Danish royal court. The love affair is innocent for the following reasons: the marriage between the Danish king and the British queen is arranged, as it used to be among royalty in Europe. Once the young queen sees the strange and offensive behavior of the Danish king, a spoiled young man who had never managed to grow up, she is deeply disappointed and begins to hate him, although she decides to bear her fate with dignity. When the German doctor (Mads) arrives, she finds out that he is a kindred soul, sharing her enlightenment ideas. The two are strongly drawn to each other, not only by sexual passion, but also by intellectual, political, and emotional affinities.  Although the queen is superficially unfaithful to the king, she does not, in my view, betray him. Her marriage to him was forced upon her, without her say or choice, and his abusive behavior frustrates her well-meaning efforts to draw him closer to her. Where there is no love, there is no betrayal.This is not the case with Open Hearts, unfortunately. (Spoilers) The movie opens with a tragic accident, which could lead to a rich, deep, and thoughtful  movie, but it doesn't. A young engaged couple, madly in love, are driving along the street. They stop to let off the young man, who is going on a hiking trip before he marries his fiancee. As he gets out of the car, he is hit by a passing car and rushed to the hospital.  The verdict is grim: as the fall shattered his spine, he will not be able to move any limb from the neck down--for ever. We feel compassion for the victims, who must pay an unfathomable price for an ordinary mistake. We pity the young woman who visits her fiance in the hospital every day, the whole day, trying desperately to convince him that they could overcome the injury and share some kind of life together. The man responds to her plea with unmitigated, and sometimes sadistic, anger. Filled with self-pity, he rejects her approaches and orders her not to see him again. (Couldn't he be a bit nicer?) She is crushed.This opening is very promising. However, what happens next reduces the film to melodrama. Mads Mikkelsen plays one of the doctors in charge of the injured young man. (It was his wife's car, incidentally, that hit the young man.) In her panic, the young woman turns to him for support and comfort. We are also obliquely informed that his sexual relationships with his wife have vanished long before. Why, we are not told. Is it just a weakening of the sexual flame between long-married partners, or is there a deeper conflict, or hostility, between the two? Well, one can see where this goes. The comfort the doctor offers the distraught and attractive young woman quickly develops into a lustful affair. All right, I understand, perhaps, why the doctor needs sex. But doesn't he know that he is taking advantage of a wounded and vulnerable woman?  And why would the young woman, who hasn't had the chance to digest what has happened to her, and who surely still loves her injured fiance, why would she leap so quickly into the arms of another man (even if he is the handsome Mads Mikkelsen)? This makes no sense to me. What is the value of her love for her fiance if she so quickly plunges into an affair with his doctor? Where are her inner conflicts? She seems to have none. Where is her self-respect? Where are her attempts to stand up, on her own, to the ""whips and scorns of time,"" as Hamlet would put it? And even if she pleads for the doctor's support, must it lead to an affair? I just don't understand why it is so easy for the doctor and the young woman to engage in such a light-headed affair so soon after the accident. Was the director more concerned with the sensational possibilities that the movie offered her rather than with the psychological truths of the characters? If fact, the only dignified character in this movie is the doctor's wife, who is also an excellent actor. At first, she feels guilty about inadvertently hitting the young man with her car and therefore encourages her husband's offers of solace to the young woman. But when she finds out about the affair, she is the one who tells him the truth about his weak and miserable self and thus presents the only moral point of view in the movie. However, she loses. The doctor insists that he is in love with the young woman and escapes his home and his children. Back and forth they go, and the ending is ambiguous.Finally, Hemingway's advice to writers is applicable to all artists. During Hemingway's conversation with Scott Fitzgerald, the writer of The Great Gatsby described how he changed his short stories for submission, ""knowing exactly how he must make the twists that made them into salable magazine stories."" Hemingway is shocked by this betrayal of art and says he ""did not believe anyone could write any way except the very best he could write without destroying his talent"" (Ernest Hemingawy, A moveable Feast, 153).  Hemingway's is a sterling counsel to the rising stars and directors of the new and often riveting Danish movies.",2,The difference between one extra-marital affair and another,1367539200,"05 3,
