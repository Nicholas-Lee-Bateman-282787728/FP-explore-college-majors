They share secrets and petty squabbles and seem to think that life will keep them together.  Then, one by one, life begins to caress each girl in different ways, with Maria's lopsided relationship with her boyfriend, Joy's bonding with a different set of females, and Lanisha trying to hold them together while facing to prospect of leaving the city to attend college, leaving her bosom lifelines behind.  A little lengthy, this film still makes a statement.  Life can be a beautiful thing, but it's the reality that makes it challenging, and change can make it more difficult.

This movie shows the trials and tribulations that girls have to go through...teen pregnancy, money troubles, friendships coming together and some breaking up, guys, school..The three main characters of the film created a beautifully acted story that was so natural, that you fell into it and found it very believable. I liked the acting better than I liked the movie.It shows you that even though the scenery may change the feelings still are the same for every girl because we all go through it.Some light humor was included and depressing times as well.. it was all interwoven nicely throughout the film.

A few pictures etc. I only found this movie and an episode of Law and Order she played in. In this movie though, I didn't really see her skills, I was more or less watching Kerry Washington...who is a very good actress. The other ladies were just ok. Anna did a great job on the episode of Law and Order though.The movie had some good ideas etc, I just don't think they were carried out the right way, I know it is an independent film and the budget was probably low, but I think they did ok with filming..some awkward moments where scenes were a bit too long.It was boring for the most part, except for the band parts.

It's about being on the cusp of womanhood, and what you're going to do about it.  Decisions, decisions!

There were relevant topics that many teenagers need to see: teenage pregnancy, deadbeat dads, drugs, sex, friendship, suicide, motherhood, parent disconnection, peer pressure, etc.  The movie writer(s) came up with pretty reasonable dialogue and the scenes fit the scenes of the area.  But this movie was shot like an afterschool special.  I don't know what the budget was but it looked like someone just walked around with a video camera and a stand to sit the camera on, said ""Action,"" and people started talking.  The plot was slow, many actors/actresses had limited lines, the acting was a little dead, and some of the scenes lasted too long. There was a scene when a couple kissed after smoking weed, but the scene lasted forever with them kissing; another scene where a couple looked in each other's eyes with no dialogue which lasted too long; at the end of the movie one of the characters sat on the train staring out the window and the only thing happening was her facial expressions; a scene where one girl walked down the street for a few minutes but the only thing that happened was a car honked after two minutes; and many more.  It's like the director forgot to call ""Cut"" through half of the movie and instead let it linger.In a movie, viewers need to see steady action, continuous dialogue, and speed, but this movie had the pace of a turtle.  The girls didn't seem very well-rounded either. They did the sad/mad scenes very well, but when it came to being happy or sick, it was pitiful, which wasn't a surprise to me considering Kerry Washington's scenes in that terrible movie ""Save the Last Dance"" were just as dry.To top it all off, there were two scenes about mochachino.  One scene was in a cafe where two girls tried to encourage another one to get it and talked about how good it was.  This scene lasted quite a few minutes: about a drink.  Then there was ANOTHER scene where the girl who was new to drinking this mochachino went to her friends and described the taste of it in detail.  Why did something so irrelevant need to be in two scenes?  If I would've had this script in hand, I'd have crossed out half of it.This had the potential to be a very good movie, but it needed a different cast, director, and producer in order to do it.  Maybe people in their teenager years who are less critical of how a movie is shot will connect with these characters, but I did not, and I love almost any movie or television show about high school or college (ex: Higher Learning, A Different World, School Daze, Drumline, ATL).",1,Relevant plot; poor movie,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,2598,"['movie', 'were', 'book', ""'d"", 'have', 'probably', 'liked', 'were', 'relevant', 'topics', 'many', 'teenagers', 'need', 'see', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'deadbeat', 'dads', 'drugs', 'sex', 'friendship', 'suicide', 'motherhood', 'parent', 'disconnection', 'peer', 'pressure', 'etc', 'movie', 'writer', 'came', 'up', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'fit', 'scenes', 'area', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'afterschool', 'special', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'budget', 'was', 'looked', 'someone', 'just', 'walked', 'around', 'video', 'camera', 'stand', 'sit', 'camera', 'said', 'Action', 'people', 'started', 'talking', 'plot', 'was', 'slow', 'many', 'actors/actresses', 'had', 'limited', 'lines', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'dead', 'scenes', 'lasted', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'couple', 'kissed', 'smoking', 'weed', 'scene', 'lasted', 'forever', 'kissing', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'looked', 'other', 'eyes', 'dialogue', 'lasted', 'too', 'long', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'characters', 'sat', 'train', 'staring', 'out', 'window', 'only', 'thing', 'happening', 'was', 'facial', 'expressions', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'girl', 'walked', 'street', 'few', 'minutes', 'only', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'car', 'honked', 'two', 'minutes', 'many', 'more', 'director', 'forgot', 'call', 'Cut', 'half', 'movie', 'instead', 'let', 'linger.In', 'movie', 'viewers', 'need', 'see', 'steady', 'action', 'continuous', 'dialogue', 'speed', 'movie', 'had', 'pace', 'turtle', 'girls', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'did', 'sad/mad', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'came', 'being', 'happy', 'sick', 'was', 'pitiful', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'considering', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'scenes', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'were', 'just', 'dry.To', 'off', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'mochachino', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'cafe', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'tried', 'encourage', 'one', 'get', 'talked', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'scene', 'lasted', 'quite', 'few', 'minutes', 'drink', 'Then', 'was', 'ANOTHER', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'new', 'drinking', 'mochachino', 'went', 'friends', 'described', 'taste', 'detail', 'Why', 'did', 'something', 'so', 'irrelevant', 'need', 'be', 'two', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'script', 'hand', ""'d"", 'have', 'crossed', 'out', 'half', 'it.This', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'needed', 'different', 'cast', 'director', 'producer', 'order', 'do', 'Maybe', 'people', 'teenager', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'critical', 'how', 'movie', 'shot', 'will', 'connect', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'almost', 'movie', 'television', 'show', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'ex', 'Higher', 'Learning', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'School', 'Daze', 'Drumline', 'ATL']",N/A
