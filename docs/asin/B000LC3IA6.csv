This is a nice change of pace for him since his character doesn't carry a gun or work for the government.  Everything is well done in this move, the settings are great and the acting is done well.  It would have been nice to have some extras on this DVD, but I guess somebody was too cheap for that.  Oh well.

Hall ""Associate Professor of Communication""","[0, 0]","I've been teaching film for a decade, and it's rare to find a film that I find completely lamentable, but the wrongfully named Paradise Found is one of those films that suffers on every level.  I won't go in to a lot of details, but the gross historical inaccuracies perpetrated on the filmgoer is enough to make one apoplectic with rage.  Gauguin's real life was interesting enough without trying to completely recast him in what amounts to a romantic picture.  I would really prefer to give this film zero stars, but alas, that is not an option.  I really wonder what was going through the heads of the producers and writer, and even director, of this picture.  It is complete and utter dreck.  The other pictures that exist about Gauguin are far more interesting and far more historically accurate.",1,Enough historical inaccuracies to disrupt the time-space continuum,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,801,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'teaching', 'film', 'decade', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'find', 'completely', 'lamentable', 'wrongfully', 'named', 'Paradise', 'Found', 'one', 'films', 'suffers', 'level', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'lot', 'details', 'gross', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'perpetrated', 'filmgoer', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'apoplectic', 'rage', 'Gauguin', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'trying', 'completely', 'recast', 'what', 'amounts', 'romantic', 'picture', 'would', 'really', 'prefer', 'give', 'film', 'zero', 'stars', 'alas', 'not', 'option', 'really', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'heads', 'producers', 'writer', 'even', 'director', 'picture', 'complete', 'utter', 'dreck', 'other', 'pictures', 'exist', 'Gauguin', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'far', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate']",Paradise Found

I think it was Oscar worthy. Not ""acting"" crying, but I felt he was doing a natural crying that would take place at that kind of moment.If your an artist, you will like this movie because of the artist's struggle.",3,keifer should have been given an Oscar.....,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,335,"['Sure', 'are', 'slow', 'areas', 'kiefer', 'crying', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'real', 'crying', 'sene', 'have', 'seen', 'day', 'man', 'think', 'was', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Not', 'acting', 'crying', 'felt', 'was', 'doing', 'natural', 'crying', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'kind', 'moment.If', 'artist', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'artist', 'struggle']",Paradise Found
