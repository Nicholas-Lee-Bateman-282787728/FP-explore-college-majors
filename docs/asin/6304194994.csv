Don't expect a legitimate Lovecraft tie-in: Lovecraft appears as a character in a &quot;wraparound&quot; uniting three unrelated stories, but it's not Lovecraft the historical character--there's a disclaimer at the end of the film admitting as much--nor do the stories themselves reflect Lovecraft's ethos.  Lovecraft was about understatement and suggestion; this film takes the opposite track with dripping gore and monsters in full view.  To me, that's no bad thing, but as you can tell from the reviews here, plenty of hard-core Lovecraft fans disagree.  What the movie does offer is plenty of slime covered latex masks and monsters, and you get good views of them; one pretty good story, one mediocre story, and one gross-out fairly stupid story; lots of mediocre to bad acting, and a quick, totally gratuitous and titillating (so to speak) shot of one of the actresses naked in the shower.  If that's what you want to pay your money for, go for it.

Lovecraft's Necronomicon: Book of the Dead"" is a horror anthology film with three stories of macabre and a wraparound story. ""The Library"" is the name of the wraparound story and features Jeffrey Combs playing Howard Philip Lovecraft himself as he enters an esoteric library guarded by monks as he sneaks off to read from the mystical book, ""Necronomicon.""As the movie continues, the next story is called ""The Drowned"" and this is actually a fairly well told story. Flashbacks tell of a man's ancestor who loses his family in a tragic accident but manages to resurrect them after he reads from the ""Necronomicon."" The third story is slightly above mediocre. It is an adaption of the story ""Cool Air"" called ""The Cold,"" which features a journalist investigating cold cases of missing persons which may lead back to a single house. The woman he confronts tells of her past and a possibly mad doctor she once lived with. This segment of the film is watchable but the corniness of the special effects take you out of the story.The final story ""Whispers"" is about a cop who sees her partner dragged off by a mysterious serial killer named ""The Butcher,"" into an urban complex where a strange cult-like sub-society exists. Without diving into too much detail, this tale sucks! It is mind-numbingly stupid, cheaply made, poorly acted and ill-conceived. It wasn't much better thanManos, the Hands of Fate. Following ""Whispers"" is the conclusion of ""The Library"" story. That ends very poorly as well with insultingly dumb plot turns and silly special effects. Worst of all, this entire movie is so dumb and cheesy but not in a fun way. I know Lovecraft's brand of horror may be difficult to translate onto the silver screen but this movie is bush league horror. I normally have a soft spot for portmanteau films, especially horror anthology films, but this movie is a big dud. ""H.P.

But after watching this abomination, it's highly unlikely that I'll be picking up one  of Lovecraft's books in the near future.  It's confusing almost from the  very beginning (stories within dreams within stories).  The gore is neither  frightening nor funny.  The framing story about Lovecraft makes no sense,  and the individual narratives aren't much better.  Worst of all is the  third tale, which follows a pregnant police officer as she becomes the  captive of a group of alien monsters that (I have to say this without  revealing too much, since I suppose there might be some people who actually  want to be surprised by this film) do some pretty terrible things to her.  I mean, I could sort of accept the rest of the movie as a really bad  Creepshow/Tales from the Dark Side kind of horror anthology, but this third  segment just really assaults the boundaries of basic human decency.  Please  don't misunderstand and think I'm some sort of weak-stomached cinematic  chicken (I laughed all the way through Dead Alive); there's just something  about the third little story that really, really crosses the line.

Even his literary career aped that of Poe -- neglected in his own lifetime, discovered after his death, elevated by some and  reviled by others while the rest of us look on in horror.Many have  wondered -- since Lovecraft is so scary, why hasn't anyone made a film of  his works?  And this video explains why that was a good thing.  Lovecraft's  writing style was not visual in nature -- he created dread through  well-chosen words and a certain dark mood that the camera doesn't capture  at all well.Nor is this the only problem this movie has.  In an attempt  to make the stories punchier for a current audience, several stories were  run together to make three short vignettes that are a horrible melange of  Lovecraft's style.  Also, Lovecraft was sparing, while these short segments  have more ornaments than a Christmas tree.  Resetting the episodes in a  current venue takes the characters and their situations out of their native  element.  The stories simply don't GO anywhere.Lovecraft is enjoyable  for fans of intelligent horror.

Perhaps its because the name HP Lovecraft was attached to yet another adaptation failure, and they thought, quite foolishly, that this meant that there would be a Lovecraftian film that was actually Lovecraftian. Well, that never happens and the H.P. is almost always attached to sell more movies and to get more bad reviews. Still, while not a standout jewel in the forum of monster movies (and what really is in the true monstrosity arena?), it does hits 4.5 star highs and 2.2 star lows to make it worth seeing. You just have to forget that nefarious little label.This movie is set in 1932 with everyone's favorite actor, the immortal Jeffrey Combs, as a strangle Indiana Joneseque version of H.P. Lovecraft. In it, Lovecraft decides to steal a view (and the book itself later) of the infamous Necronomicon despite the wishes (and warnings of its keepers). Taking a key from one of its monk keepers, he finds his way to a secretive chamber where he finds the book and begins to transcribe three stories - The Drowned, The Cold, and The Whispers - from what he sees here.The Drowned, a story borrowing from Lovecraftian themes and mingling in some ideas from differing stories, is about a man returning to an inherited hotel and finding more than he bargained for. Our main character looks over a letter from his Uncle that, in flashback sequencing, finds his family dead and denouncing God for it. After throwing his bible to the ground, he is visited by a good looking Deep One who replaces the book with another. Reading from it, he finds his family returned, but only in a small sense of the word. Well, our main character, seeing only the ""raising the dead"" and not the lesson in the tale, decides to liberate the book from its hiding place and resurrect his long lost wife, leading us to a showdown with a huge one-eyed monster (I can't call the thing great cthulhu).The Cold, a good piece adapted from Cool Air, begins with a reporter who is investigating a series of murders going to a house and speaking to the current owner. After loosing her tongue her with a series of threats, she reveals a story involving her mother and a doctor with a ""Skin condition"" that first owned this place. This story's ending is actual good, plus the body of the tale is also an interesting piece. I would have to say it also pulls its weight with a 3.5 to a 4.0 rating.Wanting to forget The Whispers, I'll only break it down briefly. Here is a tale about a female officer chasing a criminal who turns out not to be a criminal unto a cavern (more like an abandoned sewer) of terror (and yawning). It has a little gore, some scary homeless people - one of which is blind -, a lot of crawling and chasing, and some really, really bad acting. I would give it a 2.2 only because I had to spit on the other two pieces here.If you haven't seen this movie before, its not really a bad addition to anyone's growing horror selection.
