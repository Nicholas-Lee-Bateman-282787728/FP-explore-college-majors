1623244,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00B8O4UJY,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","""Going by the Book"" is a South Korean comedy that was actually released all the way back in 2007 and is just now getting released on DVD for the first time in the states. Directed by Ra Hee-chan and starring Jung Jae-young (""Guns & Talks,"" ""Moss"") and Son Byung-ho (""Running Wild,"" ""The Good The Bad The Weird""), ""Going by the Book"" is the unique tale of traffic cop Jung Do-man (Jae-young) who takes his job rather literally and does absolutely everything by the book. After a routine traffic stop, Do-man winds up giving a citation to the new police chief Lee Seung-woo (Byung-ho) for making an illegal left turn. With the rise of bank robberies, Lee Seung-woo stages a bank robbery that randly assigns every officer roles to play without any given warning on when the simulation will begin. The staged robbery and quick resolution by the town's police force is sure to boost the reputation of the men in uniform in the public eye. However Do-man is cherry picked to play the robber and encouraged to do his best which leads to a simple exercise exploding into a nationally televised nightmare.This actually seems like it's going in the direction of most cop dramas when it first begins. A cop giving his new chief a ticket because he takes his job too seriously just seems like the build-up for a drama that relies on said cop saving the day when no one else can. Thankfully, ""Going by the Book"" goes in a completely different direction. Once they start staging the robbery, you realize the film is going to go into uncharted territory. The montage involving Do-man researching how to be a robber, figuring out the right mannerisms, and discovering the right clothing to fit the part is where the humor of the film starts to trickle in. If you look carefully, you can actually see Do-man studying ""Oldboy"" around the 20-minute mark.All of the bank employees gripe and moan about every little thing; Miss Lee (played by Jo Shi-nae) is particularly agitating because she ""loses her mind"" on more than one occasion and is a bit too outspoken for her own good. The way Do-man deals with her is some of the funniest material the film has to offer. The bank robbery itself is really creative and clever mostly because none of it is real and its charm lies in the way they improvise which is similar to the sweded films in ""Be Kind Rewind."" Being locked in that bank for so long almost seems like a nod to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and yet nothing is taken seriously enough to really make it feel like that was done on purpose.The constant state of bumbling befuddlement that not only the police force, but also the SWAT team finds themselves in only adds to the humor of the film. It makes you wonder if South Korea took any offense in portraying the authorities in such a ridiculous light. The negotiator is always choking on his words, coughing, and hocking up loogies while speaking over the microphone. Not only that, but his voice is so absurd. He sounds like a Korean Fozzy Bear.The film's weight teeter-totters on the shoulders of Jung Jae-young and Son Byung-ho. Jae-young seems to be purposely devoid of emotion other than his quick temper that ignites at a moment's notice. Byung-ho slides through this array of emotions that starts with him being a confident chief and slowly coming to the realization that he's created Frankenstein's monster. He seems so shocked and absolutely puzzled about what to do the majority of the time that you can't help but find amusement in it.""Going by the Book"" is pretty ingenious for being so simple in nature. Seeing where the bank robbery is going to go and how Jung Do-man will handle everything that's thrown at him is where the film's inventive nature pushes the film into the extraordinary category. The last scene is a little weak and you're constantly wondering why the chief doesn't just pull the plug sooner to stop making his department look like a complete joke, but ""Going by the Book"" is otherwise a very imaginative and chuckle-worthy comedy.The two-disc DVD set has an entire disc devoted to special features that total over an hour and forty minutes.

1623247,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B00B8O4UJY,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[2, 2]","The town of Sampo has been hit with several bank robberies. To reassure the public, recently instated police chief Lee Seung-man conducts a mock bank robbery, which is basically a pretend robber (traffic cop Jung Do-man) versus cops, that will hopefully show the efficiency of the police. Unfortunately for Lee Seung-man, Jung Do-man is dedicated to doing everything by the book and takes his role very seriously. Going by the Book is a smart, witty, and engaging heist film.I really enjoyed the story in Going by the Book. It's a very immersive film, and it does this with it's smart and witty dialogue. The film is genuinely hilarious; it packs more laughs than most comedies nowadays, and it isn't purely a comedy film; it doesn't need gross-out gags or excessive cursing to be funny. It's a captivating film, especially how the heist plays out; the dialogue, the characters, and the twists all contribute to the excellent execution (it also has great editing). It's balanced excellently, with elements of comedy, action, and some drama all spread throughout. The fast pace makes this film the perfect time-killer. The acting is great from the entire cast. The music was also excellent.Overall, Going by the Book is a fun, smart, and extremely entertaining heist film with memorable characters and superb acting; the perfect film to kill an afternoon. The tight direction, great editing, and smooth storytelling make this a technically amazing film, as well. As of 3/25/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is HIGHLY recommended; don't miss this South Korean gem.Going by the Book has some violence.",5,"A Smart, Witty, and Engaging Heist Film...",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,1634,"['town', 'Sampo', 'been', 'hit', 'several', 'bank', 'robberies', 'reassure', 'public', 'recently', 'instated', 'police', 'chief', 'Lee', 'Seung-man', 'mock', 'bank', 'robbery', 'basically', 'pretend', 'robber', 'traffic', 'cop', 'Jung', 'Do-man', 'versus', 'cops', 'will', 'hopefully', 'show', 'efficiency', 'police', 'Unfortunately', 'Lee', 'Seung-man', 'Jung', 'Do-man', 'dedicated', 'doing', 'everything', 'book', 'role', 'very', 'seriously', 'Going', 'Book', 'smart', 'witty', 'engaging', 'heist', 'film.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'Going', 'Book', 'very', 'immersive', 'film', 'smart', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'film', 'genuinely', 'hilarious', 'more', 'laughs', 'most', 'comedies', 'nowadays', ""n't"", 'purely', 'comedy', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'excessive', 'cursing', 'be', 'funny', 'captivating', 'film', 'especially', 'how', 'heist', 'out', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'twists', 'contribute', 'excellent', 'execution', 'also', 'great', 'editing', 'balanced', 'excellently', 'elements', 'comedy', 'action', 'drama', 'spread', 'fast', 'pace', 'film', 'perfect', 'time-killer', 'acting', 'great', 'entire', 'cast', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'excellent.Overall', 'Going', 'Book', 'fun', 'smart', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'heist', 'film', 'memorable', 'characters', 'superb', 'acting', 'perfect', 'film', 'kill', 'afternoon', 'tight', 'direction', 'great', 'editing', 'smooth', 'storytelling', 'make', 'technically', 'amazing', 'film', 'as', 'well', '3/25/13', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'purchase', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'South', 'Korean', 'gem.Going', 'Book', 'violence']",Going by the Book
