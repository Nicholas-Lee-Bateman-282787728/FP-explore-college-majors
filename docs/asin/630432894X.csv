Little did they know that the apartment they chose was part of a planned community. The landlord of this particular apartment, Hogan (Jack Lemmon) only rents to young ladies preferably willing young ladies. Hogan thinks that he leased his apartment to two women. After realizing his mistake, will he be able to overcome the obstacles and achieve his objective?

414841,A2MB0FJC95Y9TN,630432894X,Beverly Kaynes,"[19, 21]","Jack Lemmon is Mr. Hogan, a swinging bachelor who has got the perfect set up. He is landlord to an apartment complex that occupies women and only women. It seems Mr. Hogan has had a lot of luck dating his tenants; after all, it's hard to resist his charm and womanizing ways. That is, until the faithful Robin moves in. Robin, played by Carol Linley, is engaged to be married. Now this doesn't appear to be a problem until she tells Mr. Hogan that her boyfriend, David, will be moving in with her(Did they do this sort of thing in 1963?). Now this poses a problem! How is Mr. Hogan going to romance Robin when her boyfriend is constantly getting in the way? And so the love triangle begins... Mr. Hogan, trying to get in good with Robin, while trying to keep fianc&eacute; David out. Sounds predictable, right? Well it may be but there are a few surprises that will make you laugh so hard you might even shed a few tears. Anyone who has ever seen a Jack Lemmon movie knows that he can be a riot on the screen. I've seen this one a couple of times and laughed out loud each time. As a matter of fact, last time I watched it with Quon I had to convince him that the all-woman apartment complex wouldn't fly these days.

414848,A2GRDEM5D6OTCD,630432894X,Richard Behmer,"[3, 3]","This movie takes the viewer back in time to the free and easy lifestyle of the 60's. Characters like Jack Lemon's definately existed back then and still do today, though in hiding. It was an age of free and harmless flirtations between the sexes. We all did the flirting at work, school, and at public gatherings. No one was ever harmed by it that I know of; and no lawsuits ever prevailed against it. I am positive that women enjoyed the attention as much as men did; and what better way to open up a conversation with a woman than to kid her a little and pay her the respectful attention she might just enjoy without any harm being done. Of course, Lemon's character was not respectful of the woman because he had only one intention on his mind. In a sense, he used entrapment in that he tricked unsuspecting young women into renting one of his apartments just so he could have a chance at seducing them. But I think he got his due from more than one of the girls, so the moral of the story is fixed in place rather well. Good and innocence prevail; evil and coniving people do not. Doesn't always work that way in real life of course. For light entertainment and ageless humor, this movie is a good bet. If nothing else, it projects a nice example of life in the 60's and reminds those, like me, of what it was like back then.

Bowers ""Bowers""","[1, 3]","Jack Lemmon, appearing on ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" said that this was one of his least favorite of his own films, and I would have to agree with him.  I have watched it 3 times now, each viewing separated by a number of years, thinking maybe my opinion of it would change.  I like 60's bedroom farces,  and I like the actors in this film,  so why it didn't work for me wasn't clear until this most recent viewing.  I think the reasons are 3:  1, Lemmon's character really is a sleazeball, and doesn't change; he starts out as one and finishes the same way.  2, Dean Jones a pleasant actor, but his personality isn't strong enough to allow me to feel any sense of victory for him over Lemmon's lecherous landlord character. I feel Jones won because the script said so, not because he earned it or deserved it in any way.  3, Carol Lynley is beautiful but too worldly; I certainly don't believe her character would not be willing to indulge in pre-marital sex for one thing,  and that she wouldn't be sophisticated enough to see through Lemmon's character in the second. Therefore her ""will she or won't she give in to Lemmon's character"" conflict becomes  unbelievable on both counts; her character would be sleeping with Jones' character and would see through Lemmon's almost from the get-go.
