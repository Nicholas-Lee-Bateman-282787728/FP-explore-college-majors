He's an award-winning Broadway stage librettist and wrote the entertaining dialogue for Stephen Sondheim's witty, wise and bittersweet musical, COMPANY. My ears appreciated the beautiful ballet music soundtrack, conducted by John Lanchbery. End-titles gave us a lyrical Chopin piano piece. I think only CENTER STAGE (a more recent ballet & dance movie) can compare with TURNING POINT. I've listened to recorded ballet music for many years, and Lanchbery is one of my favorite conductors (along with Richard Bonynge).",5,A Movie Worth Turning To,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,639,"['movie', 'really', 'second', 'viewing', 'appreciate', 'dramatic', 'thoughtful', 'story', 'dialogue', 'Arthur', 'Laurents', 'award-winning', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'librettist', 'wrote', 'entertaining', 'dialogue', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'witty', 'wise', 'bittersweet', 'musical', 'COMPANY', 'ears', 'appreciated', 'beautiful', 'ballet', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'conducted', 'John', 'Lanchbery', 'End-titles', 'gave', 'lyrical', 'Chopin', 'piano', 'piece', 'think', 'only', 'CENTER', 'STAGE', 'more', 'recent', 'ballet', 'dance', 'movie', 'can', 'compare', 'TURNING', 'POINT', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'recorded', 'ballet', 'music', 'many', 'years', 'Lanchbery', 'one', 'favorite', 'conductors', 'Richard', 'Bonynge']",The Turning Point VHS

225623,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300247163,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","I don't know if you can label this a `sports movie', but for the sake of my argument I'm going to.  I mean, technically ballet is sort of a sport, right?  Well, I guess not, but whatever.  It'll have to be considered one for the time being.  Okay, so my argument is this.  Sometimes there are `sports movies' that can be enjoyed by any and everyone, regardless of your feelings on the sport itself.  Other films rely on your personal appreciation of the sport to fuel your love for the movie.  I happen to enjoy a good sports movie, when it's done right, but personally I'm not a sports kind of guy, and so the film has to work extra hard to grab my attention.  The film has to be able to make me care about something I'm not too interested in.  When I think of films like `Friday Night Lights' I get all warm inside, because while my interest in football is minimal, that film made me care about the game and the players.  When a film fails to give you a personal reason to connect to the story then you find yourself uninterested and unmotivated.`The Turning Point' is that kind of movie for me.  It is really only enjoyable (in my opinion) for someone who is in love with the sport (the dance, the profession, the art...whatever you want to call it).  I found myself almost bored stiff throughout large portions of this film, and so I have to conclude that the only way to appreciate this movie is to love ballet as much as it does.I've seen other dance films and absolutely loved them, so this isn't just a genre thing, believe me.The film casts Shirley MacLaine (love her) and Anne Bancroft as old friends who become reunited one's daughter joins a ballet company the other belongs to.  Deedee Rogers and Emma Jacklin grew up dancing together, but when Deedee got pregnant she gave up her career to start a family.  Years later Deedee's daughter Emilia joins the same ballet company Emma belongs to and the two friends become locked in a subtle yet powerful war for the soul of Emilia so-to-speak.  While they struggle to hold on the Emilia they also struggle with their affections for one another.  They both have what the other wants so desperately and so their love is bittersweet.The acting is very good from both Bancroft and MacLaine, but elsewhere it is lacking.  MacLaine is sublime as the conflicted mother, giving her character so many emotional layers; while Bancroft simmers as Emma, keeping her guard up so as to maintain her pleasant faade.  The two actresses give performances that are far and away superior to the film they happen to star in.  I was not impressed with much else.  I felt that the dancing, while beautiful, was too prominent (especially in the end) and took away from the `film'.  The gritty style in which the film was shot is also a slight deterrence, for it doesn't match the films tone at all.  I thought that Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne deliver decent yet very rudimentary performances, neither shining bright enough to deserve the Oscar nominations they received.In fact, how this movie was nominated for anything aside from MacLaine (very deserved) and Bancroft (also excellent) is beyond me, yet it managed to rack up ELEVEN nominations.  Well, I guess people really liked this movie, but it the flimsy script (there is not enough depth here, really) and the poor pacing make this a film I'm not too keen on at all.",2,If not for the stunning performances of the two leads I would have certainly turned away from this one...,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,3370,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'label', 'sports', 'movie', 'sake', 'argument', ""'m"", 'going', 'mean', 'technically', 'ballet', 'sort', 'sport', 'right', 'Well', 'guess', 'not', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'time', 'being', 'Okay', 'argument', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'sports', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'feelings', 'sport', 'Other', 'films', 'rely', 'personal', 'appreciation', 'sport', 'fuel', 'love', 'movie', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'good', 'sports', 'movie', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'sports', 'kind', 'guy', 'so', 'film', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'grab', 'attention', 'film', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'care', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'interested', 'When', 'think', 'films', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'get', 'warm', 'inside', 'interest', 'football', 'minimal', 'film', 'made', 'care', 'game', 'players', 'When', 'film', 'give', 'personal', 'reason', 'connect', 'story', 'then', 'find', 'uninterested', 'unmotivated.', 'Turning', 'Point', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'opinion', 'someone', 'who', 'love', 'sport', 'dance', 'profession', 'art', 'want', 'call', 'found', 'almost', 'bored', 'stiff', 'large', 'portions', 'film', 'so', 'have', 'conclude', 'only', 'way', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'love', 'ballet', 'as', 'much', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'dance', 'films', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'so', ""n't"", 'just', 'genre', 'thing', 'believe', 'me.The', 'film', 'casts', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'love', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'become', 'reunited', 'one', 'daughter', 'ballet', 'company', 'other', 'belongs', 'Deedee', 'Rogers', 'Emma', 'Jacklin', 'grew', 'up', 'dancing', 'together', 'when', 'Deedee', 'got', 'pregnant', 'gave', 'up', 'career', 'start', 'family', 'Years', 'later', 'Deedee', 'daughter', 'Emilia', 'same', 'ballet', 'company', 'Emma', 'two', 'friends', 'become', 'locked', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'war', 'soul', 'Emilia', 'so-to-speak', 'struggle', 'hold', 'Emilia', 'also', 'struggle', 'affections', 'one', 'have', 'what', 'other', 'so', 'desperately', 'so', 'love', 'bittersweet.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Bancroft', 'MacLaine', 'elsewhere', 'lacking', 'MacLaine', 'sublime', 'conflicted', 'mother', 'giving', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'layers', 'Bancroft', 'simmers', 'Emma', 'keeping', 'guard', 'up', 'so', 'maintain', 'pleasant', 'faade', 'two', 'actresses', 'give', 'performances', 'are', 'far', 'away', 'superior', 'film', 'happen', 'star', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'much', 'else', 'felt', 'dancing', 'beautiful', 'was', 'too', 'prominent', 'especially', 'end', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'gritty', 'style', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'also', 'slight', 'deterrence', ""n't"", 'match', 'films', 'tone', 'thought', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'deliver', 'decent', 'yet', 'very', 'rudimentary', 'performances', 'shining', 'bright', 'enough', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'received.In', 'fact', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'anything', 'aside', 'MacLaine', 'very', 'deserved', 'Bancroft', 'also', 'excellent', 'managed', 'rack', 'up', 'ELEVEN', 'nominations', 'Well', 'guess', 'people', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'flimsy', 'script', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'here', 'really', 'poor', 'pacing', 'make', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'keen']",The Turning Point VHS

However, having lived through this wonderful period in ballet history, and knowing some former star ballerinas, I can relate to the drama.  This is truly a glimpse into the American Ballet Theatre when it was still great.  Of course, the artistry and excitement reflected in the film doesn't exist anymore.  Too bad!  On of Ms. Brown's worst representations in the film, (she is the God daughter of executive producer Nora Kaye, who by the way was one of the most incredibly dramatic ballerinas ever), is when she performs the thrilling solo Vortex solo from Ailey's The River.  Performed magnificently in performance by such greats as Eleanor D'Antuono, Brown is really BAD.  Another sad thing is that the amazing performance at the end of the film at the gala have not been restored and included as bonus material.  God I would have loved to see those performances in full.  Oh well, probably lost on the cutting room floor.  I do recommend this movie if you love ballet and want to see something of a time that has vanished.

So after a judicious pause of three decades, I've finally gotten around to seeing it. And I must say that, unlike its contemporaries, this film has aged reasonably well. It simply isn't the dated embarrassment that so many 1970s ""classics"" have become.This is partially because of its untraditional story arc and cast of characters. This film has THREE female leads, yet it hails from an era when you were lucky to get even one. And THE TURNING POINT is also a good reminder of what terrific actresses Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine were. (Though MacLaine should get a lifetime achievement award for bad eye make-up.) And dancer Emilia Rodgers, who plays Shirley's daughter, is well cast in her role as an inscrutable and precocious young woman.Caution: Yes, there are extended dance numbers.Violence Alert: There is a convincing brawl between MacLaine and Bancroft herein.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the treatment given the character of Emma, beautifully acted by Anne Bancroft, was not one which elicited moanful oh nooooo's! As a non-dancer, they depicted her perfectly and yet, her positioning, arm and hand movements were spot on.  Even Shirley MacLaine, who is a dancer by trade, was not depicted as an aging ballerina in anything but dialog.  Anne Bancroft cuts a delicate and elegant figure from any vantage point and is one of the most versatile actresses ever to grace the screen.  Her preparation and understanding of the dance is evident in her actions and reactions.  We don't often get to see the back stage machinations or personal interactions of any company, let alone from the world of ballet so this was a special treat for all comers! Within the context are snippets of dance sequences that are a delight for anyone who loves the excitement of dance. Leslie Browne delivers a fine performance as, Emilia, Dee Dee's daughter who happens to be Emma's Godchild and who will be the next prima ballerina. Mikhail Baryshnikov is splendid as, Yuri, the handsome Russian lover of the company who knows everyone intimately and dances superlatively. He is always exciting to watch, even when not in tights!  The story is one of past, present and future and as two aging ballerinas come to grips with their places within and outside the company for whom they both danced...the next generation is poised and waiting in the wings as even those behind them are crashing the entry doors to the practice floors and careers of a lifetime. This is a story of desire, commitment, missed opportunities, recriminations, self doubt, acceptance, dreams and successes realized and yet, overall, this is a story of hope even as the torch is passed.

They now live in Oklahoma with their three children including their oldest daughter Emilia (Leslie Browne) who has both the talent and the dreams to become a great dancer. Deedee has wrestled all this time with the question of whether she was good enough to be a star as well as her feelings about a friend Emma (Anne Bancroft), a fellow dancer who ""sacrificed"" a family for a career.The plot is as predictable as ""The Nutcracker."" The costumes are straight out of the 70's (the movie was filmed in 1977 by Herbert Ross). Wayne arrives in New York wearing a leisure suit and floral shirt that Billy Carter would have wrestled him to the ground for. This soap opera finally runs totally amuck when Bancroft and MacLaine engage in one of the strangest cat fights ever filmed.Although the movie is not nearly as good as I remembered, the acting and the ballet sequences with the fine music of course ultimately make this movie worth watching.

Back in 1977, I was a kid of 17 and quite ""different"" from my peers.  Being bored by Star Wars (all that noise and awful John Williams music giving me a headache!), and much more enchanted by three other movies released that same year: New York, New York, Julia, and The Turning Point.  As you can see, I had quite a lot in common with other boys my age!  I can remember as if it were yesterday the first time I experienced The Turning Point on the big screen.  Granted, I was not, nor am I to this day, a particularly huge admirer of ballet - opera being more my style - but after seeing this flick, the combination of fine dancing, and, especially, fine film acting and script writing, just blew my mind and the lid off my head!  The late 70's was a kind of renaissance for great woman actors (and ballet too!), and scripts written for them, especially MacLaine, Fonda, and Streep.  This film was a stand out indeed.  The scenes of MacLaine in her suburban home, preparing to receive the company of her long-lost ballet friends are just so palpable and full of emotion.  Bancroft is no less compelling - gorgeous to look at (is it just me or does she not look a bit like the great Callas?), subtle in her resignation that she is no longer what she was but NOT bitter about it, the way MacLaine is quite bitter and a bit disappointed in terms of the way her life has turned out.  Her caring and admiration for MacLaine's  daughter, Leslie Brown, is never, I feel, done in a way to spite her one-time rival.  It's simply one artist acknowledging and encouraging another for the sake of their Art. The little ""inside"" bits of the ballet world also contribute considerably to this film, adding truth and a texture that, I'm afraid to say, could never be done today (the ballet world is NOT the same today as it was in the late 70's, a glowing period it was indeed!!!).  As for all the talk regarding Ms. Brown's acting ability, I think she is perfect for this role, projecting an innocent, vulnerable quality with an ability to also dance quite well.  As for Baryshnikov?  Well, what can I say.  Beautiful to look at and especially amusing in the early part of the film where he is serenading the post-performance party with a little Russian melody.This is what film making used to be about - great acting, interesting personalities, fine script writing, and an all-around interest and knowledge of what a particular film was supposed to be about.Luigi - NYC",5,They Just Can't Make'Em Like This Anymore :-(,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2548,"['Fabulous', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'DVD', 'home', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'Back', '1977', 'was', 'kid', '17', 'quite', 'different', 'peers', 'Being', 'bored', 'Star', 'Wars', 'noise', 'awful', 'John', 'Williams', 'music', 'giving', 'headache', 'much', 'more', 'enchanted', 'three', 'other', 'movies', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Julia', 'Turning', 'Point', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'quite', 'lot', 'common', 'other', 'boys', 'age', 'can', 'remember', 'were', 'yesterday', 'first', 'time', 'experienced', 'Turning', 'Point', 'big', 'screen', 'Granted', 'was', 'not', 'am', 'day', 'particularly', 'huge', 'admirer', 'ballet', 'opera', 'being', 'more', 'style', 'seeing', 'flick', 'combination', 'fine', 'dancing', 'especially', 'fine', 'film', 'acting', 'script', 'writing', 'just', 'blew', 'mind', 'lid', 'head', 'late', '70', 'was', 'kind', 'renaissance', 'great', 'woman', 'actors', 'ballet', 'too', 'scripts', 'written', 'especially', 'MacLaine', 'Fonda', 'Streep', 'film', 'was', 'stand', 'out', 'indeed', 'scenes', 'MacLaine', 'suburban', 'home', 'preparing', 'receive', 'company', 'long-lost', 'ballet', 'friends', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'palpable', 'full', 'emotion', 'Bancroft', 'less', 'compelling', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'just', 'not', 'look', 'bit', 'great', 'Callas', 'subtle', 'resignation', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'was', 'NOT', 'bitter', 'way', 'MacLaine', 'quite', 'bitter', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'terms', 'way', 'life', 'turned', 'out', 'caring', 'admiration', 'MacLaine', 'daughter', 'Leslie', 'Brown', 'never', 'feel', 'done', 'way', 'spite', 'one-time', 'rival', 'simply', 'one', 'artist', 'acknowledging', 'encouraging', 'sake', 'Art', 'little', 'bits', 'ballet', 'world', 'also', 'considerably', 'film', 'adding', 'truth', 'texture', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'say', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'today', 'ballet', 'world', 'NOT', 'same', 'today', 'was', 'late', '70', 'glowing', 'period', 'was', 'indeed', 'talk', 'regarding', 'Ms.', 'Brown', 'acting', 'ability', 'think', 'perfect', 'role', 'projecting', 'innocent', 'vulnerable', 'quality', 'ability', 'also', 'dance', 'quite', 'well', 'Baryshnikov', 'Well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Beautiful', 'look', 'especially', 'amusing', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'serenading', 'post-performance', 'party', 'little', 'Russian', 'melody.This', 'what', 'film', 'making', 'used', 'be', 'great', 'acting', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'fine', 'script', 'writing', 'all-around', 'interest', 'knowledge', 'what', 'particular', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.Luigi', 'NYC']",The Turning Point VHS

Emma became a prima ballerina but has no family and a boyfriend who's married to someone else. Dee Dee married another member of the dance company, got pregnant, and moved to Oklahoma City where she and her devoted husband run a ballet school and are raising three children. Dee Dee returns to New York for a summer with her elder daughter and son so they can study with the American Ballet Company while her husband remains in Oklahoma City with the middle child. The movie explores jealousy, resentment, and the choices we make at our ""turning points."" Well-written and gorgeously-acted by Anne Bancroft as Emma and Shirley MacLaine as Dee Dee, the plot is nonetheless pretty standard soap opera fare.Mikhail Baryshnikov played his first role in this film and it's easy to see why he has enjoyed such popularity. He out-charms and out-shines everybody not only in this movie but in just about any movie. Had they been contemporaries and Baryshnikov elected to put more effort into building an acting career, Cary Grant would have needed to watch his back--seriously. And he's a freaking amazing dancer. Maybe he's just playing himself, but he's wonderful as the Russian emigre dancer who seduces Dee Dee's eldest daughter Emilia. Sadly, Leslie Browne, a gifted dancer who plays Emilia, is WAY out of her league in the acting chops department. She seems like zombie rather than a character, and I could not shake the feeling that her line readings had been dubbed, limply, by someone else. I see why the other performers (Bancroft, MacLaine and Baryshnikov) got their Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor nominations, but I cannot begin to fathom why Browne was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this insipid sleepwalking.The dance sequences are the real reason to watch ""The Turning Point."" They are flat-out beautiful, even if you're not a big ballet aficionado, and ""The Turning Point"" doles them out generously.

It brought together two great actresses whose careers were in limbo and revitalized them.Deedee (Shirley Maclaine) and Emma (Anne Bancroft) were best friends.  Both were up and coming stars of the American Ballet Company.  Both were vying for the same role, the new ballet of Anna Karenina (Turning Point #1).  But Deedee gets pregnant and has to decide if she will keep the baby (Turning Point #2).  Deedee decides to have the baby and Emma gets the ballet.It's 20 years later and the ABC is performing in Oklahoma City, where Deedee and Wayne (Tom Skerritt) have settled down and opened their own ballet school.  Two of their children are dancers but the middle child wants nothing to do with it.  Deedee and Wayne hold a party after the performance.  Their oldest, Amelia (Leslie Browne), is drawn to the fading prima ballerina who invites her to take class with the company the next morning.During the practice, Emma points out Amelia to the head of the company (Martha Scott) and she sees the talent plus the publicity value.  Amelia is offered a place in the company.  Emma is honored by the offer but is a little afraid at being taken away from family (Turning Point #3).  To help her along, Deedee offers to spend the summer with her in NYC.  Deedee, Amelia and her brother all head off to the Big Apple.Amelia easily fits into the company and the managers take notice of her.  She quickly gets a \the lead in a major new ballet.  She also catches the eye of the hot new star, Yuri (Mikhail Baryshnikov).  They start a relationship but the difference is she wants more and he wants to play the field.Deedee quickly finds out that the only thing worse than a fading star is a never was.  So she when she runs into a friend from the old days (Anthony Zerbe), she starts spending time with him.  Amelia feels, a little too much time with him.Emma has to come to grips with his fading star and latches onto Amelia.  But Deedee is on to her immediately.  This is comes to a head at after the Opening Gala.  The confrontation at the reception bar has become legendary followed by an even more celebrated cat fight in front of the theatre.Wayne arrives and as always centers the family.  But as this is a time for turning points, Deedee decides to confront some of her and Wayne's demons. This is another great scene for Maclaine.All ties up nicely with the premier of the ballet that stars Amelia.  This brings Deedee and Emma back together with their differences settled.This film restarted Shirley Maclaine's career and this performance should have garnered her first Oscar for this but Anne Bancroft's strong performance (along with Jane Fonda) split the vote and she would have to wait until Terms of Endearment to get her recognition.This was the film gave Tom Skerrit his first break. Leslie Browne followed her movie mother's career as she stepped into her role after the original cast in her role had to bow out.  Ms. Browne received an Oscar nomination along with her love interest in the film Mikhail Baryshnikov.The film was written by Arthur Laurents who gave us West Side Story and The Way We Were and was directed by Herbert Ross who got his start on the Streisand films Funny Girl and Funny Lady.DVD EXTRAS: Making of Featurette made at the time of the film.

The plot need not be discussed here because it is the stars Shirley Maclaine and Anne Bancroft that illuminate this vehicle.

Penola,"[47, 49]","Combining soapy suds and exhilarating dance sequences with the formidable  acting skills of lead players Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft, Herbert  Ross creates a winner in The Turning Point.  Baryshnikov is every bit as  magnetic onscreen, in a well-chosen role as a dance lothario, as he is  every second he is dancing; he defies gravity and sends your spirit  soaring.  Leslie Browne, a novice (to put it kindly), in the acting  department, is no less spectacular on the dance floor.  Rarely has a big,  old-fashioned, commercial film been so successful at making classical  ballet so tangible and electric.  The score, punctuacted throughout with  the obvious classical scores of the many pieces we get glimpses of, adds a  resonance to the story.  MacLaine and Bancroft, as rivals in romance and  once, in their careers, have a grand old time with our emotions, as they  traverse the entire wide range of jealousy, humiliation, aging, love,  friendship -- and eventually combust onscreen, which provides the movie  with its most dazzlingly entertaining moments of drama.  Tom Skerrit is  terrific as Shirley's dancer-gone-husband, and the portrait of MacLaine's  character has surprising moments of reality sprinkled throughout the  screenplay.  A wonderful big, overlong, old-fashioned movie, and a great  way to introduce your family to classic dance, not only painlessly, but  engagingly.",5,TERRIFICALLY ENTERTAINING,962323200,"06 30, 2000",2000,1398,"['Combining', 'soapy', 'suds', 'exhilarating', 'dance', 'sequences', 'formidable', 'acting', 'skills', 'lead', 'players', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'winner', 'Turning', 'Point', 'Baryshnikov', 'bit', 'magnetic', 'onscreen', 'well-chosen', 'role', 'dance', 'lothario', 'second', 'dancing', 'gravity', 'spirit', 'soaring', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'novice', 'put', 'kindly', 'acting', 'department', 'less', 'spectacular', 'dance', 'floor', 'Rarely', 'big', 'old-fashioned', 'commercial', 'film', 'been', 'so', 'successful', 'making', 'classical', 'ballet', 'so', 'tangible', 'electric', 'score', 'punctuacted', 'obvious', 'classical', 'scores', 'many', 'pieces', 'get', 'glimpses', 'resonance', 'story', 'MacLaine', 'Bancroft', 'rivals', 'romance', 'once', 'careers', 'have', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'emotions', 'traverse', 'entire', 'wide', 'range', 'jealousy', 'humiliation', 'aging', 'love', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'combust', 'onscreen', 'movie', 'most', 'dazzlingly', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'drama', 'Tom', 'Skerrit', 'terrific', 'Shirley', 'dancer-gone-husband', 'portrait', 'MacLaine', 'character', 'surprising', 'moments', 'reality', 'sprinkled', 'screenplay', 'wonderful', 'big', 'overlong', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'family', 'classic', 'dance', 'not', 'only', 'painlessly', 'engagingly']",The Turning Point VHS

I saw Leslie Browne and Mikhail Baryshnikov perform fairly often (as well as Gelsey Kirkland, who, the story goes, was first choice for the role Leslie Browne eventually got), and I even got to see a class taught by Alexandra Danilova at the School of American Ballet; that was a thrill for me. Those were exciting times for dance, and for balletomanes like me.That being said, The Turning Point is only coindentally a film about dance. It's more a ""woman's film"" about how in later life we realize what we gave up when we made important choices, and sometimes we have regrets. This should not be news to anyone. The good news is that we see Bancroft and MacLaine, who would be worth watching no matter what. The limber Leslie Browne, then a soloist at ABT who was also the goddaughter of either Herbert Ross or his wife (forgive me, it was a long time ago) is eminently watchable in the dance scenes, but she is not a good actress. (Years later I saw her in the film ""Dancers"" and she was very, very good in a nondance role.)The big gala at the end is a montage of clips showing dancers in different pas de deux - various gala warhorses. It looks almost like stock footage. But the scene in which Emily performs to ""Ellingtonia"" (it's actually a piece lifted whole from Alvin Ailey's wonderful ballet ""The River"", which was part of ABT's repertory in those years) is worth seeing; both she and the choreography are smashing. And of course there is the almost-obligatory coda from the Don Q wedding pas de deux, which is spoiled in part by the camera's close-ups of Browne's feet while she's doing turns. Yes, we know ballerinas have feet, and ballet fans know what pointework looks like; but when a dance performance is filmed, the dancer's entire body should be in the frame.The gala stuff is worth seeing if you never knew who these dancers were, or you did and you miss them. One of my favorite dances there is the one with Peter Martins (I think) and Suzanne Farrell; those two were awesome together.And there's the sequence between Browne and Baryshnikov set to Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, set in a vast imaginary loft. I want to groan ""Oh, brother"", but the truth is, that scene gets me every time. Browne never looked better than she does in that performance.Danilova herself appears in the film, and I just love her.",4,More soap opera than a film about ballet,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2452,"['remember', 'ballet', 'boom', '70s', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'live', 'NYC', 'often', 'saw', 'ABT', 'NYCB', 'performances', 'saw', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'perform', 'fairly', 'often', 'as', 'well', 'Gelsey', 'Kirkland', 'who', 'story', 'was', 'first', 'choice', 'role', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'eventually', 'got', 'even', 'got', 'see', 'class', 'taught', 'Alexandra', 'Danilova', 'School', 'American', 'Ballet', 'was', 'thrill', 'were', 'exciting', 'times', 'dance', 'balletomanes', 'being', 'said', 'Turning', 'Point', 'only', 'coindentally', 'film', 'dance', 'more', 'woman', 'film', 'how', 'later', 'life', 'realize', 'what', 'gave', 'up', 'when', 'made', 'important', 'choices', 'sometimes', 'have', 'regrets', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'news', 'anyone', 'good', 'news', 'see', 'Bancroft', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'matter', 'what', 'limber', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'then', 'soloist', 'ABT', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'goddaughter', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'wife', 'forgive', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'dance', 'scenes', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'later', 'saw', 'film', 'Dancers', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'nondance', 'role', 'big', 'gala', 'end', 'montage', 'clips', 'showing', 'dancers', 'different', 'pas', 'deux', 'various', 'gala', 'warhorses', 'almost', 'stock', 'footage', 'scene', 'Emily', 'Ellingtonia', 'actually', 'piece', 'lifted', 'whole', 'Alvin', 'Ailey', 'wonderful', 'ballet', 'River', 'was', 'part', 'ABT', 'repertory', 'years', 'worth', 'seeing', 'choreography', 'are', 'smashing', 'course', 'almost-obligatory', 'coda', 'Don', 'Q', 'wedding', 'pas', 'de', 'deux', 'spoiled', 'part', 'camera', 'close-ups', 'Browne', 'feet', 'doing', 'turns', 'Yes', 'know', 'ballerinas', 'have', 'feet', 'ballet', 'fans', 'know', 'what', 'pointework', 'when', 'dance', 'performance', 'filmed', 'dancer', 'entire', 'body', 'should', 'be', 'frame.The', 'gala', 'stuff', 'worth', 'seeing', 'never', 'knew', 'who', 'dancers', 'were', 'did', 'miss', 'One', 'favorite', 'dances', 'one', 'Peter', 'Martins', 'think', 'Suzanne', 'Farrell', 'two', 'were', 'awesome', 'together.And', 'sequence', 'Browne', 'Baryshnikov', 'set', 'Prokofiev', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'set', 'vast', 'imaginary', 'loft', 'want', 'groan', 'Oh', 'brother', 'truth', 'scene', 'time', 'Browne', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'performance.Danilova', 'film', 'just', 'love']",The Turning Point VHS
