My main complaint about this movie is the pacing is very slow and you do not see the killer enough in my opinion. Kills were ok but not the greatest and the acting was really weird. Evidently this was filmed in Sweden or something and the whole movie they are trying to speak perfect english and make it feel like an American film which is very werid, awkward, and sometimes funny to watch. The main selling point in this movie I think is the killer because I think he is awesome looking and has something not quite right with him. Worth a rent but not the $6 price tag.

1576172,A1MECEHZHFE5PT,B008U0XQ3K,"Dayna Newman ""Slasher Diva""","[2, 2]","This was basically a Slasher movie about a woman that goes to a house in the Icy woods for a well needed rest ,she meets up with an old boyfriend at a local bar.They reminisce about old times then he and 2 of his friends &#34;another couple&#34; come back with her to hang out and end up spending the night in the creepy house she's staying in.Short on Plot but good on Gore and it has a very cool and interesting killer.It has a short running time but that seems to be the trend these days especially with Indie Horror/Slasher Films.The kills were good and the effects done remarkably well especially since I heard that they were working with an absurd 5000.00 Budget.Yes Five Grand,(gasp) but they made it work.The camera work was good and there were some very chilling moments,no pun intended.I love a good slasher in the snow flick,Think Donner Pass and Cold Prey although I liked the plot of these two better but as a whole with the gore and the killer I Believe (Blood Runs Cold) is right up there.There was no explanation about the killer or the origin of the killer but that's ok I kind of got that he was just this cannibal freak that killed for food much like men who hunt deer or rabbit,when he got stabbed dust or something like that would kind of spray out he never bled and I wondered how he could see because his eyes were always covered with some weird snow goggles that were painted over so it would be impossible to see,He was somewhat mummified looking also but very cool looking.In one scene his goggles are taken off and he opens his eyes and I thought to myself O OK, that's the reason he doesn't need to see through the goggles.You will see what I'm speaking about.I say if you are a die hard slasher fan then Watch it or buy it because a Slasher film is exactly what you are getting.One that is re watchable at that.",4,The Iceman Cometh,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1840,"['was', 'basically', 'Slasher', 'movie', 'woman', 'house', 'Icy', 'woods', 'well', 'needed', 'rest', 'up', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'local', 'bar.They', 'reminisce', 'old', 'times', 'then', '2', 'friends', '34', 'couple', '34', 'come', 'back', 'hang', 'out', 'end', 'up', 'spending', 'night', 'creepy', 'house', 'staying', 'in.Short', 'Plot', 'good', 'Gore', 'very', 'cool', 'interesting', 'killer.It', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'be', 'trend', 'days', 'especially', 'Indie', 'Horror/Slasher', 'Films.The', 'kills', 'were', 'good', 'effects', 'done', 'remarkably', 'well', 'especially', 'heard', 'were', 'working', 'absurd', '5000.00', 'Budget.Yes', 'Five', 'Grand', 'gasp', 'made', 'work.The', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'very', 'chilling', 'moments', 'pun', 'intended.I', 'love', 'good', 'slasher', 'snow', 'flick', 'Think', 'Donner', 'Pass', 'Cold', 'Prey', 'liked', 'plot', 'two', 'better', 'whole', 'gore', 'killer', 'Believe', 'Blood', 'Runs', 'Cold', 'right', 'up', 'there.There', 'was', 'explanation', 'killer', 'origin', 'killer', 'ok', 'kind', 'got', 'was', 'just', 'cannibal', 'freak', 'killed', 'food', 'much', 'men', 'who', 'hunt', 'deer', 'rabbit', 'when', 'got', 'stabbed', 'dust', 'something', 'would', 'kind', 'spray', 'never', 'bled', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'see', 'eyes', 'were', 'always', 'covered', 'weird', 'snow', 'goggles', 'were', 'painted', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'see', 'was', 'somewhat', 'mummified', 'looking', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'looking.In', 'one', 'scene', 'goggles', 'are', 'taken', 'off', 'eyes', 'thought', 'myself', 'O', 'OK', 'reason', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'goggles.You', 'will', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'about.I', 'say', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'slasher', 'fan', 'then', 'Watch', 'buy', 'Slasher', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'getting.One', 're', 'watchable']",Blood Runs Cold [Blu-ray]
1576173,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008U0XQ3K,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","Now, I happen to like horror films.  That may make me a somewhat ineffective critic when it comes to evaluating these pictures because - right out of the gate - I'm watching something I'm a bit more prone to enjoy than the next person.  That doesn't mean I can't detect inherent weaknesses in plots, characters, and situations.  Rather, it means I may be slightly more inclined to give some of it a pass because, if the product delivers what it promised, then I got what I needed from it.BLOOD RUNS COLD serves up a respectable throwback to the days when horror films were, largely, done in-camera with practical, tangible special effects.  So in the nostalgia department, I'd have to give the film a solid B.  But - because I'm also an honest critic - I'll have to knock it down a few pegs mostly because so little thought went into the story's logic (or lack thereof) that, at one point, I realized I was spending more time trying to figure it out than legitimately enjoying its thrills, chills, and spills.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then this ain't for you!  Instead, I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Winona (played with mousey aplomb by Hanna Oldenburg) is a musician struggling through a stressful life.  Deciding to get away from it all, she borrows a rural cabin belonging to a work friend and plans to disappear for a few days.  However, fate throws her a curveball as she runs into an old boyfriend in a nearby tavern, and, together, they decide to carry on their reunion back at her temporary place.  The only problem is that there's a sadistic, cannibalistic killer now roaming the property, and he has other plans in store for the four of them.BLOOD RUNS COLD is - in a word - ""dumb.""  Yes.  I said it.  It's patently dumb.  And mostly absurd.  It's exactly the kind of film that, when you think about it on any measure, it falls completely apart.  It's almost as if the film gods conspired against writer/director Sonny Laguna and delivered up one horribly ill-conceived idea after another, all in hopes of destroying his chance of ever achieved an ounce of greatness by attaching this logic-bomb to his coattails.Still, there's something inspired about all of it.  Clearly - unless I miss my guess - Laguna and his co-writers (David Liljeblad and Tommy Wikland) share a fond appreciation for the slasher flicks of old.  You know the type?  Young ones lost in the wild ... a lurking, faceless killer with an ax ... trails of blood leading one hapless victim to the next?  Yes, it's THAT kind of film, and, on that level, the cast and crew manage to scare up a respectable dose of an almost nostalgic horror-fueled experience.  Yes - and please believe me - it all comes crashing apart if you examine one moment of its benign silliness under a microscope, but, in the world of splatter and gore, such is life.For example, what's up with this rural cabin?  The dirty little secret is that Winona ends up staying in the wrong place - why would her boss send her to his own B&B; run by a maneater? - but it has more rooms, closets, and secret passages than an Irish castle!  To make matters worse, apparently the two-story place was built over an underground cavern - complete with a frozen lake - that's only accessible from the house's second floor! (???)  Chalk up the fact that the property has more secondary structures than a Georgia plantation, and I'm hoping you catch my drift.And the slasher?  What exactly is he?  The film presents absolutely no possible origin story for him (or her?), and, while that's a significant weakness, it ain't its worst.  He's apparently doing what he's doing in order to eat - we're shown him gnawing on one or another of his victims - but why is he swathed over in gauze?  Why are his eyes perfectly concealed?  Why is it that no one can apparently hurt him, even when he takes an ax to the back?  And why do his wounds ooze with smoke once he's pierced?And, for the love of Pete, where did that machine gun just conveniently show up in the final reel to give our young heroine a weapon that could finally take down her attacker?See what I mean about none of it making much sense?  I thought you would.BLOOD RUNS COLD is produced by Stockholm Syndrome Film along with some participation from The Collective and Bloody Disgusting.  DVD distribution is being handled through Vivendi Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the picture looks and sounds mostly solid, though there's some curious `miking' issues in a few scenes that ruined the moment.  Also - and I could be wrong on this as I'm not all that adept on some filming techniques - there are a few exterior sequences that I believe were heavily modified in post with some lighting and tinting effects; I say this because the scenes have the feel of being `manufactured.'  This film was apparently shot in Sweden, but, rest assured, all dialogue is delivered in English.  Lastly, there's a brief (10 minute) making-of featurette for fans who are truly interested.RECOMMENDED.  Call me a fool, but I can appreciate a good, old-school slasher film as much as the next fan of old-school slasher films.  BLOOD RUNS COLD ain't perfect - a case could be made logically that it's pretty far from it - but there's something charming about any picture that sets out to be just one thing, knows what that one thing is, and then - despite whatever odds or developments or obvious gaps in logic - stays true to that one true thing.  Don't think about it too hard, and you might have as much with this one as I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Vivendi Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of BLOOD RUNS COLD by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,It's All Fun and Games Until Some Guy Shows Up With An Ax,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,6038,"['Now',

I didn't even realize this film was foreign until I started watching it and heard the actors speaking English with thick accents.  But do the Swedish know how to make a good slasher flick?  Well yes...and no.  BLOOD RUNS COLD is an effective and chilling horror film, but it does have a couple of issues.Before I start this review, I feel I should preface it by stating this one will contain spoilers.  I don't normally reveal a lot of specifics in my reviews, and I do this on purpose; after all, why should you watch something I recommend if I've already disclosed everything to you?  But there are a couple of big aspects in this one that bugged me, so I'm going to point them out and see if anyone feels the same.BLOOD RUNS COLD is shot very well for the most part and looks great overall.  There are a few shaky camera angles when the intensity kicks up, but nothing that really detracts too much from the film overall.  Also, the special effects and gore are excellent; there are some truly cringe-inducing scenes that get a nice boost from some top notch carnage.The story is impressive as well.  The concept that someone goes to the wrong house by mistake and pays for it in a horrific way is not new, but the production team does a great job of scaring us with it regardless.  I particularly like the killer; he looks creepy and would do Jason Vorhees justice in the `invincible slasher' department.But BLOOD RUNS COLD has two major flaws that pulled me out of the film.  First, the acting is...weird.  The cast looks like they have a lot of potential, but their lines come off as bland and non-effective.  I think this might be in part because they are speaking English, which doesn't appear to be their primary language.Secondly, there are NO explanations given for who the killer is or why he's a cannibal or even why he cannot die.  Nor are we told the reasons for his silver-colored eyes (you have to see them), or why he has a hidden ice-cave under his house.  If you want to be technical, we are never really told why he's attacking these people in the first place; it is assumed because they are trespassing in his house...but it's never really stated.These issues are strictly my opinions and you might feel they can be overlooked.  I was able to look past them and enjoy the film, however I know that some of my devoted horror aficionados will be annoyed with them.As for a recommendation, BLOOD RUNS COLD is going on my Make Your Own Mind Up list.  This means that I enjoyed it and I recommend it, but I'm not sure if non-diehard horror fans will like it or not.  The film is available today in a variety of formats.",3,Swedish Slasher that Scares but Doesn't Explain,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2773,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films', 'years', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Swedish', 'slasher', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'foreign', 'started', 'watching', 'heard', 'actors', 'speaking', 'English', 'thick', 'accents', 'do', 'Swedish', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'slasher', 'flick', 'Well', 'yes', 'BLOOD', 'RUNS', 'COLD', 'effective', 'chilling', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'couple', 'issues.Before', 'start', 'review', 'feel', 'should', 'preface', 'stating', 'one', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'reveal', 'lot', 'specifics', 'reviews', 'do', 'purpose', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'something', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'already', 'disclosed', 'everything', 'are', 'couple', 'big', 'aspects', 'one', 'bugged', ""'m"", 'going', 'point', 'out', 'see', 'anyone', 'same.BLOOD', 'RUNS', 'COLD', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'overall', 'are', 'few', 'shaky', 'camera', 'angles', 'when', 'intensity', 'up', 'nothing', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'overall', 'Also', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'truly', 'cringe-inducing', 'scenes', 'get', 'nice', 'boost', 'top', 'notch', 'carnage.The', 'story', 'impressive', 'as', 'well', 'concept', 'someone', 'wrong', 'house', 'mistake', 'pays', 'horrific', 'way', 'not', 'new', 'production', 'team', 'great', 'job', 'scaring', 'regardless', 'particularly', 'killer', 'creepy', 'would', 'do', 'Jason', 'Vorhees', 'justice', 'invincible', 'slasher', 'department.But', 'BLOOD', 'RUNS', 'COLD', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'pulled', 'film', 'First', 'acting', 'weird', 'cast', 'have', 'lot', 'potential', 'lines', 'come', 'off', 'bland', 'non-effective', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'are', 'speaking', 'English', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'primary', 'language.Secondly', 'are', 'NO', 'explanations', 'given', 'who', 'killer', 'why', 'cannibal', 'even', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'are', 'told', 'reasons', 'silver-colored', 'eyes', 'have', 'see', 'why', 'hidden', 'ice-cave', 'house', 'want', 'be', 'technical', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'told', 'why', 'attacking', 'people', 'first', 'place', 'assumed', 'are', 'trespassing', 'house', 'never', 'really', 'stated.These', 'issues', 'are', 'strictly', 'opinions', 'might', 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'know', 'devoted', 'horror', 'aficionados', 'will', 'be', 'annoyed', 'them.As', 'recommendation', 'BLOOD', 'RUNS', 'COLD', 'going', 'Make', 'Own', 'Mind', 'Up', 'list', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'non-diehard', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'not', 'film', 'available', 'today', 'variety', 'formats']",Blood Runs Cold [Blu-ray]

Here she meets her old boyfriend Rick (Patrick Saxe) who can't read a line and his two lively friends Liz (Elin Hugoson) and Carl (Andreas Rylander). They decide to take the ""party"" back to the house, one that has an unwanted guest who looks exactly like the guy on the cover.The opening scene was a slasher special effects dream. The were cold faces covered blood and snow. The older dried blood had turned dark, almost black, while the fresh blood from the wound was bright red, dripping like Karo syrup. Snowflakes that had fallen on his coat was mixed with blood. Clearly they knew what they were doing with special effects. The plot wasn't very linear and the action starts at 40 minutes into this 77 ,minute film, which accounts for the teaser opening shot.The acting was not impressive, these are all newcomers. They also needed better lines. Toward the end when a head is smashed, we see the guy move his hand to the rock on his face to steady it. They could have cut out a few seconds, but I guess a 76 1/2 minute movie doesn't sell as well as a 77 minute film.Now in a Scooby-Doo mystery they introduce the kindly Mr. Carswell in the beginning so we can figure out who the villian is in the first three minutes. I have seen the film and I don't know who it is.

1576179,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B008U0XQ3K,The Wiz,"[0, 1]","A young musician (?) takes a vacation to an old, secluded house in the woods and after bumping into an ex-lover, invites him and his friends back to her creepy cottage for lots of beer followed by pairing up for some casual sex, followed by non-stop terror.I'm guessing this is a Euro flick (Stockholm Syndrome Films) that's thankfully filmed in English possibly explaining why the acting is fairly mediocre which actually works just fine for the genre.  Unfortunately, the score sounds like something you might hear on Music from the Hearts of Space detracting a bit from the overall scary mood not to mention the gratuitous yet annoying addition of obnoxious language (not surprisingly coming mainly from the actor with the best American accent) and yep... it's a slasher film so there's graphic violence (e.g. spurting blood decapitations etc.) but not meticulously filmed like, say for example, ""Evil Dead"" 2013.Okay, I'm sure the discerning viewer will inevitably pick up on the occasional plot problem but the pacing helps leave them in the rearview mirror of oncoming suspense punctuated by genuinely creepy moments not to mention some singularly artistic shots featuring a surreal, wintry forest that only adds to the overall atmosphere of isolation (kinda like in ""The Shining"").  Non-Hollywood-adrenaline-fests also allow the viewer an opportunity to appreciate details like in the country at night, regardless of how well lit the inside, is pitch black further emphasizing the mood of seclusion as well as the potential to make a legitimately scary film without lots of FX.  Not really sure why the genre seems to always feature female protagonists but this one (played by Hanna Oldenburg) does a great job and I guess if it works right...  :o)",3,Another Reason Indie Horror Rocks,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1755,"['young', 'musician', 'vacation', 'old', 'secluded', 'house', 'woods', 'bumping', 'ex-lover', 'friends', 'back', 'creepy', 'cottage', 'lots', 'beer', 'followed', 'pairing', 'up', 'casual', 'sex', 'followed', 'non-stop', 'terror.I', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Euro', 'flick', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'Films', 'thankfully', 'filmed', 'English', 'possibly', 'explaining', 'why', 'acting', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'actually', 'just', 'fine', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'score', 'something', 'might', 'hear', 'Music', 'Hearts', 'Space', 'detracting', 'bit', 'overall', 'scary', 'mood', 'not', 'mention', 'gratuitous', 'yet', 'annoying', 'addition', 'obnoxious', 'language', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'coming', 'mainly', 'actor', 'best', 'American', 'accent', 'slasher', 'film', 'graphic', 'violence', 'e.g', 'spurting', 'blood', 'decapitations', 'etc', 'not', 'meticulously', 'filmed', 'say', 'example', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2013.Okay', ""'m"", 'sure', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'will', 'inevitably', 'pick', 'up', 'occasional', 'plot', 'problem', 'pacing', 'leave', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'oncoming', 'suspense', 'punctuated', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'not', 'mention', 'singularly', 'artistic', 'shots', 'featuring', 'surreal', 'wintry', 'forest', 'only', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'isolation', 'kinda', 'Shining', 'Non-Hollywood-adrenaline-fests', 'also', 'allow', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'appreciate', 'details', 'country', 'night', 'regardless', 'how', 'well', 'inside', 'pitch', 'black', 'further', 'emphasizing', 'mood', 'seclusion', 'as', 'well', 'potential', 'make', 'legitimately', 'scary', 'film', 'lots', 'FX', 'Not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'genre', 'always', 'feature', 'female', 'protagonists', 'one', 'played', 'Hanna', 'Oldenburg', 'great', 'job', 'guess', 'right', 'o']",Blood Runs Cold [Blu-ray]
