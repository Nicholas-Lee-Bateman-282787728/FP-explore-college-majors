It's not too horribly gross, (except maybe for the scene with the tongue), and it's not very creepy, or too scary,  It's also not at all a comedy, though it is a bit tongue-in-cheek (in more ways than one).  It's just, well...  Fun!If you've ever read any books about witchcraft, or seen old woodcuts of people's visions of witchcraft during the 16th century, you'll recognize the themes and images in this film.  You'll get the witch hunter holding onto the flying warlock with a rope, nails being driven into footprints, the whole bit...  And you really should look up the traditional main ingredient of the infamous flying ointment before watching.This film works from the premise that everything in the old witchcraft books is literally true, and it plays out in a very entertaining, visually distinctive way.  It was well-researched enough to really make the premise work, without being so slavish as to detract from the plot.  The warlock is every bit as evil as the old books would have it, and is most definitely in league with The Devil Himself.And I've got to say it:  Julian Sands is just plain COOL.",5,16th century  visions of witchcraft brought to life,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1147,"['First', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'horribly', 'gross', 'maybe', 'scene', 'tongue', 'not', 'very', 'creepy', 'too', 'scary', 'also', 'not', 'comedy', 'bit', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'just', 'well', 'Fun', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'books', 'witchcraft', 'seen', 'old', 'woodcuts', 'people', 'visions', 'witchcraft', '16th', 'century', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'themes', 'images', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'witch', 'hunter', 'holding', 'flying', 'warlock', 'rope', 'nails', 'being', 'driven', 'footprints', 'whole', 'bit', 'really', 'should', 'look', 'up', 'traditional', 'main', 'ingredient', 'infamous', 'flying', 'ointment', 'watching.This', 'film', 'premise', 'everything', 'old', 'witchcraft', 'books', 'literally', 'true', 'out', 'very', 'entertaining', 'visually', 'distinctive', 'way', 'was', 'well-researched', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'premise', 'work', 'being', 'so', 'slavish', 'detract', 'plot', 'warlock', 'bit', 'as', 'evil', 'old', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'definitely', 'league', 'Devil', 'Himself.And', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'just', 'plain', 'COOL']",Warlock

190165,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,1573624101,Anthony Hand,"[3, 3]","I sat down to 'Warlock' with no illusion that it was somehow going to be be the masterpiece of horror that passed me by years ago and I got pretty much what I expected. A standard 80's, somewhat tame, horror flick. It's more a fantasy film than horror, as there is no real horror element to it. The film is akin more to 'Highlander' than it is to 'Mark of the Devil' and even by the over zealous nature of censorship of horror movies in the 80's, it's extremely tepid.The story, which has been covered on the site before, deals with transportation of a 17th Century Boston warlock (Julian Sands) to ""modern day"" America and the persuit of him by the witch hunter Giles Redferne (Richard E. Grant) and 80's chick Kassandra (Lori Singer) as he attempts to stop the necromancer from discovering the locations of a Grand Grimoire, a satanic tome which will revel the true name of God and enable the warlock to undo all of creation...somehow.The story is bunkum, of course, but in films of this type that is usually of a secondary or even tertiary concern. So, it suffices, for the purposes to putting the characters in the places they need to be. But that's it. The makeup and effects are generally sub-par, even for the period, the acting from Lori Singer is awful and the general setting of ""modern day"" America has been done a thousand times before and it presents nothing new here.All that should mean that 'Warlock' is not a good film and it's not. it's not even a horror film...but...it's not a bad film either. It does an admirable job during its opening and manages to retain the viewers interest throughout its running time, which is commendable in itself. Julian Sands lends a certain gravity to his part and is very watchable. He plays his character completely straightfaced and it's all the better for it. Grant, complete with dodgy Scottish accent, seems to think the whole thing is nonsense, but he's enjoying himself and it comes across. Out of the three leads, Singer is the worst by far. In fairness, her character is limited (although the rapid aging is a good angle), but she just isn't that good an actress and comes across as irritating.Even so, the 90+ minutes of 'Warlock' passes by relatively harmlessly and there are enough good scenes to reward the viewing. Sands and Grant's funny ""period talking"" is entertaining and the film as a whole is not without its charm. Overall, it's worth a watch, but I don't believe I will be seeking out the sequels.",2,The horror...the horror,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2470,"['sat', 'down', ""'Warlock"", 'illusion', 'was', 'somehow', 'going', 'be', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'passed', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'A', 'standard', '80', 'somewhat', 'tame', 'horror', 'flick', 'more', 'fantasy', 'film', 'horror', 'real', 'horror', 'element', 'film', 'akin', 'more', ""'Highlander"", ""'Mark"", 'Devil', 'even', 'over', 'zealous', 'nature', 'censorship', 'horror', 'movies', '80', 'extremely', 'tepid.The', 'story', 'been', 'covered', 'site', 'deals', 'transportation', '17th', 'Century', 'Boston', 'warlock', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'persuit', 'witch', 'hunter', 'Giles', 'Redferne', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', '80', 'chick', 'Kassandra', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'stop', 'necromancer', 'discovering', 'locations', 'Grand', 'Grimoire', 'satanic', 'tome', 'will', 'revel', 'true', 'name', 'God', 'enable', 'warlock', 'undo', 'creation', 'somehow.The', 'story', 'bunkum', 'course', 'films', 'type', 'usually', 'secondary', 'even', 'tertiary', 'concern', 'So', 'purposes', 'putting', 'characters', 'places', 'need', 'be', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'generally', 'sub-par', 'even', 'period', 'acting', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'awful', 'general', 'setting', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'been', 'done', 'thousand', 'times', 'nothing', 'new', 'here.All', 'should', 'mean', ""'Warlock"", 'not', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'not', 'even', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'admirable', 'job', 'opening', 'retain', 'viewers', 'interest', 'running', 'time', 'commendable', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'certain', 'gravity', 'part', 'very', 'watchable', 'character', 'completely', 'straightfaced', 'better', 'Grant', 'complete', 'dodgy', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'nonsense', 'enjoying', 'across', 'three', 'leads', 'Singer', 'worst', 'far', 'fairness', 'character', 'limited', 'rapid', 'aging', 'good', 'angle', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'actress', 'across', 'irritating.Even', 'so', '90+', 'minutes', ""'Warlock"", 'passes', 'relatively', 'harmlessly', 'are', 'enough', 'good', 'scenes', 'reward', 'viewing', 'Sands', 'Grant', 'funny', 'period', 'talking', 'entertaining', 'film', 'whole', 'not', 'charm', 'Overall', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'seeking', 'sequels']",Warlock

We are not ""horror"" fans AT ALL (my favorite film is Kiera Knightley's ""Pride and Prejudice""!) Both Richard E Grant and Julian Sands are very well respected , serious English actors so... we gave it a chance. Oddly enough with a change of costume, both guys would have fit right into ""Pride and Prejudice"" .  The Warlock (Julian Sands ) is oddly sexy and disdainfully handsome (Julian Sands would have made an EXCELLENT ""Mr.Darcy"") and plays his role with a cool , creepy, detachment that makes ( what could have been a silly role had another actor been cast)for a chilling, interesting performance. You are at once both attracted and repelled by him. Richard E Grant,(Redfern) the ""Warlock Hunter"" (who has followed the Warlock from Colonial -era Boston into the the present) plays his role without a hint of irony. He is out of place in the modern world but is so earnest in his portrayl of ""Redfern"" that you truly believe that he has traveled across time to destroy the evil villain who has slain his beloved young bride. Richard E Grant forms an unlikely alliance with a young 20 something named ""Kasandra with a K"" (as she cheekily informs Richard E Grant when they meet) who has had the misfortune to have crossed paths with the ""Wicked One"" and has had a deadly curse cast upon her. Time is running out for Kasandra and despite Redfern's misgivings at Miss K's foul mouth, punky clothes, make-up and attitude, they set out on an odd ,harrowing,journey (that is not with-out some unexpected flashes of humor).

This is the start of the trilogy, a great beginning, which could have been SO much better but unfortunately wasn't.  First of all in part three he was haunting a house and was played by Bruce Payne...  Bad choice people no matter how well he did still a bad move.  Secondly in the second installment, they had Julian Sands, -- which helps -- but why was he bugging druids?!  Hmmmm?  I won't even get into the whole thing about what Warlock really means (though totally cool sounding it is not a male Witch), or the matter of 16th century witchcraft bogus and concocted for many plausible reasons -- certainly more so than believing folk used their brooms for more than sweeping...  :-)  I'll just stick to the facts of the film:  In Warlock Julian Sands is caught and tried for Witchcraft and soon to be executed (why wait I say!) and during this time Redferne (the olde tyme dude who caught him) comes to confront him, though there seems little point in it.  Soon weirdness abounds and a storm comes up which takes our villain three hundred years into the future and -- whoops -- Redferne too!  From there on all heck breaks loose and sucks in a poor unsuspecting gal which soon discovers she must accompany Redferne in his quest or die a victim of the Warlock curse.  Hmm, well it was good.  Great even.  The BEST I'd say...  Well, of the trilogy.  Tragically you just don't see many good fantasy/Witchy movies much.  I gave this one a five of five.  Warlock 2: The Armegeddon.  This one apparently goes back farther in time for our origin story with little point.  Cool effects and supporting cast make this one more than the story.  To get to the point the Druids have long since known about the Warlock (who is more billed as ""Satan's Son"" in this one than the previous -- Dunno how that happened) and have anticipated his coming and destruction since eons past.  Okay.  No need to split hairs like the Druids where not Christian and worshiped nature and didn't believe in Satan either, for that matter.  SHRUG  Onward.  Two kids, who happen to be boyfriend and girlfriend, who live in a tiny backward town must become Warriors and defeat the Warlock.  Confused?  If you place ALL you may know about reality aside and let your mind veg you might really enjoy this one.  I gave it a four of five.  Warlock 3: The End Of Innocence.  SIGH  I don't understand even the title as it has diddley-squat to do with the movie,  Apparently in this one The Warlock can change appearances and is back, but hiding out, for whatever reason.

190180,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1573624101,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I can't hate on WARLOCK; I think it's a cool horror adventure flick. The special effects aren't so special, yeah, but that's one of the few negs I can come up with. The cast is terrific, and the story moves like a mother, one of them frantic cross-country chases with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Pretty cool shizzy, and here and there WARLOCK finds time to throw in bits of quirky humor.When the bread don't rise, when the beer goes flat, when the horse sweats in the morning, then you know you got big trouble. In the year 1691, in Boston, Massachusetts, it is the eve of a warlock's - a male witch's - execution, except that the warlock is able to summon the forces of evil and he escapes into the future. Three hundred years into the future, to modern-day Los Angeles. There, he begins gathering the three segments of the Grand Grimoire, the indestructible Bible of black magic, somewhere in which pages is hidden the lost name of God, and whosoever utters this name, back to front, will bring about the unmaking of creation. The only hope lies in Giles Redferne, the intrepid witch hunter who had originally captured the warlock. Redferne himself had been flung into the future, and he doesn't waste time going after the warlock, armed with his superstitious savvy, his bullwhip, his blood-activated witch compass, an iron weather vane, and lots and lots of salt. But try to ignore that shabby fur coat.There isn't a lot of gore in WARLOCK, but the story is nevertheless fraught with atmosphere and tension. Partly it's because the film's pace is brisk. There isn't a lot of down time in the film. The protagonist is no-nonsense and his 20th century companion is caught up in her own desperate straits, and so both stay on mission. And I guess I'll mention that Lori Singer is in this. She plays Kassandra (""with a K""), a diabetic free spirit who dreads getting old. Kassandra survives the warlock's early attentions, but not before he curses her with accelerated aging. You get the definite sense that Kassandra is more bent on (very reluctantly) going after the warlock more to regain her youth than because the end of the world is nigh. But at least she's refreshingly honest about it. It's also fun watching Grant's driven intensity clash with Singer's more laid back California vibe. One of the film's strengths is the odd couple chemistry between Singer and Richard E. Grant (the witch hunter). I really enjoy their interactions:- Kassandra, hesitantly, after surviving that first attack: ""That guy was a warlock?""- The Witch Hunter, almost with relish: ""The rudest that ever troubled daylight.""There are some nice action sequences, and you feel good with this witch hunter on your side because he seems to really know what he's doing. I particularly liked the sequence at the Mennonite farm, liked the contrast of the picturesque scenery outside with the evil lurking up in the household rafters. I'm not so down with the semi-tacky f/x of the warlock darting around in the air. And there are moments when Lori Singer occasionally forgets when she's in her old lady phase.WARLOCK's not so secret weapons are Julian Sands and Richard E. Grant. Both go over-the-top and yet their performances are amazing in the way that only Brits can get away with. Well-kempt Julian Sands as the warlock and supposed ""son of Satan"" spews a delectable malevolence, and most of his deeds are performed off-screen or in the viewer's imagination. Except for when he chops off that finger. That was pretty nasty. Sands chews the scenery, tears into his lines, chews the tongue off a guy's mouth...Even more than Sands' wallowing in gothic-flourished language, I got a kick out Richard E. Grant and his cool Scottish accent. As reflective of his witch hunter's 17th century period, he's got a wonderfully twisty way about his dialogue. Stuff like ""Are you daft? 'Tis mine own casket!"" or ""Never can no witch set foot on consecrated ground."" roll marvelously off his tongue. It's awesome stuff. Not to mention, there's huge entertainment value in watching our time-misplaced witch hunter acclimate to his modern-day surroundings.

Well, Sands as the Warlock really throws himself thoroughly into acting this part.  He seems to give his best acting skills to what is, let's be honest, a second-rate film.  He plays a charater that is completely, entirely evil (what more could one expect of one Satan is willing to make his chosen one?)--with no redeeming features.  He does it with a quiet intensity that actually starts to draw one into the story.  Second to him is Richard Grant's performance as his nemesis, the witch (the movie keeps changing the reference-witch, warlock--who cares?  Witch seems to be the generic term and most were female; warlock is specifically a male witch..but I digress)  Grant as the witch hunter does I'd say the second-best performance, with Lori Singer trailing in 3rd place as a modern LA girl caught up by circumstance (and romantic interest to the witch hunter).  The soundtrack is nothing special.  Some decent performances by supporting actors (like a Mennonite farm owner, for example) help a bit.  The visuals do manage to get generally better toward the end of the movie.  If you like a modest attempt at another ""save the world from Satan"" movie, maybe you will like it.  Just don't expect The Omen....",2,If You Like A Real Review - Warlock,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2055,"['watched', 'Warlock', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.Interestingly', 'somehow', 'spawned', 'sequels', 'Warlock', 'II', 'Warlock', 'IIIalthough', '3rd', 'movie', 'only', 'nominally', 'sequel', 'none', 'actors', 'plot', 'bear', 'much', 'resemblance', 'first', 'second', 'films.Very', 'early', 'thoughts', 'were', 'What', 'bad', 'film', 'worse', 'NO', 'ENGLISH', 'SUBTITLES', 'sure', 'sign', 'low', 'budget', 'Second', 'Oh', 'horror', 'horror', 'bad', 'CG', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'scary', ""n't"", 'gross', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'amply', 'sketched', 'plot', 'plot', 'thin', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'shakey', 'times', 'budget', 'limited', 'acting', 'lame', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'movies', 'actually', 'watched', 'complete', 'thing', 'one', 'sitting', 'not', 'bad', 'What', 'movie', 'Well', 'Sands', 'Warlock', 'really', 'thoroughly', 'acting', 'part', 'give', 'best', 'acting', 'skills', 'what', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'second-rate', 'film', 'charater', 'completely', 'entirely', 'evil', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'expect', 'one', 'Satan', 'willing', 'make', 'chosen', 'one', 'redeeming', 'features', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'actually', 'draw', 'one', 'story', 'Second', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'performance', 'nemesis', 'witch', 'movie', 'changing', 'reference-witch', 'warlock', 'who', 'Witch', 'be', 'generic', 'term', 'most', 'were', 'female', 'warlock', 'specifically', 'male', 'witch..but', 'digress', 'Grant', 'witch', 'hunter', ""'d"", 'say', 'second-best', 'performance', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'trailing', '3rd', 'place', 'modern', 'LA', 'girl', 'caught', 'up', 'circumstance', 'romantic', 'interest', 'witch', 'hunter', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'special', 'decent', 'performances', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Mennonite', 'farm', 'owner', 'example', 'help', 'bit', 'visuals', 'do', 'manage', 'get', 'generally', 'better', 'end', 'movie', 'like', 'modest', 'attempt', 'save', 'world', 'Satan', 'movie', 'maybe', 'will', 'like', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Omen']",Warlock

190201,A1AST89AHN17O7,1573624101,Omnes,"[2, 2]","In the seventeenth century, a warlock (Julian Sands) escapes from its prison tower and time-travels up to 1988 as he tries to find the pieces of a lost Bible that would enable him to find the name of God and uncreate the world. Unfortunately for him, the witchhunter Redferne (Richard E. Grant), who captured him and time-traveled on that time period, and a woman called Kassandra (Lori Singer), whom the warlock put an aging curse on her, are on his trail and will do everything to stop him.Now the movie is far from being perfect for there are some one-liners that more or less worked, and some plotholes like how the witchhunter Redferne, when asking the help of a mormon priest, knows anything about mormons when they are not from his time period, but from the 19th century. Not only that, although some special effects were well done, I still felt that some shots were bad and created some illogical situations, like in the cemetary when the warlock casts fireballs in Redferne's mouth for when it happened, I really wondered as to how Redferne could be able to spit them out of his mouth and still be alive for if some wizard tried that trick on me, I know that I would be ""dead"", which is why it is so weird to see Redferne still alive and his mouth still intact.Come to think of it, and of plotholes, I still wonder how Redferne manages to time-travel back to his time period at the end of the story when there is no warlock around him that can do so.Nevertheless, I think Warlock is a fun movie to watch during the evening or if you want to take a good look at to how they did visual effects before computers became as evolved as they are today and started to over-kill some movies. Not only that, it is just great to see Julian Sands (Room with a View, Gothic, Boxing Helena) and Richard E. Grant (Captain Star, Corpse Bride, Wah Wah diaries) together on the same screen. All those actors, along with Lori Singer (Footloose, Fame, Short Cuts) add a lot of energy and depth to their characters who, in the wrong hands, could have been very ordinary and Hollywood-like in their interpretations. It is also fun to see Julian Sands play such an evil character and Richard E Grant such a macho role, which isn't what he usually does. Finally, although Lori Singer, from what I've read on Richard E Grant's website, wasn't too pleased with her script and her character, I thought that she gave a great job. At least her character wasn't some whiny sex-object bimbo who would become a device for some sex scenes with the main male character. Her Kassandra had at least enough will and intelligence to be an interesting character to watch.In the end, I would like to say how sad it is that they couldn't state in the movie what is shown on the poster, that the warlock is Satan's son. I find it weird that the studios were able to make a movie about witchcraft, dead children being eaten by warlock so that they could get powers, curses, and possessed people, but couldn't mention the Demon's name. If they had done so, I am sure the story would have been better understood, especially in the beginning as the Warlock is freed from its cell by some mysterious force that is unexplained.",4,Fun to watch,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3188,"['seventeenth', 'century', 'warlock', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'prison', 'tower', 'time-travels', 'up', '1988', 'find', 'pieces', 'lost', 'Bible', 'would', 'enable', 'find', 'name', 'God', 'uncreate', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'witchhunter', 'Redferne', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'who', 'captured', 'time-traveled', 'time', 'period', 'woman', 'called', 'Kassandra', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'whom', 'warlock', 'put', 'aging', 'curse', 'are', 'trail', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'stop', 'movie', 'far', 'being', 'perfect', 'are', 'one-liners', 'more', 'less', 'worked', 'plotholes', 'how', 'witchhunter', 'Redferne', 'when', 'asking', 'help', 'mormon', 'priest', 'anything', 'mormons', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'time', 'period', '19th', 'century', 'Not', 'only', 'that', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'still', 'felt', 'shots', 'were', 'bad', 'created', 'illogical', 'situations', 'cemetary', 'when', 'warlock', 'fireballs', 'Redferne', 'mouth', 'when', 'happened', 'really', 'wondered', 'how', 'Redferne', 'could', 'be', 'able', 'spit', 'mouth', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'wizard', 'tried', 'trick', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'why', 'so', 'weird', 'see', 'Redferne', 'still', 'alive', 'mouth', 'still', 'intact.Come', 'think', 'plotholes', 'still', 'wonder', 'how', 'Redferne', 'manages', 'time-travel', 'back', 'time', 'period', 'end', 'story', 'when', 'warlock', 'around', 'can', 'do', 'so.Nevertheless', 'think', 'Warlock', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'evening', 'want', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'how', 'did', 'visual', 'effects', 'computers', 'became', 'as', 'evolved', 'are', 'today', 'started', 'over-kill', 'movies', 'Not', 'only', 'just', 'great', 'see', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Room', 'View', 'Gothic', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Captain', 'Star', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'Wah', 'Wah', 'diaries', 'together', 'same', 'screen', 'actors', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'Footloose', 'Fame', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'add', 'lot', 'energy', 'depth', 'characters', 'who', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'ordinary', 'Hollywood-like', 'interpretations', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'play', 'evil', 'character', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'macho', 'role', ""n't"", 'what', 'usually', 'Finally', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'website', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'script', 'character', 'thought', 'gave', 'great', 'job', 'least', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'whiny', 'sex-object', 'bimbo', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'device', 'sex', 'scenes', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Kassandra', 'had', 'least', 'enough', 'will', 'intelligence', 'be', 'interesting', 'character', 'watch.In', 'end', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'how', 'sad', 'could', ""n't"", 'state', 'movie', 'what', 'shown', 'poster', 'warlock', 'Satan', 'son', 'find', 'studios', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'movie', 'witchcraft', 'dead', 'children', 'being', 'eaten', 'warlock', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'powers', 'curses', 'possessed', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Demon', 'name', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'am', 'sure', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'understood', 'especially', 'beginning', 'Warlock', 'freed', 'cell', 'mysterious', 'force', 'unexplained']",Warlock

190205,AN36A6JDBCVHC,1573624101,R. Smith,"[1, 2]","Always loved this suprising b movie.  It's just a great story all around, with performances that fit the characters.  Excellent Saturday afternoon fare with a bunch of quotable lines ;-).  What I've never liked - and what seems to be a common review failing - is that a widescreen version never appears to have been released.  VHS, LD and DVD NTSC and PAL... whenever I've searched they all come up full screen.Last night, out of the blue, I looked again and was tempted to buy the Amazon Instant Video to see if maybe it was widescreen, because there have been times with other movies where for some reason Amazon Instant had them whlle no one else and no other format did.  Before I payed  the 2.99, I did a search to see if anyone was saying  that Amazon Instant had it and saw one tip that the other streaming video service (the one with the big red logo) was showing it widescreen.  I called that up and there it was.  A great, clean, clear, relatively amazing print... not cinemescope but wide.That service had a small note on the page for Warlock that said that the version would only be available till April 1st, 2012.  Does this mean that there is a new widescreen dvd/bluray coming out?  I don't know.  If you are reading this after 4-1-12 then you maigh be out of luck.Here's a thing about that streaming widescreen version though... I played it back and forth to compare it to the full screen version that we all know and spotted that we don't really get a huge amount of extra screen content.  It is *almost* like they took the full screen and cropped the tops and bottoms to make a ""widescreen"" version.  Heads and buildings in the original that had lots of sky above them now come up to or are trimmed out of the widescreen version and objects at the side edges are mostly the same (there are a few times when I can look closely and see a tiny bit more on both sides but it's not like the major difference between Lawrence of Arabia's pan & scan vs widescreen.)I may be wrong but it looks like maybe the reason we all have been getting the fullscreen version for years ... which now does not appear to be a pan and scan but rather a full version... is it possible that the vhs/dvd releases were made off of a ""directors cut"" uncropped print, kinda like seeing a Kubrik movie where he didn't like widescreen so the ""directors cuts"" of his stuff are full screen?  From what I understand, and I may be wrong, most movies were/are filmed in a ratio we would call full screen then trimmed to give the wide view.  If that is the case then we pretty much got the full picture all along, and perhaps MORE of the full picture. I can't remember seeing this in the theater, so I don't know if when it was first released the tops of heads came right to the top edge or if there was more to the tops and bottoms like the vhs/dvd shows.Minor thing, sorry for being dweeby about it... the beginning of the streaming wide version does not have the Trimark or New World company logos with the sounds coming up underneath them... it starts cold with the cat being pushed in the basket.  Since the dvd version has the Trimark logo obviously cut on the sides, if it were there on the streaming version we'd know pretty clearly if it was a crop of the full screen version.In any case, the new widescreen definitely comes from a much cleaner print or they did a heck of a job cleaning it up.  I hope it being on the big red streamer means that the widescreen will be coming soon to disc (and now I hope that the bluray has both the new widescreen AND the fullscreen versions both from the clean print)",4,Coming soon to Widescreen?,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3594,"['Always', 'loved', 'suprising', 'b', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'story', 'performances', 'fit', 'characters', 'Excellent', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'fare', 'bunch', 'quotable', 'lines', 'What', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'what', 'be', 'common', 'review', 'failing', 'widescreen', 'version', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'VHS', 'LD', 'DVD', 'NTSC', 'PAL', 'whenever', ""'ve"", 'searched', 'come', 'up', 'full', 'screen.Last', 'night', 'blue', 'looked', 'again', 'was', 'tempted', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'see', 'maybe', 'was', 'widescreen', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'had', 'one', 'else', 'other', 'format', 'did', 'payed', '2.99', 'did', 'search', 'see', 'anyone', 'was', 'saying', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'had', 'saw', 'one', 'tip', 'other', 'streaming', 'video', 'service', 'one', 'big', 'red', 'logo', 'was', 'showing', 'widescreen', 'called', 'up', 'was', 'great', 'clean', 'clear', 'relatively', 'amazing', 'print', 'not', 'cinemescope', 'wide.That', 'service', 'had', 'small', 'note', 'page', 'Warlock', 'said', 'version', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'available', 'till', 'April', '1st', '2012', 'mean', 'new', 'widescreen', 'dvd/bluray', 'coming', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'reading', '4-1-12', 'then', 'maigh', 'be', 'thing', 'streaming', 'widescreen', 'version', 'played', 'back', 'forth', 'compare', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'know', 'spotted', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'huge', 'amount', 'extra', 'screen', 'content', '*almost*', 'took', 'full', 'screen', 'cropped', 'tops', 'bottoms', 'make', 'widescreen', 'version', 'Heads', 'buildings', 'original', 'had', 'lots', 'sky', 'now', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'trimmed', 'widescreen', 'version', 'objects', 'side', 'edges', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'look', 'closely', 'see', 'tiny', 'bit', 'more', 'sides', 'not', 'major', 'difference', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'pan', 'scan', 'vs', 'widescreen', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'years', 'now', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'pan', 'scan', 'rather', 'full', 'version', 'possible', 'vhs/dvd', 'releases', 'were', 'made', 'directors', 'cut', 'uncropped', 'print', 'kinda', 'seeing', 'Kubrik', 'movie', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'widescreen', 'so', 'directors', 'cuts', 'stuff', 'are', 'full', 'screen', 'what', 'understand', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'most', 'movies', 'were/are', 'filmed', 'ratio', 'would', 'call', 'full', 'screen', 'then', 'trimmed', 'give', 'wide', 'view', 'case', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'full', 'picture', 'along', 'perhaps', 'MORE', 'full', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'tops', 'heads', 'came', 'right', 'top', 'edge', 'was', 'more', 'tops', 'bottoms', 'vhs/dvd', 'shows.Minor', 'thing', 'sorry', 'being', 'dweeby', 'beginning', 'streaming', 'wide', 'version', 'not', 'have', 'Trimark', 'New', 'World', 'company', 'logos', 'sounds', 'coming', 'up', 'cold', 'cat', 'being', 'pushed', 'basket', 'dvd', 'version', 'Trimark', 'logo', 'obviously', 'cut', 'sides', 'were', 'there', 'streaming', 'version', ""'d"", 'know', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'was', 'crop', 'full', 'screen', 'version.In', 'case', 'new', 'widescreen', 'definitely', 'much', 'cleaner', 'print', 'did', 'heck', 'job', 'cleaning', 'hope', 'being', 'big', 'red', 'streamer', 'widescreen', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'soon', 'disc', 'now', 'hope', 'bluray', 'new', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'clean', 'print']",Warlock
190206,A1X4IYNVANVVUD,1573624101,sOULiON,"[1, 2]","A very entertaining piece of movie you shouldn't take to serious but enjoy. Julian Sands is playing a male witch that's been sent by the devil himself into the future to combine the single pieces of his unholy book, The Great Grimoire. Followed by a witch hunter named Redfern that seeks to avenge the death of his beloved wife, Richard E. Grant turns out to be a great counterpart for Satan's Son Sands. Lori Singer as the young woman that's supposed to help Redfern though she's first  very sceptic about everything supernatural is just a grey  mouse compared to the smashing acting of Sands &amp; Grant. Another negative point about that movie that has could  done a lot better is the large ammount of grandmommy  superstition that could have been left out if you ask me (though it gives some funny phrases, but it's mostly more anoying than entertaining). But still - this is a movie you should check out if you like to know what the comming of the devil's son could be like  (and DON'T think of Adam Sandler here). The scene where Sands yells at god after knowing his true name has become one of my favourite movie scenes ever. They couldn't chose a better one.And don't waste too much time with the sequel as it turns out to be a teen horror movie. Great acting from Sands still, but the plot is flat and a whimpy Bud Bundy look-alike is no counterpart for the devil like Redfern/Grant was.Get the original and unleash the witch !",4,Sands is diabolical !,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,1436,"['very', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'serious', 'enjoy', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'playing', 'male', 'witch', 'been', 'sent', 'devil', 'future', 'combine', 'single', 'pieces', 'unholy', 'book', 'Great', 'Grimoire', 'Followed', 'witch', 'hunter', 'named', 'Redfern', 'avenge', 'death', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'counterpart', 'Satan', 'Son', 'Sands', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'young', 'woman', 'supposed', 'help', 'Redfern', 'first', 'very', 'sceptic', 'everything', 'supernatural', 'just', 'grey', 'mouse', 'compared', 'smashing', 'acting', 'Sands', 'amp', 'Grant', 'negative', 'point', 'movie', 'could', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'large', 'ammount', 'grandmommy', 'superstition', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'ask', 'funny', 'phrases', 'mostly', 'more', 'anoying', 'entertaining', 'still', 'movie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'comming', 'devil', 'son', 'could', 'be', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'think', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'here', 'scene', 'where', 'Sands', 'god', 'knowing', 'true', 'name', 'become', 'one', 'favourite', 'movie', 'scenes', 'ever', 'could', ""n't"", 'chose', 'better', 'one.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'sequel', 'out', 'be', 'teen', 'horror', 'movie', 'Great', 'acting', 'Sands', 'still', 'plot', 'flat', 'whimpy', 'Bud', 'Bundy', 'look-alike', 'counterpart', 'devil', 'Redfern/Grant', 'was.Get', 'original', 'unleash', 'witch']",Warlock

A pretty standard idea that combines elements of Terminator with more traditional boogeyman characteristics is given quite a bit of life thanks to a very strong cast (especially Sands as the heavy, but the rest of the cast is worthy of note as well) and a very smart, engrossing script by David Twohy, one of the best filmmakers/writers in the science fiction and horror genres today.Much like Curt Siodmak did with his trailblazing script for the Wolfman, Twohy puts together a whole mythology from bits of superstition, previous fiction/lore, and A LOT of creativity.Steve Miner pulled directing duties and, quite honestly, I've always liked his genre efforts (excluding his Day of the Dead)and this is easily his best movie. Unfortunately the special effects are lackluster, this is a low budget movie and some of the more extravagant ideas are not realized very well. I really couldn't care less, but I know that some have a hard time.This one is definately a personal favorite and, so, I might have overrated it a little bit; however, this movie is just plain fun, original, and full of energy.
