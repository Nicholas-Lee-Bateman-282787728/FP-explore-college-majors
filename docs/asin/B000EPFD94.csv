It was good to see some of my favorite guitar players again. Granted the songs don't have the same edge as they did with Phil singing and playing bass, but personally I am glad this concert was filmed and shared with the fans. The interviews are a nice added feature to the DVD.Too bad John Sikes and Snowy White were not present. Brian, Scott, and Eric each took turns sharing the stage with Gary, but I wish there could have been at least one song where ALL the guitarists played together.",4,Great DVD for Thin Lizzy fans,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,583,"['was', 'very', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'filming', 'great', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'favorite', 'guitar', 'players', 'again', 'Granted', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'edge', 'did', 'Phil', 'singing', 'playing', 'bass', 'personally', 'am', 'glad', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'shared', 'fans', 'interviews', 'are', 'nice', 'added', 'feature', 'DVD.Too', 'bad', 'John', 'Sikes', 'Snowy', 'White', 'were', 'not', 'present', 'Brian', 'Scott', 'Eric', 'took', 'sharing', 'stage', 'Gary', 'wish', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'one', 'song', 'where', 'guitarists', 'played', 'together']",N/A

976114,A2ZZULCTI40V3A,B000EPFD94,Hellion Zephreid,"[1, 1]","Let me start out this review by saying that I have known about this dvd for about a year.  It has been sitting in ""My Cart"" since then and something else always won my interest on my limited income.  I knew that I would eventually buy this and now that I had, I kick myself for not buying it sooner over the new Iron Maiden, Rainbow, UFO, or Symphony X releases.  Let me also state that I think this concert is for the Gary Moore or Thin Lizzy fan.  My wife noticed a smile on my face a few different times during this show.  Let me tell you, as a life long Lizzy fan, things like this just make me feel warm all over.  Brian Downey behind the drum kit for the entire show adds to the tribute.  Seeing Scott Gorham playing with Gary Moore again and the two of them obviously enjoying themselves and playing flawlessly, this is something special.  Brian Robertson and Eric Bell also are given a special place alongside Moore but Gary Moore shows why he is just such a great guitarist and he handles all the lead vocals.  Most of the time he pulls off Phil's vocals just fine.  The show is about an hour long, the brightest moments being Black Rose, Emerald, and the one-two punch of Cowboy Song/Boys Are Back In Town.  Huge thanks has to go out to Gary Moore for putting this tribute concert together with different members of the Thin Lizzy band as a true remembrance of the songs and the person that was Philip Lynott on what would have been his 56th birthday.  I am sure Phil is smiling and thankful from wherever he is.  Thanks again Gary for letting us see the members of Thin Lizzy again and for keeping the music alive.  Special features are interviews with all the members of the band and their memories of Phil.

Let's check them:1) Good factors: sound quality is excellent. Crisp, loud and clear. Brian Downey is playing very steady, as strong a drummer as ever. Gary is playing like hell. Man, this guy is s master of the six-strings. Scott Gorham: the Black Rose instrumental part is breathtaking. The guy played with conviction and hit every note right, enjoying the moment.2) Strange: Gary beginning the show with a solo tune. Maybe he just wanted to warm up the audience... Also, maybe because the concert was an homage to Lynott, the bass player was extremely low profile, even vclearly being clearly professional and a great player. Not bringing Sykes was weird.3) Bad moments: Brian Robertson. It hurted me to see the guy barely being capable of playing, It was clear he was going through the motions. An embarassing moment.Gary singing at the top of his lungs. Subtlety is not a virtue of him... He sings the songs in a harsh and ""brutal"" manner, totally devoid of any of the nuances used by Lynott. This is annoying at sometimes.In genereal, however, this ia a very worth purchase.",3,"Great moments, strange moments, bad moments",1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,1194,"['almost', 'everything', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'DVD', 'great', 'moments', 'strange', 'decisions', 'bad', 'moments', 'Let', 'check', 'them:1', 'Good', 'factors', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'Crisp', 'loud', 'clear', 'Brian', 'Downey', 'playing', 'very', 'steady', 'strong', 'drummer', 'ever', 'Gary', 'playing', 'hell', 'Man', 'guy', 's', 'master', 'six-strings', 'Scott', 'Gorham', 'Black', 'Rose', 'instrumental', 'part', 'breathtaking', 'guy', 'played', 'conviction', 'hit', 'note', 'right', 'enjoying', 'moment.2', 'Strange', 'Gary', 'beginning', 'show', 'solo', 'tune', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'warm', 'up', 'audience', 'Also', 'maybe', 'concert', 'was', 'homage', 'Lynott', 'bass', 'player', 'was', 'extremely', 'low', 'profile', 'even', 'vclearly', 'being', 'clearly', 'professional', 'great', 'player', 'Not', 'bringing', 'Sykes', 'was', 'weird.3', 'Bad', 'moments', 'Brian', 'Robertson', 'hurted', 'see', 'guy', 'barely', 'being', 'capable', 'playing', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'going', 'motions', 'embarassing', 'moment.Gary', 'singing', 'top', 'lungs', 'Subtlety', 'not', 'virtue', 'songs', 'harsh', 'brutal', 'manner', 'totally', 'devoid', 'nuances', 'used', 'Lynott', 'annoying', 'sometimes.In', 'genereal', 'however', 'very', 'worth', 'purchase']",N/A
