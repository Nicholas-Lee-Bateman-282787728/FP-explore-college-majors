1272481,A2OUMZ01OPQGKJ,B002JVWR4U,"Amazon Customer ""castor833""","[0, 1]","I won't write any spoilers except to say this... This last episode was more like a 2 hr movie that got everything but major plot points removed, and possibly a few of those to make the 42 minute cut.I liked it very much but I truly wish Joss Whedon would be left alone to do his work rather than have to deal with the jack a$$es at FOX TV.All of Whedon's shows are planned out in advance in 5 year story arcs, with changes made as needed. However when studio execs insist on useless note after useless note or change or ""maybe add a dog. everyone likes dogs."" , I have to blame them and not the creator of the product for it's failure to be renewed.After all, You are talking about a network the consistently sets its own shows up for failure and then cancels them because the ratings aren't big enough. This is after they have made repeated blunders by interfering with the show or moving them around on the schedule.Examples in no particular order:Firefly - FOX interferred with series order, put on Fridays, and cancelled it after only 8 episodes had aired and refused to air any more. Thank God the movie was made by Universal and not FOX. I hate to see such stupidity rewarded.Dollhouse - FOX interferred with series order, demanded plot changes, put on Fridays, decided not to air during Nov sweeps and then cancelled it because ratings weren't high enough. Fu(King M0rons! Once you get past the mandatory interference from the FOX execs, you got tighter storylines (episodes 6 and up) and as usual much more continuity and charactor development that Joss is justly famous for.Terminator:TSCC - Put it on Fridays and complained that it cost to much. I have no sympathy for FOX. Look at the fanbase screaming to see the mistake made here.Profit(1996) - Cancelled after airing 4 episodes and no DVD release. Watch it yourself and decide after that.Brimstone - Got one season of 13 episodes. It was the Supernatural of its time. Good call, jacka$$es. Wasn't even released on DVD. I had to torrent these to get myself a copy of the series. At least they didn't make any money off me.Family Guy - Seriously, they cancelled it, TWICE, and only brought back due to DVD sales. How many years is it now?Wonderfalls - Ordered 13 episodes (only aired a few of them before cancellation) and a dvd release. Another Bonehead cancellation from the people at FOX.Keen Eddie - ""was an offbeat comedy/drama/buddy cop show that successfully fused British style with a very American sarcastic cop, and it was close in tone to Guy Ritchie movies. And it had Sienna Miller! It would have been easy to miss this show on Fox, as they shuffled it around the schedule and canceled it after seven episodes (6 unaired). The series picked up a following when aired on Bravo, but by then it was too late. I'll never understand how Fox doesn't take their own sucky scheduling into account when judging a show's performance, nor will I understand why they are so anxious to cancel so many shows, not even broadcasting half of the episodes they paid for! They have the attention spans and the patience of two-year olds."" excerpted from [...]Well these are just a few of the wonderfull (Sarcasm detected) decisions made by FOX over time. It makes the rare good calls, like Glee, House and, IMO Fringe, just shine when you look at the rest of FOX's schedule.Well I will get off my soap box and say that I enjoyed both the series and this episode very much and my only criticism is that it was not long enough to really get detailed closure. I have enjoyed all of Joss Whedon's work (BtVS, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dr. Horrible and now Dollhouse) a great deal and I recommend this to anyone who likes stories that entertain and make you ponder ethical questions.""The Difference between Genius and Stupidity is that Stupidity has no limits.""",4,Great show that ended to soon!,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,3811,"['wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'spoilers', 'say', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'more', '2', 'hr', 'movie', 'got', 'everything', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'removed', 'possibly', 'few', 'make', '42', 'minute', 'cut.I', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'truly', 'wish', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'do', 'work', 'rather', 'have', 'deal', 'jack', 'es', 'FOX', 'TV.All', 'Whedon', 'shows', 'are', 'planned', 'out', 'advance', '5', 'year', 'story', 'arcs', 'changes', 'made', 'needed', 'However', 'when', 'studio', 'execs', 'insist', 'useless', 'note', 'useless', 'note', 'change', 'maybe', 'add', 'dog', 'everyone', 'likes', 'dogs', 'have', 'blame', 'not', 'creator', 'product', 'failure', 'be', 'renewed.After', 'are', 'talking', 'network', 'consistently', 'own', 'shows', 'up', 'failure', 'then', 'cancels', 'ratings', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'have', 'made', 'repeated', 'blunders', 'interfering', 'show', 'moving', 'around', 'schedule.Examples', 'particular', 'order', 'Firefly', 'FOX', 'interferred', 'series', 'order', 'put', 'Fridays', 'cancelled', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'had', 'aired', 'refused', 'air', 'more', 'Thank', 'God', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Universal', 'not', 'FOX', 'hate', 'see', 'such', 'stupidity', 'rewarded.Dollhouse', 'FOX', 'interferred', 'series', 'order', 'demanded', 'plot', 'changes', 'put', 'Fridays', 'decided', 'not', 'air', 'Nov', 'sweeps', 'then', 'cancelled', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'Fu', 'King', 'M0rons', 'Once', 'get', 'mandatory', 'interference', 'FOX', 'execs', 'got', 'tighter', 'storylines', '6', 'up', 'usual', 'much', 'more', 'continuity', 'charactor', 'development', 'Joss', 'justly', 'famous', 'for.Terminator', 'TSCC', 'Put', 'Fridays', 'complained', 'cost', 'much', 'have', 'sympathy', 'FOX', 'Look', 'fanbase', 'screaming', 'see', 'mistake', 'made', 'here.Profit', '1996', 'Cancelled', 'airing', '4', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'release', 'Watch', 'decide', 'that.Brimstone', 'Got', 'one', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'was', 'Supernatural', 'time', 'Good', 'call', 'jacka', 'es', 'Was', ""n't"", 'even', 'released', 'DVD', 'had', 'torrent', 'get', 'copy', 'series', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'me.Family', 'Guy', 'Seriously', 'cancelled', 'TWICE', 'only', 'brought', 'back', 'due', 'DVD', 'sales', 'How', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'Wonderfalls', 'Ordered', '13', 'episodes', 'only', 'aired', 'few', 'cancellation', 'dvd', 'release', 'Bonehead', 'cancellation', 'people', 'FOX.Keen', 'Eddie', 'was', 'offbeat', 'comedy/drama/buddy', 'cop', 'show', 'successfully', 'fused', 'British', 'style', 'very', 'American', 'sarcastic', 'cop', 'was', 'close', 'tone', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'movies', 'had', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'miss', 'show', 'Fox', 'shuffled', 'schedule', 'canceled', 'seven', 'episodes', '6', 'unaired', 'series', 'picked', 'up', 'following', 'when', 'aired', 'Bravo', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'late', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'how', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'take', 'own', 'sucky', 'scheduling', 'account', 'when', 'judging', 'show', 'performance', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'anxious', 'cancel', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'not', 'even', 'broadcasting', 'half', 'episodes', 'paid', 'have', 'attention', 'spans', 'patience', 'two-year', 'olds', 'excerpted', '[', ']', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'wonderfull', 'Sarcasm', 'detected', 'decisions', 'made', 'FOX', 'time', 'rare', 'good', 'calls', 'Glee', 'House', 'IMO', 'Fringe', 'just', 'shine', 'when', 'look', 'rest', 'FOX', 'schedule.Well', 'will', 'get', 'off', 'soap', 'box', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'episode', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'criticism', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'really', 'get', 'detailed', 'closure', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'work', 'BtVS', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'Dr.', 'Horrible', 'now', 'Dollhouse', 'great', 'deal', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'stories', 'entertain', 'make', 'ponder', 'ethical', 'questions', 'Difference', 'Genius', 'Stupidity', 'Stupidity', 'limits']",N/A

The concept of the Dollhouse was interesting enough and the engagements each week had merit as stand alone stories.

I feel like in another life, he is a brother to J.J. Abrams who also does brilliant work, but J.J. Abrams is more commercial and gets more ratings, so his shows stay on the air perpetually, while ""Dollhouse,"" Whedon's latest brain child, got cancelled mid-season.  (At least they had the decency to air the full second season.)""Dollhouse"" got off to a rocky start...it was so-so.  I honestly believe a lot had to do with the studio telling Whedon what they wanted and it clashing with his vision.  If you watch his unaired original pilot, and the altered one (and subsequent episodes) you can see where Fox tried to make it more ""commercial.""That said, this is like Whedon squared.  He originally stated he had a very clear 5 season plan for Dollhouse.  But since it was cancelled, you basically have four seasons condensed into one 13 powerful, impressive, episode season, and despite my sadness for the cancellation, the result is a near perfect season of television that pays off in spades.  It's like Whedon condensed everything knowing the ""end was near"" (pardon the pun) and everything we got a glimpse at in Epitaph One, goes seriously complicated, dramatic, surprising, and action-packed.  It's like taking the ""best of,"" and cramming four seasons into one, but every little detail, every plot twist--is thoroughly satisfying,All those boring ho-hum episodes of season one start to come together into something truly extraordinary, and dare I say it, the ultimate Whedonesque plot (""end of civilization, death of characters I will leave nameless, unexpected romance, and that sharp wit he is known for--something lacking in season one--is sharper than sharp here.)All that said, Dollhouse (particularly season 2) is one of the very rare TV shows that I instantly rewatched the entire season to see what subtleties I could pick up on, and just because, frankly it was so awesome.Give ""Dollhouse"" a try, yet another brilliant show that got cancelled, but hopefully will find new life on DVD and Blu-Ray.",5,"Joss Whedon loses again, despite turning out sheer brilliance",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2132,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'rabid', 'fan', 'base', 'consider', 'fan', 'not', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'still', 'respect', 'feel', 'life', 'brother', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'who', 'also', 'brilliant', 'work', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'more', 'commercial', 'more', 'ratings', 'shows', 'stay', 'air', 'perpetually', 'Dollhouse', 'Whedon', 'latest', 'brain', 'child', 'got', 'cancelled', 'mid-season', 'least', 'had', 'decency', 'air', 'full', 'second', 'season', 'Dollhouse', 'got', 'off', 'rocky', 'start', 'was', 'so-so', 'honestly', 'believe', 'lot', 'had', 'do', 'studio', 'telling', 'Whedon', 'what', 'wanted', 'clashing', 'vision', 'watch', 'unaired', 'original', 'pilot', 'altered', 'one', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Fox', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'commercial', 'said', 'Whedon', 'squared', 'originally', 'stated', 'had', 'very', 'clear', '5', 'season', 'plan', 'Dollhouse', 'was', 'cancelled', 'basically', 'have', 'four', 'seasons', 'condensed', 'one', '13', 'powerful', 'impressive', 'episode', 'season', 'sadness', 'cancellation', 'result', 'near', 'perfect', 'season', 'television', 'off', 'spades', 'Whedon', 'condensed', 'everything', 'knowing', 'end', 'was', 'pardon', 'pun', 'everything', 'got', 'glimpse', 'Epitaph', 'One', 'seriously', 'complicated', 'dramatic', 'surprising', 'action-packed', 'taking', 'best', 'cramming', 'four', 'seasons', 'one', 'little', 'detail', 'plot', 'twist', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'boring', 'ho-hum', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'start', 'come', 'together', 'something', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'dare', 'say', 'ultimate', 'Whedonesque', 'plot', 'end', 'civilization', 'death', 'characters', 'will', 'leave', 'nameless', 'unexpected', 'romance', 'sharp', 'wit', 'known', 'something', 'lacking', 'season', 'one', 'sharper', 'sharp', 'here', 'said', 'Dollhouse', 'particularly', 'season', '2', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'TV', 'shows', 'instantly', 'rewatched', 'entire', 'season', 'see', 'what', 'subtleties', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'just', 'frankly', 'was', 'so', 'awesome.Give', 'Dollhouse', 'try', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

Things move from Season One and leap down an elevator shaft with the express car rocketing towards, both on a non-stop trip to hell. Everything gets worse, and the show is better for it.

It wraps up very nicely, if not prettily.The sound track of the DVD is a bit wonky through a 2-channel track, specifically on Disc Three: the sound dips to a whisper then fluctuates back to an audible level several times.

1272512,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002JVWR4U,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","13 Episodes on 4 DVD Discs, released October 12, 2010""Dollhouse"" is a series starring Eliza Dushku as Echo, a woman who is in the care of an organization that wipes the minds of its operatives and then imprints them with different personalities to go out on different missions paid for by clients (as an escort, bodyguard, wife, mother, FBI undercover agent, etc.). When they return, they are wiped clean again and are like child-like dolls walking around an underground house without any memory of these experiences. Echo is a special doll because she becomes self-aware and develops her own identity apart from the other dolls and retains all of the knowledge she has gained. The wiping process no longer works on her brain but she continues to act as a doll biding her time while she plans a way to take the Dollhouse down for good.Her original handler was Boyd Langton played by Harry Lennix, but he is now head of security in the Dollhouse. The science lab geek who has invented the technology and fixes problems from his computer while dolls are in the field is Topher Brink played by Fran Kranz. The head of the Dollhouse is Adelle DeWitt played by the lovely Olivia Williams whose severe haircut for Roman Polanski's film, ""The Ghost Writer"" added a new level of hardness to her character during her journey this season. Other dolls past and present from the Dollhouse that are in this season are Sierra (Dichen Lachman), Victor (Enver Gjokaj), Mellie (Miracle Laurie), and the character revealed to be a former doll in the last season, Dr. Claire Saunders played by Amy Acker who was in another Joss Whedon series ""Angel."" Over the course of the season, loyalties go back and forth, a tech geek and hard British woman develop consciences, Echo becomes a person instead of a blank slate, and the series concludes with a second Epitaph futuristic episode to show that in spite of all the characters' efforts, the future is still a bleak world filled with bandits with guns.The first and second seasons both had 13 episodes and no one believed it would get picked up for a second season, not even Joss Whedon. He made a futuristic ending episode called ""Epitaph"" at the end of Season 1 and when he found out he had more time to play in the Dollhouse, he very quickly made some big adjustments for the second season. The setting looks different, Echo is no longer a blank doll, some characters left and new characters arrive looking very familiar as Whedon pretty much said the heck with it and brought it a whole bunch of old friends from other projects he worked on.Alexis Denisof also from the ""Angel"" series plays a Senator intent on bringing the Dollhouse down and his wife played by Stacey Scowley stands by him guiding him along the way. My favorite new character is Bennett Halverson played by Summer Glau, most remembered for Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Joss Whedon hits ""Firefly"" and follow-up movie, ""Serenity."" Bennett Halverson is a foil to nerd Topher as the head nerd at the Washington, D.C. location with a dark streak as she has a personal grudge against Echo's original personality, Caroline. Alan Tudyk makes another appearance as Alpha, the only other doll to have become self-aware in the same way as Echo who made is his mission to collect as many personalities as possible which resulted in him becoming a bit psychotic and he is obsessed with Echo.This show had a plan for 6 years, chopped it down to half a year, then added another half a season resulting in an accelerated plot that allowed for many great moments. The plot is WAY better after Echo becomes a person because the blank slate doll gets old very fast which is why I quit the first season three episodes in when it came out. Once she gets a little bad ass and starts utilizing her incorporated training, martial arts skills, and other tech knowledge, it is a lot more fun to cheer for her and hope she can free her friends. Olivia Williams is an absolute delight as the cold British woman only out for herself and severe to everyone else and Fran Kranz's Topher becomes much more funny in this season and less like a cruel child burning ants with a magnifying glass as he crushes on tech rival, Bennett. Their short lived romance is very sweet, while the attempt at a romantic relationship between Echo and her handler, Ballard is never fully realized or believable since it mostly occurs when she isn't quite a person yet always making it creepy and weird. If you're a Whedon fan, don't miss out on some great storytelling here! If not, then it's easy to see why it got canceled because it's nowhere near as fun as the first few seasons of ""Alias"" like I hoped it would be originally. Season 2 is WAY better than Season 1, maybe just start here and skim the summaries of the first season?Special Features:There is commentary on episode 1 of Season 2 titled ""Vows"" by Joss Whedon and he marvels at how they were miraculously picked up for a second season and how the format of the show was changed in light of Epitaph 1 at the end of the first season. Characters had a different journey to go on and he had to find ways to initiate them going there and speed up some of their progress due to the abbreviated season length and increasing budget cuts taking away the amount of episodes certain actors could be in. The set received a complete lighting makeover in all aspects, Echo's journey to self-actualization took larger steps, and the character of Paul Ballard essentially moved into the Dollhouse.There is also commentary on episode 4 called ""Belonging"" by Jed Whedon and new bride, Maurissa Tancharoen who were both writers on 17 of the total 27 episodes of the series and presumably of the one they commented on. They also talked about the journeys of characters, mostly about Sierra and Dichen Lachman's performance of her that had to range so much during the episode as she played doll, her original personality Pria, and other characters to the whim of a scary rapist guy.Defining Moments is a featurette talking about the short life span of the series, the highs and lows of the process and its creation, and the challenges that posed on storytelling. Looking Back: A Roundtable with Joss Whedon in the cast is literally a table they are all seated around while eating and drinking a meal together discussing the characters, their favorite moments or personas in the series, and how much they all enjoyed working together. There is a small comic book inside the case titled ""Dollhouse Epitaphs"" explaining more pre-cursors to the apocalyptic world seen in those futuristic episodes and some outtakes and deleted scenes on the last disc.",4,"With a little more time, it could have turned into something special.

Bottom-line is that this show accomplished more than any other shows will in five seasons and they did it with only 26 episodes.Season 2 is one of the finest, best written and planned out seasons seen on television in a long time. The main plot sees Echo (Eliza Dushku) with the ability to maintain her various imprints (personas) after the events of season one, and that further developed into her being able to access those imprints at will turning her into nothing short of a super hero with advanced skills as she plots to take down the dollhouse as well as it's evil founder - Rossam corporation.As the season progresses, we learn not only of how Echo/ Caroline come to be in the dollhouse but were presented with back stories of Victor and Sierra. Each was given an entire episode where they took the lead away from Echo as the writers tied up loose ends and allowed for further character developments.Characters like boss lady Adelle Dewitt as well as in-house genius programmer Topher Brink were given opportunities to develop as well in the midst of the massive main plot, as the earlier struggles between good and evil while the latter found love in another evil genius.One important thing to know for casual viewers is that season 2 does take into account, in fact to a large extend the events that happened in the unaired 13th episode of season 1 ""Epitaph One"".  It is evident that you watch that episode first before starting season 2, especially true for the series finale.Flash forward scenes of the future in ""Epitaph One"" comes to play here in season 2, it is extremely interesting and intriguing to watch how those events come to be. Along with a trip to the infamous ""attic"", return of Alpha, Dr. Saunders, Mr. Dominic and Mellie as well as more disturbing tech and revelation had me hooked all season long.I guess I'm thankful that we got a second season even though it makes the blow of losing the show so much more painful and harder. This show ended on a proper note (it is very important for me to say that as most cancelled shows don't), the ending was extremely satisfying, not only did they have a proper conclusion for the story arch in the present time line but they took the effort to conclude the events that happened in the future. My only regret is that the show didn't find its way to more audience as it is truly one of Joss Whedon's finest works.This show will go down as one of the most underrated shows in television history.I can't wait to own this season on DVD so I can watch it over again and again and again...",5,One of the Most Underrated Series of All Time,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2669,"['can', 'sit', 'here', 'sing', 'praises', 'show', 'end', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'Bottom-line', 'show', 'accomplished', 'more', 'other', 'shows', 'will', 'five', 'seasons', 'did', 'only', '26', 'episodes.Season', '2', 'one', 'finest', 'best', 'written', 'planned', 'out', 'seasons', 'seen', 'television', 'long', 'time', 'main', 'plot', 'sees', 'Echo', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'ability', 'maintain', 'various', 'imprints', 'personas', 'events', 'season', 'one', 'further', 'developed', 'being', 'able', 'access', 'imprints', 'will', 'turning', 'nothing', 'short', 'super', 'hero', 'advanced', 'skills', 'take', 'down', 'dollhouse', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'founder', 'Rossam', 'season', 'learn', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'Echo/', 'Caroline', 'come', 'be', 'dollhouse', 'were', 'presented', 'back', 'stories', 'Victor', 'Sierra', 'was', 'given', 'entire', 'episode', 'where', 'took', 'lead', 'away', 'Echo', 'writers', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'allowed', 'further', 'character', 'developments.Characters', 'boss', 'lady', 'Adelle', 'Dewitt', 'as', 'well', 'in-house', 'genius', 'programmer', 'Topher', 'Brink', 'were', 'given', 'opportunities', 'develop', 'as', 'well', 'midst', 'massive', 'main', 'plot', 'earlier', 'struggles', 'good', 'evil', 'latter', 'found', 'love', 'evil', 'genius.One', 'important', 'thing', 'know', 'casual', 'viewers', 'season', '2', 'take', 'account', 'fact', 'large', 'extend', 'events', 'happened', 'unaired', '13th', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'Epitaph', 'One', 'evident', 'watch', 'episode', 'first', 'starting', 'season', '2', 'especially', 'true', 'series', 'forward', 'scenes', 'future', 'Epitaph', 'One', 'play', 'here', 'season', '2', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'how', 'events', 'come', 'be', 'trip', 'infamous', 'attic', 'return', 'Alpha', 'Dr.', 'Saunders', 'Mr.', 'Dominic', 'Mellie', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'disturbing', 'tech', 'revelation', 'had', 'hooked', 'season', 'long.I', 'guess', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'got', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'blow', 'losing', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'painful', 'harder', 'show', 'ended', 'proper', 'note', 'very', 'important', 'say', 'as', 'most', 'cancelled', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'ending', 'was', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'have', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'story', 'arch', 'present', 'time', 'line', 'took', 'effort', 'conclude', 'events', 'happened', 'future', 'only', 'regret', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'more', 'audience', 'truly', 'one', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'finest', 'works.This', 'show', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'shows', 'television', 'history.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'season', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'again']",N/A

While Season 1 did seem to get a little redundant, thanks I hear to the Fox Execs micromanaging the series, in Season 2, Whedon was given full reign and the story took off and grew from there. The conspiracy at the end (prior to the futuristic episodes) and plot twist were very well done.  Unfortunately, by the beginning of Season 2, many had already abandoned the show due to some of the redundancy of Season 1.  And Fox, being INFAMOUS for cancelling GREAT science fiction shows on Friday (ex. Firefly, Sarah Connor Chronicles, etc.) of course did what they do... move a show geared towards 20 & 30 Somethings to Friday primetime (when MOST 20 & 30 somethings are away from home) and then cancel the show. With the invention & popularity of the Tivo, LIVE viewership numbers are outdated and an unrealistic tally of actual viewers.  Anyway, it was sad to see the show get hacked up at the end.  It seemed like the last few episodes, after the cancellation announcement were incoherent & edited out of sequence or they just tried to cram too much in to finish up the concept or something along those lines.

1272523,AHOBBFAUQU9IA,B002JVWR4U,Kt,"[0, 0]","The characters in this show were portrayed well and were enjoyable to watch.  I liked the different personas.  And the actors who played the dolls did a great job of taking on their roles when they changed.  They really made me believe that another person was in that body. Very believable acting.However, the plot lines were not so believable.  I'm not talking about the sci-fi tech aspect.  I mean a lot of what the characters did just did not make sense and seemed instead to be excuses to bring up interesting scenarios.  But it left me feeling like the show was getting a little silly.-Spoilers below-For example, why did Paul Ballard take such great pains by lying to assist Echo in saving that girl who was in prison, before bringing Echo back?  And why did Echo do it in the first place?  It didn't make sense.  I mean yeah it was great to do that good deed, but I didn't see the point in it concerning the overall plot, or how Echo persuaded Paul to go along with it.And why did Paul join Rossum?  And why did Rossum trust him?  That transition seemed weird and whatever excuses they give did not really give enough reason for this to happen.  He didn't really do anything about stopping the corporation after he was so set on it in the beginning.  And he actually became Echo's handler?  It was just weird.  It felt like they were just trying to give Paul more screen time and try to do interesting things with him around.And why did they send a doll to seduce Paul in the first place?  They could have just gotten rid of him with their thugs the first chance they saw something was going on.  Or go through the government or something.  And why did he decide to infiltrate the Dollhouse single-handedly?  Where was his video camera?  Why did he not just alert someone to the location of the dollhouse that he could trust?  Contact the news?  Didn't he know he was bound to get apprehended and have bad things happen to him once he was caught in a sea of the people who worked there?And on that note, once Paul Ballard joined the Dollhouse, his character became really weak.  He was very motivated and driven in the beginning.  But after joining the Dollhouse, his character no longer made sense.  He just kind of hung around and watched Echo, not really doing anything.  I found their romance not very believable and did not really see what Echo saw in him.Also, why did Topher send Sierra back with that guy with just imprinting her own memories?  What did he expect to accomplish with that?  She was still a lone female with a larger man and it basically could have just ended with the client angry and the girl angry and possibly in danger.  The reasoning behind that just did not make any sense.And Echo kept on talking about this storm coming and getting all the dolls out of there.  Yet she just kept going back on more engagements, not really doing anything about it.  It seemed like she just went back because she was bored and wanted to hang out.  Because that's all she did.  It just didn't make sense what her purpose of going back really was.Also I thought the whole little thing where Alpha cut up the doctor's face because he wanted Echo to be ""number one""  was a little childish.  They mentioned it a few times about being ""number one"" and I thought it was sort of non-sensical.  I mean was it really a good thing to be the doll that is used the most in people's fantasies and be taken advantage of?  I suppose he was a psychopath and that was the excuse, but still.Basically, I wish the writers had come up with more believable plot lines.  However, a lot of it was good.  I did enjoy the cast.  I thought that they all were wonderful for their roles.  Also it was neat seeing Summer Glau and Felicia Day.I was also amused by Topher's fantasy imprint on Sierra for his birthday.  (Even though it was a bit disturbing to see him using a doll this way.)  But there was definitely a geek somewhere behind the writing and I was amused whenever geeky references came up.Overall the premise was interesting, and it was definitely interesting to see what they did with this world where that kind of technology existed.  It does make you wonder if this did exist, would your own stream of consciousness disappear if you went through the procedure?  Though they didn't explicitly mention this in the show.  I really don't think any sort of ""reprogramming"" of someone's brain would ever be possible.  But it was still neat to watch.  I also enjoyed the tasteful and sparse interior decor of the Dollhouse.Anyway, overall, I did think this show was entertaining but it wasn't amazingly great.  I didn't see a clear message that was coherent or meaningful.",3,Good but not great,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,4671,"['characters', 'show', 'were', 'portrayed', 'well', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'watch',

Is it morally right to have such technology? Is it human nature to abuse this technology? If the dolls are all ostensibly volunteers, is there such a thing as voluntary servitude or are the engagements prostitution of a most profoundly perverted nature? In a world of mindless reality shows, it's easy to see why ""Dollhouse"" never garnered a large viewing audience.The first season of ""Dollhouse"" led the viewer on a fascinating journey as Echo (Eliza Dushku), one of the most popular Actives, began to wake up within her doll state, developing a personality immune to the mental tampering of the Dollhouse, creating herself as a person. After the climactic season finale, ""Omega,"" FOX surprisingly renewed ""Dollhouse"" for a second season. It was in this second and ultimately final season that ""Dollhouse"" truly became one of creator Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel,"" ""Firefly/Serenity"")'s finest works.Plunging back into Echo's world, we learn that Echo is no longer quiet and quiescent. She knows who she is. She is a person. And she is determined to free herself and all of her fellow dolls from this shining, dangerous prison they have found themselves in. Joining her is Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Penikett), her handler in the Dollhouse and also her greatest ally. ""We are lost,"" Echo states strongly. ""But we are *not* gone."" With that, ""Dollhouse"" takes off into one of the most mind-bending, shocking, and ultimately satisfying science-fiction sagas of this decade.Taking its cues from ""Alias,"" the second season of ""Dollhouse"" finds Echo and Paul pitting themselves against the insidious Rossum Corporation (the founder of the Dollhouse, taking its name from the creepy Eastern play ""Rossum's Universal Robots""). This battle leads to some of the most shocking twists and reveals of the year, unveiling an insidious evil within the Dollhouse itself that shook the show to its foundations.Not merely satisfied with the greater scheme, ""Dollhouse"" devoted itself to character development as well. In the fourth episode, ""Belonging,"" lauded by critics and viewers alike as one of the most poignant television episodes of 2009, we learn Sierra's (Dichen Lachman) tragic and horrifying backstory, taking ""Dollhouse"" through one of its darkest episodes to find an unexpected and subtle beauty. The relationship between dolls Sierra and Victor (Enver Gjokaj) took on a deeply human quality as they remembered each other even beyond the wipes. Topher (Fran Kranz) had perhaps the most tragic story arc as he ultimately faced his hubris and assumed responsibility for the corruption of his technology.Eliza Dushku produced an amazingly strong acting streak once Echo became her own person, switching between that which was Echo and that which was not with eerie ease. Indeed, Echo posed an interesting dilemma: if Caroline (Echo's original self) was not the heroine we had once envisioned, was it murder to erase Echo to make room for Caroline? Tahmoh Penikett again played a strong role as the remarkably tragic Paul Ballard, a man brought into the Dollhouse through illusion only to find that his own ""real world"" crumbled even easier than fantasy.But Whedon again showed a remarkable ability to pick co-stars who at times outshine the leads. Olivia Williams played Adelle DeWitt, the iron-backed head of the LA Dollhouse, whose fearsome carnival ride of emotions as she was forced to see what she had allowed herself to become was amazing in its complexity, allowing Williams to showcase a fine-honed thespian spirit (and allowing her a delicious head-to-head confrontation with guest star Ray Wise as leader of a different Dollhouse). Fran Kranz brought Topher an amazing sensitivity that allowed us to care about his character as he was brought lower than any thought possible, while Amy Acker again turned a masterful role as the troubled and ultimately tragic doll Whiskey. Miracle Laurie, who portrayed the doll Madeline Costley, stole every scene she was in with her emotive eyes as she played out a Greek tragedy upon the screen, and Harry Lennix again proved that he was perhaps the most powerful actor in the stable as Boyd Langton. The discovery of Enver Gjokaj was a true miracle of ""Dollhouse"" as he switched between imprints with eerie ease, twice mimicking Fran Kranz's Topher with an accuracy so profound it was creepy.In the end, ""Dollhouse"" raced toward a series finale that was terrifying in its complexity, with powerhouse episodes like ""The Left Hand,"" a government conspiracy thriller, ""Meet Jane Doe,"" which saw Echo cast out into the real world, ""A Love Supreme,"" featuring the return of Alpha (Alan Tudyk) as the dolls turned on their masters, and ""The Attic,"" where the horrors of the heart of the Dollhouse were brought to light. Ending ""Getting Closer"" with a hell of a plot twist that left viewers breathless, ""The Hollow Men"" (a wonderful allusion to the poem by TS Eliot stating ""the world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper"") brought the second season to a powerhouse conclusion with an episode so emotionally charged it hardly needed the heightened action sequences.It is here, though, that Whedon left his greatest gift to viewers. In season one, when cancellation seemed certain, Whedon created an episode titled ""Epitaph One,"" introducing viewers to new characters as the world was plunged ten years into the future where the Dollhouse technology had gone out of control, leaving the world in a horrifying apocalypse. It is here where season two ends, with ""Epitaph Two: Return."" ""Return"" was a masterful series finale, bringing the series to a close and providing a beautiful (albeit unexpected) ending to each and every character. It's a wonderful send off, as each season's first twelve episodes serve as a complete story arc, allowing future viewers on DVD to watch each set of twelve episodes and then the two ""Epitaph"" episodes as a sort of TV movie that brought the story to a masterful conclusion.Featuring a cast of truly talented actors, ""Dollhouse"" reached new heights this season and provided some remarkable fan-favorite guest stars, featuring guest appearances from Jamie Bamber and Michael Hogan (each of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame), Whedon-favorite Summer Glau (of ""Firefly"" and ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles""), Patton Oswalt, Ray Wise, Alexis Denisof, Felicia Day, and returning roles from the ever-talented Reed Diamond, Miracle Laurie, Amy Acker, Alan Tudyk, and also three memorable cameos from one of the writers, Maurissa Tancharoen, as well as cameos from Dushku's real-world boyfriend Rick Fox, Olivia Williams' husband, and Dushku's older brother Nate.What is ""Dollhouse?"" It was a remarkable show that plumbed the depths of human nature and didn't flinch from the darkness it found there, a wonderful addition to the world of science-fiction, and a showcase of the power of human will over the ominous sword of technology, truly earning its place as one of Joss Whedon's greater works.Of course, all fans ask now is that they release a soundtrack, as the show followed Whedon's usual footprints and featured some truly amazing music.""Dollhouse"" : Season One - Four out of five stars.""Dollhouse"" : Season Two - Five out of five stars.Also recommended: Angel,

1272554,A2M6SAHM4XJTAC,B002JVWR4U,S. E. Bradfield,"[1, 1]","I only gave season 1 of Dollhouse four stars. This second season gets five. It was a brilliant original concept from Joss Whedon, left hanging due to the need of more than one season to tell the story. Like Firefly before it, it could have been so much more had it been allowed to play out at its own pace. In this case he was given another season to finish the story, and finish it he did, and in high style.What was complex before now becomes downright unexpected. Who is who and why and how they got that way is a real rollercoaster ride. No one is quite what you thought, and none of them stays that way. People you liked are suddenly a little less likeable, and people you hated suddenly do something good. The best part is that all their motives, when revealed, are believable. Real people turn out to be dolls and dolls turn into real people. The ethical questions from the first season become deep moral dilemmas. The first season covered the question of whether it was ethical to remove a person's personality, even if only for a time, and replace it with another person needed to do a particular job. Now there's a new problem: If a doll can develop a new personlity of its own is it morally justifiable to &#34;kill&#34; that personality by replacing it with the original.Most intriguing is the central character of Echo, wonderfully played by Eliza Dushku, who sits at the center of all this. She is much better than some people give her credit for. She's not alone, though. The rest of the ensemble cast shines just as brightly.

I bought the entire series on Itunes and my friends can tell you I have watched each episode around 10X and I still plan to buy the actual season two dvd for all the features like commentary and deleted scenes.Honestly if you didn't watch the series on tv pick it up now, It's so worth the buy.It has a great cast that is very talented, it has quirky joss humor and Eliza actually shines especially in the episodes her character isn't on an engagement.Olivia Williams character shows an even more devious evil side and even deals with alcoholism and finds a way to come above it and become the leader in the fight against rossum.Fran aka Topher plays the quirky science guy and this season he finds love has his heartbroken and he goes insane, can you ask for anything else to see in one season of a show I THINK NOT XDEnver as victor really just blows you away when he plays topher a fellow cast member and does an amazing job even mimicking his voice and mannerism and plays the best serial killer psycho.Dichen character Sierra gets her back story revealed and how an obsessive Doctor seen in season one makes her his personal doll and she gets her revenge and gets her personal power backAlpha is awesome this season, he redeems himself after the omega episode and becomes funny yet devious and even reforms.Eliza: Her acting in the second season is just amazing, she really shows her chops this season now that her character is self aware and becomes a real person outside of caroline. You even learn about caroline and she is a very likable character many were not sure from the first season because their was only minor tid bits.The story moves fairly fast but it's a good pace and you get to see that amazing apocalyptic future from epitaph one and THE ATTIC IS REVEALED and it is as weird and creepy as I had hoped.There is an entire episode that resides in the ominous attic and seems almost like a dark alice in wonderland.Joss Whedon once again creates and amazing show that just is not advertised correctly.

Season two features all the strengths of season one, and adds on a number of revalations.

1272564,AW594B7HH4YUY,B002JVWR4U,The Deacon,"[1, 2]","Season 2 of Dollhouse continues to show the amazing storytelling abilities of Joss Whedon and his team of writers.  It also deepens its moral exploration of issues involving identity and the imprinting technology.  Diverse plotlines and an increasing plethora of doll personalities allow the show's strong cast to further display their amazing skills and versatility as actors.Eliza Dushku's lead role as the doll ""Echo"" continues to evolve, and the main plotline revolves around this.  However, there are a number of other standout performances, especially that given by Dichen Lachman as ""Sierra"" in episode #4, ""Belonging"".  The latter episode explains how Sierra became one of the dolls, and it offers us one of the show's deepest explorations of just how dark imprinting technology can be.  Dichen's performance is stunning and really showcases her strengths as an actress in what is usually a supporting role.If Season 1 was the ""origin"" story for the show, then Season 2 marks a transition toward more constant dramatic exposition driven by the longer-term plotline.  We continue to learn more about the purposes of the Dollhouse and the Rossum Corporation, and the moral compass of the characters managing the dolls sees greater definition as some of their own motivations for being there are tested.It's unfortunate that Dollhouse did not find a large enough audience to continue into a third season, but Whedon's masterful skills as a storyteller really make the show compelling to watch.  I can understand why some viewers may have been turned off as the show involves some intellectually and morally challenging material, but that is exactly what makes it worth watching in my opinion.  This is art not for art's sake but rather something that gets under our skin as viewers to provoke some reaction, whatever that may be.It's a rare show that can intertwine drama, technology, philosophy, and morality in such an accessible and visceral way.  The power to create and strip away human personality and memories may be a weird, hard-to-fathom rocket science, but the moral implications of that power is something that anyone should be able to relate to and have an opinion or feeling about.  The show's genius is in allowing us to explore that in depth and learn something new, maybe even something that makes us uncomfortable.Dollhouse is great art that is also great fun to watch.

1272569,A2KUMYWXAQNARZ,B002JVWR4U,toronto,"[12, 19]","Like all Joss Whedon work, Dollhouse is well written and beautifully orchestrated, but there was something about this series that didn't ever really connect with me.  Perhaps it was because Eliza Dushku -- who was unbelievably good as Faith in Buffy and Angel -- is (in spite of Josslove) not really cut out to play the whole variety of characters she was supposed to play.  She has an opacity about her and an offhand style that never really goes away.  She is always Eliza Dushku, and never really transforms. I suspect however there's something about the whole concept for the show that interferes with the audience identifying with the main characters.  I never really care about Caroline/Echo's past or future.  In the end,  her original story is kind of half-baked anyway.  But funnily enough,  it is the innocents, Sierra and Victor, who steal the show, as well as Topher the geek.  As usual in the Whedonverse there are good things here and there: Miracle the big woman (nice to see one as a romantic figure);  Olivia Williams (Cruella de Ville), and the welcome return of Summer Glau and Alexis Denisof; not to mention the change in Alan Tudyk!  Still, somewhere towards the end of season one, one loses one's sense of the whole thing, as the characters and their going back and forth multiply.  There's also a flatness in the filming early on that reminds one of 70s TV (the genre problem).  Compared to Buffy and Angel and Firefly,  there is just a lack of overall emotional connection.  The second season is more action filled, but by then we have seen a lot over and over again:  variations on the chair,  endless halls in empty buildings filled with sudden fighting, etc.  Another problem is that we have seen a whole lot of this story before in other places: Terminator apocalypses and the rest.  This is just such a familiar groove.  The MadMax truck at the very end struck me as something that could be the start of a great idea -- pity it arrives so late.  It may be that the goofy segments in the series are just too short -- Whedon is at his best riffing away.  He works best with a dysfunctional group with a single purpose (e.g. the writers' room as archetype). Dollhouse is designed so no one can be in a group, everyone is so impaired or conspiring.  They cannot gather around Echo or anyone else, which is where Whedonics works its best magic.  There is more energy in Season 2, but there is still this lack of groupness -- bits of it start happening, and then die because of the overall concept. You can see fragments of groupness (meetings in Adele's office,  meetings around Topher,  Victor and his soldier exploit with Sierra and Echo, and so on,  bits, but, to repeat, the Actives have such a struggle to come together because of their constant return to distancing that only partly ebbs). So, for me, there isn't enough group playtime throughout.  Joss W. needs to go back to group playtime.  One hopes that the Avengers will be this kind of playtime.The reason I give it 3 stars and not less is the last episode of all. This seems to me to redeem a whole lot. Considering that they had to work with an already out there Epitaph One, the thing is a marvel.  Maybe Epitaph One and Two should have been the series.  For Whedon fans they have all kinds of familiar tropes from all of his series (I particularly like the fact that he finally got to shoot the post apocalyptic LA from Angel), but they nevertheless work so effortlessly.  Everything about the editing and cast connecting and reconnecting just flows.  The scene around the kitchen table (the essential Joss Whedon archetype, the group around the table is his touchstone utopia) is a kind of summary statement of every group around a table in Whedonverse, and is more or less what we have been waiting for (sure it is Southern California/American apocalypse ecotopia, but we still go for it).  The foibles and bonding and exposition and sarcasm -- we've seen this a hundred times in Whedonverse, but it is always a beautiful thing.  I watched the whole series in a row on DVD, which was both fun and a chore, but it was worth the work, towards earning the last episode.",3,Could have been dolled up a little....,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,4159,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'work', 'Dollhouse', 'well', 'written', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'was', 'something', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'connect', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'because', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'Faith', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'spite', 'Josslove', 'not', 'really', 'cut', 'out', 'play', 'whole', 'variety', 'characters', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'opacity', 'offhand', 'style', 'never', 'really', 'away', 'always', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'never', 'really', 'transforms', 'suspect', 'however', 'something', 'whole', 'concept', 'show', 'audience', 'identifying', 'main', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'Caroline/Echo', 'past', 'future', 'end', 'original', 'story', 'kind', 'half-baked', 'anyway', 'funnily', 'enough', 'innocents', 'Sierra', 'Victor', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Topher', 'geek', 'usual', 'Whedonverse', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'Miracle', 'big', 'woman', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'romantic', 'figure', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Cruella', 'de', 'Ville', 'welcome', 'return', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'not', 'mention', 'change', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Still', 'somewhere', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'sense', 'whole', 'thing', 'characters', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'multiply', 'also', 'flatness', 'filming', 'early', 'one', '70s', 'TV', 'genre', 'problem', 'Compared', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'just', 'lack', 'overall', 'emotional', 'connection', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'action', 'filled', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'over', 'again', 'variations', 'chair', 'endless', 'halls', 'empty', 'buildings', 'filled', 'sudden', 'fighting', 'etc', 'problem', 'have', 'seen', 'whole', 'lot', 'story', 'other', 'places', 'Terminator', 'apocalypses', 'rest', 'just', 'such', 'familiar', 'groove', 'MadMax', 'truck', 'very', 'end', 'struck', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'start', 'great', 'idea', 'pity', 'so', 'late', 'may', 'be', 'goofy', 'segments', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'short', 'Whedon', 'best', 'riffing', 'away', 'best', 'dysfunctional', 'group', 'single', 'purpose', 'e.g', 'writers', 'room', 'archetype', 'Dollhouse', 'designed', 'so', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'group', 'everyone', 'so', 'impaired', 'conspiring', 'can', 'not', 'gather', 'around', 'Echo', 'anyone', 'else', 'where', 'Whedonics', 'best', 'magic', 'more', 'energy', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'lack', 'groupness', 'bits', 'happening', 'then', 'die', 'overall', 'concept', 'can', 'see', 'fragments', 'groupness', 'meetings', 'Adele', 'office', 'meetings', 'Topher', 'Victor', 'soldier', 'exploit', 'Sierra', 'Echo', 'so', 'bits', 'repeat', 'Actives', 'have', 'struggle', 'come', 'together', 'constant', 'return', 'distancing', 'only', 'partly', 'So', ""n't"", 'enough', 'group', 'playtime', 'Joss', 'W.', 'go', 'back', 'group', 'playtime', 'One', 'Avengers', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'playtime.The', 'reason', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'less', 'last', 'episode', 'redeem', 'whole', 'lot', 'Considering', 'had', 'work', 'already', 'there', 'Epitaph', 'One', 'thing', 'marvel', 'Maybe', 'Epitaph', 'One', 'Two', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'Whedon', 'fans', 'have', 'kinds', 'familiar', 'tropes', 'series', 'particularly', 'fact', 'finally', 'got', 'shoot', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'LA', 'Angel', 'nevertheless', 'work', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'Everything', 'editing', 'cast', 'connecting', 'reconnecting', 'just', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'table', 'essential', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'archetype', 'group', 'table', 'touchstone', 'utopia', 'kind', 'summary', 'statement', 'group', 'table', 'Whedonverse', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'sure', 'Southern', 'California/American', 'apocalypse', 'ecotopia', 'still', 'go', 'foibles', 'bonding', 'exposition', 'sarcasm', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'Whedonverse', 'always', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'row', 'DVD', 'was', 'fun', 'chore', 'was', 'worth', 'work', 'towards', 'earning', 'last', 'episode']",N/A

1272572,A3QIVW3MEH1SKA,B002JVWR4U,Vlitch Godunov,"[2, 2]","What is this Dollhouse, why does it exist, and where is it located ... and how can we destroy it? These seem to be the still-revolving questions asked of a building that contains an underground organization that wipes away someone's personality, leaving them in a mindless, childlike state - much like a doll.And, much like said doll, if you never saw the first season, or did, and rather like myself had forgotten many aspects of it, then settling into this first episode of season two (the final season) is much like being one of those wiped dolls - remembering nothing that's transpired!Because in the season opener, 'VOWS,' we get straight into the action without one single flashback or update reel! Echo, on one of her 'engagements' is marrying an arms dealer. It's six months after Alpha's reign of terror and with him still on the loose, Echo now begins randomly picking up flashes of past engagements - flashes that tend to get in her day-today 'fake' lives! Solid intro to the season, that features a great battle of an ending, and which also finds our hero starting to mind-fritz back to portions of her once self ie: Caroline.In 'INSTINCT,' the story that Echo is living this time is very confusing. No real plot, save for the fact she now seems to be a mother to a beautifully cute baby boy, and a husband that wants nothing to do with either of them! Oh, and further complications arise when, thanks to Topher's programming, Echo takes too strongly to motherhood due to her maternal instincts ie: lactating boobs! This has to be the most mundane of the episodes in the season, sorry.In 'BELLE CHOSE,' one portion of this story is about a weird, brain-disfunctional serial killer being put into a coma by a car accident (and the subsequent search to find some people who may have been abducted by him), whilst the Echo portion revolves around becoming a teacher's pet to a school teacher (Arye Gross as Professor Gossen)! The ending is a little weird, but fun.In 'BELONGING,' the episode evolves around Sierra and how she came to the Dollhouse. It also features the arrival of new (semi) cast member, David Carradine ('Dexter') as the bigger boss to Adelle.In 'THE PUBLIC EYE,' trouble is brewing within the Dollhouse. Echo is sent to Washington, DC to stop Senator Daniel Perrin before he can expose the Dollhouse's secrets. A twist comes a little later in the episode, but what a twist! Also, the beautiful Summer Glau ('Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles') makes her first appearance as genius programmer, Bennett Halverson, a woman with a mysterious past connection to Echo.In 'THE LEFT HAND,' a reference to Bennett Halverson's 'dead' left arm, things come to light about the 'special' relationship between Echo and Bennett, in which a flashback reveals the real truth of how things came to be. Meanwhile, Topher sees double when he involves Victor in his espionage plans to hack into the DC Dollhouse computer to locate both Echo and Senator Perrin as they try to run from Perrin's wife Cindy, who is more connected than thought to the DC Dollhouse.In 'MEET JANE DOE,' after her entanglements with Senator Perrin and the DC Dollhouse, Echo finds herself out in the world-at-large as she struggles to control her multiple memory downloads, as well as those of her original memory of Caroline. Unsure who she is, Echo/Caroline calls upon the only person she can remember; Ballard, when she lands in a jam in a small town in Texas involving an illegal Mexican immigrant woman whom gets jailed - because of something she did to try and help her.In 'A LOVE SUPREME,' a few old favs from Dollhouse episodes gone by come out to play, but not for long for most of them! And that's due to the return of Alpha (the brilliant Alan Tyduk), who emerges from hiding and sets about 'removing' all of Echo's past romantic engagements! Not least a great (sorry) explosive scene atop a building! Another outing here for Patton Oswalt, who takes it with both hands, is fun to watch. At the same time though, Echo is locked in a cell, her brain on meltdown, Adelle trying to figure out what's going on inside her head. This is truly the first action episode of the second season!In 'STOP-LOSS,' Victor's five-year contract with the Dollhouse elapses and he goes back out into the real world under his old personality of Anthony Ceccoli. But his past as a soldier fighting in Afghanistan suddenly creeps up on him (literally) and he is 'programmed' by another sector of men to, once more, become a fighting machine. Echo is then forced to recruit Sierra, under her real personalty of Priya, to help rescue Victor/Anthony.In 'THE ATTIC,' (a great, revealing episode that I think we can all agree we've been waiting to delve into for over a year now!), when Adelle fears that Echo's multiple mind imprints are making her a danger to her goals for Rossum, she has her sent to The Attic! A place where such people as Echo are kept in limbo, forced to face their worst nightmares over and over. A weird episode this one, for sure, and not too left of center to hear that it was directed by American comic book artist and writer, John Cassaday! With her former Dollhouse rep Laurence Dominic in there to aid her escape the Matrix, they also run into the dark figure trying to kill everyone, named Arcane.In 'GETTING CLOSER,' and with an in-house team of people all culled together to take down Rossum, the conspiracy now fully revealed, Boyd's away day secret is revealed! Topher meets up with Bennett when she is forcibly taken from the DC Dollhouse and brought to Los Angeles to help restore Caroline's past memory from a broken imprint. A great line here is uttered by Adelle to Topher as she walks by his office: ""That troublesome, once-armed creature. Where is she?"" Classic, especially with that posh British accent involved! Ballard struggles with the facts of his new existence as an Active, while he also brings in former active November/Millie back into the fold. The background story between Caroline and Bennett is revealed from three years earlier, and before the episode is over, two major twists are brought upon us ... including the death of a (semi) main character!In 'THE HOLLOW MEN,' and with the secret of who the 'in their midst' actual co-creator of Rossum really is, Echo and the survivors of the Dollhouse head out to Arizona to locate and shut-down the Rossum Corporation's mainframe computer system - which is scheduled to go into active status for remote mind-wipes in global proportions. This episode, as the season/series winds down, feature the death of another (semi) main character. And, come the end, when the bombs go off inside the building, and everyone pats each other on the back for saving the world, a) externally there is nothing wrong with the just-blown building ie: HORRIBLE CGI, and b) with one final episode to go, me thinks they celebrated too soon!In the final episode, 'EPITAPH 2: THE RETURN,' well, I have to say that the first 10 minutes are very confusing! First set in LA in 2019, we quickly jump to somewhere else in 2020. ""Half the world is wiped, the other half are crazies,"" is uttered, giving us knowledge that Rossum's plan to wipe the entire world is (still) more than in motion.With events finally having come full-circle as Echo and the few surviving Dollhouse staff struggle to restore mankind after the devastating events seen in the first season episode, 'Epitaph,' fellow actuals (those not affected by the wipes thus far), Mag, Zone, and the mind-restored Caroline (within a young child) set out to find the safe haven that can save man-kind from total extinction.And, captured and working within the Rossum building, told to create a worldwide mind sweep device, or witness the death of a human being every day in front of him, Topher actually sets out to create a reverse mind sweep device - one that only he can detinate in Adelle's old high rise office, come the end of the episode. But, before that we get the deaths of two major characters - one seen, and sad, the other known-to-have-happened and (somewhat) joyous!As for the actual ending, well, you'll have to watch that to find out - for, I ain't gonna spoil it for you! The special features are good, especially the Joss Whedon audio commentary on 'VOWS' where he talks more about the smaller budget this time around, the two cancelation notices he received for both seasons, the lighting within the Dollhouse, and the new cameras brought in for the HD shooting, etc. There are 7 deleted scenes, but they add noting to any story not already told or hinted at through the series, and the outtakes show the fun they had on set.The 'Defining Moments' featurette is 10 minutes long and is basically a behind-the-scenes expose on what everyone went through for the art of making this show. ""I am enormously proud of this weird thing that we created,"" creator Joss Whedon admits at its close. And, the resturant dinner with all the main cast in 'Looking Back' is a little static, very stoic, in places, but serves up some tasty fun treats along the way. And so, enjoy, one and all.Each Blu-ray and DVD comes with a 28 page exclusive limited  edition Dollhouse comic book by Dark Horse Comics. Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen,  joined by longtime Buffy the Vampire Slayer artist Cliff Richards, take  us on an intricate trip through the precise moment when the Active technology  went global, and how the protagonists from Epitaph One and Two narrowly  avoided death, and worse.",4,Toys In The Attic ...

Season 1 got me hooked and season 2 was even better. Echo continued to impress and seemed to get better with each episode.  There were some major surprises in this season.

I think that I need to go back to Season 1 and re-watch Episode 13, Epitaph 1. I remember being confused when I saw it, and again when I saw Season 2 Episode 13, Epitaph 2, trying to reconcile what I saw in the first with what I saw in the second.That said, it was a an interesting season for this two-season series, and showed a rapid development of the technology that brought on the apocalypse. I like that it left mankind with hope at the end, rather than a bleak question mark.",5,Dollhouse Season 2 Was Better!,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,579,"['Things', 'really', 'started', 'take', 'off', 'season', '2', 'Dollhouse', 'built', 'startling', 'finish', 'think', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'Season', '1', 're-watch', 'Episode', '13', 'Epitaph', '1', 'remember', 'being', 'confused', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'when', 'saw', 'Season', '2', 'Episode', '13', 'Epitaph', '2', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'what', 'saw', 'first', 'what', 'saw', 'second.That', 'said', 'was', 'interesting', 'season', 'two-season', 'series', 'showed', 'rapid', 'development', 'technology', 'brought', 'apocalypse', 'left', 'mankind', 'hope', 'end', 'rather', 'bleak', 'question', 'mark']",N/A
