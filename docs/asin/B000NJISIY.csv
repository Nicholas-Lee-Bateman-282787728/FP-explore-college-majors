1057128,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000NJISIY,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 0]","It was during this season of the show that the close knit dynamic of the show began to slowly break apart and split off into different directions. For one the show loses one of it's original cast members as Dennise (Lisa Bonet) leaves the household for collage. She's included in the show's theme song but appears only in a handfull of episodes. Either way however this season is filled with some excellent episodes that are very funny. One of is ""Bald And Beautiful"",in which Cockroach ends up shaving his head when he and Theo believe they are to appear in a video by a rock band called The Manniquins. Another great Theo and Cockroach episode is ""Theo's Flight"" where the pair,inspired by a heroic story of the Tuskeegee Airmen become infatuated with flying and actually are commited to it until the learn about the financial logistics of the matter and decide (wisely) to concentrate on growing up. This also features the first appearance of Kenny (known to Rudy as ""bud"") and the beginning of their teasingly funny relationship. ""Golden Anniversary"" kind of replicates the the family dance routine only it's James Brown's ""I Got The Feelin"" now and Theo gets a chance to showcase some fancy footwork and is more the star of this show than Rudy was in the last;she basically replicates her miming ""Baby baby baby"" here. It's hard to watch this season without being aware of Phylicia Rashad's pregancy. Her frequent and convenient absenses from many of the episodes didn't make the same impression on me as all the methods used to hide her widening stomach in the episodes she was in-including the infamous ""giant teddy bear"" scene. ""Vanessa's Rich"" actually brings up a very important point in an entertaining way. Even my own family I've heard this show as promoting an affluent black family lifestyle (then known as ""buppies"") throughout it's run and that's exactly the situation the growing Vanessa faces in this episodes. It is explained very well to her by Clair that the Huxtables work hard for what they have and that ""rich"" is actually better defined as the ""money working for you"". ""Say Hello To A Good Buy"" features the first appearance of Sinbad,later fromA Different Worldas a car salesman as Cliff educates Theo as to the finer points of bargaining. Also of note this season is ""Cliff's 50'th Birthday"" where his kids present him with a list of things older than him which,by the way includes dirt. ""The March"" is another classic episode dealing with the written-word-versus reality of the 1963 march on Washington and,sometimes it's best to receive the nuances of history from someone who experienced it as opposed to the printed word-a wonderful creative detour from Bill Cosby's usual abvocacy of ""traditional"" acedemia but still very in keeping with the families cultural experiences. ""The Shower"" address's through one of Dennise's friends the issue of teen pregnancy-as blackmail,in the case in order to get married. So this season leans more toward ""issue"" episodes which find the kids especially dealing with mildly more grown up issues but in an entertaining fasion. The final episode ""Hillman"",while something of a hint at Lisa Bonet's forthcoming spin off series set at the fictional school is one of the weaker episodes of the show-having more to do with the changing over of school presidents and a lot of footage without dialog than the Huxtable family itself. The most involving scene is Clair singing in the school choir but it still seems mildly like a filler episode. While this season doesn't quite have the warmth and ammusing quality throughout that the first two Cosby seasons did it's still a great part of the shows legacy.",4,Noticible Down-Turn From The First Two Seasons But Still Really Good,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,3664,"['was', 'season', 'show', 'close', 'knit', 'dynamic', 'show', 'began', 'slowly', 'break', 'apart', 'split', 'off', 'different', 'directions', 'one', 'show', 'one', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'Dennise', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'household', 'collage', 'included', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'only', 'handfull', 'episodes', 'way', 'however', 'season', 'filled', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'One', 'Bald', 'Beautiful', 'Cockroach', 'up', 'shaving', 'head', 'when', 'Theo', 'believe', 'are', 'appear', 'video', 'rock', 'band', 'called', 'Manniquins', 'great', 'Theo', 'Cockroach', 'episode', 'Theo', 'Flight', 'where', 'pair', 'inspired', 'heroic', 'story', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'become', 'infatuated', 'flying', 'actually', 'are', 'commited', 'learn', 'financial', 'logistics', 'matter', 'decide', 'wisely', 'concentrate', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'first', 'appearance', 'Kenny', 'known', 'Rudy', 'bud', 'beginning', 'teasingly', 'funny', 'relationship', 'Golden', 'Anniversary', 'kind', 'family', 'dance', 'routine', 'only', 'James', 'Brown', 'Got', 'Feelin', 'now', 'Theo', 'chance', 'showcase', 'fancy', 'footwork', 'more', 'star', 'show', 'Rudy', 'was', 'last', 'basically', 'miming', 'Baby', 'baby', 'baby', 'here', 'hard', 'watch', 'season', 'being', 'aware', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'pregancy', 'frequent', 'convenient', 'absenses', 'many', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'impression', 'methods', 'used', 'hide', 'widening', 'stomach', 'episodes', 'was', 'in-including', 'infamous', 'giant', 'teddy', 'bear', 'scene', 'Vanessa', 'Rich', 'actually', 'up', 'very', 'important', 'point', 'entertaining', 'way', 'Even', 'own', 'family', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'show', 'promoting', 'affluent', 'black', 'family', 'lifestyle', 'then', 'known', 'buppies', 'run', 'exactly', 'situation', 'growing', 'Vanessa', 'episodes', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'Clair', 'Huxtables', 'work', 'hard', 'what', 'have', 'rich', 'actually', 'better', 'defined', 'money', 'working', 'Say', 'Hello', 'A', 'Good', 'Buy', 'first', 'appearance', 'Sinbad', 'later', 'fromA', 'Different', 'Worldas', 'car', 'salesman', 'Cliff', 'Theo', 'finer', 'points', 'bargaining', 'Also', 'note', 'season', 'Cliff', ""50'th"", 'Birthday', 'where', 'kids', 'present', 'list', 'things', 'older', 'way', 'dirt', 'March', 'classic', 'episode', 'dealing', 'written-word-versus', 'reality', '1963', 'march', 'Washington', 'best', 'receive', 'nuances', 'history', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'opposed', 'printed', 'word-a', 'wonderful', 'creative', 'detour', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'usual', 'abvocacy', 'traditional', 'acedemia', 'still', 'very', 'keeping', 'families', 'cultural', 'experiences', 'Shower', 'address', 'one', 'Dennise', 'issue', 'teen', 'pregnancy-as', 'blackmail', 'case', 'order', 'get', 'married', 'So', 'season', 'more', 'issue', 'episodes', 'find', 'kids', 'especially', 'dealing', 'mildly', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'issues', 'entertaining', 'fasion', 'final', 'episode', 'Hillman', 'something', 'hint', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'forthcoming', 'spin', 'series', 'set', 'fictional', 'school', 'one', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'show-having', 'more', 'do', 'changing', 'school', 'presidents', 'lot', 'footage', 'dialog', 'Huxtable', 'family', 'most', 'involving', 'scene', 'Clair', 'singing', 'school', 'choir', 'still', 'mildly', 'filler', 'episode', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'warmth', 'ammusing', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'Cosby', 'seasons', 'did', 'still', 'great', 'part', 'shows', 'legacy']",The Cosby Show: Season 3
1057129,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000NJISIY,andy8047,"[11, 18]","The 1986-87 season,the third for the Cosby Show is exactly the same as the previous season,in the aspect of cast. The cast is still dancing but in different wardrobes and in a bluish-gray atmosphere to latin jazz music. It could have been Miami Sound Machine performing the new theme. Series star and co-creator Bill Cosby is acting a little bit sillier than before. Phylicia Rashad*(formerly Phylicia Ayers Allen) is rhythmically moving her feet wearing a black satin dress. Cosby and Rashad did do a little dance to latin jazz in the final scene of the season 1 episode RUDY'S SICK. Malcolm Jamal Warner rhythmically moves his feet. Sabrina LeBeauf and Tempest Bledsoe just stand still. Keshia Knight Pulliam moves her legs and feet and Cosby swings his right leg around her two-foot-tall body. We begin with BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE which premiered September 25,1986. Clair(Rashad) is terrified of a snake she finds in the Huxtables' kitchen. It hides out somewhere in their basement,seen for the first time. After the flabbergasting news of a high cholesterol-stricken friend,Cliff(Cosby) attempts to reduce his,via 35-calorie rice cakes. In GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY,Cliff's parents celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary and Clair plays a record with the late great James Brown's I GOT THE FEELIN' on it. Cliff's father Russell(Earle Hyman,recurringly) reflects about a similar experience with the late Ray Charles' NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME from a season 2 episode. Other highlights include Cliff celebrating his fiftieth birthday,Theo(MJW) and his buddy Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley(Carl Anthony Payne II,recurringly) about to shave their heads to appear in a rock video(Walter shaves but not Theo although he had shaving cream on his head),Vanessa(Bledsoe) wearing make-up against Clair's authority,Rudy(KKP) bossing around her friend Kenny(Deon Richmond,recurringly,who debuts in this episode),Cliff wearing make-up while napping(courtesy of 7-year-old Rudy), and the cast visiting Hillman college where Denise(Lisa Bonet) is studying in the season finale. The Hillman scenes were filmed in Atlanta where it's actually located. Guest stars this season include Patricia Richardson(""Home Improvement""),Robert Culp who was Cosby's I Spy co-star,Sinbad,Gilbert Gottfried and Angela Bassett,to name a few. Bonet was written out as a regular after this season,as she went on to star in the spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD. She would recur her character on TCS during seasons 4 and 5 and return as a regular for seasons 6 and 7. Sondra's(LeBeauf) boyfriend Elvin Tibidaux(Geoffrey Owens,recurringly) is seen again this season. The other episodes are great. *Phylicia Ayers Allen married football great Ahmad Rashad on December 14,1985.

1057130,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B000NJISIY,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[5, 5]","Season three's box set triumphantly says ""still the greatest"" but is this box set the greatest? The answer to that is...no. Urban Works really didn't put much effort into this set,  the Cosby Show deserves first rate treatment but it seems like Urban Works just thought, ""hey, I know let's not put the slightest bit of effort into these DVD's, I know the fans won't care either."" Well they were wrong, after a stellar season two release my expectations were high for the release of season three but it's obviously not enough effort was put into this set. There isn't one bonus feature, and there aren't any episode descriptions, only each episodes title. It gets a little frustrating having to guess what episode you're looking for by the title. And the last disappointment were the DVD cases, there all slim cases with each disc in one case, I enjoyed seeing photographs of the actors on the previous releases but...sigh...I guess it's not too big of a deal. But like season two, there aren't any edited episodes, so I can't really hate on this release.Season three had some great episodes if you ask me,  a really funny one that I can recall is ""Planning Parenthood"", Cliff decides to take Rudy, Kenny and some of her other friends to a fancy restaurant. Kenny is hysterical and this is one of my favorite episodes that includes Kenny.  Another one I absolutely love is ""I Know That You Know"", I won't get into the synopsis but I just had to say how great this episode was. Now earlier in my review I mentioned how there aren't any episode descriptions so I'll list them below.Bring `Em Back Alive - Airdate: 9/25/1986 - Rudy finds a snake in the basement.Food for Thought - Airdate: 10/2/1986 - Clair challenges Cliff to not eat any salty food for the day.Golden Anniversary - Airdate: 10/9/1986 - It's Russell and Anna's 50th wedding anniversary.Man Talk - Airdate: 10/16/1986 - Although he has a steady girlfriend, Theo wants to start dating someone else.Mother, May I? - Airdate: 10/23/1986 - After Clair specifically forbids her from wearing makeup, Vanessa does it anyway behind her mother's back.The March - Airdate: 10/30/1986 - Theo writes a report on the March on Washington, but gets a poor grade and is asked to redo his project.Theo's Flight - Airdate: 11/6/1986 - Theo and Cockroach decide they want to learn to fly, but Cliff doesn't want to waste his money on another dream of his son's.Vanessa's Rich - Airdate: 11/13/1986 - Some girls call Vanessa a stuck-up rich girl at school.Denise Gets a D - Airdate: 11/20/1986 - Denise's college career starts with a D, but Denise is to scared to show her parents.A Girl and Her Dog - Airdate: 12/4/1986 - Rudy and Peter find a dog and attempt to take care of it without her parents knowing.War Stories - Airdate: 12/11/1986 - Cliff and his father's friend play a challenging game of cards; meanwhile Vanessa prepares to go to a skating party with a date, but soon finds a very cute guy crossing her path.Cliff in Charge - Airdate: 12/18/1986 - Cliff is in charge when Clair leaves for a week.Monster Man Huxtable - Airdate: 1/8/1986 - Elvin helps Theo with some wrestling moves.Rudy Spends the Night - Airdate: 1/15/1987 - Cliff establishes the Huxtable Men's Club when the women are away to help Theo get over his sadness of a lost date.Say Hello to a Good Buy -Airdate: 1/22/1987 - Cliff needs to buy a new car.Denise Gets an Opinion - Airdate: 2/5/1987 - Denise has a blind date, but is really scared. So she asks Theo to grade him for her, but this soon leads to a big mix up.Calling Doctor Huxtable - Airdate: 2/12/1987 - Cliff is called to the hospital for three deliveries.You Only Hurt the One You

satisfied.",4,The Cosby Show Season Three,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,4656,"['Season', 'three', 'box', 'set', 'triumphantly', 'still', 'greatest', 'box', 'set', 'greatest', 'answer', 'Urban',

The reason I only give it four stars is the diminished presance of Phylicia Rahsad on camera.  [It's almost as if you see more of Denise, the Hillman freshman, than you do of Clair.]  Even knowing that she was on maternity restriction carrying then-husband Ahmad's fourth child doesn't really make up for the absence of Clair Huxtable during the middle part of the season.  Although, I've got to admit, the tricks they played to mask her pregnancy are pretty charming, in retrospect.Having gotten past that issue, this set still includes some of my favourite moments in the whole series (""Food for Thought,"" ""Cliff In Charge,"" ""Rudy Spends the Night,"" ""Calling Dr. Huxtable,"" ""The Shower,"" ""I know that You Know"" and ""Bald and Beautiful.""  Also of significant note is the season finale, ""Hillman,"" in which all seven Huxtables convine at Dr. & Mrs. Huxtable's alma mater (which never really existed) to honor its retiring president (Joe Seneca guesting).  There, we hear Clair soloing with the college choir (I believe that's really Phylicia's voice).  Partly on the heels of this episode, we see the creation of a spinoff show, A Diffeent World, which takes place right there at Hillman College.I actually found the menu-diving very comprehensive and had no trouble navigating the options.  And, the dual-act set-up is ideal, when there's a specific piece of an episode you want to see (such as the latter half of ""You Only Hurt the Ones You Love"").  Then again, I've only liked playing individual episodes.  (If you want to jump from one to the next, you can just hit fast-forward on your remote.)  I would've liked to see a bonus section, containing commentary or season bloopers, as with Season 2.  But, what can you do?

Other than that, I let the DVD run and didn't really laugh much.  One thing that annoyed me was the way the DVD was set up. You couldn't play all of them at once. You had to either fast forward through the credits quickly to get to the next one or keep selecting, and even using the down and enter keys, the menu was set up too scattered. I don't understand why the DVD was sectioned into Act 1 and Act 2 like someone would want to see one without the other. However, one thing that stood out to me was how obvious it was that Claire was pregnant during so many episodes.  As a child, you really don't pay attention to things like a stuffed bear in front of her or why most of her scenes are in bed. It was interesting to see how obvious some of the tricks were. I thought that was entertaining, and I know the writers and producers had to be creative trying to find things to block her stomach.",3,"Not The Most Interesting Season, But Cool",1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1118,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'time', 'aired', 'watching', 'back-to-back', 'none', 'episodes', 'really', 'kept', 'attention', 'Golden', 'Anniversary', 'when', 'family', 'did', 'hilarious', 'job', 'James', 'Brown', 'song', 'Other', 'let', 'DVD', 'run', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'laugh', 'much', 'One', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'was', 'way', 'DVD', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'once', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'credits', 'quickly', 'get', 'next', 'one', 'keep', 'selecting', 'even', 'using', 'down', 'enter', 'keys', 'menu', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'too', 'scattered', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'DVD', 'was', 'sectioned', 'Act', '1', 'Act', '2', 'someone', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'other', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'obvious', 'was', 'Claire', 'was', 'pregnant', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'child', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'things', 'stuffed', 'bear', 'front', 'why', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'bed', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'obvious', 'tricks', 'were', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'know', 'writers', 'producers', 'had', 'be', 'creative', 'trying', 'find', 'things', 'block', 'stomach']",The Cosby Show: Season 3

1057159,A08354481PDGYSTVRUL43,B000NJISIY,Tykeesha,"[2, 2]","Airing from September 25, 1986 to May 7, 1987, The Cosby Show Season 3 continued to show one of the most groundbreaking sitcoms in television history. The third season of The Cosby Show starred Bill Cosby as Dr. Cliff Huxtable, Phylicia Rashad as Clair Huxtable, Sabrina LeBeauf as Sondra Huxtable, Lisa Bonet as Denise Huxtable, Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Theo Huxtable, Tempestt Bledsoe as Vanessa Huxtable, and Keshia Knight Pulliam as Rudy Huxtable. Season 3 continued to focus on doctor Cliff Huxtable and his attorney wife, Clair, raising their five children in Brooklyn, New York. The children consisted of the eldest, overachiever Sondra, now in her final year at Princeton University and engaged to her boyfriend, 18 year-old, lazy, irresponsible Denise, who starts her freshmen year at Hillman College (Cliff and Clair's alma mater), 16 year-old only son Theo, who has his mind on girls more than ever this season, 13 year-old, outspoken Vanessa, who starts to rebel this season, and the lovable youngest, 7 year-old Rudy. In season three, the Huxtables dealt with Vanessa rebelling and wearing make up without permssion, Rudy becoming more bossy and getting her first ""boyfriend,"" Theo letting girls get in the way of his studies, Cliff's friend having a health scare and Clair presuading him to diet, Denise getting a D on her initial college grades, and the tempestuous couple of Sondra and Elvin getting engaged. Recurring characters this season include Elvin (played by Geoffrey Owens), Sondra's chauvinistic boyfriend, Russell and Anna Huxtable (played by Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor), Cliff's parents, Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley (played by Carl Payne), Theo's mischievous scheming partner, Peter (played by Peter Costa), the Huxtable's neighbor and Rudy's shy and quiet friend, famous for running out of the house in times of trouble, and Kenny aka ""Bud,"" Rudy's loud and chaunvinistic ""boy"" friend. Season two was placed at #1 in the summer of 1985 in the Nielsen Ratings, marking the beginnings of the series five-year streak as the number one show in America. Season three was placed at #1 in the summer of 1987. On June 5, 2007, First Look Studios released The Cosby Show Season 3 and The Cosby Show Season 4 on DVD. This is my review of Season 3. The show itself this season is better than the last season. There are more guest stars this season, including Robert Culp, Sinbad and Lou Meyers. First Look have decided not to put any bonus features into this set. The set is really cheap-looking when it comes to the packaging. The first two seasons had a Digipak cardboard foldout design. Seasons three and four use three slim cases, one for each disc. Season three has purple cases and the discs all look the same. They have the same image as the front cover art: Cliff and Clair standing in a white background with a purple bar at the top saying Season 3. Disc 1 contains episodes 1-9. Disc 2 contains episodes 10-17. Disc 3 contains episodes 18-25. The menus are nice. The menus are purple and play the season three theme song (a Latin salsa theme). You can't play all of the episodes at once like the first two seasons. You have to play them individually. There are 25 eoisodes this season. Here is a list of episodes:Disc 1Bring 'em Back Alive * (episodes with * next to them are my favorites)Food for Thought *Golden Anniversary *Man Talk *Mother, May I? *The MarchTheo's FlightVanessa's RichDenise Gets a D *Disc 2A Girl and Her Dog *War StoriesCliff in Charge *Monster Man Huxtable *Rudy Spends the NightSay Hello to a Good Buy *Denise Gets an Opinion *Calling Doctor HuxtableDisc 3You Only Hurt the One You Love *The ShowerCliff's 50th BirthdayI Know That You KnowAndalusian FluBald and Beautiful *Planning Parenthood *HillmanI recommend this DVD to literally anyone of all ages. Little kids will relate to Rudy. Teens will relate to Vanessa and Theo. Young adults will relate Denise and Sondra. Adults will relate to Cliff and Clair.",4,The Cosby Show Season 3,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,3964,"['Airing', 'September', '25', '1986', 'May', '7', '1987', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Season', '3', 'continued', 'show', 'one', 'most', 'groundbreaking', 'sitcoms', 'television', 'history', 'third', 'season', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'starred', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Dr.', 'Cliff', 'Huxtable', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'Clair', 'Huxtable', 'Sabrina', 'LeBeauf', 'Sondra', 'Huxtable', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Denise', 'Huxtable', 'Malcolm-Jamal', 'Warner', 'Theo', 'Huxtable', 'Tempestt', 'Bledsoe', 'Vanessa', 'Huxtable', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'Rudy', 'Huxtable', 'Season', '3', 'continued', 'focus', 'doctor', 'Cliff', 'Huxtable', 'attorney', 'wife', 'Clair', 'raising', 'five', 'children', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'children', 'consisted', 'eldest', 'overachiever', 'Sondra', 'now', 'final', 'year', 'Princeton', 'University', 'engaged', 'boyfriend', '18', 'year-old', 'lazy', 'irresponsible', 'Denise', 'who', 'freshmen', 'year', 'Hillman', 'College', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'alma', 'mater', '16', 'year-old', 'only', 'son', 'Theo', 'who', 'mind', 'girls', 'more', 'ever', 'season', '13', 'year-old', 'outspoken', 'Vanessa', 'who', 'rebel', 'season', 'lovable', 'youngest', '7', 'year-old', 'Rudy', 'season', 'three', 'Huxtables', 'dealt', 'Vanessa', 'rebelling', 'wearing', 'make', 'up', 'permssion', 'Rudy', 'becoming', 'more', 'bossy', 'getting', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'Theo', 'letting', 'girls', 'get', 'way', 'studies', 'Cliff', 'friend', 'having', 'health', 'scare', 'Clair', 'presuading', 'diet', 'Denise', 'getting', 'D', 'initial', 'college', 'grades', 'tempestuous', 'couple', 'Sondra', 'Elvin', 'getting', 'engaged', 'Recurring', 'characters', 'season', 'include', 'Elvin', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Owens', 'Sondra', 'chauvinistic', 'boyfriend', 'Russell', 'Anna', 'Huxtable', 'played', 'Earle', 'Hyman', 'Clarice', 'Taylor', 'Cliff', 'parents', 'Walter', 'Cockroach', 'Bradley', 'played', 'Carl', 'Payne', 'Theo', 'mischievous', 'scheming', 'partner', 'Peter', 'played', 'Peter', 'Costa', 'Huxtable', 'neighbor', 'Rudy', 'shy', 'quiet', 'friend', 'famous', 'running', 'out', 'house', 'times', 'trouble', 'Kenny', 'aka', 'Bud', 'Rudy', 'loud', 'chaunvinistic', 'boy', 'friend', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'placed', '1', 'summer', '1985', 'Nielsen', 'Ratings', 'marking', 'beginnings', 'series', 'five-year', 'streak', 'number', 'one', 'show', 'America', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'placed', '1', 'summer', '1987', 'June', '5', '2007', 'First', 'Look', 'Studios', 'released', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Season', '3', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'review', 'Season', '3', 'show', 'season', 'better', 'last', 'season', 'are', 'more', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'including', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Sinbad', 'Lou', 'Meyers', 'First', 'Look', 'have', 'decided', 'not', 'put', 'bonus', 'set', 'set', 'really', 'cheap-looking', 'when', 'packaging', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'Digipak', 'cardboard', 'foldout', 'design', 'Seasons', 'three', 'four', 'use', 'three', 'slim', 'cases', 'one', 'disc', 'Season', 'three', 'purple', 'cases', 'discs', 'look', 'same', 'have', 'same', 'image', 'front', 'cover', 'art', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'standing', 'white', 'background', 'purple', 'bar', 'top', 'saying', 'Season', '3', 'Disc', '1', 'contains', 'episodes', '1-9', 'Disc', '2', 'contains', 'episodes', '10-17', 'Disc', '3', 'contains', 'episodes', '18-25', 'menus', 'are', 'nice', 'menus', 'are', 'purple', 'play', 'season', 'three', 'theme', 'song', 'Latin', 'salsa', 'theme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'episodes', 'once', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'play', 'individually', 'are', '25', 'eoisodes', 'season', 'Here', 'list', 'episodes', 'Disc', '1Bring', ""'em"", 'Back', 'Alive', '*', 'episodes', '*', 'next', 'are', 'favorites', 'Food', 'Thought', '*Golden', 'Anniversary', '*Man', 'Talk', '*Mother', 'May', 'MarchTheo', 'FlightVanessa', 'RichDenise', 'D', '*Disc', '2A', 'Girl', 'Her', 'Dog', '*War', 'StoriesCliff', 'Charge', '*Monster', 'Man', 'Huxtable', '*Rudy', 'NightSay', 'Hello', 'Good', 'Buy', '*Denise', 'Opinion', '*Calling', 'Doctor', 'HuxtableDisc', '3You', 'Only', 'Hurt', 'One', 'Love', '*The', 'ShowerCliff', '50th', 'BirthdayI', 'Know', 'KnowAndalusian', 'FluBald', 'Beautiful', '*Planning', 'Parenthood', '*HillmanI', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'literally', 'anyone', 'ages', 'Little', 'kids', 'will', 'relate', 'Rudy', 'Teens', 'will', 'relate', 'Vanessa', 'Theo', 'Young', 'adults', 'will', 'relate', 'Denise', 'Sondra', 'Adults', 'will', 'relate', 'Cliff', 'Clair']",The Cosby Show: Season 3
