That movie was called 'Dead Man Walking.'What a pleasant surprise that such a real story could actually be portayed in such a moving way, and yet still keep the dark edge of the subject that always was there.We're taken inside prison walls with Raymond Graham, a seemingly confident man with a witty sense of humour which is unusual for someone who is about to be put to death for the murder of a seventeen year old convenience store worker. He is a man who doesn't realise just how serious his fate is and is still holding out hope of being saved, and as the clock ticks on, his confidence cracks, but never fades completely.The acting of this movie is wonderful. Especially Jeff Fahey who plays Raymond. You could almost believe you were watching a documentary rather than a movie if you go by the acting of the serious yet lighthearted man whom he portrays.Most of all, this movie is straight to the point. No messing around.This is a film version of the execution of Raymond Graham. It's a true story, it's and it may open your eyes to just what people on death row go through before their hour of doom and how even when they have people surrounding them, willing to talk before they're led inside the injection room, they know that in the end they're not on their side, and how you can still feel alone even if you're in a conversation.And of course, that when faced with the grim reality of death, every man has fear in his heart.Raymond Graham - perhaps one of the more meaningful and deeper prisoners on death row. Just view the movie and see if you don't shed a few tears and feel the sting of compassion as you watch feel as if you're in the jail cell with him.A very good movie - highly recommended.",4,"""You put the bullets in the gun but get someone else to pull the trigger!""",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,1870,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'particularly', ""'d"", 'watched', 'movie', 'focused', 'death', 'penalty', 'beforehand', 'was', 'awful', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'was', 'called', ""'Dead"", 'Man', 'Walking', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'real', 'story', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'portayed', 'such', 'moving', 'way', 'yet', 'still', 'keep', 'dark', 'edge', 'subject', 'always', 'was', 'there.We', ""'re"", 'taken', 'inside', 'prison', 'walls', 'Raymond', 'Graham', 'seemingly', 'confident', 'man', 'witty', 'sense', 'humour', 'unusual', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'murder', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'convenience', 'store', 'worker', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'realise', 'just', 'how', 'serious', 'fate', 'still', 'holding', 'out', 'hope', 'being', 'saved', 'clock', 'ticks', 'confidence', 'cracks', 'never', 'completely.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'Especially', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'who', 'Raymond', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'were', 'watching', 'documentary', 'rather', 'movie', 'go', 'acting', 'serious', 'yet', 'lighthearted', 'man', 'whom', 'portrays.Most', 'movie', 'straight', 'point', 'No', 'messing', 'around.This', 'film', 'version', 'execution', 'Raymond', 'Graham', 'true', 'story', 'may', 'open', 'eyes', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'death', 'row', 'go', 'hour', 'doom', 'how', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'people', 'surrounding', 'willing', 'talk', ""'re"", 'led', 'injection', 'room', 'know', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'side', 'how', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'alone', 'even', ""'re"", 'conversation.And', 'course', 'when', 'faced', 'grim', 'reality', 'death', 'man', 'fear', 'heart.Raymond', 'Graham', 'perhaps', 'one', 'more', 'meaningful', 'deeper', 'prisoners', 'death', 'row', 'Just', 'view', 'movie', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'feel', 'sting', 'compassion', 'watch', 'feel', ""'re"", 'jail', 'cell', 'him.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

But it is a nice movie if one sees it as a narrative of a story of a man to be executed to death by lethal injection.
