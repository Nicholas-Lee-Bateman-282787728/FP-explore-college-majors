A few times I found myself saying, ""Umm... Aren't you going to tell them the super creepy thing that just happened??? I mean you all know about a possible ghost and what???? nothing???"" ...that kinda thing. Like, sure I was just attacked by something, but I'll meet you at the Soc-Hop tonight after going back to my spooky Dorm! Other than a bunch of this prattle it was a OK film. Fun and good acting with some very nice special effects. Overall a good premise, but they could have made it plainer and more direct as far as the story line.

Much to my surprise, I actually found it entertaining and worth at least a few more watches.  It's not all that original and it's not all that gorey, so I wouldn't mind letting a tweener watch this one.  Others here have outlined the plot of the angry ghost of Katie Malone, so I won't rehash it again.  It's got a basically good premise; this ghost wants family and wants to keep them together at ANY cost, so lots of people who mess with our three protagonists are dealt with in very unsavory ways.  I have to say that, unlike some of these types of movies I've watched, the script isn't half bad, and the story keeps you glued to the end.  There are a few surprises in the plotline, but I won't give them away, and the story of Katie as a human is actually quite sympathetic.  It won't scare you out of your wits like a more expensive film, but if you're not big on gore like I'm not, I'd urge you to check it out.  It won't win an oscar, but it's downright entertaining.",4,Not a Bad Little Film if You're into Low Budget Scare Films.,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,1062,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'morning', 'Netflix', 'wondering', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'Much', 'surprise', 'actually', 'found', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'least', 'few', 'more', 'watches', 'not', 'original', 'not', 'gorey', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'letting', 'tweener', 'watch', 'one', 'Others', 'here', 'have', 'outlined', 'plot', 'angry', 'ghost', 'Katie', 'Malone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'again', 'got', 'basically', 'good', 'premise', 'ghost', 'family', 'keep', 'together', 'ANY', 'cost', 'so', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'mess', 'three', 'protagonists', 'are', 'dealt', 'very', 'unsavory', 'ways', 'have', 'say', 'types', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'script', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'story', 'glued', 'end', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'plotline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'story', 'Katie', 'human', 'actually', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scare', 'wits', 'more', 'expensive', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'big', 'gore', ""'m"", 'not', ""'d"", 'urge', 'check', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'oscar', 'downright', 'entertaining']",N/A
1497027,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B005P7XE3S,Compay,"[4, 4]","Kill Katie Malone is a step above most straight-to-video horror flicks in that the visuals are quality, but it has little more to offer besides that.  The movie tells the story of three friends in college that decide to buy a ghost on an online auction site, and receive a mysterious box soon after.  But after opening the box, a series of tragic events occur to people around them, and one of the trio tries to discover a means of reversing their fate.This was the first feature film by director Carlos Ramos Jr, which is a surprise considering how well it was shot. The cinematography was good, as was the color correction.  The cast is made up largely of TV actors, so the performances are a bit better than what you'd expect for most low-budget horror movies.  Some horror aficionados may also appreciate that the malevolent spirit in the movie almost never appears in a visible form, which gives the movie a similar vibe as the 1982 film ""The Entity.""That being said, Kill Katie Malone disappoints when it comes to the story itself.  The concept of passing along a curse or evil entity has already been done. The Ring, Drag Me to Hell, and the upcoming Heart-Shaped Box film based on the 2007 novel by Stephen King's son.  While the film does offer up a few unique deaths and injuries, it's light on blood for gore fans.  The movie simply plods along, with characters that are hard to keep up with, and a generally uninteresting plot.  And if you're a Dean Cain fan, you may want to pass on Kill Katie Malone. Despite having his name front and center on the movie's cover, Cain gets a grand total of five minutes of screen time for the entire film.Considering this was the first major film project by Carlos Ramos, I'd say that he did a quality directing job.  The visual look of the film is enough to consider it four out of five stars, but the weak plot and uninspired writing drags it down to a two-star review. If you enjoy independent horror flicks like I do, it's certainly won't hurt to add this to your Netflix queue. Other than that, I wouldn't suggest buying the Blu-Ray until after you've at least given it a rent.",2,Good Visuals - But Boring & Unoriginal Story,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2130,"['Kill', 'Katie', 'Malone', 'step', 'most', 'straight-to-video', 'horror', 'flicks', 'visuals', 'are', 'quality', 'little', 'more', 'offer', 'movie', 'story', 'three', 'friends', 'college', 'decide', 'buy', 'ghost', 'online', 'auction', 'site', 'receive', 'mysterious', 'box', 'soon', 'opening', 'box', 'series', 'tragic', 'events', 'occur', 'people', 'one', 'trio', 'discover', 'means', 'reversing', 'fate.This', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Carlos', 'Ramos', 'Jr', 'surprise', 'considering', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'shot', 'cinematography', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'color', 'correction', 'cast', 'made', 'up', 'largely', 'TV', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'bit', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'most', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'horror', 'aficionados', 'may', 'also', 'appreciate', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'movie', 'almost', 'never', 'visible', 'form', 'movie', 'similar', 'vibe', '1982', 'film', 'Entity', 'being', 'said', 'Kill', 'Katie', 'Malone', 'when', 'story', 'concept', 'passing', 'curse', 'evil', 'entity', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Ring', 'Drag', 'Me', 'Hell', 'upcoming', 'Heart-Shaped', 'Box', 'film', 'based', '2007', 'novel', 'Stephen', 'King', 'son', 'film', 'offer', 'up', 'few', 'unique', 'deaths', 'injuries', 'light', 'blood', 'gore', 'fans', 'movie', 'simply', 'plods', 'characters', 'are', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'generally', 'uninteresting', 'plot', ""'re"", 'Dean', 'Cain', 'fan', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'Kill', 'Katie', 'Malone', 'having', 'name', 'front', 'center', 'movie', 'cover', 'Cain', 'grand', 'total', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'entire', 'film.Considering', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'project', 'Carlos', 'Ramos', ""'d"", 'say', 'did', 'quality', 'directing', 'job', 'visual', 'look', 'film', 'enough', 'consider', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'weak', 'plot', 'uninspired', 'writing', 'down', 'two-star', 'review', 'enjoy', 'independent', 'horror', 'flicks', 'do', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'add', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'Other', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'buying', 'Blu-Ray', ""'ve"", 'least', 'given', 'rent']",N/A

The movie is shot in what is supposed to be a college dorm. So much of this movie is shot in very small rooms. The college isn't even good for atmosphere. At least they could have used some older college with a history, with old architecture. But no, the rooms look quite modern. The three young college kids also must be complete idiots, for after having bought a so called ghost online horrible events soon transpire but the college students simply can't see or feel any ""ghostly"" connection to any of it. When the ghost visits their small dorm apartments they again stay very DUMB to the point of retardation. A ghost was in the bed or it just trashed the apartment but yet it must have been some fast very moving college senior or junior. Yes, upperclassmen are picking on the lower classmen.The acting is terrible in this movie as is the dialogue. Dean Cain is supposedly in this movie but what I saw was a cameo at the beginning of the movie. He is the one who put the ghost on the ""YouBid"" auction website. I don't know if he is in the middle of the movie or not but PHASE FOUR studios milks his name for all it is worth by putting it above the movie title.

The ending is somewhat disappointing. Dean Cain has a cameo in it despite his high billing. These things are kind of what I expected, however. what I did not expect were some rather creepy moments in the middle of the film, or a few times when I actually wondered what the ghost would want.This is NOT to say I would buy the film, I thought about it but am still debating that, but watching it was entertaining enough. I am a fan of lower budget horror so that does help with these, but a few of my friends who watched this also seemed to think it was a lot better than expected. It is already coming on the movie channels, too, if that means anything to someone wanting to make up their minds whether or not to pick it up.I would say watch some of it, the plot is not complex and it solely relies on the horror of the moment. If that does not seem up to par for you, then pass on it.3.5/5 - noting that this is a grade on lower budget movies, not to be confused with a 3.5 on some  big budget scale.",4,"3.5/ 4.0, meaning ""I Like It in a Low-budget Movie kinda Way""",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1629,"['movie', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'bump', 'thought', 'would', 'making', 'low', 'budget', 'scored', 'high', 'B', 'movie', 'range', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'was', 'better', 'anticipated.Basically', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'looking', 'thrill', 'go', 'online', 'find', 'box', 'sale', 'very', 'own', 'ghost', 'three', 'laugh', 'two', 'are', 'apprehensive', 'price', 'what', 'offered', 'one', 'When', 'few', 'odd', 'things', 'happen', 'oddity', 'deadly', 'wonder', 'what', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'spirit', 'someone', 'named', 'Katie', 'Malone.Like', 'said', 'cheap', 'movie', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'cameo', 'high', 'billing', 'things', 'are', 'kind', 'what', 'expected', 'however', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'were', 'rather', 'creepy', 'moments', 'middle', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'actually', 'wondered', 'what', 'ghost', 'would', 'want.This', 'NOT', 'say', 'would', 'buy', 'film', 'thought', 'am', 'still', 'debating', 'watching', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'am', 'fan', 'lower', 'budget', 'horror', 'help', 'few', 'friends', 'who', 'watched', 'also', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'already', 'coming', 'movie', 'channels', 'too', 'anything', 'someone', 'wanting', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'not', 'pick', 'up.I', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'plot', 'not', 'complex', 'solely', 'horror', 'moment', 'not', 'seem', 'up', 'par', 'then', 'pass', 'it.3.5/5', 'noting', 'grade', 'lower', 'budget', 'movies', 'not', 'be', 'confused', '3.5', 'big', 'budget', 'scale']",N/A
