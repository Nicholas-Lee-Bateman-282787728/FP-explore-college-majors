No other complete season cost anywhere near that! Complete Fifth Season is $45.51 and Complete Fifth Season is $51.35. Perhaps the person at Amazon in charge of pricing goofed. If it is not Amazons fault then the producing studio wants to gouge (&#34;screw&#34; would be more apropos) fans who have consistently bought each season. The price for the complete Season Seven needs to be adjusted SHARPLY DOWNWARD!!,1,A great series -- but fams are being taken to the clearners!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,585,"['one', 'great', 'series', 'Golden', 'Age', 'TV', 'said', 'gave', 'ONE', 'STAR', 'price', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'OF', 'LINE', '90.00', 'complete', '7th', 'Season', 'OBSCENE', 'other', 'complete', 'season', 'cost', 'anywhere', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', '45.51', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', '51.35', 'Perhaps', 'person', 'Amazon', 'charge', 'pricing', 'goofed', 'not', 'Amazons', 'fault', 'then', 'producing', 'studio', 'gouge', '34', 'screw', '34', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'apropos', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'consistently', 'bought', 'season', 'price', 'complete', 'Season', 'Seven', 'be', 'adjusted', 'SHARPLY', 'DOWNWARD']",Rawhide: Seventh Season - Volume 2

It is rediculous for Amazon to charge $90.00 for season 7. I am a loyal buyer of many classic TV shows and love Rawhide as my favorite western but, will wait until someone at Amazon acquires some semblence of common sense and prices this item  in line with previous seasons or just forgo purchase.

Poor retired folks need not apply.Rawhide plays on TV for free these days, and you can get an over-the-air antenna on Amazon for forty bucks by Terk that pulls in more free Rawhide channels!! 70-80 dollars for oldie TV shows that, to the best of my knowledge, ol' Clint doesn't get to see dime from, is ridiculously over priced.. Only season one is a deal. The volume splitting is horrible. The show was profitable and successful in the 50s-60s. Some other tv show dvd sales suffer this same high priced volume scenario. We get sucked into season one for 15 dollars and then the dollars and volumes start amping up to 70-80!So if no one is getting paid, where is the money going? Tv studios are the only entities still surviving from this golden age to reap the rewards. They have generally have no one to pay but themselves. The original producers are gone too. I love watching these these old shows and IMDBing the actors. Not many of them from the fifties and sixties are still with us. Too many smoked like chimneys and lived to fifty. If you read where many of them spent their final days, it was in the Los Angeles area actors retirement homes. I assume they did not have the luxury of getting paid any further than the few bucks they got paid for the movie or tv shows at the time. Today, you make a hundred episodes of anything, you are a megamillionaire retiring in Beverly Hills with a hospital full of nurses..Clint was lucky to live long enough to make movies into the age of residuals and dvd sales to collect what he isn't getting from these dvds. If I'm wrong, and someone is still alive to collect some cash for acting here, let me know. What am I really paying a high price for, if no one associated with Rawhide is getting a nickel.",1,one IRA cashed outta ten($?),1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1794,"['Great', 'nostalgia', 'rich', 'retired', 'folks', 'Poor', 'retired', 'folks', 'need', 'not', 'apply.Rawhide', 'plays', 'TV', 'free', 'days', 'can', 'get', 'over-the-air', 'antenna', 'Amazon', 'forty', 'bucks', 'Terk', 'more', 'free', 'Rawhide', 'channels', '70-80', 'dollars', 'oldie', 'TV', 'shows', 'best', 'knowledge', 'ol', 'Clint', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'dime', 'ridiculously', 'priced..', 'Only', 'season', 'one', 'deal', 'volume', 'splitting', 'horrible', 'show', 'was', 'profitable', 'successful', '50s-60s', 'other', 'tv', 'show', 'sales', 'suffer', 'same', 'high', 'priced', 'volume', 'scenario', 'get', 'sucked', 'season', 'one', '15', 'dollars', 'then', 'dollars', 'volumes', 'start', 'amping', 'up', '70-80', 'So', 'one', 'getting', 'paid', 'where', 'money', 'going', 'Tv', 'studios', 'are', 'only', 'entities', 'still', 'surviving', 'golden', 'age', 'reap', 'rewards', 'have', 'generally', 'have', 'one', 'pay', 'original', 'producers', 'are', 'gone', 'too', 'love', 'watching', 'old', 'shows', 'IMDBing', 'actors', 'Not', 'many', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'are', 'still', 'Too', 'many', 'smoked', 'chimneys', 'lived', 'fifty', 'read', 'where', 'many', 'spent', 'final', 'days', 'was', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'actors', 'retirement', 'homes', 'assume', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'luxury', 'getting', 'paid', 'further', 'few', 'bucks', 'got', 'paid', 'movie', 'tv', 'shows', 'time', 'Today', 'make', 'hundred', 'episodes', 'anything', 'are', 'megamillionaire', 'retiring', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'hospital', 'full', 'nurses..Clint', 'was', 'lucky', 'live', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'movies', 'age', 'residuals', 'dvd', 'sales', 'collect', 'what', ""n't"", 'getting', 'dvds', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'someone', 'still', 'alive', 'collect', 'cash', 'acting', 'here', 'let', 'know', 'What', 'am', 'really', 'paying', 'high', 'price', 'one', 'associated', 'Rawhide', 'getting', 'nickel']",Rawhide: Seventh Season - Volume 2

After an absence of three plus years, Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) returns, making this season extra sweet. The DVD cover art certainly should have pictured him, along with a better photo of Eric Fleming. Mr. Fleming's characterization of trail boss Gil Favor is the real reason to watch Rawhide, and has been what has brought me back to CBS for each successive volume I have purchased. Year after year he put in the most versatile acting, riveting the viewer into the plot, as he punched the stories through. Mr. Favor had the best life of any of his drovers, with side stories involving his daughters, and he improved any scene he was in. Season eight, by comparison, is a stampede; all the regulars except Rowdy, Wishbone, and Quince, were jettisoned; the camaraderie, gone.

Now, all these years later, I realize that it was much better than I thought.  After seeing the onslaught of sleazy &#34;reality&#34; shows lately, I treasure the old westerns for the gems that they were.  Rawhide always had lots of action, and the actors---both the regular cast and guest stars---were really convincing.  There was more of a plot in each episode than can be found in a whole week of current programming.  The only drawback to these episodes of Rawhide is that they were filmed in black and white.
