825430,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000274T94,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","""This film was inspired by a true story."" The film begins by showing a ship on a lake that says the northwest. A man walks through the streets. The mill closed down, no work in town. The former sheriff died in a one-car accident (?). Cris learns more about his town. The film slowly introduces the characters, as if padding out the time. The football game does the same. There is a gambling casino in town. Cris sees the dealer switch dice; he wants to try again. Their security forces arrive and the fight begins. Cris is over-powered and banged up, then dumped in the rainy street. He recovers and returns home.The head of the casino visits Cris and tries to make a deal. The casino operator owns the town. The sheriff is in cahoots with this institution. Does the casino also peddle drugs to teenagers? Cris takes a big stick and returns to the casino to recover his special force medallion that was stolen from him. Jay Hamilton says ""this has changed our relationship a bit"". Cris is arrested and represents himself at the trial. The jury decides on an acquittal! [Jury nullification?] Next Cris is the new sheriff and fires all the deputies. [Isn't democracy great?] A casino is a machine to print dollars. Sheriff Cris wants to clean out the crystal meth production in his county. [This plague of the country is seldom mentioned in Hollywood films. It is mostly domestically produced.]One suspect is arrested and his truck taken apart in a search for drugs. Will there be revenge against Cris or his parents? [Will there be a lull in the story to surprise the viewers with sudden action?] The sheriff's truck explodes, his office is machine gunned. There is a shoot out, and the bad guys bite the dust. Cris learns where the meth lab is hidden. Will there be a final duel between Cris and Jay? Guess who wins?The original 1972 film had a raw and gritty story that was far, far better. This film is slower paced with fewer actors, showing its low budget and cheaper script.

It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments.  The Rock is pretty convincing in his roll but the biggest problem with the film is that it's WAY too short and actually feels rushed during certain spots (like for instance, when the Rock becomes the sheriff- there should have been more build-up here instead of him suddenly ""being the sheriff"").I'm not really complaining.

The script could have been a little longer and contained a little deeper dialogue, but the action and drama makes up for the shallow parts.I am a little upset that the DVD only has a few BLOOPERS; The Rock is a funny guy, and I am sure there HAD to be more bloopers during the filming that could have been included on the DVD.The Audio Commentary by The Rock was absolutely hilarious.  The Rock has a great sense of humor.  He does need to quit calling everyone he know ""My MAN"" though - way too repetitive.  If everyone is ""The MAN"" then no one is ""The MAN.""  Listen to the Rock audio commentary if you want to hear what I mean.Neal McDonough was an excellent bad guy, but I believe he needed more dialogue added to his character.  He, like The Rock, has a great screen presence and it should have been used more.The shoot-out at the sheriff's office was a little over-the-edge.  Hundreds and hundreds of shots fired and The Rock and his woman never suffer a hit.  Little hard to believe.The rest of the extras on the DVD are really good - not as depressing as the Bloopers extra.Most buyers will enjoy this film.

825452,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B000274T94,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 0]","'Walking Tall' is the story of a soldier named Chris Vaughn, played by the Rock, that comes home to find his hometown has changed.  And not in a good way.  The lumber mill that was the heart of the town's economy has been closed and a casino has risen to take its place.  Drugs, gambling, and pornography have seeped their way into this once proud town.  On a visit to the casion, Vaughn decides he has seen enough, and things start to happen...This movie really is an old western set in the modern day.  After getting into trouble with the casino and the sheriff's department the casino controls, Vaughn makes a promise to run for sheriff and clean up the town.  True to his word, he does just that.  You could almost see Clint Eastwood playing this part about 20 years ago.The Rock brings his charisma to the role of Chris Vaughn.  He successfully pulls off the role of likeable, respectable returning soldier.  While the role doesn't stretch his talents as an actor, he was perfect for the part.  Johnny Knoxville also shines in this movie.  He plays Ray Templeton, an old friend of Vaughn's that got into trouble when Vaughn joined the army, but managed to redeem himself.  Templeton becomes Vaughn's deputy and helps clean up the town.  I'm not usually a fan of Knoxville's, but he managed to give just the right performance for this movie.The DVD has special features you'd come to expect.  There is the 'making of' documentary in which all the actors talk about how they approached their characters and wonderful everyone else was to work with (once you have watched enough of these, you can begin to fill in the dialogue yourself).  There is a limited out take real with a few funny bloopers.  Overall, there is enough to keep the DVD enthusiast happy.This movie is not a model of great acting.  It's not an exceptionally deep movie with a complicated plot.  What it is is a lot of fun and a good movie to pick up when you need something to do that doesn't take a lot of thinking.  Its also good when you are looking for a movie that doesn't have a bunch of tired special effects.

After seeing this version, I am not so certain that I would want to see the older one.The Rock had a hit in his last film last September, ""The Rundown."" He was even good in that movie, and I felt that he would become the newest action star. The actor that will make many action movies, they will all hit number one, and make tons of money. After watching ""Walking Tall,"" I am starting to doubt that. It wasn't really that good of a movie, but it was good for what it was. I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the theatres unless you are a true action buff.The main problem with ""Walking Tall"" is that it is about 81 minutes, but with credits and all it probably only hits about 75 minutes. The lenght is not the problem, but it is the content inside of it. There are many scenes that are just useless, and I have no idea why they are even included in the movie. It took a while for the plot to open up, and after thinking it would be more exciting, they throw in more useless scenes. I kept waiting for those scenes to influence the rest of the movie, but it did not.The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn. Chris comes back to him hometown and he finds that everything is changing around him. The successful lumber yard has been changed into a casino that is run by his rival Jay Hamilton. He sees his parents, his younger sister, and her son Pete. He sees his friend Ray, and the two then go check out the casino. Chris sees a striptease from his ex-girlfriend Deni, leaves embarrassed, and then sees a craps dealer using a pair of dice that are fixed. Chris tells the guards, but it turns into a physical fight that leaves Chris wounded. Christ then finds out that the casino dealers are also dealing drugs to the kids in town, and he gets even more angry when he finds out that Pete is doing drugs. This leads to a violent trip to the casino, leaving many things shattered. He becomes under arrest, and at the trial he vows that if he is innocent, he will run for sheriff and bring good to the two. That is exactly what happens, and from that moment on, Chris decides to get rid of the wrong that has invaded his town.""Walking Tall"" is not a bad film, but it is also not a good one. I enjoyed it for what it was. It was entertaining, but even though it was 81 minutes, it should have had more development, and more story instead of the dull, pointless scenes that they decided to show. This could have been better as a made for tv movie, or even direct to video.

Mainly, I disagree with the fact that the previous reviewer says the movie claims to be based on the original movie, but is not.  I think the this movie is based on the idea of the original movie in the sense that there is a guy standing up against local corruption.  The original is outdated for our times.  It should almost only be seen as an historical piece.Like the original movie, I think the most exciting action scene happens in the middle of the movie, not the end, where he goes into the bar and ""does his thing"" when he finds that there is a major problem with the folks running the place and what has happened to his hometown.I think it is a very moderized version of the original.  Still, considering that the original was based on a true story and this one is fiction, there are discrepencies as the previous reviewer pointed out.So, it is hard to call the new Walking Tall a ""remake"" of the original.  Rather, it is an ""adaption"" of the original to modern times.Basically, The Rock plays a really honorable guy who you feel good about in the movie.  I say, ""relax.""  Let the obvious problem with reality and connections to the original pass you by and enjoy this movie.  Enjoy it for what it is and don't make too many connections to the original.  If you are a fan of The Rock, you will like this.  His character is very likable.Still, as the previous reviewer explains, there are many C. Bronson type scenes in the movie.

The plot is very simple: there is virtually no character development, no unexpected plot twists, and everyone is exactly what they appear to be; and is essentially just a vehicle for 75 minutes (it's not a very long film) of gratuitous violence. In fact, because of this, some people may consider this film to be unwatchably bad. Nevertheless, fans of The Rock do not watch his films for his superior acting ability and will probably love every moment of it.Comparing this to other films starring The Rock, this is one of his better films.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness.

825479,A183RGDCCC913M,B000274T94,"Hugh S. Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[0, 4]","As far I could tell, ""Walking Tall"" propels two polar opposite responses. Most men, upon seeing the film, promptly jaunt to the bathroom to behold their biceps in front of the mirror. Women, bullied into tagging along in retribution for the last chick flick they forced their date to view, make a dead sprint for the bathroom for a different reason. This is to disgorge the heavy helping of testosterone-induced rubbish that flickered before their eyes for a never-ending 90 minutes.For the most part, I'm usually all for dumbed-down, explosive tumult splashed onto a silver screen. That is, if it is done properly. ""The Rundown,"" The Rock's most recent film prior to this one, serves as a prime example of this. The film blew me away. I was thoroughly entertained, applauding myself for $6 well spent.However, at the end of ""Walking Tall,"" I found myself conforming to the ideology of the prototypical female audience member. Indeed, there I was, dejectedly curled around a toilet bowl with a noticeably lighter wallet expelling all of the dunderheaded remnants of ""Walking Tall."" This all occurs to the chorus of ""bad ass"" and ""cool"" being exclaimed from the other taut gentlemen present. (Rest assured, a second viewing of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" acted as my salvation. Good golly, Mr. Tarantino is a marvel.)""Walking Tall"" is a remake of a 1973 box office smash. Speaking of which, whatever happened to originality in the moviemaking industry? For heaven's sake, four of the past six movies I've reviewed have been remakes. I beg someone to e-mail me and rationalize why the Antarctica hell-fire ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" are being remade.Anyhow, The Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Douglas Johnson, stars as war hero Chris Vaughn who has just returned to his hometown from service overseas. He finds out the mill has been shut down, a casino has sprung up and neighborhood kids are suddenly all crack addicts.As it turns out, his high school nemesis Jay Hamilton Jr., played contemptibly by Neal McDonough, is the mastermind behind this cesspool of greed.Vaughn, in a fit of rage, grasps an oak club and embarks on a mission to obliterate the casino to smithereens. After doing so, he defends himself in court with a fervent speech that eventually catapults him to the position of town sheriff.Vaughn then contracts an old buddy named Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville) to be his deputy. Knoxville glimmers as one of the few bright spots in the film. There is no hesitation in my voice when I say that this man, the death-defying ""Jackass"" honcho, has a future ahead of him in Hollywood.From here on out ""Walking Tall"" is an abysmal medley of improbable fight scenes coupled with quick cuts and loud music.

In fact, Walking Tall has already established itself well enough to be included in the small selection of great guy movies shown over and over and over on TBS (The list also includes: The Outsiders, Red Dawn, Heartbreak Ridge, and Road House).The Rock plays the role of Chris Vaughn, a man just back from war and his stint in the Army, who is looking forward to returning to his home town in Washington and enjoying life post-military.  The role is based on the true story of Buford Pusser, a man who, because of his name, simply had to be tough, and as sheriff, took the law into his own hands.  Vaughn, like Pusser, runs into a town that needs help, and he's just the man to do it.  And how's he going to do it?  Oh, wait, did he just pick up?...yeah...he did.  He just picked up a massive 5-foot piece of wood, and he plans on breaking the arms and legs of everyone in his way.In true tough-guy-takes-on-entire-town fashion, Vaughn soon finds his protagonist (John Beasley), who is only important in the sense that there needed to be a bad-guy who gets either his face bashed in or an appendage snapped in two.  It turns out that there is a town-wide conspiracy involving drugs and the local cash-cow casino.  It's so deep even the sleazy local cops are involved, all but providing personal bodyguard services to the bad guys and his drug dealers at the casino.It's up to Rock, who teams up with his old buddy (Johnny Knoxville), to become sheriff, take down the bad guys, and save the town.  Along the way he hooks up with a former classmate (Ashley Scott), who is basically in the movie because she's gorgeous, looks great in a red bra, and fulfills the minimum of one hot-woman-in-action-movie rule.  What ensues is a bunch of The Rock doing what The Rock does, cool demeanor, tough-guy antics, and eyebrow pushups rule as he shows everyone involved that he walks just a little taller than they do.",4,"With a name like Buford Pusser, you gotta be tough!",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,2078,"['When', 'Rock', 'movie', 'cleaning', 'house', 'beating', 'tar', 'people', 'out', 'manly', 'shenanigans', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'good', 'movie', 'horizon', 'fact', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'already', 'established', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'included', 'small', 'selection', 'great', 'guy', 'movies', 'shown', 'TBS', 'list', 'also', 'Outsiders', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'Road', 'House', '.The', 'Rock', 'role', 'Chris', 'Vaughn', 'man', 'just', 'back', 'war', 'stint', 'Army', 'who', 'looking', 'forward', 'returning', 'home', 'town', 'Washington', 'enjoying', 'life', 'post-military', 'role', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'man', 'who', 'name', 'simply', 'had', 'be', 'tough', 'sheriff', 'took', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Vaughn', 'Pusser', 'town', 'help', 'just', 'man', 'do', 'how', 'going', 'do', 'Oh', 'wait', 'did', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'yeah', 'did', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'massive', '5-foot', 'piece', 'wood', 'breaking', 'arms', 'legs', 'everyone', 'way.In', 'true', 'tough-guy-takes-on-entire-town', 'fashion', 'Vaughn', 'soon', 'protagonist', 'John', 'Beasley', 'who', 'only', 'important', 'sense', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'bad-guy', 'who', 'face', 'bashed', 'appendage', 'snapped', 'two', 'out', 'town-wide', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'drugs', 'local', 'cash-cow', 'casino', 'so', 'deep', 'even', 'sleazy', 'local', 'cops', 'are', 'involved', 'providing', 'personal', 'bodyguard', 'services', 'bad', 'guys', 'drug', 'dealers', 'casino.It', 'up', 'Rock', 'who', 'up', 'old', 'buddy', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'become', 'sheriff', 'take', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'save', 'town', 'way', 'up', 'former', 'classmate', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'who', 'basically', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'great', 'red', 'bra', 'minimum', 'one', 'hot-woman-in-action-movie', 'rule', 'What', 'bunch', 'Rock', 'doing', 'what', 'Rock', 'cool', 'demeanor', 'tough-guy', 'antics', 'eyebrow', 'pushups', 'rule', 'everyone', 'involved', 'just', 'little', 'taller', 'do']",Walking Tall

It is considered a remake, but if you haven't seen the original, don't worry, that won't be necessary to enjoy this. Logic was pretty much left on the cutting room floor as was alot of the movie as it's only 86 minutes, and I think that is one of it's major flaws. Don't get me wrong, I still had alot of fun watching it, but it could have been so much better with a tighter script and about 30 minutes longer.I have no problems with the Rock, he has been a blast in everything he's done so far, and you can see he is improving every role. Johnny Knoxville is fine as his best friend, they are an amusing team that blended well together. Neal McDonough is the  villian, and a little bland. Also, Ashley Scott looks great in her red bra and panties, which she is in during a silly shoot out that could have been handled a little better. But that's it, she looks sexy, but not the world's strongest actress.The Rock comes back from his military duties to find his town has become a dump and his nephew hooked on drugs. He then finds out one of his childhood best friends has become the town's main drug dealer and owner of a corrupted casino. In order to fight this, he becomes sheriff and whoops some big-time butt. The scene where he goes mental in the casino and destroys anything that gets in his way in not-to-be-missed.The love story could have been completely nixed in order to give us more action and fight scenes, or even more screen time with Knoxville and Rock. There is no heat or any sparks here, as I said before Scott bores us to death, I'm not sure what else she's been in but I'm hoping she was tons better.I do own the original, and while it is a far superior movie, it does not have the charm that this version contains, this is mostly because of The Rock, he is so much fun to watch, and I do agree with most reviewers who say he could be the next big action star. Actually, I think he is already there, I have not yet seen Doom, but I am really looking forward to it. Let's just hope it's better then the last few movies based on video games we've had the ""pleasure"" of watching (remember Alone in the dark? how about House of the dead?)This could have easily been a 4 star movie, but it's a solid 3-3.5.........enjoyacting.........3 stars, Rock and Knoxville are great, Scott's notdirecting......2 stars, Dropped the ball with the love story and the movie's lengthspecial effects....3 stars, Not to much here, explosions and gunplay galore.action rating....3.5 stars, Done well, except 1 shoot-out, you'll know the one, trust mequality......3.5 stars, No major flaws, choppy here and there",3,"What could have been?....still, good fun",1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2746,"['Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'back', '4th', 'movie', 'better', 'then', 'Mummy', '2', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Rundown', 'considered', 'remake', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'necessary', 'enjoy', 'Logic', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'was', 'alot', 'movie', 'only', '86', 'minutes', 'think', 'one', 'major', 'flaws', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'had', 'alot', 'fun', 'watching', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'tighter', 'script', '30', 'minutes', 'longer.I', 'have', 'problems', 'Rock', 'been', 'blast', 'everything', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'improving', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'fine', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'amusing', 'team', 'blended', 'well', 'together', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'villian', 'little', 'bland', 'Also', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'great', 'red', 'bra', 'panties', 'silly', 'shoot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'little', 'better', 'sexy', 'not', 'world', 'strongest', 'actress.The', 'Rock', 'back', 'military', 'duties', 'find', 'town', 'become', 'dump', 'nephew', 'hooked', 'drugs', 'then', 'out', 'one', 'childhood', 'best', 'friends', 'become', 'town', 'main', 'drug', 'dealer', 'owner', 'corrupted', 'casino', 'order', 'fight', 'sheriff', 'big-time', 'butt', 'scene', 'where', 'mental', 'casino', 'anything', 'way', 'not-to-be-missed.The', 'love', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'nixed', 'order', 'give', 'more', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'even', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Knoxville', 'Rock', 'heat', 'sparks', 'here', 'said', 'Scott', 'death', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'been', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'was', 'tons', 'better.I', 'do', 'own', 'original', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'charm', 'version', 'mostly', 'Rock', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'do', 'agree', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'action', 'star', 'Actually', 'think', 'already', 'there', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Doom', 'am', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'better', 'then', 'last', 'few', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'remember', 'Alone', 'dark', 'how', 'House', 'dead', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'solid', '3-3.5', 'enjoyacting', '3', 'stars', 'Rock', 'Knoxville', 'are', 'great', 'Scott', 'notdirecting', '2', 'stars', 'Dropped', 'ball', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'lengthspecial', 'effects', '.3', 'stars', 'Not', 'much', 'here', 'explosions', 'gunplay', 'galore.action', 'rating', '.3.5', 'stars', 'Done', 'well', '1', 'shoot-out', ""'ll"", 'know', 'one', 'trust', 'mequality', '3.5', 'stars', 'major', 'flaws', 'choppy', 'here', 'there']",Walking Tall

Besides that the movie is full of action and has that comedy appeal as well. The basics are a military guy (The Rock) comes back to his hometown after 8 years to try and get work at the local mill which was the main industry when he left. He comes back to find it closed and goes to see his parents home. He learns that the main industry now is a casino owned by his one time friend, but trouble starts when Rock finds out that the casino is crooked and so is the people who protect it.

I honestly think the movie shouldn't have been advertised with that...no movie should. It takes the fun out of them and plus this is about as realistic as a Steven Seagal movie. Although it's much better than a Steven Seagal movie though. After knocking the movie for that I can't think of any other way that it's actually bad.The Rock shines in a more serious role for him although he  still kicks ass and has fun in the role. His character  is a new sheriff who walks around with a big club to try and take control of the town he once grew up in. Helping him bring order to the town and bring down criminals is his friend who..used to be a criminal. He's well played by Jonhy Knoxville surprisingly and Knoxville makes for a fun partner for the Rock. Although I liked the Rundown much more than this, I still don't think this was a bad movie.

He sees that the Lumber Plant has been shut down, and a casino has been opened up that contains sleaze, gambling, drinking, strippers, and fixed games. Chris Vaughn lashes out at a dealer because he believes that he was screwed out of his money by the dirty Dealer, so he fights.

825495,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B000274T94,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello out there & welcome to this, this is another review where I review a movie that came out 20 years ago or 10 years ago this is 2004 in film The Walking Tall remake. This 1 of The Rocks's best movie imo. I'd love to get the original trilogy & the 2 sequels to this movie. Anyway Walking Tall was made for $56 million & made $15 million it's opening weekend. Made $35 million in it's full US run so it did tank in The US it did make $57 million it in it's full run worldwide. It got bad reviews from the critics which I don't understand I guess they wanted the movie to sit & ponder what the meaning of life is it wasn't pretentious like Faster with The Rock. The movie was directed by Kevin Bray he had no credibility going into this movie he was more of a music video director which I am surprised that he did as good as a job as he did. It stars The Rock as Chris Vaughn, Neal McDonough as Jay Hamilton, Johnny Knoxville as Ray Templeton & Ashley Scott as Deni. The movie starts off with this guy named Chris Vaughn who has returned home to Kitsap Washington this small town he's returned home from The Army Special Forces the town has changed drugs are rampant there's a Casino ran by a shady character named Jay Hamilton & the factory that Chris's Dad worked at has been shut down do to The Casino. Chris meets up with an old friend named Ray Templeton who has tried & failed to become a musician in Seattle he got caught up in drugs & ended up serving time they go & meet up with more old friends & Jay Hamilton shows up who Chris knew at 1 time he shows up with a group of cronies who work at The Casino. Chris notices his Nephew Pete along with his friends he's smoking pot with them. Hamilton invites Chris & his friends at The Casino. They go to it Chris goes into this booth where he sees this woman he used to be friends with named Deni who works at The Casino. Chris also notices at the dice have been loaded where no 1 can win. Allhe  l  l breaks loose in The Casino The Rock beats up some of these guys but he ends up being overpowered & is knocked out this man named Booth takes a razor blade & slices up Chris's chest to send a message. He spends time healing after the beating & torture Vaughn is working in the yard 1 day Hamilton shows up to try to smooth things over he tells him oh his men just went nuts they deal with people all the time. He tells him he's lucky he's still alive cause he tore up The Casino. He tells him that he will make Vaughn the head of The Casino Vaughn wants nothing to do with it. Vaughn goes to The Sheriff to press charges he tells him there was already an investigation & he's luck that he's still alive & The Casino makes money for the town he's asked if he knows what a No Fly Zone is that's what The Casino is Vaughn's Nephew Pete nearly overdoses on some crank Pete's friends tell Vaughn that the men from The Casino gave them the drugs. Vaughn's Mom & Dad tell him not to take the law into his own hands he gets his Shotgun he is told to let The Police handle it but he knows he they won't do anything he takes a make shift bat he made out of a plank of wood he goes into The Casino & cleans house he even takes the bat breaks a guys arm with it. He messes Hamilton's cronies & the place up good then he throws the bat at this window & smashes it he has a brief face to face with Hamiltion who says ""I guess this changes are relationship."" He is stopped by police he stands trial where his Lawyer wants him to take a plea deal. So when his Lawyer about to make his arguments Vaughn fires him makes his own statement. He tells everyone that he was justified in what he did cause they gave minor's drugs The Judge tells him that has nothing to do with this trial. Vaughn says ""I grew up in this town, people used to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't have traded mill for a crooked Casino & they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids."" He tells The Jury that if he's acquitted then he will run for Sheriff & end all this corruption & make sure that what happened to him won't happen to anyone else. He shows his scars from the beating he took. He is found not guilty he beat The Sheriff in the election fires the entire department. He brings Ray Templeton in as his Deputy. So really it's just them. They go after Booth where they find drugs on him then Ray has Booth's truck scrapped. This scene was fun & The Rock & Johnny Knoxville have a decent back & forth. Vaughn warns his Dad that they might be coming for them his Dad wants none of it. Vaughn has Ray watch his Parents House he stays at The Department to watch Booth Deni shows up she tells him she quit her job at The Casino she bring him some food plus they get it on. Hamilton has Vaughn's Truck blown up & the old Sheriff & his Deputies that were fired attack The Sheriff's Department. Deni helps out by firing warning shots when 1 of the attackers are coming after him. Booth tells Vaughn that Hamilton is using the old Mill to make the drugs.  Booth is killed all the gunfire that's going on. Vaughn eventually kills the attackers meanwhile Vaughn's House his Parents are being held hostage along with Vaughn's Sister & Pete. Ray does what he can to fend off the attackers he frees Vaughn's Family when Vaughn gets home Ray's beating up 1 of the intruders Vaughn pulls him off of him. You have 1 of Hamilton's men named Burke hold them at gun point they're saved by Vaughn's Father he shoots Burke with a Shotgun. Vaughn heads off after Hamilton at The Old Mill. Hamilton tries to have Vaughn fall to his death using a trap door but he hangs on Hamilton repeatedly hits Vaughn with a piece of steel Vaughn manages to grab a hold of Hamilton they both fall through a chute. Vaughn injures his leg he runs off to a near by forest Hamilton takes an ax & goes after him they battle it out Vaughn manages to grab a hold of a Tree Limb beats Hamilton within an inch of his life he tells him ""This is my town. You're under arrest. It shows later on where Vaughn & Deputy Templeton have closed down The Casino Hamilton is in Prison & The Mill is opened up again they go to pick up Vaughn's Dad to go out for lunch & that's pretty much the movie. Walking Tall is pretty solid it was fast paced I care about these characters & while there was some shaky came it wasn't annoying I could see what was going on. Kevin Bray did a good job. The Rock was great. Neal McDonough is usually a really bad actor but he's pretty good in this movie granted he has some bad acting moments in the movie but overall he's fine in this movie. Johnny Knoxville was good. Ashley Scott did a pretty good job. If you see this in let's say the $7.88 bin at Wal Mart or $5 DVD bin go ahead & pick it up it's not a long movie at all at only 1 hour & 26 minutes. Next will be 2004 in film The Punisher which I am looking forward to reviewing.",4,2004 in film Walking Tall 8.5/10,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,6857,"['Hello', 'there', 'welcome', 'review', 'where',

The original takes place in Tennessee and the remake in the state of Washington.  In the original story the hero is a former wrestler named Buford Pusser and in the remake the hero is a retired Army Special Forces sergeant.  However, the premise is the same as a once peaceful small town has now turned into a sweltering spot for crime and corruption and one man decides to stand up for the town and cleanse the town of its corrupt elements.The story is loosely adapted from a true story into an action packed adventure about a young man, Chris Vaughn (The Rock), returning after having been discharged from the army.  Chris wants to find a job in the old mill, but to his disappointment he finds out that the mill has been shut down since he left his small town to join the military.  It also disappoints him that the town has turned into a corrupt haven for criminals and thugs where ordinary people have to fear for their lives and see their children being lead into drugs and lives of crime.  When Chris finds himself cornered and his family threatened he decides that the line has been crossed and he takes the matter into his own hands in order to find a stop to the nonsense.Walking Tall is, as mentioned, a remake of the original film, but it also becomes a copy of other similar films such as First Blood, Commando, Hunted, and other films where one man fights the rights of others.  The Rock's presence is without a doubt very charismatic, however, it does not save the film.  As the story unfolds the moral message disappears in a mauling of violence and action sequences where machine guns are fired and axes are swung.  This leads the film into a fall instead of standing tall.",2,Charismatic Rock does not save the fall of Walking Tall...,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1803,"['Walking', 'Tall', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'name', '1973', 'was', 'directed', 'Phil', 'Karlson', 'original', 'place', 'Tennessee', 'remake', 'state', 'Washington', 'original', 'story', 'hero', 'former', 'wrestler', 'named', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'remake', 'hero', 'retired', 'Army', 'Special', 'Forces', 'sergeant', 'However', 'premise', 'same', 'once', 'peaceful', 'small', 'town', 'now', 'turned', 'sweltering', 'spot', 'crime', 'corruption', 'one', 'man', 'stand', 'up', 'town', 'cleanse', 'town', 'corrupt', 'elements.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'true', 'story', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'young', 'man', 'Chris', 'Vaughn', 'Rock', 'returning', 'having', 'been', 'discharged', 'army', 'Chris', 'find', 'job', 'old', 'mill', 'disappointment', 'out', 'mill', 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'left', 'small', 'town', 'join', 'military', 'also', 'town', 'turned', 'corrupt', 'haven', 'criminals', 'thugs', 'where', 'ordinary', 'people', 'have', 'fear', 'lives', 'see', 'children', 'being', 'lead', 'drugs', 'lives', 'crime', 'When', 'Chris', 'cornered', 'family', 'threatened', 'line', 'been', 'crossed', 'matter', 'own', 'hands', 'order', 'find', 'stop', 'nonsense.Walking', 'Tall', 'mentioned', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'copy', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'First', 'Blood', 'Commando', 'Hunted', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'one', 'man', 'rights', 'others', 'Rock', 'presence', 'doubt', 'very', 'charismatic', 'however', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'story', 'moral', 'message', 'mauling', 'violence', 'action', 'sequences', 'where', 'machine', 'guns', 'are', 'fired', 'axes', 'are', 'swung', 'film', 'fall', 'instead', 'standing', 'tall']",Walking Tall

WWE Films however played very little role in the making of this movie. The Rock and MGM Studios put on a very entertaining movie full of action and emotion.Chris Vaughn, played by The Rock, returns home from the Special Forces. He soon found out that his home sweet home isn't the same place he left. It is a world filled with drugs. The drugs come from a casino owned by Chris's friend, Jay Hamilton.Chris goes out with his friends to the casino to have a good time. He soon becomes agitated to find out that they are using loaded dice to screw people out of their money. The Rock, being the man that he is, takes exception to this and begins to tear the Casino to pieces in a brawl with security. Chris gets caught though and is taking to be brutally torn apart by them in a back room. They throw him out in the street for dead.Luckily, The Rock lives and seeks vengeance. He soon becomes the sheriff and begins working on fixing the town. He quickly recruits one of his best friend's, Ray, to be his only officer. Ray is played by Johnny Knoxville and he does a great job of bringing a comical sense to this movie. It creates a good balance.Chris's weapon of choice is a large piece of Cedar. That's right, he uses a huge piece of wood to put the hurt on people. This leads to some great action scenes. They use guns later on in the movie, but the scenes with the cedar are much better.I would suggest this DVD to anyone. There are two extra commentaries worth listening to. One is by The Rock and the other is by the Director and Crew. Both of them are worth listening to.

I never saw the original or its sequels, fearing the films would be loaded with gratutitous violence for no good purpose other than bloodletting. This one sure is.I realize there was really a Buford Pusser and he set out to clean up the debauchery and degradation of a small town. However, that is no justification for what goes on in this film.Our ""hero"", The Rock (AKA Darrell Johnson who admitted to using liposuction as part of his process to get a great build) comes home and is almost immediately put off by the debauchery and drug dealing going on in his community.He tries to affect this and gets beat up for it. When he recovers he commits about 20 felonies, then goes on trial, saying he did it for revenge, and if the townsfolk on the jury would acquit him he'd run for sheriff and clean up the despicable place.Guess what? They acquit him! Then he commits more felonies in the name of the sheriff -- with his ridiculous deputy helping out -- by denying an arrestee either a phone call or legal representation and tearing apart his personal property in a so-called ""search"" for drugs.This is followed by the beauty going over to his side and the bad guys attacking him with automatic weapons. They shoot a lot but miss him all the time.How can anyone suggest this is good and worthy filmmaking when the hero is more of an antihero than Dirty Harry ever was? I thought this movie was so ridiculous it made ""Death Wish 5"" look like a masterpiece.And I pity anyone that forked over $7 to see this at the theatre.

825503,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000274T94,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 7]","I never did see any of the original ""Walking Tall"" movies, although I understood what they were about.  Actually, I avoided most of the vigilante justice movies (e.g., ""Death Wish"" and most Charles Bronson movies) and have long had a problem with movies that justify vigilante violence by setting up a situation where the law cannot or will not provide justice and the hero is left with no recourse but to take matters into their own hands.  This remake of ""Walking Tall"" certainly fits the mold, with the setting being an isolated mill town where corruption runs wild and no one from the outside world, such as the state police or the FBI, would ever think of coming in to clean things up (think of it as a sort of bizarro Shangri-La).Instead of the legendary Bufford Pusser this time we have the Rock as Chris Vaughn, a Special Forces war hero who returns to his home in the great forests of Washington to find the old mill has closed and his old high school nemesis Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) has opened up a casino where the games are crooked, there are drugs to be bought, and the local sheriff and his men are just more paid muscle.  Hamilton treats Vaughn and his friends to a night at the casino, which ends up with our hero trying to beat up all of the security thugs.  But since it is early in the film there are too many of them and they not only take Vaughn down, one of them decides to start carving up our hero.This particular scene ends up being the fatal flaw in this movie.  We are not exactly sure what this guy is doing to Vaughn until a key moment in his trial.  There is a trial because since the police will not do anything about what happened to him our hero decides to take matters into his own hands.  Actually in his hands he has a 2 x 4, having rejected a shotgun for a more personal touch.  Vaughn is put on trial and in a scene that saves 15-30 minutes of story development ends up defending himself, ripping open his shirt, and getting elected sheriff, all in the course of about two minutes.  The problem is that the brutal violence of having sliced up Vaughn's chest is at odds with the rather cartoonish violence of the rest of the film.  Within the context of the revenge genre film you would expect the man who carved up Vaughn to pay for his dirty deed in some significant way, but he pretty much goes out with a whimper.In one of the special features on the DVD we learn that the point of this remake was not so much to honor the life of Bufford Pusser but to make a film where the action (read violence) is back to basics.  No wire work with people flying through the air, but your basic guy with a 2 x 4 beating up on people; and not just any 2 x 4, but one with a specially made handle so you can really put your weight into it.  Now, I have no problem with this approach and director Kevin Bray certainly sets up some entertaining fights along these lines.  But they seem somewhat inappropriate given the set up with the chest cutting, as does the film's humor.The Rock is certainly an engaging action star with a likeability that I usually do not find in this genre.  He has a nice sense of humor that works in several scenes throughout ""Walking Tall,"" although, again, the idea that you can have a comic scene of Vaughn recooperating from having his chest cut to ribbons strikes me at least extremely odd if not outright wrong.  The other surprising performance in the film is from Johnny Knoxville of ""Jackass"" fame who plays Vaughn's old high school pal Ray Templeton, who becomes one of the deputies to the new sheriff; the fact Ray has a felony drug conviction is no barrier to employment as Vaughn fights fire with fire.

I was frankly amazed that anyone could produce a movie as bad as this one and still posess the mental facilities to feed and clothe themselves. Maybe someone else does it for them... like at an institution or something.The first 1/3 of the movie involves the Rock meeting old friends and everyone fake laughing and smiling while they hug and pretend to love each other. Then it gets dumb.The trailers make this movie look like it has some sort of coherant plot and rising action. Trailers lie. The legal basis for everything that happened is the movie was a hilariously childish view of justice. You can't be aquitted of a crime (brutal premeditated assault) simply because the target ""deserved it"".All of the plot turns are boring and hilariously cliche. I wouldn't care, seeing as it's supposedly an ""action"" movie of some sort; however, said action was conpicuously absent from the film. What you get instead is watered down, silly clips of grown men pawing at each other; and a few gun-driven scenes that might be vaugely cool if they situation and dialogue surrounding them weren't so hilariously retarded.The romance follows the basic ""woman brings man leftovers, woman and man have intercourse"" formula. I guess she was attractive, in a promiscuous way.Nothing that is intended as humor in the movie is even remotely funny.If you want to laugh at a horribly, profoundly silly and stupid movie, this isn't a bad shot.

825516,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000274T94,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","Walking Tall is a remake of the 1973 film, which is in turn a ""semi-biopic"" of Sheriff Buford Pusser.  Ironically enough, Pusser was a former professional wrestler-turned lawman in McNairy County, Tennessee.  For those of you keeping track, the Buford Pusser was renamed to Chris Vaughn (in the world of macho movies, this is understandable) and his background was changed from wrestling to Special Forces.  Which is funny, because Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who plays the role of Vaughn, is a former professional wrestler turned actor.In this action movie, Vaughn returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington (instead of Pusser's actual McNairy County, Tennessee) from a stint in the Special Forces.  We're not sure what Vaughn did, but it must have been ugly, because he never speaks about it and answers questions about people he killed with a sad stare.  Unfortunately, Kitsap County has gone downhill since the local lumber mill closed.  His father, Vaughn Sr. (John Beasley) is out of work.  Vaughn's sister Michelle (Kristen Wilson) has become a cop, but her son Pete (Khleo Thomas) hangs out with the wrong crowd. Heck, even Vaughn's old girlfriend Deni (Ashley Scott) has become a stripper.  All these sins can be blamed on Vaughn's old high school rival, Jay Hamilton (played with sneering arrogance by Neal McDonough).Vaughn's return is cause for celebration by his friends, including the recovering alcoholic Ray (Johnny Knoxville, of all people), who treat him to a night of gambling and debauchery at Hamilton's premiere casino.  But the whole place is dirty, where gamblers cheat and drugs are given to kids.  It's at this point that Walking Tall flirts with cartoonish levels of evil.  Even Hamilton points this out: ""Why would I sell drugs when I own the entire town already?"" Why indeed?Vaughn goes nuts once he discovers that the place is corrupt, and his fisticuffs earn him a form of vicious revenge from the security staff that involves a box cutter and a lot of cutaway scenes of Vaughn screaming.  Left to die, he manages to recover on his parents' sofa.  The sheriff (Michael Bowen) and his deputies are obviously in Hamilton's pocket and refuse to help. When Vaughn's nephew overdoses on drugs gained from Hamilton's casino, Vaughn's had enough: he takes a four-foot hickory club and smashes the place up.  That's just the first half of the movie.Returning to reality, Vaughn's outburst causes him to be brought up on several charges, brought by the very people who cut him up the first time.  Vaughn wins the case by appealing to squeamishness of the jury, who wince once he shows them the scars from the box cutter.  ""If you acquit me of these charges, I'll run for sheriff!"" he shouts.  And they do.  And he does. What happens next is a good old-fashioned butt-whupping from a big man with a big stick.I didn't expect much from an action movie headlined by a wrestler, but Walking Tall distinguishes itself in several ways that make it worth watching:IT'S MULTIETHNIC: Vaughn's father is black, his mother is white; Vaughn's girlfriend is white. The movie doesn't make a big deal about it.IT KNOWS ITS LIMITATIONS: The Rock is huge.  This obvious fact is used against Vaughn when he's on trial, as the poor, beat-up thugs make him out to be a monster.  And he sort of is...he's just a monster you want on your side. Ray is both pathetic and amusing, but mostly pathetic, as only Knoxville can play him.IT UNABASHEDLY LOVES ACTION: This movie is about good guys beating up bad guys.  Although Vaughn's Special Forces training is curiously absent from most of the film, he does get into fistfights and gunfights with everybody. The fighting is fast and furious but never overtly cinematic.  There are lots of thuds, grunts, and crunches.I like The Rock.  He's handsome and sleek in a way that other muscle-bound stars are not, conveying both strength and speed.  He doesn't come off as a brutal thug by just looking at him, unless he's standing next to someone else.  And because Johnson is famous for arching his eyebrow in ironic ""am I for real or what?"" pose, he's able to pull off comedy by standing next to someone considerably smaller, like Knoxville.Walking Tall has both heart and muscle, a feel-good tale about a tough guy who stands up for his hometown in an era when nobody seems to be standing up for anything anymore.",4,...And Carry a Big Stick,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,4365,"['Walking', 'Tall', 'remake', '1973', 'film', 'turn', 'semi-biopic', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'Pusser', 'was', 'former', 'professional', 'wrestler-turned', 'lawman', 'McNairy', 'County', 'Tennessee', 'keeping', 'track', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'was', 'renamed', 'Chris', 'Vaughn', 'world', 'macho', 'movies', 'understandable', 'background', 'was', 'changed', 'wrestling', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Which', 'funny', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'who', 'role', 'Vaughn', 'former', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'turned', 'actor.In', 'action', 'movie', 'Vaughn', 'hometown', 'Kitsap', 'County', 'Washington', 'instead', 'Pusser', 'actual', 'McNairy', 'County', 'Tennessee', 'stint', 'Special', 'Forces', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Vaughn', 'did', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'ugly', 'never', 'answers', 'questions', 'people', 'killed', 'sad', 'stare', 'Unfortunately', 'Kitsap', 'County', 'gone', 'downhill', 'local', 'lumber', 'mill', 'closed', 'father', 'Vaughn', 'Sr.', 'John', 'Beasley', 'work', 'Vaughn', 'sister', 'Michelle', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'become', 'cop', 'son', 'Pete', 'Khleo', 'Thomas', 'out', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'Heck', 'even', 'Vaughn', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Deni', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'become', 'stripper', 'sins', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'Vaughn', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'rival', 'Jay', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'sneering', 'arrogance', 'Neal', 'McDonough', '.Vaughn', 'return', 'cause', 'celebration', 'friends', 'including', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'Ray', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'people', 'who', 'treat', 'night', 'gambling', 'debauchery', 'Hamilton', 'premiere', 'casino', 'whole', 'place', 'dirty', 'where', 'gamblers', 'cheat', 'drugs', 'are', 'given', 'kids', 'point', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'flirts', 'cartoonish', 'levels', 'evil', 'Even', 'Hamilton', 'points', 'out', 'Why', 'would', 'sell', 'drugs', 'when', 'own', 'entire', 'town', 'already', 'Why', 'indeed', 'Vaughn', 'nuts', 'once', 'place', 'corrupt', 'fisticuffs', 'earn', 'form', 'vicious', 'revenge', 'security', 'staff', 'box', 'cutter', 'lot', 'cutaway', 'scenes', 'Vaughn', 'screaming', 'Left', 'die', 'recover', 'parents', 'sofa', 'sheriff', 'Michael', 'Bowen', 'deputies', 'are', 'obviously', 'Hamilton', 'pocket', 'refuse', 'help', 'When', 'Vaughn', 'nephew', 'overdoses', 'drugs', 'gained', 'Hamilton', 'casino', 'Vaughn', 'had', 'enough', 'four-foot', 'hickory', 'club', 'place', 'up', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'movie.Returning', 'reality', 'Vaughn', 'outburst', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'several', 'charges', 'brought', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'cut', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Vaughn', 'case', 'appealing', 'squeamishness', 'jury', 'who', 'wince', 'once', 'scars', 'box', 'cutter', 'acquit', 'charges', ""'ll"", 'run', 'sheriff', 'do', 'What', 'next', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'butt-whupping', 'big', 'man', 'big', 'stick.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'action', 'movie', 'headlined', 'wrestler', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'several', 'ways', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'IT', 'MULTIETHNIC', 'Vaughn', 'father', 'black', 'mother', 'white', 'Vaughn', 'girlfriend', 'white', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'it.IT', 'KNOWS', 'ITS', 'LIMITATIONS', 'Rock', 'huge', 'obvious', 'fact', 'used', 'Vaughn', 'when', 'trial', 'poor', 'beat-up', 'thugs', 'make', 'be', 'monster', 'sort', 'just', 'monster', 'want', 'side', 'Ray', 'pathetic', 'amusing', 'mostly', 'pathetic', 'only', 'Knoxville', 'can', 'play', 'him.IT', 'UNABASHEDLY', 'LOVES', 'ACTION', 'movie', 'about', 'good', 'guys', 'beating', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'Vaughn', 'Special', 'Forces', 'training', 'curiously', 'absent', 'most', 'film', 'get', 'fistfights', 'gunfights', 'everybody', 'fighting', 'fast', 'furious', 'never', 'overtly', 'cinematic', 'are', 'lots', 'thuds', 'grunts', 'crunches.I', 'Rock', 'handsome', 'sleek', 'way', 'other', 'muscle-bound', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'conveying', 'strength', 'speed', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'brutal', 'thug', 'just', 'looking', 'standing', 'next', 'someone', 'else', 'Johnson', 'famous', 'arching', 'eyebrow', 'ironic', 'am', 'real', 'what', 'pose', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'comedy', 'standing', 'next', 'someone', 'considerably', 'smaller', 'Knoxville.Walking', 'Tall', 'heart', 'muscle', 'feel-good', 'tale', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'hometown', 'era', 'when', 'nobody', 'be', 'standing', 'up', 'anything', 'anymore']",Walking Tall

Well, you won't get emotion filled, but with this movie you certaintly will get ""brand new"" and ""action packed"". This movie is getting slammed by critics because it is overly violent (yet ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets great reviews), and I feel that is unjust, because that could direct movie goers away, when this movie should make big money...because it deserves to.While I'm not saying the movie isn't violent, because it sure as hell is and I sometimes questioned what kept it from getting slammed with an R-Rating, the violence is quite tame when compared to other movies. The Rock pics up some wood and goes into a casion and smacks the crap out of everyone. However, the camera always cuts to the person's back or another part of his body so you can't see the effect. So, you might want to keep this movies away from the 2-year olds, but I know I watched movies like this when I was 5 and I turned out OK.Also, the movie has humor. I wouldn't call it an action comedy like the Rock's last movie, ""The Rundown"" was, because there isn't THAT much humor. Most of the humor is supplied by Jackass Johnny Knoxville, who steals every scene he's in. I'm a big fan of Jackass and have been p*ssed ever since it got cancelled, but it gave Knoxville more time to do what he's always wanted to do: act.

825541,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000274T94,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","As society in general became progressively more liberal in the 1970's, an entire genre of films rose up in reaction to the trend - movies in which an individual, frustrated with a legal system that seemed to be coddling criminals, took it upon himself to mete out his own brand of ""frontier justice,"" usually involving personal vengeance and vigilante-style violence.  The seminal films of this genre - ""Billy Jack,"" ""Dirty Harry,"" ""Death Wish"" and ""Walking Tall"" - all found favor with mass audiences, although critics tended to dismiss them as, at best, reactionary, and, at worst, neo-fascist in nature.  Now, one of them, ""Walking Tall,"" has been retrofitted to cater to audiences in the already far more conservative 21st Century.The original 1973 ""Walking Tall"" was based on the true story of Buford Pusser, the sheriff of McNairy County, Tennessee, who won fame by single-handedly wiping out the criminal elements who had overrun his town.  It was a one-man ""crusade for justice"" that came at great personal cost to himself and his family (his wife was murdered and Pusser died a few years later in a ""mysterious"" car accident).  In this new version - which eliminates most of the grittier elements of the story and turns it into a rock'em-sock'em, live-action cartoon - Pusser`s name has been changed to Chris Vaughn and the locale has been moved from the Appalachians to the Pacific Northwest.  Chris is a recently discharged soldier who, upon returning to his small hometown, discovers that the place has become a hotbed of vice and corruption, its citizenry forced to live in fear under the tyrannical control of the local casino owner and all-around meanie, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough).  When Chris has finally had a bellyful of malfeasance and sleaze, he decides to run for sheriff, vowing to bring the criminals to their knees, and thus allowing the good folks of the town to reclaim their community.This is a silly and shallow film whose only real purpose seems to be to give the perpetually self-righteous and outraged Vaughn an excuse to hurl endless bric-a-brac and breakaway furniture around the set while the local townsfolk look on in slack-jawed amazement.  Never one to be deterred by such quaint and fusty notions as civil liberties or Miranda rights, Sheriff Vaughn chases down the bad guys one by one, smashing heads and busting bones as he goes.  The plot is so underdeveloped that the final confrontation scene between Chris and his arch nemesis, Hamilton, feels like a mere afterthought.  The film runs barely 75 minutes, yet boasts a 10-minute long closing credit sequence to pad it out to 85!  It's as if even the filmmakers themselves had run out of interest in the project  and figured they might as well just wrap things up as quickly as possible so they would be free to move on to bigger and better things.Usually, in a film based on true life events, when the names are changed, it's to protect the innocent.  In the case of ""Walking Tall,"" it's more likely that the people who made the film were trying to protect themselves from being sued by the Pusser estate.",2,"empty, halfhearted remake",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3102,"['society', 'general', 'became', 'progressively', 'more', 'liberal', '1970', 'entire', 'genre', 'films', 'rose', 'up', 'reaction', 'trend', 'movies', 'individual', 'frustrated', 'legal', 'system', 'seemed', 'be', 'coddling', 'criminals', 'took', 'mete', 'out', 'own', 'brand', 'frontier', 'justice', 'usually', 'involving', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'vigilante-style', 'violence', 'seminal', 'films', 'genre', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'found', 'favor', 'mass', 'audiences', 'critics', 'tended', 'dismiss', 'best', 'reactionary', 'worst', 'neo-fascist', 'nature', 'Now', 'one', 'Walking', 'been', 'retrofitted', 'cater', 'audiences', 'already', 'far', 'more', 'conservative', '21st', 'Century.The', 'original', '1973', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'sheriff', 'McNairy', 'County', 'Tennessee', 'who', 'won', 'fame', 'single-handedly', 'wiping', 'out', 'criminal', 'elements', 'who', 'had', 'overrun', 'town', 'was', 'one-man', 'crusade', 'justice', 'came', 'great', 'personal', 'cost', 'family', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'Pusser', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'mysterious', 'car', 'accident', 'new', 'version', 'most', 'grittier', 'elements', 'story', ""rock'em-sock'em"", 'live-action', 'cartoon', 'Pusser', 's', 'name', 'been', 'changed', 'Chris', 'Vaughn', 'locale', 'been', 'moved', 'Appalachians', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Chris', 'recently', 'discharged', 'soldier', 'who', 'returning', 'small', 'hometown', 'discovers', 'place', 'become', 'hotbed', 'vice', 'corruption', 'citizenry', 'forced', 'live', 'fear', 'tyrannical', 'control', 'local', 'casino', 'owner', 'all-around', 'meanie', 'Jay', 'Hamilton', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'When', 'Chris', 'finally', 'had', 'bellyful', 'malfeasance', 'sleaze', 'run', 'sheriff', 'vowing', 'bring', 'criminals', 'knees', 'thus', 'allowing', 'good', 'folks', 'town', 'reclaim', 'community.This', 'silly', 'shallow', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'purpose', 'be', 'give', 'perpetually', 'self-righteous', 'outraged', 'Vaughn', 'excuse', 'hurl', 'endless', 'bric-a-brac', 'breakaway', 'furniture', 'set', 'local', 'townsfolk', 'look', 'slack-jawed', 'amazement', 'Never', 'one', 'be', 'deterred', 'such', 'quaint', 'fusty', 'notions', 'civil', 'liberties', 'Miranda', 'rights', 'Sheriff', 'Vaughn', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'one', 'smashing', 'heads', 'busting', 'bones', 'plot', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Chris', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Hamilton', 'feels', 'mere', 'afterthought', 'film', 'barely', '75', 'minutes', 'yet', '10-minute', 'long', 'closing', 'credit', 'sequence', 'pad', '85', 'even', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'run', 'out', 'interest', 'project', 'figured', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'move', 'bigger', 'better', 'things.Usually', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'events', 'when', 'names', 'are', 'changed', 'protect', 'innocent', 'case', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'more', 'likely', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'protect', 'being', 'sued', 'Pusser', 'estate']",Walking Tall
825542,AAGFBE5EM7YKB,B000274T94,Roule Duke,"[4, 16]","There is a particularly disturbing scene in Barry Blaustein's brilliant wrestling documentary ""Beyond the Mat"", which haunted me ever since I saw the film. No, it's not the messed up personal life of Jake 'the Snake' nor is it the sight of Mick Foley's children screaming in terror as he receives repeated chair shots to the head. It was Vince McMahon expressing his interest in ""making movies........."" which put the chill down my spine.Traditionally 'wrestling movies', that is wrestling themed films, have being unsuccessful at the box office and pretty terrible, the only exception being ""The One and Only"" which is a great film (possibly due to the fact that it's star isn't a wrestler). I'm a long time wrestling fan and can admit that 'sports entertainment' will never ever work as well in the cinema as it does in the tv soap opera format. The obvious logic therefore is to make films starring wrestlers, but not strictly on the subject of wrestling. Rowdy Roddy Piper scored the starring role in John Carpenter's ""They Live"", a solid cult classic by any standard, why couldn't this formula work?Enter The Rock! The most electrifying man in sports entertainment! If any wrestler had the look and charisma to carry a feature film, it is the great one. At least in theory..............""The Scorpion King""? That was so bad, it made ""Conan the Destroyer"" look like ""Conan the Barbarian""! ""The Rundown""? The brilliant script for that film manages some near impossible tasks, it makes Seann ""Stiffler"" William Scott painfully unfunny, Christopher Walken pathetic (Tooth Fairy speech!?), presents The Rock as the cliched 'hero with tragic past' type character without provide a shred of backstory (why won't he use guns?) and to top it all off in a moronic attempt to inject depth and a social conscience into the shallow garbage, it rips off a scene straight out of ""Powaqqatsi""! The action scenes are rather bad (HollyWood will never EVER come close to Asian films in action, no matter how many sellout choreographers they bribe in from Hong Kong!!!) and the film runs 15 minutes too long.So what about ""Walking Tall""? Unfortunately it's just another over-hyped horrible Hollywood remake. Is that all they do? put out terrible remakes of great films, ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""The Ring"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Planet of the Apes"" etc, etc. Haven't they already used the original ""Walking Tall""? 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan? In a recent episode of Raw, The Rock was doing Mick Foley's 'This Is Your Life' during which a ""critic"" told Rocky ""if you'd shown this much vitality, maybe 'Walking Tall' wouldn't be a walking piece of crap!"", I'm not sure why that line of dialogue was scripted, simply because it is a dead right observation! Of course this won't stop J.R.'s endless plugging, how many wrestlers have being ""walking tall"" on their way to the squared circle lately?I want The Rock to succeed, sincerely want his films to be good, he's one of my favorite wrestlers along with Mysterio and Flair. The Rock on the mike is brilliant, in fact better than brilliant, he's electrifying! The Rock on talk shows is charming, funny and totally entertaining. So why is the magic missing from every film he's in?The answer is simple, The Rock has a ton of charisma and personality, but sadly is not a highly skilled actor. Sure his promos are some of the tightest in sports entertainment, but outside The Rock persona, he doesn't have much of a range. This is in no way a mean spirited insult, just the honest truth. But many of the most respected actors play only one character repeatedly, Robert DeNiro for example. So what is wrong with letting The Rock play the Rock? Why force him into stiff uncomfortable cliched hero roles? Why not make a movie, or better yet a series of movies, in the James Bond style with The Rock as a secret agent putting the smackdown of the bad guys and getting a Bond sized share of pie along the way? A series of ""Shaft"" style films with The Rock jive talking the jabroni's and swinging with allot of groovy pie in the process? There is no reason why The Rock 'as is' cannot be placed in any number of films. That would be giving fans what they want, lets face it, most of the audience who went to see the films so far didn't go because the plot interested them, they went to see The Rock, I went to see The Rock.Real wrestling fans should avoid these movies, don't give them your money because if they are successful The Rock will continue to be cast in pure crap like ""Walking Tall"", rather than either

825550,A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ,B000274T94,the-gr8shag,"[2, 2]","The Rock returns in his latest action film, ""Walking Tall"", that's supposedly based on true events, but, isn't (names, events, and places have been changed, so, what's so true about it?). Its also a remake of the original ""Walking Tall"" (that starred Joe Don Baker as Sheriff Buford Pusser and THAT film was based on true events). ""Walking Tall"" is an easy enough timepasser and overall decent film that, hopefully, will encourage fans of ""The Great One"" to be curious enough to check out the original ""Walking Tall"".The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn, a retired member of the Special Forces, returning home to be with his family and settle down. But upon his return, Chris finds out that his hometown has changed quite a bit since he left. Drugs have been rampantly sold throughout town, the mill has been closed for five years, unemployment is way up, and the only true moneymaker in town is a casino owned & operated by an old highschool football buddy of Vaughn's, who is crooked as he is corrupt & runs the town with an iron fist. After a gruesome fight at the casino & an even worse beating at the hands of the casino's henchmen, Chris Vaughn won't stand for anymore of the town's monkey crap and before you can say, ""You smell what ""The Rock"" is cookin'?"",  Vaughn runs for election of the town's sheriff (he, of course, wins the position), walks tall and carries a big stick and proceeds to lay the smacketh down on all who have destroyed the town & attempt to bring him and his family down.The outcome is pretty predictable. I like The Rock in his movies, but, it's the movies themselves that I have a hard time with. With this one it seems everything happened rather quickly (especially when he wins the job as the towns sheriff. Did anyone vote? Couldn't there have been a small subplot dealing with the original sheriff not willing to give up the position so easily or tainted ballots?). The film seems a bit rushed with no real character devlopment between any of the characters (whats the origin of Chris' relationship with Danni, why did Chris originally hangout with Johnny Knoxville's character, whats the real reason why Chris' father won't pick up a gun ever again, etc.). The film screen time can't be more than 80 minutes (I attended the 7:10 pm screening and I was out by 20 minutes to nine (that included, at least, 10 minutes of previews). That makes ""Walking Tall"" the shortest film since ""Men in Black II""!)The plus side is the characters are likable enough to enjoy. Knoxville gives his best performance to date as Vaughn's, Deputy giving the film some great, funny moments (especially the truck chopping sequence. That was awesome!). The Rock is cool as Chris. He comes off likable as  ""The Average Joe"" trying to make his way in life. The fight scenes are down to earth (no ""Matrix"" style slap fighting, or homo, slomo, ""bullit-time"" action, either). The beginning to ""Walking Tall"" is an homage to ""First Blood"" (the first ""Rambo"" film), from the Northern Mid-West Town the film takes place in, to Chris Vaughn walking the road into town. When the Sheriff's car pulls up to greet Vaughn I was almost expecting Sheriff Teasle to step out of the car and arrest him for vagrancy (the charge that got Rambo arrested for).""Walking Tall"" is a decent film to watch and is an easy enough timepasser.

825552,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000274T94,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","With 'Rundown,' The Rock proved he would be the action star of the next generation, and though 'Walking Tall' is not as good as the predecessor, it is still an enjoyable action film with bone-crunching fights and big shoot-outs.  Don't expect something original here -- director Kevin Bray ('All About the Benjamins') did only a pedestrian job -- but the charisma of The Rock is presented intact, even when he is in an obligatory love scene with Ashley Scott.The story is a standard one, like you have seen thousand times in good, old Western movies.  The Rock is Chris Vaughn, war hero coming back to his quiet hometown near the mountains.  There the old lumber mill where his father worked has been closed, and a big casino run by Chris' old friend has become the economic center of the place.Now read 'the casino' as 'the bar,' and 'his old friend' as 'his nemesis.'  Add to them 'corrupt cops' and 'a sidekick/comic relief' (played by Johnny Knoxville).  The film's script is made with pieces from the old traditional Western films, and like these Western someone must right the wrongs.  And it's The Rock, who does it with a piece of cider, and later an oak bat.Though the actions are decent, and the last 20 minutes of the film are full of them, 'Walking Tall' takes some time to build up the tension before them, and you may find that preliminary part a little dull.  But The Rock, even when he is not doing actions, is always watchable, brief conversations with Chris' troublemaking nephew, or comical dialogues with Knoxville.They say, 'Walking Tall' is a remake of the trilogy based on the real-life incidents of Sheriff Buford Pusser.  Let's forget that.  With The Rock as the star, this MGM re-make wisely avoids the Charles Bronson-type violent revenge scenario, and opts for less blood-soaked, more cartoonish actions.  For all its claim saying 'Based on the True Story,' 'Walking Tall' is never about Sheriff Pusser.  It is about The Rock, who again showed his action star quality here, despite the film's generic story.",3,"The Rock Is Fine, But the Story Is Too Old-Fashioned",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,2035,"[""'Rundown"", 'Rock', 'proved', 'would', 'be', 'action', 'star', 'next', 'generation', ""'Walking"", 'Tall', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'film', 'bone-crunching', 'fights', 'big', 'shoot-outs', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'original', 'here', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Bray', ""'All"", 'Benjamins', 'did', 'only', 'pedestrian', 'job', 'charisma', 'Rock', 'presented', 'intact', 'even', 'when', 'obligatory', 'love', 'scene', 'Ashley', 'Scott.The', 'story', 'standard', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'good', 'old', 'Western', 'movies', 'Rock', 'Chris', 'Vaughn', 'war', 'hero', 'coming', 'back', 'quiet', 'hometown', 'mountains', 'old', 'lumber', 'mill', 'where', 'father', 'worked', 'been', 'closed', 'big', 'casino', 'run', 'Chris', 'old', 'friend', 'become', 'economic', 'center', 'place.Now', 'read', ""'the"", 'casino', ""'the"", 'bar', 'old', 'friend', ""'his"", 'nemesis', 'Add', ""'corrupt"", 'cops', 'sidekick/comic', 'relief', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'film', 'script', 'made', 'pieces', 'old', 'traditional', 'Western', 'films', 'Western', 'someone', 'must', 'right', 'wrongs', 'Rock', 'who', 'piece', 'cider', 'later', 'oak', 'actions', 'are', 'decent', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'full', ""'Walking"", 'Tall', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'may', 'find', 'preliminary', 'part', 'little', 'dull', 'Rock', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'actions', 'always', 'watchable', 'brief', 'conversations', 'Chris', 'troublemaking', 'nephew', 'comical', 'dialogues', 'Knoxville.They', 'say', ""'Walking"", 'Tall', 'remake', 'trilogy', 'based', 'real-life', 'incidents', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'Let', 'forget', 'Rock', 'star', 'MGM', 're-make', 'wisely', 'Charles', 'Bronson-type', 'violent', 'revenge', 'scenario', 'opts', 'less', 'blood-soaked', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'actions', 'claim', 'saying', ""'Based"", 'True', 'Story', ""'Walking"", 'Tall', 'never', 'Sheriff', 'Pusser', 'Rock', 'who', 'again', 'showed', 'action', 'star', 'quality', 'here', 'film', 'generic', 'story']",Walking Tall

In typical macho bravado this movie contains more fight scenes than dialogue but at least the fight scenes are worth the wait. The Rock is definitely not someone any normal person would mess with! But playing his nemesis effectively is Neal McDonough who has the act of evil down pat. The story is pretty basic but interesting enough to sustain a film that only lasts 75 minutes. Humor is inflected throughout this movie by the incomparable Johnny Knoxville who plays a bumbling deputy trying to live up to The Rock's ability in a physical sense.Overall if you like action movies this is a decent bit of entertainment.
