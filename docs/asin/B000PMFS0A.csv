It is a two disc set (so each movie comes on its own disc).Possible Spoilers:Teen Witch--starring Robyn Lively and Zelda Rubinstein. Louise (Lively) has a huge crush on the most popular boy in school; of course, he doesn't even know she exists. On her 16th birthday she gets the surprise of her life--she is told by a local witch (Rubinstein) that she is actually a descendent of the Salem witches and will now receive her powers. Can she get her crush to love the real her, or will he, like every other guy, just fall under her spell? This double sided disc contains both full screen and widescreen presentations of the film. Extras: Theatrical Trailer.The Heavenly Kid--starring Jason Gedrick, Lewis Smith, and Jane Kaczmarek. Lenny Barnes (Gedrick) is a nerdy high school kid. Out of nowhere, a foul-mouthed angel Bobby Fantana (Smith) shows up to make Lenny the most popular kid in school. Lenny learns the hard way that popularity is not all it seems and Bobby has some things to learn as well. Widescreen. Extras: none.I have fond memories of both of the movies in this set. Teen Witch was a constant rental at my house and I probably watched The Heavenly Kid a dozen times on T.V. over the years.
