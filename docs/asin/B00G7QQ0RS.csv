I can't believe the History channel signed on to this horrible piece of fiction. Just about everything is wrong with this movie.  The way they met was incorrect,  They have her robbing banks as well.  As far as I have read she did go in ahead of time to scope the place out and she may have been at the wheel a few times but as for robbing that didn't happen.  They usually dropped the women at the edge of town and picked them up after the robbery.  Clyde did not meet Frank Hamer at all. He had a sixth sense at times for danger but not able to see the future.  I think his sixth sense must have been on sleep mode on that fateful day in May.  There was no female reporter that Bonnie visited. The acting was fine and the dress was good but the many inaccuracies made this movie unwatchable.  She was very badly burned and for a time Clyde thought he would lose her in the film to me it wasn't even that serious. Clyde was the leader of the gang not Bonnie. She did not shoot the law officer ""And watch his head bounce"".I don't know why they can't make an accurate movie about this pair.  The Dillinger film with J.

This entire cast of very modern, blow-dried, cyber-age actors ruined the entire production. All throughout the movie, I was expecting Bonnie and Clyde to whip out their smart phones and start texting their BFFs.Everything about their voices and mannerisms just screamed 'trendy shopping mall youngsters' and never once did they convey poverty stricken, violent, white trash gangsters.British actress Holliday Grainger as Bonnie Parker tried very hard, and she actually performed a decent southern accent, but unfortunately it wasn't a Texan accent, but more of an Alabamian or Georgian. (Trust me, there is a huge difference.) I think actress Kirsten Dunst would have made a great and much more convincing Bonnie.Emile Hirsch as Clyde Barrow just may be the worst casting of the year. I think he's talented, but this very distinct role was not meant for him, at all. (actor Lucas Black would have been much more appropriate.)Like my heading states, the Americans should learn from the British. When they make those impressive 'period' movies from various eras, they pay close attention when casting the proper actors who can successfully capture the right dialog, dialects and mannerisms. It makes a world of difference in the final product.I would give this version of Bonnie and Clyde a 2 out of 5 rating and suggest skipping it.Watch the masterful film from 1967 instead.Although the 2013 mini-series tried to be more accurate with the actual story of Bonnie and Clyde, the 1967 film is far superior in its entertainment value and realistic characters for that era.Whoever cast the 2013 version should perhaps consider a different career choice.",2,American filmmakers should learn from the British,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,2006,"['When', 'making', 'historical', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'detail', 'production', 'sets', 'clothing', 'cars', 'hairstyles', 'buildings', 'etc', 'actual', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'particular', 'version', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'fatal', 'blow', 'none', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'remotely', 'convincing', '30', 'depression', 'era', 'Americans', 'entire', 'cast', 'very', 'modern', 'blow-dried', 'cyber-age', 'actors', 'ruined', 'entire', 'production', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'whip', 'out', 'smart', 'phones', 'start', 'texting', 'BFFs.Everything', 'voices', 'mannerisms', 'just', 'screamed', ""'trendy"", 'shopping', 'mall', 'youngsters', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'convey', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'violent', 'white', 'trash', 'gangsters.British', 'actress', 'Holliday', 'Grainger', 'Bonnie', 'Parker', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'actually', 'performed', 'decent', 'southern', 'accent', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'Texan', 'accent', 'more', 'Alabamian', 'Georgian', 'Trust', 'huge', 'difference', 'think', 'actress', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'Bonnie.Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Clyde', 'Barrow', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'casting', 'year', 'think', 'talented', 'very', 'distinct', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'actor', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'heading', 'states', 'Americans', 'should', 'learn', 'British', 'When', 'make', 'impressive', 'movies', 'various', 'eras', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'when', 'casting', 'proper', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'successfully', 'capture', 'right', 'dialog', 'dialects', 'mannerisms', 'world', 'difference', 'final', 'product.I', 'would', 'give', 'version', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', '2', '5', 'rating', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'it.Watch', 'masterful', 'film', '1967', '2013', 'mini-series', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'actual', 'story', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', '1967', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'value', 'realistic', 'characters', 'era.Whoever', 'cast', '2013', 'version', 'should', 'perhaps', 'consider', 'different', 'career', 'choice']",N/A

Huge amount of voiceover -- come on, is it a film or books on tape? Ridiculous visual effects (gunfire is made by drawing a jagged white blotch in front of guns; the thing looks like media artifacts; same thing is used for bullets striking car -- apparently the car is armoured, otherwise bullets would penetrate it w/o flashes).The pair is executed by five policemen shooting REVOLVERS from quite some distance. Have you every shot a handgun? You can't hit anything more than ten metres away, pretty much. You don't shoot at a moving car from a revolver from 300 yards, you do what the old flick did: stop the car via a ruse and machine-gun it at point-blank range.Eric Roberts is a guest star; he has a three-minute role where he makes a speech (mostly) and then shoots for ten seconds from the bushes; then the movie ends. Poor Eric Roberts... my mental image of him is from Runaway Train... he got old meantime, and that's the kind of movie he appears in now.The whole thing feels like it was made by high-school students.

1677456,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00G7QQ0RS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 8]","Positioned as THE MOVIE EVENT of December, the latest incarnation of the Bonnie and Clyde legend was simultaneously broadcast on THREE major networks over a two night period. That's right, the History Channel, A&E;, and Lifetime all dedicated a massive chunk of their programming space for this handsome, if somewhat unenlightening, adaptation. With all the promotion, I had looked forward to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" for almost two months before it aired! I am a big fan of Arthur Penn's 1967 theatrical version of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. That picture netted ten Academy Award nominations and was an audacious piece of work for its time with its depiction of stylized violence and a wicked sense of humor. I thought, however, that the television format (and longer running time) might actually add insight to the criminal pairing and their exploits. Instead of opting for this approach, the two part movie chose instead to take huge liberties with the tale (an odd choice, really, considering the involvement of the History Channel) and plays by all the expected rules of a conventional TV biopic. While well produced and great looking, though, I never really emotionally connected with this version.The movie casts a couple of appealing actors in the leads. Emile Hirsch makes for an earnest Clyde Barrow and Holliday Grainger has plenty of sass as the fame loving Bonnie Parker. Both are fine, but Grainger really connects with the wildness of Bonnie (a far cry from Lucrezia Borgia in Showtime's series ""The Borgias"" which I loved her in). Her obsession with celebrity (or infamy) is one of the production's strongest elements. The couple start out as depression era heroes to many, but soon find the violence escalating and their popularity waning. If you know the story of Bonnie and Clyde, this version doesn't offer much in the way of new information. The screenplay gives Clyde a form of precognition so that he sees the imminent danger their path is taking them on, and he seems to struggle with what they've become. But I never fully connected with his plight.Holly Hunter is on board as Bonnie's mother and William Hurt is a lawman on their tracks. But while both actors are terrific, they enjoy limited screen time. Another major character of this version is portrayed by Elizabeth Reaser as a reporter who is initially fascinated by the pair before being disillusioned by their brutality. I suppose, in many ways, she is the moral compass of the picture and is meant to represent popular opinion. The other members of the gang (brother Buck and his wife Blanche, for example) don't have a lot to do ultimately and it's a shame. In the original movie, Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Michael J. Pollard all scored Supporting Actor/Actress nominations for their work. So I was surprised to see these roles a little more downplayed than I expected. In many ways, this entire production rests on the shoulders of Hirsch and Grainger.In the end, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is entertaining enough without being particularly special or noteworthy. The production design is good and everything looks quite snazzy. But the story itself falls a little flat, especially considering the colorful material they had to work with. As I said, if you want pure historical content, this won't fulfill those needs. I just wish it would have been more impactful from a dramatic standpoint as well. I was happy enough to view ""Bonnie and Clyde"" once, but I probably wouldn't choose to sit down and watch it again. It is what it is. And that's a well made TV-movie that doesn't enrich the legacy or story of Bonnie and Clyde in any substantial way. If you like Grainger, though, it might definitely be worth a look.

This period piece is done well as far as the weapons, cars, costumes and set design. Even the golden look in certain scenes gives a gritty 1930's feel to the film.  William Hurt is wonderful as Frank Hamer, the relentless Texas Ranger in hot pursuit of Bonnie and Clyde.  Holly Hunter, as Bonnie's mom also turns in a solid performance.  I really wanted to like this film and it is very entertaining.  But the story is far from being accurate.  There was plenty of creative license taken in this Bonnie and Clyde version. For one thing, portraying Bonnie as the instigator in several bank robberies and whose ego was primarily fueled by being famous and seeing her name in lights is not true. Bonnie's letters to Clyde (in prison) show quite the opposite.  She wanted Clyde to ""not be a thug"" and urged him to go straight. Many of her letters are quoted in published and film biographies of Bonnie and Clyde. As for the witness who initially reported Bonnie shot one of the Grapevine police officers and heard her say, ""his head bounced like a rubber ball"", was later discredited.  That scene in the movie never took place. However, newspapers of the day ran with the first story and helped turn public sentiment against Bonnie and Clyde. There are documentaries available that give a more accurate historical account of these two notorious outlaws.  This version of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is compelling.  But for historical accuracy, this Roman a Clef is way off the mark.  If you want the true story, check out ""A & E's Bonnie and Clyde,"" History Channel's documentary ""Bonnie & Clyde: The Real Story"" or read John Neal Phillips book ""Blanche Barrow, my life with Bonnie and Clyde.""  Not only was Blanche married to Clyde's brother Buck, she ran around with the Barrow gang and left journals (1933 - 1935) during her prison stint after being shot and captured.",3,ENTERTAINING FICTIONAL BONNIE & CLYDE!,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,1980,"['Holliday', 'Grainger', 'Emile', 'HIrsch', 'are', 'appealing', 'exciting', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'actors', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'period', 'piece', 'done', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'weapons', 'cars', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'Even', 'golden', 'look', 'certain', 'scenes', 'gritty', '1930', 'feel', 'film', 'William', 'Hurt', 'wonderful', 'Frank', 'Hamer', 'relentless', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Bonnie', 'mom', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'story', 'far', 'being', 'accurate', 'was', 'plenty', 'creative', 'license', 'taken', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'version', 'one', 'thing', 'portraying', 'Bonnie', 'instigator', 'several', 'bank', 'robberies', 'ego', 'was', 'primarily', 'fueled', 'being', 'famous', 'seeing', 'name', 'lights', 'not', 'true', 'Bonnie', 'letters', 'Clyde', 'prison', 'show', 'quite', 'opposite', 'wanted', 'Clyde', 'not', 'be', 'thug', 'urged', 'go', 'straight', 'Many', 'letters', 'are', 'quoted', 'published', 'film', 'biographies', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'witness', 'who', 'initially', 'reported', 'Bonnie', 'shot', 'one', 'Grapevine', 'police', 'officers', 'heard', 'say', 'head', 'bounced', 'rubber', 'ball', 'was', 'later', 'discredited', 'scene', 'movie', 'never', 'took', 'place', 'However', 'newspapers', 'day', 'ran', 'first', 'story', 'helped', 'turn', 'public', 'sentiment', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'are', 'documentaries', 'available', 'give', 'more', 'accurate', 'historical', 'account', 'two', 'notorious', 'outlaws', 'version', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'compelling', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Roman', 'Clef', 'way', 'mark', 'want', 'true', 'story', 'check', 'A', 'E', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Real', 'Story', 'read', 'John', 'Neal', 'Phillips', 'book', 'Blanche', 'Barrow', 'life', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Blanche', 'married', 'Clyde', 'brother', 'Buck', 'ran', 'around', 'Barrow', 'gang', 'left', 'journals', '1933', '1935', 'prison', 'stint', 'being', 'shot', 'captured']",N/A
