It's one of those cartoons that even adults can enjoy.  I never remember the Pup versions, so am enjoying getting these DVDs to watch.  The Pup versions are just as good as the original Scooby-Doos.  This one has 5 episodes on it.  The picture quality isn't that great because it is the same quality as when it came out - it has not been enhanced.
