1692761,APCPKFNRS5WXV,B00HX0KIAM,Alex T,"[0, 0]","There are plenty of hilarious moments in Ride Along, most of them involving Kevin Hart's antics to try to gain respect from his girlfriend's brother and everyone around him. Parents should know that the PG-13 rating is really stretching it here, as there's lots of innuendo (specifically at the beginning when the main character and his girlfriend talk explicitly about their ""night plans"") and gun violence. Some of it is good-natured, and some of it isn't. Fortunately, the tone of the movie is consistently playful and entertaining throughout, and it avoids boring stretches of time or weird shifts in theme. That definitely makes a type of movie like Ride Along recommendable for anyone wanting to see an hour-and-a-half worth of well-paced comedy.It's not at all original, a criticism that has been the main reason for the film's low rating on popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Most of the twists and surprises don't make the film any different from other buddy cop movies. The plot almost feels like a pit stop between moments where Kevin Hart isn't showcasing his humor. And with the slight exception of Hart, most of the acting is quite generic, like the plot itself. In particular is Ice Cube, who's really just in the movie to play the non-comedic foil.The good news is that the screenwriters didn't dwell too much on trying to sell you on those aspects. Instead it's more focused on trying to make you laugh, something that this movie does well. Because of the great timing and spacing of the many jokes in the film, the shortcomings won't prevent you from enjoying Ride Along. Viewers should go in expecting a genuinely funny movie, because that's all this type of film really needs anyway.",3,"Very funny, but also predictable",1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,1713,"['are', 'plenty', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Ride', 'Along', 'most', 'involving', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'antics', 'try', 'gain', 'respect', 'girlfriend', 'brother', 'everyone', 'Parents', 'should', 'know', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'really', 'stretching', 'here', 'lots', 'innuendo', 'specifically', 'beginning', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'talk', 'explicitly', 'night', 'plans', 'gun', 'violence', 'good-natured', ""n't"", 'Fortunately', 'tone', 'movie', 'consistently', 'playful', 'entertaining', 'boring', 'stretches', 'time', 'weird', 'shifts', 'theme', 'definitely', 'type', 'movie', 'Ride', 'Along', 'recommendable', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'see', 'hour-and-a-half', 'worth', 'well-paced', 'comedy.It', 'not', 'original', 'criticism', 'been', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'low', 'rating', 'popular', 'sites', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'IMDB', 'Most', 'twists', 'surprises', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'different', 'other', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'plot', 'almost', 'feels', 'pit', 'stop', 'moments', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Hart', ""n't"", 'showcasing', 'humor', 'slight', 'exception', 'Hart', 'most', 'acting', 'quite', 'generic', 'plot', 'particular', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'movie', 'play', 'non-comedic', 'foil.The', 'good', 'news', 'screenwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'sell', 'aspects', 'Instead', 'more', 'focused', 'trying', 'make', 'laugh', 'something', 'movie', 'well', 'great', 'timing', 'spacing', 'many', 'jokes', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'Ride', 'Along', 'Viewers', 'should', 'go', 'expecting', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'movie', 'type', 'film', 'really', 'anyway']",Ride Along

Though his new movie ""Ride Along"" never surpasses some of his more funnier work, that isn't to say it's not good. It had me laughing throughout, and I'm betting it will do the same to you.The story centers around Ben (Kevin Hart), a fast talking security guard who wants to marry his long-time girlfriend Angela. The only thing standing in his way is her brother James, played by Ice Cube, a decorated police officer who isn't exactly fond of him. In order to prove he's worthy, Ben is forced to go on a ride along and is quickly wrapped up into the scary crime-scene of Atlanta. As you can imagine, the hilarity ensues.This definitely isn't a movie to take too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it. Hart easily carries the film and provides most, if not all, of the laughs.

Kevin Hart is one of my all time favorite comedians and his stand up always has me laughing to the point of tears. I thought this movie was going to be the same...THOUGHT being key word.I'm not usually one for action movies, much less buddy-cop films, but last year I saw The Heat and thought it was downright hilarious. And I will say that 21 Jump Street with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill is one of my all time favorite movies, but I think that's because the comedy easily outweighs the action in those two films. I can't say the same for Ride Along.This movie had way more action than the trailer let on, and it was basically just another shoot-em-up flick with some humor here and there for me. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are a great comedic duo, but I felt like the script could have been a lot funnier, especially with someone like Kevin Hart being the lead role.So overall if you're really into generic, buddy-cop action movies, this is the right film for you!

It would&#8217;ve been the worse, but I expected more from I, Frankenstein and that was just so disappointing that I have that one as the worst movie so far this year. I would not have watched Ride Along voluntarily but a friend rented it and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I hate it when they get an actor, like Kevin Hart, who is kind of the flavor of the month and put them into a vehicle movie that was thrown together hap-hazardly. As my friend would say, &#8220;You gotta be a fan&#8221;. I like Kevin hart, but I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a huge fan, certainly not big enough to enjoy this movie. Kevin Hart wants to marry Ice Cube&#8217;s sister. Ice Cube doesn&#8217;t like him. Kevin Hart wants Ice Cube&#8217;s approval. Ice Cube is cop, so he takes Hart on a ride along with him to work. Of course Cube is trying to discourage Hart, so he will stay away from Cube&#8217;s sister, but Hart is a resilient all be it pretty stupid guy. Completely implausible plot, but that&#8217;s not really the complaint I have. It&#8217;s just not funny. I don&#8217;t think I laughed once. The jokes are so old and over-used.

1692817,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HX0KIAM,FNDNreview,"[8, 15]","Here were are, yet again with another team-up cop movie &#8211; as if we haven&#8217;t seen enough of those over the years.  Most recently, Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy starred together in The Heat, but prior to that we&#8217;ve seen an endless array of partnerships over the years, just a few of which include Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, and if you really want to dig deep, then there&#8217;s Jim Belushi and man&#8217;s best friend in K-9.  The list of duos is endless and we could sit here all day running down the partnerships, but the bottom line here is that this style of storytelling is so unbelievably tiresome that it needs to stop.  And, if you require proof, just watch the &#8220;comedy,&#8221; Ride Along.Director Tim Story (Think Like a Man, Barbershop) re-teams with both Ice Cube and Kevin Hart in Ride Along.  Ice Cube stars as James Payton, an Atlanta police officer that has been working on a dead-end case, chasing after a &#8220;ghost&#8221; arms dealer, known only as Omar.  At the same time, his sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter), has been dating a school security guard and video game addict, Ben (Kevin Hart).  The two are preparing to share the news with James they want to get married.Ben, like James, has ambitions to be a police officer and applies to the academy, of which he is accepted.  Excited by the acceptance, Ben shares the news with James about the academy and also seeks his approval to marry his sister.  James is immediately dismissive, finding Ben to be horribly irritating, not to mention disapproving of him even dating his sister, let alone marrying her.  Hoping to deter Ben from joining the academy, James decides to take him on a ride along, telling him if he is able to successfully make it through the day, he will give him his blessing &#8211; all the while James knowingly takes on all of the police department&#8217;s most ridiculous calls.For reasons beyond comprehension, some people seem to be under the impression that Kevin Hart is revitalizing his career by taking on roles of this nature.  If you know anything about Hart or have possibly even seen his act, then you know he&#8217;s easily comparable to someone like Chris Tucker &#8211; meaning a character actor that seemingly never stops talking.  Unfortunately, has to make a comment about anything and everything, and it gets to point in this film where it&#8217;s nearly unbearable.  He&#8217;s tries too hard to be funny and in doing so, comes off as insincere and downright stale.  After taking roles in recent films, like Grudge Match, Think Like a Man, and now Ride Along &#8211; he&#8217;s not helping his case to be recognized as a legitimate, reputable actor.Ice Cube, like Kevin Hart, is also is also a repeat offender when it comes to playing the same role over and over again.  Hart creates brief moments of laughter, but it&#8217;s only due to Ice Cube&#8217;s serious demeanor.  Cube has a miniscule amount of leading role potential, but he wasted it on sorry films like All About the Benjamins and the Friday sequels.  Still, he has proven to at least be occasionally entertaining, mostly in TV commercials or his role in 21 Jump Street.  He might be the lead in this film, but the plot tries to cater more towards Hart&#8217;s petty excuse for humor &#8211; which is vulgar, sexual, and insulting.  Apparently, that can all pass with a PG-13 rating these days.The majority of the film&#8217;s scenes are just one ridiculous encounter after another &#8211; evident in the moments where Hart&#8217;s character attempts to sway a group of bikers to move from a handicapped parking spot or in another scene where it&#8217;s supposed to be funny that a random guy is throwing food in a supermarket.  Is this really what passes for entertainment?  Surely there&#8217;s better things to spend your money on than watching someone refer to his nether region as &#8220;Black Hammer&#8221; or fight with someone in a cop car over who gets to say &#8220;roger that.&#8221;If there&#8217;s one actor I really feel bad for, it&#8217;s Lawrence Fishburne.  There&#8217;s really nothing more irritating than to see a talented actor lending his time to a horrendous film.  To make matters worse, Ride Along tries to make it seem like a big shocker that Fishburne shows up towards the end as the villain.  He was prominently advertised in the opening credits, which makes it painfully obvious he was going to be the villain.  And, when he finally does show up &#8211; it leads to a completely predictable and uneventful showdown.Overall, Ride Along is about as entertaining as the commercial advertisements make it out to be.  There are brief moments of laughter, but nothing that you&#8217;ll point to and say that was the funniest moment in the film.  The puns are repetitive and childish, while the acting is mediocre and tedious.  Kevin Hart continues the trend of making himself a part of dull-witted films, while Ice Cube continues his trend of portraying hard-nosed characters.  Already, word has spread that Ride Along will receive the sequel treatment &#8211; after shocking the box office by earning a hefty payday.  However, if you plan to shell out cash to watch such a ridiculous movie, don&#8217;t be surprised when you feel foolish for doing so after it&#8217;s over.GRADE:  DFNDNreview.com",1,"Ice Cube & Kevin

Lane ""professional audience member""","[1, 2]","Director Tim Story (&#34;Think Like a Man&#34;) brings us a crowd pleaser that had the screening audience laughing from the first frame. Of course that is partly due to the great popularity of fast-talking Kevin Hart, but this silly odd-couple story is fun. Any self-respecting police department would NEVER allow the sorts of capers we see, but what's a few plot holes between friends? It certainly didn't handicap writers Greg Coolidge (&#34;Baby Mama&#34;) and Jason Mantzoukas (Lots of TV) as they pile laugh upon laugh while we happily suspend disbelief and wait for the happy ending.Even through our hero is steadily employed as a security guard, he really, REALLY wants to be an Atlanta police officer like his finance's brother James. He feels prepared: after all, he has played a cop in countless video games. There are three important things in his life: Being a cop, those video games and his gorgeous fianc&eacute;e Angela.We watch:* Kevin Hart (&#34;Grudge Match&#34;) is our hero Ben, who has finagled a ride in a cop car with his potential brother-in-law to prove he is worthy to marry into the family. (Every legitimate PD in the country is shaking its collective head.)* Tika Sumpter (&#34;Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas&#34;) plays our hero's lovely sweetheart, Angela. This patient gal seems to find his immature ADHD-type personality appealing.* Ice Cube (&#34;21 Jump Street&#34;) brings us James, a no-nonsense cop who has trust issues, particularly with this haywire fruitcake his sister Angela has unaccountably fallen for.* Bruce McGill (&#34;Lincoln&#34;) will always convince ME that he is a tough but fair police captain who is running out of patience: Detective James is highly effective, but his unorthodox methods are difficult to justify.Of course we have other cops who provide backup, plus a surprise mystery guest whom I won't divulge because he is uncredited, so that would be a spoiler.This is PG-13, so expect mild profanity, no nudity, no sweaty bodies, some vehicular mayhem, some dandy blowie uppie stuff and a LOT of gunfire!

""Make a movie!""""But Daaaad,"" you whine. ""I don't even have a story!""""Make a buddy-cop action flick,"" he demands. ""Those are easy. One of the cops will be tough and no-nonsense. The other one will be a goofy, bumbling idiot who's over his head. Through various hi-jinks, they'll learn to respect each other. Also, there should be some kind of serious plot that leads to a big, explosive climax. Make it about drugs. No, wait. Drugs are played out. Guns. Make it about guns. The bad guys should be some kind of race that you won't get into trouble for stereotyping. Croatian. No, wait. Our maid is Croatian. I've got it! Serbian. Serbian bad guys with guns.""""But I don't know what I'm doing,"" you whine.""Don't worry about it,"" your dad waves. ""Also, I'll get Laurence Fishburne to be in it.

""HE knows why.""So, to prepare, you sit down with some herbal jazz cigarettes and  watch every buddy-cop film you can find, occasionally remembering to take notes on the plot elements that pop up most frequently. Then, surly and unmotivated, you write your movie. The script turns out to be twelve pages long, and most of that is about first-person shooter games.""Daaaaad,"" you whine. ""Writing a movie is hard! My script is too  short!""""Don't worry about it,"" your dad says. ""Get a popular comedian in one of the lead roles and just let him ad-lib and mug and riff all over the place. Make sure a camera is running on him at all times. Let him do whatever he wants. Also, give him a girlfriend who is impossibly good-looking and who runs around half-naked for most of the film. Are you writing this down?""So, finally, you make your film. You put some of your favorite songs in it, even though they don't really match the action or story. You edit it while smoking herbal jazz cigarettes, so sequences and plotlines don't totally line up right. Laurence Fishburne is so disgusted with you that he phones in almost his entire performance along with pretty much everyone else except for your comedic lead, who throws himself into the role like a coke-era Robin Williams. Behind your back, people grumble about what a schlocky, sloppy, uninspired mess the film is, the only decent aspect of it being -- ironically -- the inside jokes related to video games. But you finally finish it.""Can I go now?"" you grumble to your dad.""Yes, son,"" he says. ""I'm proud of you son.""""Proud?"" you sneer. ""I barely even tried.""""I know,"" he grins lovingly.

Ben does, however, suffer from delusions of grandeur when it comes to what he plans to do with his life, which is to use his skills as a gamer to become one hell of a real life crime fighter. James agrees to take Ben on a &#8220;ride along&#8221; in his squad car to see if he has what it takes to be a cop. Hilarity ensues.Or at least it would if the one-joke premise didn&#8217;t run out of steam about a half hour into the movie&#8217;s running time. Actually, &#8220;Ride Along&#8221; starts off on a promising note, with breezy, fast-paced dialogue and a genuine rapport established between Hart as the comic cutup and Ice Cube as his requisite straight man (think of them as an African-American version of Martin and Lewis).But the concept begins to pall early on, as too many of the scenes run on well past their sell-by dates as far as generating any further laughs is concerned.

Using bland humor and cutesy buddy comedy twists and hoping we giggle like schoolgirls.The plot is easy to figure out, with a lot of attempts at being funny that totally fail.  If you laugh at all, it is because of Kevin Hart.  And the laughs don't come that often.  He is underused, which stinks.  Then you have Leguizamo who is in the film as a manikin, basically.  He is woefully underused as well.There is an entertaining action sequence in the end, but everything up until then is just bland.  You can see there were quite a few scenes where Hart could have shined, but the film makers chose to accept the boring cut and move on.  Lazy production.NEVER BUY THIS.  You might want to finish it, but you will never watch it twice.  You are much better off renting Kevin Hart's stand-up specials.
