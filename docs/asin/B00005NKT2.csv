669290,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00005NKT2,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[31, 34]","Stephanie Zimbalist comes out of the woodwork to star in this movie that was inspired by a true story.  I can bet a lot of it was fabricated, but am sure the gist of what happened is true.  It is scary in this day & age to think of an American prison being so corrupt as this one is portrayed, but it is not beyond belief.Zimbalist plays an everyday mother who inadvertantly breaks the law & is sent to prison.  While there she is exposed to all sorts of horrifying practices of prison guards abusing their power & position.  At every turn, her attempts to be proactive about the situation fail.While most movies that deal with women in prison are of the softcore porn variety, rest assure this movie is VERY serious.  I would even go so far to say as it's the women's prison counterpart to SHAWSHENK REDEMPTION.
