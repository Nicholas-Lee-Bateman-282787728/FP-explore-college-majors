The story really belongs to the Mother and her new Indian boyfriend. She was about her son's age when she found herself pregnant and dealing with his concerns helps her sort out her own life.

581095,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00005BCP5,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","The user reviews were what prompted me to view this flick, but, as much as I liked viewing it (or most of it), it just fell flat in the last 20 minutes or so.The idea is good. It's sort of a fish out of water tale. Jennifer Jason Leigh and her son (played well by Bug Hall) are banished from their North Carolina home by granddad because he's running for office, and having his floozy daughter and bastard grandson around can only hurt his chances of getting elected. He packs them off to Wyoming which is a way different culture. Hall is a 14 year old that is beyond his years and puts up with his mom's....looseness. They both encounter the locals and it's a cultural clash.Much of this is good. The characters are generally interesting as are the situations. The directing, however, is uneven. It never really rises above hack level and some scenes just don't come off well at all. Many have commented on the fantasy scenes, involving Drew Barrymore at the 50s style pool party, and how good they thought these scenes were. I thought they missed the mark by a wide margin. For my money they lacked authenticity.I don't want to give anything away but the smaller stories develop during the movie and come to a head when granddad arrives and wants to further display his power. So now you have this small group of outcasts and they need to do something, so the writer banishes them (figuratively) to Hollywood. Tie it up in a pretty bow and blow this pop stand. It just smacked of cheap or lazy or box office.The acting was very good and most of the camerawork was good enough but I took real exception to some of the soundtrack. Leigh is dating a Native American and in a couple of scenes, when he shows up, they play a song reminiscent of the song ""Apache"" which was popular around that time. The producers wouldn't fork over for the real deal. There were also one or two other songs popular at the time where the producers chose to use cover versions as opposed to the originals and that just makes me want to spit.This isn't a bad movie.

When Sam meets a girl named Maurey, they both decide to start trying to figure out what sex is like.  Lydia tells them how to have sex and from that point on, this movie is a strange, oddball journey.

He plays a good guy who falls for Lydia only to have to deal with her wild ways.  All of the actors in this film did a great job.

581097,A1KT1GWCW8F80,B00005BCP5,K. Gittins,"[12, 13]","""Skipped Parts"" takes place in 1963. It is narrated by Sam (Bug Hall), a seventh-grader, and aspiring writer. He doesn't know who his father is because his mother, Lydia (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a promiscuous lush. Sam's Grandfather sends them away, with his financial support, so he won't be embarrassed by her when he runs for Governor of South Carolina.They end up in Wyoming, where Sam meets Maurey (Mischa Barton) during a school baseball game. They argue about Mark Twain in class. Shortly after, Maurey and her mom (Peggy Lipton) do a neighborly visit - the Welcome Wagon. Lydia is embarrassingly rude to them. Later, Sam tells his mom he thinks he's in love with Maurey cuz he can't stand her. Sam gets teased and hassled by girls in school, and also by Maurey's boyfriend, Dothan (Brad Renfro). On November 22, 1963, Kennedy is shot. Maurey is very upset and cries, and Sam consoles her. Dothan makes some racist remarks, and Maurey and Sam go to her house. In another fantasy, Sam kisses Maurey's mom. He has a resulting nocturnal emission and shows his mom. Later, Sam tells Maurey about it at the soda shop, and she talks to a waitress about sex. Maurey later shows up to ""make sex"" with Sam as a learning experience. They try but fail in a funny scene. Later, Lydia gives them a sex talk and advice. Maurey inevitably gets pregnant, and after some initial reluctance, Sam seems happy as a father.The movie is well-acted by all. There is quite a bit of humor, too. The movie is R-Rated for language, which includes frank sexual talk, and sexual content. However, the sex scenes involving Sam and Maurey are tame and mostly set up by the dialog, which is quite funny. This is probably Mischa's best movie after ""Lawn Dogs"". Drew Barrymore has a small part in Sam's fantasies.The movie only skims the book, which has more sex-related and bodypart-related dialog.The DVD has a good commentary by director Tamra Davis, and a trailer.",4,"""Here's rule number one - you better not squirt.""",1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,1942,"['Skipped', 'Parts', 'place', '1963', 'narrated', 'Sam', 'Bug', 'Hall', 'seventh-grader', 'aspiring', 'writer', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'father', 'mother', 'Lydia', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'promiscuous', 'lush', 'Sam', 'Grandfather', 'away', 'financial', 'support', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'embarrassed', 'when', 'Governor', 'South', 'Carolina.They', 'end', 'up', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'Sam', 'Maurey', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'school', 'baseball', 'game', 'argue', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'class', 'Shortly', 'Maurey', 'mom', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'do', 'neighborly', 'visit', 'Welcome', 'Wagon', 'Lydia', 'embarrassingly', 'rude', 'Later', 'Sam', 'mom', 'love', 'Maurey', 'cuz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Sam', 'teased', 'hassled', 'girls', 'school', 'also', 'Maurey', 'boyfriend', 'Dothan', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'November', '22', '1963', 'Kennedy', 'shot', 'Maurey', 'very', 'upset', 'cries', 'Sam', 'Dothan', 'racist', 'remarks', 'Maurey', 'Sam', 'go', 'house', 'fantasy', 'Sam', 'Maurey', 'mom', 'resulting', 'nocturnal', 'emission', 'mom', 'Later', 'Sam', 'Maurey', 'soda', 'shop', 'waitress', 'sex', 'Maurey', 'later', 'up', 'make', 'sex', 'Sam', 'learning', 'experience', 'try', 'fail', 'funny', 'scene', 'Later', 'Lydia', 'sex', 'talk', 'advice', 'Maurey', 'inevitably', 'pregnant', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'Sam', 'happy', 'father.The', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'too', 'movie', 'R-Rated', 'language', 'frank', 'sexual', 'talk', 'sexual', 'content', 'However', 'sex', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Sam', 'Maurey', 'are', 'tame', 'mostly', 'set', 'up', 'dialog', 'quite', 'funny', 'probably', 'Mischa', 'best', 'movie', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'small', 'part', 'Sam', 'fantasies.The', 'movie', 'only', 'book', 'more', 'sex-related', 'bodypart-related', 'dialog.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tamra', 'Davis', 'trailer']",Skipped Parts

The book by Tim Sandlin, also called &quot;Skipped Parts&quot; is one of the best coming-of-age stories I have ever read. It is funny, crazy, and poignant. The movie didn't capture even a tenth of the charm of the book, and also did not handle the relationship between Maurey and Sam very well. This is a result of trying to tone down what is in essence a story of two young children experimenting with sex.  This made their story seem more like a by-the-books moralistic tale than the authority-be-damned, life-affirming tale that it really is.

Any such comparision is irrelevant, even if a movie is based on a book (or vice versa).That said, this is a startling and surprising movie.  It is well-acted, and tells a compelling story.  It is easy to follow, the plot moves along well, and the characters are interesting enough to make you care about them.So don't worry if you read the book or not, the movie stands on it's own as a worthy film.",4,Forget the Book!,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,830,"['Why', 'do', 'people', 'insist', 'comparing', 'movies', 'books', 'Do', 'compare', 'music', 'paintings', 'Sculpture', 'poetry', 'course', 'not', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'books', 'either', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'mediums', 'entirely', 'different', 'modes', 'personal', 'interaction', 'act', 'reading', 'book', 'completely', 'different', 'watching', 'movie', 'minute', 'read', 'review', 'book', 'movie', 'run', 'such', 'comparision', 'irrelevant', 'even', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'vice', 'versa', 'said', 'startling', 'surprising', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'compelling', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'them.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'movie', 'own', 'worthy', 'film']",Skipped Parts
