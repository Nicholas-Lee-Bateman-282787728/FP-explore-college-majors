327915,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6302682630,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","SOME CAME RUNNING is a recent DVD release of the 1958 movie version of the same name and itself was based on the book SOME CAME RUNNING, authored by no other than James (FROM HERE TO ETERNITY) Jones.This film is set in fictional Parkman, Indiana, in the late 1940's.  Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra) is the vet-turned-drifter who comes to his home town for a breather -- but gets sucked into provincial hypocrisy before he can claw his way out.  A star turn by Sinatra all the way.And the supporting performances are sterling, including Dean Martin as 'Bama, the laid-back boozer and expert poker player and Arthur Kennedy as Dave's older brother who is oh-so-careful to commit adultery out of the public's eye SPOILERS FROM HERE ON but gets caught in spite of himself.  Martha Hyer as the town's unofficial bearer of culture underplayed handsomely; Shirley McLain in a ""breakout"" role as the good-times girl overplayed handsomely; they both portray their characters excellently. And Dave is torn between the two.Vincente Minnelli was an amazing director who worked best within the bounds of the studio system.  SOME CAME RUNNING was bankrolled by Sol Siegel but released by Loews, releasing shell for MGM.  The way the characers are dressed, the dives or elegant clubs they frequent, even the way they shake hands:  all are very telling of the class divide between the insecure Babbity middle class and the equally insecure lower-working class. Jones' book and therefore this movie have little sympathy for either side of the class divide; this mirrored James Jones' own life.The closing sequence in this 136 minute movie is a swirl of flashing lights, colored lights, and the fair come for the town's centennial, a fantasmagoria of color, action and impending doom -- sort of like the dark side of Minnelli's sunshine creations like the ""Trolley Song"" in MEET ME IN SAINT LOUIS or ""The Night They Invented Champagne,"" from GIGI. (Nineteen fifty-eight was really Minnelli's year; his Oscar-winning GIGI had come out earlier that year.)SOME CAME RUNNING is a good, solid movie with surprisingly nuanced characters played by an almost remarkable combination of actors.  About my only gripe worth mentioning are that the film runs two hours, 16 minutes, and it's in the early and middle parts of the movie that things occasionally bog down (Frank Sinatra allegedly tore 20 pages out of his own script, an act that probably did the movie-going public a favor).We noticed a little distortion at the right and left sides of our CRT TV screen.  I hope someone with HDTV will comment about how the film looks on the new TV standard.  This was a Cinemascope release, which means the ratio of length to height is more than two to one; and HDTV only ""stretches"" to a ratio of one to 1.77.  We ourselves did not mind the letterboxing, which appeared to be quite accurately done.A happy and dollar-conscious way to own SOME CAME RUNNING is to buy the six-pack of Frankie's films from the fifties.",4,I'D GO RUNNING FOR THE DVD,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2980,"['SOME', 'CAME', 'RUNNING', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', '1958', 'movie', 'version', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'SOME', 'CAME', 'RUNNING', 'authored', 'other', 'James', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'TO', 'ETERNITY', 'Jones.This', 'film', 'set', 'fictional', 'Parkman', 'Indiana', 'late', '1940', 'Dave', 'Hirsch', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'vet-turned-drifter', 'who', 'home', 'town', 'breather', 'sucked', 'provincial', 'hypocrisy', 'can', 'claw', 'way', 'out', 'star', 'turn', 'Sinatra', 'way.And', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'sterling', 'including', 'Dean', 'Martin', ""'Bama"", 'laid-back', 'boozer', 'expert', 'poker', 'player', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'Dave', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'oh-so-careful', 'commit', 'public', 'eye', 'SPOILERS', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'ON', 'caught', 'spite', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'town', 'unofficial', 'bearer', 'culture', 'underplayed', 'handsomely', 'Shirley', 'McLain', 'breakout', 'role', 'good-times', 'girl', 'overplayed', 'handsomely', 'portray', 'characters', 'excellently', 'Dave', 'torn', 'two.Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'amazing', 'director', 'who', 'worked', 'best', 'bounds', 'studio', 'system', 'SOME', 'CAME', 'RUNNING', 'was', 'bankrolled', 'Sol', 'Siegel', 'released', 'Loews', 'releasing', 'shell', 'MGM', 'way', 'characers', 'are', 'dressed', 'dives', 'elegant', 'clubs', 'frequent', 'even', 'way', 'shake', 'hands', 'are', 'very', 'telling', 'class', 'divide', 'insecure', 'Babbity', 'middle', 'class', 'equally', 'insecure', 'lower-working', 'class', 'Jones', 'book', 'therefore', 'movie', 'have', 'little', 'sympathy', 'side', 'class', 'divide', 'mirrored', 'James', 'Jones', 'own', 'life.The', 'closing', 'sequence', '136', 'minute', 'movie', 'swirl', 'flashing', 'lights', 'colored', 'lights', 'fair', 'come', 'town', 'centennial', 'fantasmagoria', 'color', 'action', 'impending', 'doom', 'sort', 'dark', 'side', 'Minnelli', 'sunshine', 'creations', 'Trolley', 'Song', 'MEET', 'ME', 'IN', 'SAINT', 'LOUIS', 'Night', 'Invented', 'Champagne', 'GIGI', 'Nineteen', 'fifty-eight', 'was', 'really', 'Minnelli', 'year', 'Oscar-winning', 'GIGI', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'earlier', 'year', 'SOME', 'CAME', 'RUNNING', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'nuanced', 'characters', 'played', 'almost', 'remarkable', 'combination', 'actors', 'only', 'gripe', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'film', 'two', 'hours', '16', 'minutes', 'early', 'middle', 'parts', 'movie', 'things', 'occasionally', 'bog', 'down', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'allegedly', 'tore', '20', 'pages', 'own', 'script', 'act', 'probably', 'did', 'movie-going', 'public', 'favor', '.We', 'noticed', 'little', 'distortion', 'right', 'left', 'sides', 'CRT', 'TV', 'screen', 'hope', 'someone', 'HDTV', 'will', 'comment', 'how', 'film', 'new', 'TV', 'standard', 'was', 'Cinemascope', 'release', 'ratio', 'length', 'height', 'more', 'two', 'one', 'HDTV', 'only', 'stretches', 'ratio', 'one', '1.77', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'letterboxing', 'appeared', 'be', 'quite', 'accurately', 'done.A', 'happy', 'dollar-conscious', 'way', 'own', 'SOME', 'CAME', 'RUNNING', 'buy', 'six-pack', 'Frankie', 'films', 'fifties']",Some Came Running VHS
327916,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302682630,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I am a huge fan of Shirley MacLaine.  I consider her one of our finest actresses of all time and simply adore everything she touches (almost).  After seeing `The Manchurian Candidate' I wasn't too keen on watching another Frank Sinatra movie, but my friends were telling me just how wonderful MacLaine is here, and so I just needed to see this.  I did, and while I can't say that the movie itself is one I'd rush out to watch again, I must admit that MacLaine's performance ranks at the top of my list as one of the greatest supporting performances of all time (in fact, recently some friends and I ranked our top 5 in each of Oscar's categories and MacLaine made it on all our ballots for this performance, ranking in at number 3 for me personally).The film follows G.I. Dave Hirsh as he comes home after a long absence and a string of unsuccessful novels.  Hoping to start over and write something great, Hirsh winds up involved with a professional gambler, a floozy, a mannered schoolteacher and his brother, Frank, who is far from perfect himself (although a lot self-righteous).I know that a lot of people just ate this movie up, but personally I couldn't really fall in love with it.  I felt that the storyline was intriguing enough (failed writer searching for himself amidst people he rarely connects to) and I felt that as a whole the acting was rather good (MacLaine was impeccable, Martin was remarkable, Kennedy and Hyer were respectable and Sinatra was, well, decent) but there is just something missing here that made it hard for me to truly connect with.  I found myself simply satisfied, nothing more, nothing less.It's not a bad film; it's just not a great one.  It's rather `middle of the road'.As Hirsh, Sinatra is serviceable, but to be honest I find him rather bland at times.  He wasn't a very accomplished actor despite his accolades and large following.  I appreciate the talent he has (as a singer) but in the end his acting career leaves some to be desired.  This is probably the better of the performances I've seen, but it's not a knock out.  I think that he may be the biggest reason I couldn't `connect' with the film.  I found him to be off putting at times, and not in the `this is my character so admire my dedication to my role' kind of way; he was just `off putting'.  In order to really invest yourself in this film you have to be able to get inside Hirsh's head and relate to him, but Sinatra made that hard for me.  I felt a much deeper draw to the cast of character's that walked in and out of his life.Martin fares better here, MUCH better.  He has the suave coolness about him that resonates very well with his character.  I would have much rather seen him collect a Supporting Actor nomination over Kennedy.  Kennedy has the right amount of nervous jitters to make his character likable despite his hypocrisy, and Hyer is enticing in her reserved affections.  The supporting cast is all really good, from Leora Dana's bossy demeanor to Nancy Gates' seductive presence and Betty Lou Keirn's adoring curiosity.But no one, and I mean NO ONE, comes close to Shirley MacLaine.  Let me just say this; what MacLaine does here is beyond brilliant.  She is equal parts lovely and shrill, intriguing and repelling, adoring and annoying.  She manages to be the `complete person', giving us reason upon reason to keep watching the film with hopes of seeing more and more of her.  Her emotional connection to Sinatra's character (or shall I say her `need' to feel connected to something) is felt with every breath she takes, and the climax is so deeply moving (heartbreaking) that one cannot deny the connection they have made with this simple minded yet big hearted woman.This is a performance for the ages and should have netted her the Oscar (albeit, she was nominated in the WRONG category).In the end, I recommend this film for the performances, which for the most part are enough to carry the entire film.  It is lacking as a whole for me, but in the end it is far from bad and a film that will satisfy to say the least.  See it for MacLaine, seriously, because there are few performances this rich and this close to perfection.",3,What may possibly be MacLaine's greatest performance...,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,4163,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'consider', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'time', 'simply', 'adore', 'everything', 'almost', 'seeing', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'watching', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'movie', 'friends', 'were', 'telling', 'just', 'how', 'wonderful', 'MacLaine', 'here', 'so', 'just', 'needed', 'see', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'one', ""'d"", 'rush', 'out', 'watch', 'again', 'must', 'admit', 'MacLaine', 'performance', 'ranks', 'top', 'list', 'one', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'performances', 'time', 'fact', 'recently', 'friends', 'ranked', 'top', '5', 'Oscar', 'categories', 'MacLaine', 'made', 'ballots', 'performance', 'ranking', 'number', '3', 'personally', '.The', 'film', 'G.I', 'Dave', 'Hirsh', 'home', 'long', 'absence', 'string', 'unsuccessful', 'novels', 'Hoping', 'start', 'write', 'something', 'great', 'Hirsh', 'up', 'involved', 'professional', 'gambler', 'floozy', 'mannered', 'schoolteacher', 'brother', 'Frank', 'who', 'far', 'perfect', 'lot', 'self-righteous', '.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'ate', 'movie', 'up', 'personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'felt', 'storyline', 'was', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'failed', 'writer', 'searching', 'amidst', 'people', 'rarely', 'felt', 'whole', 'acting', 'was', 'rather', 'good', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'impeccable', 'Martin', 'was', 'remarkable', 'Kennedy', 'Hyer', 'were', 'respectable', 'Sinatra', 'was', 'well', 'decent', 'just', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'made', 'hard', 'truly', 'connect', 'found', 'simply', 'satisfied', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'rather', 'middle', ""road'.As"", 'Hirsh', 'Sinatra', 'serviceable', 'be', 'honest', 'find', 'rather', 'bland', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'accolades', 'large', 'following', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'singer', 'end', 'acting', 'career', 'be', 'desired', 'probably', 'better', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'knock', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'off', 'putting', 'times', 'not', 'character', 'so', 'admire', 'dedication', 'role', 'kind', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'off', 'putting', 'order', 'really', 'invest', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'Hirsh', 'head', 'relate', 'Sinatra', 'made', 'hard', 'felt', 'much', 'deeper', 'draw', 'cast', 'character', 'walked', 'life.Martin', 'fares', 'better', 'here', 'MUCH', 'better', 'suave', 'coolness', 'very', 'well', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'collect', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'Kennedy', 'Kennedy', 'right', 'amount', 'nervous', 'jitters', 'make', 'character', 'likable', 'hypocrisy', 'Hyer', 'enticing', 'reserved', 'affections', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'good', 'Leora', 'Dana', 'bossy', 'demeanor', 'Nancy', 'Gates', 'seductive', 'presence', 'Betty', 'Lou', 'Keirn', 'adoring', 'curiosity.But', 'one', 'mean', 'ONE', 'close', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'what', 'MacLaine', 'here', 'brilliant', 'equal', 'parts', 'lovely', 'shrill', 'intriguing', 'repelling', 'adoring', 'annoying', 'be', 'complete', 'person', 'giving', 'reason', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'hopes', 'seeing', 'more', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Sinatra', 'character', 'shall', 'say', 'need', 'feel', 'connected', 'something', 'felt', 'breath', 'climax', 'so', 'deeply', 'moving', 'heartbreaking', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'connection', 'have', 'made', 'simple', 'minded', 'yet', 'big', 'hearted', 'woman.This', 'performance', 'ages', 'should', 'have', 'netted', 'Oscar', 'albeit', 'was', 'nominated', 'WRONG', 'category', 'end', 'recommend', 'film', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'enough', 'carry', 'entire', 'film', 'lacking', 'whole', 'end', 'far', 'bad', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'say', 'least', 'See', 'MacLaine', 'seriously', 'are', 'few', 'performances', 'rich', 'close', 'perfection']",Some Came Running VHS

327918,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6302682630,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 3]","""Some Came Running"", based on author James Jones' follow-up to his masterpiece, ""From Here to Eternity"", was a conscious effort by MGM to recapture the lightning of the earlier film, particularly in casting Frank Sinatra (who'd won an Oscar for ""Eternity""), in the lead, and assigning their best director, Vincente Minnelli, to helm the project. Unfortunately, ""Running"" was not in the same league as ""Eternity"", dramatically, but it is certainly a good film, made even better by two unusual casting choices, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine, in pivotal roles.Part of the film's failure is the structure of the story, dark and anticlimactic, and another is Sinatra, who seems a bit miscast as the 'Great American Author' (I see him more likely a Mickey Spillane than a William Faulkner). Yet he very nearly pulls it off, thanks to MacLaine, as an uneducated waif who adores him, and Martin, a drawling, Stetson-wearing gambling buddy who hides his own demons behind an easy-going charm. In their devotion to the homecoming author, they make him stronger and far more interesting than he'd have been, without them.Two other cast members are standouts; Arthur Kennedy not only looks like he could be Sinatra's brother, he succeeds in creating a persona perfectly suited to Parkman, Indiana, where a successful appearance hides a multitude of sins. Even better is Martha Hyer, as a very prim, uptight schoolteacher whose pent-up sexuality is unleashed when Sinatra pulls out the bobby pins holding her tightly-coiffed hair. Kennedy and Hyer personify the community, a virtual 'Peyton Place' of subliminal lusts, waiting for the right catalyst to explode, with cynical Sinatra's arrival providing the spark.I can't praise Minnelli enough, for giving the film much of it's strength. While he fought Sinatra, whose different work ethics would cause a LOT of friction on the set, he created a series of powerful visual statements, most especially during the tense carnival finale. While the film isn't 'top drawer' Minnelli, it is indelibly his work, during one of the most productive periods of his career.The Special Features of this DVD are very entertaining, if bordering on unabashed hero worship of Sinatra. I wish a LONG interview with Shirley MacLaine had been included, as I suspect she has a LOT of stories about Sinatra, Martin, and the production!""Some Came Running"" was a box office and critical success, when released, in 1958, and the film has held up very well, over the years...while not everyone's 'cup of tea', it is certainly worth adding to your collection.",4,"No ""From Here to Eternity"", but Well-Crafted Drama...",1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2571,"['Came', 'Running', 'based', 'author', 'James', 'Jones', 'follow-up', 'masterpiece', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'was', 'conscious', 'effort', 'MGM', 'recapture', 'lightning', 'earlier', 'film', 'particularly', 'casting', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'who', ""'d"", 'won', 'Oscar', 'Eternity', 'lead', 'assigning', 'best', 'director', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'helm', 'project', 'Unfortunately', 'Running', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Eternity', 'dramatically', 'certainly', 'good', 'film', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'two', 'unusual', 'casting', 'choices', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'pivotal', 'roles.Part', 'film', 'failure', 'structure', 'story', 'dark', 'anticlimactic', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'bit', 'miscast', ""'Great"", 'American', 'Author', 'see', 'more', 'likely', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'very', 'nearly', 'off', 'thanks', 'MacLaine', 'uneducated', 'waif', 'who', 'Martin', 'drawling', 'Stetson-wearing', 'gambling', 'buddy', 'who', 'own', 'demons', 'easy-going', 'charm', 'devotion', 'homecoming', 'author', 'make', 'stronger', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'standouts', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'be', 'Sinatra', 'brother', 'creating', 'persona', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'Parkman', 'Indiana', 'where', 'successful', 'appearance', 'multitude', 'sins', 'Even', 'better', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'very', 'prim', 'uptight', 'schoolteacher', 'pent-up', 'sexuality', 'unleashed', 'when', 'Sinatra', 'out', 'bobby', 'holding', 'tightly-coiffed', 'hair', 'Kennedy', 'Hyer', 'personify', 'community', 'virtual', ""'Peyton"", 'Place', 'subliminal', 'lusts', 'waiting', 'right', 'catalyst', 'explode', 'cynical', 'Sinatra', 'arrival', 'providing', 'spark.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'Minnelli', 'enough', 'giving', 'film', 'much', 'strength', 'fought', 'Sinatra', 'different', 'work', 'ethics', 'would', 'cause', 'LOT', 'friction', 'set', 'created', 'series', 'powerful', 'visual', 'statements', 'most', 'especially', 'tense', 'carnival', 'finale', 'film', ""n't"", ""'top"", 'drawer', 'Minnelli', 'indelibly', 'work', 'one', 'most', 'productive', 'periods', 'career.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'bordering', 'unabashed', 'hero', 'worship', 'Sinatra', 'wish', 'LONG', 'interview', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'suspect', 'LOT', 'stories', 'Sinatra', 'Martin', 'production', 'Came', 'Running', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'critical', 'success', 'when', 'released', '1958', 'film', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'years', 'not', 'everyone', ""'cup"", 'tea', 'certainly', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",Some Came Running VHS

327924,ANEZJYKUDNJYQ,6302682630,Jack Rice,"[27, 32]","This is one of the most heart-rending films I have ever seen. There are many levels in this story of the returning soldier, Dave Hirsh: his conflict with his brother, with his community, with his beloved and with himself. But for me, the most poignant is the story of Dave Hirsh (Frank Sinatra) and Ginny Moorhead (Shirley Maclaine). Dave is searching for redemption; he is emotionally needy and spiritually enervated. He thinks he can find love in someone who can fill his creative needs and the void in his heart created by the war.Here is the tragedy: Dave does not realize that real love can only come from a sense of self worth, from finding someone whom he not only needs but, just as important, who needs him. Ginny is an angel, an angel in the form of a wrong-side-of-the-tracks bimbo; but of all those in Dave's world, Ginny is the purest of heart and the purest in love, and her love is for Dave.

327928,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302682630,Only-A-Child,"[12, 14]","At 1200+ pages the James Jones novel ""Some Came Running"" deals with family divisions, drinking, gambling, sexual repression, adultery and other small town USA vices. All this is embedded in a general theme about the hypocrisy so pervasive in 1948 Middle America.Jones was most famous for his explorations of WWII and its aftermath. ""Some Came Running"" is somewhat autobiographical as Jones was one of those returning soldiers from WWII whose long absence gave them a new perspective on details in the social fabric that they had not really noticed before. He was from a small town in Illinois and served in the 25th Infantry Division. He was present during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the battle of Guadalcanal. Basing ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Thin Red Line on his experiences.The film adaptation of ""Some Came Running"" is long but entertaining, especially if you like seeing a lot of big-name stars. Despite its setting in a small town (it was filmed in Madison, Indiana) this was a big budget epic picture.The Jones character is named Dave Hirsch and played by Frank Sinatra. He is a successful writer but has not written anything for several years. The film begins inside a bus on its way to Dave's hometown of Parkman, Indiana. He has just been discharged from the army and is wearing his uniform (no rank insignia is visible).His brother Frank (Arthur Kennedy) has become a big shot in the town and introduces him to Gwen French (Martha Hyer), a college literature teacher who is impressed with his writing but put off by his wild life style. Dave has been followed to Parkton by Ginny (Shirley MacLaine), an airhead he met in a Chicago bar. This sets up the film's love triangle.Dave becomes friends with a local gambler named Bama Dillert (Dean Martin), moves into his house, and pairs up with him on the regional poker circuit where they are very successful.While Dave tries to come to terms with his roots and with his future, his brother Frank begins an affair with his secretary.Generally speaking, adopting a 1200 page book to the screen is ill advised and ""Some Came Running"" is no exception, if only because the screenwriter incorporated too much of the story for a feature length film to handle effectively.But the producers compounded this problem with the hiring Vincente Minnelli as director and by casting for box office draw instead of acting talent. This resulted in a film with slick production values, an extremely thin plot, lots of characters (but none with any depth), and a too long running time. Can you say flat, lifeless, prosaic, and unconvincing?Minnelli was a freak about visual details. He was more interested in whether an actress' dress coordinated well with the wallpaper in the set than how the actress handled her character. The inexperienced MacLaine has commented on how the only guidance she received during filming was from her male co-stars. In fact it was Sinatra who insisted the film end differently than the book as a way to make MacLaine's character more memorable. Minnelli's lack of interest in acting for the camera made him an especially poor choice for an overloaded film that needed subtle and nuanced elements in each scene to flesh out the characterization.For the same reason, a non-actor like ""one-take"" Sinatra was completely over-matched by the demands of playing his character. Sinatra was comfortable playing himself in front of the camera and in most of his roles this was more than satisfactory, as it is during the early stages of ""Some Came Running"". But things start to crash and burn with the start of his scenes with Hyer, and the film essentially collapses the first time he reveals that he loves her.Because of time constraints this romance had to be compressed, requiring a really skilled performance to set up things for the declaration of love, if it is to be at all convincing. Even if Sinatra took direction well (he didn't) and even if Minnelli was a master of acting for the camera (few were worse), the sudden transformation from Sinatra to lovesick puppy would have been a difficult sell.A very interesting element of this film is Minnelli's obsession with the sets and the moving camera. There are no close-ups and relatively few medium shots. Almost everything is a wide shot or the master shot itself. This could reflect Minnelli's overriding interest in showcasing his sets, or indicate that Sinatra's work habits made changing camera setups difficult, or that the editor found that many of the performances could not withstand close scrutiny. Whatever the cause, it makes it much more difficult to identify and connect with characters who are always so distant from the camera. This is a detail you may want to watch for the next time you see the film.This was Dean Martin's signature performance and he is truly excellent. Arthur Kennedy won an Oscar for his portrayal of Frank Hirsh but I think the best performance of all was by Leora Dane as his wife Agnes. Their scenes together have real energy, and almost creepy believability.Then again, what do I know?

327929,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,6302682630,Peter Baklava,"[0, 1]","""Some Came Running"" is regarded by some as a kind of sequel to ""From Here to Eternity"".  In this movie, the disillusioned soldier/writer returns to his hometown, trying to square his creative impulses with his dissolute lifestyle.As with Montgomery Clift's character in ""A Place in the Sun"",  Frank Sinatra's down-at-the-mouth character in this film faces a choice between an educated, upper-class, beautiful woman (Martha Hyer) and a good-hearted but dumb girl (Shirley MacLaine) who desperately wants to get married.A Fifties melodrama in the mode of ""Peyton Place"", the main appeal of this moderately entertaining film for me was some brief but enchanting glimpses of a thriving small town (Madison, Indiana) as Sinatra rolls in on a gleaming Greyhound bus in the beginning of the story, past a huge old Rexall drugstore.  There are also some great scenic views of the Ohio river, near which Hyer's character resides in relative cultural splendor:  a house with so many books that they spill over into the kitchen.  Unfortunately, Hyer's teacher is neurotic enough that she still lives with her father (what's he supposed to be, ""Prospero""?).Everything about this film is a little ""over-the-top"".  Some of the dialogue is pretty pathetic, with  lines such as Sinatra's when he exits a bar:  ""Take this dough and buy yourself a quonset hut.""  It must have passed as hip at the time.  Plus, Elmer Bernstein's musical score is a cluttered paste-up of cliches, from the swaggering horns that accompany Sinatra's barroom visits, to the Delilah-like strains of the flute which adorn a scene where Sinatra loosens Hyer's hair.Director Vincent Minnelli makes effective use of color in this movie, particularly in the final scene of the street carnival.  And Shirley MacLaine does a wonderful job with her ""Shelly Winters"" role. ( By the way, it was Sinatra who suggested the final fate of MacLaine's character... telling Minnelli that it would ""make the kid more sympathetic"".  So, strangely enough, Sinatra had an unseen hand in the acclaim that MacLaine reaped for her performance.)There probably is a correlation between this film and the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, such as ""All That Heaven Allows"".  But Sirk's movies are much more subversive.

327935,AB8MSE5JHEG97,6302682630,Thomas Plotkin,"[46, 49]","To the untrained eye this 1958 Vincente Minnelli MGM melodrama looks like an excerise in Rat Pack sleaze, as it stars Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Shirley MacLaine at the summit of their ring-a-ding-ding hijinks. Don't be fooled -- this movie is absolutley dead serious, even as it flies as luridly over the top as the last act of a bel canto opera. Based on James (From Here to Eternity) Jones' unreadable novel, story tells of Dave Hersch (Sinatra), a just de-mobilized World War Two vet and novelist who returns to his small mid-Western hometown of Parkman, Ill. Hersch apparently was a troubled delinquent after being orphaned as a teen, and eventually his older brother (Arthur Kennedy) stuck him in an orphanage. Dave ran away, and this is his first time back in years. He had published some fiction with mixed success before the war, and now he's blocked and trying to figure out his next move. His brother, who is now owner of the local bank and a pillar of the community, is terrified Dave is a)out for some kind of revenge and b)will do something to bring scandal down on his good name. Parkman, incidentally, is the kind of white-picket fence churchgoing place where every pillar of the community family man harbors a drinking problem, a mistress, and teenage kids who are veering towards delinquency.As the older brother correctly feared, Dave has grown up to be a tough, cynical, hard-drinking womanizer who trouble usually follows, and as soon as he arrives in pastoral Parkman, he gravitates to the Wrong Side of the Tracks, sleazy downtown taverns where professional gambler 'Bama Dillard (Dino) hold court, surrounded by the local working-girls (MacLaine being the most outrageously trashy and dumb -- but with a heart of gold and an indescribable wardrobe). Dave spends his nights drowning in dissolute behavior with the Pack, and his days trying to hammer out a novel, under the watchful eye of the frigid yet beautiful local patroness of the arts (Martha Hyer), who sees in Dave a new Thomas Wolfe. The suspicion soon arises that Dave has only started writing again to see if he can meet the challenge of getting the 40-year old virgin into bed.It is not long before the three worlds Dave attempts to integrate -- the country club world of his  brother, Dino's sleazy dives, and Hyer's isolated writer's workshop/mansion/sexless life of the mind -- create only conflicts that messes up everyone in the town of Parkman.Dave's conflict between the life of the artist and his attraction to the working class lower depths pre-figures Jack Nicholson's similar conflict in Five Easy Pieces over a decade later.Except this isn't the ersatz Antonioni-world of Pieces; this is a full-blown technicolor melodrama with a fabulous Elmer Bernstein score, that puts the ""opera"" back in soap opera. Best described as somewhere between Peyton Place and Blue Velvet, Some Came Running belongs to the melodrama subgenre of ""Let's look beneath the placid suburban surface and see what maggots crawl out."" A very prevalent theme in '50's cinema (see the works of Douglas Sirk), I believe this genre was the descendant of '40's noir, as it allowed subversive film-makers to illustrate the moral and sexual hypocracies of our ""straightest"" communities and citizens, thus prefiguring 1960's concerns in the supposedly placid Eisenhower era. ""Some Came Running"" is of particular interest in that it deploys the sleazy mores and manners of the town's underclass to critique the respectable citizens of Parkman.Director Minelli, known for his studio-bound, arty musicals, made the decision to shoot on location in a small Indiana town; yet the movie's deranged lighting, elaborate set-dressing and color palette(the bars are eyeball searing infernal visions in red and green neon reminiscent of the joint in Fire Walk With Me),over-the-top performances and wall-to-wall music defeat naturalism. While dramatically a tad aimless (the book its based on is as long as War & Peace, no joke)""Some Came Running"" is perhaps the most visually sumptuous of '50's melodramas -- Visconti comes to the Midwest. And the climax -- a nearly wordless dance of death at a garish night-time carnival -- is a classic Minelli set-piece, an inversion of his trademark musical numbers, representing a nightmare rather than a dream. Where Minnelli's first great musical, ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" lyrically waxed nostaligic about midwestern small town virtues, ""Some Came Running"" luridly lingers over midwestern smalltown vices without a hint of nostalgia or sentiment.This is a fascinating period piece, doubly interesting to see the aesthete Minelli wallow in sleaze. And Frank and Dino turn in solid in-character performances, and don't sing a note. MacLaine's trashy B-Girl, who loves Dave unconditionally even as he treats her like a doormat, is both bravely over-the-top and very poignant, the most memorable of the gallery of prostitutes she typically played in her early career.Finally, if you're a fan of 50's -early '60's long-take,Cinemascope/Technicolor mise-en-scene, all eye-popping color, oddball camera angles, and cluttered compositions, this is really one of the finest examples, the kind of thing that routinely sent Jean-Luc Godard into raptures when he was a critic at Cahiers du Cinema. It looks like a Renaissance fresco, a style that has been lost in our post-TV/CGI stylistic era.",5,The Prodigal Son Returns....,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,5378,"['untrained', 'eye', '1958',

327936,A1MKC6KH1YK6IA,6302682630,VERTIGOstrawberries,"[0, 0]","Glad to find commentary here addressing director Vincente Minelli's contributions. He was not only acclaimed fo his successful musicals in the 1940s and early 1950s ('Meet Me in St. Louis,' 1944; 'An American in Paris,' 1951; 'The Band Wagon,' 1953; 'Brigadoon,' 1954) but also for dramas in the 1950s ('The Bad and the Beautiful' 1952; 'Lust for Life,' 1956; 'Tea and Sympathy,' 1956).After the musicals that were his fort&eacute; fell out of favor with audiences around the time of his Oscar winning 'Gigi' (1958) came out, Minelli still made very creditable work for MGM in comedy ('Designing Woman,' 1957, 'The Reluctant Debutante,' 1958, 'Bells Are Ringing,' 1960, 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father' 1963) others less so ('Goodbye Charlie,' 1964). But there was little to choose from in drama, so that he was assigned his share of potboilers ('The Cobweb,' 1955, 'Home from the Hill,' 1960; 'Two Weeks in Another Town,' 1962; 'The Sandpiper,' 1965); and yet, professional that he was, he rescued those otherwise forgettable movies from the tawdry with panache, and it is that touch of Minnelli's that make them watchable, if admittedly dated for contemporary audiences. Such is the case with 'Some Came Running,' 1958.At the very beginning of the movie, a bus approaches Dave Hirsch's  home town in Indiana. Elmer Bernstein's movie score envelops us as we become aware of Dave (Sinatra), fast asleep in one of the seats. Through the melodramatic conclusion, as we follow a not-at-all unconventional narrative we are made to care about the characters, lead and secondary, flawed or virtuous, which always was Minelli's concern: that no one character is ever neglected. We see how understanding he is of Martha Hyer's straightlaced values or of the wonderful Ginny Moorehead (Shirley MacLaine). Sinatra's performance might not be too far from own experience but very creditable indeed, as are those of most others, particularly Dean Martin as 'Bama (""You know, ever since you've been seein' that schoolteacher, you've become im-possible?"" or some such.) Given that the scriptwriters are working from a James Jones novel ('From Here To Eternity'; 'The Thin Red Line'), you know that Minnelli is the artist to make it work. Truly underrated now, but not so to those of us who were fortunate enough to follow this director's career.

327937,A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9,6302682630,"Wayne Engle ""Wayne Engle""","[4, 4]","Like L. Schafer and Dennis Welsh, I am from Madison, IN, where this movie was filmed, so that's one big reason I'm very fond of it. I was 13 at the time of filming, and well remember the excitement of having ""big stars"" in our town and of kids my age being selected as extras. I also remember stories of how Sinatra and Martin often disappeared from town in a chauffeured limousine to go up the Ohio River to Newport, Ky., gamble and seek female companionship; and how Sinatra made himself thoroughly disliked by frequent drunkenness and generally acting like a jerk while he was here.The powers that be in Madison didn't do too well by their town, either, however, as they cautioned MGM to keep the wages paid to local extras low; can't get our hoi polloi to thinking they deserve decent pay, now can we?But having said that, I'll add that the film is a great experience for those who want to see how people dressed, talked and lived in the late 1950s. In my case (I'm a retired newspaper reporter), it's one of the few convincing explorations I've seen of how writers tend to act and think, and some of the problems we face with putting our thoughts to paper, getting them published, and all the while feeling that our stuff is really, truly no good.Sinatra as Dave Hirsh may seem at first to be walking through his role as the frustrated, alcoholic author, but repeated viewings of the picture will reveal that his performance is far more subtle and complicated than it first appears. Watch his facial expressions and body language, and they'll often tell you volumes.Martin as Bama Dillert is brilliant. His repeated derogatory comments about women have earned him condemnation as a misogynist in reviews of recent years, but they fit perfectly with his character and the mores of the times.Of course Shirley MacLaine as Ginny Moorhead is charming, delightful and tragic, all at once. Sinatra suggested a change in the climactic scene of the film to give a boost to the then-young MacLaine's career -- a generous act on his part.Arthur Kennedy is sometimes just a hair over the top as Dave Hirsh's successful but frustrated older brother, Frank. But he also furnishes some of the film's best moments of subtle, unintended humor.It's a good flick, folks, well worth seeing. And if you're from Madison and too young to remember the filming, some exterior scenes will show you what our town looked like, circa 1958.",5,"Great story, and 1950s time capsule",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,2416,"['L.', 'Schafer', 'Dennis', 'Welsh', 'am', 'Madison', 'IN', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'one', 'big', 'reason', ""'m"", 'very', 'fond', 'was', '13', 'time', 'filming', 'well', 'remember', 'excitement', 'having', 'big', 'stars', 'town', 'kids', 'age', 'being', 'selected', 'extras', 'also', 'remember', 'stories', 'how', 'Sinatra', 'Martin', 'often', 'disappeared', 'town', 'chauffeured', 'limousine', 'go', 'up', 'Ohio', 'River', 'Newport', 'Ky.', 'gamble', 'seek', 'female', 'companionship', 'how', 'Sinatra', 'made', 'thoroughly', 'disliked', 'frequent', 'drunkenness', 'generally', 'acting', 'jerk', 'was', 'here.The', 'powers', 'be', 'Madison', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'town', 'either', 'however', 'cautioned', 'MGM', 'keep', 'wages', 'paid', 'local', 'extras', 'low', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'thinking', 'deserve', 'decent', 'pay', 'now', 'can', 'having', 'said', ""'ll"", 'add', 'film', 'great', 'experience', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'dressed', 'talked', 'lived', 'late', '1950s', 'case', ""'m"", 'retired', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'one', 'few', 'convincing', 'explorations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'how', 'writers', 'tend', 'act', 'think', 'problems', 'face', 'putting', 'thoughts', 'paper', 'getting', 'published', 'while', 'feeling', 'stuff', 'really', 'truly', 'good.Sinatra', 'Dave', 'Hirsh', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'be', 'walking', 'role', 'frustrated', 'alcoholic', 'author', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'picture', 'will', 'reveal', 'performance', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'complicated', 'first', 'Watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', ""'ll"", 'often', 'tell', 'volumes.Martin', 'Bama', 'Dillert', 'brilliant', 'repeated', 'derogatory', 'comments', 'women', 'have', 'earned', 'condemnation', 'misogynist', 'reviews', 'recent', 'years', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'character', 'mores', 'times.Of', 'course', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Ginny', 'Moorhead', 'charming', 'delightful', 'tragic', 'once', 'Sinatra', 'suggested', 'change', 'climactic', 'scene', 'film', 'give', 'boost', 'then-young', 'MacLaine', 'career', 'generous', 'act', 'part.Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'sometimes', 'just', 'hair', 'top', 'Dave', 'Hirsh', 'successful', 'frustrated', 'older', 'brother', 'Frank', 'also', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'subtle', 'unintended', 'humor.It', 'good', 'flick', 'folks', 'well', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'Madison', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'filming', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'will', 'show', 'what', 'town', 'looked', 'circa', '1958']",Some Came Running VHS
