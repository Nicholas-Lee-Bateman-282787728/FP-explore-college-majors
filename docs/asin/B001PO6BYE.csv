Yes, I voted for him (often). Each week on AGT he seem to just get better and better. In the semi-final I knew he could carry a one hour Vegas show with this puppets. I was so happy that he won and am now very happy to own the DVD of his Vegas show with te behind-the-scenes story of his career.Fator is not a flash-in-the-pan who got lucky to win AGT. For years (decades) he has worked very hard to develop his skills and show. AGT was a great platform for him to mature and gain a following on a national scale. I am so happy for his success and hope to see him live at the Mirage on my next visit to Vegas.The DVD is well crafted and the live performance nicely shot. I specially enjoyed they left in a ""long blooper"" where he made a mistake in a complex dialog and to watch him recover from it. The Vegas show is fun to watch and a great showcase of his talent. Perhaps even more than the show itself, I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes which documented his career to date. Wow! He has worked so hard to get to this point!I do recommend this DVD.

While I am impressed with his singing ability and thoroughly enjoyed his characters, I felt that the show was somewhat rushed and the individual puppets weren't really given much time to strut their stuff. His vocal abilities in imitation well known singers is amazing. His Aaron Neville was dead on. Yes, the Michael Jackson bit was quite stupid and probably should be pulled from his act, due to the singers death, but that was really the only bit that didn't work. Jeff Dunham does much the same type of act, but he lets his characters develope and get much more of an edge to them.

1227824,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001PO6BYE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[10, 11]","Given, I'm pretty much hells to the no! when it comes to television reality shows. But a buddy said to check out this guy Terry Fator on YouTube, and so I did and was promptly flabbergasted (YouTube also clued me in to Cas Haley, an amazing singer, so maybe I'm missing out on America's Got Talent). Anyway, I knew I was getting this DVD once I heard about it.For a guy whose main shtick, on the surface, is puppets, Terry Fator keeps you avidly tuned in for 71 minutes worth of show. But that's because there's much more to his act than just puppets. Dude is a capable ventriloquist, an uncanny impersonator, and a damn good singer. Add to that the fact that he doesn't pepper his act with the usual bland crop of puppet jokes. Oh, he does have puppet jokes, but I thought they were quite clever and very funny.If you've caught his stuff on America's Got Talent, then you'll be familiar with several of his puppets and that these puppets do impersonations of famous singers. Okay, the pre-show gimmick is lame (Terry goes looking all over the Mirage casino for his missing puppets). But then Emma Taylor starts off the actual show with an awesome rendition of Etta James's ""At Last"" (the same song which wowwed the A.G.T. judges in Terry's audition). Winston the Impersonating Turtle, Terry's second favorite puppet, shows up and, of course, it's not a show without Winston singing ""What A Wonderful World"" as Kermit the Frog in a duet with Terry who also doubles as Louis Armstrong. But Terry's favorite puppet is actually that there cowboy dummy Walter T. Airdale. One of the best laughs happens when Terry Fator, gigged out as Michael Jackson, does a duet with the less-than-enthused Walter T. Airdale (who uneasily states: ""Wait, somethin' - somethin' ain't right up here"").Other puppets are introduced - and Fator lends all of these with their own unique voices - the most outrageous of which is Viccki the Cougar (and I don't mean a cat!). I didn't catch any profanity being dropped in the show, but get yourself ready for some raunchy bits and some serious innuendo. Surprisingly, there's a smattering of shock value injected here and there. That's another thing I liked about Terry Fator's act, that it has bite and also that the jokes just aren't one-offs. There's an internal consistency to the humor, the gags extending naturally from Terry's ability to set up his puppets' characters and backstories. But, yeah, Terry does push the envelope juuust a tad, with the cougar routine and also when he introduces Julius, the exuberant black puppet. The Michael Jackson bit was taped before Michael's death, and so, to reflect this, there's an appeasing ""Please don't hate"" sort of note inserted in the DVD case.And just to prove that he can actually carry a tune without hiding behind a dummy, he sings a few songs, propless. One of these songs happens to be ""I Started A Joke,"" which I really appreciate because that's one of my favorite Bee Gees songs and Terry is perfectly on point with the voice impersonation.The DVD to TERRY FATOR: LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS comes with two audio commentaries: one with Terry Fator, writer Rick Kerns, and director Mark Goffman; the other with Terry Fator and his puppet voices. Also included is a mini-book reprinting Chapter 1 of Terry's autobiography WHO'S THE DUMMY NOW?If you like ventriloquist's puppets mimicking folks like Elvis, Roy Orbison, Aaron Neville, Marvin Gaye, Brooks & Dunn, the Bee Gees, and even Kermit the Frog (and the cougar covers the Pussycat Dolls' ""Don't Cha"")... And if you dig stage assistants who are drop dead smoking hot... If you like being entertained by a remarkable, offbeat, and unique Vegas act (and, sorry, but Jeff Dunham's puppets can't sing or impersonate famous singers)... well, yeah, get your paws on this one.

He's done pretty well for himself.  My recent viewing of this DVD was the first time I'd seen Terry since his AGT win.  He's looking very fit and obviously having a great time as the master of his own theatre show at the Mirage.  Maybe it's just the vibe of Las Vegas rubbing off, but Terry's act has gotten fairly raunchy at the Mirage.  Still mild by Vegas standards, but the innuendos, and the crotch-grabbing that is an integral part of his Michael Jackson impersonation make this set definitely not kid-friendly.  Just a heads up to parents who might feel comfortable screening Jeff Dunham around the house--Terry does strictly adult-oriented puppetry these days.That said, I was reminded of his dizzingly well-rounded skills.  Terry is a vocal chameleon who can channel any number of well-known singers in the higher vocal range.  That is actually the part of his act I enjoy the most.  He is a proficient ventriloquist, but I find the personality of his puppets lacking in comparison to Jeff Dunham's, and they are much more simply-constructed.  One drawback to Terry's style is that he doesn't have as much back-and-forth interaction with his puppets as Dunham, since he 'sings' full songs rather than having more dialogue.  I would like to see more interaction with them, as he usually is just standing there while they 'sing'.  Also, in what appears to be a huge theatre, the puppets are often featured in extreme close-up.  Off camera, Terry could be moving his mouth and we, the viewing audience wouldn't have a clue.  It must be very challenging for the theatre audience much past the first few rows to see much.  Ventriloquism is better-suited to a more intimate stage.  Since he's got a big space, Terry should create more variety in the types of actions the puppets are doing.Really, a highlight for me was when Terry stepped out from behind his puppets to sing an early Bee Gees tune as himself.  I'd rather watch Terry sing Roy Orbison than watch the Elvis-impersonating puppet who can't sing Elvis sing Roy Orbison.  A few of the skits went on a little too long for the limits of good taste, including an awkward Michael Jackson number and a flat-out bizarre one where Terry made a huge man from the audience into a life-sized Cher doll.  That verged a little too much in the weird direction for me.Terry is a fantastic talent.  If he'd tone down some of the humor and make the puppets a bit more active, I could see him with a variety hour on television.  That would really be an ideal outlet for his gifts.",3,Terry's Terrific But This Set's a Little Cheesy,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,2718,"['rest', 'America', 'watched', 'Terry', 'Fator', 'puppet', 'crew', 'win', 'Season', '2', 'America', 'Got', 'Talent', 'rooted', 'excessively', 'deserving', 'winner', 'parlay', 'great', 'career', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'recent', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Terry', 'AGT', 'win', 'looking', 'very', 'fit', 'obviously', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'master', 'own', 'theatre', 'show', 'Mirage', 'Maybe', 'just', 'vibe', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'rubbing', 'off', 'Terry', 'act', 'gotten', 'fairly', 'raunchy', 'Mirage', 'Still', 'mild', 'Vegas', 'standards', 'innuendos', 'crotch-grabbing', 'integral', 'part', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'impersonation', 'make', 'set', 'definitely', 'not', 'kid-friendly', 'Just', 'heads', 'up', 'parents', 'who', 'might', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'screening', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'house', 'Terry', 'strictly', 'adult-oriented', 'puppetry', 'said', 'was', 'reminded', 'dizzingly', 'well-rounded', 'skills', 'Terry', 'vocal', 'chameleon', 'who', 'can', 'channel', 'number', 'well-known', 'singers', 'higher', 'vocal', 'range', 'actually', 'part', 'act', 'enjoy', 'most', 'proficient', 'ventriloquist', 'find', 'personality', 'puppets', 'lacking', 'comparison', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'simply-constructed', 'One', 'drawback', 'Terry', 'style', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'back-and-forth', 'interaction', 'puppets', 'Dunham', 'full', 'songs', 'rather', 'having', 'more', 'dialogue', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'interaction', 'usually', 'just', 'standing', 'there', ""'sing"", 'Also', 'what', 'be', 'huge', 'theatre', 'puppets', 'are', 'often', 'featured', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'Off', 'camera', 'Terry', 'could', 'be', 'moving', 'mouth', 'viewing', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'theatre', 'audience', 'much', 'first', 'few', 'rows', 'see', 'much', 'Ventriloquism', 'better-suited', 'more', 'intimate', 'stage', 'got', 'big', 'space', 'Terry', 'should', 'create', 'more', 'variety', 'types', 'actions', 'puppets', 'are', 'doing.Really', 'highlight', 'was', 'when', 'Terry', 'stepped', 'out', 'puppets', 'sing', 'early', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'tune', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Terry', 'sing', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'watch', 'Elvis-impersonating', 'puppet', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'Elvis', 'sing', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'A', 'few', 'skits', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'limits', 'good', 'taste', 'including', 'awkward', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'number', 'flat-out', 'bizarre', 'one', 'where', 'Terry', 'made', 'huge', 'man', 'audience', 'life-sized', 'Cher', 'doll', 'verged', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'weird', 'direction', 'me.Terry', 'fantastic', 'talent', ""'d"", 'tone', 'down', 'humor', 'make', 'puppets', 'bit', 'more', 'active', 'could', 'see', 'variety', 'hour', 'television', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'ideal', 'outlet', 'gifts']",Terry Fator: Live from Las Vegas
