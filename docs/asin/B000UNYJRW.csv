Some real relationship issues are addressed and, while the plot line becomes implausible yet predictable before the whole thing is over, some scenes are actually nicely acted and very touching, and it's just a shame they're mostly outweighed by the mediocrity of rest of the film.

The relationship hits a rocky road when Glenn finds out that Adam is a Republican.  ""Gay Republican"" seems like an oxymoron to Glenn who just can't imagine why Adam would be affiliated with a political party that he perceives as homophobic and totally anti-Gay.But even after Glenn agrees to move beyond this anomaly and allows the relationship to continue, an even greater deal breaker occurs when Glenn thinks that Adam has stood him up on Valentine's Day. He goes to Adam's house with a beautiful bouquet of roses for their planned romantic date only to find out that Adam is not home.  Adam had actually left Glenn a message earlier that day to tell him why he couldn't keep the Valentine's Day date, but when the voice message was retrieved by Glenn's best friend and house mate it was all muffled due to a technical issue, so his roommate just deleted it without paying any attention to whom it was or mentioning it to Glenn.Assuming that Adam has dismissed him, Glenn winds up going out for the night depressed and in need of company, so he has a sexual tryst with an old ""booty buddy"". Subsequently, when Glenn finds out the actual reason why Adam couldn't keep their Valentine's Day date, Glenn is ridden with embarrassment, guilt, shame, and fear that Adam will never forgive him for not waiting to find out what really happened.Can their love triumph over all these difficult obstacles?  No more spoilers here, just a recommendation that you treat yourself to a viewing of this delightfully sweet romantic comedy.",5,The Best of  Matthew Montgomery,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2003,"['films', 'had', 'seen', 'prior', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'including', 'Gone', 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'Redwoods', 'Role', 'Play', 'etc.', 'down', 'favorite', 'just', 'record', 'not', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Montgomery', 'lol', 'spot', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'man', 'tired', 'shallow', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'hungry', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'Glenn', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'soulmate', 'Adam', 'Windham', 'Beacham', 'personal', 'ad', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'road', 'when', 'Glenn', 'out', 'Adam', 'Republican', 'Gay', 'Republican', 'oxymoron', 'Glenn', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'Adam', 'would', 'be', 'affiliated', 'political', 'party', 'homophobic', 'totally', 'anti-Gay.But', 'even', 'Glenn', 'move', 'anomaly', 'relationship', 'continue', 'even', 'greater', 'deal', 'breaker', 'when', 'Glenn', 'Adam', 'stood', 'up', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Adam', 'house', 'beautiful', 'bouquet', 'roses', 'planned', 'romantic', 'date', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'Adam', 'not', 'home', 'Adam', 'had', 'actually', 'left', 'Glenn', 'message', 'earlier', 'day', 'tell', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'date', 'when', 'voice', 'message', 'was', 'retrieved', 'Glenn', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'mate', 'was', 'muffled', 'due', 'technical', 'issue', 'roommate', 'just', 'deleted', 'paying', 'attention', 'whom', 'was', 'mentioning', 'Glenn.Assuming', 'Adam', 'dismissed', 'Glenn', 'up', 'going', 'night', 'depressed', 'need', 'company', 'sexual', 'tryst', 'old', 'booty', 'buddy', 'Subsequently', 'when', 'Glenn', 'out', 'actual', 'reason', 'why', 'Adam', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'date', 'Glenn', 'ridden', 'embarrassment', 'guilt', 'shame', 'fear', 'Adam', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'not', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened.Can', 'love', 'triumph', 'difficult', 'obstacles', 'more', 'spoilers', 'here', 'just', 'recommendation', 'treat', 'viewing', 'delightfully', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy']",Long-Term Relationship

I liked it from the start, despite the lead being Matthew Montgomery from Gone But Not Forgotten (I didn't like him in that).  Yes this is my favourite kind of story folks the gay love story.  And it is.  It has moments to sigh for...moments to laugh for...moments that make you go ""What the hell are you thinking doofus...""  Glenn is not having fun in the gay scene and accidentally comes across an ad his flatmate was going to answer, enter the cute southern boy Adam who seems too good to be true.  And he is because he is...(wait for it, it is scary)...a Republican.  Now as a New Zealander that means nothing to me so it is an ooookkkkkk moment. What I like in this is that for the loving couple who take time before consumating the relationship, the sex is crap.  But they perservere and continue to date and try to have good sex.  Glenn likes sex toys, Adam not so much (well at all).  So that doesn't work despite Adam 'adapting'.  What is interesting is that because Adam has to leave on Valentine's Day and Glenn doesn't get the message he sleeps with his sex-buddy - now is that likely?  I think not, but ok then, he does.  Glenn's flatmate is jealous and ruins it for them...accidentally??  But then fixes it, sort of helps really.  Anyway, happy ending - my favourite result.

For me, anyway. I think what I'm sensing in terms of the screwball comedies (Hepburn and Spencer Tracy or Cary Grant) is the comfort with gay characters and the willingness to present them as regular folks, like anyone else. And of course, there's the really tender angle characteristic of the more recent romance comedies (Richard Gere, Hugh Grant). If you want unrelenting camp, don't stop here. If you want things blowing up and people dying violent deaths right and left, don't stop here. But, if you want a romantic story well told, this is it.

1095416,AG7RTXB2YXWTL,B000UNYJRW,Linda Davis,"[1, 1]","I chose this movie because I admire Matthew Montgomery.  I have found his work enlightening about understanding the Gay community and the issues within.  Watching a younger Matthew was fascinating. Matthew&#8217;s expressive eyes convey the emotions experienced by the character; in this way, he provides greater depth and understanding.  He also exhibits the many small gestures /movements that are pure Matthew Montgomery. He has a unique way of making the character his own, and has refined this ability as his career advanced.  In this romantic-comedy, Matthew plays Glenn, a young Gay man unhappy with his life of sex without commitment.  Vincent (Jeremy Lucus), Glenn&#8217;s roommate, finds an ad in the personals of a man seeking a long-term relationship. Glenn contacts Adam (Windham Beacham) and thus begins their rocky road towards a relationship (which includes seemingly incompatible sex).  I was sad for Vincent in this movie, but life does not always provide happy endings for everyone in a given situation.  Additional supporting cast includes Artie O&#8217;Daley (Eli) and Chuti Tiu (Mary Margaret).

As this is the main premise of this movie, I felt it brought a fresh and candid approach to the romantic genre.Unfortunately, while dealing with the matter in a frank way, the resolution was never made clear.We experienced the failed attempts, the confidences shared with a parent, and the general knowledge of the situation by their friends.What we didn't discover was how the loving couple resolved the dilemma.Did they decide sex wasn't important, and decide to marry and enjoy their love and companionship instead ?  Did they decide sex was important, married and sought help with their problem ?No satisfactory answer is provided, unless you assume that marriage cures all and they lived happily ever after.This is a brave film that tackled a real issue but delivered no real answers.  Maybe that is expecting too much from what some may feel is essentially a romantic comedy, but I feel if the writer makes this the main premise of the film he has a responsibility to provide a more real-life resolution.  Is it enough to merely raise the issue ?I'm giving this 4 stars for the premise and congratulate the film makers for taking on a subject that has affected most adults at some time in their life (sexual incompatability).I'm disappointed by other reviewers juvenile comments about FFN (grow up), but agree that some of the dialogue could have been a little more polished.
