1232283,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B001QWQJD8,Amanda,"[1, 1]","It's hard to know where to start with something like InuYasha. The series is famous for having massive amounts of filler, an overly dramatic love story and, most importantly, an enormous horde of crazy fangirls.Despite all of this, InuYasha, a self-proclaimed ""feudal fairytale,"" is still a fun, humorous, and highly entertaining anime that gives viewers something fresh and exciting to enjoy. Sadly, this is the last season of the anime version, while the original manga version lasted about twenty volumes past the ending point of the series. While the anime did its best to remain faithful to the original, this constantly led to large amounts of ""filler"" while the anime waited for the manga to catch up, and the fact that the manga was not yet concluded when the anime ended leaves the series incomplete and the ending unsatisfying.While this is not a fault of the anime itself, it most likely sprung from some kind of corporate issue at the studio producing the anime. They simply decided that enough was enough and that they could not wait around forever for the manga to end. Despite this setback, the final season of InuYasha still delivers non-stop action, entertaining characters, heart-wrenching drama, gut-busting humor, and a surprisingly unique approach for a shojo story.The episodes included here document the intense final battle with the evil demon Naraku, Kikyo's sudden return to the world of the living and InuYasha's continued rivalry with his half-brother Sesshomaru. The drama continues at every turn as the stakes become higher and the final shard of the sacred jewel seems to fall further into Naraku's hands.This Limited Deluxe Edition of season seven is truly the ultimate American fan edition of the series. It includes a limited edition InuYasha figurine (complete with Tetsusaiga), a special behind-the-scenes look at the show's finale featuring the Japanese cast, and a Q&A; with the English language voice actors.The set comes with four complete discs that feature episodes 147-167 of the anime. Viewers also have the option of watching the English dub or the original Japanese version with English subtitles.While purists will soak up the subtitled version, the English dub makes the series very accessible to more casual fans. The dub is also surprisingly well-done and the translation is very close to the original; there doesn't even seem to be any censorship in the anime's content. The English voice cast really did a wonderful job of portraying the characters, particularly InuYasha, Kagome, and Miroku.Even though this series tends to get a bad reputation because of its fans, it's really a fun series. It may take a little while to get past the uber-fandom and the howling fangirls, but if you can ignore all of that, InuYasha is a funny, entertaining, gut-wrenching drama with complex characters in a truly unique setting. Try to at least give it a chance -- you might just be surprised.",5,Ignore the fangirls...this series is great,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2931,"['hard', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'something', 'InuYasha', 'series', 'famous', 'having', 'massive', 'amounts', 'filler', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'love', 'story', 'most', 'importantly', 'enormous', 'horde', 'crazy', 'fangirls.Despite', 'InuYasha', 'self-proclaimed', 'feudal', 'fairytale', 'still', 'fun', 'humorous', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'viewers', 'something', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'enjoy', 'Sadly', 'last', 'season', 'anime', 'version', 'original', 'manga', 'version', 'lasted', 'twenty', 'volumes', 'ending', 'point', 'series', 'anime', 'did', 'best', 'remain', 'faithful', 'original', 'constantly', 'led', 'large', 'amounts', 'filler', 'anime', 'waited', 'manga', 'catch', 'up', 'fact', 'manga', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'concluded', 'when', 'anime', 'ended', 'series', 'incomplete', 'ending', 'unsatisfying.While', 'not', 'fault', 'anime', 'most', 'likely', 'sprung', 'kind', 'corporate', 'issue', 'studio', 'producing', 'anime', 'simply', 'decided', 'enough', 'was', 'enough', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'around', 'forever', 'manga', 'end', 'setback', 'final', 'season', 'InuYasha', 'still', 'non-stop', 'action', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'heart-wrenching', 'drama', 'gut-busting', 'humor', 'surprisingly', 'unique', 'approach', 'shojo', 'story.The', 'episodes', 'included', 'here', 'document', 'intense', 'final', 'battle', 'evil', 'demon', 'Naraku', 'Kikyo', 'sudden', 'return', 'world', 'living', 'InuYasha', 'continued', 'rivalry', 'half-brother', 'Sesshomaru', 'drama', 'turn', 'stakes', 'become', 'higher', 'final', 'shard', 'sacred', 'jewel', 'fall', 'further', 'Naraku', 'hands.This', 'Limited', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'season', 'seven', 'truly', 'ultimate', 'American', 'fan', 'edition', 'series', 'limited', 'edition', 'InuYasha', 'figurine', 'complete', 'Tetsusaiga', 'special', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'show', 'finale', 'featuring', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'Q', 'A', 'English', 'language', 'voice', 'actors.The', 'set', 'four', 'complete', 'discs', 'feature', '147-167', 'anime', 'Viewers', 'also', 'have', 'option', 'watching', 'English', 'dub', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles.While', 'purists', 'will', 'soak', 'up', 'subtitled', 'version', 'English', 'dub', 'series', 'very', 'accessible', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'dub', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'well-done', 'translation', 'very', 'close', 'original', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'censorship', 'anime', 'content', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'really', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'particularly', 'InuYasha', 'Kagome', 'Miroku.Even', 'series', 'get', 'bad', 'reputation', 'fans', 'really', 'fun', 'series', 'may', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'get', 'uber-fandom', 'howling', 'fangirls', 'can', 'ignore', 'InuYasha', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'gut-wrenching', 'drama', 'complex', 'characters', 'truly', 'unique', 'setting', 'Try', 'least', 'give', 'chance', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'surprised']",InuYasha: Seventh Season

The first disc contains six episodes, the second and third discs contain five episodes, and the fourth disc contains five episodes and the special features.Disc four contains four special features.  The first feature is a ""Textless Opening,"" which is essentially the opening that appears at the beginning of each episode, but this version doesn't have the text that covers the pictures.  The second feature is ""Textless Ending.""  However, instead of having a textless version of the ending that appears on this box set, it is a textless verion of an ending that appeared on one of the previous DVD box sets.The next special feature is labeled as ""The Finale With the Japanese Cast.""  This feature runs for about eight minutes.  It includes interviews with the Japanese voice actors for Inuyasha, Shippo, Sango, Miroku, Kagome, and Sesshomaru.  There is also some footage of the cast recording dialogue for the final episode.The last special feature on the disc is labeled as, ""Questions for the English Language Voice Actors.""  This feature runs for about eighteen minutes, and it was recorded at the wrap party for the English dub actors.  Unfortunately, with the feature being recorded at the wrap party, there's a lot of ambient noise in the background, which can make it hard to hear some of the voice actors when they're talking.  The English dub actors for Inuyasha, Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, Sango, and Koga are interviewed for this feature.If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.  Like the other Inuyasha box sets, this one retails for around $90.  I appreciate the fact that Viz Media included the interviews with the Japanese and English voice actors.

1232298,A1ZWMBUQW366CP,B001QWQJD8,"Occasional Reviewer ""Musician""","[69, 76]","Yes, this anime was over-hyped. Yes, the fanboyism was tough to stomach. Yes, it aired on adult swim. Inuyasha's popularity was tremendous...so tremendous, in fact, that there was bound to be a backlash in the otaku community. A considerably large reactionary anti-Inuyasha group arose within the community of anime fans which claimed that Inuyasha suffered from lame writing and bad animation. Well, guess what? It does...at times, anyway.That said, Inuyasha deserves its place on anime's top shelf. Why? Several reasons...first and foremost is the artistic vision of Rumiko Takahashi, the author of the original manga. Her vision, which the creators of the anime reproduced quite faithfully, paints a marvelous fantasy set in the feudal era of Japan. Blending Japanese mythology with images of both Buddhism and Shinto, Takahashi's vision is unparalleled in anime. This combined with her tight plotting, clever storyline and composer Kaoru Wada's first rate soundtrack make Inuyasha a true triumph in not only anime but in film altogether.Now for the negative...Inuyasha did suffer from logistical problems during its production. The creators of the anime wanted to reproduce Takahashi's manga faithfully and did just that--that is, until the anime caught up to the manga storyline. Then, the anime creators were forced to create ""filler"" episodes that had little impact on the central stories or characters until enough new manga material was released. This does grow tiresome but it shouldn't take anything away from any of Inuyasha's many marvelous episodes. Another problem is the anime's ending, or lack thereof. The fact is, the anime caught up to the manga once again and the creators decided that, rather than run the anime into the ground with another season of filler, they should pull the plug. Although this left many fans with a bitter taste in their mouths and pleased the haters, this actually was the right thing to do. The anime had been very faithful to the manga up until this point and the creators did not want to stray from that path, so they chose the path of artistic integrity and I, for one, am glad they did. This enabled the Inuyasha anime to end while it was still popular and also enabled it to retain its artistic sincerity. I have chosen to read the remaining manga (Inuyasha ran for a whopping 56 volumes!) to experience the rest of the story as Takahashi intended.In summation, don't believe the haters...Inuyasha really is a great anime and even though it has its flaws, if you really give it a chance, there is no reason why you couldn't enjoy it. I know that I will buy this seventh season when it is released--I purchased the first six, after all. ;)",5,In Defense of Inuyasha,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2690,"['Yes', 'anime', 'was', 'over-hyped', 'Yes', 'fanboyism', 'was', 'tough', 'stomach', 'Yes', 'aired', 'adult', 'swim', 'Inuyasha', 'popularity', 'was', 'tremendous', 'so', 'tremendous', 'fact', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'backlash', 'otaku', 'community', 'considerably', 'large', 'reactionary', 'anti-Inuyasha', 'group', 'arose', 'community', 'anime', 'fans', 'claimed', 'Inuyasha', 'suffered', 'lame', 'writing', 'bad', 'animation', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'times', 'said', 'Inuyasha', 'place', 'anime', 'top', 'shelf', 'Why', 'Several', 'reasons', 'first', 'foremost', 'artistic', 'vision', 'Rumiko', 'Takahashi', 'author', 'original', 'manga', 'vision', 'creators', 'anime', 'reproduced', 'quite', 'faithfully', 'marvelous', 'fantasy', 'set', 'feudal', 'era', 'Japan', 'Blending', 'Japanese', 'mythology', 'images', 'Buddhism', 'Shinto', 'Takahashi', 'vision', 'unparalleled', 'anime', 'combined', 'tight', 'plotting', 'clever', 'storyline', 'composer', 'Kaoru', 'Wada', 'first', 'rate', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'true', 'triumph', 'not', 'only', 'anime', 'film', 'altogether.Now', 'negative', 'Inuyasha', 'did', 'suffer', 'logistical', 'problems', 'production', 'creators', 'anime', 'wanted', 'reproduce', 'Takahashi', 'manga', 'faithfully', 'did', 'just', 'anime', 'caught', 'up', 'manga', 'storyline', 'Then', 'anime', 'creators', 'were', 'forced', 'create', 'filler', 'episodes', 'had', 'little', 'impact', 'central', 'stories', 'characters', 'enough', 'new', 'manga', 'material', 'was', 'released', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Inuyasha', 'many', 'marvelous', 'episodes', 'problem', 'anime', 'ending', 'lack', 'thereof', 'fact', 'anime', 'caught', 'up', 'manga', 'once', 'again', 'creators', 'decided', 'rather', 'run', 'anime', 'ground', 'season', 'filler', 'should', 'pull', 'plug', 'left', 'many', 'fans', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouths', 'pleased', 'haters', 'actually', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'anime', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'faithful', 'manga', 'up', 'point', 'creators', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'stray', 'path', 'chose', 'path', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'enabled', 'Inuyasha', 'anime', 'end', 'was', 'still', 'popular', 'also', 'enabled', 'retain', 'artistic', 'sincerity', 'have', 'chosen', 'read', 'remaining', 'manga', 'Inuyasha', 'ran', 'whopping', '56', 'volumes', 'experience', 'rest', 'story', 'Takahashi', 'intended.In', 'summation', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'haters', 'Inuyasha', 'really', 'great', 'anime', 'even', 'flaws', 'really', 'give', 'chance', 'reason', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'know', 'will', 'buy', 'seventh', 'season', 'when', 'released', 'purchased', 'first', 'six']",InuYasha: Seventh Season

The series characters are memorable and grew on you with Kagome the young girl from the present time who falls into the mystical well on her families shrine into the feudal times of Japan,  Inu Yasha the half-demon who after a half century awaken when Kagome appears in the past and frees him from his sleep,  Miroku the lecherous monk whose family was cursed by the half-demon Naraku,  Sango whose whole village and family except her younger brother was killed by one of Naraku's plots and has as her companion a demon cat Kilala,  and finally Shippo the young fox demon whose father was killed by a pair of demons and meets up later with Kagome and Inu Yasha during his search to become more powerful.  Of course there's more to the series but you'll see that through the series and how these strangers slowly become friends to about family, you'll of course have the usual powerful enemy by the way of Naraku,  a older brother of Inu Yasha Seeshomaru who walks the path of being the groups ally/enemy,  and finally another enemy/ally as well as love interest Kikyo the dead priestess whose resurrected who Inu Yasha loved and was killed by Naraku and thinking that it was Inu Yasha that gave her the mortal wound imprisons him to a sacred tree.  The animation is great clear and detailed nicely,  and the voice cast for the Japanese subbed were great as well as the English dubbed.  So I know it's a little pricey but since this is the last season box and I know most as well as myself consider this series a great one to have I say complete collection you'll be very happy that you did...",5,The Finale Of This Great Anime Series Reaches It's Finale,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,2019,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'wonderful', 'series', 'beginning', 'end', ""'m"", 'still', 'entertained', 'time', 'watch', 'previous', 'episode', 'earlier', 'season.Even', 'anime', 'series', 'here', 'many', 'fans', 'know', 'manga', 'series', 'continued', 'while', 'longer', 'ending', 'series', 'last', 'year', 'truly', 'hope', 'creators', 'anime', 'series', 'are', 'able', 'continue', 'later', 'make', 'new', 'episodes', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'reach', 'manga', 'finale', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'grew', 'Kagome', 'young', 'girl', 'present', 'time', 'who', 'mystical', 'well', 'families', 'shrine', 'feudal', 'times', 'Japan', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'half-demon', 'who', 'half', 'century', 'awaken', 'when', 'Kagome', 'past', 'sleep', 'Miroku', 'lecherous', 'monk', 'family', 'was', 'cursed', 'half-demon', 'Naraku', 'Sango', 'whole', 'village', 'family', 'younger', 'brother', 'was', 'killed', 'one', 'Naraku', 'plots', 'companion', 'demon', 'cat', 'Kilala', 'finally', 'Shippo', 'young', 'fox', 'demon', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'pair', 'demons', 'up', 'later', 'Kagome', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'search', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'course', 'more', 'series', ""'ll"", 'see', 'series', 'how', 'strangers', 'slowly', 'become', 'friends', 'family', ""'ll"", 'course', 'have', 'usual', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'way', 'Naraku', 'older', 'brother', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'Seeshomaru', 'who', 'walks', 'path', 'being', 'groups', 'ally/enemy', 'finally', 'enemy/ally', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'interest', 'Kikyo', 'dead', 'priestess', 'resurrected', 'who', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'loved', 'was', 'killed', 'Naraku', 'thinking', 'was', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'gave', 'mortal', 'wound', 'imprisons', 'sacred', 'tree', 'animation', 'great', 'clear', 'detailed', 'nicely', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'were', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'dubbed', 'know', 'little', 'pricey', 'last', 'season', 'box', 'know', 'most', 'as', 'well', 'consider', 'series', 'great', 'one', 'have', 'say', 'complete', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'did']",InuYasha: Seventh Season
1232301,A1JN4ZJ3ZC4JOG,B001QWQJD8,Someone,"[3, 3]","If you're reading a review for the 7th season of Inuyasha, you're most likely a committed fan and don't need much convincing as to whether or not you'll want to own this set.And to clear up any doubts or confusion, there is most definitely an 8th season.  Episodes have already aired in Japan.  Do a google search or visit websites like Viz's, and see for yourself.As far as this season is concerned the price tag isn't justified, but I still enjoyed the episodes immensely.  The storyline moves the characters closer and closer to a final confrontation with Naraku, but the ending makes it absolutely clear that this will not be the end of the anime.  Not a single aspect of the plot is wrapped up.  And, as the announcement of Inuyasha the Final Act confirmed for me, nobody in their right mind possessing even the smallest shred of common sense would have allowed the anime series to simply end with episode 167 and the 4th movie.  But, there are still many things to appreciate about these episodes.  The storyline and plot progress in the same manner as fans have come to expect.  And what I found to be particularly enjoyable were the episodes dedicated to individual subplots such as the two episodes dedicated to a closer look at how Inuyasha and Kikyo met, the episode featuring flashbacks of Sango and Kohaku's past, the episode where Shippo unleashes his arsenal of fox-demon magic with great and humorous success against his opponents, or the episode where Kagome's friends finally meet Inuyasha.  Some people tend to label these as ""filler"" episodes.  But I've always found that regardless of whether or not certain episodes were drawn from the Mangas, they've always managed to give the viewer a more in-depth, and often humorous, look at the characters and who they are.  These episodes are no exception and help make the viewing experience entirely worthwhile.Hopefully, this will help any undecided buyers.  This isn't the end of the anime.  And this is most definitely a worthy addition to the Inuyasha saga.  I'm eagerly looking forward to the 8th season.",5,"Great Prelude for Season 8 (Yes, Season 8)",1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,2074,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'review', '7th', 'season', 'Inuyasha', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'committed', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'convincing', 'not', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'set.And', 'clear', 'up', 'doubts', 'confusion', 'most', 'definitely', '8th', 'season', 'Episodes', 'have', 'already', 'aired', 'Japan', 'Do', 'google', 'search', 'visit', 'websites', 'Viz', 'see', 'yourself.As', 'far', 'season', 'concerned', 'price', 'tag', ""n't"", 'justified', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'immensely', 'storyline', 'characters', 'closer', 'closer', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Naraku', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'anime', 'Not', 'single', 'aspect', 'plot', 'wrapped', 'up', 'announcement', 'Inuyasha', 'Final', 'Act', 'confirmed', 'nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'possessing', 'even', 'smallest', 'shred', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'anime', 'series', 'simply', 'end', 'episode', '167', '4th', 'movie', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'things', 'appreciate', 'episodes', 'storyline', 'plot', 'progress', 'same', 'manner', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'episodes', 'dedicated', 'individual', 'subplots', 'such', 'two', 'episodes', 'dedicated', 'closer', 'look', 'how', 'Inuyasha', 'Kikyo', 'met', 'episode', 'featuring', 'flashbacks', 'Sango', 'Kohaku', 'past', 'episode', 'where', 'Shippo', 'arsenal', 'fox-demon', 'magic', 'great', 'humorous', 'success', 'opponents', 'episode', 'where', 'Kagome', 'friends', 'finally', 'meet', 'Inuyasha', 'people', 'tend', 'label', 'filler', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'regardless', 'not', 'certain', 'episodes', 'were', 'drawn', 'Mangas', ""'ve"", 'always', 'managed', 'give', 'viewer', 'more', 'in-depth', 'often', 'humorous', 'look', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'exception', 'help', 'make', 'viewing', 'experience', 'entirely', 'worthwhile.Hopefully', 'will', 'help', 'undecided', 'buyers', ""n't"", 'end', 'anime', 'most', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Inuyasha', 'saga', ""'m"", 'eagerly', 'looking', 'forward', '8th', 'season']",InuYasha: Seventh Season
