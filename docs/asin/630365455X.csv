384274,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630365455X,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 12]","There are plenty of holiday family films that get it right.  In recent years I've enjoyed `The Family Stone' and `Pieces of April'.  `Home for the Holidays' just doesn't do it for me the way that these other films have.  I searched this film out mainly because I adore Robert Downey Jr. (such a major comeback) and I heard great things about his performance here.  That and the fact that Holly Hunter is always a delight (as are Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning) and I was seeking this film like a missile.  The film as a whole is not as great as its individual parts.The film is bogged down by too many clich&eacute;s.There was not a single original character in this film.  If that were the only issue then I could see still enjoying this film to a certain extent, but that is not the only issue I have with `Home for the Holidays'.  The film is littered with realistic conversations between family members, but unlike films by Woody Allen and or Robert Altman, Foster can't manage to make these seemingly natural situations appear `natural'.  These sequences come off more uncomfortable than anything else.  And then there are the less than impressive, slightly (often not slightly) over-the-top performances that tend to degrade the films credibility.More on those in a minute.The film revolves around single mom Claudia Larson who, day before Thanksgiving, finds herself jobless and traveling to visit her family.  Her daughter Kitt is staying behind to give herself to her boyfriend, and her eccentric brother Tommy (the only family member she gets along with) is reportedly `not' coming to the family dinner.  So, Claudia is a nervous wreck, aware of the fact that she will have to get through this weekend on her own.  Her parents, Henry and Adele, have all but lost their minds; her crazy Aunt Gladys has lost hers and her sister Joanne obviously harbors much resentment for Claudia, mainly because she doesn't know her yet has her all figured out (don't you hate people like that).  When Tommy surprises everyone with his presence (and a new guy in his life) the family is thrown up in arms as secrets are revealed, grudges are uncovered and fights ensue.I just wish that something, anything, felt fresh and or new.The films only saving grace at this point would be the acting, since the scripting is all over the place with its attempts at being meaningful (not all attempts succeed), but the acting never even really gets off the ground.  Holly Hunter, a very capable actress, suffers from a diluted script that never gives her character enough attention to grow.  She is left trying to be something more than the film allows her to be, and in the end she becomes rather boring.  The only scenes where she really excels are scenes where she is conversing with Downey Jr. (they actually make for very believable siblings) but that leads me to Downey Jr., who never really manages to pull off his performance as a whole.  He has his moments where he is charming and natural and graceful, but then he has his episodes where he is just downright obnoxious and unbearable (that whole car scene with the story of the snot was ridiculous).Dylan McDermott is a bland leading man; Claire Danes is barely there (even if she is naturally luminous); Steve Guttenberg tries, but fails; Geraldine Chaplin has a few funny scenes (and a stout revelation) but cannot elevate the film in any way.  Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning seem like a great pair for the whole mother/father team but they are stuck muddling through jokes and gags that are beneath them.  In fact, Cynthia Stevenson (from `According to Jim'!!!) is the only actor/actress here that actually manages to pull something beautiful off.  I just wish that her characters open-shut clich&eacute; wasn't so dominant.  She actually moved me in ways I never expected.So, if you want a sweet and touching family film that embraces the holiday spirit then you might want to look elsewhere.  `Home for the Holidays' has its moments, and it does try and capture the warmth of family, but it fails to really connect in a way that many other films can.  It loses many points for not even attempting to bring anything new to the table, but even through clich&eacute;s a film should be able to make a statement.  This film, sadly, does not.",2,Its lack of effort disappoints me...,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,4290,"['are', 'plenty', 'holiday', 'family', 'films', 'get', 'right', 'recent', 'years', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Family', 'Stone', 'Pieces', 'April', 'Home', 'Holidays', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'way', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'searched', 'film', 'mainly', 'adore', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'major', 'comeback', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'performance', 'here', 'fact', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'always', 'delight', 'are', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'was', 'seeking', 'film', 'missile', 'film', 'whole', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'individual', 'parts.The', 'film', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'not', 'single', 'original', 'character', 'film', 'were', 'only', 'issue', 'then', 'could', 'see', 'still', 'enjoying', 'film', 'certain', 'extent', 'not', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'Home', 'Holidays', 'film', 'littered', 'realistic', 'conversations', 'family', 'members', 'films', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Foster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'make', 'seemingly', 'natural', 'situations', 'appear', 'natural', 'sequences', 'come', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'anything', 'else', 'then', 'are', 'less', 'impressive', 'slightly', 'often', 'not', 'slightly', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'tend', 'degrade', 'films', 'credibility.More', 'minute.The', 'film', 'single', 'mom', 'Claudia', 'Larson', 'who', 'day', 'Thanksgiving', 'jobless', 'traveling', 'visit', 'family', 'daughter', 'Kitt', 'staying', 'give', 'boyfriend', 'eccentric', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'only', 'family', 'member', 'along', 'reportedly', 'not', 'coming', 'family', 'dinner', 'So', 'Claudia', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'aware', 'fact', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'weekend', 'own', 'parents', 'Henry', 'Adele', 'have', 'lost', 'minds', 'crazy', 'Aunt', 'Gladys', 'lost', 'hers', 'sister', 'Joanne', 'obviously', 'much', 'resentment', 'Claudia', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'figured', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'people', 'When', 'Tommy', 'everyone', 'presence', 'new', 'guy', 'life', 'family', 'thrown', 'up', 'arms', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'grudges', 'are', 'uncovered', 'fights', 'ensue.I', 'just', 'wish', 'something', 'anything', 'felt', 'fresh', 'new.The', 'films', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'acting', 'scripting', 'place', 'attempts', 'being', 'meaningful', 'not', 'attempts', 'succeed', 'acting', 'never', 'even', 'really', 'ground', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'very', 'capable', 'actress', 'suffers', 'diluted', 'script', 'never', 'character', 'enough', 'attention', 'grow', 'left', 'trying', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'film', 'be', 'end', 'rather', 'boring', 'only', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'excels', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'conversing', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'actually', 'make', 'very', 'believable', 'siblings', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'performance', 'whole', 'moments', 'where', 'charming', 'natural', 'graceful', 'then', 'episodes', 'where', 'just', 'downright', 'obnoxious', 'unbearable', 'whole', 'car', 'scene', 'story', 'snot', 'was', 'ridiculous', '.Dylan', 'McDermott', 'bland', 'leading', 'man', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'barely', 'even', 'naturally', 'luminous', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'tries', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'stout', 'revelation', 'can', 'not', 'elevate', 'film', 'way', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'seem', 'great', 'pair', 'whole', 'mother/father', 'team', 'are', 'stuck', 'muddling', 'jokes', 'gags', 'are', 'fact', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'According', 'Jim', 'only', 'actor/actress', 'here', 'actually', 'pull', 'something', 'beautiful', 'just', 'wish', 'characters', 'open-shut', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'dominant', 'actually', 'moved', 'ways', 'never', 'expected.So', 'want', 'sweet', 'touching', 'family', 'film', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Home', 'Holidays', 'moments', 'try', 'capture', 'warmth', 'family', 'really', 'connect', 'way', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'many', 'points', 'not', 'even', 'attempting', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'table', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'statement', 'film', 'sadly', 'not']",N/A

384281,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,630365455X,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 2]","I first saw ""Home for the Holidays"" when it was released on video in 1995. A small film, lovingly directed by Jodie Foster and blessed with an extraordinary cast, I was stunned by its frenetic charm. To this day I recommend it to friends, most of whom have never heard of it. Equal parts comedy and drama, ""Home for the Holidays"" covers the Larson family reunion on Thanksgiving day. The oldest daughter Claudia (Holly Hunter) is a single mom just fired from her job at an art gallery in Chicago. While en route to the airport, her teenage daughter (Claire Danes) reveals her plans to have sex for the first time while mom is away.That's just one of many subplots interwoven into this colorful tapestry, as Claudia lands in Baltimore in the arms of her parents, portrayed by the indelible Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft. Eventually, all family members arrive at the holiday table, including the homosexual son Tommy (Robert Downey, Jr.), his mysterious friend Leo (Dylan McDermott), the prudish sister Joanne with husband Walter (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) and eccentric Aunt Gladys (Geraldine Chaplin), a lonely soul with a taste for wine and impromptu recollections.As madcap as a Griswold family vacation, ""Home for the Holidays"" will strike multiple chords with viewers as it stumbles through a variety of dysfunctional family dynamics and the sad reality of expectations not met. The contrasting personalities of these strong characters (and actors) ricochet continuously, held together by the thinnest thread of love and remembrance of a lost dynamic. I've been to enough family Thanksgiving dinners to know it's nothing short of a miracle they come off, and the dinner in ""Home for the Holidays"" is equally manic. Turkey's are thrown across the room, wine is spilled, fights break out and trips to the grocery store become epic misadventures.The performances are uniformly superb, with Hunter and Bancroft especially touching as mother and daughter. Their scenes together are one of many highlights. Downey, Jr., as has been reported, was suffering from drug abuse during this film and there are times when his twitchy portrayal is over the top. Still, he gives a terrific performance. Now that this great actor has overcome his demons, the film is not as painful to watch.Visually the movie is extraordinary, with several haunting snapshots - the snow-covered steps of the family home, Hunter stranded on the sidewalk in front of a cemetery, Bancroft standing in the snow in her housecoat and Durning watching home movies in the privacy of the cellar. I was especially moved to tears during the closing montage where youthful flashbacks of the family were shown on faded 8mm stock. For those who grew up in the 1960s, these grainy portraits of grandparents, parents and children will remind us of some of the purest moments of our own lives.My lone complaint is a surprise ending which is too formulaic for my taste. I would have liked more subtlety, as everything up to that point was unusually truthful. The right chord had been struck as Hunter is boarding the plane to return home and her father quietly says, ""We made her."" Why dilute this by tacking on the fairy tale? Oh well, I still love ""Home for the Holidays,"" a beautiful snapshot with an uncommon eye for the dramatic struggles of an aging American family.

As it stands, I rented this DVD the night before Thanksgiving, and have watched at least pieces of it each night since (3 nights). You must listen closely or watch repeatedly to get the dialogue, plot and character nuances....kind of like real life, actually.Poor Claudia makes her way home for Thanksgiving to her odd, nerve-wracking and stressful family (like most people, I imagine). Her mom and dad are odd, her aunt is nuts, her sister's family is just YUCK and then....there is her brother. The whole movie really is a profile of the relationship between Claudia and her little brother Tommy...who is gay, and not expected for this holiday dinner. He shows up, with a ""friend"" in tow.  SPOILER: What looks like an innocent ""Oh, I thought I'd just show up"" visit from Tommy is actually one big huge wonderful gesture of filial love. He knows she has just lost her job, has issues with her 16-year-old daughter, is NOT looking forward to going home, etc. He knows she is going nuts with fear. He knows his very presence will be a great distraction for her and for the rest of the family. He comes, even when he will have to leave before dawn the next day to make a business meeting...all because he cares about his dear sister. He is exasperating and waaaaayyy too energetic, but you just LOVE him. AND he brings a really genuinely nice man (whom everyone thinks is his new ""partner."" ) How very like Tommy to let everyone believe this...most of all Claudia.The friend, Leo Fish, turns out to be polite, humorous, and very, very heterosexual. Frank in his pursuit of Claudia (once she figures out which way the wind blows), he and she have a few pretty damned cute scenes together. Good for Jodi Foster that she left in the making-out-while-eating scene. Too bad if it grosses people out....it's real!!! The doorstep scene is funny, too especially her snarling remark ""Sh**! I left all the CR** in the back seat!"" as her brother in law opens the door.Claudia's daughter keeps repeating a private calming mantra ""Watch the Fish...Remember the fish"" that I found irritatingly ham-handed (hello! Leo FISH!? Duh, OK I get it!), but mostly, I think director Jodi Foster got the overall feel right.Robert Downey Jr. steals almost every film he is in, but it was a tough heist in this one: Hunter is GRAND, as is Anne Bancroft. Most reviewers did not like the Leo Fish subplot, but I liked it, and the actor did a believeable job.

The family patriarch carves the Thanksgiving turkey before his late arriving brother and his family come to dinner.  When the brother arrives he is irate at such insolence and not only leaves but the two would never speak for the rest of their lives.  What Levinson achieves in this singular moment is not even suggested in 103 minutes of ""Home for the Holidays"".  It's not that director Jodie Foster doesn't try.  She manages to keep things interesting and gets the most out of her talented ensemble cast.  I will add, though, that Robert Downey Jr.'s gay brother is a cliched staple of films of this type.  The problem here is W.D. Richter's script which is a little thin.  Foster has to get mileage out of the Thanksgiving dinner scene which is fair-to-middling and a closing montage filmed in home movie stock.

It took a little while to warm up to this movie.I did like Holly Hunter's character, Clyde, who is not looking forward to the trip home for the holiday.  She was very good in this role, it's as if it was created just for her.The acting by all the cast was great.  I really felt like I knew some of these characters, and are related to some of them.Clyde and her brother Tommy, played to perfection by Robert Downey Jr., seem pretty close.  Both of them got out of the neighborhood and moved to big cities far away to get away from their highly dysfunctional family.  They both come back for Thanksgiving and the dysfunction starts up pretty quickly.This is a very funny and endearing look into how the holiday goes with a family that isn't exactly a &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; family.  While they each have their problems, I think it is Clyde who is the glue of this family.  Her sister, Joanne, is brewing with anger and hate toward her brother and sister because they got out.  I had no sympathy for that character, but it is a very realistic portrayal, as I unfortunately know people like this.  She thinks she is the normal one, but she is really not.  I adored all the other characters in the family, they made me laugh despite their quirks.  Just like our own families, we all have our own problems and live our lives differently, but what it all boils down to is we love each other.  This is what really matters.  There are the momments that we share together that will stand out in our memories more than others -- I think that pretty much sums up the point of this movie.This is a good movie to watch around Thanksgiving.

I have to admit that I thought a couple of times about stopping it in the middle, and not watching the whole thing.  I was thinking to myself, ""What is it that people like about movies about dysfunctional families?""  Well, it kind of all comes together in the end.  Or, maybe it is just that by the end you finally get the point of the movie.  (In fact, the chapters of the movie are separated by titles that appear on the screen, and the last chapter is entitled: ""The Point.""  But I didn't think about it so much when I was watching it the first time.)Something rare happens in this movie that doesn't often happen in ensemble cast movies.  Holly Hunter's character at one point says, ""When you go home, do you look around and wonder, 'Who ARE these people?'""  In fact, each and every member of the cast has their character's story told in depth, and we the viewers get to know ""who they are.""  The acting is fantastic!Indeed, I think this is what helped me get through the movie.  While at points I thought it was a bit torturous to watch a dysfunctional family go through the motions of trying to get along for the holidays, it really made me think about my own life and my own family.  Isn't that one of the main reasons you might enjoy a movie?  There were funny moments, sad moments, contemplative moments, crazy moments, and all the other kinds of moments that make up real life.Anyway, at the end of the movie, when it gets to people thinking about their lives, it really made me think about my own life and my own family.

Simpy, Claudia, the eldest child at 40 returns home to deal with her chain-smoking and neurotic mother (Adele), her overweight nostalgic father (Henry), her gay and slighty obnoxious brother (Tommy), her controlling and self-absorbed sister (Joanne), her preachy brother-in-law (Steve Guttenberg), her senile aunt (Gladys), an obnoxious niece, a quiet nephew, a former love, and the former prom queen while trying to keep a distant eye on her daughter (back in Chicago)who might be having sex.  This is tumultuous three-day visit with a 'typical' family that argues, eats, plays, dances, argues, loves and drives itself to to point of crying and laughing aloud.

384303,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,630365455X,James Hiller,"[109, 113]","""Home for the Holidays"" is a quiet, fun little film that I dust off once or twice a year (usually around Thanksgiving!) and sit back and absolutely enjoy. It's become a comfort film for me, one of honesty, predictability, and enjoyment. It's a wonder more people haven't discovered this mini-classic.Holly Hunter plays Claudia, a forty year old woman forced to endure calamity after calamity on her way to her parent's house for the Thanksgiving holiday. Hunter has her role sewn up from the moment we see her; she encapsulates Claudia and makes her very real as she is conforted with mini-nightmares. These problems plague her, only to define her life as unrealized, possibly misdirected. That Hunter refuses to play her as a sack sad, or someone pitiful, is a testament to her understanding of Claudia.The script avoids usual the ""family cliches"" by showing us a dysfunctional family that functions quite well. Gay brother Tommy, so perfectly mastered by Robert Downey Jr., always  the family clown, removes his ""make-up"" and shows incredible sensitivity when he rescues his sister from her holiday horror. Dylan McDermott charms his way quietly as Leo Fish, and you believe his sincerity towards Claudia. Cynthnia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg rock as the high strung power couple so insistent on perfection in their imperfect lives. And the wonderful Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft as the parents, so beleaguered, so joyful, so real.While the performances shine, the script shines even brighter, offering little solutions with much insight. You understand Claudia's trauams, but know that none of them are resolvable within a two hour film, and that's ok. Even the ending, which suggests that even daring to dream is enough, is absolutely perfect for this film. A less experienced screenwriter would have fallen into the cliche trap and wrapped everything up in a neat bow, which this film suggests, is simply not possible.""Home for the Holidays"" is a signature piece by Jodie Foster, one that people who enjoy a truly good film won't be there to pass up.

384308,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,630365455X,J. Michael Click,"[10, 11]","Wry black comedy with serious undertones about a thirty-something baby boomer (Holly Hunter) returning to her childhood home over Thanksgiving.  Things progress from bad to worse as she suffers through the mayhem of traveling by car and plane to a place she really doesn't want to be ... there she's reunited with her family of origin and real disaster ensues.  Director Jodie Foster does a marvelous job of turning the classic Norman Rockwellian vision of the All-American family holiday inside-out and upside-down; these people are the definition of &quot;dysfunctional&quot;! Or maybe they're just at their worst when forced together by empty tradition; although their reunion is marked by old tensions and rivalries, observant viewers will note that Hunter and her siblings each has developed a happy and nurturing family of their own --- Hunter with her daughter; gay brother Robert Downey Jr with his partner and their many friends; uptight sister Cynthia Stevenson with her husband and kids.  Those newer primary relationships, largely unglimpsed until the closing frames of the film, seem to be the hopeful idea at the heart of this funny yet wistful movie: each of us is born into a family of strangers where we learn to love; then we grow up and grow apart; finally we form our own families ... and the cycle begins again.By turns hysterically funny and then bittersweet and poignant, this little gem is played to perfection by its talented cast. Anne Bancroft's comedic timing has never been sharper; Geraldine Chaplin is both ridiculous and oddly sympathetic as the Aunt Who Never Married; Cynthia Stevenson is brilliant as the sister who cares more about appearances than happiness (even her own).  Best of all is Downey who plays the brother with an over-the-top intensity that quietly suggests volumes about his character's struggle growing up in a town and a family where he never felt quite at home.Highly recommended, and a film that only improves with repeated viewings.  There is a lot of subtext here, some of which is easy to miss the first time through when your first reaction is almost certain to be hearty laughter.

Has it really been that long ago?), and last night we watched it again on DVD and enjoyed it just as much.  If you're looking for a dark and sassy holiday flick that ultimately is quite moving in the end, check out ""Home"".  Basically it's the story of Claudia (played by the always delightful Holly Hunter), who loses her job, makes out with her boss and learns that her teenage daughter (played by a young Claire Danes, whose role is very small) is going to have sex with her boyfriend just before she gets on a plane to Baltimore to spend Thanksgiving with her dysfunctional family: mother (Anne Bancroft, who is, of course, wonderful), father (Charles Durning), crazy aunt (Geraldine Chaplin), wacky gay brother (Robert Downey, Jr.), his handsome friend (Dylan McDermott), her bitchy sister (Cynthia Stevenson) and her sister's husband (Steve Guttenberg).  It's a terrific cast of characters, and the story is full of darkly comic scenes and some touching dramatic moments--and the final scene with Nat King Cole singing is quite heartwarming.  If you don't like black comedies with some raunchy humor and a sweet center, please avoid this movie.  I love such films--and ""Home for the Holidays"" is something I'm very thankful for.

Who needs the Thanksgiving Day Parade when you can watch Home for the Holidays?  This is one of my holiday favorites and a staple every year at Thanksgiving.  The script is unique, the performances spot-on, and the soundtrack is classic (from Nat King Cole and Tom Jones to Rusted Root's impeccable cover of Evil Ways).  The actors deliver spectacular individual performances, all of which are praiseworthy--- my favorite may be Robert Downey Jr's outstanding portrayal of brother Tommy, which may be my favorite role of his in any movie, Chaplin notwithstanding--- right down to the smallest roles of the beleaguered co-passengers in the airport.  This movie, above all, makes me feel that our modern American family, however wacky they may be, however much our parents make us nuts, is really just that--- the modern American family.  And it's okay to be wacky, because family (however it's defined) is just that.  And we love them and they love us.  The movie makes a point of asking ""What's the point?"" several times, only to be told there is none.  But the point is that we keep our sense of humor, we love our family, and we accept that we'll probably never understand them-- or they us.  Just have fun, have some turkey, and have some love.I love this movie.

384334,A1J2931UBBJPXM,630365455X,Reviewer,"[7, 8]","Thanksgiving Day:  One of the biggest holidays of the year; a time for gathering together with friends and family, a day of reflection and giving thanks.  To paraphrase one wiser than myself, it's the best of times and the worst of times, when you take the bad with the good and in the end, it's all about getting your priorities straight and figuring out who and what is really important in your life.  It's that day when truth and honesty hits you over the head and you realize that your own family just may drive you nuts before it's over; but at the same time, you come to understand what unconditional love is really all about, which is what a young woman discovers in ""Home for the Holidays,"" directed by the multi-talented Jodie Foster, and starring Holly Hunter.  Claudia Larson (Hunter) is a single mom who's just been fired from her job restoring paintings in a Chicago museum, as they've just lost 90% of their funding and can't afford her anymore; she's got a terrible cold, and when her sixteen-year-old daughter, Kitt (Clare Danes), drops her off at the airport, just before she drives off she informs her mom that she's decided to be intimate with her boyfriend on Thanksgiving.  And with that, Claudia boards her plane to fly back home to spend a good old fashioned holiday with her family:  Her controlling mother, Adele, and her father, Henry (Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning); her uptight sister, Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson) and her husband, Walter (Steve Guttenberg); her eccentric aunt Glady (Geraldine Chaplin); and, she hopes-- though he's not supposed to be there-- her brother, Tommy (Robert Downey Jr.), the only one she can count on to keep her sane throughout the whole wonderful experience.  And quite an experience it is, as Foster takes you behind the closed doors of the Larson family, where Claudia tries to keep it together and along with the whole bunch tries to remember all there is to be thankful for.Suffice to say that Claudia does a pretty good job of figuring it all out in the end, and along the way the audience has a lot to be thankful for, as well, beginning with this warm and insightful film which Jodie Foster delivers in grand style.  Working from a clever screenplay by W.D. Richter (adapted from the short story by Chris Radant), Foster really hits the mark with this one as she presents some characters to whom absolutely everyone watching will be able to identify and relate in one way or another.  Sitting down to dinner with Claudia and her family is like being at home with your own, and I guarantee you're going to recognize these people.  And the real success of the film lies in the way Foster is able to open up her characters and get them to externalize those inner-most feelings, those things we all think and feel but rarely find a way or a chance to express.  It's like being able to take a step back, observe, and say, ""Yeah!  That's it!  I've been there!""  All of which proves what an eye for detail and what insight into human nature Foster possesses.  A lot of credit has to go to Richter and Radant, of course, but it's Foster who really hits the nail on the head and drives it home.  With a sensitive and intelligent approach, she manages to take the underlying drama of the story and blend it with the kind of humor that underscores the reality of the situation; and believe me, unless you're from the planet K-PAX, this is one that's really going to hit home with you on any number of levels.To be sure, Foster had a great cast with which to bring her vision to fruition here.  Holly Hunter does a tremendous job of conveying that angst of being torn between being thankful for this time with her erratic family and just wanting to run for the exit; it's that ying and yang of life that we've all experienced, and Hunter captures it perfectly.  She plays Claudia in such a way that-- gender aside-- watching her is like seeing your own reflection in a mirror; it's so very real, and whether or not you like what you see this is someone you're going to embrace, because you'll readily discover all of the emotional complexities of your own life embodied in her.  Hunter brings a strong and subtle reality to the part, and it's the anchor of the film.Also giving a strong performance, though less than subtle, is Robert Downey Jr., who makes Tommy a character you're either going to love or hate, depending upon your own personal experience and frame of reference.  Which ever way you go, however, you're going to have to appreciate what Downey brings to this film.  He fairly bursts upon the scene and the screen with an energy that would make that famous bunny enviable and pale by comparison.  And let's face it, every family has a Tommy, and for that matter a Joanne, as well, whom Stevenson brings to life with acuity.  And one of the strengths of this film is the very real way in which the relationship between the siblings is presented; chalk up another point for Foster, as well as for the gifted actors portraying them.And enough cannot be said about how much Bancroft and Durning bring to this film.  With terrific performances that successfully avoid any semblance of stereotype, they give definition to an entire generation and bring a perspective to this story that is invaluable.  The film acknowledges that these are flawed, but very real people, from her bunions to his pot-belly, and it's refreshingly real to see it portrayed as such on screen.Excellent, as well, in supporting roles are David Strathairn (Russell), Austin Pendleton (Peter) and especially Dylan McDermott as Leo Fish.  ""Home for the Holidays"" is definitely a keeper; the magic of the movies.",5,Jodie Foster Takes You Home,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,5649,"['Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'One', 'biggest', 'holidays',

384337,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,630365455X,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 21]","""Home for the Holidays"" is meant to be a post-modern response to years on crudely bogus holiday specials that nobody takes seriously.  Somebody must have thought it was high time for a story that actually depicts the mean spiritedness that comes out whenever family gets together, and it's too cold outside to escape.  Unfortunately, it's a weird dish of a story that tosses everything at you, but never comes together.Holly Hunter is Claudia, a single mom dragooned by fate to face the weekend with her parents.  Forced to sexually service her boss on pain of getting fired, Claudia winds up unemployed nonetheless.  Her parents are a compulsively edged-out Anne Bancroft and a terminally mellow Charles Durning - a former airline worker who watches old movies in the basement and keeps a sweet song handy in his head for when scenes get too involved.  But Claudia's sibs aren't any help either - with Robert Downey Jr. as Claudia's gay brother and the cute Cynthia Stephenson playing against type as Joanne, Claudia's sister, a button-down, bad-tempered type at odds with her brother's lifestyle.  The story traps them all within Durning's house - 5 characters in search of a story.  Part of the problem is that the tone is so uneven, you're never sure what kind of story ""Home"" is meant to be - it could be a bittersweet comedy, but it's never all that funny, and the characters never suggest sufficient depth needed for a decent drama.  Some parts are just too cute to be belived - including Dylan Mcdermott as a straight friend of Downey's character who will be drawn to Claudia; Geraldine Chaplin as Claudia's batty aunt Gladys; also David Straithairn as Russ, a boiler repairman having a horrible year.  According to IMDB.com legend, Robert Downey Jr. went through the flick hopelessly stoned and, unable to keep him clean & sober, director Jodie Foster just ratcheted up the film's speed to match its star.  Claudia's parents are very conventional, but not so much as to be intolerant of their madcap son - if you were gay, you could do worse than Charles Durning's character as your father.  On the contrary, it's Joanne with her straitlaced ways that suffers being on the outs with her family and the story, suffering just about every indignity the weekend can throw at her and her dim-witted husband (Steve Guttenberg).What really kills the story is its focus on Claudia who, unemployment aside, is so otherwise normal, it's difficult to understand what she's doing there - she plays little if any part in the weird stuff that goes on that weekend, she's the main character in a story that doesn't much involve her.That said, I'm not going to outright slam the story - it's a holiday story that's watchable as long as you don't think about too much.  I first caught this flick on TV around Thanksgiving about 8 years back when I lost my job, so it's a bit of a sentimental fave, and sentimentality means seldom having to ask yourself what you're watching.",3,what's the story?

What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end?Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, ""God I hate the holidays"" and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but.This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between ""holiday movies"" and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities.

This movie will have you in stitches each and every holiday season if you suffer from that ever present disease of dysfunctional family syndrome.Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) is wallowing in self-pity for good reason, she was fired from her job, her daughter is about to have sex for the first time and she is traveling back home for the holidays. What more could a girl ask for, a cold? She arrives to a snowy existence and a family of little understanding. Her father Henry (Charles Durning) and her mother Adele (Anne Bancroft) are seemingly oblivious to all of the turmoil they have created and that now resides within their children. Soon the house is filled with love and lots of arguments! Gay brother Tommy Larson (Robert Downey Jr.) appears to torture the entire clan with mischief and in tow he has a co-worker/friend, Leo Fish (Dylan McDermott). And of course what family would be complete without the crazy aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a branch of perfection that breaks off and becomes the norm, sister Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson) and her [...] husband Walter (Steve Guttenberg). So sit back and have a toast with a perfectly normal American family for the holidays but get ready to laugh uncontrollably too!Jodie Foster directed this film about the typical dysfunctional family during the holiday season and she brings both a sensitive understanding and a full blown sense of humor to this holiday table. Holly Hunter is really wonderful as the hopeful but often misunderstood sister in a clan of crazies. Despite his drug induced performance, Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the troubled brother with secrets to protect from a family that can't accept modern life. Dylan McDermott is the pretty boy of the film but offers much more than a cute mug in his role as the charming outsider. Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft are brilliant as clueless parents who are stuck in the roles they took upon themselves many years ago; both are unknowingly hilarious just like most parents who prefer to keep their eyes closed. Cynthia Stevenson is great as the perfectionist sister that seems to lurk about in every family and marries a nerd so that she can pretend to be happy. But the true scene stealer of this film has to be Geraldine Chaplin as crazy but oblivious Aunt Gladys, you cannot watch her performance and not fall on the floor in hysterics!
