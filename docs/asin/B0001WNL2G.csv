814907,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0001WNL2G,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Little House on the Prairie - Season 5The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.Disc 1.As Long as We're Together, Part I.  As Long as We're Together, Part II.The Winoka Warriors.  The Man Inside.Disc 2.There's No Place Like Home, Part I. There's No Place Like Home, Part II.Fagin.  Harriet's Happenings.Disc 3.The Wedding.  Men Will be Boys.The Cheaters.  Blind Journey, Part I.Disc 4.Blind Journey, Part II.  The Godsister.The Craftsman.  Blind Man's Bluff.Disc 5.Dance With Me.

However, my sister's interest in the show would eventually expose me.  In essence, DVD sets like this one are very similar to what I grew up with, the syndication editions.  When I was in my mid-twenties and becoming absorbed in TVLand, I started playing ""catch-up"" with the reruns and enjoying ever second of it.This season begins with the Ingalls family preparing for their third major migration, this one from Walnut Grove, Minnesota to Winoka, Dakota Territory, to accompany Mary to her new teaching job at a school for the blind.  In almost no time at all, they're joined by the Garveys (whose presence serves to provide both protection for the Ingalls and education to the poor) and the Olesons.  Upon arrival, they bring a vagrant youth into their circle, Albert.  After their common employer, Mr. Standish comes on too strong, all three families return to Walnut Grove for a second chance; Albert is taken in by the Ingalls.Before too long, Mary becomes engaged to mary her superior, Adam Kendall, has second thoughts, is brought to her senses during a freak storm and gets married.  In due course, their school is closed, and the couple heads off to Walnut Grove with the students to start another school.  Meanwhile, Albert is accepted as a true Ingalls, and he also begins his tactical campaign of playing practical jokes on the Olesons (as in ""Harriet's Happenings"" and ""The Lake Kezia Monster"").  Mary's pregnancy and tragic miscarriage exposes Adam's father for all his prejudices.  Other members of the Ingalls and Garvey families, as well as Joe Kagen, face similar adversity from the Larabee family and come out of it mostly unharmed.I've done searches on adjacent materials, and in the process, I found various postings that criticized Michael Landon for creating the character of Albert Ingalls.  Forget what his creation did for the latter half of the series, or what a terrific job Matthew Laborteaux did in the portrayal.  What I read looked to me as if people were furious with the liberties Michael took in bringing in a character who had nothing to do with Laura Ingalls Wilder's writings  I for one appreciate the sheer entertainment value that a character like Albert gave to the show, especially when the family returned to Walnut Grove without Mary (Melissa Sue Anderson).  The show definitely benefited from the creation of both Albert and Adam, as it had from the creations of Grace Sneider and the Sandersons.It should be noted that there was a real Albert Ingalls who had a doctorate in astronomy.  However, it is highly doubtful that this Albert has any real connection to the family line of Laura Ingalls Wilder.",5,The First Big Change,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2752,"['was', ""n't"", 'alive', 'most', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'run', 'being', 'born', '1980', 'apparently', 'Season', '6', 'However', 'sister', 'interest', 'show', 'would', 'eventually', 'expose', 'essence', 'DVD', 'one', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'grew', 'up', 'syndication', 'editions', 'When', 'was', 'mid-twenties', 'becoming', 'absorbed', 'TVLand', 'started', 'playing', 'catch-up', 'reruns', 'enjoying', 'ever', 'second', 'it.This', 'season', 'Ingalls', 'family', 'preparing', 'third', 'major', 'migration', 'one', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'Minnesota', 'Winoka', 'Dakota', 'Territory', 'accompany', 'Mary', 'new', 'teaching', 'job', 'school', 'blind', 'almost', 'time', ""'re"", 'joined', 'Garveys', 'presence', 'provide', 'protection', 'Ingalls', 'education', 'poor', 'Olesons', 'arrival', 'bring', 'vagrant', 'youth', 'circle', 'Albert', 'common', 'employer', 'Mr.', 'Standish', 'too', 'strong', 'three', 'families', 'return', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'second', 'chance', 'Albert', 'taken', 'Ingalls.Before', 'too', 'long', 'Mary', 'engaged', 'mary', 'superior', 'Adam', 'Kendall', 'second', 'thoughts', 'brought', 'senses', 'freak', 'storm', 'married', 'due', 'course', 'school', 'closed', 'couple', 'heads', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'students', 'start', 'school', 'Meanwhile', 'Albert', 'accepted', 'true', 'Ingalls', 'also', 'tactical', 'campaign', 'playing', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Olesons', 'Harriet', 'Happenings', 'Lake', 'Kezia', 'Monster', 'Mary', 'pregnancy', 'tragic', 'miscarriage', 'Adam', 'father', 'prejudices', 'Other', 'members', 'Ingalls', 'Garvey', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'Joe', 'Kagen', 'face', 'similar', 'adversity', 'Larabee', 'family', 'come', 'mostly', 'unharmed.I', ""'ve"", 'done', 'searches', 'adjacent', 'materials', 'process', 'found', 'various', 'postings', 'criticized', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'creating', 'character', 'Albert', 'Ingalls', 'Forget', 'what', 'creation', 'did', 'latter', 'half', 'series', 'what', 'terrific', 'job', 'Matthew', 'Laborteaux', 'did', 'portrayal', 'What', 'read', 'looked', 'people', 'were', 'furious', 'liberties', 'Michael', 'took', 'bringing', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'writings', 'one', 'appreciate', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'value', 'character', 'Albert', 'gave', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'family', 'returned', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'Mary', 'Melissa', 'Sue', 'Anderson', 'show', 'definitely', 'benefited', 'creation', 'Albert', 'Adam', 'had', 'creations', 'Grace', 'Sneider', 'Sandersons.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'was', 'real', 'Albert', 'Ingalls', 'who', 'had', 'doctorate', 'astronomy', 'However', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'Albert', 'real', 'connection', 'family', 'line', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 5

The picture quality is sharp and clear, and the audio is as good as can be expected given the age of the master tapes. It's not in stereo or anything but it is clear. As far as the edits go, yes that is a  problem in some spots. Some scenes fade as normal, and some abruptly cut in and out. In most cases you still get the entire episode, with the exception being ""There's No Place Like Home Part 1"" as mentioned previously with an entire scene missing. I don't really like that either but I guess they did it because of space on the disc. The most important episode, Part 2 is complete at least. If that had been edited it would be a crime. It's one of best of the entire series as Karl Swenson makes his last appearance on the show. It should also be noted that the Hallmark channel does not show this 2 part episode in reruns either, so DVD is the only way to watch it right now.The extras are a good touch, but I would like to have seen more in-depth questions asked with more elaboration on each subject. The interviews are only 10 minutes each. It was still good to see Dabbs Greer and Alison Arngrim after so many years.Overall the whole set is worth the money as this Season was one of best in the series, also look out for the episodes ""As Long As We're Together"", ""The Man Inside"", ""Blind Journey"", ""Barn Burner"" and ""The Craftsmen"".",4,Great DVD set for the price,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,1443,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'most', 'episodes', 'set', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'criticism', 'justified', 'picture', 'quality', 'sharp', 'clear', 'audio', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'age', 'master', 'tapes', 'not', 'stereo', 'anything', 'clear', 'As', 'far', 'edits', 'go', 'yes', 'problem', 'spots', 'scenes', 'fade', 'normal', 'abruptly', 'cut', 'most', 'cases', 'still', 'get', 'entire', 'episode', 'exception', 'being', 'Place', 'Home', 'Part', '1', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'entire', 'scene', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'guess', 'did', 'space', 'disc', 'most', 'important', 'episode', 'Part', '2', 'complete', 'least', 'had', 'been', 'edited', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'Karl', 'Swenson', 'last', 'appearance', 'show', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'not', 'show', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'reruns', 'so', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'right', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'touch', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'in-depth', 'questions', 'asked', 'more', 'elaboration', 'subject', 'interviews', 'are', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'see', 'Dabbs', 'Greer', 'Alison', 'Arngrim', 'so', 'many', 'years.Overall', 'whole', 'set', 'money', 'Season', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'also', 'look', 'out', 'episodes', 'As', 'Long', ""'re"", 'Together', 'Man', 'Inside', 'Blind', 'Journey', 'Barn', 'Burner', 'Craftsmen']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 5

Some episodes are serious, others are light-hearted.  I especially enjoyed the episodes with Ray Bolger.  The addition of Albert this season seems like a good move.  The DVD quality is generally good, though there are a few dark and a few fuzzy scenes.  My biggest complaint is the hard break between some scenes (probably where the show being aired would break for commercials).  The scenes seem cut off before they ended; there is no soft landing, just a quick transfer to another scene.  It gets annoying when it happens several times per show.

Matthew Laborteaux was added as Albert who really added some depth and dimensions to the show, especially after Mary loses her sight and moves to Winoka.The quality of the DVD for some of the episodes, as indicated by other reviewers, ranges from good, to okay, to down-right horrible.  I've collected a number of television DVDs, and I have to say that this is by far the worst one in terms of quality.  I mean, how difficult is it to transfer it over correctly?  No one else seems to have had the trouble that Imavision has had.Another note is that the editing is horrific.  Little House episodes always went to commercial breaks with the classic ""fade out.""  You'll note in a many of these episodes, there is an immediate cut from a scene.  Unfortunately, these episodes are NOT complete.  There are many parts missing in various episodes.  I know that these scenes are not ""lost"" or ""missing,"" because I saw them just the other day when the show was on a television network.Understand that my complaints are due to the lack of quality that has been put into this DVD rather than with a show that I grew up with and loved to watch every week.I can only hope that enough complaints may prompt NBC to put out the kind of DVDs that they are known for.  You would think they would have put more effort toward one of the best family shows of all time.I encourage anyone who is unhappy with their product to e-mail imavision and let them know.  Perhaps with enough response, they might one day be prompted to giving us a truly complete season.Note: It seems that most of the TV series that are released through NBC Home Entertainment are edited.
