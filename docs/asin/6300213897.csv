Three great performances from Bergen, Reynolds and Clayburgh, who show perfect comic timing and real chemistry. The humor comes from real, often poignant situations, and every scene, from the more intimate scenes between Reynolds and Clayburgh to those at the group therapy sessions, are the real thing. The supporting players are also terrific. It's got one of the best endings ever. Listen closely or you might not hear the last line uttered by Clayburgh because the credits are already rolling.

209441,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300213897,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Just coming off producing and writing the classic sitcoms, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"", James L. Brooks wrote the screenplay, his first, for this 1979 divorce comedy. Even after all these years and finally out on DVD, it remains funny, perceptive and thoroughly engaging in a way that later crystallized into Brooks' filmmaking trademark in ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets"". Fortunately, the director is the accomplished Alan J. Pakula, who shows a flair for romantic comedy coaxing excellent performances from the three stars.The plot centers on Phil Potter, a magazine writer-turned-writing teacher who has been informed by his beautiful but flaky wife Jessica that she wants a divorce. Without much recourse, he seeks solace from his bear-hugging psychiatrist brother Mickey and sister-in-law Marva, who eventually set him up on a blind date with Marilyn, a mild-mannered, rather dowdy nursery schoolteacher. The movie then becomes a clever seesaw of Phil vacillating between his wife and potential new love interest. What remains fresh about the movie is how Pakula and Brooks keep the focus on the flawed characters and less on the predictable cliches about the awkward consequences of divorce.Even taking into account his comeback turn in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 ""Boogie Nights"", I doubt if Burt Reynolds has given a more subtle, genuinely humane performance than he does here. Cast completely against type (he was in his Smokey/Hooper/Sharkey action phase at the time), he makes Phil's uncertainty feel real - even at the risk of losing audience sympathy in the way he treats Marilyn no matter how inadvertently. In the afterglow of her brilliant work in Paul Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman"", Jill Clayburgh again demonstrates the malleable quality and fierce intelligence to make her deglamorized Marilyn an attractive and credibly cautious woman. In a revelation before her long, successful run as ""Murphy Brown"", a deadpan Candice Bergen breaks free from her heretofore vacuously decorative roles and supplies the movie's biggest laughs as the narcissistic Jessica, especially when she sings with uproariously tone-deaf panache to seduce Phil in her hotel room.There is also a terrific supporting cast - Charles Durning bringing out all the unctuous support that Mickey can muster; a scene-stealing Frances Sternhagen as Marva, more than anxious to provide Phil emotional support when he is down and out; Austin Pendleton as a needy member of Phil's divorced men's club, who keeps remarrying his ex-wife; and Mary Kay Place in a funny cameo as Phil's aggressive first post-marital date. Other than Marilyn's unflattering outfits (the orange down jacket is hideous), Marvin Hamlisch's seventies-lite pop music is really the only significant element that dates the movie severely. The divorced men's club meeting scenes are hilarious, and you can see Jay O. Sanders and Wallace Shawn as fellow members. Unlike other romantic comedies of the period full of I'm-OK-You're-OK pop psychology, this one is still well worth viewing. The 2005 DVD has no extras.",4,Bright Comedy with Stellar Cast Shining in Sharp Pakula-Brooks Collaboration,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,3091,"['Just', 'coming', 'off', 'producing', 'writing', 'classic', 'sitcoms', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Taxi', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'first', '1979', 'divorce', 'comedy', 'Even', 'years', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'funny', 'perceptive', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'way', 'later', 'crystallized', 'Brooks', 'filmmaking', 'trademark', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'As', 'Good', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'accomplished', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'who', 'flair', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'coaxing', 'excellent', 'performances', 'three', 'stars.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Phil', 'Potter', 'magazine', 'writer-turned-writing', 'teacher', 'who', 'been', 'informed', 'beautiful', 'flaky', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'divorce', 'much', 'recourse', 'solace', 'bear-hugging', 'psychiatrist', 'brother', 'Mickey', 'sister-in-law', 'Marva', 'who', 'eventually', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'Marilyn', 'mild-mannered', 'rather', 'dowdy', 'nursery', 'schoolteacher', 'movie', 'then', 'clever', 'seesaw', 'Phil', 'vacillating', 'wife', 'potential', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'What', 'fresh', 'movie', 'how', 'Pakula', 'Brooks', 'keep', 'focus', 'flawed', 'characters', 'less', 'predictable', 'cliches', 'awkward', 'consequences', 'divorce.Even', 'taking', 'account', 'comeback', 'turn', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', '1997', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'doubt', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'given', 'more', 'subtle', 'genuinely', 'humane', 'performance', 'here', 'Cast', 'completely', 'type', 'was', 'Smokey/Hooper/Sharkey', 'action', 'phase', 'time', 'Phil', 'uncertainty', 'feel', 'real', 'even', 'risk', 'losing', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'way', 'Marilyn', 'matter', 'how', 'inadvertently', 'afterglow', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'Unmarried', 'Woman', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'again', 'malleable', 'quality', 'fierce', 'intelligence', 'make', 'deglamorized', 'Marilyn', 'attractive', 'credibly', 'cautious', 'woman', 'revelation', 'long', 'successful', 'run', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'deadpan', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'breaks', 'free', 'heretofore', 'vacuously', 'decorative', 'roles', 'movie', 'biggest', 'narcissistic', 'Jessica', 'especially', 'when', 'uproariously', 'tone-deaf', 'panache', 'seduce', 'Phil', 'hotel', 'room.There', 'also', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'bringing', 'out', 'unctuous', 'support', 'Mickey', 'can', 'muster', 'scene-stealing', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'Marva', 'more', 'anxious', 'provide', 'Phil', 'emotional', 'support', 'when', 'down', 'Austin', 'Pendleton', 'needy', 'member', 'Phil', 'divorced', 'men', 'club', 'who', 'remarrying', 'ex-wife', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'funny', 'cameo', 'Phil', 'aggressive', 'first', 'post-marital', 'date', 'Other', 'Marilyn', 'unflattering', 'outfits', 'orange', 'down', 'jacket', 'hideous', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'seventies-lite', 'pop', 'music', 'really', 'only', 'significant', 'element', 'movie', 'severely', 'divorced', 'men', 'club', 'meeting', 'scenes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'can', 'see', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'fellow', 'members', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'period', 'full', ""I'm-OK-You're-OK"", 'pop', 'psychology', 'one', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', '2005', 'DVD', 'extras']",Starting Over VHS

Supporting roles by Charles Durning, Frances Sternhagen and Austin Pendleton round out the cast and (they) contribute to the warmth and pathos of this comedy. Phil Potter (Reynolds) has just discovered his aspiring songwriter-wife Jessica (Candace Bergen in a funny, self-deprecating role) has been having an affair with his boss and she wants out of the 8 yr. marriage to pursue her songwriting dreams. Stunned, he retreats to Boston to begin a new life with the encouragement of his psychiatrist brother Mickey (Durning) who sets him up with love-shy Marilyn Holmgren (Clayburgh) and enrolls him in group therapy. Just as Phil is finding  his footing in a relationship with the insecure Marilyn, Jessica shows up to try and woo him back, which includes a funny offkey serenading by Bergen, now a successful songwriter.Both Clayburgh and Bergen were nominated for Oscars, but it's Reynolds (whose performance was inexplicably ignored by Oscar) who shines in a role against type - no macho, mustachioed, testosterone-laced good old boy posturing here. He plays the wounded middle-aged Phil Potter trying to make a new life for himself in an understated , sympathetic un-reynolds manner and is totally charming.This 1979 flick was superbly directed by Alan J Pakula, and is highly recommended; also good to view around the christmas holidays.",5,STARTING OVER - BURT'S BEST?,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,1661,"['well', 'crafted', 'comedy', 'features', 'stellar', 'performances', '3', 'top-billed', 'stars', 'Clayburgh', 'Bergen', 'Reynolds', 'true', 'surprise', 'here', 'was', 'low', 'key', 'acting', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'humble', 'insecure', 'magazine', 'writer', 'recently', 'dumped', 'spouse', 'testing', 'dating', 'waters', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'others', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'Austin', 'Pendleton', 'out', 'cast', 'contribute', 'warmth', 'pathos', 'comedy', 'Phil', 'Potter', 'Reynolds', 'just', 'discovered', 'aspiring', 'songwriter-wife', 'Jessica', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'funny', 'self-deprecating', 'role', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', '8', 'yr.', 'marriage', 'pursue', 'songwriting', 'dreams', 'Stunned', 'Boston', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'encouragement', 'psychiatrist', 'brother', 'Mickey', 'Durning', 'who', 'up', 'love-shy', 'Marilyn', 'Holmgren', 'Clayburgh', 'group', 'therapy', 'Just', 'Phil', 'finding', 'footing', 'relationship', 'insecure', 'Marilyn', 'Jessica', 'up', 'try', 'woo', 'back', 'funny', 'offkey', 'serenading', 'Bergen', 'now', 'successful', 'songwriter.Both', 'Clayburgh', 'Bergen', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Reynolds', 'performance', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'ignored', 'Oscar', 'who', 'shines', 'role', 'type', 'macho', 'mustachioed', 'testosterone-laced', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'posturing', 'here', 'wounded', 'middle-aged', 'Phil', 'Potter', 'trying', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'understated', 'sympathetic', 'un-reynolds', 'manner', 'totally', 'charming.This', '1979', 'flick', 'was', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Alan', 'J', 'Pakula', 'highly', 'recommended', 'also', 'good', 'view', 'christmas', 'holidays']",Starting Over VHS

I finally decided to watch it and what a surprise this turned out to be. This is a very low key performance from Burt Reynolds. I can't say much more about this movie that has not been said below. I will say that the chemistry and comic timing as noted by other reviewers is seamless. Whether it was a decision by the director to restrain Reynolds from his usual good old boy performances or whether Burt Reynolds decided to play the character as he did lead to Reynolds giving a performance that I don't think has fitted him more at any other time in his career. This is a well written, well acted character piece with a light sprinkling of humor throughout. I love the scenes involving the divorced men's club that Reynolds character attends with some great scenes in Charles During's home who plays Reynolds older brother in the movie. I only have time for a handful of Reynolds movies over his career, 100 Rifles, fuzz, Deliverance, Shamus, White Lightening, The Longest Yard, Hustle, Semi-Tough, Sharky's Machine and Breaking In. I have yet to see Best Friends and Stick. Watching some of the stuff Reynolds is involved in now makes it hard to believe that it is the same person or actor that was involved in some of his best early 70's work. Smokey And The Bandit, his greatest success is also an enjoyable movie but I have always felt that it was probably more than all the flops Reynolds made in the 80's the movie that ended his career because it type cast him in that type of role. In Starting Over, Burt Reynolds showed that he was capable of much more given the right material and a good director who knew what to do with him and it's a shame more people have not seen his performance in this.",4,Hard to believe this is the same Burt Reynolds we know today.,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1889,"['must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'well', 'year', 'sitting', 'very', 'small', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'DVD', 'collection', 'picking', 'up', '4', '30', 'offer', 'being', 'unable', 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'what', 'surprise', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'chemistry', 'comic', 'timing', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seamless', 'was', 'decision', 'director', 'restrain', 'Reynolds', 'usual', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'performances', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'decided', 'play', 'character', 'did', 'lead', 'Reynolds', 'giving', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fitted', 'more', 'other', 'time', 'career', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'character', 'piece', 'light', 'sprinkling', 'humor', 'love', 'scenes', 'involving', 'divorced', 'men', 'club', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'great', 'scenes', 'Charles', 'home', 'who', 'Reynolds', 'older', 'brother', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'time', 'handful', 'Reynolds', 'movies', 'career', '100', 'Rifles', 'fuzz', 'Deliverance', 'Shamus', 'White', 'Lightening', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Hustle', 'Semi-Tough', 'Sharky', 'Machine', 'Breaking', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Stick', 'Watching', 'stuff', 'Reynolds', 'involved', 'now', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'person', 'actor', 'was', 'involved', 'best', 'early', '70', 'work', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'greatest', 'success', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'flops', 'Reynolds', 'made', '80', 'movie', 'ended', 'career', 'type', 'cast', 'type', 'role', 'Starting', 'Over', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'showed', 'was', 'capable', 'much', 'more', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'good', 'director', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'shame', 'more', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'performance']",Starting Over VHS

It's not that it's particularly dated (which can't be said for a lot of other 35-year-old films), the plot just doesn't seem to go anywhere or pick up steam. I viewed it as more of a series of vignettes than a full-on comedy/drama.

""Starting Over"" is a play on words because it is unclear, until near the conclusion, with whom Reynolds wants to begin again - his ex-wife or his new girlfriend played by Jill Clayburgh.  The three main characters are fabulous.  They are joined by superb character actor Charles Durning as Reynolds' older psychiatrist brother.  Members of Reynolds' divorced men's support group also give the movie a good realistic touch.  Bergen is most appropriately annoying in her role, Clayburgh is delightfully warm and sweet, and Reynolds is understandably confused and sympathetic.

Brooks, on the Alan J. Pakula-directed Starting Over, didn't exactly set the box-office on fire. At the time industry pundits claimed it was because he shaved his `tache for the film (no, really) but in retrospect it's probably more because this often feels a bit like a superior Lifetime TV movie, the kind of film you won't mind watching if it's on and you have nothing better to do but which you wouldn't actively seek out. There are good moments and good performances (both Candice Bergen, who delivers a trio of memorably awful songs with unashamed - intentional - incompetence and Jill Clayburgh were Oscar nominated as the ex-wife and new woman in unwilling divorcee Reynolds' life, while Charles Durning is on good understated form as his psychiatrist brother), but for all the care with which its made it just never quite catches fire.Paramount's DVD typically boasts no extras but does offer a decent widescreen transfer.",3,"Good, but not quite good enough",1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,1141,"['part', 'movie', 'lore', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'career', 'hit', 'toilet', 'moment', 'decided', 'do', 'Stroker', 'Ace', 'instead', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'what', 'people', 'forget', 'previous', 'collaboration', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula-directed', 'Starting', 'Over', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'set', 'box-office', 'fire', 'time', 'industry', 'pundits', 'claimed', 'was', 'shaved', 'tache', 'film', 'really', 'retrospect', 'probably', 'more', 'often', 'bit', 'superior', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'kind', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'actively', 'seek', 'out', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'good', 'performances', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'who', 'trio', 'memorably', 'awful', 'songs', 'unashamed', 'intentional', 'incompetence', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'woman', 'unwilling', 'divorcee', 'Reynolds', 'life', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'good', 'understated', 'form', 'psychiatrist', 'brother', 'care', 'made', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'fire.Paramount', 'DVD', 'typically', 'extras', 'offer', 'decent', 'widescreen', 'transfer']",Starting Over VHS
