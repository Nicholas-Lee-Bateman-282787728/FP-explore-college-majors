371020,AY8FI73B2HWXB,6303379222,Ada Ardor,"[3, 3]","This is a film I really enjoyed almost a decade ago, and I was so pleased that the film finally come out on DVD.  Story of a young girl, Mui, coming a long way to serve a wealthy family, and how she serves and interacts with those around her.  The mother/mistress is a kind woman, dutifully running a cloth shop, upper class but hiding the fact that she is on the brink of ruin, who mourns for the daughter she lost years ago; the daughter would have been the same age as Mui.  Her husband is a rascal, who steals the family savings and cavorts, and his mother blames her daughter-in-law for not being able to keep him at home.  Oddly, she has an admirer, who does not see him because she is in love with her first husband, who died young.  The mother/mistress does not protest and accepts all criticism.  Her first son is handsome, aloof, charismatic, while the second son weeps witnessing his mother being abused by her mother-in-law.  The last son is a sadist, who torments Mui - hiding lizards in expensive vases; soiling newly washed clothes; urinating in a scrubbed pot; he loves his father and covets his father's attention.  I especially loved the wisdom of the older servant woman, who advised to salt the food so the family eats more rice etc. Man San Lu as the young Mui is captivating; she positively enchants the camera (and the audience) and her appreciation for the small things is absolutely mesmerizing.  She imbues all she touches with empathy, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first hour.  You can understand how her mistress/boss develops maternal feelings for her.  Afterwards, this is when the spell breaks - the older Mui was awful, seemingly mentally ill, or deranged, as if mimicking the performance of the younger girl.  The worst was the interaction between her and her former mistress, who adopted her as a surrogate daughter; the intimacy between them was like a human and a mute pet animal, rearing its head in its longing to be petted, and it seemed the older Mui was mentally ill, or a simpleton just full of smiles.  I thought Mui would grow up to be strong, opinionated young woman, not this mute over-eager pile of mush.  The best parts are when she performs the menial, because she is not interacting with any human.  The older Mui is sent to the oldest son's friend's house, because the family can no longer afford her, and this is a musician, whom she had a crush on. This man is rich, plays the piano, and has a fianc&eacute;e.  Her rival, though less beautiful, had more fire; and it is a shame her fianc&eacute; rejected her.  It is clear she was passionate about her lover; she was smart, sophisticated and beautiful, and though I disliked her treatment of Mui; I also understand it was very human of her.  That is a woman who could move mountains.  Her departure makes it seem like the young man took the easy route, choosing an idiot girl who would breed and clean for him, who remained a ten-year old girl (fault of the actress or the director?), and who could never escape.  The lines uttered at the end are horridly written and maudlin, but I fault the screenwriter.  Still, the first hour is gorgeous.  There is such a delicacy to Man Sun Lu's (Mui as ten) performance.  I especially love the food parts.  I wish she had been in other films.  It is a rich, vibrant story, though hampered by the latter third.  Still gorgeous, and I do not regret my purchase; I'm so glad this film came to DVD.",4,Avoid the latter third; first 2/3 is great,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,3437,"['film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'almost', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'film', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Story', 'young', 'girl', 'Mui', 'coming', 'long', 'way', 'serve', 'wealthy', 'family', 'how', 'interacts', 'mother/mistress', 'kind', 'woman', 'dutifully', 'running', 'cloth', 'shop', 'upper', 'class', 'hiding', 'fact', 'brink', 'ruin', 'who', 'daughter', 'lost', 'years', 'ago', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'age', 'Mui', 'husband', 'rascal', 'who', 'family', 'savings', 'cavorts', 'mother', 'daughter-in-law', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'home', 'Oddly', 'admirer', 'who', 'not', 'see', 'love', 'first', 'husband', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'mother/mistress', 'not', 'protest', 'accepts', 'criticism', 'first', 'son', 'handsome', 'aloof', 'charismatic', 'second', 'son', 'weeps', 'witnessing', 'mother', 'being', 'abused', 'mother-in-law', 'last', 'son', 'sadist', 'who', 'Mui', 'hiding', 'lizards', 'expensive', 'vases', 'soiling', 'newly', 'washed', 'clothes', 'urinating', 'scrubbed', 'pot', 'father', 'father', 'attention', 'especially', 'loved', 'wisdom', 'older', 'servant', 'woman', 'who', 'advised', 'salt', 'food', 'family', 'more', 'rice', 'etc', 'Man', 'San', 'Lu', 'young', 'Mui', 'captivating', 'positively', 'camera', 'audience', 'appreciation', 'small', 'things', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'empathy', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'hour', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'mistress/boss', 'maternal', 'feelings', 'Afterwards', 'when', 'spell', 'breaks', 'older', 'Mui', 'was', 'awful', 'seemingly', 'mentally', 'ill', 'deranged', 'mimicking', 'performance', 'younger', 'girl', 'worst', 'was', 'interaction', 'former', 'mistress', 'who', 'adopted', 'surrogate', 'daughter', 'intimacy', 'was', 'human', 'mute', 'pet', 'animal', 'rearing', 'head', 'longing', 'be', 'petted', 'seemed', 'older', 'Mui', 'was', 'mentally', 'ill', 'simpleton', 'just', 'full', 'smiles', 'thought', 'Mui', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'strong', 'opinionated', 'young', 'woman', 'not', 'mute', 'over-eager', 'pile', 'mush', 'best', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'menial', 'not', 'interacting', 'human', 'older', 'Mui', 'sent', 'oldest', 'son', 'friend', 'house', 'family', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'musician', 'whom', 'had', 'crush', 'man', 'rich', 'piano', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'rival', 'though', 'less', 'beautiful', 'had', 'more', 'fire', 'shame', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'rejected', 'clear', 'was', 'passionate', 'lover', 'was', 'smart', 'sophisticated', 'beautiful', 'disliked', 'treatment', 'Mui', 'also', 'understand', 'was', 'very', 'human', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'move', 'mountains', 'departure', 'young', 'man', 'took', 'easy', 'route', 'choosing', 'idiot', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'breed', 'clean', 'who', 'remained', 'ten-year', 'old', 'girl', 'fault', 'actress', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'never', 'escape', 'lines', 'uttered', 'end', 'are', 'horridly', 'written', 'fault', 'screenwriter', 'Still', 'first', 'hour', 'gorgeous', 'such', 'delicacy', 'Man', 'Sun', 'Lu', 'Mui', 'ten', 'performance', 'especially', 'love', 'food', 'parts', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'other', 'films', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'story', 'hampered', 'latter', 'third', 'Still', 'gorgeous', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'film', 'came', 'DVD']",N/A
371021,A16LBSWNQRS292,6303379222,Alex H. Taylor,"[1, 1]","Comment: Every now and again I have the good sense to watch a film from ""outside my box"". This film is one of those. I was in Vietnam during the years USA was fighting there. Most of the culture I know about Vietnam is from that experience. With that experience... I watched this movie. I am disclosing this not to say that is why I watched the movie, because it is not... but rather to explain how I interpreted the movie. The film is set in the 1950s pre war Saigon... yet I see the movie is dated 1992. This makes a difference to me... the subject pre war made after war. In the movie there are some very slight hints about French influence and a one time sound track with jet planes flying over. Both of these items have ""nothing"" to do with the main thrust of the movie. Neither does sex play a direct part of the movie although some pictures seem to promise that. This movie is an extreme closeup and personal story that follows a 10 year old girl to her very early 20s. It is a work of art done with a minimum of dialog, but rather with a fantastically rich pallet of pictures (very close ups) and ""mini"" glimpses of life. I believe you have to be a little mature and still have some sort of sensitivity left to truly enjoy this movie. To truly enjoy this movie you must leave your ""prejudices"" at the door. Now for my one and only complaint. The ending... done the ""artsy crafty"" way... not the ""all strings tied"" way. I don't like it when filmmakers take the ""you finish the film in your head"" way to finish up. I have to compare it to a ""stupid skit"" I learned many years ago in the Boyscouts. A B52 Bomber was limping back to its base, all shot up and very badly on fire. Suddenly it goes into a power dive with all on board screaming as it hurtles toward the ground. Just 3 feet from the ground everything stops and the Captain is heard on the intercom saying... ""Everything is all right lads... we just ran out of gas"". The film is still worth a look and five stars on Amazon comments.",5,That ending... again!,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,1998,"['Comment', 'now', 'again', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'watch', 'film', 'outside', 'box', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'years', 'USA', 'was', 'fighting', 'there', 'Most', 'culture', 'know', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'experience', 'watched', 'movie', 'am', 'disclosing', 'not', 'say', 'why', 'watched', 'movie', 'not', 'rather', 'explain', 'how', 'interpreted', 'movie', 'film', 'set', '1950s', 'pre', 'war', 'Saigon', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'dated', '1992', 'difference', 'subject', 'pre', 'war', 'made', 'war', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'slight', 'hints', 'French', 'influence', 'one', 'time', 'sound', 'track', 'jet', 'planes', 'flying', 'items', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'main', 'thrust', 'movie', 'sex', 'play', 'direct', 'part', 'movie', 'pictures', 'seem', 'promise', 'movie', 'extreme', 'closeup', 'personal', 'story', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'very', 'early', '20s', 'work', 'art', 'done', 'minimum', 'dialog', 'rather', 'fantastically', 'rich', 'pallet', 'pictures', 'very', 'close', 'ups', 'mini', 'glimpses', 'life', 'believe', 'have', 'be', 'little', 'mature', 'still', 'have', 'sort', 'sensitivity', 'left', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'must', 'leave', 'prejudices', 'door', 'Now', 'one', 'only', 'complaint', 'ending', 'done', 'artsy', 'crafty', 'way', 'not', 'strings', 'tied', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'finish', 'film', 'head', 'way', 'finish', 'up', 'have', 'compare', 'stupid', 'skit', 'learned', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Boyscouts', 'A', 'B52', 'Bomber', 'was', 'limping', 'back', 'base', 'shot', 'up', 'very', 'badly', 'fire', 'Suddenly', 'power', 'dive', 'board', 'screaming', 'ground', 'Just', '3', 'feet', 'ground', 'everything', 'stops', 'Captain', 'heard', 'intercom', 'saying', 'Everything', 'right', 'lads', 'just', 'ran', 'gas', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'five', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'comments']",N/A

371024,A3NGH3DOKQFCWD,6303379222,Ben Jordan,"[5, 5]","A young girl leaves home to live and work for a wealthy family during the war with America. She rises early, works all day and goes to bed late. She is hassled initially by the children of the family until they grow up. The  husband is rarely home - far too busy drinking, gambling and womanising to  tend to his family, and as she grows older, she watches the family lose its  wealth until the point where they can no longer afford to keep servants,  and she becomes a live-in servant of a wealthy pianist. Although he  initially has a girlfriend, he becomes taken with his new hired-hand, and  they marry. This film is excellent, and relies often on the ample  soundtrack and facial expressions of the girl, whose delight in all that is  simple (she spends ages watching the insects go about their business at one  stage) is a sheer delight. And although we see more of her at this stage of  her life, the actress who plays her when she has reached her twenties in  the last third of the film is no less capable. The war is kept in the  background - simply as something which was happening at the time.

371025,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303379222,Bobby Underwood,"[13, 13]","This lovely and subtle film washes over you like a gentle tropical rain. The dialog is sparse and the beauty dense in director Anh Hung Tran's portrait of a young servant girl in 1951 Saigon and those she serves. There is an intimacy to this film seldom if ever seen on screen. The simple beauty of nature and its effect on living can actually be felt by the viewer. We can hear the birds chirping and the sound of crickets all through this film just as though we are there.Man San Lu portrays young Mui as she first comes to serve this family. She learns to cook and do her other tasks from an older servant who has been with this family for many years. You can almost smell the dishes as Mui learns the craft, the film itself a delicious study in our senses.Young and pretty Mui finds beauty in the world around her and Tran's camera captures both her delight and the joy of nature itself. Mui watches milky nectar drip onto leaves of small trees and we see through her eyes what we sometimes take for granted.This beautiful photography is used to capture more than just nature though. Mui's Mistress (Thi Loc Troung) has lost a daughter in the past who would now be Mui's age. When her husband runs away from his family and takes the money she has saved from her small business in Saigon selling fabric, more of the past is revealed. This is not the first time he has run off with the money and a woman. It is heartbreaking when we overhear her mother blaming her for what he has done.Mui has come to care for the Mistress and she in turn has begun to look upon Mui as the daughter she lost, hoping her oldest son will grow up and take her for his wife. But it is not to be as times become even harder and the Mistress has to release Mui in a scene filled with kindness and sadness. The film has affected us in such a way that this moment takes on a true intimacy because we know the sweetness of Mui and the dignity of her Mistress who can no longer hide her heart.Tran moves forward in time 10 years and beautiful Tran Nu Yen-Khe is Mui, now serving a young and upper class French conservatory student. He is more modern and successful and contrasts the old and new of a changing Saigon. His rich girlfriend is perfect for his life but as we have watched the joy and sweetness of Mui we understand completely why he drops her and breaks tradition by taking Mui instead. It will lead to happiness and one more thought about nature, both floral and human.This gentle film has a beauty you can almost touch and you will find yourself thinking about it for some time afterward. This truly great director has taken a simple story with little dialog and created an emotionally rich film like no other. It is not your typical linear story, but film as art, and one that anyone who loves the cinematic aspects of film will relish in.

Erland,"[2, 2]","Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.I would never have thought that a movie so simplistic, with so little dialogue could turn into such an exquiste viewing experience. In what is unquestionably one of the most hauntingly beautiful visual cinematic experiences ever 'The Scent of Green Papayas' is a tale of a little ten year old Vietnamese girl named Mui (Man San Lu) who arrives at the home of a moderately well-off family to begin her new duties as a house servant. Her life of servitude finally pays off some ten years later when her quiet beauty and gentle patient ways are recognized by the young master of the house and makes her his wife and expectant mother of his first child.Nothing complicated here, nor is there anything that one could consider incisive, intelligent dialogue or a highly original storyline. It's the cinematography that initially pulls the viewer into the beautiful Vietnamese world of '51 and that initial interest is soon enhanced by the presence of the sweet and demure young Man San Lu who captures your heart with her innocent, obedient demeanor.Surprisingly a good two-thirds of the movie deals with Mui in the early years of her household duties. It's only in the final third of the film that Mui appears as an exotically beautiful twenty year old now played by Tran Nu Yen-Khe. Though fully grown, she still retains all of the endearing qualities she had as a child. Quiet, introspective, patient, unassuming, hard working and too attractive to ignore.If you're in the mood for a visually beautiful film with an even more captivating lead actress (Tran) this is your film.

371028,A16BJ43Z46QS3N,6303379222,C. L Wilson,"[0, 1]","This movie certainly beat to a different drummer, a VERY SLOW drummer.  Visually striking and lushly photographed, it could be called a minimalist film.  No emotion was shown except in one tantrum by the fiancee, in spite of the fact that a great deal was happening and had happened.  Was meticulous in showing daily life in Saigon in 1951 and 1961.  The roar of airplanes barely heard in the 50s had become thunderous and close by in '61.  That was a wonderful touch, just the barest hint of impending doom for the way of life portrayed.  But it moved too slow; people just do not move that slow physically.  And I cannot say that I thought the acting was terrific either, since the script really didn't call for any.  Its main strength lies purely in the cinematography and perhaps, in our minds, as the first feature by a Vietnamese (albeit now a Parisian) about pre-war Saigon.

I thought it was only me but am pleased to see others here who also appreciate this beautiful film.  At this point, all we can do is hope that it is re-issued on DVD or that a geat Blu-Ray transfer becomes available.A great transfer is what this gorgeous-looking film deserves. Most scenes are extremely aesthetic, with beautiful muted browns and greens.The closeups of the young girl's cute face, and then later as young woman; the closeups of the insects, the house, food, shrubbery, et, care all very pretty to view. The background noises are unique, too. Much of the time you hear birds or insects; it's quit different.  Obviously, this is a movie of visual and audio treats.Many people will be turned off with the slow story, one of the slowest-moving films I have ever witnessed, so at least you've been warned on that aspect.

371030,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303379222,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 6]","This is a kind of Cinderella tale set in Saigon during the 1950s in which the yin and yang principles of the masculine element and the feminine are played out once again.  We find ourselves in the airy, beautifully-appointed house of a well-to-do merchant family that has just hired a new servant.  She is ten-year-old M&ugrave;i, played with grace and a kind of magical innocence by Man San Lu, who bestows her beatific little smile on all the little wonders of the world she sees around her.  She learns her job quickly and works hard, always with a positive attitude.  She loves all living things including insects and frogs.  She tolerates the boorish behavior of the youngest son of the household who directs some indelicate gestures in her direction.  Like a Taoist monk she just observes, judges not and says nothing.Well, we know somebody is going to take notice of this splendid jeune fille, some wise young man, and when she comes of age, marry her and elevate her station in life.  Meanwhile the head of household squanders the family's funds and ten years pass.  Now the family is almost broke and M&ugrave;i is sent to be the housekeeper and cook for Khuyen, played attractively by Hoa Hoi Vuong.  She is now played by Tran Nu Yn-Kh who falls in love with the young man who is a classical pianist.  Unfortunately he has a girl friend, a stylish woman of the city from a well-to-do family.  Finally we have a bit of tension!This, then, is an ""art house"" movie in which director Anh Hung Tran tells the story primarily with images and symbolism, and that he does very well.  But the disjunction of the two very slight plots is never overcome, and the startling lack of any tension until near the end is disappointing.  The central image of the film, the green papaya with the immature seeds inside representing the potential of the little girl is however not to be forgotten.What carries this slow-moving extended vignette of ante-bellum Saigon, and saves us from abject boredom are the beautiful sets nestled in greenery with the Buddhist artwork, the wooden Venetian-slotted doors, the partitions, the lattice work, the vases, the statues, the arresting music, both eastern and western, the intensively focused cinematography, and the charm of ten-year-old Man San Lu.  Many viewers, however charmed, will not stay for the finale, which will be too bad because it is in the later stages of the film that the fairy-tale quality of the film is fully realized.  M&ugrave;i of course has come of age, and the developing love affair is revealed purely through camera work without any dialogue.Incidentally, I was somewhat surprised to learn that this beautifully rendered film was shot not on locale in Saigon, Vietnam where the action takes place, but in a Paris studio!  This makes me imagine that the trees, especially the papaya tree in the central courtyard, and the little animals, the frogs and geckos were shipped in.  It also makes me realize that the ants that the one boy drips hot candle wax on, the ants that M&ugrave;i admires and her cricket in a cage are most likely Parisians!",4,"Familiar, slow-moving story beautifully presented",1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,3101,"['kind', 'Cinderella', 'tale', 'set', 'Saigon', '1950s', 'yin', 'yang', 'principles', 'masculine', 'element', 'feminine', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'airy', 'beautifully-appointed', 'house', 'well-to-do', 'merchant', 'family', 'just', 'hired', 'new', 'servant', 'ten-year-old', 'M', 'ugrave', 'i', 'played', 'grace', 'kind', 'magical', 'innocence', 'Man', 'San', 'Lu', 'who', 'beatific', 'little', 'smile', 'little', 'wonders', 'world', 'job', 'quickly', 'hard', 'always', 'positive', 'attitude', 'living', 'things', 'including', 'insects', 'frogs', 'boorish', 'behavior', 'youngest', 'son', 'household', 'who', 'indelicate', 'gestures', 'direction', 'Taoist', 'monk', 'just', 'observes', 'judges', 'not', 'nothing.Well', 'know', 'somebody', 'going', 'take', 'notice', 'splendid', 'jeune', 'fille', 'wise', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'age', 'marry', 'elevate', 'station', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'head', 'household', 'squanders', 'family', 'funds', 'ten', 'years', 'pass', 'Now', 'family', 'almost', 'broke', 'M', 'ugrave', 'i', 'sent', 'be', 'housekeeper', 'cook', 'Khuyen', 'played', 'attractively', 'Hoa', 'Hoi', 'Vuong', 'now', 'played', 'Tran', 'Nu', 'Yn-Kh', 'who', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'classical', 'pianist', 'Unfortunately', 'girl', 'friend', 'stylish', 'woman', 'city', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'Finally', 'have', 'bit', 'tension', 'then', 'art', 'house', 'movie', 'director', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'Tran', 'story', 'primarily', 'images', 'symbolism', 'very', 'well', 'disjunction', 'two', 'very', 'slight', 'plots', 'never', 'overcome', 'startling', 'lack', 'tension', 'end', 'disappointing', 'central', 'image', 'film', 'green', 'papaya', 'immature', 'seeds', 'representing', 'potential', 'little', 'girl', 'however', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten.What', 'slow-moving', 'extended', 'vignette', 'ante-bellum', 'Saigon', 'abject', 'boredom', 'are', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'nestled', 'greenery', 'Buddhist', 'artwork', 'wooden', 'Venetian-slotted', 'doors', 'partitions', 'lattice', 'work', 'vases', 'statues', 'arresting', 'music', 'eastern', 'western', 'intensively', 'focused', 'cinematography', 'charm', 'ten-year-old', 'Man', 'San', 'Lu', 'Many', 'viewers', 'however', 'charmed', 'will', 'not', 'stay', 'finale', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'later', 'stages', 'film', 'fairy-tale', 'quality', 'film', 'fully', 'realized', 'M', 'ugrave', 'i', 'course', 'come', 'age', 'developing', 'love', 'affair', 'revealed', 'purely', 'camera', 'work', 'dialogue.Incidentally', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'learn', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'not', 'locale', 'Saigon', 'Vietnam', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'Paris', 'studio', 'imagine', 'trees', 'especially', 'papaya', 'tree', 'central', 'courtyard', 'little', 'animals', 'frogs', 'geckos', 'were', 'shipped', 'also', 'realize', 'ants', 'one', 'boy', 'hot', 'candle', 'wax', 'ants', 'M', 'ugrave', 'i', 'admires', 'cricket', 'cage', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'Parisians']",N/A

371034,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6303379222,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[16, 18]","This film captures beautiful images as seen by the naked eye when the camera hones in on such natural wonders as a frog on a large green leaf, an ant carrrying a crumb or a papaya tree with green ripening fruit located outside one's window. Or when the camera scans the the interior of the home and captures oriental lattice work on a porch railing or a screen wall divider or porcelain vases on a credence. These images are impressed both on the viewer and on the mind of Mui, a nine year old Vietnamese girl from a small village who gets a job as servant in the household of shopkeepers. The artistic use of cinematography leaves the viewer with a sense of wonder and anticipation, expecting to be spellbound by even more mysterious oriental imagery - the viewer will not be disappointed! This feeling and tone is mesmerizing as so much beauty and such a wonderful love story unfolds  ... with a minimum of dialogue.Mui learns the household routine from an older servant ... She awakens early to make breakfast, cleans the floors on her hands and knees, and learns to prepare delicious and colorful meals using a wok....The family has three sons, one is older, almost an adult, two are younger - the middle son is about 11 or 12 years old, the youngest is about 5 or 6 years and very mischevious. The family business is selling textiles. Mui is treated kindly and later learns the family had a daughter who would be exactly Mui's age. She died of  a mysterious disease. There is slight tension within the family regarding the business. The wife runs the business impeccably. She keeps accounts accurately and locks up the cash in a safe. Her husband often spends his time daydreaming and playing an oriental stringed instrument, sometimes accompaned on a flute by the eldest son. In the past, the husband had abruptly left the household, taking all the cash and likely gambling away their savings. After one such episode, his baby daughter became ill and died exactly the day before he returned. This event haunts him ...One day, the servants were awaiting his return for dinner but he does not show up. The wife was notified. She checked his room and then went to the safe only to discover all the household cash and savings were gone. He did not break his gambling habit. His wife gave some gold earrings to pawn to have enough money to buy rice for the meals. She sold some of her antique vases to make ends meet. Eventually, he returned but was ill. Despite the best Oriental medicine, including acupuncture and moxibustion, his health deteriorated and he died. Ten years passed and the textile business was waning. Mui was still employed by the same family who were contemplating sending her to work for a wealthier family since they could not afford to keep her any longer.Mui accepted the news sadly and received a pearl necklace and gold bracelet as parting gifts from her former mistress. The mistress tearfully bid her good-bye, telling Mui how much she appreciated having her live in their home, feeling Mui was like her own daughter. Mui became the only servant to a bachelor musician/composer who was engaged to be married. His fiance intimated and teased him about having a young pretty servant but he ignored her jibes. The fiance was a modern VietnaMmese woman for the 1950's. She felt secure in her position and looked forward to an upper class lifestyle. Her confidence gradually eroded into jealousy as she suspected the musician had feelings for Mui and even possibly a physical relationship ...Mui discovered a sketch of herself in a drawer in the musician's bedroom. She also found a tube of lipstick left there by his fiance . Despite her shyness, one day, when the musician was not at home, she dressed up in a silk dress and Vietnamese silk pants, putting on the lipstick and viewing herself in the mirror, dreaming of a lifestyle outside of the one she lived. That very day, the musician came home early. He wandered around his house, trying to find Mui. They were playing hide-and-seek, a cat-and-mouse game with each other. She deftly hid behind a door as he came around the corner and did not find her. She darted into her room and took off her fine clothes and lipstick. He silently tip-toed to her part of the house,gingerly opened her door ... and his fiance's greatest fears became realitiy. The film very sensitively portrays the unraveling of their engagement and delicately intimates the growing love between the musician and his servant. All of it is shown naturally, yet without any explicit scenes. By far, this is among the best oriental love stories ever shown on film.

371035,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,6303379222,.fgd,"[0, 0]","The music is magical. Even if you dont gel with the ""abstracted"" harmonics of asian flute or string music,  it befits this french-vietnamese production. I dont get chinese-type music but my sense is the the director has a good ear. A homogenous-blah soundtrack would have unquestioningly killed this film. Later it moves into classical piano played by the son.In sensability this film is geared towards its Vietnamese audience with the onus on feminine asian virtue and its play on peace and harmony through meditation and awareness of Bhudda nature, In this context the arena of domestic  life. Meanwhile, since father and sons study music there is an arty flavour to the film.Western audiences may experience some impatience with the idea of willing female house slaves. Or the father who leaves the wife without any housekeeping while yet on a guilty adulterous spree and not for the first time. Not to do a spoiler but the son is also  pretty rotten to his wife at the end.Most of the film , until last 20 mins,  is Mui as a child. When she blossums into a woman,  her neck seems too long and she is  gormless in her innocent delight. But as I said, she is an Asian feminine idealisation. Actually I forsee the same fate awaiting her as the other wives in the film, which made the ending unsatisfactory. The film is wonderful when Mui is a child but anti-climatic as a young woman because there is no coutship between the son and Mui. It is important we see more of her sexuality especially with the son playing such stirring western classical piano music. All we got was a shot of the base of her neck while she was drying her hair,which i have been informed, is full of erotic implications in the East.Quite obviously his sensability does not intend to empty into the sound of one-hand clapping and the perfect neutral mind of Bhuddist meditation awareness. The potential for irony was compleletly missed at the end regarding her fate and unreassured by zero flirtation between them or  the whole cat and mouse seduction game wether they were destined or not. In the context of the film, it could have still been played out with great taste  and poetic sensability instead of assiduously avoided.Western domestic values have their pit-falls as well; I'd be the last one to foist them on Asian or Moslem cultures who seem to have a better idea of the old fashion values of family as contained within the sanctuary of home against invasion from outside forces ie media, expensive toys that create for the child rather than prompt iniitiative  The joy of this film is its play on the subtle aspects of daily life, even chores,  and mentally travelling light ; a reminder about living in the moment. It's actually the only reality there is or true state of happiness. Mui is gifted with what Bhuddists call Mindfulness so she can escape the drudgery of child labour. Easy to do in such a clean, quiet natural surroundings.

In its own, nearly wordless, way it tells the story of Mui, a poor Vietnamese girl that leaves her family (whom we never see) to act as a middle-class family's servant. Many of the film's early scenes show us Mui's introduction to this new household, as she learns to cook and perform her chores, and as the youngest son of the home taunts her. Mui's character remains relatively mute as she observes the world around her. The film watches her as she delights as ants scurry to retrieve a piece of food, and then contrasts that image with one that shows one of the sons as he drips hot wax onto a group of ants. The moral seems pretty overt here: we should pause to consider even the lowest members of society, rather than antagonize them.Just as it begins to feel too simple for its own good, however, the film leaps ahead ten years. The family, due to financial strain, has to release Mui from their service, and she ends up working for a young conservatory student. The film's politics take on a new dimension here. We notice that her new employer has an apartment that is decorated with western artifacts. He studies at a French academy, where he plays the piano (The film is, tellingly, a co-production of France and Vietnam.). This is in stark contrast to the family that Mui previously worked for. Their music was played on traditional Vietnamese instruments, and their home was a collection of antiques. That the first household has failed becomes another bold political statement here. That the film is able to fully convey political concerns without ever actually having a character utter a word about politics is one of its achievements. That it can do so while remaining completely within the context of Mui's simple life is sheer elegance. Its argument that even the most nonpolitical citizens feel the impact of political change is given an uplifting shot in the arm with the film's ending.The film deservedly won the Camera D'Or at Cannes. It's a stunning first feature. There are many shots that combine several stunning compositions with fluid camera motion. Every time the camera pauses, we expect the shot to end, but it moves deeper into the frame to find something else to look at. I find this sort of filmmaking, which is present in such films as Tarkovsky's The Mirror or Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons, somehow purer than most. This style is perfectly suited to a film that slowly reveals layers that would not be apparent to those that were not willing to look more closely at what's on screen.",4,A beautifully crafted debut film...,1005350400,"11 10, 2001",2001,2657,"['Anh', 'Hung', 'Tran', 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya', 'film', 'so', 'outwardly', 'modest', 'goals', 'easy', 'underestimate', 'own', 'nearly', 'wordless', 'way', 'story', 'Mui', 'poor', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'family', 'whom', 'never', 'see', 'act', 'middle-class', 'family', 'servant', 'Many', 'film', 'early', 'scenes', 'show', 'Mui', 'introduction', 'new', 'household', 'cook', 'perform', 'chores', 'youngest', 'son', 'home', 'Mui', 'character', 'relatively', 'mute', 'world', 'film', 'ants', 'scurry', 'retrieve', 'piece', 'food', 'then', 'image', 'one', 'one', 'sons', 'hot', 'wax', 'group', 'ants', 'moral', 'pretty', 'overt', 'here', 'should', 'pause', 'consider', 'even', 'lowest', 'members', 'society', 'rather', 'antagonize', 'them.Just', 'feel', 'too', 'simple', 'own', 'good', 'however', 'film', 'ahead', 'ten', 'years', 'family', 'due', 'financial', 'strain', 'release', 'Mui', 'service', 'up', 'working', 'young', 'conservatory', 'student', 'film', 'politics', 'take', 'new', 'dimension', 'here', 'notice', 'new', 'employer', 'apartment', 'decorated', 'western', 'artifacts', 'studies', 'French', 'academy', 'where', 'piano', 'film', 'tellingly', 'co-production', 'France', 'Vietnam.', 'stark', 'contrast', 'family', 'Mui', 'previously', 'worked', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'traditional', 'Vietnamese', 'instruments', 'home', 'was', 'collection', 'antiques', 'first', 'household', 'failed', 'becomes', 'bold', 'political', 'statement', 'here', 'film', 'able', 'fully', 'convey', 'political', 'concerns', 'ever', 'actually', 'having', 'character', 'utter', 'word', 'politics', 'one', 'achievements', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'remaining', 'completely', 'context', 'Mui', 'simple', 'life', 'sheer', 'elegance', 'argument', 'even', 'most', 'nonpolitical', 'citizens', 'feel', 'impact', 'political', 'change', 'given', 'uplifting', 'shot', 'arm', 'film', 'ending.The', 'film', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Camera', ""D'Or"", 'Cannes', 'stunning', 'first', 'feature', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'combine', 'several', 'stunning', 'compositions', 'fluid', 'camera', 'motion', 'time', 'camera', 'expect', 'shot', 'end', 'deeper', 'frame', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'look', 'find', 'sort', 'filmmaking', 'present', 'such', 'films', 'Tarkovsky', 'Mirror', 'Welles', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'somehow', 'purer', 'most', 'style', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'film', 'slowly', 'layers', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'apparent', 'were', 'not', 'willing', 'look', 'more', 'closely', 'what', 'screen']",N/A

With a bare minimum of dialogue, Tran brings to the screen the story of Mui, a 10 year old Vietnamese girl  who comes from the country to Saigon in the early 1950's as a live-in  servant to an upper-class family whose wealth is being squandered by the  dissolute and womanizing head of the house.Mui is a simple soul who finds  delight in things most of us take for granted; the exquisite cinematography  in this film brings out the beauty in the most ordinary objects and lets us  share in Mui's sense of wonder and discovery.  Ten years later, when the  family's wealth has been dissipated to the point where they can no longer  afford a live-in servant, Mui is sent to work for a wealthy young pianist,  Khuyen, the friend of the eldest son of her former employers.  Khuyen is  engaged to be married but in Mui he finds the peace and serenity that is  lacking in his shallow and materialistic fiancee.In very basic terms,  ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" could be called a Vietnamese  Cinderella story, except for the lack of a wicked stepmother.  Despite the  almost total lack of dialogue in the second half of the film, the movie is  so beautifully crafted, and techically and emotionally so satisfying, that  you come away awed with how Tran was able to do so much with so little.

Separated from her mother at such a young age, Mui takes the world in stride, enjoying and savoring all that is around her. Even the simple scent of green papaya charms her. She is definitely someone who looks at her glass as being half-full rather than half-empty.She comes to the household like a breath of fresh air. The household consists of a mother, a father, three sons, and the grandmother, the father's mother. The mother (Thi Loc Truong) seems to be a somewhat unhappy woman. Having lost her only daughter, a child that would have been Mui's age had she lived, the sight of Mui makes her happy. She otherwise has little about which to be happy. The father (Ngoc Trung Tran), a seemingly uncommunicative man, spends his time playing melancholic music. He occasionally leaves the household for months at a time, taking with him the family's money and small valuables in order to carouse and have a good time, leaving the mother to fend for the family as best that she can. The grandmother is given to berating her, blaming her for the father's absences.There are three sons in the household, two young ones who play pranks and torment others, as well as a much older son, whose best friend, Khuyen (Hoa Hoi Vuong), occasionally comes to dinner. It is there that he first catches Mui's eye, and she is smitten, developing a little crush on him. Ten years later, with the family on the skids, their wealth having dissipated, the father and mother-in-law now dead, the oldest son married to a shrew, a now twenty year old Mui (Tran Nu Yen Khe), who is quite lovely to look at, can no longer remain in the household, as they can no longer afford to keep her. She is to go and work in the household of the wealthy Khuyen. The mother, heartbroken at Mui's leaving, gives her valuable gifts that she would have given her own daughter, had she but lived.When Mui goes to Khuyen's westernized household, the influence of the French being obvious, Khuyen is engaged to a very cosmopolitan and worldly woman who makes demands upon Khuyen that upset the harmony of his life. Khuyen is an artist, as he is a composer and pianist. Mui quietly walks around the fringes of his life, bringing peace, harmony, and beauty along with her. Comparisons to Khuyen's fiance are inescapable. Mui is now a beautiful young woman who still delights in the simplest things around her. One day she decides to use the valuable gifts that her former employer gave her. The artist in Khuyen cannot help but notice. It is then that Mui's life is transformed and becomes the stuff of fairytales.Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, this is simply a beautiful film. With a minimum of dialogue, the director, Tran Anh Hung, who also wrote the screenplay, manages to convey much, exacting exquisite performances from the entire cast. It is Mui, however, who captures the heart of the viewer. Mui is a pure delight, patient, joyful, and loving. It is the role of Mui that is central to the film, and both actresses succeed brilliantly in anchoring the film through their respective portrayals. Moreover, although most of the film takes place in the two households in which Mui works, the film does not cease to fascinate.

Whereas in the West, we want to know the story and how it reaches its climax, often in the East, how the story plays is much more important.  So the journey itself is more important than point to which it arrives.  ""The Scent of Green Papaya,"" the first of 3 films I could find by director Tran Anh Hung (Cyclo & The Vertical Ray of the Sun), likewise focuses more on the journey itself than the climax.  Lu Man San as 10-year old Mui seems remarkably well adjusted for a little girl separated from her mother & village and sent to work as a domestic in an urban household.  As the mother of the new household, Trong Thi Loc has a great tenderness for Mui since she is the same age as the mother's daughter who died years earlier.  Tran Ngoc Trung as the father enjoys playing music, although there is very little hint of how he makes his money.  In fact, he absconds with the household funds periodically to go on what we assume to be pleasure binges.  There are 3 brothers in the household, an older brother whose best friend Khuyen becomes a pivotal character, a middle brother who enjoys drowning ants in hot wax, and the youngest boy whose flatulence and urination into urns seems to be cute.  As the story fast-forwards 10 years, Tran Nu Yen-Khe who has acted in each of Tran Anh Hung's films becomes Mui.  The father has died & Mui is sent to live with Khuyen as a domestic housekeeper.  She silently falls in love with Khuyen and dresses up for him.  Khuyen played by the good-looking Vvong Hoa Hoi eventually boots his fiancee to the curb to visit Mui @ midnight.  The film doesn't really climax as much as it just stops as Mui contemplates herself as a mother.  The photography and attention to detail in the sets transports us to another time and era.  We really believe we are in Vietnam.  The film had an Oscar nomination in 1993 and won the Cannes Camera D'Or award & a French Academy award.

Basically it's a snapshot of life in Vietnam in 1951 and then in 1961.  It was filmed in France, however, because the upscale household images and way of life no longer exist in modern Vietnam.The film centers on the experiences of a young servant girl named Mui who comes to work for a prosperous family at the age of 10.  She's a beautiful young girl and is wide-eyed with wonder at the world around her.  The audience sees the world through her eyes - the plants and the insects and the drops of water. There's a simplicity of the cinematography that is refreshingly lovely and its easy to get caught up in the sensuous nature of the story.  Later, when the story jumps ahead 10 years and we meet Mui as a young woman, now a servant in the home of a musician who she has always adored, the story turns into a romance.I think the theme was good and so was the acting.  I could almost smell the soft aroma of the papaya as it was cut from the tree and prepared for dinner. But soon the novelty of this almost dialogue-less film became boring and I kept looking at the clock and hoping it would end soon.  Therefore, when the last two scenes of this rental DVD were defective, I was actually glad to not have to sit through the last ten minutes.  And I have no intention of having the defective copy replaced and viewing it again.This is an interesting film because it is different.  But it's a just a little too different for my taste.

The sight, the sound and the implied scent of nature produce an astounding mix. It is a feast to our senses. But film is ultimately compromised by a lack of dialogue and dramatic content. I guess one can argue that the film is self-contained within the director's minimalist framework. But there's a big gap in our suspense of disbelief to have the young master to stumble upon  his servant girl secretly trying out his fiance's lipstick, and realizing how beautiful (both outward and inward) she is, then follow her trail back to her room and inpregnate her. All this without them ever speaking single a word to each other (or at least not anything meaningful that I can recall), is just not quite convincing. And how do we know that this young master is any better than the good-for-nothing head of the house from the previous family? Both of them are musicians after all. I think the second part of the movie is particularly weak. I can accept the main character being shy and reticent when she was a little girl in the first part of the movie. But the fact that she stays that way after she has growup is disappointing. I also expect something to be said about the 2 little brothers in the second part since their different personalities were so painstakingly portayed in the first part.

The gleam of freshly boiled grains of rice, the glow of embers in an open stove, the trickle of cool water over the face and shoulders of a woman bathing--these images convey the essence of the simple story. The plot, which seems almost incidental, follows the childhood and young adulthood of Mui, a country girl who comes to Saigon as servant to a merchant family. After ten years of service, following the decline of the family's fortunes, Mui becomes a maid in the house of Khuyen, a handsome, wealthy would-be composer. The luminously beautiful Tran Nu Yen-Khe plays the adult Mui with a remarkably understated delicacy.

371059,A2YBWBVOW7G7KH,6303379222,"R. Corson ""alternity""","[3, 3]","This movie has no action, very little dialog, and a very simple plot, but I was riveted to the television until it was over. It wasn't the anticipation of ""what will happen next?"" but ""what will I see next?"" that kept me interested. I believed I was in Viet Nam in the fifties observing a real girl's life.This is a very unique film. The most amazing thing about it is the cinematography. The way the director follows action in each scene is wonderful. The scenes are often filmed through windows and doorways or through the decorative lattice of a window. Normally, with the camera in the same room as the actors, the viewer experience is unnatural; the viewer feels that he is imposing on the characters which is not something he might normally do, so the experience feels artificial. However, the remote vantage of this director's technique makes it feel as if the viewer is actually watching a real life drama being played out. The characters are unaware of his presence and so their behavior must be natural and unaltered. Of course, it is the job of actors to behave as if the camera is not an imposition, but this additional overtly serendipitous view makes the viewer feel even more invisible. The sets are carefully designed and the motion of the action carefully choreographed so that this filming technique can be used for amazingly long intervals. The first such sequence when little Mui is admitted to the house and then delivered to the servant gives the viewer a nearly complete tour of the house and wets the his appetite for similar sequences to occur later in the film. A second unique quality of the cinematography is the scene to scene transitions. These are wonderfully choreographed. Often as a scene nears its end, in the background, perhaps through a window or a fence, the viewer can see the initial action of the next scene. Or sometimes it is the end of a previous scene that the viewer will see in the background. In this way many scenes are linked seamlessly by concurrent foreground and background action. This director is a genius.The soundtrack should not be overlooked. All the sounds that one might take for granted in life are in this soundtrack. The sounds of birds and insects are almost always present. The sounds of life in this city are also abundant--airplanes passing overhead, a radio playing somewhere, someone practicing piano next door, etc. (I often go to sleep with this movie playing just to experience the sounds.)Finally, the performance of the young Mui is amazing. There is very little dialog in this movie, but the face of this young actress is so expressive that the lack of dialog is not even noticed. Though never voiced, the crush that the young Mui has on the eldest brothers friend is very obvious; her face just glows when he is present. Her intense interest in ants gathering crumbs is obvious as she pauses whilst chewing her food.",5,Beautiful,987292800,"04 15, 2001",2001,2894,"['movie', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'was', 'riveted', 'television', 'was', 'over', 'was', ""n't"", 'anticipation', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'next', 'kept', 'interested', 'believed', 'was', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'fifties', 'observing', 'real', 'girl', 'life.This', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'cinematography', 'way', 'director', 'action', 'scene', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'filmed', 'windows', 'doorways', 'decorative', 'lattice', 'window', 'Normally', 'camera', 'same', 'room', 'actors', 'viewer', 'experience', 'unnatural', 'viewer', 'feels', 'imposing', 'characters', 'not', 'something', 'might', 'normally', 'do', 'experience', 'artificial', 'However', 'remote', 'vantage', 'director', 'technique', 'feel', 'viewer', 'actually', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'unaware', 'presence', 'so', 'behavior', 'must', 'be', 'natural', 'unaltered', 'course', 'job', 'actors', 'behave', 'camera', 'not', 'imposition', 'additional', 'overtly', 'serendipitous', 'view', 'viewer', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'invisible', 'sets', 'are', 'carefully', 'designed', 'motion', 'action', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'so', 'filming', 'technique', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'amazingly', 'long', 'intervals', 'first', 'such', 'sequence', 'when', 'little', 'Mui', 'admitted', 'house', 'then', 'delivered', 'servant', 'viewer', 'nearly', 'complete', 'tour', 'house', 'appetite', 'similar', 'sequences', 'occur', 'later', 'film', 'second', 'unique', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'scene', 'scene', 'transitions', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'choreographed', 'scene', 'end', 'background', 'perhaps', 'window', 'fence', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'initial', 'action', 'next', 'scene', 'sometimes', 'end', 'previous', 'scene', 'viewer', 'will', 'see', 'background', 'way', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'linked', 'seamlessly', 'concurrent', 'foreground', 'background', 'action', 'director', 'genius.The', 'soundtrack', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'sounds', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'granted', 'life', 'are', 'soundtrack', 'sounds', 'birds', 'insects', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'present', 'sounds', 'life', 'city', 'are', 'also', 'abundant', 'airplanes', 'passing', 'overhead', 'radio', 'playing', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'practicing', 'piano', 'next', 'door', 'etc', 'often', 'go', 'sleep', 'movie', 'playing', 'just', 'experience', 'sounds', 'Finally', 'performance', 'young', 'Mui', 'amazing', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'movie', 'face', 'young', 'actress', 'so', 'expressive', 'lack', 'dialog', 'not', 'even', 'noticed', 'never', 'voiced', 'crush', 'young', 'Mui', 'eldest', 'brothers', 'friend', 'very', 'obvious', 'face', 'just', 'glows', 'when', 'present', 'intense', 'interest', 'ants', 'gathering', 'crumbs', 'obvious', 'whilst', 'chewing', 'food']",N/A
371060,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6303379222,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[15, 18]","I'm always on the lookout for Cinderella type stories. In this story we definitely have a servant and two ""naughty"" step-type brothers instead of sisters. The two boys in this movie don't quite know what to make of their new servant. They almost tend to treat her like a sister in some ways while otherwise completely ignoring her and never really speaking to her. One would imagine that children at that age would look beyond the servant/master issues and actually converse as friends.The ""stepmother"" could be her employer, however Mui is never treated unkindly by her because she reminds her Mistress (Thi Loc Troung) of the daughter who died many years before and would have been the same age. When the family can no longer afford to employ her, she goes to live with a wealthy young pianist.This movie excels in artistic expression and the silent interpretation of dreams and wishes. There is a minimum of dialogue and the most casual observances become almost a cherished encounter with nature. Mui watches little frogs, crickets and ants with a sense of awe while her employer's sons would be happy to kill any insect they found.If you love cooking, you will probably love this movie. You can even get a quick lesson in how to stir-fry. Cooking is done on the floor over coals and Mui takes on the role of chef and housecleaner. There is an emphasis on the rituals of life. The simple is made beautiful. Every natural sound seems amplified. This is not only visually appealing; the sounds of rice being poured into a huge urn or the sizzle of oil in a wok are all spectacularly recorded.Mui is told she will get to see her mother but we never see this occur. In fact, everything in the story takes place in the house or in the surrounding village.Astonishingly beautiful and I can't believe this was shot entirely in Paris. Although, the ending does have a rather Amelie feel to it.

371071,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6303379222,Z Hayes,"[43, 43]","This Vietnamese film is a remarkable piece of film-making. A delight for the senses, there is very little dialogue in this movie and aptly so given that the movements, sounds, facial expressions, etc. are the dominant features of the film. The story's central character is Mui, a ten-year-old girl who has moved to Saigon to work as a house maid. Mui is treated well by the mistress of the house, a woman who is still grieving the loss of her young daughter seven years ago. The fact that Mui is the age her daughter would have been had she lived makes the mistress look kindly upon Mui.Mui soon learns her way about the household (father, mother, and two sons) under the guidance of an older maid who is also the cook. She learns that the master and mistress are not close to each other, and that the master has occasionally run off with the wife's savings to fool around with other women.The movie's charms lie mainly in Mui's portrayal of interest in her surroundings - watching an ant heave a piece of burnt bread; hearing birds sing; frogs croaking, etc. Viewers also get to see Mui's emotional growth from a nave young child into a beautiful young woman, who eventually leaves her old household to find her livelihood in another household, where a relationship develops between Mui and her new master. This is a leisurely-paced movie that allows viewers to luxuriate in every little detail, sights, and sounds without being bombarded by non-stop dialogue or too many characters.
