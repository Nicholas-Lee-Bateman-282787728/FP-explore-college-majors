1278085,A2A2QGGPSG2DLJ,B002MAPFRO,C. Scott Harrison,"[0, 0]",Really fun movie I saw as a kid in the 60s. Really BAD transfer. I mean it looks like it was filmed off a TV with a cheap 8MM camera. It's suppose to be in color and it looks like black&white and sepia tones. Too bad. It even says &#34;Digitally Remastered&#34; on my copy. It most definitely is NOT!  I'd give it four or five stars if it wasn't so screwed up. Please re-issue in a decent transfer. It is barely watchable.,2,"It says ""Digitally Remastered""  Really ???????",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,422,"['Really', 'fun', 'movie', 'saw', 'kid', '60s', 'Really', 'BAD', 'transfer', 'mean', 'was', 'filmed', 'off', 'TV', 'cheap', '8MM', 'camera', 'suppose', 'be', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'sepia', 'tones', 'Too', 'bad', 'even', '34', 'Digitally', 'Remastered', '34', 'copy', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'Please', 're-issue', 'decent', 'transfer', 'barely', 'watchable']",N/A
1278086,A2TDIFABWXWNNP,B002MAPFRO,David L. Bullock,"[2, 2]","This was one of my two favorite ""balloon adventures"" in Africa as a boy. While it must take second place to the seasoned and brilliant actors who graced ""Five Weeks in a Balloon,"" this movie, the ""Flight of the Lost Balloon,"" has its own merits. An explorer has disappeared deep up the southern Nile in the area the Egyptians knew as the ""Sudd"" and the Belgians as the ""Bahr-i-Gazail."" The explorer's wife hires another explorer to take her from East Africa by balloon into the Sudd to find him. As it turns out, her husband was not really seeking lost art, but treasure hidden by an ancient pharoah. Accompanying them is a mysterious and quite unsavory ""emir"" who claims to be the ruler of a lost kingdom. Throw in a tribe of cannibals along the way, the eight-foot giant bodyguard of the emir, mild torture, human greed and .... you get the picture! Make no mistake, this is a solid B-grade action flick suitable for the entire family that will never win an Acadmey award for anything. To my knowledge, this movie has never appeared on DVD before or even on VHS. I had a copy that I burned from Beta to VHS to a home-made DVD. I was looking for an upgrade to my washed out color copy. No luck. Be aware that this DVD copy is also washed out and will drive most modern viewers to distraction. However, where do you get a story line quite like this? A shame the original print has never been restored -- assuming it still exists.",4,A worthy adventure flick for the family,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1429,"['was', 'one', 'two', 'favorite', 'balloon', 'adventures', 'Africa', 'boy', 'must', 'take', 'second', 'place', 'seasoned', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'who', 'graced', 'Five', 'Weeks', 'Balloon', 'movie', 'Flight', 'Lost', 'Balloon', 'own', 'merits', 'explorer', 'disappeared', 'deep', 'southern', 'Nile', 'area', 'Egyptians', 'knew', 'Sudd', 'Belgians', 'Bahr-i-Gazail', 'explorer', 'wife', 'explorer', 'take', 'East', 'Africa', 'balloon', 'Sudd', 'find', 'out', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'seeking', 'lost', 'art', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'ancient', 'pharoah', 'Accompanying', 'mysterious', 'quite', 'unsavory', 'emir', 'who', 'be', 'ruler', 'lost', 'kingdom', 'Throw', 'tribe', 'cannibals', 'way', 'eight-foot', 'giant', 'bodyguard', 'emir', 'mild', 'torture', 'human', 'greed', 'get', 'picture', 'Make', 'mistake', 'solid', 'B-grade', 'action', 'flick', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'Acadmey', 'award', 'anything', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'never', 'appeared', 'DVD', 'even', 'VHS', 'had', 'copy', 'burned', 'Beta', 'VHS', 'home-made', 'DVD', 'was', 'looking', 'upgrade', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'copy', 'luck', 'Be', 'aware', 'DVD', 'copy', 'also', 'washed', 'out', 'will', 'drive', 'most', 'modern', 'viewers', 'distraction', 'However', 'where', 'do', 'get', 'story', 'line', 'quite', 'shame', 'original', 'print', 'never', 'been', 'restored', 'assuming', 'still']",N/A

Loved ""Mysterious Island"" and ""Five Weeks In A Balloon"" and have a soft place for this movie.  BUT, as stated in a previous review, the copy is truly lousy, it does seem like it's recorded off a VHS version.  Washed out colors, scratches galore, jumps in continuity, which is truly a shame because this movie has locations that are absolutely beautiful.  I wish I knew where the location filming was done, it's the true highlight of the film, so it's a real shame more effort was not put into restoring this movie.Mala Powers (""The Unknown Terror"") is just a beautiful sight in the period costumes, Marshall Thompson (""Daktari"", ""It, The Terror From Beyond Space"") was always a reliable, hardworking actor and James Lanphier (""The Pink Panther"") a villan  to root for!  Directed by Nathan Juran (""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"") and produced by Bernard Woolner (""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman""), who churned out many drive-in classics in the late 50's.Glad to have the movie on DVD, but sad that more care wasn't given to it's release.

But I don't think so after suffering and fast forwarding through this. I think I remember the much better &#34;Five weeks in a balloon&#34; which came out a year later. This &#34;flight of the lost balloon&#34; was a weak tea effort to do the same Jules Verne like story on the cheap and get it out before the other movie came out.
