De Koning,"[14, 14]","When I saw my first musical movie ""My dream is yours"" in 1950, films were shown in the Netherlands much later than in USA in those days, I was nearly 15 years, I immediately became an admirer of Doris Day and that has never changed and I do have all of her musicals on DVD now, but at that sametime a few weeks later I saw  ""Look for the silver lining"" and also became an admirer of June Haver. And the tragic story of this film impressed me very much and that still was the same when I saw it again on DVD. I hadn't seen it since 1950 as we don't have TV-channels overhere that show classic films over and over again and this was a film the regular TV-stations have ignored. But thanks to Warner archive series I now can see it again whenever I like. The titlesong has always been one of my favourites and still moves me. I am glad AMAZON makes available titles from the Warner Archive series, allthough they are a little expensive ofcourse, because else we couln't have bought them overhere in Europe. I found the image very good concerning it is not restored, and allthough it has no scene-selection you can push forward with ten minutes interval. I only regret it has no english subtitles.",5,one of the best movie musicals ever,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,1193,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'musical', 'movie', 'dream', 'yours', '1950', 'films', 'were', 'shown', 'Netherlands', 'much', 'later', 'USA', 'days', 'was', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'immediately', 'became', 'admirer', 'Doris', 'Day', 'never', 'changed', 'do', 'have', 'musicals', 'DVD', 'now', 'sametime', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'saw', 'Look', 'silver', 'lining', 'also', 'became', 'admirer', 'June', 'Haver', 'tragic', 'story', 'film', 'impressed', 'very', 'much', 'still', 'was', 'same', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'DVD', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '1950', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'TV-channels', 'show', 'classic', 'films', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'film', 'regular', 'TV-stations', 'have', 'ignored', 'thanks', 'Warner', 'archive', 'series', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'again', 'whenever', 'like', 'titlesong', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favourites', 'still', 'am', 'glad', 'AMAZON', 'available', 'titles', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'series', 'are', 'little', 'expensive', 'ofcourse', 'else', 'coul', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'overhere', 'Europe', 'found', 'image', 'very', 'good', 'concerning', 'not', 'restored', 'scene-selection', 'can', 'push', 'forward', 'ten', 'minutes', 'interval', 'only', 'regret', 'english', 'subtitles']",N/A

A beautiful blonde with long beautiful legs, Haver exhibited a rare combination of talent, vitality, and innocent charm. None of her films -- including this one -- were great, but all of her films were fun to watch. After her contract with Fox expired, Haver -- never obsessed with the artificial glamour of Hollywood -- dropped out of movies and entered a convent. Several months later she left the convent but did not return to movies. Instead she married Fred McMurray, to whom she remained married until his death. Unfortunately, not many of June Haver's movies are currently available on VHS and none are available yet on DVD. If you would like to see why some of us remember this lovely and talented lady so fondly, this movie presents a good opportunity to do so.",4,One of the few June Haver films currently available.,970099200,"09 28, 2000",2000,876,"['1944', '1953', 'June', 'Haver', 'brightened', 'up', 'dozen', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'movies', 'mostly', 'musicals', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'long', 'beautiful', 'legs', 'Haver', 'exhibited', 'rare', 'combination', 'talent', 'vitality', 'innocent', 'charm', 'None', 'films', 'including', 'one', 'were', 'great', 'films', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'contract', 'Fox', 'expired', 'Haver', 'never', 'obsessed', 'artificial', 'glamour', 'Hollywood', 'dropped', 'movies', 'entered', 'convent', 'Several', 'months', 'later', 'left', 'convent', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'movies', 'Instead', 'married', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'whom', 'remained', 'married', 'death', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'many', 'June', 'Haver', 'movies', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'VHS', 'none', 'are', 'available', 'yet', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'why', 'remember', 'lovely', 'talented', 'lady', 'so', 'fondly', 'movie', 'good', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so']",N/A

Jacobs,"[3, 3]","This is a simplified and ""sweetened"" musical biography of early Broadway star Marilyn Miller, featuring June Haver in the title role, and nicely supported by Ray Bolger and Gordon MacRae.  Except for Bolger's fine dancing, I thought most of the musical numbers were only of average quality.  Haver does a great deal of dancing, but nothing exceptional, and MacRae is not given an opportunity to really show off his tremendous voice; the two times he has a potentially nice number to sing, he is interrupted by Haver either talking to him or dancing.  Still, it is an entertaining movie and fine for the whole family.",3,A musical biography of the career of Marilyn Miller,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,616,"['simplified', 'sweetened', 'musical', 'biography', 'early', 'Broadway', 'star', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'featuring', 'June', 'Haver', 'title', 'role', 'nicely', 'supported', 'Ray', 'Bolger', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'Bolger', 'fine', 'dancing', 'thought', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'only', 'average', 'quality', 'Haver', 'great', 'deal', 'dancing', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'MacRae', 'not', 'given', 'opportunity', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'tremendous', 'voice', 'two', 'times', 'potentially', 'nice', 'number', 'sing', 'interrupted', 'Haver', 'either', 'talking', 'dancing', 'Still', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'fine', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

But a lot of people overlook that Fox had another beautiful musical film star during this era and her name was June Haver. She was nearly a decade younger than Grable and Faye and was just gorgeous! Though Grable and Faye's musicals were bigger budgeted and brought in more dough, Haver's musicals show that she was more than a Grable or Faye wannabe!However, when Fox signed Haver in 1944, the studio quickly cast her in several musicals that were originally meant for Alice Faye who turned them. These films were thereby retooled to showcase Haver to her abilities. Though Haver's movies left a smaller impact, her film ""Look For the Silver Lining"" (1949), in which she starred as Marilyn Miller, shows that she was a superb actress and singer. Nevertheless, this didn't make her more popular. Though Haver's movies are enjoyable and have good numbers, sets, and costumes, I must admit that Grable and Faye's films have left a bigger and more permanent impact.In my opinion, if you like Betty Grable or Alice Faye or both, you'll certainly enjoy the performances of the beautiful June Haver in her lesser known Fox musicals. You'll enjoy them... so... BUY THEM!!!!!!!!!",4,Not Betty! Not Alice!
