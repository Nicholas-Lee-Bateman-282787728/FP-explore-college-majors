Why would the company in NY give money to Oliver's company after that horrid office presentation....The whole idea of a diaper company did not help the movie at all and was not needed, in my opinion.  Very boring movie to sit through, but fun to make fun of if you are with a group of friends.

I was little hesitant to watch this movie, I thought it was gonna lack substance and intimacy but I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The chemistry between Peet and Kutcher is sexy and endearing. Kutcher really proves himself than being just a goofball in previous films and Peet really shows her range as an actress (I think she is so under-rated sometimes!) The story is about two strangers who meet on an airplane and don't meet until several years later, and then meet again many years after that as well. I hope A Lot Like Love gets you in a romantic mood, defintely a date movie.

913553,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0009UZGIM,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 14]","I need to confess something to everyone out there reading this review.  While it may shock and/or surprise you, I actually began this film with some rather high expectations.  While most will point out the obvious Ashton Kutcher-Amanda Peet coupling as their reasons why this had to be a horrible film, I actually saw these two as a decent pair.  Yes friends, my name is Andy, and I am an Ashton Kutcher fan.  While That 70s Show may not highlight his career that well, I do believe that The Butterfly Effect was a strong outing.  While I have not seen Guess Who?, I do believe that Kutcher's style of humor is something that I could enjoy in my spare time.  I also saw the coupling with Peet as a bold gesture.  She is a fresh face in the ""romantic comedy"" arena that is flooded with the Meg Ryans of the world.  I also thought that the story was creative, and a definite new twist on a dusty genre.  This was, of course, before I saw A Lot Like Love.  This is what I went into the film expecting, actually, kinda hoping would happen.  Sadly, my expectations were shot down, and I was left with mediocre acting and a stringy plot.  Thankfully, there was nostalgic 90s music interweaved throughout the film to bring some hope to this disappointing plate of cinema.Mediocrity seemed to plague both Kutcher and Peet on the set of this film.  From the material handed to them to what I witnessed on screen, they just didn't seem to jump as high as expected.  Don't get me wrong, they were better than another Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan pairing and they actually seemed rather genuine towards each other on screen, but they just didn't reach for the full potential of their characters.  I must admit, I loved their characters at the beginning of the film.  Honestly, the entire film could have been shuttered around those two opening characters and I would have been more interested, but we grew.  Sorry, the characters grew up over time and eventually they lost themselves.  I couldn't tell whether I should be happy for their changes, or depressed because they lost that youthful nature that surrounded their beginning moments.  Let me explain.  Kutcher, at the beginning of this film, had so much drive, so much energy, and so much dedication to do more in life and be successful.  Peet was a free spirit.  She seemed anti-establishment and pro-spontaneity.  You could look into both of their eyes and see genuine characters there, but then, time passed, and they got lazy.  There is no better word for this, they just seemed to loose their focus.  Perhaps it was the fault of the director, or even the writer, for not keeping individual characters throughout the film.  Kutcher continues with business, but not with the same energy.  Peet does a complete 180 and finds herself living a yuppie life with no complaints.  How did this happen in the course of twenty minutes?  We lost our characters.  By the end of the film, without giving anything away, we find ourselves looking at the same character.  Is that what the director intended?  To show that over time we, as humans, fall into a similar patter and will change dramatically for love?  I had trouble swallowing this and thus found myself getting angry with Kutcher and Peet for allowing this to happen.  Take me back to their youth anytime!As we watched this dismal change in the characters, the plot fell into a similar unwoven sweater scenario.  By that I mean we started with a full sweater of potential, then, about a quarter of the way through (after their first meeting in NYC), a string started to cause the sweater to fray and unravel.  The plot, aka the sweater, from that point just jumped in nearly every direction.  There was yarn going everywhere, yet leading nowhere.  I watched these rather unique characters never reach their full potential due to the story coming undone.  Each time these two met, there were so many angles they could have gone, so many places we could have traveled together, so many pieces of yarn going in possible directions, but some strange reason, the director chose to ""play it safe"".  The most disturbing choice a director could make for a romantic comedy.  By ""playing it safe"", A Lot Like Love eventually fell into the same category as every other romantic comedy produced by the Hollywood recycling machine.  By the end of the film, the sweater had completely lost its shape and we are left with nothing more than clich&eacute;d words surrounded by a clich&eacute; moment that seemed more generic than fun.  Again, how could a film that started with so much potential, end so dismally?  You saw the opportunity, it just was became sad when Nigel Cole could not capture this opportunity and truly make a fantastical film, breaking the boundaries of the romantic comedy.Overall, A Lot Like Love started so strong, but somehow, like an under trained sprinter, lost its wind midway through the film.  In fact, I can put my finger on the moment that it failed.  When we go three years into the future and Peet is completely yuppied up, turned from her original unique character, I knew we had fallen deep into the romantic comedy quicksand.  I am under the belief that Nigel Cole tricked me.  He packaged this film colorfully enough, he used un-clich&eacute; characters and actors in the main roles, and provided a non-linear story that sucked you in within the first 15 minutes, but as you feel like this is a ""different"" type of film, it suddenly changes to your generic romantic comedy.  I was tricked, and I am writing this review in hopes others would not fall prey to the same trap.  If you have seen When Harry Met Sally, than you have seen this film!Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Oliver, this is your life.

913558,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B0009UZGIM,Boggman!,"[4, 6]","This reviewers take on ""A Lot Like Love"" is pretty mixed. First of all, this movie is not really a comedy. Besides the scene where Amanda Peet walks right into a glass sliding door (hilarious) the movie really isn't that funny at all. The movie is much more of a drama. I would say that about 80% of this movie is a drama and about 20% is comedy. The movie is marketed as a romantic comedy, so many viewers may feel a bit disenchanted when the film proves otherwise.As a drama, the movie itself is not all that bad. It tends to lag and drag and is all too predictable, however there is no denying the charm of Kutcher and Peet. While their chemistry isn't the greatest, it is still very prevalent throughout the film. The film revolves around a series of encounters with Kutcher and Peet throughout the years. They always seem to be drawn to one another but previous commitments and/or plans always seem them to pull them apart until the next chance encounter. Basically, the film comes down to a question of ""will they ever be together for good""?  What do you think? No surprise there! However, the journey getting there plays out a little too long in this reviewers opinion.The soundtrack is good, & the acting and performances of the two leads are credible. All in all...worth a one time viewing if you've got the time. One very annoying thing about this film are Amanda Peet's BAD BAD wigs through the first half.

Well, it's hard to get cuter than the guy starts to walk out of the bathroom at thirty-seven thousand feet and gets shoved right back in by the girl who locks the door behind her and initiates him into the mile-high club.  (Considering that it was Amanda Peet doing the shoving, how lucky can a guy get?)Next you've got to have kinky and cute--either the guy or the girl.  Amanda Peet as Emily is clearly cute and (ahem, kinky), while Ashton Kutcher, the ditzy but adorable heartthrob of TV's ""That Seventies Show,"" plays it mostly straight as still-living-at-home Oliver Martin.  It seems that she was just on the rebound as she rushed him into the mile-high club, so it didn't mean a thing.  She was just proving to herself that she is still attractive.  And so, dude, good-bye.Yes, you've got to have complications, lots of them, to keep the lovers apart until the final reel.  Shakespeare had 'em.  Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy had 'em, Audrey Hepburn had 'em, and God knows Meg Ryan and various beaux had 'em galore.  Here Emily really doesn't see Oliver as quite the alpha male she had in mind, but three years later when she finds herself dumped and without a date for New Year's Eve she comes across his phone number (he wanted her to call him in six years to find out that he was a great success with a beautiful wife, etc., and no longer living at home).  So she calls and asks him out.Well, enough about the specifics of the plot.  It doesn't matter.  The plot is just a way to throw them together so that they find out after many mishaps, heartbreaks, misadventures and just plain old-fashioned boy and girl fun that they are truly in love.  After all wasn't it the Bard who said that ""The course of true love never did run smooth""?  (from A Midsummer-Night's Dream)Although I am a little (just a little) too old for this movie, I did find it enjoyable.  Peet is as pretty as pretty has any right to be, and tall, handsome Kutcher has an infectious, likable quality about him, so even though the movie was not as clever nor as smart as some romantic comedies, it was nonetheless a step above eye candy, and a nice diversion for a dateless Saturday night--or actually, I think it would work even better as a first-date kind of movie or even a been-married-for-five-years movie for the both of you.

913569,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009UZGIM,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 4]","There is a certain manufactured charm to this 2005 romantic comedy given its predilection to be a hybrid betweenWhen Harry Met Sally...andBefore Sunrise/Before Sunsetwith faint echoes of any number of classic time-spanning romances likeSame Time, Next YearandTwo for the Road. Unfortunately, the comparisons do not benefit this film given the colorless way that first-time screenwriter Colin Patrick Lynch has spelled out the formulaic elements of the story. An additional burden falls on the attractive leads, Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet, neither of whom seem fully formed as screen personas with any gravitas to keep us interested in the hapless characters they portray.Directed by Nigel Cole in a relatively adroit manner, the episodic story centers on Oliver and Emily, a case study in opposites who begin an unexpected relationship with a bathroom fling on a transcontinental flight to New York. They have a day-long romantic whirl once they touch ground but soon part with no expectation of seeing each other again. This episode represents the ongoing structure of the plot, as they continue to meet up again and again over the course of seven years, experiencing the inevitable sparks but allowing professional and romantic complications to act as a perpetual barrier to any lasting commitment.Contrived plot turns as presented here could be at least redeemed by the charms of the stars, but this is a stumbling block. As he showed in 2005'sGuess Who, Kutcher is simply too lightweight a presence on the big screen. Even though he achieves moments of subtlety, the overall effect he achieves is blandness. Looking a tad mature for her partner, Peet fares marginally better simply because her character arc seems more developed. Together they make a charming couple but hardly memorable nor emotionally resonant. The DVD comes with an equally colorless commentary track from Cole and producers Armyan Bernstein and Kevin Messick, along with a brief blooper reel, four deleted scenes of minimal interest, and a music video, ""Brighter Than Sunshine"", performed by Aqualung, one of many trendy artists featured on the soundtrack.",2,"Flaccid, Time-Spanning Rom-Com Plays Strictly by the Numbers",1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,2135,"['certain', 'manufactured', 'charm', '2005', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'given', 'predilection', 'be', 'hybrid', 'betweenWhen', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'andBefore', 'Sunrise/Before', 'Sunsetwith', 'faint', 'echoes', 'number', 'classic', 'time-spanning', 'romances', 'likeSame', 'Time', 'Next', 'YearandTwo', 'Road', 'Unfortunately', 'comparisons', 'do', 'not', 'benefit', 'film', 'given', 'colorless', 'way', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Colin', 'Patrick', 'Lynch', 'spelled', 'out', 'formulaic', 'elements', 'story', 'additional', 'burden', 'attractive', 'leads', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'neither', 'whom', 'seem', 'fully', 'formed', 'screen', 'personas', 'gravitas', 'keep', 'interested', 'hapless', 'characters', 'portray.Directed', 'Nigel', 'Cole', 'relatively', 'adroit', 'manner', 'episodic', 'story', 'centers', 'Oliver', 'Emily', 'case', 'study', 'opposites', 'who', 'begin', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'bathroom', 'fling', 'transcontinental', 'flight', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'day-long', 'romantic', 'whirl', 'touch', 'ground', 'soon', 'part', 'expectation', 'seeing', 'other', 'again', 'episode', 'ongoing', 'structure', 'plot', 'continue', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'course', 'seven', 'years', 'experiencing', 'inevitable', 'sparks', 'allowing', 'professional', 'romantic', 'complications', 'act', 'perpetual', 'barrier', 'lasting', 'commitment.Contrived', 'plot', 'as', 'presented', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'least', 'redeemed', 'charms', 'stars', 'stumbling', 'block', 'showed', ""2005'sGuess"", 'Who', 'Kutcher', 'simply', 'too', 'lightweight', 'presence', 'big', 'screen', 'Even', 'moments', 'subtlety', 'overall', 'effect', 'blandness', 'Looking', 'tad', 'mature', 'partner', 'Peet', 'marginally', 'better', 'simply', 'character', 'arc', 'more', 'developed', 'Together', 'make', 'charming', 'couple', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'DVD', 'equally', 'colorless', 'commentary', 'track', 'Cole', 'producers', 'Armyan', 'Bernstein', 'Kevin', 'Messick', 'brief', 'blooper', 'reel', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'minimal', 'interest', 'music', 'video', 'Brighter', 'Than', 'Sunshine', 'performed', 'Aqualung', 'one', 'many', 'trendy', 'artists', 'featured', 'soundtrack']",A Lot Like Love

The best thing about the film is that it doesnt take itself over seriously and isnt scheming to be something it is not. Ashton Kutcher's character is realistic and boring at times.

I loved how she tries to think she's evolving all the time especially each time they show her a few years hence.

If you WANT the girl, ACT LIKE A MAN and you'll GET the girl.""But no. His character is an utter weeny, and I am dumbfounded as to how he managed to start a somewhat successful dot.com business. The film also lost a golden opportunity for an obvious-but-funny line, regarding this business venture. (He sell's diapers on-line.) When Peet's character admonishes him not to tell her friends what kind of business he's in, he just goes and TELLS them, ""I sell diapers."" And that's the end of it. It was like watching a balloon slowly deflate.If *I* sold diapers, I'd be champing at the bit waiting for people to ask me what I did so I could tell them ""I'm in diapers.""

The only film of his that I liked was his performance in 'The Butterfly Effect'. So when this film was first announced I never gave it a second thought until I saw the trailer. The trailer looked good and even though Kutcher was in it, it also starred the beautiful and talented Amanda Peet who I have loved since her role on the short lived WB series 'Jack & Jill'. I finally saw this film on DVD and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. Not only did Amanda Peet give an excellent performance but Ashton Hutcher also did a good job as well. Even though it was a comedy there are other aspects to the film including romance and hints of drama.

It's actually kind of sad to see two actors try so hard to have chemistry when in reality there is very little between them. The plot line was slow, yet at the same time somewhat sporadic that I never really get a good feel on each character, in other words, although the characters undergo a lot of change over the six year period it was hard to really understand why. Anyway, there were some cute moments, but in all honesty if your looking for Ashton and Amanda to capture your attention in a whirl wind of a romance like Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do in ""The Notebook"" then think again. In a way, it was like they tried too hard or something. Sometimes a movie is so wonderful because it's seamless, and flows so effortlessly, this movie tries too hard, and in return I ended up having to try really hard to actually care about these character and whether or not they end up together...this is a rental at best.

In fact I think we thought we were watching LOVE ACTUALLY until about halfway through the film when we realized we hadn't seen anyone playing British.  Amanda Peet is so charming on STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP that I figured this was worth a look.  She starts out the movie as a mess, sort of like Nancy in SID AND NANCY with dark red hair, garish raccoon makeup, and a blowsy attitude that culminates when she walks in on Ashton in the bathroom and has sex with him without a single word spoken.  She is just appalling!However this tough girl act is just a front, it turns out, and she really misses her mom, who died young and who she visits in a NY cemetery.  The tragedy of the mom's death is the reason for all of Emily's problems which, we find out over the course of years, are manifold.  She has as many problems as there are fish in the ocean.  She can't get the blandly attractive, commitment-phobic writer Peter out of her heart, and she breaks down every time she sees him with another girl.  Well, no wonder, Peter is played by Gabriel Mann, the sort of actor you've seen a million times and he never became a star.  As he ages he is developing an unfortunate resemblance to Nancy Kulp who played Miss Hathaway on TV's BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.  In fact if they ever do one of those BEHIND THE SCENES TV movies about THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES they should get Gabriel Mann's agent on the phone.What is it with having sex on plane bathrooms anyhow?  I've never been in one large enough to have sex with myself in it.The movie culminates when Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) stumbles into a photo gallery in Los Feliz and recognizes himself as the nude man embracing the nude woman in one of Emily's long ago photos taken in the Mojave or somewhere.  What they needed for this computer generated photo of Ashton's butt was a stunt double whose butt looked anything like Ashton's but instead they got (I assume) Gabriel Mann to stand in.

913584,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009UZGIM,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 4]","Love requires a couple of tangibles to occur - time and place where two individuals can connect.  These tangibles are common denominators in cinema history, as characters encounter one another.  In regards to love, this opportunity often takes place at the first meeting where love happens at first sight.  However, a prediction of when the occasion is to take place is not possible, as the future simply will remain unknown until it happens.  A Lot Like Love grabs the notion of love through the first meeting in a straightforward manner, as Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) and Emily (Amanda Peet) meet each other for the first time and meet again a couple of times over the next seven years.A Lot Like Love opens with two young adults setting their eyes on one another for the first time.  Here it is Oliver and Emily whose eyes connect for the first time at the Los Angeles airport, but shy Oliver does not step up to the plate when the opportunity arises.  However, Emily grabs the opportunity to get to know Oliver through a more controversial method during the flight, which leads them into a seven year on and off relationship.During these seven years they bump into each other by choice, as they choose the opportunity to see the other.  Yet, they separate before things get serious, and each time they reason with themselves to come to the conclusion that they cannot remain together.  However, it is obvious from the first shot of the film that they will end up together.The director Nigel Cole whom many recognize from the terrific British films Saving Grace (2000) and Calendar Girls (2003) creates a film that this time does not reach the heights of his previous film.  The shortcomings seems to rest with the unoriginal script, which delivers a story that heavily resembles with Richard Linklater's brilliant Before Sunrise (1994) and Before Sunset (2004).  In Linklater's films, a man meets a woman on a train while they end up spending a day together in Vienna, Austria, and then ten years later reunite in Paris.  Linklater's films are much more personal and thoughtful compared to the shallow storyline in A Lot Like Love.  Yet, Cole creates a story that is both amusing and warm, but the performances by the leads are uneven and do not reach the necessary peaks in order to deliver a great film.  In the end, A Lot Like Love will entertain, but not leave the audience with a significant cinematic tale.",3,"A Love Story, Which Could Have Been Much Better...",1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,2413,"['Love', 'couple', 'tangibles', 'occur', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'two', 'individuals', 'can', 'connect', 'tangibles', 'are', 'common', 'denominators', 'cinema', 'history', 'characters', 'encounter', 'one', 'regards', 'love', 'opportunity', 'often', 'place', 'first', 'meeting', 'where', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'However', 'prediction', 'when', 'occasion', 'take', 'place', 'not', 'possible', 'future', 'simply', 'will', 'remain', 'unknown', 'Lot', 'Love', 'grabs', 'notion', 'love', 'first', 'meeting', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'Oliver', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Emily', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'meet', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'again', 'couple', 'times', 'next', 'seven', 'years.A', 'Lot', 'Love', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'setting', 'eyes', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'Here', 'Oliver', 'Emily', 'eyes', 'connect', 'first', 'time', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'airport', 'shy', 'Oliver', 'not', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'when', 'opportunity', 'However', 'Emily', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'Oliver', 'more', 'controversial', 'method', 'flight', 'seven', 'year', 'relationship.During', 'seven', 'years', 'bump', 'other', 'choice', 'choose', 'opportunity', 'see', 'other', 'separate', 'things', 'get', 'serious', 'time', 'reason', 'come', 'conclusion', 'can', 'not', 'remain', 'together', 'However', 'obvious', 'first', 'shot', 'film', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together.The', 'director', 'Nigel', 'Cole', 'whom', 'many', 'recognize', 'terrific', 'British', 'films', 'Saving', 'Grace', '2000', 'Calendar', 'Girls', '2003', 'film', 'time', 'not', 'reach', 'heights', 'previous', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'rest', 'unoriginal', 'script', 'story', 'heavily', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'brilliant', 'Sunrise', '1994', 'Sunset', '2004', 'Linklater', 'films', 'man', 'woman', 'train', 'end', 'up', 'spending', 'day', 'together', 'Vienna', 'Austria', 'then', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'reunite', 'Paris', 'Linklater', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'thoughtful', 'compared', 'shallow', 'storyline', 'Lot', 'Love', 'Cole', 'story', 'amusing', 'warm', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'uneven', 'do', 'not', 'reach', 'necessary', 'peaks', 'order', 'deliver', 'great', 'film', 'end', 'Lot', 'Love', 'will', 'entertain', 'not', 'leave', 'audience', 'significant', 'cinematic', 'tale']",A Lot Like Love

It's more than that - it's deeper somehow.  I'm not going to lie - it has its moments, but it's an honest and frank look at relationships and destiny.  Timing is everything - and I really believe that.The story follows Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) and Emily (Amanda Peet) - and begins 7 years in the past.  The unlikely pair meet on an airplane - Oliver a straight-laced college graduate and Emily, a chain-smoking, grunge-rock free spirit.  They join the mile high club and then spend the day together in New York, where Oliver reveals his grand plans to Emily over double shots of Jack Daniels and a pitcher of beer.  In 5 years time, maybe 6, he will have his ducks in a row (or in a LINE), be a successful businesman, wealthy, and have a beautiful wife.  He gives Emily his parents' phone number, tells her to call him in 6 years time so he can prove himself to her, and he can give her his address where she can mail him the $50 he won.Fast forward a few years later, Emily is dumped by her boyfriend, and finds herself alone on New Year's Eve.  While digging through her little black book trying to round up a date, she stumbles upon Oliver's phone number, calls him up, and thus begins a series of choice encounters the two will share over the next several years.  Everytime they reconnect, they are in different stages of their lives - both looking for something, but the timing is never right, yet a deep bond is formed that keeps them seeking out each other.The movie is warm, funny, and oddly touching.  One of my all time favorites.  And the soundtrack is great to boot!  The first time I saw this movie, I caught the last 45 minutes or so on HBO and just knew I had to watch it..... so I bought it on Amazon.

913592,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0009UZGIM,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 1]","Simply because it was a film based on people meeting over a long period of time, and then losing touch again with each other. Much like When Harry Met Sally. Now while When Harry Met Sally is a classic, this has no hope of ever being a classic. BUT it's really good. So good that I was crying by the end, and I never cry at rom-coms. But this was that good.I have to say this isn't a film for guys, as they're simply not soppy enough to watch it. :( They know they should, but they won't. Hey Amanda Peet gets butt nekkid (although she's shockingly skinny, give the girl a burger), you'd think the guys would be flocking to see it. But I guess the girls will just have to go out and buy this, and watch to their heart's content. I've already watched it twice.Ashton Kutcher is becoming the next Ben Affleck in some people's opinions, as he consistently chooses bad films to star in. OK, I like both actors without a doubt, but you can see why some people would hate this film, and others that he has done. And Amanda just has no on-screen prescene about her. She doesn't shine, she should be someone like Judy Greer, who can't shine in a lead role, but instead has to be a supporting actress.But for some reason, with these two actors, it works. They work. Despite the god-awful bad haircuts at the beginning, and the moments when the film does drag (note, I said moments!), the film is fabulous. There's many moments in it, which will just make you melt inside, including the fantastic kiss on New Year's Eve (who wouldn't?), the naked photo on top of the car (wow) and the tear jerking moment at the end, where it's discovered that Ashton's character, Oliver, really DID make the first move on Emily. Awwwwwwwwww!The scene where Emily and Oliver are standing naked behind the car and Oliver says to her that she just ""looked"" (at his genital area) hadn't primarily been shot for the movie. It was actually a real moment between Amanda and Ashton, which the director decided to use for the film afterwards.I loved the whole fact that on the end credits, they were actually put alongside many, MANY pictures of Ashton & Amanda in one of those photo booths. Bearing in mind, those only spit out four pictures at a time, and I dunno about in the US, but they're bloody expensive over here! Some of the pics are your standard lets-stick-our-tongues-out-at-the-camera, but some are really cool, and there was chemistry between Ashton & Amanda. I normally think there's lack of chemistry between characters in films, but sometimes, you just get that spark, and you get it here.It doesn't let you get as close to the characters as you would like, why Emily is so against men in general, why she gives each men three strikes, and why Oliver wants to go into the diaper business.This film will work if you've ever had a male or female 'friend' who you were really in love with. The feelings are there, but the timing isn't right, or the other just isn't 'in' that place.This would be a terrific date movie, perfect for a snuggly day indoors, when the rain's pouring outside, and it's cold. You might have to handcuff your boyfriend to get him to sit down & watch it, and you might have to put up with his sarcastic comments throughout, but hopefully, it should make you go all gooey inside. And you might have to promise, to watch some hard man, action, guns blazing film. (Just to be stereotypical.) Or you might watch something completely unexpected, and really like it. You could use that on your boyfriend girls. He just might like it. Or you could promise him something else. ;)",5,Was portrayed as being the next When Harry Met Sally,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,3575,"['Simply', 'was', 'film', 'based', 'people', 'meeting', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'then', 'losing', 'touch', 'again', 'other', 'Much', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Now', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'classic', 'hope', 'ever', 'being', 'classic', 'really', 'good', 'So', 'good', 'was', 'crying', 'end', 'never', 'cry', 'rom-coms', 'was', 'good.I', 'have', 'say', ""n't"", 'film', 'guys', ""'re"", 'simply', 'not', 'soppy', 'enough', 'watch', 'know', 'should', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Hey', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'butt', 'nekkid', 'shockingly', 'skinny', 'give', 'girl', 'burger', ""'d"", 'think', 'guys', 'would', 'be', 'flocking', 'see', 'guess', 'girls', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'watch', 'heart', 'content', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'Kutcher', 'becoming', 'next', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'people', 'opinions', 'consistently', 'bad', 'films', 'star', 'OK', 'like', 'actors', 'doubt', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'hate', 'film', 'others', 'done', 'Amanda', 'just', 'on-screen', 'prescene', ""n't"", 'shine', 'should', 'be', 'someone', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shine', 'lead', 'role', 'instead', 'be', 'supporting', 'actress.But', 'reason', 'two', 'actors', 'work', 'god-awful', 'bad', 'haircuts', 'beginning', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'drag', 'note', 'said', 'moments', 'film', 'fabulous', 'many', 'moments', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'melt', 'inside', 'including', 'fantastic', 'kiss', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'naked', 'photo', 'top', 'car', 'wow', 'tear', 'jerking', 'moment', 'end', 'where', 'discovered', 'Ashton', 'character', 'Oliver', 'really', 'DID', 'make', 'first', 'move', 'Emily', 'Awwwwwwwwww', 'scene', 'where', 'Emily', 'Oliver', 'are', 'standing', 'naked', 'car', 'Oliver', 'just', 'looked', 'genital', 'area', 'had', ""n't"", 'primarily', 'been', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'moment', 'Amanda', 'Ashton', 'director', 'decided', 'use', 'film', 'afterwards.I', 'loved', 'whole', 'fact', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'actually', 'put', 'alongside', 'many', 'MANY', 'pictures', 'Ashton', 'Amanda', 'one', 'photo', 'booths', 'Bearing', 'mind', 'only', 'out', 'four', 'pictures', 'time', 'dunno', 'US', ""'re"", 'bloody', 'expensive', 'here', 'pics', 'are', 'standard', 'lets-stick-our-tongues-out-at-the-camera', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'there', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Ashton', 'Amanda', 'normally', 'think', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'films', 'sometimes', 'just', 'get', 'spark', 'get', 'here.It', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'close', 'characters', 'would', 'like', 'why', 'Emily', 'so', 'men', 'general', 'why', 'men', 'three', 'strikes', 'why', 'Oliver', 'go', 'diaper', 'business.This', 'film', 'will', 'work', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'male', 'female', ""'friend"", 'who', 'were', 'really', 'love', 'feelings', 'are', 'there', 'timing', ""n't"", 'right', 'other', 'just', ""n't"", ""'in"", 'place.This', 'would', 'be', 'terrific', 'date', 'movie', 'perfect', 'snuggly', 'day', 'indoors', 'when', 'rain', 'pouring', 'cold', 'might', 'have', 'handcuff', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'might', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'hopefully', 'should', 'make', 'go', 'gooey', 'inside', 'might', 'have', 'promise', 'watch', 'hard', 'man', 'action', 'blazing', 'film', 'Just', 'be', 'stereotypical', 'might', 'watch', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'really', 'could', 'use', 'boyfriend', 'girls', 'just', 'might', 'like', 'could', 'promise', 'something', 'else']",A Lot Like Love

He's an almost entrepreneur while she's nearly a successful photographer.  They meet and nearly hit it off several times over the course of 6 years, remaining unhappy with their actual chosen mates and chosen fates until the last few minutes of the movie when more than cuteness brings them together and we all realize that true love has won out at last.Peet is adorable, while Kutcher looks as refreshingly un-Hollywood as ever.  What sinks this movie is that it's not really so much a story as a bunch of nearly linked scenes, none of them all that deep or funny.  Our heroes meet but manage not to fall in love, and that's basically it.  We've seen this story for years, and nobody's made a real go of it since ""Harry met Sally"", which was wise enough to grace our leads with witty and intelligent sidekicks.  The dynamics of Peet & Kutcher's non-Romance seem shoehorned or artificially twisted to fit a screenplay which needs to keep the two apart until the final shot.  The two go through years of contact and non-contact but never seem to learn anything from their encounters. (Strangely for a story that stretches over 6 years, the characters and the world they live in seem remarkably unchanged, especially given how they straddle the internet age.)  The most telling scene in this flick has our leads singing along (badly at that) to a Chicago song while driving across the desert.  While it's my personal opinion that it's a horrible song, it doesn't look like the characters liked the song either or were the sing-along type or even following any motivation at all - they were just acting according to movie-cute rules.  They don't look like they like the song, so their singing it seems as arbitrary as the rest of the story.",2,Leads seem unwelcome in their own movie,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,1832,"['Ashton', 'Emma', 'nearly', 'prevail', 'fairly', 'light-weight', 'not-quite-funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'almost', 'entrepreneur', 'nearly', 'successful', 'photographer', 'meet', 'nearly', 'hit', 'off', 'several', 'times', 'course', '6', 'years', 'remaining', 'unhappy', 'actual', 'chosen', 'mates', 'chosen', 'fates', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'more', 'cuteness', 'together', 'realize', 'true', 'love', 'won', 'out', 'last.Peet', 'adorable', 'Kutcher', 'refreshingly', 'un-Hollywood', 'ever', 'What', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'bunch', 'nearly', 'linked', 'scenes', 'none', 'deep', 'funny', 'heroes', 'meet', 'manage', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'basically', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'years', 'nobody', 'made', 'real', 'go', 'Harry', 'met', 'Sally', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'grace', 'leads', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'sidekicks', 'dynamics', 'Peet', 'Kutcher', 'non-Romance', 'seem', 'shoehorned', 'artificially', 'twisted', 'fit', 'screenplay', 'keep', 'two', 'apart', 'final', 'shot', 'two', 'go', 'years', 'contact', 'non-contact', 'never', 'seem', 'learn', 'anything', 'encounters', 'Strangely', 'story', '6', 'years', 'characters', 'world', 'live', 'seem', 'remarkably', 'unchanged', 'especially', 'given', 'how', 'straddle', 'internet', 'age', 'most', 'telling', 'scene', 'flick', 'leads', 'singing', 'along', 'badly', 'Chicago', 'song', 'driving', 'desert', 'personal', 'opinion', 'horrible', 'song', ""n't"", 'look', 'characters', 'liked', 'song', 'were', 'sing-along', 'type', 'even', 'following', 'motivation', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'according', 'movie-cute', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'like', 'song', 'singing', 'as', 'arbitrary', 'rest', 'story']",A Lot Like Love

The preview, to me, depicted the movie as being very funny and sweet. And it was--it's easily one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. Ashton plays a more subdued/thoughtful character than he usually does, and Peet plays a wild girl, and its cool to see how their characters change their hair, their clothes, and their feelings over the years. Peet is really good as Emily, the tough girl who has always had a man in her life is trying to figure out her place in the world. Her character is both vulnerable and stubborn. Ashton fans will also enjoy seeing him here - he's really kind of charming. The chemistry between Ashton and Peet is great, a cute couple.

Kutcher is excellent as well, but I did not appreaciate his acting until the second viewing. And he does not match the level delivered by Peet. This is a very nuanced screenplay, so much so that it's hard to take it all in during the first viewing. Most viewers will get a lot out of a second viewing.The one weakness is the early airplane scene. It has Peet throwing herself at Kutcher in an airline restroom (can you imagine the smell?) and before they have even met. It's so ridiculously unbelievable, and so insulting to viewers' intelligence that I nearly turned the movie off the first time I saw it on pay-per-view. The good news is that it's worth suffering through one ridiculous scene to get on with a fine film.Another, but minor weakness is that the screenwriter could have done a lot more with the final scene.

It's probably because his characters make fun of ""awe"" scenes before we can open our mouths to coo about them (ex. his awful serenade singing voice and her running into glass). With two strangers who get in the Mile High Club and keep meeting each other in a seven-year span, these character had to have crazy chemistry to make this work. And they did. Neither of them is on the same page at the same time in their lives, but they're clearly attracted to each other and relive their previous romantic encounters all over again. Funny thing is that Ashton's character Oliver is more of a hopeless romantic than his love interest because this lady (Emily) is definitely hard around the edges. I think that's what helps this movie not be corny.There were moments in the story that I wondered how could they possibly keep walking away from each other, especially when they kept finding it each other at the most random spots. In real life, I can't see a couple successfully staying out of each others' lives that long, especially when there were no big arguments, fights or really any reason why they absolutely HAD to be apart.

""Dude Where's My Car?"", which in my opinion was not the best of films.  It's hard to believe, but a romantic comedy such as this was actually quite enjoyable.  It starts off kind of slow, but it becomes absorbing as the movie continues on.  Warning to all the guys out there though, this is pretty much a chick flick.  I'm a guy, but I happen to enjoy the soft subtle love story every now and then.The movie begins seven years ago when a man named Oliver (Kutcher) sees a girl named Emily (Amanda Peet) break up with her boyfriend just before a flight to New York.  They're both on a flight to New York.  When Oliver has to go into the bathroom to clean up, he's followed by Emily.  This is the first of several encounters they'll have over the years.As the two explore New York, they have a chance to get to know one another.  A few things in the beginning start off a little too slow, Oliver tries to go after Emily and she contantly shuns him away.  Three strikes within the first twenty minutes of the film, and Oliver already strikes out.Oliver also starts off as the sort of guy no girl in their right mind would want.  He still lives with his parents, he has no car, and he's unemployed.  The only thing he has is his charm.  The two finally decide on a bet that in six years he won't live with his parents and he'll be successful.  They drink to it, and Oliver gives up his parents phone number, claiming that when she calls, she won't find him.  Throughout the film, those six years will pass.The film first jumps about three years into the future in which Emily's boyfriend has just walked out on her on New Years.  There's a party and she has no one to go with now.  Flipping through her phonebook, she comes across Oliver's number and decides to give him a call.  This is just the first of several times over the years they'll meet up.  Most of the time, however, it's by chance.Surprisingly, the movie didn't disappoint me.  There were some cliches, such as when Oliver gives Emily a serenade in front of all her neighbors, and when Oliver and Emily finally decide they love each other, but then realize that ""someone"" is getting in the way.I was also surprised that Ashton Kutcher did a fine acting job.  I'm not a Kutcher fan, and I'm used to seeing him in stupid comedies.  However, this film was sweet, and he did a good job.Probably what I didn't like about this movie is that it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, but there aren't a whole lot of funny parts.  It has its moments, but they're too few and far between.  There's also the fact that the movie is just feels long.  Some of the more tender moments are great, but the softer parts seem to be ""fillers"" to get the movie going more.It was surprisingly good.  If you want a decent love story, this is a good film.  Not for comedy fans, and not for your stereotypical man.

The movie in general, with its direct appeal to the twenty-something year old audience, is easy to follow and fun at the same time.A Lot Like Love features an excellent soundtrack: Aqualung's Brighter Than Sunshine, Jet's Look What You've Done, Anna Nalick's Breathe, Eagle Eye Cherry's Save Tonight, and Chicago's classic hit If You Leave Me Now, as well as Bon Jovi's I'll Be There For You, performed by Kutcher himself in the film.

That pretty much sums up the movie there, but I'll extrapolate.Let's face it. Ashton Kutcher really isn't an actor. He's kind of like Tom Cruise, just a guy playing himself over and over and over again in movie after movie. These movies have different plots and are in different genres, but Kutcher's the same as he was three movies before. Granted he might have a bit more intensity in one movie or he might give off an aurora of charm in another or maybe he seems a tiny bit fragile in another, but it's still just Kutcher being Kutcher, with no real acting involved. Don't get me wrong, I like some of Kutcher's stuff--he did a decent job in THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and he gave candid camera an edge in PUNK'D. But, until he takes some acting lessons and starts to study people who can actually act, Kutcher is always going to be Kutcher.As for Amanda Peet, well, she's hot. However, like Kutcher, Peet really can't act and if the 10,000 articles written about her most of the characters she has played have just been herself under a different name. Usually she's cast as the beautiful babe with psychotic problems or the woman with an attitude (aka = word that rhymes with witch). Peet isn't a witch in A LOT LIKE LOVE, but her character sure could have some sort of psychological problems going on.The plot of the movie begins on an airplane. Kutcher plays a guy named Oliver (can you believe it?) and on a plane ride from LA to New York, he meets Emily (Amanda Peet). When Oliver goes to the bathroom to tinkle, Emily sneaks in and gets him to join the mile-high club. After they get to New York they spend a day hanging out together, but after departing don't meet until years later. A couple years later they meet again, have sex, hang out, and separate. The process continues at approximately 1  to 2 year intervals until Amanda, I mean Emily, realizes she love Ashton, I mean Oliver and rushes off to meet him at what she assumes is his wedding.I guess the filmmakers were trying to make another WHEN HARRY MET SALLY for the ""younger generation"". I really don't like saying that because A LOT LIKE LOVE doesn't even come close to achieving the resonance and connection of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY. At least in WHMS there was some sort of consequences for the actions people made. A LOT LIKE LOVE is in-line with the philosophy of the fantasy world created on the television show FRIENDS where people could pretty much do anything without any consequences in the world.I could go on and on, but I think the point has been made.I had heard decent things about the film and watched the movie with as an open mind as I could. I was sadly disappointed and I think most other people will be, too. A LOT LIKE LOVE is basically a movie that a tiny segment of people, mainly female, between the ages of 11-22 will enjoy. Anyone older than that will be able to see through it for the drivel that it is.",2,Full of Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,3043,"['LOT', 'LIKE', 'LOVE', 'clich', 'eacute', 'supposedly', 'romantic', 'drama', 'couple', 'almost-thirty-somethings', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'movie', 'there', ""'ll"", 'extrapolate.Let', 'face', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'really', ""n't"", 'actor', 'kind', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'just', 'guy', 'playing', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'movie', 'movies', 'have', 'different', 'plots', 'are', 'different', 'genres', 'Kutcher', 'same', 'was', 'three', 'movies', 'Granted', 'might', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'intensity', 'one', 'movie', 'might', 'give', 'off', 'aurora', 'charm', 'maybe', 'tiny', 'bit', 'fragile', 'still', 'just', 'Kutcher', 'being', 'Kutcher', 'real', 'acting', 'involved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'Kutcher', 'stuff', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'gave', 'candid', 'camera', 'edge', 'PUNK', 'acting', 'lessons', 'study', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'Kutcher', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'Kutcher.As', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'well', 'hot', 'However', 'Kutcher', 'Peet', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', '10,000', 'articles', 'written', 'most', 'characters', 'played', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'different', 'name', 'Usually', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'babe', 'psychotic', 'problems', 'woman', 'attitude', 'aka', '=', 'word', 'witch', 'Peet', ""n't"", 'witch', 'LOT', 'LIKE', 'LOVE', 'character', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'sort', 'psychological', 'problems', 'going', 'on.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'airplane', 'Kutcher', 'guy', 'named', 'Oliver', 'can', 'believe', 'plane', 'ride', 'LA', 'New', 'York', 'Emily', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'When', 'Oliver', 'bathroom', 'tinkle', 'Emily', 'join', 'mile-high', 'club', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'spend', 'day', 'hanging', 'out', 'together', 'departing', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'years', 'later', 'A', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'meet', 'again', 'have', 'sex', 'hang', 'out', 'separate', 'process', 'approximately', '1', '2', 'year', 'intervals', 'Amanda', 'mean', 'Emily', 'love', 'Ashton', 'mean', 'Oliver', 'rushes', 'meet', 'what', 'wedding.I', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'WHEN', 'HARRY', 'MET', 'SALLY', 'younger', 'generation', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'saying', 'LOT', 'LIKE', 'LOVE', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'achieving', 'resonance', 'connection', 'WHEN', 'HARRY', 'MET', 'SALLY', 'least', 'WHMS', 'was', 'sort', 'consequences', 'actions', 'people', 'made', 'LOT', 'LIKE', 'LOVE', 'in-line', 'philosophy', 'fantasy', 'world', 'created', 'television', 'show', 'FRIENDS', 'where', 'people', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'anything', 'consequences', 'world.I', 'could', 'go', 'think', 'point', 'been', 'made.I', 'had', 'heard', 'decent', 'things', 'film', 'watched', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'could', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'think', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'LOT', 'LIKE', 'LOVE', 'basically', 'movie', 'tiny', 'segment', 'people', 'mainly', 'female', 'ages', '11-22', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Anyone', 'older', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'drivel']",A Lot Like Love

Amanda peet was perfectly cast along side him.  An entertaining story of love that took 6 years to perfect, and along the way they discovered things that were ""a lot like love"", but will true love find them in the end. Will Oliver (Kutcher) get his 6 year plan complete, and will Emily (Peet) be paying him $50 for the bet they make when they first meet in New York.  It move along at just the right pace, and not overdone or to long either, keeps you hooked.
