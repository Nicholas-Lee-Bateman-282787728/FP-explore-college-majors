398736,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304056869,Acute Observer,"[2, 6]","It is a rainy day at the cemetery where Maria D'Amata is being interred. There is a statue marking her grave. Harry reminisces about her beginnings as a dancer in Spain. A rich heir was visiting Spain to look for a new face. Kirk Edwards is proud and arrogant. We learn a little about show business. [There is some unconscious humor here.] Harry must persuade Maria to do a screen test for Kirk. Maria tells Harry about herself and her life. Maria's screen test was successful, and she went to Hollywood. Maria's successful film was followed by a scandal in her family. She testified at the murder trial.There is more humor in the talk from a rich South American playboy. Oscar explains public relations. Maria is unhappy in her life, in spite of three hit movies. There is a discussion on personal philosophy. Then an argument between the two rich men. Unexpected results follow. The film shows the International set at Cannes. Does money buy happiness? [If you know where to shop.] Maria meets a count, her future husband. [The film seems to be padded to extend the story.] Cinderella meets her Prince at an opportune time. The Torlata-Fabrini family goes back centuries, to the era of Cesare Borgia. Will the line die out? [More talk pads out this film.] They are married in church. But Maria gets a surprise on her honeymoon [Can a woman who dances in a gypsy camp be so naive?]. ""Will life louse up the script?"" This subject is handled with subtlety. There are always unforeseen reactions when dealing with human nature and its emotions. Will Maria's happiness depart as quickly as it arrived? [Will you be happy when this film finally ends?]What does this film say about Hollywood and its fantasies? Did they have to go abroad to tell about the business of filmed entertainment? This is a love story about a poor girl who gets involved with a rich man. Don't expect them to live happily ever after.Ava Gardner does not dance in this film.",2,Hollywood Show Business,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1944,"['rainy', 'day', 'cemetery', 'where', 'Maria', ""D'Amata"", 'being', 'interred', 'statue', 'marking', 'grave', 'Harry', 'beginnings', 'dancer', 'Spain', 'A', 'rich', 'heir', 'was', 'visiting', 'Spain', 'look', 'new', 'face', 'Kirk', 'Edwards', 'proud', 'arrogant', 'learn', 'little', 'show', 'business', '[', 'unconscious', 'humor', 'here', ']', 'Harry', 'must', 'persuade', 'Maria', 'do', 'screen', 'test', 'Kirk', 'Maria', 'Harry', 'herself', 'life', 'Maria', 'screen', 'test', 'was', 'successful', 'went', 'Hollywood', 'Maria', 'successful', 'film', 'was', 'followed', 'scandal', 'family', 'testified', 'murder', 'more', 'humor', 'talk', 'rich', 'South', 'American', 'playboy', 'Oscar', 'public', 'relations', 'Maria', 'unhappy', 'life', 'spite', 'three', 'hit', 'movies', 'discussion', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'Then', 'argument', 'two', 'rich', 'men', 'Unexpected', 'results', 'follow', 'film', 'International', 'set', 'Cannes', 'Does', 'money', 'buy', 'happiness', '[', 'know', 'where', 'shop', ']', 'Maria', 'count', 'future', 'husband', '[', 'film', 'be', 'padded', 'extend', 'story', ']', 'Cinderella', 'Prince', 'opportune', 'time', 'Torlata-Fabrini', 'family', 'back', 'centuries', 'era', 'Cesare', 'Borgia', 'Will', 'line', 'out', '[', 'More', 'talk', 'out', 'film', 'are', 'married', 'church', 'Maria', 'surprise', 'honeymoon', '[', 'Can', 'woman', 'who', 'gypsy', 'camp', 'be', 'so', 'naive', ']', 'Will', 'life', 'louse', 'script', 'subject', 'handled', 'subtlety', 'are', 'always', 'unforeseen', 'reactions', 'when', 'dealing', 'human', 'nature', 'emotions', 'Will', 'Maria', 'happiness', 'depart', 'as', 'quickly', 'arrived', '[', 'Will', 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'film', 'finally', ']', 'What', 'film', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'fantasies', 'Did', 'have', 'go', 'abroad', 'tell', 'business', 'filmed', 'entertainment', 'love', 'story', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'involved', 'rich', 'man', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Ava', 'Gardner', 'not', 'dance', 'film']",Barefoot Contessa VHS

398738,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304056869,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 8/12Rate: 88/12: As soap operatic as The Barefoot Contessa was, it did not turn out to be that bad. However,  Ava Gardner was too old for the role, and it should've went to Elizabeth Taylor who was 12 years her junior. So, that casting choice would have been sensible. There was a slogan on the poster which made a bold statement, ""The World's Most Beautiful Animal!"" Eh, if you look closely on Ava's face, you can discover how old she appeared based on her skin. The heavy makeup covered up all of that. From a distance, yes...she looked very good. Meanwhile, there were times during The Barefoot Contessa that some characters spoke for too long, most especially Oscar played by Edmond O'Brien. Then afterwards, he inexplicably won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I thought he was the worst character who wouldn't shut the hell up. What he should've gotten was a gallon bucket for him to drain his handkerchief into. He actually beat out Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, and Karl Malden from On the Waterfront for the award. Crazy. What should have happened was that Humphrey Bogart be placed in that category, not the Best Actor, for his work in The Caine Mutiny and end up winning it. His performance was not of the leading man; that was Robert Francis as Ensign Keith. Speaking of Bogart, if it wasn't for him, The Barefoot Contessa would have fallen apart because he was the glue. The fatherly relationship that he had going with Maria Vargas was the chief reason for sustaining my interest. If not for that, The Barefoot Contessa was nothing more than a simple soap opera melodrama in the vein of Citizen Kane. Furthermore, there were poor character developments. For one, how can a poor Spanish peasant speak English so well? And then, how one-dimensional was Kirk Edwards? Probably the oddest part of The Barefoot Contessa was the revelation of the count's blown off private parts. I thought the Hays Code was in effect. At any rate, a daring moment right there. All in all, I shall see The Barefoot Contessa again later and see if my opinion can be improved, but I may see more faults in it. By the way, look at the boy in the beginning inside of the Spanish bar. Guess who is that? He's the famous Enzo Staiola from Ladri di biciclette.",4,A Mixed Bag.,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,2252,"['Viewed', '8/12Rate', '88/12', 'soap', 'operatic', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'However', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'should', ""'ve"", 'went', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'was', '12', 'years', 'junior', 'So', 'casting', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sensible', 'was', 'slogan', 'poster', 'made', 'bold', 'statement', 'World', 'Most', 'Beautiful', 'Animal', 'Eh', 'look', 'closely', 'Ava', 'face', 'can', 'discover', 'how', 'old', 'appeared', 'based', 'skin', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'covered', 'up', 'distance', 'yes', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'Meanwhile', 'were', 'times', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'characters', 'spoke', 'too', 'long', 'most', 'especially', 'Oscar', 'played', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'Then', 'afterwards', 'inexplicably', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'thought', 'was', 'worst', 'character', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'shut', 'hell', 'up', 'What', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'was', 'gallon', 'bucket', 'drain', 'handkerchief', 'actually', 'beat', 'out', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Waterfront', 'award', 'Crazy', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'was', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'be', 'placed', 'category', 'not', 'Best', 'Actor', 'work', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'end', 'up', 'winning', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'Robert', 'Francis', 'Ensign', 'Keith', 'Speaking', 'Bogart', 'was', ""n't"", 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'was', 'glue', 'fatherly', 'relationship', 'had', 'going', 'Maria', 'Vargas', 'was', 'chief', 'reason', 'sustaining', 'interest', 'not', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'simple', 'soap', 'opera', 'melodrama', 'vein', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Furthermore', 'were', 'poor', 'character', 'developments', 'one', 'how', 'can', 'poor', 'Spanish', 'peasant', 'speak', 'English', 'so', 'well', 'then', 'how', 'one-dimensional', 'was', 'Kirk', 'Edwards', 'Probably', 'oddest', 'part', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'was', 'revelation', 'count', 'blown', 'off', 'private', 'parts', 'thought', 'Hays', 'Code', 'was', 'effect', 'rate', 'daring', 'moment', 'right', 'there', 'shall', 'see', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'again', 'later', 'see', 'opinion', 'can', 'be', 'improved', 'may', 'see', 'more', 'faults', 'way', 'look', 'boy', 'beginning', 'Spanish', 'bar', 'Guess', 'who', 'famous', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'Ladri', 'di', 'biciclette']",Barefoot Contessa VHS

But it's much more complicated than that.Bogart is a screenwriter (again) and director. Gardner is the Spanish dancer he discovers and turns into a star. Rosanno Brazzi is the count she eventually marries. Sounds like such a simple plot, yes? It's not. Nothing is quite what is expected in this film, and it's all the better for it. And I'm not going to give anything away about the plot. Of course wealthy men vie for her attention; she's not only beautiful but famous. But she's distant, does not love anyone. Why? Bogart may understand to some extent, but he's not the sort to tell secrets. You may get some clues early on in the film when her father murders her mother. It was a dysfunctional family, to say the least.No, I'm really not going to give anything away. The story is too carefully plotted, the hints of the shock at the end too subtle (but there are hints).

Ava Gardner looks gorgeous.I read all the glowing reviews of this movie here before buying it, but I was dissappointed in it. I was bored by the predictable arc of the story, the cartoonish stereotypical characters (the evil abusive millionaire, the sweaty faced agent), and the long drawn out conversations which could have been edited down 80% without losing much. The entire story is improbable and not in any way adequately developed - a bar dancer suddenly becoming a huge star, yet we never see her dance in the bar, and never see her act in her ""movie"".Garnder is not convincing in her role at all, especially with the fake spanish accent. She is beautiful but she lacks the pizaz and confidence of a Monroe, Taylor, or Bardot. I am no fan of Bogart but he comes across as decent uncle-like figure - which Ava ascertains by talking to him for 60 seconds after he barges into her room as a stranger. But he is so terribly miscast as a filmmaker, that I could never really even accept it. The big scene with the agent on the phone is such an obvious acting job of the actor yelling to the audience its painful to watch. There is nothing genuine in any way about this movie's story or the characters playing it.To me the only value in it, is in a specimen of early 50's Hollywood. If you like old movies then fine. But this is not up to snuff by modern standards at all. I find myself wondering why there are shadows on every wall in an interior room and hair always lit (due to the multiple stage lights used for filming). Its also amusing to see the subtle sexism (e.g. the ease in which men put their hands on Gardner and talk to her like a child). The only curiosity is the strangely anti-mother twist to it.

Her kind director Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart - THE BIG SLEEP, KEY LARGO) sees big things in her future, but Maria remains aloof and mysterious, both on the screen and off.Maria's story is told in flashback from various viewpoints; a very effective tool in the telling of this rather predictable tale.

However, her startling beauty and intense sensuality are not enough to overcome the deficiencies of this overripe 1954 melodrama. All the signs looked promising since the credentials behind this production are impressive. Writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz just had a one-two punch winning back-to-back double Oscars for writing and directingA Letter to Three Wivesand his indisputable high watermark,All About Eve, and Humphrey Bogart was at a career peak withThe African QueenandThe Caine Mutiny. Moreover, Mankiewicz chose the lethal combination of the movie industry and the international jet set as his vitriolic target this time. Nonetheless, much like Rob Marshall's recent adaptation of Nine, the movie simply lacks propulsion in the narrative flow and the characters any real depth to give the viewer a valid reason to engage in the fanciful story apparently based on Rita Hayworth's checkered life.With a rather affected accent, Gardner plays Maria Vargas, a beautiful Spanish dancer discovered in a Madrid nightclub by a megalomaniacal Howard-Hughes-like tycoon, Kirk Edwards. She despises him almost immediately, but she does connect with one of his cohorts, a has-been writer/director named Harry Dawes, who convinces her to do a screen test. No romance develops between Maria and Harry but rather an abiding friendship that leads to international stardom after only three movies. Meanwhile, love escapes her but not tabloid scandal as her father stands trial for killing her mother. A convenient affair with Alberto Bravano, a South American bon vivant, follows, but their mutual manipulation seals the fate of the relationship. Maria finally meets the man of her dreams, Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini, and all's right with her world until a humiliating secret threatens to shatter everything.The framing device of the funeral makes the resolution of the storyline all too clear, and the recurring use of flashbacks and voiceovers will be familiar to anyone who has seen Mankiewicz's two earlier classic films. Gardner is luscious to look at, especially in one shipboard scene where she throws a towel aside as everyone gawks at her beauty, but she even seems lost by some of the script machinations. Bogart plays Harry with the right jaundiced tone, but there is only so much he can do as an observer of the action and simply hands the picture to Gardner. Warren Stevens, Marius Goring (The Red Shoes), and Rosanno Brazzi (Summertime) play their accustomed types adequately, but the one true scene-stealer is Edmond O'Brien as mouthy agent Oscar Muldoon constantly wiping the sweat off his brow (naturally he is the one who won an Oscar). Master craftsmen Jack Cardiff (Black Narcissus) is responsible for the luxuriant camerawork here. There are no extras on the 2001 DVD other than the original theatrical trailer.",3,"Gardner Smolders, But Mankiewicz Misses with a Portrait of a Rita Hayworth-Like Star",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,2923,"['Ava', 'Gardner', 'God', 'almost', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'look', 'mousy', 'schoolgirl', 'However', 'startling', 'beauty', 'intense', 'sensuality', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'deficiencies', 'overripe', '1954', 'melodrama', 'signs', 'looked', 'promising', 'credentials', 'production', 'are', 'impressive', 'Writer/director', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'just', 'had', 'one-two', 'punch', 'winning', 'back-to-back', 'double', 'Oscars', 'writing', 'directingA', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wivesand', 'indisputable', 'high', 'watermark', 'Eve', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'was', 'career', 'peak', 'withThe', 'African', 'QueenandThe', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'Moreover', 'Mankiewicz', 'chose', 'lethal', 'combination', 'movie', 'industry', 'international', 'jet', 'set', 'vitriolic', 'target', 'time', 'Nonetheless', 'much', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Nine', 'movie', 'simply', 'propulsion', 'narrative', 'flow', 'characters', 'real', 'depth', 'give', 'viewer', 'valid', 'reason', 'engage', 'fanciful', 'story', 'apparently', 'based', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'checkered', 'rather', 'affected', 'accent', 'Gardner', 'Maria', 'Vargas', 'beautiful', 'Spanish', 'dancer', 'discovered', 'Madrid', 'nightclub', 'megalomaniacal', 'Howard-Hughes-like', 'tycoon', 'Kirk', 'Edwards', 'almost', 'immediately', 'connect', 'one', 'cohorts', 'has-been', 'writer/director', 'named', 'Harry', 'Dawes', 'who', 'do', 'screen', 'test', 'romance', 'Maria', 'Harry', 'rather', 'abiding', 'friendship', 'international', 'stardom', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'Meanwhile', 'love', 'not', 'tabloid', 'scandal', 'father', 'trial', 'killing', 'mother', 'convenient', 'affair', 'Alberto', 'Bravano', 'South', 'American', 'bon', 'vivant', 'mutual', 'manipulation', 'seals', 'fate', 'relationship', 'Maria', 'finally', 'man', 'dreams', 'Count', 'Vincenzo', 'Torlato-Favrini', 'right', 'world', 'humiliating', 'secret', 'shatter', 'everything.The', 'framing', 'device', 'funeral', 'resolution', 'storyline', 'too', 'clear', 'recurring', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'voiceovers', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Mankiewicz', 'two', 'earlier', 'classic', 'films', 'Gardner', 'luscious', 'look', 'especially', 'one', 'shipboard', 'scene', 'where', 'towel', 'aside', 'everyone', 'gawks', 'beauty', 'even', 'lost', 'script', 'machinations', 'Bogart', 'Harry', 'right', 'jaundiced', 'tone', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'observer', 'action', 'simply', 'picture', 'Gardner', 'Warren', 'Stevens', 'Marius', 'Goring', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'Rosanno', 'Brazzi', 'Summertime', 'play', 'accustomed', 'types', 'adequately', 'one', 'true', 'scene-stealer', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'mouthy', 'agent', 'Oscar', 'Muldoon', 'constantly', 'wiping', 'sweat', 'brow', 'naturally', 'one', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Master', 'craftsmen', 'Jack', 'Cardiff', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'responsible', 'luxuriant', 'camerawork', 'here', 'are', 'extras', '2001', 'DVD', 'other', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Barefoot Contessa VHS
398752,A2K07WT3GJA8BY,6304056869,E.G. Hardsworth,"[7, 10]","In the film, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa,&quot; Humphrey Bogart indeed is a cynic from the very start. He niether likes his role of being a paid screenwriter on the payroll of a very moody boss and his talkative associate (Edmond O'Brien), nor does he enjoy exploiting himself. Ava Gardner as Maria is a very grounded dancer in Madrid, who cannot make up her mind between wanting stardom or wanting the simple life in her hometown. She is torn from the very start and feels she never quite belongs to the Hollywood scene. Nevertheless, all the men, except Bogart and O'Brien, are after her beauty and want a piece of her fragile being, only to end up a fatal end to her short life.The story is rather complex and if you don't pay attention to each word, you may get lost with what exactly is happening. Each word the player says is meant completely, and the film is dependent on each charactors wordplay. The actor Edmond O'Brien, for instance, uses this method effectively and grabs every scene from the film that he's in. He was fantastic in it and probably was the most humble of the characters. He really deserved his Best Supporting Actor Academy award for 1954.Ava Gardner, sorry to say it, was merely a ploy throughout the film to pretty much show the masterful direction of Mankanviez (sp?). She was marvelous, though, and completely made the film the success as it stands today. People watch it because of her screen presence, not to examine Bogart's duantless growl or O'Brien's snappy chit-chat; it's Gardner's presence and appeal that really brought the film into status.Overall, if you get the DVD, the clarity is remarkable and you can really notice how well Gardner spoke, see every grimace of Bogart's usual snarl and hunched back, and see some wonderful panoramic views that only Technicolor could produce.

On the other hand this psychological reaction molded and was molded too by a sociological state of anger, fury and hopeless around the social body. Far beyond the fact to have wined the war, the surrounding atmosphere was of total rebelliousness in the youth (birth of Rock & Roll), evasion (Science fiction) or sharp facing respect social realism  (Noir film expansion, to other latitudes, as Kiss me deadly that deals with the possible nuclear consequences or the vanished line between law and justice As pick up on South street), but there was still another third way that was initiated among others filmmakers (Elia Kazan, Billy Wilder, Edward Dmytrik, Samuel F&uuml;ller, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray, Otto Preminger and Mankiewicz) who focused around the inner demons (Baby Doll), vices (The man with the golden arm), adultery in the military statement (Anatomy of a murder), syndicalism (On the waterfront) where the anti hero reached a status legend.In this sense, The barefoot Contessa, should be watched under this somber perspective.

Viewing it again, years later, it has some endearingly melodramatic moments, but holds up very well, and is still probably one of my top 5 favorites.This is the period of movies like THE RED SHOES that have really beautiful sceen pictures, beautiful costumes, rich color.  A perfect forum for Ava Gardner who continues to hold the title in most people's minds of ""the most beautiful woman ever.""  Cyd Charisse runs her a good race.  Given that this is the story of a mesmerizing dancer, one has to wonder if she was being considered for this role.  Cyd Charisse said with her dance what Ava Gardner does with her acting.Previous reviewers have failed to mention that this is not just a Cinderella story, almost a ""Camille"" story, too, but it closely - VERY closely - parallells what has become common knowledge about Ava Gardner's personal life.  The dynamic of her beauty and charisma being parlayed into fame, coming from ""the dirt"" (she was supposedly ""discovered"" while picking cotton in the South), and her inability to suppress her sexual appetites, destroying marriages and marring her career. It is perhaps BECAUSE of this that this role is tailor made for Gardner, and she really does a beautiful job.  She is better in the tempestuous moments than the thoughtful ones.  She seems a little bored by her own past, but such is the lot of a beauty... she spends a lot of time recounting things to men who really don't care what she has to say.Some feel the story is trite, but the technique of using flashbacks from 3 different perspectives remains interesting, and a rarely used device.  The issue that dates the movie is the inability to speak very openly about sex when that becomes a driving motivator within the script.  The fact that the Count does not touch her before their wedding (and is so droolingly handsome), when every other man wants to paw her, is an incredible aphrodisiac.  It seems to be men who don't like this movie, and I'd venture to say this is something women ""get"" that makes the movie ring true, that these guys aren't understanding, and don't want to.  It is all there, but it is all subtle and between the lines, and some of it really needs to be spelled out a bit more.  But that is her problem with the Count, ultimately, not talking first - and that is a real problem people still face.Rosanno Brazzi remains for me the most handsome man ever on film.  The only thing I really don't understand about this movie is why she lets him walk away, when she should have said ""Hold it right there, buster...there's more than one way to peel a banana.""  ; )  Bogart is actually likable and fatherly in this film, a change of pace for him, in addition to his being part of a really stable marriage with a pretty, smart woman, makes his character very interesting, and I can see exactly why he would chose it.Given the time period and the rags to riches story, what is surprising about this movie is that is remains so accurate and so deep, about conflicting motivations in the dynamic between men and women, and how Hollywood exploits the surface for men to sell pictures of women to men.",5,The Interior Life of a Timeless Beauty,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,3221,"['have', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'movie', 'stayed', 'mind', 'more', '20', 'years', 'Viewing', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'endearingly', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'still', 'probably', 'one', 'top', '5', 'favorites.This', 'period', 'movies', 'THE', 'RED', 'SHOES', 'have', 'really', 'beautiful', 'sceen', 'pictures', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'rich', 'color', 'perfect', 'forum', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'who', 'hold', 'title', 'most', 'people', 'minds', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'ever', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'good', 'race', 'Given', 'story', 'mesmerizing', 'dancer', 'one', 'wonder', 'was', 'being', 'considered', 'role', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'said', 'dance', 'what', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'acting.Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'failed', 'mention', 'not', 'just', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'almost', 'Camille', 'story', 'too', 'closely', 'VERY', 'closely', 'parallells', 'what', 'become', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'personal', 'life', 'dynamic', 'beauty', 'charisma', 'being', 'parlayed', 'fame', 'coming', 'dirt', 'was', 'supposedly', 'discovered', 'picking', 'cotton', 'South', 'inability', 'suppress', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'destroying', 'marriages', 'marring', 'career', 'perhaps', 'BECAUSE', 'role', 'tailor', 'made', 'Gardner', 'really', 'beautiful', 'job', 'better', 'tempestuous', 'moments', 'thoughtful', 'ones', 'little', 'bored', 'own', 'past', 'such', 'lot', 'beauty', 'lot', 'time', 'recounting', 'things', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'say.Some', 'feel', 'story', 'trite', 'technique', 'using', 'flashbacks', '3', 'different', 'perspectives', 'interesting', 'rarely', 'used', 'device', 'issue', 'movie', 'inability', 'speak', 'very', 'openly', 'sex', 'when', 'driving', 'motivator', 'script', 'fact', 'Count', 'not', 'touch', 'wedding', 'so', 'droolingly', 'handsome', 'when', 'other', 'man', 'paw', 'incredible', 'aphrodisiac', 'be', 'men', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'something', 'women', 'get', 'movie', 'ring', 'true', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'understanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'subtle', 'lines', 'really', 'be', 'spelled', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'problem', 'Count', 'ultimately', 'not', 'talking', 'first', 'real', 'problem', 'people', 'still', 'face.Rosanno', 'Brazzi', 'most', 'handsome', 'man', 'ever', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie', 'why', 'walk', 'away', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'Hold', 'right', 'there', 'buster', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'peel', 'banana', 'Bogart', 'actually', 'likable', 'fatherly', 'film', 'change', 'pace', 'addition', 'being', 'part', 'really', 'stable', 'marriage', 'pretty', 'smart', 'woman', 'character', 'very', 'interesting', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'why', 'would', 'chose', 'it.Given', 'time', 'period', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'what', 'surprising', 'movie', 'so', 'accurate', 'so', 'deep', 'conflicting', 'motivations', 'dynamic', 'men', 'women', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'surface', 'men', 'sell', 'pictures', 'women', 'men']",Barefoot Contessa VHS

Williams,"[3, 6]","In vivid Technicolor, Academy Award winning THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA stars ravishing Ava Gardner as Maria Vargas -- a rising movie star with a heart in more humble surroundings and romantic dreams based on storybook fantasies that end in tragedy. Beginning with Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart), the men in her short life have flashbacks about how each met and affected her. Between stories, the camera pans back to the active cemetery funeral service before zooming in on a new character.Harry, a movie writer/director who has his own love interest, nurtures with Maria more of a protective sibling relationship than carnal attraction. She may see the wisdom in his advice at times but is motivated by her own heart and fairy tales. With the stage presence of Catherine Zeta-Jones, 30-year-old Gardner actually had the most difficult role to convey as Maria. Though she preferred to walk barefoot, she no longer was comfortable hiding in the squaller and she was not happy with the life as an instant Hollywood sensation. Maria was too much woman for the lowly gypsies with which she grew up and not enough for the misogynistic aristocrats bemused by her chastity and surreal beauty.There is some romance but with Harry having his own girl, the narration and vignettes come across more as a suspenseful -- often comedic documentary than a romantic love story. Adding to this are Maria's unrealistic ideas about love that were only transcended by the man she eventually married. In the end you have a complete picture of who Maria was, by whom was she known as THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA, and why her life ended so abruptly. With four intertwined stories to tell, the movie may appear a bit long at 130 minutes. Yet, Gardner lights up each scene. There are also some ""well-known bright remarks,"" coming from the vicinity of Bogart.Favorite quotes: (1) ""Script girl, name is Jerry.""""She has the name of a man?""""I assure you there is no further resemblance."" (2) ""I do not like Mr. Kirk Edwards.""""You're standing at the end of a very long line.""",4,Which prince will have the glass slipper?

In one of the very first scenes, Ava Gardner is dancing in a nightclub in Spain.  We know she's great even though the camera isn't on her for one minute.  All we do is hear the music and watch the faces of the people watching her.  By the time we do see her, she's already in her dressing room.  She's absolutely gorgeous and lights up every scene she's in.  We see her character's rise to movie stardom and share the unfulfilled life she leads.  And then, just when we think she's finally found happiness, tragedy strikes.  It's a modern day classic drama with a story that pulled me right in.Humphrey Bogart plays a movie director who befriends this &quot;barefoot Contessa&quot;, nicknamed that because she was once so poor that she didn't have shoes.  She prefers going barefoot and this theme is emphasized all the time, showing her barefoot whenever possible.  Rossano Brazzi, who doesn't appear till late in the film, is cast as the true romance in her life.  All of these actors do a good job, but I was particularly impressed with the performance of Edmund O'Brien, cast as a public relations man for a studio executive.  It's a small part but I just kept thinking how good he was.  Later I discovered that he won an Academy Award for this role.It's the screenplay that moves the action.  It never lagged and I sat there with my eyes glued to the screen wondering what would happen next.  Considering that this is basically just a love story, that's saying a lot.  I totally enjoyed the viewing experience.  It's too bad though, that there were no features included on the DVD.

Reading over the box, it's quite a cast: jaded Humphrey Bogart, sultry Ava Gardner, and one of my favorite romantic stars, Rosanno Brazzi. Plot sounds promising--movie man Bogart molds free soul spaniard Ava into a big movie star desired by many men, but needing to live life on her own terms.  Not to omit either that it was written and directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, of &quot;All About Eve&quot; and &quot;Letter to Three Wives&quot; fame. Sure fire enjoyment, right? NOT.1. Terrible dialogue! How come Americans playing &quot;foreign&quot; people in movies are always supposed to speak without using contractions? Ava sounds terribly stilted here, and many preposterous lines are uttered by the other cast members.2. Bad casting! Bogart's a big name, and I guess that why they wanted him, but I'll be darned if I know why he accepted this role. He is not the romantic lead and his character is shown to be spineless early on when he acts like a toady for his tyrannical boss. If you've ever seen Gable in &quot;The Hucksters&quot;, then you know how that star's character reponds much more admirably to his boss Sidney Greenstreet's attempts to cow him.

Here we have two very big stars (Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardener) and a film crew getting to spend several weeks along the Riviera making ""The Barefoot Contessa."" They probably should just have taken a vacation in Europe, though the decision to make this flimsy excuse of a movie probably made tax sense.Joseph L. Mankiewicz wrote and directed this story of Maria Vargas, a ""Spanish dancer"" from a sordid background whose beauty and supposed talent attract Hollywood scouts to the seedy Madrid nightclub where she performs. After about half an hour of talk and maneuvering, she's convinced to come to Hollywood where she gains stardom as ""Maria D'Amato."" There's more talk and I fell asleep for about 15 minutes. She goes back to Europe where, along the Riviera, she mingles with the ""international society"" set, which includes a number of deposed but still monied aristocrats. After never allowing herself to love anyone, she falls in love with an Italian count--or maybe he's French or from Monaco. From somewhere along the Riviera anyway, and he owns some impressive real estate with sweeping views. They marry in the Catholic church, and on their wedding night, he tells her her can't function as a husband due to injuries sustained in the war. To give the count an heir, which Maria thinks will make him happy, she fools around with a gardener. When the count finds out, he kills Maria. The story is told as a series of flashbacks, interspersed with scenes her rain-soaked funeral.To the extent the movie has a story arc, it's about Maria's ""fairy tale"" life, from the gutter to fame and fortune to royalty, and then her unhappy ending. The real concern seems to be to give Mankiewicz an opportunity to vent his obsessions about the phoniness of the movies, the film industry, and society as a whole, and boy does he vent. The characters, mostly the supporting characters, talk on and on and on about matters that have little bearing on the story. Their chatter does nothing to advance the story or develop the characters. The script strains for wit it almost invariably fails to find. Although the Riviera settings are gorgeous, the camerawork does little to bring them, or the characters, to life. If the ten commandments of good storytelling all rolled into one are ""show don't tell,"" this movie will spend eternity in hell. It's all telling and no showing.This was my first Ava Gardner movie and I suspect it will be my last. She's a feast for the eyes and wears lovely and seductive costumes as Maria. Unfortunately, she has about as much charisma as a cardboard box.Humphrey Bogart is competent and gives a relaxed but not particularly memorable performance as the film director who shapes Maria's career.Not recommended except for people who have to see everything Bogart ever did.",2,"Long, Talky and Dull",1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,3128,"['REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERS', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'plot-driven', 'movie', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'only', 'slightly', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'interminable', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'came', 'end', 'European', 'economic', 'recovery', 'fueled', 'Marshall', 'Plan', 'took', 'effect', 'Americans', 'were', 'beginning', 'enjoy', 'travel', 'Europe', 'Here', 'have', 'two', 'very', 'big', 'stars', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Ava', 'Gardener', 'film', 'crew', 'getting', 'spend', 'several', 'weeks', 'Riviera', 'making', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'probably', 'should', 'just', 'have', 'taken', 'vacation', 'Europe', 'decision', 'make', 'flimsy', 'excuse', 'movie', 'probably', 'made', 'tax', 'sense.Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'wrote', 'directed', 'story', 'Maria', 'Vargas', 'Spanish', 'dancer', 'sordid', 'background', 'beauty', 'supposed', 'talent', 'attract', 'Hollywood', 'scouts', 'seedy', 'Madrid', 'nightclub', 'where', 'hour', 'talk', 'maneuvering', 'convinced', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'gains', 'stardom', 'Maria', ""D'Amato"", 'more', 'talk', 'fell', 'asleep', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'back', 'Europe', 'where', 'Riviera', 'international', 'society', 'set', 'number', 'deposed', 'still', 'monied', 'aristocrats', 'never', 'allowing', 'love', 'anyone', 'love', 'Italian', 'count', 'maybe', 'French', 'Monaco', 'somewhere', 'Riviera', 'anyway', 'impressive', 'real', 'estate', 'sweeping', 'views', 'marry', 'Catholic', 'church', 'wedding', 'night', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'husband', 'due', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'war', 'give', 'count', 'heir', 'Maria', 'thinks', 'will', 'make', 'happy', 'around', 'gardener', 'When', 'count', 'out', 'Maria', 'story', 'told', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'rain-soaked', 'funeral.To', 'extent', 'movie', 'story', 'arc', 'Maria', 'fairy', 'tale', 'life', 'gutter', 'fame', 'fortune', 'royalty', 'then', 'unhappy', 'ending', 'real', 'concern', 'be', 'give', 'Mankiewicz', 'opportunity', 'vent', 'obsessions', 'phoniness', 'movies', 'film', 'industry', 'society', 'whole', 'boy', 'vent', 'characters', 'mostly', 'supporting', 'characters', 'talk', 'matters', 'have', 'little', 'bearing', 'story', 'chatter', 'nothing', 'advance', 'story', 'develop', 'characters', 'script', 'wit', 'almost', 'invariably', 'find', 'Riviera', 'settings', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'camerawork', 'little', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'ten', 'commandments', 'good', 'storytelling', 'rolled', 'one', 'are', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'movie', 'will', 'spend', 'eternity', 'hell', 'telling', 'showing.This', 'was', 'first', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'movie', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'feast', 'eyes', 'wears', 'lovely', 'seductive', 'costumes', 'Maria', 'Unfortunately', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'charisma', 'cardboard', 'box.Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'competent', 'relaxed', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'Maria', 'career.Not', 'recommended', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'see', 'everything', 'Bogart', 'ever', 'did']",Barefoot Contessa VHS

I'm not sure if it was actually very, very long or if it just seemed that way.On the plus side, there are the stars:  Ava Gardner is spectacular looking in a 1950's movie-star way and she gets to wear a lot of glamorous clothes, including some snazzy one-piece swim suits.  Humphrey Bogart plays his usual wiser-than-anyone-else-in-the-film self and he does it well.  When he, as a writer-director, meets her, as a Spanish cabaret dancer, in her dressing room, there is an immediate sense that these two are in the same league, whereas the others are second-rate background characters. If this connection had been developed into a romance the movie might have had some sizzle.But the Bogie character has a sensible, boring girl back home and Ava goes on from one rich cad to another until she finally her Prince Charming.  Since the opening scene shows her funeral, we know that she's not going to fare well and it's only a matter of seeing how she comes to her demise.  Perhaps if someone else had played the Italian Count/Prince Charming, her decision might have been more understandable.  Apparently Rossano Brazzi, who plays him, was a hot item at the time but I never understood his appeal. He's not handsome, is rather stocky, has no facial expressions and delivers his lines in a terribly wooden way.  Maybe the heavy Italian accent is what some find charming.My ending to the story would be to have Bogie grab Ava halfway through the film and say ""Cut the crap; you belong with me!""  Bogie's script-girl girlfriend could have one of the vapid rich guys and everyone would live happilly ever after.There are the usual colorful shots of the French Riviera that were so appealing in 50's films but they are not worth the price of this picture.

Her fashions, the filmy gowns and gold laced pant-suit outfits, the glossy red lipstick and black hair were something to look at all right.  It could have been overly gaudy, but Humphrey Bogart had a lot of clout at the end of his career, so though this is a failed film, they tried.Barefoot also push's the life style of the rich and famous envelope for the folks back in Peoria.

How refreshing. While watching I found myself just intrigued with Ava Gardner and think she is perhaps one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the earth. The dialogue is simply deliciously revealing as the characters speak from their hearts.""There's more to talking than just words...""Ava plays the Barefoot Contessa, Maria Vargas who is discovered in Madrid. I expected there to be much more dancing in this movie, being it was about a dancer. However, there is just really one scene of her dancing out in the open with her gypsy friends where she sees the man she falls madly in love with. He is a nobleman and can provide everything for her. She sees him as the man who has seen more in her than any man ever has before.The scenes where Ava and Bogart converse are the most meaningful. Bogart has a way of bringing out Maria's natural curiosity. When anyone tells her ""no"" she says ""yes."" She is determined to be owned by no one and yet, everyone seems to want to own her. She fears being exposed and unprotected. Emotionally, she is still a child in many ways and believes in fairy tales. The harsh realities of loving someone and not receiving it in return seem foreign to her.The first scene is in a graveyard and from here, the scenes flash back to the past in a continuous fashion throughout with narration.  Each part of the story is revealed at just the right moment.The rest of the movie seems to deal more with her career and love interests. The theme of Cinderella and ""shoes"" plays out well and is very significant in many ways. I thought that even though it wasn't really mentioned, when Maria says she didn't forget her shoes in one scene and Bogart picks them up for her, this symbolizes her complete trust in him. Watch for the significance of the shoes in one of the last scenes as well.The prince in this story loves Cinderella, there is just something he can never give her. While Maria says she needs someone to love her and make her feel safe, she wants the entire ""Prince"" package. What she finds is someone who doesn't love her enough at first, to tell her he can't make her completely happy.Che Sara, Sara~The Rebecca Review",5,"What will be, will be...",1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,2330,"['Yes', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'movie', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'days', 'story', 'bit', 'longer', 'gain', 'momentum.The', 'characters', 'actually', 'have', 'depth', 'can', 'act', 'How', 'refreshing', 'watching', 'found', 'just', 'intrigued', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'think', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'ever', 'grace', 'earth', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'deliciously', 'revealing', 'characters', 'speak', 'hearts', 'more', 'talking', 'just', 'words', 'Ava', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'Maria', 'Vargas', 'who', 'discovered', 'Madrid', 'expected', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'dancing', 'movie', 'being', 'was', 'dancer', 'However', 'just', 'really', 'one', 'scene', 'dancing', 'out', 'open', 'gypsy', 'friends', 'where', 'man', 'madly', 'love', 'nobleman', 'can', 'provide', 'everything', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'man', 'ever', 'before.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ava', 'Bogart', 'converse', 'are', 'most', 'meaningful', 'Bogart', 'way', 'bringing', 'out', 'Maria', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'When', 'anyone', 'yes', 'determined', 'be', 'owned', 'one', 'yet', 'everyone', 'want', 'own', 'being', 'exposed', 'unprotected', 'Emotionally', 'still', 'child', 'many', 'ways', 'fairy', 'tales', 'harsh', 'realities', 'loving', 'someone', 'not', 'receiving', 'return', 'seem', 'foreign', 'her.The', 'first', 'scene', 'graveyard', 'here', 'scenes', 'flash', 'back', 'past', 'continuous', 'fashion', 'narration', 'part', 'story', 'revealed', 'just', 'right', 'moment.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'deal', 'more', 'career', 'love', 'interests', 'theme', 'Cinderella', 'shoes', 'out', 'well', 'very', 'significant', 'many', 'ways', 'thought', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'mentioned', 'when', 'Maria', 'did', ""n't"", 'forget', 'shoes', 'one', 'scene', 'Bogart', 'up', 'complete', 'trust', 'Watch', 'significance', 'shoes', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'well.The', 'prince', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'just', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'give', 'Maria', 'someone', 'love', 'make', 'feel', 'safe', 'entire', 'Prince', 'package', 'What', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'enough', 'first', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'completely', 'happy.Che', 'Sara', 'Sara~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Barefoot Contessa VHS

398789,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6304056869,Simon Davis,"[55, 61]","Throughout her famous acting career actress Ava Gardner had many heavy crosses to bear. Hounded by the press probably more than any other actress of her generation, she was forced to live in an emotional goldfish bowl as she married a succession of famous men and pursued an acting career that included many highs and lows. Labelled with daunting titles such as ""The most beautiful woman in the world"", and ""The world's most beautiful animal"", it's not a surprise to read that she suffered from an inferiority complex all her life and really never regarded herself as a good actress. Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""The Barefoot Contessa"", contains one of those fine performances that proves beyond a doubt that Ms. Gardner was indeed a very fine actress capable of great depth when a character and story actually challenged her. Cast as the simple, self questioning Maria Vargas who rises to the lofty heights of Hollywood stardom only to encounter the down side of the business and the people who run it, Ava Gardner has never been better and coming on top of her Academy Award nominated performance in ""Mogambo"", the previous year proves that the earlier performance was no fluke. Interestingly teamed with veteran actor Humphrey Bogart, Gardner and he have an unusual chemistry onscreen based not so much on a passionate love between their characters but from a deep understanding of each others characters and foibles that really drives this story along to it's tragic conclusion.As the story opens we witness the funeral of a woman who was once a great Hollywood star and through the narration of one man present; Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart), we are told in flashback the woman's sad story. Firstly winding back the years we see a rag tag team of Hollywood personnel scouting for locations in Europe for an upcoming production to be shot in Italy. While there they journey to Madrid to check out the much reputed charms and talents of a local dancer by the name of Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner) as a possible choice for the lead in the new story. The visiting group consists of washed up, reformed alcholic director Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart), who has been given the responsiblity of directing the new film, producer Kirk Edwards (Warren Stevens) the cold and emotionless robot who makes and breaks people in Hollywood over night, and public relations yes man Oscar Muldoon (Edmond O'Brien). Totally captivated by Maria's beauty and magnetism the group persuade her to accept the lead role in the movie which Maria sees as not only a perfect escape from the unhappy life she lives in Madrid, but as a way for her to achieve her dreams of a better life full of love and meaning. Maria goes from strength to strength in Hollywood and has great success in three films all directed by Harry however along the way she begins to see that Hollywood stardom, despite all the perks it brings her such as beautiful clothes, jewellery, and a fine house, also comes at a high price which includes her very soul which she is not prepared to give. Now the potential victim of men like Kirk Edwards and Oscar Muldoon, Maria can only express who she is and what she really wants from life to the always sympathetic Harry who is the only individual who sees Maria as far more than just a beautiful money making movie star, but instead as a sensitive, intelligent woman seeking honesty and appreciation of her inner qualities. Dissatisfied with her empty movie career existence Maria flees back to Europe and picks up with a sucession of men including gambler Albert Bravano (Marius Goring), who treats her as simply a beautiful possession, and finally with Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossan Brazzi) a rich Italian who is the last of his titled line but who carries a dark secret of his own. Filming in Europe Harry falls back into contact with Maria who points out to Harry the continued lack of meaning in her life. During Harry's stay in Europe Vincenzo offers to marry Maria  who now thinks that all her dreams of love and fulfillment have come true. However her wedding night comes as a rude awakening when Vincenzo reveals that he cannot father children upon which Maria seeks solace elsewhere resulting in a pregnancy. Telling her husband of her condition owever is not the solution that Maria believes it to be and the course of events that happen simply lead to further tragedy for all parties concerned.""The Barefoot Contessa"", marked a particular high point in the career of Ava Gardner where for once she was able to work with a character that had many layers to it in the self questioning Maria Vargas. The way a character is written most often decides whether that character will come across to an audience as a real person or as a piece of fiction and in the capable hands of writer/director Joseph Mankiewicz the character of Maria is an unusual one for that period. Ava Gardner despite the often difficult working relationship she experienced with Mankiewicz off camera here fully understands what motivates Maria and she delivers a finely etched performance that doesn't rely on the usual Hollywood tricks to gain sympathy. Anyone who only thinks of Ava Gardner as a beautiful mannequin walking through her acting assignments needs to view her perfomance here to see just what she was capable of when given a good story and challenging character to play. Humphrey Bogart is also in fine form here and despite his not so chummy relationship with Gardner off screen, the two combined well here in the depiction of their character's platonic but highly supportive friendship through many vicissitudes over many years.  Nearing the end of his amazingly successful career in 1954 Bogart attempted in his later years many different types of roles outside of his tough guy persona with often very pleasing results as is seen here. His character is honourable and really the only genuine support Maria's character experiences in her life.  Sadly to die of cancer within two years Bogart here has left a pleasing tribute to his range of expertise in acting which is often forgotten in the light of his more famous earlier performances. Edmund O'Brien of course scored the coveted Best Supporting Actor oscar for his role as the slimy, constantly sweating, publicist always out for a great headline or story and his performance really illustrates the cynical, deglamourised feel of much of ""The Barefoot Contessa"", to perfection. Indeed Bogart's character seems to be the only voice of reason or decency in a sea of corrupt, selfish individuals all living out their dreams in the tinseled Hollywood of old. The film itself benefits greatly from extensive on location shooting in Europe where much of the story takes place with the photography courtesy of Jack Cardiff done though many of the Italian coastal areas a real stand out. It succeeds in really capturing to perfection the lush backgrounds essential for this story about the rich and powerful but not so happy ""beautiful people"".""The Barefoot Contessa"", has become with time one of those staples of the late night movie channels, reduced to being seen only by bleary eyed insomniacs. It however deserves a much more responsive audience than that. Long a curiosity item because of Humphrey Bogart's distinct change of pace here in one of his last film roles, or to see the matchless beauty that was Ava Gardner in her prime, the film deserves to be better remembered than for just those features. Instead it is an interesting examination of how Hollywood can quickly consume people with its promise of the fulfillment of all their dreams only to often have those dreams become a nightmare with ultimately tragic results for all parties involved. Movie making of the old Hollywood kind ""The Barefoot Contessa"" most certainly is however it is one of the shining lights in the often maligned career of the legendary beauty Ava Gardner. For that reason alone it makes highly recommended viewing.",5,Memorable Examination Of Hollywood And It's Down Side With A Luscious Ava Gardner,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,7944,"['famous', 'acting',

The story starts in Madrid where Bogie plays a film writer who is at a nightclub with two movie executives looking for new talent.  They heard about this beautiful and talented singer/dancer and want to get a look for themselves.  The singer, played by Gardner, stuns all three and they want to sign her to a long term contract.  She could become the next big Hollywood star.  Gardner's character comes from modest means, but after a few fits and starts, she becomes one of the most celebrated and admired stars in Hollywood.  All of this stardom has not brought her happiness.  She eventually falls in love with an Italian count whom she marries, but this marriage is eventually her downfall and she dies tragically.  Bogie was her one true friend and soulmate who really understands her, even if they are never romantically involved.  This film is her life's tale seen largely through Bogie's eyes.Eva Gardner is the real star of this film.  She was given (or chose to play in) very few good films during her career, but this is one of her best.  Gardner was, in my opinion, a great actress who is rarely given credit for her acting ability because she played in a large number of second rate stories.  In this film she plays the role of the beautiful but unhappy celebrity to a tee.  Perhaps she wasn't acting in this role?  Beyond Gardner though, there is a lot to like about this film.  Bogie plays the controlled, worldly, screen writer who won't be swayed by the lies and hypocrisy of the Hollywood execs and the uber-rich.

From there she goes on to a brief and meteoric career as an international film star before meeting an untimely death at the peak of her beauty and screen renown.  Mankiewicz pulls out all stops to display her beauty at every angle, showcasing that beautifully chiseled face accented by the elegant cheekbones.Bogart plays the role of a world-wise oracle, delivering pungent Mankiewicz one-liners, along with snappy first person narration.  He serves as a surrogate father for the restless Gardner, who detests the superficilialities of the film world.  A free spirit, she loathes stardom's confinements of living in a glass house, seen by all.  Bogart serves as a convenient buffer from Stevens, who Gardner, as well as everyone else, detests with a passion.Eventually Gardner meets the handsome prince of her exotic dreams in Italian nobleman Rossano Brazzi, but the tragedy is that he is compelled to love her &quot;with all my heart&quot; and is unable to provide her with the kind of physical fulfillment she desires due to a war injury that has left him impotent.  When she endeavors to fulfill his desire for an heir by having an affair with another man, he fails to see things her way and believes she has betrayed him when she had launched the affair to please him.  Disaster results.Fans of Edmond O'Brien, who performed with great accomplishment in the film noir classic &quot;D.O.A.&quot; as well as in many other films, were overjoyed to see this fine actor honored with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in playing nervous, palm-sweating public relations man Oscar Muldoon in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa.&quot;  O'Brien is at his best in reading Stevens, who had treated him as hired baggage, the riot act when he is offered a position by a South American playboy with designs on Gardner.",5,"Bogart as Oracle, Gardner as Screen Goddess",1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2439,"['Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'was', 'dialogue', 'master', 'as', 'well', 'brilliant', 'director', 'evidenced', 'hits', 'such', 'quot', 'Eve', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives.', 'quot', 'top', 'game', 'once', 'more', 'writing', 'familiar', 'area', 'world', 'film', 'quot', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa.', 'quot', 'film', 'number', 'one', 'showcase', 'vehicle', 'career', 'astoundingly', 'beautiful', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'cast', 'drama', 'Maria', 'Vargas', 'dancer', 'Madrid', 'who', 'discovered', 'film', 'director', 'Bogart', 'behalf', 'then', 'producer', 'boss', 'Warren', 'Stevens', 'humorless', 'ruthless', 'financial', 'giant', 'modeled', 'somewhat', 'persona', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'brief', 'meteoric', 'career', 'international', 'film', 'star', 'meeting', 'untimely', 'death', 'peak', 'beauty', 'screen', 'renown', 'Mankiewicz', 'out', 'stops', 'display', 'beauty', 'angle', 'showcasing', 'beautifully', 'chiseled', 'face', 'accented', 'elegant', 'cheekbones.Bogart', 'role', 'world-wise', 'oracle', 'delivering', 'pungent', 'Mankiewicz', 'one-liners', 'snappy', 'first', 'person', 'narration', 'surrogate', 'father', 'restless', 'Gardner', 'who', 'superficilialities', 'film', 'world', 'free', 'spirit', 'stardom', 'confinements', 'living', 'glass', 'house', 'seen', 'Bogart', 'convenient', 'buffer', 'Stevens', 'who', 'Gardner', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'else', 'detests', 'passion.Eventually', 'Gardner', 'handsome', 'prince', 'exotic', 'dreams', 'Italian', 'nobleman', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'tragedy', 'compelled', 'love', 'quot', 'heart', 'quot', 'unable', 'provide', 'kind', 'physical', 'fulfillment', 'due', 'war', 'injury', 'left', 'impotent', 'When', 'fulfill', 'desire', 'heir', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'betrayed', 'when', 'had', 'launched', 'affair', 'please', 'Disaster', 'results.Fans', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'performed', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'noir', 'classic', 'quot', 'D.O.A.', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'fine', 'actor', 'honored', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'playing', 'nervous', 'palm-sweating', 'public', 'relations', 'man', 'Oscar', 'Muldoon', 'quot', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa.', 'quot', ""O'Brien"", 'best', 'reading', 'Stevens', 'who', 'had', 'treated', 'hired', 'baggage', 'riot', 'act', 'when', 'offered', 'position', 'South', 'American', 'playboy', 'designs', 'Gardner']",Barefoot Contessa VHS
