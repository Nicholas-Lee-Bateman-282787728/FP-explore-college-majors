The scenery was beautiful. My daughter is reading a book about Sacajawea and it opened her eyes to many interesting events in history. One of them being how the Indians lived and their devotion to the land was very apparent.

Read,"[3, 6]","Apparently, the screenwriters thought an expedition that resulted in no battle casualties and no real fights with the indians was not sufficiently dramatic.  So they larded the story up with romantic nonsense between Clark and Sacajawea (and a non-existent love triangle among Lewis, Clark and Julia ""Judith"" Hancock).  For good measure, they threw in two pitched battles with indians.  None of this ever took place.I think the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition is exciting enough to be told accurately.

894901,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0007Y08UG,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","I like old westerns, even weaker ones and I am a huge fan of Charlton Heston, even in his lesser films - but this thing was too bad even for me... Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.This film supposedly tells the story of Lewis and Clark expedition and from the cover it is easy to deduce that Saccajawea is also one of the main protagonists. Before even going into the annoying changes to the real history, let's just say that this film is in many parts boring as finally very little happens and we can hardly feel the thrill which should be associated with such an incredible voyage in the wilderness and the discovery of new, ucharted and unknown lands. Dialogs are mostly lame, humour is almost completely absent and even if a couple of (fictitious) battles with Indians (poorly filmed by the way) are thrown in, well, this thing never really takes off.Casting a very blue-eyed and fair skinned Donna Reed as Saccajawea was of course a big mistake - if the mores of those times didn't allow for a Native American actress or a hot Latina, the director should have used at least a South European/Mediterranean type brunette. Because of this casting mistake Donna Reed, an otherwise talented and very attractive actress (well deserved Best Actress Oscar in 1953 for ""From here to eternity""), is forced to wear during all the time an embarassing face paint, which is completely RIDICULOUS and ruins most of this film. Also, real Saccajawea was 16 when the expedition began and at 34 Donna Reed was simply too old to play her...If this was not enough, the real story of Lewis, Clark and Saccajawea is here changed ALMOST COMPLETELY! Here are the main points (SPOILERS ahead):- no, Clark didn't steal Lewis fianc&eacute;e before the expedition or at any other moment- no, Lewis and Clark didn't bicker and fight during the expedittion - they were best friends since already a long time before expedition and remained so until the end of their lives- trapper (""coureur des bois"") Toussaint Charbonneau was a loyal and higly succesful guide for Lewis and Clark expedition, who was greatly rewarded for his services once the voyage was finished - he certainly WASN'T a back stabbing traitor plotting with hostile Indians- there never was a romance between Saccajawea and Clark; in fact Saccajawea, after being for some time a slave of Minnetaree tribe, was bought by Toussaint Charbonneau and became his common law wife (she was 13 at this time); they remained together until her death. Messing with the woman of another member of the expedition and especially the main guide would have been not only dishonorable but also could jeopardize the whole enterprise - and therefore Clark certainly didn't even think about such a thing.- there were NO battles against hostile Indians during the whole expedition - NOT EVEN ONE! The one dangerous situation which nearly degenerated into a battle was defused by Lewis with a large gift of tobacco - and also a bottle of whiskey...- Saccajawea was pregnant at the beginning of the expedition and gave birth to a healthy boy soon after - the child, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, lived and became the mascot of the expedition and much later went to be a quite wealthy and succesful man - but in this film the pregnancy and the birth of the child are completely eliminated...- Saccajawea most certainly never travelled to Washington, was NOT received at White House and certainly didn't meet the President of United States...Taking all this into account I must say that for me this film is a failure. I could live with complete changing of history if at least it was an interesting and well made thing - but it isn't. Even good performance of both leading actors, Fred MacMurray as Lewis and Charlton Heston as Clark, cannot help it. Therefore you can skip it without losing much. Only for the greatest fans of ""Chuck"" Heston.",2,A film partly boring and partly ridiculous with real Lewis and Clark history raped every two minutes...,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,3871,"['like', 'old', 'westerns', 'even', 'weaker', 'ones', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'even', 'lesser', 'films', 'thing', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'even', 'more', 'impressions', 'SPOILERS.This', 'film', 'supposedly', 'story', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'expedition', 'cover', 'easy', 'deduce', 'Saccajawea', 'also', 'one', 'main', 'protagonists', 'even', 'going', 'annoying', 'changes', 'real', 'history', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'many', 'parts', 'boring', 'finally', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'can', 'hardly', 'feel', 'thrill', 'should', 'be', 'associated', 'incredible', 'voyage', 'wilderness', 'discovery', 'new', 'ucharted', 'unknown', 'lands', 'Dialogs', 'are', 'mostly', 'lame', 'humour', 'almost', 'completely', 'absent', 'even', 'couple', 'fictitious', 'Indians', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'way', 'are', 'thrown', 'well', 'thing', 'never', 'really', 'off.Casting', 'very', 'blue-eyed', 'fair', 'skinned', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Saccajawea', 'was', 'course', 'big', 'mistake', 'mores', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Native', 'American', 'actress', 'hot', 'Latina', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'least', 'South', 'European/Mediterranean', 'type', 'brunette', 'casting', 'mistake', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'otherwise', 'talented', 'very', 'attractive', 'actress', 'well', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', '1953', 'From', 'here', 'eternity', 'forced', 'wear', 'time', 'embarassing', 'face', 'paint', 'completely', 'RIDICULOUS', 'most', 'film', 'Also', 'real', 'Saccajawea', 'was', '16', 'when', 'expedition', 'began', '34', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'real', 'story', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Saccajawea', 'here', 'changed', 'ALMOST', 'COMPLETELY', 'Here', 'are', 'main', 'points', 'SPOILERS', 'ahead', 'Clark', 'did', ""n't"", 'steal', 'Lewis', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'expedition', 'other', 'moment-', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'did', ""n't"", 'bicker', 'fight', 'expedittion', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'already', 'long', 'time', 'expedition', 'remained', 'so', 'end', 'lives-', 'trapper', 'coureur', 'des', 'Toussaint', 'Charbonneau', 'was', 'loyal', 'higly', 'succesful', 'guide', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'expedition', 'who', 'was', 'greatly', 'rewarded', 'services', 'once', 'voyage', 'was', 'finished', 'certainly', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'back', 'stabbing', 'traitor', 'plotting', 'hostile', 'Indians-', 'never', 'was', 'romance', 'Saccajawea', 'Clark', 'fact', 'Saccajawea', 'being', 'time', 'slave', 'Minnetaree', 'tribe', 'was', 'bought', 'Toussaint', 'Charbonneau', 'became', 'common', 'law', 'wife', 'was', '13', 'time', 'remained', 'together', 'death', 'Messing', 'woman', 'member', 'expedition', 'especially', 'main', 'guide', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'only', 'dishonorable', 'also', 'could', 'jeopardize', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'therefore', 'Clark', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'thing.-', 'were', 'NO', 'battles', 'hostile', 'Indians', 'whole', 'expedition', 'EVEN', 'ONE', 'one', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'nearly', 'degenerated', 'battle', 'was', 'defused', 'Lewis', 'large', 'gift', 'tobacco', 'also', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'Saccajawea', 'was', 'pregnant', 'beginning', 'expedition', 'gave', 'birth', 'healthy', 'boy', 'soon', 'child', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Charbonneau', 'lived', 'became', 'mascot', 'expedition', 'much', 'later', 'went', 'be', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'succesful', 'man', 'film', 'pregnancy', 'birth', 'child', 'are', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'Saccajawea', 'most', 'certainly', 'never', 'travelled', 'Washington', 'was', 'NOT', 'received', 'White', 'House', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Taking', 'account', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'failure', 'could', 'live', 'complete', 'changing', 'history', 'least', 'was', 'interesting', 'well', 'made', 'thing', ""n't"", 'Even', 'good', 'performance', 'leading', 'actors', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Lewis', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Clark', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'can', 'skip', 'losing', 'much', 'Only', 'greatest', 'fans', 'Chuck', 'Heston']",The Far Horizons

894903,A27M15DFUPV1CK,B0007Y08UG,peterfromkanata,"[39, 42]","Released theatrically in 1954, ""The Far Horizons"" is an entertaining film about the Lewis and Clark expedition at the turn of the ninteenth century, a pivotal event in the history of the United States. I suspect that historians will roll their eyes at the ""Hollywood"" version of this famously long, arduous but important expedition that ultimately ensured that America would reach from ""sea to sea"". Personally I have no problem with actual events being ""enhanced"" for the entertainment, as well as the enlightenment, of an audience.President Thomas Jefferson (avuncular Herbert Heyes) has just completed the massive Louisiana Purchase deal with Napoleon, greatly expanding the territory of the United States. However, this vast area now needs to be explored and mapped. The President decides that his loyal secretary, Meriwether Lewis (steadfast Fred MacMurray), is the man for the job, along with a soldier experienced in fighting Indians, William Clark (a driven, intense Charlton Heston). The Lewis/Clark partnership gets off to a rocky start since both men are in love with the same woman, Washington socialite, Julia Hancock (long-suffering Barbara Hale--Della Street on TV's ""Perry Mason"").Fortunately, these necessary but rather dull opening scenes soon give way to the expedition itself, at which point the film remains consistently engrossing. Of course, this new territory is by no means uninhabited--many Native American tribes have long established themselves, and regard the coming of the ""white man"" with great suspicion, even outright hostility.Clark, a veteran of various ""Indian wars"", has little patience or sympathy for these people. It is Lewis who must use all of his diplomatic skills to gain their trust, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. They meet the Shoshone maid, Sacajawea (lovely Donna Reed), a prisoner/slave of an enemy tribe. After a few ""hurdles"" are overcome, she agrees to serve as their guide--as it turns out, the trip would not have been successful, and they would not have survived without her. Her intelligence and beauty soon melt Clark's hard heart, and Lewis finds that he has the distraction of a romance on his hands, as well as more hostile tribes and natural disasters to contend with.There are many scenes in this film which are gorgeous--the natural beauty of America's plains, rushing rivers, lush forests and snow-capped mountains more than compensate for the hardships that our intrepid explorers must endure.The DVD is presented in widescreen format with outstanding colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.""The Far Horizons"" is a rousing adventure that the whole family can enjoy.
