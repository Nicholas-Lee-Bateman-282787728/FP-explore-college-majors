That is, beaver trappers at the tail end of the craze for beaver pelts for men's hats. At the rendezvous, they don't get much for their pelts, and the explanation is sitting on the buyer's head: a silk top hat. But an old Indian friend of Tyler's tells them about a river way up north where the beaver are so plentiful that they just walk into your traps. Problem is, it is protected by Blackfeet Indians, and Tyler's woman is a Blackfoot who escaped from an abusive husband.The story is actually pretty conventional as such stories go, with life pretty cheap and aggression the general rule. One moderately unusual factor is the number of characters who are thought to be dead and turn up alive.

Keith and Heston shine in this epic like picture as the good friends trap together and enjoy the wild life of the mountain man. The film features authentic language, outfits and weapons along with a wild true to life looking rough rendezvous. A collision course with the Indians is expected and it comes with overwhelming force as captured Heston has to make a run for it as in the classic African movie ""The Naked Prey"". Keith is in his element providing humor as well as a more than suitable companion for Heston in the film. Their chemistry is excellent and if you like Jeremiah Johnson, you will like this movie too. Not as gritty as Jeremiah but very satisfying. One negative is that the real Mountain Men respected Indians, such as the Black Feet, thus they usually traveled in large groups with only small groupings briefly breaking off but staying in close vicinity.

Jugs of whiskey.But enough about last night's party.Director Richard Lang's THE MOUNTAIN MEN is a rough-and-tumble yarn depicting the fur trapping industry's final days in the pristine splendor of the northern Rockies.  Even in such a remote region, the demand back East for top hats made of beaver skin resulted in the virtual extinction of the buck-toothed rodents in their mountain habitats; on top of that, silk hats were rapidly becoming the fashion craze, creating even more of a hardship on the gritty mountain men who trapped along countless streams and rivers, searching for what remained of the elusive beaver population.It was a hard life, predicated on an individual's ability to survive in a harsh environment based on his wits and his bare hands.  Interaction with other people was rare--the need to get along with neighboring Indian tribes a must.  And infrequently, perhaps once every two or three years, the trappers would unite at a &quot;rendezvous&quot; to trade their pelts for cash and let off a little steam.  To say that such a gathering was rowdy and violent is kind of like saying turtles have shells.Charlton Heston &quot;shines&quot; (a little mountain man lingo, there) as fur trapper Bill Tyler, a quiet man who only wishes to be left alone so he can find that last valley just teeming with beaver.  But there's a problem:  while fighting off a band of Blackfoot bent on stealing his horses and supplies he attracts the company of a young squaw (Victoria Racimo) who happens to be married to a chief with a very serious attitude (Stephen Macht).  Thus Tyler and his new companion are forced to run, and run, and run some more to escape the warrior's wrath.While Heston is solid in his role, Brian Keith absolutely steals the show as crusty Henry Frapp.  Henry, a friend of Tyler's, is a cantankerous, foul-mouthed, fun-loving old coot who vividly breathes life into the mountain man persona.  Keith dominates every scene he's in, and he's fun to watch.Heck, THE MOUNTAIN MEN is fun to watch.  The screenplay, incidentally, was written by Heston's son, Fraser, who obviously did his homework concerning this fascinating aspect of the Old West.  Grab a plug of tobacco and enjoy.--D.

380726,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6303589065,Erik North,"[2, 3]","The opening credits sequence makes it seem like you're about to watch a typical Disney-type wilderness adventure, or something straight out of Grizzly Adams.  But it only takes about two or three minutes to let you know one important thing about THE MOUNTAIN MEN: Grizzly Adams, this ain't.Filmed completely on location in the wildlands of Wyoming, and set in the mid-1800s, this rough western adventure stars Charlton Heston and Brian Keith as a pair of fur trappers still looking for beaver for the fur trade before the animal vanishes from the Rockies.  They live a rough life, and they often talk rough too (Keith especially; you'd never know that he'd been in TV's ""Family Affair"" once).  Every once in a while, they run into the Crow and Blackfoot Indians that still ride the range.  And when they come upon an Indian squaw (Victoria Racimo) escaping from her vicious husband Heavy Eagle (Stephen Macht), and protect her, then they must confront Macht and his Blackfoot warriors.Aside from some historically inaccurate portraits of the Indians and their life, THE MOUNTAIN MEN, directed by Richard Lang from an original screenplay by Heston's son, Fraser Clarke Heston, is at its true best when it focuses on the often salty banter between Heston and Keith, and the lives they lead.  Neither man can believe that their day will eventually end, nor can they imagine the land ever being settled (but we the audience know better).  The film is quite bloody in a few places, and one white explorer (Seymour Cassel) literally loses his head rather gruesomely to Macht and his warriors near the climax, hence the 'R' rating, but otherwise it is not so shockingly over-the-top in its violence.  Heston, naturally enough, is convincing in his grizzled role, though Keith nearly outdoes him (a tough task even when Heston is not up to par).  Macht makes for a fairly menacing heavy; and Racimo is good as the Indian squaw at the center of things.Though Lang's direction won't make one forget the hard-edged approach that someone like Peckinpah bought to the Western, there's more than enough to recommend THE MOUNTAIN MEN to people.  But just don't let anyone under age to watch it by themselves; it is rough, profane, and occasionally gory for a reason.",4,"Grizzly Adams, This Ain't",1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,2251,"['opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'seem', ""'re"", 'watch', 'typical', 'Disney-type', 'wilderness', 'adventure', 'something', 'straight', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'let', 'know', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'THE', 'MOUNTAIN', 'MEN', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', ""ain't.Filmed"", 'completely', 'location', 'wildlands', 'Wyoming', 'set', 'mid-1800s', 'rough', 'western', 'adventure', 'stars', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'pair', 'fur', 'trappers', 'still', 'looking', 'beaver', 'fur', 'trade', 'animal', 'vanishes', 'Rockies', 'live', 'rough', 'life', 'often', 'talk', 'rough', 'too', 'Keith', 'especially', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', ""'d"", 'been', 'TV', 'Family', 'Affair', 'once', 'once', 'while', 'run', 'Crow', 'Blackfoot', 'Indians', 'still', 'ride', 'range', 'when', 'come', 'Indian', 'squaw', 'Victoria', 'Racimo', 'escaping', 'vicious', 'husband', 'Heavy', 'Eagle', 'Stephen', 'Macht', 'protect', 'then', 'must', 'confront', 'Macht', 'Blackfoot', 'warriors.Aside', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'portraits', 'Indians', 'life', 'THE', 'MOUNTAIN', 'MEN', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Lang', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Heston', 'son', 'Fraser', 'Clarke', 'Heston', 'true', 'best', 'when', 'often', 'salty', 'banter', 'Heston', 'Keith', 'lives', 'lead', 'man', 'can', 'believe', 'day', 'will', 'eventually', 'end', 'can', 'imagine', 'land', 'ever', 'being', 'settled', 'audience', 'know', 'better', 'film', 'quite', 'bloody', 'few', 'places', 'one', 'white', 'explorer', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'literally', 'head', 'rather', 'gruesomely', 'Macht', 'warriors', 'climax', 'hence', 'R', 'rating', 'not', 'so', 'shockingly', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'Heston', 'naturally', 'enough', 'convincing', 'grizzled', 'role', 'Keith', 'nearly', 'outdoes', 'tough', 'task', 'even', 'when', 'Heston', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'Macht', 'fairly', 'menacing', 'heavy', 'Racimo', 'good', 'Indian', 'squaw', 'center', 'things.Though', 'Lang', 'direction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'forget', 'hard-edged', 'approach', 'someone', 'Peckinpah', 'bought', 'Western', 'more', 'enough', 'recommend', 'THE', 'MOUNTAIN', 'MEN', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'age', 'watch', 'rough', 'profane', 'occasionally', 'gory', 'reason']",Mountain Men VHS

Charlton Heston has played in Ben Hur; Ten Commandments; Planet of the Apes; Omega Man; Midway; Gray Lady Down; TV's Dynasty drama series; and other legendary roles.

Brian Keith has played in The Wind And The Lion; The Parent Trap; Hardcastle and McCormick; TV's Family Affair sitcom; Wagon Train; The Virginian; and other legendary roles.

It is worth watching, but not one I'll watch over and over and over like the aforementioned handfuls either actor has been part of.  On the other hand, maybe I was expecting too much because of who was in it.  I did like the expanse of the wilderness, the scenery was superb, but that credit goes to whoever found the location and isn't so much a cause for kudos otherwise to producers or directors upon that basis.  I liked Victoria Racimo's portrayal of the squaw Running Moon, and she is as fine an actress as the two male leads are actors in my opinion.  Victoria has played in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; Doogie Howser M.D.; Spenser For Hire; Falcon Crest; Fantasy Island; The Chisholms; Logan's Run; Black Sheep Squadron; Hawaii Five-O; The Day of the Dolphin; Red Sky at Morning; and other notable roles.

Right from the start it grabs your attention with the beautiful scenery and sweeping music score supplied by Michel Legrand. There's action aplenty right from the start and lot's of humor and gratuitous violence throughout to keep your interest. It stars Charlton Heston and Brian Keith as two crusty old mountain men who get more than they bargained for when Heston's character takes an indian sqaw under his wing. The acting is plausible, the direction is well done by Richard Lang, the script is also pretty well handled by Heston's own son Fraser Clarke Heston although it is at times (most times)rather foul.I remember seeing Chuck Heston saying in an interview that he actually regretted making this movie. Perhaps it was because instead of playing a biblical character in this movie he was actually taking the Lord's name in vain.I am dissapointed in this dvd release because it is not in widescreen. If any movie deserves it this one does, and even though it boasts about being mastered in high definition the picture quality really sucks.

"" On Sacred Ground"" very much like Jeremiah Johnson. And This movie. ""The Mountain Men"" May be the best Mountain Man movie ever made. With action galore, humor, realism and great acting. Combined that with a beautiful musical score and great Cinematography ""The Mountain Men"" is arguably the best of them all. It has a believable well paced story line, and infectious endearing characters, Brian Keith just about steals the show! If it wasn't for Charlton Heston's larger than life presence, Brian Keith would have stolen the show. But together they are as mighty a force as the nature that surrounds them. They just don't make them like this anymore. And the beautiful thing about this movie is it will never feel dated or outdated because its a period piece done to perfection. Filled with many colorful character's like the hilarious ""Cross Otter"" & the lovable old ""Iron Belly"" I would recommend this movie to anyone. You don't have to be a western fan either I do mean anyone! If you can't have fun watching this movie you better see a doctor your either clinically depressed or dead. That is my review of the movie, but the product doesn't warrant a 5 star rating. I agree with many others I was replacing my worn out V.H.S. full screen version, and this D.V.D. version contains even less of the movie. It must have been zoomed in & then panned & scanned during the transfer process losing even more of the movie than my already chopped up V.H.S. full screen version.

380732,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6303589065,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I liked a lot this little known and somehow atypical 1980 western. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Between 1810 and 1880, other than the Indians, many trappers were also active in the Rocky Mountains, looking mostly for beaver furs. Although most of them were White (Americans or Canadians), some were also Black or Latino (coming from Mexico). As they usually got along well with local tribes, with time many of them married Indian women. Those trappers were commonly called ""mountain men"". At the peak of their activity, between 1820 and 1840, there were as much as 3000 mountain men operating every year in the Rocky Mountains area. In those times their yearly rendez-vous gathered usually no less than 500 trappers (and also some traders and many Indians). In 1839-40 the beaver fur trade strongly declined and as the result most of trappers recoverted in other activities (farming, trading, scouting for the Army) - but some die hards survived until 1880, when this mode of life definitely disappeared.This film tells the story of two such trappers, old timers and best friends Bill Tyler (Charlton Heston) and Henry Frapp (Brian Keith). The story happens somewhere around 1838, in the time when beaver fur trade started to become less and less profitable. Finding themselves in financial trouble Tyler and Frapp decide to give themselves one more season to try to make up for their losses. But to do that they have to enter the part of mountains to which Blackfoot Indians always refused acces to all trappers - and that will put both men in much more trouble than their previous financial worries. But the REAL problems will begin when they meet Running Moon (Victoria Racimo), a proud, fierce and beautiful Blackfoot woman, who is on the run from her own tribe - and once she joins Tyler and Frapp, well, they will be in for one really hellish adventure...By its subject it is a rather unusual western. You will not see here any revolvers, Winchesters or even twin-barrelled shotguns - here the weapons of choice are flintlock muzzle-loaded muskets, one shot pistols, bows and arrows, spears, tomahawks, knives and in last resort fists, nails and teeth. There will be no scenes in a saloon, because there is no towns in this film - just Indian villages and trappers camps. For the same reason no sheriff will appear at any moment - in those times there was no law in the Rocky Mountains other than one a man could impose and defend with his musket, knife or fists.All three main actors did very well in this film, with an aging Charlton Heston offering here one of his last really great performances. Brian Keith did very well too - and Victoria Racimo, who says little in this film, steals many scenes by her beauty and the fierceness of her character.This film shows, I believe, rather faithfully the life of ""mountain men"" and as it was made in 1980, it is still not contaminated by the overwhelming political correctness - the feminists can especially have some hard time watching this movie...))) Indians are I believe also particularly well portrayed, as real human beings, not the paragons of all virtues... There is a lot of violence in this film and it considerably shocked the audiences in 1980, but by today's standards it is not very unusual. Images of mountains are beautiful, and the ending is surprising and quite strong.Bottom line, I liked this film, I will keep the DVD for more viewings in the future and I recommend it to all western amateurs and all Charlton Heston fans.

380733,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,6303589065,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[8, 11]","&quot;The Mountain Men&quot; tells the story of two free-spirited fur trappers along the Rocky Mountain range in the mid-19th century.  Billy Tyler(Charlton Heston) and Henry Frapp (Brain Keith) are two rather down-on-their luck trappers living the good life on the wide open frontier, trapping beaver, going to rendezvous, and getting drunk.  But the pair get caught up in a raid by Blackfeet Indians and Tyler winds up gaining the affections of Running Moon, the wife of the powerful Blackfeet warrior Heavy Eagle, who soon becomes obssessed with killing Tyler and taking back his &quot;property&quot;.  Tyler and Frapp spend most of their time paling around and trying to keep one step ahead of the vengeful Heavy Eagle, before finally forced into the obligatory final confrontation.&quot;Mountain Men&quot; is entertaining and interesting in that it depicts a timeperiod often ignored in modern film.  While I felt that there was a bit of unnecessary silliness in certain segments, the film held my interest, especially so as it shows the hardships faced by many of the longhunters who went out as the outriders of white civilization, as well as the strong relationship between the whites and the native tribes with whom they lived and died.  It is too bad that films of this genre are few and far between.

380735,A1OCVWN4K4Q3FN,6303589065,M. Keogh,"[3, 8]","""The Mountain Men"" is about two aging trappers, Bill Tyler (Charlton Heston) and Henry Frapp (Brian Keith), and their adventures during the waning days of the Rocky Mountain beaver trade (1840's?).  Despite their dissimilar personalities, Tyler is a taciturn loner and Frapp is boisterous and outgoing, they've been friends for decades.  With beaver getting scarce and the price of plews bottoming out, Tyler and Frapp face changing times.  However, they continue to search for an elusive valley where it is said the beaver are so plentiful that they're just begging to be caught.  Along the way they meet up with Running Moon (Victoria Racimo),the runaway abused wife of a Blackfoot chief, Heavy Eagle (Stephen Macht).  Needless to say, Heavy Eagle wants both his wife back and Tyler's scalp- although we get the impression he is far more interested in the later.As a film ""The Mountain Men"" is pedestrian.  It's not too hard understand why it was box office and critical flop.  It's direction is bland, the musical score is overblown, and plot is full of ridiculous implausibilities.  For example: characters are shown wandering around a vast wilderness yet they bump into their friends with a frequency that would be tough to attain if they lived in a small suburb.  Also this is the kind of film in which Indian warriors apparently withdraw from battle to allow for maudlin, overwrought death scenes to be performed without interruption.Further, all the AmerIndian characters are portrayed by non-AmerIndian actors.  And everyone speaks English- so Crow, Blackfeet, and mountain men all speak the same dialect of Southern Califorinese.  Also this is one of those movies in which Indian warriors throw their lives away by charging (on foot!) right into the muzzles of their enemies' rifles.  If the real Blackfeet were as incompetent at warfare as they are shown here then they would have never garnered their fearsome reputation.The weaknesses of this movie are glaring.  However, it does have Chuck Heston who brings his considerable amount of screen presence to the film.  Although that thing he is wearing on his head is a distraction (I'm not talking about his hat), Heston takes to these historical roles like a duck to water.  Brian Keith, who is unfortunately saddled with a lot of over-the-top vulgar dialogue, shows that he was always an underrated actor.  Also, not even a hack director can screw-up the beauty of Wyoming (I'll join the chorus- why wasn't the DVD presented in widescreen?)Finally, I'm a big fan of A.B. Guthrie's mountain man novel, ""The Big Sky"" and it's obvious that Frasier Heston, the screenwriter, is too.  How the characters talk and what they talk about seemed to have been lifted wholesale from Guthrie's novel.  So much so that I wonder if Guthrie's estate ever asked for royalties.  ""This child,"" ""gone under,"" ""shines,"" the use of the ""n"" word, and the sense of loss of a country that was free and unspoiled about to overtaken by others less inclined to leave it untouched are all from Guthrie's novel.Overall, if you're interested in mountain men and/or a fan of adventure films then you may enjoy this movie.

In my opinion it ranks as one of the best of the mountain man/Native American genre. It is also as good a film as Charlton Heston was ever a part of.What's so good about it? Well, first of all it has no glaring historical inaccuracies- those always drive me nuts. The costumes and props are as accurate as I've seen. The scenery is absolutely magnificent and you feel like you are there- it always reminds me of my own times in the Central Rockies. As for the acting, well, you actually start caring about the characters, and thats a pretty good sign of good acting in my book. The dialog is also among the most consistently humorous and clever that I've heard- there's nothing phoney or forced about it. Heston and Keith play off of each other perfectly. Not least of all, the Indian peoples are treated with the dignity and complexity that they deserve- no stereotypes here.I don't buy every DVD that comes along, but I had to have this one for my personal collection.

This movie features an ageing Heston and Brian Keith. Now of course I knew this coming in, but that isn't really the problem. The problem comes in how preposterous it was to see these two old guys fighting off indians and whatnot with relative ease. The movie is just plain bad. I honestly had trouble sitting through it. This movie tries to be harsh, using profanity and sexual situations. It then tries to be a movie for the family using comedy. This movie is nothing but one big jumble of mixed themes and intentions. I'm giving this movie three stars because I like Charlton Heston and Brian Keith. Just don't sit down with this movie expecting to be satisfied with the plot of the movie, or the flow, the tone, the logic. Just sit down and study these ageing actors and be glad we have this glimpse into their later years. It's hard to believe that this movie was less than a decade later after films like Soylent Green, The Omega Man, Gray Lady Down. Heston put on a lot of weight. He hobbles around the way I have seen him in other films. I think the man had back problems. I am simply saying that their is nothing dynamic at all about Heston in this picture. I think Brian Keith has more charm and appeal in this film, even though all he does is act like a rough and rowdy mountain man.Sorry guys, but this movie is far from great.

With that said it is still an enjoyable film with Brian Keith acting a part that is out of character from the usual roles he plays.I agree to a point with other reviews on the DVD about it effects lose from showing the nature scenes in full screen and not wide screen.  I find what has been neglected in the reviews by others about the film is the struggle that is faced by all its characters.  First the two mountain men are struggling with the decline of the fur industry and their future in it.  Secondly the Native Americans are struggling with the White Man entering upon and changing their way of life.  I feel by watching the DVD you get a chance to look at some of the problems that must have been faced by both sides during this period of change in American history.All in all an enjoyable DVD with a great perspective of how the West must have been won.,3,How The West Was Won,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,986,"['enjoy', 'acting', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'DVD', 'Mountain', 'Men', 'not', 'one', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performances', 'said', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'acting', 'part', 'character', 'usual', 'roles', 'plays.I', 'agree', 'point', 'other', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'effects', 'lose', 'showing', 'nature', 'scenes', 'full', 'screen', 'not', 'wide', 'screen', 'find', 'been', 'neglected', 'reviews', 'others', 'film', 'struggle', 'faced', 'characters', 'First', 'two', 'mountain', 'men', 'are', 'struggling', 'decline', 'fur', 'industry', 'future', 'Secondly', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'struggling', 'White', 'Man', 'entering', 'changing', 'way', 'life', 'feel', 'watching', 'DVD', 'get', 'chance', 'look', 'problems', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'faced', 'sides', 'period', 'change', 'American', 'history.All', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'great', 'perspective', 'how', 'West', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'won']",Mountain Men VHS

Keith more or less steals things as the boisterous mountaineer Frapp, although his character isn't much different from Heston's.  Only the paychecks were different, I guess.  Unlike many westerns of the last quarter century or so, the Native cultures - in this case Blackfeet and Crow - aren't given much screen time.  Heavy Eagle paints his face and mistreats his woman, but that's about it as far as cultural investigation goes.  If anything the Crow and Blackfeet come across as the rowdy boys of the high pines, mooning their defeated enemy and stealing each others horses on a fairly regular basis.If you've seen and are a fan of Robert Redford's Jeremiah Johnson THE MOUNTAIN MEN may disappoint you.  This isn't a thoughtful reflection on nature, or the clash of cultures, or much of anything else. Rather it's 100-minutes of chase and pursuit in buckskin and floppy bearskin robes.
