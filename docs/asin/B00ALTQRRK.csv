That is far, far, far (did I say far?) more preferable to the two-sided DVDs usually found in such &#34;twin packs.&#34;  The latter are easier to scratch and I simply won't buy them. Only problem -- the manufacturer/studio doesn't tell the consumer if the contents are twin-sided or not. They should, in the interest of full disclosure print that on the case and in their advertising. That said, the viewer will thoroughly enjoy Paul Hogan's portrayal of Mick Dundee. The first movie is the best and sequel in a near runner up. The visas of Australia and the, to be commended, use of aborigine actors are icing on the cake.

1613102,A41XDR2AM962G,B00ALTQRRK,DVD reviewer,"[1, 2]","The '80s were all about fish-out-of-water films, and one of the most successful was &#34;Crocodile Dundee,&#34; an Australian comedy-adventure starring Paul Hogan. The first half is all about a &#34;Jane&#34; journalist roughing it in the outback to get a story on a Tarzan-like fellow who's a bit of a local legend, while the second (and more fun) half we see Dundee in New York City trying to survive in the urban wild . . . and make friends in the process. The sequel is more of a standard crime story about drug lords trying to recover incriminating evidence and Sue and Mick caught in their crosshairs, but even that one picks up in the second half when the bad guys are the fish out of water after following Sue and Mick to the outback.

Sometimes though, when there is a great movie put out on Blu-ray, and it has a sequel, they will only release the first film first, and hope to sell a few hundred thousand copies, but then they will release it as a double film release later to re-sell the first film again, concluding that you would have been double-dipped. They did that with ""Airplane"", then doubled it up with ""Airplane II: The Sequel"", and also with ""Every Which way But Loose"", and then later doubled up that one with ""Any Which Way You Can"" that was not released individually.  And, of course, there are more.Anyway, I was worried that people would forget about the great ""Crocodile Dundee"" series because the first two films were fabulous.

1613114,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00ALTQRRK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 4]","The CROCODILE DUNDEE/CROCODILE DUNDEE II DOUBLE FEATURE is a double feature movie set that contains the first two Crocodile Dundee movies.Although he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn&#8217;t hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she&#8217;s trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (&#8220;You call that a knife?&#8221;), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today&#8217;s standards.Although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.It's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.CROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.I first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.CROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.It&#8217;s great to find a DVD that has both these movies together in one package.",5,Double the Pleasure,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,4541,"['CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE/CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'DOUBLE', 'FEATURE', 'double', 'feature', 'movie', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'tv', 'star', 'Australia', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'was', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'United', 'States', 'Then', '1986', 'came', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'Hogan', 'became', 'huge', 'international', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'also', 'helped', 'make', 'Australia', 'dream', 'vacation', 'destination', 'millions', 'Americans.Hogan', 'stars', 'movie', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'part', 'Aborigine', 'crocodile', 'hunter', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 'hunt', 'fun', 'Sue', 'Charlton', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'New', 'York', 'journalist', 'assignment', 'Australia', 'coming', 'back', 'home', '8217', 's', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'local', 'man', 'very', 'small', 'town', 'Walkabout', 'Creek', 'who', 'supposedly', 'had', 'part', 'leg', 'bit', 'off', 'croc', 'managed', 'survive', 'crawled', 'out', 'Outback', 'several', 'days', 'later', 'eventually', 'man', 'who', 'story', 'about', 'take', 'journey', 'retrace', 'steps', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Australian', 'wild', 'Sue', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'turn', 'when', 'Mick', 'accompany', 'Sue', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'urban', 'jungle.Hogan', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'movie', 'also', 'created', 'story', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'chemistry', 'Kozlowski', 'exceptional', 'really', 'came', 'surprise', 'two', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'very', 'long', 'term', 'real-life', 'romance', 'other.CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'major', 'surprise', 'hit', 'when', 'first', 'was', 'released', 'Other', '1980s', 'fashions', 'Sue', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'quarter', 'century', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'great', 'well-written', 'story', 'very', 'colorful', 'characters', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'amazing', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'lines', 'became', 'catch', 'phrases', 'time', '8220', 'call', 'knife', '8221', 'also', 'humor', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'classic', 'slapstick', 'wry', 'witty', 'Also', 'are', 'few', 'adult', 'references', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'basically', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', '1986', 'only', 'PG', 'movie', 'today', '8217', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'critical', 'darling', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'huge', 'popular', 'success', 'fresh', 'relevant', 'today', 'something', 'everyone', 'family', 'enjoy.It', 'rare', 'sequel', 'not', 'part', 'planned', 'series', 'films', 'up', 'original', 'film', 'sequels', 'almost', 'always', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'films', 'follow', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'one', 'few', 'sequels', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'ways', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'while', 'Mic', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'still', 'ignorant', 'city', 'life', 'Sue', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'writing', 'career', 'bigger', 'ever', 'One', 'day', 'Sue', 'photographs', 'ex-husband', 'Bob', 'depict', 'murder', 'man', 'hands', 'lead', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'cartel', 'life', 'immediate', 'danger', 'up', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'Mic', 'danger', ""n't"", 'over', 'criminals', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'So', 'Mic', 'Sue', 'back', 'Australia', 'can', 'protect', 'fight', 'off', 'drug', 'lords', 'own', 'turf.CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'humorous', 'moments', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', 'original', 'audience', 'actually', 'see', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'Mic', 'Sue', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'romance', 'thrown', 'romance', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'more', 'action-adventure', 'movie', 'good', 'dose', 'comedy', 'actually', 'tied', 'together', 'love', 'story', 'relationship', 'Mic', 'Sue', 'catalyst', 'most', 'plot', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'picture', 'found', 'gave', 'bit', 'gravitas', 'first', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'had.I', 'first', 'saw', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'movie', 'theatre', 'kid', 'remember', 'thinking', 'even', 'then', 'how', 'good', 'sequel', 'was', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'impression', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'not', 'changed', 'great', 'sequel', 'classic', '80s', 'movie', 'memorable', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'it.CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'II', 'great', 'sequel', 'follow-up', 'film', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'got', 'good', 'plot', 'right', 'balance', 'comedy', 'action-adventure.It', '8217', 'great', 'find', 'DVD', 'movies', 'together', 'one', 'package']",Crocodile Dundee / Crocodile Dundee II Double Feature
