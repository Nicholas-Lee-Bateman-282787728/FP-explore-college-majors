230897,A1XFARQM57SF22,630026338X,Daufhin Thorndike,"[17, 19]","This is a great look at the everday lives of your average blue- collar musician who doesn't expect fame and fortune, but is just trying to get by and play music because that is what they enjoy doing more than anything else in life. I don't understand the people who say michael J. Fox was miscast. I think he comes off as convincing in the character he portrays- and he is a real- life musician as well, even before he became famous for acting. Do people on here not realize that he did play his guitar parts for the movie and that the Barbusters were  a REAL band who played live to get into character for this movie? I recommend people try to tarck down the lIght Of Day soundtrack and hear Fox's rendition of ""Rude Mood"" as well as his signature song for the movie  ""Ain't Got No Place To Go"". Anyway, I think the music here was fantastic throughout, and comes off very realistically. When they are playing live in the film they are actually LIVE and not using pre-recorded studio tracks to give the concert illusion. And as characters in the film move throughout the concert scenes you can hear the music ebb, flow, and wane as it would in an actual concert setting. I especially appreciate the scene during the performance of  ""It's All Comin' Down Tonight"" where they show a group of people exit thier cars in the parking lot and enter the club. The music is muffled and you can sense the cuncussion effect against the club walls as they approach the front doors, and then as the doors open- wow! full on rockin' out! The attention to fine details like this that any music- loving concert veteran will be all too aware of is what seperates this film from alot of music- oriented films.  Lastly, the dynamic between Patty and Joe was very well done. It's a very realistic scenario among two siblings in the same band with different aspiriations and different ideals. Look at most bands around who have siblings and take notice of how often that scenario leads to conflict and band turmoil. Light Of Day was a great, realistic portrayal of a work class bar band, and it stands apart from so many others of the genre. It needs to be released on DVD soon (with lots of interviews and extras).",5,Overlooked Classic,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2194,"['great', 'look', 'everday', 'lives', 'average', 'blue-', 'collar', 'musician', 'who', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fame', 'fortune', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'play', 'music', 'what', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'was', 'miscast', 'think', 'off', 'convincing', 'character', 'portrays-', 'real-', 'life', 'musician', 'well', 'even', 'became', 'famous', 'acting', 'Do', 'people', 'here', 'not', 'realize', 'did', 'play', 'guitar', 'parts', 'movie', 'Barbusters', 'were', 'REAL', 'band', 'who', 'played', 'live', 'get', 'character', 'movie', 'recommend', 'people', 'try', 'tarck', 'down', 'lIght', 'Day', 'soundtrack', 'hear', 'Fox', 'rendition', 'Rude', 'Mood', 'as', 'well', 'signature', 'song', 'movie', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Got', 'No', 'Place', 'Go', 'Anyway', 'think', 'music', 'here', 'was', 'fantastic', 'off', 'very', 'realistically', 'When', 'are', 'playing', 'live', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'LIVE', 'not', 'using', 'pre-recorded', 'studio', 'tracks', 'give', 'concert', 'illusion', 'characters', 'film', 'move', 'concert', 'scenes', 'can', 'hear', 'music', 'ebb', 'flow', 'wane', 'would', 'actual', 'concert', 'setting', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'scene', 'performance', 'Comin', 'Down', 'Tonight', 'where', 'show', 'group', 'people', 'exit', 'thier', 'cars', 'parking', 'lot', 'enter', 'club', 'music', 'muffled', 'can', 'sense', 'cuncussion', 'effect', 'club', 'approach', 'front', 'doors', 'then', 'doors', 'open-', 'wow', 'full', 'rockin', 'out', 'attention', 'fine', 'details', 'music-', 'loving', 'concert', 'veteran', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'aware', 'what', 'film', 'alot', 'music-', 'oriented', 'films', 'Lastly', 'dynamic', 'Patty', 'Joe', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'two', 'siblings', 'same', 'band', 'different', 'aspiriations', 'different', 'ideals', 'Look', 'most', 'bands', 'who', 'have', 'siblings', 'take', 'notice', 'how', 'often', 'scenario', 'conflict', 'band', 'turmoil', 'Light', 'Day', 'was', 'great', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'work', 'class', 'bar', 'band', 'apart', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'genre', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'soon', 'lots', 'interviews', 'extras']",N/A

""Light Of Day""'s deliberate pacing and naturalistic perfomances may be a turn-off for those who crave bombast and action. However, viewers with patience will be rewarded. Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett are quite convincing (and touching) as the brother and sister trying to escape thier dreary Midwest blue-collar life by becoming weekend rock stars , and the great Gena Rowlands is fine as the guilt-tripping mother. The late Jason Miller (recognized by most as the young priest in ""The Exorcist"") is good as the ineffectual father. The bar band scenes are quite realistic, and several of the songs are memorable (one penned exclusively for the film by Bruce Springsteen) but once again anyone expecting a rock musical will probably be disappointed by the emphasis on family melodrama instead of the usual backstage antics.",4,Not for everyone,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,941,"['low', 'key', 'entry', 'usually', 'over-the-top', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Hardcore', 'Light', 'Day', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'naturalistic', 'perfomances', 'may', 'be', 'turn-off', 'who', 'crave', 'bombast', 'action', 'However', 'viewers', 'patience', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'are', 'quite', 'convincing', 'touching', 'brother', 'sister', 'trying', 'escape', 'thier', 'dreary', 'Midwest', 'blue-collar', 'life', 'becoming', 'weekend', 'rock', 'stars', 'great', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'fine', 'guilt-tripping', 'mother', 'late', 'Jason', 'Miller', 'recognized', 'most', 'young', 'priest', 'Exorcist', 'good', 'ineffectual', 'father', 'bar', 'band', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'several', 'songs', 'are', 'memorable', 'one', 'penned', 'exclusively', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'once', 'again', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'rock', 'musical', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'emphasis', 'family', 'melodrama', 'instead', 'usual', 'backstage', 'antics']",N/A
