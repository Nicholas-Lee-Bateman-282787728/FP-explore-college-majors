There have been several throughout the years, but E-Ring was definitely in the top 3 along with ""Tour of Duty"" and ""JAG"".A better cast of actors could not have been picked to play in this series.It absolutely amazes me that a show of this calibur, along with the cast didn't make it through the first year, however, they come up with all of the ignorant reality shows and that garbage stays on tv.I guess there is no accounting for taste.I have been waiting for E-Ring to come out on DVD since it stopped airing.A brilliant show!!!",5,Fantastic Military Series!!!!,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,641,"['am', 'retired', 'US', 'Army', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'Military', 'series', 'aired', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'E-Ring', 'was', 'definitely', 'top', '3', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'JAG', '.A', 'better', 'cast', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'play', 'series.It', 'absolutely', 'show', 'calibur', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'year', 'however', 'come', 'up', 'ignorant', 'reality', 'shows', 'garbage', 'tv.I', 'guess', 'accounting', 'taste.I', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'E-Ring', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'stopped', 'airing.A', 'brilliant', 'show']",N/A

Barely half of the original episodes aired. The other half must be vaulted away somewhere! I hope that the producers decide to release this on DVD very soon.

Kadan ""Largeman""","[34, 35]","Unfortunately, more and more excellent shows regarding our nation's fight against world-wide terrorism are being pulled off television by short-sighted network executives. Remember ""The Agency""? This type of programming is not allowed to develop an audience. More than ever before, we need shows like E-Ring to keep our citizens focused on the reality of what is actually happening throughout the world.Here, we were treated to excellent writing and acting each week - the stories were wonderfully executed. Americans could witness the politics and pressures of making minute by minute decisions by the people who work at the Pentagon. As in real life, the decisions were not always the best or the worst - but the decisions were made and the consequences realized. It is my understanding that NBC ordered 22 episodes of E-Ring but only aired 14 shows. Too bad - I hope the complete first season will be released on DVD soon. It will an honor to watch the full 22 shows as originally produced.",5,Focused on reality,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,993,"['Unfortunately', 'more', 'more', 'excellent', 'shows', 'regarding', 'nation', 'fight', 'world-wide', 'terrorism', 'are', 'being', 'pulled', 'off', 'television', 'short-sighted', 'network', 'executives', 'Remember', 'Agency', 'type', 'programming', 'not', 'allowed', 'develop', 'audience', 'More', 'ever', 'need', 'shows', 'E-Ring', 'keep', 'citizens', 'focused', 'reality', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'world.Here', 'were', 'treated', 'excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'week', 'stories', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'executed', 'Americans', 'could', 'witness', 'politics', 'pressures', 'making', 'minute', 'minute', 'decisions', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'Pentagon', 'real', 'life', 'decisions', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'worst', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'consequences', 'realized', 'understanding', 'NBC', 'ordered', '22', 'episodes', 'E-Ring', 'only', 'aired', '14', 'shows', 'Too', 'bad', 'hope', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'soon', 'will', 'honor', 'watch', 'full', '22', 'shows', 'originally', 'produced']",N/A
