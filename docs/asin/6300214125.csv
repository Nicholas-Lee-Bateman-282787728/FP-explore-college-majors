211089,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,6300214125,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[3, 3]","Long before Sandra Day O'Conner (In 1981 President Reagan appointed her to the U.S. Supreme Court) there was a play about the first woman on the Supreme Court.This movie ""First Monday in October"" (1981) chronicles the potential problems of allowing such a radical act to happen. It involves momentum engines and cabals. This is a great supporting cast; try to remember where you saw them before.Justice Dan Snow (Walter Matthau) and Justice Ruth Hagadorn Loomis (Jill Clayburgh) play off each other as they are politically polarized (not necessarily left vs. right) over several subjects. While banding around they come to realize that they have more in common personally than differences. The story shows how they learn from each other and cope with adversity. We have fun in the meantime watching the interaction.Be sure to look for blue birds and cherry blossoms.You may notice that we are also introduced to a large dose of Handle's Water Music. Most Walter Matthau chooses many classical pieces of music for his movies.

This is a woman cast to be in her 40s, and historically this has happened a few times, even in modern times.  Sandra Day Oconner was just about 50 when she was appointed, and the age range for a typical appointee is between about 45 - 60.  Do your homework.Next, to suggest that the Supreme Courst isn't like this shows a lack of real reading into their history.  These ARE people who wheel and deal and change their minds and have personal agendas and political affiliations.  Geez, to be nominated you don't even have to have been a judge!!  So, theoretically this movie isn't too far off the mark.Next, to understand the movie one has to have lived back in that time or read enough about it to understand history. You would understand that the conflict here was REAL, and was repeated not only in courts but throughout the work force and every other aspect of society.  Shall we try to find a Catholic Preist who is a woman?  Oh wait, in their original beliefs a woman is a lesser thing that a man and were not pure like a man is, hence the idea that a priest should be celabate.I like the movie in that the characters are human, just like the Justices are, and it gives a pretty accurate view at how personal views affect decisions they make, and then also has some good comedy in it.

He has a special charm to his acting style.  However, his humor is pretty stifled here.  Also the he vs she plot just seems a bit too tiresome here.  Matheau argues for the sake of arguing and that is never too pleasant.Jill Clayburgh is mis-cast as the first woman Supreme Court Justice.  She is way too young for such a role and that hampers the film from the get go.The pornographic subplot also is addressed in such a boring way.  The general plot does not excite me in anyway.  I tried viewing this a second time to give it the benefit of the doubt.

211103,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6300214125,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","As I look back on the long career of Walter Matthau, for me this will always be my favorite performance of the man. I've enjoyed so many of his films, too many to recount without sounding like a laundry list. Suffice to say - he was an extraordinary actor with an ability to play a full spectrum of types and styles. To this day whenever I picture a war hawk with a frightening ability to coldly calculate human suffering - his character in 'Fail-Safe' is the person I draft in my mind's eye. And whenever I imagine an uncompromising curmudgeon with a sarcastic edge - who else?Prescience minded and predating the nomination of the first female to the court, Sandra Day O'Connor, by nearly a year comes 'First Monday'.In this wonderful film, which ironically helped me in a history/civics class that I was avoiding in order to watch this very movie, we're introduced to the nine justices of The Supreme Court. It's a difficult time for the court as they face the loss of one of their own, an associate justice has recently passed. And most affected - prickly liberal justice The Honorable Daniel Snow.And as he contemplates the future nominee, it's announced that the president has chosen a woman. Despite his reservations, he's pleased; humorously, as if his approval were somehow relevant to the proceedings. Then, just as quickly, his anticipated joy at a female joining the 'brothers' is snatched away.He unhappily learns that it's not just any female judge being nominated. No. It's the one nominee in the entire country that Justice Snow has fomented a deep and abiding dislike toward. Californian conservative, The Honorable Ruth Loomis of The 9th Circuit. (can you believe there was ever a time when California was considered 'conservative' - ha!) And while he has a profound respect for her ability and legal acumen, he fears her positions on a wide range of issues, knowing that her decisions will likely change the balance of the court. And anything, I do mean anything, not to Judge Snow's liking - well, then that's just not acceptable.The combative relationship and crackling energy between Jill Clayburgh, playing Justice Loomis, and Matthau's character is one that wonderfully defines a dramatic battle of equals. And yet somehow, simultaneously and incredibly, manages to dance itself toward a romantic comedy.An outstanding film that always, always, brings laughter. More so since it's a situation that I can readily relate to - having a sharp, competent and funny woman for a business partner.",5,The D.C.

What is most important is this film makes you understand that there are two sides to each question and both need to be heard to understand the question.DVD EXTRAS: None",4,Matthau is Supreme,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,1135,"['First', 'Monday', 'October', 'refers', 'first', 'day', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'session', 'year', 'Broadway', 'starred', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Martha', 'Scott', 'Ms.', 'Scott', 'produced', 'film', 'version.This', 'appointment', 'first', 'woman', 'Supreme', 'Court.Associate', 'Justice', 'Daniel', 'Snow', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'liberal', 'judge', 'When', 'associate', 'justice', 'dies', 'President', 'woman', 'When', 'AJ', 'Snow', 'out', 'woman', 'excited', 'out', 'Ruth', 'Loomis', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Orange', 'County', 'play', 'movie', 'ideas', 'extremes', 'Very', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'time', 'pornography', 'big', 'business', 'were', 'chosen', 'questions', 'are', 'simple', 'answers', 'are', 'complex', 'film', 'listen', 'enjoy', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'make', 'think.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'times', 'preachy', 'end', 'wrong', 'turn', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'What', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'understand', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'question', 'need', 'be', 'heard', 'understand', 'question.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

This is a lightweight comedy-drama. There is some great verbal sparring between the two and you expect the movie to put them in situations that can take advantage of it but unfortunately the plot is not up to the standard of the actors.Clayburgh plays the first woman to be appointed to the US Supreme Court. Mathhau is one of the current Justices, a crusty veteran who doesn't get along with anyone else. The plot calls for Clayburgh to beconservative and Matthau a liberal. This helps get the verbal sparring going early.Unfortunately the plot starts to bog down and is a disappointment after the initial promise shown. The writers create some sexual tension between the two as Clayburgh and Matthau's characters get to know each other and understand where the other is coming from, each develops a deeper appreciation of the other while still disagreeing with the other's viewpoint. Unfortunately this tension is never released as nothing ever happens between the two.The plot really starts to sag when we find out that Clayburgh's ex-husband's company is implicated in a case that casts aspersions on Clayburgh's professional ethics. There are some elements of the real-life Whitewater case so perhaps the writers ran out of ideas and borrowed from the headlines in the newspaper. In any case this subplot is very uninteresting and the movie ends leaving you feeling it could have been so much better.Still, its a movie worth watching if only for the first half.

So sad that the serious subject of in-fighting among the Supreme Court Justices was reduced to a sitcom-like depth.Neither character seemed to truly represent a mindset (liberal or conservative), but rather, they seemed to argue for no apparent reason. Perhaps some scenes setting up their conflict were deleted?Regardless, while Matthau is enjoyable to watch, no matter what the script, this was one of his weakest. There are even moments when the viewer has to stop the movie and go...""hey, wait a minute!""...as when the Justices enter the Smithsonian in pouring rain, and come out minutes later to snow, and plowed sidewalks!!!As for the DVD...it was also extremely weak. It contains no extras (not even a trailer). Some background on the Supreme Court would have been excellent. But then, I guess that would be assuming that this movie was meant to be thought-provoking, which it obviously isn't.The widescreen transfer is fine. The picture is reasonably sharp, and it isn't hampered by grain.
