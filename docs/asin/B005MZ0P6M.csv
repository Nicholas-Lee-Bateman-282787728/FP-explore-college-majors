The entire cast not only Jung Il Woo, were exceptional at protraying grief, disblief, compassion, remorse and a host of other emotions.  I loved every moment of this movie.  Once you start watching, you will not be able to stop until you get to the last DVD.  Jung Il Woo, does it with his eyes. The way he looks at the other cast of characters when he's delivering his parts, really says it all.  The music was really nice for this DVD also. The English translations are very good, and you do get some behind the scenes with this DVD, which was a nice touch.

1495009,A2J07VR1GYX2XF,B005MZ0P6M,L,"[3, 3]","I am cautious watching straight up melodramas these days because I've seen a lot of them... How many times can you go over the same typical plot and still manage to surprise? Well they finally presented something new in 49 Days with a twist of fantasy. It is unique where the main character gets into an accident and is given 49 days to borrow someone else's body. She needs to find three people who truly loved her so she can continue living. There are tons of sad moments that make you think about life, friends, family, and remind you to appreciate the time you have. All of the characters are excellent and there are no overly-pretentious, contrived plot lines (except maybe with the father). The soundtrack is awesome...many different ballads in here unlike some series that recycle the same 1-2 songs over and over. Jo Hyun Jae also sings one of the songs and he did a great job. I was surprised he could sing that well.

Yi-Gyung is an orphan whose boyfriend died in a car accident some years ago right after they had a big fight. On the anniversary of her boyfriend's death, Yi-Gyung tries to commit suicide by running into the highway traffic but her psychiatrist who was following her saves her. However that leads to a massive pileup on the highway and Ji-Hyun who was passing by gets seriously injured and goes into coma.Ji-Hyun pleads her case to the grim reaper Yi-Soo and he lets Ji-Hyun take over Yi-Gyung's body while she sleeps, and then gives her 49 days to collect real tears from 3 people outside the family members. If she succeeds she can live but she cannot reveal to anybody that it is her in Yi-Gyung's body, otherwise she dies immediately.However when Ji-Hyun turned to her fianc&eacute; Min-Ho and her best friend In-Jung, she finds out that they are secret lovers and Min-Ho's marrying Ji-Hyun was just a part of their scheme to steal her father's business and wealth. Also she learns not many people were fond of her - even though she always really meant well, people were envious of her family wealth and her naivety often put others in awkward situations.Devastated and helpless, Ji-Hyun ends up with an old high-school classmate Gang, who has been a secret admirer of Ji-Hyun all along. Reluctant at first, Gang starts noticing Ji-Hyun's behavior in Yi-Gyung. Meanwhile as she spends time as Yi-Gyung, Ji-Hyun learns about her past, and Yi-Gyung becomes aware of Ji-Hyun's presence as well. In the race against the time as Ji-Hyun tries to thwart Min-Ho and In-Jung's scheme, save her family and herself with help from Gang, Yi-Gyung and Yi-Soo, Ji-Hyun discovers unexpected ties that connect everybody and everything that has happened to her.This is a wonderful, rare drama that should appeal to many beyond regular TV drama audience. It strikes the right balance of many things: It is a fantasy but never outrageous. It is serious but not depressing. There is comic relief but not stupid. There is no cartoon-like villain. Even the bad guys have their reasons and are tormented by their own demons. It has a lot of twists and turns but seldom feels contrived, and it does not settle with a Disney-like easy conclusion. But the best of all, the drama is about giving, helping others, making sacrifices for others, without being preaching. There is some very good music to boot.",5,49 Days to Change Everything,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,2460,"['Ji-Hyun', 'happy-go-lucky', 'girl', 'wealthy', 'family', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'engaged', 'Yi-Gyung', 'orphan', 'boyfriend', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'years', 'ago', 'right', 'had', 'big', 'fight', 'anniversary', 'boyfriend', 'death', 'Yi-Gyung', 'commit', 'suicide', 'running', 'highway', 'traffic', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'was', 'following', 'saves', 'However', 'massive', 'pileup', 'highway', 'Ji-Hyun', 'who', 'was', 'passing', 'seriously', 'injured', 'coma.Ji-Hyun', 'pleads', 'case', 'grim', 'reaper', 'Yi-Soo', 'Ji-Hyun', 'take', 'Yi-Gyung', 'body', 'then', '49', 'days', 'collect', 'real', 'tears', '3', 'people', 'family', 'members', 'can', 'live', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'anybody', 'Yi-Gyung', 'body', 'otherwise', 'immediately.However', 'when', 'Ji-Hyun', 'turned', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Min-Ho', 'best', 'friend', 'In-Jung', 'out', 'are', 'secret', 'lovers', 'Min-Ho', 'marrying', 'Ji-Hyun', 'was', 'just', 'part', 'scheme', 'steal', 'father', 'business', 'wealth', 'Also', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'fond', 'even', 'always', 'really', 'meant', 'well', 'people', 'were', 'envious', 'family', 'wealth', 'naivety', 'often', 'put', 'others', 'awkward', 'situations.Devastated', 'helpless', 'Ji-Hyun', 'up', 'old', 'high-school', 'classmate', 'Gang', 'who', 'been', 'secret', 'admirer', 'Ji-Hyun', 'along', 'Reluctant', 'first', 'Gang', 'noticing', 'Ji-Hyun', 'behavior', 'Yi-Gyung', 'Meanwhile', 'time', 'Yi-Gyung', 'Ji-Hyun', 'past', 'Yi-Gyung', 'becomes', 'aware', 'Ji-Hyun', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'race', 'time', 'Ji-Hyun', 'tries', 'thwart', 'Min-Ho', 'In-Jung', 'scheme', 'save', 'family', 'help', 'Gang', 'Yi-Gyung', 'Yi-Soo', 'Ji-Hyun', 'discovers', 'unexpected', 'ties', 'connect', 'everybody', 'everything', 'happened', 'her.This', 'wonderful', 'rare', 'drama', 'should', 'appeal', 'many', 'regular', 'TV', 'drama', 'audience', 'right', 'balance', 'many', 'things', 'fantasy', 'never', 'outrageous', 'serious', 'not', 'depressing', 'comic', 'relief', 'not', 'stupid', 'cartoon-like', 'villain', 'Even', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'reasons', 'are', 'tormented', 'own', 'demons', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'seldom', 'feels', 'contrived', 'not', 'settle', 'Disney-like', 'easy', 'conclusion', 'best', 'drama', 'giving', 'helping', 'others', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'others', 'being', 'preaching', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'boot']",N/A

1495013,A57UZXTQU9DJE,B005MZ0P6M,Supernatural Rocks,"[4, 4]","I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Korean Drama.  First, let me warn you - you will need a box or two of tissue nearby.  Yes, there are funny, lighthearted moments but you WILL shed tears.Ji-Hyun has the perfect life or so it seems.  She comes from a loving wealthy family, her friends adore her, and she is days away from marrying the perfect man. On the other side of town, Yi-Kyung is a woman who cannot recover from the death of her boyfriend.  Suicide is constantly on her mind.  She works the night shift at a convenient store, while sleeping in the afternoons.On a fateful day, Yi-Kyung gets off a bus and attempts to kill herself by walking into oncoming traffic, resulting in a massive car pile-up. However, before the bus can strike her, somebody saves her life by pulling her back. At this moment, Ji-Hyun, who is driving nearby, fails to hit her brakes in time and collides into a semi truck that is stopped in the middle of the road. Ji-Hyun walks out of her car in a daze and is shocked to see her body being carted into an ambulance. The only person who seems to notice her standing in the road is a young man on a motorcycle known as the Scheduler (aka the Grim Reaper). Ji-Hyun follows her body to the hospital where she now lays in a coma. Ji-Hyun meets the Scheduler again who informs her that since it was not her scheduled time to die, she is given the opportunity to recover from her vegetative state and live. That is, if she succeeds in her mission: she must gather three genuine teardrops from three people who truly love her (apart from her family) within the next 49 days. Instantly, she thinks of her fiance and two best friends and is certain she will live again. Ji-Hyun takes over the body of the suicidal Yi-Kyung in her quest to find three geniune tears. However, she soon discovers that what looks storybook perfect isn't always true.I loved the Scheduler played by Jung Il Woo.  He was outstanding!  The interaction he had with Ji-Hyun (like getting annoyed with her for always pestering him) was hilarious and sincere. I also loved Han Kang (Ji-Hyun's friend from high school).  He was so distant and cold but you knew deep down he cared for her.  You wanted to protect Ji-Hyun because she was so trusting and truly a kind-hearted person.  And Yi-Kyung, you just wanted her to recover from her anguish over the loss of her boyfriend.  The other actors in this K-Drama were excellent.  There is loyality, lots of betrayal, and surprises in this series. I definitely will be watching this DVD set again.  But like I mentioned before, be prepared to weep.  You will be emotionally exhausted after each episode.",5,Grab a box of tissue!
