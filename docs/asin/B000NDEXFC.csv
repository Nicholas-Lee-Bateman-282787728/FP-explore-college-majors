Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[0, 1]","Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert HallSince I listened the music for the first time I loved it. First I bought the CD a few years ago and recently decided to buy a DVD, had to chose for the 10th or 25th Anniversary. I picked the end of the first act, where all the characters participated and watched it in YouTube, I selected the 10th because I liked the singers who played Cossete,Marius and Eponine more.After I ordered the 10th I had the opportunity to see the 25th and I also liked this one.It is difficult for me to decide which the best is, I said before I like more those three characters and the story was more explicit very dramatic for instance the scene of the barricades as well as others.I liked more the singers playing Javert and Fantine in the 25th Anniversary, also the characters of Eponine in the 10th was the same as Fantine in the 25th and she is very good.The end of the show was very emotional when some of the actors who played Vajean around the world sang.This is one of my favorite musical and it captures the story of Victor Hugo masterpiece very well.",5,A dramatic performance.,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1130,"['Les', 'Miserables', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'Concert', 'London', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'HallSince', 'listened', 'music', 'first', 'time', 'loved', 'First', 'bought', 'CD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'recently', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'had', 'chose', '10th', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'picked', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'where', 'characters', 'participated', 'watched', 'YouTube', 'selected', '10th', 'liked', 'singers', 'who', 'played', 'Cossete', 'Marius', 'Eponine', 'more.After', 'ordered', '10th', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', '25th', 'also', 'liked', 'one.It', 'difficult', 'decide', 'best', 'said', 'like', 'more', 'three', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'explicit', 'very', 'dramatic', 'instance', 'scene', 'barricades', 'as', 'well', 'others.I', 'liked', 'more', 'singers', 'playing', 'Javert', 'Fantine', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'also', 'characters', 'Eponine', '10th', 'was', 'same', 'Fantine', '25th', 'very', 'good.The', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'when', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Vajean', 'world', 'sang.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'musical', 'story', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'well']",Les Miserables in Concert: The Dream Cast

The quality on my Blu Ray was fantastic. the sound was supurb. it even played as if it were blu ray, FULL screen. i was suprised to say the least. what i thought i was buying and why i give this less then five stars is that the player were STATIC. standing still in front of a mic and singing, not acting the parts like what i saw in San Francisco all thos years ago. I was bored of it before the bishop was through telling ValJean that he bought his soul for God with the silver he had stollenI don't mind the bits and pieces that were missing.

1056164,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000NDEXFC,David Bower,"[1, 1]","I'm one of the many who appreciate this work; I had the good fortune to see it in person when it was on tour and found that to be a memorable experience. I bought a Laser Disc widescreen version of the 1995 10th Anniversary Performance which I still have and continue to enjoy. I do not have the DVD referenced here so I will confine my comments to the performance with one exception.Having read some of the other reviews I was interested in the references to omissions and deletions in the DVD; this prompted me to compare run times and I found the DVD had a run time of 148 minutes while the Laser Disc version had a run time of 160 minutes. I have not found any references to the VHS tapes run time.The performance elevates this review to an entirely different level; this performance is powerful, disturbing, emotional, and at times, even funny. There are many moments of beauty and drama, and then there is the show-stopping scene, ""Master of the House"" featuring Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway that leaves one laughing and applauding.This performance is anchored by Colm Wilkinson's forceful characterization of Jean Valjean. The other leads are also convincingly performed by Philip Quast as Javert, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Lea Salonga as Eponine, Michael Ball as Marius, and Michael Maguire as Enjolras. I did not personally observe and real weaknesses that would distract from the overall production.It was effective the way the performers did not drop out of character during applause; the missing scenery does not really distract from the drama and the strong emotional impact of this production.After watching this performance my wife and I find ourselves haunted by the beautiful melodies for days afterward; we have to limit our exposure to this work simply because it is so powerful!I would love to have the complete stage presentation on video but it does not appear that will happen anytime soon.

1056171,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000NDEXFC,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[2, 3]","When Victor Hugo wrote Les Miserables [The Wretched, The Poor ones, The Victims] little did he realize he was writing a timeless work, translated into every language, made into movies and a theatre production that has played with a consistently sold out audience.Victor Hugo, born on February 26th, 1802, died on May 22nd, 1885, lived for 83 years; for the most part, dedicated to writing poetry, novels and essays. Among many of his works, Les contemplations [contemplations] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are well known and have also been made into movies. Victor Hugo's childhood was lived through tumultuous events; the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the French Revolution, the rise and fall of the First Republic and the rise of the First French Empire and dictatorship under Napoleon Bonaparte.Victor Hugo conceived the idea of writing a novel about social injustice but it took him over 17 years to complete Les Miserables; a 1200 page book about the struggle of an ex-convict Jean Valjean as he attempts to redeem the sins of the past. The book is magnificent for it transcends time, making generations of readers identify with the characters and their plea. The play brings to life the social injustice lived by many in France and the songs are written with such depth of understanding of human behavior that as we sit to listen and watch this musical, we can not help it but be captivated by the performance.At first, we thought we were getting the whole play, only to realize that we had all the songs in the sequence of the play and a finale that is breathtaking, for they bring those that interpret Jean Valjean's from all over the world and they unite to sing, each in their native language the famous closing song that calls for a crying rally as it asks ""do you hear the people sing lost in the valley of the night? It is the music of the people who are climbing to the light. For the wretched of the earth, there is a fame that never dies even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. They will live again freedom in the garden of the Lord, they will walk behind the ploughshare; they will put away the sword, the chain will be broken and all men will have their reward. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade, is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? Is it the future that they bring when tomorrow comes!""The cast is the original London Company: Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Michael Ball as Marius, Philip Quast as Javert, Judy Kuhn as Cosette and Ruthie Henshall as Fantine.Depending on the mood of the day, these songs can make you cry, like ""I dreamed a dream"" and ""Empty Chairs at empty tables."" We recently had a death in the family and these words simply overwhelmed us when we heard: ""there is a grief that can't be spoken, there is a pain goes on and on, empty chairs at empty tables, now my friends are dead and gone.""Therefore, if you enjoy this timeless classic, this DVD is for you. Our favorite feature is the lyrics can be played as subtitles that allowed us to sing along.

I gave it only 4 Stars out of 5 for weaknesses in the DVD, released in 2008, for reasons that I shall describe later.  The production design and lighting were awe inspiring and the musical forces brought to bear by the London Symphony Orchestra and a huge chorus were worthy of a performance of a Mahler Symphony.  Colm Wilkinson, as Valjean, was brilliant.  Although already 51 at the time this performance was filmed he was nevertheless wonderful, particularly during the difficult high pitched mezza voce passages of his solos.  Others were equal to Wilkinson, though.  Alun Armstrong, as the crooked innkeeper, was a comic wonder, as was Jenny Galloway as his equally funny wife.  I also loved  the young and beautiful Ruthie Henshall, as Fantine.  She has a gorgeous mezzo voice, which she used to perfection here.  Also noteworthy were the also young and beautiful Lea Salonga, as  Eponine, Michael Ball, as Marius, and Judy Kuhn, as Colette.  All had both the musical and dramatic skill to to showcase this classic musical theater piece.Now comes the hard part.  Despite this performance having, apparently, been filmed in widescreen format, the disc's producers, for reasons I simply cannot understand, failed to give us a Blu-ray version although, by the time this disc was released in 2008,  Blu-ray was starting to take hold.  Equally disappointing was the two channel soundtrack.  This classic performance of a classic show warranted a remixing of the soundtrack to 5.1 channels.  Had the show been less outstanding than it was, either visually or sonically, I would not have been as disappointed as I am.  As it is, though, I anguish over what a wasted opportunity it turned out to be.  In my estimation, this aspect of the disc, alas, deserves only 1 Star out of 5.  For that reason, I won't be buying it but if a Blu-ray version with a 5.1 HD audio soundtrack is ever produced I'll be first in line.",4,A brilliant performance by an all star cast of a great show,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2004,"['could', 'not', 'give', 'higher', 'marks', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'production', 'great', 'old', 'show', 'gave', 'only', '4', 'Stars', '5', 'weaknesses', 'DVD', 'released', '2008', 'reasons', 'shall', 'describe', 'later', 'production', 'design', 'lighting', 'were', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'musical', 'forces', 'brought', 'bear', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'huge', 'chorus', 'were', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Mahler', 'Symphony', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Valjean', 'was', 'brilliant', 'already', '51', 'time', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'wonderful', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'high', 'pitched', 'mezza', 'voce', 'passages', 'solos', 'Others', 'were', 'equal', 'Wilkinson', 'though', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'crooked', 'innkeeper', 'was', 'comic', 'wonder', 'was', 'Jenny', 'Galloway', 'equally', 'funny', 'wife', 'also', 'loved', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Ruthie', 'Henshall', 'Fantine', 'gorgeous', 'mezzo', 'voice', 'used', 'perfection', 'here', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'were', 'also', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'Eponine', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'Marius', 'Judy', 'Kuhn', 'Colette', 'had', 'musical', 'dramatic', 'skill', 'showcase', 'classic', 'musical', 'theater', 'piece.Now', 'hard', 'part', 'performance', 'having', 'apparently', 'been', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'format', 'disc', 'producers', 'reasons', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'failed', 'give', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'time', 'disc', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'starting', 'take', 'hold', 'Equally', 'disappointing', 'was', 'two', 'channel', 'soundtrack', 'classic', 'performance', 'classic', 'show', 'warranted', 'remixing', 'soundtrack', '5.1', 'channels', 'Had', 'show', 'been', 'less', 'outstanding', 'was', 'visually', 'sonically', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'disappointed', 'am', 'anguish', 'what', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'estimation', 'aspect', 'disc', 'alas', 'only', '1', 'Star', '5', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '5.1', 'HD', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'ever', 'produced', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'line']",Les Miserables in Concert: The Dream Cast

We were in the mezzanine, too far away see facial expressions and it was before they had individual mikes.  So, I left thinking, &#34;what's the big deal?&#34;  Since then, I've been listening to the recording and have learned the story.  When the 25th Anniversary concert came out on PBS, I recalled seeing this 10th Anniversary concert on PBS and liking it better.  So I bought it.  Now that I've seen this production, I am absolutely enthralled with Les Mis.

Not a musical like ""Chicago"" where the songs can't be heard for long, but something close to the quality of the music of ""Moulin Rouge"" where you would go buy the soundtrack afterwards. The songs and music were breath taking.The story is also wonderful and sad too. The American guy sitting next to me was in tears since the play started.

When it came out on DVD (it was one DVD at the time with two sides), I bought that as well.  I loved that, mainly because the sounds was a lot better than the VHS.  The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that there were no extras on it.  I then found this version and was ecstatic because I found out that it had the ""Stage by Stage: The Making of Les Miserables.""  I had never seen this before but had heard about it.  It's great and really makes this DVD worth buying.  This 2 disc DVD comes with a booklet as well (mainly containing pictures of the 10th Anniversary Concert & the summary of the show).I also love the fact that the entire show is on one DVD; you don't have to get up and turn the DVD over after act I is finished.  Definitely a plus for me.  And of course there's the cast.  They really chose the best people who had been in the show before to play all the roles.  Colm Wilkinson is the *best* Jean Valjean I have ever seen (and heard).  Phillip Quast is magnificent as Javert.  I remember having heard him on the complete symphonic recording.  Lea Solonga and Ruthie Henshall only made this concert even better.  Their voices are beautiful.  And of course having Michael Ball reprise his role as Marius was perfect.

1056181,A3ELM7ZAEST3J0,B000NDEXFC,"Michael, Matthew and Mark's mom","[9, 10]","I am so glad I bought this DVD before buying the 25th anniversary concert - it is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better!  I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but I think the picture and sound are fine.  I bought this about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released.  I purchased this concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me.  Also, the end of the performance with many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing ""Do you hear the people sing"" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving.  The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast (with the possible exception of Ruthie Henshall as Fantine - she was very good but I did miss Patti Lupone who I think was an amazing Fantine in London and on Broadway).  However, that small nitpick aside, the cast is just stand-out after stand-out.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of ""Master of the House"" is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience.  Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board.  I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must.  It is a joy to watch and makes me happy and inspired every time I watch it and I really believe others will feel the same way!",5,Buy this DVD rather than the 25th Anniversary Concert!,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,2027,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'buying', '25th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'infinitely', 'better', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'quality', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'think', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'fine', 'bought', 'two', 'months', 'when', 'saw', '25th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'purchased', 'concert', 'saw', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'was', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'had', 'seen', 'live', 'musical', 'London', '1991', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'definitive', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Also', 'end', 'performance', 'many', 'different', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'different', 'countries', 'world', 'joining', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'stage', 'sing', 'Do', 'hear', 'people', 'sing', 'together', 'lines', 'native', 'languages', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'really', 'dream', 'cast', 'possible', 'exception', 'Ruthie', 'Henshall', 'Fantine', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'did', 'miss', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'amazing', 'Fantine', 'London', 'Broadway', 'However', 'small', 'nitpick', 'aside', 'cast', 'just', 'stand-out', 'stand-out', 'Particularly', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Phillip', 'Quast', 'Javert', 'absolute', 'delight', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Thenardier', 'rendition', 'Master', 'House', 'truly', 'joyful', 'experience', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'who', 'true', 'fan', 'musical', 'entire', 'stage', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'behind', 'Alun', 'song', 'are', 'visibly', 'delighted', 'enjoying', 'rendition', 'song', 'as', 'much', 'audience', 'Conversely', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'concert', 'true', 'disappointment', 'cast', 'just', 'not', 'strong', 'way', 'board', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'live', 'musical', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'London', 'twice', 'Broadway', ""'re"", 'are', 'just', 'true', 'fan', 'musical', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'dream', 'cast', 'concert', 'must', 'joy', 'watch', 'happy', 'inspired', 'time', 'watch', 'really', 'believe', 'others', 'will', 'feel', 'same', 'way']",Les Miserables in Concert: The Dream Cast

It opened at London's Barbican Theatre on October 8, 1985 for a limited season but found a home at the Palace Theatre on December 4, 1985 and on April 3, 2004 transferred to the Queen's Theatre just down the road and is still playing today.  It opened on Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on May 12, 1987 and ran until May 18, 2003 for 6680 performances.This show launched many West End and Broadway careers.  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of its West End opening, producer Cameron Macintosh gathered cast members from London, New York and Austrailia to perform the show in concert at the Royal Albert Hall.This production was overpoduced like all of Cameron's shows but for a concert performance it was perfect.  London and Broadway's Colm Wilkinson leads the cast as Jean Valjean. London favorite Michael Ball, Austialia's Philip Quast and Broadway favorite Judy Kuhn join the show with Miss Saigon star Lea Solanga rounding out the cast.The encore has 17 different Valjeans together to sing ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" in each performer's native language.For fans of the show, this will probably be the only filmed version of the show, unless Rob Marshall gets the itch to direct a movie of the show.The only thing that at a $35 list price, it is way too expensive.

It arrived today and my wife and I disconected the phones and prepared to watch on our new 1080p with a Blu-Ray player. The DVD is very grainy a lot of the time, like looking through a screen, much of the time there are ghosts around the actors. It appears to be simply a copy of the VHS with no enhancement. It has been edited, for instance Gavroche's song exposing Javert to the students has been shortened, the entire part between the end of the concert and the entrance of the international Jean Valjeans has been cut. (It may be on the second disc, but if it is then the ""additional material"" is misleading) In this day of digital enhancement there is no excuse for this poor quality, my old VHS is superior. The sound track is not enhanced at all. I will only hope someone will eventually offer a real quality DVD of this great, great event.Post Script to my original review: I just rented the 1996 version DVD from netflix and it is superb, all of the criticisms I made of the 2008 DVD are much better on this version.

The reason I bought this copy was because it was in widescreen format, and I hoped it would offer a better viewing experience - to make you feel more like you were there. It accomplishes this nicely! Unfortunately, there is an error in the video transfer and a small section of singing is omitted. In the section where Gavroche (the little boy) exposes Javert as a spy, and sing's ""Little People"" - the part of the song where he sings, ""Good evening Inspector, lovely evening my dear...his name's Inspector Javert"" this whole section has been left out - and it is quite obvious! I thought maybe it was a defect on my copy but I have seen another copy and this same error is present. Maybe I'm too picky, but I expect perfection when it comes to my DVD's, and this is just too careless a mistake on the publisher's part.",3,Small but annoying mistake!,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,964,"['absolutely', 'love', 'concert', 'wonderful', 'music', 'very', 'best', 'singers', 'own', 'original', 'DVD', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'reason', 'bought', 'copy', 'was', 'was', 'widescreen', 'format', 'hoped', 'would', 'offer', 'better', 'viewing', 'experience', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'were', 'there', 'nicely', 'Unfortunately', 'error', 'video', 'transfer', 'small', 'section', 'singing', 'omitted', 'section', 'where', 'Gavroche', 'little', 'boy', 'Javert', 'spy', 'sing', 'Little', 'People', 'part', 'song', 'where', 'Good', 'evening', 'Inspector', 'lovely', 'evening', 'dear', 'name', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'whole', 'section', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'quite', 'obvious', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'defect', 'copy', 'have', 'seen', 'copy', 'same', 'error', 'present', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'picky', 'expect', 'perfection', 'when', 'DVD', 'just', 'too', 'careless', 'mistake', 'publisher', 'part']",Les Miserables in Concert: The Dream Cast
