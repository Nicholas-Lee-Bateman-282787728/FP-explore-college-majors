Though it was already turning into the goofy Dr Smith and robot show, there was still a sense of purpose to the characters and the mission. With season 2 it was out the window, and every week it was Smith, Will and the robot, meeting up with outlandish aliens and who cared. I hated the direction, and have never quite forgiven it.But I did sit through every episode recently out of curiosity. While I still think it lost it's way in more ways than one, I came to absolutely love Jonathan Harris, especially when he's tormenting the robot. Not only are the insults endlessly creative, I found it even funnier when he just casually called him booby or ninny. I found myself waiting for Smith and robot scenes, so I guess they knew what they were doing after all. Still a ridiculous show, but you gotta appreciate laughs where you can find them.",4,it's never too late to learn,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,961,"['was', 'junior', 'high', 'when', 'Lost', 'Space', 'first', 'aired', 'loved', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'really', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'already', 'turning', 'goofy', 'Dr', 'Smith', 'robot', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'sense', 'purpose', 'characters', 'mission', 'season', '2', 'was', 'out', 'window', 'week', 'was', 'Smith', 'Will', 'robot', 'meeting', 'up', 'outlandish', 'aliens', 'who', 'cared', 'hated', 'direction', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'forgiven', 'it.But', 'did', 'sit', 'episode', 'recently', 'curiosity', 'still', 'think', 'lost', 'way', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'came', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'especially', 'when', 'tormenting', 'robot', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'insults', 'endlessly', 'creative', 'found', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'just', 'casually', 'called', 'booby', 'ninny', 'found', 'waiting', 'Smith', 'robot', 'scenes', 'guess', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Still', 'ridiculous', 'show', 'got', 'ta', 'appreciate', 'where', 'can', 'find']",Lost in Space - Seasons 1 - 3

I grew up loving Science Fiction and have watched many of the series and movies.  Lost in Space was one of the first series I watched.  The special effects where great for the time but low by todays standards,  but this is a 1960s era show.  the first epasodes, are of course, in black and white, and that is ok too.  I didn't buy the series to pick it apart, I bought it to relive the adventure.  So if your quite a bit younger than me and expecting great special effects, forget it.  enjoy the story line, and the way movies used to be made.  It's just like I remember it, and I highly recommend this product.  The concept of taking TV series and turning them into DVDs is a wonderful idea.

1145164,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B00144P9RA,Casey62,"[2, 2]","The 1960's was the best decade for T.V. because of the sheer variety of the types of shows that were on. When it came to science fiction, prolific producer Irwin Allen led the way with four series - VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL, and LAND OF THE GIANTS. All boasted high production values, were extremely successful, and continue to generate fans to this day.LOST IN SPACE (1965-'68), was the most light hearted of Allen's quartet, and dealt with the adventures of the Robinson family who, because of sabotage to their spaceship on its maiden voyage, are hurled off course into the void of outer space. It started fairly serious in its first black and white season, but changed to pure camp by the second, which employed some of the finest Technicolor photography of any show at the time. As wacky as it sometimes got, LOST IN SPACE always had heart, and many of the episodes - including some of the campier ones - are genuinely poignant. This brand of special charm was something television could pull off at that time due to the abundance of talent, ingenuity, and wit that existed in the medium throughout the 60's.20th Century Fox's DVD set of all three seasons of LOST IN SPACE is a must own for every lover of classic, T.V. science fiction. The transfers aren't up to the level of Fox's LAND OF THE GIANTS set, but they're still pretty nice, and the color episodes retain their vibrance.Extras include video and audio interviews with cast members, original episode previews, stills gallery and the unaired pilot, ""No Place To Hide"".An all-time favorite that I highly recommend.",5,CLASSIC 60'S SCI-FI FUN,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,1617,"['1960', 'was', 'best', 'decade', 'T.V', 'sheer', 'variety', 'types', 'shows', 'were', 'When', 'came', 'science', 'fiction', 'prolific', 'producer', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'led', 'way', 'four', 'series', 'VOYAGE', 'THE', 'BOTTOM', 'THE', 'SEA', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'THE', 'TIME', 'TUNNEL', 'LAND', 'OF', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'All', 'boasted', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'extremely', 'successful', 'continue', 'generate', 'fans', 'day.LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', ""1965-'68"", 'was', 'most', 'light', 'hearted', 'Allen', 'quartet', 'dealt', 'adventures', 'Robinson', 'family', 'who', 'sabotage', 'spaceship', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'are', 'hurled', 'off', 'course', 'void', 'outer', 'space', 'started', 'fairly', 'serious', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'season', 'changed', 'pure', 'camp', 'second', 'employed', 'finest', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'show', 'time', 'As', 'wacky', 'got', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'always', 'had', 'heart', 'many', 'episodes', 'including', 'campier', 'ones', 'are', 'genuinely', 'poignant', 'brand', 'special', 'charm', 'was', 'something', 'television', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'time', 'due', 'abundance', 'talent', 'ingenuity', 'wit', 'existed', 'medium', ""60's.20th"", 'Century', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'set', 'three', 'seasons', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'must', 'own', 'lover', 'classic', 'T.V', 'science', 'fiction', 'transfers', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'level', 'Fox', 'LAND', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'set', ""'re"", 'still', 'pretty', 'nice', 'color', 'retain', 'vibrance.Extras', 'include', 'video', 'audio', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'original', 'episode', 'previews', 'stills', 'gallery', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'No', 'Place', 'Hide', '.An', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'highly', 'recommend']",Lost in Space - Seasons 1 - 3
1145165,A1GPGPOA8ME38W,B00144P9RA,"Cecil Elliott, Jr.","[28, 29]","Irwin Allen was known as The Master of Disaster for his movies such as The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno and Earthquake. He was known for some good television series as well.Probably his best, was Lost in Space. The series Lost in Space,was a space age version of The Swiss Family Robinson! The series appealed across all age ranges. During its original casting, Mr. Allen asked NASA for technical advice. He wanted to make the series as realistic as possible. When he did not receive the reviews he was looking for, Mr. Allen changed the premise of the series. During the original casting, the ship was named Gemini 12. When he didn't receive the advice from NASA, the ship's name was changed to Jupiter II, giving the ship its identity. The technical advice Mr. Allen was looking for, came from other sources, especially from Cal Tech. During the original casting, Lost in Space was to be a true adventure series. There was no Robot and no Dr. Smith. The unaired pilot, was not too well received. During its recasting, CBS made the suggestions of including the Robot and the character of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Lost in Space was true adventure series. The first five episodes during the first season, are classic. During the first season, the Robinson family had to deal with such issues as finding drinkable water, making sure there was sufficient food to sustain them, finding fuel for the Jupiter II and dealing with alien visitors. Everyone who watched the series, wanted to see if the Jupiter II would go into space again. During the second season, the first episode ""Blast Off into Space"" is a classic. The drama of this episode was the break-up of their planet as the Jupiter II was lifting off into space. There were some good episodes during the second season. Some were light hearted. There were a few serious episodes as well. During the third season, the episodes were a mix between being light hearted and serious. There were a few good episodes during the third season. The first was ""A Visit to a Hostile Planet"" when the Jupiter II breaks the time barrier and returns home to 1947 Earth. One of my favorites, was ""Anti-Matter Man"" While Professor Robinson was testing key pieces to the Jupiter II's engines, a portal was opened to the anti-matter world. Anti matter versions of John Robinson & Major Don West were wanting to cross over to the other universe at any cost. The only person who realized the danger of the situation, was Will! His problem was, providing enough information for someone to believe him. The Robot was able to analyze the situation and provide the answers. At the end, the two universes were put back into balance and the portal was closed.The argument I have with CBS is, they did not give Irwin Allen the opportunity to bring Lost in Space to a conclusion. If given one or two more seasons, I believe Irwin Allen and his writers, would have brought the Jupiter II, home to Earth.Lost in Space was a mix of Sci-Fi, adventure and a little comedy. This added to the appeal of the series. Jonathan Harris was outstanding in the role of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Dr.Smith was a true villian. If he was not being the villian, Dr. Smith was thorn in his desire in returning to Earth any cost. The other part of Dr. Smith's role everyone looked forward to, was the running dialogue and the insults he would have for the Robot. His confrontations with Professor Robinson or with Major West, added to Dr. Smith's appeal. Billy Mumy was excellent in the role of Will Robinson. One of the finer points of his role, was Will's attachment for the Robot. This attachment first started, when the series first started and would carry through until the series was cancelled. The final member of the cast who appealed to everyone, was Bob May. Bob May was inside the Robot. The actual voice of the Robot, was Dick Teufel, who also served as narrator during the open scenes of each episode. Bob May's & Dick Teufel's names never appeared in the opening or closing credits. Lost in Space appealed across age ranges and was welcome in everyone's home on Wednesday night. The series enjoyed increased popularity during its runs in syndication. Irwin Allen should have been given the opportunity to bring the series to a conclusion.Lost in Space is a must for anyone's DVD collection. Lost in Space is a series that can enjoyed by a newer generation of viewers and fans! The series is indeed, Classic Irwin Allen!",5,Classic Irwin Allen!,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,4484,"['Irwin', 'Allen', 'was', 'known', 'Master', 'Disaster', 'movies', 'such', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Earthquake', 'was', 'known', 'good', 'television', 'series', 'well.Probably', 'best', 'was', 'Lost', 'Space', 'series', 'Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'space', 'age', 'version', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'series', 'appealed', 'age', 'original', 'casting', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'asked', 'NASA', 'technical', 'advice', 'wanted', 'make', 'series', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'When', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'reviews', 'was', 'looking', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'changed', 'premise', 'series', 'original', 'casting', 'ship', 'was', 'named', 'Gemini', '12', 'When', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'advice', 'NASA', 'ship', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'giving', 'ship', 'identity', 'technical', 'advice', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'was', 'looking', 'came', 'other', 'sources', 'especially', 'Cal', 'Tech', 'original', 'casting', 'Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'be', 'true', 'adventure', 'series', 'was', 'Robot', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'received', 'recasting', 'CBS', 'made', 'suggestions', 'including', 'Robot', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'Smith', 'first', 'season', 'Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'true', 'adventure', 'series', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'classic', 'first', 'season', 'Robinson', 'family', 'had', 'deal', 'such', 'issues', 'finding', 'drinkable', 'water', 'making', 'sure', 'was', 'sufficient', 'food', 'sustain', 'finding', 'fuel', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'dealing', 'alien', 'visitors', 'Everyone', 'who', 'watched', 'series', 'wanted', 'see', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'would', 'go', 'space', 'again', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'Blast', 'Off', 'Space', 'classic', 'drama', 'episode', 'was', 'break-up', 'planet', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'was', 'lifting', 'off', 'space', 'were', 'good', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'were', 'light', 'hearted', 'were', 'few', 'serious', 'episodes', 'well', 'third', 'season', 'episodes', 'were', 'mix', 'being', 'light', 'hearted', 'serious', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'was', 'A', 'Visit', 'Hostile', 'Planet', 'when', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'time', 'barrier', 'home', '1947', 'Earth', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'Anti-Matter', 'Man', 'Professor', 'Robinson', 'was', 'testing', 'key', 'pieces', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'engines', 'portal', 'was', 'opened', 'anti-matter', 'world', 'Anti', 'matter', 'versions', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Major', 'Don', 'West', 'were', 'wanting', 'cross', 'other', 'universe', 'cost', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'realized', 'danger', 'situation', 'was', 'Will', 'problem', 'was', 'providing', 'enough', 'information', 'someone', 'believe', 'Robot', 'was', 'able', 'analyze', 'situation', 'provide', 'answers', 'end', 'two', 'universes', 'were', 'put', 'back', 'balance', 'portal', 'was', 'closed.The', 'argument', 'have', 'CBS', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'Lost', 'Space', 'conclusion', 'given', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'believe', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'writers', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'Jupiter', 'II', 'home', 'Earth.Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'mix', 'Sci-Fi', 'adventure', 'little', 'comedy', 'added', 'appeal', 'series', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'was', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'Smith', 'first', 'season', 'Dr.Smith', 'was', 'true', 'villian', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'villian', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'was', 'thorn', 'desire', 'returning', 'Earth', 'cost', 'other', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'role', 'everyone', 'looked', 'forward', 'was', 'running', 'dialogue', 'insults', 'would', 'have', 'Robot', 'confrontations', 'Professor', 'Robinson', 'Major', 'West', 'added', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'appeal', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'Will', 'Robinson', 'One', 'finer', 'points', 'role', 'was', 'Will', 'attachment', 'Robot', 'attachment', 'first', 'started', 'when', 'series', 'first', 'started', 'would', 'carry', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'final', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'appealed', 'everyone', 'was', 'Bob', 'May', 'Bob', 'May', 'was', 'Robot', 'actual', 'voice', 'Robot', 'was', 'Dick', 'Teufel', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'narrator', 'open', 'scenes', 'episode', 'Bob', 'May', 'Dick', 'Teufel', 'names', 'never', 'appeared', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'Lost', 'Space', 'appealed', 'across', 'age', 'ranges', 'was', 'welcome', 'everyone', 'home', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'increased', 'popularity', 'runs', 'syndication', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'series', 'conclusion.Lost', 'Space', 'must', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Lost', 'Space', 'series', 'can', 'enjoyed', 'newer', 'generation', 'viewers', 'fans', 'series', 'indeed', 'Classic', 'Irwin', 'Allen']",Lost in Space - Seasons 1 - 3
