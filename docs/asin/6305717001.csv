Finally i bought the DVD on just a whim, and I am so glad I did!Im not going to supply you with a plot because a lot of reviews already did that. I will say I found the film to be very original and charming. The preformaces by the actors, especially Albert Brooks, are prefectly delivered in this material. In addition, I could not stop laughing at some of the brilliant comedy. It's much better then the gross-out sex gags seen everywhere in cinema today.Some who see The Muse may not like it because they'll compare it to Brook's other films like Mother or Defending Your Life.

The lead actress is very talented and beautiful so it's no wonder she can work her scheme effectively on her clientele.  Now being middle age I can look back at the movie with fondness and appreciate the things I missed when I watch the mover over 10 years ago.Definitely a funny fun movie for the ages.

And once again Brooks makes a very funny movie. Brooks who in ways reminds me  of Woody Allen-this isn't anything new,many people have said the same  thing. The reason I think of Allen when watching Brooks's work is because I  can't really think of another comedic film maker who is as witty. Brooks's  comedy is very verbal. And this movie has it's share of great one liners.  For instance in the very first scene we see Cybill Shepherd(Who is one of  many to make a cameo)presenting Brooks with a humanitarian of the year  award. When driving home,Brooks is putting his daughter to sleep. She asks  him....&quot;Daddy what's a humanitarian?&quot; Brooks replies...&quot;It's  someone who's NEVER won the oscar!&quot; Now who else could of think of  that comeback?

When it was through I was left with the feeling that I had been robbed both of my time and of some hidden part of my soul. But I didn't worry much. After all, I've never really understood these quirky dark dramedies. Then I hear that this was supposed to be a straight-out comedy?!?!?! Somebody find me a joke in this thing. This is a film about a really depressed writer (Albert Brooks) who's career is over. Sharon Stone is supposedly a muse who Brooks hires to help him. Ironically she ends up helping everyone except Brooks and taking complete advantage of him. Yeah, real funny Brooks, let's see how long you can make that one gimmick work. The only thing keeping us from hating Stone is that she's a magical being and therefore must know what's best. At the end it turns out that maybe she was just an escaped mental patient. We're not really sure. So the audience is left with this horrible taste in their mouths rather than any shred of laughter that the filmmakers might have been hoping for. In short, the entire affair is an abysmal waste of celluloid to be avoided by anyone who values their time...and SOUL!

474063,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,6305717001,"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira""","[1, 2]","`The Muse' may not be the best comedy ever, but, let's face it, this is a funny, charming and entertaining movie. Moreover, sometimes its critics to Hollywood system can be very pertinent.Albert Brooks writes, directs, produces and stars this comedy about a Hollywood writer who -- as everybody says-- has lost his Edge. Advised by a friend who is very succesfull in the business, he meets The Muse, played by Sharon Stone. But far different from the simple Greek entities, she likes expensive clothes and hotels, she has many extravagant desires and charges for her inspiration. Undoubtly her attitudes and advices will change not only the writer's life but also his wife's.Don't expect something dark or mindy; this is a very light film. But this is very most of its charm lies. And, in Sharon Stone. She hasn't been as beautiful as in this movie for many years. She is the heart and soul of the story. She was born to play this character; there would never be a muse as amusing as she. And to make things better, she has a good timing for comedies. She uses all her sex symbol status to make her character sensual without being vulgar.The other players are fine. Jeff Bridges is particularly funny as Brooks's friend. Many industry insders, as Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner,  also pop up in some scenes, playing some of the muse's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Andie MacDowell is not bad but she has been better before, but her character allows her some transformation. Albert Brooks is a good comediant and he deliviries fine here.Brooks's  script sounds very resenteful with the big studios and their system. But his critics to them is as not acid as they could be. Actually, they taste much like an piece of cake that went off than bile as they actually should be to make this a much better movie-- but they are critcs anyway. Some of them are too clich&eacute;d, for one, the studio executive who turns to be Satan itself.I suggest you to take a look at this muse. You may find some good ideas here and there. Brooks himself may actually have been helped by a muse during the procution of this film -- but not all the time.",3,A Bittersweet &#65533;Muse&#65533;,1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2125,"['Muse', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'let', 'face', 'funny', 'charming', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'sometimes', 'critics', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'pertinent.Albert', 'Brooks', 'writes', 'directs', 'produces', 'stars', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'who', 'everybody', 'lost', 'Edge', 'Advised', 'friend', 'who', 'very', 'succesfull', 'business', 'Muse', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'far', 'different', 'simple', 'Greek', 'entities', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'hotels', 'many', 'extravagant', 'desires', 'charges', 'inspiration', 'Undoubtly', 'attitudes', 'advices', 'will', 'change', 'not', 'only', 'writer', 'life', 'also', ""wife's.Do"", ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'dark', 'mindy', 'very', 'light', 'film', 'very', 'most', 'charm', 'Sharon', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'been', 'as', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'heart', 'soul', 'story', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'character', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'muse', 'as', 'amusing', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'good', 'timing', 'comedies', 'sex', 'symbol', 'status', 'make', 'character', 'sensual', 'being', 'vulgar.The', 'other', 'players', 'are', 'fine', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Brooks', 'friend', 'Many', 'industry', 'insders', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'also', 'pop', 'up', 'scenes', 'playing', 'muse', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'not', 'bad', 'been', 'better', 'before', 'character', 'transformation', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'good', 'comediant', 'fine', 'here.Brooks', 'script', 'very', 'resenteful', 'big', 'studios', 'system', 'critics', 'not', 'acid', 'could', 'be', 'Actually', 'taste', 'much', 'piece', 'cake', 'went', 'bile', 'actually', 'should', 'be', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'are', 'critcs', 'anyway', 'are', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'one', 'studio', 'executive', 'who', 'be', 'Satan', 'itself.I', 'suggest', 'take', 'look', 'muse', 'may', 'find', 'good', 'ideas', 'here', 'there', 'Brooks', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'helped', 'muse', 'procution', 'film', 'not', 'time']",The Muse

474065,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6305717001,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 4]","I'm just gonna start right off the bat by saying that Albert Brooks is a comedic genius. There is no arguing that. The man always delivers. His best effort was the recent &quot;Mother&quot;. So, does this film deliver in the brilliant Albert Brooks way?. Well,no. It really doesn't. Is it still a pleasant and charming and humorous film?. Yes. It's just not up to Brooks' standards. In the movie, Brooks stars as Steven, a Hollywood screenwriter who can't seem to get a break, even after winning a prestigious film award. He has a nice home and a beautiful wife(played by Andie MacDowell), and some kids, but his career is floundering. It seems as if the studios aren't helping him much either. Then, his rich best friend(played by Jeff Bridges), lets Steven in on a little secret. He's been using a muse. Someone who inspires creativity in someone. At first, he's unwilling to share his muse with Steven, then gives in when he sees how desperate his buddy is. Steven meets Sarah(Sharon Stone), and it's not all great as he thought it would be. Sarah helps and gives, but expects things in return. Not just things, but nice things. She even moves in with the family!. I won't go into the ending and say what happens, but it is kind of a downer really. I wished it had ended some other way. The movie is light and airy and easily forgettable after a while, but it is smooth going down. Stone has never been more appealing here, even if she does get a little bossy here and there. Brooks is his usual reliable self. The film also has cameos by James Cameron, Martin Scorsesse, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, and Jennifer Tilly. The scene where Brooks is talking with a foreign man in a restaraunt and he doesn't understand what he is saying is priceless. I laughed hard at that one.

474067,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305717001,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 1]","Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks) is a writer who has hit a slump. His friend Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) seems to be doing well, so he goes to him for advice. Jack tells him that the secret to his success is a muse (Sharon Stone), one of the 9 daughters of Zeus, who inspires and councils Jack. Steven begs to meet her, so Jack sets up a meeting. She takes him on as a client, and he seems to be more inspired than usual, but The Muse is extreme high maintenance and she gets more demanding every day.Albert Brooks has been called a West Coast Woody Allen. He is not as funny nor as neurotic, but watching his schtick, you can't help but compare them. Born in Beverly Hills, his real name is Albert Lawrence Einstein. So, while some people might say 'I'm no Albert Einstein,' he can literally say 'I AM Albert Einstein.' His brother is Bob Einstein, AKA ""Super Dave"" Osbourne. His father, vaudeville/radio/film comedian Harry Parke, died of a heart attack when Albert was 11. At a Friar's roast for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz he collapsed next to Milton Berle. While growing up, Debbie Reynolds was always trying to match make him with her daughter, Carrie Fisher.I mention this biographical trivia to give you an idea of the man's show biz pedigree, and it pertains to The Muse becase it is a very inside Hollywood kind of a movie, and most if not all jokes are of the inside variety.-------------------Steven Phillips: [to the gate guard, after being informed that he may enter the studio grounds as a 'walk-on'] Let me ask you - is this the lowest a human being can go? I mean, is there such a thing as a 'crawl on?'==========================Says Brooks, ""I've always felt like I work in a small little area that doesn't represent anything like the rest of society."" So we get a parade of cameos with the likes of James F. Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, Cybill Shepherd, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Reiner, and Martin Scorsese. Not that there's anything wrong with that--in fact the Scorsese cameo deserves an Oscar if they ever decide to recognize that category. And if they ever recognize a category for 'most savage skewering of a weasely junior executive producer' then Mark Feuerstein as Josh Martin is a shoe in. Feurerstein may have been the kiss of death to several sit coms, but here he really nails his part. Even Mark himself cites this as his personal favorite personal performance.Though the film has many entertaining moments, the whole premise of The Muse falls flat towards the end, and like the writing of Steven Phillips, loses its edge.Albert Brooks ...

474068,A3CTCYWH8F03XO,6305717001,Clayton John Miller,"[5, 8]","I love Albert Brooks, the west coast neurotic, whose wit and witlessness in his films draw comparisons to one of my favorite star/writer/directors: Woody Allen. I love many of Albert Brooks films. Modern Romance is a  wonderful film, one of his best. Defending Your Life a neat little  diversion, funny, inventive. That is why the news I have to report on his  latest offering, THE MUSE, is hard to spit up. It is a bomb. It is unfunny.  It made me writhe about out of control for over 90 minutes. I almost walked  out of the room, something I have never done in the middle of a film. I  hated the thing. I did not laugh one single, solitary time. This is why I  am being particularly harsh on the film. It is a movie by someone I think  has a gift at filmaking, yet he makes a film about filmaking that is so  absurd and lifeless it almost makes you think he never made one in his  life.

474073,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305717001,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","Every few years Albert Brooks declares himself God and creates a little universe in his own image and likeness in the form of a film he writes, directs and in which he stars. &quot;The Muse&quot;, his latest creation is  a harmless jab at the Hollywood filmmaking industry. The story is not  particularly new or fresh, but it is effective satire in Brooks' inimitable  sardonic style. The comedy mostly works, but sometimes falls flat with  excess as Brooks can't seem to judge when a gag becomes too much of a good  thing.Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a veteran writer who has &quot;lost  his edge&quot;. At least that is what he is being told by everyone else.  Upon relating his frustrations to his best friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), Jack  confides in him that his career was saved by a muse and promptly offers to  set up a meeting with her and Steven. Enter Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone),  muse extraordinaire, who in return for her inspiration requires lavish and  continual attention and has an insatiable appetite for luxuries.Steven  becomes her shameless lackey as does his wife (Andie MacDowell) in hopes  that she can bring both of them fame and fortune. Ultimately they discover  that she is not actually a muse, but something else entirely.As always,  Brooks casts himself in the puling nebbish role, full of self deprecation  and sarcastic pokes at everyone and everything. The movie makes the  satirical point that everyone in Hollywood is looking for an edge and will  do just about anything to get it. In typical Albert Brooks style, comedy is  used to make an introspective point. If one looks deeper, the philosophical  point is that &quot;the edge&quot; is a perceptual concept. If one is  affected by the industry's negative opinion of one's work, the loss of  confidence will cause him to lose his edge. This is obvious by the fact  that the muse had no real powers, yet she helped every person she met. The  only thing that changed was each individual's belief in the talent they had  lost faith in.The story meanders from scene to scene with no real flow  and shamelessly throws in dozens of cameos of all Brooks' Hollywood  friends. From a directorial perspective, this film show why it is not a  good idea for a writer to direct his own material. He is too close to it  and can't see the little flaws that make the movie choppy.The acting was  mixed. I'm convinced that Albert Brooks is not really acting when he stars  in movies he writes. He is just being Albert Brooks, saying the words he  would say if he were in this fantasy situation of his own creation. While  his whimpering style can be funny in minor roles as a foil to some other  character, a full feature dominated by his whining gets more than a little  tedious.Andie MacDowell never ceases to be fresh in the nice girl role.  She just beams with enthusiasm and vitality as Steven's wife who, inspired  by the muse, turns her love of baking into a Hollywood cookie  empire.Sharon Stone dominates and energizes the story in her role as the  muse. This is the type of role she plays best, the ultimate femme fatale, a  siren of fantasy and desire. She exudes feminine superiority and gets her  way through guile and manipulation. No one can resist her magic and she  makes slaves of them all.I gave this movie a 7/10. All in all, it was  entertaining, with some funny gags and plenty of Albert Brooks ironic  jaundice for life.

At the suggestion of a friend, he seeks to engage the services of a muse, Sarah - Sharon - who demands gifts, living quarters and perpetual adoration.  The initial benefit is questionable as Brooks struggles to realize any positive ideas from Sarah while his wife - Andie MacDowell - comes up with a hundred thoughts regarding the relationship between him and his erstwhile source of inspiration.It's Andie that strikes gold first through the presence of Sarah, leading to comic angst from her husband - and perhaps no one has as much angst as Albert Brooks.

The summer-blockbuster idea the muse inspires needs to be funny. But it isn't. It sounds dreadful, and increasingly, the problems of Brooks the character become the problems of Brooks the director: how to put sizzle into an dry, workmanlike script perked up only by a spirited Stone.

A guiding spirit.b. A source of inspiration.3. muse A poet.Free On-line DictionaryHollywood seems so false. Each of us has our own interpretation of Hollywood life, but I can safely assume that behind the glamour is a group of people playing one-upsmanship, trying to outdo the other and using any means to get there. Steven Phillips, played by Albert Brooks is a film writer. Now, Albert Brooks has always been the epitome of irony to me. His acting and comedic skills are so powerful that he has become a favorite of mine. Somehow Albert Brooks is able to convey and project the feelings of a film writer who is on the skids, but doesn't want to face the reality of a Hollywood that has no empathy. He has written 17 films and is comfortable with the company he works for. B ut, he is told by his boss that he has lost his 'edge'. Steven feels he is on the edge now and never lost his. After talking with his agent, Hal, played by Bradley Whitford, he is told that no studio wants him, they all feel he has lost the 'edge'. Steven goes looking for help, and ends up at the home of a fellow writer, Jack, played by Jeff Bridges. Jack reluctantly tells him he has hired a 'muse' to help him through the rough spots. At last Steven meets the Muse, Nicole, played by Sharon Stone and hires her. Sharon Stone steps out of her usual sexpot roles and plays a seemingly, intelligent woman who has wisdom to spare. That is not how this Muse works. Steven must pay handsomely, Muses do not come cheap! As time goes on, Steven's wife comes under Nicole's spell and she and Steven go to great lengths to keep their muse.This is a light hearted romp through the business of film writing, and we get a look at how Howllywood works. It is not all talent, tricks and under pinnings all play a part in this world. Self confidence can be the name of the game, but we all need a boost every so often. This is not one of Albert Brook's best film, but it is a good one. So, is it better to hire a muse or be one?Recommended. prisrob 01-23-12Defending Your LifeBasic Instinct 2",4,To Muse Or Not To Muse,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2194,"['Muse:1', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'Any', 'nine', 'daughters', 'Mnemosyne', 'Zeus', 'whom', 'presided', 'over', 'different', 'art', 'science.2', 'musea', 'guiding', 'spirit.b', 'source', 'inspiration.3', 'muse', 'poet.Free', 'On-line', 'DictionaryHollywood', 'so', 'false', 'own', 'interpretation', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'can', 'safely', 'assume', 'glamour', 'group', 'people', 'playing', 'one-upsmanship', 'trying', 'outdo', 'other', 'using', 'means', 'get', 'there', 'Steven', 'Phillips', 'played', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'film', 'writer', 'Now', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'always', 'been', 'epitome', 'irony', 'acting', 'comedic', 'skills', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'become', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Somehow', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'able', 'convey', 'project', 'feelings', 'film', 'writer', 'who', 'skids', ""n't"", 'want', 'face', 'reality', 'Hollywood', 'empathy', 'written', '17', 'films', 'comfortable', 'company', 'B', 'ut', 'told', 'boss', 'lost', ""'edge"", 'Steven', 'feels', 'edge', 'now', 'never', 'lost', 'talking', 'agent', 'Hal', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'told', 'studio', 'feel', 'lost', ""'edge"", 'Steven', 'looking', 'help', 'up', 'home', 'fellow', 'writer', 'Jack', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Jack', 'reluctantly', 'hired', ""'muse"", 'help', 'rough', 'spots', 'last', 'Steven', 'meets', 'Muse', 'Nicole', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'usual', 'sexpot', 'roles', 'seemingly', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'wisdom', 'spare', 'not', 'how', 'Muse', 'Steven', 'must', 'pay', 'handsomely', 'Muses', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'cheap', 'time', 'Steven', 'wife', 'Nicole', 'spell', 'Steven', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'keep', 'muse.This', 'light', 'hearted', 'romp', 'business', 'film', 'writing', 'get', 'look', 'how', 'Howllywood', 'not', 'talent', 'tricks', 'pinnings', 'play', 'part', 'world', 'Self', 'confidence', 'can', 'be', 'name', 'game', 'need', 'boost', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'one', 'Albert', 'Brook', 'best', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'So', 'better', 'hire', 'muse', 'be', 'one', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-23-12Defending', 'LifeBasic', 'Instinct', '2']",The Muse

474091,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305717001,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","Hollywood takes a hit in ""The Muse,"" a subtle comedy from co-writer, director and star Albert Brooks.  One week after screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) receives a Humanitarian Award for Lifetime Achievement,  he is fired from a three picture deal at Paramount because there are those  who feel that he is ""losing his edge.""  His agent, Hal (Bradley Whitford),  tells him to take a year off, get his edge back.  With a wife and two  daughters, however, Steven proclaims this to be an unviable option,  whereupon he falls into a funk with no idea of what to do next.  His wife,  Laura (Andie MacDowell) urges him to consult with his best friend and  fellow screenwriter, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), who has been on a roll  for the past couple of years, including one in which he won an Oscar.  After some coaxing, Steven gets Jack to let him in on the secret of his  success, and it turns out that he has a muse (a ""real"" muse), and her name  is Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone).  Incredulous, initially, Steven is finally  convinced, and Jack sets up a meeting for him with Sarah.  She agrees to  take him on, and he quickly learns that there are rules and obligations  that go along with having a muse, which include a suite at the Four  Seasons, being on call whenever she feels ""inspired,"" as well as getting  her dry cleaning done and shopping for her.  All at his expense, of course  (""Consider it an investment"").  And then there's the little matter of  explaining it all to Laura (""Muses exist!  They live amongst us!"" he tells  her).  She responds as expected, but then Brooks cleverly takes the story  in another direction.  Laura and Sarah have lunch together, bond, and soon  Steven is sharing his muse with his wife.  Brooks fine-tunes and  finesses the humor throughout the film, taking Steven through his paces as  he tries to balance out his obligations to Sarah and Laura with the time he  needs to actually do some writing.  But the fact that Sarah is supposedly  the daughter of Zeus, and that it is taken for granted by all who believe  her to be a real muse, is really at the core of the humor in this movie.  Watching intelligent, successful people falling prey to such gullibility  enables us to laugh all the more at a situation that is already hilarious  on the surface.  Moreover, when you think about it and realize that there  are actually those in Hollywood (as well as anywhere, I suspect) who could,  in reality, be convinced that such a thing as a ""Muse"" actually exists, it  makes it all that much funnier still; yet if you extend that thought  further, it almost becomes scary.  Ultimately, Brooks and co-writer Monica  Johnson have turned out a movie that works extremely well on two levels,  with the satire on the surface perfectly complimented by all that's going  on underneath.  As usual, Brooks has assembled an excellent supporting  cast, including Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin) and Steven Wright (Stan  Spielberg), as well as sprinkling effective cameos by Rob Reiner, James  Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, and Jennifer Tilly (all of whom play themselves),  throughout; and there's an especially humorous bit by Martin Scorsese (also  playing himself).  The triumph of ""The Muse"" is that it is thought  provoking as well as laugh provoking; you'll laugh, think about it for  awhile, and when it really hits you, you'll probably be smiling and  chuckling for the rest of the day.",4,"Well, She Is The Daughter Of Zeus...",958348800,"05 15, 2000",2000,3412,"['Hollywood', 'hit', 'Muse', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'co-writer', 'director', 'star', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'One', 'week', 'screenwriter', 'Steven', 'Phillips', 'Brooks', 'Humanitarian', 'Award', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'fired', 'three', 'picture', 'deal', 'Paramount', 'are', 'who', 'feel', 'losing', 'edge', 'agent', 'Hal', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'take', 'year', 'off', 'get', 'edge', 'back', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'however', 'Steven', 'be', 'unviable', 'option', 'funk', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'consult', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'screenwriter', 'Jack', 'Warrick', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'been', 'roll', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'including', 'one', 'won', 'Oscar', 'coaxing', 'Steven', 'Jack', 'let', 'secret', 'success', 'out', 'muse', 'real', 'muse', 'name', 'Sarah', 'Liddle', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Incredulous', 'initially', 'Steven', 'finally', 'convinced', 'Jack', 'up', 'meeting', 'Sarah', 'take', 'quickly', 'are', 'rules', 'obligations', 'go', 'along', 'having', 'muse', 'include', 'suite', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'being', 'call', 'whenever', 'inspired', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'done', 'shopping', 'expense', 'course', 'Consider', 'investment', 'then', 'little', 'matter', 'explaining', 'Laura', 'Muses', 'exist', 'live', 'amongst', 'as', 'expected', 'then', 'Brooks', 'cleverly', 'story', 'direction', 'Laura', 'Sarah', 'have', 'lunch', 'together', 'bond', 'soon', 'Steven', 'sharing', 'muse', 'wife', 'Brooks', 'fine-tunes', 'humor', 'film', 'taking', 'Steven', 'paces', 'balance', 'out', 'obligations', 'Sarah', 'Laura', 'time', 'actually', 'do', 'writing', 'fact', 'Sarah', 'supposedly', 'daughter', 'Zeus', 'taken', 'granted', 'who', 'believe', 'be', 'real', 'muse', 'really', 'core', 'humor', 'movie', 'Watching', 'intelligent', 'successful', 'people', 'falling', 'prey', 'such', 'gullibility', 'laugh', 'more', 'situation', 'already', 'hilarious', 'surface', 'Moreover', 'when', 'think', 'realize', 'are', 'actually', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'anywhere', 'suspect', 'who', 'could', 'reality', 'be', 'convinced', 'thing', 'Muse', 'actually', 'that', 'much', 'funnier', 'still', 'yet', 'extend', 'thought', 'further', 'almost', 'scary', 'Ultimately', 'Brooks', 'co-writer', 'Monica', 'Johnson', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'two', 'levels', 'satire', 'surface', 'perfectly', 'complimented', 'going', 'underneath', 'usual', 'Brooks', 'assembled', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'Josh', 'Martin', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'Stan', 'Spielberg', 'as', 'well', 'sprinkling', 'effective', 'cameos', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'whom', 'play', 'especially', 'humorous', 'bit', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'also', 'playing', 'triumph', 'Muse', 'thought', 'provoking', 'as', 'well', 'laugh', 'provoking', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'think', 'awhile', 'when', 'really', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'smiling', 'chuckling', 'rest', 'day']",The Muse

474094,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,6305717001,Sonia,"[0, 2]","Albert Brooks has directed, stars in and written the so-so screenplay for The Muse.  Refreshingly, not many movies that trump the cliches and stereotypes of modern day Hollywood go at it from the perspective of the screenwriter specifically.  It seems many times, we get a peek at the Hollywood fishbowl through the eyes of an actor, director or producer (Bowfinger).  The screenwriter is a somewhat forgotten character in the movie-making mix.  But, at least screenwriters still get to accept their Oscars during the televised portion of the ceremonies, unlike all those other poor schmucks who get relegated to the 15-second ""Awards Given Earlier"" segment.The Muse introduces us to Steven Phillips, a screenwriter who is riding the high of receiving a Humanitarian award.  However, when his daughter asks what a humanitarian is, Steven (Albert Brooks) humbly replies, ""A humanitarian is someone who's never won an Oscar.""  Brooks is masterful at seeing the cloud for the silver lining.Steven's life takes a turn when, during a meeting about his latest screenplay, he is not so delicately told he's lost his edge and released from his studio contract.  Young studio whipper-snapper Josh condescendingly prompts Steven to start his second career in life, stating that people usually have three careers in their lifetimes.  Annoyed and somewhat lost, Steven tries vainly to figure out what his next step should be.One funny sequence is his trying to get a meeting with Stephen Spielberg.  The Spielberg headquarters almost mimic a David-Koresh-Branch-Davidian- compound feel, a veritable fortress that begs a level of respect.  Once inside, whether you are allowed to drive in or if you are diminished to ""walk-on"" status, your chances of actually meeting Spielberg are virtually non-existent.  Monotone actor/comic Steven Wright has a small role as cousin Stan Spielberg.Finally, desperate and wondering how he will feed his family, Steven approaches his friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), hoping for a break.  Jack shares the secret of his many successes.  He is using a muse, yes, a muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus, inspirational patronesses of the various arts.  Steven is desperate to try anything once at this point, and gets a meeting with Sarah, the muse (Sharon Stone).Sarah agrees to take him on, after explaining many of her conditions, not the least of which is staying at the Four Seasons to the tune of $1700 a night.  Not only that, but he must pay for her groceries, her transportation and be at her beck and call at all hours since she might have some inspiration in the middle of the night.  She does not give any ideas or do any of the writing, she merely is present for inspiration.Stone turns in an amusing, cute performance as Sarah that might mimic many of the qualities of your favorite high-maintenance friend.  She is very particular, expects gifts from Tiffany's, and wants Waldorf salads from Spago in the middle of the night.  Her insistence that things be exactly right is evident in her constant reminder to Steven, ""Are you writing all this down?""She eventually moves into the Phillips home, and befriends Steven's wife Laura (Andie MacDowell), inspiring her to start a venture of her own.  Steven is most displeased with the mayhem that ensues, and feels slighted, wondering if Sarah's ""museness"" is being sucked dry by his wife as well as other Hollywood types James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner who keep popping up everywhere.Martin Scorsese is the funniest part of the film, all hopped up on Starbucks coffee, and contemplating a remake of Raging Bull, except this time, with a really really thin, angry guy.  Oh man, it's a knee-slapper.There's a plot twist at the end of the film, which I didn't expect, but also didn't like.  I would have liked the follow-through to be more consistent.  It's a cute movie and interesting premise.  People generally don't mind being entertained with unrealistic possibilities.  Albert Brooks is very talented and I've liked his work in the past.  This is certainly not his strongest contribution, so I would recommend Defending Your Life he did with Meryl Streep, an interesting take on what might happen in the afterlife.The Muse is ho-hum at best, Sharon Stone is charming and Albert Brooks is his usual deadpan, frustrated, well-spoken self.

And Brooks's THE MUSE is unlikely to change his track record. But if you're burned out by in-your-face comedies, I strongly encourage you to see this. It's gratifyingly intelligent and superbly hilarious to boot.Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a Hollywood screenwriter who, as the movie opens, is being presented with a humanitarian award. (When one of his daughters asks what a humanitarian is, he replies, &quot;It's a man who never won an Oscar.&quot;) The award is the last good thing to happen to Steven for a while.Trying to peddle his latest script, he is told by many disparate parties that he has &quot;lost his edge.&quot; The movie's first half-hour milks huge laughs from Steven's desperate attempts at script-hustling, as he moves further and further down the Hollywood food chain.Then Steven happens upon Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), an old Hollywood friend whose career is on a dramatic upswing. Jack reluctantly shares his secret with Steven. He has a muse--not an imagined source of inspiration, but a real live goddess who gives him the help he needs. Jack arranges a meeting between Sarah the muse (played to the hilt by Sharon Stone) and Steven.THE MUSE, like the best modern-day comedies, is almost anti-high concept. Trying to explain its appeal usually bungles it for anyone who isn't in on the laugh. Brooks is simply one of the great comedians--for my money, right up there with Chaplin and all the other comedy icons you just have to trust will give you a good time. He's also a subtle, underrated director who gets huge laughs from the simplest camera set-ups. (Witness Steven's trek through a movie lot as he attempts to meet Steven Spielberg.)Brooks must have had his own muse to get such an inspired performance from Sharon Stone, whose appeal has been lost on me until now. She usually comes off as self-obsessed. But here, that can only be an advantage. Stone's best moments are Sarah's slack-jawed reactions to Steven's cost-cutting attempts to get her services for less. What's money to a muse like her, anyway?Even the ending, which is usually the weakest part of Brooks's movies, manages to wrap things up beautifully here. If Brooks really has a muse, I hope he'll lend her out to every comedy maker in Hollywood, fast.One final point in the movie's favor: Elton John's lush score, one of the best of 1999.THE MUSE is rated PG-13 for adult language and situations, and brief nudity.",5,Albert Brooks must be inspired by his *own* muse!,992649600,"06 16, 2001",2001,2724,"['will', 'admit', 'bias', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'had', 'make', 'list', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'alive', 'comedian-writer-director', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'top', 'ten.But', 'Brooks', 'been', 'directing', 'own', 'movie', 'comedies', '20', 'years', 'cult', 'comedian', 'humor', 'often', 'little', 'too', 'inside', 'Brooks', 'THE', 'MUSE', 'unlikely', 'change', 'track', 'record', ""'re"", 'burned', 'out', 'in-your-face', 'comedies', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'see', 'gratifyingly', 'intelligent', 'superbly', 'hilarious', 'boot.Brooks', 'plays', 'Steven', 'Phillips', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'movie', 'being', 'presented', 'humanitarian', 'award', 'When', 'one', 'daughters', 'asks', 'what', 'humanitarian', 'quot', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'won', 'Oscar.', 'quot', 'award', 'last', 'good', 'thing', 'happen', 'Steven', 'while.Trying', 'peddle', 'latest', 'script', 'told', 'many', 'disparate', 'parties', 'quot', 'lost', 'edge.', 'quot', 'movie', 'first', 'half-hour', 'milks', 'huge', 'laughs', 'Steven', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'script-hustling', 'further', 'further', 'down', 'Hollywood', 'food', 'chain.Then', 'Steven', 'Jack', 'Warrick', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'friend', 'career', 'dramatic', 'upswing', 'Jack', 'reluctantly', 'shares', 'secret', 'Steven', 'muse', 'not', 'imagined', 'source', 'inspiration', 'real', 'live', 'goddess', 'who', 'help', 'Jack', 'meeting', 'Sarah', 'muse', 'played', 'hilt', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Steven.THE', 'MUSE', 'best', 'modern-day', 'comedies', 'almost', 'anti-high', 'concept', 'Trying', 'explain', 'appeal', 'usually', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'Brooks', 'simply', 'one', 'great', 'comedians', 'money', 'right', 'there', 'Chaplin', 'other', 'comedy', 'icons', 'just', 'have', 'trust', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'time', 'also', 'subtle', 'underrated', 'director', 'who', 'huge', 'laughs', 'simplest', 'camera', 'set-ups', 'Witness', 'Steven', 'trek', 'movie', 'lot', 'meet', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Brooks', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'muse', 'get', 'such', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'appeal', 'been', 'lost', 'now', 'usually', 'off', 'self-obsessed', 'here', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'advantage', 'Stone', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'Sarah', 'slack-jawed', 'reactions', 'Steven', 'cost-cutting', 'attempts', 'get', 'services', 'less', 'What', 'money', 'muse', 'anyway', 'Even', 'ending', 'usually', 'weakest', 'part', 'Brooks', 'movies', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'beautifully', 'here', 'Brooks', 'really', 'muse', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'lend', 'out', 'comedy', 'maker', 'Hollywood', 'fast.One', 'final', 'point', 'movie', 'favor', 'Elton', 'John', 'lush', 'score', 'one', 'best', '1999.THE', 'MUSE', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'adult', 'language', 'situations', 'brief', 'nudity']",The Muse

A Hollywood writer who (the suits claim) has lost his Edge, turns in desperation to a professional &quot;muse.&quot; Sharon Stone plays this role just right - deliciously flaky, but heartrending, too, for her ability to activate others' potential, but inability to realize her own (how many of us play this role, believing our role is to encourage and inspire others, but never jump-starting our own dreams -- I never thought about this until I saw the movie).

474098,A243HY69GIAHFI,6305717001,tropic_of_criticism,"[4, 7]","What's most ironic about _The Muse_ is the fact that the plight befalling its main character is equally troubling Albert Brooks himself.  Like his fictional counterpart, Brooks has entered a creative dry spell with _The  Muse_, offering up neither writing nor acting that particularly  satisfies.Though the film's concept-that traditional Greek muses walk  among us and *must* be put up in a suite at the Four Seasons-has the  initial appeal of novelty about it, the ending negates all the promise of  the setup.  Instead of taking the setup to an interesting conclusion,  Brooks creates an air of unreality and  then walks away from it.  Better  endings have been written for Christmas episodes of sitcoms.As if  anticipating the dismal ending, most of the actors fumble their way  passionlessly through their lines-including, oddly, Brooks himself.  He  could've surely used an objective eye to help direct him in his own  scenes--he's largely more grating than welcome.  As his wife, Andie  MacDowell is absolutely miscast, as unable to show the emotions her lines  call for as she is to find an accent and stick with it.  Of the three  principals, the only actor to turn in an enjoyable performance is Stone,  who is perfect for the role.  Unfortunately, the role itself is far from  perfect, and never gives Stone much to work with.Likewise, the Hollywood  commentary might've been fresh at one time, but here it seems pale and  imitative. There are scenes which are almost entirely evocative of _The  Player_, not just in substance, but in visual composition.  The restaurant  scene, in particular, could've been lifted directly from that much better  film.  And _Bowfinger_ delvers better, less whiny laughs about the movie  making process itself.In sum, this film is a negligible achievement  that will leave all but the most diehard Albert Brooks fan unhappy--if not  downright angry--that they bothered.(DVD notes: The extra features here  are minimal.  There's no additional audio commentary of any kind and the  behind-the-scenes featurette is short.  The DVD isn't significantly  better, therefore, than the VHS, unless you just really want the  convenience of chapter search.)",1,Brooks needs a muse for real,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,2190,"['What', 'most', 'ironic', '_The', 'Muse_', 'fact', 'plight', 'befalling', 'main', 'character', 'equally', 'troubling', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'fictional', 'counterpart', 'Brooks', 'entered', 'creative', 'dry', 'spell', '_The', 'Muse_', 'offering', 'up', 'writing', 'acting', 'particularly', 'film', 'concept-that', 'traditional', 'Greek', 'muses', 'walk', '*must*', 'be', 'put', 'up', 'suite', 'Four', 'Seasons-has', 'initial', 'appeal', 'novelty', 'ending', 'negates', 'promise', 'setup', 'Instead', 'taking', 'setup', 'interesting', 'conclusion', 'Brooks', 'air', 'unreality', 'then', 'walks', 'away', 'Better', 'endings', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Christmas', 'episodes', 'sitcoms.As', 'anticipating', 'dismal', 'ending', 'most', 'actors', 'fumble', 'way', 'passionlessly', 'lines-including', 'oddly', 'Brooks', 'could', ""'ve"", 'surely', 'used', 'objective', 'eye', 'help', 'direct', 'own', 'scenes', 'largely', 'more', 'grating', 'welcome', 'wife', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'absolutely', 'miscast', 'unable', 'show', 'emotions', 'lines', 'call', 'find', 'accent', 'stick', 'three', 'principals', 'only', 'actor', 'turn', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'Stone', 'who', 'perfect', 'role', 'Unfortunately', 'role', 'far', 'perfect', 'never', 'Stone', 'much', 'work', 'with.Likewise', 'Hollywood', 'commentary', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fresh', 'one', 'time', 'here', 'pale', 'imitative', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'evocative', '_The', 'Player_', 'not', 'just', 'substance', 'visual', 'composition', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'particular', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lifted', 'directly', 'much', 'better', 'film', '_Bowfinger_', 'delvers', 'better', 'less', 'whiny', 'laughs', 'movie', 'making', 'process', 'itself.In', 'sum', 'film', 'negligible', 'achievement', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'diehard', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'fan', 'unhappy', 'not', 'downright', 'angry', 'bothered', 'DVD', 'notes', 'extra', 'features', 'here', 'are', 'minimal', 'additional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'kind', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'short', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'significantly', 'better', 'therefore', 'VHS', 'just', 'really', 'want', 'convenience', 'chapter', 'search']",The Muse
