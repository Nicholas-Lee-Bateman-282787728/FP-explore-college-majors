Anytime I don't really laugh during the previews it's a bad sign. First off, the animation, especially in the first few scenes? WHAT THE HECK? It looked weird and distorted. I can't tell if it got better or my eyes refocused. Either way, the story arc just wasn't all that great. Good guys, supposed bad guy, and the real bad guy. Good wins (which is great for little kids but not realistic) and bad is stuck in the harbor floating.Bottom line: rent it on here and be glad you didn't pay to see it i the theater. Had I spent $45 bucks on this in the theater (1 adult, 1 kid for matinee/snacks in SC) I would have been ticked off.I was out 2 cans of soda, a bag of popcorn, and some electricity at home.

Miller,"[0, 0]","The Nut Job [2014] [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + DIGITAL HD with UltraViolet] ENORMOUSLY LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!It&#8217;s time to go nuts for this action-packed 3D comedy featuring the all-star talents of Will Arnett, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham, Liam Neeson, Maya Rudolph and Katherine Heigl. Surly [Will Arnett] is a mischievous squirrel with a mission: to find the tastiest nuts for winter. When he discovers a whole store filled with his favorite food, he plans a heist of nutrageous proportions. But the place turns out to be owned by ruthless bank robbers, so it&#8217;s up to Surly and his furry friends to stop the nearby bank heist and save the town. The fur is sure to fly in this hilarious 3D adventure that critics are calling &#8220;Funny and witty! For kids of all ages!&#8221; [Jeffrey Lyons, Lyons Den Radio, WCBS]Voice Cast: Will Arnett, Robert Tinkler, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham, Liam Neeson, Katherine Heigl, Stephen Lang, Maya Rudolph, Sarah Gadon, James Rankin, Scott Yaphe, Joe Pingue, Annick Obonsawin, Julie Lemieux, James Kee, Scott McCord and Katie GriffinDirector: Peter LepeniotisProducers: Graham Moloy and Wookyung JungScreenplay: Lorne Cameron and Peter LepeniotisComposer: Paul IntsonResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.85:1Audio: English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Subtitles: English SDH, French and SpanishRegion: Region A/1Running Time: 1 hour 20 minutesNumber of discs: 2Studio: Universal StudiosAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217; is an animated family film. It has a lot of star power behind its animated characters with Will Arnett, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham, Liam Neeson, and Katherine Heigl offering their voices to the film. It has been released by Universal and is a decently fun family outing that will particularly please younger children in the audience and offer up mild entertainment to anyone who is a little bit older.The story primarily revolves around Surly [Will Arnett], who is a bit of a mischievous squirrel. Unlike the rest of the squirrels living in the park, he's gained a reputation for taking nuts solely for himself. He doesn't play that well with others and his sole friend is a rat who doesn't speak but is always by his side. Early in the film, he is confronted by Andie [Katherine Heigl], who attempts to inspire in him a need to help the community of the park and to share his nuts with other animals in need of food. Surly doesn't react to this with much thought and is keen only on keeping the nuts for himself.After a long(ish) action sequence, it isn't long before a fire accident destroys the food that the park had saved and managed to have for the upcoming season. The finger is pointed towards Surly and the manager of the park, the formidable Raccoon [Liam Neeson] suggests that the community banish Surly from living with them.Meanwhile, a meeting is held at the park. It is decided that someone needs to go out and look for food for the other animals because of their lack of available options following the loss of their stock. Andie leads the team along with Grayson [Brendan Fraser], who is at first a wannabe heroic leader before actually becoming one before the movie's end. The pair set out to find possible food options and they soon come to the same nut shop.Underneath the main plot-line, there is also a somewhat generic and boring sub-plot involving gangsters attempting to rob a bank who are using the nut shop as their 'front' to robbing. This storyline is far less interesting than the main one involving the squirrels, but the storyline is something that gives attention to both plots as an element of the movie (but with much less screen time devoted to the gangsters).The animation in the film is something that one would expect to be one of the high points considering the $40 million production budget. &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217; is something one would want to deliver as good of an animated presentation as possible within that kind of framework. It's disappointing that while the whole film has a clean and vibrant colour palette the artistry is less detailed and more generic feeling. There are some nice elements to the artwork. However, nothing in the production design comes close to the work done by major animation studios like PIXAR (the best of the best), Sony Pictures Animation or DreamWorks Animation. I thought this film was a solid decent done animation film that is charming, sweet, and totally good-natured. The plot-line almost feels like a throwback to cartoons of the 70's or 80's (which is sort of nice). &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217; has big screen joyous aspiration with a first rate video presentation, a solid 3D experience and an amazing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217; is presented on Blu-ray with an impressive 1080p High Definition transfer that retains the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen. The animation looks as stunning as it ever will with a good clean presentation that provides the artwork with all the detail and clarity one expects from a solid digital animation transfer. But the best of this is of course the 3D Blu-ray disc, which is totally stunning, but of course the choice is totally up to you, especially having both 3D and 2D discs, but I will always watch the 3D Blu-ray disc, as it gives you more depth and involves you with the brilliant animal characters.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217; is presented with an amazing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation, and more than gets the job done, sinking its teeth into the more action-oriented sequences with ease. Output is big and bold when the nut cart hurtle down the street and around the park; explosions rip through concrete, or giant-footed robbers give chase to scampering rodents, even if it isn't all that remarkable beyond Surly's antics and the central heist. And the rear speakers are spry and playful, delivering ample ambience in Raccoon's park and the busy streets of downtown. Directionality is decent and pans are smooth, without anything in the way of major problems. Voices are clean, clear and intelligible too, although never really as grounded in the soundscape as they should be. Too many lines seem a tad detached from the rest of the sound field. That said, the film's sound design is the culprit, nothing more. Will The Nut Job's lossless track sweep you up into the wild hijinks of Surly the Squirrel? No. It won't disappoint, and will blow you away!Blu-ray Special Features and Extra:Deleted Scenes [5:00] Presents a few select moments that were left on the cutting room floor.Storyboards [3:00] Presents a few short select moments from the film as they were as storyboarded before the sequence was produced.The Great Nut Heist [2:00] Is a standard promotional behind-the-scenes piece with interviews and clips from the film.Animated Shorts [15:00] The biggest inclusion is two animated shorts and they are &#8220;Surly Squirrel&#8221; &#8211; Meet Surly for the very first time in the award-winning animated short that started it all. &#8220;Nuts & Robbers&#8221; &#8211; Surly and Grayson stumble upon a bank heist gone wrong &#8211; created by ToonBox Entertainment as a teaser for &#8216;The Nut Job&#8217;.Dance-Off End Credits Sequence [4:00] Surly joins his furry friends and a very special guest for this show-stopping number and is not in 3D.Finally, the story is more than a bit frantic, and there are no real break-out characters that make an animated film a classic, but The Nut Job is amiable enough to entertain everyone. Whether the adults will be engaged or not depends on how much they like the look of things. And The Nut Job is brilliant to look at - from its retro-inspired style to its bright colours and attention to detail and the wise cracks are totally brilliant. Especially impressive are the individual hairs on characters and rendered textures like wood and stone. The look of the film, from the styling of the buildings and backgrounds to the whole heist scenario, brings to mind classic Bugs Bunny encounters with the gangsters Rocky and Mugsy. Alas, none of the characters in The Nut Job have quite the personality of Bugs, but despite this, I loved this animation film and have already watched it three times, as each time you view it you seem to see something new, as there is so much action happening. But again the 3D Blu-ray disc is totally stunning and despite a lot of negative reviews, I think they must be viewing a totally different 3D Blu-ray disc and all their negative comments are out of order and do not appreciate all the animation work that went into making The Nut Job. But one very important aspect I need to warn you and that is that you definitely need to watch the End Credits right to the very end, as you will see some amazing 3D animation and of course you must keep your 3D glasses on right to the bitter end, as it is a joyous exuberant amazing experience and definitely the best 3D Credits ever I have seen in a very long time and I know it will give me many hours of enjoyable entertainment and will amaze your friends and is 3D reference. Another amazing bonus for purchasing the 3D and 2D Blu-ray disc combination is the slip cover, as it has an amazing stunning 3D effect, which is not pointed out from any of the other 3D Blu-ray Reviews I have read. But the most important thing is that I am more than happy to have this in my Blu-ray Collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Andrew C.

Upon graduation from printing up my degree from a PDF file, I sought gainful employment that would enable me to utilize my new authority to preach. As I received a deliverance to my faith, I was fortunate enough to find a job as a chaplain for the local Christian homeschooling network of special needs children ages four to thirteen here in Tennessee. It has been essential for me to find new ways of staying contemporary so that I can effectively reach out to the youth I teaching them tried and true principles. Object lessons from our field trips have proven to be most effective teaching tools.Recently, I loaded up I all thirty kids on the short bus (all the school can afford is a 15 passenger van so we have to squeeze in) and took them to see the movie 'The Nut Job.' Once again Hollywood has packaged a seemingly innocent kids movie glorifying the ills of modern society. Beautiful animation, endearing characters (in this case it is the little animals) clever banter, memorable music and convincingly well-intended purpose all serve as a vehicle to lure and re-educate impressionable minds.Knowing full-well the intent of this movie, I took advantage of it by counteracting it on our field trip. Sure, people will debate on twitter or chatrooms of the Robin Hood approach to steal from the rich to feed the poor or somehow,the have nots are more entitled to take from the haves. ""Spread the wealth"" as a not so great man once said that I regretfully voted for twice, but stealing is stealing and it is something that should not be embraced. The wording may change, but the definition will remain the same.After the movie ended, everyone was pretty excited by recalling what everyone had just seen like no one else saw it, we went down to the park. There, I lead them to a secluded area where we gathered about to hear my sermon on stealing. As I reasoned (the only way to guide the weak-minded into thinking your way) with them the follies of sin, more especially in this case, stealing. They began to see the willfully erroneous actions of the animals from the movie.Despite how hungry the animals were, stealing was still as sin. The children began to be angry with the animals for stealing from the humans who were merely trying to make an honest living and feed their families.From a footlocker I had just hours before the movie hidden in the bushes, I opened it to reveal an ensemble of various weapons ranging from slingshots, blow darts, BB guns, smoke canisters, one flash bang grenade (not sure how that got in there, but it was hilarious in use) to tasers. Each of the children were encouraged to take one or two of the weapons, find all the animals they could find in the park and serve the justice of their god upon them.Never before had I felt so much joy than I did for those few hours I the park that day. It is true when they say that 'there is no greater calling than that of teaching.'I purchased this movie to utilize on more 'teaching' trips for my ministry.

1690278,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HLTD2OE,FNDNreview,"[19, 29]","Unfortunately, for those of us that enjoy watching animated movies either for our own entertainment or with our kids, not every new feature is going to be as well received as Disney&#8217;s Frozen.  To that end, whichever animated film was going to be released after Disney&#8217;s latest box office success was bound to find itself on the proverbial short end of the stick (when comparing the two films).  And here we are as Open Road Films, the distributor behind such films as End of Watch, Machete Kills, and Justin Bieber&#8217;s Believe, has decided to dabble in the animation pool &#8211; backing the release of 2014&#8217;s first animated film, The Nut Job.Canadian animation director Peter Lepeniotis writes and directs his original story (based on his character from Surly Squirrel), The Nut Job.  Surly (Will Arnett) is an openly selfish squirrel that only looks out of his own interests &#8211; most importantly of which is food.  He is a member of a broader group of animals, led by a large raccoon &#8211; named Raccoon (Liam Neeson).  With winter approaching and their food supply dwindling down, Raccoon sends two of his most trusted squirrels, Andie (Katherine Heigl) and Grayson (Brendan Fraser) to retrieve nuts from a new nut stand.  Surly has a similar plan, but he only intention is to collect enough nuts for himself &#8211; with the help of his silent rat sidekick, Buddy.Naturally, the plan goes astray for both Surly and his fellow group of animals when a grumpy child randomly approaches the nut vendor for some nuts.  As it turns out, the nut vendor is nothing more than a common bank robber that has been casing the bank across the street.  Mischief ensues and the nut cart eventually managers to do far more damage to Surly and the animals&#8217; home &#8211; prompting Raccoon to banish Surly from his home.  Now, homeless and forced to live in the scary city, Surly stumbles upon a nut storefront and devises a plan &#8211; with the help of Buddy and Andie, to steal and share the near endless supply of food.The Nut Job is a below average animated feature and the best way to describe the direction of the plot would be lazy.  Its storyline is easily foreseeable since (from the opening moments) the major predicament is blatantly evident, and features an outcome that everyone will already be expecting.  On that merit alone, there&#8217;s absolutely nothing special about what this particular film has to offer.  There are sub-par releases, like The Wild or Home on the Range, that have much more enjoyable characters, so I feel like this film should have done more than just introduce a rude squirrel, his mute sidekick (that looks like he&#8217;s straight out of Pixar&#8217;s 2007 acclaimed hit, Ratatouille) and a abruptly chatty dog.  The bank heist paralleling the nut heist is cute, but it&#8217;s anything other than a fresh idea.Surly, the film&#8217;s main character &#8211; is a problematic individual from several different points of view.  For starters, he&#8217;s too self-centered for far too much of the film.  In essence, it takes too long for him to become humbled.  Obviously, his ultimate change in attitude is also a central point of the story, so we all know his inevitable sacrifice is going to be for the greater good of his peers.  In this case, his about-face needed to take effect long before the climax of the film.  No matter how many times people tell him he&#8217;s selfish, he openly admits that he&#8217;s perfectly okay with that position.  It&#8217;s almost like this character tries to make defiance cool &#8211; yet the constant defiance creates for a barely likeable protagonist and devastates the character&#8217;s chemistry with his fellow animals.Will Arnett, who voices Surly, is the definitely the wrong person to be behind the protagonist.  His voice is too deep and borderline creepy &#8211; meaning he would have been much more acceptable as Raccoon, who becomes quite the unlikable character himself.  Still, Liam Neeson was the man behind that voice and I won&#8217;t dare say anything bad about the guy that played Qui-Gon Jinn (although he has had plenty of lackluster roles over the years).  In any event, Arnett&#8217;s domineering vocals are standoffish and just don&#8217;t work for a main character that should be beloved by viewers.Overall, many people are far too harsh on animated films &#8211; but The Nut Job deserves the criticism.  At the end of the day though, the only question most people are really interested in is:  will it entertain kids?  And, even though this plot is old and has been recycled more times than anyone is able to count, it will still hold children&#8217;s attentions for the duration.  The characters are anything but memorable, and several of them try to be funny at the wrong moments, but the kids will likely chuckle a time or two.  Animated films are generally moneymaking machines, and The Nut Job will likely do well enough to secure a sequel &#8211; even though it already feels more like a direct-to-video endeavor.GRADE:

There were pros and cons to &#8220;The Nut Job&#8221; film that made me feel compelled to only rate it two stars. First the good points to this film:The pros: The Nut Job contains a positive message of the happy benefits of sharing and the happiness that can occur when achieving goals as a group.The cons: the film shows the character of Surly being banished from his group for reasons that I personally felt were not necessarily a big deal to isolate someone from a village of other animals. Additionally, the film pretty much centers around one main goal. The film could have been made stronger with the plot of the animal community working together to accomplish three to four goals instead of just one.As a consolation to me, my husband at least liked this film more than I did.  It is just that I honestly feel that the Nut Job is a film better suited to watching once it is out on dvd rather than seeing it in the movie theaters.  It was not easy for me to rate this movie only two stars because I normally enjoy animated films and have watched and enjoyed many such as the following films: Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2, Despicable Me 2, Hoodwinked, Gnomeo & Juliet, Meet The Robinsons, Tangled,Toy Story 3, Puss In Boots, Hotel Transylvania, and Rango.",2,"I Understand That This Movie Is Popular At The Box Office, However",1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1374,"['husband', 'chose', 'go', 'movies', 'ten', 'year', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'decided', 'movie', 'were', 'pros', 'cons', '8220', 'Nut', 'Job', '8221', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'compelled', 'only', 'rate', 'two', 'stars', 'First', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'pros', 'Nut', 'Job', 'positive', 'message', 'happy', 'benefits', 'sharing', 'happiness', 'can', 'occur', 'when', 'achieving', 'goals', 'group.The', 'cons', 'film', 'character', 'Surly', 'being', 'banished', 'group', 'reasons', 'personally', 'felt', 'were', 'not', 'necessarily', 'big', 'deal', 'isolate', 'someone', 'village', 'other', 'animals', 'Additionally', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'centers', 'one', 'main', 'goal', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'stronger', 'plot', 'animal', 'community', 'working', 'together', 'accomplish', 'three', 'four', 'goals', 'instead', 'just', 'one.As', 'consolation', 'husband', 'least', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'just', 'honestly', 'feel', 'Nut', 'Job', 'film', 'better', 'suited', 'watching', 'out', 'dvd', 'rather', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theaters', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'rate', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'normally', 'enjoy', 'animated', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'such', 'following', 'films', 'Cloudy', 'A', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'Hoodwinked', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'Tangled', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'Rango']",N/A

The animation is great, the characters pretty good. The story line and plots will be beyond the reach of most kids though. Kids will probably watch it but not really understand what is going on in the plots and sub plots. I not only watched it but will be buying the 3D version. This is a good animated film, for animated film buffs. I liked it and enjoyed the characters as well as the animation. While not the highest of the high quality like Pixar, this is right up there with Dreamworks in terms of quality. If you like animation, yeah .. buy it. If you have seen it, you know what the movie is already. If not, the story synopsis is online so it's not needed to be repeated here endlessly. Just saying it's a high enough quality work to warrant a purchase if you like animation.
