While other television series start to fade out at about the fourth or fifth season, THE GOOD WIFE begins their fifth season with bang and the audience is on a wild ride as Alysia, Cary and the rest of the fourth years leave LOCKHART & GARDNER to begin their own firm.  This story-line creates a myriad of new episode possibilities as the two factions begin an all-out war and we have front row seats as the fighting and maneuvering continues to escalate as the season progresses.They have also added a secondary story-line in which Alysia's husband Peter Florrick, the governor elect, joins forces with his wife's new firm, much to the dismay of his right hand man Eli.  Eli realizes that Peter's continuing alliance with the firm could be his downfall and create new controversies as his favoritism may lead him to compromise his gubernatorial ethics.  Exciting and fresh, this season could be the best one yet.UPDATE: This review was more helpful at the time the episode ""Hit The Fan"" was shown or before.

Now the last episode on March 23rd. This was a shocking episode losing one the the main characters in this show.  My gosh what a shock.  I read that Mr. Charles(will)actually requested being written out of the show for whatever reasons he has.  So this is how they did it.  The show will greatly miss him, but it might keep the show going with so many more story lines.VERY INTERESTING!!!!The break up episode when Alicia splits with her law firm was very exciting and promised a lot in intrigue in the future.  So why the three stars? The first thing that ruined it for me is when a 30 million dollar account swithced back and forth between the the present law firm and the new one headed up by Cary and Alicia, by slinging mud at each other.  Whoever visited last won the account.  The truth is,the firm wouldn't have dealt with either one with both looking like idiots.The second issue for me is Alicia's character.  She is shown to be an extremely intelligent, mature woman with a real head on her shoulders.  It already appeared that her reconcilliation with her husband was forced and acted out for her benefit.Twice at differently times in the series, the now Governor elect(her husband) came into her house, this time with a party going on at the time, and she willingly had sex with him highlighted by her turning back after they were finished to fetch her panties and pull them up.  Alluring?  Not in this case.  It just wasn't her character.  In another episode in season 3 or 4, Alicia was late for a very important meeting.  In comes the husband who she is separated from, puts her up against the wall, pulls down the underwear and they go to it standing up.

The acting is first-rate, and the writing smart & snappy. The episode 'Hitting The Fan' was one of the best, but clearly not the only one. The final minutes of 'Dramatics, Your Honor' & the subsequent episode were clearly the best ones in terms of drama. The tension was high, and the writing very well done. 'Tying The Knot' was evidently a very different episode, and there was a ghost behind the camera on this one (wink, wink). I can't wait to see how that storyline is resolved.

The anchoring plot of this show has always been the on-again, off-again love affair of Will and Alicia, and the tension it creates in her marriage to Peter. This season, everything has gone to shambles and there are more ugly confrontations in one episode than take place in an entire year in divorce court. Everyone is out to destroy everyone else, words are vicious, actions are duplicitous, characters are two-faced. David Lee used to shock us with his meanness and crassness: now everyone's become David Lee. Knowing that Alicia and Will can never come back from the treachery and ugliness they've aimed at the other removes the show's biggest draw for me: the question of whether they will ever find love with each other.So where's the tension now?  Law firm versus law firm. Who will prevail, Lockhart Gardner or Florrick Agos? Who cares? I'm not rooting for Alicia's side, because all she'll gain by winning is (1) having a bigger client caseload which takes her away from life's important things like love and family, (2) hurting Will even more.I think the writers have taken a terrible turn this season, causing all the show's drama to revolve around the question of which group of devious, back-stabbing, lying, deceiving lawyers will be the most successful.

Each episode is so well scripted and engrossing, the characters are well developed and interesting, and you just cannot predict what will happen next. I like that it's not predictable and boring.  The courtroom drama is always well done and very similar to what happens in real courtrooms. So it's believeable. I also like that they have 5 lawyers who are scriptwriters for the show, and also lawyer technical support, all keeping it real.I am a fan of this show and will keep watching.
