695843,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000063TON,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 19]","This was not a great film.  From the opening credit sequence to the ending miraculous shots, the film follows the obvious route of ""made-for-TV"" without cutting corners or taking shortcuts.  For a little over three hours we watch as we are guided by Branagh and his group of unknowns through different sound stages, outdoor shots full of graininess, and classic wind machines put to great use.  The story is weak, the acting was not a necessity for those producers at A&E;, and outside of Shackleton, there is no defined voice of our other characters.  Again, this not was a great film.  Yet, somehow, I found myself glued, wide awake, and attentive through the entire adventure.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that I knew nothing, prior to this film, about the man Earnest Shackleton or about his ill-fated expedition.  Perhaps it was more the excitement of watching man versus Mother Nature or even seeing a new place that I had only seen on maps or other television program.  I don't know what it was, but Shackleton kept me glued to my TV screen.  There was no reason for me to enjoy this film, but alas, I did.  Not due to the acting, not the story, and definitely not the visuals, but mainly due to the historical element.  I enjoyed watching, as morbid as this sounds, how painful and uncontrollable Mother Nature can be and how it combats the strength of men.  This impressed me more than anything that escaped Branagh's mouth did.To begin, this was a difficult film to watch.  After seeing Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou several times, I had trouble separating Bill Murray the explorer and Kenneth Branagh the explore, which are two completely different characters.  Maybe I watched in hopes that Willem Dafoe would arrive to bring some humor to this crew, but alas, it never happened.  Nonetheless, Branagh did a decent job as the hard-nosed Brit that felt more desire to save his crew than finish the expedition.  Oddly enough, Branagh is one of the only actors that can steal three-plus hours of my life and I really don't mind.  Other actors, I have some trouble with, but Branagh seems to deliver, even at his worst, a character that is easy on the eyes.  Shackleton was not his best, but I followed him because I was compelled to see where he would take me.  Is that a sign of a good actor or a good director?  I don't know because I wasn't happy with the direction that Charles Sturridge took during this adventure.  For the first hour-plus we are privy to brief moments of Shackleton's private life and his ability to sell his dreams, but that is not what this film is all about.  This film is about the dangers and dedication that these men had to staying alive.  I would have wished that Sturridge had dedicated more time towards the perils and less towards the underdevelopment of the characters.  Sturridge placed so much emphasis on the characters, that by the end of the film you didn't really know any of them except for Shackleton, yet we needed more development to heighten the emotion at the end.  Branagh brought himself decently to the screen, but it is in my opinion that Sturridge did not craft together a strong enough story.This viewer also had trouble with the overall British environment that Sturridge created.  I realize that Shackleton was a British man, but in this film it felt as if he glazed it on rather heavily.  Whenever there was trouble for these men, you could undoubtedly expect our characters to yell ""bloody"" about something.  While it was fun at first, I just felt like Sturridge was pushing it in my face.  Maybe it wasn't such a big deal, but I seemed to notice it quite a bit more as the temperature continued to drop.  Coupled with the language was the poor set design.  I shouldn't say poor, but rather inconsistent.  In the beginning, there was some excitement ""traveling"" to these different wealthy homes (which were the same but with different items inside), but when we got to the Antarctic, there wasn't much to speak about.  I felt as if we were walking over the same sets over and over again, but just moving the iceberg in a different location.  The funniest and most deplorable moment, was when Shackleton and his small crew fought the storm on the sea.  I couldn't tell what was happening, but thanks to the graininess, I didn't have to.  E-gad, I thought A&E; had more money than this!Overall, I cannot harshly critique this film because I did watch all three hours of it without a single flinch of sleep, but I cannot give credit to the acting, the characters, the direction, the set design, or the story.  What I loved about this film was the human element.  The power of endurance, which ironically was the name of his sinking boat (symbolism ... oh, I think so!), kept me captured to the screen.  I would not recommend this film to friends because of the lengthiness to get to the finale (it is almost like going on your own Shackleton adventure), but I cannot knock it.  If you can get past the poor production value of this film and see the power of the historical and Mother Nature element, than I think you will like it.  For me, I must go watch Life Aquatic one more time to get a true ""explorer"" spirit into my mind!Grade: *** out of *****",3,From Winston Churchill.

Kenneth Branagh is perfectly cast as Sir Ernest Shackleton, the slightly full-of-himself but heroic leader of the expedition.  The entire thing was filmed, quite realistically, in Greenland, which looks stunning.I was particularly impressed at how closely the cinematography matches the well-known photographs taken by the actual expedition photographer, Frank Hurley.  Some shots in the film are essentially identical to Hurley's photos, adding to the film's realism. (If you'd like a good look at the original photos, I recommend Caroline Alexander's ""Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antartic Expedition,"" which contains great reproductions of them.)  It's true that it takes the entire first half of the film for the expedition to get underway and then stranded, but even this lengthy non-Antarctic segment is reasonably well done.On top of the inherent drama in the story and the excellent production, the DVD carries an entire volume of worthy extras:  a 2-hour history of the Antarctic, a segment from A&E; ""biography"" on Shackleton, and a ""making of"" video as well.Enough to keep exploration fans--or anyone interested in great adventures--happy for hours and hours!",5,Makes an incredible story even better,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,1572,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'incredible', 'story', 'Shackleton', 'Endurance', 'expedition', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'stranded', 'Antarctic', 'yet', 'men', 'lived', 'tell', 'tale', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'wonderful', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'filmed', 'version', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'mind', 'eye.I', 'was', 'gratified', 'find', 'Shackleton', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'adventure', 'movies', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Sir', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'slightly', 'full-of-himself', 'heroic', 'leader', 'expedition', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'filmed', 'quite', 'realistically', 'Greenland', 'stunning.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'how', 'closely', 'cinematography', 'well-known', 'photographs', 'taken', 'actual', 'expedition', 'photographer', 'Frank', 'Hurley', 'shots', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', 'identical', 'Hurley', 'photos', 'adding', 'film', 'realism', ""'d"", 'like', 'good', 'look', 'original', 'photos', 'recommend', 'Caroline', 'Alexander', 'Endurance', 'Shackleton', 'Legendary', 'Antartic', 'Expedition', 'great', 'reproductions', 'true', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'expedition', 'get', 'underway', 'then', 'stranded', 'even', 'lengthy', 'non-Antarctic', 'segment', 'reasonably', 'well', 'done.On', 'top', 'inherent', 'drama', 'story', 'excellent', 'production', 'DVD', 'entire', 'volume', 'worthy', 'extras', '2-hour', 'history', 'Antarctic', 'segment', 'A', 'E', 'biography', 'Shackleton', 'making', 'video', 'well.Enough', 'keep', 'exploration', 'fans', 'anyone', 'interested', 'great', 'adventures', 'happy', 'hours', 'hours']",N/A

Perhaps I'm not British enough to find his dalliances amusing or interesting.

He seems devoted above all else to self interest. The mighty Shackleton it seems didn't have any real skills for employment.His selfishness and pride made him deaf to good counsel, and so he put his trusting crew in mortal danger. He's not a hero, simply a proud man running away from himself while chasing after self gratification, and glory. The stories of Shackelton's explorations are much more interesting than the man this movie makes him out to be.

I must say I was somewhat disappointed by how this one came out.  First off, let me say that it is still worth watching and the extras that come with the DVD are quite interesting.  However, I feel that too much time is spent on things not relevant to the actual story of the ""Endurance"" expedition, such as Shackleton's relationship with his problematic brother Frank.  Once they get on the Endurance and head towards the Antarctic ice, it gets better, but still, the true measure of Shackleton's genius for leadership is not really brought out.  For example, there was a major difference of opinion between Shackleton and his officer from the Royal Marines, Orde-Lees, regarding stocking up on seal meat.  Orde-Lees felt they should be cautious and kill as many seals as possible to put in a good store in case the seals should disappear or they should be stranded longer than expected.  Shackleton strongly opposed doing this because it would signal to the men that he didn't really think they would be able to get away in any reasonable time.  This was not mentioned at all but is crucial to the story.  We are shown one particularly dangerous incident of insubordination by the carpenter, MacNeish, who was pacified by Shackelton and was later absolutely vital to their rescue since he fitted out the open-boat James Caird, travelled in it to South Georgia Island and kept it afloat, yet we are not told that after they were rescued, Shackleton insisted that he NOT be awarded the Polar Medal, because Shackleton never forgave him for his earlier outburst, no matter how important and cooperative he was to him afterwards.  I was particularly disappointed that almost nothing was shown about the open-boat journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia, a distance of over800 miles over the stormiest oceans on Earth.  We do see them attempting to make sun sightings in order to determine their position, and we do see huge waves crash over the boat, but the immense difficulties of this amazing journey are surprisingly NOT described, for example the need to get a very accurate fix on the sun's position on a violently pitching boat, through frequently cloudy skies.  If the position was not determined accurately enough, they could miss South Georgia, which is a small island, and end up in the middle of ocean while their food and water ran out.  Captain Worsley's genius in knowing how and to where to steer the boat is not mentioned at all.Finally, the difficulties of the men left behind on Elephant Island are not mentioned other than the operation performed to remove one man's frost-bitten toes.  Shackleton said he expected to return to them within one month but it took over four months,but we are not really told of how the men there coped or all the immense difficulties Shackleton had in returning to them.""The Last Place on Earth"" went into great detail explaining the differences in leadership between Amundsen and Scott and why the former was successful whereas the later died returning from the South Pole, but no comparable character study of Shackleton is presented here to show how he was able to overcome the immense odds against him and how he was able to avoid what happened to his bitter rival Scott, in spite of sharing many typical ""British"" attitudes that hampered their Polar parties as opposed to the more flexible Norweigians like Amundsen.Having said this, this DVD is still worth seeing since the storyof the Endurance is so compelling.",4,Worth Seeing-But Could Have Been Better,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3746,"['got', 'turned', 'polar', 'exploration', 'book', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Last', 'Place', 'Earth', 'Roland', 'Huntford', 'race', 'Amundsen', 'Scott', 'South', 'Pole', 'seeing', 'how', 'Huntford', 'was', 'adviser', 'program', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'great', 'hopes', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'how', 'one', 'came', 'out', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'extras', 'come', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'However', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'things', 'not', 'relevant', 'actual', 'story', 'Endurance', 'expedition', 'such', 'Shackleton', 'relationship', 'problematic', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Once', 'get', 'Endurance', 'head', 'Antarctic', 'ice', 'better', 'still', 'true', 'measure', 'Shackleton', 'genius', 'leadership', 'not', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'example', 'was', 'major', 'difference', 'opinion', 'Shackleton', 'officer', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'Orde-Lees', 'regarding', 'stocking', 'up', 'seal', 'meat', 'Orde-Lees', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'cautious', 'kill', 'many', 'seals', 'possible', 'put', 'good', 'store', 'case', 'seals', 'should', 'disappear', 'should', 'be', 'stranded', 'longer', 'expected', 'Shackleton', 'strongly', 'opposed', 'doing', 'would', 'signal', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'reasonable', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'crucial', 'story', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'particularly', 'dangerous', 'incident', 'insubordination', 'carpenter', 'MacNeish', 'who', 'was', 'pacified', 'Shackelton', 'was', 'later', 'absolutely', 'vital', 'rescue', 'fitted', 'out', 'open-boat', 'James', 'Caird', 'travelled', 'South', 'Georgia', 'Island', 'kept', 'afloat', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'were', 'rescued', 'Shackleton', 'insisted', 'NOT', 'be', 'awarded', 'Polar', 'Medal', 'Shackleton', 'never', 'forgave', 'earlier', 'outburst', 'matter', 'how', 'important', 'cooperative', 'was', 'afterwards', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'almost', 'nothing', 'was', 'shown', 'open-boat', 'journey', 'Elephant', 'Island', 'South', 'Georgia', 'distance', 'over800', 'miles', 'stormiest', 'oceans', 'Earth', 'do', 'see', 'attempting', 'make', 'sun', 'sightings', 'order', 'determine', 'position', 'do', 'see', 'huge', 'waves', 'crash', 'boat', 'immense', 'difficulties', 'amazing', 'journey', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'NOT', 'described', 'example', 'need', 'get', 'very', 'accurate', 'fix', 'sun', 'position', 'violently', 'pitching', 'boat', 'frequently', 'cloudy', 'skies', 'position', 'was', 'not', 'determined', 'accurately', 'enough', 'could', 'miss', 'South', 'Georgia', 'small', 'island', 'end', 'up', 'middle', 'ocean', 'food', 'water', 'ran', 'out', 'Captain', 'Worsley', 'genius', 'knowing', 'how', 'where', 'steer', 'boat', 'not', 'mentioned', 'all.Finally', 'difficulties', 'men', 'left', 'behind', 'Elephant', 'Island', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'other', 'operation', 'performed', 'remove', 'one', 'man', 'frost-bitten', 'toes', 'Shackleton', 'said', 'expected', 'return', 'one', 'month', 'took', 'over', 'four', 'months', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'told', 'how', 'men', 'coped', 'immense', 'difficulties', 'Shackleton', 'had', 'returning', 'Last', 'Place', 'Earth', 'went', 'great', 'detail', 'explaining', 'differences', 'leadership', 'Amundsen', 'Scott', 'why', 'former', 'was', 'successful', 'later', 'died', 'returning', 'South', 'Pole', 'comparable', 'character', 'study', 'Shackleton', 'presented', 'here', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'overcome', 'immense', 'odds', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'avoid', 'what', 'happened', 'bitter', 'rival', 'Scott', 'spite', 'sharing', 'many', 'typical', 'British', 'attitudes', 'hampered', 'Polar', 'parties', 'opposed', 'more', 'flexible', 'Norweigians', 'Amundsen.Having', 'said', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'storyof', 'Endurance', 'so', 'compelling']",N/A

Before long, their ship was blocked before reaching shore, and then sunk (8 months later), by the mounting ice, and they started fighting for their survival.Even during the most depressing times, the men always trained the dogs, played soccer, and teased each other, waiting for somebody to rescue them.  But shackleton finally realised that only they would be able to save themselves.  He went on a colossal journey with a few men on a tiny boat, to save all the others that were still waiting.This is a story of courage, strength, endurance, and devotion that perhaps would never be matched again.  An extraordinary story of people who place there fate blindly in others, and of team spirit.The scenes also include many footages (B&W;) that were taken by the ship cameraman.

""The Making of Shackleton"" featurette is the least impressive of the extras, and it is certainly an above average example of the traditional look behind the scenes of the production on the ice flow in Greenland.  However, it is the Ernest Shackleton episode of A&E;'s ""Biography"" and the History Channel's ""Antarctica: A Frozen History"" that are impressive, especially since both incorporate the actual footage and photographs taken by Frank Hurley when the ""Endeavor"" was trapped in the ice during the failed Trans-Antarctic expedition in 1914-16.On one level it is hard for this mini-series to compete with those historic pictures: I almost felt as if the movie should have been in black & white as well, in the spirit of the same logic that dictated that approach in ""Schindler's List.""  Of course, here those images become real people trapped in a desperate quest for survival.  One advantage of watching the movie on DVD is that you do not have to endure all those commercial breaks, which certainly worked against the drama of 28 men trapped on the ice.  The cumulative feelings of hunger and despair should not be dispelled every ten minutes by commercials, otherwise your sense of empathy is hurt.Kenneth Branagh plays Shackleton without the Irish accent that marked him as a less than authentic British hero in some eyes, but the most important part of his characterization is the idea Shackleton is a flawed hero.  What stands out is the way that Branagh embodies the man's contradictions, going from dictatorial outbursts of anger to nonchalant moments of compassion.  As the situation worsens, Shackleton does whatever it takes to lead, whether by threats or examples or whatever else is needed.  ""Shackleton"" reminds me of a Greek tragedy, with the ensemble of actors making up the crew of the ""Endurance"" functioning very much like a Greek chorus, from which members emerge to engage the leader in a series of dramatic confrontations.  As much as he had to contend with the elements, there was the human dimension as well.If you have not yet seen the mini-series, I would even suggest that you watch MOST of the ""Biography"" episode.  Certainly it will give you a more detailed background on his life and career prior to the point that ""Shackleton"" begins.  So as soon as he prepares for the ""Endeavor"" trip you can switch over to the mini-series and complete his ""Biography"" when you have finished.

Yet there is another story to this film - how one man fought against self-doubt, the hostility of the authorities and the indifference of the public, ultimately to rise triumphant out of a difficult situation and prove his true worth.  I'm talking, ladies and gents, about the acting career of Kenneth Branagh.Branagh has been famous for ages but he has proved to be a mostly rotten film director.  His Shakespearean adaptations are heavy on attractive set dressing and star cameo appearances, but light on inventiveness, pace, spontaneity and even comprehensibility (his 'Hamlet' was a major offender, loaded with so many stars that despite thoughtful performances from the leads it ended up as a mere exercise in spotting who was going to turn up next), while his non-Shakespeare films (such as 'Peter's Friends', 'In The Bleak Midwinter' and the terrifyingly awful 'Dead Again') have not, on the whole, been much fun to sit through.Thankfully for us all, Branagh neither wrote nor directed this remarkable true story about the time-honoured English theme of Heroic Failure.  All he had to do was play Ernest Shackleton, one of the most appealing and sympathetic figures of the heroic age of Antarctic Exploration.  He is at the head of a heavyweight cast, including such excellent actors as Lorcan Cranitch as Shackleton's bluff and loyal right-hand man Frank Wild - nice to see this fine actor not playing a bad guy for a change; Phoebe Nicholls as the faithful but melancholy wife; Embeth Davidtz as the glamorous mistress; Kevin McNally, wonderful as the ship's master, an ineffectual leader of men but a phenomenally gifted navigator; Mark McGann slightly wasted as the ever-reliable Tom Crean.  It's up to Branagh to match all these, as well as Charles 'Brideshead Revisited' Sturridge's economical script and meticulous direction.  He does so, with panache to spare.Branagh has been so bad in so many of his own films for so long that it's become easy to think of him as a bad actor.  He is in fact a great actor, and he proved it with three very different films that were all made around the same time: this one, for Britain's Channel 4; Frank Pierson's 'Conspiracy', for HBO; and Michael Kalesniko's very funny comedy 'How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog'.  In each of these films, Branagh brought to unforgettable life a doggedly humane and relentlessly determined Antarctic explorer, a charming but entirely amoral Nazi officer, and a cynically funny English playwright living in Los Angeles.  He is one of the most enjoyable things about this movie, and don't let anyone tell you different.",5,Superb historical drama with some great acting,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,2786,"['story', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'grandiosely-named', 'Imperial', 'Trans-Antarctic', 'Expedition', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'summarise', 'here', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'story', 'film', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'fought', 'self-doubt', 'hostility', 'authorities', 'indifference', 'public', 'ultimately', 'rise', 'triumphant', 'difficult', 'situation', 'prove', 'true', 'worth', ""'m"", 'talking', 'ladies', 'gents', 'acting', 'career', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh.Branagh', 'been', 'famous', 'ages', 'proved', 'be', 'mostly', 'rotten', 'film', 'director', 'Shakespearean', 'adaptations', 'are', 'heavy', 'attractive', 'set', 'dressing', 'star', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'light', 'inventiveness', 'pace', 'spontaneity', 'even', 'comprehensibility', ""'Hamlet"", 'was', 'major', 'offender', 'loaded', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'thoughtful', 'performances', 'leads', 'ended', 'up', 'mere', 'exercise', 'spotting', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'up', 'next', 'non-Shakespeare', 'films', 'such', ""'Peter"", 'Friends', 'Bleak', 'Midwinter', 'terrifyingly', 'awful', 'Again', 'have', 'not', 'whole', 'been', 'much', 'fun', 'sit', 'through.Thankfully', 'Branagh', 'wrote', 'directed', 'remarkable', 'true', 'story', 'time-honoured', 'English', 'theme', 'Heroic', 'Failure', 'All', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'play', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'sympathetic', 'figures', 'heroic', 'age', 'Antarctic', 'Exploration', 'head', 'heavyweight', 'cast', 'including', 'such', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Lorcan', 'Cranitch', 'Shackleton', 'bluff', 'loyal', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Frank', 'Wild', 'nice', 'see', 'fine', 'actor', 'not', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'change', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'faithful', 'melancholy', 'wife', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'glamorous', 'mistress', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'wonderful', 'ship', 'master', 'ineffectual', 'leader', 'men', 'phenomenally', 'gifted', 'navigator', 'Mark', 'McGann', 'slightly', 'wasted', 'ever-reliable', 'Tom', 'Crean', 'up', 'Branagh', 'match', 'as', 'well', 'Charles', 'Revisited', 'Sturridge', 'economical', 'script', 'meticulous', 'direction', 'so', 'panache', 'spare.Branagh', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'own', 'films', 'so', 'long', 'become', 'easy', 'think', 'bad', 'actor', 'fact', 'great', 'actor', 'proved', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'Britain', 'Channel', '4', 'Frank', 'Pierson', ""'Conspiracy"", 'HBO', 'Michael', 'Kalesniko', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', ""'How"", 'Kill', 'Your', 'Neighbor', 'Dog', 'films', 'Branagh', 'brought', 'unforgettable', 'life', 'doggedly', 'humane', 'relentlessly', 'determined', 'Antarctic', 'explorer', 'charming', 'entirely', 'amoral', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'cynically', 'funny', 'English', 'playwright', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'things', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'different']",N/A
695864,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000063TON,maskirovka,"[3, 3]","I purchased this DVD series because I am going on a cruise to Antarctica, and I have long been aware of Ernest Shackleton and the men of the Endurance's incredible survival against all odds in the most merciless and unforgiving environments imaginable.  I had tried watching when it was first broadcast, but for some reason, I found it boring and gave up on it.But what a difference a couple of years make!  This time around I found ""Shackleton"" a fantastic miniseries with the production values of a major motion picture.  Kenneth Brannagh is absolutely spot on in the title role (so what if he can't do a brogue, his English accent is fine).  The supporting cast is excellent with particularly strong performances by the Endurance's sailing master, his loyal lieutenant Frank, and the ship's carpenter.  When you combine the fine performances of Brannagh and the others with the utterly compelling story and the fact most of the scenes really take place at sea amidst genuine icebergs (it was filmed in Greenland), there really isn't much more for which you can ask.Particular high-points for me were Shackleton angrily pledging to bring everyone of his men back alive (nicely bookended by the scene of him coming to the rescue of his men on Elephant Island) and the eerily beautiful scenes on the Endurance when the ship was frozen in the pack ice during the Antarctic night.So I would heartily encourage anyone who likes a fantastic but true story against insurmountable odds to buy this miniseries.  After you watch ""Shackleton,"" though, don't forget to get ""the Last Place on Earth,"" which pays proper tribute to a different kind of great explorer, Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian who got first to the South Pole while his British competitor Robert Falcon Scott (unlike Shackleton in just about every possible way) got himself and his entire team of men killed to come in second place.",5,A fantastic story of leadership and endurance,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1889,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'series', 'am', 'going', 'cruise', 'Antarctica', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'aware', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'men', 'Endurance', 'incredible', 'survival', 'odds', 'most', 'merciless', 'unforgiving', 'environments', 'imaginable', 'had', 'tried', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'reason', 'found', 'boring', 'gave', 'up', 'it.But', 'what', 'difference', 'couple', 'years', 'make', 'time', 'found', 'Shackleton', 'fantastic', 'miniseries', 'production', 'values', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'absolutely', 'spot', 'title', 'role', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'brogue', 'English', 'accent', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'strong', 'performances', 'Endurance', 'sailing', 'master', 'loyal', 'lieutenant', 'Frank', 'ship', 'carpenter', 'When', 'combine', 'fine', 'performances', 'Brannagh', 'others', 'utterly', 'compelling', 'story', 'fact', 'most', 'scenes', 'really', 'take', 'place', 'sea', 'amidst', 'genuine', 'icebergs', 'was', 'filmed', 'Greenland', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'can', 'ask.Particular', 'high-points', 'were', 'Shackleton', 'angrily', 'pledging', 'bring', 'everyone', 'men', 'back', 'alive', 'nicely', 'bookended', 'scene', 'coming', 'rescue', 'men', 'Elephant', 'Island', 'eerily', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Endurance', 'when', 'ship', 'was', 'frozen', 'pack', 'ice', 'Antarctic', 'night.So', 'would', 'heartily', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'fantastic', 'true', 'story', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'buy', 'miniseries', 'watch', 'Shackleton', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'get', 'Last', 'Place', 'Earth', 'proper', 'tribute', 'different', 'kind', 'great', 'explorer', 'Roald', 'Amundsen', 'Norwegian', 'who', 'got', 'first', 'South', 'Pole', 'British', 'competitor', 'Robert', 'Falcon', 'Scott', 'Shackleton', 'just', 'possible', 'way', 'got', 'entire', 'team', 'men', 'killed', 'come', 'second', 'place']",N/A

Which should tell you something about the film's watchability right there. The Conspiracy movie was another acting masterclass, with Sir Branagh playing the role of Nazi top dog (Heidrich) with a smooth, efficient  politeness, commonly associated with board level executives. But this is even better.Although the Branagh's presence is one of the film's main draws, the whole production is BBC-flagship, top-of-the-line all the way. Pornography for Merchant Ivory fans. It was director Charles Sturridge, let us not forget, who guided us through the wonder that was Brideshead Revisited (1983), the benchmark against which all other costume dramas - this one included - will be matched.Shackleton is set in 1911, at a time when polar exploration was at its most intense (with bitter rivalries, shameless falsification of logbooks, etc.), etc. This is the stuff of all boy's books in Britain throughout the most of the 20th century (fans of Michael Palin's excellent Ripping Yarns series will know what I'm talking about).  Along with Raoul Amundsen, Sir Walter Scott, Shackleton was a major player in this area, with a brace of successful arctic and Antarctic expeditions already under his belt. But this expedition was going to be the big one. Crossing the Antarctic. Unfortunately some bright spark decided to start World War One, casting into jeopardy the undertaking that was going to satisfy Sir Earnest Shackleton's vainglorious designs for ever.It's a fabulous film.

695870,A13D1WTFEMS9VH,B000063TON,Scorpio69,"[35, 36]","This movie, combined with the generous bonus material, is a genuine bargain for those wishing to augment their reading on Shackleton's epic Antarctic survival story. It cannot be used as a primary source for learning about it, however.For that, I highly recommend 'Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage' by Alfred Lansing.Lansing used the diaries of the men as his primary source, along with interviews of expedition survivors. The result is a much more detailed understanding of all of the men and how they came to be chosen so intuitively by Shackleton, using his unerring sense of not only their particular skills but how they would all work together as a team. Also, it gives one a much better sense than the movie of their interrelationships as the hardships mounted and the sheer length and depth of their struggle to survive. By being able to go well beyond what a necessarily time-limited (and budget-limited) dramatic production can encompass, one is drawn much deeper into the day-to-day struggles the expedition faced and the truly heroic nature of the effort put forth by all - particularly Shackleton. Where the movie gives short shrift to perhaps the most unbelievable part of the entire adventure - the voyage of Shackleton and a few of the men from Elephant Island to South Georgia in a small boat - Lansing's book allows us to relive the sheer terror and utter exhaustion and deprivation the men faced. The movie spent far too much time dwelling on the pre-voyage quest for financial backing and the fairly irrelevant sub-plots about wife and mistress - which, most certainly, had absolutely nothing to do with 'The Greatest Survival Story of All Time'. There was also precious little detail in the movie about the many, many months the men spent on the pack ice, then on Elephant Island while Shackleton made his way to South Georgia and back, and the means they all used to stay alive and relatively sane in their respective situations. Also, Shackleton's astounding mountaineering feat in the crossing of South Georgia to the whaling station was not given its proper due - truly an incredible accomplishment in its own right.The movie is, however, quite well done and the actors are very good and well cast. A bigger budget production could perhaps have better captured the daunting scope of the challenges faced by the expedition, but it would have had to be many hours longer.All in all, when you take into account the bonus extras - the A&E; biography of Shackleton and the 2-hour History Channel production on the exploration of Antarctica - it's pretty hard to beat this DVD set.Just make sure you read Lansing's wonderful account to really get the full flavor of the incredible hardships and sheer terror faced by Shackleton and his men, because you just won't get that from this movie.",4,There were giants on the earth in those days...,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2816,"['movie', 'combined', 'generous', 'bonus', 'material', 'genuine', 'bargain', 'wishing', 'augment', 'reading', 'Shackleton', 'epic', 'Antarctic', 'survival', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'primary', 'source', 'learning', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'Endurance"", 'Shackleton', 'Incredible', 'Voyage', 'Alfred', 'Lansing.Lansing', 'used', 'diaries', 'men', 'primary', 'source', 'interviews', 'expedition', 'survivors', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'understanding', 'men', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'chosen', 'so', 'intuitively', 'Shackleton', 'using', 'unerring', 'sense', 'not', 'only', 'particular', 'skills', 'how', 'would', 'work', 'together', 'team', 'Also', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'movie', 'interrelationships', 'hardships', 'mounted', 'sheer', 'length', 'depth', 'struggle', 'survive', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'well', 'what', 'necessarily', 'time-limited', 'budget-limited', 'dramatic', 'production', 'can', 'encompass', 'one', 'drawn', 'much', 'deeper', 'day-to-day', 'expedition', 'faced', 'truly', 'heroic', 'nature', 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'particularly', 'Shackleton', 'Where', 'movie', 'short', 'shrift', 'perhaps', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'entire', 'adventure', 'voyage', 'Shackleton', 'few', 'men', 'Elephant', 'Island', 'South', 'Georgia', 'small', 'boat', 'Lansing', 'book', 'relive', 'sheer', 'terror', 'utter', 'exhaustion', 'deprivation', 'men', 'faced', 'movie', 'spent', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'dwelling', 'pre-voyage', 'quest', 'financial', 'backing', 'fairly', 'irrelevant', 'sub-plots', 'wife', 'mistress', 'most', 'certainly', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', ""'The"", 'Greatest', 'Survival', 'Story', 'All', 'Time', 'was', 'also', 'precious', 'little', 'detail', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'months', 'men', 'spent', 'pack', 'ice', 'then', 'Elephant', 'Island', 'Shackleton', 'made', 'way', 'South', 'Georgia', 'back', 'means', 'used', 'stay', 'alive', 'relatively', 'sane', 'respective', 'situations', 'Also', 'Shackleton', 'astounding', 'mountaineering', 'feat', 'crossing', 'South', 'Georgia', 'whaling', 'station', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'proper', 'due', 'truly', 'incredible', 'accomplishment', 'own', 'right.The', 'movie', 'however', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'cast', 'A', 'bigger', 'budget', 'production', 'could', 'perhaps', 'have', 'better', 'captured', 'daunting', 'scope', 'challenges', 'faced', 'expedition', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'be', 'many', 'hours', 'longer.All', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'bonus', 'extras', 'A', 'E', 'biography', 'Shackleton', '2-hour', 'History', 'Channel', 'production', 'exploration', 'Antarctica', 'pretty', 'hard', 'beat', 'DVD', 'set.Just', 'make', 'sure', 'read', 'Lansing', 'wonderful', 'account', 'really', 'get', 'full', 'flavor', 'incredible', 'hardships', 'sheer', 'terror', 'faced', 'Shackleton', 'men', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie']",N/A

Davis,"[3, 3]","Kenneth Branagh brings his customary swagger to this portrayal of the British adventurer Ernest Shackleton, together with a first-class supporting cast. Perfectly arrayed in Edwardian period costumes and sets, the story starts with the Antarctic veteran and lecturer learning that Roald Amundson has become the first person to reach the South Pole. He decides to one-up the Norwegian with the first trans-Antarctic expedition. The film follows Shackleton as he raises money, selects a crew, and carries on a love affair that his wife discovers. But he soon leaves both wife and paramour for his irresistable compulsion to conquer the unknown.Shackleton and his men travel to Argentina and thence to Antarctica via the aptly-named sailing ship Endurance. It becomes trapped in the ice of the Weddell Sea for nearly a year before it is crushed. The men recover what they can before the ship goes down, then camp on the drifting floes for months while killing their dogs for food. They finally set off on foot, pulling lifeboats and supplies through ghastly weather until the ice starts to break up. After five days at sea, they reach Elephant Island, but it is far from shipping lanes. The groups' chances of discovery or rescue are extremely slim.Their leader determines that they must save themselves by attempting an incredibly risky 800-mile open-sea crossing to South Georgia Island. After two weeks of fierce storms, they make the island by dint of exceptional navigation, but even then, their survival depends on trudging across its mountains to find a whaling station. These scenes are interwoven with scenes at home in Britain, where friends and family wait anxiously and where rescue missions are proposed but never undertaken, as the ongoing carnage of World War I makes the fate of 28 men seem small by comparison.Shackleton himself comes across as something of a glib promoter, an ambitious man drawn by fame and glory. Yet when his back is to the wall, he proves that he is not just a great explorer but also an outstanding judge of character and an indomitable leader of men. His charisma and motivational abilities literally save his expedition-mates, allowing them to come home after three incredible years, long after most Britons have given them up for dead, with nary a life lost (though three men died in a separate expedition that left supply depots for Shackleton).The script draws much of its dialog and detail from the diaries and letters of crewmen, who survived a harrowing journey through an amazing combination of strength, courage, resourcefulness, and sheer determination. The production values are superb, worthy of a theatrical feature film, and the cinematography, based on the documentary pictures and films of the expedition's photographer, is breathtaking. The outdoor scenes were shot in Greenland using a full reconstruction of The Endurance. You truly feel the bitter cold and exhaustion of the men, and their survival seems nothing short of a miracle.The first two discs in this three-disc set contain only the 206-minute Emmy-winning made-for-television miniseries, without so much as a commentary or a subtitle, but the third disc holds three worthwhile documentaries.

The scenery was spectacular as well as the music.Great acting by Kenneth Branagh. A nice third DVD with The Making of Shackleton, Biography Ernest Shackleton and Antarctica A Frozen History. My ultimate highest rating 5 stars PLUS for this 3 DVD set. You will not find a better true survival story. Can't wait to read the book Endurance.",5,Truly the ultimate survival story.

Have read about Shackleton I was struck over and over at how poorly he was conveyed, reduced to a shallow, yelling, man, when he was in fact calm, cool, and collected.  How did the script writers fail to realize that a man who cannot control himself cannot control his men and the Shackleton story is in essence a study of successful leadership under extreme conditionsThe movie contains some absolutely fantastic footage, however, I could never settle down and enjoy the film as I desired because so many factual errors kept being presented.  Shackleton was assisted by very able men and the film belittles most of them into little more than a mob of frightened men.  There was much wonderful stuff here - don't get me wrong, but if you actually know the story - have read the books - then turn off your brain before watching or it will drive you crazy!2 stars for attention to set details and 2 stars for great cinematography, however, I took away 1 star for failure to present Shackleton as he was.  Perhaps it was their desire to humanize the man that lead to this.  Unfortunately Shackleton really was a larger than life figure - a man - not unlike some other well known men like George Patton, or Oscar Schindler - men who were uniquely suited for an extreme situation and excelled like no other men could have.",4,Everything you could want as long as the truth about Shackleton doesn't matter to you.,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1447,"['Gloriously', 'filmed', 'excellent', 'acting', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'as', 'long', 'truth', 'Shackleton', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Have', 'read', 'Shackleton', 'was', 'struck', 'over', 'how', 'poorly', 'was', 'conveyed', 'reduced', 'shallow', 'yelling', 'man', 'when', 'was', 'fact', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'How', 'did', 'script', 'writers', 'fail', 'realize', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'men', 'Shackleton', 'story', 'essence', 'study', 'successful', 'leadership', 'extreme', 'conditionsThe', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'footage', 'however', 'could', 'never', 'settle', 'down', 'enjoy', 'film', 'desired', 'because', 'so', 'many', 'factual', 'errors', 'kept', 'being', 'presented', 'Shackleton', 'was', 'assisted', 'very', 'able', 'men', 'film', 'most', 'little', 'more', 'mob', 'frightened', 'men', 'was', 'much', 'wonderful', 'stuff', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'actually', 'know', 'story', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'then', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'watching', 'will', 'drive', 'crazy', '2', 'stars', 'attention', 'set', 'details', '2', 'stars', 'great', 'cinematography', 'however', 'took', 'away', '1', 'star', 'failure', 'present', 'Shackleton', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'desire', 'humanize', 'man', 'lead', 'Unfortunately', 'Shackleton', 'really', 'was', 'larger', 'life', 'figure', 'man', 'not', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'men', 'George', 'Patton', 'Oscar', 'Schindler', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'uniquely', 'suited', 'extreme', 'situation', 'excelled', 'other', 'men', 'could', 'have']",N/A
