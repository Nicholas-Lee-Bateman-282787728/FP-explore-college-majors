But like Seabiscuit, getting past a quick initial glance will find a racer with the will of champion.Released in 1978, director Bryan Forbes tackles the sequel to National Velvet with a keen eye on a compelling script. Nanette Newman (a grown-up Velvet)and Tatum O'Neal (her niece) are wonderful in their roles, with the storyline centering on the niece striving to become an Olympic-caliber rider.Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays a veteran trainer who has seen many riders boast about such goals, but end up falling away when the going gets difficult. He has a special eye for talent, though, and there just may be unique potential with this young rider.These are four movies which families can enjoy together, but the life lessons can be appreciated by adults, as much as children.",5,Three Classics And One Longshot On The Board,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,925,"['three', 'classic', 'would', 'appear', 'tote', 'board', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'call', 'International', 'Velvet', 'longshot', 'can', 'be', 'dismissed', 'Seabiscuit', 'getting', 'quick', 'initial', 'glance', 'will', 'find', 'racer', 'will', 'champion.Released', '1978', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'sequel', 'National', 'Velvet', 'keen', 'eye', 'compelling', 'script', 'Nanette', 'Newman', 'grown-up', 'Velvet', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'niece', 'are', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'storyline', 'centering', 'niece', 'striving', 'become', 'Olympic-caliber', 'rider.Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'veteran', 'trainer', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'riders', 'boast', 'such', 'goals', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'away', 'when', 'going', 'difficult', 'special', 'eye', 'talent', 'though', 'there', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'unique', 'potential', 'young', 'rider.These', 'are', 'four', 'movies', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'life', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'adults', 'as', 'much', 'children']","4 Film Favorites: Classic Horse Films (Black Beauty, National Velvet, International Velvet, The Story of Seabiscuit)"

1093277,A1K4AVQIU704DY,B000U1ZV58,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[35, 36]","My sister had given me Black Beauty on VHS and I must have watched that half a dozen times. It begins with Black Beauty in his final home, then shifts back to his birth and gentling. It was cute to see how oats  helped him deal with the bit and girth. It does take place in England, as opposed to the NBC mini-series that took place in Maryland. In  Black Beuaty, there is a voice for him, but not for the other horses. When he is sold to Squire Gordon he meets Ginger and Merrylegs, and is paired with Ginger to drive the carriage. When the squire's wife takes ill, Beauty and Ginger are sold, and so begins the many owners he has to deal with until in the end the grown-up Joe Green (the young lad who nearly killed him) gives him his last home. The Story of Seabiscuit stars Barry Fitzgerald, whom I take to be a real Irishman and Shirley Temple, who is not Irish. The subject is a small-sized, non-inspiring colt named Seabiscuit who catches Uncle Shawn's eye and, over initial objections, convinces his boss to keep him and let him train him for the racetrack. After a very unpromising start, the colt begins to win, and win, and win, and, in a match race against Sir Barton, shows the bigger horse his heels. A rags-to-riches story that ended with Shawn having the last laugh on the two who had written the little fellow off. National Velvet has been around for so long if you haven't seen it, you just don't watch horse movies. I loved the pairing of Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, and the exciting running of the Grand National. International Velvet was such a superb sequel in my opinion I was put out by the lack of recognition it received. Christopher Plummer, Sherlock Holmes in Murder by Decree, was so good as ""Uncle"" John, and poor Velvet was at a loss in dealing with the rebelious Sharah until they discovered her love for horses. That scene where Velvet asks Sarah to go fetch the Pie, only to have Sarah realize that it is not the Pie, but her foal, and to have the two running toward each other, is beautiful. To watch an awkward young Sarah become an accomplished rider, under the guidance of Captain Johnson, played by the dashing Anthony Hopkins, and represent her country (she was born in England) in the Olympics was fascinating. To think the actress was able to learn to ride as she did over those jumps was quite an achievement. The ending, when Sarah makes her way over the mud to where Velvet and John were waiting, and introduce them to her fiancee Scott as ""my parents,"" just made my heart soar.",5,A Fabulous Foursome,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2531,"['sister', 'had', 'given', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'VHS', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'dozen', 'times', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'final', 'home', 'then', 'back', 'birth', 'gentling', 'was', 'cute', 'see', 'how', 'oats', 'helped', 'deal', 'bit', 'girth', 'take', 'place', 'England', 'opposed', 'NBC', 'mini-series', 'took', 'place', 'Maryland', 'Black', 'Beuaty', 'voice', 'not', 'other', 'horses', 'When', 'sold', 'Squire', 'Gordon', 'Ginger', 'Merrylegs', 'paired', 'Ginger', 'drive', 'carriage', 'When', 'squire', 'wife', 'ill', 'Beauty', 'Ginger', 'are', 'sold', 'so', 'many', 'owners', 'deal', 'end', 'grown-up', 'Joe', 'Green', 'young', 'lad', 'who', 'nearly', 'killed', 'last', 'home', 'Story', 'Seabiscuit', 'stars', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'whom', 'take', 'be', 'real', 'Irishman', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'who', 'not', 'Irish', 'subject', 'small-sized', 'non-inspiring', 'colt', 'named', 'Seabiscuit', 'who', 'Uncle', 'Shawn', 'eye', 'initial', 'objections', 'boss', 'keep', 'let', 'train', 'racetrack', 'very', 'unpromising', 'start', 'colt', 'win', 'win', 'win', 'match', 'race', 'Sir', 'Barton', 'bigger', 'horse', 'heels', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'ended', 'Shawn', 'having', 'last', 'laugh', 'two', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'little', 'fellow', 'off', 'National', 'Velvet', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'horse', 'movies', 'loved', 'pairing', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'exciting', 'running', 'Grand', 'National', 'International', 'Velvet', 'was', 'such', 'superb', 'sequel', 'opinion', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'lack', 'recognition', 'received', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Murder', 'Decree', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Uncle', 'John', 'poor', 'Velvet', 'was', 'loss', 'dealing', 'rebelious', 'Sharah', 'discovered', 'love', 'horses', 'scene', 'where', 'Velvet', 'Sarah', 'go', 'fetch', 'Pie', 'only', 'have', 'Sarah', 'realize', 'not', 'Pie', 'foal', 'have', 'two', 'running', 'other', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'awkward', 'young', 'Sarah', 'become', 'accomplished', 'rider', 'guidance', 'Captain', 'Johnson', 'played', 'dashing', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'represent', 'country', 'was', 'born', 'England', 'Olympics', 'was', 'fascinating', 'think', 'actress', 'was', 'able', 'learn', 'ride', 'did', 'jumps', 'was', 'quite', 'achievement', 'ending', 'when', 'Sarah', 'way', 'mud', 'where', 'Velvet', 'John', 'were', 'waiting', 'introduce', 'fiancee', 'Scott', 'parents', 'just', 'made', 'heart', 'soar']","4 Film Favorites: Classic Horse Films (Black Beauty, National Velvet, International Velvet, The Story of Seabiscuit)"
