969631,A2WFNZWC8O6O1J,B000E6ESBW,Atticus,"[0, 0]","Season 3 of REBA is a miraculous TV-watching experience.  This may be one of the best seasons of the series, coming from a person who has seen almost every REBA episode.  The acting and writing in this season is pin-point, and while Season 1 establishes the plot and Season 4 introduces a lot of the drama, Season 3 is REBA at its comedic best.Everyone knows that there are so many run-of-the-mill comedy series on TV, and you can't imagine how much of a thrill it is when a series of this originality and hilarity comes along.  REBA, for those of you who don't know, stars singer Reba McEntire as a woman who's husband Brock (Chritopher Rich) left her for ditzy, heart-in-the-right-place Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman).  Also, Reba's daughter Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) and her husband Van (Steve Howey) were pregnant as teenagers, and younger kids Kyra (Scarlett Pompers) and Jake (Mitch Holleman) oftentimes get stuck in the middle.  However, all of that happened in Season 1.  This third season of REBA comes at a time when the family has just started to function at a level that is just barely functional, but before the end of the season, almost everything falls apart again.The acting ranges from near-perfect to perfect in every episode, and the talented cast, both young and old, make the series ten times funnier than it would be on paper alone.  Delivery is almost everything, and this cast has extraordinary chemistry.  The script is always witty and smart, and every episode will make you laugh out loud, as well as warm your heart.The DVD release is above average, but not great.  The special features are minimal, but the picture quality is exceptional.  All in all, Season 3 of REBA is a must-own for fans of the series, die-hard and casual.  And, for anyone looking for a place to start, it might be a good sample.",5,"Reba's Back with a Hilarious, Heartwarming Vengeance!",1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1829,"['Season', '3', 'REBA', 'miraculous', 'TV-watching', 'experience', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'series', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'seen', 'almost', 'REBA', 'episode', 'acting', 'writing', 'season', 'pin-point', 'Season', '1', 'plot', 'Season', '4', 'lot', 'drama', 'Season', '3', 'REBA', 'comedic', 'best.Everyone', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'run-of-the-mill', 'comedy', 'series', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'thrill', 'when', 'series', 'originality', 'hilarity', 'along', 'REBA', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stars', 'singer', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'Brock', 'Chritopher', 'Rich', 'left', 'ditzy', 'heart-in-the-right-place', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'Melissa', 'Peterman', 'Also', 'Reba', 'daughter', 'Cheyenne', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'husband', 'Van', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'were', 'pregnant', 'teenagers', 'younger', 'kids', 'Kyra', 'Scarlett', 'Pompers', 'Jake', 'Mitch', 'Holleman', 'get', 'stuck', 'middle', 'However', 'happened', 'Season', '1', 'third', 'season', 'REBA', 'time', 'when', 'family', 'just', 'started', 'function', 'level', 'just', 'barely', 'functional', 'end', 'season', 'almost', 'everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'again.The', 'acting', 'ranges', 'near-perfect', 'perfect', 'episode', 'talented', 'cast', 'young', 'old', 'make', 'series', 'times', 'funnier', 'would', 'be', 'paper', 'alone', 'Delivery', 'almost', 'everything', 'cast', 'extraordinary', 'chemistry', 'script', 'always', 'witty', 'smart', 'episode', 'will', 'make', 'loud', 'as', 'well', 'warm', 'heart.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'above', 'average', 'not', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'minimal', 'picture', 'quality', 'exceptional', 'Season', '3', 'REBA', 'must-own', 'fans', 'series', 'die-hard', 'casual', 'anyone', 'looking', 'place', 'start', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'sample']",Reba - Season 3

Meanwhile, another blow struck as Reba discovered her 17-year-old daughter Cheyanne was also expecting.Now, the third year focuses upon teenage parents Cheyanne (Joanna Garcia) and Van (Steve Howey), who live in Reba's house with their baby daughter Elizabeth. The two are truly unequipped for the real world, and constantly come up against blows from the workforce and college. After a great deal of heartache, Cheyanne is settling down in her role as mom and student, while Van's been recruited by professional football.There's also little Henry, the son of Brock and Barbra Jean. While Reba would love to forget the very existence of the baby -- as well as his clueless, ditzy mother -- for some inane reason Barbra Jean is determined to become her new best friend.Meanwhile, Brock's abruptly decided he would rather be a professional golfer than a dentist, and smart, sarcastic middle child Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) acts out from the pressures of being the only sane person around. After moving out of her mother's home at the end of Season 2, she was certain things would get better...but Kyra never realized that life with her dad and Barbra Jean carries its own problems.What's a woman to do? Most in Reba's situation would fall apart, but not her. Even when things are at their darkest, Reba's wit allows her to laugh and see the good -- though in no way is her character, or the show, sappy or sentimental.
