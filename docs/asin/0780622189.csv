31134,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,0780622189,D.P.,"[0, 0]","Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one which was WCW's SuperBrawl VIII. The WCW Championship was held up due to the controversial finish of two matches between Sting & Hollywood Hogan resulting in Commissioner Roddy Piper declaring that the final match would happen & there must be a winner, the Steiner Brothers were having their share of problems with Scott Steiner showing a more arrogant side of himself where he kept shoving referees & refusing to tag his brother in during tag matches, and Randy Savage had so many issues with his fellow nWo members that he had become the ""rebel"" & had no alliances within the nWo.WCW Television Champion Rick Martel vs. Booker T - This was a rematch from the previous Nitro when Martel won the Television Title after chasing it for close to two months. Both men came out more aggressive than usual in a match that went very fast paced & high impact with Martel attempted to work over Booker's back with moves such as a powerslam, spinebuster, and the Quebec (Boston) Crab. However this match didn't turn out the way both men planned as Martel tore a ligament in his knee leading it to be cut short with Booker T winning the championship only to be attacked by Perry Saturn afterwards to...WCW Television Champion Booker T vs. Perry Saturn - ...being the next match which was set to be Saturn challenging the winner. Knowing how Booker was already exhausted from the previous match, Saturn kept trying to go for quick wins via rollups & even the Rings Of Saturn submission. Booker was heavily on the defensive throughout the match as Saturn dominated & kept taking the match to the floor numerous times for Booker to make a last minute recovery & get the win in one of the most standout nights of his career.La Parka vs. Disco Infernio - Unfortunately the copy I had of this event had this match edited out so I wasn't able to watch so I can't comment on this match.Goldberg vs. Brad Armstrong - This was your typical Golberg squash that was only here to add to what would go down as ""The Streak""WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Juventud Guerrera - This was around 2 months into Chris Jericho's best run in his WCW career that showcased the personality that we've all known him for today. The stipulation here was that Juventud must not just win the match but win the championship or unmask. With the stipulation, not only did both men put on the performance that we expect & praised the crusierweight division for but also had Jericho try to use the stipulation to his advantage in unique (and comedic) ways such as purposely trying to get counted out at one point.[Rise & Fall Of WCW; Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]British Bulldog vs. Steve McMichael - After these two kept having confrontations with each other for weeks, they finally squared off here in a match that honestly wasn't anything more than average with the story of Mongo losing by submission via a hurt wrist although he kept claiming that he didn't give up.WCW United States Champion Dallas Page vs. Chris Benoit - This match wasn't based off hatred or a bitter rivalry more than just both men wanted to see who is the better man with them coming out very aggressive & were able to avoid each others signature moves in the beginning of the match. Both men started off showing respect in the beginning but became a brawl with both trading first & slaps to the point where they beat each other into exhaustion such as DDP delivering a superplex on Benoit at one point that took both men out with Page later gaining the victory with a unique variation of his Diamond Cutter. This is one of those strong performances by both men where everyone comes out looking stronger than they went in regardless of who won & who lost.No Disqualification Match: Lex Luger vs. Randy Savage - Luger came in with his ribs taped which heavily effected his usual power offense as he wasn't able to slam Savage early in the match which made it an easy target for Savage to attack with kicks & stomps. Savage kept tossing Luger to the outside & hitting the guardrail before taking the fight into the crowd briefly with Elizabeth getting involved whenever Luger was starting to mount a comeback. The bigger story here was when the nWo came out only for not only Luger to fight them off but also fellow nWo member Savage before Hogan called the nWo back causing Luger to gain the victory thanks to the distraction. The match didn't go long but was more about the continued issues between the nWo & their rebel member in Savage.WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Outsiders - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as this was all about the birth of ""Big Poppa Pump"" Scott Steiner & the end of the Steiner Brothers (for that time).[Rise & Fall Of WCW]WCW Championship Match: Sting vs. Hollywood Hogan - After the controversial ending of the more famous Starrcade match between these two and the rematch they had the next night on Nitro, this was the match to determine the vacant WCW Champion with the rules heavily relaxed as this was set to be one fall to a finish. This was a very aggressive fight as Hogan was cheating (including using his weight belt as a weapon) & kept bad mouthing Sting before Sting came back & got his receipts with the weight belt. As expected, the nWo members did make an appearance but it was one specific member who would be the difference maker in this match helping WCW gain their championship back & had their own spray painted celebration.[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]This was one of those WCW events where it looked loaded up on paper but when it was played out, there was only a small amount of quality on this card. It had it's share of matches there were either fillers or not anything special (Goldberg, La Parka/Disco, Bulldog/Mongo) while others were reduced to only about pushing storylines over the action itself (Outsiders/Steiners & Luger/Savage) but it did have it's moments (Booker T's back to back performances, DDP/Benoit, Jericho/Juventud, Sting/Hogan making up for their lackluster Starrcade match). If you don't already have the best matches on DVD (Hogan/Sting & Jericho/Juventud) can't find the others on YouTube then I would suggest getting this.",3,Sting vs. Hogan...THERE MUST BE A

31135,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,0780622189,Ervin Griffin,"[1, 1]","Coming on two months after the disaster known as Starrcade '97, WCW (for once) got down to business and actually put on a great card here! Let's get to it:Booker T. Vs. Rick Martel (WCW World TV Title Match) - The winner of this match would have to face Perry Saturn immediately afterwards! Booker was just beginning his solo career here and he had a great match with the former ""Model"" and AWA Champion! Booker wins but is immediately jumped by Saturn!Booker T. Vs. Perry Saturn (WCW TV Title Match) - This match was more of a showcase of Saturn but it also showed the courage of Booker (which we would see again during his famous Best Of 7 Series with Chris Benoit later that year). Despite being spent from his bout with Martel, Booker somehow pulled out a win at the end with one of his patended sidekicks. I would dare say Booker's performances in both bouts nearly stoled the show here! With due respect to Dean Malenko Vs. Eddie Guerrero at Starrcade, I wish THIS could've been the opener there!Anyway, a spetacular opening to Superbrawl!Disco Inferno Vs. La Parka - After such a strong opening, we needed a little comedy relief and that's what we got here with D.I. and ""The Chair-man Of WCW."" Ends when D.I. hits his ""Chartbuster"" (Stone Cold Stunner) on La Parka for the win.Bill Goldberg Vs. Brad Armstrong - One of Goldberg's early appearances and it was very impressive as this was pretty much a squash on Armstrong. Too bad he didn't get more training. Goldberg could've been one of the best ever and this match shows glimpses of the potential in-ring greatness he could've had. Granted, he had a great career anyway but it could've been so much better!Chris Jericho Vs. Juventud Guerrera (WCW Cruiserweight Title Vs. Mask) - Jericho's WCW Cruiserweight belt was on the line Vs. Juventud's mask. After some great back and forth action both in the air and on the mat, Jericho finally took the match with his ""Liontamer"" (Walls Of Jericho) boston crab for the submission. Juvi then unmasked and has (more or less) wrestled unmasked since.The British Bulldog Vs. Steve McMichael - The late Davey Boy Smith was a great wrestler who could put on a good to great match with nearly anyone. Steve McMichael WASN'T one of those guys! Very slow and ends with a legit injury to McMichael.Chris Benoit Vs. Diamond Dallas Page (WCW U.S. Title Match) - Long before his death and infamous status, Chris Benoit was a highly regarded and very popular technical wrestler that could have a good to great match with nearly anyone. DDP was another that benefitted from meeting the then ""Crippler"" as they had a very good title match. DDP wins after slipping in his ""Diamond Cutter"" on Benoit.I find the ending a bit ironic since Randy Orton defeated Benoit in a similiar fashion as SummerSlam 2004! LOL!Lex Luger Vs. Randy Savage (No DQ Match) - Very dull bout and the worst on the card. It was basically building the drama of Savage leaving the nWo. Nothing more. Ends with Luger getting the submission with his ""Human Torture Rack"" backbreaker.Scott Hall/Kevin Nash Vs. The Steiner Bros. - (WCW World Tag Team Title Match) - This match is significant only because this is the first full blown glimpse into the new character of Scott Steiner, which would be later known as ""Big Poppa Pump"", as he turned on his brother Rick and pretty much handed The Outsiders the tag titles.Sting Vs. ""Hollywood"" Hulk Hogan (WCW World Title Match) - THIS HEAVILY MAKES UP FOR THE STARRCADE FIASCO! This match had all the action and drama that the Starrcade bout should've had! Even the run ins by the nWo couldn't dampen this match. Ends when Randy Savage actually clocks Hogan with a spray can, allowing Sting to get the pin and the title!Overall, this WCW tape is worth getting and keeping! It showed what WCW could've done with better marketing and people that actually knew wrestling rather than suits who THOUGHT they knew wrestling or veterans that worked angles that only benefitted themselves rather than the company or even the business! True, you should look out for yourself first BUT at some point, you have to put your own ego aside and think of the bigger picture.Anyway, this WCW card is actually worth hunting down and getting!",5,This Is What Starrcade '97 SHOULD'VE Been Like!,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,4222,"['Coming', 'two', 'months', 'disaster', 'known', 'Starrcade', ""'97"", 'WCW', 'once', 'got', 'down', 'business', 'actually', 'put', 'great', 'card', 'here', 'Let', 'get', 'Booker', 'T.', 'Vs.', 'Rick', 'Martel', 'WCW', 'World', 'TV', 'Title', 'Match', 'winner', 'match', 'would', 'have', 'face', 'Perry', 'Saturn', 'immediately', 'Booker', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'solo', 'career', 'here', 'had', 'great', 'match', 'former', 'Model', 'AWA', 'Champion', 'Booker', 'wins', 'immediately', 'jumped', 'Saturn', 'Booker', 'T.', 'Vs.', 'Perry', 'Saturn', 'WCW', 'TV', 'Title', 'Match', 'match', 'was', 'more', 'showcase', 'Saturn', 'also', 'showed', 'courage', 'Booker', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'famous', 'Best', '7', 'Series', 'Chris', 'Benoit', 'later', 'year', 'being', 'spent', 'bout', 'Martel', 'Booker', 'somehow', 'pulled', 'out', 'win', 'end', 'one', 'patended', 'sidekicks', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'Booker', 'performances', 'bouts', 'nearly', 'stoled', 'show', 'here', 'due', 'respect', 'Dean', 'Malenko', 'Vs.', 'Eddie', 'Guerrero', 'Starrcade', 'wish', 'THIS', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'opener', 'there', 'Anyway', 'spetacular', 'opening', 'Superbrawl', 'Disco', 'Inferno', 'Vs.', 'La', 'Parka', 'strong', 'opening', 'needed', 'little', 'comedy', 'relief', 'what', 'got', 'here', 'D.I', 'Chair-man', 'WCW', 'when', 'D.I', 'Chartbuster', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Stunner', 'La', 'Parka', 'win.Bill', 'Goldberg', 'Vs.', 'Brad', 'Armstrong', 'One', 'Goldberg', 'early', 'appearances', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'squash', 'Armstrong', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'training', 'Goldberg', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'match', 'glimpses', 'potential', 'in-ring', 'greatness', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Granted', 'had', 'great', 'career', 'anyway', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Chris', 'Jericho', 'Vs.', 'Juventud', 'Guerrera', 'WCW', 'Cruiserweight', 'Title', 'Vs', 'Mask', 'Jericho', 'WCW', 'Cruiserweight', 'belt', 'was', 'line', 'Vs.', 'Juventud', 'mask', 'great', 'back', 'forth', 'action', 'air', 'mat', 'Jericho', 'finally', 'took', 'match', 'Liontamer', 'Walls', 'Jericho', 'boston', 'crab', 'submission', 'Juvi', 'then', 'unmasked', 'more', 'less', 'wrestled', 'unmasked', 'since.The', 'British', 'Bulldog', 'Vs.', 'Steve', 'McMichael', 'late', 'Davey', 'Boy', 'Smith', 'was', 'great', 'wrestler', 'who', 'could', 'put', 'good', 'great', 'match', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'Steve', 'McMichael', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'one', 'guys', 'Very', 'slow', 'legit', 'injury', 'McMichael.Chris', 'Benoit', 'Vs.', 'Diamond', 'Dallas', 'Page', 'WCW', 'U.S', 'Title', 'Match', 'Long', 'death', 'infamous', 'status', 'Chris', 'Benoit', 'was', 'highly', 'regarded', 'very', 'popular', 'technical', 'wrestler', 'could', 'have', 'good', 'great', 'match', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'DDP', 'was', 'benefitted', 'meeting', 'then', 'Crippler', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'title', 'match', 'DDP', 'slipping', 'Diamond', 'Cutter', 'Benoit.I', 'find', 'ending', 'bit', 'ironic', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'defeated', 'Benoit', 'similiar', 'fashion', 'SummerSlam', '2004', 'LOL', 'Lex', 'Luger', 'Vs.', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'No', 'DQ', 'Match', 'Very', 'dull', 'bout', 'worst', 'card', 'was', 'basically', 'building', 'drama', 'Savage', 'leaving', 'nWo', 'Nothing', 'more', 'Ends', 'Luger', 'getting', 'submission', 'Human', 'Torture', 'Rack', 'backbreaker.Scott', 'Hall/Kevin', 'Nash', 'Vs', 'Steiner', 'Bros.', 'WCW', 'World', 'Tag', 'Team', 'Title', 'Match', 'match', 'significant', 'only', 'first', 'full', 'blown', 'glimpse', 'new', 'character', 'Scott', 'Steiner', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'known', 'Big', 'Poppa', 'Pump', 'turned', 'brother', 'Rick', 'pretty', 'much', 'handed', 'Outsiders', 'tag', 'titles.Sting', 'Vs.', 'Hollywood', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'WCW', 'World', 'Title', 'Match', 'HEAVILY', 'MAKES', 'UP', 'THE', 'STARRCADE', 'FIASCO', 'match', 'had', 'action', 'drama', 'Starrcade', 'bout', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Even', 'run', 'ins', 'nWo', 'could', ""n't"", 'dampen', 'match', 'Ends', 'when', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'actually', 'Hogan', 'spray', 'can', 'allowing', 'Sting', 'get', 'pin', 'title', 'Overall', 'WCW', 'tape', 'getting', 'keeping', 'showed', 'what', 'WCW', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'marketing', 'people', 'actually', 'knew', 'wrestling', 'rather', 'suits', 'who', 'THOUGHT', 'knew', 'wrestling', 'veterans', 'worked', 'angles', 'only', 'benefitted', 'rather', 'company', 'even', 'business', 'True', 'should', 'look', 'out', 'first', 'BUT', 'point', 'have', 'put', 'own', 'ego', 'aside', 'think', 'bigger', 'picture.Anyway', 'WCW', 'card', 'actually', 'worth', 'hunting', 'down', 'getting']",WCW: SuperBrawl VIII VHS
31136,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,0780622189,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","WCWSUPERBRAWL 8It was a great time for wrestling in my opinion, WCW and the WWF were going head to head and story lines actually were good. Time has passed and I wonder what it would be like if WCW had not gone under. Any way here is my review, spoilers for those who might care lay ahead.1.[TV CHAMPIONSHIP]-RICK MARTEL VS BOOKER T-the winner of this contest would immediately have to defend the title against Perry Saturn, remember when the TV title was a sought after belt [I miss those days]. This opening bout was a very well paced and entertaining match. Both of them came to put on a good show for the crowd, in which they seemed to appreciate it. It was a great back and forth battle that saw Booker edge out Martel [wonderful performer] at the end barley.4/52.[TV CHAMPIONSHIP]-BOOKER T VS SATURN-immediately after Booker was declared the winner Saturn jumped him from behind and put him in the rings of Saturn. This was a great match I think, I would say it was better then the previous bout. Maybe it is because Booker overcame the odds and kept the belt.4.5/53.LA PARKA VS DISCO INFERNO-two more I really miss on national TV, yes that includes Disco. La Parka has always been and still is one of my favorite wrestlers, his dance is brilliant. The same can be said for Disco, maybe I felt bad for him but something about him always seemed to make me like him. Any way these two had a pretty good match, I think it was on par with the opening match. Both put on a good match that was pretty entertaining, good match up.4/54.BRAD ARMSTRONG VS BILL GOLDBERG-you all know how this bout went, I have to be honest. I really never got into and behind Goldberg, well not until he went into longer matches but even then not really. And as usual Goldberg came out beat him up a little and then won, I hated how they made him seem unstoppable. I like better as an actor.2/55.[CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP]-[TITLE VS MASK] JUVENTUD GUERRRERA VS CHRIS JERICHO-two wonderful performers lock it up right here, Jericho who is absolutely wonderful and Juve who is a great athlete. This was a good match, and to be honest I think it was the last time Juve was Juve. I really think he like Rey Mysterio Jr was not the same performer once he lost the mask. This was a great match and while not the best from either it was definitely much better then the last bout, a lot of high spots. The one thing about this match I hate is how the fans react at the end. It doesn't seem like they are into or really understand what a moment it was for Juve to take of the mask.4.8/56.STEVE MCMICHAEL VS THE BRITISH BULLDOG [R.I.P.]-here are two more guys that I have always liked [both from very famous groups], one more then the other to be honest. The late Davey Boy Smith [Bulldog] has always been one of the greatest wrestlers ever, his classics with and against Bret, & Owen Hart [R.I.P.] will live on forever. McMichael while never going to be considered a great wrestler [he did improve over time a little] was always an entertaining performer who held my attention, on the mic and story line wise he always delivered. Any way this bout was your typical two strong brawlers going at it, Davey really carry's this match and takes a submission victory.3.5/57.[US CHAMPIONSHIP]-DDP VS CHRIS BENOIT-I have to start out by saying that I in no way agree with or like what Benoit did and became, but the facts are facts, he was one of the all time greats in wrestling. There was a time when he was one of the most popular wrestlers ever, regardless of what would happen later. As far as Diamond Dallas Page, I started liking him much more when he became a heel again later on. This bout was between a really great wrestler and an average wrestler [not bad/not great], yet in still this is a pretty good match. Page ends this bout with a great Diamond Cutter after a very well paced fight.4/58.MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE VS LEX LUGER-Savage is [other then HBK] my all time favorite wrestler, I can not believe he has not come back to TNA after that last appearance. And Luger well is just Lex Luger, well to be fair he was much better once he returned to WCW after leaving the WWF. I never really was a fan of Luger [he is the king of the over sell] no matter what organization he was, the only time I ever stood on my feet cheering as loud as I could for Luger was when he won the WCW title from Hogan [not a fan of his at all] on Nitro. This match was interesting on only one front, and that was Savage's, Luger really didn't contribute anything to this bout. This was a quick match that saw the NWO come out and attack both Savage and Luger, and Luger pull out a victory of Savage due to a torture rack.3.5/59.[TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-STEINER BROTHERS VS THE OUTSIDERS-one of the longest running feuds in WCW at the time was between these two. This was the infamous match that Scot turned on his brother Rick and cost them the match and tag titles. To be honest this was one of the most entertaining and surprising moments in WCW history.

This was a much better match then the one at Starrcade, we all know why that happened [Hogan's creative control card, which I' am sure he used here and refused to lose to Sting fairly]. Nick Patrick running in to be the ref added a little something to this match, he even calls it fairly. Sting wins the belt after Savage knocks Hogan out [thank you Macho Man].

31137,A1V0898YIRFAS3,0780622189,Jose,"[1, 1]","I guess I am on the WCW memory trip because this is another event that I found in my collection of video tapes. The hype surrounding this event was the rematch between Hollywood Hulk Hogan & Sting. For those that don't remember, Sting & Hogan clashed in their highly anticipated battle at Starrcade '97 which lead to a horrible finish that really overshadowed the entire match to the point where many fans consider it the worst match in Starrcade history (I didn't think so). That lead to a rematch on Nitro that was pretty similar so this was the rubber match while at the same time, there were problems in the nWo between Hogan & Randy Savage that would play a factor throughout the night.WCW Television Champion Rick Martel vs Booker T. Originally, this was scheduled to be Booker T defending against Saturn but after Martel won the title by surprise, this match was decided with the winner facing Saturn right after this match. Booker T was really coming into his own at this point as this was his first singles push & had a great match with Martel that resulted in Martel getting injured after the match with Saturn attacking Booker to start....WCW Television Champion Booker T vs Saturn...this match. Saturn was impressive by using his power & submission offense to wear down Booker before Booker was able to come back & showed his heart to continue to battle despite the fact that he just went through a match literally a couple of minutes ago. This was an outstanding performance for Booker T & a great way to start the show.Disco Inferno vs La Parka. This match had a funny storyline going into it with both men trying to show off their dancing moves at one point during the match. Besides that, this was a good match between these two with again the comedy behind the match adding more to this match instead of coming off as a filler.Bill Goldberg vs Brad Armstrong. This was a bonus match that was really just a squash as Goldberg just out-powered & man-handled Armstrong before getting the quick victory.Mask vs Title: WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs Juventud Guerrera. It's Jericho's title against Juventud's mask as the stipulation here was that if Juventud didn't win the title, he would have to unmask. This was during Chris Jericho's best run in his WCW career as he was able to show how great of an entertainer he really is that lead to some comedic moments due to the stipulations of that match. The match itself was the type of performance that you would expect from the cruiserweight division as it was non-stop action with both men exchanging great offense among each other.The British Bulldog vs Steve McMichael. This match wasn't much & kept short since McMichael isn't that good of a performer but the bigger issue being McMichael injuring his arm that lead to the referee making a judgment call that McMichael took exception to in the end.WCW United States Champion Diamond Dallas Page vs Chris Benoit. After months of both men teaming together to take on Raven's flock, they finally get a chance to battle one on one here in what was a great wrestling match that build up in time from it starting off as a battle of true gentlemen for respect till it came down to who wants it more. DDP was always an underrated performer while we all know that when Benoit is in a match that he doesn't have to carry someone, you are in for a quality match. On a side note, pay close attention to Lodi's sign (from Raven's Flock) as he predicts the ending to this one.No Disqualifications: Randy Savage vs Lex Luger. This was really one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as Savage was calculating with his offense to focus on Luger's injured ribs including using a chair at one point but the main story here was the appearance of the nWo & what they did that continued the tension between Savage & Hogan that would play a factor in the main event later on. Two things to mention though are that you could tell by crowd reactions that Savage was being cheered for more than Luger & one hilarious moment of Savage being wild that lead to him calling the referee just to smack him in the face. Again, this was just for the storyline.WCW Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers vs The Outsiders. Another one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as this was all about the birth of ""Big Poppa Pump"" Scott Steiner & the end of the Steiner Brothers (for that time) as Scott literally handed the titles to Hall & Nash.WCW Championship Match: Sting vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan. Due to how their controversial Starrcade match & their rematch on Nitro occurred, this match had the rules relaxed due to the issue that there needed to be a winner in this match. This match heavily made up for their Starrcade match months ago & was the match that should have happened there as this came off as a very aggressive fight to the point where Sting actually ran to the ring to get the match started that lead to Hogan just beating Sting down with his belt & even talk trash to him throughout the match before Sting was able to turn the tables & even use the belt as a reciept to Hogan. As usual, the nWo made an appearance before Sting fought them off but it was one nWo member specially who made an impact in this match allowing Sting to not only win back the title for WCW but also deliver his own spraypaint celebration on Hogan.Overall, this was one of those events that was really a mixed bag as there was quality matches such as DDP/Benoit, Booker T's performance in the first two matches of the night, Jericho/Guerrera & Sting/Hogan delivering a much better match than they did at the previous Starrcade but along with the quality, there were fillers (Bulldog/McMichael, Disco/Parka, Goldberg's squash) along with two matches being nothing more than pushing storylines. There are better events to find but this is one worth checking out for the main event alone.",3,Sting-Hogan II....And More,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,5877,"['guess', 'am', 'WCW', 'memory', 'trip',
