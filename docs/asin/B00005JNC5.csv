628907,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,B00005JNC5,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[6, 6]","Danny Deckchair is an Australian film directed by Jeff Balsmeyer.  It stars Rhys Ifans, as the main character Danny Morgan, and Miranda Otto in the female lead, Glenda Lake.  It is one of those nice little films one is blessed to discover.  I came across this DVD in a rental shop cut-out bin.  It was like finding treasure.Danny Deckchair is billed as a comedy but it is more than just a funny story.  It is about dreams, big and small, romance and how one overcomes a bland existance.  Danny works with concrete.  He lives with his social climbing and agressively romantic girlfriend Trudy played wonderfully by Justine Clarke.  Danny has a knack for trying weird things.  He jumps into wet concrete.  He trys to become the ammunition in a giant slingshot.  Finally, he straps helium filled balloons to a deck aka lawn chair and off he goes.Danny lands in a small back country town and is transformed, but so are the folks in this little town.  The idea of an out of towner who changes the people he interacts with is not a new idea in film story lines.  But, Danny Deckchair certainly does this film genre justice. I have always enjoyed Australian cinema.  No matter what the story it always seems bright and fresh.  Danny Deckchair is bright, fresh, and enjoyable.  It is a definite buy.",4,The flight of a burnt out dreamer,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1291,"['Danny', 'Deckchair', 'Australian', 'film', 'directed', 'Jeff', 'Balsmeyer', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'main', 'character', 'Danny', 'Morgan', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'female', 'lead', 'Glenda', 'Lake', 'one', 'nice', 'little', 'films', 'one', 'blessed', 'discover', 'came', 'DVD', 'rental', 'shop', 'cut-out', 'bin', 'was', 'finding', 'treasure.Danny', 'Deckchair', 'billed', 'comedy', 'more', 'just', 'funny', 'story', 'dreams', 'big', 'small', 'romance', 'how', 'one', 'bland', 'existance', 'Danny', 'concrete', 'social', 'climbing', 'agressively', 'romantic', 'girlfriend', 'Trudy', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Justine', 'Clarke', 'Danny', 'knack', 'trying', 'weird', 'things', 'wet', 'concrete', 'become', 'ammunition', 'giant', 'slingshot', 'Finally', 'helium', 'filled', 'balloons', 'deck', 'aka', 'lawn', 'chair', 'goes.Danny', 'lands', 'small', 'back', 'country', 'town', 'transformed', 'so', 'are', 'folks', 'little', 'town', 'idea', 'out', 'towner', 'who', 'people', 'not', 'new', 'idea', 'film', 'story', 'lines', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'certainly', 'film', 'genre', 'justice', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Australian', 'cinema', 'matter', 'what', 'story', 'always', 'bright', 'fresh', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'bright', 'fresh', 'enjoyable', 'definite', 'buy']",N/A

628909,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JNC5,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 7]","Danny Deckchair is one of those extremely cute movies that attempts at every level to be more than just this ""cute"" movie about a man, but more instead a more soul wrenching story about life.  It tries, and at times does, speak to each of us about the daily routine of our day-to-day lives.  It is the story of life bundled up in a cute package with Rhys Ifans as our poster child.  I don't mean to overuse the word cute, but the film does fall into the ""cute"" category will full speed.  It uses the ""cute"" principles that I will explain in more detail:The Cute Principles of Danny DeckchairDanny is a likeable character from the beginning.  Immediately as we begin this film we are attracted to him.  Never throughout this film are we against Danny.  We are always standing behind him, no matter where he sticks his mind or hands; we are standing right next to him.  This is the sign of a ""cute"" character.  He has flaws, but we don't care because we like him so much already.  From the moment he falls into cement, he has been given this label.  He reminded me of Hugh Grant and that aura that seems to surround him in many of his films.1) The contrast between Danny's old life and the one that he creates with Glenda borders fantasy.  There is so much of a contrast that it is hard to fully appreciate the town that he ""falls"" into.  Throughout this film I continually saw this little town like the nestled ""gold city"" in the woods.  Everyone knew everyone, and it seemed like the community was behind the people instead of the money.  Glenda felt like an unfinished puzzle that suddenly became complete once Danny arrived.  It all happened so quickly that we are left without any time to ask any questions, but instead accept the plot ""as is"".  I never felt that I was watching a ""real"" town in the film, but instead a ""cute"" situation that Danny was accepted into.2) There was little to no explanation of what Danny had done.  Nobody laughed at what he had accomplished with his balloons, nobody questioned his position with the University in great detail, and nobody really dug deep into the life of this complete stranger.  In this ""cute"" little town they accepted Danny for whom he was, not for any truths that may accompany him.  This I thought was a bit strange, but is also a main point for a ""cute"" movie.3) Finally, the actions of the secondary characters are also very ""cute"".  The fact that Danny happens to arrive to the town almost instantly when elections are coming is hysterical to me.  It seemed as if Danny was always supposed to be here (which is what I really liked about this film), the town already was prepared to handle Danny's arrival.  The Pancake Political Campaign is the icing on the cake to creating this ""cute"" environment.  Really, you never see this in real life (not often enough), so it was a ""cute"" action for the political person.  Also, when Danny befriends everyone from the wealthy to the poor by communicating to them in some way was very ""cute"".  Again, no explanation was needed, no sub-story needed to be developed, there was this aura of familiarity with Danny that soared to new levels of ""cute""-ness.Perhaps I have overburdened you too much with this ""cute"" factor issue, but I really walked thinking that it was just this really ""cute"" film that was flimsily defined, but left you with this amazing sense of goodness in your heart.  You really found yourself pulling for this unknown hero.  All of us in the audience felt like the town that Danny arrives into, waiting with open arms to welcome him to our community.  We nurture the relationship with him and Glenda, while secretly wish that Trudy would somehow disappear.  This wasn't a great film by any means, but it was really good.  It was a hidden gem in this darkened bleak film world that we live in.  I was impressed with the acting, while it provided average entertainment individually; it was when this entire cast connected that really made the picture shine.  Ifans captured the role of Danny perfectly; he has that ability to really capture the sense of the ""everyman"".  I think it has to do with the fact that he really doesn't look plastic or too Hollywood.  He seems like the type of person that is just like you and I, and I think that is why I associated with him so well in this film.  Otto does well with her part, but really could have stretched further.  The story was sound, the filming was decent, nothing spectacular, but what really brought this film into the world was the cast.  The rounded cast really shined forth bringing to the screen a real sense of community and friendship.Overall, I enjoyed this film.  I would suggest it to friends and family, but it is definitely too ""cute"" to add to my vastly growing collection.  It is one of those films that goes perfectly with a large lager and a stressful day.  Danny Deckchair proves that everyone can find their place in life and that sometimes it takes a great feat to accomplish this, but in the end you will find your happiness.  It is a powerful message for such a small film, but they (I speak of the entire cast) pull it off with such pizzazz and energy that you find yourself finishing this film with a smile on your face.  Decent, but not extravagant Danny Deckchair hits that pleasure button for a good hour and a half and allows all of us cogs in the machine to continue dreaming.Grade: **** out of *****",4,"Helium helps

I think most movie fans know Rhys Ifans and can expect the off-the-wall comedy you expect from him. What is a total joy is the entire cast all fits so seamlessly well. Ifans has real chemistry (both in a good way and a realistic bad way) with both Miranda Otto and Justine Clarke--two terrific Australian actresses.The setting of the story in an indentikit suburb we all know (this one in Sydney) as well as having Ifans be a cement worker and Clarke a real estate agent is well worth the irony. The Pixar movie Up comparisons will come out based on the cover of this DVD but it's not much more than a goofy cousin of that storyline. Where Ifans lands in a very lively country town somewhere north of the city is a character to itself from the lush tropical fruit trees to the gorgeous way the sunlight lights up the world there.DVD comes with a great 18 min. or so Making Of that adds value to the package.

They don't feel obligated to anything restricting honesty. That refreshing ""throw caution to the wind"" attitude is prevalent throughout the movie.

If you enjoy movies like ""The Station Agent"", be sure to catch this one.Danny, a concrete worker, finds his life to be in the doldrums from a lack of inspiration and a love life in the toilet. He decides to try something wild so he has a barbeque and his friends help him tie large helium balloons to his lawn chair. The next thing you know a large part of Sidney watches him fly off into a thunderstorm. The city sets about on a dramatic search for him with the media in a feeding frenzy. Danny ends up in a small town where he is taken in by a parking patrol woman. They seem to have a magic he has never known and the whole town takes to him and his ideas.

Witness the 2004 Australian film Danny Deckchair, which is an off the rack romantic comedy without a whit of inspiration, and as predictable as they come. Granted, Hollywood romantic comedies can be bad to occasionally mediocre, and this film gently crests out of bad and into tepid mediocrity, but why was it ever made? To prove that Aussies could be as banal as the worst our country produces? Perhaps the secret is that the director and screenwriter was an American named Jeff Balsmeyer, and this was his first film after a career as a storyboardist. Lesson: just because a person can draw scenes others give to them does not mean they can actually write those scenes well. In short, since the film is so generic it's probably not the sort of outing that will have producers clamoring to give him a second shot. The premise for the film comes from the spate of real life nuts who tied balloons to chairs and other devices, and took off into the skies. The first recorded nut was a man called `Lawnchair Larry' Walters, who took off in June of 1982, and years later suicided.Now, perhaps the actual flight, and a good story tacked on to it would be worth filming, but this is a B-level Julia Roberts film with a good starting gag, but lacking Roberts, who despite her deficiencies as an actress, has an undeniable cinematic `presence'.

Ifans brings an inherent vulnerability that makes Danny, a bit of a loser, immediately likeable.  He isn't fully prepared - nor is the viewer - for the remarkable journey he finds himself taking and Ifans expressive face registers everything; fear, anger, disbelief, acceptance, but most of all wonder.  The transformation Danny undergoes upon his unexpected arrival in Clarence is remarkable as his life changes in almost unimaginable ways.  Where in Sydney he'd been stuck in a dead end job (where he still made his own fun) living with a woman increasingly growing weary of him, no real prospects for the future and his ""lame"" ideas shot down at every turn, in Clarence he is hailed as a hero, transforming not only himself but Glenda and the town itself.Miranda Otto's Glenda is a gloriously rare creature, an enigma:  tough yet fragile as lace the town views her almost as an outcast, yet when Danny arrives, she becomes adored by everyone.  Otto's transformation is no less astonishing than Danny's and as the film progresses she almost literally glows.  She becomes the ideal woman in nearly every way imaginable.  When things get tough, we see another crack in her veneer and learn a lot when she cries out ""I just don't want to feel.""  Otto makes it utterly impossible not to fall in love with this beautiful creature.The supporting cast all turn in terrific performances, both the folks back in Sydney and Danny's new life in Clarence.The film - and Danny's message comes across loud and clear:  there are no little blokes, no little jobs, no little anything, that everything in the world matters and has worth.Watching Danny Deckchair one slips back a little into a world where anything is possible - especially if you've got a few dozen balloons and a couple tanks of helium!This gets my highest recommendation.",5,Little Movie With An Enormous Heart,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,2110,"['Danny', 'Deckchair', 'charming', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'total', 'surprise', 'film', 'heart', 'as', 'big', 'great', 'continent', 'from.Rhys', 'Ifans', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'Danny', 'bringing', 'believability', 'factor', 'role', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'slap-shtick', 'Ifans', 'inherent', 'vulnerability', 'Danny', 'bit', 'loser', 'immediately', 'likeable', ""n't"", 'fully', 'prepared', 'viewer', 'remarkable', 'journey', 'taking', 'Ifans', 'expressive', 'face', 'registers', 'everything', 'fear', 'anger', 'disbelief', 'acceptance', 'most', 'wonder', 'transformation', 'Danny', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'Clarence', 'remarkable', 'life', 'changes', 'almost', 'unimaginable', 'ways', 'Where', 'Sydney', ""'d"", 'been', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'where', 'still', 'made', 'own', 'fun', 'living', 'woman', 'increasingly', 'growing', 'weary', 'real', 'prospects', 'future', 'lame', 'ideas', 'shot', 'down', 'turn', 'Clarence', 'hailed', 'hero', 'transforming', 'not', 'only', 'Glenda', 'town', 'itself.Miranda', 'Otto', 'Glenda', 'gloriously', 'rare', 'creature', 'enigma', 'tough', 'yet', 'fragile', 'lace', 'town', 'almost', 'outcast', 'yet', 'when', 'Danny', 'adored', 'everyone', 'Otto', 'transformation', 'less', 'astonishing', 'Danny', 'film', 'almost', 'literally', 'glows', 'ideal', 'woman', 'nearly', 'way', 'imaginable', 'When', 'things', 'get', 'tough', 'see', 'crack', 'veneer', 'learn', 'lot', 'when', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'Otto', 'utterly', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'beautiful', 'creature.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turn', 'terrific', 'performances', 'folks', 'back', 'Sydney', 'Danny', 'new', 'life', 'Clarence.The', 'film', 'Danny', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'are', 'little', 'blokes', 'little', 'jobs', 'little', 'anything', 'everything', 'world', 'matters', 'worth.Watching', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'one', 'back', 'little', 'world', 'where', 'anything', 'possible', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'got', 'few', 'dozen', 'balloons', 'couple', 'tanks', 'helium', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

Danny makes the most of a ridiculous balloon imprinting error in deciding to attempt to do something extraordinary - make a deck chair that can fly - and he succeeds, only to be caught in a storm and eventually falling into the backyard in a town far removed from his home in Sydney, Australia.  The owner of the home is a like soul, Glenda (Mirando Otto) who is the sole meter maid in a tiny town filled with folk who are warm, gullible, honest, and simply sensitive.The pair, Danny and Glenda, set out to make things different for themselves, with the use of a few prevarications, and both 'clean up real good', and alter the little town in a most positive way.  And that is enough of the story to share.The cast is strongly lead by Rhys Ifans' performance: he offers one of the best gentle comedy character creations in memory, absorbing the Aussie accent to a T! He is ably supported by not only Miranda Otto and Justine Clark, but also a 'whole town full' of memorable simple people.

I was thumbing through channels and stumbled upon an ad for it on a channel I don't remember.  I had decided to watch it because I saw Rhys Ifans in ""Notting Hill"" and as well as Miranda Otto guesting on an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation (Lower Decks) and was impressed with her as well.  ""Danny Deckchair"" is a story (loosely based on actual similar event) about a blue collar jokester (Rhys Ifans) with an unappreciative girfriend attaches balloons to his deckchair and floats off into the wild blue yonder until he's shot down (accidently) by and into a small town.  He meets a girl (Mirando Otto) who he pursues a relationship with when his past catches up with him.  I'm not one for romantic movies in general, but ""Danny Deckchair"" is one of the sweetest movies I've seen.  It's about one man, who just hasn't been able to find where he belongs, and one woman, who long since put aside her dreams for the numbing sameness of responsibility.  Each finds what has been missing in their lives.  This movie reminds the viewer to look around, smell the roses and appreciate those in your lives WHILE you have them without being preachy.  There are no boring spots in it and the humor is mature, adult and British.  This movie belongs next to my other romantic comedies such as ""Return to Me"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""I highly recommend watching ""Danny Deckchair.""

However, I absolutely adore indies, especially foreign indies, as they usually avoid the vapid American comedic cliches I detest.Danny Deckchair is an indie comedy with alot of heart, alot of soul, and a heck of alot of laughs - all due to the brilliantly cast leads of Miranda Otto and Rhys Ifins, as well as Justine Clarke.  I've enjoyed watching Otto since LotR.  In Danny Deckchair, she's so luminous it almost hurts to watch her.  Ifans was an unknown to me, and at first it was hard to get a handle on him, but his transformation from likable yet pathetic loser to shining ""everyman"" was a sheer delight.  Clarke plays a character that could be a shrew in the wrong actor's hands, but with her acting makes the character sympathetic and not hateful.The cinematography was wonderful, and really captured the ""dreamtime"" quality that so many Americans imagine belongs to that vast country of Australia.

It's an outlandish enough story that it makes sense that sooner or later someone would see it as the germ of a film idea.Writer Jeff Balsmeyer correctly makes this the centerpiece of the story, a transforming experience for cement man Danny Morgan (Rhys Ifans), an oddball ne'er-do-well who shares a home in Sydney with his attractive, ambitious girlfriend, realtor Trudy Dunphy (Justine Clarke). Their relationship is under a strain. Most people don't pay attention to Danny and his brainstorms. He makes do, though, with his blue-collar job, punctuated by camping vacations and the construction of the odd human slingshot. Trudy, on the other hand, longs for something more.Along comes handsome newscaster Sandy Upman (Rhys Muldoon), and, tired of Danny's inertia, Trudy's head begins to turn. She lies to Danny, scuttling their outdoor trip to nurture her professional connection with Sandy. It isn't looking good for Danny, and in desperation he cooks up a stunt, buying helium and castoff advertising balloons. It all comes to a head at a big weekend cookout, and he accidentally becomes airborne.Like many romantic comedies, this accident delivers Danny to a new place and new possibilities. He crash-lands miles away from home, in the back yard of Glenda Lake, whose solitude threatens to make her the town spinster. To avoid embarrassment, she and Danny fabricate a new identity for him. His impulsive style charms Glenda, and she's not the only one - people begin to listen to Danny. His workaday background endears him to them, and his spontaneity spreads through the town. The challenger in the upcoming mayoral election, ""Big Jim"" Craig, hires Danny as his campaign manager. Danny's life has never felt so focused.While all this is going on, Trudy exploits Danny's disappearance to attract media attention, thereby drawing herself closer to Sandy. He's been gone long enough that the news story is taking on a tragic dimension. Unbeknownst to Trudy, Danny is so popular that he has begun to eclipse his employer as a possibility for mayor.All of this comes to a head when a old flame of Glenda's discovers the truth about Danny, and, in an attempt to discredit him, leaks the story to the press. Danny and Trudy's reunion is a bigger story than ever, and Sydney warmly embraces their newest celebrities. It's up to Danny to decide which of his diverging lives is the true one, and which is the fiction.This is a well-travelled path, and its charm lies almost entirely in its execution. Rhys Ifans is handsome enough to be a romantic leading man, but fun and believable with the impulsive quirks that land him in trouble. Justine Clarke walks the fine line, making her character compelling while doing very unsympathetic things. Miranda Otto also strikes an impressive balance - she makes a pretty leading lady while being convincing as the inadvertent town wallflower.What makes this story so appealing is that it's one of a misfit finding his true home and purpose with a community who really cares about him. It's heartening to see a seemingly irresponsible guy clicking into acceptance without sacrificing his priciples or identity. Surprisingly, both city and small-town life are shown to be flawed - Trudy represents the impersonal ambition of the city, while Danny's small-town candidate spouts populist tripe and philanders with his constituents.The plot's not without its own blemishes. Once Danny is caught in his lie, the townsfolk seem completely unconcerned that they've been misled for quite a while. Additionally, the mayoral race vanishes entirely, perhaps cut to restore the audience's patience. Still, ""Danny Deckchair"", while perhaps not a film for the ages, is a satisfying, charming tale.",3,You Get What You Need,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3870,"['Apparently', '1982', 'really', 'was', 'fellow', 'who', 'tied', 'bunch', 'weather', 'balloons', 'lawn', 'chair', 'flew', 'much', 'higher', 'further', 'expected', 'outlandish', 'enough', 'story', 'sense', 'sooner', 'later', 'someone', 'would', 'see', 'germ', 'film', 'idea.Writer', 'Jeff', 'Balsmeyer', 'correctly', 'centerpiece', 'story', 'transforming', 'experience', 'cement', 'man', 'Danny', 'Morgan', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'oddball', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'who', 'shares', 'home', 'Sydney', 'attractive', 'ambitious', 'girlfriend', 'realtor', 'Trudy', 'Dunphy', 'Justine', 'Clarke', 'relationship', 'strain', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'Danny', 'brainstorms', 'do', 'blue-collar', 'job', 'punctuated', 'camping', 'vacations', 'construction', 'odd', 'human', 'slingshot', 'Trudy', 'other', 'hand', 'longs', 'something', 'more.Along', 'handsome', 'newscaster', 'Sandy', 'Upman', 'Rhys', 'Muldoon', 'tired', 'Danny', 'inertia', 'Trudy', 'head', 'turn', 'Danny', 'scuttling', 'outdoor', 'trip', 'nurture', 'professional', 'connection', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'looking', 'good', 'Danny', 'desperation', 'up', 'stunt', 'buying', 'helium', 'castoff', 'advertising', 'balloons', 'head', 'big', 'weekend', 'cookout', 'accidentally', 'airborne.Like', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'accident', 'Danny', 'new', 'place', 'new', 'possibilities', 'miles', 'away', 'home', 'back', 'yard', 'Glenda', 'Lake', 'solitude', 'make', 'town', 'spinster', 'avoid', 'embarrassment', 'Danny', 'fabricate', 'new', 'identity', 'impulsive', 'style', 'charms', 'Glenda', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'people', 'begin', 'listen', 'Danny', 'workaday', 'spontaneity', 'town', 'challenger', 'upcoming', 'mayoral', 'election', 'Big', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'Danny', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Danny', 'life', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'focused.While', 'going', 'Trudy', 'Danny', 'disappearance', 'attract', 'media', 'attention', 'thereby', 'drawing', 'closer', 'Sandy', 'been', 'gone', 'long', 'enough', 'news', 'story', 'taking', 'tragic', 'dimension', 'Unbeknownst', 'Trudy', 'Danny', 'so', 'popular', 'begun', 'eclipse', 'employer', 'possibility', 'mayor.All', 'head', 'when', 'old', 'flame', 'Glenda', 'discovers', 'truth', 'Danny', 'attempt', 'discredit', 'story', 'press', 'Danny', 'Trudy', 'reunion', 'bigger', 'story', 'ever', 'Sydney', 'warmly', 'newest', 'celebrities', 'up', 'Danny', 'decide', 'diverging', 'lives', 'true', 'one', 'fiction.This', 'well-travelled', 'path', 'charm', 'almost', 'entirely', 'execution', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'handsome', 'enough', 'be', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'fun', 'believable', 'impulsive', 'quirks', 'land', 'trouble', 'Justine', 'Clarke', 'fine', 'line', 'making', 'character', 'compelling', 'doing', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'things', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'also', 'impressive', 'balance', 'pretty', 'leading', 'lady', 'being', 'convincing', 'inadvertent', 'town', 'story', 'so', 'appealing', 'one', 'misfit', 'finding', 'true', 'home', 'purpose', 'community', 'who', 'really', 'heartening', 'see', 'seemingly', 'irresponsible', 'guy', 'clicking', 'acceptance', 'sacrificing', 'priciples', 'identity', 'Surprisingly', 'city', 'small-town', 'life', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'flawed', 'Trudy', 'impersonal', 'ambition', 'city', 'Danny', 'small-town', 'candidate', 'spouts', 'populist', 'tripe', 'philanders', 'constituents.The', 'plot', 'not', 'own', 'blemishes', 'Once', 'Danny', 'caught', 'lie', 'townsfolk', 'seem', 'completely', 'unconcerned', ""'ve"", 'been', 'misled', 'quite', 'while', 'Additionally', 'mayoral', 'race', 'vanishes', 'entirely', 'perhaps', 'cut', 'restore', 'audience', 'patience', 'Still', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'perhaps', 'not', 'film', 'ages', 'satisfying', 'charming', 'tale']",N/A

He is married to his wife Trudy, played by the wonderful Justine Clarke (Look Both Ways, All Saints). They tend to bicker back and forth like most married couples do. While throwing a party with friends, Danny thinks of something. He thinks that if he ties enough ballons to his deckchair that he will float up in the air. So him and his friends tie the ballons onto the chair and eventually the chair lifts up with Danny and it flies up in the sky. The balloons eventually pop from fireworks and he winds up in another town and smack dab in the backyard of a house belonging to a woman named Glenda, played by the beautiful and talented Miranda Otto (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Thin Red Line). She soon houses him and he winds up becoming the center of attraction in the town and soon Glenda and Danny grow to love each other. Soon, Danny's wife comes and finds him and so on, so forth.

Danny Morgan has little ambition, but lots of ideas - like a human slingshot, and pancake breakfasts as the answer to any advertising or PR question for another).  His latest brainstorm involves using a number of large balloons to lift him up for a view of the neighborhood.  With the aid of his friends, and a few pints of beer, the balloons are filled with helium and tied to his lawn chair.  Thanks to a miscalculation - or more correctly, no calculation at all - his ascent is much higher and considerably faster than anticipated.  Within seconds he's at the mercy of the northerly winds that transport him from the suburbs of Sydney to the small town of Clarence, where the fireworks of the local Macadamia Nut Festival ultimately bring him down to earth with all of the speed and trauma of his take-off.He lands in the back yard of the local parking cop - think small town meter maid - and from there the movie splits into two parallel story lines as Danny finds new opportunity and love, while his girlfriend back in Sydney milks his disappearance into her own 15 minutes of fame and fortune.  There is little surprise to the way this movie ends, but there is nothing wrong with that.Rhys Ifans makes Danny believable, both as a clueless construction worker with a penchant for falling into wet cement, and as the ""stranger from out of town"" that wins the hearts of Clarence.  But it's the two female leads that make the film soar!  Miranda Otto is radiant as the parking cop, becoming more beautiful by the minute as she warms to Danny's offbeat charm.  And Justine Clark as Trudy, Danny's girlfriend back in Sydney must have studied every episode of the Batchelor/Batchelorette and Apprentice series to nail her fame-pursuing character.My only fear is that someone, somewhere is going to try to remake this little gem into a bigger budget movie with more ""star"" power.

If you're looking for a serious drama about relationships and love, look elsewhere.  If, however, you're looking for a genuinely charming and funny movie that will leave you feeling pretty good overall by the end, then this is it.Danny, a ""cement man"" in Sydney, Australia, leads a pretty normal life with his girlfriend, his house, his weekend barbeques, and his friends. He does, however, have some pretty crazy ideas. Frustrated in his fruitless attempts to take a vacation somewhere out of the way, and confused by his reaction to his girlfriend's possible infidelity, he comes up with the craziest one ever: strap a huge bunch of yellow helium balloons to a lawn chair and see where it takes him.  To the surprise of everyone (including himself!), it works, and it takes him to the little town of Clarence.  There, he discovers the possibility of new love in the form of the local parking meter cop who first finds him when he falls out of the sky, and he finds that he can be someone important after all: himself.I love watching ""Danny Deckchair"" because it walks so many fine lines so well.  It's a little predictable, but not insulting.  It's fun and funny, without delving into stupidity.  It's a ""feel-good"" movie but it's not saccharine-sweet.
