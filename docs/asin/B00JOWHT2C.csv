1696849,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B00JOWHT2C,"bass boy ""music fan""","[5, 8]","It's good to see The Who release a visual document of this tour. The band comes out swinging from the gate right off the bat with the rowdy &#34;Real Me.&#34; Sound is really strong, with care taken to make sure that Pete Townshend's guitar isn't drowned out by brother/guitarist Simon Townshend's ax, and Pino Palladino's bass, especially in the beginning, has a nice, warm, full presence. Roger Daltrey is in fairly strong voice, while drummer Scott Devours, who tours with Daltrey solo and also with ex-Eagle Don Felder, is a beast on the drums here. We've been told that Scott subbed for Zak Starkey because Zak tore a tendon, but it does make one wonder if Zak has grown to wish to play other musical adventures. Regardless, Scott is outstanding (as is Zak).The visuals on the standard DVD version look crisp, and it's nice the director/editors chose to include some of the big-screen footage into the film, both in the background and in the occasional visual montage that mixes live band image with black and white stock film.The only true flaw in the DVD is the fact that the same director/editors also chose to focus the cameras almost exclusively on Daltrey and Pete Townshend, a near-fatal move, IMO. Pino hardly gets any screen time, but Simon, as the show progresses, is caught a little more within the camera's viewfinders. The scene of Simon grinning at big brother Pete as the two push each other on guitars during the build-up in &#34;5.15&#34; is magical. I just wish someone pushed the cameramen and director to feature more shots of Simon and Pino. (Scott is seen frequently, in between Daltrey and Townshend, and in the occasional closeup and medium shots. On this tour, The Who was a five-man band (plus the backing keyboardists and horn players). The DVD should have given more (but not all of the) attention to the other players.P.S. It was a super class move for Pete and Roger to include archival footage and audio of Keith Moon (&#34;Bell Boy&#34;) and John Entwistle (&#34;5.15&#34;) in this show and the entire tour. Watching the Ox bend, slap and tap his Buzzard bass strings on the big screens as Devours, on the stage, pounded the kit, on the DVD and at the Tulsa show I caught in 2013, was just about the second-coolest thing I've ever seen at a concert. (The first, seeing the Ox in person on The Who's 2000 tour.) Who fans should pick up this DVD; just don't expect to see a lot of footage of Simon and Pino.",4,The Who remain the best; DVD almost gets there ....,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,2442,"['good', 'see', 'Who', 'release', 'visual', 'document', 'tour', 'band', 'out', 'swinging', 'gate', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'rowdy', '34', 'Real', 'Me.', '34', 'Sound', 'really', 'strong', 'care', 'taken', 'make', 'sure', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'guitar', ""n't"", 'drowned', 'out', 'brother/guitarist', 'Simon', 'Townshend', 'ax', 'Pino', 'Palladino', 'bass', 'especially', 'beginning', 'nice', 'warm', 'full', 'presence', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'fairly', 'strong', 'voice', 'drummer', 'Scott', 'Devours', 'who', 'Daltrey', 'solo', 'also', 'ex-Eagle', 'Don', 'Felder', 'beast', 'drums', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'Scott', 'subbed', 'Zak', 'Starkey', 'Zak', 'tore', 'tendon', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'Zak', 'grown', 'wish', 'play', 'other', 'musical', 'adventures', 'Regardless', 'Scott', 'outstanding', 'Zak', '.The', 'visuals', 'standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'look', 'crisp', 'nice', 'director/editors', 'chose', 'include', 'big-screen', 'footage', 'film', 'background', 'occasional', 'visual', 'montage', 'live', 'band', 'image', 'black', 'white', 'stock', 'film.The', 'only', 'true', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'fact', 'same', 'director/editors', 'also', 'chose', 'focus', 'cameras', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Daltrey', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'near-fatal', 'move', 'IMO', 'Pino', 'hardly', 'screen', 'time', 'Simon', 'show', 'caught', 'little', 'more', 'camera', 'viewfinders', 'scene', 'Simon', 'grinning', 'big', 'brother', 'Pete', 'two', 'push', 'other', 'guitars', 'build-up', '34', '5.15', '34', 'magical', 'just', 'wish', 'someone', 'pushed', 'cameramen', 'director', 'feature', 'more', 'shots', 'Simon', 'Pino', 'Scott', 'seen', 'frequently', 'Daltrey', 'Townshend', 'occasional', 'closeup', 'medium', 'shots', 'tour', 'Who', 'was', 'five-man', 'band', 'backing', 'keyboardists', 'horn', 'players', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'not', 'attention', 'other', 'players.P.S', 'was', 'super', 'class', 'move', 'Pete', 'Roger', 'include', 'archival', 'footage', 'audio', 'Keith', 'Moon', '34', 'Bell', 'Boy', '34', 'John', 'Entwistle', '34', '5.15', '34', 'show', 'entire', 'tour', 'Watching', 'Ox', 'bend', 'slap', 'tap', 'Buzzard', 'bass', 'strings', 'big', 'screens', 'Devours', 'stage', 'pounded', 'kit', 'DVD', 'Tulsa', 'show', 'caught', '2013', 'was', 'just', 'second-coolest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'concert', 'first', 'seeing', 'Ox', 'person', 'Who', '2000', 'tour', 'Who', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'footage', 'Simon', 'Pino']",N/A
1696850,A72K8MPMJQ7R8,B00JOWHT2C,B. B. Barker,"[1, 2]","We can thank Roger Daltrey for this particular tour. To keep his voice fresh, he's been coming up with creative ways to tour for the last several years (the excellent Daltrey-Tommy tour, etc.). Quadrophenia in concert is unfinished business for the Who, who always had problems playing this complex material in concert. Hence, this tour, which Roger basically put together, conceived, and so on. Guitarist Frank Simes gets a ton of credit for arranging all of this musically, including the sound effects, arrangements and sequence from the original album. If you buy this Blu-Ray and watch it beginning to end, you'll be amazed not only with the incredible substance of this prog-rock masterpiece but also with the creative visuals going on in the background. From someone who saw this tour, I can say that the added benefit here is the extra layers of visuals added into the mix beyond just what's happening on the stage.As for the performance, Daltrey is in B+ voice, but he gets a mulligan for having kept it all together for so many years. This material is not easy to sing, for anyone. Townshend, as always, throws down. For those who have seen lots of latter day video from these guys, you know what to expect. They are truly the greatest and most dedicated rock performers ever.Some reviewers have pointed out that we see very little of Pino Palladino. Yes, that's a a bummer, because he's been the Who's touring bassist for the last 12 years. On that note, we see the occasional hands on keyboards, but not enough of the really excellent session musicians who obviously relish keeping this great music alive. But that's a small point when you think of the fact that there are so many visuals in this thing it's impossible to show everything.Like so many of Townshend's inspirations, Quadrophenia was way ahead of its time. He always wanted this piece of music to be accompanied by sound effects, visuals, story lines.

Part of that is thanks to the fact that they chose this time to do something other than a straight &#34;greatest hits&#34; run-through.

1696857,A3NWETM1N964Y0,B00JOWHT2C,MojoRisin,"[13, 15]","The Who went on Tourto perform their 1973 rock opera Quadrophenia, which tells the story of a Mod named Jimmy living in England in the mid 1960s. The band of course is only with two of their original members, lead singer Roger Daltrey, and lead guitarist and primary song writer Pete Townshend. Filling the shoes of diseased bassist and drummer John Entwistle and Keith Moon were Pino Palladino on bass, and Scott Devours on Drums. Those two have been touring with the band for the past few years, and they both did a good job filling the big shoes they had to fill. Pete's younger brother Simon Townshend was also there as a second guitarist and had lead vocals on the song Dirty Jobs. Despite being in their late 60s, Townshend and Daltrey still had all their old moves on stage, Pete did a several windmills on the guitar, and Roger did his signature microphone twirl, he also sported his classic look of wearing an unbuttoned shirt and is to be in good shape. Taking advantage of modern technology, they band was able to use video screens to add to their performance and represent John Entwistle by playing a video of one of his bass solos on the song 5:15. They did the same for Keith Moon by playing a video of him singing the song Bell Boy from one of their Charlton Concert of 1974. It was a nice way to pay tribute to their former members. Once the band concluded Quadrophenia with a powerful rendition of Love Reign O'er Me, Townshend took on the roll of leader and introduced the lesser known members of the band as well as the supporting members. He then said it was time for some &#34;classic symphony music&#34; as the band broke out into a bunch of their hits which included, Baba O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes, Who Are You, Pinball Wizard, and Won't Get Fooled Again. After that everyone left the stage except for Pete and Roger, who after a bit of banter played the song Tea and Theater from their recent album from 2006 Endless Wire. After that, the two original members of The Who left the stage and the show was over. Overall, the concert was great and it was really cool to see the greatest band in the world.

Many years later, I didn't change my mind about this, there are some really good songs, like the title track, &#34;Dr. Jimmy&#34;, &#34;The Rock&#34; and &#34;Love Reign Over Me&#34;. The other tracks are not bad for what they are, good rock songs, but not as good as some songs of their entire discography. Fortunately, the show has some of those songs as bonus performance, including &#34;Baba O'Riley&#34;, &#34;Who are You&#34; and &#34;Won't get Fooled Again&#34;There's a lot of projections on the screen of the band from the old days. Nice touch to have included John Entwistle with a solo of one of his performance in the song &#34;5:15&#34;. Not only you can see him on the screen, but you can actually hear his solo. In fact, his solo sounds more alive than the bass sound of the actual player Pino Palladino, who is rarely captured by the cameras and low in the mix. Also, during &#34;Bell Boy&#34;, Keith Moon is singing on the screen.Those projections of the old days performances are only present in the &#34;Quadrophenia&#34; album and not in the bonus songs at the end. We have many musicians on the stage including horn players, Simon Townsend who signs like Pete in &#34;Dirty Jobs&#34;. Also two keyboardists, but it's mostly the piano that we hear during this show.The picture quality is excellent and the DTS HD mix is also nice. A must for the Who fans, for those who want to see this old band in a context of the new technology, and especially for those who enjoy &#34;Quadrophenia&#34;.",3,Looking back to the old days!,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1755,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'live', 'show', 'complete', 'double', 'album', '34', 'Quadrophenia', '34', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'listen', 'album', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'songs', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'songs', 'title', 'track', '34', 'Dr.', 'Jimmy', '34', '34', 'Rock', '34', '34', 'Love', 'Reign', 'Me', '34', 'other', 'tracks', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'rock', 'songs', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'songs', 'entire', 'discography', 'Fortunately', 'show', 'songs', 'bonus', 'performance', 'including', '34', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", '34', '34', 'Who', 'are', '34', '34', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Fooled', 'Again', '34', 'lot', 'projections', 'screen', 'band', 'old', 'days', 'Nice', 'touch', 'have', 'included', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'solo', 'one', 'performance', 'song', '34', '5:15', '34', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'screen', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'solo', 'fact', 'solo', 'more', 'alive', 'bass', 'sound', 'actual', 'player', 'Pino', 'Palladino', 'who', 'rarely', 'captured', 'cameras', 'low', 'mix', 'Also', '34', 'Bell', 'Boy', '34', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'singing', 'screen.Those', 'projections', 'old', 'days', 'performances', 'are', 'only', 'present', '34', 'Quadrophenia', '34', 'album', 'not', 'bonus', 'songs', 'end', 'have', 'many', 'musicians', 'stage', 'including', 'horn', 'players', 'Simon', 'Townsend', 'who', 'signs', 'Pete', '34', 'Dirty', 'Jobs', '34', 'Also', 'two', 'keyboardists', 'mostly', 'piano', 'hear', 'show.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'DTS', 'HD', 'mix', 'also', 'nice', 'must', 'Who', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'old', 'band', 'context', 'new', 'technology', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', '34', 'Quadrophenia', '34']",N/A
