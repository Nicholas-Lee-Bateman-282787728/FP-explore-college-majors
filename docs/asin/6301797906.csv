I already had the DVD of the movie and played it also and that has a better image than the Blu Ray, it is not for the first time this happened. The image of the Blu Ray is not constant and moving a little now and then. And I do have a good and not cheap Blu Ray player. And the DVD was a joy to see again. Besides that Amazon says it has subtitles in english, spanish and french and that is also what is mentioned on the box, however to my joy it has a lot more subtitles, even Dutch my own language. I had seen this mentioned on ""Beaver.com"" a very reliable source that also mentions if a Blu Ray is Regionfree. I became aware of Beaver through a letter on Amazon where someone said that people better should look at that site because it is very reliable and good, and that is correct. A Blu Ray can be better ofcourse. I also just bought the Blu Ray of ""Buck Privates"" from Universal and that image was very good, even better than I had expected for a movie from 1941.The included DVD also had a good image.",4,DVD Better than Blu Ray,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,1138,"['just', 'received', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'immediately', 'went', 'see', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'already', 'had', 'DVD', 'movie', 'played', 'also', 'better', 'image', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'happened', 'image', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'not', 'constant', 'moving', 'little', 'now', 'then', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'not', 'cheap', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'DVD', 'was', 'joy', 'see', 'again', 'Amazon', 'subtitles', 'english', 'spanish', 'french', 'also', 'what', 'mentioned', 'box', 'however', 'joy', 'lot', 'more', 'subtitles', 'even', 'Dutch', 'own', 'language', 'had', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'Beaver.com', 'very', 'reliable', 'source', 'also', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Regionfree', 'became', 'aware', 'Beaver', 'letter', 'Amazon', 'where', 'someone', 'said', 'people', 'better', 'should', 'look', 'site', 'very', 'reliable', 'good', 'correct', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'ofcourse', 'also', 'just', 'bought', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Buck', 'Privates', 'Universal', 'image', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'movie', '1941.The', 'included', 'DVD', 'also', 'had', 'good', 'image']",N/A
266417,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301797906,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","This review was written for John Steinbeck's book of the same name. The main points here also apply to the movie. Take advantage of both media to get a real feel for this classic of the 1930's.Oddly, I first read John Steinbeck's classic tale of the 1930's depression, Grapes of Wrath, as a result of listening to Woody Guthrie's also classic Dustbowl Ballads. In that album Woody sings/narrates the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they get the hell out of drought-stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California. After listening to that rendition I wanted to get the full story and Steinbeck did not fail me. His tightly-woven story stands as a very strong exposition of the plight of rural America as they tried to make sense of a vengeful God, unrelenting Nature and the down-side of the American dream. For those who have seem Walker Evans's and other photographers pictures of the Okies, Arkies, etc. of the period this is the story behind those forlorn, if stoic, faces.The story line is actually very simple. The land in Oklahoma was played out, the banks nevertheless were pressing for payment or threatening foreclosure and for the Joads, as for others, time had run out. In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start. With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams. Their struggle along the way is a modern day version of the struggles of the old Westward heading wagon trains-including the causalities. But, that is not the least of it. Apparently they had not read Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that the frontier was gone- the land was taken. The bulk of the story centers of what happened when they get to the golden land-and it is not pretty. Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem-you know, California, the real California of the day. Not the Chamber of Commerce version. In short, as Woody sang, no hope if you aint got the do re mi.Grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography. So here is the list. Listen to Woody sing the tale. Watch Henry Fonda to act it out. And by all means read Steinbeck. He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California. What happened to those people later and their influence on California culture and those who didn't make it are chronicled by others like Howard Fast and Nelson Algren. But for this period your man is Steinbeck.",4,IF YOU AINT GOT THE DO RE MI,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,2632,"['review', 'was', 'written', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'main', 'points', 'here', 'also', 'apply', 'movie', 'Take', 'advantage', 'media', 'get', 'real', 'feel', 'classic', ""1930's.Oddly"", 'first', 'read', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'classic', 'tale', '1930', 'depression', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'result', 'listening', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'also', 'classic', 'Dustbowl', 'Ballads', 'album', 'Woody', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Joad', 'family', 'get', 'hell', 'drought-stricken', 'Oklahoma', 'headed', 'land', 'milk', 'honey', 'California', 'listening', 'rendition', 'wanted', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'Steinbeck', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'tightly-woven', 'story', 'very', 'strong', 'exposition', 'plight', 'rural', 'America', 'tried', 'make', 'sense', 'vengeful', 'God', 'unrelenting', 'Nature', 'down-side', 'American', 'dream', 'who', 'have', 'seem', 'Walker', 'Evans', 'other', 'photographers', 'pictures', 'Okies', 'Arkies', 'etc', 'period', 'story', 'forlorn', 'stoic', 'faces.The', 'story', 'line', 'actually', 'very', 'simple', 'land', 'Oklahoma', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'banks', 'nevertheless', 'were', 'pressing', 'payment', 'threatening', 'foreclosure', 'Joads', 'others', 'time', 'had', 'run', 'out', 'classic', 'American', 'tradition', 'pulled', 'up', 'stakes', 'headed', 'west', 'get', 'new', 'start', 'great', 'hopes', 'few', 'illusions', 'set', 'out', 'family', 'sunny', 'plentiful', 'California', 'dreams', 'struggle', 'way', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'struggles', 'old', 'Westward', 'heading', 'wagon', 'trains-including', 'causalities', 'not', 'least', 'Apparently', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'Frederick', 'Jackson', 'Turner', 'thesis', 'frontier', 'was', 'gone-', 'land', 'was', 'taken', 'bulk', 'story', 'centers', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'get', 'golden', 'land-and', 'not', 'pretty', 'Day', 'labor', 'work', 'camps', 'strike', 'action', 'murder', 'mayhem-you', 'know', 'California', 'real', 'California', 'day', 'Not', 'Chamber', 'Commerce', 'version', 'short', 'Woody', 'sang', 'hope', 'aint', 'got', 'do', 're', 'mi.Grapes', 'Wrath', 'was', 'made', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'starring', 'young', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'day', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'depressed', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'only', 'photography', 'So', 'here', 'list', 'Listen', 'Woody', 'sing', 'tale', 'Watch', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'act', 'out', 'means', 'read', 'Steinbeck', 'had', 'ear', '1930', 'struggle', 'Okies', 'ilk', 'hit', 'California', 'What', 'happened', 'people', 'later', 'influence', 'California', 'culture', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'are', 'chronicled', 'others', 'Howard', 'Fast', 'Nelson', 'Algren', 'period', 'man', 'Steinbeck']",N/A
266418,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301797906,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Giving this film an `A' and calling it a masterpiece is really a given, so I'm just going to get that part of it out of the way.  The film is a beautiful and moving epic, complete with stellar performances, poignant life lessons and dramatic (and authentic) presence of life and destiny.  To consider this John Ford's triumph is not too farfetched if I say so myself.That said, this film rests oddly with me.For me, `The Grapes of Wrath' is John Ford's `Schindler's List' (or, I guess I should say that `Schindler's List' is Spielberg's `The Grapes of Wrath').  It is a moving and very `important' film that doesn't strike me the way I expected due to a coldness that permeates the screen.  The film is filled with elements and situations that would bring a stone-faced man to his knees, and yet I was more haunted than I was moved.  There is a detachment I felt here that, like `Schindler', works just as much as it doesn't.Like I said in my review of `Schindler's List', it may be an empty argument, but it is one worth raising.This film is based off the novel by Steinbeck, which I haven't read but have on my reading list.  I know that this film, while faithful, has altered the source material a tad (especially in the ending) but so few complaints have been thrown that way, even from devoted fans of the novel.  The film was made at a time when a `happy ending' or at least the portrayal of hope was needed.  A film depicting the raw and harsh realities of the depression needed to end on a high note if it was going to lift any spirits.  Even with the altered ending though, `The Grapes of Wrath' is a real downer, a film that exposes humanity at its coldest and cruelest (although I was moved more by the slivers of kindness).The story is that of the Joad family, a group of hard working, loving people who are forced out of their homes and sent looking for work.  Tom, the eldest son, was recently released from prison, and he serves as the head of the house basically, helping his parents and siblings make their long journey to California.  Along the way they meet greed and desperation in many forms.The acting is a triumph here on all ends.  Henry Fonda carries a solemn understanding in his eyes as he watches everything around him crumble, and he really carries every scene of this film.  John Carradine is also fantastic as Casy, the former preacher who has lost his spirit due to the circumstances that engulf him.  Standout here is Jane Darwell, who actually won the Oscar for her tremendous performance.  Her pleading with Tom to stay and help her, oh, that moment touched me more than any other moment in the film.`The Grapes of Wrath' is a film that is filled with frustration and depression, but as the final frames begin to roll we are offered a sliver of hope, as Ma Joad swells our hearts with her ideals on humanity and the will to survive.Still...Like I said, there is a detachment here.  It is a great movie, one that gets everything perfect, and, like `Schindler', that is the big problem.  Everything is `too' perfect.  I know that it seems like a weak complaint (and if this goes anything like my `Schindler's List' review, it won't be a popular one either) but it is a legit one if you look at it properly.  Everything is so `authentic' that it runs the gamut of stiff and feels nearly documented.  It takes away from the languid naturalness of the nature of film.  Like I said, debating the films brilliance is ridiculous, but for a film that is primed and ready to move you, this one may not do it one the immediate.This makes sense to me, but then again, it's me!",5,An undisputed masterpiece leaves me with an odd feeling...,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,3599,"['Giving', 'film', 'A', 'calling', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'given', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'get', 'part', 'way', 'film', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'epic', 'complete', 'stellar', 'performances', 'poignant', 'life', 'lessons', 'dramatic', 'authentic', 'presence', 'life', 'destiny', 'consider', 'John', 'Ford', 'triumph', 'not', 'too', 'farfetched', 'say', 'so', 'myself.That', 'said', 'film', 'oddly', 'me.For', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'John', 'Ford', 'Schindler', 'List', 'guess', 'should', 'say', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Spielberg', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'moving', 'very', 'important', 'film', ""n't"", 'strike', 'way', 'expected', 'due', 'coldness', 'screen', 'film', 'filled', 'elements', 'situations', 'would', 'bring', 'stone-faced', 'man', 'knees', 'yet', 'was', 'more', 'haunted', 'was', 'moved', 'detachment', 'felt', 'here', 'Schindler', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'said', 'review', 'Schindler', 'List', 'may', 'be', 'empty', 'argument', 'one', 'worth', 'raising.This', 'film', 'based', 'off', 'novel', 'Steinbeck', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'have', 'reading', 'list', 'know', 'film', 'faithful', 'altered', 'source', 'material', 'tad', 'especially', 'ending', 'so', 'few', 'complaints', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'way', 'even', 'devoted', 'fans', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'happy', 'ending', 'least', 'portrayal', 'hope', 'was', 'needed', 'film', 'depicting', 'raw', 'harsh', 'realities', 'depression', 'needed', 'end', 'high', 'note', 'was', 'going', 'lift', 'spirits', 'Even', 'altered', 'ending', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'real', 'downer', 'film', 'humanity', 'coldest', 'cruelest', 'was', 'moved', 'more', 'slivers', 'kindness', '.The', 'story', 'Joad', 'family', 'group', 'hard', 'working', 'loving', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'homes', 'sent', 'looking', 'work', 'Tom', 'eldest', 'son', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'head', 'house', 'basically', 'helping', 'parents', 'siblings', 'make', 'long', 'journey', 'California', 'way', 'meet', 'greed', 'desperation', 'many', 'forms.The', 'acting', 'triumph', 'here', 'ends', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'solemn', 'understanding', 'eyes', 'everything', 'crumble', 'really', 'scene', 'film', 'John', 'Carradine', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Casy', 'former', 'preacher', 'who', 'lost', 'spirit', 'due', 'circumstances', 'engulf', 'Standout', 'here', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'who', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'pleading', 'Tom', 'stay', 'help', 'oh', 'moment', 'touched', 'more', 'other', 'moment', 'film.', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'film', 'filled', 'frustration', 'depression', 'final', 'frames', 'begin', 'roll', 'are', 'offered', 'sliver', 'hope', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'hearts', 'ideals', 'humanity', 'will', 'survive.Still', 'said', 'detachment', 'here', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'everything', 'perfect', 'Schindler', 'big', 'problem', 'Everything', 'too', 'perfect', 'know', 'weak', 'complaint', 'anything', 'Schindler', 'List', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'popular', 'one', 'either', 'legit', 'one', 'look', 'properly', 'Everything', 'so', 'authentic', 'gamut', 'stiff', 'feels', 'nearly', 'documented', 'away', 'languid', 'naturalness', 'nature', 'film', 'said', 'debating', 'films', 'brilliance', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'primed', 'ready', 'move', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'do', 'one', 'immediate.This', 'sense', 'then', 'again']",N/A

The police were the private army for the ruling class back then too. They beat, imprisoned,and murdered those who stood up for their human rights. Some things don't seem to change.I recently purchased another DVD on Amazon titled Walkout, which is about the 1968 protests by high school students in east L.A.who were being abused in the government schools. The movie Walkout also showed the police beating the high school studentswith clubs who were standing up for their human rights. And then you can flash forward to today where we saw how the policeare continuing to beat and even kill people in the Occupy Movement who were standing up for the human rights of the Americanpeople.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect the dots and see where the heart of the problem is. The ruling elite always choose tooppress the poor people, and they have so far, gotten away with it, because they have their own private army of police officers.Only now their private army of police look more like U.S. military.It is a shame that wealthy people have to be so greedy and abuse poor folks like they did in this movie The Grapes of Wrath.",5,All American's Should Watch This Movie,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,1808,"['movie', 'important', 'part', 'American', 'history', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'forgotten', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'about.All', 'American', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'will', 'know', 'part', 'American', 'history.The', 'Joad', 'family', 'were', 'forced', 'leave', 'home', 'Oklahoma', 'Dust', 'Bowl.And', 'land', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'greedy', 'wealthy', 'elite.They', 'were', 'told', 'go', 'California', 'where', 'everyone', 'could', 'find', 'work', 'home', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.They', 'were', 'lied', 'to.You', 'get', 'see', 'reality', 'Labor', 'Camps', 'lived', 'how', 'badly', 'were', 'treated', 'land', 'owners', 'landowners', 'personal', 'army', 'police', 'officers', 'police', 'were', 'private', 'army', 'ruling', 'class', 'back', 'then', 'too', 'beat', 'imprisoned', 'murdered', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'human', 'rights', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'change.I', 'recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'titled', 'Walkout', '1968', 'protests', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'east', 'L.A.who', 'were', 'being', 'abused', 'government', 'schools', 'movie', 'Walkout', 'also', 'showed', 'police', 'beating', 'high', 'school', 'studentswith', 'clubs', 'who', 'were', 'standing', 'up', 'human', 'rights', 'then', 'can', 'flash', 'forward', 'today', 'where', 'saw', 'how', 'policeare', 'continuing', 'beat', 'even', 'kill', 'people', 'Occupy', 'Movement', 'who', 'were', 'standing', 'up', 'human', 'rights', 'Americanpeople.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'connect', 'dots', 'see', 'where', 'heart', 'problem', 'ruling', 'elite', 'always', 'choose', 'poor', 'people', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'gotten', 'away', 'have', 'own', 'private', 'army', 'police', 'officers.Only', 'now', 'private', 'army', 'police', 'look', 'more', 'U.S.', 'military.It', 'shame', 'wealthy', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'greedy', 'abuse', 'poor', 'folks', 'did', 'movie', 'Grapes', 'Wrath']",N/A

This is allegory at its finest and its practice may be something that the average is incapable of nowadays. The Grapes of Wrath is considered Steinbeck's most important novel, but, even if it wasn't, the plot fits the big screen in the manner of building size saran wrap.

We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.""The history of the Dustbowl Era is one that looms large in the minds of most of my family. The mere fact that some of us were born in Washington to people that came from Kansas and Oklahoma explains volumes about what it must've been like in those places back in the day when you could have a wonderful crop one year, and the next year you could be turned out of your house and home.John Ford's 1940 film version of John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a flim like none other. Listed on many critics film lists as the best ever made, at least prior to ""Citizen Kane"" showing up in that position starting in the late 1950's, it tells the story of the Joad family, uprooted from their home in Oklahoma and sent hurtling into a new life in California.As the family travels to California, they deal with many setbacks, including the deaths of two of their clan. When they finally reach California, they find that a glut of cheap labor has led to depressed wages, meaning that for a whole day's work they earn barely enough to scrape by.Eventually after many trials and tribulations, the family reaches a camp run by the government (with a camp superintendent played by a man who actually did run such a camp in reality). There the family finds a safe place to live, decent wages, and a hopeful future... at least until the past catches up with one family member.While Henry Fonda plays the protaganist in this movie, the real stand-out star is Jane Darwell, who played Ma Joad. From her first real scene, where she expresses concerns her son might've turned ""mean"" while in prison, to a touching farewell to her possessions when she tosses them into a stove before leaving, to the end, where she has one last dance with her son then gets the last words in the film (those at the start of the article), every moment she's on the screen is incredible. It's a movie worth seeing for performance alone. Women like her are, to a great extent, what this country is built on.This was also a very political film. It was one of the first films to show poverty, true, soul-crushing poverty, in the United States. Most of are fortunate enough not to know what it's like to nearly starve to death (heck, put all the family together and we'd start to influence the tides), but in the not-so-distant past people were starving, dying, on the streets of our nation. Not because they were lazy, or foolish, but because they were being destroyed by a system that had left them to fend for themselves.It also explored, somewhat obliquely, ideas of Communism that were floating around at the time. There was a large, simmering, vocal minority that believed only Communism could save the workers of the world from exploitation at the hands of big business. Looking at the way the world was then, one begins to sypathise.All in all, this is a very personal film that's also quite epic. You see the sweeping panoramas for which Ford is rightly famous, but then you also get the small strokes, the tiny personal touches, such as when the children see flush toilets for the first time. It's a must-see for anyone interested in history, and anyone interested in film.",5,John Ford + John Steinbeck = Amazing,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,3368,"['Rich', 'fellas', 'come', 'up', 'die', 'kids', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'good', 'die', 'out', 'keep', ""'re"", 'people', 'live', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wipe', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lick', ""'ll"", 'go', 'forever', 'Pa', ""'re"", 'people', 'history', 'Dustbowl', 'Era', 'one', 'large', 'minds', 'most', 'family', 'mere', 'fact', 'were', 'born', 'Washington', 'people', 'came', 'Kansas', 'Oklahoma', 'volumes', 'what', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'places', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'wonderful', 'crop', 'one', 'year', 'next', 'year', 'could', 'be', 'turned', 'house', 'home.John', 'Ford', '1940', 'film', 'version', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'flim', 'none', 'other', 'Listed', 'many', 'critics', 'film', 'lists', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'least', 'prior', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'showing', 'up', 'position', 'starting', 'late', '1950', 'story', 'Joad', 'family', 'uprooted', 'home', 'Oklahoma', 'sent', 'hurtling', 'new', 'life', 'California.As', 'family', 'California', 'deal', 'many', 'setbacks', 'including', 'deaths', 'two', 'clan', 'When', 'finally', 'reach', 'California', 'find', 'glut', 'cheap', 'labor', 'led', 'depressed', 'wages', 'meaning', 'whole', 'day', 'work', 'earn', 'barely', 'enough', 'scrape', 'by.Eventually', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'family', 'camp', 'run', 'government', 'camp', 'superintendent', 'played', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'run', 'camp', 'reality', 'family', 'safe', 'place', 'live', 'decent', 'wages', 'hopeful', 'future', 'least', 'past', 'catches', 'one', 'family', 'member.While', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'protaganist', 'movie', 'real', 'stand-out', 'star', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'who', 'played', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'first', 'real', 'scene', 'where', 'concerns', 'son', 'might', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'mean', 'prison', 'touching', 'farewell', 'possessions', 'when', 'stove', 'leaving', 'end', 'where', 'one', 'last', 'dance', 'son', 'then', 'last', 'words', 'film', 'start', 'article', 'moment', 'screen', 'incredible', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'performance', 'alone', 'Women', 'are', 'great', 'extent', 'what', 'country', 'built', 'on.This', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'political', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'show', 'poverty', 'true', 'soul-crushing', 'poverty', 'United', 'States', 'Most', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'nearly', 'starve', 'death', 'heck', 'put', 'family', 'together', ""'d"", 'start', 'influence', 'tides', 'not-so-distant', 'past', 'people', 'were', 'starving', 'dying', 'streets', 'nation', 'Not', 'were', 'lazy', 'foolish', 'were', 'being', 'destroyed', 'system', 'had', 'left', 'fend', 'themselves.It', 'also', 'explored', 'somewhat', 'obliquely', 'ideas', 'Communism', 'were', 'floating', 'around', 'time', 'was', 'large', 'simmering', 'vocal', 'minority', 'believed', 'only', 'Communism', 'could', 'save', 'workers', 'world', 'exploitation', 'hands', 'big', 'business', 'Looking', 'way', 'world', 'was', 'then', 'one', 'sypathise.All', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'epic', 'see', 'sweeping', 'panoramas', 'Ford', 'rightly', 'famous', 'then', 'also', 'get', 'small', 'strokes', 'tiny', 'personal', 'touches', 'such', 'when', 'children', 'see', 'flush', 'toilets', 'first', 'time', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'anyone', 'interested', 'film']",N/A

Though slow-paced, the movie gets you very emotionally involved in his family's journey from Dust Bowl-destroyed Oklahoma to California, because you sympathize with Fonda and the rest of his family immediately.  From the beginning, he seems like he's a bit scared and kind of helpless, and all of them feel that way about leaving their land.  Once in California, the family is no better off.  As I found out on the audiocommentary, the Farmers' Association in California terrorized migrant farmers about as badly as the KKK terrorized black people.  They exploited migrant farmers and looked down on them for being hickish, and smeared anyone who wanted better pay as a ""Communist"".  They had thugs trying to create conflict so they could intimidate organized labor.  It was interesting to learn that John Steinbeck, the author, was not himself a communist, but felt people ought not to be quick to stereotype anyone with communist views as ""un-American"".  The movie is said to be a lot more hopeful and less politically radical than the book.  Steinbeck said he wanted the book to be revealing, not satisfying, and provoke people to enact social reform.  It really opened my eyes to the day-to-day difficulties of surviving in poverty.  Director John Ford is very visually expressive, and on this, he has Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland working with him, creating a starkness with shadows, a closeness to the land through the composition of the shots, and a documentary feeling.  On the back of the disc are a documentary about the Fox studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, and several other smaller features.  This is not a ""fun"" movie, but it is worthwhile and should make you forever more sympathetic to the plight of the poor.About the Darryl Zanuck documentary on the back of the disc:For a general story of 20th Century Fox and its contributions to entertainment, look no further than this biography of Darryl F. Zanuck. A & E Biography always does well at combining personal and private, film footage and interviews, and narration in a fast-paced, meaningful way. This documentary is on the DVD of The Grapes of Wrath. You learn about the person of Darryl Zanuck and some of the risks and contributions he made to cinema. One thing I found particularly interesting is that The Longest Day and The Sound of Music were both made under intense financial pressure to recover from the extremely wasteful spending of Cleopatra (which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton). Some of Zanuck's unique contributions were his willingness, like Harry Warner of Warner Brothers, to shine light on disturbing social problems, and that he used CinemaScope to get people going back to theaters after television threatened the movie industry.",5,One of a kind; reveals the life of the very poor,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2817,"['Henry', 'Fonda', 'so', 'believable', 'starring', 'role', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'slow-paced', 'movie', 'very', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'family', 'journey', 'Dust', 'Bowl-destroyed', 'Oklahoma', 'California', 'sympathize', 'Fonda', 'rest', 'family', 'immediately', 'beginning', 'bit', 'scared', 'kind', 'helpless', 'feel', 'way', 'leaving', 'land', 'Once', 'California', 'family', 'better', 'off', 'found', 'out', 'audiocommentary', 'Farmers', 'Association', 'California', 'terrorized', 'migrant', 'farmers', 'as', 'badly', 'KKK', 'terrorized', 'black', 'people', 'exploited', 'migrant', 'farmers', 'looked', 'down', 'being', 'hickish', 'smeared', 'anyone', 'who', 'wanted', 'better', 'pay', 'Communist', 'had', 'thugs', 'trying', 'create', 'conflict', 'could', 'intimidate', 'organized', 'labor', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'author', 'was', 'not', 'communist', 'felt', 'people', 'ought', 'not', 'be', 'quick', 'stereotype', 'anyone', 'communist', 'views', 'un-American', 'movie', 'said', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'hopeful', 'less', 'politically', 'radical', 'book', 'Steinbeck', 'said', 'wanted', 'book', 'be', 'revealing', 'not', 'satisfying', 'provoke', 'people', 'enact', 'social', 'reform', 'really', 'opened', 'eyes', 'day-to-day', 'difficulties', 'surviving', 'poverty', 'Director', 'John', 'Ford', 'very', 'visually', 'expressive', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'working', 'creating', 'starkness', 'shadows', 'closeness', 'land', 'composition', 'shots', 'documentary', 'feeling', 'back', 'disc', 'are', 'documentary', 'Fox', 'studio', 'head', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'several', 'other', 'smaller', 'features', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'should', 'make', 'forever', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'poor.About', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'documentary', 'back', 'disc', 'general', 'story', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'contributions', 'entertainment', 'look', 'further', 'biography', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'always', 'well', 'combining', 'personal', 'private', 'film', 'footage', 'interviews', 'narration', 'fast-paced', 'meaningful', 'way', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'learn', 'person', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'risks', 'contributions', 'made', 'cinema', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Sound', 'Music', 'were', 'made', 'intense', 'financial', 'pressure', 'recover', 'extremely', 'wasteful', 'spending', 'Cleopatra', 'starred', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Zanuck', 'unique', 'contributions', 'were', 'willingness', 'Harry', 'Warner', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'shine', 'light', 'disturbing', 'social', 'problems', 'used', 'CinemaScope', 'get', 'people', 'going', 'back', 'theaters', 'television', 'threatened', 'movie', 'industry']",N/A
266430,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6301797906,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[8, 8]","""The Grapes of Wrath,"" John Ford's unforgettable 1940 drama, is a spiritual horror film. I had never before read John Steinbeck's famous novel (The Grapes of Wrath) and finally sat down to watch the film one dark night with the lights turned off. It terrified me. An uneducated farming family is thrown off of their land and they must travel thousands of miles through an apocalyptic, uncaring world. Like famous pioneer wagon trains before them, they suffer through the death of family members, starvation and ridicule, all the while slowly migrating towards what is supposed to be a California American Eden.In his most famous performance, Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a recently paroled convict walking alone on the highway towards his parents' Oklahoma farm. Joad encounters a preacher who has lost the faith (John Carradine, in what is most likely his most famous role as well), and together they travel the barren land. They arrive to find Tom's home abandoned. An endless drought has rendered the land into a dust bowl and the Depression (The Great Depression: America 1929-1941) has robbed sharecroppers of their livelihood. With a wind continuously howling, they stay in the lonely house for the night. By the light of a candle, they discuss their uncertain future and are visited by a haunted neighbor whose farm has been bulldozed by bankers. He now roams the land as a pauper, a ""ghost in a graveyard.""These opening scenes are disturbing, portraying hopeless men forgotten by a bankrupt American society. Their way of life - sharecropping a small farm, a lifestyle existing for centuries - has abruptly come to an end. Tom finds his family at his uncle's neighboring spread, where he famously smiles for the first time when encountering his mother (Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell in an Oscar-winning performance). They are loading up a creaking 1926 Hudson truck with all of their possessions, grandparents and children, and heading for California armed with a flyer promoting 800 jobs for fruit pickers. Unknown to them, tens of thousands of people are traveling the same route armed with an identical flyer.There was time when ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered the greatest American film ever made (John Ford: The Man and His Films), an epic work portraying the struggles of common people surviving terrible hardship. It still packs a heavy punch, though is downgraded today for broadly drawn characters bordering on caricature. Youthful critics find the Joad's mode of travel comedic. And conservatives dislike the film's politics involving unions and the scent of Socialist attitudes. Steinbeck praised the work, a rare vote of confidence for Hollywood from a major author. The film was made in 1939, two years before the outbreak of World War II effectively ending the Depression. People were still traveling Route 66 (Route 66: Spirit of the Mother Road) for the California promise land and several loaded down trucks akin to the Joad's were in fact driving the same on-location route and used for background footage.I found the scenes at the pauper camps, where gangs of starving children surrounded the Joad's campfire, to be deeply troubling. America portrayed as a Third World country is not the stuff of fantasy or romance. But if you look at the famous 1936 Dorothea Lange photograph of a mother and her children (Dorothea Lange), you know Ford was not far from the truth. Personally, I am the son of a woman who grew up on a sharecropper's farm and recall childhood family reunions when aunts and uncles discussed mule-drawn wagons and walking several miles to school. Grandparents, some of whom were suffering from Alzheimer's akin to this film's Grandpa and Grandma (Charley Grapewin, Zeffie Tilbury), had to be cared for with great love and tolerance. I knew the film's characters and understood their frustrations and insecurities.I recall traveling with these family members and how they would reroute a long journey to bypass urban areas. My uncles wore overalls like the Joads. They listened to Bob Wills, very much akin to the rural ballads (""Going Down the Road Feeling Bad,"" ""Red River Valley"") of this film. Within me, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" struck a deeply mournful chord. Ford gets so much right with his heartbreaking portrayals, and the extraordinary detail of set decoration mixed with authentic on-location footage creates an unparalleled documentary of an American time and place. Cinematographer Gregg Toland (who would go on to great fame withCitizen Kane (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] two years later) deserves credit for shooting some of the most vivid scenes in history. Solemn travelers surrounding campfires or an impromptu roadside funeral resemble works of American Regionalist art (Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry).Perhaps the most haunting scene is the family traveling by night across the deadly expanse of the Mojave Desert. By the light of the moon, sinister Yucca trees pass the windows and children stare from the apparent safety of the truck bed, amazed at the solemnity of the land. The Joads pray for the truck to cross the endless desolation before sunrise, alone on an odyssey but for the unity of each other. They say ""Citizen Kane"" supplanted this film as the greatest in American history. From where I sit, the roots of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" go much deeper into the soil.",5,Much deeper into the soil...,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,5441,"['Grapes', 'Wrath', 'John', 'Ford',

266431,AJ98YA4Y333BK,6301797906,"CJA ""CJA""","[2, 3]","John Ford plays it straight in this film adaptation of Steinbeck's novel about the Odyssey of a displaced Oklahoma clan to California in search of work during the Great Depression.  Steinbeck's knowledge of California and his work as a journalist gave him a wealth of material for his novel, and several of his most unforgettable scenes are faithfully recreated in the film.The prejudice of the native Californians against the Okies, the exploitation of the migrant workers, the cruel disappointments of the Okies, and the nobility of their struggle to survive so vividly captured by Steinbeck are successfully realized in Ford's film.Ford makes his actors act.  Lots of close ups on eyes, silhouetted against dark and dreary backgrounds.  These are real actors, with a background in the theater, who know their craft.Because the film is so faithful to the book, one may as well just read the book, which is Steinbeck's best and deserves its place in the pantheon of great American novels.  But the film does have two advantages.  First, it is made only a year or two after the Depression, so the mood and times are well captured in some of the backgrounds and in the faces of the actors.  Second, and most importantly, there is Henry Fonda.  Fonda's ability to portray the rage of Tom Joad that lurks beneath the surface and to articulate in spare words and expressions the unfairness of the treatment of the Okies is extraordinary.  This is one of the great pieces of acting in the history of American film.The progressive spirit of the film and the, I think, justified bashing of the rich given the history of the times may be a bit jarring to the modern viewer.  But I found that element of the film to be fascinating.Ford's ending is a bit more uplifting and hopeful than Steinbeck's, with its famous scene of a new mother nursing a struggling Okie.  Can't put that kind of stuff on the screen in 1940.  Ford ends with the message that the Okies are survivors and that the poor and meek shall inherit the Earth.  It's not exactly what ended up happening, though the lot of the poor in America has certainly improved, and the kind of prejudice portrayed in the film is now universally reviled.An excellent job by Ford and an even better job by Fonda.",5,Fonda Makes the Film,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,2254,"['John', 'Ford', 'straight', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Steinbeck', 'novel', 'Odyssey', 'displaced', 'Oklahoma', 'clan', 'California', 'search', 'work', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Steinbeck', 'knowledge', 'California', 'work', 'journalist', 'gave', 'wealth', 'material', 'novel', 'several', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'are', 'faithfully', 'recreated', 'film.The', 'prejudice', 'native', 'Californians', 'Okies', 'exploitation', 'migrant', 'workers', 'cruel', 'disappointments', 'Okies', 'nobility', 'struggle', 'survive', 'so', 'vividly', 'captured', 'Steinbeck', 'are', 'successfully', 'realized', 'Ford', 'film.Ford', 'actors', 'act', 'Lots', 'close', 'ups', 'eyes', 'silhouetted', 'dark', 'dreary', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'real', 'actors', 'background', 'theater', 'who', 'know', 'craft.Because', 'film', 'so', 'faithful', 'book', 'one', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'Steinbeck', 'best', 'place', 'pantheon', 'great', 'American', 'novels', 'film', 'have', 'two', 'advantages', 'First', 'made', 'only', 'year', 'two', 'Depression', 'mood', 'times', 'are', 'well', 'captured', 'backgrounds', 'actors', 'Second', 'most', 'importantly', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Fonda', 'ability', 'portray', 'rage', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'surface', 'articulate', 'spare', 'words', 'expressions', 'unfairness', 'treatment', 'Okies', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'great', 'pieces', 'acting', 'history', 'American', 'film.The', 'progressive', 'spirit', 'film', 'think', 'justified', 'bashing', 'rich', 'given', 'history', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'jarring', 'modern', 'viewer', 'found', 'element', 'film', 'be', 'fascinating.Ford', 'ending', 'bit', 'more', 'uplifting', 'hopeful', 'Steinbeck', 'famous', 'scene', 'new', 'mother', 'nursing', 'struggling', 'Okie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'kind', 'stuff', 'screen', '1940', 'Ford', 'message', 'Okies', 'are', 'survivors', 'poor', 'meek', 'shall', 'inherit', 'Earth', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'happening', 'lot', 'poor', 'America', 'certainly', 'improved', 'kind', 'prejudice', 'portrayed', 'film', 'now', 'universally', 'reviled.An', 'excellent', 'job', 'Ford', 'even', 'better', 'job', 'Fonda']",N/A

266437,A3MYELGY9U5Q7Q,6301797906,"Curtis Chambers ""Curtis Chambers""","[0, 0]","I recently re-watched this well known movie classic. Made in 1940 and starring a young Henry Fonda, it is perhaps the most famous movie about the Great Depression in America. When I saw the film as a kid, the movie seemed sort of a quaint joke or curiosity. How could something like that ever happen in this country? Today it doesn't seem so funny...This movie is definitely not a pick me upper, but not every movie can be a comedy or a mindless action spectacle.  The plot concerns a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers who are evicted from their farm. Jobless, with no prospects and little money, the large family piles into a dilapidated truck and heads off to California in search of work. A ex-preacher turned homeless wanderer, played wonderfully by John Carradine, accompanies them.  Along the way Grandma and Grandfather die, and one of the brothers deserts his pregnant wife. The family is close to starving. They take what jobs they can picking fruit. Finally, they land on a Government run New Deal farm and life improves a bit. Henry Fonda, the oldest son, becomes and a political activist and leaves the family.There is also a theme in the movie in which anyone associated with capitalism is depicted as fascist and quite brutal. Cops in uniform work for the land owners and will not hesitate to kill the farm workers if they get out of line. The land owners try to take advantage of the very poor farmers plight by paying poverty level wages. The only one sympathetic to their plight is the government run New Deal farm. So the movie is in theme almost likeAnimal Farmin reverse. This time the Capitalists, rather than the Socialists, are the bad guys.  Very interesting.So why watch this movie now? Well, the themes are apropos, unfortunately. Families being evicted from homes, joblessness, and lives in turmoil has again become common. Henry Fonda is a marvelous actor and this is one of his finest performances. And the specter of watching children that are hungry and growing up in such difficult circumstances in America is heartbreaking.When I first saw this film, I assumed the Depression could never happen again.

Markel,"[4, 5]","This review is for the 2003 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.The movie opens with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returning home from prison due to killing a man who stabbed him in a dance hall fight.  When Tom returns to his home community in rural dustbowl Oklahoma, he learns that the banks are running off all the families who have worked on their farms for several generations.  Joad's entire extended family plus a friend, Casey (John Carradine), are left with no choice but to journey west to California since it appears to be the land of opportunity.  So they pile everyone and everything they own on an old dilapidated truck and head west.  The rest of the movie shows the trials and tribulations of this arduous trip as well as the obstacles they face in California.The cinematography of this film is gripping, not because of visual beauty - far from it - but for the realism of the filthiness and poverty.  But even beyond the squalor, the story masterfully reveals in poignant fashion the life and death hardships and day-to-day hope for survival.  The acting is great, especially by Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who won an Oscar for her performance.  The movie is a bit heavy-handed with some obvious communist propaganda depicting privately owned farms as tyrannical and fatally oppressive, while government sponsored camps appearing utopian in every aspect.  But overlooking the political overtones, the best message to take from the movie is the importance of family and the will for survival.As for the DVD, the picture was restored, but not perfectly restored, since some deterioration is still visible, but the overall presentation is very adequate for a film made in 1940.  The sound is very good too, but at times seems to have a hollow sound to it.  There are plenty of bonus features on this double-sided DVD.

I was always blinded by the film's top-notch artistry but I think I was missing the forest for the trees.  What dawned on me was that writer John Steinbeck and director John Ford were mad.  Not just regular mad but mean and mad.  The outrage stems from how a democracy such as ours could mistreat it's citizens at a time when they needed help the most.  Adding insult to injury the disenfranchised were subjected to any number of psychological and physical injuries to their person.  No wonder the New Deal was such a godsend.  And I'm a Republican!  Despite the presence of a top-of-the line star in Henry Fonda, Ford and lensman Gregg Toland give the film a cinema-verite style that makes you believe you are watching a documentary instead of a filmed novel.  The forlorn faces on display don't appear to come from Central Casting.  You can actually taste the dust that's the remnants of the sharecroppers prior trade.  Fonda, in probably the best performance of his career, gives an understated account of Tom Joad, parolee turned activist that's both convincing and sincere.  Jane Darwell, as Ma Joad, gives one of the all-time great performances by an actress, supporting or otherwise.  The worldweariness on Ma's face tells it all.  A defining scene in the film is one where Ma tries to feed the family while a group of malnutrioned children look on.  You can sense the agony as Ma, with meager food supplies, tries to figure out how to provide for her kin without turning the children away.

These films have been referenced and parodied numerous times, and some of them have very faithful followers (like how I am with The Godfather films). The Grapes of Wrath, on the other hand, hasn't really reached the same legendary status as other classic films, but it's just as great. I haven't read the original Steinbeck novel just yet, but the film still amazes me even if I didn't read it. Both the film and novel focus on the Great Depression, and one family who tries to get away from all the poverty by traveling to California. This is a drama made in 1940 that relies heavily on dialogue, symbolism, and scenery (if it were to be remade today, I can't possibly imagine all the car chases and fast-motion editing). The Grapes of Wrath also features a stellar ensemble of brilliant actors. This has to be one of Henry Fonda's greatest performances. As Tom, he is completely believable and memorable. One who is even more memorable is Jane Darwell as Ma (she's a marvel whenever she's on screen). The rest of the cast do very well here; I can't describe it, really.The Grapes of Wrath may not be in the same league as Citizen Kane and The Godfather, but it's still something to be much appreciated.

Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about. Published in 1939, the Grapes of Wrath is about the brutal and sad time people had to live... shall we say struggle through... and for the lucky some... survive during those days.The DVD version starts with Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda returning home from a seven year prison sentence, reduced to four for good behavior. He is on parole but tries to get back to his family and the first scenes where he gets bothered by the questions of the truck driver that gives him a lift is simply an excellent way to set the stage for the hardship about to unfold.When he gets home, he finds that no one is there, they have all abandoned the farm and he begins to understand what has happened because of a conversation with a man who refuses to leave his home.I learned that back then people entered into agricultural agreements where they did not own the land but were allowed by the owners to use the land in return for a share of the crop produced, and as times got really bad because of the lack of water, the ""dust"" storms and the inability to produce, they could no longer afford to pay the agreed share and were therefore, run from their land... even though they had worked it for over 70 years seeing many family generations come and go on the land which they called home...How incredibly sad... simply horrible... The story centers on a family with the last name of Joads and it is so hopeless at times that I felt the pain and sorrow of these characters daring to hope for a better life.Desperate times, children left without food and without care because parents earned miserable wages and had to go to find whatever work was available. Labor contracts were not respected, conditions were oppressive, and the spark of an attempt to correct the situation was seen as a crime and punished as such.The emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had. The road trip that takes them from their home in Oklahoma to California is at times exasperating because we suffer right along with these characters. The scenes at a road side diner where they buy bread... only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many. Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity. How can we live our lives in peace witnessing those who have so much and yet others not being able to eat? How do we ensure that our social systems protect our people from ever having to endure such harsh living conditions?

The Joads are just one family, and we certainly expect that each family moving from the south and Midwest to California would have their share of setbacks during the Depression era 1930s, but they embody much more than just a fight for a better life. The Joads' exodus westward is the hope for the American Dream personified; they have to fight not only the resistance to go back from their own family, but the various injustices and prejudiced opinions of those who don't want them in their part of the country. They leave many of their cherished possessions behind (we see this as Ma looks over her possessions one last time in the early part of the film), and they go west with a sense of both optimism and fear.One great aspect of John Ford's film is the role he filled for various characters. John Carradine does an excellent job as the preacher Jim Casy, from the beginning scene where he meets Tom Joad as they embark towards the Joad house, to him reflecting on the hypocrisy he feels towards preaching. While the film does not get into Casy's character at the depth the novel does (which was probably impossible due to the length of the book), Carradine does an excellent job of making Casy's character come to life visually from novel to film. Henry Ford in a superb choice for Tom Joad, and he is able to bring forth the rebellious nature to this character, as well as a change from beginning to end, from a man who wants to ""just get along"" to a man who wants to take up a fight for a people. Another fantastic choice was Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, exemplifying the role of keeping the family together at all costs. It is easy to see why she won an Oscar for her role.Another overlooked aspect is just the cinematography, the wonderful scenery and lighting. There is the scene at the beginning where we see Tom and Casy walking across the field, which seems to parallel and foreshadow their spiritual quest later on. There is the scene where Tom and Casy go into the desolate house, into complete darkness, and the eeriness of the scene is captured as they meet ""graveyard ghost"" Muley Graves, who refuses to leave his home. And then there is the final scene where no lighting is used when Ma and Tom meet for the last time while at the camps, appropriate and fitting for the moment. Ford does an excellent job of creating mood with various camera angles and lighting.Ford does an excellent job of bring Steinbeck's story of the Okies, the migrants of the Dust Bowl, to life.

The movie is more than 2 hours long and yet it's so good that you don't feel it as the Joad family makes its long journey cross country from Oklahoma to California looking for a way to survive from day to day.  The acting was superb and so was the directing but the only thing I didn't like was this DVD version.  The sound quality was average and despite the visual restoration, there were still many imperfections.  Perhaps a Blu-Ray version with better sound and visual quality will be soon released.

In these hard times when the WW2 covered the whole environment and the people went to movies to get fun , Ford showed this dark nightmare about the desillusion of a crowd of hopeless people literally exiled when they are ejected from their original lands and persuaded to live in California where best times are yet to come .This realist portrait ,  sober and  moderate adaptation of the novel of John Steinbeck presents a sinister chronology of misery so painful and bitter as any other one in the American cinema . The landscape is behind of all these afflictions of the Joad and Ford carries the dusty highways and the unlimited horizons of such intensity that the loaded truck appears as a Noah Ark which takes to one or two of each generation far from a desert beated by the wind . The darkness brings uncertainity and fear . But with this premise Ford will turn the destiny and will provide of optimist hope for the new and promised land .Without any doubt , this film is one of the merciless and powerful films which deals with such theme .Far from North America , the echoes of the new ideologies shocked the world ; the utopic projects inflamed the imagination of famous writers and Steinbeck was one of them , infected for those old fashioned moods . In the Eastern World Shostakovich and Boris Pasternak ; in Europe Bertold Brecht and Kurt Weill , and in America John Dos Passos and Sinclair Lewis who had shocked the literary world with his unforgettable work : Babbit .Those were hard days , and the shadows of the war foretold dark large threatening clouds.The Manhattan Project was in full development and Walt Disney handseled Fantasy.John Ford made a curious twist in his filmography ; specially when he had thrown The stagecoach , a mythical film about the emblematic mythology of the American cinema as the Western meant.

266471,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6301797906,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[5, 5]","Director John Ford has done a masterful job of bringing John Steinbeck's timeless novel to life in this movie.  Starring Henry Fonda, Ford's film brings the struggle of the 1930s migrant working family to life.Fonda stars as Tom Joad, a young man who's just been paroled from prision after serving four years for manslaughter.  Upon arriving home, he meets Casey (John Carradine), a former preacher turned drifter.  The two then head for the Joad homestead.  Once there, Tom discovers that his family is gone.  However, Muley Graves (John Qualen) has been hiding out in the Joad home.  After he is discovered by Tom, Muley tells of the numerous land corporations and banks who have been taking possession of the local farms.  Tom's father's farm has been repossessed, and the family has went to Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home.Tom and Casey head to uncle John's house, where they find the rest of the family, including Pa (Russell Simpson), Ma (Jane Darwell), Rose-of-Sharon (Dorris Bowden), her husband Connie Rivers (Eddie Quillan), and Grandma and Grandpa Joad.  The government agent comes to inform John that his land is being taken over, and the family packs their truck and begins the journey to California.Along the way, the family is faced with many different trials and tribulations, including the deaths of grandma and grandpa Joad as well as Connie deciding to leave.  They are forced to live in campgrounds designed specifically for refugee migrant workers, while Pa, Tom, and Uncle John try to find work.Eventually, the men find jobs as fruit pickers, but they barely make enough money to buy food.  There are run-ins with townspeople who don't want ""Okies"" stealing any more jobs.  All through these troubled times, Ma does her best to keep the family together.  Will the Joad family survive?This movie, like the novel, has become a classic.  The movie was nominated for numerous academy awards, and Jane Darwell won for best actress, while John Ford won for best director. The portrayal of life on the plains during the dustbowl years is done with great accuracy.  Numerous families lost their farms and land during this terrible time and headed west to find new lives, and their struggle is portrayed excellently by the Joad family.  The acting is excellent and the story is moving.  There are many acts of kindness during the film, such as the scene where the diner waitress agrees to sell the Joads a loaf of bread and then sells the young Joad children candy for a penny.

Indeed, had Franklin Delano Roosevelt not come to power, social revolution would have been a very real possibility during the 1920's.The reason this film is not as celebrated as, say, ""Citizen Kane"" or other of the AFI films is because it exposes poverty in America for what it is: as bad as anywhere else.  We see the Joad family, a family that could be ours' very easily with a few alterations in time and space, suffering unimaginably.Tom Joad, played flawlessly by Henry Fonda in a sort of Zen simplicity of growing realization, is the youngest man in the Joad clan.  Having served 4 years for murder (justified homicide), he returns to the home in California which no longer exists.  The suffering of his parents and two younger siblings is so grievous that he no longer thinks about drinking, dancing so much--his mind is on something much bigger.  The powers that be.Every frame of this film is smothered with misery, heat, and oppression.  Perhaps now more than ever we should understand Joad's character and remember his words at the end of the movie to his saintly mother: ""I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad.

266483,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301797906,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","For years ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered the best American film ever made. Now, according to the American Film Institute, it's #21. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck, the movie is directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda giving one of the best performances in the history of cinema. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is, in many ways, still the greatest American film in the sense that the film is about America, at a certain time and captures the feeling of The Great Depression better than most any other movie. Fonda plays Tom Joad, one of the most legendary characters of all time. After serving four years in prison for manslaughter, Tom is paroled and returns home to Oklahoma to see his family. On the way home, Tom encounters a former preacher named Casy (John Carradine) and the two travel to Tom's family's farm together. When they get there, they find out that Joad's family has been ""tractored off the land."" When Tom finds his family, they are packing up to head to California. Turns out there are some jobs for picking fruit, 800 people needed. So the Joad family sets off on the peril-laden trip to California, where they find that California might not be much better than what they left behind. Obviously, in my synopsis I've left many characters out including Ma Joad (Jane Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar) but I figure if you're reading this then you've likely seen the movie anyway. One of the key elements of the films' success is the cinematography, by the legendary Gregg Toland (cinematographer on ""Citizen Kane""). The film is in black & white, which has aged a lot better than color would have and features a lot of night scenes. In many scenes, characters are illuminated by a mere candle. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" has astonishingly not dated over the years; it's still as fresh and entertaining as I imagine it was upon its release. The film has legendary dialogue (the ""I'll be there"" speech) and a number of other things that make it so great. Saying a movie is a masterpiece is one thing, but getting people to see it is another. With people flocking to garbage like ""The Grudge 2"" and ""Stomp the Yard"" how many people actually see ""The Grapes of Wrath"" anymore? Not many, from my perspective.

Remington ""John Remington""","[14, 16]","I think it is most ironic that independent filmmakers claim to despise the mainstream Hollywood film in favor of making ""personal cinema"". When one considers the work of director John Ford it becomes so obvious that he was very much a part of the ""system"" and yet made several stunningly personal films.His films hold up well today because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting, searing and highly religious narrative.I agree with many other reviewers who believe that the film is largely leftist propaganda. Certainly the other great political film directors Leni Reifenstahl and Sergei Eisenstein can be see in many of Ford's compositions- as is the case with the masked tractor trooper montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another.The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life Magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionsim. There are so many frames that could stand proudly next to the works of Adams, Bourke-White, Wood and Robert Capa as examples of photographic art.The cast is uniformly excellent. The sincere and utterly real performances of John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from an Actor's Studio graduate.Enough cannot be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. How fitting that Fonda would play Henry Stamper in the film version of Kesey's SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION as Old Henry S. really is in many ways Tom Joad all grown up. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.The script retains much of the best of Steinbeck's novel and many of its great quotes. Yes, it does preach, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many ""serious"" filmmakers have yet to learn. The film has not dated in THE GRAPES OF WRATH is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense it transcends nationalism and is a fine work of World Literature. It is an equal with CITIZEN KANE as one of the finest films ever made.Now finally available on a beautiful transfer DVD, THE GRAPES OF WRATH, with his glowing silver and black images belongs on any serious film fan's shelf.",5,A classic of the human condition,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,2699,"['think', 'most', 'ironic', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'claim', 'despise', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'favor', 'making', 'personal', 'cinema', 'When', 'one', 'work', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'so', 'obvious', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'system', 'yet', 'made', 'several', 'stunningly', 'personal', 'films.His', 'films', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'display', 'personal', 'love', 'character', 'land', 'place', 'difference', 'time', 'honor', 'tradition', 'ritual', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'one', 'finest', 'pictures', 'obsessions', 'political', 'leanings', 'come', 'life', 'Steinbeck', 'haunting', 'searing', 'highly', 'religious', 'narrative.I', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'believe', 'film', 'largely', 'leftist', 'propaganda', 'Certainly', 'other', 'great', 'political', 'film', 'directors', 'Leni', 'Reifenstahl', 'Sergei', 'Eisenstein', 'can', 'be', 'see', 'many', 'Ford', 'compositions-', 'case', 'masked', 'tractor', 'trooper', 'montage', 'propaganda', 'very', 'medium', 'film', 'pure', 'emotion', 'film', 'loaded', 'one', 'emotional', 'image', 'another.The', 'photography', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'best', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'immediacy', 'realism', 'same', 'time', 'dramatically', 'recapturing', 'best', 'German', 'Expressionsim', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'frames', 'could', 'stand', 'proudly', 'next', 'works', 'Adams', 'Bourke-White', 'Wood', 'Robert', 'Capa', 'examples', 'photographic', 'art.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'sincere', 'utterly', 'real', 'performances', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Russell', 'Simpson', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'John', 'Qualen', 'great', 'Charley', 'Grapewin', 'give', 'performances', 'are', 'level', 'anything', 'ever', 'produced', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'graduate.Enough', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'possibly', 'said', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'How', 'fitting', 'Fonda', 'would', 'play', 'Henry', 'Stamper', 'film', 'version', 'Kesey', 'SOMETIMES', 'A', 'GREAT', 'NOTION', 'Old', 'Henry', 'S.', 'really', 'many', 'ways', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'grown', 'up', 'Simply', 'put', 'one', 'finest', 'characterizations', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'American', 'icon', 'was', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'artist.The', 'script', 'much', 'best', 'Steinbeck', 'novel', 'many', 'great', 'quotes', 'Yes', 'preach', 'never', 'expense', 'narrative', 'lesson', 'so', 'many', 'serious', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'yet', 'learn', 'film', 'not', 'dated', 'THE', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'specific', 'time', 'place', 'American', 'History', 'yes', 'also', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'sense', 'nationalism', 'fine', 'work', 'World', 'Literature', 'equal', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made.Now', 'finally', 'available', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'THE', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'glowing', 'silver', 'black', 'images', 'belongs', 'serious', 'film', 'fan', 'shelf']",N/A

The Joad's have decided to venture to California based on a flyer that promises a job for good pay in order to find a better way of life.  On the trip the family faces countless hardships, which seems to continue as they arrive in the the promise land of California.  Tom witnesses how his family and many others are being taken advantage of and how people are being considered &quot;good-for-nothing people&quot;.  Despite these adversities the Joads keep on struggling and hoping for something better to turn up.  Grapes of Wrath is based on John Steinbeck's novel with the same name which sends a powerful socioeconomic message about poverty, social injustice, and freedom where the dollar seems to guide all.  It also conveys a strong notion of hope, family, and determination, which can be the source of a better life.  The story's messages are equally important today as they were in 1940, and Ford does a brilliant job in depicting these issues on the silver screen.  Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film that leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that will resound throughout the viewers lives as they will face these issues repeatedly.",5,"Poverty, social injustice, and freedom in the focus...",1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,1311,"['four', 'year', 'stint', 'jail', 'self-defense', 'murder', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'Herny', 'Fonda', 'home', 'find', 'family', 'being', 'ousted', 'home', 'Joad', 'have', 'decided', 'venture', 'California', 'based', 'flyer', 'job', 'good', 'pay', 'order', 'find', 'better', 'way', 'life', 'trip', 'family', 'countless', 'hardships', 'continue', 'arrive', 'promise', 'land', 'California', 'Tom', 'how', 'family', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'considered', 'quot', 'good-for-nothing', 'people', 'quot', 'adversities', 'Joads', 'keep', 'struggling', 'hoping', 'something', 'better', 'turn', 'up', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'based', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'powerful', 'socioeconomic', 'message', 'poverty', 'social', 'injustice', 'freedom', 'where', 'dollar', 'guide', 'also', 'strong', 'notion', 'hope', 'family', 'determination', 'can', 'be', 'source', 'better', 'life', 'story', 'messages', 'are', 'equally', 'important', 'today', 'were', '1940', 'Ford', 'brilliant', 'job', 'depicting', 'issues', 'silver', 'screen', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'exceptional', 'film', 'audience', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'resound', 'viewers', 'will', 'face', 'issues', 'repeatedly']",N/A

266488,A2ICI500LRO01K,6301797906,Kyle Wells,"[19, 23]","This 1940 classic is a film that was remarkable for its time and still packs a punch today. It is a movie that contains a very complex political message within a very simple story of simple people. It takes a very basic story of a family moving to California during the depression and turns it into a powerful, enthralling and heartfelt film about people, politics and the way the world works. It is an excellent adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, which even Steinbeck himself declared to be a powerful thing on its own.The film centers around the main character of Tom Joad who is played brilliantly by Henry Fonda. Tom has just gotten out of prison only to find that his family and all of the other families in the area have been kicked off their farms by the banks. Most of these families decide to head to California in search of work that has been promised to them by pamphlets and brochures. Tom's family decides to do the same and the rest of the movie is about the hardships these people come across on the way to and in California. It is a well-known story that is loved by many people but the true core of the story is the political message within. It is a very leftist film and the message of the verge of communist or ""red"" but it was at the time a very real and much needed idealism. The message is mainly presented through the character of the Preacher or Casy but by the end it is Tom himself who is spreading the word of unions and fair work.The directing is fantastic and who would expect anything less from John Ford who is considered by most to be one of the, if not the greatest director from the days of old Hollywood. This is one of the films that proves this statement and is bested only by ""The Searchers"" in my opinion. The skill in which Ford frames his shots is incredible and quite unheard of for the time. He uses techniques and shooting styles that would have been more common in the Seventies up until now but here's John Ford using them in 1940. The lighting is one of the best parts of the film and Ford uses every available chance to use natural lighting usually at the hand of a candle or match and the results are astounding. The film has a feeling and a huge amount of style to it. It is truly a work of art.I think Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine put it best when he said, ""In the film, Joad butts heads with the behemoth of capitalism and realizes he can find redemption only through struggle. It really spells out the capitalist system's indifference to humanity. I'm shocked the movie even got made in the U.S."". I would agree with this statement and go even further to say that it was amazing that this film was not only made in the U.S. but in 1940. This is a time when the more ""red"" way of thinking was not as accepted as it has been for the last thirty years or so.Steinbeck's book is amazing and the movie is a powerful adaptation that is fit for any fan of great movies, particularly fans of films that have a social message to deliver.

266490,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301797906,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","I have absolutely no problem with the idea that the greatest ending in American literature comes on the final pages of John Steinbeck's novel ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  The symbolism of the final image of Rosasharn and the starving man is as potent as anything every found in an American novel, whether you are talking white whales or green-tinted glasses and silver slippers.  But there is no way on earth that a Hollywood film made in 1940 was going to film that scene and Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of Steinbeck's novel, which had only been published in 1939 when the censors were in apolexy over Clark Gable saying the word ""damn,"" has to come up with a suitable but obviously inadequate substitute.While Johnson remains remarkably faithful to the novel for most of the film, it is helpful to remember that a year earlier he had written the screenplay for ""Jesse James,"" and there is clearly a sense in which the Tom Joad of this film is a ""good"" outlaw in a similar sense.  The difference is that instead of joining the Confederacy this Tom Joad becomes a union man.  Tom (Henry Fonda) has just gotten out of prison and hitches a ride home in time to find that his family is being forced off of the Oklahoma farm that they have been sharecropping.  So the entire Joad family, Pa (Russell Simpson), Ma (Jane Darwell), Grandpa (Charley Grapewin), Rosasharn (Dorris Bowdon), and the rest pile into the family truck, joined by Casy (John Carradine in by far his finest role), a defrocked preacher who has a new, more human gospel to preach.  The truck heads for California, the family hoping that this is the Promised Land it is claimed to be in the handbills blowing across the Oklahoma landscape.Tom was in prison for killing a man who had stabbed him in a barroom brawl and at the end of this film he will kill again when he reaches a breaking point in the treatment that the migrant workers are enduring at the hands of the thugs wearing badges.  In the difference between those two murders is the transformation of Tom Joad from a brawler in to a fighter and more specifically a fighter with a cause.  Along the way is a journey that is as much a descent into Hell as the one Virgil took Dante on in ""The Inferno,"" with the horror being that this is taking place in America and (for the original film goers), in the present as well.  The Joads struggle to stay alive and stay together, and it seems that they are not going to be able to afford pride or dignity.The flaw in the film, if you are inclined to see it that way, is that Joad becomes a Christ-figure (with Casy forced into the John the Baptist role).  But pay attention to Tom's memorable closing speech to Ma Joan:  ""I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be there in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be there in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they built - I'll be there, too.""  Yes, Tom Joad is out there fighting for the little guy, but the problem is that since Tom Joad is out there, we do not have to be.  We wish him well and certainly root for him as he walks out to meet his destiny, but like Ma Joad we are going to stay behind and leave it to our hero to go fight the good fight.  The film's final line, which belongs to Ma Joad, sounds like something we would expect from a Capracorn movie.Director John Ford directs this black & white film with the same sense of human spectacle set against the grandeur of the American landscape that he displayed in his westerns ""Fort Apache"" and ""Rio Grande.""  Put this is the end of that grand Old West, where cattle barons and sodbusters have given way to giant, nameless companies who gobbled up the land even when the winds have turns it into a Dust Bowl.  The black & white cinematography by Gregg Toland provides a documentary like nature, recalling Dorothea Lange's famous 1936 photograph ""Migrant Mother.""Ford and Darwell won Oscars, but Alfred Hitchock's ""Rebecca"" and Jimmy Stewart in ""The Philadelphia Story"" won for Best Picture and Best Actor respectively.  Yet today it is clearly ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and Henry Fonda's performance that are a quintessential part of our American film heritage (Did you know that until 1958 it was ""The Grapes of Wrath"" that was considered the greatest American film and not ""Citizen Kane""?).  For a decidedly different but no less effective version of the story adapted by Frank Galati for the Steppenwolf Theater of Chicago check out the 1991 stage version with Gary Sinise as Tom Joad which ends as the novel does, with the mystical smile on the face of Rose of Sharon.",5,Henry Fonda in John Ford's version of John Steinbeck's novel,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,4819,"['have', 'absolutely',

Who can ever forget the Joad family, forced off their land during those difficult times?  Henry Fonda is cast as the older son, out on parole, but who chooses to travel to California with his family in search of jobs.  John Carradine is a former preacher who joins the family.  And Jane Darwell, cast as Ma Joad, won an academy award for her performance.  I read the book years ago and it will forever be seared in my memory.  And even though the film left out the most memorable scene of all, I was moved by the family's plight, as they joined the great migration to California in a rickety truck.The film has stood the time well if viewed as a history lesson.  It was a horrible time in America and it certainly is realistic in depicting the  times in general and the plight of the Okies in particular.  Some of the dialogue though, is a bit too preachy, and it's hard to believe that it would have come from a poor share-cropper's mouth.  The hardship was relentless and hard to watch and there was little opportunity for the characters to make choices.  However, this is just nit picking on my part.  On the whole, I feel it is a serious film well worth viewing, especially for those who find it difficult to understand what living through the Depression was like. Of course I recommend it.

What's ironic is that some people felt the movie was too extremist about the conditions - but research has shown that it actually was tame compared to situations that really went on.We begin with a family in Oklahoma who is literally kicked out of their home, with nowhere to go. Flyers are being passed around about a ton of work being available in California. So they pile their entire household of goods and head out. Unfortunately, so does pretty much every starving person - and California is innundated with workers. The Okies are treated poorly, given dirt poor wages and run out of town.It's amazing that the books are banned in schools - especially in the midwest!

I know The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most iconic, beloved historical landmarks in the art of filmmaking and it has some good things going for it, technically speaking. Some of the shots look REALLY good, especially the desert and farmland scenes. Henry Fonda plays sincere and honest very well and does a great job with his facial expressions especially during his farewell speech towards the end of the film. And I'll agree that Jane Darwell deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as the world-weary mother although it was a very tough call because of Judith Anderson's terrific performance as the evil housekeeper in Rebecca.But the movie in itself is a very dry, stale experience. Don't get me wrong. I don't need every movie to have a happy ending--take a look at some of the films I've given five stars. (A Place in the Sun, Citizen Kane and Judgment at Nuremburg) A tragedy with REDEEMING VALUES or a moral lesson can CERTAINTLY be good. I do not necessarily have to identify, sympathize with or care about the main character but I must find something intriguing, engaging or thought-provoking about the story that is presented. The Joad's story on the other hand was just miserable to watch. I guess it's just what repulsed me about this movie is that it kept pilling the misery on and on and on. It was so draining to see these miserable beggars leading such empty, meaningless lives. The grandparents die, the son in law leaves his pregnant wife and the son gets in trouble for hitting a policeman during the arrest when it was his own fault for breaking the curfew law. He finally leaves the family as not to burden them with a marked man, they pack up and leave and WHAT? THAT'S IT??? It had no ending! Did the family ever find a permanent settlement and job? Did Rosa Sharon ever give birth to her child? Was it a boy or girl? Where was Tom Joad going? Did he ever find another job? Did he ever see his family again? Why the cliffhanger ending? Was John Ford planning to make a sequel?The pacing is so slow and morbid and there is little or no background music which would have helped enhance the tone of some of the scenes. Plus some of the supporting performances are very over the top and irritating--my goodness the beginning scenes with the senile grandparents were just painful to watch especially when they're having dinner at home for the last time. The defrocked preacher has this permanent gaping mouth and lidless, glazed eyes like he's in a trance. Seriously, giving up on Christianity does not mean acting like a lunatic.The mother's socialist fueled final speech against the 'rich and worthless' felt tacked on at the end like an afterthought. I mean, I have no problem with a movie promoting a certain ideology I disagree with if it is presented in an intelligent, careful, sensitive manner woven throughout but this just felt so blatant and 'in your face.'Thumbs down.

Turn it into a movie and let John Ford direct it, and get Henry Fonda to star.  In 1940 you could hardly find a more certain recipe for a cinema classic.As good as the film is, it really should be a companion-piece to Steinbeck's original masterpiece, and if you haven't read it I recommend setting aside enough time to read one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written.That being said, the medium of the cinema allows for a visual impact that can't be matched with the written word.The Grapes of Wrath follows the Joad family during the great depression.  That period of economic hardship hit the farmers in Oklahoma a little harder than the rest of the world, at the time of the dust bowl the &quot;Okies&quot; were at the end of their ropes, financially speaking.Thousands of Okies packed up the house after being foreclosed and moved out to California - many winding up around Bakersfield, at the California end of old US Route 66. (Merle Haggard's family did so and the &quot;Okie from Muscogee&quot; wrote about it in songs like &quot;California Cottonfields&quot;.)Anyway, this is the historical context of the movie.  The theme of the movie, and of Steinbeck's book, is the ability of the human spirit to remain intact in these worst of times.  The Joads suffer terrible humiliations, one after another, most of them because of their desperate financial status.  But as the story proceeds we see that they are fundamentally decent, hard-working people, and every time life knocks them down they get back up, brush the dirt off themselves, and keep moving forward.

When I first saw the movie, years ago, I thought it was a decent adaptation of an American literary classic.Since then, my critical thinking skills have improved a lot--now I recognize this as a thinly-veiled propagandist piece that pits luckless Okies against dastardly Agribusiness predators. Very simplistic and heavy-handed--unbelievably so.It's hard to believe that John Ford, who directed THE SEARCHERS (probably the greatest American film ever made), was also responsible for this.The acting was good, though how can it not be with this cast? And there were moments of humor and poignancy.But Tom Joad, heroic Everyman? Not. From the very first scene, we learn that he is recently paroled from prison (homicide); he hitches a ride on a truck, forcing the driver to break his company's rules against giving lifts. Right away, you know this guy is a rule-breaker and pretty much does whatever he feels like.So if Joad can go through life like that, why can't these big orchard owners? The only thing that separates Joad from his persecuters is that they made sound business decisions and he did not.Also, the whole forced Dustbowl-westward migration was horrible (read THE WORST HARD TIME if you're interested in this chapter of our history), but Joad et al are stunned to be kicked off ""their"" land....and they're all SHARECROPPERS!! They don't OWN the land, but it's LIKE they own the land, because they've lived on it for so long, so they're outraged when the people who DO own the land tell them to move. (Can you say, ""squatter""?)Hmm....maybe the actual landowners were ALSO affected by the Depression and had to make some tough decisions.GRAPES OF WRATH--the movie and the book--have become the go-to sources for all things Depression.

266505,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6301797906,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Although The Grapes of Wrath is certainly not the longest picture I've ever seen, the exceptionally fine acting combined with its emotional impact and careful attention to detail gives the film a truly epic quality. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen--at the very end there was a lump in my throat; I was extremely moved and I won't forget this film anytime soon! The script could not have been better; the cinematography shines and the choreography is superb. The plot moves along nicely and covers quite a bit of action despite the fact that things never seem rushed. Of course, the film can't quite match all the detail of John Steinbeck's 450+ page book; but the way the filmmakers did this, including director John Ford, it is profoundly memorable.When the picture begins, we quickly meet Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), who returns to his Oklahoma home after spending four years in prison; and it is through Tom's eyes that we see the shock people felt during the Great Depression when they were driven off the Midwestern land they had harvested for decades. On the one hand, Tom reunites with Casy, a family friend who is now a disillusioned former preacher; but on the other hand the closer he and Casy get to the Joad house the more a nasty, ominous dust storm begins to blow up and when they discover an empty house the not-so-happy tone is set for the rest of the picture. Indeed, their once cherished home is merely a hide-out for a disheveled friend named Muley (John Qualen) who tells Tom that the Joads and other families have been driven off the land by big banks. Sharecropping, the only thing they know how to do to make a living, is no longer profitable. Muley then tells Tom and Casy that Tom's family is at their Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home; and Tom, again with Casy, arrives there for a family reunion. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell in an Oscar winning performance) is thankful that Tom reached them before they left Oklahoma; the family intends to move to California. In California, they believe, there will be good paying jobs picking crops and they want Tom and Casy to come with them.Of course, many things happen to the Joad family and Casy as the plot progresses; and I won't write too much about this in order not to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that the movie was brilliantly executed and the attention to detail remains extremely impressive, to say the least. The plot and the action are extremely realistic as well.The DVD comes with terrific bonus features. On one side of the DVD disc there is a commentary by film scholar Joseph McBride and Susan Shillinglaw (a John Steinbeck scholar). There is also a prologue that was shown to British audiences so that they would have a basic understanding of the issues in this film before they viewed it. On the other side of the DVD disc, we get a featurette biography of Darryl F. Zanuck, a restoration comparison--and even more!The Grapes of Wrath is so well done and packs such a punch that it should be required viewing for anybody when they're old enough to understand the issues explored and depicted in this film. The film accurately depicts the harsh severities of life for so many people at that time in our country's history; and that's for the best. It's educational, too! I highly recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie; and anyone who appreciates quality, classic motion pictures will not be disappointed.",5,"gritty, powerful and poignant",1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,3420,"['Grapes', 'Wrath', 'certainly', 'not', 'longest', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'acting', 'combined', 'emotional', 'impact', 'careful', 'attention', 'detail', 'film', 'truly', 'epic', 'quality', 'acting', 'easily', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'lump', 'throat', 'was', 'extremely', 'moved', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'film', 'anytime', 'soon', 'script', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cinematography', 'shines', 'choreography', 'superb', 'plot', 'moves', 'nicely', 'quite', 'bit', 'action', 'fact', 'things', 'never', 'seem', 'rushed', 'course', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'detail', 'John', 'Steinbeck', '450+', 'page', 'book', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'including', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'profoundly', 'memorable.When', 'picture', 'quickly', 'meet', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'who', 'Oklahoma', 'home', 'spending', 'four', 'years', 'prison', 'Tom', 'eyes', 'see', 'shock', 'people', 'felt', 'Great', 'Depression', 'when', 'were', 'driven', 'off', 'Midwestern', 'land', 'had', 'harvested', 'decades', 'one', 'hand', 'Tom', 'Casy', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'now', 'disillusioned', 'former', 'preacher', 'other', 'hand', 'closer', 'Casy', 'get', 'Joad', 'house', 'more', 'nasty', 'ominous', 'dust', 'storm', 'blow', 'up', 'when', 'discover', 'empty', 'house', 'not-so-happy', 'tone', 'set', 'rest', 'picture', 'Indeed', 'once', 'cherished', 'home', 'merely', 'hide-out', 'disheveled', 'friend', 'named', 'Muley', 'John', 'Qualen', 'who', 'Tom', 'Joads', 'other', 'families', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'off', 'land', 'big', 'banks', 'Sharecropping', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'living', 'no', 'longer', 'profitable', 'Muley', 'then', 'Tom', 'Casy', 'Tom', 'family', 'Uncle', 'John', 'Frank', 'Darien', 'home', 'Tom', 'again', 'Casy', 'family', 'reunion', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'thankful', 'Tom', 'reached', 'left', 'Oklahoma', 'family', 'move', 'California', 'California', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'paying', 'jobs', 'picking', 'crops', 'want', 'Tom', 'Casy', 'come', 'them.Of', 'course', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'Joad', 'family', 'Casy', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'too', 'much', 'order', 'not', 'spoil', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'attention', 'detail', 'remains', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'say', 'least', 'plot', 'action', 'are', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'terrific', 'bonus', 'features', 'one', 'side', 'DVD', 'disc', 'commentary', 'film', 'scholar', 'Joseph', 'McBride', 'Susan', 'Shillinglaw', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'scholar', 'also', 'prologue', 'was', 'shown', 'British', 'audiences', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'basic', 'understanding', 'issues', 'film', 'viewed', 'other', 'side', 'DVD', 'disc', 'get', 'featurette', 'biography', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'even', 'more', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'packs', 'such', 'punch', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'anybody', 'when', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'issues', 'explored', 'depicted', 'film', 'film', 'accurately', 'harsh', 'severities', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'time', 'country', 'history', 'best', 'educational', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'classic', 'motion', 'pictures', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

266510,AN8M401S8Y6DA,6301797906,Mike Liddell,"[4, 6]","To quote the amazon.com editorial review, ""Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality"".Now in 2007 it drops to 23rd place on AFIs list and a point i find that people don't bring up is the welfare system and how in that respect it is more important today than ever in showing why and for who a welfare system is in place for and how terribly flawed and manipulated it is today.I know this movie is a classic and won oscars and was directed by one of the great directors John Ford.  Most know the story, or had to read it in high school, and it makes most best lists.  It is a history lesson and teaches unionization, and it is all these things.The thing that stuck with me the most was the end and what a safe haven the agricultural farm put in place by the government was for the Joads.  It safed there lives.  There were dances and they could eat and help pay there way by helping in the camp.  However the Joads did not want a hand out and even though if work came after all they had been through, starvation, losing family members, treated like pigs, they deserved the right to stay in that safe camp, nobody would criticize them for not jumping at the first job that came along that might turn out to be another nothing.As soon as 20 days of work came up they packed everything they owned into that car that might not even make their destination and they left the government camp, and happily.  All they wanted to do was work and they basically were taken advantage of and walked on and not allowed to do the one thing they wanted.In 2007 we have totally healthy and able bodied people in there early twenties collecting social security, or waiting for the end of the month for the welfare check to come in.  Perhaps have more and more children because that check at the end of the month will be fatter.  I knew a kid when i was in the national guard that unknowingly to the government stayed with his girlfriend on welfare rent free while he worked, he actually said he loved the ghetto and he d stay there forever.  I actually liked him barring the last ignorant statement but he was young and i'm guessing didn't have the best influences to think like that.  The Joads didn't have money to eat but you can bet most now a day that are able bodied and can work and choose not to will get there cigarettes.  Say you get involved with drugs mess yourself up and you can't work well then you can get disability.So with everything this movie is, in this day and age that is the message that rang loudest to me.  I also realize there are many like the Joads today that fall upon hard times and a government assisted program is a safe haven to them also, and i am not judging all, but talking about the one's that are manipulating and taking advantage.Perhaps before you are allowed to go on housing or welfare maybe it should be mandatory to watch The Grapes of Wrath and the Joads struggle.",5,"The government supplied farm and the Joads struggle shows who a welfare system is in place for, and how manipulated it is today.",1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,2998,"['quote', 'amazon.com', 'editorial', 'review', 'Ranking', 'No', '21', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'list', '100', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', '1940', 'classic', 'bit', 'dated', 'noble', 'sentimentality', '.Now', '2007', '23rd', 'place', 'AFIs', 'list', 'point', 'i', 'find', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'welfare', 'system', 'how', 'respect', 'more', 'important', 'today', 'ever', 'showing', 'why', 'who', 'welfare', 'system', 'place', 'how', 'terribly', 'flawed', 'manipulated', 'today.I', 'know', 'movie', 'classic', 'won', 'oscars', 'was', 'directed', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'John', 'Ford', 'Most', 'know', 'story', 'had', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'best', 'lists', 'history', 'lesson', 'teaches', 'unionization', 'things.The', 'thing', 'stuck', 'most', 'was', 'end', 'what', 'safe', 'haven', 'agricultural', 'farm', 'put', 'place', 'government', 'was', 'Joads', 'safed', 'were', 'dances', 'could', 'eat', 'help', 'pay', 'way', 'helping', 'camp', 'However', 'Joads', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'hand', 'out', 'even', 'work', 'came', 'had', 'been', 'starvation', 'losing', 'family', 'members', 'treated', 'pigs', 'deserved', 'right', 'stay', 'safe', 'camp', 'nobody', 'would', 'criticize', 'not', 'jumping', 'first', 'job', 'came', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'nothing.As', 'soon', '20', 'days', 'work', 'came', 'up', 'packed', 'everything', 'owned', 'car', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'destination', 'left', 'government', 'camp', 'happily', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'work', 'basically', 'were', 'taken', 'advantage', 'walked', 'not', 'allowed', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'wanted.In', '2007', 'have', 'totally', 'healthy', 'able', 'bodied', 'people', 'early', 'twenties', 'collecting', 'social', 'security', 'waiting', 'end', 'month', 'welfare', 'check', 'come', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'more', 'more', 'children', 'check', 'end', 'month', 'will', 'be', 'fatter', 'knew', 'kid', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'national', 'guard', 'unknowingly', 'government', 'stayed', 'girlfriend', 'welfare', 'rent', 'free', 'worked', 'actually', 'said', 'loved', 'ghetto', 'stay', 'there', 'forever', 'actually', 'liked', 'barring', 'last', 'ignorant', 'statement', 'was', 'young', 'i', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'influences', 'think', 'Joads', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'eat', 'can', 'bet', 'most', 'now', 'day', 'are', 'able', 'bodied', 'can', 'work', 'choose', 'not', 'will', 'get', 'there', 'cigarettes', 'Say', 'get', 'involved', 'drugs', 'mess', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'then', 'can', 'get', 'disability.So', 'everything', 'movie', 'day', 'age', 'message', 'loudest', 'also', 'realize', 'are', 'many', 'Joads', 'today', 'fall', 'upon', 'hard', 'times', 'government', 'assisted', 'program', 'safe', 'haven', 'also', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'judging', 'talking', 'one', 'are', 'manipulating', 'taking', 'advantage.Perhaps', 'are', 'allowed', 'go', 'housing', 'welfare', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'watch', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'Joads', 'struggle']",N/A

Ford has taken the Pulitzer Prize novel by John Steinbeck and with a brilliant screenplay by Nunnally Johnson, captured the utter despair and hopeless situations and barriers erected against the Joad family.After losing their farm in Oklahoma during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the movie details their misery as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities. Ford has always been a master of geographic realism, and his powerful shots of the dust storms, the  rickety truck that carries the Joads west and the intense acting scenes played against vivid backdrop sceneryare gripping.The Grapes of Wrath has long been recognized as a great film, perhaps the best, that illustrates the Depression and the despair experienced by so many Americans.

266516,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6301797906,Nix Pix,"[23, 33]","""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an inspired, harsh and critical retake on the Great Depression and its human fall out. While other studios were producing ultra high glamour and star driven vehicles, Darryl F. Zanuck chose to turn his spotlight on the crisis of the country and came up with an all time box office winner. It stars Henry Fonda as the forgotten man of conscience who is forced to leave his homestead in search of a hopefully better life that, sadly, is not to be. Jane Darwell is brilliant as Ma Joad, the defiant, resilient and compelling matriarch who keeps the family together through these tough times. Dark was the world of the 1930s in reality, but never was it more magically brought to life than in this inspirational film of hope, courage and the dream of prosperity that must have seemed so far out of reach at the time of the film's general release.TRANSFER: Previous versions of this film have looked as though they were caught in their own dust bowl. This DVD managed to recapture much of the lost visual style absent in earlier versions. Greg Tolland's evocative camera work is magnificently captured. Black levels are deep. The gray scale, for the most part is well balanced and captures the stark harshness of the original presentation. There are a host of age related artifacts present throughout but these have at least been tempered and do not terribly distract. There is some shimmering of fine details and more than a hint of pixelization in this transfer. Nevertheless, the image quality is an improvement over previous incarnations. Somehow it almost seems to add to the vintage of subject matter of this film. The audio is remixed to 5.1 but really - this is a mono film with very little spread or reason for it across your other channels.EXTRAS: A biography on Darryl F. Zanuck, audio commentaries, restoration comparison and theatrical trailer.

The movie has three major components that make it an excellent film, a story based on the classic novel by John Steinbeck, the magnificent cinematography, and the historical significance in terms of American history.  The film undoubtedly defines the unending relevance of the American dream and manifest destiny, and John Ford depicts those themes with the Joad family's cross-country trek from Oklahoma to California seeking better opportunities further west after losing their land.John Ford shows how far the American Dream has come.  The film is a reflection of the workingman and American society during the Great Depression as well of the results of the New Deal - the revitalization of the American landscape.  However, the film is about one family and their perseverance to survive in an ever-changing society, but always keeping the past in mind.  Ford shows the Joad's unfortunate circumstance from a family who owned their own land to a nomadic family who became migrant workers; their story represents more than a thousand families' experiences.The film has its defining moments.  In one of the scenes mother Joad (Jane Darwell) is preparing to leave her homestead in Oklahoma and discards a few mementos she has collected over the years from a newspaper article and a postcard depicting the Statue of Liberty, but she happens to keep what looks like a porcelain dog that commemorates the St. Louis Expo of 1904.  Another defining moment is the last few minutes of the film.  It is one of the most legendary and empowering scenes in American film history, which shows Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) making his most moving soliloquy.THE GRAPES OF WRATH will tug at the heartstrings.  Although some may refer the film as out-dated, the story is a part of American history, and it brings an understanding and realization of the hardships that those who owned and lived on farms from the Midwest and dust bowl states experienced during the late 1920s and 1930s in order to continue to live the American dream.

They are thrown out off their family land in the Dust Bowl and forced to move west, seeking mythical work as fruit pickers promised by some well-circulated handbills. Along the way, they deal with death, sickness, poverty, cruelty, oppression by the wealthy and jackal-like need by their fellow impoverished. It's not a happy story, and really, no one would expect it to be. The lead is played quietly but effectively by Henry Fonda, always very good as the somewhat yokel-ized, simple and silent everyman (as opposed to his friend Jimmy Stewart's monopoly on the clumsy but smart average guy). His performance is overshadowed, though, by Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, and John Carradine (yes, that John Carradine) as former preacher Casey. These are also quiet, strong performances, and it's in these performances that the real strength of the story comes out. You can relate to these people, to their hardship, and to their various reactions.Unfortunately, the film has a significant pacing issue that gets worse with every passing scenario. When the film starts, we get a good ten minutes of pure dialogue - no doubt lifted straight from Steinbeck - between Tom and Casey. This is riveting film because the characters are coming to life before our eyes. The same trick is repeated later, in other sequences that take their time: Ma Joad going through old possessions before the move, Pa Joad and the youngest kids trying to buy bread in a diner, and the climactic speech by Tom. As a director, Ford really seems to want to take his time with the material, and I wouldn't be too surprised if he'd originally wanted a four-hour film. As it is, though, we get a film of just 129 minutes (still at the long end, for the time), and for each of those remarkable sequences there's two or three that fly by so fast they don't have time to make an impact. In fact, a fairly pivotal point - that they lose more and more family members with each stop - is glossed over because there's not enough time to see every departure. You just hear the decreasing number, and the family drives on. Other scenes that should have been important, like the shocking death of one character, seem thrown away as transitions between bigger scenes. By the end of the film, it starts to feel so episodic that the ending just pops out of nowhere.The ending is a problem, too. The book's original ending - exceedingly bleak, and a bit scandalous - would have been far too controversial for a film in 1940. (Although, ironically, the silent era would probably have done just fine with it.) Instead, we get an ""inspiring"" speech from Ma about how the Joads will just keep going and going, representing the ""common people"" - stirring sentiment, yeah, but it doesn't make any sense. The Joads have been torn apart as a family unit, and the idea that their ship is going to suddenly come in just over the next rise is laughably silly, and a betrayal of these characters. The whole point is that they, most likely, won't survive, and they'll be left as one more sacrifice on the road to progress. It's the same sort of goofy speech, patriotic or nearly so, that heralded the end of so many '40s-era B pictures. It's okay in that sort of context, because the material has an inherent cheesiness and, often enough, a propoganda message; ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is neither cheesy nor particularly complimentary toward the government. You can tell a producer forced this decision.I haven't mentioned John Ford much in this review because he is, to me, almost an ""invisible"" director. His guiding hand is there - you can see it in the pacing, in the lingering close-ups on faces and long-shots of the truck moving slowly down the road, but he eschews the visual tricks of many other filmmakers of the time. In fact, the entire visual feel of the film is largely down to award-winning cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful photography (perhaps better remembered for ""Citizen Kane,"" the following year). No, the main way to tell a Ford movie is by this quiet, studious pace, and the use of a certain ""company"" of actors; many of those seen here, and especially Henry Fonda and John Carradine, would be seen again (or had been seen) in other Ford pictures. That's not a problem for me. The ""invisible"" touch is just as valid as the showier approach, and there's certainly no denying Ford was a talented man. I do feel, however, that this is not one of his more successful films - possibly, as I've suggested, because he might not have had as much control over the end product as he liked. It's still worth seeing, and it's still a good movie, but there are many other films - Ford films, even - that I would put above it.",3,A little too studio-mandated to be truly great,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,4799,"['story', 'Joad', 'family', 'more', 'anyone', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'simple', 'realistic', 'pretty', 'heartwrenching', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'family', 'land', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'forced', 'move', 'west', 'seeking', 'mythical', 'work', 'fruit', 'pickers', 'promised', 'well-circulated', 'handbills', 'way', 'deal', 'death', 'sickness', 'poverty', 'cruelty', 'oppression', 'wealthy', 'jackal-like', 'need', 'fellow', 'impoverished', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'really', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'lead', 'played', 'quietly', 'effectively', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'somewhat', 'yokel-ized', 'simple', 'silent', 'everyman', 'opposed', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'monopoly', 'clumsy', 'smart', 'average', 'guy', 'performance', 'overshadowed', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'John', 'Carradine', 'yes', 'John', 'Carradine', 'former', 'preacher', 'Casey', 'are', 'also', 'quiet', 'strong', 'performances', 'performances', 'real', 'strength', 'story', 'out', 'can', 'relate', 'people', 'hardship', 'various', 'reactions.Unfortunately', 'film', 'significant', 'pacing', 'issue', 'worse', 'passing', 'scenario', 'When', 'film', 'get', 'good', 'ten', 'minutes', 'pure', 'dialogue', 'doubt', 'lifted', 'straight', 'Steinbeck', 'Tom', 'Casey', 'riveting', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'coming', 'life', 'eyes', 'same', 'trick', 'repeated', 'later', 'other', 'sequences', 'take', 'time', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'going', 'old', 'possessions', 'move', 'Pa', 'Joad', 'youngest', 'kids', 'trying', 'buy', 'bread', 'diner', 'climactic', 'speech', 'Tom', 'director', 'Ford', 'really', 'want', 'take', 'time', 'material', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprised', ""'d"", 'originally', 'wanted', 'four-hour', 'film', 'though', 'get', 'film', 'just', '129', 'minutes', 'still', 'long', 'end', 'time', 'remarkable', 'sequences', 'two', 'three', 'fly', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'make', 'impact', 'fact', 'fairly', 'pivotal', 'point', 'lose', 'more', 'more', 'family', 'members', 'stop', 'glossed', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'see', 'departure', 'just', 'hear', 'decreasing', 'number', 'family', 'Other', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'important', 'shocking', 'death', 'one', 'character', 'seem', 'thrown', 'away', 'transitions', 'bigger', 'scenes', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'so', 'episodic', 'ending', 'just', 'pops', 'nowhere.The', 'ending', 'problem', 'too', 'book', 'original', 'ending', 'exceedingly', 'bleak', 'bit', 'scandalous', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'controversial', 'film', '1940', 'ironically', 'silent', 'era', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'fine', 'Instead', 'get', 'inspiring', 'speech', 'Ma', 'how', 'Joads', 'will', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'going', 'representing', 'common', 'people', 'stirring', 'sentiment', 'yeah', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Joads', 'have', 'been', 'torn', 'apart', 'family', 'unit', 'idea', 'ship', 'going', 'suddenly', 'come', 'just', 'next', 'rise', 'laughably', 'silly', 'betrayal', 'characters', 'whole', 'point', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'survive', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'one', 'more', 'sacrifice', 'road', 'progress', 'same', 'sort', 'goofy', 'speech', 'patriotic', 'nearly', 'so', 'heralded', 'end', 'so', 'many', ""'40s-era"", 'B', 'pictures', 'okay', 'sort', 'context', 'material', 'inherent', 'cheesiness', 'often', 'enough', 'propoganda', 'message', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'cheesy', 'particularly', 'complimentary', 'government', 'can', 'tell', 'producer', 'forced', 'decision.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'John', 'Ford', 'much', 'review', 'almost', 'invisible', 'director', 'guiding', 'hand', 'can', 'see', 'pacing', 'lingering', 'close-ups', 'long-shots', 'truck', 'moving', 'slowly', 'road', 'visual', 'tricks', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'fact', 'entire', 'visual', 'feel', 'film', 'largely', 'down', 'award-winning', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'perhaps', 'better', 'remembered', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'following', 'year', 'No', 'main', 'way', 'tell', 'Ford', 'movie', 'quiet', 'studious', 'pace', 'use', 'certain', 'company', 'actors', 'many', 'seen', 'here', 'especially', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'John', 'Carradine', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'Ford', 'not', 'problem', 'invisible', 'touch', 'just', 'as', 'valid', 'showier', 'approach', 'certainly', 'denying', 'Ford', 'was', 'talented', 'man', 'do', 'feel', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'films', 'possibly', ""'ve"", 'suggested', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'control', 'end', 'product', 'liked', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Ford', 'films', 'even', 'would', 'put']",N/A

But when he got home, he found a deserted homestead and a foul wind blowing out there!He meets Casey, a former preacher who seems to be waiting for something.  Tom meets others who have been cast out thanks to big farmer business and the major ecological disaster  known as the Dust Bowl, where a major drought throughout the mid-west wiped out half the agricultural input of the USA!Tom hooks up with his family and they head out towards California for the hope of getting a job.  They get a bill that says there are jobs out West.  Well guess what?  Becoming a displaced person means being taken advantage of.The film has several themes:  women adapt to these despairing times; the men take other roles.  The ""Okies"" are taken advantage of -- you want this job?  2.5 cents for each basket of peaches picked.  You don't like it?  See ya!The prejudice against them was horrific.  The big farmers using them practically as slave labor, the tough work bosses and prejudice.  The old folks who did not want to leave Oklahoma either became ghosts and bums or died out.Henry Fonda is amazing as the quiet, strong young man who sees the corruption and wants to do something about it.  Casey (John Carridine) acts as his ""lantern"" (as Tom puts it), searching for rights for these farm workers.What's really interesting on this DVD are the features.  This particular DVD you have to flip it to the special features.A prologue briefly explaining the background history of the Dust Bowl tragedy in the USA at that time.  The Fox MovieNotes newsreels that discuss the Midwest farmers drought.  And some of the actors getting their Oscars!The commentary by a film historian and a Steinbeck scholar were somewhat interesting, although their monotone chant and twenty-dollar words turned me off.  Still, I learned a lot about Steinbeck actually liking this film and how the American Farmer Association at the time wanted to boycott theaters that played this film.When the light of truth shines on these guys, even in a dramatized form, they can't stand it, obviously.The struggle of the migrant farmworker is not limited to the Mexican workers.  The white farmer of the Oklahoma/Arkansas area also met with resistance, suppression and violent, depressing conditions and starvation.John Ford's use of cinematic lighting (the candle) and special effects (the superimposed harvest machine blades, the black & white grainy looks) was amazing.  The film producers' creation of mood and depression was simply awesome and it seems Hollywood today has lost much of this cinematic art of the film!Now to read the book!

To those who know something about John Steinbeck's novel, it is enough to say that the picture is way ahead of anything even the most hopeful had reason to expect.  It is all beautifully direct and literal, like clear-cut themes in a symphony.  There is Tom Joad, on parole from prison, going back to his family on their farm.  The shell of a farmhouse, deserted, the family blown out by dust-storms and tractor-farming.  The family, found again, setting out westward in their junky old truck, for work and a place to settle on the soil once more.  The long trek west, over the endless inter-state highways, joing the miserable stream of other families driven away from their own birthright and seeking a promised land of home and work again.  Nunnally Johnson, who wrote the screenplay, had to do something more with Steinbeck's book than cut pages out of it and paste them together.  He had to dramatise it, which meant concentrating its essence while he built it to mounting emotion and action.  If Johnson's script narrows the gist of the story to only what happens to the Joad family, director John Ford had spread it wide again, in the way that only a movie can do.  The chief thing about the acting is that it almost never seems to be acting at all.  Perhaps John Carradine and Grant Mitchell give an occasional impression of doing their stuff, but the rest, from the most casual extra to the stars, might have been caught in some episode of actual life.  Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are the most important because they embody the main spirit of the drama: they both fill their parts with such life, that they are peerless in their playing.  There is, too Ford's fondness for mist and shadows and music-but all in their place here, integral and rarely mannered.

Then I read the book and was completely absorbed and deeply affected by it.  Although the film makes a bold attempt to convey how tough life was for the Dust Bowl Okies during the Great Depression -- Ultimately this picture is sugarcoated compared to the novel.  The book is darker and grittier than the film.  At the end of the picture, things are looking up for the Joad clan -- The family chats hopefully as they drive along in their jalopy towards the work that awaits them.  Whereas at the end of the novel -- The Joad family's chances for survival are looking grim and their future is questionable -- Although a sliver of hope resonates within Steinbeck's poignant final image.This film samples highlights from the book effectively enough to keep the momentum going -- And the performances by Jane Darwell, Henry Fonda and John Carradine make up for whatever had to be left out of the script.  Matriarch Ma Joad is the role that Darwell was born to play -- She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1941 for her portrayal.  Best Actor Oscar-nominee Fonda finds a good balance between tough and compassionate in his portrayal of Tom Joad.  John Carradine is memorable as Casy the ill-fated preacher.  It is also noteworthy that John Ford won a Best Director Oscar in 1941 for ""The Grapes of Wrath"".  Yet another highlight of the film is Gregg Toland's top-notch cinematography -- That I had taken for granted during previous viewings of this picture.

It's re-release by Fox is timely as much of the US is still in a recession and unemployment is high. There are many folks re-locating from their homes (if they haven't been evicted already) looking for work. If you want to know more about the film and its plot, there are over 160 reviews here that will provide that info. So I'll concentrate on the BD release, it's special features and not on the film itself.TGOW was filmed in black and white in a standard format of 1.33:1 so no matter what screen aspect your TV has the image will be virtually square. Even on an older non-flat screen TV the image does not fill the screen but has thick black border on all sides. Direct John  Ford used dark images (and lots of great shadows) to tell the story and , though the BD image is brighter than previous releases, it show the graininess of the film. I also noted in the early scenes that the brightness would waiver, but I got used to it as I concentrated on the story.The BD has, as special features, a commentary track (same as on previous DVD release) that I did not listen to, a series of short Fox Movietone newsreels about the dust bowl and the Academy Award presentation to actress Jane Darwell (who won the award for Best Actress but is not even given recognition by name on the package despite a fabulous performance) totally about 8-minutes. There is also a 25-minute piece from the Fox Legacy TV show (on Fox of course) with Tom Rothman. I tried to get into it but Rothman is - frankly - not a good speaker and I found a bit too pompous for my tastes. Despite playing with the Display Aspect control on my BD player, I found that the excerpts from the film that were included in Rothman's piece, were out of ""ratio"" and the image was ""squished"". I'm not sure how this plays on other TVs. The BD also gives you the option of watching the film with the ""forward"" included in the British release, which the producers decided was necessary to explain the economic conditions in the US to the British theater audience. A nice touch for completeness. The last bonus is an A&E; episode on Producer Daryl F. Zanuck (that I haven't gotten to yet.).Having read a few other reviews of the DVD version here, it appears that the DVD version has a sharper image than the BD, despite a few more dark spots. I can't tell if the images in the bonuses are any different as I only have the BD.So, while I generally would turn to a BD version over the DVD version, I think in this case there is more reason to get the DVD than the BD. But, if you haven't seen this film before, with great acting by Henry Fonda and Darwell, then get it in either version. Just get it.My rating is a bit skewed. The film gets five stars (I love it), the bonuses three stars (it's OK) and  formatting between 3 and 4 stars.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Review of the new BD of the classic film ""The Grapes of Wrath"".",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,3411,"['review', 'new', 'BD', 'classic', 'film', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', '.First', 'off', 'when', 'reading', 'reviews', 'title', 'be', 'aware', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'versions', 'film', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'VHS', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'review', 'Bluray', 'sort', 'reviews', 'date', 'most', 'current', 'first', 'should', 'help', 'guide', 'you.With', 'said', 'review', 'single-disc', 'BD', 'released', 'June', '5', '2012', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'TGOW', 'classic', 'film', 'one', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 're-release', 'Fox', 'timely', 'much', 'US', 'still', 'recession', 'unemployment', 'high', 'are', 'many', 'folks', 're-locating', 'homes', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'evicted', 'already', 'looking', 'work', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'film', 'plot', 'are', '160', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'provide', 'info', 'So', ""'ll"", 'concentrate', 'BD', 'release', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'film', 'itself.TGOW', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'standard', 'format', '1.33:1', 'so', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'screen', 'aspect', 'TV', 'image', 'will', 'be', 'virtually', 'square', 'Even', 'older', 'non-flat', 'screen', 'TV', 'image', 'not', 'fill', 'screen', 'thick', 'black', 'border', 'sides', 'Direct', 'John', 'Ford', 'used', 'dark', 'images', 'lots', 'great', 'shadows', 'tell', 'story', 'BD', 'image', 'brighter', 'previous', 'releases', 'show', 'graininess', 'film', 'also', 'noted', 'early', 'scenes', 'brightness', 'would', 'waiver', 'got', 'used', 'concentrated', 'story.The', 'BD', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'track', 'same', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'series', 'short', 'Fox', 'Movietone', 'newsreels', 'dust', 'bowl', 'Academy', 'Award', 'presentation', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'who', 'won', 'award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'not', 'even', 'given', 'recognition', 'name', 'package', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'totally', '8-minutes', 'also', '25-minute', 'piece', 'Fox', 'Legacy', 'TV', 'show', 'Fox', 'course', 'Tom', 'Rothman', 'tried', 'get', 'Rothman', 'frankly', 'not', 'good', 'speaker', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'pompous', 'tastes', 'playing', 'Display', 'Aspect', 'control', 'BD', 'player', 'found', 'excerpts', 'film', 'were', 'included', 'Rothman', 'piece', 'were', 'ratio', 'image', 'was', 'squished', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'other', 'TVs', 'BD', 'also', 'option', 'watching', 'film', 'forward', 'included', 'British', 'release', 'producers', 'decided', 'was', 'necessary', 'explain', 'economic', 'conditions', 'US', 'British', 'theater', 'audience', 'nice', 'touch', 'completeness', 'last', 'bonus', 'A', 'E', 'episode', 'Producer', 'Daryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', '.Having', 'read', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'version', 'here', 'DVD', 'version', 'sharper', 'image', 'BD', 'few', 'more', 'dark', 'spots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'images', 'bonuses', 'are', 'different', 'only', 'have', 'BD.So', 'generally', 'would', 'turn', 'BD', 'version', 'DVD', 'version', 'think', 'case', 'more', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'BD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Darwell', 'then', 'get', 'version', 'Just', 'get', 'it.My', 'rating', 'bit', 'skewed', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'love', 'bonuses', 'three', 'stars', 'OK', 'formatting', '3', '4', 'stars.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
266539,A2FSHOTV0RNW7Q,6301797906,"Steven Sprague ""Eklecticmovies.com""","[5, 11]","Fans of John Steinbeck's masterpiece are bound to be somewhat disappointed by the structural and textural changes in John Ford's adaptation, especially the complete elimination of the controversial (even by today's standards) ending. In fairness, the late 1930's must be considered, in particular the (1) Communist ""menace"" in it's infancy, and the often spurious accusations leveled against labor rights organizations and their connections to the ""threat"" (real or imagined) of communism. (2) The very real threat of the California Farmer's Association - portrayed by Steinbeck as a neo-facist organization. (3) The strict Hays codes for ""decency"" in film. Given these substantial hurdles, it's amazing this film ever got made.The Story: GRAPES OF WRATH deals directly with the plight of the migrant farm workers from Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the ""dust bowl"" of the early 1930's when a combination of over planting and record droughts decimated the farmlands of the lower plains states, forcing the Westward migration of entire communities not only in search of a better life, but for their survival. Steinbeck directs his focus on one family in particular, the Joads of Oklahoma, led by elder son Tom, who in time becomes filled with an almost missionary zeal in his determination to relocate the family to greener pastures. By the story's end, this reluctant warrior will achieve almost mythical status as spokesman for a movement. The journey to California is filled with disaster, small triumphs, hunger and thirst,love, death, sickness and prejudice. California, advertised as the land of milk and honey by ruthless businessmen seeking to exploit the cheap labor, turns out to be a hotbed of hatred and violence. The collision course of the migrant workers, FDR's Resettlement Administration funded to assist those workers, and the powerful California Farmer's Association controlled by even more powerful business interests, sets the stage for the drama after the Joads finally reach California and a new struggle begins.The Film: Gregg Toland's starkly gray cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the novel, and even though many scenes are obviously filmed on a sound stage, the primary drawback seems to be a slight echo, which at times can be a bit distracting. The casting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad could not have been better and the acting throughout is very good, especially Jane Darwell's portrayal of Ma Joad, the ""rock"" and moral compass of the family. There are so many brilliant scenes in this film that make up for the exclusion of text, creating a visual editorial that is actually more visceral than dialogue and clearly establishes the farmers interdependence and love of the land, that substance that gives them their identity and manhood. When the men can no longer provide for their families, you can see the change of status on their weary faces and then the women forge ahead almost instinctively to ensure the survival of the family in a changing environment. The only real letdown of the film is the ending, which considerably tempers the unrelenting intensity of the novel, and indeed of the previous two hours of brilliance.The Commentary: The two ""scholars"" employed to provide commentary for this DVD edition, spend about a third of the time arguing whether Steinbeck became a conservative during the 1960's - a subject completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Furthermore, the connections they attempt to make between the plight of the dust bowl migrant workers of the 1930's and the Mexican workers so prevalent in today's agro business is absurd. Steinbeck's migrant workers were U.S. citizens that had worked their lands for generations, not illegals crossing the border because their own government continually refuses to provide redress for their plight. Additionally, the American migration of the 1930's often displaced Japanese and Mexican laborers. A more accurate comparison could have been made with the black population around the same time period and indeed all the way up until the 1960's. American citizens who were victims of prejudice within the borders of their own country by fellow citizens. Indeed, the Okie's (a negative epithet of the 1930's) were often called ""white Negroes.""",4,Excellent film - weak commentary,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,4271,"['Fans', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'structural', 'textural', 'changes', 'John', 'Ford', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'complete', 'elimination', 'controversial', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'ending', 'fairness', 'late', '1930', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'particular', '1', 'Communist', 'menace', 'infancy', 'often', 'spurious', 'accusations', 'leveled', 'labor', 'rights', 'organizations', 'connections', 'threat', 'real', 'imagined', 'communism', '2', 'very', 'real', 'threat', 'California', 'Farmer', 'Association', 'portrayed', 'Steinbeck', 'neo-facist', 'organization', '3', 'strict', 'Hays', 'codes', 'decency', 'film', 'Given', 'substantial', 'hurdles', 'amazing', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'made.The', 'Story', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'deals', 'directly', 'plight', 'migrant', 'farm', 'workers', 'Texas', 'Arkansas', 'Missouri', 'Oklahoma', 'dust', 'bowl', 'early', '1930', 'when', 'combination', 'planting', 'record', 'droughts', 'decimated', 'farmlands', 'lower', 'plains', 'states', 'forcing', 'Westward', 'migration', 'entire', 'communities', 'not', 'only', 'search', 'better', 'life', 'survival', 'Steinbeck', 'focus', 'one', 'family', 'particular', 'Joads', 'Oklahoma', 'led', 'elder', 'son', 'Tom', 'who', 'time', 'becomes', 'filled', 'almost', 'missionary', 'zeal', 'determination', 'relocate', 'family', 'greener', 'pastures', 'story', 'end', 'reluctant', 'warrior', 'will', 'achieve', 'almost', 'mythical', 'status', 'spokesman', 'movement', 'journey', 'California', 'filled', 'disaster', 'small', 'triumphs', 'hunger', 'thirst', 'love', 'death', 'sickness', 'prejudice', 'California', 'advertised', 'land', 'milk', 'honey', 'ruthless', 'businessmen', 'seeking', 'exploit', 'cheap', 'labor', 'out', 'be', 'hotbed', 'hatred', 'violence', 'collision', 'course', 'migrant', 'workers', 'FDR', 'Resettlement', 'Administration', 'funded', 'assist', 'workers', 'powerful', 'California', 'Farmer', 'Association', 'controlled', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'business', 'interests', 'stage', 'drama', 'Joads', 'finally', 'reach', 'California', 'new', 'struggle', 'begins.The', 'Film', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'starkly', 'gray', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'novel', 'even', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'sound', 'stage', 'primary', 'drawback', 'be', 'slight', 'echo', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'distracting', 'casting', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'portrayal', 'Ma', 'Joad', 'rock', 'moral', 'compass', 'family', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'exclusion', 'text', 'creating', 'visual', 'editorial', 'actually', 'more', 'visceral', 'dialogue', 'clearly', 'farmers', 'interdependence', 'love', 'land', 'substance', 'identity', 'manhood', 'When', 'men', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'provide', 'families', 'can', 'see', 'change', 'status', 'weary', 'then', 'women', 'forge', 'ahead', 'almost', 'instinctively', 'ensure', 'survival', 'family', 'changing', 'environment', 'only', 'real', 'letdown', 'film', 'ending', 'considerably', 'unrelenting', 'intensity', 'novel', 'indeed', 'previous', 'two', 'hours', 'brilliance.The', 'Commentary', 'two', 'scholars', 'employed', 'provide', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'edition', 'spend', 'third', 'time', 'arguing', 'Steinbeck', 'became', 'conservative', '1960', 'subject', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'discussion', 'hand', 'Furthermore', 'connections', 'attempt', 'make', 'plight', 'dust', 'bowl', 'migrant', 'workers', '1930', 'Mexican', 'workers', 'so', 'prevalent', 'today', 'agro', 'business', 'absurd', 'Steinbeck', 'migrant', 'workers', 'were', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'had', 'worked', 'lands', 'generations', 'not', 'illegals', 'crossing', 'border', 'own', 'government', 'continually', 'provide', 'redress', 'plight', 'Additionally', 'American', 'migration', '1930', 'often', 'displaced', 'Japanese', 'Mexican', 'laborers', 'more', 'accurate', 'comparison', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'black', 'population', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'indeed', 'way', '1960', 'American', 'citizens', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'prejudice', 'borders', 'own', 'country', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'Indeed', 'Okie', 'negative', 'epithet', '1930', 'were', 'often', 'called', 'white', 'Negroes']",N/A
266540,A2SN2IZPP06965,6301797906,Stormy Sand,"[1, 1]","In an emotionally stunning and perpetually twisting depression-era tale of survival and perseverance, this classic film adapted from historic author John Steinbeck delves into the lives of the tired and weary Joad family as they make their way from their recently relinquished farm in Oklahoma to the promising orange fields of California. As we watch their journey unfold, we witness just how emotionally and psychically demanding their campaign for a better life becomes while the lives of those around them are simultaneously affected at a similar cost.The film stars legendary screen actor Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a recently paroled convict coming home only to find that his once promising dream of re-acquaintance and celebration are marred by an open and desolate field of depression. Banks have been ordered to collect any salvageable assets during this economic hardship, thus using landowners and the companies that employ them to drive sharecroppers from their leased properties. I viewed the film in an edited form in my Modern American History class, starting at Scene 4 and watching up to a scene in which we witness the death of Grandma Joad (played dramatically by Zeffie Tilbury).  Award-winning actress Jane Darwell and John Carradine as Casy stand out as the more memorable of this immediate cast of tireless crusaders in a time of drought and migration.I feel Nunnally Johnson did a great job in adapting this film from Steinbeck's version, which I had read in high school a few years previous.  Few moderate changes were made, notably the death of a pregnant Ruthie (Shirley Mills), but I believe the film had the advantage of being given the added impact of a 1939 release (a time when the Great Depression and Dust Bowl Migration was still a fresh memory for many).  Also we see various themes portrayed in the film. The social stigma of sharecroppers and their plight, the tense rivalry of workers for jobs, even the ignorance of truck drivers at a diner pop up in the film to build on the story. In the end, this movie serves as a constant reminder of a period in history when so many people lost everything they had worked their whole lives for, only to find they could still hold onto their dreams...for this is the only thing that truly matters.",3,Enriching film for all ages,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2273,"['emotionally', 'stunning', 'perpetually', 'twisting', 'depression-era', 'tale', 'survival', 'perseverance', 'classic', 'film', 'adapted', 'historic', 'author', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'lives', 'tired', 'weary', 'Joad', 'family', 'make', 'way', 'recently', 'relinquished', 'farm', 'Oklahoma', 'promising', 'orange', 'fields', 'California', 'watch', 'journey', 'unfold', 'witness', 'just', 'how', 'emotionally', 'psychically', 'demanding', 'campaign', 'better', 'life', 'becomes', 'lives', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'affected', 'similar', 'cost.The', 'film', 'stars', 'legendary', 'screen', 'actor', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'recently', 'paroled', 'convict', 'coming', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'once', 'promising', 'dream', 're-acquaintance', 'celebration', 'are', 'marred', 'open', 'desolate', 'field', 'depression', 'Banks', 'have', 'been', 'ordered', 'collect', 'salvageable', 'assets', 'economic', 'hardship', 'thus', 'using', 'landowners', 'companies', 'employ', 'drive', 'sharecroppers', 'leased', 'properties', 'viewed', 'film', 'edited', 'form', 'Modern', 'American', 'History', 'class', 'starting', 'Scene', '4', 'watching', 'up', 'scene', 'witness', 'death', 'Grandma', 'Joad', 'played', 'dramatically', 'Zeffie', 'Tilbury', 'Award-winning', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Casy', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'memorable', 'immediate', 'cast', 'tireless', 'crusaders', 'time', 'drought', 'migration.I', 'feel', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'adapting', 'film', 'Steinbeck', 'version', 'had', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'few', 'years', 'previous', 'Few', 'moderate', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'notably', 'death', 'pregnant', 'Ruthie', 'Shirley', 'Mills', 'believe', 'film', 'had', 'advantage', 'being', 'given', 'added', 'impact', '1939', 'release', 'time', 'when', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'Migration', 'was', 'still', 'fresh', 'memory', 'many', 'Also', 'see', 'various', 'themes', 'portrayed', 'film', 'social', 'stigma', 'sharecroppers', 'plight', 'tense', 'rivalry', 'workers', 'jobs', 'even', 'ignorance', 'truck', 'drivers', 'diner', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'build', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'constant', 'reminder', 'period', 'history', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lost', 'everything', 'had', 'worked', 'whole', 'lives', 'only', 'find', 'could', 'still', 'hold', 'dreams', 'only', 'thing', 'truly', 'matters']",N/A

The John Ford film adaptation is brilliant and Henry Fonda should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Jane Darwell's performance of Ma Joad earned her an Academy Award for Supporting Actress in a Film. The film is shot in black and white and restored.The film is a brilliant American film classic that should be on everybody's list of greatest film movies about the American experience. The DVD also has two scholars about John Steinbeck and John Ford in the commentary section of the film. If you want to watch the film first, I would recommend that. I saw the commentary version as part of a paper assignment which was mostly talking over the entire film. The extras included Jane Darwell's Oscar acceptance speech where it wasn't an actual Oscar but an Academy Award. The other extras included movie tone footage of the Dust Bowl.The Grapes of Wrath is a brilliant film and this DVD is worth the cost if you are interested in the Dust Bowl, the migration of thousands of families to the West in search of a better life in California.

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loos'd the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword, His truth is marching on."" - Battle Hymn of the Republic.In 1936, John Steinbeck wrote a series of articles about the migrant workers driven to California from the Midwestern states after losing their homes in the throes of the depression: inclement weather, failed crops, land mortgaged to the hilt and finally taken over by banks and large corporations when credit lines ran dry.  Lured by promises of work aplenty, the Midwesterners packed their belongings and trekked westward to the Golden State, only to find themselves facing hunger, inhumane conditions, contempt and exploitation instead.  ""Dignity is all gone, and spirit has turned to sullen anger before it dies,"" Steinbeck described the result in one of his 1936 articles, collectively published as ""The Harvest Gypsies;"" and in another piece (""Starvation Under the Orange Trees,"" 1938) he asked:  ""Must the hunger become anger and the anger fury before anything will be done?""By the time he wrote the latter article, Steinbeck had already published one novel addressing the agricultural laborers' struggle against corporate power (""In Dubious Battle,"" 1936).  Shortly thereafter he began to work on ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" which was published roughly a year later.  Although the book would win the Pulitzer Prize (1940) and become a cornerstone foundation of Steinbeck's Literature Nobel Prize (1962), it was sharply criticized upon its release - nowhere more so than in the Midwest - and still counts among the 35 books most frequently banned from American school curricula:  A raw, brutally direct, yet incredibly poetic masterpiece of fiction, it continues to touch nerves deeply rooted in modern society's fabric; including and particularly in California, where yesterday's Okies are today's undocumented Mexicans - Chicano labor leader Cesar Chavez especially pointed out how well he could empathize with the Joad family, because he and his fellow workers were now living the same life they once had.Having fought hard with his publisher to maintain the novel's uncompromising approach throughout, Steinbeck was weary to give the film rights to 20th Century Fox, headed by powerful mogul and, more importantly, known conservative Daryl F. Zanuck.  Yet, Zanuck and director John Ford largely stayed true to the novel:  There is that sense of desperation in farmer Muley's (John Qualen's) expression as he tells Tom and ex-preacher Casy (Henry Fonda and John Carradine) how the ""cats"" came and bulldozed down everybody's homes, on behalf of a corporate entity too intangible to truly hold accountable.  There is Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin), literally clinging to his earth and dying of a stroke (or, more likely, a broken heart) when he is made to leave against his will.  There is everybody's brief joy upon first seeing Bakersfield's rich plantations - everybody's except Ma Joad's (Jane Darwell's), that is, who alone knows that Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) died in her arms before they even started to cross the Californian desert the previous night.  There is the privately-run labor camps' utter desolation, complete with violent guards, exploitative wages, lack of food and unsanitary conditions; contrasted with the relative security and more humane conditions of the camps run by the State.  And there is Tom's crucial development from a man acting alone to one seeing the benefit of joining efforts in a group, following Casy's example, and his parting promise to Ma that she'll find him everywhere she looks - wherever there is injustice, struggle, and people's joint success.  In an overall outstanding cast, which also includes Dorris Bowdon (Rose of Sharon), Eddie Quillan (Rose's boyfriend Connie), Frank Darien (Uncle John) and a brief appearance by Ward Bond as a friendly policeman, Henry Fonda truly shines as Tom; despite his smashing good looks fully metamorphosized into Steinbeck's quick-tempered, lanky, reluctant hero.Yet, in all its starkness the movie has a more optimistic slant than the novel; due to a structural change which has the Joads moving from bad to acceptable living conditions (instead of vice versa), the toning down of Steinbeck's political references - most importantly, the elimination of a monologue using a land owner's description of ""reds"" as anybody ""that wants thirty cents and hour when we're payin' twenty-five"" to show that under the prevalent conditions that definition applies to virtually *every* migrant laborer - and a greater emphasis on Ma Joad's pragmatic, forward-looking way of dealing with their fate; culminating in her closing ""we's the people"" speech (whose direction, interestingly, Ford, who would have preferred to end the movie with the image of Tom walking up a hill alone in the distance, left to Zanuck himself).  Jane Darwell won a much-deserved Academy-Award for her portrayal as Ma; besides John Ford's Best Director award the movie's only winner on Oscar night - none of its other five nominations scored, unfortunately including those in the Best Picture and Best Leading Actor categories, which went to Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and James Stewart (""The Philadelphia Story"") instead.  Still, despite its critical success - also expressed in a ""Best Picture"" National Board of Review award - and its marginally optimistic outlook, the movie engendered almost as much controversy as did Steinbeck's book.  After the witch hunt setting in not even a decade later, today it stands as one of the last, greatest examples of a movie pulling no punches in the portrayal of society's ailments; a type of film regrettably rare in recent years.""Ev'rybody might be just one big soul - well it looks that-a way to me. ... Wherever men are fightin' for their rights, that's where I'm gonna be, ma.  That's where I'm gonna be."" - Woody Guthrie, ""The Ballad of Tom Joad.""""The highway is alive tonight, but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.  I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light, with the ghost of old Tom Joad."" - Bruce Springsteen, ""The Ghost of Tom Joad.""Also recommended:John Steinbeck : Novels and Stories, 1932-1937 : The

266544,AN84BDHH63TBN,6301797906,"Timothy N. Stelly Sr. ""Stellbread""","[2, 2]","This film is probably director John Ford's crowning glory (he won the Best Director Oscar), but the key piece to this wonderful mosaic of characters in this American tragedy, is Henry Fonda (Oscar winner for Best Actor).The two roles I most remember Fonda for is his portrayal of the holdout juror in ""Twelve Angry Men"" and in the role of Tom Joad, in this poignant tale of hope among ruins.I first saw this film when I was in the eighth grade (1971), and I never forgot it. It was one of the first videos I purchased after I bought my VCR, and I have two DVD copies. Fonda's performance is one of the strongest I've ever seen, and I think it was easy for him to being Joad to life because of his own Midwestern roots. Fonda grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and as a youth witnessed the lynching of a black man named Will Brown. Fonda later said that the experience had a profound effect on him and it showed in many of the underdog and everyman roles he chose.Joad is a character first etched in the psyche of Americans in the novel by John Steinbeck on which the film is based. He is an ex-con, but a down home fella in the truest sense of the word. He's a cynic, whose discerning view is honed by the despair his friends and family suffer when they lose their land during the dust bowl of the 1930's.I won't elaborate on the plot any further: I think most of us know the story. What makes the film a classic is not so much the plot as the acting and cinematography. The black and white film further emphasizes the stark reality that America was a ""tale of two cities"": Americans surviving hard times and so-called ""Oakies"" who lived on hope as much as bread and water.The cast is a large one, but Ford has no problem showing us the contrast in each one, from the sad-eyed hope of Ma Joad (Jane Darwin, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) to the merriment of the children who travel across country in the family's jalopy and who despite their poverty, find joy in just being. The viewer never gets lost in the shuffle and can see that each character is sharply defined.Oscar worthy execution not only from Fonda, Darwin and Ford--but also John Carradine as Casey, a former preacher who has lost his faith and is the most downtrodden character of all these tragic figures.Though the story takes place nearly a century ago, this tale of real Americans stands the test of time and will be enjoyed by generations to come.

Ford contributed his usual unbearable sentimentality (sentimentality defined as &quot;unearned emotion&quot;).  Henry Fonda gave his usual authenticity to an already melodramatic script.

They move to California to find better work and jobs, only to find that there s little opportunity. The family goes through rough times, but they hold together because they know that they can preserver.""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a very well made movie. The acting is superb from all sides. I didn't notice any melodramatics from anyway, though there might be an occasion or two. The only other problem I had with them movie was some occasional slowdown. But I don't mind, because I'm not one of those people who expect excitement every second.Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad. A convict out on parole, he goes with his family to California. Some experiences along the way help to change him and make him a better person.  He soon realizes that people are more important and vows to devote his help to those who need it more and to those who aren't as fortunate. He got an Oscar nomination,But was unsuccessful. The film also got a Best Picture nomination, but lost to ""Rebecca"", the first American film of Alfred Hitchcock (Then again, I've rarely agreed with the Academy). Jane Darwell, however, won Best Supporting Actress as Ma Joad, the ""emotional anchor"" of the family, and Director John Ford picked up is second award. He would also win one the following year to ""How Green Was My Valley"" and in 1952 for ""The Quiet Man"".Another of the film's best virtues is in the cinematography. There is usage of low angle shots in interior scenes (Rare in movies at this time because that's where the equipment was placed) and deep focus in several scenes (Where everything in the scene is focused in).
