Meant to draw teens and young adults, the near futuristic world of Tokyo is well drawn alternating beautiful art direction matched with bleak landscapes.In the dystopian setting  Tokyo is plagued by contractors,  deadly human-like beings who are difficult to detect and even more difficult to destroy.  Taking place ten years after they first put up a wall upon the city and have illuminated the night sky with fake stars, a group of secret agents work undercover to find and overthrow their terror.  To complicate matters, the contractors can erase people's memories, making it even more difficult to gather information and discern the bad guys from the good guys.`Darker than Black' is somewhat addicting.  Like all good serials, it can glue your interest for finding out more.  As science fiction it reminded me of movies like `Paprika,' `Dark City,' and the recent resurgence of zombie movies.  At first the scenes are convoluted, but with a little patience the revelations of subsequent episodes start to gel and become more fascinating.  All said and done, the show provides a fun little shell-game chase.",4,Better Than Most,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,1215,"['Compared', 'most', 'animated', 'fare', 'Japanese', 'serial', 'Darker', 'Black', 'more', 'intriguing', 'compelling', 'Meant', 'draw', 'teens', 'young', 'adults', 'near', 'futuristic', 'world', 'Tokyo', 'well', 'drawn', 'alternating', 'beautiful', 'art', 'direction', 'matched', 'bleak', 'landscapes.In', 'dystopian', 'setting', 'Tokyo', 'plagued', 'contractors', 'deadly', 'human-like', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'difficult', 'detect', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'destroy', 'Taking', 'place', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'put', 'up', 'wall', 'city', 'have', 'illuminated', 'night', 'sky', 'fake', 'stars', 'group', 'secret', 'agents', 'work', 'undercover', 'find', 'overthrow', 'terror', 'complicate', 'matters', 'contractors', 'can', 'erase', 'people', 'memories', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'gather', 'information', 'discern', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys.', 'Darker', 'Black', 'somewhat', 'addicting', 'good', 'serials', 'can', 'glue', 'interest', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'science', 'fiction', 'reminded', 'movies', 'Paprika', 'Dark', 'City', 'recent', 'resurgence', 'zombie', 'movies', 'first', 'scenes', 'are', 'convoluted', 'little', 'patience', 'revelations', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'start', 'gel', 'become', 'more', 'fascinating', 'said', 'done', 'show', 'fun', 'little', 'shell-game', 'chase']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set
1187855,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001F2U72S,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","A gateway to some Hellish or incomprehensible reality has opened. An initial attempt at investigating wasn't exactly successful. Of those who went, only one returned and he returned a strange man. People built a wall to shield themselves from the unknowable but, and this is not common knowledge, 'the contractors' are now infiltrating our world. It's them and 'the dolls' and something that looks like a cat but talks like a man and it's us who are in big trouble but we don't know it because, except for the very few 'in the know', all who interact with a 'contractor' have their memories erased.Is this Anime at its best? I honestly don't know because I would not call myself an expert or even a fan but I do dig Sci-Fi and I did find the 2 hours worth of 'Darker than Black' worth watching. So did my tween kids who are a more into this than I will ever be.And, since I brought 'kids' into the conversation, yes, there is blood, dismemberment, people being burned or frozen alive but we all live in a violent world that's not getting any gentler so, given where 'the norm' is today, I couldn't say that there is anything truly shocking that would impress or scare any kid above 12. There is no nudity or anything of a sexual nature beyond a kiss and I don't believe there's any smoking, drinking or illegal substance abuse either.This specific DVD release has the first 5 episodes of what appears to be a series and 'Part 2' is already announced. The quality of the picture and sound appear acceptable but not exactly mind-blowing - I am currently watching 'Lost' on DVD and I would call THAT mind-blowing for a DVD. The voices for this release are supplied by English-speaking actors and they are quite good. Interestingly, the English subtitles seem to be coming out from a different translation and you would rarely find one sentence where the spoken English words coincide with the written subtitles. The 2 songs that play at the beginning and at the end of each episode are in Japanese but, following the great Japanese tradition in Rock matters, a couple of the lyrics lines are in English.In brief, I appreciated the opportunity to watch 2 hours to good quality Anime with a rather decent story line - resembling the American 'Heroes' series in many ways. I did not like the fact that this supposedly stand-alone DVD has only 5 episodes of what seems to be a many-episodes series where the fifth episode is 'part one' of a story that spans over 2 or 3 episodes. I understand that 'stuff' has to be marketed but this is not fair marketing, in my view.3 stars is an above-average, positive rating on a scale where 5 stars is exceptional and 4 stars is 'great'. I took away one star for the marketing gimmick that had me watching the last episode and realizing that I may never know how that specific story ended and another for the overall presentation having to do with the functional but not outstanding DVD menu, the rather thin 'extras', the curious discrepancies between the English voices vs. the English subtitles and for the good but not spectacular quality of the picture and sound.Note 1 - the title of this review is lifted from one of the song's lyrics.Note 2 - the copy that I reviewed did not include the 'collectible art box' and I can not judge if the 'box' would justify paying almost twice as much for the option that includes it vs. purchasingDarker Than Black, Vol. 1without the 'box' and saving some money or, you could go for one of the 5-DVD or 6-DVD sets that are currently available at Amazon.",3,Howling in the Shadows,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,3527,"['gateway', 'Hellish', 'incomprehensible', 'reality', 'opened', 'initial', 'attempt', 'investigating', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'successful', 'who', 'went', 'only', 'one', 'returned', 'returned', 'strange', 'man', 'People', 'built', 'wall', 'shield', 'unknowable', 'not', 'common', 'knowledge', 'contractors', 'are', 'now', 'infiltrating', 'world', ""'the"", 'dolls', 'something', 'cat', 'talks', 'man', 'who', 'are', 'big', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'few', 'know', 'who', 'interact', ""'contractor"", 'have', 'memories', 'erased.Is', 'Anime', 'best', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'expert', 'even', 'fan', 'do', 'dig', 'Sci-Fi', 'did', 'find', '2', 'hours', ""'Darker"", 'Black', 'worth', 'watching', 'So', 'did', 'tween', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'will', 'ever', 'be.And', 'brought', ""'kids"", 'conversation', 'yes', 'blood', 'dismemberment', 'people', 'being', 'burned', 'frozen', 'alive', 'live', 'violent', 'world', 'not', 'getting', 'gentler', 'so', 'given', 'where', ""'the"", 'norm', 'today', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'truly', 'shocking', 'would', 'impress', 'scare', 'kid', '12', 'nudity', 'anything', 'sexual', 'nature', 'kiss', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'illegal', 'substance', 'abuse', 'either.This', 'specific', 'DVD', 'release', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'what', 'be', 'series', '2', 'already', 'announced', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'appear', 'acceptable', 'not', 'exactly', 'mind-blowing', 'am', 'currently', 'watching', 'DVD', 'would', 'call', 'mind-blowing', 'DVD', 'voices', 'release', 'are', 'supplied', 'English-speaking', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Interestingly', 'English', 'subtitles', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'different', 'translation', 'would', 'rarely', 'find', 'one', 'sentence', 'where', 'spoken', 'English', 'words', 'coincide', 'written', 'subtitles', '2', 'songs', 'play', 'beginning', 'end', 'episode', 'are', 'Japanese', 'following', 'great', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'Rock', 'matters', 'couple', 'lyrics', 'lines', 'are', 'English.In', 'brief', 'appreciated', 'opportunity', 'watch', '2', 'hours', 'good', 'quality', 'Anime', 'rather', 'decent', 'story', 'line', 'resembling', 'American', ""'Heroes"", 'series', 'many', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'supposedly', 'stand-alone', 'DVD', 'only', '5', 'episodes', 'what', 'be', 'many-episodes', 'series', 'where', 'fifth', 'episode', ""'part"", 'one', 'story', 'over', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'understand', ""'stuff"", 'be', 'marketed', 'not', 'fair', 'marketing', 'view.3', 'stars', 'above-average', 'positive', 'rating', 'scale', 'where', '5', 'stars', 'exceptional', '4', 'stars', ""'great"", 'took', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'marketing', 'gimmick', 'had', 'watching', 'last', 'episode', 'realizing', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'specific', 'story', 'ended', 'overall', 'presentation', 'having', 'do', 'functional', 'not', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'menu', 'rather', 'thin', ""'extras"", 'curious', 'discrepancies', 'English', 'voices', 'vs.', 'English', 'subtitles', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound.Note', '1', 'title', 'review', 'lifted', 'one', 'song', 'lyrics.Note', '2', 'copy', 'reviewed', 'did', 'not', 'include', ""'collectible"", 'art', 'box', 'can', 'not', 'judge', ""'box"", 'would', 'justify', 'paying', 'almost', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'option', 'vs.', 'purchasingDarker', 'Than', 'Black', 'Vol', '1without', ""'box"", 'saving', 'money', 'could', 'go', 'one', '5-DVD', '6-DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'Amazon']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set
1187856,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,B001F2U72S,Alexander Lucard,"[0, 0]","Darker Than Black is a 25 episode shonen oriented anime that will be released in five volumes here in the US. There is a 26th episode released as an OVA in Japan, but I'm unsure if it will be included in the English translation of the TV series as it was a standalone.I have to admit I was really blown away by the first two episodes, which in fact are one large episode. Most of the series save for the last few episodes are all two partners. This makes the five episodes per disc a bit annoying as the DVD thus ends on a cliff hanger, but I digress. The first two episodes are a great setup for the full series, introducing all of the characters and hitting you with a very unexpected plot twist around the focal character Chiaki.The core of the story revolves around two strange and nebulous areas that appeared suddenly. They are called Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate. The series takes place ten years after these ""gates"" first appeared and five years after Heaven's Gate imploded. When these gates appeared, they also blacked out the heavens. Now what appears to be stars, are actually some undefined nebulous things. Each of these fake stars is specifically connected to a ""Contractor"" which seems to be in reference to selling one's souls. Contractors gain great power but also become emotionless beings that have to perform acts of OCD after each use of their power. It seems that their power replaces their humanity, hence my earlier reference to selling one's soul. At the same time there do seem to be good and evil Contractors, even though the good ones are at best, anti-heroes.There are four main characters: Hei, Yin, Huang, and Mao. Hei (Black) is also known as Messer BK-201 and is the main protagonist. Hei seems to have a split personality between a typical anime good natured but slightly daffy student and a cold merciless killer. It's as if he can emotionally cauterize himself at will. I'm sure the series will go into this as the episodes go on, but for this first DVD collection, it can be a bit jarring. Yin (Silver) is is the spy of the team, with the ability to use a pool of water as a scrying device that allows her to see through any other body of water on Earth.  Mao is a person whose soul has been trapped in the body of a cat. In this collection they don't touch on what happened to Mao's original body, but I'm sure they will in later collections. Finally there's Huang, who seems to be the only human amongst the team. He also seems to have a lot of disdain for the rest of the team, but like Mao, they don't go into Huang's back story as to where this resentment comes from.I enjoyed the voice acting in both English and Japanese, although this is one of those rare anime (Like Slayers, Pokemon and Tenchi Muyo) where I preferred the English dub over the Japanese original tracks. The music of Darker Than Black is amazing, and I found myself humming the songs even days after viewing this DVD.The main downside to this first volume of Darker than Black is the price. The MSRP is $39.98 and Amazon has it for $35.99. This is insanity, pure and simple, especially when you can buy full anime series for the same amount. That includes series likeRune Soldier - Complete Collection,Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki: Box Set The Complete Series, and more. Of course, that's the price for the first DVD and the starter box. The DVD alone is only $21.99, which is more acceptable, but that's still a nickel under $110 for the full series, which is why i strongly suggest to people to wait for ""complete"" or ""perfect"" collections of series to hit shelves. These full collections go between $35 and $60 dollars which is far easier on your wallet and sanity. I purchasedThe X-Files: The Complete Collector's Editionoff Amazon for the same price as it will cost to collect this single anime series. As such, I can't support Darker Than Black in its current form and price.So to sum it all up, Darker Than Black is a promising new anime than reminds me of a better doneSerial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set (Signature Series)orBoogiepop Phantom DVD Thinpak Collection, but the cost of collecting the entire series is exorbitant, which is sadly true of many anime series when they first are localized. Thumbs in the middle, but if my review has you at all intrigued, then perhaps you cast justify the cost where I could not.",3,A Great First Start To a Promising New Anime Series.

You are introduced to a character that pretty much doesn't give a care in the world taking another life. Sound interesting? It gets even more interesting after the first few episodes. Darker than Black focus on mainly around the abnormalities known as ""contractors"" and those they come in contact with (mainly humans) who they, the contractors, wouldn't hesitate to kill without a second thought. Logic rules them and their emotions, most of the time. Not only that, they have to do something in return for using their rather strange ""powers."" The characters certainly are interesting. Each having their own past which they must escape or look for. Others just want to have peace and quite.

Being that this only contains one disc, with only 5 episodes, it is hard to fully judge the series.No spoilers from me, but the storyline is set in the near future, the Hell's Gate has opened and all of the stars in the sky have been replaced by fake stars that are representations of ""Contractors"". The episodes on the disc somewhat slowly bring us up to speed on the back story of how beings with special abilities, like ""Contractors"" (remorseless assassins with special powers that come with a price), ""Dolls"" (basically blank humans who can be implanted with temporary memories/personalities or who can perform specific functions like remote sensing and observation), and some hybrids thrown into the mix as well.There are several groups of players interacting, including a special police unit that tracks ""Contractors"", The Syndicate (including the main ""Contractor"" Hei/Bk201), various governments (references to French, Americans, and British spy agencies), and other criminal groups (all employing ""Contractors"").As the storyline unfolds it becomes apparent that not all ""Contractors"" follow the stereotype and in the cliffhanger final episode, we learn something about Hei's motivation (again, no spoilers).

I find it to be pretentious and confusing, though to be fair the latter is likely caused by the fact that I wasn't raised in Japan, so lots of nuance that would make sense if I had been does not. I've enjoyed some anime (""Star Blazers"" and ""Project A-ko"" both spring to mind), but most just passes me by, including such classics as ""Akira"".That in mind, I approached ""Darker than Black"" with a certain sense of trepidation. Would it be good? Would it even be watchable? To my surprise I found that, yes, it was both, and then some.The five episodes included in this disc tell the story of a world where super-powered beings called ""Contractors"" exist. These people can do any number of things, like teleportation or pyrokenesis. But this isn't quite like ""X-Men"". When these folk use their powers they are compelled afterwards to do something to ""pay the price"" for having used them. This might be something minor like a non-smoker having to smoke, or someone having to line up rocks in a particular pattern, to something more major, like someone who has to dislocate the fingers on one of their hands.The series does a good job of creating the world these Contractors live in. It's a world that comes with its own slang, which doesn't come off as pretentious as I feared it might. Especially interesting is that the Contractors are all identified with various stars. I thought that was kinda neat.The voice acting is good and the animation is decent. The plot's quite good as well.One minor complaint with the DVD is that it features a trailer at the beginning that you cannot skip past. I hate it when DVD companies do that.I am overall pleased with the show. I'm not likely to buy anymore episodes but if they're shown on TV I'd probably watch them.",3,"Hey, you!

I've seen Akira, some Golgo 13, Robotech (Macross), Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, etc.  They were all really good.  Here I expected something similar, hopefully a nice supernatural / sci-fi series.  Granted, Japanese culture is different from here in the US and their story telling sometimes seem very alien to ours - but that makes it interesting right?  Yes.Well my gripe here is not with the movie; it's with the company that translated the movie.  I enjoy watching in Japanese with subtitles - a tradition I had to embrace during the VHS days when audio was not changeable.  Many VHS tapes in the 80's had either dubbed audio or subtitles - my cousin talked me into sticking with the subtitles, which I've enjoyed all these years.  So to change things up a little bit, I watched this movie without subtitles at first listening to the English audio translation.  Out of curiosity, I later switched to the subtitles... big problem.  The story seemed different.  This character is from the city?  I thought they said before he was from China?  Well that's because the audio translation and subtitle translation are different... what?  That's right the story often leaves out info or adds extra for no reason - which is right?  Well only those fluent in Japanese know for sure.  The story itself is interesting, but this little tidbit about the story changes sure affected my concentration.

1187863,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001F2U72S,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","Like a lot of good anime, Darker Than Black tells a convoluted story set in a surreal universe and peopled with plenty of mysteriously complex characters.  I think I have a pretty good feel for the story after watching the first five episodes included in this first volume, but I'm pretty sure I've only glimpsed the tip of the iceberg here.  This is a good thing, though.  I'm continually amazed by the depth of both character and story in title after title coming out of Japan, and Darker Than Black is no exception.  This isn't the most lavishly animated series I've ever seen; in fact, backgrounds are often quite bland.  The story is the thing, and there's nothing bland about that.It's been ten years since the strange and mysterious Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo, bringing with it several breeds of superhumans.  Even the sky is no longer real in Tokyo, but the average citizen has no idea that the stars he sees in the sky each now represent one of the ""contractors,"" men and women whose superhuman abilities are put to use for bad purposes such as assassinations and thievery.  Each contractor has his own special skill - and (in probably the weirdest aspect of the story) his own special ""price"" to pay for the use of that skill.  This strange new world also counts an unknown number of ""dolls,"" individuals who can track any given person anywhere by some kind of strange water conduction and the rarest bird of all, the ""moratorium.""  Cop and contractor alike is wary of a moratorium because, despite the name, the moratorium has the most devastating skills of all - and little or no control over the unleashing of that power.The ""star"" of the series is Hei, an anti-hero contractor also known as the Black Reaper.  Hei's a fascinating character because he is both good and bad, and it's hard to know exactly what his whole game plan is.  His associates include a fairly unlikeable coordinator, a ""doll,"" and a talking cat.  Hei can be a comforter one minute and a villain the next - although you get the idea that he has to be working for some kind of common good, despite his contractor nature.  This show doesn't pull any punches, so don't expect to see secondary characters hanging around for multiple episodes.  Even I was surprised by a scene in episode 4 in which a terrified girl watches a terrible tragedy play out by her own unwilling hands.I'll need more than these first five episodes to really understand what exactly is going on here, and I definitely want to get my hands on future volumes.

It is a dark, violent story, with many of the foibles and kinetic appeal of Japanese animation... sometimes the animation seems crude, other times it is exhilarating. The plot is engaging and swift, with themes similar to graphic novels such as Ed Brubaker's ""Sleeper"" or Brian Michael Bendis's ""Powers,"" an exploration of super-powered entities within the ""real"" world, and the level of violence that might entail.  It's a reasonably entertaining story arc, although this first disc, with five episodes on it, doesn't really resolve much or cover as much ground as some viewers might like to fully draw them in to this world.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","An area of paranormal space called Hell's Gate formed near Tokyo, around the time people with mysterious powers -- called ""contractors"" -- started appearing.That's the concept behind the anime series ""Darker than Black."" While the concept  -- mysterious people with dangerous psychic powers and a powerful young man hunting them -- doesn't sound terribly interesting on its own, the way it's handled makes it a truly memorable experience. Countless mysteries, solid writing and a bloodspattered noir atmosphere boost ""Darker than Black Volume 1"" above the norm.Not many anime start with the anti-hero brutally killing someone -- Hei, a mysterious young man in a black coat and mask, hunts down and kills a blond man on a rooftop. Meanwhile, a young woman with a tragic past is being pursued by the police and a band of contractors, and her new neighbor Li -- who is pretty obviously Hei -- is her only hope for escaping them. Their goal seems to be a mysterious item that her boyfriend left with her, but is it their real objective... or are they really after Hei?When Hei gets to his new job, he encounters a broken, reclusive scientist who once actually went into the Gate -- and the man's daughter, who seems to have fires pop up randomly around her. Hei befriends the girl as he tries to figure out if she's a contractor or a moratorium -- a contractor with uncontrollable powers. The answer to this puzzle lies inside her father's experiences inside the Gate....And MI6 brings a mysterious woman -- a ""regressor"" named Havoc, who has lost her powers -- into Tokyo for research, along with a charming, brutal MI6 contractor named November 11. The police inspector Misaki Kirihara becoms embroiled with the struggle to get Havoc back, but the Syndicate have their own plans for her -- and Hei has information that he desperately wants from her.""Darker than Black"" doesn't exactly spoil you with information -- in the first five episodes, it raises countless mysteries and bizarre questions while rarely answering them. We don't know who the evil contractors work for, what the Syndicate is, what phenomenon the Hell's Gate is, the nature of various governments' involvement, what those blue blobs on the power lines are, and where contractors come from, what they are, or even what will happen if they don't fulfill their compulsions.Heck, we don't even know why one of Hei's buddies appears to be a talking cat. Just try to guess what's happening there.So ""Darker than Black"" is a bit difficult to get into at first. Fortunately when taken alone, the episodes are brilliant -- murky storylines, unexpected twists and complications, and some bittersweet, poignant moments such as Mai and Hei's brief moments at a light-filled amusement park. But the superpowers also provide plenty of gore and horror -- peoples are sliced apart, burned up instantly, explode and are frozen solid -- and there's some delving into how people regard contractors.Hei is as enigmatic as the backstory of this series -- on one hand, he's a ruthless ""black reaper"" who electrocutes and garrotes contractors, and seems to be a contractor himself. But he also shows compassion and sorrow for the non-contractors that he comes into contact with, and the fifth episode reveals a teeny tiny shred of backstory for our mysterious anti-hero. As for his pals in the Syndicate, we have yet to see much about them -- although the cool-headed policewoman is a cool, unusual character.""Darker than Black"" is incredibly confusing at times, with lots of answers yet to be revealed.

1187869,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001F2U72S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[20, 24]","To start with, DARKER THAN BLACK is a damn nifty title. And, it turns out, this anime series is pretty intriguing. The deal-io is this: Some years ago, Hell's Gate opened up in Tokyo, giving rise to wide-ranging anomalies and wiping the heavens of its stars, replacing them with false ones. Hell's Gate (and Heaven's Gate, in South America) also gave birth to Dolls and Contractors. Dolls are passive  mediums who can spy from remote distances, and on whom can be imprinted temporary identites and personalities. Contractors are assassins and covert operatives, those who have gained paranormal talents and rendered detached and amoral. As such, they feel no remorse when engaged in wet works.A fascinating fallout of a Contractor's power is that the bearer is forced into obsessive compulsive behavior. After accessing one's ability, a Contractor must then perform a remuneration of some sort (arranging pebbles, dog-earing the pages of a book, scarfing bowlfuls of noodles, etc.). This is how the Contractor fulfills his own personal contract. I dig that there's one Contractor who particularly loathes cigarette-smoking, but guess what his price is, for using his power? Another nice conceit of the show is that each of the new stars corresponds to a Contractor, and so, each Contractor is also associated with his star's Messier catalogue number (from Messier's system of assigning numbers to foreign bodies in the sky, for purposes of identification). For example, Hei's Messier Code is BK-201. But Hei is also known as the fearsome Black Reaper. He's the anti-hero of the series.So, hey, who's Hei? He's an unassuming Chinese exchange student going by the moniker of Li Shengshun, newly arrived to Japan. Or that's his cover anyway. Hei is a Contractor. His power is generating electricity, although he's also very skilled at wielding this cable/garotte-like device. His associates comprise of a scruffy field advisor, a blue-haired Doll serving as a locator, and a talking cat, and they work for some shadowy, occasionally referred-to syndicate, although the show is keeping details close to the vest. They go around taking on this or that mission, even as rumors of the Black Reaper continue to rock the underworld.Meanwhile, on the periphery, a gutsy female police inspector is poking around, bent on nabbing the Reaper.DARKER THAN BLACK is a promising anime series; it's got some good stuff going for it. The animation looks good, and is in that by now generic COWBOY BEBOP style. I also like the gritty, noirish elements of the show. In brief moments, there are echoes of BLADE RUNNER in its poignancy and existential angst. And I'm very curious about further ramifications concerning Hell's Gate. The series also boasts its own terminology, in which words like ""moratorium,"" ""forfeiter,"" ""contractor,"" and ""doll"" carry unexpected definitions.But here's the thing: I found myself feeling ambivalent about the self-contained central character; it's hard to get a read on this guy. The occasional ominous tone sensed here is partly brought on by Hei's oblique nature - you don't quite trust him. The storytelling doesn't focus much on character development; it's more intent on progressing the plot, which, by the way, tends to be nebulous and deliberately paced. There's no easy gratification in terms of getting comprehensively briefed on who's who and what's what. While DARKER THAN BLACK promptly establishes the rules of its universe, it then becomes stingy with further revelations. There are passing mentions of relevant current events and backstory, but these carrots aren't spelled out as much as thrown into the exposition, and done so casually that you have to strain your ears. If you blink, you might miss out on tidbits on Hell's Gate and on the conflict involving the UK in Argentinian soil. This initial bunch of episodes teases you along, counting on its excellence of quality to curb your impatience. It worked for me.The DARKER THAN BLACK starter set collects the series' first five episodes and runs at 2 hours. The inaugural two-parter ""The Fallen Star of a Contract"" - centering on a frightened runaway lab researcher and her unpretentious rescuer - had me scratching my head some with its bewildering turns and its characters' murky motivations. The second episode, by the way, is marked with a sad, bittersweet ending, so, hurrah for you, if you're into that. In the second two-parter ""A New Star Shines in the Dawn Sky,"" a star is born, meaning, in the parlance of the series, that someone has just manifested Contractor abilities. And she's a high school teenager. ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe (Part 1)"" is the last included episode and pits Hei against MI6 agents who've abducted a notorious ex-Contractor. Who happens to hold crucial information desperately needed by Hei. This is the first episode in which we learn something significantly personal to Hei.Bonus stuff includes: a relaxed, semi-goofy audio commentary on Episode 002 by American voice actors Jason Liebrecht (Hei) and Colleen Clinkenbeard (Chiaki); Cast Auditions, the English version, as the voice actors perform off-the-screen readings; Production Artwork - character bios and black & white sketches and descriptions of various settings and objects in the series; an option to play the opening (""Howling"") or the closing (""Tsukiakari"") songs; and trailers for DARKER THAN BLACK and other anime films. This being the starter set collection, there's also an empty art box included, which can either store future collected volumes in the series, or air. It's really up to you.If all you have to go on are these five episodes, you might be tempted to jump ship. I'm leaning towards giving this anime show a chance, because the premise is that intriguing to me, and the production values are top notched. I don't mind the slow burn approach, as long as there's an eventual payoff. In the meantime, Hei remains an enigmatic character, garbed in that obligatory cool black duster. But I'm still not sure I like him.",4,"""Now I've lost it, I know I can kill.""",1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,6015,"['start', 'DARKER', 'THAN', 'BLACK', 'damn', 'nifty', 'title', 'out', 'anime',

Here they aren't mutants, but ""contractors.""  And they pay a price for using their abilities.  But, I have to agree with another reviewer that ""Darker Than Black"" just didn't hook me despite my love of the genre.  It may be a result of overexposure - a ""been there, done that"" feeling.  The animation is average quality for Anime, not as spectacular as others (like Trinity Blood) but not bad by any means.  The premise IS interesting, but I prefer character development over mythology, which is where this anime failed to catch me.The concept of stars being associated with the contractors was original, and anime is known for having convoluted and intense mythology. I like that - when it is spread over the series.  But with only five episodes on the disc I received, nearly all that time was spent in exposition.  We have our anti-hero, Hei, but we don't really get anything about him until the last episode on the disc.  I'm not usually one to abandon a series before getting to the heart, but anime is not cheap.  Each DVD in this series retails for $30 for about 2 hours of running time.  That's not outrageous for a film where you get the entire story in one sitting, but this is more like television and six volumes carries a hefty price to get what amounts to a first season.Overall, were this on TV or given to me as a gift, I would keep watching.  I'd recommend this for fans of anime, or those who can't get enough ""mutants.""  But, casual fans may want to consider Netflix!I would love to comment on the quality of this ""starter set.""  But, I didn't get it.  Amazon Vine sent only the regular DVD of volume 1, without the collector box the starter set should come with.

Its very original and has so many positives and things that dries anime fans wild. Like the action is nicely fitted throughout the first episodes. Before I go in too deep let me tell you what it's all about.Darker Than Black is about a foreign exchange student named Hei. He moved into Tokyo, a city where the glittering lights in the sky are artificial stars and there are sky scraping walls surrounding the perimeter. These walls are known as ""Hell's Gate"". Hei is a contractor, one who has supernatural psychic abilities. He tends to use more technique than actual weapons and the weapons he does use sometimes are not visible to his opponent. Together with In, the duo fight opposing contractors to discover what exactly Hell's Gate is.What I love the most about ""DTB"" is that it is its own anime and doesn't seem to be following any other story or animation style. The characters are original and good and deep enough to make you take interest in them which is a very important part that some series lack. The animation is clean and crisp, extremely good work on the action scenes and decent voice actors.

1187881,ADTUS88NFTW23,B001F2U72S,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[1, 2]","I'll preface this review by saying that I'm a harsh judge of anime.  I'm a huge animation fan, therefore I have very discriminating tastes.The plot:  ""Darker than Black"" takes place in a time where a ""Hell's Gate"" has appeared in Tokyo and replaces all the real stars in the sky with fake stars.  At the same time a group of people called ""Contractors"" appear, who are killers that receive special powers in exchange for some form of payment (broken fingers, smoking, drinking, lining up stones, etc.).  The main plot focuses on a contractor, Hei, and his group known as a Syndicate.  Their motives are not made entirely clear on this first disc (are they ""good"" or ""bad"", etc.), but the last episode ends revealing why Hei is so motivated (which I won't spoil here).The execution: The story is an interesting idea, but I feel it is poorly executed.  The plot is presented convoluted and all over the place.  Plot points appear out of nowhere, and character relations are never really explored in detail.  I will give the series a little slack, because the first disc of a series is always the weakest.  That being said, the story didn't interest me enough to make me hang around and see if it gets better.  I only watched the Japanese version, so I don't know how the English cast was.The animation: Very middle of the road.  About half of the action takes place off screen.  The backgrounds were nice, but I hated the character designs.  They were very generic, and there was not much individuality in them.  Some of the characters looked more like ""Americanized Amine"" rather than ""Anime"" (i.e. bland, simple drawings).  In some scenes you can even see the poorly drawn lines made by a computer rather than a pen or paint brush.  Basically, the animation has a low-budget feel.Overall: I thought the show was o.k.  Maybe the story gets better in future episodes, but I didn't find myself drawn in enough to want to find out.  There is a lot originality and potential in the plot, but the animation and execution were generic enough that after a while I didn't really care.

I can recall an early Superman comic from way back where that was the story over several issues. But humans as creepy as the ones in Darker Than Black, the kind of dark and disturbing characters that haunt your dreams after you've just watched them on a DVD, that is just different enough to be interesting. The plot is a take-off on the 1960s film The Assasination Bureau in which an organization performs murders for hire. The twist, of course, is that these are intent on sowing fear and chaos on a vulnerable and complacent Earth.

Lohrke,"[0, 0]","coming in to 'darker than black,' the bulk of my previous anime experience consisted of robotech, and, well, robotech.  in other words, i don't really know much about it.  i've always been fascinated with anime, but i've never jumped into the genre with both feet.  however, after watching the first five episodes of 'darker than black,' i fear i may have a brand new hobby.like most good tv series, 'darker than black' does a great job at establishing its own mythology very early on without revealing too much too soon.  it's a bit of puzzle to figure out, make no mistake, but not so confusing as to take away from any of the enjoyment of watching.  during the first couple episodes we want to know what, exactly, are contractors?  what's a moratorium? what's a doll? what's hell's gate? what's heaven's gate? why do stars fall from the night sky? what's up with the obsessive compulsive disorders?  why is the cat talking?  'darker than black' takes seemingly every day occurrences [minus the talking cat] and turns them on their heads, and usually very effectively.despite what some others have said, i personally found the artwork beautiful to look at on my 46"" samsung lcd [ps3's do an admirable job upconverting]. the use of unconventional angles and views adds to the tone and paranoia of the show.  the characters, too, are very interesting--especially the principle anti-hero.  who is this guy? is he a good guy? a bad guy? what's his motive? he's a tough one to get a grip on, but that makes him all the more compelling.  to it's credit, 'darker than black' throw traditional gender roles out the window.  dolls can be male or female, as are contractors.  the head of police team investigating contractors is a woman--a sexy one, for sure--but a woman nonetheless.  sure, there are the typical stereotypes, but i think that's more to do with the genre than any lazy character development.  but most importantly, the characters are anchored in genuine emotion and suffer real moral dilemmas.i think the biggest compliment one can pay a tv series, anime or otherwise, is that it brings back for more. i, for one, will definitely be back for more.  after all, who wouldn't want to know what's darker than black?  i just hope it doesn't bust my bank.",4,"intriguing premise, plenty of potential",1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,2258,"['coming', ""'darker"", 'black', 'bulk', 'previous', 'anime', 'experience', 'consisted', 'robotech', 'well', 'robotech', 'other', 'words', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'i', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'anime', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'jumped', 'genre', 'feet', 'however', 'watching', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', ""'darker"", 'black', 'i', 'fear', 'i', 'may', 'have', 'brand', 'new', 'hobby.like', 'most', 'good', 'tv', 'series', ""'darker"", 'black', 'great', 'job', 'establishing', 'own', 'mythology', 'very', 'early', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'bit', 'puzzle', 'figure', 'out', 'make', 'mistake', 'not', 'so', 'confusing', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'first', 'couple', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'are', 'contractors', 'what', 'moratorium', 'what', 'doll', 'what', 'hell', 'gate', 'what', 'heaven', 'gate', 'why', 'do', 'stars', 'fall', 'night', 'sky', 'what', 'up', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorders', 'why', 'cat', 'talking', ""'darker"", 'black', 'seemingly', 'day', '[', 'talking', 'cat', ']', 'heads', 'usually', 'very', 'effectively.despite', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'i', 'personally', 'found', 'artwork', 'beautiful', 'look', '46', 'samsung', 'lcd', '[', 'ps3', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'upconverting', ']', 'use', 'unconventional', 'angles', 'views', 'tone', 'paranoia', 'show', 'characters', 'too', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'especially', 'principle', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'what', 'motive', 'tough', 'one', 'get', 'grip', 'more', 'compelling', 'credit', ""'darker"", 'black', 'throw', 'traditional', 'gender', 'roles', 'out', 'window', 'dolls', 'can', 'be', 'male', 'female', 'are', 'contractors', 'head', 'police', 'team', 'investigating', 'contractors', 'woman', 'sexy', 'one', 'sure', 'woman', 'nonetheless', 'sure', 'are', 'typical', 'stereotypes', 'i', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'genre', 'lazy', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'importantly', 'characters', 'are', 'anchored', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'suffer', 'real', 'moral', 'dilemmas.i', 'think', 'biggest', 'compliment', 'one', 'can', 'pay', 'tv', 'series', 'anime', 'otherwise', 'back', 'more', 'i', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'back', 'more', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'darker', 'black', 'i', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", 'bust', 'bank']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set
1187884,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B001F2U72S,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","Okay, so I went into ""Darker Than Black"" knowing nothing about it except that it had a cool title. Also, though I was supposed to receive the ""Starter Set"", which I assume is the first, single disc DVD volume and a special DVD case to hold it as well as further volumes, I only received the DVD. This is probably more an issue for Vine reviewers such as myself and not likely to happen to someone ordering the starter set, but back to the subject at hand. There were 5 episodes on the volume one disc. The first four episodes make up two 2-part plotlines in the bigger story, and the final episode included is a ""part 1"". So, I assume every two episodes of this show go together to make one bigger episode.To give a bit of background, I'm a big animation fan, though I'm more of a Disney guy than anything, but I like to dabble a bit in Anime because of the more mature stories and everything else, and because they draw very attractive females. ""Darker Than Black"" has both of those qualities. However, going into the first episode, it is very confusing, and after having watched the first 5 eps, not too much has been revealed to me. Bottom-line, after watching volume 1, ""Darker Than Black is a visually impressive show with good acting and all that, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of it, but I can't say it is a must-see for me. Just an ""I wouldn't mind seeing more"" kinda thing. Basically, it's set in a mysteriously disturbing future in which strange people called ""Contractors"" exist. They have supernatural powers, and each star in the sky represents a contract. A falling star means one has died. These stars are not the ""real stars"". Those no longer exist. After 5 episodes, I still really don't know what happened to the real stars or what the connection is with the Contractors and the new stars, nor what the Contractors really are (I hear they are aliens, but if this was stated in the first five episodes, then I totally missed it). Most of the Contractors, or many at least, seem to be hired assassins and other criminal types, and after they use their powers (which vary, like in X-Men or something), they have to perform some strange task different to each of them. The show follows one in particular, as well as some cops trying to... well, I don't know really, because I really don't get anyone's motivations for anything in the show so far, and there aren't any clear ""good guys"" I can tell, unless you count the cops, but, again, I've only seen the first 5 eps. This seems like a show that wants to reveal things to you slowly. That's okay as long as things DO get revealed, and it seems like the show does make progress with this, but not as much as I would have liked or enough to get me majorly hooked.The DVD contains both the original Japanese language version with option of English subtitles and the English dubbed version. I watched the dubbed version. Perhaps I would have gotten more info from the Japanese version in terms of what the heck was going on. I will try that out lately. With the dubbed versions though, while I know they are supposed to be inferior, I don't have to read so I can enjoy the visuals more fully as well. So, I'm glad that was an option. The DVD also includes a fun audio commentary on one episode with 2 of the English dub voice actors, an art gallery that provides some good info on the characters and settings (not enough, but fair warning that it reveals the pretty obvious identity of who the ""Black Reaper"" is), audio auditions of the English voice cast, textless video of the 2 songs from the show, and a big selection of trailers for this and other shows. Do I recommend this volume 1 release of ""Darker Than Black""? Well, I'm not really one to recommend volume releases with just 1 disc and a handful of episodes. Shows should be released in complete seasons at the very least. But, if you don't mind that, it's a decent presentation with nice extras. The show itself has potential but needs more relatable, regular characters for the audience than anyone I saw in the first five episodes. I didn't get fully hooked after 5 episodes by any means, though I wouldn't be opposed to giving it a bit more of a chance, but I'd want more explained to me than what I got from the first 5 episodes.

Since Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate opened, strange things have happened, including that now there are people with special powers (levitation, fire, etc). These are contractors. There are also mediums called dolls. Some work for the different governments, other for covert groups.The premise is interesting and the specifics even more so. There are ""fake"" stars in the sky that correspond to each contractor, and every time a contractor dies, a star falls. Contractors are mostly assassins since they seem to lack a conscience.The series is based primarily on one of the contractors, an exchange student from China. He is a mystery and we know very little about him except for his power (produces electricity), that he has a sister, and who he works for (kinda).But, the series is very confusing. After establishing the main universe, the idea of contractors and the abnormalities that go on, the story reveals very little else.

1187887,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,B001F2U72S,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[4, 4]","As a kid, I grew up enjoying old school anime classics such as""Speed Racer"",""Star Blazers""&""Battle of the Planets"".  Since then I haven't really watched any of the more recent incarnations that have come along.  So watching ""Darker Than Black"" for the first time was a real treat for me.Part traditional action/drama combined with Sci-Fi elements, Asian mysticism, and other key ingredients, ""Darker Than Black"" tells the story of Hei, a mild mannered Chinese foreign exchange student by day, who also happens to be a killer new form of superhuman secret agent by night.  These agents, known as ""Contractors,"" do whatever it takes to complete their missions, and each one is gifted with a unique ability, such as electricity, teleportation, etc.  Set in a futuristic period where the world appears to be partly closed off by a mystical gate, the contractors work with an against the police and other government officials in order to get the job done.The show never fully explains the background of the characters except in small doses, keeping the audience guessing.  Is Hei a good guy or a bad guy?  Actor, Jason Liebrech, who voices the lead character, can only say that Hei is ""probably exceptionally conflicted"" with what he does.  At times you may begin to question his methods and sense of value or worth, as contractors tend to be nothing more than cold blooded assassins who will lie, cheat, steal and more in order to achieve their goals.This First Disc presented here comprises the first 5 episodes of the series, with every two episodes making up a full show (Parts 1&2).  The first two-parter, ""The Fallen Star of a Contract"" begins the series with Hei attempting to obtain top secret information with the help of a woman, named Chiaki, who may be more than she appears, along with the police hot on their tale.  The next two-parter, ""A New Star Falls in the Dawn Sky"" highlights a scientist with a peculiar daughter who is going through some very unique changes in her life, with Hei keeping a close watch.  This episode reminded me a lot of the film""Firestarter"".  The last episode on the disc, ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe"" centers around a contractor names Havoc who has forfeited her powers and has multiple government agencies vying for the opportunity to experiment on her.  The episode also introduces us to the memorable M16 agent known as November 11.  Too bad Part 2 of this episode is not included on the disc, so you don't know what happens unless you pick up the Volume 2 DVD.Extras include:""Audio Commentary"" on Episode 2, ""The Fallen Star of a Contract Part 2"" with voice actors Jason Liebrich (Hei) & Colleen Clinkenbeard (Chiaki), who provide some interesting tidbits about the show, here and there, but mostly go on and on about how great they think the series is in general, with some fun sexual tension between the two to boot.""Cast Auditions"" - audio snippets of 11 different cast members auditioning for their parts.  Each one lasts less than a minute.""Production Artwork"" - included art and character bios for 13 characters as well as some info on the different settings that take place throughout the show.""Textless Songs"" - both the opening theme, ""Howling,"" (by Abingdon Boys School), & closing track, ""Tsukiakari"" (sung by Rie Fu) shown without any credits on the screen.""Trailers"" - 9 trailers for other anime shows are features, including Volume 2 of ""Darker Than Black.""This is a really cool Anime series, with fine acting, cool effects, great fight scenes,  & impressive anime visuals.  The show also references many other famous movies and TV series, from""Blade Runner""and""Men In Black""to""Black Mask""andKung Fuwhich makes watching it even more extra special. (I'm still not sure about the talking cat though) The best bonus is that the original Japanese audio is included (along with the English dubbed version) with English subtitles, so you can experience the show the way it was originally presented.  In many cases I noticed certain improvements with a few characters like Detective Misaki Kirthara, who just seemed more convincing when heard in Japanese.  The biggest disappointment, however, is that this Disc 1 is incomplete, missing the 2nd part of ""Red Giant over Eastern Europe.""  I don't see why 6 or even 8 episodes couldn't have been included on the disc instead of just 5, making the series very expensive to collect.  And besides Volume 2, later Volumes 3-6 all only contain 4 episodes each and are all very pricey.  So as impressive as the show is, one would hope that a cheaper complete boxset collection would come out at a more affordable price.  That would be the only main reason not to check it out.""Darker Than Black"" Volume 1Color 120 Mins Rated TVMAEnglish 5.1 Dolby SurroundJapanese StereoEnglish Subtitles16:9 Widescreen (1.77:1)Also

1187888,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001F2U72S,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","Darker than Black feels more like shades of gray - it's a moderately entertaining but highly derivative and uneven set of episodes introducing a world that is not quite ours but that feels familiar enough because it draws upon so many pop-cultural references.  It's a bit like Blade Runner - in its question whether unnatural beings with special powers that elevate them above humans can have souls - it's a bit like the Matrix - in its suggestion that the world we accept as real is really a carefully controlled illusion run by the powers that be - it's a bit like Heroes (and like all the many other superhero and comic fantasies that is based on) in its suggestion that ordinary people could have powers that make them unique.  It takes all those references and then tries to mix in a goth sensibility (the song that opens each episode and the poems are designed to appeal to angsty teenagers - who invest their anger at the mundane circumstances of their lives with a kind of profound significance -- I know, I was once there too ...).  At the same time it throws in very sweet and sentimental moments, as in the closing credits when a beautiful song plays while a sad blonde sits in the water and flowers tremble gently in the breeze.The story is enough to keep you intrigued and the episodes are short enough not to get boring.  The basic story, as far as I can tell from this first disk (not enough to convince me to keep going with the next disk), is that in a futuristic world there was some kind of cataclysmic event that turned some people into ""contractors"" - beings with special powers, who are mostly without conscience, who must pay for each use of their power with some kind of bizarre penance (breaking a finger, forming a pattern with little rocks, singing a song....).  There is an agency that wants to keep this hidden from the public.  Then there are some other kinds of beings called ""specters"" who want...I'm not sure what they want.One group of these contractors has a special mission to ... I'm not sure what they are trying to do but they are working together against the agents and against other bad agencies.  The leader of this group looks like a college student, but is really a superpowered contractor who can control electricity, I guess, and has a talking cat as a friend and a lady who can telepathically link to situations through water and a morose short balding guy who gives them both advice that they rarely listen to ... anyhow they have various missions which usually involve the handsome leader of this group befriending some innocent girl who knows something and pretending he's an ordinary guy but getting information from them.  He always seems to end up caring about this girl and trying to save her but it is usually too late.It's intriguing and kind of bizarre.  The music is very odd.  Strange jazz music starts playing in the background during a seemingly ordinary conversation between agents.  Bizarrely sweet music blares during a violent scene...the animation is decent, but feels very much like a TV show (which it is).  I might watch a few more episodes if they were on TV but I'm not captivated enough after 5 episodes (on this first disc) to bother buying another set.",3,More like shades of gray...,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,3226,"['Darker', 'Black', 'more', 'shades', 'gray', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'derivative', 'uneven', 'set', 'episodes', 'introducing', 'world', 'not', 'quite', 'ours', 'familiar', 'enough', 'so', 'many', 'pop-cultural', 'references', 'bit', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'question', 'unnatural', 'beings', 'special', 'powers', 'elevate', 'humans', 'can', 'have', 'souls', 'bit', 'Matrix', 'suggestion', 'world', 'accept', 'real', 'really', 'carefully', 'controlled', 'illusion', 'run', 'powers', 'be', 'bit', 'Heroes', 'many', 'other', 'superhero', 'comic', 'fantasies', 'based', 'suggestion', 'ordinary', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'powers', 'make', 'unique', 'references', 'then', 'tries', 'mix', 'goth', 'sensibility', 'song', 'episode', 'poems', 'are', 'designed', 'appeal', 'angsty', 'teenagers', 'who', 'invest', 'anger', 'mundane', 'circumstances', 'lives', 'kind', 'profound', 'significance', 'know', 'was', 'once', 'there', 'too', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'closing', 'credits', 'when', 'beautiful', 'song', 'plays', 'sad', 'blonde', 'sits', 'water', 'flowers', 'tremble', 'gently', 'breeze.The', 'story', 'enough', 'keep', 'intrigued', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', 'enough', 'not', 'get', 'boring', 'basic', 'story', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'first', 'disk', 'not', 'enough', 'convince', 'keep', 'going', 'next', 'disk', 'futuristic', 'world', 'was', 'kind', 'cataclysmic', 'event', 'turned', 'people', 'contractors', 'beings', 'special', 'powers', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'conscience', 'who', 'must', 'pay', 'use', 'power', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'penance', 'breaking', 'finger', 'forming', 'pattern', 'little', 'rocks', 'singing', 'song', 'agency', 'keep', 'hidden', 'public', 'Then', 'are', 'other', 'kinds', 'beings', 'called', 'specters', 'who', 'want', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'want.One', 'group', 'contractors', 'special', 'mission', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'are', 'working', 'together', 'agents', 'other', 'bad', 'agencies', 'leader', 'group', 'college', 'student', 'really', 'superpowered', 'contractor', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'electricity', 'guess', 'talking', 'cat', 'friend', 'lady', 'who', 'can', 'telepathically', 'link', 'situations', 'water', 'morose', 'short', 'balding', 'guy', 'who', 'advice', 'rarely', 'listen', 'anyhow', 'have', 'various', 'missions', 'usually', 'involve', 'handsome', 'leader', 'group', 'befriending', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'something', 'pretending', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'getting', 'information', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'girl', 'trying', 'save', 'usually', 'too', 'late.It', 'intriguing', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'music', 'very', 'odd', 'Strange', 'jazz', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'conversation', 'agents', 'Bizarrely', 'sweet', 'music', 'blares', 'violent', 'scene', 'animation', 'decent', 'very', 'much', 'TV', 'show', 'might', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'TV', ""'m"", 'not', 'captivated', 'enough', '5', 'episodes', 'first', 'disc', 'bother', 'buying', 'set']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set

Reynolds,"[1, 8]","Well, I do consider films like HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, TOKYO GODFATHERS, and WOLF BRIGADE as outstanding, but basically, I'm not into the genre, and so those like myself will get more out of this review than will fans of the genre.I've watched the first several episodes and actually enjoyed them, but just don't consider this as anything special as far as super-powered heroes and heroines go.  Elements such as the talking cat (although I like cats) seem a bit much to me.Anyway, I found the concept interesting. It was god for comic book type action although the characters just didn't come across as real for me.  I was a bit impressed with the city backdrops which gave me a bit of a feel for modern day Tokyo.  Overall, though, the basic anime style just isn't my cup of tea, and while I found this more enjoyable than some of the genre I've seen, this is something I'd watch only when there's little else to watch.  I rather liked what I saw, but just didn't have sufficient interest to make any effort to watch the rest of the series.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[0, 0]","I'm hardly a ""fan"" of this genre but I ordered it through the Amazon Vine program and so maybe I'll have something different to say about this DVD than others who are really into it -- in other words, mine is a ""basic"" review for people who know nothing of this series.First, the advertising of ""Starter Set"" is very misleading because this is only a single DVD (125 minutes, 5 episodes) in a regular DVD case. I was surprised when I unpacked it from the Amazon box because the picture looks like a set of multiple DVDs. So be prepared for that.This is a Japanese, animated, futuristic, sci-fi ""cartoon"" of sorts, clearly New Age stuff. This is the ""English Version"" where all the youthful principals have big eyes and plump ""V"" faces while the older male characters all have lantern jaws. The dialogue is in English and the soundtrack is what I would call ""Heavy Metal Lite"" (maybe akin to the band Soundgarden).There is plenty of shooting and stabbing of various foes decimating one another so these are not cartoons for the kiddies. There is also some mild cursing (""Dammit!!!""). No, these animations are for teens and adults who refuse to grow up (like me -- I still occasionally watch the Mickey Mouse Club from my own youth). The film conveys an interesting mix of cultures, a dichotomy really, since the cop cars have Japanese characters on the doors but the restaurant signage exhibits English letters. The characters speak an odd mix of Columbus, Ohio and New York, New York English.The story is difficult for newbies to follow but it's essentially this: Good Guys versus Bad Guys and the cops are chiefly Good Guys too... three factions. ""Contractors,"" all of whom have weird superhuman powers, are out snuffing a lot of folks to obtain information in a walled futuristic city. There are also ""Dolls"" in play here which are temporary androids of a sort. It's all somewhat confusing but there's quite a lot of action. If it were not animated, most adults would say that the script gives rise to ""bad acting.""Still, it was something different to watch and I mildly enjoyed it. I'm certain that there exists an entire cult of viewers who have websites about this series and who know every detail of every character. While I'm not one of those folks I can say that the animation is well-done and the picture quality (full-screen) is superb.",4,Something different to watch,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2346,"[""'m"", 'hardly', 'fan', 'genre', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'so', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'something', 'different', 'say', 'DVD', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'other', 'words', 'mine', 'basic', 'review', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'series.First', 'advertising', 'Starter', 'Set', 'very', 'misleading', 'only', 'single', 'DVD', '125', 'minutes', '5', 'episodes', 'regular', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'unpacked', 'Amazon', 'box', 'picture', 'set', 'multiple', 'DVDs', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'that.This', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'futuristic', 'sci-fi', 'cartoon', 'sorts', 'clearly', 'New', 'Age', 'stuff', 'English', 'Version', 'where', 'youthful', 'principals', 'have', 'big', 'eyes', 'plump', 'V', 'older', 'male', 'characters', 'have', 'lantern', 'jaws', 'dialogue', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Lite', 'maybe', 'band', 'Soundgarden', 'plenty', 'shooting', 'stabbing', 'various', 'foes', 'decimating', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'cartoons', 'kiddies', 'also', 'mild', 'cursing', 'Dammit', 'No', 'animations', 'are', 'teens', 'adults', 'who', 'refuse', 'grow', 'up', 'still', 'occasionally', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'own', 'youth', 'film', 'conveys', 'interesting', 'mix', 'cultures', 'dichotomy', 'really', 'cop', 'cars', 'have', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'doors', 'restaurant', 'signage', 'English', 'letters', 'characters', 'speak', 'odd', 'mix', 'Columbus', 'Ohio', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'English.The', 'story', 'difficult', 'newbies', 'follow', 'essentially', 'Good', 'Guys', 'versus', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'cops', 'are', 'chiefly', 'Good', 'Guys', 'too', 'three', 'factions', 'Contractors', 'whom', 'have', 'weird', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'are', 'out', 'snuffing', 'lot', 'folks', 'obtain', 'information', 'walled', 'futuristic', 'city', 'are', 'also', 'Dolls', 'play', 'here', 'are', 'temporary', 'androids', 'sort', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'quite', 'lot', 'action', 'were', 'not', 'animated', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'say', 'script', 'rise', 'bad', 'acting', 'Still', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'watch', 'mildly', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'certain', 'entire', 'cult', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'websites', 'series', 'who', 'know', 'detail', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'folks', 'can', 'say', 'animation', 'well-done', 'picture', 'quality', 'full-screen', 'superb']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set

By the end of the DVD, viewers will still be saying, ""What is going on?"" but they'll have watched something visually interesting as well.The show has no real anchor, nor is anything ever explained in detail. I don't know if this is due to translation problems and bad cuts, but it is annoying. Sadly, I didn't find myself caring if the good contractors or the bad contractors succeeded, because it didn't seem to make a difference in any way.As an interesting note, Yoko Kanno does the music for Darker Than Black.

The people built a huge wall to separate Tokyo from this place. Weeks after this happened, people with special abilities appeared, known as `contractors' they have powers and abilities that are used for espionage and similar tasks (including murder)The show follows a team formed by Mao (a contractor trapped in the body of a cat), Huang, Yin (a blind girl catalogued as a ""Doll"" with abilities to locate people but emotionless) and the protagonist, Hei. As the series develop it interesting to follow the story and the traits of the characters that appear in it, yes, they do have abilities but they have to pay a price for using them, the price will usually be an odd activity for the contractor to perform (such as break his own fingers)Episodes included are:""The Star of a Contract Fell...

1187896,APPCJX62WKIIP,B001F2U72S,"Satia Renee ""Satia Renee""","[0, 0]","The following review is solely based upon episodes 1 through 5.  Darker Than Black is a dark, sometimes violent, and potentially enigmatic addition to the ever burgeoning anime library.  In the first episode, the foundation is laid with the introduction of a young man, a student who is renting an apartment to a seemingly shy and obviously mysterious young woman.  It soon becomes apparent that both have secrets, a past that is about to complicate their present lives.  For the young man, his life turns upside down when, one night while looking at the stars through a telescope, the young woman literally runs into him and he rescues her from the two men who are pursuing her.When he later rescues her again, his role as her hero seems sealed but by episode two of this predictable plot point turns everything on its heel and the reason that the two have met becomes less obvious.To try to explain the world in which this story takes place without having seen more than five episodes is not easy.  Apparently there's a Gate and only one person has ever been to the other side and survived.  Since the Gate's manifestation, the sky above Tokyo is no longer real.  The stars fall when a Contractor dies, which is not necessarily a bad thing because apparently Contractors kill with impunity, having no sense of remorse.  For every false star in the sky, there is a Contractor walking on Earth, hired to kill and even hunting one another down.  But not all Contractors are working outside of the law because some work within their government's control.Confused?  I haven't even mentioned the Dolls, Moratoria, or Regressors.As each episode begins, a new layer of the mythos in which this reality is determined is exposed.  The audience is given just a little more detail to keep the interest high and the curiosity higher.  For every question one begins to answer, at least five more are introduced.  This anime is for a more mature audience, one not still suckling on the likes of Yugi-oh or Sailor Moon.  Not as intense as some anime, it is clearly designed for an audience that has some sophistication and patience, a willingness to commit to allowing the story, and the characters, to reveal themselves.",3,Very Good (Only based on the first five episodes),1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2207,"['following', 'review', 'solely', 'based', 'episodes', '1', '5', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'dark', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'potentially', 'enigmatic', 'addition', 'ever', 'burgeoning', 'anime', 'library', 'first', 'episode', 'foundation', 'laid', 'introduction', 'young', 'man', 'student', 'who', 'renting', 'apartment', 'seemingly', 'shy', 'obviously', 'mysterious', 'young', 'woman', 'soon', 'apparent', 'have', 'secrets', 'past', 'complicate', 'present', 'lives', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'one', 'night', 'looking', 'stars', 'telescope', 'young', 'woman', 'literally', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'pursuing', 'her.When', 'later', 'again', 'role', 'hero', 'sealed', 'episode', 'two', 'predictable', 'plot', 'point', 'everything', 'heel', 'reason', 'two', 'have', 'met', 'becomes', 'less', 'obvious.To', 'try', 'explain', 'world', 'story', 'place', 'having', 'seen', 'more', 'five', 'episodes', 'not', 'easy', 'Apparently', 'Gate', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'ever', 'been', 'other', 'side', 'survived', 'Gate', 'manifestation', 'sky', 'Tokyo', 'no', 'longer', 'real', 'stars', 'fall', 'when', 'Contractor', 'dies', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'apparently', 'Contractors', 'kill', 'impunity', 'having', 'sense', 'remorse', 'false', 'star', 'sky', 'Contractor', 'walking', 'Earth', 'hired', 'kill', 'even', 'hunting', 'one', 'down', 'not', 'Contractors', 'are', 'working', 'law', 'work', 'government', 'control.Confused', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'Dolls', 'Moratoria', 'Regressors.As', 'episode', 'new', 'layer', 'mythos', 'reality', 'determined', 'exposed', 'audience', 'given', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'keep', 'interest', 'high', 'curiosity', 'higher', 'question', 'one', 'answer', 'least', 'five', 'more', 'are', 'introduced', 'anime', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'one', 'not', 'still', 'suckling', 'likes', 'Yugi-oh', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Not', 'as', 'intense', 'anime', 'clearly', 'designed', 'audience', 'sophistication', 'patience', 'willingness', 'commit', 'allowing', 'story', 'characters', 'reveal']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set

Hei, the protagonist is a gentle-seeming student, but he seems to kill mysteriously and without qualm.The character design wasn't bad, but it didn't really excite me.

I found the first three episodes to be almost impenetrable, as I didn't know what was going on and they weren't telling me.  With this said, I still enjoyed the episodes.The pace is sometimes pretty slow, but action scenes appear frequently enough to keep it interesting.  The animation style seems to be pretty typical for Japanese animation; nothing new here.About the storyFrom what I can tell, something happened about 10 years before the first episode:1. All the stars in the sky were replaced with false stars.2. A strange area called Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo.3. Evil (?) creatures called contractors, dolls, and moratoriums appear.  These creatures have super powers and can cause tremendous damage.4. A government agency tracks and attempts to kill/capture the creatures in point 3.5. The government erases the memory of anyone who has had contact with the creatures in point 3.6.

1187899,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001F2U72S,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","Working with a better than average storyline, ""Darker Than Black"" is a cool science-fiction anime that pits Dolls against Contractors while both are pursued by the Police. Li Shengshun is the main Contractor, a college student kind of guy who is also a conscious less killer...or is he?Li operates with a high-level group of assassins inside a future Tokyo. There was some sort of cataclysmic event that forced the city to be walled off, and the stars and planets replaced by false ones. When the false stars appear or disappear, it's the sign of birth or passing of a Contractor. No-one can come in or out, and the civilians are kept in the dark about Doll/Contractor existence by the Police.For an Anime, this is pretty ambitious. There are no fairies or sword-warriors running about and no cutesie mascots (save for a Black Cat agent named Mao). ""Darker Than Black"" is adult anime (but not pornography) with a decent backstory (the second episode toys with an explorer who survived an expedition - I think - beyond the gate).

1187900,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,B001F2U72S,Timothy B. Riley,"[0, 0]","When I received these first five episodes I was intrigued. The first thing that I noticed was that the animation is just so-so. It seems to be your standard Japanese anime style (if there is one) and not the best example of the art. I know that there are much more stylish examples out there.  However, the story was so compelling and mysterious that I found the rest of the series (episodes 6-25) in Japanese with English sub-titles.After watching them all I have to say that I was very disappointed.  What started out as a dark fantasy story deteriorated into a silly cartoon.  The private detective and his assistant (I believe that they showed up around episode six and reappeared in almost all of the remaining stories) are a prime example of this, with over exaggerated facial expressions and comic reactions.  Some of the story lines were still compelling but others were not.  I watched them with my 28 year old son who is a big fan of anime and had just returned from a one and a half year teaching position in Chiba, Japan.  He agreed with me that it seemed like the writers and/or producers of the first 5 episodes were different than those that made the rest of the series.  We both could be wrong but that was our best guess.Obviously made for Japanese television the episodes are very short and the credits take up way too much time.  Although the story held promise to be interesting in the beginning, the finale was did not live up to those expectations.  Still, I am glad that I watched it, I just wouldn't recommend spending the kind of money that the entire series will cost in the end.",3,Started off being interesting but eventually let me down.,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1605,"['When', 'received', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'was', 'intrigued', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'animation', 'just', 'so-so', 'be', 'standard', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'style', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'example', 'art', 'know', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'stylish', 'examples', 'there', 'However', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'compelling', 'mysterious', 'found', 'rest', 'series', '6-25', 'Japanese', 'English', 'sub-titles.After', 'watching', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'story', 'deteriorated', 'silly', 'cartoon', 'private', 'detective', 'assistant', 'believe', 'showed', 'up', 'episode', 'six', 'reappeared', 'almost', 'remaining', 'stories', 'are', 'prime', 'example', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'comic', 'reactions', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'still', 'compelling', 'others', 'were', 'not', 'watched', '28', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'anime', 'had', 'just', 'returned', 'one', 'half', 'year', 'teaching', 'position', 'Chiba', 'Japan', 'agreed', 'seemed', 'writers', 'and/or', 'producers', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'were', 'different', 'made', 'rest', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'was', 'best', 'guess.Obviously', 'made', 'Japanese', 'television', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'credits', 'take', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'story', 'held', 'promise', 'be', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'finale', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Still', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'spending', 'kind', 'money', 'entire', 'series', 'will', 'cost', 'end']",Darker Than Black: Starter Set

Sometimes things fly off the proverbial track and leave you with something that makes you think of how much you loved the start and how much you wish you could start over. Still, as far as an anime series goes, this was really great. It had everything I wanted and then some. It had a bit of oddity, a setting that was deep and fun to follow, and it didn't do the one thing you never want to see - it didn't leave you thinking ""i wonder if this will last.""A lot of people summarize better than I do, but I will say that I watch a lot of animated series and I really liked what i found here. It only took me one night to wathc it because it had me wanting more, actually causing me to go out and buy more of the series just to see what happens.

If you're against it, then I'd suggest you avoid this.Personally I could not find any problems with the DVD set, or character, plot faults.
