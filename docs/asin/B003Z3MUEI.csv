Ward Bond set the tone & was the father figure that was missed when he passed on. I love the music & it's the intangible things that really makes this series special..things that might not seem important, but adds historical & ironic significance to the well written stories as they unfold. The goods the wagons were carrying...things we take for granted..water, shelter for the night...how our ancestors crossed the continent in these wagons still amazes me. Clarity of picture is excellent & I have no problem with the tin the discs came in. I took other's advice & bought the 2nd season (you reviewers out there do help me make purchases..thanks). Sure brings back great memories.

1376820,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B003Z3MUEI,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","The second season of one of TV's most popular and best-loved Westerns takes up almost exactly where the first left off, as Major Seth Adams (Ward Bond) and long-time friends Bill Hawks (Terry Wilson) and Charlie Wooster (Frank McGrath), vacationing in San Francisco after their long journey west, manage to get themselves shanghaiied in &#8220;Around the Horn,&#8221; while scout Flint McCullough (Robert Horton) calmly travels overland with never a hint of their situation.  (It's notable that while Hawks is described as &#8220;a married man&#8221; in both the first and final segments of this season, we never see his wife Emily again, and by Third she's no longer mentioned at all.)  What follows is 37 further episodes of adventure and human conflict, illuminated by many noted Hollywood stars, including comic Lou Costello (of Abbott &) in his only dramatic role as a drifter far too fond of the bottle who's redeemed by his bond with a 12-year-old girl, and Bette Davis as the widowed mother of seven youngsters who suddenly learns that she's dying and must make provisions for her children's future.  There's Cliff Robertson as an Irish freedom-fighter on the trail of an informer, Jane Wyman as a lady doctor struggling to cope with social censure, Chill Wills as a one-eyed scout, James Coburn as a stagecoach robber, Sessue Hayakawa as a samurai trying to return his dead master's ashes to Japan, Virginia Mayo as a king rancher's daughter struggling to carry on as her father would have wished, Patty McCormack (&#34;The Bad Seed&#34;) as a rebellious young girl whose only chance for redemption lies with her friendship with an invalid counterpart, Anne Baxter as a dance-hall girl who takes in an orphaned Indian infant (with Henry Hull a delight as the spry oldster who becomes her greatest partisan and helper), Lloyd Nolan as a veteran gold hunter whose discovery of the precious metal threatens the entire train, Dan Duryea as the only survivor of a party that perished in a mountain winter, J. Carroll Naish as the sly father of a gang of robber brothers, Brian Donlevy as an undercover police detective, Phyllis Thaxter as a hopeful &#8220;maiden lady,&#8221; Anna Maria Alberghetti as a Comanchero's daughter, Vera Miles as a nun, Richard Anderson as a one-armed Quaker doctor who may be the only chance for a party stricken with sickness, Wally Cox as a westbound schoolteacher, Cameron Mitchell as a fugitive trying to escape his past and doing pretty well at it till he's spotted by a lawman, Robert Loggia as a Californio adopted by the Pawnee, Ann Blyth in a dual role as a maimed San Francisco singer and her daughter, and many others.  A young Dean Stockwell (of &#34;Quantum Leap&#34;) appears twice&#8212;once as a Mexican youth who witnessed his father's hanging and is out to even the score, and once as a white one who was taken in and raised by a Cheyenne exile after his parents were murdered.  So does Robert Fuller (who in the final two seasons of the series would play scout Cooper Smith), once as a recently-married young gambler who must fight to survive the snow and cold when his wife is severely injured and he has to stay behind with her while the train goes on to find a doctor, and once in a delightful small role as the 18-year-old suitor of Bette Davis's oldest daughter; and John McIntire, who would take over as Christopher Hale after Ward Bond's death, shows up as outcast preacher Andrew... Hale!  (Chris's brother?!)Continuity, as is often true of Golden Era TV Westerns, often leaves something to be desired: this season is variously said to be &#8220;six years&#8221; since the end of the war (1871), &#8220;five years&#8221; since its early stages (1866), and &#8220;ten years&#8221; since 1860.  The writers also haven't done their research about Indians, and much of the costume and culture of the red men should be taken with a large grain of salt.  And geography's a bit muddled: a wagon train crossing to California shouldn't encounter threatening snow&#8212;or the debri of a party lost in last year's&#8212;until the Sierras, but several segments focusing on that threat seem to take place in the Rockies.  Still, there's plenty of drama, excitement, romance, and&#8212;the great strength of this series&#8212;human emotion, change, and conflict, not to speak of at least one female director (Bretaigne Windust, whose name appears on several segments) and a frequent female scriptwriter (Jean Holloway), both unusual for the time and genre.  Anyone who loves Westerns of this era can't consider his DVD collection complete without a row of embossed tin arch-top boxes on his shelf.",5,Eastward and westward,1395705600,"03 25,

The friendly bickering between Major Adams, Flint McCulloch, Charlie Wooster, and Bill Hawks is a treat when it pops up in a plot. These seasoned professions play off each other with hilarious results. The picture on these Wagon Trains is crisp and bright, not like the muddy looking versions with muffled sound that aired on broadcast and cable reruns for decades. It still amazes me that with such quality, nearly 40 hour long episodes were produced per season for much of the show's run. Even the color 7th season tallied 32 expanded length ninety minute programs. Wow!

1376839,A3J748NCD4JYEK,B003Z3MUEI,Stormy Night,"[45, 45]","Wagon Train is my all time favorite TV show & I'm very pleased with the season 2 DVD set recently released by Timeless Video.The content is what really makes the set great.  Of all the seasons of Wagon Train this is the one with the most really good episodes. Some favorites are Jennifer Churchill (romantic comedy with Rhonda Fleming) , Millie Davis (tender and amusing, James Coburn as Three Fingered Ike in a small role), Steve Campden (snow, cave, saber tooth tiger), Mary Ellen Thomas (with a Christmas theme), Sister Rita (with Vera Miles), and The Last Man (with Dan Duryea). Many of these are very good ""Flint"" stories.Picture quality is excellent, revealing details about clothing and expressions that couldn't be seen on videos made from capturing the programs from TV.  Episodes tend to run 50 minutes, or as long as 50 minutes 25 seconds, with some footage not on any TV airing in recent years.My friends and I haven't noticed any imperfections in our season 2 discs (no spots where the the discs skip or hang while playing an episode.)  (Some season 1 sets did have an imperfect disc or two that would skip or hang on some DVD players.)The packaging (cardboard book holding the DVDs, packaged in a tin box), wouldn't be my first choice, but Timeless does seem to have done something to improve the cardboard book.  Removing the season 2 discs from the cardboard book is easier than it was to remove the season 1 discs from their book.  (I have chosen to keep the discs in Tyvek sleeves in a small box to get to them with less chance of scratching, but I might be being over careful.)If you liked the Wagon Train Season 1 set, you will like the Season 2 set even more.If you don't have either and can only afford one, I recommend the season 2 set. Either set is very good viewing.I hope to see seasons 3, 4, and 5 in the near future.",5,Wagon Train Season 2 Set - Terrific,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1845,"['Wagon', 'Train', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'season', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'recently', 'released', 'Timeless', 'Video.The', 'content', 'what', 'really', 'set', 'great', 'seasons', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'one', 'most', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'favorites', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Churchill', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Rhonda', 'Fleming', 'Millie', 'Davis', 'tender', 'amusing', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Three', 'Fingered', 'Ike', 'small', 'role', 'Steve', 'Campden', 'snow', 'cave', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tiger', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Thomas', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'Sister', 'Rita', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Last', 'Man', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Many', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Flint', 'stories.Picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'revealing', 'details', 'clothing', 'expressions', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'videos', 'made', 'capturing', 'programs', 'TV', 'Episodes', 'tend', 'run', '50', 'minutes', 'as', 'long', '50', 'minutes', '25', 'seconds', 'footage', 'not', 'TV', 'airing', 'recent', 'years.My', 'friends', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'imperfections', 'season', '2', 'discs', 'spots', 'where', 'discs', 'skip', 'hang', 'playing', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'sets', 'did', 'have', 'imperfect', 'disc', 'two', 'would', 'skip', 'hang', 'DVD', 'players', 'packaging', 'cardboard', 'book', 'holding', 'DVDs', 'packaged', 'tin', 'box', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'Timeless', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'improve', 'cardboard', 'book', 'Removing', 'season', '2', 'discs', 'cardboard', 'book', 'easier', 'was', 'remove', 'season', '1', 'discs', 'book', 'have', 'chosen', 'keep', 'discs', 'Tyvek', 'sleeves', 'small', 'box', 'get', 'less', 'chance', 'scratching', 'might', 'be', 'being', 'careful', 'liked', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'will', 'like', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'even', 'more.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'one', 'recommend', 'season', '2', 'set', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'viewing.I', 'hope', 'see', 'seasons', '3', '4', '5', 'near', 'future']",Wagon Train: Season 2 in a Collectible Embossed Metallic Tin!
