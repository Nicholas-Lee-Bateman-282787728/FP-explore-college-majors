I think it was the lousy acting of the compainions more than the story. &quot;No! Nyssa don't touch me, I'll disolve!&quot; kinda thing.

343920,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6302884586,Crazy Fox,"[1, 1]","I had utterly no idea what to expect with ""Castrovalva"" the first time I saw it all those years ago. For years the Doctor had been a wonderfully weird guy with curly hair, an interminable scarf, and a bizarre sense of humor. I was aware that there'd been three incarnations before him, but I'd never seen them and it was really hard to picture the Doctor as anyone else. So as ""Castrovalva"" began and with it the adventures of the fifth Doctor as played by Peter Davison, I was really wondering what would come next. Was he going to play the role much like Tom Baker did, or was he going to have an entirely different persona altogether, or somewhere in-between? What was a different Doctor going to be like? Was I still going to like the show? Well, by the end of ""Castrovalva"" I still didn't have an answer.That's of course because the Doctor's out of it for most of this storyline, slowly recovering from the physiological shock of regenerating.  As a plot device this is realistic, certainly, and a bit innovative--in prior transitions the Doctor bounced back rather more quickly from what's essentially a total death and rebirth. It's also exceedingly risky, though--having the main character, the hero no less, laying about helpless, groggy, and generally incapacitated for such a long time gets dull all too easily. And, unlike before, there aren't really any subplots to divert you during the Doctor's recovery. To Davison's credit he carries this off rather well considering, bringing some subtle drama to the Doctor's struggle to get on his own two feet and rediscover his own identity. That said, I wish someone would pay me to lay around and pretend I'm asleep so much.Clearly the writer, Christopher Bidmead, is attempting here to keep the ball rolling from ""Logopolis"" with its esoteric mathematics and sophisticated astrophysics. The idea of a pocket universe folding back in on itself in complex ways is indeed a clever one if a bit of an overkill as a trap (by the Master, which would be a spoiler if he wasn't standing in front of the Doctor himself on this DVD cover). It's delightfully surreal of course, but a bit overly ambitious given the visual effects available--the end result is somewhat abstract and confusing, and really you would have to had seen M.C. Escher's classic ""Castrovalva"" print beforehand to even make sense of what both the visual effects and dialogue are straining to get across. Basically, this is biting off more than you can chew storywise. As part and parcel of an ongoing attempt at the time to make ""Doctor Who"" more scientific it kind of rings false too, especially when earlier in the same storyline the characters embarrassingly refer to event one, the big bang, as the birth of the ""galaxy"" (rather than the universe. Oops). Still, intriguing idea in theory.This storyline doesn't get much help from stellar acting, though, I'm afraid, except for maybe Davison's brilliant evocations of prior Doctors as his identity is in flux (this was of course totally lost on me the first time). The actresses playing Nyssa and Tegan seem to be competing as to can give the flattest performance, while the actors playing the Master and Adric seem to be placing bets as to who can ham it up the most. The Castrovalvans are much better on this score, and Shardovan is a fascinating character played with just the right touch--his parting line to the Master, ""You made us, man of evil. But we are free!"" is brilliantly moving in its simplicity and philosophic suggestiveness. As for the Doctor himself, well, now that he's recovered, we'll just have to wait and see...P.S. in a strange case of review recursion, it should be mentioned that ""Castrovalva"" brings to completion plot threads from the two storylines before it, thus loosely forming a trilogy of sorts. It'll be kind of hard to figure out what's going on without that background, too, so for that reason and also for reasons of convenience and economics the box set containing all three DVDs is probably more to the fervent fan's advantage:Doctor Who - New Beginnings (The Keeper of Traken / Logopolis / Castrovalva).",4,"""Welcome aboard!

343921,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302884586,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 6]","Picture the scene:  the Fourth Doctor's dying body lying beneath the radio telescope tower of the Pharos Project, his concerned companions Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gathered around him.  He gives them a weak version of his toothy grin, and says &quot;It's the end, but the moment has been prepared for.&quot;  He merges with the Watcher, an alternate body, and lo and behold, becomes a younger man.So begins Castrovalva, the debut story of Peter Davison.  After surviving an attempt by the Master to send them back in time to Event One (the Big Bang), the girls and the Doctor journey to Castrovalva, a Dwelling of Tranquility in order to cure the Doctor's post-regenerative weakness.  However, all is not as it seems.  When they try to leave, they find themselves caught in a loop, a recursive occlusion, i.e. a space time trap.  And how do the Master and Adric, kidnapped by the former, fit in?Nyssa and Tegan's personalities emerge here.  Nyssa is calm, rational, and gentle, while Tegan is headstrong, emotional, and cynical.  Adric is also rational and intelligent, but weak-willed, as he falls under the Master's thrall.  And the Fifth Doctor is more vulnerable than his previous incarnations.  Speaking of which, Peter Davison does a good job impersonating the other Doctors during his lapses into their personality, especially Hartnell's Doctor, holding his suspenders in the same way that the First Doctor held his coat lapels:  &quot;I wonder, boy, what would you do if you were me, hmm?  Or rather, what would I do if I were me?&quot;  He even lets out the amusing hmmph.The Portreeve's stacked hat has to be seen to be believed.  There is bad make-up at work here, for in episode 3, his face is very very familiar.  The medieval costumes of the Castrovalvans are charming, especially the women's hats.  Oh yes, and the eye make-up from Robots Of Death has returned, though not with a vengeance.What also works well is the concept of the Zero Room and recursive occlusion, and the puzzle of Castrovalva.  The scene where the child teaches the Doctor that three comes after two is precious, and the way he tries to show Mergrave and Ruther that something is wrong with Castrovalva via the map Mergrave has drawn on the back of the mirror is also great.I used to be a computer science major and we had to learn recursion in my Pascal class, where as Nyssa so rightly says, procedures fall back on themselves.  A procedure for calculating factorials or Fibonacci numbers are classic examples of recursive programming.Oh, and if the Doctor wanted a place cut off from the rest of the Universe, he can come here to Farmpit, NM as well as Brisbane, Queensland.This is the second of the two John-Nathan Turner trilogies he designed for Season 18, beginning with The Keeper Of Traken, and continuing with Logopolis.  The first one was of course, the E-Space Trilogy.  Both trilogies provided links towards phasing out old characters and bringing in new.  In this case, it was goodbye to the Fourth Doctor, hello to Nyssa, Tegan, the regenerated Master, and the Fifth Doctor.Michael Sheard (the pharmacist Mergrave) has come out in other Doctor Who's, including The Mind Of Evil, Pyramids Of Mars, The Invisible Enemy, and later in Remembrance Of The Daleks, but may be best known to American audiences as the ill-fated Admiral Ozzel in The Empire Strikes Back.Castrovalva serves as a worthy introduction to Peter Davison and Season 19.
