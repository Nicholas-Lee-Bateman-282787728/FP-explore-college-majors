The regular series is awesome, but this movie is just a couple of episodes edited with the character of Miller put into them.  Not worth it all.  Unless you're just collecting everything Gundam.  Anything else just skip this one.  Nothing is really added to the story, and I say you've already seen about 90% of this movie any way.  Only 10% or less is even new!  It's just not worth it.

688866,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005Y6XE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","For 2008, I made a decision to watch every Mobile Suit Gundam release (Universal Century) released on DVD. With the film trilogy which I watched back in the early 90's, the first series I was able to purchase was ""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"".In my review, I went on and on on how much I enjoyed the overall storyline because it was more realistic and also a leadership trait I found with its main character Shiro Amada and him falling in love with Zeon pilot, Aina Sakhalin.In Japan, with the success of a television series or series in general, there tends to be a special that focuses on clips from the series. Sometimes you get additional footage and fortunately for ""MILLER'S REPORT"", you get footage covering Shiro Amada's trial as he is standing trial on being a spy for the Zeon.Alice Miller, an officer of the Federation Intelligence Division has been dispatched to find the truth of why Shiro Amada a) Let a Zeon officer go free (not once but twice) b) wWhy he did not capture the enemy mobile armor when that was his primary mission.Of the 55-minutes of the special episode, five minutes or maybe less is actual additional footage and thus, the question is whether this special is worth purchasing.Personally, for me, enjoying this series so much, not having it in my collection would seem like having a hole in the series and I would go crazy knowing that I didn't have a complete episode of ""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"".It may be a rehashing of clips from the series but the fact is that there is additional footage that has Amada explaining to Miller of why he did what he did. Footage of Alice Miller pointing a gun at Amada's head with his team watching from a distance, footage of how the Federation got to know about Amada's relationship with Aina and also footage of Eledore returning back to the 08th MS Team after recuperating from the hospital.No matter the duration of the content, the fact is that... again, it's still new and additional content not on the series.So, if you are fan of the series, then yes...I recommend it as a must-buy for your collection. But if you are a viewer on a budget, then you have to ask yourself is five minutes of additional content worth itPersonally, the series is worth it. I enjoyed this series so much that I'm happy to own this DVD. Again, if I didn't purchase this, knowing that there is a DVD (even though it features mostly video clips from the series) with new additional content, not purchasing it would make me feel I had an incomplete collection.I've read may people complaining that its Bandai's way of cashing in on the series but I never saw it that way. I've been watching Japanese entertainment for so long, from drama series to variety shows, there are special episodes showing the best of clips to rehashing of popular scenes from the series.For ""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"", the storyline did not dwelve too much on Amada's trial and what happened behind-the-scenes. This special does. Duration wise for additional footage, not as much as one would like but even for popular Japanese dramas, same situation and sometimes there are no additional footage. So, the fact that we got a little insight of what happened during his trial, I was ok with it.Since this DVD was released back in 2001, you can find ""MILLER'S REPORT"" for almost $5-$10 these days. And if you are planning to buy the collector's box set, the special comes with the box set.All in all, I recommend this to fans of this awesome series! If 5 minutes of additional content does not set well with you, then you can bypass it.",3,How much is 5-minutes worth to you?,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,3594,"['2008', 'made', 'decision', 'watch', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', 'release', 'Universal', 'Century', 'released', 'DVD', 'film', 'trilogy', 'watched', 'back', 'early', '90', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'was', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', '.In', 'review', 'went', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'storyline', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'also', 'leadership', 'trait', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'Shiro', 'Amada', 'falling', 'love', 'Zeon', 'pilot', 'Aina', 'Sakhalin.In', 'Japan', 'success', 'television', 'series', 'series', 'general', 'be', 'special', 'clips', 'series', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'additional', 'footage', 'fortunately', 'MILLER', 'REPORT', 'get', 'footage', 'covering', 'Shiro', 'Amada', 'trial', 'standing', 'trial', 'being', 'spy', 'Zeon.Alice', 'Miller', 'officer', 'Federation', 'Intelligence', 'Division', 'been', 'dispatched', 'find', 'truth', 'why', 'Shiro', 'Amada', 'Let', 'Zeon', 'officer', 'go', 'free', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'b', 'wWhy', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'enemy', 'mobile', 'armor', 'when', 'was', 'primary', 'mission.Of', '55-minutes', 'special', 'episode', 'five', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'less', 'actual', 'additional', 'footage', 'thus', 'question', 'special', 'worth', 'purchasing.Personally', 'enjoying', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'having', 'collection', 'would', 'seem', 'having', 'hole', 'series', 'would', 'go', 'crazy', 'knowing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'complete', 'episode', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', '.It', 'may', 'be', 'rehashing', 'clips', 'series', 'fact', 'additional', 'footage', 'Amada', 'explaining', 'Miller', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Footage', 'Alice', 'Miller', 'pointing', 'gun', 'Amada', 'head', 'team', 'watching', 'distance', 'footage', 'how', 'Federation', 'got', 'know', 'Amada', 'relationship', 'Aina', 'also', 'footage', 'Eledore', 'returning', 'back', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', 'recuperating', 'hospital.No', 'matter', 'duration', 'content', 'fact', 'again', 'still', 'new', 'additional', 'content', 'not', 'series.So', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'yes', 'recommend', 'must-buy', 'collection', 'are', 'viewer', 'budget', 'then', 'have', 'ask', 'five', 'minutes', 'additional', 'content', 'worth', 'itPersonally', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'happy', 'own', 'DVD', 'Again', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'knowing', 'DVD', 'even', 'mostly', 'video', 'clips', 'series', 'new', 'additional', 'content', 'not', 'purchasing', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'had', 'incomplete', 'collection.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'may', 'people', 'complaining', 'Bandai', 'way', 'cashing', 'series', 'never', 'saw', 'way', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'entertainment', 'so', 'long', 'drama', 'series', 'variety', 'shows', 'are', 'special', 'episodes', 'showing', 'best', 'clips', 'rehashing', 'popular', 'scenes', 'series.For', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', 'storyline', 'did', 'not', 'dwelve', 'too', 'much', 'Amada', 'trial', 'what', 'happened', 'behind-the-scenes', 'special', 'Duration', 'wise', 'additional', 'footage', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'even', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'dramas', 'same', 'situation', 'sometimes', 'are', 'additional', 'footage', 'So', 'fact', 'got', 'little', 'insight', 'what', 'happened', 'trial', 'was', 'ok', 'it.Since', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'back', '2001', 'can', 'find', 'MILLER', 'REPORT', 'almost', '5-', '10', 'days', 'are', 'planning', 'buy', 'collector', 'box', 'set', 'special', 'box', 'set.All', 'recommend', 'fans', 'awesome', 'series', '5', 'minutes', 'additional', 'content', 'not', 'set', 'well', 'then', 'can', 'bypass']",Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Miller's Report
688867,A3RCGGDPR2KUT8,B00005Y6XE,G White,"[3, 3]","O8th MS Team holds the honour of being the longest running Gundam OVA. Although a mere 12 episodes, it was plagued by behind-the-scenes problems that led to it taking almost 4 years to reach it's end. To try and gain some interest into the drawn out affair, Bandai produced a movie to tie in with Gundam's 20th anniversary. Thus, Miller's Report was born.Largely made up from OVA footage, the movie adds a plot of the Federation sending one Alice Miller to investigate Shiro, who at this point is believed to be a Zeon spy. Although initially acting as Shiro's friend, we soon learn that this is a trick to get him to talk openly about his encounters with Aina. These flashbacks are made up of re-used footage from the OVA. However, the scenes are told from Shiro's point of view so you'll miss out on some scenes from the OVA. As Shiro is confined to base, a group of Zeon pilots end up coming to Kiki's village for food. Although they intend not to bring violence, the youngest of the Zeon is an arrogant jerk who soon starts a conflict. Word reaches the 08th MS Team, who go against orders to save their friends.Some other reviews call this a waste of time and a desperate attempt to get more money from the fans. Whilst this is partly true, I believe the DVD is worth a purchase for Gundam/08th MS Team fans. Bandai have not brought over the similar but much worse 0083 compilation movie. Miller's Report shines where that fails, showing that this is the right way to handle such a project. There's also the very good extra of all the animation footage from the game Journey to Jaburo. Whilst you might expect a trailer or two, Bandai have been generous to include all the footage from the game. The only complaint I have with this is that you can only listen to it with the English cast.Whilst not the greatest Gundam movie, 08th MS Team:Miller's Report certainly isn't the worst.",3,An interesting report?,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,1885,"['O8th', 'MS', 'Team', 'honour', 'being', 'longest', 'running', 'Gundam', 'OVA', 'mere', '12', 'episodes', 'was', 'plagued', 'behind-the-scenes', 'problems', 'led', 'taking', 'almost', '4', 'years', 'reach', 'end', 'try', 'gain', 'interest', 'drawn', 'affair', 'Bandai', 'produced', 'movie', 'tie', 'Gundam', '20th', 'anniversary', 'Thus', 'Miller', 'Report', 'was', 'born.Largely', 'made', 'up', 'OVA', 'footage', 'movie', 'plot', 'Federation', 'sending', 'one', 'Alice', 'Miller', 'investigate', 'Shiro', 'who', 'point', 'believed', 'be', 'Zeon', 'spy', 'initially', 'acting', 'Shiro', 'friend', 'soon', 'learn', 'trick', 'get', 'talk', 'openly', 'encounters', 'Aina', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'made', 're-used', 'footage', 'OVA', 'However', 'scenes', 'are', 'told', 'Shiro', 'point', 'view', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', 'scenes', 'OVA', 'Shiro', 'confined', 'base', 'group', 'Zeon', 'pilots', 'end', 'up', 'coming', 'Kiki', 'village', 'food', 'intend', 'not', 'bring', 'violence', 'youngest', 'Zeon', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'who', 'soon', 'conflict', 'Word', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', 'who', 'go', 'orders', 'save', 'friends.Some', 'other', 'call', 'waste', 'time', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'fans', 'Whilst', 'partly', 'true', 'believe', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'Gundam/08th', 'MS', 'Team', 'fans', 'Bandai', 'have', 'not', 'brought', 'over', 'similar', 'much', 'worse', '0083', 'compilation', 'movie', 'Miller', 'Report', 'where', 'showing', 'right', 'way', 'handle', 'project', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'extra', 'animation', 'footage', 'game', 'Journey', 'Jaburo', 'Whilst', 'might', 'expect', 'trailer', 'two', 'Bandai', 'have', 'been', 'generous', 'include', 'footage', 'game', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'can', 'only', 'listen', 'English', 'cast.Whilst', 'not', 'greatest', 'Gundam', 'movie', '08th', 'MS', 'Team', 'Miller', 'Report', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'worst']",Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Miller's Report

688869,A2YOA7S4KLXEQU,B00005Y6XE,"Lee Jackson ""ljfnord""","[7, 8]","The English Dub of this DVD has a serious chorusing/echo problem that makes everything sound metallic.  It's potentially bad enough to make viewing difficult for some people.  Bandai has not yet said whether or not they will recall the disc - IMHO, they should.As for the movie itself, what is there to say?  It's a compilation of several episodes leading up to and including the first mission after Shiro's espionage hearing.  The episodes are stitched together well by new sequences involving an intelligence officer named Miller and her investigation of Shiro.  However, the scene that closes the movie is very disappointing and quite obviously forced.  It's arguably the worst moment out of the entire Gundam 08th MS Team series, with a cheese quotient up in the serious Velveeta range.  Fortunately, the overall quality of the 08th MS Team series is so high that its worst moments are better than other series' high points.  As a result, if you compare the ending to some of the cheesier anime products (who will remain nameless for now), it could be a lot worse.Even with the sub-par ending, it's still a DVD worth buying, especially if you're collecting the Gundam series.  The quality of the rest of the show makes up for the bad ending, even if it is mostly recap material.  Also, &quot;specials&quot; like this don't get imported to the States that often, so it's nice to see some of the extra material that the Japanese audience got to see during the original run.The casual Gundam watcher should probably investigate Gundam 0080 before buying this DVD.

It includes clips from several episodes, but not in a way that does them justice. The soundtrack is completely altered, especially the musical score, so Kiki's dramatic cry of &quot;Shiro!&quot; loses some of its power. Frankly, you are probably better off just sticking to the first four volumes. But, in case you wanted a little closure where Shiro is given the assignment by Kojima to invade the Zeon territory, then it is worth checking out. Other than that, this DVD is a little bit of a waste.So why a full FOUR stars?However, just like the how the final episode &quot;Last Resort&quot; compensated for the lack of the Miller's report storyline, so do the special features of this DVD make up for its shortcomings. The highlight of the special features is the collection of cut-away scenes from Gundam: Journey to Jaburo for the Playstation 2.
