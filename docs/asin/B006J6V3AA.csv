1516187,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006J6V3AA,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 4]","There's a grand period in everyone's life when you realize you're not quite a child any longer, though you're still a few days, weeks, months, or years (in some cases) shy of true `adult' maturity.  Rarely do we find this epiphany on our own.  Instead, it's pointed out by those around us.  They might laugh or chuckle at us - not rudely, of course, because that would be downright mean.  Instead, those laughs from a place of deeper understanding, and they're legitimately meant to be more an outward reflection on how they, too, once stood on this precarious precipice, waiting for grown-up experiences to come their way.  With those comes wisdom ... or so our parents warned us ...(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Finally graduating from high school, Will (played by Simon Bird) and his best buds Jay (James Buckley), Neil (Blake Harrison), and Simon (Joe Thomas) want nothing more than to put those painful memories to rest, once and for all.  What's the best remedy?  How about a summer vacation to a carefree Greek island paradise where they can party their cares away until the wee small hours of the morning?  Of course - with this group of friends - nothing ever quite goes as planned, but, before their vacation is over, they swear to let nothing stand in their way of heavy drinking and `shagging' like it was the end of times!Raunchy teenage comedies are a dime a dozen, but few of them have ever been as inspired as the much praised Brit-com, THE INBETWEENERS.  Conceived and written by Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, the program ran for three seasons and garnered an impression 13 nominations and awards for acting, writing and presentation.  When it ended, the fans probably thought its run was over, but, thankfully, Beesley and Morris did one better: they quickly penned a follow-up theatrical script in order to give the four boys the proper send-off.As an added plus, our boys finally do find some `action' of a sort (I'd dare not spoil it for anyone still waiting to see the film) in the ladies department.  While I have read some who've chalked their resulting romances up to a certain level of predictability, I rather thought their respective choices were fitting given the nature of who these young men are, what they stand for, and who they might inevitably shape up to be.  Besides, the point of the motion picture of this type is never about defining their futures; it's about seeing them learn to live in the moment as who they are.  On that point, I believe the connections worked brilliantly, and I applaud Beesley and Morris's smart script for not cheapening those moments.To the film's credit, it works extremely well as either standard viewing pleasure for established fans or simply folks new to the franchise, though I'd imagine it works better for folks who've watched these four knuckleheads and their misadventures from the British sitcom.  I won't deny, however, that some of the `punch' behind the funnier material works better when you're grounded in a greater understanding of some of the events from the TV show, such as the Simon/Carli relationship and the endless bickering between the four male misfits.  I'd happily put this up against any similar American property that dishes mostly humor about that fragile period between the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood - it's observations are simply that successful.THE INBETWEENERS MOVIE is produced by Bwark Productions, Film4 (for), and Young Films.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Lionsgate.  As for the technical specs, it all looks and sounds exceptional, though there were a few sequences that may've been miked just a bit off (cranked up the volume, and there was no problem).  The disc has an impressive assortment of special features, including a commentary track by all of the Inbetweeners themselves; a making-of featurette featuring cast and crew interviews; the obligatory deleted scenes and bloopers (deleted scenes weren't all that grand, but the bloopers were pretty solid and very reminiscent of some goofs from the TV show); and some theatrical trailers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Yes, it's not quite on par with the winning television program that spawned the franchise, but most everything about THE INBETWEENERS MOVIE is still very original, very inspired, and very funny.  Some of the luster may've worn off these social oddballs; still, it's a charming combination of youthful over-exuberance strengthened by general cluelessness.  It's the perfect movie for anyone who never fit in ... or the rest of us who honestly thought we did!  Rent it for the laughs, and remember what it was like to fall in-between.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with an advance DVD screener of THE INBETWEENERS MOVIE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,The Boys From INBETWEENERS Get A Proper Theatrical Conclusion To Their Days of Adolescence,1356998400,"01

This movie takes that format and sends it way over the top.Here's the scoop. Four buddies, gorpy to the enth degree, go to Greece for a holiday. The plan, as usual, is to drink themselves into a coma, find some luscious babes and lose their virginity. Of course, things don't quite turn out as they'd planned. But sometimes the unexpected journey proves more fruitful.This was a near surreal experience to watch. We've seen this. Many times. But this is totally bizarre. First off are the four friends. Many of us have seen photos of Walmart shoppers and know that there are a lot of socially inept folk out there. But these four aren't stupid, so it's difficult to understand how they got so far afield. And then they meet up with four young ladies. By all rights the girls should have run, screaming, from the premises. But, counter to logic, a small spark begins to smolder and eventually ignites. I'd like to say these guys run through the gamut of misadventures, but somehow, through the gorpiness, it takes on a gravity all its own. As in these  kinds of movies, the good guys win and the cromags get their comeuppance. They cheat here and there by putting things up on the screen that wouldn't even work in bizzaro world, but you like the characters so you let it slide.This is taken form the TV show of the same name so it must have had some degree of following.

The program followed the adventures of four schoolmates through their high school years, as they dealt with situations typically encountered by boys of that age, school, girls, cars, drinking alcohol, and sex.  While featuring plenty of crude and vulgar elements, the humor had a certain level of sophistication and irony, as things seldom turn out well for these lads, as the series concluded with graduation approaching.The Inbetweeners (2011) movie takes up shortly after best buddies Simon (Joe Thomas), Will (Simon Bird), Neil (Blake Harrison), and Jay (James Buckley) have graduated.  Before going their separate ways, they embark to Malia, on the island of Crete, where Simon's former girlfriend Carli (Emily Head) is on holiday.Continuing the story in a feature film, provides the opportunity to push the bounds of the humor to new levels, but unfortunately, while the film gets off to a decent start, it soon becomes bogged down, and never really takes flight.  The humor that played well for schoolboys in England, can't seem to find much traction in the sunny Mediterranean.  The movie does feature some nudity, but sadly it is mostly of the male variety.In Malia, the guys eventually hook up with a group of four girlfriends, Alison (Launa Haddock), Lucy (Tamia Kari), Jane (Lydia Rose Bewley), and Lisa (Jessica Knappett).  Ever the optimist, Will attempts to get closer to the striking Alison.  Lucy seems interested in Simon, but he remains fixated with reconciling with Carli.  As usual, the only one having any success with the ladies is Neil, who is working a slightly older demographic.The Inbetweeners worked brilliantly in the school setting, but the premise seems to flounder a bit, on the larger stage of the real world.  Although the personalities of the primary characters remains mostly true to the TV series, the screenplay can't seem to find a way to make the humor work, in this particular situation.  It's nice to see the guys finding some success with the fair sex, but the romances play out with very little warmth.  The acting is decent, as more often, it is the writing that fails to measure up.  The movie may appeal to ""Inbetweenites"", but general audiences may not find it very amusing.",3,"the high school humor, doesn't translate very well to the cinema...",1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2347,"['three', 'seasons', 'raucous', 'award', 'winning', 'British', 'comedy', 'Inbetweeners', '2008-2010', 'concluded', 'run', 'television', 'program', 'followed', 'adventures', 'four', 'schoolmates', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'dealt', 'situations', 'typically', 'encountered', 'boys', 'age', 'school', 'girls', 'cars', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'sex', 'featuring', 'plenty', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'elements', 'humor', 'had', 'certain', 'level', 'sophistication', 'irony', 'things', 'seldom', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'lads', 'series', 'concluded', 'graduation', 'approaching.The', 'Inbetweeners', '2011', 'movie', 'up', 'shortly', 'best', 'buddies', 'Simon', 'Joe', 'Thomas', 'Will', 'Simon', 'Bird', 'Neil', 'Blake', 'Harrison', 'Jay', 'James', 'Buckley', 'have', 'graduated', 'going', 'separate', 'ways', 'embark', 'Malia', 'island', 'Crete', 'where', 'Simon', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Carli', 'Emily', 'Head', 'holiday.Continuing', 'story', 'feature', 'film', 'opportunity', 'push', 'bounds', 'humor', 'new', 'levels', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'off', 'decent', 'start', 'soon', 'bogged', 'down', 'never', 'really', 'flight', 'humor', 'played', 'well', 'schoolboys', 'England', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'much', 'traction', 'sunny', 'Mediterranean', 'movie', 'feature', 'nudity', 'sadly', 'mostly', 'male', 'variety.In', 'Malia', 'guys', 'eventually', 'hook', 'up', 'group', 'four', 'girlfriends', 'Alison', 'Launa', 'Haddock', 'Lucy', 'Tamia', 'Kari', 'Jane', 'Lydia', 'Rose', 'Bewley', 'Lisa', 'Jessica', 'Knappett', 'Ever', 'optimist', 'Will', 'get', 'closer', 'striking', 'Alison', 'Lucy', 'interested', 'Simon', 'fixated', 'reconciling', 'Carli', 'usual', 'only', 'one', 'having', 'success', 'ladies', 'Neil', 'who', 'working', 'slightly', 'older', 'demographic.The', 'Inbetweeners', 'worked', 'brilliantly', 'school', 'setting', 'premise', 'flounder', 'bit', 'larger', 'stage', 'real', 'world', 'personalities', 'primary', 'characters', 'mostly', 'true', 'TV', 'series', 'screenplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'humor', 'work', 'particular', 'situation', 'nice', 'see', 'guys', 'finding', 'success', 'fair', 'sex', 'romances', 'play', 'out', 'very', 'little', 'warmth', 'acting', 'decent', 'more', 'often', 'writing', 'measure', 'up', 'movie', 'may', 'appeal', 'Inbetweenites', 'general', 'audiences', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'amusing']",N/A

1516199,A4YXKE5F62II8,B006J6V3AA,Visual Bureau,"[0, 0]","""After sometime of anticipation for Simon, Neil, Will, and Jay getting up to no ruddy good, The Inbetweeners Movie, released around August 2011 stays true to the nature of teenage shenanigans and British chauvinism but falls short of concluding its excellent series. All the characters have a place and time here and the film takes a look at their time in a heavily Anglicised Greek tourist resort. As a whole, it was funny but it was a bit weak (not as hitting and hilarious as the show), slow at parts (timing could be a little tighter), and underdeveloped (this is especially the case in the ending and climax) compared to the series which managed to have time and variation in its plot. I wish the film would have concluded it the film better by providing more emotion (like showing Simon going to university). The same concern could be said sometimes for The Simpsons Movie, another film based on an excellent TV series. For a film that is full of crude material, this feels a tad shallow and predictable as of now with the usual cues found in films like Superbad and Project X. However, unlike those films, The Inbetweeners stands on its own ground being a British creation based on the kind of youth culture existent and many of the film's crude qualities share similarity with the 2000 cult comedy Kevin & Perry Go Large. Unlike The Inbetweeners, Kevin & Perry does not lack the independence, musical vibes, and edgy humour that it had when it first came out. In other words, it works in many spots as it as but it is far from spectacular. Nevertheless, for any Inbetweeners fan, it is required viewing but more could have been asked for.""",3,"If you love The Inbetweeners UK, you might love it, be even, or hate it?
