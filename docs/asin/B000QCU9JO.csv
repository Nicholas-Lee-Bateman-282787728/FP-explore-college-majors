As Westerns they are mostly comedies with some good shootouts and western action.  These movies are enjoyable, but I liked My Name is Nobody better, it also stars Terrance Hill.  I liked the Part in the first movie when Trinity wants to become a Mormon and have two wives only to find the two women he wants to marry are married to the &#34;old man&#34; he was helping. These movies were made following the success of the Clint Eastwood trilogy of Westerns starting with a Fist Full of Dollars.
