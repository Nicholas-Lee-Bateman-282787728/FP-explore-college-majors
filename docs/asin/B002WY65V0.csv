Overall, the rookie acting performances and beautiful professional skating made for a nice film with only a few cliches and a nice message.The story follows a young skater as she decides to compete, facing the usual obstacles of peer cat fighting, a long distance relationship, and personal sacrifices aggravated by a life changing disability. The topics get grazed over, sometimes too fast to have a huge emotional impact, but the ending success and competent young love story make for an enjoyable watch. The video quality is solid, and the 5.1 gets used more than one would think for a film like this. The supplements include:* Behind the scenes, 12:53 minutes. A thorough look into the production, skating/acting mixes, and other assorted material without delving too much into the original work.* Deleted scenes, play all option of 4 scenes totaling 6:38 minutes. All character stuff, which was too bad since this was her only acting performance, so all of the skating was left in the film.English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai with subs in the same with some Chinese and Korean also.

Hooker ""bulmabriefs144""","[2, 5]","Just from the first 10 minutes, there were missed subtleties that made the original great, that without which made this film kinda small. It was updated to the modern era, but for one thing the lack of a single section of film film killed the opening.The first scene of the original has a white fog of snow before they zoom into the snowfield and her dancing. The remake has a direct to the snowfield and her dancing.  More direct is better, right? Wrong! The whiteness of the snow is a metaphor, subtlety, and foreshadowing.  Things which people in the seventies and eighties apparently knew how to do, back when hit movies like Saint Elmo's Fire were around. Nope, not only is there no subtlety or anything, but midway into the song which made the original famous, they cut it and play some hard rock song.You also don't get a good sense of the characters. In the original, the bf when he quits his medical or whatever dream and is back in town says for awhile ""dunno why am I"" or the like, then you get the reason later that it's to see the girl, and he'll have to apologize to his parents later. The girl is developed as too old for professional, because she joined late (none of which is shown, except mentioned in passing).  The mom and dad are also better developed, the dad wants her to stay safe and was pushing her to wait, the mom is driving her because she was like a has-been skater herself (which again, is told rather than shown).As a result of all this depth taken out, the film comes out flat and almost laughable.
