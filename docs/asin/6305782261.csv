477594,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305782261,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I have recently discovered director/actor/anyone commentary on DVDs.  For the longest time, I would complain that they added no value to any film, and that as a critic I chose not to listen to them because I wanted to enjoy the film in its final version - audio commentaries are like being in the kitchen of a elaborate restaurant ... do you really want to know what goes in your food?  Actually, and rather surprisingly, I have recently found the answer to be ""yes"", and have been devouring commentaries like minute candy.  I have discovered many truths and errors of many directors or actors as they humorously and severely critique their bodies of work.  One of my most recent adventures involved the film ""Tumbleweeds"", which garnished several awards (with great respect) for Janet McTeer, but made me realize one small facet of cinema that I don't think about when I watch movies directly - there is a reason the directors are behind the camera, and typically, not in front.  In ""Tumbleweeds"", my case is built around Gavin O' Conner - the director, whom in my unprofessional opinion shouldn't be either in front of the camera or at least talking behind it.  He is a decent director, but not one that should open his mouth or voice an opinion - harsh words? I don't think so.  He completely destroyed the ambiance of this film.Well, if I haven't completely disgusted the reader by this point, I have such pulled them in so that I have to explain myself and my comments about the above remark.  As I watched ""Tumbleweeds"" for a second time, I realized that it was a wonderful film about a mother and daughter team that travels across the country avoiding the mother's mishaps with wrong men.  It is a touching story that is helmed by one of the most unappreciated actresses of our time, Janet McTeer.  Her performance, not only in this film, but also in a little independent feature called ""Songcatcher"", is breathtaking.  She is captivating, intelligent, and completely steals every scene in which she performs.  ""Tumbleweeds"" is worth the purchase, if anything, just for McTeer's performance.  Not only is her singular performance attractive, but she is able to intermingle with her daughter, Ava (Kimberly Brown) with the greatest of ease, and even the despicable Jack Ranson (Gavin's mush-mouthed role) with sheer brilliance.  I could dedicate this entire review, scene by scene, on how well McTeer controlled herself.  It is a performance, as well as the one in ""Songcatcher"" that I believe others in the same profession should be forced to watch before getting into the game.  This I believe - what can you say?  But Gavin, oh Gavin, that is a completely different story.For the first thirty-plus minutes of this film we are forced to build a bond between Janet and Ava, but then, Gavin - honestly kinda snobby - forces his way into the picture.  Without the director commentary, it is merely by chance, but as you listen you realize that he tells us that nobody else could have played the role better than him.  Arriving into California, I was a bit surprised that someone with an incredibly thick New York accent took the role of a manipulative trucker.  Hey, he even gained weight for the role - but he didn't fit with the film.  What bothered me the most is that he never quite saw that throughout his pandering of how great of a director he was.  I envision Gavin as exactly the character of Jack Ranson.  He is a decent guy to begin with, but when the stress begins to pour on, his temper begins to flair and his ego begins to rise.  I just got that from this commentary, which in turn soured my experience a bit for this film.There were other parts to the film that didn't fit either, but were excusable.  There is a moment at the end where Ava and random man Dan Miller cry their eyes out in a RV, which doesn't make much sense in the grand scheme of the film - oddly, the entire Dan Miller addition (while greatly played by Jay O. Saunders) just didn't compute near the end.  It was a chance to see that a good man was floating right below Janet's nose and she didn't even see it, but he just doesn't fit with the entire rest of the film.  Kimberly Brown does a great job keeping up with McTeer and honestly playing her daughter very well - with the same sarcasm and spunk.What can I say, outside of Gavin, I thought this was a very honest outing.  I liked the lower budget which took chances, I liked the characters (for the most part), the drama seemed to equate well with the humor, and it was a true story - one couldn't ask for anything better.  The mixture was perfect, and McTeer deserves every ounce of praise as she received for this film, but alas, I cannot say the same for Gavin.  He is, as stated before, a decent director, but he forces himself too freely upon us.  He is controlling, overbearing, and rude - and I haven't even met the man before.  It is just the way he came across in the commentary.I can suggest this film to everyone.  I thought, beyond my dislike for Gavin, it was a powerful film with very strong characters.  They were complex, yet utterly simple.  It was translatable and powerful to see McTeer just gobble up her character.  Outside of the small mishaps mentioned above, this was a great film.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Three cheers for McTeer!!  No cheers for Gavin O'Connor.,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,5274,"['have', 'recently', 'discovered', 'director/actor/anyone', 'commentary', 'DVDs', 'longest', 'time', 'would', 'complain', 'added',

I usually triage films I eventually watch -- some I must see on the big screen, some I rent, and  some I buy on blind faith and film reviews. This film fell into the last  category. The critics wrote very favorable comments about Janet MeTeer's  performance, and of course she won a Golden Globe, so I wasn't taking too  much of a risk, and I was not disappointed in my decision.Janet McTeer  plays a dislocated single mom named Mary Jo Walker.  She is so real I swear  I knew her back in North Carolina. Her daughter Ava, played by Kimberly J.  Brown looks like a real child and has a real child's problems.I couldn't  gauge the time period of the film but the bathing suits were right out of  the late fifties or early sixties (they weighed a ton when you got them  wet). Ava's English teacher uses the phrase &quot;dissed&quot; which seems  out of place to me as I don't remember that term being used before the  seventies.Depending on the period, things were better or worse for  single moms and their offspring although California was the place to be  until very recently if you wanted to survive (too expensive now! ). There  was a time when the only way a female could deal with an unhappy home life  was to &quot;get married&quot; and run away, and then &quot;get  married&quot; and run away, etc. and the first thing you knew you woke up  one morning and found you had been married 3 or 4 times, were unemployed,  and still waiting for the knight in shining armor who never seemed to show  up.I know what it feels like to run away from an abusive parent at age  17, dropping out of high-school and marrying the first guy who asked. Heck,  I went straight from  North Carolina to California. If you've  misjudged--and most do--you end up bouncing along from one pillar to  another post waiting for something to work out.This film reveals how  misjudgments happen.  Women who make bad choices aren't bad -- just hurt,  scared, and uninformed about other, better choices. My single mom friends  and I survived by befriending each other, and showing each other how to  &quot;rise above&quot; problems.

I had no idea she was an English actor until I saw Songcatcher. I loved her in that film and started looking for more of her work.

477606,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305782261,Matthew Horner,"[3, 7]","British actress Janet McTeer got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her work in Tumbleweeds. Writer/director Gavin O'Connor and young Kimberly Brown received nominations in several smaller competitions. I am quite a supporter of independent films, and I wish I liked Tumbleweeds more than I do.Aging Southern belle Mary Jo Walker [McTeer] is one of those people who prefer flight over fight. In the opening scene, she is having a bitter argument with her live-in boyfriend. In an adjoining room, her twelve-year old daughter, Ava [Kimberly Brown], is already packing her things. She knows what's coming. After the fight, we see the two driving down the road and discussing where to move to now. Mary Jo decides on Arizona, but Ava picks San Diego, based on picture in a magazine and on the fact that she's never seen the beach. Ava wins Mary Jo over, and along the way to California, we learn more about the characters. Mary Jo has married so many times that the actual number is never given. Every time she leaves a man, she moves on to someplace new. This seems an appropriate response to her, but as young as Ava is, she knows this pattern is neither normal nor healthy. She is sick of it. At the same time, mother and daughter love each other deeply and are quite attached. They are, for all intents and purposes, best friends.In San Diego, Mary Jo gets a decent job, and Ava enrolls in a wonderful school where she responds to the education program and starts to make friends. All is happiness until the inevitable happens. Mary Jo decides to move them in with a man. Just as often happens in real life, Mary Jo has a history of trading one rotten relationship for another. My theory on this phenomenon is that many people subconsciously look for the same personality traits over and over again, thus making each encounter a self fulfilling prophecy.So what bothered me about Tumbleweeds? It certainly wasn't the acting, which is uniformly excellent, or the direction, which is sure-handed. One problem lies in the story. The ideas, that you can't solve your problems by running away from them and that the needs of others are at least equal to your own, are fine. But the story is somehow not fleshed out. Some will find the ending satisfactory, but, to me, it's weak. The beach does serve as a symbol of running out of places to go, I suppose, yet the sudden 'roll credits' seems arbitrary.It's as though Gavin O'Connor were obsessed with making this an independent movie. Let me explain. There are certain visuals in low budget films which are the result of equipment limitations. You can't afford helicopters for panoramic shots or cameras mounted on one hundred foot tall cranes. You can't afford gliding tracking shots, which literally require tracks. I believe these limitations actually enhance creativity. O'Connor, however, seems intent on making a small picture using some sort of independent's rule book. These include long extreme close-ups of characters' faces, always using hand held cameras. The effect is to give the average viewer motion sickness. It also detracts from the dialog, which is a highlight of these kinds of movies. The women drive across America on back roads. This is certainly more scenic than using the interstate, but it also is an increasingly archaic technique. So, the director tries to crystallize what is an independent movie. Ironically, the great thing about small pictures is that there are virtually no rules, outside of what you can afford to do. Except perhaps to Mr. Gavin.",3,Quirky indie film only partly successful,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3532,"['British', 'actress', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'work', 'Tumbleweeds', 'Writer/director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'young', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', 'received', 'nominations', 'several', 'smaller', 'competitions', 'am', 'quite', 'supporter', 'independent', 'films', 'wish', 'liked', 'Tumbleweeds', 'more', 'do.Aging', 'Southern', 'belle', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Walker', '[', 'McTeer', ']', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'prefer', 'flight', 'fight', 'opening', 'scene', 'having', 'bitter', 'argument', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'adjoining', 'room', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Ava', '[', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', ']', 'already', 'packing', 'things', 'what', 'coming', 'fight', 'see', 'two', 'driving', 'road', 'discussing', 'where', 'move', 'now', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Arizona', 'Ava', 'San', 'Diego', 'based', 'picture', 'magazine', 'fact', 'never', 'seen', 'beach', 'Ava', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'way', 'California', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'married', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'actual', 'number', 'never', 'given', 'time', 'man', 'someplace', 'new', 'appropriate', 'response', 'as', 'young', 'Ava', 'pattern', 'normal', 'healthy', 'sick', 'same', 'time', 'mother', 'daughter', 'love', 'other', 'deeply', 'are', 'quite', 'attached', 'are', 'intents', 'purposes', 'best', 'friends.In', 'San', 'Diego', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'decent', 'job', 'Ava', 'enrolls', 'wonderful', 'school', 'where', 'education', 'program', 'make', 'friends', 'happiness', 'inevitable', 'happens', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'move', 'man', 'Just', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'history', 'trading', 'one', 'rotten', 'relationship', 'theory', 'phenomenon', 'many', 'people', 'subconsciously', 'look', 'same', 'personality', 'traits', 'over', 'again', 'thus', 'making', 'encounter', 'self', 'fulfilling', 'prophecy.So', 'what', 'bothered', 'Tumbleweeds', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'direction', 'sure-handed', 'One', 'problem', 'story', 'ideas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'solve', 'problems', 'running', 'away', 'needs', 'others', 'are', 'least', 'equal', 'own', 'are', 'fine', 'story', 'somehow', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'will', 'find', 'ending', 'satisfactory', 'weak', 'beach', 'serve', 'symbol', 'running', 'places', 'go', 'suppose', 'yet', 'sudden', ""'roll"", 'credits', 'arbitrary.It', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'were', 'obsessed', 'making', 'independent', 'movie', 'Let', 'explain', 'are', 'certain', 'visuals', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'are', 'result', 'equipment', 'limitations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'helicopters', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'cameras', 'mounted', 'one', 'hundred', 'foot', 'tall', 'cranes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'gliding', 'tracking', 'shots', 'literally', 'require', 'tracks', 'believe', 'limitations', 'actually', 'enhance', 'creativity', ""O'Connor"", 'however', 'intent', 'making', 'small', 'picture', 'using', 'sort', 'independent', 'rule', 'book', 'include', 'long', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'characters', 'always', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'effect', 'give', 'average', 'viewer', 'motion', 'sickness', 'also', 'dialog', 'highlight', 'kinds', 'movies', 'women', 'drive', 'America', 'back', 'roads', 'certainly', 'more', 'scenic', 'using', 'interstate', 'also', 'increasingly', 'archaic', 'technique', 'So', 'director', 'crystallize', 'what', 'independent', 'movie', 'Ironically', 'great', 'thing', 'small', 'pictures', 'are', 'virtually', 'rules', 'what', 'can', 'afford', 'do', 'Except', 'perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Gavin']",Tumbleweeds VHS

477610,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305782261,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","In `Tumbleweeds' we're back on the road again with yet another single mother and her disgruntled offspring as they search for love and stability  in places unknown and settings unfamiliar. Following in the footsteps of  `Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' `Mermaids,' `This Boy's Life' and  countless other films of that ilk, `Tumbleweeds' rarely strays from the  tried-and-true narrative formula of the genre, yet thanks to two superb  performances by its lead actresses and a quality of naturalism in its  writing and directing, the film manages to be at least perpetually  watchable if not exactly compelling.The film starts off with a  harrowing scene of domestic violence that neatly defines the tenor of Mary  Jo Walker's life and character. Fatally attracted to abusive losers, Mary  Jo decides to pick up and leave her current no-good boyfriend and head out  with her daughter, Ava, to erase the past and start life afresh. We  discover that this is indeed the pattern of her life and her daughter,  driven into rootlessness as a result, seethes with a resentment that flairs  up periodically in outbursts of rage and anger. Finally settling on San  Diego as their new Eden, the two wayfarers attempt to settle in and begin a  new life for themselves. However, lifelong patterns die hard and Mary Jo is  soon shacking up with yet another time bomb in the form of a trucker she  has met earlier on the road, much as the ever-wise Ava predicted. Waiting  in the wings, of course, is the one man who could truly make Mary Jo happy  - the paragon of male sensitivity who works right there in the office with  her - if only she could see past the sexual energy of the brutish scum that  so invariably attract her.`Tumbleweeds' pretty much does what it can,  saddled as it is with such a derivative concept. The feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu  generated by the predictability of the proceedings is alleviated somewhat  by the shattering performances of Janet McTeer and Kimberley J. Brown who  never hit a false note in their portrayals of two well-meaning souls  struggling with a less-than-ideal situation and life. They are matched by  Jay O. Sanders, as Mary Jo's newest love interest, who brings a subtlety to  a role that could easily have slid into two-dimensional villainy. Instead,  Sanders keeps his character's violent tendencies seething just beneath the  surface, flaring out only at key moments. Yet, somehow, even at such times,  he manages to maintain a certain strange quality of understandable  sympathy; we sense he is a man who strikes out more from petulance and  frustration than cruelty and malice. Either way, he is a much more  interesting character than the bland, sappy dolt that she - again, true to  the formula - ultimately ends up with.Screenwriter Angela Shelton and  co-writer/director Gavin O'Connor display a nice ear for naturalistic  dialogue and O'Connor allows his actors to establish just the proper rhythm  to make their interactions believable and real. Far more than anything  else, this is definitely an actor's film.This is why the upbeat ending  of the film, where all the loose ends are tied together at a middle school  production of `Romeo and Juliet,' (in which Ava naturally has a starring  role!), is such a disappointment, completely betraying, as it does, the  realistic tenor of much of the rest of the film. In a similar vein, the  film also suffers from an over abundance of coincidental meetings that  likewise undercut the film's crucial quality of credibility. Particularly  mind boggling is the reunion Mary Jo has in a bar in San Diego with a hunky  truck driver she met on a highway in Kentucky. Small world  indeed!`Tumbleweeds' stands in the shadows of some pretty impressive  earlier films and, as a result, it never becomes of more than passing  interest. Yet, for the performances of the two tumbleweeds at its core as  well as several other elements of quality, this is a film that deserves  some attention.",3,hackneyed drama buoyed by dynamite performances,967507200,"08 29, 2000",2000,3979,"['Tumbleweeds', ""'re"", 'back', 'road', 'again', 'yet', 'single', 'mother', 'disgruntled', 'offspring', 'search', 'love', 'stability', 'places', 'unknown', 'settings', 'unfamiliar', 'Following', 'footsteps', 'Alice', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'Mermaids', 'Boy', 'Life', 'countless', 'other', 'films', 'ilk', 'Tumbleweeds', 'rarely', 'tried-and-true', 'narrative', 'formula', 'genre', 'yet', 'thanks', 'two', 'superb', 'performances', 'lead', 'actresses', 'quality', 'naturalism', 'writing', 'directing', 'film', 'be', 'least', 'perpetually', 'watchable', 'not', 'exactly', 'compelling.The', 'film', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'domestic', 'violence', 'neatly', 'tenor', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Walker', 'life', 'character', 'Fatally', 'attracted', 'abusive', 'losers', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'pick', 'up', 'leave', 'current', 'no-good', 'boyfriend', 'head', 'daughter', 'Ava', 'erase', 'past', 'start', 'life', 'afresh', 'discover', 'indeed', 'pattern', 'life', 'daughter', 'driven', 'rootlessness', 'result', 'seethes', 'resentment', 'up', 'periodically', 'outbursts', 'rage', 'anger', 'Finally', 'settling', 'San', 'Diego', 'new', 'Eden', 'two', 'wayfarers', 'attempt', 'settle', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'However', 'lifelong', 'patterns', 'die', 'hard', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'soon', 'shacking', 'up', 'yet', 'time', 'bomb', 'form', 'trucker', 'met', 'earlier', 'road', 'much', 'ever-wise', 'Ava', 'predicted', 'Waiting', 'wings', 'course', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'truly', 'make', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'happy', 'paragon', 'male', 'sensitivity', 'who', 'right', 'office', 'only', 'could', 'see', 'sexual', 'energy', 'brutish', 'scum', 'so', 'invariably', 'attract', 'her.', 'Tumbleweeds', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'can', 'saddled', 'such', 'derivative', 'concept', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'generated', 'predictability', 'proceedings', 'alleviated', 'somewhat', 'shattering', 'performances', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Kimberley', 'J', 'Brown', 'who', 'never', 'hit', 'false', 'note', 'portrayals', 'two', 'well-meaning', 'souls', 'struggling', 'less-than-ideal', 'situation', 'life', 'are', 'matched', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'newest', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'subtlety', 'role', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'slid', 'two-dimensional', 'villainy', 'Instead', 'Sanders', 'character', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'seething', 'just', 'surface', 'flaring', 'out', 'only', 'key', 'moments', 'somehow', 'even', 'such', 'times', 'maintain', 'certain', 'strange', 'quality', 'understandable', 'sympathy', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'more', 'petulance', 'frustration', 'cruelty', 'malice', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'bland', 'sappy', 'dolt', 'again', 'true', 'formula', 'ultimately', 'up', 'with.Screenwriter', 'Angela', 'Shelton', 'co-writer/director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'display', 'nice', 'ear', 'naturalistic', 'dialogue', ""O'Connor"", 'actors', 'establish', 'just', 'proper', 'rhythm', 'make', 'interactions', 'believable', 'real', 'Far', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'definitely', 'actor', 'film.This', 'why', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'film', 'where', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'middle', 'school', 'production', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Ava', 'naturally', 'starring', 'role', 'such', 'disappointment', 'completely', 'betraying', 'realistic', 'tenor', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'similar', 'vein', 'film', 'also', 'abundance', 'coincidental', 'meetings', 'likewise', 'film', 'crucial', 'quality', 'credibility', 'Particularly', 'mind', 'boggling', 'reunion', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'bar', 'San', 'Diego', 'hunky', 'truck', 'met', 'highway', 'Kentucky', 'Small', 'world', 'indeed', 'Tumbleweeds', 'stands', 'shadows', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'earlier', 'films', 'result', 'never', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'performances', 'two', 'tumbleweeds', 'core', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'other', 'elements', 'quality', 'film', 'attention']",Tumbleweeds VHS

Director O'Connor is interested in letting us become voyeurs, if you will, to the lives of two lovable Southern gals who have been perpetually on-the-run. But Jo and Ava  are no Thelma and Louise. Without a doubt they are best friends, but they  are first and foremost mother and daughter. Janet McTeer is perfect as the  male-dependent but ultimately protective mom. She doesn't feel normal  without a man (even a lousy man) but she places her daughter's welfare  above all else...when push comes (literally) to shove.Kimberly Brown excels  as mouse-loving Ava, a precocious child thoroughly jaded by her mother's  string of relational flops, thoroughly tired of their constant escapes to  unknown places. O'Connor makes it clear that these two gals are in search  of a home. Their road trip to California is filmed with some nice,  atmospheric cinematography, and flows along at just the right pace. Just  when they think they've found the promised land in San Diego, mama starts  her pattern all over again. This time, however, Ava effects the change they  all desperately need by putting her foot down and demanding some stability.  Her bravery is fueled by a chance to realize an acting dream, and the  wisdom of a dear friend. All in all, Tumbleweeds is a beguilingly languid  film, a glimpse into the human struggle to find a place of permanence in  life...all played out in uniquely American scenery. A fine addition to  anyone's collection. BTW...Janet McTeer certainly merited her Oscar  nomination. This Brit actress was amazingly believable as the lovably  trashy southern Mama.",4,Scenes From American Life,956880000,"04 28, 2000",2000,1635,"['peculiarly', 'American', 'gem', 'film', 'Director', ""O'Connor"", 'interested', 'letting', 'become', 'voyeurs', 'will', 'lives', 'two', 'lovable', 'Southern', 'gals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'perpetually', 'on-the-run', 'Jo', 'Ava', 'are', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'doubt', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'first', 'foremost', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'perfect', 'male-dependent', 'ultimately', 'protective', 'mom', ""n't"", 'feel', 'normal', 'man', 'even', 'lousy', 'man', 'daughter', 'welfare', 'else', 'when', 'push', 'literally', 'shove.Kimberly', 'Brown', 'excels', 'mouse-loving', 'Ava', 'precocious', 'child', 'thoroughly', 'jaded', 'mother', 'string', 'relational', 'flops', 'thoroughly', 'tired', 'constant', 'escapes', 'unknown', 'places', ""O'Connor"", 'clear', 'two', 'gals', 'are', 'search', 'home', 'road', 'trip', 'California', 'filmed', 'nice', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'along', 'just', 'right', 'pace', 'Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'found', 'promised', 'land', 'San', 'Diego', 'mama', 'pattern', 'over', 'again', 'time', 'however', 'Ava', 'effects', 'change', 'desperately', 'need', 'putting', 'foot', 'down', 'demanding', 'stability', 'bravery', 'fueled', 'chance', 'realize', 'acting', 'dream', 'wisdom', 'dear', 'friend', 'Tumbleweeds', 'beguilingly', 'languid', 'film', 'glimpse', 'human', 'struggle', 'find', 'place', 'permanence', 'life', 'played', 'out', 'uniquely', 'American', 'scenery', 'fine', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'BTW', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'certainly', 'merited', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Brit', 'actress', 'was', 'amazingly', 'believable', 'lovably', 'trashy', 'southern', 'Mama']",Tumbleweeds VHS

I explain to myself that she is the survivor type with the need to turn over a new leaf each time something does not work out. As if by changing a place, throwing your old clothes through the window, the past is erased. Mary Jo is not attached to husbands, clothes or places although she is a friendly and outgoing person, but her love for her daughter Eva is big enough to bring on a change.This is no great movie nor one that will stay with you forever, but is truly enjoyable and mainly due to its two main heroines and the optimistic good-natured characters of both mother and daughter. There is a slight resemblance to the movie &quot;Mermaids&quot; and to the other mother character.During the movie I asked myself several times if one can really learn to adopt such attitude of &quot;don't worry...I can always find another job&quot;... I wonder. I guess you have to be born with this attitude or adopt it after a series of life circumstances where you have only yourself to count on. In any case this attitude seems to work for Mary Jo as she is able to make a new beginning every time, until Eva puts her foot down. Both actresses were great and I loved their chemistry. Janet McTeer  is endearing as the easy going, life loving Mary Jo and Kimberly Brown playing Eva is as sweet as can be (yet always a normal child).The men characters do not come out so good out of this movie and I was sorry to see that when finally a worthy man comes along Mary Jo is in her &quot;now independent&quot; stage.
