This is based on a true story and they did a great job.  It's SO realistic and as you watch it you feel so bad for the family.  I mean, what do you do when you're the only one that can hear and see the paranormal activity and your family thinks you're just ""stressed out.""  And even when they realize she's not just stressed, they can't move and the church won't help them.  This movie scared the life out of me because you know it's true and you wonder what would you do if it happend to you?  I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who likes true ghost stories. If you're into today's movies which are extremely gory, then this movie is not for you.  But I think most people would enjoy it.

Not only was the movie based on a real haunting, it involved Lorraine and Ed Warren, true paraniormal specialists. I had not expected to find it on a DVD and was sadly correct in that so at least I have it on a home video tape which will be transferred to a DVD when I can afford a DVD recorder. It parallels another not- based-on-fact movie, Poltergeist, in that the hauntings were subtle to begin with, then progressed to such power the family moved out. Unfortunately, the hauntings followed them to their new house. So many scenes in this really made me glad I was watching it on my screen, especially when Jack was attacked by a demon. When the family left for a camping trip, neighbors were ""entertained"" by the racket made by the spirits which lead credence to the Smurls' continued declarations that it was all real. It has been some time since I last saw it, but I do not recall anything in it that was not top-rate and will wait hopefully for when it is released on DVD.",5,LEAVES MOST TRUE HAUNTING MOVIES IN THE DUST,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,1094,"['One', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'chilled', 'more', 'was', 'Haunting', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'real', 'haunting', 'was', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'haunting', 'involved', 'Lorraine', 'Ed', 'Warren', 'true', 'paraniormal', 'specialists', 'had', 'not', 'expected', 'find', 'DVD', 'was', 'sadly', 'correct', 'so', 'least', 'have', 'home', 'video', 'tape', 'will', 'be', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'when', 'can', 'afford', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'not-', 'based-on-fact', 'movie', 'Poltergeist', 'hauntings', 'were', 'subtle', 'begin', 'then', 'progressed', 'such', 'power', 'family', 'moved', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'hauntings', 'followed', 'new', 'house', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'really', 'made', 'glad', 'was', 'watching', 'screen', 'especially', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'attacked', 'demon', 'When', 'family', 'left', 'camping', 'trip', 'neighbors', 'were', 'entertained', 'racket', 'made', 'spirits', 'lead', 'credence', 'Smurls', 'continued', 'declarations', 'was', 'real', 'been', 'time', 'last', 'saw', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'anything', 'was', 'not', 'top-rate', 'will', 'wait', 'hopefully', 'when', 'released', 'DVD']",The Haunted 1991 TV movie

""The Haunted"" is one of the best ghost themed movies we have ever seen and it is made even scarier due to the awareness that it is fact-based on true events that befell the family that endured the haunting.

It's very credibly handled and its creepy as hell - at least I thought so, and I don't believe in ghosts yet it still creeps me out. Okay so it's based on event's the family claimed to have happened, but the ghost hunters they hired in real life are the Warrens. They are involved in every ghost scam going. Some people believe them, but heck! anyway, you don't have to be a believer to enjoy this movie.
