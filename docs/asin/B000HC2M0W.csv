1012074,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B000HC2M0W,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[15, 17]","Years ago, Ron Perlman (who is a priest in this movie) was a teacher at a Catholic school.  One very good Catholic girl was doing her schoolwork in a classroom, when suddenly and completely without explanation she was carried away by supernatural forces.  Flash forward to the present.  The school has been re-opened, and is being run by a wicked (yet really hot) headmistress.  Ron Perlman is back as the priest, and five new girls are dumped in this place by their uncaring parents.  All the girls have supernatural powers, they're also delinquents, and their parents are glad to be rid of them.  As the story progresses, we start seeing the ghost of the girl who disappeared earlier, and of course the girls are determined to get to the bottom of the mystery.  A very satisfying amount of supernatural mayhem ensues.The good:  Acting is excellent, the script is witty, and the mystery is solved in a very satisfying manner.  It's a bit easy to figure out (even I figured it out before the secret was revealed), but the story isn't very predictable.  There's lots of action, and even the special effects are quite good.  Overall it's a great effort.  Though the trailer for this movie makes it look steamy and sleazy, that's actually a fairly small part of what goes on.  The movie is almost completely concerned with the story.  Though you do get some girls in their undies, a spanking scene, and a topless scene.  And lets not forget some lesbian kissing.The bad:  The soundtrack.  This is supposedly in 5.1, but it sounds like mono sent to the center and two front speakers.  If you sit anywhere but precisely in front of your TV, it has the effect of making the whole soundtrack seem as if it's coming from either your right or left speaker.  I listened to the whole movie through my right front speaker.  That's just really bad.  Also, the movie really seems to drag towards the last part of the middle portion.  The finale is quite exciting, but about 3/4rs of the way through it seems that the mystery has been sufficiently explored and it's time to get on with the conclusion.  But the middle part just goes on and on.  I had to check the DVD case to make sure this movie wasn't 120 minutes long, but no, it's just 90 something.Overall, I'd recommend this to horror fans.  It's certainly not a cheesy B-movie, but a polished and professional effort, only tarnished by the crappy soundtrack.",4,"Very good overall, with a few reservations.",1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,2400,"['Years', 'ago', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'who', 'priest', 'movie', 'was', 'teacher', 'Catholic', 'school', 'One', 'very', 'good', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'was', 'doing', 'schoolwork', 'classroom', 'when', 'suddenly', 'completely', 'explanation', 'was', 'carried', 'away', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'Flash', 'forward', 'present', 'school', 'been', 're-opened', 'being', 'run', 'wicked', 'yet', 'really', 'hot', 'headmistress', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'back', 'priest', 'five', 'new', 'girls', 'are', 'dumped', 'place', 'uncaring', 'parents', 'girls', 'have', 'supernatural', 'powers', ""'re"", 'also', 'delinquents', 'parents', 'are', 'glad', 'be', 'rid', 'story', 'start', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'girl', 'who', 'disappeared', 'earlier', 'course', 'girls', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'bottom', 'mystery', 'very', 'satisfying', 'amount', 'supernatural', 'mayhem', 'ensues.The', 'good', 'Acting', 'excellent', 'script', 'witty', 'mystery', 'solved', 'very', 'satisfying', 'manner', 'bit', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'even', 'figured', 'out', 'secret', 'was', 'revealed', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'predictable', 'lots', 'action', 'even', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Overall', 'great', 'effort', 'trailer', 'movie', 'look', 'steamy', 'sleazy', 'actually', 'fairly', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'concerned', 'story', 'do', 'get', 'girls', 'undies', 'spanking', 'scene', 'topless', 'scene', 'not', 'forget', 'lesbian', 'kissing.The', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'supposedly', '5.1', 'mono', 'sent', 'center', 'two', 'front', 'speakers', 'sit', 'anywhere', 'precisely', 'front', 'TV', 'effect', 'making', 'whole', 'soundtrack', 'seem', 'coming', 'right', 'left', 'speaker', 'listened', 'whole', 'movie', 'right', 'front', 'speaker', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'Also', 'movie', 'really', 'drag', 'last', 'part', 'middle', 'portion', 'finale', 'quite', 'exciting', '3/4rs', 'way', 'mystery', 'been', 'sufficiently', 'explored', 'time', 'get', 'conclusion', 'middle', 'part', 'just', 'had', 'check', 'DVD', 'case', 'make', 'sure', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", '120', 'minutes', 'long', 'just', '90', 'something.Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', 'certainly', 'not', 'cheesy', 'B-movie', 'polished', 'professional', 'effort', 'only', 'tarnished', 'crappy', 'soundtrack']",5ive Girls
1012075,AQG5YCXO6FY6K,B000HC2M0W,but_seriously_folks,"[0, 1]","I am a sucker for religious/occult themed horror movies. When I read the description to this, I thought to myself that, even if it's half-decent, it should be worth purchasing.I'm usually pretty forgiving but, in this case, I was wrong.**** SPOILERS BELOW ****I did like how the imagery of a pentagon was repeated throughout the movie to emphasize the connection of the five girls. Their desks, their beds...even the crucifixes stuck in Father Drake's (Ron Perlman) chest. Plus, as I said, I thought the premise was interesting and had potential.Unfortunately, I thought the story fell short for many reasons. First, why was Father Drake so submissive to the headmistress? Sure, they alluded to how she pulled him from out of a bar but that wouldn't give her authority to remove him from his job. If it was a Catholic school, that would be the decision of the diocese...or, maybe this wasn't an ""authorized"" Catholic school. In that case, he shouldn't be referred to as ""father"" anymore...and if that WAS the case, the writers could at least spent a minute or two and worked that explanation in to the story somehow.Or maybe, the headmistress' power over Father Drake was the threat of going public with indiscretions alluded to with school girls. If so, it wasn't clear....just an annoying loose end.The first scene where Elizabeth is killed, assumed to be by the demon - what the heck was with that??? Read any book on screenplays - the first rule of movies is SHOW. Not tell. Not assume. Not allude to. Plus, Father Drake's reaction to what can only be assumed to be a grizzly death was extremely underwhelming yet a portent of the disappointmens to follow for the next 90 minutes.And that ending....yeesh. After going through battling a demon all night and seeing her friends die, Mara just walks out of the school when the caretaker comes in in the morning, making some glib statement and walks away? And how does the headmistress come back to life after what happened to her? And how does Mara react so nonchalantly to THAT?!?!****END OF SPOILERS****Normally, what could save a poorly plotted story full of holes is over-the-top gore. Lots and lots of fake blood and body parts. Nope. Not here. The writers/director/producers thought they were making the ""Sense and Sensibility"" of teen horror and subsequently believed that gore and violence was beneath them. They were spectacularly wrong on both accounts.So, based on the movie, I would have given the DVD three stars. To add salt in the wound, the producers added zip, zero, zilch, nada, nothing to this DVD as extras (save for some trailers for a couple other movies that I now intend to avoid). No commentary, no deleted scenes, no behind the scenes...nothing.This one is going to be traded in at the local used movie store.

1012076,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000HC2M0W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Come on, people.  Satanic rituals, demonic possession, telekinesis, witchcraft, cute Catholic schoolgirls - that's a solid foundation for a horror movie right there.  Admittedly, the plot isn't a perfectly healthy specimen, but I enjoyed 5ive Girls.  A lot of people seem to view this film as a The Craft wannabe, but I don't see any substantive connection between the two films - apart from the occult overtones and the fact that both stories revolve around a cast of teenaged girls.  Like most horror films, 5ive Girls does borrow here and there from films that have come before, but I think it succeeds in establishing its own identity.St. Mark's School for Girls used to be a well-respected private school - until one of its students disappeared under extremely unusual circumstances.  We know what happened because it makes up the opening scene of the movie.  Elizabeth (Krysta Carter), an especially faithful young woman, was attacked by no less a demon than Legion himself - and Father Drake (Ron ""the Beast"" Perlman), who may have liked Elizabeth a little too much, was powerless to help her.  The school soon closed in the wake of the tragedy - but now, five years later, it has reopened.  Sort of, anyway.  Under the harsh discipline of Headmistress Miss Pearce (Amy Lalonde), who even seems to have Father Drake by the cojones, it now serves as a sort of reform school for wayward girls.  Apparently, the best way to control an unruly teenager is through intense Latin instruction.  Who knew?The entire student body consists of a mere five girls, all of them dropped off by parents eager to get rid of them.  Apart from the fact that they really aren't bad girls at all, the five have something else in common - each one has a paranormal gift.  Alex (Jennifer Mille) can move things when she's emotional (plus she has the ability to be extremely hot at all times), Leah (Barbara Mamabolo) can walk through certain objects (although we never see her do it), Mara (Jordan Madley) can heal people, Cecilia (Terra Vnesa) can see things in her mind despite the fact that she's blind, and Connie (Tasha May) - actually, I don't know what Connie's gift is (she can whine with the best of them, but that's probably not it).  Anyway, it doesn't take long for the girls to figure out that there is something very wrong with the place.  For one thing, Alex keeps hearing disembodied voices and seeing what can only be the ghost of a former student wandering around.  With a headmistress like Miss Pearce and weird shenanigans going on all over the place, it doesn't take long for the girls to bond with each other - and that's a good thing because before you can say a dozen Hail Marys, they find themselves battling Legion.  Boy, it's a good thing they've got a giant priest around to protect them - or maybe not.The plot is sort of patched together with spit and gum in a few places, but it manages to hold up pretty well until the end.  With all of the action taking place within the confines of a large and somewhat creepy school building, the film maintains a decently disquieting atmosphere, but none of the slightly cheesy special effects are going to knock you for a loop.  It's a little difficult to accept Ron Perlman in the role of a priest, but the acting is pretty good up and down the line.  The story even manages to keep a couple of plot points pretty close to the vest until the closing moments.  5ive Girls will probably appeal more to the younger segment of horror fans, but I quite enjoyed watching it.

Sonoda, 2006)Sonoda (Ham & Cheese) turns in a movie here whose tagline was ""how many Catholic schoolgirls does it take to battle a legion of evil?"". How can you possibly go wrong with Catholic schoolgirls battling the devil? Needless to say, the girls are all gorgeous, and when you add Ron Perlman to the mix I'd be fine with this cast acting out the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Well, the end result ain't all that hot, but come on, how can you not love this? It's kind of like Attack Girls Swim Team vs. the Undead meets Fallen, but with Ron Perlman and a bunch of hot chicks. Oh, yeah.Plot: five girls are sent to a newly-reopened Catholic girls' school. There's Alex (Lucky Number Slevin's Jennifer Miller), whose father believes that here telekinesis means she's possessed by the devil; Mara (The Mad's Jordan Madley), a thief and all-around bad girl; blind Cecilia (Terra Vnesa, recently of Degrassi: The Next Generation), a Tarot card reader; Leah (Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen's Barbara Mamabolo), whose presence here is explained in such a way that I'll let you see for yourself; and Connie (An All American Fairytale's Tasha May Currie), whose parents are trying to turn her away from her embracing of Wicca. On the administrative side of things, we have Father Drake (Perlman), the school's sole teacher, who feels responsible for the disappearance of a student years ago; Miss Pearce (Diary of the Dead's Amy Lalonde), the brutal headmistress who was once a student; and creepy caretaker Vincent (Swamp Devil's James Kidnie), who pops up every once in a while for atmosphere. It doesn't take too long for the girls to realize that they all have some unique and complementary supernatural ability, and also that there's something happening at the school that's very much un-Catholic. The question is, who's on their side and who isn't?Okay, so hot girls who spend at least a decent amount of time naked, the obligatory lesbian undertones (you knew there was a reason I compared this to Attack Girls Swim Team, didn't you?), Ron Perlman as a priest, and the supernatural. All well and good. Better, the acting was actually better than I expected, especially from Vnesa, who brings a fine balance of cockiness and vulnerability to Cecilia. Meanwhile, the plot really is as silly as it sounds, the script condenses more stereotypes than you can shake a stick at into its wonderful premise, and with one exception (that scene with Leah I referred to earlier), the special effects are pretty darned cheesy. In other words, this is not a horror movie that's going to make you jump, but it does have its uses. Looking for a way to kill a Saturday night? This should be on your list of possibilities. ** ",3,"Silly, sexy fun.",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2734,"['5ive', 'Girls', 'Warren', 'P.', 'Sonoda', '2006', 'Sonoda', 'Ham', 'Cheese', 'movie', 'here', 'tagline', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'Catholic', 'schoolgirls', 'take', 'battle', 'legion', 'evil', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Catholic', 'schoolgirls', 'battling', 'devil', 'Needless', 'say', 'girls', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'when', 'add', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'mix', ""'d"", 'be', 'fine', 'cast', 'acting', 'out', 'Encyclopedia', 'Brittanica', 'Well', 'end', 'result', 'ai', ""n't"", 'hot', 'come', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'kind', 'like', 'Attack', 'Girls', 'Swim', 'Team', 'Undead', 'meets', 'Fallen', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'bunch', 'hot', 'chicks', 'Oh', 'yeah.Plot', 'five', 'girls', 'are', 'sent', 'newly-reopened', 'Catholic', 'girls', 'school', 'Alex', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'Jennifer', 'Miller', 'father', 'here', 'telekinesis', 'possessed', 'devil', 'Mara', 'Mad', 'Jordan', 'Madley', 'thief', 'all-around', 'bad', 'girl', 'Cecilia', 'Terra', 'Vnesa', 'recently', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Tarot', 'card', 'reader', 'Leah', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'Barbara', 'Mamabolo', 'presence', 'here', 'explained', 'such', 'way', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'Connie', 'American', 'Fairytale', 'Tasha', 'May', 'Currie', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'turn', 'away', 'embracing', 'Wicca', 'administrative', 'side', 'things', 'have', 'Father', 'Drake', 'Perlman', 'school', 'sole', 'teacher', 'who', 'responsible', 'disappearance', 'student', 'years', 'ago', 'Miss', 'Pearce', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Amy', 'Lalonde', 'brutal', 'headmistress', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'student', 'creepy', 'caretaker', 'Vincent', 'Swamp', 'Devil', 'James', 'Kidnie', 'who', 'up', 'once', 'while', 'atmosphere', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'girls', 'realize', 'have', 'unique', 'complementary', 'supernatural', 'ability', 'also', 'something', 'happening', 'school', 'very', 'much', 'un-Catholic', 'question', 'who', 'side', 'who', ""n't"", 'Okay', 'so', 'hot', 'girls', 'who', 'spend', 'least', 'decent', 'amount', 'time', 'naked', 'obligatory', 'lesbian', 'undertones', 'knew', 'was', 'reason', 'compared', 'Attack', 'Girls', 'Swim', 'Team', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'priest', 'supernatural', 'well', 'good', 'Better', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'especially', 'Vnesa', 'who', 'fine', 'balance', 'cockiness', 'vulnerability', 'Cecilia', 'Meanwhile', 'plot', 'really', 'as', 'silly', 'script', 'more', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'wonderful', 'premise', 'one', 'exception', 'scene', 'Leah', 'referred', 'earlier', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'darned', 'cheesy', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'jump', 'have', 'uses', 'Looking', 'way', 'kill', 'Saturday', 'night', 'should', 'be', 'list', 'possibilities', '**']",5ive Girls
