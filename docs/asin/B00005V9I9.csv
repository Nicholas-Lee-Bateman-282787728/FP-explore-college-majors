It was originally aired on Showtime in 2000, and subsequently shown on Disney Channel many times. Anyone who grew up watching Disney Channel in the early 2000s would appreciate watching this or getting it as a nostalgic gift!It's basically about a 12-year-old boy who experiments with chemicals in hopes of finding a way to keep his dog from aging. No one knew the chemicals seeped into bars of soap, and when the boy's divorced grandparents used the soap, they turned--you guessed it--17 again. They enjoyed the benefits of being young again, hung out around the local high school and got dates, and tried to stay away from each other but ended up getting closer than ever. Meanwhile, their granddaughter, who is identical to the 17-year-old version of the grandmother, is having boy troubles of her own.The story is cute and sweet, and the only way you could not enjoy it is if you tried very hard to bash on it. The music is also pretty good too.",5,"Better than Zac Efron's ""17 Again""",1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,1031,"['Even', 'little', 'predictable', 'Seventeen', 'Again', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'Showtime', '2000', 'subsequently', 'shown', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'many', 'times', 'Anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'early', '2000s', 'would', 'appreciate', 'watching', 'getting', 'nostalgic', 'gift', 'basically', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'chemicals', 'hopes', 'finding', 'way', 'keep', 'dog', 'aging', 'one', 'knew', 'chemicals', 'seeped', 'bars', 'soap', 'when', 'boy', 'divorced', 'grandparents', 'used', 'soap', 'turned', 'guessed', '17', 'again', 'enjoyed', 'benefits', 'being', 'young', 'again', 'hung', 'out', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'got', 'dates', 'tried', 'stay', 'away', 'other', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'closer', 'ever', 'Meanwhile', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'identical', '17-year-old', 'version', 'grandmother', 'having', 'boy', 'troubles', 'own.The', 'story', 'cute', 'sweet', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'not', 'enjoy', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'bash', 'music', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'too']",N/A

This is the prospect explored in this film as a teenage girl's grandmother gets that chance, turning her into a lookalike of said granddaughter (hence the roles of Tia and Tamera Mowry) Grandpa also gets his youth back, and the two oldsters explore their youth and learn quite a bit about themselves and how to fix the marriage that had been on the brink of end before they became young.
