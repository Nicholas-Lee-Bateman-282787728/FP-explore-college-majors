While many of thereviews here are pretty accurate, it's also hard to fault two hours ofthe delicious eye candy given by stars Laura Linney and RomolaGarai...Liam Neeson and Antonio Banderas do a credible job with whatmaterial they have to work with. Unlike the direction, the camera workis excellent, with some brilliant deep closeups. In more skilled hands,this could have been a very good film, but then the plot and scriptwould need be less inane than it is.

Usually he's a brilliant actor who really does a magnificent job with edge of your seat, heart-pumping suspense.  However, thanks to an extremely lousy script, the Other Man is totally horrible.  I can't believe Liam went along with this hogwash.There is no suspense to speak of- just an extremely slow-moving storyline that never does anything at all.It's especially terrible in the beginning when Liam Neeson spends a considerable amount of time on his computer going over clues pertaining to his wife.  I swear the same exact unintereting segments involving his wife in the bedroom with another man repeated twice in a row, almost like a a trick to see if viewers were awake enough to pay attention.I can't honestly recommend anyone watch the Other Man.

1280167,A19HKRB4LU5YR,B002NTDXQ4,"D Jones ""DP Jones""","[17, 20]","Just watched the DVD without having seen the Trailers or previous reviews.  Picked up the movie based on the quality of the actors and the description on the DVD case, a ""gripping suspense thriller"".  Based on the DVD case description we thought we were getting a Hitchcockian type suspense thriller.  Hardly!Plot synopsis:  Happily married couple...wife walks out the door and disappears about ten minutes into movie...husband spends remainder of movie tracking down, dealing with, and coming to terms with the emotional trauma created by ""The Other Man"".  Husband knows why wife disappears from the moment we see her leave in a slow motion shot...no mystery to him at all.  Too bad we are left hanging for the next forty-five minutes.  Her apparent disappearence early on has nothing to do with the plot other than to make us think we are watching a suspense thriller.  No guns, no chases, no violent confrontations, no 180 degree plot twists, and no surprise ending.  In fact, the ending is wierd and beguilling.  In our our view it seems tacked on and somewhat implausable.First rate acting and beautiful locale photography of Milan and Lake Como, Italy, make up, somewhat, for a disjointed plot and some odd film editing.  In the scenes following the wife's disappearance we literally stopped the DVD and wondered if it had skipped ahead a chapter by mistake.  Additionally, if we hadn't spent two years living near Milan and Lake Como we'd loose track of the continuous flashbacks and changes in plot locations.  This is a film requiring your full attention to keep up.Still, if we'd wanted to watch a lushly made ""Lifetime TV"" drama which confusingly unfolds revealing a love triangle, we'd rent this movie.

1280169,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002NTDXQ4,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","It has a talented director, a brilliant cast,and an intriguing premise about a man who discovers that his dead wife was unfaithful.And despite all that, ""The Other Man"" ends up flopping face-first on the ground, with some deeply sloppy direction and a middle section that is pure wheel-spinning. One of the major problems is that it  is a good hour too long for its content, which forces Liam Neeson to wander around looking tortured for long periods of time. He's good at that, but not good enough.Software engineer Peter (Liam Neeson) and shoe designer Lisa (Laura Linney) seem to have the perfect marriage. But after she dies, he finds clues that she may have had a lover -- e-mails, voice-mails, and a cryptic note that just says ""Lake Como."" This discovery throws him into a rage, and he becomes determined to track down and kill her lover.If you're hoping for ""Taken 3,"" be disappointed. He does track down her lover in Milan, a cosmopolitan Spaniard named Ralph (Antonio Banderas) -- and the two men strike up what Ralph thinks is a friendship, playing chess every day at a cafe. As they play, Ralph describes the decade-long love affair with Lisa, and Peter's desire for revenge slowly grows. But is Ralph what he appears?Richard Eyre is actually a very talented director -- he's made movies like ""Notes for a Scandal,"" ""Iris"" and two episodes of ""The Hollow Crown."" But something in ""The Other Man"" has gone completely wrong. Perhaps it's that it feels more like a stage play than a movie, since a good chunk of the narrative is just two men sitting at a table, talking about the women they've both slept with. But ""My Dinner With Andre,"" this ain't.And at times, Eyre's direction feels sloppy and awkward. For instance, there is no time transition between Lisa's life and death -- in one scene she's alive and well, in the next Peter is getting rid of her clothes. No fades, no subtle clues. It's completely baffling and deeply confusing.He also seems to lose his way in the movie's middle, which is mostly comprised of three things:1. Ralph talking about his romance with Lisa, her shoes, their vacations, etc.2. Peter looking angrily at pictures on the computer.3. Chess.And no, it isn't very interesting. It feels like there was a dearth of content between the beginning and the end, so it's filled up with endless chess games, talking and intense staring. There's some halfhearted attempts at introducing tension by having Peter's daughter pop up to complain occasionally, but the only part that is actually intriguing is a rather shocking revelation about Ralph's life.The sad thing is that the wildly talented cast is mostly wasted. Liam Neeson gives a beautifully tormented performance as a man driven by obsession, but at times he seems to lack direction (""GUCCI LOAFERS!""). Banderas gives a pretty heartrending portrayal of a man who seems to be a cosmopolitan rake at first, but is slowly revealed to be a much sadder, lonelier creature.As for the women, their parts are a lot flimsier. Garai is left with nothing to do but yell and whine at Neeson, and Linney is hardly more than a cameo. Oh, and I don't know why the emphasis on Abigail's husband, who is both nondescript and irrelevant.""The Other Man"" might have worked as a shorter movie or perhaps a stage play, but as a full-length movie it falls flat on its face -- and even the excellent actors can't save it.",2,Loses its way,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,3387,"['talented', 'director', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'man', 'who', 'dead', 'wife', 'was', 'unfaithful.And', 'Other', 'Man', 'up', 'flopping', 'face-first', 'ground', 'deeply', 'sloppy', 'direction', 'middle', 'section', 'pure', 'wheel-spinning', 'One', 'major', 'problems', 'good', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'content', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'wander', 'looking', 'tortured', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough.Software', 'engineer', 'Peter', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'shoe', 'designer', 'Lisa', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'seem', 'have', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'clues', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'lover', 'e-mails', 'voice-mails', 'cryptic', 'note', 'just', 'Lake', 'Como', 'discovery', 'rage', 'becomes', 'determined', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'lover.If', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'Taken', '3', 'be', 'disappointed', 'track', 'down', 'lover', 'Milan', 'cosmopolitan', 'Spaniard', 'named', 'Ralph', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'two', 'men', 'strike', 'up', 'what', 'Ralph', 'friendship', 'playing', 'chess', 'day', 'cafe', 'play', 'Ralph', 'decade-long', 'love', 'affair', 'Lisa', 'Peter', 'desire', 'revenge', 'slowly', 'Ralph', 'what', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'actually', 'very', 'talented', 'director', 'made', 'movies', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'Iris', 'two', 'episodes', 'Hollow', 'Crown', 'something', 'Other', 'Man', 'gone', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'movie', 'good', 'chunk', 'narrative', 'just', 'two', 'men', 'sitting', 'table', 'talking', 'women', ""'ve"", 'slept', 'Dinner', 'Andre', ""ain't.And"", 'times', 'Eyre', 'direction', 'feels', 'sloppy', 'awkward', 'instance', 'time', 'transition', 'Lisa', 'life', 'death', 'one', 'scene', 'alive', 'well', 'next', 'Peter', 'getting', 'rid', 'clothes', 'fades', 'subtle', 'clues', 'completely', 'baffling', 'deeply', 'confusing.He', 'also', 'lose', 'way', 'movie', 'middle', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'three', 'things:1', 'Ralph', 'talking', 'romance', 'Lisa', 'shoes', 'vacations', 'etc.2', 'Peter', 'looking', 'angrily', 'pictures', 'computer.3', 'Chess.And', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'was', 'dearth', 'content', 'beginning', 'end', 'filled', 'up', 'endless', 'chess', 'games', 'talking', 'intense', 'staring', 'halfhearted', 'attempts', 'introducing', 'tension', 'having', 'Peter', 'daughter', 'pop', 'up', 'complain', 'occasionally', 'only', 'part', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'rather', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'Ralph', 'life.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'wildly', 'talented', 'cast', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'beautifully', 'tormented', 'performance', 'man', 'driven', 'obsession', 'times', 'lack', 'direction', 'GUCCI', 'LOAFERS', 'Banderas', 'pretty', 'heartrending', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'cosmopolitan', 'rake', 'first', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'be', 'much', 'sadder', 'lonelier', 'creature.As', 'women', 'parts', 'are', 'lot', 'flimsier', 'Garai', 'left', 'nothing', 'do', 'yell', 'whine', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'hardly', 'more', 'cameo', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'emphasis', 'Abigail', 'husband', 'who', 'nondescript', 'irrelevant', 'Other', 'Man', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'shorter', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'stage', 'play', 'full-length', 'movie', 'flat', 'face', 'even', 'excellent', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save']",N/A

1280172,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002NTDXQ4,Grady Harp,"[17, 22]","THE OTHER MAN is a thinking person's film, a film well cast, finely acted, and well written by writer/director Richard Eyre based on a short story by master storyteller Bernhard Schlink ('The Reader', 'Flights of Love' - collection of short stories from which this story is excerpted, etc).  If some viewers find the film confusing or too subtle in the unraveling of a fascinating tale, the problem is that the cast and director and writers demand more of the viewer's attention than in the usual movie fare.  A suspense film should keep the viewer in the dark, or thinking in one direction, until a little twist changes the story that has been unfolding on a different level.  That is what THE OTHER MAN  does and it is a pleasure to be surprised in this way.Peter (Liam Neeson) is a successful business man whose wife Lisa (Laura Linney) is a successful and high profile shoe designer.  He spends much of his life in her shadow but the marriage works for them both and they obviously love each other and their young rambunctious daughter Abigail (Romola Garai) who is attached to the somewhat hippie, strange George (Craig Parkinson).  Lisa's office comrades - Ralph (Patterson Joseph) and Vera (Pam Ferris) - are supportive of both Peter and Lisa and the world seems balanced.  Very early in the film Lisa departs for Milan for another showing of her shoes, but she doesn't return.  Peter grows suspicious when he discovers insinuating email messages from a man named Ralph, and once he discovers this Ralph is not her office comrade, he sets out on a mission to find the source of his wife' surprise infidelity.  He discovers pictures taken in a special hotel in Milan, pictures that reveal photos of 'Ralph' (Antonio Banderas) in intimate situations with Lisa.  Peter travels to Milan with the intent to kill Ralph, stalks him, and discovers his pastime of playing chess in a little Milanese caf&eacute;. And this is where Schlink and Eyre change the twist of the story, and Ralph is not at all whom he appears to be, nor is the direction of Peter's vengeance as focused as we expected.  It is this crucial turn of storyline that make this film so endearing and to suggest, even slightly, the final moments of this film would destroy the suspense so well written and directed and acted.Neeson, Linney, Banderas, and Garai are all splendid in these difficult roles - Linney continues to mature as an actress while becoming ever more beautiful in countenance. This is a tightly drawn suspense tale and well worth the attention of the  public unafraid to think along with the development of the story.

The description said it was a suspense thriller.  Well, there's no thrill to it, and the only suspense is trying to figure out what the heck is going on.

and, i don't know when she knew she had a health problem--did she know on the day she met the other man with her red shoes on?SHE DID TRY TO ELUDE HIM BUT HE OFFERED FUN AND CARE-FREE-NESS.so, there are questions about this one scene missing from this 'real-life' drama, including  the fact that she was a young woman, but that doesn't mean the ""experience"" the movie delivers was not a good one. the whole movie was about a man finding out that his wife was not what he thought she was but then in the end somehow peter is trying to tell us something about forgiveness and going on and accepting life as it is ...but still with the question; why did she want my ""lesser"" over me, or, like he asked, ""why did she roll in lust with him for a day but not with me, what does this all mean?'well, she was a travelling 'salesman' and it happens. she totally redeems herself with me, because i was so angry at her kind of woman for doing what she did to a good man..., but i know what it is like to be a young woman in her position, but she totally redeems herself with me because she returned to her marriage. she returned to her husband the real man. she felt sorry for the other man; he had time to play in bed, and all that jazz; but these two married people were employers with other people's lives as their responsibilitity; they could not afford to go chasing turtles.Lisa stopped her 'real' life to go play with a 'nome'...but she acted responsibly and returned to her life and told him not to call. i feel that redeems her and i liked peter's revenge and i liked peter's choice to not act like a real fool and kill him as if this 'nome' was his real competition. i loved peter at the end but i would not marry peter because he is totally carrying a torch i think, for the rest of his days. but there are graceful women out there who can make life beautiful for him faithfully.BUT WAIT....that redemption i gave lisa has just caved. why on earth did she find it necessary to tell peter during her dying days about the other man?

Even better, the plot is less about revenge, thrills, or the sneaky subterfuge of an affair and more about the mental torment that comes from wondering what love is, whether it's enough, and why different people can offer much different (perhaps still much needed?) sources of comfort and solace. It's very much a psychological exploration of what we demand of others, whether we should demand it, and if it is such a terribly bad thing if one single person can't be every single thing we need at every single moment. In that sense, it's not a conventional dissection of most love-related stories, which offer up the saccharine, cliched concepts of Love-Is-All-You-Need & One-True-Love-For-Everyone. I applaud the film for its performances and for its brave attempt to fully examine the thorny idea of what love really and truly is, minus all of our Hallmark card declarations.Unfortunately, the movie is ruined by a schizophrenic sense of tone and truly disastrous editing. Linney's character disappears about ten minutes into the film in one of the most disorienting scene changes I've seen in a film, and where she's been and what she's done is treated as some kind of dark, tantalizing secret. It would've been far, far better if the film had taken these lame-brain ""revelations"" (they happen rapid-fire about fifteen minutes before the closing credits) and had gone traditional time-line with them. Playing mum with them is the film's way of pretending to be some kind of thriller, but this is not a thriller-type story, and treating these secrets as if they are profound or game-changing is a childish move. It is like trying to turn a straight-faced film about a funeral into a comedy solely by playing Weird Al Yankovic in the background.The end result is that the audience is so baffled by what's going on that it becomes hard to invest in any of the characters since you can't be entirely sure what they've done or what's happened. Neeson's delicate portrayal of a tortured husband becomes a confusing pastiche of tirades and actions that audiences naturally assume are clues as to where his wife has mysteriously disappeared. Banderas's secretive lover ends up seeming more complex as an antagonist and more simplistic as ""the other man,"" but this is the opposite of what the film really wants in the end. Ultimately, by treating Linney's character as a mere Macguffin, the film robs the audience of a deep psychological portraiture of both men, trying lamely to reduce their story to some kind of half-hearted mystery with an illicit sexual tryst as both its core and only red herring.

He is silly, superficial and living in a fantasy world. The more Neeson's (Peter) character discovered about Ralph the easier it became to deal with the adulterous relationship. What began as Peter's rage and obsession to both uncover the details of the illicit affair and kill Ralph gradually changed to mocking ridicule, and ultimately pity and understanding. It was interesting to see Banderas go against his usual casting and play such a loser.This is not a good suspense story (figured out what was happening pretty quickly) and it isn't a particularly rich character study, but I also didn't think it was the worst movie ever made.

The basic idea is quite interesting: how a man takes his beautiful wife for granted and then discovers after her death that she has had an other side.  I think that what the film lacks is why the woman, Lisa, played by the wonderful Laura Linney, would have an affair with such a cheesy operator as Ralph, played perfectly by Antonio Banderas.  In thinking about it, I suppose we are to see that Peter, (Liam Neeson, also wonderful) is a self centered, snobbish man who doesn't give his daughter any time and disapproves of her ratty looking boyfriend. (Which seems perfectly natural to anyone who is used to men shaving and combing their hair.) It's just that Neeson is such a honey of a man that he doesn't project arrogance or snobbery well enough here.So Lisa has her own little revenge: she leaves just a hint that the happiest place she ever was, was not with her faithful loving husband, but with the absurd lover.  It's really a stretch to understand how Lisa could have endured more than a few hours with this turkey but apparently he was persistent and charming and I guess something happens to American women who travel in Italy...Maybe it's the water?The plot really doesn't work in the film.

After seemingly successful 25 year marriage and a wonderful daughter, husband(Neeson) looses his wife (Linney) to cancer.  Overwhelmed by grief he stumbles by accident on his wife's secret life that includes handsome lover living in Milan, Italy. It is a rude awakening and realization that perhaps their marraige is not what it seemed and their love was only one sided.What makes this story weak is that the lover (Banderas) is such a bafoon in spite of his fancy suit and impeccable haircut, not to mention olive skin.  His pretencious name is not help either.  It is what makes story unlikely  - that a woman of beauty, grace and imagination who seemingly has it all, would embark on a love affair half a world away from her home with a man that has sketchy history and almost no personality.Perhaps if the story was presented as a successful marriage of the two professional people, where once wife gets sick she wants to protect her family from loss by keeping the truth away from them. Not wishing to disturb her husband's important job and career and her daughter's new marriage, she finds a substitute of sorts, with whom she can recapture some happiness without affecting ones she likes most (hence across the world romance).  The affair would reaffirm her zest for life, confirm her desirability as a woman in spite of her terminal illness and provide some carefree release for her that will have no consequence since it can remain a secret.For whatever reason, I have not perceived film to go in that direction and that is what left it feeling with no purpose, no magic and no conviction.",2,Movie fails due to implausable story,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1698,"['Three', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'Banderas', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'two', 'great', 'performances', 'Linney', 'Neeson', 'seemingly', 'successful', '25', 'year', 'marriage', 'wonderful', 'daughter', 'husband', 'Neeson', 'wife', 'Linney', 'cancer', 'Overwhelmed', 'grief', 'accident', 'wife', 'secret', 'life', 'handsome', 'lover', 'living', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'rude', 'awakening', 'realization', 'perhaps', 'marraige', 'not', 'what', 'seemed', 'love', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'sided.What', 'story', 'weak', 'lover', 'Banderas', 'such', 'bafoon', 'spite', 'fancy', 'suit', 'impeccable', 'haircut', 'not', 'mention', 'olive', 'skin', 'pretencious', 'name', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'what', 'story', 'unlikely', 'woman', 'beauty', 'grace', 'imagination', 'who', 'seemingly', 'would', 'embark', 'love', 'affair', 'world', 'away', 'home', 'man', 'sketchy', 'history', 'almost', 'personality.Perhaps', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'successful', 'marriage', 'two', 'professional', 'people', 'where', 'once', 'wife', 'sick', 'protect', 'family', 'loss', 'keeping', 'truth', 'away', 'Not', 'wishing', 'disturb', 'husband', 'important', 'job', 'career', 'daughter', 'new', 'marriage', 'substitute', 'sorts', 'whom', 'can', 'recapture', 'happiness', 'affecting', 'ones', 'most', 'hence', 'world', 'romance', 'affair', 'would', 'reaffirm', 'zest', 'life', 'confirm', 'desirability', 'woman', 'spite', 'terminal', 'illness', 'provide', 'carefree', 'release', 'will', 'have', 'consequence', 'can', 'remain', 'secret.For', 'reason', 'have', 'not', 'perceived', 'film', 'go', 'direction', 'what', 'left', 'feeling', 'purpose', 'magic', 'conviction']",N/A

It seems to be made up of footage haphazardly collected from the cutting room floor. The movie is supposed to be based on a respected novel - but something apparently got lost in translation from one medium to the other.For one thing, you might soon find yourself wondering what Antonio Banderas' character is supposed to be. Is he a gigolo - a janitor - a petty moocher - a hospital orderly - an international sophisticate - or a true romantic? This disjointed multiplicity doesn't reflect any intelligent complication of character. No, it's a simple lapse into messiness. We see Banderas' character flash from one of these personas to the next without any adequate segue.In a director's commentary that is more intelligent and interesting than the film itself, there is still no adequate explanation of these abridgements.Finally, the central performance in this mishmash, Liam Neeson's portrayal of a jealous husband, is emotionally inauthentic.

It's better than many other, more highly regarded films.Liam Neeson plays Peter, who is devastated by the absence of his wife, played by Laura Linney.  Their daughter Abigail (Romola Garai) is romantically involved with George (Craig Parkinson).  George is detested by Peter, who believes the scruffy George is not good enough for his daughter.In going over items left by his wife, Peter discovers that his wife may have been having an affair with an Italian man named Ralph (Antonio Banderas).  He resolves to go to Milan and confront the other man.The other reviewers who were in general unkind to the film were off the mark.  Neeson does an excellent job (as always) portraying the hurt and the loss a man might feel if another man was in love with his wife.  Linney is also very good as a woman who decides to give into temptation.  (The reasons for her transgression are unclear, since she seems to have had a good 25-year marriage to Peter, although later developments may shed some light on that hurtful decision.)  The film is beautifully photographed, the locations in London and Italy are gorgeous, and the plot is believable to a great extent.There is a huge plot twist near the end of the film, that gives the viewer some insight into what has really been going on between the two protagonists (Neeson and Linney).  There is a minor plot twist that involves Banderas that is a bit amusing and also a bit sad.  There is a turtle involved, believe it or not.Recommended.

Some beautiful filming locations and Liam Neeson's driven seriousness cover for some questionable writing and a poor non-lineal approach to the storytelling.The story follows a husband who stumbles upon his wife's indiscretion via her computer, and proceeds to find, stalk and confront the man who cheated with her. Banderas overplays horribly his role as the suave artist that exaggerates his lot in life, coincidentally the ploy that makes Linney fall in love with him. As the story leapfrogs between past events and present day, we see how things have come to be and if mistakes can be forgiven.SPOILER: Normally I do not do ""twists"" but this is given to you 9 minutes into the film - plus the ads and trailers hint to this: He does all of this research and stalking as a widower. Linney disappears a few minutes into the film and only reappears through flashbacks and naked pictures for the remainder.

I will not provide a rehash of the plot (other reviewers have already done this) but will focus on the specific deficiencies.Whether due to faulty editing or a failed attempt at artistry, the continuity of the plot has serious problems. There are jumps of time and location which simply do not make sense. In more skillful hands, discordant chronology may be a valuable feature (Memento), but here it is simply confusing. At one point, I, like another reviewer, became convinced that my DVD was defective and a portion of the movie had been deleted. Such sloppiness is distracting, disappointing, and inexplicable.The concept that people are not as they may seem is, in more skillful hands, a wonderful plot twist. Here, however, it was presented in a heavy handed, cartoonish way. Each of the main characters at times demonstrates a lifestyle or behavior that is not just unexpected but jarringly inappropriate and impossible to believe. SPOILER: I can possibly accept that the sweet, gentle husband is prone to loud, profane, violent outbursts....but for the suave, ladies man to actually be a penniless, tortoise-rescuing janitor??? Come on, why is this necessary? How does this advance the plot in any way? It is a childish, simplistic twist without any redeeming merit. END of SPOILERCharacter development is virtually non-existent. Why do these people behave as they do, especially when their behavior is so ""out of character""? These revelations could have been the best part of the movie, but sadly are ignored.People appear and disappear from distant locations with no time or effort required. The daughter is at home in England one minute, in Italy the next, back home in the next few seconds. The wife appears and disappears with no adequate explanation (until it really doesn't matter). I hate it when directors and writers ignore practical constraints of time and distance. Reality can jar a viewer's emotions, but ignoring reality merely jars their intelligence.Granted, the cinematography, acting, locations, etc. were excellent. However, the heart of any movie is its plot, and if there are serious, jarring deficiencies in the plot, the movie simply has no heart.

And they both did in agreeing to take part in this film.The plot develops around Liam Neeson discovering his wife has had an affair with Mr Banderas, who comes acros unconvincing and almost lacking direction from the start. It transpires he is a bit of a con man and so you start to think that is why he seemed so translucently insincere, but alas no as when he is genuiniely showing emotion that same chasm of unbeliveablity opens up.As another reviewer has said the 'plot twist' is badly timed leading one to think what was the ruddy point.

As a result there is no build up of empathy with any of the characters and I was left feeling a bit cheated, if you are a fan of the actors then it is worth a punt otherwise it is probably worth avoiding.",2,Straight to DVD in the UK.,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1179,"['only', 'write', 'echo', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'was', 'straight', 'DVD', 'watching', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'two', 'impressive', 'lead', 'men', 'shape', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'primarily', 'why', 'watched', 'make', 'mistakes', 'did', 'agreeing', 'take', 'part', 'film.The', 'plot', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'discovering', 'wife', 'had', 'affair', 'Mr', 'Banderas', 'who', 'acros', 'unconvincing', 'almost', 'lacking', 'direction', 'start', 'bit', 'con', 'man', 'so', 'start', 'think', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'translucently', 'insincere', 'when', 'genuiniely', 'showing', 'emotion', 'same', 'chasm', 'unbeliveablity', 'up.As', 'reviewer', 'said', ""'plot"", 'twist', 'badly', 'timed', 'leading', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'ruddy', 'point', 'slow', 'drama', 'never', 'really', 'issues', 'Liam', 'Nessons', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'result', 'build', 'up', 'empathy', 'characters', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'cheated', 'are', 'fan', 'actors', 'then', 'punt', 'otherwise', 'probably', 'worth', 'avoiding']",N/A
1280199,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002NTDXQ4,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","Peter (Liam Neeson) and Lisa (Laura Linney) have been married for more than 25 years. Lisa is a successful shoe designer and they have a daughter Abigail (Romola Garai). One day, however, Peter discovers a message left in his wife's cell phone, and later, many photos in her PC, including ones in which she poses naked. Peter is determined to find ""the other man"" (Antonio Banderas), the voice on the other side of the phone.The storyline itself is rather conventional, but ""The Other Man"" is not exactly a thriller or suspense in a traditional sense. The film employs many flashbacks so that audiences are not allowed to know some major important things about the characters until the final chapter. Here detective work means not only finding out who does (or did) what; it is more about who they are, by contrasting several images of them. This is not very surprising as the film is directed by Richard Eyre of ""Iris"" fame.While the intention is understandable, however, ""The Other Man"" is a huge disappointment. Flashbacks don't interest us; it only confuses. The events seem to take place in a disjointed order, and some of the actions taken by the main characters are just impossible, as if parodying the rules of the genre the film is based on. (Do you name your file, like, ""LOVE""?) Of course, things are explained in the final 20 minutes, but sorry, it just doesn't convince.As a domestic drama, too ""The Other Man"" lacks logical character development. Liam Neeson's character Peter sometimes looks terribly depressed, then terribly angry and always intense, looking glum and asking for a gun in his office. Richard Eyre did a far better job in ""Notes on a Scandal"" where characters are certainly tense, but still believable.",2,"Disappointing ""Thriller"" from the Director of ""Notes on a Scandal""",1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,1733,"['Peter', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Lisa', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'more', '25', 'years', 'Lisa', 'successful', 'shoe', 'designer', 'have', 'daughter', 'Abigail', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'Peter', 'message', 'left', 'wife', 'cell', 'phone', 'later', 'many', 'photos', 'PC', 'including', 'ones', 'naked', 'Peter', 'determined', 'find', 'other', 'man', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'voice', 'other', 'side', 'phone.The', 'storyline', 'rather', 'conventional', 'Other', 'Man', 'not', 'exactly', 'thriller', 'suspense', 'traditional', 'sense', 'film', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'audiences', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'major', 'important', 'things', 'characters', 'final', 'chapter', 'Here', 'detective', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'contrasting', 'several', 'images', 'not', 'very', 'surprising', 'film', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'Iris', 'intention', 'understandable', 'however', 'Other', 'Man', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Flashbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'interest', 'only', 'events', 'seem', 'take', 'place', 'disjointed', 'order', 'actions', 'taken', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'impossible', 'parodying', 'rules', 'genre', 'film', 'based', 'Do', 'name', 'file', 'LOVE', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'explained', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'sorry', 'just', ""n't"", 'convince.As', 'domestic', 'drama', 'too', 'Other', 'Man', 'logical', 'character', 'development', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'Peter', 'sometimes', 'terribly', 'depressed', 'then', 'terribly', 'angry', 'always', 'intense', 'looking', 'glum', 'asking', 'gun', 'office', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'certainly', 'tense', 'still', 'believable']",N/A

That and the cast comprising Laura Linney and Liam Neeson (there's also Antonio Banderas and Romola Garai) convinced me to rent this movie which turned out to be a disappointing and lackluster viewing experience. Liam Neeson and Laura Linney portray a couple who seem to be happily married - Lisa is a successful shoe designer and Peter is a well-to-do software designer. Then, quite suddenly, Lisa is out of the picture (her fate is only revealed much later in the movie) and Peter uncovers some unsettling e-mails (together with some very sexy photos) that suggest Lisa has been having an affair with a certain Ralph (Antonio Banderas). Peter manages to track down Ralph in Milan, Italy with the intent of killing this other man - Peter gains Ralph's confidence, barely disguising his disdain for his wife's lover, and over the course of the film (mainly via flashbacks) the fate of Peter's wife is revealed, as is Ralph's true nature, and the relationship between Ralph and Lisa. By this time however, any suspense aspect in the movie has long since faded, leaving me frustrated that I had wasted time on this uninspired movie.I cannot believe that the same director, Richard Eyre, who gave usNotes on a Scandal, directed this tepid domestic drama. It really is merely that - a boring drama about a baffled and irate husband (Neeson) who through the course of the movie tries to understand why his wife betrayed him, and then turns his anger upon his wife's lover. There's a secondary character in the form of Lisa and Peter's adult daughter, played by Romola Garai. She tries to dissuade her father from taking any drastic measures, and spends her time pleading and whining (Ms. Garai can however shine in a role, as evidenced by her performance inI Capture the Castle. Both Neeson and Linney's considerable talents are totally wasted here - their characters are never allowed to truly grow or develop, and Banderas' character seems a mere caricature, which could well have been the intent in the movie. Oh, there's a twist towards the end (having to do with the fate of the absent wife) that is more baffling than disturbing. As for DVD extras - there's a director's audio commentary, cast and crew interviews, and a theatrical trailer. Final verdict - rent if you must - otherwise, I'd advise skipping this.",2,Linney and Neeson are wasted in this insipid 'thriller',1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,2401,"['jacket', 'DVD', 'blurb', 'stating', 'gripping', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'cast', 'comprising', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'also', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'convinced', 'rent', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disappointing', 'lackluster', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'portray', 'couple', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'happily', 'married', 'Lisa', 'successful', 'shoe', 'designer', 'Peter', 'well-to-do', 'software', 'designer', 'Then', 'quite', 'suddenly', 'Lisa', 'picture', 'fate', 'only', 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'Peter', 'uncovers', 'unsettling', 'e-mails', 'together', 'very', 'sexy', 'photos', 'suggest', 'Lisa', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'certain', 'Ralph', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Peter', 'track', 'down', 'Ralph', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'intent', 'killing', 'other', 'man', 'Peter', 'gains', 'Ralph', 'confidence', 'barely', 'disguising', 'disdain', 'wife', 'lover', 'course', 'film', 'mainly', 'flashbacks', 'fate', 'Peter', 'wife', 'revealed', 'Ralph', 'true', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Ralph', 'Lisa', 'time', 'however', 'suspense', 'aspect', 'movie', 'long', 'faded', 'leaving', 'frustrated', 'had', 'wasted', 'time', 'uninspired', 'movie.I', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'same', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'who', 'gave', 'usNotes', 'Scandal', 'directed', 'tepid', 'domestic', 'drama', 'really', 'merely', 'boring', 'drama', 'baffled', 'irate', 'husband', 'Neeson', 'who', 'course', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'wife', 'betrayed', 'then', 'anger', 'wife', 'lover', 'secondary', 'character', 'form', 'Lisa', 'Peter', 'adult', 'daughter', 'played', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'dissuade', 'father', 'taking', 'drastic', 'measures', 'time', 'pleading', 'whining', 'Ms.', 'Garai', 'can', 'however', 'shine', 'role', 'evidenced', 'performance', 'inI', 'Capture', 'Castle', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'considerable', 'talents', 'are', 'totally', 'wasted', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'truly', 'grow', 'develop', 'Banderas', 'character', 'mere', 'caricature', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'intent', 'movie', 'Oh', 'twist', 'end', 'having', 'do', 'fate', 'absent', 'wife', 'more', 'baffling', 'disturbing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'director', 'audio', 'commentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Final', 'verdict', 'rent', 'must', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'advise', 'skipping']",N/A
