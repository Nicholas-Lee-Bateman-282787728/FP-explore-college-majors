Season four has two of my fave episodes of the ENTIRE series, My Malpractice Decision and My Female Troubles. I think those two episodes are the best-written and have great pacing thanks to the talented cast. Heather Graham pops up in a few episodes and even though I don't think she is a strong actress, her role as Molly is quite engaging. I love Sarah Chalke's character Dr. Reed especially this particular season, she got to show her chops. I highly recommend this awesome season.

Don't get me wrong - all eight seasons of Scrubs are great (though I believe the quality of the humor began to decline around season 6), but season 4, in my opinion, is the best of the best.After four years at Sacred Heart, the characters are more developed and the humor reflects that. The story lines are still wonderful, and the fantasy sequences are still hilarious. Season 4 just feels a little more crisp than the other seasons.Favorite episodes include:My CakeMy UnicornMy Ocardial InfarctionMy Hypocritical Oath...actually, it's hard for me to pick and choose any more of these episodes; I love 'em all.",5,Season 4 is the best of the best,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,727,"['Scrubs', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'television.I', 'really', 'believe', 'show', 'came', 'own', 'season', '4', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'eight', 'seasons', 'Scrubs', 'are', 'great', 'believe', 'quality', 'humor', 'began', 'decline', 'season', '6', 'season', '4', 'opinion', 'best', 'best.After', 'four', 'years', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'developed', 'humor', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'Season', '4', 'just', 'feels', 'little', 'more', 'crisp', 'other', 'seasons.Favorite', 'episodes', 'include', 'CakeMy', 'UnicornMy', 'Ocardial', 'InfarctionMy', 'Hypocritical', 'Oath', 'actually', 'hard', 'pick', 'choose', 'more', 'episodes', 'love']",N/A
1006033,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000GPIPTM,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[0, 0]","Many sitcoms become stale after their first few years; the writers run out of new ideas and the actors become disenfranchised with the series.  Such is not the case for Scrubs; while it's first two seasons are definitely the strongest, Season 4 is still extremely well written and acted.  Creator Bill Lawrence and his writing staff are able to keep the characters from getting boring by actually causing things to change at Sacred Heart Hospital while the actors are as funny and into the material as ever.  In fact, I think that Neil Flynn, whose Janitor character should have been a one-trick pony, improves his character each year.J.D. (Zach Braff), Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), and Turk (Donald Faison) are now in their fourth year at Sacred Heart.  While they are far from the scared-out-of-their minds interns they once were, there is still plenty of learning to be done.  They are much more sure of themselves now and their fear of Drs. Cox (John C. McGinley) and Kelso (Ken Jenkins) has decreased, but they still make mistakes and rely on their elder colleagues for support.However, the show isn't just about their medical adventures at the hospital.  Scrubs has always been a good discertation on relationships with many multi-episode arcs dealing with the various characters' new ventures in dating, marriage, and break-up.  The year starts off with Elliot still upset with J.D. over what happened at the end of the previous season.  Throughout Season 3, Elliot had a boyfriend, and J.D. was convinced that he did indeed love her (throughout the first 3 years, the two of them got together at some point each season; this year is the first time they didn't become a couple).  However, after convincing her to break up with him, he realized that all he felt was jealousy that he wasn't in a relationship and a wanting of something he couldn't have.  He then told her that he didn't love her after all, thus breaking her heart.  Unlike many shows (both sitcom and drama), this does not get resolved in the season premiere.  Nor the second episode.  In fact, while J.D. and Elliot begin to mend things by about the 4th or 5th episode, they aren't fully friends again until after the end of the first disc.  Meanwhile, Turk and Carla (Judy Reyes) are now newlyweds, and while they truly love each other, they begin to realize that marriage isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Petty arguments, slight cheating, and having J.D. live with them lead to many problems for the couple.  Other interesting relationship stories deal with Dr. Cox and his ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller), who share the healthiest unhealthy relationship ever to grace television.Of course, there are plenty of great medical stories, such as an arc involving Dr. Molly Clock (Heather Graham), a psychologist who becomes Elliot's mentor, Dr. Doug Murhpy (Johnny Kastl) reaching new levels of incompetance until he finds a branch of medicine that is more right for him, and a revelation about Turk.  Furthermore, this year J.D. and Elliot become Co-Chief Residents and are in charge of the new crop of interns and residents at Sacred Heart.  The crazy ways of keeping them in line are great, and they begin to show that while they are nowhere near as abrasive as Dr. Cox, J.D. and Elliot do not behave in the kind and doting fashion that they themselves believed would make a better teach back in Season 1.All of the characters remain fresh while staying true to their personalities.  J.D. is just as awkward as ever, but he is a much more competant doctor as is slightly adjusting to society.  The Janitor (who still doesn't have a name) continues to branch out and communicate with other characters.  He and Dr. Cox begin an antagonistic relationship while he continues to court Elliot.  Ted (Sam Lloyd) doesn't change much, but the point of his character is that he is unable to overcome his crippling nervousness, and hey, that's how we love him.  And ""The"" Todd Quinlan (Robert Maschio) is just as lewd and crude as ever, but the women of the hospital continually find new ways to put him in his place.While there aren't as many stand-out episodes as in previous seasons, Season 4 plays out like one big story in a sense.  Overall, the episodes are fairly episodic to the point where most have plots that are wrapped up within the half hour, though they have enough serialization for the relationships and revelations to impact future stories.  Though, that's not to say that Season 4 is devoid of knock-outs.  Such episodes include ""My First Kill"", where all of the actors who played patients that died on J.D.'s watch return, ""Her Story"", which is narrated by Elliot, ""My Cake"", where J.D. faces a personal tragedy, ""My Best Moment"", where one patient is able to take all of the characters to their lowest, and then their highest points, ""My Life in Four Cameras"", which is shot like a traditional sitcom and serves to parody/pay tribute to four-camera sitcoms like Cheers, and ""My Changing Ways"", the season finale that shakes up the status quo of the show.  By the end, at least two major changes have occurred that make things very different in Season 5.",5,Still Healthy After Four Years,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,5142,"['Many', 'sitcoms', 'become',

1006037,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000GPIPTM,Brett Corkins,"[3, 3]","I've been a devoted Scrubs fan from the get-go. It's common knowledge that their distinct brand of comedy and touching moments never fails to amaze. However, on season 4 we see the comedy come more to the forefront. But where season 3, I thought, felt a little overdramatic at times, season 4 doesn't touch on real heartbreaking moments much which does disappoint me a little. As the writers have said, they pride themselves on making things feel real, so I find it difficult to believe that working in a hospital filled with dying people that a marriage on the rocks is more important. However, it is a good and engaging storyline throughout the season.Season 3 ended with quite the cliffhanger in which JD broke Eliot's heart. It takes a few episodes for her to forgive but I would've liked her to have held the grudge a bit longer. Other than that, both JD and Eliot move on to different people, Cox and Jordan are still together, and Turk and Carla (of course) are still holding strong. As for the janitor and Bob Kelso, they keep their usual antics up. Dr. Kelso's 'return to being a real doctor' episode surprised me though. It's hilarious but also kind of makes you look at him as more than a ball-breaker. And the janitor really pursues his crush on Eliot which is pretty funny.With the focus seemingly strongly fixed upon comedy this time around, they came out strong. Season 3 was funny but I didn't find myself quoting it randomly like I did with 1 & 2. That magic is back thankfully. But it is a shame that there's such few touching moments. Molly Shannon's appearance was excellent with her performance showing true vulnerabilty. Past that, we can only hope season 5 can marry the two as successfully as the first two seasons did. Newcomers need not start here, go back to the beginning because you'll be lost if you start here. I'm wholly impressed with this release and Scrubs remains my favorite show on TV.

1006038,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000GPIPTM,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","A lot of people say Scrubs peaked in season 2 or 3, but honestly I really don't see any downturn in quality this season. In fact, it's as good as it's ever been at this point. How can you not love a season in which the janitor winds up in a singing duel with Ted?In this season, J.D, Turk, and Elliot enter their last year of residency, and Carla and Turk enter their first year of marriage. After three years of equilibrium, though, marriage has changed a few things for our usually solid couple. In ""Her Story"" Carla decides that she is tired of Turk waking her up every night and that they will begin going to bed at the same time. She decides to enforce this rule, though, in front of Turk's friends while they are in the middle of watching a sporting event, putting Turk on the spot. The problems get much more serious than sleep schedules as the season wears on, but the pair work things out in the end. On the other end of the marital stability scale, Jordan and Dr. Cox are horrified to find out they are still married, in spite of the fact that they now have a toddler together and have managed to work out some kind of domestic tranquility. They are one of those real-life couples that get along forever as long as the ""forever"" is not in writing.Scrubs has always had pretty good Christmas episodes, and this season was no exception. ""My Best Moment"" has J.D. addressing a group of pre-med students when one of them asks him what his best moment in medicine was. It gets him thinking about his best moment, and he challenges the staff to do the same. As a result we are treated with some hilarious flashbacks of best moments whose only relationship to medicine are that they occurred in or near a hospital. The serious part of the episode is that a young single father has just been admitted, he is ""circling the drain"" to quote Cox, and the staff doesn't know what the problem is. They all work together to bring the man back to health, and later we see them revisiting their tales of their best moment in medicine, except this time it is this young man's illness and recovery that is at the center of each of their stories.Although the season was excellent overall, there was one subplot that continually annoyed me, that being Turk's initial diagnosis of type two diabetes and the subsequent storylines involving it. I know this show must have medical consultants on staff, yet this is the most unrealistic treatment this particular disease could possibly receive. Basically Turk is just portrayed as someone who can never have another piece of chocolate cake. However, beer, extra-large pizzas, and other assorted high-carb treats are consumed by him without restraint. Since diabetes is a disease of carbohydrate metabolism, this is completely unrealistic. Not to mention the fact that he is a surgeon, with this disease possibly having devastating effects on his eyesight and nervous system and thus  the potential to wreck his entire career. It was touching, though, to see Carla comforting Turk about the disease, declaring herself a W.O.D - wife of diabetic - and telling him how she is alway online with other ""W.O.D.'s"", bragging about how proud she is of him.Finally, there is the issue of J.D. and Elliot. When we left these two last season, Elliot had just K.O'd J.D. after he (a) told her to break up with Sean and be with him instead and then (b) realized that this is not what he wanted AFTER she had already dumped Sean. Naturally, the two have problems after this little episode, which isn't helped by the fact that they are made co-chief residents and have to share one tiny office.

One of the best shows on TV continues to grow with its characters and clever script, storylines and even better special effects being used in the fantasy scenes than ever before.Season four kicks off with Elliot and JD being made joint co chiefs and still not talking to each other after JD convinced Elliot to dump her boyfriend then decided he wasn't in love with her at the end of last season.  Throughout this great year Turk learns he has diabetes and along with Carla question their marriage, the Janitor gets a new uniform and finally gets his fantasy of going on a date with ""Blond Doctor"" (Elliot).  Dr Cox is forced to ride along with an annoying paramedic as well as help his life long rival/best friend with the disability neither wants his son to have, JD moves out to give the honeymooners space, has a girlfriend who won't sleep with him and loses his father. Dr Doug Murphy (nervous guy) finds his true calling and a hot psychiatrist character is introduced to the Sacred Heart team. Another sensational must see season!Guest starts in this season include Heather Graham, Matthew Perry, Molly Shannon, Tara Reid, Tom Cavanagh and his fellow Ed star Josh Randall as well.  The extras are as always entertaining although with Donald Keeps Talking, well he probably kept talking for a little long, the return of two audio commentaries (one with Zach Braff the other Sarah Chalke) for those of us with region 4 Pal DVDs was excellent as they were sorely missed from Season 3, although I would have liked a few more like came with the first two seasons.  The deleted scenes were brilliant, as was the feature Who is the Man? The mystery of who exactly is the janitor is explored by the director, shows creators, writers and of course Neil himself.  Sweethearts of Sacred Heart is also a must see exploring the different relationships between the characters on the show including JD and Turk.  Will You Ever be My Mentor is a fascinating look at JD's relationship with and struggle to be praised and get that elusive hug from his mentor Dr Cox. The Weapons Chest was probably the most fascinating and entertaining of all this season's extras looking at the minor characters that just give Scrubs that little extra such as Todd, Jordan, Ted, nervous guy etc. Don't really know what the point of the music video Half was by G Tom Mac, it was probably a song used in the show but the songs not that interesting on its own would have preferred some bloopers instead.Get all the Season collections of Scrubs on DVD.  These collections are both a benchmark for both what a comedy show should be and what any TV show should be putting out in extras.

1006048,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000GPIPTM,Kaya Savas,"[12, 12]","REVIEW: Scrubs, a half hour of brilliant comedy and drama (not necessarily in that order) that has continued to break new ground and give us fresh entertainment in its entire 5 years so far. If you don't know the backbone of the show then read my past review of season 3 for a better in depth analysis of it. In a nutshell, Scrubs follows four friends working as doctors in a hospital as they navigate the ups and downs of love, friendship, and life overall. Season 4 continues in tradition and delivers the goods as we've come to expect. This season is really focused on the love relationships of our characters, and it has so much room to work with since the characters have already been firmly established. Heather Graham is the main guest star of this season and actually spends a few episodes with the show and creates a pretty great character, it wasn't like last season where we had some big stars stay for only 1 or 2 episodes.Another part of the season I liked was that they spent lots of time fleshing out the Janitor character, and while we will always know him as the Janitor we now know a lot more about him as a human being. Neil Flynn who plays the Janitor actually gave a very touching performance in one episode where we see the true side of him.I am proud to admit that Scrubs is the only show that makes me laugh and cry, many times in the same episode. Scrubs hold dear to many fans' hearts and is truly a special show. It has top notch writing that practically anybody can relate to, very loveable characters, hilarious moments, and real human emotion. You can imagine how mad I was when Zach Braff announced that the upcoming sixth season that will air in January 2007 may be his last. He apparently wants to do directing full time, even though only a short while back in an interview he said that he would never leave Scrubs and do directing in the off season. Hopefully he will reconsider and give us 2 more years at least, the show has not shown any signs of slowing down and is still fresh entertaining television. In a mess of mostly horrible network shows, Scrubs shines the brightest.VIDEO: Scrubs is still filmed in 4:3 and that is how it is presented. The picture quality is excellent though, on par with last season and much improved over the first 2 seasons.AUDIO: The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is excellent too. The dialogue is concentrated to the center channel, and the ambient noise of the hospital designated to the surround speakers. The music in 5.1 is great too, and since the music in the show is used for emotional enhancement it makes the experience better.SPECIAL FEATURES: The past seasons of Scrubs have been excellent when it comes to special features. We had featurettes that explored every aspect of the series and they were greatly entertaining and informative. This season is the first season that shows that they are running out of stuff to talk about, but I am not saying this in a negative way at all. The set has more special features than the average TV show DVD, but it's noticeably less than what we're used to. Still, what we have here is great stuff. We have a featurette on JD's relationship with Dr.Cox, a featurette on the foxy female characters, and a one on one talk with Donald Faison (in tradition with the past sets). The ""Weapons Chest"" featurette talks about the show's secondary characters (Janitor, Jordan, Ted, etc) and how these characters are the weapons that the writers use to fill in empty pockets in the storyline to add humor. The last featurette is appropriately about the Janitor and how this season we explored his character more than before. We finish off the set with some deleted scenes, alternate lines, and a music video. The only thing I am mad that they didn't include this time around were bloopers, and I know there were bloopers from this season.BOTTOM LINE: Scrubs is one of a kind, and it is being treated like scum by NBC. For season 5 and the upcoming season 6, NBC pushed Scrubs as a mid-season filler for shows that fail. It's awful that they treat their best show as a last resort. Why ABC doesn't have Scrubs is beyond me, the show is produced and distributed by Buena Vista, so send it to ABC where it belongs and will be treated well. I hope Zach Braff does not leave, it would be a travesty to kill the show now when it is in full gear.

1006056,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000GPIPTM,Robert Moore,"[14, 19]","SCRUBS has been a model of consistency in its five seasons--and to interrupt myself, why aren't we anticipating Season Five instead of Season Four? And boo! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on DVD!--and Season Four is no exception. I recently rewatched Seasons 1 through 3 on DVD with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present. If you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn't as good as it used to be, but I would be dishonest if I said that I detected any decline. One thing I've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies, this one really does have an overall story arc, and I really appreciate Bill Lawrence and Co. taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way.The story in Season Four revolves largely around the very, very gradual repair of the friendship between JD and Elliott. Fans of the show know that at the end of Season Three JD, utterly smitten by Elliott, had expressed his love for her, causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with JD. No sooner had he done this, however, he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her. Season Four opens with her filled with hatred of him, complicated by the fact that she and he are named co-chief residents (though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads--thanks to Janitor--""Chief Resident"" and his misleadingly reads ""Co-Chief Resident,"" causing many to imagine that she is over him). Some of my favorite visuals in the series are of JD and Elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office, barely large enough for the desk they face each other across. Of course, eventually they patch things up, but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement. Given the intensity of the events of the ends of Season Three, any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with Elliott murdering JD. The season ends with Carla and Turk urging JD to move out and get a place of his own, which leads to an interesting roommate situation in Season Five.Season Four continued the SCRUBS tradition of having some very high profile guest stars. This was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful Colin Farrell on one episode, an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored (there have been very few bad episodes of SCRUBS, but this episode ranks near the bottom). The always delightful Heather Graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season. Matthew Perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father, Jonathan Bennett Perry, a country singer best known to most people as the Old Spice sailor. Tara Reid puts in another appearance as JD's terrible sometimes girlfriend while Molly Shannon is in another episode. And Julianna Margulies of ER appears in a couple of episodes.The great tragedy with SCRUBS is that it remains something of a secret. The only comedy better than SCRUBS in the past few years has been ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well, and the lead of each show appeared on the other, Zach Braff as the producer of the GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM series of videos on AR and Jason Bateman as a patient on SCRUBS) and while it won a large number of awards, its ratings were worse than SCRUBS. This show has decent ratings, but shockingly few awards. How terrible shows like EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and the formerly good but now dull WILL AND GRACE beat it out for awards is mystifying. And how did it manage only one Emmy nomination? It was nominated for Best Comedy Series, but why wasn't Zach Braff nominated for Best Comic Actor and John C. McGinley and Donald Faison for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Sarah Chalke for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series? How is that possible? Much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 Emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory (Lauren Graham yet again not nominated, though clearly the best comic actress on TV for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her; LOST not nominated; no nominations for VERONICA MARS; Jason Lee not nominated for MY NAME IS EARL; neither Michael Chiklis, Hugh Laurie, nor James Gandolofini nominated for Best Actor, while Martin Sheen who was barely appeared in this year's WEST WING; while shows way, way, way, way past their prime like WILL AND GRACE and THE WEST WING nominated; and the list goes on) but Zach Braff's failure to be nominated while Charlie Sheen and Kevin James did is just one more reason not to take the Emmys seriously at all. At least the Golden Globes more or else get it right.Anyway, awards aside, and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the Emmys (how many Emmy nods did BUFFY get despite most of the nation's best TV critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved), fans of the show will be delighted with Season Four and if you aren't a fan, you should be. But don't start with Season Four. Go back and do it right. Either buy or rent (I recommend buying--you'll want to watch this more than once) Season One, then work your way forward. Many pleasurable hours will result.",5,The SCRUBS gang turns out yet another outstanding season,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,5361,"['SCRUBS', 'been', 'model', 'consistency', 'five', 'seasons',

1006060,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000GPIPTM,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","It's very hard to have a successful fourth season. The first three seasons are spent establishing the characters and the situations with several surprises along the way. If a show has a particular arc, usually the first three seasons are the only ones accounted for. Many shows either crashed and burned in the fourth season or began a decline that left the show a vacant shell of its former self. While some shows have managed to avoid the fourth season curse (Seinfeld being the most notable one), many others have found themselves struggling to come up with new material in the fourth season - including How I Met Your Mother which overcame the slump and The Gilmore Girls which introduced Yale and a terrible boyfriend into the series.After three excellent seasons of Scrubs, the fourth season is the beginning of the end. Most of the episodes aren't egregiously awful, but almost all of them are relying on old tropes and stories that have been sucked dry. Dr. Cox gets stuck with an obnoxious guest star? She has a tragic secret. JD and Elliot are having problems? They will be hilariously pushed together until the JD/Elliot well is again used. None of the characters are capable of surprising the viewer any longer. The first three seasons managed to maintain the illusion of change where Dr. Cox was angry but ultimately warmhearted, JD was immature but learning and Carla and Turk were developing as a couple. These particular character beats have been done so often, that they are wearing thin.The problem with the fourth season is that the show runners need to choose between character development and familiarity. One of the quintessential episodes has Dr. Cox realizing that he never divorced his ex-wife, so they live as a married couple for 20 minutes and then get divorced again in order to stay together as a happy couple. By this episode, it's obvious that the show runners chose familiarity and that easy and weak choice condemned the show (at least this season) to complete stasis.Without development, the characters become unbearable. JD maintains his childish manners but by this point, inexperience is no longer an excuse. His character curdles from a young idealistic doctor into a manipulative sociopath who should have been fired years ago. Dr. Cox has the patience of a saint for putting up with him. His girlfriends keep dumping him for what he considers little mistakes (like going out with another woman to blow off their date) Elliot is still the insecure character while Carla and Turk are having trouble centering the show (especially when they still allow JD to live with them). What makes it worse is the fact that they have marital problems that seem based on Turk suddenly acting like JD. The only thing that's different from previous seasons is the Turk Diabetes story.This has some great moments and it's still Scrubs, but the best days are gone by this point.",3,Sorrow and a sense of overtime,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,2900,"['very', 'hard', 'have', 'successful', 'fourth', 'season', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'spent', 'establishing', 'characters', 'situations', 'several', 'surprises', 'way', 'show', 'particular', 'arc', 'usually', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'accounted', 'Many', 'shows', 'crashed', 'burned', 'fourth', 'season', 'began', 'decline', 'left', 'show', 'vacant', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'shows', 'have', 'managed', 'avoid', 'fourth', 'season', 'curse', 'Seinfeld', 'being', 'most', 'notable', 'one', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'found', 'struggling', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'material', 'fourth', 'season', 'including', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'overcame', 'slump', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'introduced', 'Yale', 'terrible', 'boyfriend', 'series.After', 'three', 'excellent', 'seasons', 'Scrubs', 'fourth', 'season', 'beginning', 'end', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'egregiously', 'awful', 'almost', 'are', 'relying', 'old', 'tropes', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'sucked', 'dry', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'stuck', 'obnoxious', 'guest', 'star', 'tragic', 'secret', 'JD', 'Elliot', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'hilariously', 'pushed', 'together', 'JD/Elliot', 'well', 'again', 'used', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'capable', 'surprising', 'viewer', 'longer', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'managed', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'change', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'was', 'angry', 'ultimately', 'warmhearted', 'JD', 'was', 'immature', 'learning', 'Carla', 'Turk', 'were', 'developing', 'couple', 'particular', 'character', 'beats', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'often', 'are', 'wearing', 'thin.The', 'problem', 'fourth', 'season', 'show', 'runners', 'need', 'choose', 'character', 'development', 'familiarity', 'One', 'quintessential', 'episodes', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'realizing', 'never', 'divorced', 'ex-wife', 'live', 'married', 'couple', '20', 'minutes', 'then', 'get', 'divorced', 'again', 'order', 'stay', 'together', 'happy', 'couple', 'episode', 'obvious', 'show', 'runners', 'chose', 'familiarity', 'easy', 'weak', 'choice', 'condemned', 'show', 'least', 'season', 'complete', 'stasis.Without', 'development', 'characters', 'become', 'unbearable', 'JD', 'childish', 'manners', 'point', 'inexperience', 'no', 'longer', 'excuse', 'character', 'curdles', 'young', 'idealistic', 'doctor', 'manipulative', 'sociopath', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'years', 'ago', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'patience', 'saint', 'putting', 'up', 'girlfriends', 'keep', 'dumping', 'what', 'little', 'mistakes', 'going', 'out', 'woman', 'blow', 'off', 'date', 'Elliot', 'still', 'insecure', 'character', 'Carla', 'Turk', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'centering', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'still', 'allow', 'JD', 'live', 'What', 'worse', 'fact', 'have', 'marital', 'problems', 'seem', 'based', 'Turk', 'suddenly', 'acting', 'JD', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Turk', 'Diabetes', 'story.This', 'great', 'moments', 'still', 'Scrubs', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'point']",N/A
