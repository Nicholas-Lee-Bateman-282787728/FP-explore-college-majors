But Minna's aerobic routine is FUN, FRESH, and EFFECTIVE. About 30 minutes long, it's a mix of aerobics and cute dance steps.

This tape can be used by anybody.  The tape is divided into two workouts: a 30 minute cardio workout and a 30 minute toning workout.  The cardio section is great fun.  Minna combines traditional aerobics moves (like grapevines, V-steps, and jumping jacks) with dancier moves (like salsa lunges, mambos, and cha chas).  This helps those of us with two left feet feel like we're dancing while not overwhelming us.  Minna's cuing is excellent and she is upbeat without being overly perky.  Her two assistants look like their having fun, and I definitely have fun and sweat when doing the workout.The toning workout uses multi-muscle moves to target common problem areas: abs, legs, butt, and arms (for example combing front lateral raises with stationary lunges).  One of Minna's strongest points is that she explains the moves and proper posture.  She also cues very well and prepares you for changes.Included with the video is a 6 week intensive care diet planner which has a sample workout schedule, fit tips, menus, success tips, and nutrition tips.Minna's program is very sensible.  It covers cardiovascular fitness, weight training, and good nutrition which are essential for creating a healthier, confident you.

I used Minna's Fat Eliminator workout for a while and enjoyed her style, so I decided to give the ""Emergency"" workout a shot. I just got it this week and have done the entire video twice. The 30-minute toning portion is great. She combines arms and legs so you do work up a sweat. She's very thorough, covering all of the arm muscles and fatiguing the legs as well. I wish she spent a little more time on the abs, but that's my only complaint. The 30-minute cardio routine is fun, but it will take a few times to get the moves down, including mambos, cha chas, hip shakes, and other salsa-type moves. It requires some concentration which is fine with me, because it makes the workout go quicker. I haven't sweated as much as I do in the Fat Eliminator workout, but I attest that to the fact that I'm still getting used to the moves. Once I become more familiar with the routine, I'm hoping to increase my own intensity and work up a better sweat. Overall, this is a fun cardio and toning program.

581318,A2W30R08QPWM4M,B00005BIG5,"Minnesota Raven ""Viking Vixen""","[45, 54]","I bought this DVD at a super discount store just because the price was right.  I wasn't expecting much but I was surprised that this is a little gem of a DVD.  Having heard the name, Minna, but never seen any of her work I wasn't sure what to expect.  I also am not a fan of gimmicky come on titles such as this one.... you know a &quot;quick fix&quot; solution.What I did like was that it's in two parts, cardio and toning.  I should say I am an experienced exerciser and have been exercising at home exclusively for the last two years.  Prior to that I was a gym junkie and did both cardio and weight lifting on a regular basis.  I use a heart rate monitor to level my performance whenever I work out and I recommend all exercisers who want to really know how they are doing get one as well.  You will be pleasantly surprised at what is really going on.  Don't think because you are feeling tired that you are in the correct heart rate zone or out of it.  You need to see the numbers to really undrestand.  Having said all that I was not able to get my heart rate into my target zone of choice doing the cardio section alone.  I was able to get in the proper zone if this was a second or third cardio segment I was doing but not the first meaning I was already getting fatigued.  Another way I could increase my likelihood of getting into the target zone was to wear the weighted gloves.  I use two pound gloves and had no problem.  As my fitness level improved I found I needed to get something to keep my heart rate in the proper zone and I was not keen on throwing away exercise tapes because I was now in better shape.  My sister on the otherhand is not as experienced as I am and she found that this tape got her heart rate in the target zone right away.  Minna has a good cueing style and her form is excellent.  It doesn't hurt that she looks fantastic so if you like a sculpted look as a an inspiration then she is your girl.The toning section was ok.  It's effective enough for maintaining but if you want growth then you need to supplement.  Again I thought her form was excellent and that's important especially for people who are just starting out.  I use heavier weights and I recommend that people challenge themselves from time to time.  Just because it looks like the presenter is using a 2 or 3 pound weight in a video doesn't mean that's what you should use.  Try going heavier and go down as fatigue sets in.  You will see better results.  It's my opinion that you see lighter weights on video presenters for two reasons: 1) They need to show correct form at all times and it's easier for them if they aren't really working as hard as they could to maintain that control and 2) they don't want to put off beginners who might feel they can't do the workout using large weights.Overall a good workout but experienced exercisers may need to modify.",4,"Good, Solid, Motivating but may not inspire more experienced",1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,2866,"['bought', 'DVD', 'super', 'discount', 'store', 'just', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'surprised', 'little', 'gem', 'DVD', 'Having', 'heard', 'name', 'Minna', 'never', 'seen', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'gimmicky', 'come', 'titles', 'such', 'one', 'know', 'quot', 'quick', 'fix', 'quot', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'two', 'parts', 'cardio', 'toning', 'should', 'say', 'am', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'have', 'been', 'exercising', 'home', 'exclusively', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'Prior', 'was', 'gym', 'junkie', 'did', 'cardio', 'weight', 'lifting', 'regular', 'basis', 'use', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'level', 'performance', 'whenever', 'work', 'out', 'recommend', 'exercisers', 'who', 'want', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'doing', 'get', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'feeling', 'tired', 'are', 'correct', 'heart', 'rate', 'zone', 'need', 'see', 'numbers', 'really', 'undrestand', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'target', 'zone', 'choice', 'doing', 'cardio', 'section', 'alone', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'proper', 'zone', 'was', 'second', 'third', 'cardio', 'segment', 'was', 'doing', 'not', 'first', 'meaning', 'was', 'already', 'getting', 'fatigued', 'way', 'could', 'increase', 'likelihood', 'getting', 'target', 'zone', 'was', 'wear', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'use', 'two', 'pound', 'gloves', 'had', 'problem', 'fitness', 'level', 'improved', 'found', 'needed', 'get', 'something', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'proper', 'zone', 'was', 'not', 'keen', 'throwing', 'away', 'exercise', 'tapes', 'was', 'now', 'better', 'shape', 'sister', 'otherhand', 'not', 'as', 'experienced', 'am', 'found', 'tape', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'target', 'zone', 'right', 'away', 'Minna', 'good', 'cueing', 'style', 'form', 'excellent', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fantastic', 'so', 'like', 'sculpted', 'look', 'inspiration', 'then', 'girl.The', 'toning', 'section', 'was', 'ok', 'effective', 'enough', 'maintaining', 'want', 'growth', 'then', 'need', 'supplement', 'Again', 'thought', 'form', 'was', 'excellent', 'important', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'use', 'heavier', 'weights', 'recommend', 'people', 'challenge', 'time', 'time', 'Just', 'presenter', 'using', '2', '3', 'pound', 'weight', 'video', ""n't"", 'mean', 'what', 'should', 'use', 'Try', 'going', 'heavier', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'fatigue', 'sets', 'will', 'see', 'better', 'results', 'opinion', 'see', 'lighter', 'weights', 'video', 'presenters', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'need', 'show', 'correct', 'form', 'times', 'easier', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'working', 'as', 'hard', 'could', 'maintain', 'control', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'off', 'beginners', 'who', 'might', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'workout', 'using', 'large', 'good', 'workout', 'experienced', 'exercisers', 'may', 'need', 'modify']",Minna - Emergency Workout VHS

She is not annoying, she cues well, and she's gorgeous so it just might give you something to aspire to.  The cardio portion of this DVD is a lot of fun because, even though it's pretty standard aerobics, Minna puts it together in a way that is NOT AT ALL difficult to follow and kind of makes you feel like you're grooving on a dance floor.  The toning section is heavy on the squats and lunges and you use light weights throughout for the arms.  Absolute beginners might start out with no weights and anyone with weak knees needs to be careful here.  Minna is very fit and goes DEEP into those squats and lunges, but if you are out of shape that will hurt you, so don't go as deep.  I'm sure this DVD won't do much for the advanced exerciser, but for everyone else I think it's just wonderful.  You can increase the weights in the toning section as you progress and it's easy to step up the cardio a bit if you focus and USE all of your muscles to get that heart rate up.  A lot of people complain about the quality of the cardio and at first I agreed, but once I got the routine down and really focused on the workout...I got sweaty!

If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises.

Plenty of variety in the exercises to keep you from getting bored, but long enough to feel like you're getting some kind of a workout.",4,Toning workout is a keeper,1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,542,"['Buy', 'DVD', 'toning', 'workout', 'cardio', 'portion', 'okay', 'will', 'need', 'do', 'bare', 'floor', 'lot', 'pivoting', 'turning', 'around', 'dancing', 'not', 'difficult', 'unsafe', 'do', 'carpet', 'Lessig', 'very', 'good', 'cueing', 'reminding', 'proper', 'form.The', 'toning', 'workout', 'one', 'can', 'use', 'while', 'starting', 'lower', 'weights', 'increasing', 'go', 'Plenty', 'variety', 'exercises', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'kind', 'workout']",Minna - Emergency Workout VHS
