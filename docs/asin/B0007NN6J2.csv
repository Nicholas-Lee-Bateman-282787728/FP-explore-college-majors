This version isreally great. It pretty much tells the story of this band from Oklahoma. We sortof know them as this weird indie rock band from ten years ago and also therecent international group that produced The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi. This filmgoes back to the beginning when the Flaming Lips were like a Oklahoma versionof The Butthole Surfers. Scenes with the brothers of Wayne Coyne is likewatching the film Crumb. The scenes with Stephen Drodz using heroin are prettydisturbing and exploitative. It's fun to look at the lineup changes and relivetheir chance success with ""She Don't Use Jelly."" It's fun to watch the madnessof them creating Zairekka, a CD to be played with four boom boxes. Their latersuccess is amazing. They are now as distinguished as bands like REM and RedHot Chili Peppers. Their international reputation is overwhelming. They canonly play the biggest venues in most cities. The Flaming Lips can be seen thisfall on some ocean cruise in the LA Harbor. This is an excellent documentary. Ihope it reaches out further than to Lips fans. IT is for any student of modernmusic. Hopefully it can be watched with the complete Flaming Lips videos.",5,brutally honest,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,1303,"['film', 'been', 'works', 'few', 'years', 'saw', 'earlier', 'version', 'thanks', 'director', 'Bradley', 'Beesley', 'was', 'half', 'long', 'version', 'isreally', 'great', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'band', 'Oklahoma', 'sortof', 'know', 'weird', 'indie', 'rock', 'band', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'therecent', 'international', 'group', 'produced', 'Soft', 'Bulletin', 'Yoshimi', 'back', 'beginning', 'when', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'were', 'Oklahoma', 'Butthole', 'Surfers', 'Scenes', 'brothers', 'Wayne', 'Coyne', 'likewatching', 'film', 'Crumb', 'scenes', 'Stephen', 'Drodz', 'using', 'heroin', 'are', 'prettydisturbing', 'exploitative', 'fun', 'look', 'lineup', 'changes', 'relivetheir', 'chance', 'success', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Use', 'Jelly', 'fun', 'watch', 'madnessof', 'creating', 'Zairekka', 'CD', 'be', 'played', 'four', 'boom', 'boxes', 'latersuccess', 'amazing', 'are', 'now', 'as', 'distinguished', 'bands', 'REM', 'RedHot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'international', 'reputation', 'overwhelming', 'canonly', 'play', 'biggest', 'venues', 'most', 'cities', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'thisfall', 'ocean', 'cruise', 'LA', 'Harbor', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Ihope', 'out', 'further', 'Lips', 'fans', 'IT', 'student', 'modernmusic', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'complete', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'videos']",N/A

However, this is because I am a former addict. But I still think it was unnecessary to be so graphic; but he truly shared the perils of heroin addiction in the most real way.I do wonder how the movie will turn out. I can't believe the amount of energy Wayne possesses toward his projects. I found him to be a great role model (I am an artist myself, and quite lazy by comparison).Only one more complaint. Like in many documentaries, they will tease you with the beginning of a wonderful song, then speak over it, or cut away. I could have used less talk and more music, since this is what the documentary is ultimately about; well beside their lives and the creative process.I highly recommend this film.

884134,AXSUYHR01V8HQ,B0007NN6J2,"Hippie Smell ""hippie_smell""","[5, 9]","The documentary was done well, as it pretty much told the Flaming Lips story and gave the viewer plenty of insight into the bands personality and dynamics. What was lacking was good live music in the documentary. I'm comparing this to the Pavement  Slow Century dvd where they'd pull away and show some awesome clips of the band playing live, and let the song play through. On disc two you do get a small section to chose some live songs from. Also, there were no music videos on this documentary which was also kind of dissapointing. It would have been nice to watch those, especially since part of the emphasis of the documentary is how Wayne and his friends enjoy making film. So I found it weird that the only example of this work was just the documentary itself. My favorite part of the documentary was the parts that covered the earlier parts of the bands career. There are definitely two types of fans that like early Lips music, and the later studio sythesized stuff. Being a noise freak, I like the old stuff better. There was some good footage of the band playing on stage with fire on a cymbal which looked completely bizarre and looked incredibley dangerous. While watching I couldn't help thinking about the Great White concert in Rhode Island. There was also a weird part about the Fearless Freaks, which was a weird mixture of drugs, sports, and violence. You also get a bit where Wayne talks about his old job working at Long John Silvers. This was the type of bizarre insight and footage I expected from this film.I will add this as well, there is an entire cult of Wayne out there that really enjoys his candor and sort of droll sense of humor. This film delves into that towards the end. You witness his feelings on life, death, and his appreciation of fake blood. He after all is often described as being an overgrown child. You also get isnight into his love of making film with his lifelong friend and neighbor from Oklahoma. The parts about the martian movie made me scratch my head. From a documentary view point it was good insight into a strange project, but the premise itself just seemed super hoaky. It honestly looks like one of the most ridiculous films ideas I've ever seen. I like the guy though, and I hope he is able to pull it off.All in all not a bad thing for Lips fans. When compared to other great music documentaries like the Wilco film or the Pavement dvd this one fails in terms of actually representing the bands music. The music is brief, and is talked over. This is a shame because the Lips built their legend on their incredible live shows, and in particular their performances in records stores shortly before Ronald left the band and with their performances on the 2nd stage of Lollapalooza. Surely there must be some footage of this stuff out there, and it amazes me that it wasn't utilized in this film. The other thing that blew my mind was that this documentary just glosses over the Soft Bulletin which is a symphonic masterpiece. What you get instead is a bunch of their personality which after a while gets a little too self indulgent. It gets to the point where they have to show Steven Drozd shooting up, which in my opinion was carried way too far, but also let you know that the documentarian had pretty much full access to film the band. In this Film you get to see disturbed family members, the messed up neighborhoods they live, the impoverished life style the band had to endure to make it, the bands wives, their parents, and pretty much Wayne's happy level of acceptance of everything that is. That pretty much is the crux of the film.",3,More live footage please,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,3601,"['documentary', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'told', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'story', 'gave', 'viewer', 'plenty', 'insight', 'bands', 'personality', 'dynamics', 'What', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'good', 'live', 'music', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'Pavement', 'Slow', 'Century', 'dvd', 'where', ""'d"", 'pull', 'away', 'show', 'awesome', 'clips', 'band', 'playing', 'live', 'let', 'song', 'play', 'disc', 'two', 'do', 'get', 'small', 'section', 'chose', 'live', 'songs', 'Also', 'were', 'music', 'documentary', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'dissapointing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'watch', 'especially', 'part', 'emphasis', 'documentary', 'how', 'Wayne', 'friends', 'enjoy', 'making', 'film', 'found', 'only', 'example', 'work', 'was', 'just', 'documentary', 'favorite', 'part', 'documentary', 'was', 'parts', 'covered', 'earlier', 'parts', 'bands', 'career', 'are', 'definitely', 'two', 'types', 'fans', 'like', 'early', 'Lips', 'music', 'later', 'studio', 'sythesized', 'stuff', 'Being', 'noise', 'freak', 'like', 'old', 'stuff', 'better', 'was', 'good', 'footage', 'band', 'playing', 'stage', 'fire', 'cymbal', 'looked', 'completely', 'bizarre', 'looked', 'incredibley', 'dangerous', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Great', 'White', 'concert', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'was', 'also', 'weird', 'part', 'Fearless', 'Freaks', 'was', 'weird', 'mixture', 'drugs', 'sports', 'violence', 'also', 'get', 'bit', 'where', 'Wayne', 'old', 'job', 'working', 'Long', 'John', 'Silvers', 'was', 'type', 'bizarre', 'insight', 'footage', 'expected', 'film.I', 'will', 'add', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'cult', 'Wayne', 'there', 'really', 'candor', 'sort', 'droll', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'end', 'feelings', 'life', 'death', 'appreciation', 'fake', 'blood', 'often', 'described', 'being', 'overgrown', 'child', 'also', 'get', 'isnight', 'love', 'making', 'film', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'Oklahoma', 'parts', 'martian', 'movie', 'made', 'scratch', 'head', 'documentary', 'view', 'point', 'was', 'good', 'insight', 'strange', 'project', 'premise', 'just', 'seemed', 'super', 'hoaky', 'honestly', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'films', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'guy', 'hope', 'able', 'pull', 'off.All', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Lips', 'fans', 'When', 'compared', 'other', 'great', 'music', 'documentaries', 'Wilco', 'film', 'Pavement', 'dvd', 'one', 'terms', 'actually', 'representing', 'bands', 'music', 'music', 'brief', 'talked', 'shame', 'Lips', 'built', 'legend', 'incredible', 'live', 'shows', 'particular', 'performances', 'records', 'stores', 'shortly', 'Ronald', 'left', 'band', 'performances', '2nd', 'stage', 'Lollapalooza', 'Surely', 'must', 'be', 'footage', 'stuff', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'film', 'other', 'thing', 'blew', 'mind', 'was', 'documentary', 'just', 'over', 'Soft', 'Bulletin', 'symphonic', 'masterpiece', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'bunch', 'personality', 'while', 'little', 'too', 'self', 'indulgent', 'point', 'where', 'have', 'show', 'Steven', 'Drozd', 'shooting', 'up', 'opinion', 'was', 'carried', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'also', 'let', 'know', 'documentarian', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'full', 'access', 'film', 'band', 'Film', 'get', 'see', 'disturbed', 'family', 'members', 'messed', 'up', 'neighborhoods', 'live', 'impoverished', 'life', 'style', 'band', 'had', 'endure', 'make', 'bands', 'wives', 'parents', 'pretty', 'much', 'Wayne', 'happy', 'level', 'acceptance', 'everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'crux', 'film']",N/A

884136,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B0007NN6J2,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","A very likable, intimate portrait of the punk rock turned art rockgroup The Flaming Lips.A very unusual documentary in that the film wasmade by a longtime friend of the band members, especially leader WayneCoyne.But rather than that leading to a glossy 'these guys areperfect' approach, it leads to a sense of honesty, of humor, ofadmitting of personal faults (right down to a band member using drugson camera, and talking in a pretty heartbreaking way about hisaddiction).And what's fascinating about this particular group fromOklahoma is that they're wildly creative, while still seeming like niceregular human beings with families, day to day problems, good and bad sides --unlike what we usually see of rock stars.  These guys are justtrying to make music, try new things, and still pay the rent.If there's a problem with the film it's that, for someone like me whodoesn't really know the band's music, we see and hear so little of itthat sometimes it's hard to fully understand the evolution of theirwork that's being discussed. So in some ways this film will work bestfor those who are already fans of the group,But that said, I still really enjoyed it, found I liked these people, laughed with their funnyview of life (the 'reenactment' of the robbery of a 'Long John Silver's' where Wayne onceworked is a comic highlight) and even found myself quite touched by the end.",4,"An unusual, fun, human music documentary",1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1377,"['very', 'likable', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'punk', 'rock', 'turned', 'art', 'Flaming', 'Lips.A', 'very', 'unusual', 'documentary', 'film', 'wasmade', 'longtime', 'friend', 'band', 'members', 'especially', 'leader', 'WayneCoyne.But', 'rather', 'leading', 'glossy', ""'these"", 'guys', 'areperfect', 'approach', 'sense', 'honesty', 'humor', 'ofadmitting', 'personal', 'faults', 'right', 'down', 'band', 'member', 'using', 'drugson', 'camera', 'talking', 'pretty', 'heartbreaking', 'way', 'hisaddiction', 'what', 'fascinating', 'particular', 'group', 'fromOklahoma', ""'re"", 'wildly', 'creative', 'still', 'seeming', 'niceregular', 'human', 'beings', 'families', 'day', 'day', 'problems', 'good', 'bad', 'sides', 'what', 'usually', 'see', 'rock', 'stars', 'guys', 'are', 'justtrying', 'make', 'music', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'still', 'pay', 'rent.If', 'problem', 'film', 'someone', 'whodoes', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'band', 'music', 'see', 'hear', 'so', 'little', 'itthat', 'hard', 'fully', 'understand', 'evolution', 'theirwork', 'being', 'discussed', 'So', 'ways', 'film', 'will', 'work', 'bestfor', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'group', 'said', 'still', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'liked', 'people', 'laughed', 'funnyview', 'life', ""'reenactment"", 'robbery', ""'Long"", 'John', 'Silver', 'where', 'Wayne', 'onceworked', 'comic', 'highlight', 'even', 'found', 'quite', 'touched', 'end']",N/A

This review was adapted from a post I placed the other day at flaminglips.com, a site well worth a visit if you dig the band.I was looking forward to seeing this, but was not prepared for the emotional punch of this beautiful documentary by filmmaker Bradley Beesley. I felt as moved and joyful as I have after actual Lips concerts.""The Fearless Freaks"" was screened Saturday night at the Blue Note in Columbia (Mo).  It was a nicely full house on hand to see director Beesley introduce the film as part of Columbia's annual ""True/False Film Festival (documentaries).(This was a special ""secret screening"", as more official ""world premiere"" screenings (3) will occur at the 2005 SXSW in Austin.)Beesley was introduced, talked a bit about the film and his long association filming and working with the band. His cell phone has a speakerphone feature, which he put to use as he dialed Wayne Coyne at the Tarbox recording studio near Buffalo, NY. They talked a bit back and forth, Beesley holding the speaker to the microphone. The audience had lots of laughs during the five-minute chat. Wayne mentioned that he, Steven Drozd and Michael Ivins were recording new stuff and that it has snowed every day since they arrived that week. Wayne said that he believed that filming of ""Christmas on Mars"" movie would be completed this summer, but then they would need to do music for the feature. (It sounds like Christmas '06 is most realistic, but who knows, maybe '05 if the planets align.)  ""The Fearless Freaks"" includes five minutes or so on the making of ""Christmas on Mars"".  Fun.The movie is a feast for the eyes, ears, mind and heart.  You'll see the large Coyne family in vintage home movies from the 70's, the early days of the band, the path to now and the often moving story of the passage of time since the band's founding in the early 80's. About two-thirds into the film, one of those passages sweeps the movie to an emotional impact that vaults this film to a level that transcends any ""traditional"" music documentary.As Beesley says at flaminglips.com, the many years of access and friendship with the band allowed him to produce something he hopes goes beyond just ""another okay rockumentary and, together with the band, instead create an insightful and personal piece of cinema.""He succeeded.This is a courageously honest band that has allowed Beesley to present truth that is raw and inspiring. Beesley has fashioned a fine film that ultimately owes its success to the goodness and open-heartedness of The Flaming Lips. The band has bared their souls and their humanity (un-self-consciously) that is completely congruent with the message of their recent music. (""The Soft Bulletin"" and ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots"", most particularly.)I spoke with Beesley after the screening and told him how special I thought his movie is.  As this is his first film (I believe) he was soft-spoken and a bit deprecating about his work to the degree that he might still have had concern about length or he saw this or that that might still need to be edited. (I did see more than a few put fingers to ears during some of the extended excerpts of live shows from their punk days. While exhilarating and an exciting document of shows that WERE tremendously loud, the sound levels of those sequences did seem a bit over modulated, though seeing it through the pa of a concert venue did allow for that music/noise to come through in all ear-splitting glory!)While there might be a couple of minor tweaks *maybe* worth considering in the first half of the film, one must be careful because that beginning sets up the emotional power of the second half. Humbly offering my first impression after the show, I assured Beesley that what he DOES have is a film with something all too hard to successfully pull off - weight, depth of feeling, an emotional heart that bathes the audience with goodwill. I've seen lots of music documentaries over the years. Not till this one have tears come to my eyes. Of course, in The Flaming Lips, Bradley Beesley had subject matter that delivers the ""goods"". I applaud Beesley for bringing that ""script"" to Life.  As fans of the band know, Wayne would be a star of any film.  The man is an inspiring example of LIFE, of humanity most kind. Guile has been stripped from Wayne Coyne and he is nakedly human in a manner that makes me proud to be part of the species.(I also hope that Beesley submits ""The Fearless Freaks"" for consideration of film festivals - I would think Cannes audiences would love this - and also the documentary division of the MPAA. Oscar in '06? This film is truly worthy.  A scene with Steven is one of the most powerful moments I've ever seen - on film or ""real"" life, one of great humanity that touches the soul and moved some in the audience to tears.  The ultimate triumph of Steven, the open-hearted humanity of the band and the inspiring music of The Flaming Lips - particularly since ""The Soft Bulletin"" - is a gift that should be shared with as many people as possible.)To be clear, aside from all my talk of ""feelings"", this is a FUN film - laugh out loud at times, with lots of music and cool visuals.That it is so much more is what makes this movie a joyous treat.I will not spoil your enjoyment of this movie by revealing any further specifics.  See it for yourself.So, in the end, I certainly recommend that you purchase this when it becomes available.  In the meantime, if you - or maybe a loved one - haven't already, order ""The Soft Bulletin"" and ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots"".  In that sequence, listen to each cd from beginning to end, reading the included printed lyrics.  I think you'll be quite glad you did.  Then you'll really be ready for the ""Fearless Freaks""!- Do You Realize? -",5,"As joyful, fun and moving as a Flaming Lips show.",1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,5908,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'order',

It's more than the music, more than band worship; it's a good deep look into some fairly interesting and fairly freaky lives.  ""The Fearless Freaks,"" is filmed by Bradley Beesley, an Okie just like the Flaming Lips.  You know Brad's work, largely drawn to music documentaries but also his seminal piece on catfish catching Oklahoma style, ""Okie Noodling,"" and the excellent, ""Summercamp.""  What a perfect match-up though pairing Beesley with Howard Coyne and the rest of the Flaming Lips to tell this story of a quite unusually creative punk-indie-chamber-psycho-psychedelic alternative band.  But it really isn't the story of a band as much as it is a story of some unique and quirky lives.You may have caught the Lips on Austin City Limits and were drawn-in or maybe drawn-away by their Alice Cooperesque use of fake-blood during one of their songs, or maybe it was the bunny rabbit costumes, or the outer space themes, or the human gerbil exercise ball surfing over the heads of the crowds or in the end it was the raining confetti.  Well whatever intrigued you in the first place, you'll find in the ""Fearless Freaks,"" the Lips lead singer Howard Coyne actually comes across as a pretty squared away guy.  A squared away guy that is endlessly creative mind you so much so that he builds films sets in his spare time taking a gasoline tank and turning it into a spaceship so he can create his own movie starring his band members.So you know where I'm coming from, I'm not particularly drawn in by the Flaming Lips music.  Yoshimi has some good tunes but I tried listening to the Soft Bulletin on a recent drive to Austin and couldn't really make it through the first couple of songs.  But the band is infinitely fascinating as you will discover when you watch ""The Fearless Freaks.""It's an odd mix no doubt, a psychedelic chamber pop outfit from Oklahoma City but it seems the little cow town has embraced the diversity the Lips bring to the world and even have named one of their more prestigious streets in OKC's Bricktown, Flaming Lips Drive...google it and find out for yourself if you don't believe it.But as for the ""Fearless Freaks,"" get it, watch it, live it, love it.  You'll see this Midwestern hard working approach to play and creativity starting with a bunch of High Schoolers playing substance-induced tackle football to the nth degree to turning that kind of energy and drive into the Flaming Lips of today. --MMW",4,There's a Life Story in these Freaky Flames,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,2498,"['rock-u-mentary', 'other', 'flicks', 'typical', 'genre', 'more', 'music', 'more', 'band', 'worship', 'good', 'deep', 'look', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'freaky', 'lives', 'Fearless', 'Freaks', 'filmed', 'Bradley', 'Beesley', 'Okie', 'just', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'know', 'Brad', 'work', 'largely', 'drawn', 'music', 'documentaries', 'also', 'seminal', 'piece', 'catfish', 'catching', 'Oklahoma', 'style', 'Okie', 'Noodling', 'excellent', 'Summercamp', 'What', 'perfect', 'match-up', 'pairing', 'Beesley', 'Howard', 'Coyne', 'rest', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'tell', 'story', 'quite', 'unusually', 'creative', 'punk-indie-chamber-psycho-psychedelic', 'alternative', 'band', 'really', ""n't"", 'story', 'band', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'unique', 'quirky', 'lives.You', 'may', 'have', 'caught', 'Lips', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'were', 'drawn-in', 'maybe', 'drawn-away', 'Alice', 'Cooperesque', 'use', 'fake-blood', 'one', 'songs', 'maybe', 'was', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'costumes', 'outer', 'space', 'themes', 'human', 'gerbil', 'exercise', 'ball', 'surfing', 'heads', 'crowds', 'end', 'was', 'raining', 'confetti', 'Well', 'intrigued', 'first', 'place', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Fearless', 'Freaks', 'Lips', 'lead', 'singer', 'Howard', 'Coyne', 'actually', 'pretty', 'squared', 'away', 'guy', 'squared', 'away', 'guy', 'endlessly', 'creative', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'films', 'sets', 'spare', 'time', 'taking', 'gasoline', 'tank', 'turning', 'spaceship', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'movie', 'starring', 'band', 'members.So', 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'drawn', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'music', 'Yoshimi', 'good', 'tunes', 'tried', 'listening', 'Soft', 'Bulletin', 'recent', 'drive', 'Austin', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'first', 'couple', 'songs', 'band', 'infinitely', 'fascinating', 'will', 'discover', 'when', 'watch', 'Fearless', 'Freaks', 'odd', 'mix', 'doubt', 'psychedelic', 'chamber', 'pop', 'outfit', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'little', 'cow', 'town', 'embraced', 'diversity', 'Lips', 'bring', 'world', 'even', 'have', 'named', 'one', 'more', 'prestigious', 'streets', 'OKC', 'Bricktown', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'Drive', 'google', 'find', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'it.But', 'Fearless', 'Freaks', 'get', 'watch', 'love', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Midwestern', 'hard', 'working', 'approach', 'play', 'creativity', 'starting', 'bunch', 'High', 'Schoolers', 'playing', 'substance-induced', 'tackle', 'football', 'nth', 'degree', 'turning', 'kind', 'energy', 'drive', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'today', 'MMW']",N/A

884141,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0007NN6J2,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 9]","Memories...this retrospective look back at the formation and final breakthrough of The Flaming Lips, described by one of the band members as ""hillbillies"" crossed with The Who. This movie uses home movies, home video and current footage of the band to go back into the past and see the formation of one of America's most important rock bands around. Coyne describes his band early on as a loud band without much talent (oh, not true Wayne perhaps inexperienced) in the beginning of their career, The Flaming Lips went from cult favorite to critical favorite and while not in the top ten (who is today except historic singers) they've found a niche in rock music that they work exceedingly well in. Coyne at 41 with a touch of gray proves that there are second acts in American lives...or perhaps first acts with a late curtain. We also get a glimpse behind The Flaming Lips science fiction movie a bizarre, unscripted film like only The Flaming Lips could make involving an insane Santa Claus, a giant bunny and Wayne Coyne as a super powered alien.Because the source material for this is drawn from a variety of sources over the years, the picture quality ranges from poor to good. That's not a problem in the transfer but in the source material itself which includes Super 8 home movies, early videotapes, film shot in less than the best lighting conditions and video ditto. The picture quality for the newer footage is quite good. Audio, likewise, varies quite a bit from poor to good once again depending on the source material.We get a whole bunch of very cool live performance footage of the band (some of it with distorted sound), deleted scenes including behind-the-scenes footage of the band warming up for ""Austin City Limits"". There's also footage of Wayne as Santa and some truly strange stuff that was cut out of the film including footage shot for one of the band's first recording sessions. There's a photo gallery that looks like a trip through my childhood (bell bottoms, long hair, goofy afros, punk hair cuts although I'll never confess to any of those and I've burned MY photos like that) clearly the band and I share a bond that goes beyond simple music. Perhaps it's my simpleton attitude but, more than likely, it's an appreciation for Coyne and his band pushing the limits of music wherever possible.The current line up for the band does a running commentary throughout the film giving considerable background on the various people interviewed throughout the film. It's actually interesting in a car wreck sort of way in that we learn a lot more than we really need to know about the lives of the band members and their extended family.If The Flaming Lips hadn't come into existence someone would have to invent them. Luckily, Wayne Coyne found his true calling as a songwriter and singer. Yes, they borrowed from the best (including The Butthole Surfers) but Coyne made it all his own creating a sound and style unique to his band.",4,Essential for Flaming Lips fans,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,2956,"['Memories', 'retrospective', 'look', 'back', 'formation', 'final', 'breakthrough', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'described', 'one', 'band', 'members', 'hillbillies', 'crossed', 'Who', 'movie', 'home', 'movies', 'home', 'video', 'current', 'footage', 'band', 'go', 'back', 'past', 'see', 'formation', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'important', 'rock', 'bands', 'Coyne', 'band', 'early', 'loud', 'band', 'much', 'talent', 'oh', 'not', 'true', 'Wayne', 'perhaps', 'inexperienced', 'beginning', 'career', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'went', 'cult', 'favorite', 'critical', 'favorite', 'not', 'top', 'ten', 'who', 'today', 'historic', 'singers', ""'ve"", 'found', 'niche', 'rock', 'music', 'work', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'Coyne', '41', 'touch', 'gray', 'proves', 'are', 'second', 'acts', 'American', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'first', 'acts', 'late', 'curtain', 'also', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'unscripted', 'film', 'only', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'could', 'make', 'involving', 'insane', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'giant', 'bunny', 'Wayne', 'Coyne', 'super', 'powered', 'source', 'material', 'drawn', 'variety', 'sources', 'years', 'picture', 'quality', 'poor', 'good', 'not', 'problem', 'transfer', 'source', 'material', 'Super', '8', 'home', 'movies', 'early', 'videotapes', 'film', 'shot', 'less', 'best', 'lighting', 'conditions', 'video', 'ditto', 'picture', 'quality', 'newer', 'footage', 'quite', 'good', 'Audio', 'likewise', 'varies', 'quite', 'bit', 'poor', 'good', 'once', 'again', 'depending', 'source', 'material.We', 'get', 'whole', 'bunch', 'very', 'cool', 'live', 'performance', 'footage', 'band', 'distorted', 'sound', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'band', 'warming', 'up', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'also', 'footage', 'Wayne', 'Santa', 'truly', 'strange', 'stuff', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'including', 'footage', 'shot', 'one', 'band', 'first', 'recording', 'sessions', 'photo', 'gallery', 'trip', 'childhood', 'bell', 'bottoms', 'long', 'hair', 'goofy', 'afros', 'punk', 'hair', 'cuts', ""'ll"", 'never', 'confess', ""'ve"", 'burned', 'MY', 'photos', 'clearly', 'band', 'share', 'bond', 'simple', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'simpleton', 'attitude', 'more', 'likely', 'appreciation', 'Coyne', 'band', 'pushing', 'limits', 'music', 'possible.The', 'current', 'line', 'band', 'running', 'commentary', 'film', 'giving', 'considerable', 'background', 'various', 'people', 'interviewed', 'film', 'actually', 'interesting', 'car', 'wreck', 'sort', 'way', 'learn', 'lot', 'more', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'lives', 'band', 'members', 'extended', 'family.If', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'existence', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'invent', 'Luckily', 'Wayne', 'Coyne', 'found', 'true', 'calling', 'songwriter', 'singer', 'Yes', 'borrowed', 'best', 'including', 'Butthole', 'Surfers', 'Coyne', 'made', 'own', 'creating', 'sound', 'style', 'unique', 'band']",N/A
