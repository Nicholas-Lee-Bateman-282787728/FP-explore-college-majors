For most of her older songs, she used the same dances and also she used the sqame back ground video. The stage was nothing to be proud of just a flat lit up stage with a few stairs. where was the special effects? Get this guys she still is useing the same dance that DC3 used for soliger!

1109931,A1WPCLH2ZACWPH,B000WGZGNS,"Charlie B. ""Charlie""","[20, 29]","The Beyonce' Experience was Beyonce' Knowles's first headlining tour as a solo artist and lives up to everything you can expect it to be, based on what you're usually used to seeing from her.  Very glamourous, very flirty, very seductive, and over the top at times, Beyonce' pulled out all the stops on this outing as she breezed through her huge catalogue of hits in a 2-hour set that garnered nothing but positive reviews and praise when she toured the states the Summer of 2007 (sans the unfortunate pyrotechnics mishap in St. Louis and serious tumble down the stairs during ""Ring the Alarm"" in Orlando).While clearly realizing with certain numbers that ""we've seen it all before,"" from her ""Ring the Alarm"" performance a la the 2006 MTV Music Awards to her Kylie Minogue-inspired robot opening of ""Get Me Bodied"" from the 2007 BET Awards, along with familiar recreations of the videos on her B'Day Anthology Album DVD, it's the energy and commitment Beyonce brings to the stage that sells this entire tour, next to her Southern charm and beauty.  To see it in a live setting is just something that has to be admired, as opposed to watching countless award show appearances and performances and videos in the comfort of your home.  Even watching this DVD you can only imagine the rush of seeing her perform live.  However, there was nothing fancy about the show: no elaborate sets or gaudy costumes, not a whole lot of lights and explosions.  Along with her all female band, buxom backup singers known as ""The Mamas,"" and a fierce dance troupe, next to the star herself, you tend to finish the show wishing for just a little bit more.The set list was (which may stray slightly from the DVD release):Crazy in LoveFreakum DressGreen LightBaby BoyBeautiful LiarNaughty GirlMe, Myself And IDangerously In LoveFlaws & AllDC3 Medley-Independent Women Part I-Bootylicious-No No No Part 2-Bug a Boo-Bills, Bills, Bills-Cater 2 U-Say My Name-Jumpin' Jumpin'-Soldier-SurvivorSpeechlessRing the AlarmSuga MamaUpgrade U'03 Bonnie & ClydeCheck On ItD&eacute;j&agrave; VuGet Me BodiedWelcome to HollywoodDreamgirlsListenIrreplaceableHappy B'DayThe performance at the Staples Center differs from other performances during the trek as Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams join her on stage for ""Survivor"" and Jay-Z during ""Upgrade U.""Highlights:-After stripping the floor length gown off and into a sizzling mini-dress, she steers away from the original song to sing ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley.  She also does this when she sings ""Dangerously in Love,"" quickly switching into Jill Scott's ""He Loves Me"" for the remainder of the track.-Beyonce cried during ""Flaws and All"" at mulitple shows-The ""Welcome to Hollywood"" swell captured some never-before-seen footage of Beyonce behind the scenesSome ""Iffy"" Points:-Beyonce was unable to hold her own on the songs that didn't require just her, i.e. ""Beautiful Liar,"" which seemed out of place without Shakira, and most of the Destiny's Child songs-Some of the songs had a twist on them that really should've been left out like the Chopped & Screwed mix of ""Bug a Boo"" and the slowed up version of ""Check On It.""-While it's realized that she wanted to give her fans all that she's offered musically, she tried to jumble way too many songs into the show, some should've clearly been omitted so that others could've been performed in their entirety-The ""Dreamgirls"" sequence was just a little too much and could've been executed differentlyWhile some may contend that the lack of extra effects and high ticket cost (single seats topped $200 in some cities, not to mention up to over $1000 for fan club exclusive seats and a once in a lifetime meet and greet) was not worth it, the ""experience"" was clearly the making of a music superstar who has many years ahead of her to perfect her craft to icon status.  This is a DVD must-have for any fan of Beyonce, Destiny's Child, or person who was unable to score tickets to one of the most anticipated tours of 2007.",3,What An Experience...,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,3987,"['Beyonce', 'Experience', 'was', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'first', 'headlining', 'tour', 'solo', 'artist', 'up', 'everything', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'based', 'what', ""'re"", 'usually', 'used', 'seeing', 'Very', 'glamourous', 'very', 'flirty', 'very', 'seductive', 'top', 'times', 'Beyonce', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'outing', 'breezed', 'huge', 'catalogue', 'hits', '2-hour', 'set', 'garnered', 'nothing', 'positive', 'reviews', 'praise', 'when', 'toured', 'states', 'Summer', '2007', 'unfortunate', 'pyrotechnics', 'mishap', 'St.', 'Louis', 'serious', 'tumble', 'down', 'stairs', 'Ring', 'Alarm', 'Orlando', '.While', 'clearly', 'realizing', 'certain', 'numbers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ring', 'Alarm', 'performance', 'la', '2006', 'MTV', 'Music', 'Awards', 'Kylie', 'Minogue-inspired', 'robot', 'opening', 'Get', 'Me', 'Bodied', '2007', 'BET', 'Awards', 'familiar', 'recreations', 'videos', ""B'Day"", 'Anthology', 'Album', 'DVD', 'energy', 'commitment', 'Beyonce', 'stage', 'entire', 'tour', 'next', 'Southern', 'charm', 'beauty', 'see', 'live', 'setting', 'just', 'something', 'be', 'admired', 'opposed', 'watching', 'countless', 'award', 'show', 'appearances', 'performances', 'videos', 'comfort', 'home', 'Even', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'rush', 'seeing', 'perform', 'live', 'However', 'was', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'show', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'gaudy', 'costumes', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'lights', 'explosions', 'female', 'band', 'buxom', 'backup', 'singers', 'known', 'Mamas', 'fierce', 'dance', 'troupe', 'next', 'star', 'tend', 'finish', 'show', 'wishing', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more.The', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'may', 'stray', 'slightly', 'DVD', 'release', 'Crazy', 'LoveFreakum', 'DressGreen', 'LightBaby', 'BoyBeautiful', 'LiarNaughty', 'GirlMe', 'Myself', 'IDangerously', 'LoveFlaws', 'AllDC3', 'Medley-Independent', 'Women', 'Part', 'I-Bootylicious-No', 'No', 'No', 'Part', '2-Bug', 'Boo-Bills', 'Bills', 'Bills-Cater', '2', 'U-Say', 'My', 'Name-Jumpin', ""Jumpin'-Soldier-SurvivorSpeechlessRing"", 'AlarmSuga', 'MamaUpgrade', ""U'03"", 'Bonnie', 'ClydeCheck', 'ItD', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'VuGet', 'Me', 'BodiedWelcome', 'HollywoodDreamgirlsListenIrreplaceableHappy', ""B'DayThe"", 'performance', 'Staples', 'Center', 'differs', 'other', 'performances', 'trek', 'Kelly', 'Rowland', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'join', 'stage', 'Survivor', 'Jay-Z', 'Upgrade', 'U', 'Highlights', '-After', 'stripping', 'floor', 'length', 'gown', 'off', 'sizzling', 'mini-dress', 'away', 'original', 'song', 'sing', 'Crazy', 'Gnarls', 'Barkley', 'also', 'when', 'Dangerously', 'Love', 'quickly', 'switching', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'Me', 'remainder', 'track.-Beyonce', 'cried', 'Flaws', 'All', 'mulitple', 'shows-The', 'Welcome', 'Hollywood', 'swell', 'captured', 'never-before-seen', 'footage', 'Beyonce', 'scenesSome', 'Iffy', 'Points', '-Beyonce', 'was', 'unable', 'hold', 'own', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'just', 'i.e', 'Beautiful', 'Liar', 'seemed', 'place', 'Shakira', 'most', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'songs-Some', 'songs', 'had', 'twist', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Chopped', 'Screwed', 'mix', 'Bug', 'Boo', 'slowed', 'version', 'Check', 'realized', 'wanted', 'give', 'fans', 'offered', 'musically', 'tried', 'jumble', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'show', 'should', ""'ve"", 'clearly', 'been', 'omitted', 'so', 'others', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'performed', 'entirety-The', 'Dreamgirls', 'sequence', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'executed', 'may', 'contend', 'lack', 'extra', 'effects', 'high', 'ticket', 'cost', 'single', 'seats', 'topped', '200', 'cities', 'not', 'mention', 'up', '1000', 'fan', 'club', 'exclusive', 'seats', 'once', 'lifetime', 'meet', 'greet', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'experience', 'was', 'clearly', 'making', 'music', 'superstar', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'ahead', 'perfect', 'craft', 'icon', 'status', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'fan', 'Beyonce', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'score', 'tickets', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'tours', '2007']",The Beyoncé Experience - Live!

I love how she has an all female band and women of all shapes and sizes dancing with and behind her and singing as well. She takes our old favorites and spices them up with mixes of current songs and dances. (My favorites would have to be the ""Crank That"" Soldier Mix...Beyonce does what she does best...and the other would have to be the new version of Baby Boy with the extended reggae mix). She finally performed Flaws and All and I love how the camera is on her and she connects with her fans. The entire set, theme, and flow of the show was great. I am still questioning some of her choice in set outfits, (like the sequins on the swimsuit...?) But overall it was an incredible experience, and I wish I was there to witness her in action-her stage presence and the way she interacts with her fans is incredible. There is no other performer like her right now who can sing, dance, and truly give you your money's worth of an entertaining show.The flip side...is Kelly and Michelle came out for a chorus of Survivor-which was hilarious to me because she had just finished an ENTIRE set of Destiny's Child songs by herself! Just watching Bee perform only reflects the superstar that she is and she is deserving of that title-I think Kelly and Michelle are nice, but they are mediocre they are not on Bee's level and its not because her dad put her in the spotlight SHE works her butt off and is smart and when you watch this DVD of her concert you will agree. She goes out on the stage and leaves her blood, sweet, and tears with the audience and you can fill that passion...that always makes for an incredible artist.

But even better is Destiny's Child farewell concert DVD.  If you want to see her and her girls at their best, get that one.She didn't seem to give the same energy we've seen her give before.  It's like she was holding back so she wouldn't tire herself out through out the concert and it seems like her back up singers did most of the singing. Maybe because she looks a little more out of shape than she did in her previous concerts.Also, the video is streched to make her look thinner (like Paula Abdul's Promise of a New Day Music Video).

But yesterday, I watched this concert DVD, and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed!This gal has it all.  For starters, of course she's gorgeous and oozes a distinctly innocent sexiness.  Beyond this important superficiality, I was delighted to discover that she has abundant ability as an artist.  Most strikingly, I was blown away by how good a singer she is - easily in the top echelon of pop and R&B; singers.  Next add that she's a great dancer (and somehow all that dancing never seemed to cause her to sweat or get out of breath!).  Finally, as a performer, she portrays her characters like a true actor, and her interaction with the audience is sincere and engaging.As an overall package, this (long) concert coheres well, with a nice variety of great songs, ranging from heartful ballads to bumpin grooves, all sequenced to form a natural flow.  Complementing that, we get an understated but effective use of costume changes and lighting.  Last but not least, her dancers are solid and her all-female band is super tight (I especially enjoyed the two drummers).Again, this is a great concert, and Beyonce demonstrates that she's a great artist and performer who deserves her success.  Add me to her fan club!7/25/10 Update: I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this DVD, and it's well worth it.  The improvement in visual clarity is huge.8/23/10 Update: I've now watched this DVD at least half a dozen times, and it has ascended to becoming my favorite concert DVD in any genre.

Sensational work ethic and performance from everyone, B and the dancers and band did a great job delivering a high energy concert - worth watching many times.  The showmanship on this is outstanding, the energy and excitement are fun to watch, and this is a great dvd.

1109941,A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B000WGZGNS,"K. J. Bryant ""peachycream""","[3, 6]","Since Beyonce went solo, I have been very disappointed in her. Not that I have a problem with her going solo. She just have not lived up to the hype surrounding her...until now! This DVD concert is the first project that lives up to her ""legend-in-waiting"" status.This concert was great. Beyonce sings and dance her heart out in every number. Don't expect too many surprises though, because this DVD is basically an upgrade from her ""Beyonce - Live at Wembley"". She took the concepts of her first solo DVD and Destiny's Child farewell Atlanta DVD and upgraded the performances a level or two. That's not a bad thing, but I expected to see a little more from her.I have only two real complaints: There is no bonus footage (behind the scenes footage, interview, or bonus track). In this day and time, you expect more from an artist and I think Beyonce short-changed us on the extra stuff. Its no wonder Christina Aguilera's DVD is doing better than Beyonce's (despite costing more).The other complaint I have is the video is stretched. Why? To make her appear thinner? It didn't work because even though Beyonce is beautiful, you can tell she was heavier than her last tour. I just find it tacky that they tried to cover that up by stretching the video.Either way, I enjoyed the concert and I think you will too.",4,A Great Experience,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,1310,"['Beyonce', 'went', 'solo', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'have', 'problem', 'going', 'solo', 'just', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'now', 'DVD', 'concert', 'first', 'project', 'up', 'legend-in-waiting', 'status.This', 'concert', 'was', 'great', 'Beyonce', 'sings', 'dance', 'heart', 'out', 'number', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'DVD', 'basically', 'upgrade', 'Beyonce', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'took', 'concepts', 'first', 'solo', 'DVD', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'farewell', 'Atlanta', 'DVD', 'upgraded', 'performances', 'level', 'two', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'expected', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'her.I', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'real', 'complaints', 'bonus', 'footage', 'scenes', 'footage', 'interview', 'bonus', 'track', 'day', 'time', 'expect', 'more', 'artist', 'think', 'Beyonce', 'short-changed', 'extra', 'stuff', 'wonder', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'DVD', 'doing', 'better', 'Beyonce', 'costing', 'more', '.The', 'other', 'complaint', 'have', 'video', 'stretched', 'Why', 'make', 'appear', 'thinner', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'even', 'Beyonce', 'beautiful', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'heavier', 'last', 'tour', 'just', 'find', 'tacky', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'stretching', 'video.Either', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'concert', 'think', 'will', 'too']",The Beyoncé Experience - Live!
1109942,A19FAQLQEKN54F,B000WGZGNS,KonLi,"[2, 3]","I attended the Beyonce concert when she came to Denver this past August and was blown away! This woman entertains! I was worried that the DVD wouldn't be able to fully capture the excitement of the show, but it does that and more. There are few women who can command a stage for two hours.The disc opens with Beyonce asking the audience if they are ""...ready to be entertained?!"" She doesn't disappoint as she launches into ""Crazy in Love"" and the sexy ""Freakum Dress"". She holds court as she gives you the full range of her catalogue: first some of her more popular solo material, then her work with former group-mates Destiny's Child, and finally more material from her newest release. Performed live, all of these songs sound fresh, when on record some of the material can seem kind of dated (i.e. 'Bug-a boo', No No No).My only problems with the disc / concert were few. The addition of 'Flaws and All' detracts from the excitement of the show as Beyonce's vocal histrionics and simulated tears add nothing to the performance. We all know that Beyonce has a good voice, but she tends to over sing on 'Flaws and All' and 'Dangerously in Love'. As a performer, she is decidedly more Tina Turner than Whitney Houston and she should embrace that. The great thing about that is that she is well on her way to being a great performer in the same way as Tina Turner because she totally gives you all of herself in these two hours. The only other part of the DVD that was upsetting is that there are no extras on it at all.In all, this is an excellent purchase for the Beyonce novice or even a longtime fan. Though here in Denver we weren't treated to the guest appearance by Jay Z (of course), I am otherwise completely satisfied with this show. I look forward to more performances by this very talented young woman in the future!",4,The Lady Entertains!!!,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,1827,"['attended', 'Beyonce', 'concert', 'when', 'came', 'Denver', 'past', 'August', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'woman', 'was', 'worried', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'capture', 'excitement', 'show', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'command', 'stage', 'two', 'hours.The', 'disc', 'Beyonce', 'asking', 'audience', 'are', 'ready', 'be', 'entertained', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Crazy', 'Love', 'sexy', 'Freakum', 'Dress', 'court', 'full', 'range', 'catalogue', 'first', 'more', 'popular', 'solo', 'material', 'then', 'work', 'former', 'group-mates', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'finally', 'more', 'material', 'newest', 'release', 'Performed', 'live', 'songs', 'sound', 'fresh', 'when', 'record', 'material', 'can', 'seem', 'kind', 'dated', 'i.e', ""'Bug-a"", 'boo', 'No', 'No', 'No', 'only', 'problems', 'disc', '/', 'concert', 'were', 'few', 'addition', ""'Flaws"", 'All', 'detracts', 'excitement', 'show', 'Beyonce', 'vocal', 'histrionics', 'simulated', 'tears', 'add', 'nothing', 'performance', 'know', 'Beyonce', 'good', 'voice', 'sing', ""'Flaws"", 'All', ""'Dangerously"", 'Love', 'performer', 'decidedly', 'more', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'should', 'embrace', 'great', 'thing', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'great', 'performer', 'same', 'way', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'totally', 'two', 'hours', 'only', 'other', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'upsetting', 'are', 'extras', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'Beyonce', 'novice', 'even', 'longtime', 'fan', 'here', 'Denver', 'were', ""n't"", 'treated', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Jay', 'Z', 'course', 'am', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'performances', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'woman', 'future']",The Beyoncé Experience - Live!

Beyonce entertained her fans through her songs, energy, dancers, and her all female band! Here is the setlist:1. Intro Fanfare - The band plays a sample of Strawberry Letter 23 as B makes her way to the stage.2. Crazy In Love/Crazy - she performs her first single as a solo artist and mixes it with Gnarls Barkley's version of Crazy which was pretty cool. I also like how she rips the long skirt from her costume, making it a short skirt :)3. Freakum Dress - very sexy performance. This version is more like a rocked-out version. Loved it!!!4. Green Light/Band Jam - I liked it. One of my favorites from the B'Day album.5. Baby Boy/Murder He Wrote - Awesome, but this performance is more for the ladies than the men.6. Beautiful Liar - good, but it needed Shakira.7. Naughty Girl - sexy performance. Love the soul clapping.8. Me, Myself, And I - liked it, but I like the Wembley Arena DVD performance better.9. Piano Break/Dangerously In Love/He Loves Me - one of my favorite peformances from the DVD. It's very elegant and I love how she mixes Jill Scott's He Loves Me in the song.10. Flaws and All - pretty good. Towards the end, B sheds some tears while embracing an angel.11. Cops & Robbers Intro/Destiny's Child Medley (Independent Women Pt 1, Bootylicious, No No No Pt 2, Bug A Boo [Screwed & Chopped Mix], Bills Bills Bills, Cater 2 U, Say My Name, Jumpin Jumpin, Soldier [Soulja Boy Crank Mix], Survivor w. Kelly and Michelle) - loved it. My favorites were Bills Bills Bills and Say My Name. I like how she did the Souja Boy Dance with her dancers.12. Speechless - I think she could've left this number out.13. Jailhouse Confessions/Ring The Alarm - HOT! The intro is HOT!!! This is the song where she fell on the flight of stairs at the Orlando show. She didn't fall off of this performance which was good.14. Suga Mama - pretty hot! I've learned to like this song and I love the performance15. Upgrade U (feat Jay-Z) - not my favorite song by her, but Jay-Z made a special performance with B.16. 03 Bonnie & Clyde/Prince Mix - okay, not my favorite.17. Check On It (Special Tour Version) - LOVED IT!! It cracked me up and it was sexy at the same time.18. Deja Vu - that's my song and Beyonce's! Wished she sang the second verse, but the performance was great!19. Bass Jam/Bee Intro/Get Me Bodied (Extended Mix) - She bought it home!! My favorite song and performance from B!20. Welcome To Hollywood - it's just the song and never before seen footage of Beyonce. Pretty good to watch as B makes her costume change.21. Dreamgirls - Very interesting! I wish she would've performed the whole song.22. Listen - Awesome!!23. Irreplaceable/B'Day Surprise - To the left! To the left! Great song to close the show as well as B's birthday surprise.Overall, it was a great show.

1109947,AJK5WHV1GW941,B000WGZGNS,Mikeisha Best,"[30, 31]","Once you have seen Beyonce' Knowles live in concert, you will have a new respect for her.  I had the pleasure of attending ""The Beyonce' Experience"" when it came to Washington, DC, and since then, I have adored her even more.  When Destiny's Child released their first single, ""No, No, No"", it was crystal clear that Beyonce' was not only the star of the group, but also the hardest working one and the one with the most potential.  With this concert on DVD, she proves my stated point.  Throughout the duration of the show, Beyonce' didn't miss a beat, nor did she forget a lyric, nor did I see much sweat!  She made it look so easy, and that impressed me a great deal.When she first steps onto the stage, she asks the crowd if they are ready to be entertained.  She, without a doubt, entertains for each minute of the two hours that she is performing!  It's not easy to keep 20,000 people entertained for two hours, but somehow Beyonce' manages to accomplish this task.Beyonce' performs all of her biggest hits and also gives us many doses of Destiny's Child's music.  ""Get Me Bodied"" stands out in my mind as one of the best performances because there was non-stop choreography, very creative outfits (she had on black and yellow, hence, her nickname is Bee), and it was simply an energetic performance.  ""Crazy in Love"", ""Me, Myself and I"", and ""Speechless"" are other highlights.  I loved the simplicity of the ""Flaws and All"" performance.  She sounded great, but she incorporated so many emotions with just one song, and it was very touching to watch (how can she make herself cry on cue, on stage??)  ""Irreplaceable"" is another highlight.  Not because she did anything fancy or gaudy, because she didn't, but I love the crowd participation she included, and I liked how she pointed random individuals out from the audience (I.E., she said, ""I see you over there with that Beyonce' poster!"")In all honesty, I could go on and on boasting about this DVD, but to really bring into fruition what I am saying, you will have to see it.

I guess the editing was top notch as well, because I never heard her miss a note or lose her breath.  There's one song, something about her flaws, that I really liked.  I'd never heard that one before.  The audience there for the taping experienced a real treat, but watching this 2 hour spectacle proved to be a chore for me.  I won't likely watch this again.",3,Much Too Long,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,825,"['doubt', 'Miss', 'B', 'put', 'heck', 'show', '60', 'minutes', 'was', 'done', 'tried', 'sing', 'hit', 'ever', 'made', 'grew', 'tired', 'watching', 'listening', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'material', 'DC', 'reunion', 'got', 'boundless', 'energy', 'visually', 'quite', 'stunning', 'show', 'was', 'entertaining', 'most', 'part', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'pretty', 'one', 'where', 'jewels', 'bottom', 'guess', 'editing', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'heard', 'miss', 'note', 'lose', 'breath', 'one', 'song', 'something', 'flaws', 'really', 'liked', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'one', 'before', 'audience', 'there', 'taping', 'experienced', 'real', 'treat', 'watching', '2', 'hour', 'spectacle', 'proved', 'be', 'chore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likely', 'watch', 'again']",The Beyoncé Experience - Live!
