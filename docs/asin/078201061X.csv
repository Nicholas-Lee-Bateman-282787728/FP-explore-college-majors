41719,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,078201061X,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[4, 47]","To begin with, Neil Diamond could never sing. He has always ""talked"" his songs, he doesn't sing. Even on simply-constructed rock tunes, he has a totally grating, unmusical voice, no breath control, and the sense of rhythm of a polka dancer. Now, put him in a movie called ""The Jazz Singer,"" and what you get is something akin to casting Fatty Arbuckle as Errol Flynn. Diamond is a product of the commercial Brill Building, a heavily promoted performer of marginal talent. His acting is atrocious---laughable in fact. He has made an entire career out of the same three chord song structures and a voice that resembles the sound of fingernails scratching a slate board. Jazz singing is the territory of truly talented people like Mel Torme, Mildred Bailey, and Ella Fitzgerald. They had musical voices, impeccable phrasing, innate rhythm, and a vocal range that spanned multiple octaves (as opposed to Diamond's stiff, frog-like, off-key utterings). It's a joke, really, that Neil Diamond was even given this role. What's next? The cross-eyed, mule-faced Barbra Streisand playing the life of Heddy LaMarr? Hey, I've got some other ideas for those Hollywood producers: how about Sally Jesse Raphael and Jerry Springer as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard? Springer can play Lombard, and the gorgeous, sexy Raphael can play Gable. She already has the mustache. Then we can get Billy Crystal to play John Wayne. Finally, Alan Dershowitz should be given his acting break, don't you agree? How 'bout casting him opposite O.J. Simpson in ""Anything Goes?"" Hey, open your eyes. The liberal Hollywood freaks have made popular culture an oxymoron. There are no more absolutes, everything is relative. All criminal behavior is rationalized and the perpetrator exonerated via psychobabble like ""his Dad never plaed catch with him, that's why he's an axe murderer."" Ugly is now beautiful, stupidity is now erudition, and immorality is now a virtue. Anything goes so long as money can be made. Since the end of WWII, and especially since the drug-infested 1960s, we've allowed the barbarians to assume control of all social, political and cultural discourse.

Cliched and schmaltzy, most of the scenes seem strung together as an excuse to fill time between musical numbers.  The story, as borrowed from the original Jolson film: son of a cantor wants to sing popular music instead of following in his father's footsteps.Neither Diamond nor Arnaz are going to win Oscars anytime soon -- in fact, Diamond demonstrates that, as an actor, he's a heck of a singer.  The only shining performance in this movie is that of the incomparable Olivier, who proves that he can play any role given to him impeccably, no matter how dopey the surroundings.If you are expecting any meat or substance to this movie, forget it.

41727,A3QLIXBN04THCI,078201061X,Classic Film Lover,"[1, 1]","I was 11 years old when this movie came home to my house from the video store. I asked my Dad to rent STAR WARS...I got THE JAZZ SINGER. It's funny. Dad has been gone now nearly five years and I still watch this one every year on his birthday since he died. It is a film that every time I see it, it takes me back to that Wednesday in the summer when I first heard ""America"" coming from the screen door in the garage. I had to run in after my Dad repeated the song. From that moment forward I was hooked on this movie...hooked on Neil Diamond. I have seen him in concert 22 times since I saw this film for the first time and it just takes me back to my youth every time I watch it.First off, Neil Diamond doesn't do a bad job as an actor. It is quite disconcerting that reviewers accused him of playing himself for the sake of releasing music. There is so much about this movie that just speaks to the viewer and shoots from the hip. Let's first discuss the way it was shot. The fuzziness and over-all haze in some shots is great. This especially noticeable when Neil is onstage as Jess Robin in L.A. and Eddie Gibbs walks out of his performance. When Neil looks out at his manager, Molly (played by Lucie Arnaz) for the reason why, she smiles and follows him out. This scene looks different in quality, but still holds up well. The humor is right on the mark and is not too over the top. Catlin Adams is so annoying as his first wife, Rivka, that you are glad by the time she she leaves him. The poor man's life would've been too long otherwise, and Arnaz is great as Molly.Laurence Olivier is a smart choice to play Neil Diamond's father for the simple reason that Neil's acting around him as his son is more genuine. If you're intimidated by your leading actor, then it really comes off in Neil's scenes with him. Diamond's own nervousness, which he revealed in VH-1's BEHIND THE MUSIC back in 2001 underpins the drama very well between the father/son dynamic. Even with Neil's best friend, Bubba (Franklin Ajaye), the story is fun to watch and the opening number in the film's first five minutes is a very nice homage to Al Jolson when Diamond's Jess Robin dons black face to cover for a back-up singer who was arrested for stealing a car.It's the soundtrack that makes this film work well, too. America, Hello Again, Love On the Rocks, Songs of Life, Amazed & Confused, and even You Baby, Hey Louise and On the Robert E. Lee from the party celebrating of all things, a firing, still hold up nearly 32 years after they were written...something Neil Diamond always manages to do well. All his songs hold up through the years and this film and its 9-time platinum soundtrack are no exception. Crank up the audio when he kicks the power into high gear in the finale of America. It has a strong bass track, great lyrics and his experienced band sure bring this song, as well as this movie to life.My Dad was right to bring this home 30 years ago. I just wish we could watch it together on his birthday. But now, I watch it for him. Thank you Dad for giving me the gift of Neil Diamond's movie and music when I was 11. Don't leave this planet without watching this movie at least once. It's a true classic in every sense of the word!",5,Great Drama! Great Songs!!

41732,A103KNDW8GN92L,078201061X,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","&quot;The Jazz Singer (1980)&quot; marks Neil Diamond's theatrical debut as an actor, that is, unless you count The Band's &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, in which ND makes a cameo appearance. His performance in &quot;TJS&quot; as an assistant cantor isn't half-bad. Complimenting Neil's role quite nicely is an Oscar-winning caliber performance by the late, great Sir Laurence Olivier, who is stupendous as a stern, yet stubborn Jewish senior cantor. I've viewed this movie quite a number of times, and what I was expecting from the first viewing was an exact remake of the original 1927 version, but that wasn't quite the case, although I've never seen the entire original version. The premise of this version is sort of like the original, in that the premise of the story tells of an assistant cantor, Jess Robinovich, aka Robin (Diamond), who'd rather write and record songs for pure enjoyment and  please his soon-to-be-fan base than remain in the synagogue and please his senior-cantor father (Olivier). Catlin Adams (Rivka Robinovich) and Lucie Arnaz (Molly Bell) offer fine supporting roles as ND's present, then future &quot;significant other(s)&quot;. Molly is first Jess' manager, then his future wife. The scenes focusing on Jess and Molly's relationship will tug at your heart strings, so it's nice to have a box of Kleenex handy. Comedian/Actor Franklyn Ajaye has a role as one of Jess' backup singers. Neil Diamond also wrote the songs that also appear on the soundtrack, and they're good ones: &quot;Love On The Rocks&quot;, 'America&quot;, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, &quot;You Baby&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; and &quot;Songs Of Life.&quot; It is also rumored that ND currently has a theatrical project in the works slated for release sometime in 2001. It's about time! Please don't wait another twenty years to release the next one, Neil!

At some point the wife comes out to California to try to take him back to New York and some of the lines between these two women are simply superb. When the wife, played by Catlin Adams asks Lucie Arnaz about the relationship that is taking place in California... and how far it has actually gone, Lucie replies ""I offered him my body and he settled for a pizza.""But Neil Diamond stays in California and one day is visited by the father who dreams of taking his son back to his beginning... back to continue the family tradition of being a Cantor. The son tells the father he must stay, and when the father sees the new woman in his son's life, he rips his clothing, a tradition to communicate that for him, his son is now dead!In the end, the family is reunited, but some of the scenes between father and son are priceless jewels of attempting to step out of traditional roles.A dear friend of the family visits Yussel and asks that he return in his role of Cantor for the festivity of Yum Kippur. His father is now too old and too ill due to high-blood pressure to sing. He says that Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, is the Jewish day of repentance, and reconciliation. So... there is no better time like the present for father and son to reunite.When Neil Diamond returns to the Synagogue, he delivers some of the best lyrics of this movie... the song is deeply moving.The movie opens and closes with the timeless classic ""America"" a song that for all of us, immigrants, reaching US soil in search of liberty, opportunity and the pursuit of happiness, this remains the most moving music of all.As with Neil Diamond the best part of the movie are the songs, and here we get the best of Neil Diamond.

All of the actors are very good and Laurence Olivier as Diamond's father, a very observant Jew, a cantor, is brilliant. Olivier is the foil against Diamond's need to abandon his religion, violate many of its principles, marry a non-Jewish girl, and sing popular songs that he wrote to mass audiences. We are able to identify with both Diamond and with Olivier, and with the girl as well.The problems are, first that the story is simplistic. The struggle between the parent and child is not new. Yet, as previously stated, the acting overcomes this problem and makes the story interesting and entertaining. Second, there are many errors about Jewish practices. Either the advisors to the film did not know Judaism as well as they claimed or the director and the company decided to ignore their advice.

The movie has nothing to do with anyone singing jazz, so be aware of this.

He sings with his strong-willed father Cantor Rabinovitch (Laurence Olivier)who has plans for Yussel to take over as the main cantor once he retires. Yussel is also married to his childhood sweetheart, Rivka (Catlin Adams), who works at a local Jewish school. On the side, Yussel also writes songs for a struggling black singing group.  There is one troubling scene in which Yussel performs in black face and a wig when a member of the quartet gets arrested.  Yussel's life takes a sharp curve when his well-meaning friend and singing buddy Bubba (Franklin Ajaye)pitches one of his songs to a popular singer, Keith Lennox (Paul Nicholas). The song, ""Love on the Rocks"" is being butchered and the record producer wants the composer to help.  Yussel grapples with his desire to go but his wife (who refuses to join him in LA) and father argue with him before capitulating to him. Once in LA, Molly Bell (Arnaz) encourages Yussel to perform his song his way.  Tempers flare and Yussel and Molly are dismissed.  The two embark on a journey to jump-start Yussel - now known as Jess Robin.  The two finally get a break with Jess opening for a frontliner and fall in love.  Jess and Molly fight these feelings because Jess wants Rivka to join him.  Eventually, Rivka flies to LA to convince Jess to return to their life in New York but Jess refuse, having tasted fame.  The two part and love blooms for Molly and Jess.  Of course, Cantor Rabinovitch flies out to correct and retrieve his son.  Tempers flare and the elder man disowns his son for divorcing his wife and taking up with a non-Jewish woman.  This deflates Jess who leaves and goes on a long sojourn.  He returns to find he has a son but still no contact with his father.  In the end, Jess and his father are reconciled when the elder sees his son perform at their old synagogue and then in concert.",4,Neil Diamond's singing IS the movie,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2489,"['Neil', 'Diamond', 'huge', 'favorite', 'mine', 'rich', 'voice', 'songs', 'speak', 'life', 'love', 'discovery', 'what', 'matters', 'life', 'Having', 'said', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'decent', 'actor', 'not', 'great', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'singing', 'interacting', 'Luci', 'Arnaz', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'anyone', 'singing', 'jazz', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'Yes', 'melodrama', 'dreams', 'fulfilled', 'family', 'break-up', 'love', 'refound', 'decent', 'entertainment.PLOT', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'plot', 'NYC', 'super-talented', 'singer/songwriter', 'Yussel', 'Rabinovitch', 'Diamond', 'who', 'primarily', 'Jewish', 'cantor', 'poor', 'synagogue', 'strong-willed', 'father', 'Cantor', 'Rabinovitch', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'who', 'plans', 'Yussel', 'take', 'over', 'main', 'cantor', 'Yussel', 'also', 'married', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Rivka', 'Catlin', 'Adams', 'who', 'local', 'Jewish', 'school', 'side', 'Yussel', 'also', 'songs', 'struggling', 'black', 'singing', 'group', 'one', 'troubling', 'scene', 'Yussel', 'black', 'face', 'wig', 'when', 'member', 'quartet', 'arrested', 'Yussel', 'life', 'sharp', 'curve', 'when', 'well-meaning', 'friend', 'singing', 'buddy', 'Bubba', 'Franklin', 'Ajaye', 'one', 'songs', 'popular', 'singer', 'Keith', 'Lennox', 'Paul', 'Nicholas', 'song', 'Love', 'Rocks', 'being', 'butchered', 'record', 'producer', 'composer', 'help', 'Yussel', 'grapples', 'desire', 'go', 'wife', 'who', 'join', 'LA', 'argue', 'capitulating', 'Once', 'LA', 'Molly', 'Bell', 'Arnaz', 'Yussel', 'perform', 'song', 'way', 'Tempers', 'flare', 'Yussel', 'Molly', 'are', 'dismissed', 'two', 'embark', 'journey', 'jump-start', 'Yussel', 'now', 'known', 'Jess', 'Robin', 'two', 'finally', 'get', 'break', 'Jess', 'opening', 'frontliner', 'fall', 'love', 'Jess', 'Molly', 'fight', 'feelings', 'Jess', 'Rivka', 'join', 'Eventually', 'Rivka', 'LA', 'convince', 'Jess', 'return', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'Jess', 'refuse', 'having', 'tasted', 'fame', 'two', 'part', 'love', 'blooms', 'Molly', 'Jess', 'course', 'Cantor', 'Rabinovitch', 'out', 'correct', 'retrieve', 'son', 'Tempers', 'flare', 'elder', 'man', 'son', 'divorcing', 'wife', 'taking', 'up', 'non-Jewish', 'woman', 'Jess', 'who', 'long', 'sojourn', 'find', 'son', 'still', 'contact', 'father', 'end', 'Jess', 'father', 'are', 'reconciled', 'when', 'elder', 'son', 'perform', 'old', 'synagogue', 'then', 'concert']",The Jazz Singer
41745,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,078201061X,Jeff Pearlman,"[4, 6]","A year ago I bought ""The Rose"" and wondered if Neil Diamond's bid for big-screen success ever made it to DVD.  Then I saw a used copy going, to my horror, for 54 freakin' bucks at a local music/video store.  Fortunately this rerelease came out without my taking the very silly plunge I am all too capable of.I like Neil OK, but not so much that I could ever let myself give this four or five stars.  On the other hand, this movie is far from the disaster critics said it was.  Diamond is no, well, Laurence Olivier, but in my view does nothing so bad to deserve ""winning"" the Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor of 1980.As for Olivier, I gotta wonder why he did this movie.  I have to agree that his Yiddish accent is spotty at best.  Sometimes he successfully evokes the old men back in my synagogue, one of whom actually smacked my friend for mispronouncing some Hebrew while praying at my Bar Mitzvah.  (Good times.)  Other times the accent slides into something from Ren and Stimpy.  Also, his character and that of Neil's wife are so one-dimensional and humorless that ""Jess Robin""'s choice between his cantor past and the lure of pop stardom is telegraphed from the outset.  In my experience, Orthodox Jews can be exceptionally witty and multi-dimensional as well as rigid and disciplined.  You'd never know it from this script.Much better written is Lucie Arnaz's role as a pushy, clever agent Neil meets in L.A. and falls in love with.  She is definitely the life of the movie.Nice little moments:  unspoken awkwardness when Arnaz proudly presents Diamond with a ham dinner he can't eat; Olivier reaching up to kiss the Mezuzah absent from Neil's L.A. doorway.  Scary little moments:  ""partying"" with Franklin Ajaye and homies with a song about...the Robert E. Lee!; the bearded, whiskey-bent and heck-bound Neil running off to wow the yahoos in a COUNTRY & WESTERN bar (big song:  ""You Are My Sunshine""!)Of course, the best scene is when Olivier tears his clothes and cries out the Hebrew prayer of mourning when he finds Neil living with shiksa Arnaz.Watch for Paul Nicholas, then only 2 years removed from his own Top 10 hit ""Heaven On the 7th Floor"", as a prissy pop star, and Ernie Hudson as Neil's antagonist in a really cringeworthy scene in the early going.But don't watch for jazz.  There's not a note of it to be found here.

It has little connection with Al Jolson or the previous remake with Danny Thomas. Only once early in the film does  Diamond gets in blackface--for a gig with a black group in a black club. Diamond plays a fifth generation cantor who has to battle his cantor-father, Laurence Olivier, of all people, to break free from tradition and become a commercial success as a singer.The soundtrack of Neil Diamond songs is strong and effective. ""Hello Again"" and ""Love on the Rocks"" are standouts with special kudos going to ""America"" which is thrilling in a Diamond reprise in the final moments of the film--touching, heartwarming, and a tear jerker.The plot is well-constructed and involving. Because his father has disowned him, Diamond leaves his successful career to become a vagabond for a year. The scene in which Diamond sings a traditional Jewish song in a synagogue is quite moving.Diamond does a creditable job as an actor. The movie is well-paced and, for me, not in the least boring. Perhaps the movie got a bad rap in the beginning; it was labeled a bomb. At first I confused it with ""The Jolson Story"" with Larry Parks, thinking it was a remake of that successful film.

I do like to sing though, as you can tell by my wonderous tales of bands I've fronted. Let me tell you about another one. I've always been a Neil Diamond fan, so I fronted a speed metal Neil Diamond cover band called Moldy Applecore. We took Neil's music and sped it up.

We threw ""Grand old Flag"" and ""Born in the USA"" in the second 20 minutes of the song. The crowd went nuts and felt more patriotic than when Kerrie Strug ran into the pommel cow when he hip broke in 95.This movie is the blueprint for moldy applecore.

It was gratifying to find a Jewish story on the big screen, too, with Shabbat and Yom Kippur services and Hebrew songs, juxtaposed with Diamond's secular hits.  Looking back after 26 years of life experience and three extended stays in Israel, I can't help but to have warm memories of this movie.

41769,AZCDCO6KK2T81,078201061X,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 4]","This review is for my wife, Marilyn, as our wedding song came from it:I was a senior in high school when this movie first hit the theaters and I loved it then and I love it now.  Yes, the acting is a bit hammy by Laurence Olivier who was attempting to appease the Jewish population after giving an Oscar-nominated performance a year or so before for playing with great relish a vicious Nazi who tortures, via dentist equipment, Dustin Hoffman in ""The Marathon Man.""  Can anyone forget his famous line from that film, ""Is it safe?""  In addition, Lucie Arnez is no great actress, but what she lacks in talent she makes up for in her charming honest portrayal as Diamond's compassionate agent.  Lastly, Neil Diamond is certainly no great actor either, no matter how much I love him as musician and entertainer, but this movie somehow works despite these noted flaws and some rather amateurish direction by Richard Fleicher.  Perhaps the movie succeeds because the plot is as timeless as Hollywood gets.We all love to experience someone achieving his or her goals and that's why these kinds of movies withstand the test of time even when the critics blast them.  Consider the following:  While Olivier hams it up a bit, he is still great to watch and demands your respect.  Lucie Arnez is disarmingly charming in her role as an agent trying to help someone she believes in, but also trying not to be caught up in her client's personal life.  Of course, Neil Diamond is no actor, but he is pleasing to watch and he's certainly believable in a role that he was destined to play as it mirrors his own story quite a bit; he came from a family of dentists and was expected to be one also, but he dropped out in his last semester and hit the road with a backpack and his guitar --the rest is history.  Lastly, the music is awesome.  Diamond was at the height of his career musically when he did this film and the soundtrack produced 3 #1 songs and was one of Billboard's longest running soundtrack best-sellers.  This was no fluke as Diamond had already won praise for his song ""Be"" from the film ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull.""  He knows how to write music for films and I wish he had more opportunities to do so.While the movie wasn't necessarily ""a hit,"" but it did find a substantial audience and made a good profit.  Something about it made it work even though it is admittedly flawed.  It went on to greater success on VHS and DVD and this new addition will probably sell just as well or better with the improved sound clarity that the other releases seriously lacked.  I was happy to read here that I wasn't the only one turning up the volume for the dialogue and lower it for the music segments.  That drove me nuts in the earlier releases.Moving along, although I am Christian, I grew up in a mostly Jewish section in Brooklyn, New York, in fact, not far from where Diamond and Streisand actually grew up.  My home was near Diamond's high school.  Anyhow, between that and having dated a wonderful Jewish girl most of my high school days I grew to appreciate the Jewish faith and culture.  My neighborhood local theater re-released this film numerous times and I went to see it each time they played it.  It was the first movie I took my wife to see back in April of 1983 and she loved it and cried at the end as many in the theater did.  The #1 song ""Hello Again"" went on to become ""our song"" and the one we danced to at our wedding as your spouse should also be your best friend and that's what the song is about and even the movie as well to some degree as Diamond's wife in the film never shared his interests or desires although she was aware of them since they were little kids growing up in the same neighborhood.  She kept crying how he had changed when he became a pop-rock star when in reality his desires had simply come true.  All she ever attempted to do in the film was either hold him back or ignore his dreams and a spouse should never do either of those.Having said all this it is obvious that my love for Diamond's music, Hollywoods tireless theme of success against the odds, watching any performance by the great Olivier, and sharing this film with the woman I would eventually spend the next 24 years of my life with make me a bias reviewer here.  I concede that observation, but still contend that in spite of this film's obvious flaws, it is still great entertainment.Enjoy this classic!",4,The Jazz Singer & Neil Diamond ROCK!,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,4408,"['review', 'wife', 'Marilyn', 'wedding', 'song', 'came', 'was', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'loved', 'then', 'love', 'now', 'Yes', 'acting', 'bit', 'hammy', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'who', 'was', 'attempting', 'appease', 'Jewish', 'population', 'giving', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'year', 'so', 'playing', 'great', 'relish', 'vicious', 'Nazi', 'who', 'dentist', 'equipment', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'Can', 'anyone', 'forget', 'famous', 'line', 'film', 'safe', 'addition', 'Lucie', 'Arnez', 'great', 'actress', 'what', 'talent', 'up', 'charming', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Diamond', 'compassionate', 'agent', 'Lastly', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'certainly', 'no', 'great', 'actor', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'musician', 'entertainer', 'movie', 'somehow', 'noted', 'flaws', 'rather', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'Richard', 'Fleicher', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'plot', 'as', 'timeless', 'Hollywood', 'gets.We', 'love', 'experience', 'someone', 'achieving', 'goals', 'why', 'kinds', 'movies', 'withstand', 'test', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'critics', 'blast', 'Consider', 'following', 'Olivier', 'hams', 'up', 'bit', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'demands', 'respect', 'Lucie', 'Arnez', 'disarmingly', 'charming', 'role', 'agent', 'trying', 'help', 'someone', 'also', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'client', 'personal', 'life', 'course', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'actor', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'certainly', 'believable', 'role', 'was', 'destined', 'play', 'own', 'story', 'quite', 'bit', 'came', 'family', 'dentists', 'was', 'expected', 'be', 'one', 'also', 'dropped', 'out', 'last', 'semester', 'hit', 'road', 'backpack', 'guitar', 'rest', 'history', 'Lastly', 'music', 'awesome', 'Diamond', 'was', 'height', 'career', 'musically', 'when', 'did', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'produced', '3', '1', 'songs', 'was', 'one', 'Billboard', 'longest', 'running', 'soundtrack', 'best-sellers', 'was', 'fluke', 'Diamond', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'praise', 'song', 'Be', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'Livingston', 'Seagull', 'how', 'write', 'music', 'films', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'opportunities', 'do', 'so.While', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'hit', 'did', 'find', 'substantial', 'audience', 'made', 'good', 'profit', 'Something', 'made', 'work', 'even', 'admittedly', 'flawed', 'went', 'greater', 'success', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'new', 'addition', 'will', 'probably', 'sell', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'improved', 'sound', 'clarity', 'other', 'releases', 'seriously', 'lacked', 'was', 'happy', 'read', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'turning', 'up', 'volume', 'dialogue', 'lower', 'music', 'segments', 'drove', 'nuts', 'earlier', 'releases.Moving', 'along', 'am', 'Christian', 'grew', 'up', 'mostly', 'Jewish', 'section', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'fact', 'not', 'far', 'where', 'Diamond', 'Streisand', 'actually', 'grew', 'up', 'My', 'home', 'was', 'Diamond', 'high', 'school', 'Anyhow', 'having', 'dated', 'wonderful', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'culture', 'neighborhood', 'local', 'theater', 're-released', 'film', 'numerous', 'times', 'went', 'see', 'time', 'played', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'took', 'wife', 'see', 'back', 'April', '1983', 'loved', 'cried', 'end', 'many', 'theater', 'did', '1', 'song', 'Hello', 'Again', 'went', 'become', 'song', 'one', 'danced', 'wedding', 'spouse', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'what', 'song', 'even', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'degree', 'Diamond', 'wife', 'film', 'never', 'shared', 'interests', 'desires', 'was', 'aware', 'were', 'little', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'kept', 'crying', 'how', 'had', 'changed', 'when', 'became', 'pop-rock', 'star', 'when', 'reality', 'desires', 'had', 'simply', 'come', 'true', 'ever', 'attempted', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'hold', 'back', 'ignore', 'dreams', 'spouse', 'should', 'never', 'do', 'those.Having', 'said', 'obvious', 'love', 'Diamond', 'music', 'Hollywoods', 'tireless', 'theme', 'success', 'odds', 'watching', 'performance', 'great', 'Olivier', 'sharing', 'film', 'woman', 'would', 'eventually', 'spend', 'next', '24', 'years', 'life', 'make', 'bias', 'reviewer', 'here', 'concede', 'observation', 'still', 'contend', 'spite', 'film', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'still', 'great', 'entertainment.Enjoy', 'classic']",The Jazz Singer

I feel watching it now it's gotten better and better.  The extras are pretty good with long detailed information about the main actors.  I wish Neil or Lucie would have done commentary, but still a winner in my book",5,Better than when I first saw it,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,692,"['Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'critics', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'again', '15', 'years', 'still', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'everyone', 'did', 'great', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'Lucie', 'Arnez', 'fan', 'are', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'now', 'anxious', 'listen', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'soundtrack', 'again', 'Wonderful', 'songs', 'great', 'acting', 'everyone', 'critics', 'stated', 'was', 'BOMB', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'movie', '116', 'minutes', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'feel', 'watching', 'now', 'gotten', 'better', 'better', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'long', 'detailed', 'information', 'main', 'actors', 'wish', 'Neil', 'Lucie', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'commentary', 'still', 'winner', 'book']",The Jazz Singer
