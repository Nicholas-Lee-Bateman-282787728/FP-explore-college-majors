I was blown away that beautiful Dyan Cannon has a great singing voice. Amy Irving is also enjoyable to watch and listen to. But obviously Willie himself is the star of the show, and his singing is unbeatable. I find myself clapping at the end of ""Angel Flying Too Close"" while watching this video-- hey, it's that good!The story is pretty trite, but there are some hilarious parts in it. In fact, if you look at it as a comedy only, then it's a great movie!I wish they would re-release this movie on DVD, since the VHS quality of this reel is strikingly inferior to present-day DVD technology. I finally relented and bought the VHS, which, if history continues itself, will result in the DVD becoming available soon!UPDATE--OCTOBER, 2006--Well, I was right. It took a year, a little longer than I expected, but you can now buy this on DVD as a two-in-one package with Pure Country. You can thank me for making this available on DVD!! :)",5,The music by itself makes it 5 stars,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,1101,"['purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'showcase', 'Willie', 'band', 'movie', 'audiences', 'rather', 'shoot', 'Oscar', 'then', 'music', 'outstanding', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'beautiful', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'great', 'singing', 'voice', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'listen', 'obviously', 'Willie', 'star', 'show', 'singing', 'unbeatable', 'find', 'clapping', 'end', 'Angel', 'Flying', 'Too', 'Close', 'watching', 'video', 'hey', 'good', 'story', 'pretty', 'trite', 'are', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'fact', 'look', 'comedy', 'only', 'then', 'great', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', 're-release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'quality', 'reel', 'strikingly', 'inferior', 'present-day', 'DVD', 'technology', 'finally', 'relented', 'bought', 'VHS', 'history', 'will', 'result', 'DVD', 'becoming', 'available', 'soon', 'UPDATE', 'OCTOBER', '2006', 'Well', 'was', 'right', 'took', 'year', 'little', 'longer', 'expected', 'can', 'now', 'buy', 'DVD', 'two-in-one', 'package', 'Pure', 'Country', 'can', 'thank', 'making', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A

This compilation of Willie Nelson performances is a classic example.  There's an introduction by Willie himself, but you almost have to wonder if it wasn't recorded for another collection entirely.  The intro suggests that we're going to start our musical selections with some oldies from his suit-and-tie days (remember them?).  Instead it kicks off with a then-pretty-current version  &#34;On the Road Again.&#34;  I joked to a friend that he didn't look all that different in the so-called &#34;suit and tie&#34; days at all.  A bit later on, however, you do get some vintage era footage of &#34;Hello Walls&#34; and &#34;Crazy,&#34;  clips fans have likely seen before.  There's voiceover narration all the while, and the clips are abbreviated.  Not good.I realize this is now a rarity--and will be considered by some fans to be a collector's item of sorts--but it really IS only for collectors unless you can get it at a significantly discounted price.  There are a number of great performance moments here, but they are sloppily sequenced and too many are fragmentary.However you slice it, this 45 minute melange is a kind of slapdash effort and--since it's out of print and available as of this writing only at some outlandishly high prices--it may not be the wisest of purchases.  There are certainly better introduction to Willie Nelson's work out there.  Shop around.NOTE:  There seems to be some error on this page (for WILLIE NELSON: ON THE ROAD AGAIN), since just about all the reviews here are for Willlie's  1980 dramatic film HONEYSUCKLE ROSE.  The song &#34;On the Road Again&#34; was included in that film, and that may explain the confusion, at least in part.  Prospective purchasers of this rather abbreviated music video should take note.  There are many rave reviews for the film below, but they don't have anything to do with this particular VHS product.",3,"A Slapdash Musical Melange (of some really great music, but still...)",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2137,"['still', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'true', 'DVD', 'era', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'aware', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'VHS', 'days', 'seemed', 'be', 'good', 'deal', 'questionlble', '34', 'budget', 'line', '34', 'musical', 'product', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'approved', 'artist', 'compilation', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'classic', 'example', 'introduction', 'Willie', 'almost', 'have', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'recorded', 'collection', 'entirely', 'intro', ""'re"", 'going', 'start', 'musical', 'selections', 'oldies', 'suit-and-tie', 'days', 'remember', 'Instead', 'off', 'then-pretty-current', 'version', '34', 'Road', 'Again.', '34', 'joked', 'friend', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'different', 'so-called', '34', 'suit', 'tie', '34', 'days', 'bit', 'later', 'however', 'do', 'get', 'vintage', 'era', 'footage', '34', 'Hello', 'Walls', '34', '34', 'Crazy', '34', 'clips', 'fans', 'have', 'likely', 'seen', 'before', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'while', 'clips', 'are', 'abbreviated', 'Not', 'good.I', 'realize', 'now', 'rarity', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'fans', 'be', 'collector', 'item', 'sorts', 'really', 'only', 'collectors', 'can', 'get', 'significantly', 'discounted', 'price', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'performance', 'moments', 'here', 'are', 'sloppily', 'sequenced', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'fragmentary.However', 'slice', '45', 'minute', 'melange', 'kind', 'slapdash', 'effort', 'print', 'available', 'writing', 'only', 'outlandishly', 'high', 'prices', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wisest', 'purchases', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'introduction', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'work', 'out', 'there', 'Shop', 'around.NOTE', 'be', 'error', 'page', 'WILLIE', 'NELSON', 'ON', 'ROAD', 'AGAIN', 'just', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'Willlie', '1980', 'dramatic', 'film', 'HONEYSUCKLE', 'ROSE', 'song', '34', 'Road', 'Again', '34', 'was', 'included', 'film', 'may', 'explain', 'confusion', 'least', 'part', 'Prospective', 'purchasers', 'rather', 'abbreviated', 'music', 'video', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'are', 'many', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'particular', 'VHS', 'product']",N/A
232162,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300268195,James D. Leverton,"[8, 8]","1980's ""Honeysuckle Rose"" is best known as the first film to star Willie Nelson, but its true shining star is Dyan Cannon, in a wonderful, atypically understated performance as Willie's loyal wife.Nelson stars as Buck Bonham, a Nelsonesque country singer who arrives home after an extended road tour to spend time with wife and former musical partner Viv (Cannon), who has retired to raise their preteen son Jamie (Joey Floyd).  After an extended, and very well-filmed, family reunion sequence, Buck heads back out onto the road, except without his longtime lead guitarist Garland Ramsay (Slim Pickens), who himself is retiring to spend time with his wife (Priscilla Pointer).  In his place, Viv talks Buck into taking Garland's daughter Lily (Amy Irving).  Unfortunately, Buck and Lily get involved in an affair which threatens to destroy Buck's marriage, his relationship with Garland and his band, and Lily's relationship with her father, to say nothing of Viv.That's it for plot, but obviously the plot is not the main attraction here.  The main attraction is the incredible musical talent of Willie Nelson and his ""family"" of musicians, whose performances take up nearly half the film's 120 minute running time.  Some of the musical highlights include the film's theme, ""On the Road Again,"" which was Oscar-nominated, along with Nelson and Cannon's duets on ""Loving You is Easier"" and ""Uncloudy Skies.""  In fact, not only does Cannon deliver an outstanding performance as the wronged woman, she reveals a previously unknown singing talent, as does Irving.  Pickens is also believable as a veteran picker, although all his guitar work was dubbed.Nelson is fine in the lead, but he's basically playing himself. However, this performance did led to several subsequent starring roles in the 1980's.  Irving and Pickens are also very good as always, but Cannon is transcendant.  Usually specializing in high-strung wierdos who seem to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown, here she is beautifully understated, to the point she barely speaks above a whisper in some scenes.  She is at her best after she learns of the affair, and reacts the way any wife would when betrayed by her husband and a girl she practically helped raise.  The scene where she confronts the two during a concert is alone worth the price of the cassette.Director Jerry Schatzberg helms with a sure hand and he and his editors do a masterful job of melding the extensive concert scenes into the surrounding action and ensuring the film never lags for a moment.  Incredibly, this film was adapted from the classic film ""Intermezzo.""  Even more incredibly, it stands on its own as a fine film and excellent showcase for one of the greatest singer/songwriters this country has ever produced, as well as a fine character actress who has sadly been absent from the screen for far too long.A note:  Since the film was not a box-office success, it was retitled ""On the Road Again"" for its TV showings to remind viewers of its most famous asset.  That is why the onscreen title on the VHS tape reads:  ""Honeysuckle Rose, aka On the Road Again.""  As for the tape, it is in a pan-and-scan fullscreen format which ruins the effect of its many concert sequences, which were (along with the film) filmed in panavision 2:35:1.

232165,A18M68DE1Y6W51,6300268195,Wendy Kaplan,"[26, 28]","One of the feel-good movies of the 80s, ""Honeysuckle Rose"" wears well. Willie Nelson plays Buck Bonham, a country superstar (surprise!) who's about to go out on tour when he loses a key member of the band. No problem. Buck's loyal, loving wife (Dyan Cannon), herself a former superstar and now Buck's business manager, books the young, attractive, and professionally untried daughter of a longtime family friend (Slim Pickens) to temporarily join the tour until a seasoned replacement can be found. It turns out the girl (Amy Irving, young, sexy, and beautiful) can really belt out a tune. And that's not all.Before you can say ""broken heart,"" Buck and the girl are in bed together, and their mutual passion is there for all to see as they sing together on stage (by the way, Irving has one heck of a voice, and her duets with Nelson are sweet and lovely). How long will it take for the Missus to find out?Despite the open disapproval of his band members and country friends such as Amy Harris (who has a couple of solos as well), Buck continues the dangerous affair--until somebody tips off his wife and she appears unexpectedly at one of the concert venues. There ensues a great deal of melodrama, most of it played out in song, like the classic ""You Were Always On My Mind."" Unfortunately, Cannon, who is supposed to be a country great in this movie, sings as well, and her flat, untrained and grating voice is just awful.The plot sidesteps into a silly trip to Mexico with Slim Pickens, the outraged father and friend, during which Bonham comes to his senses. All works out just fine in the end, and the viewer ends up smiling, humming country songs, and rewinding the tape to start it up all over again.",5,What's Not to Like?,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,1708,"['One', 'feel-good', 'movies', '80s', 'Honeysuckle', 'Rose', 'well', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Buck', 'Bonham', 'country', 'superstar', 'surprise', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'tour', 'when', 'key', 'member', 'band', 'problem', 'Buck', 'loyal', 'loving', 'wife', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'former', 'superstar', 'now', 'Buck', 'business', 'manager', 'books', 'young', 'attractive', 'professionally', 'untried', 'daughter', 'longtime', 'family', 'friend', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'temporarily', 'join', 'tour', 'seasoned', 'replacement', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'girl', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'young', 'sexy', 'beautiful', 'can', 'really', 'belt', 'out', 'tune', 'not', 'can', 'say', 'broken', 'heart', 'Buck', 'girl', 'are', 'bed', 'together', 'mutual', 'passion', 'there', 'see', 'sing', 'together', 'stage', 'way', 'Irving', 'one', 'heck', 'voice', 'duets', 'Nelson', 'are', 'sweet', 'lovely', 'How', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'Missus', 'find', 'out', 'open', 'disapproval', 'band', 'members', 'country', 'friends', 'such', 'Amy', 'Harris', 'who', 'couple', 'solos', 'well', 'Buck', 'dangerous', 'affair', 'somebody', 'tips', 'wife', 'unexpectedly', 'one', 'concert', 'venues', 'great', 'deal', 'melodrama', 'most', 'played', 'out', 'song', 'classic', 'Were', 'Always', 'My', 'Mind', 'Unfortunately', 'Cannon', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'country', 'great', 'movie', 'sings', 'well', 'flat', 'untrained', 'grating', 'voice', 'just', 'awful.The', 'plot', 'sidesteps', 'silly', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'outraged', 'father', 'friend', 'Bonham', 'senses', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'end', 'viewer', 'up', 'smiling', 'humming', 'country', 'songs', 'rewinding', 'tape', 'start', 'up', 'over', 'again']",N/A
