Unfortunately, the film fails to explore the motivations behind its characters. Also, it doesn't sufficiently connect the protagonist (Claudio) with the other characters--too much about their relationships is left unexplored. This film is worth viewing; just expect to think that it's beginning as the credits start to roll.",3,Good movie with weak plot,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,466,"['Days', 'nicely', 'produced', 'acted', 'diminished', 'plot', 'unusual', 'twist', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'admirable', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'explore', 'motivations', 'characters', 'Also', ""n't"", 'sufficiently', 'connect', 'protagonist', 'Claudio', 'other', 'characters', 'too', 'much', 'relationships', 'left', 'unexplored', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'expect', 'think', 'beginning', 'credits', 'start', 'roll']",N/A

720963,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B00006LPHD,Dave Beards,"[6, 11]","Gay themed foreign films are usually my most sort after gay themed film - not only are the actors usually sexier, but they seem to have a more emotionally honest edge to them. So I had great expectations when I viewed Days.I must say I was rather disappointed. The premise sounded good: HIV positive man and HIV negative man decide to partake in unsafe sex. It sounded as though there would be a wonderful exploration of the challenges of gay men in an era of sex where it appears that 'unsafe' is becoming more acceptable. But in Days we really do not get to see any of the reasoning behind such an act, or many of the emotions that come from becoming HIV positive. The characters are one dimensional and the truth is the audience doesn't really care who becomes infected or if they die.Not that Days is a bad movie. There are some wonderful emotive moments between the HIV positive guy and his (ex)lover. The HIV positive man goes through alot of grief concerning his act of unsafe sex with a negative (and nieve) younger man. Though the trouble is we don't really get to explore why he chose that option.This movie could have been alot more than it is. But as it stands, it is nothing more than a sign of the times where more and more gay men are choosing to completely ignore the warnings of unsafe sex and AIDS. Shame really, because this is one area of the gay lifestyle that needs to be explored in queer film.",3,"Disappointing, but not without merit.",1045699200,"02 20, 2003",2003,1417,"['Gay', 'themed', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'most', 'sort', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'actors', 'usually', 'sexier', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'edge', 'So', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'when', 'viewed', 'Days.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'premise', 'sounded', 'good', 'HIV', 'positive', 'man', 'HIV', 'negative', 'man', 'decide', 'partake', 'unsafe', 'sex', 'sounded', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'exploration', 'challenges', 'gay', 'men', 'era', 'sex', 'where', ""'unsafe"", 'becoming', 'more', 'acceptable', 'Days', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'reasoning', 'such', 'act', 'many', 'emotions', 'come', 'becoming', 'HIV', 'positive', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'truth', 'audience', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'who', 'becomes', 'infected', 'die.Not', 'Days', 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderful', 'emotive', 'moments', 'HIV', 'positive', 'guy', 'ex', 'lover', 'HIV', 'positive', 'man', 'alot', 'grief', 'concerning', 'act', 'unsafe', 'sex', 'negative', 'nieve', 'younger', 'man', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'explore', 'why', 'chose', 'option.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'more', 'nothing', 'more', 'sign', 'times', 'where', 'more', 'more', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'choosing', 'completely', 'ignore', 'warnings', 'unsafe', 'sex', 'AIDS', 'Shame', 'really', 'one', 'area', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'explored', 'queer', 'film']",N/A
720964,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006LPHD,Grady Harp,"[32, 34]","DAYS (""GIORNI"") is a well crafted Italian film by writer/director Laura Muscardin about present day relationships in a segment of our poplulation we infrequently view.  Claudio is an AIDS patient of 10 years, living an apparently normal life as a working, commited executive, keeping his activities monitored by the small alarm on his medications case.  Much of this film focuses on Caludio's compulsive medical visits and self care in a brave life maintained with the latest AIDS medications.  He is in a longterm relationship that has grown as regimented and predictable as his medication timer...until his eyes engage a young waiter (Andrea) with whom he eventually, if carefully, enters into a passionate love affair.  The new couple enjoy the highs of new love despite the warnings that Claudio is HIV+ and Andrea is HIV-.  The disease is discussed but Andrea elects to ignore prophylaxis.  This thrilling but perilous affair eventually ends when Claudio feels he can no longer accept the fact that he is a 'doomed man' and leaves all his past behind - home, new and old lovers, family, friends.  The fallout from this decision brings the film to its close - reality steps into the forefront.  Though the theme of this beautifully photographed and directed story is depressing, the actors create moments of some of the tenderest aspects of love.  Thomas Trabacchi as the HIV+ Claudio and Ricardo Salerno as his beautifuly naive new lover Andrea give pitch perfect performances.  The film deals with AIDS in a very sophisticated way, showing the interplay between doctor and patient as well as any film has done.  Highly recommended - just don't be mislead by the cover of the DVD which leads you to think this is either a comedy or a light love story.",5,Another valid view of relationships,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,1756,"['DAYS', 'GIORNI', 'well', 'crafted', 'Italian', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Laura', 'Muscardin', 'present', 'day', 'relationships', 'segment', 'poplulation', 'infrequently', 'view', 'Claudio', 'AIDS', 'patient', '10', 'years', 'living', 'apparently', 'normal', 'life', 'working', 'commited', 'executive', 'keeping', 'activities', 'monitored', 'small', 'alarm', 'medications', 'case', 'Much', 'film', 'Caludio', 'compulsive', 'medical', 'visits', 'care', 'brave', 'life', 'maintained', 'latest', 'AIDS', 'medications', 'longterm', 'relationship', 'grown', 'regimented', 'predictable', 'medication', 'timer', 'eyes', 'engage', 'young', 'waiter', 'Andrea', 'whom', 'eventually', 'carefully', 'enters', 'passionate', 'love', 'affair', 'new', 'couple', 'enjoy', 'highs', 'new', 'love', 'warnings', 'Claudio', 'HIV+', 'Andrea', 'HIV-', 'disease', 'discussed', 'Andrea', 'ignore', 'prophylaxis', 'thrilling', 'perilous', 'affair', 'eventually', 'when', 'Claudio', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'accept', 'fact', ""'doomed"", 'man', 'past', 'home', 'new', 'old', 'lovers', 'family', 'friends', 'fallout', 'decision', 'film', 'close', 'reality', 'steps', 'forefront', 'theme', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'directed', 'story', 'depressing', 'actors', 'create', 'moments', 'tenderest', 'aspects', 'love', 'Thomas', 'Trabacchi', 'HIV+', 'Claudio', 'Ricardo', 'Salerno', 'beautifuly', 'naive', 'new', 'lover', 'Andrea', 'give', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performances', 'film', 'deals', 'AIDS', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'way', 'showing', 'interplay', 'doctor', 'patient', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'done', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mislead', 'cover', 'DVD', 'think', 'comedy', 'light', 'love', 'story']",N/A

Claudio has a lover he has been living with for some time.  They mutually decide not to live together anymore.  Claudio finds out he is HIV-Positive.  Still he continues to make friends.  While Andrea wants to be firends with him and see him again, he decides to tell Andrea he is going on a long trip.  He tells others that too and people close to him.  The one man he was with the night in the car, he really begins to like.  One night, he goes back to see Andrea.  A neighbor tells him he is not ta home, but this is where you can find him.  He does, and they have a sudden urge of passion, kissing and undressing madly.  In the bedroom, Claudio suddenly tells him &quot;He can't'&quot;.

This is a movie, and moviemakers have the freedom NOT to satisfy all my expectations, which I like. Although some of what happened was hard to take, the best parts of this movie far outweigh the darkness.Several months ago I read how hard it is to get straight Italian actors to play gay roles, but whoever wrote that must not have seen this movie. All the main actors, most of whom I assume are straight in real life, played these gay roles with such dedication and fire that it puts American gay movies and American actors (gay and straight) to shame.I have hardly ever seen on screen such intense and wholly believable passion as explodes between Caudio and Andrea in this movie. That passion alone explains to my satisfaction everything they did later, and I will rush to defend and recommend ANY movie that puts such passion between two men on film.

720967,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00006LPHD,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[5, 5]","Plot/storyline have been much discussed in earlier reviews here.  And, yes, this is a film about ""living with Aids,"" how it can in some ways ""robotize"" one's behavior, cut one off and harden one in his/her interactions with others.....and Trabacchi (as Claudio) is excellent in showing us every facet of such a ""throwaway"" man (for in the end he does just that).  However, I am more interested in another of the players.........the one who shoves in our faces the purity and certainty of simple love:  Salerno (as Andrea).  He gives such a pure performance that we come face to face with a love so strong that it overpowers any thought of self-danger.......so strong that it overpowers wisdom and any sense of self-preservation.Practically every other review and comment seems to focus on Trabacchi, yet never in memory have I encountered a male performer who can telegraph the emotion of love more intensely than Salerno; his eyes seem to be that proverbial door to the soul.  Repeating, never have I seen pure love transmitted more powerfully than through this man's eyes and facial expressions (would that many of us ever have been able to have had a love such as his).  What he is feeling is projected so strongly that your need is to reach through the screen, grab, and tightly hold him.I guess I will never be able to understand Italian directors, producers and viewers......for Salerno's film work after this production seems to be nonexistent.  How can that be?  Yet Trabacchi's follow-on films are numerous, but while his performance is excellent, he displays nowhere near the emotional power radiated by Salerno (should someone admit to a ""crush"" in here, somewhere?).So, if you want to see a film about a man none will consider smart, yet a man who would give you unflinching love that you would never doubt, then see ""Days.""
