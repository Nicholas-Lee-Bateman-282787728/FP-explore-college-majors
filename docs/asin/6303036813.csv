351734,AOW7M9ULF0JND,6303036813,Alec Martin,"[0, 0]","The general worldly consensus on Disney sequels - which are basically cheap, inexpensive, relatively lame movies that were whipped together by second rate minds in Disney, purely for making a few quick bucks - are this: they suck. To be blunt, it's not that terribly far off. It doesn't take quite a lot of intelligence or perceptiveness to understand just how unimpressive they can be, unless you are a little child and, to be fair, don't have quite an understanding of the fine line between good and down-right blowing. While it seems harsh, given that the targeted audience are the very children I just described, it's true; being an apt critic is realizing just how bad some things are.Aladdin is, in some ways, not a stranger to this. From a childish, fanboy, and a critical perspective, Aladdin worked because not only was it so damn funny, it was well done and well written. Granted, it is a cheap 90's knockoff of a 'get rich quick and look good at it' scenario, but the characters and the music were so interesting you kind of looked over that. So, after the massive success of that multi-million dollar film, it only makes sense to make a smaller, inexpensive, and professional sequel, riiiiight? Well... yes and no. An Aladdin TV series, in 1994, had been scheduled to premiere and already had a three-parter pilot set up for it. However, the Disney executives believed that the pilot they had planned could accurately run has a full 69-minute movie.Therefore, all three parts run consistently; and this is The Return of Jafar. Return of Jafar is not bad by any means, but by no means is it terrific either. The animation is sloppy - and by that I mean god damn sloppy - the story can get paper-thin at times, and it's too short for its own good. At 69 minutes, you'd expect a film plot such as Jafar's epic return (as a Genie, mind you) would at least be longer than slightly over an hour. Because of this, things move far too fast for its own good, despite clearly having potential to be ultimately better, and it shows. There's odd moments of interlacing, terrible animation shifts and changes, often times the facial textures are messed up considerably, and while the backgrounds can be very colorful, they often times just end up being a bit too boring for their own good.Return of Jafar pretty much re-hashes the idea Aladdin run on, but did add a few good and bad. Jafar was banished as a new Genie at the climatic, fifteen-minute end of the first movie. He wants revenge, but that comes with a cost. His former partner, the wisecracking, obnoxious Iago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) ends up betraying the narrow-faced, witty guy, squawking a litany of rebellion after throwing Jafar's lamp down a well. The film mostly revolves around these two ideas, with Jafar getting revenge, and Iago's redemptive journey.And when I say these two are the main characters, I mean they are the main characters. Everyone else is so underdeveloped they might as well be background characters. Iago is at least given a more sympathetic light here; he ends up betraying Jafar for his own interests at first, but then warms up to the idea of friendship with Aladdin. But then Jafar returns AGAIN, and Iago has to betray them again. Despite this, Iago's still pretty damn annoying, despite the fact that he's given a lot of weight here. Jafar, is, in some ways, improved upon in the second film. Jafar was known for his distinct features, his magic, and whatnot, and here they considerably grasped it. Almost all of Jafar's scenes contrast sharply with the overall attitude of Aladdin, and they do it very well; from his sharp lines, his evil plots, and facial expressions, there's rarely a bad moment with the rechristened guy.Everyone else, though, is pretty boring. Jafar's new sidekick, a greedy, Jason Alexander-voiced criminal named Abis Mal (god, terrible joke), is somewhat interesting due to the VERY Seinfeld-like humor (that's no coincidence), but he's just not strong enough. Aladdin mostly serves as the punching-bag; in the course of 69 minutes, he's thrown off a waterfall, nearly breaks up with Jasmine, has his life nearly taken from him twice, good gravy do they throw him through the ringer. Genie (now voiced by the sub-par Dan Castellanata, who just doesn't do a good job compared to Williams) performs one song, and then does nothing for the rest of the film. And I seriously hate whoever developed Jasmine; while her personality is still up to par, the animation has turned her face into a nightmare.Music-wise, however, The Return of Jafar is just as groovealicious and catchy as the first film (though slightly less so). Iago gets a solo number by the title of ""I'm Looking Out For Me""... ooooookay. The melody is catchy and the instrumentation is a funky 4/4, but whoever thought their idea of a showstopping musical number was Gilbert Gottfried singing was good... yeahhhh. Things do pick up from here, though. The Genie's song, ""Nothing In The World"", while not in the rapid pace of the first film's song for him, is amusing and has a funky rhythm. ""Forget About Love"" is more than likely the film's best known number; following a jazz rhythm, Iago leads... again in a few verses (cause we all know Gottfried is such a damn good singer), singing about how Jasmine is better off without Aladdin, but actually using reverse psychology (yeah, it sounds stupid, but it is vaguely amusing); it picks up once the aforementioned Princess and her boyfriend join in for a peculiar triplet. Lastly, we have Jafar's solo song, ""You're Only Second Rate""; despite the fact that it is just smack-talk, it's by far and away the film's best number; it's fast-paced, very catchy, contains good orchestration, and has decent lyrics. (Sans for two particularly annoying lines which are evident)The Return of Jafar isn't bad - it's story does have some good twists, in particular during the second half of the movie, good music, and the two villains (well, one villain-turned-hero) are very well portrayed. It's simply not as strong as Aladdin, especially in the animation department. Despite its evident energy, after the first few times, it doesn't hold up to par with the first movie's ideas. But, it's not bad, and I guess that's all that matters.

351735,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,6303036813,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 2]","The Disney DTV sequels have a reputation for being substandard.  That's not entirely fair; for example, Cinderella III is a very well done sequel that captures the spirit of the original movie, with high production values.  They're not all bad; perhaps the Disney DTV sequels are kind of like Star Trek movies (watch the even numbered ones, avoid the odd numbered ones).  But then there are movies like ""Return of Jafar.""The animation is shoddy in parts, with Saturday morning quality strewn throughout.  As my wife pointed out, Jasmine looks about 45 in a number of scenes.  Poor Dan Castellanata does his very best to be Genie, but you just can't replace a voice and comic sensibility as unique as Robin Williams.  I love Gilbert Gottfried, who is very funny in his own unique way.  However, he is the last person in the world who should be required to carry not just one, but two different songs within this movie.  Iago is a good character, but was there really a demand for a sequel to Aladdin that focused on his character arc and that required him to sing?All of that could have been overcome with a good story.  Instead, there is a continuity-free mess that doesn't even hang together internally, much less make any sense in conjunction with the original Aladdin.  Fortunately, it's short so at least it's over soon.The 5 and under set will not notice the problems with this movie and will enjoy it quite a bit.  That's the only reason I give it the second star: that age group will think it's a 5 star blockbuster.  The 6 and ups, and the parents, probably will not enjoy it nearly as well.  Avoid if possible.

First of all, this was _not_ four back-to-back Aladdin cartoon episodes. This movie was  divided up into four segments, and had commercials inserted into it before  being viewed on television, but it was not a TV cartoon first. Second of  all, yes, I agree that Robin Williams was the best Genie of all, but the  Disney budget was not about to stretch enough to hire him for a small,  direct-to-video sequel; not to mention all the TV cartoons that followed.  Dan did the best he could as Genie . . . and keep in mind that Robin  Williams is a tough act to follow. And look, I'll admit that the animation  was fairly poor in comparison to the original, the songs were not as  stunning, and all that other stuff, but the movie itself was interesting. I  _love_ characters that start out cynical and &quot;evil&quot; and who start  to learn about honor and friendship and love, and end up doing things they  never thought they'd do. These kinds of characters are great to write about  (I like writing short stories), and are fun to watch on movies, too. Iago  learns what it means to be loyal, going so far as to be willing to give up  his life for his friends.

As far as Disney's direct to video sequels are concerned this is one of the shortest ones. Also this movie has the distinction as well as being the first direct to video sequel. This time around Aladdin and Genie are reduces to being supporting actors while Iago is the lead actor or bird in this film. The movie starts with a group of thieves returning to their hideout after their latest plunder. Aladdin and Abu arrive to steal the treasures back and disperse it among the poor people of Agrabah. In the next scene we see Iago, along with Jafar's lamp, freeing himself from the Cave of Wonders. Iago drops Jafar's lamp down a well because he is unhappy with the way he was treated by him and flies off to Agrabah. Once in Agrabah, Iago heads to the palace and tries to trick Aladdin into accepting him in to his home. Aladdin is not fooled by this and chases Iago into the market and once in the market the two meet Abis Mal and his men. Abis Mal and his men chase Aladdin in the market and corner him. Iago accidently save Aladdin and Aladdin takes him back to the palace and puts Iago into a bird cage.Later on the Genie enters the movie after having traveled the world and reunites with Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. Genie arrives just in time as the Sultan is to announce that Aladdin is to become the new Grand Vizier. At dinner and after the Sultan has made the announcement, Iago enters the room being chased by Rajah, this makes the Sultan and Jasmine very upset. Later that evening Abis Mal and his men are by the same well where Iago dumped Jafar's lamp. Abis Mal unintentionally pulls up the lamp from the well and frees Jafar from the lamp. However, Jafar is bound by the rules of the lamp and must give Abis Mal his three wishes. Jafar tricks Abis Mal into wasting two of his wishes and the two strikes a bargain; if Abis Mal helps Jafar gets his revenge on the people who imprison him then he will give Abis Mal his third wish. From there the plot line is very simple. The two make it back to Agrabah and Jafar forces Iago to go along with his plans. Iago tricks Aladdin into taken the Sultan on a carpet ride to a place above a waterfall where the two can smooth things out. Jafar emerges in the palaces gardens and captures Genie, Abu, and Jasmine. At the waterfall Abis Mal and Jafar captures the Sultan and carpet.Aladdin makes it back to the palace only to be thrown in a cell to behead the next mooring for the murder on the Sultan. He is to die the next morning by the orders of the Princess; actually Jafar in disguise. Iago frees the Genie and Genie saves Aladdin from having his head chop off in the nick of time and Genie also save the others as well.Genie tells the group that the only way to bring down Jafar is to destroy his lamp. The gang set out to steal and then destroy the lamp. The gang is seen by Jafar and the battle begins for the lamp. During the battle Jafar opens the ground and it is filled with magma trapping Genie, Abu, Jasmine, and Aladdin. Iago flies and a grabs the lamp but Jafar injures Iago during the battle. Iago, with what strength he has left, kick the lamp into the magma and thus destroying Jafar. In the end Abis Mal does not get his third wish. As far a direct to video sequels goes, this is one of the better ones in my opinion. There is one major goof in the movie though; in the last scenes in the Aladdin movie, Genie is given his freedom and the golden shackles are removed. In the Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves the golden shackles return.

(In other words to make more money.)The only song I thought was good was  Jafar's, &quot;You're only second rate,&quot; that was sung to Genie. The  other songs were boring and drab.The animation was quick, sketchy, jerky  and downright bad. The story itself, which was somewhat feasible  sequel-wise, had been poorly thought out and the whole thing reminded me of  the cheap Saturday morning cartoons done in the 70's.Robin Williams  couldn't (or perhaps wouldn't) return to do Genie's voice in this one, but  the man who does Genie's voice instead started off okay, but then loses how  to do the voice halfway through which is quite noticable.The whole movie  was pretty corny, espically at the end, and I don't know of anyone who  likes it.

351760,ALRBLOW3ETCY1,6303036813,"""thebookreader""","[3, 6]","ALADDIN is one of Disney's truly outstanding achievements.  This one stands out for and marks an achievement, too.  The achievement?  THE RETURN OF JAFAR is a total washout, laking everything I once knew ALADDIN movies  to have.One of the best things about this movie is that you get to be  reunited with characters who've already won your hearts in ALADDIN.  It is  a joy to see them again if you have watched the first movie over and over  and over and over and over and over.But I was very disappointed in their  new adventures.  We find Jafar, now an all-powerful geenie, plotting a  revenge on Aladdin and friends. And might I point out that this plot is age  old, and that it has been used countless times without twists.  Other plots  are used over and over but they have twists to make new versons appealing.  The only twist here is that Iago is attempting to switch sides in the  &quot;battle&quot; between Aladdin and Jafar.  Also, as another reviewer  pointed out, the characters have changed quite a bit, and it was not  amusing to find them different than when they debuted.  Also, the music is  junk compared to &quot;A Whole New World&quot;, &quot;Prince Ali&quot;, and  &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; from the first film.  Also, the lack of Robin  Williams (who voiced Geenie in the first film and would later return to  voice him in the third) made a big difference and it showed.  This new  Geenie didn't even come CLOSE to amusing me. Also, this movie had a scary  theme to it whenever Jafar showed up.  Scarier than in the first, even. And  Jafar's idiot master, Abis Mahl, isn't even funny and is a very poor  villian.  The ending was also a great disappointment compared with the  fireworks and music and group hug at the end of ALADDIN.To sum it up, if  you want to see these characters at their best, see ALADDIN, not this  trash.  I am a Disney lover, but this is absolute trash.  The only reason  I'm proud I have it is because it's part of the ALADDIN trilogy.  I am  highly disappointed in Disney's performance.  When I saw the trailer on THE  FOX AND THE HOUND and such, I thought Disney would make a better sequel.  I  guess I cannot make guesses about Disney anymore. I said in my review of  ALADDIN that Walt would be proud of it, and he would be, but he would NOT  be proud of this trash.",1,Disappointing and unorginial sequel lacks the first's charm!,961718400,"06 23, 2000",2000,2317,"['ALADDIN', 'one', 'Disney', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'achievements', 'one', 'out', 'marks', 'achievement', 'too', 'achievement', 'RETURN', 'OF', 'JAFAR', 'total', 'washout', 'laking', 'everything', 'once', 'knew', 'ALADDIN', 'movies', 'have.One', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'get', 'be', 'reunited', 'characters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'already', 'won', 'hearts', 'ALADDIN', 'joy', 'see', 'again', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'over.But', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'new', 'adventures', 'find', 'Jafar', 'now', 'all-powerful', 'geenie', 'plotting', 'revenge', 'Aladdin', 'friends', 'might', 'point', 'out', 'plot', 'age', 'old', 'been', 'used', 'countless', 'times', 'twists', 'Other', 'plots', 'are', 'used', 'have', 'twists', 'make', 'new', 'versons', 'appealing', 'only', 'twist', 'here', 'Iago', 'attempting', 'switch', 'sides', 'quot', 'battle', 'quot', 'Aladdin', 'Jafar', 'Also', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'not', 'amusing', 'find', 'different', 'when', 'debuted', 'Also', 'music', 'junk', 'compared', 'quot', 'A', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'quot', 'quot', 'Prince', 'Ali', 'quot', 'quot', 'Friend', 'Me', 'quot', 'first', 'film', 'Also', 'lack', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'voiced', 'Geenie', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'later', 'return', 'voice', 'third', 'made', 'big', 'difference', 'showed', 'new', 'Geenie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'CLOSE', 'amusing', 'Also', 'movie', 'had', 'scary', 'theme', 'whenever', 'Jafar', 'showed', 'up', 'Scarier', 'first', 'even', 'Jafar', 'idiot', 'master', 'Abis', 'Mahl', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'very', 'poor', 'villian', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'disappointment', 'compared', 'fireworks', 'music', 'group', 'hug', 'end', 'ALADDIN.To', 'sum', 'up', 'want', 'see', 'characters', 'best', 'see', 'ALADDIN', 'not', 'trash', 'am', 'Disney', 'lover', 'absolute', 'trash', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'proud', 'have', 'part', 'ALADDIN', 'trilogy', 'am', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'Disney', 'performance', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'THE', 'FOX', 'AND', 'THE', 'HOUND', 'such', 'thought', 'Disney', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'sequel', 'guess', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'guesses', 'Disney', 'anymore', 'said', 'review', 'ALADDIN', 'Walt', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'proud', 'trash']",The Return of Jafar VHS

351763,A29IEILBT3WDGU,6303036813,ultron77,"[0, 0]","You remember the Disney muscial classic Aladdin. Remember how Jafar was defeated by being sealed in his own  magic lamp by Aladdin and thrown into the desert by Genie. Well, as they say in every good film, you can't keep a spectacular villain down. As the title states, Jafar returns to Agrabah to exact his revenge on Aladdin and the others, and resume his plans for complete domination over the land.Over the years I have heard many people complain about this film usually stating that it is inferior to the orginal movie/prequel. I say different. Although they could have done much better with the animation, the rest of the film (characters, storyline and the music) is just as potent as ever. Genie is hilarious (despite Robin Williams not making his own return for the role), the relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine remains strong and dramatic, and (what I found to be the most entertaining) Iago abandons Jafar early on in the film and does his best to be a hero.As for the songs (every Disney film has to have some, right? It wouldn't be Disney otherwise), we have 'Nothing In The World' as Genie comes hom after travelling the planet but feeling a little lonely, 'I'm Lookin' Out For Me' as Iago leaves Jafar to go off on his own, 'We Can't Forget About Love' as Genie and Iago campaign to bring Aladdin and Jasmine back together after a misunderstanding, and the best of the lot, 'You're Only Second Rate', which is Jafar's villain song (FINALLY; they missed that in the first film).So, can Aladdin and co. defeat Jafar a second time, or is that sorcerer turned most-powerful-Genie-of-all going to get the best of them once and for all. The heroes are going to have put out all the stops on this one, let me tell you. Especially Iago. Well, what are you waiting for? Here is your chance. Take it and witness...
