1634531,A1CVPHNN7XI8ZA,B00BGGIV3K,Mr. Michael R. Evans,"[10, 10]","Unlike many of the Fox Cinema Archives releases of wide screen movies, this is a terrific anamorphic transfer in full CinemaScope of this glossy Fox comedy from 1957. The sets are great but also a little familiar- Fox probably used them for their other movies set in the business world made at the time (egs. THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT, WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? etc). The Broadway version ran from Dec 1953 to November 1954 and starred Franchot Tone, Gig Young and Anne Jackson.The CinemaScoped film adaptation is admittedly somewhat stagey, but has a terrific cast and contains the last screen performance of character actor Franklin Pangborn (a favorite of Preston Sturges who was hilarious in many great Paramount comedies of the '30's and '40's). It is also the debut film of Tony Randall, who co-stars with David Niven, Ginger Rogers and Fox stalwarts Dan Dailey, Barbara Rush and Natalie Schafer (well before she became identified as Mrs Thurston-Howell III). They all bring the most out of this dated but witty comedy, which lampoons the addiction to psycho-analysis which was so trendy amongst those who could afford it in the '50's.(In the '40's it was treated with great respect and reverance egs. SPELLBOUND, NOW VOYAGER). The colors are vivid, the image is sharp. The only ""minus"" is that the dvd soundtrack is mono while the original prints were in (very) directional 4-track magnetic stereophonic sound, which came 'hand in hand' with CinemaScope in the '50's. (Discerning baby boomers will recognize certain parts of the musical score which were later 'tracked' for Fox's TV series LOST IN SPACE, when it became more comedic in its second and third seasons.)",4,CinemaScope transfer of this Broadway to Hollywood satire of analysis,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1686,"['many', 'Fox', 'Cinema', 'Archives', 'releases', 'wide', 'screen', 'movies', 'terrific', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'full', 'CinemaScope', 'glossy', 'Fox', 'comedy', '1957', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'little', 'familiar-', 'Fox', 'probably', 'used', 'other', 'movies', 'set', 'business', 'world', 'made', 'time', 'egs', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'GRAY', 'FLANNEL', 'SUIT', 'WILL', 'SUCCESS', 'SPOIL', 'ROCK', 'HUNTER', 'etc', 'Broadway', 'version', 'ran', 'Dec', '1953', 'November', '1954', 'starred', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Gig', 'Young', 'Anne', 'Jackson.The', 'CinemaScoped', 'film', 'adaptation', 'admittedly', 'somewhat', 'stagey', 'terrific', 'cast', 'last', 'screen', 'performance', 'character', 'actor', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'favorite', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'who', 'was', 'hilarious', 'many', 'great', 'Paramount', 'comedies', ""'30"", ""'40"", 'also', 'debut', 'film', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'who', 'David', 'Niven', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Fox', 'stalwarts', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'Natalie', 'Schafer', 'well', 'became', 'identified', 'Mrs', 'Thurston-Howell', 'III', 'bring', 'most', 'dated', 'witty', 'comedy', 'addiction', 'psycho-analysis', 'was', 'so', 'trendy', 'amongst', 'who', 'could', 'afford', ""'50"", ""'40"", 'was', 'treated', 'great', 'respect', 'reverance', 'egs', 'SPELLBOUND', 'NOW', 'VOYAGER', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'image', 'sharp', 'only', 'minus', 'dvd', 'soundtrack', 'mono', 'original', 'prints', 'were', 'very', 'directional', '4-track', 'magnetic', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'came', ""'hand"", 'hand', 'CinemaScope', ""'50"", 'Discerning', 'baby', 'boomers', 'will', 'recognize', 'certain', 'parts', 'musical', 'score', 'were', 'later', ""'tracked"", 'Fox', 'TV', 'series', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'when', 'became', 'more', 'comedic', 'second', 'third', 'seasons']","Oh, Men!

1634532,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B00BGGIV3K,The CinemaScope Cat,"[6, 6]","A psychiatrist (David Niven) about to get married in a few days finds his world turned upside down when two different patients make a startling revelation: a neurotic patient (Tony Randall) confesses he is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend and a married woman (Ginger Rogers) mentions a fling her husband (Dan Dailey) had with an actress ..... both women are one and the same, the psychiatrist's fiancee (Barbara Rush). Based on the comedy by Edward Chodorov which ran for a year on Broadway, this is one of those stage to screen adaptations that are transposed to the screen pretty much intact but what, I assume, was sparkling on Broadway fizzles on the screen. I doubt it's the film's fault, I suspect the play would fizzle with contemporary audiences too. It's never been revived and considering its attitude toward the two female characters who are needy and demanding, I doubt it ever will be. All the actors give their best shot and Dailey has a very nice speech about Ibsen's A DOLL'S HOUSE but it still remains a filmed play in the literal sense. The wide CinemaScope screen allows the camera to sit still while the actors do their crosses all within our view as if we were watching a play. Directed by Nunnally Johnson. With Natalie Schafer and Franklin Pangborn.The Fox MOD DVD is a sharp and vibrant transfer in an anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer.",3,For fans of its cast only,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1364,"['psychiatrist', 'David', 'Niven', 'get', 'married', 'few', 'days', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'two', 'different', 'patients', 'make', 'startling', 'revelation', 'neurotic', 'patient', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'obsessed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'married', 'woman', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'fling', 'husband', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'had', 'actress', 'women', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'psychiatrist', 'fiancee', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'Based', 'comedy', 'Edward', 'Chodorov', 'ran', 'year', 'Broadway', 'one', 'stage', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'are', 'transposed', 'screen', 'pretty', 'much', 'intact', 'what', 'assume', 'was', 'sparkling', 'Broadway', 'fizzles', 'screen', 'doubt', 'film', 'fault', 'suspect', 'play', 'would', 'fizzle', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'too', 'never', 'been', 'revived', 'considering', 'attitude', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'needy', 'demanding', 'doubt', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'shot', 'Dailey', 'very', 'nice', 'speech', 'Ibsen', 'A', 'DOLL', 'HOUSE', 'still', 'filmed', 'play', 'literal', 'sense', 'wide', 'CinemaScope', 'screen', 'camera', 'sit', 'still', 'actors', 'do', 'crosses', 'view', 'were', 'watching', 'play', 'Directed', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'Natalie', 'Schafer', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn.The', 'Fox', 'MOD', 'DVD', 'sharp', 'vibrant', 'transfer', 'anamorphic', 'wide', 'screen', '2.35', 'transfer']","Oh, Men!

I was expecting something a much enjoyable and funny. The story of this film doesn't arouses my sympathy or admiration. I agree with another reviewer that is for fans of its cast only : Dan Dailey, Ginger Rogers, David Niven, Barbara Rush and Tony Randall. But I'm really enjoyed Ginger Rogers' play.
