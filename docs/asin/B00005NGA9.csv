This DVD would be a nice addition to anyone's ballet collection.  I particularly enjoyed Les Sylphides with Chopin's glorious music and the superb dancing.,5,An Enchanted Evening,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,298,"['beautiful', 'production', 'several', 'ballets', 'do', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'give', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'anyone', 'ballet', 'collection', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Les', 'Sylphides', 'Chopin', 'glorious', 'music', 'superb', 'dancing']","An Evening with the Royal Ballet / Nureyev, Fonteyn"

I was privileged to personally see a Fonteyn & Nureyev performance with the Royal Ballet, one of their last, of ""Marguerite & Armand"" at the Met in NY, and she was an aspiring young dancer's dream - beautiful, graceful, classic with perfect form, and what EMOTION; she was the only ballerina I ever saw who put her whole heart and soul into the character, and owned it.  It is wonderful that some of this talent is preserved in films like ""Evening with the Royal Ballet"" and also Czinner's ""Royal Ballet,"" both of which feature Fonteyn in select acts of famous ballets.  I have also recently purchased the Fonteyn biography by Meredith Daneman which was interesting but mostly speculation; if you really want to learn about Fonteyn, her art always came first, and it is much better to snap up as many performance DVDs or tapes as you can find like this one, to have a true understanding of this amazing prima ballerina assoluta and why she was so beloved.",5,The legendary Margot Fonteyn,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,1189,"['was', 'ballet', 'student', 'huge', 'ballet', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', '60s-70s', 'had', 'indulgent', 'parents', 'who', 'would', 'stretch', 'budget', 'allow', 'occasional', 'journey', 'Long', 'Island', 'Manhattan', 'see', 'visiting', 'NY', 'ballet', 'companies', 'was', 'privileged', 'personally', 'see', 'Fonteyn', 'Nureyev', 'performance', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'one', 'last', 'Marguerite', 'Armand', 'Met', 'NY', 'was', 'aspiring', 'young', 'dancer', 'dream', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'classic', 'perfect', 'form', 'what', 'EMOTION', 'was', 'only', 'ballerina', 'ever', 'saw', 'who', 'put', 'whole', 'heart', 'soul', 'character', 'owned', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'preserved', 'films', 'Evening', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'also', 'Czinner', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'feature', 'Fonteyn', 'select', 'acts', 'famous', 'ballets', 'have', 'also', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Fonteyn', 'biography', 'Meredith', 'Daneman', 'was', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'speculation', 'really', 'want', 'learn', 'Fonteyn', 'art', 'always', 'came', 'first', 'much', 'better', 'snap', 'up', 'as', 'many', 'performance', 'DVDs', 'tapes', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'have', 'true', 'understanding', 'amazing', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'assoluta', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'beloved']","An Evening with the Royal Ballet / Nureyev, Fonteyn"
