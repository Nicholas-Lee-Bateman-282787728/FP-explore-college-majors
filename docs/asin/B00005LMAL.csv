663654,AM2ITPX4ZEUIA,B00005LMAL,"Amazon Customer ""Wildrider""","[7, 10]","Dwight Yoakam's &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot; is not a standard western.  Honestly, it's only a western at all due to the time and place in which it's set, or at least, the time and place in which it appears to be set.Anyone who goes into this movie with pre-conceived notions has to stop and throw them out right now.  You also have to be prepared to really, really think.  Dwight Yoakam may be best-known for being a hillbilly singer, but there's a rather shockingly deep brain hiding beneath that low-brimmed cowboy hat, and lurking inside that brain is a strange, esoteric, and truly bizarre story about death and what may, or may not, happen afterward.As the story opens, we find Valentine Casey, the sheriff of the small western town of Los Tragos.  The town is terrorized by a bloodthirsty mob of thieves who turn out to be Val's adopted family, the murderous Henrys.  Sound like a standard western?  Perhaps.  But then we jump ahead a few years to find that the government is searching anxiously for Val, or Val's family, to deliver something important.  Val is still seeking the Henrys, but appears to now be working as a horse trainer with his bizarre little deputy, U.S. Christmas, while he searches.  Eventually, he will find the Henrys, and his search for justice will end.That Val is haunted by the ghosts of his past is evident; what else haunts him, the landscape, and all the people who surround him, is not so immediately apparent.  That Val himself may be a ghost is, perhaps, the most important facet of the story.  Is Val a ghost who cannot stop going until he has completed his task?  Or are they all ghosts, searching in vain for a way to finish their lives, accomplish a necessary goal, or are they merely trapped, forced to inhabit this bleak landscape for all eternity without finding redemption at all?  If redemption does indeed exist for Val, perhaps he can find it by defeating the Henrys; or does his redemption exist in the beautiful Adelyne, who herself is struggling to accomplish HER post-life goal?For me, one of the most intriguing pieces of this film was trying to make the decision whether Valentine Casey died in the Spanish-American war, as a hero in Cuba, or did he die in the disastrous, bloody massacre in Los Tragos?  Has he convinced himself that the heroic death was his, to salve his pain over his failure in Los Tragos?  Val is haunted by scents -- the smell of gunpowder, notably, but he also always tries to smell burning chili peppers -- as, we are told, the sense of smell leaves you in death, and all you retain are the scents that surrounded you when you died.  So does Val really smell the burning chilis, meaning he died a hero in Cuba?  Or is he simply trying to add that scent to the gunpowder that marked his death and subsequent failure in Los Tragos?It's a very intriguing film.  It is also beautifully shot, marking some very, very fine cinematography.  I was pleasantly surprised by Dwight Yoakam as a director.  The mood is set early, and scenes flow remarkably well together.  It is a very long movie, which unfortunately audiences were not ready for, so it is an absolute MUST to see the DVD edition to understand the film -- the VHS edition is cut down by almost 40 minutes of necessary footage.  It's also a very dark film, and darkly humorous.  The bits of black comedy are all the more startling for the way they scattershot through the story--surprise, there's a laugh hidden there!  It's also vitally important to actually watch this film.  I'm very sorry that it never played theatres in this area so I never got the opportunity to see it on the big screen.One of my favorite scenes contains Billy Bob Thornton as Brigadeer Smalls -- a very small, but extremely pivotal role, whose words must be listened to -- Smalls is the key, all Val has to do is listen to unlock his own mystery.  And no one but a great character player like Billy Bob could deliver those lines.By all means, if you're looking for a little light action, don't choose this film.  But if you like a movie that makes you think, and question, and ponder, then you may like this as much as I did.",5,Not Your Standard Western Fare,999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,4149,"['Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'quot', 'South', 'Heaven', 'West', 'Hell', 'quot', 'not', 'standard', 'western', 'Honestly', 'only', 'western', 'due', 'time', 'place', 'set', 'least', 'time', 'place', 'be', 'set.Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'stop', 'throw', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'also', 'have', 'be', 'prepared', 'really', 'really', 'think', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'may', 'be', 'best-known', 'being', 'hillbilly', 'singer', 'rather', 'shockingly', 'deep', 'brain', 'hiding', 'beneath', 'low-brimmed', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'lurking', 'brain', 'strange', 'esoteric', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'story', 'death', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'happen', 'story', 'find', 'Valentine', 'Casey', 'sheriff', 'small', 'western', 'town', 'Los', 'Tragos', 'town', 'terrorized', 'bloodthirsty', 'mob', 'thieves', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Val', 'adopted', 'family', 'murderous', 'Henrys', 'Sound', 'standard', 'western', 'Perhaps', 'then', 'jump', 'ahead', 'few', 'years', 'find', 'government', 'searching', 'anxiously', 'Val', 'Val', 'family', 'deliver', 'something', 'important', 'Val', 'still', 'seeking', 'Henrys', 'now', 'be', 'working', 'horse', 'trainer', 'bizarre', 'little', 'deputy', 'U.S.', 'Christmas', 'Eventually', 'will', 'find', 'Henrys', 'search', 'justice', 'will', 'end.That', 'Val', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'past', 'evident', 'what', 'else', 'landscape', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'not', 'so', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'Val', 'may', 'be', 'ghost', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'facet', 'story', 'Val', 'ghost', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'going', 'completed', 'task', 'are', 'ghosts', 'searching', 'vain', 'way', 'finish', 'lives', 'accomplish', 'necessary', 'goal', 'are', 'merely', 'trapped', 'forced', 'inhabit', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'eternity', 'finding', 'redemption', 'redemption', 'indeed', 'exist', 'Val', 'perhaps', 'can', 'find', 'defeating', 'Henrys', 'redemption', 'exist', 'beautiful', 'Adelyne', 'who', 'struggling', 'accomplish', 'HER', 'post-life', 'goal', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'pieces', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'decision', 'Valentine', 'Casey', 'died', 'Spanish-American', 'war', 'hero', 'Cuba', 'did', 'die', 'disastrous', 'bloody', 'massacre', 'Los', 'Tragos', 'Has', 'convinced', 'heroic', 'death', 'was', 'salve', 'pain', 'failure', 'Los', 'Tragos', 'Val', 'haunted', 'scents', 'smell', 'gunpowder', 'notably', 'also', 'always', 'smell', 'burning', 'chili', 'peppers', 'are', 'told', 'sense', 'smell', 'leaves', 'death', 'retain', 'are', 'scents', 'surrounded', 'when', 'died', 'So', 'Val', 'really', 'smell', 'burning', 'chilis', 'meaning', 'died', 'hero', 'Cuba', 'simply', 'trying', 'add', 'scent', 'gunpowder', 'marked', 'death', 'subsequent', 'failure', 'Los', 'Tragos', 'very', 'intriguing', 'film', 'also', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'marking', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'director', 'mood', 'set', 'early', 'scenes', 'flow', 'remarkably', 'well', 'together', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'audiences', 'were', 'not', 'ready', 'absolute', 'MUST', 'see', 'DVD', 'edition', 'understand', 'film', 'VHS', 'edition', 'cut', 'down', 'almost', '40', 'minutes', 'necessary', 'footage', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'bits', 'black', 'comedy', 'are', 'more', 'startling', 'way', 'scattershot', 'story', 'surprise', 'laugh', 'hidden', 'there', 'also', 'vitally', 'important', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', ""'m"", 'very', 'sorry', 'never', 'played', 'theatres', 'area', 'so', 'never', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'big', 'screen.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'contains', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Brigadeer', 'Smalls', 'very', 'small', 'extremely', 'pivotal', 'role', 'words', 'must', 'be', 'listened', 'Smalls', 'key', 'Val', 'do', 'listen', 'unlock', 'own', 'mystery', 'one', 'great', 'character', 'player', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'could', 'deliver', 'means', ""'re"", 'looking', 'little', 'light', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'film', 'like', 'movie', 'think', 'question', 'ponder', 'then', 'may', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A
663655,A39TQ9JE76GW88,B00005LMAL,"Bill Allison ""Bill Allison""","[9, 15]","I waited a long time for this movie. Just knowing that Dwight would be doing the writing and directing gave me a good idea of what to expect. With a cast like Billy Bob Thornton, Vince Vaughn, Paul Reubens, and Joe Unger, I knew one thing for sure. This was not going to be the traditional western. Now there have been many bad reviews posted here saying that this film is a plotless mess and nothing more than an excess extravaganza. Well, I beg to differ. Let me back myself up here. It seems to me that Dwight has a good handle on writing and I already knew the guy could act. (anyone ever see a little ole movie called &quot;Sling Blade&quot;?) His directing skills were what I was most interested in seeing. The guy is a master and the sort of mad genius that people are quick to judge and not fully explore. &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot; is not what you see at first glance. The movie is full of hidden things and subtle innuendo. It moves along like there is no plot (there is one, but it doesn't really matter. That's not what this movie is about). It moves at an awkward, seemingly unrehearsed pace, because that's how life moves. There are no rehearsels and the hero of the film is not really a hero but he does show heroism. Yes, even he has flaws, and if anyone wants to argue, just show me one hero in real life who didn't have his own faults and personal demons. The dialogue is carefully written so that it doesn't fall into the trap of where it sounds like &quot;written dialogue&quot;. It sounds more like you and I having an actual conversation.South of Heaven is jammed full of oddball characters and the huge cast helps tremendously. Billy Bob Thornton plays a traveller by the name of Brigidier Smalls who has returned from the dead to help Adelyne (Bridget Fonda) get back to her hometown. His mannerisms an calm, quiet nature really creeped me out. He was very, very good in this movie. He says very little but what he says to Dwight Yoakam gives the movie a whole new supernatural dimension. I've watched &quot;South of Heaven&quot; four times now and I'm still not sure of what everything means. All I can say, is that if you watch this movie expecting a standard western, you are going to be very dissapointed my friend. Go watch Tombstone (not to slam that classic in any way). But if you want something intriguing,(pardon my bad spelling) and something that will challenge your intellect and make you look beneath the surface, you've found it. There is so much going on here, I wouldn't be suprised if they made a sequal. So rent it for a few days (although, you'll probably need to buy it) and dig in. The DVD is pretty cool. There is a very crisp look, the sound is dead on, and the features are nifty.",5,"Hang on a minute, here.

663660,A1XDMYX8QOW07N,B00005LMAL,Geoffrey Kleinman,"[20, 30]","South of Heaven, West of Hell really didn't get much theatrical exposure, which is surprising considering its stellar cast, including Dwight Yoakam, Billy Bob Thornton , Bridget &amp; Peter Fonda, Vince Vaughn, Paul Reubens and Bud Cort. In addition, South of Heaven, West of Hell is in the strange position of having different cuts of the film being released on VHS and DVD. The VHS of South of Heaven, West of Hell is 30 minutes shorter than the theatrical and DVD version of the film. I have no idea why Trimark would decide to touch South of Heaven, West of Hell, one of the most intriguing and 'real' westerns I've seen in a long time.Running at about two and a half hours, South of Heaven, West of Hell takes its time telling its story, but surprisingly doesn't really feel slow. Director/Star Dwight Yoakam does a great job of capturing the feeling of life in the West at the turn of the century. There's a scene at dusk where there's nothing really going on, a group of people sit around outside and listen to people play music. It's such a stark contrast to modern life where people close themselves in their homes and flick on the TV. It's little moments like this that create a real and credible world in which the story takes place.Aside from being one of the more methodical and realistic westerns I've seen, South of Heaven, West of Hell is also by far the darkest, where there really aren't any heros, and the lines between honor and revenge are quite blurry. South of Heaven, West of Hell is a gem of a movie with stellar performances. While I felt Dwight Yoakam did a great job as the lead, I really enjoyed the supporting performances, especially Bud Cort (best know for being Harold in Harold and Maude), Paul Reubens, who is a thrill to watch playing a cowboy, and Billy Bob Thornton in a brief but pivitol role.After watching South of Heaven, West of Hell I still had a number of questions about the film, but unfortunately the commentary doesn't clear everything up, which at first was a little frustrating, but after a bit of thinking was ok. It's hard to remember a recent film that I thought about as much afterward. South of Heaven, West of Hell isn't a movie for everyone but for those interested in a dark, real western I'd highly recommend it.

663662,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005LMAL,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[23, 28]","Dwight Yoakam, accomplished country/western singer, loves movies. He has appeared, as an actor, in over a dozen films. On this film, Yoakam functioned as writer, co-producer [with Buck Owens], director, star, and of course, he worked on the musical score as well. This would be quite a feat for the most accomplished of movie stars, which Mr. Yoakam is not. He can be very effective as an actor, when directed properly, as in ""Sling Blade"" and ""Panic Room"". He is a better actor than Johnny Cash was, or Merle Haggard; certainly as good as the icon known as Willie Nelson.This film is so bad, it is almost good. It is so different, so off-center, so oblique, that it challenges the audience. The cinematography, by James Glennon, is lush; images bathed in dust and golden light, drenced in blood-red sunsets and shimmering mirage riders, ghost-like apparitions. I think it is admirable that Yoakam had enought influence, enough money, enough good friends, and enough ego to launch this dark confused tale. But, alas, it does not emerge as eclectic as Jim Jarmusch's mini-classic,""Dead Man"". We all love a western, and Yoakam can be applauded for purposefully breaking down many of the cliches of the genre. Next time though, sir, please procure blanks for your handguns that do not sound like cap pistols.The movie has been called self-indulgent, and it is; tedious, even egregious. Actually, what it is remains closer to a labor of love falling leagues short of coherence. It was poorly written. Without strongly defined characters, clear conflicts, and fully-realized conclusions, we struggle as viewers. At times, the film becomes too esoteric; like Dennis Hopper's ""The Last Movie"", one suspects the cast had fun doing it, but where's the fun in watching it ? No one wants a film to fail. We search for those tiny nanoseconds that elevate, entertain, and enlighten us.The movie is populated by bizarre characters portrayed by a bevy of terrific actors. Yoakam, as U.S.Marshall, Val Casey, is at ease in front of the camera; but Val comes off as shallow posturing. Where is the anger, inner strength, and passion ?Several times in the semblence of a plot it is mentioned that an official government letter exists, and in it is the information that Valentine Casey was deceased; that he had died in Cuba in the Spanish-American war. When confronted with this conundrum, Val just stares wistfully toward the horizon. So, as an undercurrent, we wonder if Val is really an avenging spirit, or if the whole movie represents a nightmarish dream ?Joe Unger, as the outlaw Nogales, makes a strong impression, finding a real person within the absurdity of the script. Billy Bob Thornton, Peter Fonda, Matt Clark, and Bo Hopkins, sleepwalk through their brief scenes, lending their visage and names to the project. Bridget Fonda, as Adelyne, is credible, considering her character is written incoherently. The Henry Clan are the heavies. They are led by Luke Askew, astride a primitive wheel chair, spouted biblical platitudes, manning a machine gun mounted on his wagon, and finding time to bugger his daughter. Vince Vaughn cuts a wide swath as Taylor Henry, the most lethel of the bunch; killing without remorse, ice-blooded and stone-faced. Comic relief is provided with the bawdy flavor of Shakespeare; down, dirty, and bloody. Bud Cort is dipped in [foul stuff], stripped, humiliated, beaten, and shot. Paul Reubens, as Arvid Henry, seethes like a [unique] gunslinger, bouncing about like a Marx brother; murdering, [abusing], stealing,... Michael Jeter, as the uncle, gets to whine, beg, howl, cajole, and [be abused],... Terry McIlvain, as Val's sidekick, U.S.Christmas, is costumed in a colorful skirt, like a South American gaucho, and he makes the most out of his screen time....this one could become a cult classic.",3,"South of Coherence, West of Logic",1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,3820,"['Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'accomplished', 'country/western', 'singer', 'movies', 'appeared', 'actor', 'dozen', 'films', 'film', 'Yoakam', 'functioned', 'writer', 'co-producer', '[', 'Buck', 'Owens', ']', 'director', 'star', 'course', 'worked', 'musical', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'feat', 'most', 'accomplished', 'movie', 'stars', 'Mr.', 'Yoakam', 'not', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'actor', 'when', 'directed', 'properly', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Panic', 'Room', 'better', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'icon', 'known', 'Willie', 'Nelson.This', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'good', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'off-center', 'so', 'oblique', 'audience', 'cinematography', 'James', 'Glennon', 'lush', 'images', 'bathed', 'dust', 'golden', 'light', 'drenced', 'blood-red', 'sunsets', 'shimmering', 'mirage', 'riders', 'ghost-like', 'apparitions', 'think', 'admirable', 'Yoakam', 'had', 'enought', 'influence', 'enough', 'money', 'enough', 'good', 'friends', 'enough', 'ego', 'launch', 'dark', 'confused', 'tale', 'alas', 'not', 'emerge', 'as', 'eclectic', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'mini-classic', 'Dead', 'Man', 'love', 'western', 'Yoakam', 'can', 'be', 'applauded', 'purposefully', 'breaking', 'down', 'many', 'cliches', 'genre', 'Next', 'time', 'sir', 'please', 'procure', 'blanks', 'handguns', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'cap', 'pistols.The', 'movie', 'been', 'called', 'self-indulgent', 'tedious', 'even', 'egregious', 'Actually', 'what', 'closer', 'labor', 'love', 'falling', 'leagues', 'short', 'coherence', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'strongly', 'defined', 'characters', 'clear', 'conflicts', 'fully-realized', 'conclusions', 'struggle', 'viewers', 'times', 'film', 'too', 'esoteric', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Last', 'Movie', 'one', 'cast', 'had', 'fun', 'doing', 'where', 'fun', 'watching', 'one', 'film', 'fail', 'search', 'tiny', 'nanoseconds', 'elevate', 'entertain', 'enlighten', 'us.The', 'movie', 'populated', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'bevy', 'terrific', 'actors', 'Yoakam', 'U.S.Marshall', 'Val', 'Casey', 'ease', 'front', 'camera', 'Val', 'off', 'shallow', 'posturing', 'Where', 'anger', 'inner', 'strength', 'passion', 'Several', 'times', 'semblence', 'plot', 'mentioned', 'official', 'government', 'letter', 'information', 'Valentine', 'Casey', 'was', 'deceased', 'had', 'died', 'Cuba', 'Spanish-American', 'war', 'When', 'confronted', 'conundrum', 'Val', 'just', 'wistfully', 'horizon', 'So', 'undercurrent', 'wonder', 'Val', 'really', 'avenging', 'spirit', 'whole', 'movie', 'nightmarish', 'dream', 'Joe', 'Unger', 'outlaw', 'Nogales', 'strong', 'impression', 'finding', 'real', 'person', 'absurdity', 'script', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Matt', 'Clark', 'Bo', 'Hopkins', 'sleepwalk', 'brief', 'scenes', 'lending', 'visage', 'names', 'project', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Adelyne', 'credible', 'considering', 'character', 'written', 'incoherently', 'Henry', 'Clan', 'are', 'heavies', 'are', 'led', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'primitive', 'wheel', 'chair', 'spouted', 'biblical', 'platitudes', 'manning', 'machine', 'gun', 'mounted', 'wagon', 'finding', 'time', 'bugger', 'daughter', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'wide', 'swath', 'Taylor', 'Henry', 'most', 'lethel', 'bunch', 'killing', 'remorse', 'ice-blooded', 'stone-faced', 'Comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'bawdy', 'flavor', 'Shakespeare', 'down', 'dirty', 'bloody', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'dipped', '[', 'foul', 'stuff', ']', 'stripped', 'humiliated', 'beaten', 'shot', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'Arvid', 'Henry', '[', 'unique', ']', 'gunslinger', 'bouncing', 'Marx', 'brother', 'murdering', '[', 'abusing', ']', 'stealing', 'Michael', 'Jeter', 'uncle', 'whine', 'beg', 'howl', 'cajole', '[', 'be', 'abused', ']', 'Terry', 'McIlvain', 'Val', 'sidekick', 'U.S.Christmas', 'costumed', 'colorful', 'skirt', 'South', 'American', 'gaucho', 'most', 'screen', 'time', '.this', 'one', 'could', 'become', 'cult', 'classic']",N/A

I say DVD because I have viewed both the Video and the DVD.  So much was cut from the Video it is difficult to get a true grasp of the story line.  They really did a great dis-service to the viewers when the decison was made to shorten the film on video.Additionally, a lot of interesting information can be gleaned from the commentary on the DVD.  And, if you love the soundtrack, but are disappointed in the Original Soundtrack CD, (which was listed as 'the companion soundtrack ablbum') one option on the DVD allows you to isolate the soundtrack from the film and listen to your heart's content.  The haunting music written by Dwight is played in several imaginative ways and the refrain waifs itself into your psyche over and over.This film provides new insight into the mind of Dwight Yoakam who proves himself to be a much more intelligent man than I have heretofore recognized or given him credit for.  A quirky sense of humor uncovers itself as well.  Who would have thought it?To all those online reviewers who didn't care for this film, I suggest you watch it again (as I said on DVD this time) and don't take yourself and the movie itself so seriously.  Enjoy instead the absolutely breathtaking scenery, the individual personalities of each the characters, the probable reality of the precise time in history, and the subtle nuances to the story that is being told.By all means go ahead and laugh at the humor, which is rampant, particularly in the roles played by Bud Cort, Michael Jeter, and the individual portraying U. S. Christmas.  Seeing Paul Rubens in a once-in-a-lifetime role should also provide a little interest as well.I am not a true western fan.  Truth be told, I originally watched this film only to see Billy Bob Thornton (who once again gave a very creative performance in a small but important role).  However, I liked it enough on VHS to buy the DVD and now enjoy it over and over as each re-viewing reveals new information, humor, and just plain enjoyment.My hat is off the Mr. Yokam for his courage and intelligence in writing this story, his talent in directing it, his perserverance in the face of time constraints and financial difficulties in completing the film.  I just plain thank him for providing an interesting western film for us to enjoy, and enjoy, and enjoy.If you haven't seen SOHWOH at all, give it a look.

Until then, its pace was that of a Tree Sloth, only less deliberate. This western has an all-star cast, though. The always-wonderful Billy Bob Thorton plays an ever so elegant, overly-eloquent Doc Holiday type, though he shuffles off before any real action takes place. Paul Reubens plays a convincing surprisingly handsome misfit. Dwight Yoakam plays a funny looking guy much in need of a hat. Peter Fonda shows up, then dies. Bridget Fonda shows up, administers an impressive and devastating blow to the groin of one of the bad guys, from which he never rightly recovers. And Vince Vaughn plays a mean, sombero-wearing sonnamabitch. There is even a deputy who wears a dress, though, you never really care enough to find out why he does such a thing. They all take turns waiting for something to happen, they talk before the one hour and twenty minute fun part, but what they said didn't really matter. Just a bunch of names that were hard to remember. I counted no less than four highly inappropriate love scenes, that seemed as passionate and timely as any set of grandparents one can think of. There are a whole slew of unimportant characters, some live and some die. Some of these characters are sporadically consumed with a dizzying range of emotion that I couldn't understand. One of which is a deaf girl whom you cannot help but envy, for she doesn't have to bare the burden of the dull sonorific confusion. It seems Dwight Yoakams, who also directed this feature, main goal was to shoot and kill every actor who was more suited to his craft. Jealousy runs rampant among thespians. I give it two stars because of the star-studded cast, they were fun to watch even though they sort of went down with the ship, except for Billy Bob Thorton, who didn't die, and left, presumably to make a better movie.

There were two problems with this idea. Noble's character gets killed off very early and the DVD was defective. It was missing the scene that explains what's going on. I have to assume that the handful of positive comments were from people who watched an obscure director's cut that had this explanatory scene.But seriously, the writers of the screenplay were totally inexperienced (at screenplays) and the director was totally inexperienced (at writing screenplays and at directing screenplays), so the roadkill that resulted should be no surprise. Let this comment serve as a warning to potential viewers, just because a lot of actors who have performed in excellent films are part of this ensemble does not make it worth viewing. There are some decent performances but the whole is a lot less than the sum of its parts, which in fact adds up to less than zero.Bizarre (in an uninteresting way), sadistic (in a vaguely boring way), foul-mouthed (in a grammar school way), half-baked (in a bad raw egg way), and disorganized (in a director should burn in hell way). It is mostly unwatchable, as even the isolated parts that could be entertaining are burdened with Yoakam and Bertheaud's comically false dialogue. Although this at least gives the production its only hint of unity and should dispel the temptation to blame the result on excessive improv.Imagine inserting clips of ""El Topo"" in no logical order into ""Tombstone"" and you can approximate the product Yoakam inflicts on us unsuspecting Noble Willingham fans. He gave himself the lead role as Valentine Casey, a U.S. Marshall in 1907 Arizona. Casey's old gang and surrogate family keeps popping up and a lot of people are killed and Casey goes after them and eventually everything gets sorted out, although even after just watching the whole thing I couldn't have told you how. Don't understand why the gang keeps turning up or why the Marshall left them to become a lawman or why Pee Wee has put on so much weight. Don't really care either, I think we will just stick to ""The Corndog Man"" and the real ""El Topo"".Then again, what do I know?

In actuality, this is usually just spur of the moment delusional ideation.  Put in the same situation, we too would have failed.  This is not uncommon thinking...we do it all the time, and in regards to all sorts of situations and events as we travel through life and observe.  And why have I said all this?  It is because, as a person of reasonable taste and intelligence, I honestly believe there is no way possible I could write a worse script than that which Yoakam created for this film.  I know, I know, it is possible that I too am committing the falacy of which I described earlier, but I simply don't believe it is possible.  I have written academic term papers with more wit and substance than was contained in Yoakam's film.  A film doesn't have to be conventional or realistic in order to be good.  It does help, though, if it possesses something of interest.  Violence, which this film contains quite a bit of, can make up for some shortfalls, if done well.  In this film, though, I didn't really care who was shooting, who was being shot, or why anything was happening in general.  You see, this film contained about as much character development as a bad SNL skit.  The plot develops as though Yoakam simply wrote the story as he went along.  It's like, &quot;hey, the props guys got wired on crank and built an antique hot air balloon last night, get some film in the camera&quot;.  And a review of this film would not be complete without a comment about the acting.  Yes, there are some fine actors in this film, but sadly, that doesn't mean that fine acting was put on celluloid.  I suppose it's possible, that in creating his statement, Yoakam simply decided to tell his cast to mirror the intelligence of the script in their acting.  If you must watch a mindless violent film, at least watch one with style and purpose...like a Hong Kong era John Woo film. But whatever you do avoid this film.
