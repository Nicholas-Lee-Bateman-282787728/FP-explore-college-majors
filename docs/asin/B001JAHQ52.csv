Toni was muchly missed, she left the show at the end of season 6 (still not sure why). Tracee Ellis Ross is my favorite actress, her character Joan is so neurotic, obsessive, and delightful. I wish this show would have gotten a proper good-bye, Season 8 was never treated with respect. Season 7 does not disappoint, reserve your copy today!",5,Such a treat!,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,439,"['Girlfriends', 'Complete', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'great', 'season', 'even', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'missing', 'Toni', 'was', 'muchly', 'missed', 'left', 'show', 'end', 'season', '6', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Tracee', 'Ellis', 'Ross', 'favorite', 'actress', 'character', 'Joan', 'so', 'neurotic', 'obsessive', 'delightful', 'wish', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'proper', 'good-bye', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'never', 'treated', 'respect', 'Season', '7', 'not', 'disappoint', 'reserve', 'copy', 'today']",Girlfriends: Season 7

I watched the show when it was on air and I loved these characters. I too hated that Jill Marie (Toni) left the show and all throughout I hoped that they would manage to somehow bring her back end. I didn't re4ally like that Monica chick and she didn't even come close to making another girlfriend (in my opinion), I think it was how she was brought into the show. I'm so excited that BET has decided to bring back THE GAME I can't wait for Jan 11.

1205849,A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B001JAHQ52,Geminigirl,"[0, 0]","I really felt the loss of the Toni Childs character this season.  And although the cast is still incredible, the chemistry was a bit off as they forced the Monica (Keesha Sharpe) character into that missing ""girlfriend"" spot.Joan meets a new guy while volunteering in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; Lynn tries to get her music career off the ground by singing @ a karaoke bar; William & Monica marry and separate almost immediately afterwards.  (Off screen Toni refuses to talk to or see Joan.)The only story line I really enjoyed was Maya, Darnell & Jabari moving to the 'burbs and their experiences.  I also loved seeing more of Darnell as he pursued his dream of working on a NASCAR pit crew only to quit and try to buy back his garage.As far as features we get Mara Brock Akil (show runner) speaking briefly about a few episodes. I'm glad I finally got to add this season to my collection - GIRLFRIENDS is one of those shows that doesn't lose its replay value.

He can actually name the characters lol. Amazon always notifies me when every season is being released on dvd and I would pre-ordered them. I found out that itunes was selling season 7 and 8 for my itouch ipod so I defintely bought it but now I'm putting in a order for season 7 because I want to have the whole collection. Thats another thing about me...I like collecting dvds. On the weekends I chill and turn on a dvd on my 52 inch tv in the living room. I have a lot of dvds.
