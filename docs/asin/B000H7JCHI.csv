One can see a beautiful and young Kitty in the 1st season age gracefully in the color seasons. Amanda Blake is one beautiful lady, no matter what age she's at.  The color seasons (3rd disc) had Mannon and this bridges the gap, ties the loose end and makes viewers connect better with the TV movie - Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge produced nearly 20 years later. For this alone, I give this set 5 stars. This set provides a pleasing 20-year time travel through the Gunsmoke franchise. Utterly highly recommended for fans and non-fans.

1011163,A2OAAI7R7MMPBK,B000H7JCHI,"Christopher Nash ""misterphp""","[0, 0]","This 3 disc set of classic episodes from Gunsmoke is a mixed bag.Disc one represents the early years - 7 x 25 minute B/W episodes. These are excellent and show a variety of styles from humourous (Chester's Mail Order Bride) to dark (How To Kill A Woman). There are audio commentaries on some episodes and the original radio versions of 4 of them, starring William (Cannon) Conrad as Matt Dillon.Disc two features 4 x 50 minute episodes, still in black and white. These too are excellent and include Us Haggens, which introduced Festus, who would soon replace Dennis Weaver's Chester as Matt's deputy. Directors' commentaries can be found here, too.The problem is with disc three, which represents the colour episodes. Only one of these - Mannon - is truly classic Gunsmoke. A tense story with sterling work from guest Steve Forrest as the title character, a gunman out to kill Matt. The tone is very adult as Kitty gets badly beaten up. The Legend is OK, but there's not much of the regular characters in it. And the other two are awful. Will Captain Sligo win the widow's affections? Will the Brides And Grooms make it to the altar? Who cares? More importantly where are Matt, Kitty and Festus? They're absent for much of the former and almost totally missing from the latter. As my fellow reviewer Alice J. Capen points out, it's the Gunsmoke characters we want to see.Still, the set is still well worth having for the B/W episodes, the Mannon colour installment, the informative commentaries and those wonderful radio episodes. It's just a shame they couldn't have picked better episodes for most of disc three.Discs one and two:  5 stars.  Disc three 2 stars.

As a hardcore Gunsmoke fanatic ,having seen the first Gunsmoke episode as a 8 year old boy in 1955, it is always great to see my favorite western uncut and restored. As with the original 50th Anniversary set there is an excellent balance of episodes.There are not as many extras on this set. The theme  of the Directors collection allowed me to hear for the first time Peter Graves (Jim Arness's brother) talk about their experiences. Other than Jim's book there is almost no info regarding them together.  I was disappointed in the radio episodes, the quality was terrible.  I am a collector and I know that many of the radio episodes exist in pristine condition. I'm afraid that some viewers will possibly think that all of the radio episodes only exist in the condition of those on the DVD.I would really like to see the black and white hour long episodes featured more on the next set because they are the ones that get very little to no cable airtime.This set is a must have for the serious Gunsmoke collector, the opening gives a goodbye to Dennis Weaver and it is sad that nearly everyone associated with the series is gone.CJ WESTMorrow, GA",4,GUNSMOKE THE DIRECTORS COLLECTION,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,1279,"['was', 'very', 'difficult', 'not', 'start', 'viewing', 'set', 'as', 'soon', 'arrived', 'alas', 'Christmas', 'present', 'held', 'off', '25', 'DEC.', 'hardcore', 'Gunsmoke', 'fanatic', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'Gunsmoke', 'episode', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy', '1955', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'favorite', 'western', 'uncut', 'restored', 'original', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'set', 'excellent', 'balance', 'episodes.There', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'extras', 'set', 'theme', 'Directors', 'collection', 'allowed', 'hear', 'first', 'time', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Jim', 'Arness', 'brother', 'talk', 'experiences', 'Other', 'Jim', 'book', 'almost', 'info', 'regarding', 'together', 'was', 'disappointed', 'radio', 'episodes', 'quality', 'was', 'terrible', 'am', 'collector', 'know', 'many', 'radio', 'episodes', 'exist', 'pristine', 'condition', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'viewers', 'will', 'possibly', 'think', 'radio', 'only', 'exist', 'condition', 'DVD.I', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'black', 'white', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'featured', 'more', 'next', 'set', 'are', 'ones', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'cable', 'airtime.This', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'serious', 'Gunsmoke', 'collector', 'opening', 'goodbye', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'sad', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'associated', 'series', 'gone.CJ', 'WESTMorrow', 'GA']",N/A

Other characters included &#34;Doc&#34;, deputy Chester Good (Dennis Weaver, later McCloud, etc.), and the owner of the saloon and discreetly-questionable lady Miss Kitty, played by the very attractive Amanda Blake.  The characters all became familiar &#34;family&#34;, and the episodes ranged from gritty to funny, violent to character lessons.  It is, of course, an old series and one will pick up on that, it can be corny or by today's standards a bit amateurish at times, but most of the time it holds up very well and it's fun to watch.
