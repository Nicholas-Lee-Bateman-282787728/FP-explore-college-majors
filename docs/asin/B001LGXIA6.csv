Ernie, like Jim Brown before him, was recruited to play football at Syracuse University.This movie follows Earnie's life before, during, and after his time at Syracuse.  It chronicles his successes and failures, his personal challenges, and shows how he met those challenges, including racial prejudice, intolerance, and bigotry.Ernie Davis is played by Rob Brown, an actor recognized for his earlier work in the films ""Finding Forrester"" and ""Coach Carter"".This film is clearly worth a 5-star rating for the sports enthusiast, but it tends to have less appeal for other viewers.

Davis followed the great Jim Brown and played for Syracuse in the late 1950s. Davis might have been even better that Jim Brown. Davis led his team to a national championship and became the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy.This is a another feel-good racism sports movie along the lines of Meet the Titans or Glory Road. I say ""feel-good"" because the harsh realities of American racism in the late 1950s are explored and covered, but racism's true graphic and intense nature is never displayed.Ernie Davis was always an optimistic man. He was one of a few minorities on campus and on the team, yet he was always kind to everyone. This movie made even better because most people haven't heard of Davis. He died tragically at the age of 23 from lukemia. He is truly a man that deserves to be honored in a movie like this.The football scenes are top notch. Dennis Quaid is great as the Orangemen coach. The period settings really capture the feel of the time this movie was based in. On a downside, after watching the film, I still don't feel I know who Ernie Davis was, other than a man who battled racism. I wish the movie could have explored his personal life more.I'm only 36 and thankful I've grown up in a time and location where racism has not been a part of my life.

First,  Ernie Davis was striken with lukemeia while preparing for the College All Star Game in Chicago,  not the Coaches All Ameican Game as the movie shows.  Ernie played in that game in Buffalo and was booed by the crowed for not signing with the Bills, who offered him more money than the Cleveland Browns did.  Second,  in the flash back scene showing Jim Brown signing his first pro contract with the Browns in 1957,  Art Modell's name is mentioned.  Modell did not own the team then,  he bought the team four years later.  Lastly, the movie shows the Syracuse team travelling to Dallas for the 1960 Cotton Bowl on a bus.  I find it hard to believe that a team playing for the national championship even back then took a bus for a trip half way across the country.

Davis is played by Rob Brown.The movie, unfortunately, rather than focusing on Ernie Davis, splits the focus and ends up being not only about Davis but a lot about his football coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, played by Dennis Quaid. Both parts are played well but since this is ""The Ernie Davis Story,"" I would have preferred more about Davis.I would have enjoyed finding out more about how Davis FELT about the times he was living in.  The movie takes place during the height of the civil rights movement.  Davis was also the first African-American - nationally - to become a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity, a Jewish fraternity, while at Syracuse University.  He was also the first African-American to be the first overall draft pick, going to the Redskins in the 1962 NFL draft and then being traded to the Browns.Davis was a fantastic running back, which the movie does show.  He also died tragically at 23 years old of leukemia, before playing his first pro game.The movie was worth watching - as a sports movie, as long as you aren't overly concerned by details; and as an inspirational story.

1214184,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,B001LGXIA6,Christopher J. Martin,"[0, 0]","The Express is the story of Ernie Davis, a running back for Syracuse University that won the 1960 Cotton Bowl MVP on the way to helping his team with the National Championship, and then followed that up with the 1961 Heisman Trophy. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns who wanted to team him with the legendary Jim Brown, also from Syracuse University, in the same backfield.As others have noted, the filmmakers did take some license with the story of Ernie Davis. Although having seen a documentary about Davis, the departures from the truth aren't really very big. For example, the filmmakers portray Davis as having been drafted by the Cleveland Browns. In fact this is not true. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins, but because the Redskins at that time were owned by noted racist George Preston Marshall, Davis was immediately traded to the Cleveland Browns, owned by Art Modell.The action scenes are among the best football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I could almost feel the hits Rob Brown, portraying Davis, took during some of the games portrayed in the film. It was also saddening to me to see the on field racism that Davis had to endure at Syrcause. Jackie Robinson was subjected to taunts and sometimes an occasional dirty play at second base, but as a football player it seems Davis was routinely subjected to dirty hits after the whistle. What Davis went through perhaps was even worse in some ways than what Jackie Robinson endured.I also think that the movie does a good job of portraying Davis as someone who initially only wanted to be a running back and didn't much think about national politics, turning into a responsible thoughtful adult who wanted the chance to do anything his skills could enable him to do, and not be limited by the ""unwritten rules"" of the time.The only gripe I really have with the film is that in my opinion it is too short. After Syracuse wins the National Championship the next season is not portrayed. That said, the last few scenes are very poignant and well done.I'd recommend this DVD to any football fan, especially college football fan.",4,Wonderful Story and Great Action Scenes,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,2105,"['Express', 'story', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'running', 'back', 'Syracuse', 'University', 'won', '1960', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'MVP', 'way', 'helping', 'team', 'National', 'Championship', 'then', 'followed', '1961', 'Heisman', 'Trophy', 'was', 'drafted', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'who', 'wanted', 'team', 'legendary', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'also', 'Syracuse', 'University', 'same', 'backfield.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'take', 'license', 'story', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'having', 'seen', 'documentary', 'Davis', 'departures', 'truth', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'big', 'example', 'filmmakers', 'portray', 'Davis', 'having', 'been', 'drafted', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'fact', 'not', 'true', 'was', 'drafted', 'Washington', 'Redskins', 'Redskins', 'time', 'were', 'owned', 'noted', 'racist', 'George', 'Preston', 'Marshall', 'Davis', 'was', 'immediately', 'traded', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'owned', 'Art', 'Modell.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'football', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'hits', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'portraying', 'Davis', 'took', 'games', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'saddening', 'see', 'field', 'racism', 'Davis', 'had', 'endure', 'Syrcause', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'was', 'subjected', 'taunts', 'sometimes', 'occasional', 'dirty', 'play', 'second', 'base', 'football', 'player', 'Davis', 'was', 'routinely', 'subjected', 'dirty', 'hits', 'whistle', 'What', 'Davis', 'went', 'perhaps', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'ways', 'what', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'endured.I', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Davis', 'someone', 'who', 'initially', 'only', 'wanted', 'be', 'running', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'think', 'national', 'politics', 'turning', 'responsible', 'thoughtful', 'adult', 'who', 'wanted', 'chance', 'do', 'anything', 'skills', 'could', 'enable', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'limited', 'unwritten', 'rules', 'time.The', 'only', 'gripe', 'really', 'have', 'film', 'opinion', 'too', 'short', 'Syracuse', 'National', 'Championship', 'next', 'season', 'not', 'portrayed', 'said', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'poignant', 'well', 'done.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'football', 'fan', 'especially', 'college', 'football', 'fan']",N/A
1214185,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001LGXIA6,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The football footage is excellent in The Express. There's two making of featurettes on the DVD that describe how they made most of the football scenes, those are well worth watching. I usually avoid all the making of films, and these two are an exception. They hired some real football players, and ran real plays. It shows in the film.The story line on the other hand, runs a bit long. This film is 2 hours, and could easily be shortened with no ill effects by 30 minutes. As the director says in the making of featurette, it's a three act film - his youth, college football days, and his disease. The three acts are very clear while watching, and they each ran just a bit too long. Some of the build up of conflict in the football games ran just a bit too long.In general the acting was good. There aren't any weak performances, but then again, there aren't any standout excellent performances.I couldn't wait to see this film. Most of the football footage was filmed at Lane Tech High School in Chicago, there are a lot of students and faculty in the audience. Northwestern University was a stand in for the Cotton Bowl. And most of the street scenes were filmed in and around Chicago. It was fun to know when this film was shot and how long it took to end up on DVD.There are many who nit pick over the details, and sadly those people have really missed the point of the film. Not only do the very end credits say that the Virginia game was manipulated for dramatic effect, the director admits other liberties with truth for dramatic effect. If the errors were massive and critical to the story line, I would agree that is a problem. However they are so minor as to be insignficant.The filming itself was wonderful. The director used different processing techniques to get different film color and effects. The transition around over saturated color, color, and black and white was well done. The sound was really just so so, no really great enveloping sound, just good front channel work. The music soundtrack frequently detracted when it became melodramatic.It was a good flim, but nothing spectacular. Fundamentally, the story is wonderful. But in the end, the filming, the acting, the editing, all made the film feel a bit white washed for the era.It is rated PG. There's a few swear words and one scene in bed between Ernie Davis and his girlfriend that is slightly suggestive.

Yes, I knew he was the first African-American to win the Heisman--and he won it when the civil rights issue was at its zenith.  And yes, I knew he died tragically young, but had no idea leukemia claimed him at age 23, before he even got to play a down in the NFL.  And I did not know the Cleveland Browns, who drafted him to play alongside fellow Syracuse legend Jim Brown, retired his jersey number.  But I know all of this now, thanks to watching THE EXPRESS, a tribute to Ernie Davis and his collegiate career.  Sure, it's a little sappy and reeks of melodramatic cliches at times, but overall this is a very moving story about a young man of strong moral fiber fighting not only tacklers on the field, but a society determined to keep him at second class status.THE EXPRESS features a superb cast, including Rob Brown in the lead role.  Brown plays the young Syracuse superstar with calm demeanor and resolute determination; other actors, given the racial tensions of the setting, might have been tempted to go over the top, but Brown keeps the lid on.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dennis Quaid as gruff head coach Ben Schwartzwalder--a man who must go on a personal journey of his own, as he discovers he's not as open and tolerant as he originally believes.

""Remember The Titans"" was one of the better ones to tackle the issues of racism and bigotry in the '50's and '60's, where even with the PG rating you could get at least a sampling of the tension and drama that a lot of people went through in that time. ""The Express"" deals with a young man by the name of Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown ""Finding Forrester""  who has grown up facing all kinds of racism, bigotry, hate and whatnot throughout his childhood into his teens and to his days at Syracuse College where a running back by the name of Jim Brown (any big time football fan will know this name) has just signed with the pro team Cleveland Browns but didn't win the famed college trophy The Heisman.Ernie has always been fast even as a kid, which is shown in a fantastic opening sequence with a young Ernie outrunning a bunch of white kids, there's scenes with Davis overcoming his stuttering issue thanks to his grandpa encouraging and supporting him. Once he gets to Syracuse the coach (Dennis Quaid, ""The Rookie"") sees him as the next Jim Brown but that doesn't mean he doesn't push his players as Davis harder than ever and expect nothing less than the very best.As far as an accurate story I admit I'm not too familiar with Ernie Davis' story, but as far as the era I feel the filmmakers captured the feel and look of it very well. The hate and scorn black people received during this time probably can't ever be fully captured on film but for a PG rated sports flick ""The Express"" does a more than admiral job telling a great story. The football footage mixes archive clips with movie footage which does make for a great experience though the football aspect is only part of the flick as the real story is how Ernie had a never say die attitude.One great part of the film is a brawl that breaks out during the 1960 Cotton Bowl vs. Texas where the racism just boils over on the field just before halftime. I'm sure there are some liberties taken with the true story, though those who know how it ended know it didn't turn out well, but that doesn't prevent this movie from being one great sports flick that keeps your attention throughout its running time. **** out of 4 stars.",5,"The quest for the heisman, the real quest for respect",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2331,"['Most', 'sports', 'movies', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'events', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'see', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'great', 'example', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'tackle', 'issues', 'racism', 'bigotry', ""'50"", ""'60"", 'where', 'even', 'PG', 'rating', 'could', 'get', 'least', 'sampling', 'tension', 'drama', 'lot', 'people', 'went', 'time', 'Express', 'deals', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'played', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'facing', 'kinds', 'racism', 'bigotry', 'hate', 'whatnot', 'childhood', 'teens', 'days', 'Syracuse', 'College', 'where', 'running', 'back', 'name', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'big', 'time', 'football', 'fan', 'will', 'know', 'name', 'just', 'signed', 'pro', 'team', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'famed', 'college', 'trophy', 'Heisman.Ernie', 'always', 'been', 'fast', 'even', 'kid', 'shown', 'fantastic', 'opening', 'sequence', 'young', 'Ernie', 'outrunning', 'bunch', 'white', 'kids', 'scenes', 'Davis', 'overcoming', 'stuttering', 'issue', 'thanks', 'grandpa', 'encouraging', 'supporting', 'Once', 'Syracuse', 'coach', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Rookie', 'next', 'Jim', 'Brown', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'push', 'players', 'Davis', 'harder', 'ever', 'expect', 'nothing', 'less', 'very', 'best.As', 'far', 'accurate', 'story', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'story', 'as', 'far', 'era', 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'captured', 'feel', 'look', 'very', 'well', 'hate', 'scorn', 'black', 'people', 'received', 'time', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'fully', 'captured', 'film', 'PG', 'rated', 'sports', 'flick', 'Express', 'more', 'admiral', 'job', 'telling', 'great', 'story', 'football', 'footage', 'mixes', 'archive', 'clips', 'movie', 'footage', 'make', 'great', 'experience', 'football', 'aspect', 'only', 'part', 'flick', 'real', 'story', 'how', 'Ernie', 'had', 'never', 'say', 'die', 'attitude.One', 'great', 'part', 'film', 'brawl', 'out', '1960', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'Texas', 'where', 'racism', 'just', 'over', 'field', 'just', 'before', 'halftime', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'true', 'story', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'ended', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'well', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'movie', 'being', 'one', 'great', 'sports', 'flick', 'attention', 'running', 'time', '****', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Yet, not one of the aforementioned presumptive deficiencies serve to mitigate my personal contention it remains a worthwhile movie for any real fan of college sports  and manages to effectively convey the spirit of socio-cultural dictates of the represented era .  It is an absolutely enjoyable drama based on the life Ernie Davis, not a documentary of the life of Ernie Davis.Davis was not a trailblazer nor was he alone in absorbing the ignorant, racist invectives and missiles launched in the direction of blacks from nearly every nook and cranny of an America gradually but at glacial-like pace being moved in the direction of a more pluralistic society. From most accounts and most assuredly based on the depiction in this movie, he was an impressive individual and athlete who by virtue of his athleticism ascended to the status of role model and hero for legions of people but tragically was afflicted with leukemia and died at the much too tender age of 23.Portrayed with subtle intensity by Rob Brown and continually juxtaposed with his college coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid, in a role where significantly more complexity was exhibited than he is typically given credit), it matters little if his spectacular 87 yard touchdown catch/run occurred in the 1st quarter or was transposed to the 4th quarter in the movie for dramatic impact. In either case, the value of his performance  in the 1959 Cotton Bowl was incalculable as it related to the uplift of a marginalized, suppressed black populous in Dallas, Texas specifically and the nation, in general.  Unfortunately, unlike a near to contemporaneous role model from another sport, Roy Campenella, whose career was also derailed by a debilitating disease, Davis never had the opportunity to demonstrate his athletic brilliance in the brighter lights of professional sports  and stills remains an unknown quantity for far too many.Flawed or not, this film is a genuine and timely attempt to address that obscurity.",4,Past interference,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2291,"['Express', 'film', 'numerable', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'fictionalized', 'recitations', 'composite', 'characterizations', 'tangential', 'embellishments', 'not', 'Rudy', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Hoosiers', 'Glory', 'Road', 'Brian', 'Song', 'probability', 'other', 'sports', 'oriented', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'people', 'not', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'presumptive', 'deficiencies', 'serve', 'mitigate', 'personal', 'contention', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'real', 'fan', 'college', 'sports', 'manages', 'effectively', 'convey', 'spirit', 'socio-cultural', 'dictates', 'represented', 'era', 'absolutely', 'enjoyable', 'drama', 'based', 'life', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'not', 'documentary', 'life', 'Ernie', 'Davis.Davis', 'was', 'not', 'trailblazer', 'was', 'alone', 'absorbing', 'ignorant', 'racist', 'invectives', 'missiles', 'launched', 'direction', 'blacks', 'nearly', 'nook', 'cranny', 'America', 'gradually', 'glacial-like', 'pace', 'being', 'moved', 'direction', 'more', 'pluralistic', 'society', 'most', 'accounts', 'most', 'assuredly', 'based', 'depiction', 'movie', 'was', 'impressive', 'individual', 'athlete', 'who', 'virtue', 'athleticism', 'ascended', 'status', 'role', 'model', 'hero', 'legions', 'people', 'tragically', 'was', 'afflicted', 'leukemia', 'died', 'much', 'too', 'tender', 'age', '23.Portrayed', 'subtle', 'intensity', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'continually', 'juxtaposed', 'college', 'coach', 'Ben', 'Schwartzwalder', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'role', 'where', 'significantly', 'more', 'complexity', 'was', 'exhibited', 'typically', 'given', 'credit', 'little', 'spectacular', '87', 'yard', 'touchdown', 'catch/run', 'occurred', '1st', 'quarter', 'was', 'transposed', '4th', 'quarter', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'case', 'value', 'performance', '1959', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'was', 'incalculable', 'related', 'uplift', 'marginalized', 'suppressed', 'black', 'populous', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'specifically', 'nation', 'general', 'Unfortunately', 'near', 'contemporaneous', 'role', 'model', 'sport', 'Roy', 'Campenella', 'career', 'was', 'also', 'derailed', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'Davis', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'demonstrate', 'athletic', 'brilliance', 'brighter', 'lights', 'professional', 'sports', 'stills', 'unknown', 'quantity', 'far', 'too', 'many.Flawed', 'not', 'film', 'genuine', 'timely', 'attempt', 'address', 'obscurity']",N/A

I won't summarize the plot and acting performances, everyone else has already done that here, so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  It's a good movie, not great but never the less and enjoyable view.Video...We have a fairly clean transfer though it is plain to see that it is not a remastering of the film.  There are variations between warm and cool color grading.  The colors are true and natural without that color popping you see in some of the newer movies out today.  In fact, the colors tend to be a touch muted and soft.  This is not a negative per se but it creates a more real image.  Film grain is kept to a minimum without being distracting.  The only place where film grain is highly noticeable is where archival footage is played and, of course, much grain would be noticed there.  I saw no artifacting nor ghosting which is rare on blu rays anyway.  Overall, the video transfer, with its high Mbps rate averaging in the upper 20's provides clean contrast and true colors.Audio...The film defaults to lossless DTS HD 5.1 and dialogue is transparent and easy to understand.  I do believe they got lazy on the audio editing as there is almost no panning or use of the discreet side and rear channels for directionality of foley effects.  However, the great soundtrack comes through all channels and fully envelops you in the audio.  Crowd scenes, while also using all channels sound as if they are the same in all channels without any directionality at all.  Yes, there are a couple of pans from left to right but not many and certainly not as many as there could have been with good editing.  The sub's job is simply to add to the ambience and that's about it.Extras...Plenty of deleted  scenes, none that would be better served in an extended edition. Lots of other extras about Ernie Davis and the 1959 Syracuse team he helped to the championship including very interesting interviews with many of his teammates and the famed Jim Brown, who had recruited him to Syracuse,  and making of documentaries.For the price, if you liked the movie, get the Blu Ray. However, since this is not a comparison of the blu ray and Standard Def DVD, I can't say just how much of an improvement there will be. Since the video on Blu Ray is as clean as it is, my bet is that there would be a somewhat significant difference and lossless audio, to me, is very noticeable on any Blu Ray as compared to a lossy codec. Lossless is always better.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",3,The Express on Blu Ray,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2932,"['Express', 'Ernie', 'Davis', 'Story', 'based', 'life', 'times', 'great', 'college', 'football', 'hero', 'inspiration', 'great', 'many', 'difficult', 'times', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'wo', ""n't"", 'summarize', 'plot', 'acting', 'performances', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'done', 'here', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'never', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'view.Video', 'have', 'fairly', 'clean', 'transfer', 'plain', 'see', 'not', 'remastering', 'film', 'are', 'variations', 'warm', 'cool', 'color', 'grading', 'colors', 'are', 'true', 'natural', 'color', 'popping', 'see', 'newer', 'movies', 'out', 'today', 'fact', 'colors', 'tend', 'be', 'touch', 'muted', 'soft', 'not', 'negative', 'se', 'more', 'real', 'image', 'Film', 'grain', 'kept', 'minimum', 'being', 'distracting', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'grain', 'highly', 'noticeable', 'where', 'archival', 'footage', 'played', 'course', 'much', 'grain', 'would', 'be', 'noticed', 'there', 'saw', 'artifacting', 'ghosting', 'rare', 'blu', 'rays', 'anyway', 'Overall', 'video', 'transfer', 'high', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'averaging', 'upper', '20', 'clean', 'contrast', 'true', 'colors.Audio', 'film', 'defaults', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'dialogue', 'transparent', 'easy', 'understand', 'do', 'believe', 'got', 'lazy', 'audio', 'editing', 'almost', 'panning', 'use', 'discreet', 'side', 'rear', 'channels', 'directionality', 'foley', 'effects', 'However', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'channels', 'fully', 'envelops', 'audio', 'Crowd', 'scenes', 'also', 'using', 'channels', 'sound', 'are', 'same', 'channels', 'directionality', 'Yes', 'are', 'couple', 'pans', 'left', 'right', 'not', 'many', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'editing', 'sub', 'job', 'simply', 'add', 'ambience', 'it.Extras', 'Plenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'none', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'extended', 'edition', 'Lots', 'other', 'extras', 'Ernie', 'Davis', '1959', 'Syracuse', 'team', 'helped', 'championship', 'including', 'very', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'many', 'teammates', 'famed', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'who', 'had', 'recruited', 'Syracuse', 'making', 'documentaries.For', 'price', 'liked', 'movie', 'get', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'However', 'not', 'comparison', 'blu', 'ray', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'improvement', 'will', 'be', 'video', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'as', 'clean', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'significant', 'difference', 'lossless', 'audio', 'very', 'noticeable', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'compared', 'lossy', 'codec', 'Lossless', 'always', 'better.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

The Express, at least on Blu-ray disc, features absolutely stunningly impressive video quality.  Even the most picky of viewers would likely call the picture quality here 'reference' level.  It really is that good and rises to almost match the quality of the story that is in the film.  The same can be said of the audio quality which is equally impressive.Note that I said that the picture and audio quality almost rises to the quality of the story, and yet I also called them reference quality.  If you've picked up on that description then hopefully you'll have figured out my opinion of the story and can probably guess that I can't recommend this film highly enough.Sadly, the film didn't do that well while it was out in theatrical release, earning back less than 1/4 of what was reportedly spent on it.  I think that all says more about how people perceive sports oriented movies than anything else, as it seems people instead want thrillers, slashers and films in other genres to spend their entertainment money on.I don't want to spoil the film for anyone that hasn't seen it, but will say it's based on actual events and a real person.  If you haven't heard of Ernie Davis, don't feel bad as many people probably have no idea of his significance in history.

1214219,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B001LGXIA6,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""","[2, 2]","Bottom-Line: Overall ""The Express"" succeeds at both educating and inspiring and that is never a bad thing!""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008),"" opens with the following narration: ""Twenty-one lines, five yards apart-that's a football game. But there are other lines that run deeper, and wider, that aren't part of any game."" As a Black American male who grew up in the seventies, partly in the North, partly in the South of this nation, I know all too well the meaning of the subtext.But my experiences as traumatic and life-altering as they were to me, were nothing, nothing compared to those of Black American men and women who scarified much in the decade leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. And their courage helped fill in the deep racial divide that so used to stain--and still stains--this nation in rutty ugliness.  They did it by achieving when and where they weren't supposed to, showing the nation and the world that Black Americans were--and are--every bit the equal of White's and, in some cases, better!  Such is the case with Ernie Davis and ""The Express"" is his tale.Story-LineDirected by (Gary Fleder ~ October Road), ""The Express"" opens on an all too familiar scene: two Black American boys (cousins) are confronted by a gaggle of White's demanding the spoils of their labor: collecting glass bottles for the deposits.  One boy hops a train to escape, the other (Ernie Davis ~ Justin Martin) eludes the boys with a combination of slick moves and lightning speed.Flash forward: Ernie Davis (Rob Brown ~ Stop Loss, Treme), nicknamed the ""The Elmira Express,"" is an all-star running back for his Elmira, NY high school and is being recruited by Syracuse University coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid ~ The Parent Trap, Flight of the Phoenix, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) and Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson ~ Soul Food, Stomp The Yard, Lincoln Heights) to play for the Syracuse Orangeman; he accepts.Thus begins an odyssey that will eventually see Ernie Davis win the famed Heisman Trophy in 1961.My Thoughts""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" is an inspiration, how could it not be taking place as it did just as the American Civil Rights movement was kicking into high gear, and Ernie Davis was one of the faces of a young Black America hungry for change.  Racial equality, true justice and equivalency were the touchstones of the movement and Ernie Davis was one of the symbols Black Americans were proud to point to as a representation of the race as a whole.Well-acted and directed, ""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" at times made me smile, made me angry, made me proud and made me shed a tear.  Like I said the movie is inspirational and moving.  Lead Rob Brown turned in an outstanding performance and showcases the all too under-utilized talent Black American actors bring to theatrical table.  Two thumbs up to the Denis Quaid as well for a masterful depiction of a typical college football coach.Here are some thing you do not know about Ernie Davis; I know I did know them before watching this movie: he was a two-time first-team All-America running back at Syracuse University; he led his team to an undefeated season and a national championship, the first for Syracuse University; most importantly, he, Ernie Davis, was the first black man to earn college football's most coveted award, the oft-revered Heisman Trophy.These are the fact young American children, black or white, red, or brown, do not learn about in school, not even at the college level unless you attend a Black College or University, or take an African American studies class.  If you are a Black American child you are taught that your ancestors used to be slaves and little else; good luck trying to find achievements by Black Americans in a Texas state history book!  It takes movies like ""The Express"", Rosewood (1997), Separate But Equal (1991), Roots (1977) and others to tell the unvarnished history of Black achievement in America.Not that ""The Express"" did not take license with the truth; e.g. the team get together at the local rib joint after the Cotton Bowl purportedly never took place.  And the movie was over-dramatic at times.
