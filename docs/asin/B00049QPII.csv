Then my player died.  When I put the DVD in the new player the chapter selection worked fine. Inexplicably the chapter selection works in some players, but not in all.The program itself is very well done. Qigong is physically similar to Tai Chi or Yoga, and uses imagery to channel Chi during each movement. Warm ups and the basics are covered nicely.  The main section demonstrates 18 different exercises. It encourages a viewer to choose one's own order, and to develop a personal style.  Facial and body massages are also included.This was my introduction to Qigong, this stile suits me nicely.",4,Chi,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,763,"['one', 'major', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'not', 'program.When', 'first', 'bought', 'chapter', 'selection', 'di', ""n't"", 'work', 'could', ""n't"", 'skip', 'right', 'specific', 'exercise', 'segment', 'Then', 'player', 'died', 'When', 'put', 'DVD', 'new', 'player', 'chapter', 'selection', 'worked', 'fine', 'Inexplicably', 'chapter', 'selection', 'players', 'not', 'all.The', 'program', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Qigong', 'physically', 'similar', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Yoga', 'imagery', 'channel', 'Chi', 'movement', 'Warm', 'ups', 'basics', 'are', 'covered', 'nicely', 'main', 'section', '18', 'different', 'exercises', 'viewer', 'choose', 'one', 'own', 'order', 'develop', 'personal', 'style', 'Facial', 'body', 'massages', 'are', 'also', 'included.This', 'was', 'introduction', 'Qigong', 'stile', 'suits', 'nicely']",Qigong For Beginners

854931,A3B4G8FF8VC1V3,B00049QPII,J. Preston,"[563, 567]","I just received and viewed this two disc set from Amazon.  It is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in Quigong and its health benefits.There are two discs.  The first is a set of basic Quigong excercises.  Each excercise is its own chapter on the DVD so it is easy to locate a specific exercise.  You can then repeat your viewing of each individual exercise instead of having to view the entire set in serial order to get to the exercise you want to learn.  It makes it easy to watch each exercise and view it many times so that you can easily learn to do it yourself.The second disc is an award winning documentary (aired on PBS) about Quiqong.  The author, Francesco Garripoli, had a background in Western Medicine.  He sold all of his belongings and travelled around China in search of its ancient healing mysteries.  He visited such arcane places as the Shao Lin temple in China which is the Taoist origin of Quigong (Kung Fu or White Crane Chi Kung).  The interviews are succinct, yet, fascinating.  The imagry is an important record of China in transition.  The documentation of Quigong, and, its effects on China and the Western World, emphasizes not only its many benefits to society (as an alternative system of health care), but, also the freedom it bestows on individuals wiling to empower themselves with Quiqong to take responsibilities for their own health.I have practiced Quigong for about five years.  I needed this DVD for review as I will soon be instructing beginners.  This is not only a great DVD for beginners, it is also a great DVD for those needing review of the basic 18 exercises.  It includes Shao Lin self-massage techniques which form a basis for personal health maintenance in Quiqong.  It is also an excellent resource tool for instructors as it shows Francesco and Diasy Lee almost flawlessly performing the exercises in a way that makes it easy for beginners to learn.I will recommend this DVD for my class in lieu of a texbook.",5,Excellent beginning point for Qigong,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1975,"['just', 'received', 'viewed', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'Amazon', 'perfect', 'starting', 'point', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Quigong', 'health', 'are', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'set', 'basic', 'Quigong', 'excercises', 'excercise', 'own', 'chapter', 'DVD', 'easy', 'locate', 'specific', 'exercise', 'can', 'then', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'individual', 'exercise', 'instead', 'having', 'view', 'entire', 'set', 'serial', 'order', 'get', 'exercise', 'want', 'learn', 'easy', 'watch', 'exercise', 'view', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'can', 'easily', 'learn', 'do', 'yourself.The', 'second', 'disc', 'award', 'winning', 'documentary', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Quiqong', 'author', 'Francesco', 'Garripoli', 'had', 'background', 'Western', 'Medicine', 'sold', 'belongings', 'travelled', 'China', 'search', 'ancient', 'healing', 'mysteries', 'visited', 'such', 'arcane', 'places', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'temple', 'China', 'Taoist', 'origin', 'Quigong', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'White', 'Crane', 'Chi', 'Kung', 'interviews', 'are', 'succinct', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'imagry', 'important', 'record', 'China', 'transition', 'documentation', 'Quigong', 'effects', 'China', 'Western', 'World', 'not', 'only', 'many', 'benefits', 'society', 'alternative', 'system', 'health', 'care', 'also', 'freedom', 'individuals', 'wiling', 'empower', 'Quiqong', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'own', 'health.I', 'have', 'practiced', 'Quigong', 'about', 'five', 'years', 'needed', 'DVD', 'review', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'instructing', 'beginners', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'also', 'great', 'DVD', 'needing', 'review', 'basic', '18', 'exercises', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'self-massage', 'techniques', 'form', 'basis', 'personal', 'health', 'maintenance', 'Quiqong', 'also', 'excellent', 'resource', 'tool', 'instructors', 'Francesco', 'Diasy', 'Lee', 'almost', 'flawlessly', 'performing', 'exercises', 'way', 'easy', 'beginners', 'learn.I', 'will', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'class', 'lieu', 'texbook']",Qigong For Beginners

I practice the moves with this DVD and I find it easy to follow.  The benefits were immediate for me, in that I am sleeping better and no more back pains.There are about 20 some different moves to follow on the first DVD.  I am an insomniac, and struggle to go to sleep and stay asleep at nights.  So I do these exercises just before going to bed.  By the time I have completed only the first 3 moves (just 10 minutes), 1) Swimming Dragon, 2) Dragon Pearl and 3) Bau Gau Xun Doa Goung (sp?), I am soooooo relaxed, I can't stay awake to complete the rest of the other 16 moves.But just even the 10 minutes alone are enough to knock me out.  I really do try to get through more of the other exercises, but I just can't keep my eyes open.This DVD has helped me so much to fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply.  Also, my work is very stressful and I usually experience pain and stiffness in my back and neck.  The pain and stiffness are completely gone.  But I do have to do Qigong every night.  If I miss a night, my insomnia and painful neck and back torture me once again.I also love the documentary that comes with it.  Gary Garipoli, the creator of this DVD, has put a lot of heart and soul into this DVD.

But with these instructions going nice and slow, I can do them as long as no one insists I do it perfectly. I like the background and the music and with the two of them (husband and wife)doing it together, I can get a good idea of what I need to do.

I just did the qigong from start to finish and got on the computer. As I was waiting for the effect to kick in, I noticed that the swelling in my hand was gone, my carpal tunnel was not bothering me at all and the locking finger had been released. This is truly amazing! As I was doing the exercises I was trying to keep an open mind. They just seemed so easy that I was afraid that they wouldn't work. But there is something about the mind body connection that really makes this all worth while. This is the perfect complement to my yoga dvd's and I will use it often. What a great discovery!
