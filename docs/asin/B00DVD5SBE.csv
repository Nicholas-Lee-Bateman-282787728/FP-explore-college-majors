1661911,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,B00DVD5SBE,"Arish ""A+""","[0, 1]",This is a touching film about depression and how people make mistakes. I think kristen Bell did an amazing performance in conveying this. Its about a girl that is unhappy with her life in the BIG city and wants a break. Which I can totally relate to the character in many ways. Sometimes when you are alone in a big city people are really cold and noncaring about alot of things. Also everything is rush rush rush and go go go noone cares about the real things that matter. So being that I am familiar with this and moved back to a more down home town this movie makes plenty of sense. I also lived with my dad for a short time to regroup and get my mind intact.Kristen retreats back home to live with mom and dad to sort her life out . She also wants time to get over her depression and to rethink things out and live a simple life for a while. Shes deeply damaged being that she was having an affair with a married man back in the city . So her judgement is clouded tainted and she feels she has no self worth and vunerable. So she meets a group of young guys one in particular 17 years old and becomes more than aquainted. So they get envolved and become really close in many ways. So this is when everything unravels and things start to become hectic between families and friends. This is a good movie and it shows that nobody is perfect and people make mistakes and bad judgements when the chips are down. The ending was sad because they obviously had to both go there seperate ways. Watch this with a open mind because everyone isn't perfect and sometimes we do things out of pain and suffering and loneliness. This is probably her best performance outside of comedy since Roman and Pulse. I am glad to see her doing more serious roles veronica mars should be interesting next year.If you like this then check out :ShameGirls against boysKiss of the DamnedPassionBreaking the GirlsStokerByzantiumAlbatrossNobody WalksLovelaceDisconnectThe EastAmerican MaryExcisionOnly God Forgives ( Takes Patience not like DRIVE),4,THis Is LiFE,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2020,"['touching', 'film', 'depression', 'how', 'people', 'make', 'mistakes', 'think', 'kristen', 'Bell', 'did', 'amazing', 'performance', 'conveying', 'girl', 'unhappy', 'life', 'BIG', 'city', 'break', 'can', 'totally', 'relate', 'character', 'many', 'ways', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'are', 'alone', 'big', 'city', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'cold', 'noncaring', 'alot', 'things', 'Also', 'everything', 'rush', 'rush', 'rush', 'go', 'go', 'go', 'noone', 'real', 'things', 'matter', 'So', 'being', 'am', 'familiar', 'moved', 'back', 'more', 'down', 'home', 'town', 'movie', 'plenty', 'sense', 'also', 'lived', 'dad', 'short', 'time', 'regroup', 'get', 'mind', 'intact.Kristen', 'back', 'home', 'live', 'mom', 'dad', 'sort', 'life', 'out', 'also', 'time', 'get', 'depression', 'rethink', 'things', 'out', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'while', 'Shes', 'deeply', 'damaged', 'being', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'back', 'city', 'judgement', 'clouded', 'tainted', 'self', 'worth', 'vunerable', 'group', 'young', 'guys', 'one', 'particular', '17', 'years', 'old', 'more', 'aquainted', 'get', 'envolved', 'become', 'really', 'close', 'many', 'ways', 'when', 'everything', 'unravels', 'things', 'start', 'become', 'hectic', 'families', 'friends', 'good', 'movie', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'people', 'make', 'mistakes', 'bad', 'judgements', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'ending', 'was', 'sad', 'obviously', 'had', 'go', 'there', 'seperate', 'ways', 'Watch', 'open', 'mind', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'sometimes', 'do', 'things', 'pain', 'suffering', 'loneliness', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'comedy', 'Roman', 'Pulse', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'doing', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'veronica', 'mars', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'next', 'year.If', 'then', 'out', 'ShameGirls', 'boysKiss', 'DamnedPassionBreaking', 'GirlsStokerByzantiumAlbatrossNobody', 'WalksLovelaceDisconnectThe', 'EastAmerican', 'MaryExcisionOnly', 'God', 'Forgives', 'Takes', 'Patience', 'not', 'DRIVE']",The Lifeguard
1661912,A2AA074VOCYCG5,B00DVD5SBE,A. T. Armstrong,"[0, 2]","&#34;Spoiler alert&#34;I do not know where to start here. I have seen plenty of WTF movies, but this falls below that, if there is such a thing. Your senses in this movie are just battered from about five minutes into the movie, all the way to the credits roll. I saw the the preview of this at the theatre, and it looked ok, not paying the cinema ok, but a good rental night movie ok. It is not worth the rental price. Wait for it to show up on HBO or what ever, for free!This movie was written, produced and directed by Liz W. Garcia. Who is a 30 something. I liked her writing style with her work on Cold Case and Memphis Beat. But i am sorry, The lifeguard just drowned as a movie. Total let down for me. This is one of those movies that bother me. It had a good writer, producer and director and not to mention a well assembled cast. Yet, this movie went bad on so many subjects and aspects. I had somehow placed this as a Indie movie up there with The Station Agent. Boy, was i wrong. And i usually enjoy Indie movies a lot. They have a fresh take on everything compared to the hard financed and A list movies.The plot has a 30 year old Leigh(Kristen Bell) pretty much fed up with her, job as a journalist and her lover and life in the City, New York and packs up her cat and cloths and off to rural Connecticut, showing up unannounced at her parents home. Where she was surprised by her old room(normal). Dad(Adam LeFevre) is excited to have her home, mom(Amy Madigan) not so much. She then meets up with old friends, Mel(Mamie Gummer), Todd(Martin Starr) and start to talk about the past. Leigh takes her old job as lifeguard at the(public?)pool. Where she meets little Jason(David Lambert) a 16 year old and his friends. The funny part is Mel is the vice principal at the high school were little David attends. Mel's husband, John(Joshua Harto) is less than thrilled. Todd is a gay art seller(stereotype?) with his own problems and just wants to smoke pot and get high.And then you are bombarded with 30 something's smoking pot purchased from 16 year old's with the vice principal there as well. Then Leigh and little David start having sex on and off. Leigh mom kicks her out of the house she moves in with little David. Leigh's cat gets out from little davids house and goes missing. Leigh and little David are walking thru the woods looking for the cat and come across little David's teenage brother hanging from a  rope in the woods, another troubled teen who just &#34;wanted out&#34; who Todd made moves on at the party the night before. Mel gets fed up with Leighs attitude and goes to little Davids father about Leigh's sexual relationship with his son, fearing she is going to lose her job, or worse, end up in prison, if she does not do something as she is the vice principal. Mel and little David's father(John Finn) meet in the school parking lot, who pretty much tells Mel, little David has real problem's and that little David is getting laid is not something he is worried about. And it ends with Leigh driving back to the city with her cat in a car, even though she took the bus to go home. ? What i said to.Yes there is more, but that sums it up. I really disliked the part where they have a kid casted as Scrappy Kid-Aaron(Anthony Marino)  yes it is in the credits. Him and some other young 10 year old boys are doing what boys do and run around the pool. Leigh get's on to them and tells them to stop running, and the don't. Leigh chases them into the boys bathroom where they are in the process of wetting paper towels with water. Leigh comes into the restroom to scold them and they throw the wet towels at her, like giant spit wads. She starts to scold them and the Scrappy Kid goes into a full blown &#34;adult&#34; curse out and tells her what she can do to him and where she can do it. I found that scene out of the whole movie the most disturbing. They should have found a actor at least &#34;18 years old&#34; to deliver that dialogue. Another amazing thing that movies can get away with these days.The only other line i really did not care for was when Mel and Leigh were talking and Leigh said &#34;I'm sucking the youth out of him like a vampire&#34; in reference to Mel's suspension about Leigh and little David.No i do not have a big problem with the four sex scenes between little David and Leigh. Nothing was shown and it was obvious what they were doing. The one sex scene with Leigh laying face down in the bed with little David on top was a problem, and far overboard for the story. I don't place that much on the fact that she was 30, or 29 as she points out and that he is 16. If a 29 year old guy and a 16 year old girl was caught, he would be in prison. However, the plot had them pretty much as secret lovers, till Todd caught little david and Leigh kissing at the pool by the snack machines.George Lucas pulled all his weight to get Red Tails released into theatres. This movie opened in 500 more theatres to way less money. I find that sad and disturbing in itself.Bottom line, if you are attracted or maybe like Kristen Bell's acting, you will probably find something to like in this movie. If you are expecting a great movie, and plot, you will be disappointed, as i was. This movie just missed it on so many levels. I do not consider what i just watched as even entertainment.",1,"Very depressing, disturbing, not worth a second watch.",1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,5332,"['34', 'Spoiler', 'alert', '34', 'do',

1661913,A3VR94XXKNAEZO,B00DVD5SBE,"Book Girl ""Reader, Writer, Teacher, Laugher""","[1, 3]","The Lifeguard is a movie that would have made an excellent YA book. Leigh (Kristen Bell), the protagonist, is an angsty, unsatisfied 29-year-old, who flees New York in horror at the thought of turning 30 while inhabiting a life that doesn't measure up to her expectations.If that were the whole story, the movie would have been little more than melodramatic tripe. Fortunately, writer and director Liz Garcia broadens her scope to include a multi-generational cast, including Leigh's parents, her old high school friends, and a new generation of disaffected high school students. Leigh's romantic relationship with one of these high school boys serves as a catalyst for change - some beneficial, some painful, some tragic.Garcia's writing credits include Dawson's Creek, and it shows. The plot is enjoyable soapy, with a great soundtrack, and clearly delineated metaphors (the caged lion, the well-timed rain). Fortunately, Garcia also wrote for Wonderfalls, and that influence is also apparent. The characters' misery is authentic and touching. Their reactions to each other and to the situations in which they find themselves are believable. And what could have (should have?) been a film about whiny middle-class white people making bad decisions and getting away with it instead becomes a touching story of the way we let our own limitations and disappointments define us, and the peace we can achieve if accept our own humanity.If it sounds like I'm praising this film for being deeply introspective, don't worry - I'm not.

(if i have to explain that to you, then you might actually enjoy this movie.) and the problem with a story about kids hanging out with adults is that they're, you know, duh ... kids.is there a point to this film? yes: the point is that sometimes in life you get to the end of the diving board and can't make the jump, which makes the shallow end of the pool look pretty tempting -- especially when the people telling you to jump are an uptight mother or an uptight husband. but that makes this a film about people swimming in the shallow end of the pool, and how that makes them all wet. being all wet isn't that tragic or that interesting, and throwing in a criminal sexual relationship between bell and an underage boy only makes it worse. the stakes turn out to be inconsequential for everyone involved (except one kid, in a plot twist telegraphed with big neon supertitles -- ""trouble ahead! bad trouble for this kid!""). and at the climactic point in the movie where a great emotional resolution or personal realization is usually required, it turns out to be this: the lifeguard finds a lost cat in an unfinished home addition. kristen, have a serious talk with your agent.",2,as confused as the heroine,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1768,"['i', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'rousing', 'spates', 'boredom', 'disappointment', 'was', 'feeble', 'movie', 'kristen', 'bell', 'was', 'supposed', 'lift', 'mediocrity', 'perky', 'watchable', 'presence', 'kristen', 'bell', 'career', 'was', 'supposed', 'get', 'next', 'level', 'starring', 'realistic', 'study', 'age', '30', 'indecision', 'hot', 'coitus', 'public', 'restroom', 'sink', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'way.the', 'problem', 'story', 'adults', 'age', '30', 'more', 'less', 'hanging', 'out', 'kids', 'age', '16', 'more', 'less', 'i', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'problems', 'lives', 'i', 'have', 'explain', 'then', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'problem', 'story', 'kids', 'hanging', 'out', 'adults', ""'re"", 'know', 'duh', 'kids.is', 'point', 'film', 'yes', 'point', 'sometimes', 'life', 'get', 'end', 'diving', 'board', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'jump', 'shallow', 'end', 'pool', 'look', 'pretty', 'tempting', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'telling', 'jump', 'are', 'uptight', 'mother', 'uptight', 'husband', 'film', 'people', 'swimming', 'shallow', 'end', 'pool', 'how', 'wet', 'being', 'wet', ""n't"", 'tragic', 'interesting', 'throwing', 'criminal', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'bell', 'underage', 'boy', 'only', 'worse', 'stakes', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'inconsequential', 'everyone', 'involved', 'one', 'kid', 'plot', 'twist', 'telegraphed', 'big', 'neon', 'supertitles', 'trouble', 'ahead', 'bad', 'trouble', 'kid', 'climactic', 'point', 'movie', 'where', 'great', 'emotional', 'resolution', 'personal', 'realization', 'usually', 'required', 'out', 'be', 'lifeguard', 'lost', 'cat', 'unfinished', 'home', 'addition', 'kristen', 'have', 'serious', 'talk', 'agent']",The Lifeguard
1661918,A39IOE754BUPQ1,B00DVD5SBE,"D. Smith ""Music Lover""","[5, 6]","Like most reviewing here I'm a fan of Kristen Bell and seeing her in that red bathing suit on the cover was enough to get my attention (the producers were very smart to use that picture).  And yes, Ms. Bell looks wonderful in that bathing suit (most 30-year-old women who see this movie will feel like slitting their wrists when they see how good she looks in a one-piece).  That about covers what I found good about the movie.  I realized quickly that this was a low-budget indie film (how the hell did they manage to get a real movie star like Kristen Bell to sign on?) with a sophomoric piece of writing for a script.  It probably sounded a lot better in the writer's head; alas he/she lacks the talent to really do the subject justice.  The directing was okay, and the acting was really pretty good considering the script they had to work with.  The camerawork was inconsistent however; several close-ups were too much so; I thought I was watching a TV network show.  The characters were not very well-drawn, IMO.  I thought they were immature and shallow in keeping with the writing as a whole.  Not much happens other than the inexplicable suicide of a peripheral character.  And, as another reviewer said the motivation for Leigh returning home was sketchy at best.  All of this is typical of an indie film which is why they seldom make any money or any noise at award time.  The worst thing for me was the unrealistic sexual relationship between Leigh and Jay.  She's a beautiful 29-year-old professional woman and former HS valedictorian who could have any man she wanted, while he is an immature skate-boarding HS dropout!!!  Really?  You get the feeling this thing was written and produced by a former nerd who had (and still has) fantasies about bedding the HS prom queen.  The big question for me is why Ms. Bell thought doing this movie was a good idea.  Maybe she's not getting offers for &#34;mature&#34; roles from the big studios, who knows.  Regardless, she deserves better.  In conclusion, if you are a fan of Kristen Bell then by all means watch it just to see her; she's good in spite of the pathetic script.

1661924,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00DVD5SBE,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.As I approached the final moments of The Lifeguard, the only thing I could think of was, ""Well, that was underwhelming."" I've been watching a lot of indie films recently and caught the trailer for this movie a few weeks back. It looked interesting enough, and I enjoy Kristen Bell, so I figured, why not? However, the movie fails to pick up speed, reach a satisfying conclusion, or answer the many questions the story leaves you with, which is unfortunate considering the trailer showed so much promise.The story follows a New York reporter by the name of Leigh London (Bell). After having a mid-life crisis at the ripe age of 29, Leigh moves back home to Connecticut with her parents; Justine (Amy Madigan) and Hans (Adam LeFevre). After quickly reconnecting with her high school friends Mel (Mamie Gummer) and Todd (Martin Starr), Leigh gets her old high school job as a lifeguard. It doesn't take long before she meets a group of young teens who remind her of her youth, and pretty soon she starts a relationship that is harmful for everyone involved.Most of the story elements in The Lifeguard aren't new, but that's not what makes this a poor film. For starters, there seems to be a major lack of focus from the moment we meet Leigh to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is all over the place, trying to cover many different topics, but none of them are discussed thoroughly enough. For example, Mel is married to a man named John (Joshua Harto). It's clear that the couple has a rocky relationship, but the audience never discovers why. At first we're led to believe that John may be abusive or controlling, but nothing ever gets explained.Another good example would be Todd's life. In the final act of the film it seems as if the writers are going to uncover some personal issues that he's been hiding, but they never reveal what it is. They peel back the curtain just enough to grab your attention, but then close it shut before they're forced to discuss it. Honestly, it made no sense to me. If you don't want to go in-depth with a character, why half-ass it? Either include it in the story or don't. Because if you don't go all the way it just makes the writers look bad.What bothered me most of all, though, was that the film tried too hard to be artsy. There were these constant long, unnecessary pauses that did nothing except make certain scenes longer. By the end of it, all the time we wasted looking at someone stare off into the distance could've been better spent explaining these characters. Truthfully, I felt as if I didn't even know Leigh. As a character, she lacked focus and a personality that was consistent with itself. Also, she was another individual who seemed to have issues that went beyond what was on the surface, but nothing was ever discussed.What I did like, though, was the acting and the soundtrack. For the most part, the cast is solid across the board, and everyone gave convincing performances. Kristen Bell did the best with what she was given, and I think David Lambert (Little Jason) and Martin Starr showed that they have a lot of potential for dramatic roles. In addition, the soundtrack--consisting of music from The Esthettes, Plants and Animals, and Cocosuma--was nearly flawless. I won't lie, I am unfamiliar with every piece of music that was used, but it definitely set the perfect tone.Overall Score: 5.8/10 - I'll admit, after I watched this film the score in my head was slightly higher, but the more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. There's a solid foundation for a good story, but The Lifeguard winds up falling flat on its face on more than one occasion. While it may have a solid cast and an enjoyable collection of songs, it is weighed down by a weak, unfocused story. If you thought it looked interesting I would recommend giving it a rental, but it's not something you should go out of your way to see.",3,5.8/10 - Disappointing,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,3947,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.As', 'approached', 'final', 'moments', 'Lifeguard', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Well', 'was', 'underwhelming', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'lot', 'indie', 'films', 'recently', 'caught', 'trailer', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'looked', 'interesting', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'However', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'reach', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'answer', 'many', 'questions', 'story', 'unfortunate', 'considering', 'trailer', 'showed', 'so', 'much', 'promise.The', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'reporter', 'name', 'Leigh', 'London', 'Bell', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'ripe', 'age', '29', 'Leigh', 'back', 'home', 'Connecticut', 'parents', 'Justine', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Hans', 'Adam', 'LeFevre', 'quickly', 'reconnecting', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Mel', 'Mamie', 'Gummer', 'Todd', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Leigh', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'job', 'lifeguard', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'group', 'young', 'teens', 'who', 'remind', 'youth', 'pretty', 'soon', 'relationship', 'harmful', 'everyone', 'involved.Most', 'story', 'elements', 'Lifeguard', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'not', 'what', 'poor', 'film', 'starters', 'be', 'major', 'lack', 'focus', 'moment', 'meet', 'Leigh', 'moment', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'narrative', 'place', 'trying', 'cover', 'many', 'different', 'topics', 'none', 'are', 'discussed', 'thoroughly', 'enough', 'example', 'Mel', 'married', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Joshua', 'Harto', 'clear', 'couple', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'audience', 'never', 'why', 'first', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'John', 'may', 'be', 'abusive', 'controlling', 'nothing', 'ever', 'explained.Another', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Todd', 'life', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'uncover', 'personal', 'issues', 'been', 'hiding', 'never', 'reveal', 'what', 'peel', 'back', 'curtain', 'just', 'enough', 'grab', 'attention', 'then', 'close', 'shut', ""'re"", 'forced', 'discuss', 'Honestly', 'made', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'in-depth', 'character', 'why', 'half-ass', 'include', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'just', 'writers', 'look', 'bad.What', 'bothered', 'most', 'was', 'film', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'artsy', 'were', 'constant', 'long', 'unnecessary', 'pauses', 'did', 'nothing', 'make', 'certain', 'scenes', 'longer', 'end', 'time', 'wasted', 'looking', 'someone', 'stare', 'distance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'explaining', 'characters', 'Truthfully', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Leigh', 'character', 'lacked', 'focus', 'personality', 'was', 'consistent', 'Also', 'was', 'individual', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'issues', 'went', 'what', 'was', 'surface', 'nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'discussed.What', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'part', 'cast', 'solid', 'board', 'everyone', 'gave', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'think', 'David', 'Lambert', 'Little', 'Jason', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'showed', 'have', 'lot', 'potential', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'addition', 'soundtrack', 'consisting', 'music', 'Esthettes', 'Plants', 'Animals', 'Cocosuma', 'was', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'am', 'unfamiliar', 'piece', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'definitely', 'set', 'perfect', 'tone.Overall', 'Score', '5.8/10', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'watched', 'film', 'score', 'head', 'was', 'slightly', 'higher', 'more', 'thought', 'more', 'irritated', 'became', 'solid', 'foundation', 'good', 'story', 'Lifeguard', 'up', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'may', 'have', 'solid', 'cast', 'enjoyable', 'collection', 'songs', 'weighed', 'down', 'weak', 'unfocused', 'story', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'rental', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'go', 'way', 'see']",The Lifeguard

She's ticking down to her 30 year milestone and doesn't like her life so she packs up and runs back home to find herself. She takes a low-wage job as a lifeguard, which is a tangible representation of her regression since she held the same job in high school.She reconnects with two of her high school friends who are each undergoing their own quarter-life crises. All are fighting against disappointments and struggling to realize they will have to take action to create the lifes they want. It's easier to regress than to move forward.Juxtoposed against them are a group of high school slacker boys the adults start hanging out with. This stretched my believability. I don't buy that these two groups have enough in common to spend the summer hanging out and playing together as much as they do.The age differences make interesting juxtopositions though. The younger set are chomping to get out into the world and are eager to leave school, get jobs, and be adults. The adults are facing the disappointments of real life versus their high school dreams. The kids are eager to move forward and the adults are paralyzed from taking the action necessary to turn their lives into some with meaning and satisfaction.Leigh (Bell) and Little Jason (Lambert) bubble with sexual chemistry. Between the chemistry and Leigh's desparation, it's understandable why she'd seek sexual solace with a minor. And that's part of where my mixed feelings about the film came in. Having sex with a minor is totally wrong but I could also how it could happen.Amy Madigan is wonderful in the film as Leigh's mom. She loves her daughter but wants to spread her own wings now that her daughter is grown and refuses to compromise. And in doing so, refuses to condone Leigh's regression.Mamie Gummer does a good job with her part as Leigh's friend but her story arc is totally unbelievable. There's no way I buy a high school VP hanging out with her 16 yo students.All in all, this is an enjoyable film and one that will leave me thinking for a while. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and that's where it will take time to absorb.

She plays Leigh, a seemingly successful reporter/writer working in New York City.  She's having an affair with a married man (Sendhil Ramamurthy) who is also her boss.  After her story, about the death of a tiger kept in an apartment, receives little acknowledgement, she is close to a breakdown.  She heads back to her childhood home in Connecticut, surprising her parents (Amy Madigan and Adam LeFevre).Leigh moves back in and gets her old job back as a lifeguard at a condo complex.  Just weeks shy of her 30th birthday, this might seem a bit odd, especially for a promising professional like Leigh.  But as a former lifeguard myself, I can remember back to age 30 thinking, yeah that lifeguard stint was a pretty sweet gig.  And then there is the 1976 movie, a similarly named ""Lifeguard,"" which starred Sam Elliot as a lifeguard pushing 40.  I digress.The only people who seem to show up at this pool are a group of teenaged boys.  Leah strikes up some old relationships with a couple of her friends.  Mamie Gummer is very good as Mel, who is a vice principal and struggling to get pregnant.  Martin Starr plays Todd, a gay best friend.  Now almost all movies require some suspension of reality, but this story by Liz W. Garcia, who also directed, goes off the rails.  Sixteen year old ""Little"" Jason (David Lambert), one of the teens, resides at the condo complex where his dad is the maintenance man.  He begins to eyeball Leigh, and we can see what's coming.Jason and his 2 friends ask Leigh's trio to buy them some beer.  They agree, but only after the teens score some weed.  Remember Principal Mel is part of this conspiracy.  Instead of a clean exchange, they all go into the woods to enjoy the herb and the beer.  If that isn't icky enough, Leigh acquiesces to Jason's advances and not just once.  About this time I was checking law book for statutory rape in Connecticut.  ""Under"" 16.  Whew, that hurdle is cleared.  Good thing they weren't in New York.I'm not sure what Bell was thinking agreeing to this dumb film.  Her characters have now had sex with men from age 16 to 60 something (""House of Lies"").

A large part of the problem lies in the screenwriting.  From the start, the central character of ""Leigh"" isn't fleshed out very well.  She takes leave from her job as an associated press writer because she is assigned to cover a story about a tiger cub who died after being left chained in an apartment.  That alone should leave most viewers scratching their heads in wonder.She takes respite by returning to the picaresque but boring small town where she grew up, to revisit her earlier, happier life as a lifeguard.  She is employed at a pool unlike any I've ever visited.  Most of the time she is the lone authority figure, with no superior, and no co-workers to interact with.  Apparently no one is there to check the clothes baskets, or take money.She makes friends with some punkish skateboarders who seem to remind her of old times, while she reconnects with friends who are trying to make it in their ""adult"" roles and jobs while avoiding the old temptations.  But, Leigh has too strong of an urge to go back to her ""Dazed and Confused"" days, and so she leads her friends off into the woods for various daylight and nighttime dalliances with nature and controlled substances.Kristen Bell has a nice film presence, similar to Jennifer Jason Leigh (or to go even further back, to Glynnis O'Connor in the 1970's).  She deserves better parts than this one.  Though ""The Lifeguard"" has a nice look to it, the movie makes you wonder how many good roles are available these days for young actresses, when so many successful movies are either blockbuster special-effects laden comic book extravaganzas, or silly, gross-out comedies.Amy Madigan (""Field of Dreams"") has a nice turn as Leigh's mother, and Adam Lefevre (who starred in one of the very first ""indies"", ""Return of the Seacaucus Seven"") plays the father.  After an introductory scene, those characters disappear for over a half an hour, although Madigan's confrontation with her daughter later on turns out to be the best scene in the movie.

Garcia and stars lovely Kristen Bell.When twenty-nine-year-old, New York City journalist, Leigh London (Bell), is overwhelmed by personal and professional crises she moves back in with her middle-aged parents in Connecticut. She takes her former high school job as the lifeguard at an apartment complex pool where she kindles a friendship with a sixteen-year-old boy, Little Jason (David Lambert). Leigh enjoys hanging out with the troubled teen and his friends and reverts back to the carefree days of adolescence. Two of Leigh's old friends, Mel (Mamie Gummer) and Todd (Martin Starr), are having personal crises of their own and join the gang. While Leigh and her adult friends retrogress back to adolescence to escape their misery, the misfit-toy teens plan to move to Vermont, which they imagine to be some type of idyllic Shangri-La. Leigh's mother can't abide her daughter's retreat from responsibility and boots her out of the house. When Mel, a school administrator, discovers Leigh has been having sex with Little Jason she is compelled to alert authorities. Leigh gets off scot-free but the close call and an ensuing tragedy snap her out of her funk and she returns to New York in search of a job.I enjoyed Lifeguard if only for Kristen Bell's wonderful performance. Everyone's favorite Polish-American actress has been searching for a proper vehicle to showcase her talents since her three-year run on Veronica Mars. She does a fantastic job in this film. However, the idea of a twenty-nine year old woman taking advantage of a teenager is disturbing. Imagine a film about an adult male in crisis finding comfort between the legs of a sixteen-year-old girl complete with a sex scene involving a lavatory sink. Would a male protagonist have gotten away with the same hand slap that Leigh receives? There's no doubt the provocative subject matter was meant to unsettle audiences in this very limited release. Also, the many scenes with the three adults comfortably hanging with the skateboarding juveniles are simply beyond belief.",3,Teenager Redux,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2093,"['Lifeguard', '2013', 'was', 'directed', 'written', 'Liz', 'W.', 'Garcia', 'stars', 'lovely', 'Kristen', 'Bell.When', 'twenty-nine-year-old', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'journalist', 'Leigh', 'London', 'Bell', 'overwhelmed', 'personal', 'professional', 'crises', 'back', 'middle-aged', 'parents', 'Connecticut', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'job', 'lifeguard', 'apartment', 'complex', 'pool', 'where', 'friendship', 'sixteen-year-old', 'boy', 'Little', 'Jason', 'David', 'Lambert', 'Leigh', 'hanging', 'out', 'troubled', 'teen', 'friends', 'back', 'carefree', 'days', 'adolescence', 'Two', 'Leigh', 'old', 'friends', 'Mel', 'Mamie', 'Gummer', 'Todd', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'are', 'having', 'personal', 'crises', 'own', 'join', 'gang', 'Leigh', 'adult', 'retrogress', 'back', 'adolescence', 'escape', 'misery', 'misfit-toy', 'teens', 'plan', 'move', 'Vermont', 'imagine', 'be', 'type', 'idyllic', 'Shangri-La', 'Leigh', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'abide', 'daughter', 'retreat', 'responsibility', 'boots', 'house', 'When', 'Mel', 'school', 'administrator', 'discovers', 'Leigh', 'been', 'having', 'sex', 'Little', 'Jason', 'compelled', 'alert', 'authorities', 'Leigh', 'scot-free', 'close', 'call', 'ensuing', 'tragedy', 'snap', 'funk', 'New', 'York', 'search', 'job.I', 'enjoyed', 'Lifeguard', 'only', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Everyone', 'favorite', 'Polish-American', 'actress', 'been', 'searching', 'proper', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'talents', 'three-year', 'run', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'fantastic', 'job', 'film', 'However', 'idea', 'twenty-nine', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'taking', 'advantage', 'teenager', 'disturbing', 'Imagine', 'film', 'adult', 'male', 'crisis', 'finding', 'comfort', 'legs', 'sixteen-year-old', 'girl', 'complete', 'sex', 'scene', 'involving', 'lavatory', 'sink', 'Would', 'male', 'protagonist', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'same', 'hand', 'slap', 'Leigh', 'doubt', 'provocative', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'meant', 'unsettle', 'audiences', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'Also', 'many', 'scenes', 'three', 'adults', 'comfortably', 'hanging', 'skateboarding', 'juveniles', 'are', 'simply', 'belief']",The Lifeguard
1661940,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00DVD5SBE,Tony Heck,"[20, 21]","""Things happen, keep moving or die."" Leigh (Bell) is a reporter working for a paper in New York. After writing an article she is passionate about she quits when it won't get published and ends up moving back home. While she is trying to make sense of her life she gets a job as a lifeguard and reconnects with her parents and her old friends. Leigh learns the meaning of 'you can't go home again'. There is a saying you can't judge a book by its cover, after watching this one it should also be applied to movies. Going off the cover I expected a nice light comedy with Kristin Bell playing her usual character. I got the exact opposite. The movie is a heavy drama with very real issues. After moving home she finds that her friends are not who they once were and neither are her parents. She begins a romance with an underage boy at the place where she works which has repercussions for everyone. This is nothing like I expected but I did really like it much more then I expected. Overall, a different movie and role for Bell but it works. Depressing but good. I say B+.",3,A different movie and role for Kristin Bell.

The acting is great, and easy to watch, allowing the viewer to fall right into the story with the characters. There aren't a lot of visuals in this movie - no special effects, nor mesmerizing camera shots. But the story and characters carry you all the way through. It leans toward being a chick flick, but has quite a few guy moments. Both men and women can identify with Kristen Bell, either directly, or as their girlfriend or acquaintance in their lives. A fun movie about real life.",5,"Low budget, but heart warming",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,542,"['sweet', 'movie', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'acting', 'great', 'easy', 'watch', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'fall', 'right', 'story', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'visuals', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'mesmerizing', 'camera', 'shots', 'story', 'characters', 'carry', 'way', 'being', 'chick', 'flick', 'quite', 'few', 'guy', 'moments', 'men', 'women', 'can', 'identify', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'either', 'directly', 'girlfriend', 'acquaintance', 'lives', 'fun', 'movie', 'real', 'life']",The Lifeguard
