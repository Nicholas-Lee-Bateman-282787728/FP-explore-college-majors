Lots of fun for them... and the adults, too.  It's a clean movie with good moral messages.

So when I saw the preview ofDurango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, whilecute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that'swhy I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to saveOuray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,intended for young and undemanding children.  Don't bother unless youlove Durango as much as I do.",2,Silly disappointing kid movie,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,655,"['Colorado', 'San', 'Juan', 'Mountains', 'Durango', 'Silverton', 'Ouray', 'myfavorite', 'place', 'vacation', 'USA', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'ofDurango', 'Kids', 'DVD', 'decided', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'isone', 'movies', 'where', 'villains', 'are', 'cartoonish', 'kids', 'whilecute', 'outsmart', 'stupid', 'adults', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'showed', 'somenice', 'locations', 'Durango', 'including', 'steam', 'train', ""that'swhy"", 'purchased', 'used', 'copy', 'then', 'time', 'travel', 'saveOuray', 'becoming', 'ghost', 'town', 'movie', 'stupid', 'bore', 'intended', 'young', 'undemanding', 'children', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'youlove', 'Durango', 'as', 'much', 'do']",Durango Kids

It is but targeted for the 12-15 (or so) age group, but that's okay I still enjoyed it. The downside to this purchase was (and wasn't all that bad) was that there was no coverart - oh well.
