778563,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0000DGBEY,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","As most people who are interested in the 4th season probably know, Babylon 5 is considered to be one of the better science fiction shows ever on TV. This seasons does not disappoint. A number of story lines are resolved in this season and the stage is set for a somewhat new direction for the show in the 5th season. The only somewhat odd aspect to the show was that it was sort of designed to be the last season when they thought it would be so everything left to tell was compacted into one season. This means that one of the major story lines of the series up to that point, namely the Shadow War, gets resolved somewhat abruptly right in the middle of the season and then the second major story line, the political situation on Earth, gets resolved in the second. This makes for a very packed schedule in which the action never seems to stop. Some of the episodes, especially near the end are very emotional.I would say that there were only a couple of things I didn't like. The first was how Captain Sheridan seems to go missing and then come back from the dead not once, but twice only to carry on almost as if nothing happened. The other thing I didn't like was the Minbari Civil War. It seemed almost like an afterthought tacked on as a background for a story about Delenn and the creation of a new Grey Council. Some people may also be disappointed about the departure of two popular characters at the end of the season. In any case, all of these things are very minor. This season is really one that will keep you at the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens next. It ends up with a not-so-well-liked substitute season finale which imagines the impact of the new alliance in the future, but I personally kind of like the episode. If you have watched the first three seasons, you won't want to miss this one.",5,About as good as it gets,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1829,"['most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', '4th', 'season', 'probably', 'know', 'Babylon', '5', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'science', 'fiction', 'ever', 'TV', 'seasons', 'not', 'disappoint', 'number', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'resolved', 'season', 'stage', 'set', 'somewhat', 'new', 'direction', 'show', '5th', 'season', 'only', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'aspect', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'sort', 'designed', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'when', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'everything', 'left', 'tell', 'was', 'compacted', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'major', 'story', 'lines', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'namely', 'Shadow', 'War', 'resolved', 'somewhat', 'abruptly', 'right', 'middle', 'season', 'then', 'second', 'major', 'story', 'line', 'political', 'situation', 'Earth', 'resolved', 'second', 'very', 'packed', 'schedule', 'action', 'never', 'stop', 'episodes', 'especially', 'end', 'are', 'very', 'emotional.I', 'would', 'say', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'was', 'how', 'Captain', 'Sheridan', 'go', 'missing', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'only', 'carry', 'almost', 'nothing', 'happened', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Minbari', 'Civil', 'War', 'seemed', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'tacked', 'background', 'story', 'Delenn', 'creation', 'new', 'Grey', 'Council', 'people', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'departure', 'two', 'popular', 'characters', 'end', 'season', 'case', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'season', 'really', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'up', 'not-so-well-liked', 'substitute', 'season', 'finale', 'impact', 'new', 'alliance', 'future', 'personally', 'kind', 'episode', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'one']",Babylon 5: Season 4

You are presented with characters you can like, characters you can hate, and characters that will disappoint you. The characters are not one dimensional, and the show keeps you rivetted all the way through.Most shows have a kind of villian of the week mentality, and what happened the week before has little relevance to what happens this week. Babylon 5 doesn't, and in fact there are things characters do in season one that don't make sense till season 3 and beyond.At the start of the season after the &quot;cliffhanger&quot;(Oh, I know this is a terrible pun) ending of season 3 we watch as the characters have try to figure out what to do next. Sheridan is most likely dead on Z'ha'dum, and Garabaldi has disappeared. The Shadows have paused as they try to recover from the large hole the whitestar made in there homeworld as it made its final attack with two powerful nuclear devices. Londo is on Centauri Prime and has one of his nightmares confirmed as the Emperor gives the shadows a small island to use as a base. G'kar has decided to go looking for Garabaldi. From here everything starts getting worse as the Shadows and Vorlons begin using massive planet killers to destroy anyone supporting the other. The Alliance Sheridan struggled to put together is falling apart, G'kar is captured by the Centauri, and when they find Garabaldi he is not the same.Then when all seems darkest Sheridan returns with one of the best lines ever. (Drazi Ambassador) &quot;Captain...we thought you were dead.&quot; (Capt. Sheridan)&quot;I was. I'm better now.&quot;Sheridan revitalizes the alliance and gathers together the largest fleet the younger races have ever put together, and prepares to launch a last desperate battle against the Vorlons and Shadows. Meanwhile Londo strikes a deal with G'kar that if he helps Londo get rid of the Emperor, Londo with free the Narn. The stage is set for one of the most climatic two episodes of the entire series, and of television as the fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of Londo/G'kar and John Sheridan.And like all great heroes they accomplish their victories, but at a terrible price. John's attack on Z'ha'dum has left him with only twenty years left to live, and G'kar has lost an eye. This is only the begin of this great season which by then end will give up a Minbari civil war, and a human civil war. We will learn what has happened to Garabaldi, and find new reasons to hate Alfred Bester.Then in the final episode of the season we are treated to with the exception of Joss Whedon's dream episode in season four of Buffy, the most original episode of any American Scifi show. An episode that gives us a look at the future of humanity, and how our characters actions will live through time. This is the best season of Babylon 5 as all the characters are stretched, and must pay a price for each victory they achieve. Heroes are boring if they win without some sacrifice and not just a physical one.

778567,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0000DGBEY,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","When Warner Brothers renewed Babylon 5 for its fourth and supposedly penultimate season, they had a problem. B5 was one of a number of shows that had been commissioned as part of an attempt to create a new network out of a number of syndication stations, dubbed PTEN. PTEN collapsed during B5's third season, resulting in some legal and funding problems in getting the show to continue. Whilst its ratings remained decent (outperforming the rival Star Trek shows in some key markets), there was some discussion about if the show's modest success was worth the considerable effort and expense to keep it on the air. Producer J. Michael Straczynski was informed of this debate and decided to take drastic action. To protect the integrity of the series, he decided to collapse several long-running plot threads that had been planned to extend into Season 5 so they ended in Season 4 instead, and pull back on the foreshadowing for Season 5. This way, if Season 4 was the end, the show would have a decent amount of closure whilst simultaneously not making a fifth season an impossibility. Unfortunately, this meant that JMS would have to write all 22 scripts again himself, and also change the nature of how a B5 season works in terms of pacing.Season 4 picks up a few days after thee events at the end of Season 3. Half the Galaxy is at war with the Shadows, but with the Shadow homeworld of Z'ha'dum apparently devastated in a nuclear strike and their ships regrouping, the alliance of worlds brought together by the B5 crew is collapsing as its members withdraw their ships to defend their homeworlds. Sheridan is feared dead amongst the ashes of the Shadow homeworld, Garibaldi is missing, Londo has been summoned to high office on Centauri Prime and the Vorlons seem to be preparing to go on the offensive, and not too concerned about collateral damage along the way.This is B5 at its most serialised. Straight from the off, JMS rams the accelerator pedal right down and the Shadow War is concluded with almost indecent speed, whilst events on Earth and the Minbari homeworld are suddenly back brought into the limelight before the audience can pause for breath. It's certainly a different approach, and whilst the dropping of the irrelevant non-arc filler episodes is laudable, it can be argued that the relentless action comes at some of the expense of characterisation and worldbuilding we saw in earlier seasons. That said, the story itself is gripping, with Jerry Doyle in particular delivering standout work showing how far he's come since the first season, and every character gets their moment in the sun as the crew of B5 finally decisively strike back against the chaos of the last three years. Special mention must go to Worthram Krimmer as the Centauri Emperor Cartagia, one of the most memorable characters to appear in the show, whilst Walter Koenig does some sterling work later in the season.One sad loss between seasons is the dropping of Foundation Imaging as the providers of CGI on the show. The replacement effects are adequate, but are nowhere near the quality of Foundation in terms of imaginative ship design or the use of real-world physics, which is a shame.By the time Season 4 ends, the feeling is that the story is over. The Shadow and Earth Civil War storylines are resolved, if rather messily and not fully, and there is the distinct feeling that there isn't much more to say. As it happened, the show was rescued from cancellation by the TNT Network and a fifth season was commissioned, which proved to be a controversial decision among fans.Season 4 of Babylon 5 (****) is fast-moving and provides generally impressive and decent resolutions to a lot of the show's long-running storylines. However, the series has to sacrifice some its pacing and more subtle elements in the rush to cram the story into as few episodes as possible, which leads to some problems.",4,"Satisfying, but it feels rushed and sloppy",1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,3896,"['When', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'renewed', 'Babylon', '5', 'fourth', 'supposedly', 'penultimate', 'season', 'had', 'problem', 'B5', 'was', 'one', 'number', 'shows', 'had', 'been', 'commissioned', 'part', 'attempt', 'create', 'new', 'network', 'number', 'syndication', 'stations', 'dubbed', 'PTEN', 'PTEN', 'collapsed', 'B5', 'third', 'season', 'resulting', 'legal', 'funding', 'problems', 'getting', 'show', 'continue', 'Whilst', 'ratings', 'remained', 'decent', 'outperforming', 'rival', 'Star', 'Trek', 'key', 'markets', 'was', 'discussion', 'show', 'modest', 'success', 'was', 'worth', 'considerable', 'effort', 'expense', 'keep', 'air', 'Producer', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'was', 'informed', 'debate', 'decided', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'protect', 'integrity', 'series', 'decided', 'collapse', 'several', 'long-running', 'plot', 'threads', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'extend', 'Season', '5', 'ended', 'Season', '4', 'instead', 'pull', 'back', 'foreshadowing', 'Season', '5', 'way', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'end', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'decent', 'amount', 'closure', 'whilst', 'simultaneously', 'not', 'making', 'fifth', 'season', 'impossibility', 'Unfortunately', 'meant', 'JMS', 'would', 'have', 'write', '22', 'scripts', 'again', 'also', 'change', 'nature', 'how', 'B5', 'season', 'terms', 'pacing.Season', '4', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'thee', 'events', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'Galaxy', 'war', 'Shadows', 'Shadow', 'homeworld', ""Z'ha'dum"", 'apparently', 'devastated', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'ships', 'regrouping', 'alliance', 'worlds', 'brought', 'together', 'B5', 'crew', 'collapsing', 'members', 'withdraw', 'ships', 'defend', 'homeworlds', 'Sheridan', 'feared', 'dead', 'ashes', 'Shadow', 'homeworld', 'Garibaldi', 'missing', 'Londo', 'been', 'summoned', 'high', 'office', 'Centauri', 'Prime', 'Vorlons', 'seem', 'be', 'preparing', 'go', 'offensive', 'not', 'too', 'concerned', 'collateral', 'damage', 'way.This', 'B5', 'most', 'serialised', 'Straight', 'off', 'JMS', 'accelerator', 'pedal', 'right', 'down', 'Shadow', 'War', 'concluded', 'almost', 'indecent', 'speed', 'whilst', 'events', 'Earth', 'Minbari', 'homeworld', 'are', 'suddenly', 'back', 'brought', 'limelight', 'audience', 'can', 'pause', 'breath', 'certainly', 'different', 'approach', 'whilst', 'dropping', 'irrelevant', 'non-arc', 'filler', 'episodes', 'laudable', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'relentless', 'action', 'expense', 'characterisation', 'worldbuilding', 'saw', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'said', 'story', 'gripping', 'Jerry', 'Doyle', 'particular', 'delivering', 'standout', 'work', 'showing', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'moment', 'sun', 'crew', 'B5', 'finally', 'decisively', 'strike', 'back', 'chaos', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'Special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Worthram', 'Krimmer', 'Centauri', 'Emperor', 'Cartagia', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'appear', 'show', 'whilst', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'sterling', 'work', 'later', 'season.One', 'sad', 'loss', 'seasons', 'dropping', 'Foundation', 'Imaging', 'providers', 'CGI', 'show', 'replacement', 'effects', 'are', 'adequate', 'are', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'Foundation', 'terms', 'imaginative', 'ship', 'design', 'use', 'real-world', 'physics', 'shame.By', 'time', 'Season', '4', 'ends', 'feeling', 'story', 'Shadow', 'Earth', 'Civil', 'War', 'storylines', 'are', 'resolved', 'rather', 'messily', 'not', 'fully', 'distinct', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'say', 'happened', 'show', 'was', 'rescued', 'cancellation', 'TNT', 'Network', 'fifth', 'season', 'was', 'commissioned', 'proved', 'be', 'controversial', 'decision', 'fans.Season', '4', 'Babylon', '5', '****', 'fast-moving', 'generally', 'impressive', 'decent', 'resolutions', 'lot', 'show', 'long-running', 'storylines', 'However', 'series', 'sacrifice', 'pacing', 'more', 'subtle', 'elements', 'rush', 'cram', 'story', 'few', 'episodes', 'possible', 'problems']",Babylon 5: Season 4

The ability to quickly visit any scene from any show easily justifies the extra cost.Season three is where most B5 fans got hooked - I know I did. I watched season one on and off. With season two, I found myself watching more. By the time the story arc began to unfold in season two, I was watching every week. By season three, watching every week's episode had taken on the nature of an almost spiritual imperative. Unlike some here, I don't necessarily consider season four a close second, but pretty much equal to season three.B5 broke so much new ground, it's hard to list it all. It certainly was one of the first to show bad things happening to good characters. It took the bold step of letting you believe for years that certain characters were good (or bad), when they might turn out to be much more complex in the end. The characters become so real to us that I've seen grown men choke back their emotions when a character you only saw in a robotic suit incapable of expressing emotion get killed. B5 was a pioneer in admitting to and exploring issues of faith even though its creator and writer is an avowed atheist.Even in its portrayal of relationships, romantic and otherwise, it was unique. Everywhere else on TV, characters were introduced in act 1 and in bed by act 3. As in real life, this also happened on B5, but you also got a chance to savor the growth of relationships you could never hope to see on episodic TV. B5 had its share of great love stories but they were never formulaic. Two were cut short by tragedy, but one of those was never consummated while the other grew from a one-night stand with political motives. You even saw people who were close and had some obvious attraction, but chose for various good reasons not to act on those feelings. Based on perhaps limited experience, these people seem more real and interesting to me than most I see on TV.At a time when most entertainment teaches few positive values, B5 celebrates commitment to a greater cause. It balances this with cautionary tales that suggest we be constantly vigilant that our cause is really just. It teaches self-sacrifice. Simply watching most episodes of B5 is like a workout for your conscience. It makes you think. The characters themselves think. It taught that victories aren't always won by violence and that the only persistent peace is achieved through conscience, commitment, and determination.",5,Quoting my seaon 3 review - still the best TV ever,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,2777,"['Combining', 'plot', 'elements', 'reminiscent', 'Tolkien', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'writing', 'rarely', 'been', 'equalled', 'characters', 'actually', 'care', 'epic', 'story', 'spanning', 'ages', 'generations', 'still', 'more', 'believability', 'frame', 'most', 'non-SF', 'dramas', 'B5', 'class', 'others', 'here', ""'m"", 'replacing', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'are', 'released', 'ability', 'quickly', 'visit', 'scene', 'show', 'easily', 'extra', 'cost.Season', 'three', 'where', 'most', 'B5', 'fans', 'got', 'hooked', 'know', 'did', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'found', 'watching', 'more', 'time', 'story', 'arc', 'began', 'unfold', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'watching', 'week', 'season', 'three', 'watching', 'week', 'episode', 'had', 'taken', 'nature', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'imperative', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'consider', 'season', 'four', 'close', 'second', 'pretty', 'much', 'equal', 'season', 'three.B5', 'broke', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'ground', 'hard', 'list', 'certainly', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'show', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'good', 'characters', 'took', 'bold', 'step', 'letting', 'believe', 'years', 'certain', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'when', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'end', 'characters', 'become', 'so', 'real', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'grown', 'men', 'choke', 'back', 'emotions', 'when', 'character', 'only', 'saw', 'robotic', 'suit', 'incapable', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'get', 'killed', 'B5', 'was', 'pioneer', 'admitting', 'exploring', 'issues', 'faith', 'even', 'creator', 'writer', 'avowed', 'atheist.Even', 'portrayal', 'relationships', 'romantic', 'otherwise', 'was', 'unique', 'Everywhere', 'else', 'TV', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'act', '1', 'bed', 'act', '3', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'happened', 'B5', 'also', 'got', 'chance', 'savor', 'growth', 'relationships', 'could', 'never', 'hope', 'see', 'episodic', 'TV', 'B5', 'had', 'share', 'great', 'love', 'stories', 'were', 'never', 'formulaic', 'Two', 'were', 'cut', 'short', 'tragedy', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'consummated', 'other', 'grew', 'one-night', 'stand', 'political', 'motives', 'even', 'saw', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'had', 'obvious', 'attraction', 'chose', 'various', 'good', 'reasons', 'not', 'act', 'feelings', 'Based', 'perhaps', 'limited', 'experience', 'people', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'interesting', 'most', 'see', 'TV.At', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'entertainment', 'teaches', 'few', 'positive', 'values', 'B5', 'commitment', 'greater', 'cause', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'suggest', 'be', 'constantly', 'vigilant', 'cause', 'really', 'just', 'self-sacrifice', 'Simply', 'watching', 'most', 'episodes', 'B5', 'workout', 'conscience', 'think', 'characters', 'think', 'taught', 'victories', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'won', 'violence', 'only', 'persistent', 'peace', 'achieved', 'conscience', 'commitment', 'determination']",Babylon 5: Season 4

Luckily, we have the DVD sets so all us ""B5'ers"" can continue to enjoy the experience.  I have no complaints about disc quality, not being a techie with a state-of-the-art video/audio system.  The dvd's play nicely on my little cobbled-together group of boxes, and besides, I'm so absorbed in the shows I rarely notice glitches!The only other ""space opera"" that followed such a closely planned arc of stories was ""Deep Space Nine"", which is for my money superior to B5 in sets, acting, and special effects---the Star Trek bunch just had more money!

778571,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000DGBEY,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[7, 8]","Nominated for 6 Emmys and 3 Hugo Awards in its five-season run, Babylon 5 changed the landscape of the TV science fiction series genre. Following on the heels of hit series such as Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 is unrivaled by any of its peers in its application of special effects. The brainchild of J. Michael Straczynski (writer for such shows as Murder She Wrote and Walker, Texas Ranger), the hour-long sci-fi drama series breaks new ground by deploying a five-season storyline that follows the outline of a traditional novel. As such, Babylon 5 is more like a mini-series that lasts five years instead of the usual three to five nights. And also unlike its predecessors, the series showcases original advanced technologies, believable alien characters (who speak alien and not English), and boasts of superb costume and makeup. Premiering in mid-season 1994, Babylon 5 established a solid audience and continues to inspire new generations of fans via syndicated reruns on cable...Babylon 5 follows the daily events that transpire on Babylon 5, a five-mile long space station from the year 2258. Built by the Earth Alliance, Babylon 5 orbits a lone planet in interplanetary (neutral) space. The setting for an Earthling military post and a transportation hub for businessmen and general travelers, the space station's primary purpose is to provide a safe haven for the airing of differences between the alien races. Similar in function to the United Nations, Babylon 5 is tasked with preserving the peace between the five primary space-traveling civilizations - the Earth Alliance, the Mimbari Federation, the Centauri Republic, the Narn Regime, and the Vorlon Empire. Headed by Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare), and later by Capt. John J. Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner), Babylon 5 is home to almost 300,000 humans and their alien counterparts. With so many confined to such a small area, the space station is ripe for internal struggle, racial conflict, regular cast members' personal problems, and showdowns between various political interests. It's this intricate and diverse storyboard, coupled with amazing visual effects, that makes Babylon 5 one of the most successful sci-fi TV shows in recent memory...The Babylon 5 (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Hour of the Wolf"" in which Capt. Sheridan and Garibaldi are both missing and presumed dead in the aftermath of the Z'ha'dum explosion. Meanwhile, Londo has taken on a new job as a security advisor to the emperor of the Centauri Republic... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Illusion of Truth"" in which a pack of ISN reporters arrives on Babylon 5, incurring Capt. Sheridan's wrath and later his blessing, and ""The Face of the Enemy"" in which Garibaldi betrays the trust of his former commander, Capt. Sheridan, setting a trap for him and using Sheridan's father as the bait...Below is a list of episodes included on the Babylon 5 (Season 4) DVD:Episode 67 (The Hour of the Wolf)Episode 68 (What Ever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?)Episode 69 (The Summoning)Episode 70 (Falling Towards Apotheosis)Episode 71 (The Long Night)Episode 72 (Into the Fire)Episode 73 (Epiphanies)Episode 74 (The Illusion of Truth)Episode 75 (Atonement)Episode 76 (Racing Mars)Episode 77 (Lines of Communication)Episode 78 (Conflicts of Interest)Episode 79 (Rumors, Bargains, and Lies)Episode 80 (Moments of Transition)Episode 81 (No Surrender, No Retreat)Episode 82 (The Exercise of Vital Powers)Episode 83 (The Face of the Enemy)Episode 84 (Intersections in Real Time)Episode 85 (Between the Darkness and the Light)Episode 86 (Endgame)Episode 87 (Rising Star)Episode 88 (The Deconstruction of Falling Stars)The DVD Report",5,A top-notch sci-fi series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3763,"['Nominated', '6', 'Emmys', '3', 'Hugo', 'Awards', 'five-season', 'run', 'Babylon', '5', 'changed', 'landscape', 'TV', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'genre', 'Following', 'heels', 'hit', 'series', 'such', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Babylon', '5', 'unrivaled', 'peers', 'application', 'special', 'effects', 'brainchild', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'writer', 'such', 'shows', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'hour-long', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'series', 'new', 'ground', 'deploying', 'five-season', 'storyline', 'outline', 'traditional', 'novel', 'such', 'Babylon', '5', 'more', 'mini-series', 'five', 'years', 'instead', 'usual', 'three', 'five', 'nights', 'also', 'predecessors', 'series', 'original', 'advanced', 'technologies', 'believable', 'alien', 'characters', 'who', 'speak', 'alien', 'not', 'English', 'boasts', 'superb', 'costume', 'makeup', 'Premiering', 'mid-season', '1994', 'Babylon', '5', 'established', 'solid', 'audience', 'inspire', 'new', 'generations', 'fans', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'cable', 'Babylon', '5', 'daily', 'events', 'transpire', 'Babylon', '5', 'five-mile', 'long', 'space', 'station', 'year', '2258', 'Built', 'Earth', 'Alliance', 'Babylon', '5', 'lone', 'planet', 'interplanetary', 'neutral', 'space', 'setting', 'Earthling', 'military', 'post', 'transportation', 'hub', 'businessmen', 'general', 'travelers', 'space', 'station', 'primary', 'purpose', 'provide', 'safe', 'haven', 'airing', 'differences', 'alien', 'races', 'Similar', 'function', 'United', 'Nations', 'Babylon', '5', 'tasked', 'preserving', 'peace', 'five', 'primary', 'space-traveling', 'civilizations', 'Earth', 'Alliance', 'Mimbari', 'Federation', 'Centauri', 'Republic', 'Narn', 'Regime', 'Vorlon', 'Empire', 'Headed', 'Commander', 'Jeffrey', 'Sinclair', 'Michael', ""O'Hare"", 'later', 'Capt', 'John', 'J.', 'Sheridan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Babylon', '5', 'home', 'almost', '300,000', 'humans', 'alien', 'counterparts', 'so', 'many', 'confined', 'small', 'area', 'space', 'station', 'ripe', 'internal', 'struggle', 'racial', 'conflict', 'regular', 'cast', 'members', 'personal', 'problems', 'showdowns', 'various', 'political', 'interests', 'intricate', 'diverse', 'storyboard', 'coupled', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'Babylon', '5', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'shows', 'recent', 'memory', 'Babylon', '5', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Hour', 'Wolf', 'Capt', 'Sheridan', 'Garibaldi', 'are', 'missing', 'presumed', 'dead', 'aftermath', ""Z'ha'dum"", 'explosion', 'Meanwhile', 'Londo', 'taken', 'new', 'job', 'security', 'advisor', 'emperor', 'Centauri', 'Republic', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Illusion', 'Truth', 'pack', 'ISN', 'reporters', 'Babylon', '5', 'incurring', 'Capt', 'Sheridan', 'wrath', 'later', 'blessing', 'Face', 'Enemy', 'Garibaldi', 'trust', 'former', 'commander', 'Capt', 'Sheridan', 'setting', 'trap', 'using', 'Sheridan', 'father', 'bait', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Babylon', '5', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '67', 'Hour', 'Wolf', 'Episode', '68', 'What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Mr', 'Garibaldi', 'Episode', '69', 'Summoning', 'Episode', '70', 'Falling', 'Towards', 'Apotheosis', 'Episode', '71', 'Long', 'Night', 'Episode', '72', 'Into', 'Fire', 'Episode', '73', 'Epiphanies', 'Episode', '74', 'Illusion', 'Truth', 'Episode', '75', 'Atonement', 'Episode', '76', 'Racing', 'Mars', 'Episode', '77', 'Lines', 'Communication', 'Episode', '78', 'Conflicts', 'Interest', 'Episode', '79', 'Rumors', 'Bargains', 'Lies', 'Episode', '80', 'Moments', 'Transition', 'Episode', '81', 'Surrender', 'No', 'Retreat', 'Episode', '82', 'Exercise', 'Vital', 'Powers', 'Episode', '83', 'Face', 'Enemy', 'Episode', '84', 'Intersections', 'Real', 'Time', 'Episode', '85', 'Darkness', 'Light', 'Episode', '86', 'Endgame', 'Episode', '87', 'Rising', 'Star', 'Episode', '88', 'Deconstruction', 'Falling', 'Stars', 'DVD', 'Report']",Babylon 5: Season 4

Captain Sheridan returns from the dead to lead the opponents of the darkness into battle. The Vorlons show their true colors, the Shadows and their role are understood and the last of the first ones travel beyond the rim, once and for all.With the end of the shadow Wars the focus is brought to the legacy the Shadows have left behind: the darkness remaining on Earth and the other worlds allied with the dark ones. In this season we see our heroes mostly dealing with liberating Earth from the evil clutches of President Clark, the Psycore and their allies. Lots of great episodes right until the end of the seasons that ends with the superb episode ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars"". In this episode, we see the story of B5 and the aftereffects of the actions of our heroes as a part of the recorded history one million years removed from our story. This is a great conclusion to the season, wanting to show how the work of few people can really effect long lasting change. JMS, the writer and creator of B5 is very hot on the personal responsibility of individuals in creating change for the many i.e. we should never feel that it is a waste of time to act even alone, to create collective change, as the actions of the few people of integrity can create lasting for all. This episode is almost a manifesto for his beliefs in this regard, as well as showing how history is fickle in its representations of events, depending on who is in charge at the time. Lots of wisdom in this last episode, that is also very moving in its very final scenes.Lots going on in this season, mostly because it seemed as if the funding for B5 was going to be cut, making this the last season. But at the last minute a venue for the last season for B5 was found, making Season 5 possible. By then however some o the actors had found other work, so this is for example the last time we get to see Ivanova...So enjoy her in this season, as she will be gone in Season 5.

There are some great (and frustrating) character developments that has the B5 command staff and the various Ambassadors split up a lot of the time performing various missions.

778577,AHEDL40TI0KB5,B0000DGBEY,C. Hoekstra,"[4, 5]","Likely the greatest of the 5 Babylon seasons, season 4 contains a majesty and scope unequaled in pretty much any other television series. Within it there is the fall and rise of empires and the demonstration of just what one person at the right place in history can do.The quality of this show continued to grow in even this season. The FX shots are of much higher quality, which pays off to no end during the many, many extended battle sequences that take place throughout the entire season. Like the rest of the series prior, these sequences are works of art, with the ships and fighters buzzing around each other in actual combat strategy, not just sitting there and trying to pummel each other. The writing is stellar once, despite Straczynski's penchant for just gobs of dialogue at certain parts, and the quirky humor and one-liners that are dropped in from time to time keep things fresh.The story, though, is where this season truly shines. All the major arcs that have been building over the previous seasons are resolved, sometimes with unexpected results. The characters all move in new directions, some further into darkness and some come into the light.While some people accuse this season of being rushed, that is not the fault of the writer, but rather Warner Brothers. JMS simply had to finish as much of the major narration as possible before WB pulled the plug at the end of the season. While this didn't happen, it wasn't known whether it would till the production of the last few episodes.As for the DVD set, all that was good about them before is back. The JMS commentaries are interesting, especially the one with Michael Vejar as that gives a technical view of how an episode was put together. The cast commentary was good, though there was very oddly a lot of instances of dead air. It seems as though the recorder stopped working at times. Also, Jerry Doyle comes off a bit obnoxious during some of the beginning. Still, very worth a listen. The data files are small, filling in only the pieces new to this season. The gag reel, however, is in plain sight on the menus this time, but it's still as funny as always.Overall I was extremely pleased with this set.

Knouse,"[3, 3]","I started watching this series beginning with season 2(by recommendation from many reviewers here) and by season 3(the best in the series, by far) I was thoroughly hooked to buy this, season 4.  With the Shadow War in full swing throughout season 3 there was bound to be a let-down in the following season.  The Shadow War overflows into season 4 and the final battle is a magnificent climax with stellar(excuse the pun) special effects but with a fairly lame resolution.  There are 22 episodes here and with nearly twenty episodes to go after the climax the next phase in the story unfolds: that of reclaiming Earth from President Clark and his Orwellian empire.  There are a few average shows leading up to the confrontation, with side-stories covering specific characters and their agendas, but when all the pieces are in place(a Queen's Gambit, to be sure) the fireworks begin and the show has renewed vigor and purpose.  I have a minor complaint regarding the dialogue.  For the most part the teleplays are sharp and seldom strained, but occasionally there is a feeble jab at humor regarding love-making or something else with similar predictability that felt forced.  There is also frequent use of modern-day slang, which I'm certain will not be as hip in the middle of the 23rd century as it was in the mid-nineties when this show was created.  Someday the dialogue in this show will definitely show its age. Then there is the occasional flashback to season 1 which was horribly written with tepid performances from some characters that make a return here; and seriously speaking, I can see why they were either replaced or their lines were cut to shorten their fairly unremarkable performances.  This series ends with a complete wrap-up of all the characters and an all-encompassing final show that had me scratching my head in lieu of the fact that there is yet another season left to be seen.  Overall, this is certainly worth obtaining for a solid continuance from season 3 and a good, oftentimes great follow-up story.

778584,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B0000DGBEY,DonAthos,"[6, 7]","Season 4 continues the quality of the previous two seasons. If you're new to Babylon 5, start with the first season (or, rather, the first movie). Now then, a topic I'm interested in: the originality, or lack there of, of Babylon 5.It's an interesting question--Does unoriginality make something inherently worse?The plotlines of Babylon 5 are not original. They are taken from other, sometimes famous, sources. But the show does not try to hide this, either. The war against the shadows is straight out of Tolkien, repleat with the shadows coming back every so often and the passing of the elder races to the Gray Havens, er, I mean, beyond the rim of the galaxy. The Menbari are clearly elves.Earth's development into a dictatorship follows Nazi progression (especially with Nightwatch) and other, similar historical sources, with a nod or two to Orwell. For instance, in the second season they speak of the development of the Ministry of Peace, which they call MiniPax, and the Ministry of Truth--straight out of 1984. The decadance of the Centauri court seems Imperial Roman, and Cartagia a veritable Caligula (is the similarity in their names coincidental?). Garibaldi's betrayal of the messianic figure of Sheridan is certainly a re-enactment of Judas Iscariot, and specifically as represented in Jesus Christ Superstar where Judas explains that Christ has started to believe his own press, and that the man has become more important than the mission. Bester's frequent farewell of ""be seeing you"" evokes The Prisoner, and again, I doubt that this is coincidental given everything else.So, does any of this matter? Does it take away from the power of Babylon 5, that its central storylines are culled directly from other sources? I don't believe that it does take anything away. Instead, it makes Babylon 5 an interesting pastiche of many of the themes and stories that interest us against a sci-fi backdrop. And it's certainly a clever idea, regardless of whether we approve or not. Further, the characters are individual enough that, despite the similarity of plot, the stories are always unique. There has never been G'Kar in any other work, if you understand my meaning.In conclusion, Babylon 5 is not weakened by its use of earlier stories and is, in some ways, strengthened by it. It fortunately does not try to hide its relationship to the sources on which it draws, making explicit references to items such as the thirty pieces of silver and the night of the long knives. And so, Babylon 5 (itself a reference no doubt to the Tower of Babel, man reaching out onto the heavens, approaching God) represents humanity and all our stories come together.

Even so, this season would have been a great way to end the entire series with the final episode of a look back into time from a million years in the future.  Instead, as if JMS was surprised that B5 was given another year the fifth and last season comes across as bereft of ideas and one is left feeling that B5 carried on one season too long.  Still, the best storylines albeit rushed and almost feeling forced out are in season 4.  We get the assassination of the Centauri Emperor and G'Kar's torture but eventual liberation of Narn, the later abrupt and lame conclusion to the Shadow war which took so long to build up and yet to end so limply, the rebellion against Earth force and the establishment of the Planetary Alliance which as mentioned earlier would have been the ideal way to end the entire B5 series.For this reason, while there is no faulting the content of the fourth season although it is overall less as good as seaon three, I do have an issue with the picture and sound quality which is poor although admittedly a lot better than for seasons 1 & 2. Even when watching this on a Blu-ray player that upscales to 1080p the improvement is slight and many imperfections like dirt, specks, white and black spots, some clear frames and many soft/blurred ones are obvious plus the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option doesn't quite make the most of the property as the sound is still pretty much coming from the front speakers.I hear that Warner may be releasing the entire series on blu-ray soon and if so I do hope they don't stinge on this and take the full time and expense to make the many, many improvements that are needed to bring this close to what one could describe as blu-ray reference quality. I thought Star Trek TOS blu-ray did an admirable job in their recent release and if that kind of blu-ray quality can be done on a 40-year old master surely we can expect a whole lot better from a much, much younger master!I wait with great anticipation to see what Warner has in store for a hopefully sci-fi blu-ray set to set the standard for the rest to follow.",4,Hope The Blu-Rays Are Better For A Brilliant Sci-Fi Series That Deserves Better!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2369,"['Coming', 'off', 'best', '5', 'seasons', 'season', '3', 'season', '4', 'across', 'rush', 'job', 'JMS', 'felt', 'convinced', 'network', 'was', 'going', 'pull', 'plug', 'whole', 'thing', 'so', 'go', 'lot', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'play', 'out', 'properly', 'Even', 'so', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'entire', 'series', 'final', 'episode', 'look', 'back', 'time', 'million', 'years', 'future', 'Instead', 'JMS', 'was', 'surprised', 'B5', 'was', 'given', 'year', 'fifth', 'last', 'season', 'across', 'bereft', 'ideas', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'B5', 'carried', 'one', 'season', 'too', 'long', 'Still', 'best', 'storylines', 'rushed', 'almost', 'feeling', 'forced', 'out', 'are', 'season', '4', 'get', 'assassination', 'Centauri', 'Emperor', ""G'Kar"", 'torture', 'eventual', 'liberation', 'Narn', 'later', 'abrupt', 'lame', 'conclusion', 'Shadow', 'war', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'build', 'up', 'yet', 'end', 'so', 'limply', 'rebellion', 'Earth', 'force', 'establishment', 'Planetary', 'Alliance', 'as', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'way', 'end', 'entire', 'B5', 'series.For', 'reason', 'faulting', 'content', 'fourth', 'season', 'overall', 'less', 'as', 'good', 'seaon', 'three', 'do', 'have', 'issue', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'poor', 'admittedly', 'lot', 'better', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'Even', 'when', 'watching', 'Blu-ray', 'player', '1080p', 'improvement', 'slight', 'many', 'imperfections', 'dirt', 'specks', 'white', 'black', 'spots', 'clear', 'frames', 'many', 'soft/blurred', 'ones', 'are', 'obvious', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'option', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'most', 'property', 'sound', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'coming', 'front', 'speakers.I', 'hear', 'Warner', 'may', 'be', 'releasing', 'entire', 'series', 'blu-ray', 'soon', 'so', 'do', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'stinge', 'take', 'full', 'time', 'expense', 'make', 'many', 'many', 'improvements', 'are', 'needed', 'bring', 'close', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'describe', 'blu-ray', 'reference', 'quality', 'thought', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TOS', 'blu-ray', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'recent', 'release', 'kind', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'done', '40-year', 'old', 'master', 'surely', 'can', 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'much', 'much', 'younger', 'master', 'wait', 'great', 'anticipation', 'see', 'what', 'Warner', 'store', 'hopefully', 'sci-fi', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'set', 'standard', 'rest', 'follow']",Babylon 5: Season 4

But, lo and behold, there's more dragged back in on that in ep. 7, Epiphanies... And ep. 9, Atonement, is a lovely look back to the past after that... But a series so strong and running at such a pace shouldn't let itself run on fumes - see the godawful ep. 8, The Illusion of Truth.Then, the Minbari have a war and Earth has a war and the series ends with a new finale - all things resolved and brilliant - the whole world nearly at peace - in Rising Star. Ahh.Then, for some reason, the series has an epilogue of variable short stories tacked on.  A coda of occasional genius (see the brothers preserving the Rangers segment) and downright stabbing pains to the senses (the faux talk show segments), ep. 22, The Deconstruction of Falling Stars, ends the series on a sublime note as humanity finally leaves the sun behind and transcends this plane of existence. Neat, that.Wham, there's more.  The fifth season remains to establish the Fall of Centauri Prime and the final destinies of the lead characters, the station, and the potential for the aborted spin-off series Crusade.  It's really a bit like ""this year gets the plot and that year gets the characters..."" only, it's not quite that way at all. This year has Marcus and Ivanova - that's a major advantage. And the fifth year does have some plot... some.But this climax season is surely still nearly just about all it needs to be to end the series. What comes to Lyta, Londo, G'Kar, Vir, and Sheridan is all fairly expected in year five.  What we get here is the completion of much of the really suspenseful part of the series.  At least two thirds of the glorious plot arcs are consummated. Wham.The 4th Season - ""No Surrender, No Retreat"" - the Climax. The first third averages 8 out of 10, the second third averages 6.5 out of 10, and the final third averages 8.5 out of 10.Enjoy Mars. Enjoy G'Kar and Londo, of course. Enjoy three, count 'em, three (!) giant, meaningful ideological wars and their resolutions.  Enjoy, finally, the tying-up (or, at least, addressing well) of just about every plot thread that you can think of from Day One of the series. Enjoy the best episodes of the series, the one-two-three punch of Exercise of Vital Powers, The Face of the Enemy, and Intersections in Real Time, a very bleak, very, very brilliant stretch of television there.Enjoy the tearful tragedy and the so sweet rejoicing of these endings.

778597,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B0000DGBEY,John Kwok,"[2, 2]","""No Surrender, No Retreat"", the fourth season of Babylon 5, is a fascinating study in contrasts between the most memorable and worst aspects of this series. It is among the most memorable since it chronicles vividly the Shadow War and Sheridan's epic struggle against President Clark's totalitarian EarthGov regime. And yet, I regret that J. Michael Straczynski wrapped up two compelling story arcs too neatly, though in fairness to him, he was under pressure from Warner Brothers, worried that his five season novel for television would not see a fifth season.The first half of the season features Sheridan's (Bruce Boxleitner) return from the dead world of Z'Ha'Dum, accompanied by the enigmatic First One Lorien (Wayne Alexander)- who has rescued Sheridan temporarily from death - and the struggle against the Shadows that concludes in the episode ""The Long Night"". Sheridan will force a momentuous confrontation between the Shadows and Vorlons. We will also see who was responsible for Garibaldi's mysterious disappearance at the end of Season Three (No, not the Shadows exactly). And we shall watch Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik) regain some of his humanity in his struggle to overthrow mad Centauri emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer), promising G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) freedom for the enslaved Narn homeworld. Vir Cotto (Stephen Furst), Londo's befuddled aide, comes to play a crucial part in Londo's conspiracy. And Delenn (Mira Furlan) must come to grips with her past history as the one who initiated the Minbari invasion of Earth Alliance terrority during the infamous Earth-Minbari war.The second half shows Sheridan gaining some unlikely allies, most notably, Psi Cop Alfred Bester (Walter Koenig) - in the episode Epiphanies - as he leads the fight against President Clark's totalitarian regime. Meanwhile Garibaldi will head to Mars as an unwitting pawn of the Psi Corps, become reacquainted with his long-lost love, and work for her husband William Edgars(Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), one of Earth's richest men. In space Sheridan and Ivanova (Claudia Christian) will lead a fleet comprised of the Rangers' White Stars, League of Non-Aligned World warships and rebel Earth Force forces against Clark's loyal Earth Force fleet in some of the most memorable space battles ever shown on television or cinema, most notably during the episodes ""No Surrender, No Retreat"" and ""Endgame"".This splendid CD collection also includes commentary from members of the cast and J. Michael Straczynski of several key episodes, an overview of some of the important supporting characters, and the Babylon 5 universe. These extra features are an improvement over those for previous Babylon 5 seasons, though they lack the impressive array of material found, for example, in Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy. And yet fans of Babylon 5 as well as those unfamiliar with this television series will not be disappointed with this fine CD collection. It offers excellent visual proof why Babylon 5 is regarded by many as the finest science fiction television series of all time.",5,Yet Another Great Season of Babylon 5,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,3077,"['Surrender', 'No', 'Retreat', 'fourth', 'season', 'Babylon', '5', 'fascinating', 'study', 'contrasts', 'most', 'memorable', 'worst', 'aspects', 'series', 'most', 'memorable', 'vividly', 'Shadow', 'War', 'Sheridan', 'epic', 'struggle', 'President', 'Clark', 'totalitarian', 'EarthGov', 'regime', 'yet', 'regret', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'wrapped', 'up', 'two', 'compelling', 'story', 'arcs', 'too', 'neatly', 'fairness', 'was', 'pressure', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'worried', 'five', 'season', 'novel', 'television', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'fifth', 'season.The', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'Sheridan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'return', 'dead', 'world', ""Z'Ha'Dum"", 'accompanied', 'enigmatic', 'First', 'One', 'Lorien', 'Wayne', 'Alexander', 'who', 'rescued', 'Sheridan', 'temporarily', 'death', 'struggle', 'Shadows', 'episode', 'Long', 'Night', 'Sheridan', 'will', 'force', 'momentuous', 'confrontation', 'Shadows', 'Vorlons', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Garibaldi', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'end', 'Season', 'Three', 'No', 'not', 'Shadows', 'exactly', 'shall', 'watch', 'Londo', 'Mollari', 'Peter', 'Jurasik', 'regain', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'overthrow', 'mad', 'Centauri', 'emperor', 'Cartagia', 'Wortham', 'Krimmer', 'promising', ""G'Kar"", 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', 'freedom', 'enslaved', 'Narn', 'homeworld', 'Vir', 'Cotto', 'Stephen', 'Furst', 'Londo', 'befuddled', 'aide', 'play', 'crucial', 'part', 'Londo', 'conspiracy', 'Delenn', 'Mira', 'Furlan', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'history', 'one', 'who', 'initiated', 'Minbari', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'Alliance', 'terrority', 'infamous', 'Earth-Minbari', 'war.The', 'second', 'half', 'shows', 'Sheridan', 'gaining', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'most', 'notably', 'Psi', 'Cop', 'Alfred', 'Bester', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'episode', 'Epiphanies', 'fight', 'President', 'Clark', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'Meanwhile', 'Garibaldi', 'will', 'head', 'Mars', 'unwitting', 'pawn', 'Psi', 'Corps', 'become', 'reacquainted', 'long-lost', 'love', 'work', 'husband', 'William', 'Edgars', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'one', 'Earth', 'richest', 'men', 'space', 'Sheridan', 'Ivanova', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'will', 'lead', 'fleet', 'comprised', 'Rangers', 'White', 'Stars', 'League', 'Non-Aligned', 'World', 'warships', 'rebel', 'Earth', 'Force', 'forces', 'Clark', 'loyal', 'Earth', 'Force', 'fleet', 'most', 'memorable', 'space', 'battles', 'ever', 'shown', 'television', 'cinema', 'most', 'notably', 'episodes', 'No', 'Surrender', 'No', 'Retreat', 'Endgame', '.This', 'splendid', 'CD', 'collection', 'also', 'commentary', 'members', 'cast', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'several', 'key', 'episodes', 'overview', 'important', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Babylon', '5', 'universe', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'improvement', 'previous', 'Babylon', '5', 'seasons', 'lack', 'impressive', 'array', 'material', 'found', 'example', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'film', 'trilogy', 'yet', 'fans', 'Babylon', '5', 'as', 'well', 'unfamiliar', 'television', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fine', 'CD', 'collection', 'excellent', 'visual', 'proof', 'why', 'Babylon', '5', 'regarded', 'many', 'finest', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'series', 'time']",Babylon 5: Season 4

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[10, 10]","The fourth season of Babylon 5 is titled &quot;No Surrender, No Retreat&quot; and boy o boy does it meet that title head on wear it proudly.  Simply put, this fourth chapter in the five chapters (seasons) that ingenious creator J.M. Straczynski wrote entirely on his own is one of the most incredible and entertaining seasons of television ever produced.  From the very beginning of the series J.M. Straczynski had been tailoring this extraordinary space &quot;opera&quot; to an ultimate conclusion through a multiple faceted series of plots, sub plots, twists and turns and all of that is paid off in immeasurable quality through this fourth season which is a collection heartrending, enlightening and ultimately supremely satisfying episodes that are, to say the least, unforgettable.This wide sweeping season imparts a great many details that are incredible in the breadth and scope of the entire series.  In past reviews for Babylon 5, I've highlight episodes that stood out among the rest.  In the case of this fourth season, I find that to be impossible as every single episode of the season is incredible; so, what follows is a synopsis of the season which I hope gives everyone a good idea of how the season goes without breaking it down into to much detail.The fourth season:At the conclusion of the third season, Sheridan had &quot;sacrificed&quot; himself in the hopes of destroying the Shadows at Z'Ha'Dum.  The fourth season leads in with Sheridan still missing which also leads into a search for Mr. Garibaldi who went missing at about the same time as Sheridan.This incredible fourth season coalesces into several universe shattering events such as; Sheridan's return from Z'Ha'Dum despite no one ever doing so before and he's brought with him &quot;a&quot; First One in Lorien; G'Kar leaves B5 to search for Mr. Garibaldi as he is his only non Narn friend which leads him to a doom &quot;and&quot; enlightenment he could never have imagined; Sheridan and Delenn organizes the League Worlds into an alliance against the Shadows; Garibaldi returns but he is not quite who he used to be; Mollari determines that Emperor Cartagia must go before Centauri Prime is wiped out as the Vorlons begin eradicating any planet that is under Shadow influence; Sheridan finds he must remove the Vorlon ambassador from B5.  The Shadow War comes to an extremely exciting battle involving Sheridan's forces which includes the League Worlds, the White Star fleet and several of the First Ones against both the Vorlons and the Shadows all ending in a somewhat melodramatic but highly intriguing conclusion to the Shadow War...  Beyond the wonderfully scripted Shadow War in this first part of the season there are the wonderfully crafted scenes in which Mollari goes to Centauri Prime and removes Emperor Cartagia, resulting in a great surprise for him but one in which he had previously envisioned.With the Shadow War now concluded, Sheridan now begins to look at the untenable situation at home with President Clark; Delenn is called home as her relationship with Sheridan is in question and in doing so she discovers a truth about Minbari racial purity that is quite telling; Garibaldi involves himself in a scheme to remove Sheridan; Franklin and  Marcus embark on a plan to assist the Mars Resistance; due to the Grey Council having been disbanded by Delenn during the Shadow War a civil war breaks out on Minbar between the religious and warrior castes resulting in an amazing scene on Minbar between Delenn and Neroon.Sheridan, no longer able to stand by and watch President Clark kill innocent civilians launches his fleet towards Earth via Proxima 3 and Mars, hoping to free those worlds of the Earth Force fleets blockading them; Garibaldi expends the ultimate betrayal upon Sheridan only to find that he wasn't exactly in his right mind in doing so; Sheridan must endure torture at the hands of Earth Force interrogators; Ivanova leads an incredible battle against Earth Force ships enhanced with Shadow technology which results in the ultimate sacrifice of two characters down the road; Garibaldi, now free of the influence he was under, leads a mission to free Sheridan.In one of the most incredible hours of episodic television ever created, &quot;Endgame&quot; brings the entire series to the ultimate moment of decisions as Sheridan's forces free Mars and head for Earth to remove President Clark.  Few series has ever created such a dramatic episode through years of setup such as this one; this episode is a true treat for the fans!  What follows in &quot;Rising Star&quot; is fairly incredible as well as Sheridan is forced to resign but he and Delenn made plans for that eventuality as well.I highly recommend not only this incredible fourth season of Babylon 5 but the preceding three and the fifth season to any and all fans of great Science Fiction that includes extraordinary writing, acting and visual eye candy.  Simply put, this is an incredible and extraordinary season and series!  {ssintrepid}Episode List:The Hour of the WolfWhatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?The SummoningFalling Toward ApotheosisThe Long NightInto the FireEpiphaniesThe Illusion of TruthAtonementRacing MarsLines of CommunicationConflicts of InterestRumors, Bargains and LiesMoments of TransitionNo Surrender, No RetreatThe Exercise of Vital PowersThe Face of the EnemyIntersections in Real TimeBetween the Darkness and the LightEndgameRising StarThe Deconstruction of Falling StarsSpecial Features:-All new digital widescreen transfers-Soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1-All new Introduction by Series Creator J.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.The only setbacks are in relation to:1) Enough with the writer's, J. Michael Straczynski's, obsession with the Germans, the Soviets and WWII; it gets tiring after the first THREE seasons!  JMS, as he himself states in The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 website, has a lot of (too much) personal issues/baggage going back to the WWII era: ""I have had a longstanding interest and familiarity with this area...and through my European roots with relatives who were in Germany and Poland when the camps were in full swing, and later when the Russian government beat down its people. I have plenty of personal background on this one.""JMS would do well to keep all these personal issues... personal (!) and to himself.  This is an outstanding sci-fi show that should not become the instrument or the means for anyone's personal agenda and not-so-hidden messages.2) In the episode ""The Exercise of Vital Powers,"" JMS trash talks Greeks through Garibaldi by stating that happiness for a Greek consists of ""3 goats and some wine.""I wonder though, why JMS doesn't make similar ""witty"" jokes about Ivanovas' faith... Hmmm... He is a self-professed atheist, but is he though?  I wonder...3) What has happened to Vir?  He is so much thinner, hyper and so much less adorable now...On the positive side:1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots keep getting better and better!2) The GREAT characters become more and more developed, and3) The wonderful feeling of being addicted to the show and wanting more!4) The music has gotten even better in this season.In conclusion, Babylon 5 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",5,1261...

778608,A3SVLMZWW2N1IB,B0000DGBEY,"Mac Olsen ""Emperor Mac Palpatine""","[3, 3]","Well, it's time for the final showdown between the Vorlons, Shawdows -- and everybody else. When I saw the fourth season on television for the first time, I felt that the story arc regarding the intergalactic armageddon was a bit of a let down. I was expecting the Vorlons and Shadows to go down in a blaze of hatred for each other, that they couldn't get past their mind sets about how the younger races of the galaxy should evolve. In addition, I expected to see that the other races, led by Sheridan and D'Lenn, would come to appreciate that the same thing would happen to them when the Vorlons and Shadows wiped each other out. This would be the basis for their peaceful co-existence, I felt. Finally, while I appreciated the second story arc in which Sheridan brings President Clark down, that story arc also felt anti-climactic -- you knew what was going to happen.However, my views definitely changed once I saw the context in which JMS was working with for the fourth season. It was definitely wiser to make Sheridan and D'Lenn offer a ""crucible"" to bring out the truth, that the Vorlons and Shadows wanted the younger races to choose which side was ""correct"" in its method of ""helping"" them to evolve. Lorien's role as a father figure also helps to make all the parties realize that war and conflict are in nobody's interest. Seeing him fly off with the Vorlons and Shadows at the end of ""Into the Fire"" gives this element of the Babylon 5 storyline a proper sense of finality.It also made sense to have Sheridan's conflict with President Clark end in the way it did. Clark is a tyrant who has to be stopped -- even if that means a civil war. Sheridan is a reluctant hero. He doesn't want to use military force that could result in the deaths of fellow officers and soldiers, not to mention the deaths of civilians. But he knows what he must do -- make sacrifices and accept the consequences for his actions. He has to do this so that humans don't have to live under a tyrant, and to be able to live in peace and prosperity with the other races. In essence, Sheridan is sacrificing himself for the sins of others, and this makes him an even more compelling character in season four.That said, the fourth season of Babylon 5 on DVD is the best yet, although I feel there are some minor flaws with the content. First of all, I think JMS's first commentary track should have been about ""Into the Fire,"" and not ""Following Toward Apotheosis."" It would have been more interesting to hear his thoughts about how the final battle between the Vorlons, Shadows and other races should have unfolded, versus what he might have originally envisioned for it.However, I did enjoy his commentary about ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars."" It was surprising to hear that there were only going to be four seasons of B5, and that this episode had to be put in place of ""Sleeping in Light,"" which was the final episode of Season 5, and of the whole series. Nonetheless, I enjoyed ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"" because of its documentary feel and that the human race would one day evolve to the level of the Vorlons.I think one of the other good episodes in Season 4 was ""The Illusion of Truth."" I don't think Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minster, could have done a better job of trashing Sheridan's reputation.I also enjoyed the story arc about D'Lenn being forced to bring the Grey Council back together for the survival of her people. I also liked her twist -- having more Worker Caste members on the council than either the Warrior or Religious Castes. ""They do not wish to conquer or convert -- only to build the future. War and religion must work in the service of the people, not the other way around."" This is as liberal-democratic as you can get, as far as I'm concerned.The other supplemental materials JMS provided for the fourth season DVD package of B5 are pretty much standard fare. I don't know if this is good or bad, but the supplemental materials in the other DVD packages are very similar to those found in the fourth season.However, if there is thing that really stands out in the fourth season DVD package, it's the audio. If you have a surround sound system, you will come to appreciate the Dolby 5.1 audio found with this package. The explosions, the engines' humming and screaming, and other sound elements really come through in my speakers. There are hints of the Dolby 5.1 audio in the other DVD sets, but they don't come close to the fourth season.All in all, the fourth season of Babylon 5 on DVD is worth every penny! While I feel that the third season of B5 is the best of all the seasons, the fourth season is comparable for the way it resolves many of the story threads that were weaved in the first three seasons.",4,B5 -

After a tremendous build-up with many great episodes leading up to a stunning and spectacular climax during which the Earth Alliance manages to win the Shadow War in an episode that has probably the best space battle of all time, the series takes a distinct turn for the worst, getting bogged down in several implausible and very weak episodes. I suppose it would be well nigh impossible to match the incredible climactic episode, but to cite one example, captain Sheridan, who even the elusive and mysterious Shadows can't fool for very long, is deceived by a sneaky Earth reporter. I just didn't find that credible considering how smart and cagey Sheridan is.Another big disappointment is the Vorlons, who, after being at least somewhat benign, or at least, not malevolent toward humans and other races up till then, basically go completely wacko and become just as destructive as the Shadows in a way that wasn't very plausible either. There are other problems I could go into, but others have already commented on those.All that aside, however, this is still possibly the greatest TV sci-fi series yet, so don't let a few bad episodes sour you on the series.

778611,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0000DGBEY,Mark Baker,"[41, 41]","Things are looking dark for our heroes.  As this year opens, Garibaldi is missing and Sheridan is missing, presumed dead.  Even though they are both alive (as we learn from the opening credits), things are dark.  The Vorlons and the Shadows are no longer hiding behind allies and have launched a full scale war, using the younger races as the targets.  Can Sheridan use what he's learned to bring a peaceful end to the fighting?  Plus there's the situation on Earth with dictator President Clark.  Throw in Garibaldi's weird behavior and you've got a full season that catches your interest and never lets go.Since JMS didn't know for sure if he'd actually get season 5, he worked hard to bring major plot threads together in season 4.  As a result, this year is packed with action and story, but there are some wonderful character arcs as well.  I've always found Garibaldi's to be the most interesting of the season, but Vir gets some great moments early on as well.  Londo and G'Kar's relationship also takes some unexpected turns that are wonderful.  I love watching that duo at work.Frankly, this season will always hold a special place in my heart because it's when I started watching.  Hard for me to believe now, but my first episode was ""Into the Fire.""  If it weren't for some very patient friends, I would have been lost, but I managed to stick in there, getting so hooked on the Earth plot that I couldn't stop watching.  Later, when I'd seen the rest of the show, I realized exactly what I had missed in way of back story.  Naturally, I don't recommend starting here.  The way JMS is able to bring plot threads together is truly amazing this season and worth every hour spent watching the first three seasons for the payoff (not that that's a chore by any stretch of the imagination.)  Still, I'll always have fond memories of waiting impatiently each week to see what happens next and the long wait over the summer to see how they'd resolve the mid season cliffhanger.This DVD set is in perfect keeping with the others that have come out.  Picture quality is mostly good with the occasional grain or spot.  A tad distracting, but overall sharper then my video tapes.  Sound is wonderful in full surround.  Again we get three commentaries.  The cast commentary, featuring Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Peter Jurasik, and Patricia Tallman is entertaining if not very informative.  (I'll never look at Jerry's head the same way again, however.)  JMS does his usual two commentaries.  He's joined by director Michael Vejar on ""Face of the Enemy"" for a fascinating look at creating that pivotal episode.  And he does his usual interesting look at ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars,"" the unusual fourth season finale.  The special features are rounded out by an introduction on disc 1, a new documentary on the music of the show, a new suite of music set against visuals from the season, the usual data and personnel files, and finally a gag reel.

Season 4 is a combination of two seasons in one. J. Michael Straczynski did not know from Warner Brothers if there was going they were going to pick up season five. It was not till the end of season four. Season four was going to be the Shadow War and season five was going to be the Earth Civil War; so in season four you get the combination of two wars. In my opinion season four seemed the most rush season of them all; if you missed an episode then you might be lost. Also I felt there were more drama and less comedy this time around. Don't get me wrong some episodes did contain few laughs. Mainly am going to express my thoughts on what I did and did not like. What I did not like was the combination of two seasons in one, if just did not flow with me. Also what I hated was the Falling Toward Apotheosis Commentary by Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Peter Jurasik, and Patricia Tallman. To me it was basically four people shooting the breeze and not even commenting on the episode. At on point Peter Jurasik tries to explain what apotheosis is and everybody around him jumps in and interrupts him. Also there were long pauses between the four and you would hear the episode. What I did like was the Face of the Enemy Commentary by J. Michael Straczynski and Director Michael Vejar; that got more into the details of making that episode. Also for the first time the Special Features came with Celestial Sounds extra, a No Surrender, No Retreat Suite. Basically you shrink sixteen hours into six minutes, and for the first time a Gag Reel. Overall I feel that season four could have been better, but don't forget that J. Michael Straczynski did not know if there was going to be a fifth season. Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season gets an A-.DVD FEATURESDisc 12 Hours and 54 minutesPlayEpisodes1.

Everyone has a purpose- B5 took the unpresedented step in making both The Vorlons and Shadows as bad as each other, I can't remember a Sci-fi or any sci-fi TV show ever doing this!!!2. The Sheridan interrigation episode. Obviously influenced by the Cardassian interigation of Picard from STTNG, this though is even more vicious, definitely not for the soft hearted!!!3. Delenn & Sheridan- Has there ever been a greater Sci-fi couple!!!!!4. Garabaldi- just brilliant his change in behaviour and betrayal of Sheridan, it was shocking, yet brilliant!!!5. Bester- He is a bad man after all6. Minbari civil war- Even the purist aren't perfect7. G'Kar & Londo- Suprise, suprise, brilliant again, is it me or are they starting to like each other (no it can't be...)8. Ivoniva & Marcus- Perhaps the most tragic thing ever!!!!9.

What more can one want in a television series??Ok, so there's the comment that the Shadow War ends anti-climatically. But that's what happens with a war of ideology. It cannot be won with wars or force, and warring over ideas can seem sometimes trivial from the outside. How does one solve the who is right argument?What makes up for the lack of fighting is the Earth ""civil"" war and the Minbari Civil wars. Wars galore!, each with a purpose and meaning.The ""what happened to Mr Garibaldi"" question was answered frustratingly slowly, and the resolution didn't get enough resolution for me. We don't have to see how Sheridan came to trust Garibaldi again, but it would have been nice to get a little more closure on that subject. After all Garibaldi did, Sheridan couldn't just trust him, could he? Or maybe he could, and that's a telling characteristic of Sheridan, and a brilliant piece of unspoken writing by JMS.No flat characters here! Thanks to JMS and his dynamic writing, the characters of B5 twist and turn and show different sides to the audience with every new season, and every show within that season!The CGI has improved, despite their tight budgets, and the show was supposed to end this season! What a way to go out, had it done so! Luckily, we still get one more season! The actors are deeply rooted in their characters and it shows!, the story line is top-notch and engaging throughout, and everything is actually *happy* by the end of this season! A thoughtful and exciting show. Very satisfying at the end.Sadly, the end of the next, 5th and final season never gets closure, and the under-rated, under-funded ""Crusade"" never got off the ground. Pity. It needed proper treatment and respect and still does! I'm still hoping that someone somewhere will realise what a LOSS this story is uncompleted, and will fund it and treat it right.

There are probably more dust specks and garbage on the few episodes I've watched than in all three previous sets combined. And the DVD compression hasn't improved any -- artifacts all over the place, with some live action scenes practically shimmering on my high-end home theater system.

Too bad they're producing these sets as cheaply as possible, with no additional funding for cleaning up the transfers. Recently I witnessed the processing of transferring a network hourlong drama onto DVD, and it was amazing to see the operator clean up video artifacts on the fly -- erasing them just like Photoshop. Sure, it adds to the bottom line, but I think Warner Bros. can handle it. Reportedly they're making so much money off these boxed sets they're gonna OK a new B5 project in 2004, simply because it'll turn a profit off the subsequent DVD sales alone.Warner Bros., you've got us in the palm of your hand.

778625,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000DGBEY,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","My favorite season of BABYLON 5 is Season Three, where the war against the shadows dominates.  Season Four focuses more on the war to unseat President Bush . . . uh, I mean Clark, who has made a mockery of civil liberties, engaged in a propagandistic war of redefining such concepts of loyalty and treachery, and pretty much brought about the kind of world that many believe our current president probably fantasizes about.  Indeed, B5 boards are full of threads about the prescience of B5 in not only reading the nature of the far right in the US in the nineties, but anticipating the nature of their ascendance to power in the first decade of the new century.  From its very beginning B5 was an intensely political show.  If it was slightly less topical than BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, it nonetheless was far more specifically critical of trends in American politics.  If BSG's main purpose is to make the current political situation less black and white but considerably grayer, B5 is out to condemn certain trends in our political situation.  I will hasten to add, however, that apart from President Clark, who is an almost pure embodiment of the fondest hopes and desires of many in the far right of today  (if you read the writings of many of the Dominionists, who have had considerable influence on many leaders in the GOP -- including James Dobson, Mike Huckabee, and Pat Robertson -- they insist on using the power of government to enforce ideological agreement).For a number of reasons, however, I didn't find Season Four as compelling as Season Three.  A good deal of that lies in arc that involves Garibaldi becoming a sleeper agent for the Psy Corps.  At no point did this seem quite right.  Nonetheless, overall this is a very fascinating season.  Looking at BABYLON 5 as a whole, I have a number of beefs with it.  I detest the look of the aliens, especially Londo's utterly ludicrous hairstyle, which is only slightly more appalling than his accent.  If I eventually got used to it, I never came to like either Londo's look or voice.  Nor, really, the look of any of the aliens on the show.  I also had trouble imagining a human falling in love with a half-alien with a gigantic bony protuberance encircling her head.  But the show also did a number of things that I very much liked.  Let me enumerate those.First, B5 is not afraid to shake things up.  Although I am suspicious of the claim that creator J. Michael Straczynski had all five seasons meticulously planned out as many claim (if he had, the series would have peaked in Season Five, not Season Three, nor would the final two seasons be somewhat anticlimactic to the Third), there definitely is a lot of forethought put into the stories that Straczynski wants to tell.  The best was the Shadow War, but there were also thrown out there the story of a totalitarian right-wing Earth president and the problem of what to do with the telepaths.  All these elements were put out there in Season One and gradually resolved in the subsequent four seasons.  But along the way Straczynski showed a willingness to shake up the cast.  There are very few characters who started off in the TV movie that began B5 who are there at the very end.  Even some major characters are either gained or lost along the way, trading Sheridan for Sinclair after Season Two, keeping Marcus Cole for only two seasons, and loving Ivanova after the fourth.  I like shows that show no fear in changing everything around from time to time.  More shows need to try this.So, all in all, another good season for B5.  In fact, Seasons 3 and 4 combined are easily the highpoint of the series.  Season 5 would be a bit of a let down both in terms of story and in cast, as many characters either leave entirely or play a more subdued role.",4,Another strong season,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3771,"['favorite', 'season', 'BABYLON', '5', 'Season', 'Three', 'where', 'war', 'shadows', 'dominates', 'Season', 'Four', 'more', 'war', 'unseat', 'President', 'Bush', 'uh', 'mean', 'Clark', 'who', 'made', 'mockery', 'civil', 'liberties', 'engaged', 'propagandistic', 'war', 'redefining', 'such', 'concepts', 'loyalty', 'treachery', 'pretty', 'much', 'brought', 'kind', 'world', 'many', 'believe', 'current', 'president', 'probably', 'Indeed', 'B5', 'boards', 'are', 'full', 'threads', 'prescience', 'B5', 'not', 'only', 'reading', 'nature', 'far', 'right', 'US', 'nineties', 'anticipating', 'nature', 'ascendance', 'power', 'first', 'decade', 'new', 'century', 'very', 'beginning', 'B5', 'was', 'intensely', 'political', 'show', 'was', 'slightly', 'less', 'topical', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'specifically', 'critical', 'trends', 'American', 'politics', 'BSG', 'main', 'purpose', 'make', 'current', 'political', 'situation', 'black', 'white', 'considerably', 'grayer', 'B5', 'out', 'condemn', 'certain', 'trends', 'political', 'situation', 'will', 'hasten', 'add', 'however', 'apart', 'President', 'Clark', 'who', 'almost', 'pure', 'embodiment', 'fondest', 'hopes', 'desires', 'many', 'far', 'right', 'today', 'read', 'writings', 'many', 'Dominionists', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'considerable', 'influence', 'many', 'leaders', 'GOP', 'including', 'James', 'Dobson', 'Mike', 'Huckabee', 'Pat', 'Robertson', 'insist', 'using', 'power', 'government', 'enforce', 'ideological', 'agreement', 'number', 'reasons', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Season', 'Four', 'as', 'compelling', 'Season', 'Three', 'good', 'deal', 'arc', 'Garibaldi', 'becoming', 'sleeper', 'agent', 'Psy', 'Corps', 'point', 'did', 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'Nonetheless', 'overall', 'very', 'fascinating', 'season', 'Looking', 'BABYLON', '5', 'whole', 'have', 'number', 'beefs', 'detest', 'look', 'aliens', 'especially', 'Londo', 'utterly', 'ludicrous', 'hairstyle', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'appalling', 'accent', 'eventually', 'got', 'used', 'never', 'came', 'Londo', 'look', 'voice', 'really', 'look', 'aliens', 'show', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'imagining', 'human', 'falling', 'love', 'half-alien', 'gigantic', 'bony', 'protuberance', 'encircling', 'head', 'show', 'also', 'did', 'number', 'things', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'Let', 'enumerate', 'those.First', 'B5', 'not', 'afraid', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'am', 'suspicious', 'claim', 'creator', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'had', 'five', 'seasons', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'out', 'many', 'claim', 'had', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'peaked', 'Season', 'Five', 'not', 'Season', 'Three', 'would', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'be', 'somewhat', 'anticlimactic', 'Third', 'definitely', 'lot', 'forethought', 'put', 'stories', 'Straczynski', 'tell', 'best', 'was', 'Shadow', 'War', 'were', 'also', 'thrown', 'out', 'there', 'story', 'totalitarian', 'right-wing', 'Earth', 'president', 'problem', 'what', 'do', 'telepaths', 'elements', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'Season', 'One', 'gradually', 'resolved', 'subsequent', 'four', 'seasons', 'way', 'Straczynski', 'showed', 'willingness', 'shake', 'up', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'started', 'off', 'TV', 'movie', 'began', 'B5', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'very', 'end', 'Even', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'gained', 'lost', 'way', 'trading', 'Sheridan', 'Sinclair', 'Season', 'Two', 'keeping', 'Marcus', 'Cole', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'loving', 'Ivanova', 'fourth', 'like', 'shows', 'show', 'fear', 'changing', 'everything', 'time', 'time', 'More', 'shows', 'need', 'try', 'this.So', 'good', 'season', 'B5', 'fact', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'combined', 'are', 'easily', 'highpoint', 'series', 'Season', '5', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'terms', 'story', 'cast', 'many', 'characters', 'leave', 'entirely', 'play', 'more', 'subdued', 'role']",Babylon 5: Season 4

I just bought a new HDTV and was looking forward to watching this series filling that nice large screen in a proper 16:9 aspect ratio. As everyone probably knows, all the DVDs in this series suffer from some quality issues due to the way the CGI shots were originally done. This was noticeable in previous season releases as well as this one. So I was prepared for this when I popped the first disc in. But I wasn't prepared for the extreme amounts of grain in the video. When watching this on my old 32"" Trinitron TV, the video looked fine. But on my new 46"" HDTV, it looks really, really awful. All the flaws are laid bare on a large HDTV screen. At first, I thought it was an issue with my TV. But all my other DVDs look fantastic. So I tweaked the settings as much as I could, but it didn't really help much. Then for comparison purposes, I popped in a disc from Season 1. There is some noticeable grain there, too, but it's still quite watchable and it even gives it a nice film-like quality which is kind of pleasing. I also tried the movie ""A Call to Arms"" from the Babylon 5 movie collection set. It looks pretty good, too. But on the Season 4 set, and on ""Thirdspace"" from the movie set, the grain is seriously distracting and looks just plain bad. It has unfortunately ruined my enjoyment of this very good season. From what I've read, this seems to be a problem with the source and not with the DVD transfers themselves, so I don't know if this will ever be correctable. And like I said, it looks fine on a regular TV. But I just wanted to give a warning to anyone who plans to watch this on an HDTV someday.

778627,A24HM3XDFVHXIK,B0000DGBEY,"S_McCrea ""s_mccrea""","[10, 10]","I too was no big fan of season one, after a couple of episodes when it debuted, I tuned out; it was too derivative of Star Trek and Straczynski had yet to find B5's unique and astounding voice.Season Four is a stunner, bringing two wars to conclusion, raising heros from the dead, a wicked conclusion to Bester's most fiendish plot (in his defense, he was fighting for his freedom and his life).  As always, ""The Demolished Man"" joke is a great one--and if you don't get it, you need to learn a LOT more about sf!Once again, the writing is amazing, the direction tight, the CG splendid--the explosions finally stop looking like bad video games from 1985--and the acting, well, the ""torture"" ep--that's all I'll say--should have one a certain actor an Emmy.  But...we know he didn't.  I'm afraid the same fate awaits Peter Jackson, et al, on Feb 29th.This season also contains my fav ep of all time, ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars.""  Another ep that deserved an Emmy.  I can't say enough in it's praise. B5 can no longer be labelled at ST's ... little brother: it's an equal in every sense.The cast commentary is hilarious.  You can tell that these are people (Boxleitner, Christian, Tallman, etc) who genuinely like each other and the camraderie and friendship is still there, six years after it all ended.  Straz's three ep commentaries are interesting, but I wish that one of the actors or ep directors could have been present to discuss the eps; Staz's voice, contrary to his pen, can be monotone and a little somnolent, but, once fully awake, what he says IS interesting.This review of the serious still says everything that I feel needs to be said.  It goes straight to the heart of the B5 series and the real core.Eh, voila...J. Michael Straczynski and Robert B. Parker (of Spenser fame) have both achieved the same thing with very different subject matters and in very different media: they have made the moral choices of their characters the primary, indeed, almost the SOLE focus of the action. Straczynski's task is probably that much the harder because, unlike the novel, he can only graphically illustrate his characters' inner worlds. The result is triumph; presenting something so rare on TV: real people.Yes, as in the Parker novels, there is plenty of violence. Also there is no downplaying certain characters' relish of the test of battle and their love of soldiering. Straczynski has a real respect for the military and does not let his correct skepticism of government (even if does repeat the McCarthy myth on a commentary track) spill over into disrespect for those who put their bodies where ""the metal hit the meat."" His use spectacular special effects only enhances.The ground breaking CG had one real drawback: B-5 explosions simply don't look real. I guess they just didn't have the processor power to simulate them on their budget. Even now fire is said to be impossible to model and thus its creation is more the work of artist than artisan-something the insane schedule of network drama simply doesn't allow.Both series place characters--whatever the literary allusion--in situation where they have choose between expedience and principle. Straczynski does a superb job of dropping his characters--ones obviously very beloved to him--into horrible situation in which they die or undergo the most dreadful pain and loss. Then there are those, like Mr. Morden, Mr. Bester nice ""Demolish Man"" joke), and ""President"" Clark who clearly took the road of expedience. Straczynski shows, graphically, the very real consequences of their actions not only for themselves but for billions of other humans and aliens.The main theme was taken from an old Poul Anderson novel whose name eludes me. He pictured a war between vastly powerful species whose mere existence was outside human comprehension but who used humans and others as proxies in their never ending struggle. Redux the Shadows and Vorlons--who turn out to be as amoral as the Shadows when crossed.As with the Spenser novels, Babylon 5 rises far above genre to achieve what is so utterly rare in any historical era: art. They both show us the recesses of the heart, the secret places we hide from everyone else. We are also shown the devastating consequences of moral failure or necessity. In a hundred years B-5 will still resonate in a way my beloved Star Trek never can. Star Trek, you see, is fantasy, the way the world ought to be. Babylon 5, unfortunately, is the way the future WILL be.",5,The Primacy of the Moral,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,4474,"['too', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'season', 'one', 'couple', 'episodes', 'when', 'debuted', 'tuned', 'out', 'was', 'too', 'derivative', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Straczynski', 'had', 'yet', 'find', 'B5', 'unique', 'astounding', 'voice.Season', 'Four', 'stunner', 'bringing', 'two', 'wars', 'conclusion', 'raising', 'heros', 'dead', 'wicked', 'conclusion', 'Bester', 'most', 'fiendish', 'plot', 'defense', 'was', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'life', 'always', 'Demolished', 'Man', 'joke', 'great', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'need', 'learn', 'LOT', 'more', 'sf', 'Once', 'again', 'writing', 'amazing', 'direction', 'tight', 'CG', 'splendid', 'explosions', 'finally', 'stop', 'looking', 'bad', 'video', 'games', '1985', 'acting', 'well', 'torture', 'ep', ""'ll"", 'say', 'should', 'have', 'one', 'certain', 'actor', 'Emmy', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'afraid', 'same', 'fate', 'awaits', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'et', 'al', 'Feb', '29th.This', 'season', 'also', 'fav', 'ep', 'time', 'Deconstruction', 'Falling', 'Stars', 'ep', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'praise', 'B5', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'labelled', 'ST', 'little', 'brother', 'equal', 'sense.The', 'cast', 'commentary', 'hilarious', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'people', 'Boxleitner', 'Christian', 'Tallman', 'etc', 'who', 'genuinely', 'other', 'camraderie', 'friendship', 'still', 'there', 'six', 'years', 'ended', 'Straz', 'three', 'ep', 'commentaries', 'are', 'interesting', 'wish', 'one', 'actors', 'ep', 'directors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'discuss', 'eps', 'Staz', 'voice', 'contrary', 'pen', 'can', 'be', 'monotone', 'little', 'somnolent', 'once', 'fully', 'awake', 'what', 'IS', 'interesting.This', 'review', 'serious', 'still', 'everything', 'feel', 'needs', 'be', 'said', 'straight', 'heart', 'B5', 'series', 'real', 'core.Eh', 'voila', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'Spenser', 'fame', 'have', 'achieved', 'same', 'thing', 'very', 'different', 'subject', 'matters', 'very', 'different', 'media', 'have', 'made', 'moral', 'choices', 'characters', 'primary', 'indeed', 'almost', 'SOLE', 'focus', 'action', 'Straczynski', 'task', 'probably', 'that', 'much', 'harder', 'novel', 'can', 'only', 'graphically', 'illustrate', 'characters', 'inner', 'worlds', 'result', 'triumph', 'presenting', 'something', 'so', 'rare', 'TV', 'real', 'people.Yes', 'Parker', 'novels', 'plenty', 'violence', 'Also', 'downplaying', 'certain', 'characters', 'relish', 'test', 'battle', 'love', 'soldiering', 'Straczynski', 'real', 'respect', 'military', 'not', 'let', 'correct', 'skepticism', 'government', 'even', 'repeat', 'McCarthy', 'myth', 'commentary', 'track', 'spill', 'disrespect', 'who', 'put', 'bodies', 'where', 'metal', 'hit', 'meat', 'use', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'only', 'enhances.The', 'ground', 'breaking', 'CG', 'had', 'one', 'real', 'drawback', 'B-5', 'explosions', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'guess', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'processor', 'power', 'simulate', 'budget', 'Even', 'now', 'fire', 'said', 'be', 'impossible', 'model', 'thus', 'creation', 'more', 'work', 'artist', 'artisan-something', 'insane', 'schedule', 'network', 'drama', 'simply', ""n't"", 'allow.Both', 'series', 'place', 'characters', 'literary', 'allusion', 'situation', 'where', 'have', 'choose', 'expedience', 'principle', 'Straczynski', 'superb', 'job', 'dropping', 'characters', 'ones', 'obviously', 'very', 'beloved', 'horrible', 'situation', 'die', 'undergo', 'most', 'dreadful', 'pain', 'loss', 'Then', 'are', 'Mr.', 'Morden', 'Mr.', 'Bester', 'nice', 'Demolish', 'Man', 'joke', 'President', 'Clark', 'who', 'clearly', 'took', 'road', 'expedience', 'Straczynski', 'graphically', 'very', 'real', 'consequences', 'actions', 'not', 'only', 'billions', 'other', 'humans', 'aliens.The', 'main', 'theme', 'was', 'taken', 'old', 'Poul', 'Anderson', 'novel', 'name', 'pictured', 'war', 'vastly', 'powerful', 'species', 'mere', 'existence', 'was', 'outside', 'human', 'comprehension', 'who', 'used', 'humans', 'others', 'proxies', 'never', 'ending', 'struggle', 'Redux', 'Shadows', 'Vorlons', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'amoral', 'Shadows', 'when', 'crossed.As', 'Spenser', 'novels', 'Babylon', '5', 'rises', 'far', 'genre', 'achieve', 'what', 'so', 'utterly', 'rare', 'historical', 'era', 'art', 'show', 'recesses', 'heart', 'secret', 'places', 'hide', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'moral', 'failure', 'necessity', 'hundred', 'years', 'B-5', 'will', 'still', 'resonate', 'way', 'beloved', 'Star', 'Trek', 'never', 'can', 'Star', 'Trek', 'see', 'fantasy', 'way', 'world', 'ought', 'be', 'Babylon', '5', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'future', 'WILL', 'be']",Babylon 5: Season 4

The acting is the best, the special effects and makeup are excellent (especially in light of the small budget of the show), and the overall storyline is excellent. That overall storyline was greatly influenced by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, which I noticed more and more after the first season, but I'm a writer who has published a lot of Lovecraftian tales; the viewer isn't required to know anything about Lovecraft to follow this series. One of the later full-length films is blatantly a take-off on Lovecraft's &#34;Call of Cthulhu&#34;, only it is set in space.Some episodes fall short of the typical level of script quality, but generally the episodes are darn good and then some.Trekies don't seem to take to this series, but I think it is great.

778632,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B0000DGBEY,Veil_Lord,"[0, 0]","A friend of mine put it well, Babylon 5 was like a book.  The first was the setup, second the entry of the primary villain, the third the filler (not in a bad way), the 4th the climax, and the 5th the epilogue.  The end to the Shadow War was a little lame as was the human war, but still, this is some grade A television.  I own seasons 2-4 and there are only a few lame episodes in out of the 66.  It's really a great series.This season is the culmination of a 4 season build up to a massive war against the forces of evil, the Shadows.  This group of aliens hibernates for a millennium before spreading out across the galaxy and causing destruction and chaos.  There theory is that a trial by fire will improve the other races of the galaxy.  The Vorlons, their counterparts believe more in traditional guiding of other races, though aren't above tampering with their DNA.  Despite this epic struggle, the season ultimately boils down to the people of Babylon 5 freeing earth from the evil that has taken hold there, because of the Shadows.What was so disappointing was that the final battle was all punches being pulled.  It wasn't a major military battle, ship vs ship.  The leader decides not to make it look like an alien invasion, so he gives up most of his ships and only uses human ones.  To even this out and avoid the uncomfortable killing people thing, the authors wuss out and give the Bab 5 people a secret weapon that just disables many of the Earth ships.  Then the actual battle ends up being vs automated defense platforms.  It was just a real let down after all that buildup.Still, despite it's issues, this is a really good season and a really good series overall.

778633,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000DGBEY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 4]","Science fiction is the only place where you'll find an avowed atheist like Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Strazynski exploring life after death. That's the nice thing about fiction you can dive into things, stir things up and see what happens. Season 4 of B5 begins with an ending. Our main character John Sheridan is dead having died on the enemy world of Z'Ha'Dum. If there's any doubt, we're reminded by a glimpse of the jump Sheridan made when he had his ship the White Star crash into the city of the damned. Sheridan jumped off a balcony of a building into the jaws of a pit two miles deep. That's about as dead as it gets. So clearly resurrection is the only option for Strazynsky and, not surprisingly, Sheridan does the only other known resurrection since Christ. All isn't as it appears, though and if B5 referenced a popular religious figure, it wasn't in an attempt to convert others to the cause against the Shadows. Sheridan destroyed Z'Ha'Dum, killed a large amount of human Shadow collaborators (including his wife Anna Sheridan but...well she wasn't his wife any longer but something else entirely). So if the Shadow War appears to end a bit prematurely forgive JMS; he got the feeling that B5 might not be renewed and, unlike some series creators, he wanted to conclude his epic even if it was premature. Strazynski brings his savior back to the nasty war being fought against the evil Shadows. He manages to reunite a splintering alliance and convert those characters still sitting on the fence about the war itself.That meant that season 5 acted more as an extended coda for the war demonstrating the aftermath. Unfortunately, the dramatic conflict of a war is difficult to compete against and season 5 also had 4 previous well received seasons to work against. Nevertheless, season 5 is worth picking up for a number of outstanding episodes as well.The highlights are many during season 4 which is probably the best season for the show. Highlights include &quot;The Big Burn&quot;, &quot;No Surrender, No Retreat&quot; in which Sheridan takes on the corrupt Earth government which is continued in the arc episode &quot;Rising Star&quot; and &quot;The Deconstruction of Falling Stars&quot;. The entire cast continued to give strong performances during season 4.I hate to say it but the transfer here actually looks worse in spots than during season 3. There's numerous digital artifacts, edge enhancement and the grainy, dark images only highlight the weaknesses of this transfer. The opening episode is among the worst with lots of grain problems evident in just about every scene. The image quality improves periodically throughout the disc. So expect variable image quality. At its best, B4 looks very good, at its worst, it's problematic.On the plus side, the analog artifacts have been reduced but it's not much of a trade off. It's a pity as it's unlikely that Warner will do another transfer of the series in the immediate future.  Reportedly, the discs were mastered from new widescreen transfers (remember, it's not anamorphic. Anamorphic refers to the use of a lens to distort and stretch the picture. Widescreen essentially means that it's been matted).The optical effects vary in quality. In some scenes they look stunning while in others they are fuzzy looking. This is particularly noticeable in scenes where there's live action integrated with effects shots. I'm not really clear if this is due more to the higher frames per second &quot;speed&quot; for television or what was considered acceptable resolution when the series was produced. I had hoped that Warner Home Video might have solved this problem but I'm sure they probably had fairly tight budgets for revamping the series for DVD. No doubt sacrifices had to be made and it appears improving the resolution and sharpness of the opticals was one of them. It's not a huge distraction just a bit annoying at times.The sound varies from fair to exceptional. I noticed a considerable amount of compression  during some episodes which made the dialog difficult to hear particularly if you listen to it in Surround Stereo. The remix is flat and static sounding dominant feature is dialogue. The sound quality varies from episode to episode with a lack of regularity.The extras are just as nice as the previous boxed sets We're  treated to the season ending gag reel. I wish more boxed sets had these. It gives the viewer an inside peak into the fun and games that occur during the production of a series. We also get Data and Personal Files similar to previous seasons. They provide a bit of background on the characters and situations in the series.There's two episodes with commentary tracks provided by series creator J. Michael Strazynski and one with most of the regular cast. The former commentaries are interesting but be warned that Strazynski mentions a number of spoilers on future episodes and the fifth season. The cast clearly are having a ball ribbing each other and their fun is infectious. I'd recommend watching the episodes without commentary the first time (particularly the ones with Strazynski commenting). Curiously, there's never been an episode with commentary by the effects supervisors or directors. It would have been interesting to hear about the creation of the optical effects and how an episodic director approaches an individual episode of a series.Hidden inside this nicely packaged set is one of B5's finest seasons. The image and sound quality varies from very dicey to good. I'm a bit surprised given the fact that these are new digital transfers that the picture quality wasn't cleaned up a bit more. While there's less analog artifacts, the digital artifacts dominate much of the set. The sound quality varies from muddy and flat to very good. I'm curious if there were alternate scenes shot for European and Asian markets. If so, it might have been interesting to include these.The B5 extras have always been excellent despite the budget limitations that exist at putting together these DVD sets. I would have liked to see more features on optical effects and compositing. The commentaries by Strazynski and the cast are enlightening and fun.",5,B5 at its best although with some transfer issues,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,6167,"['Science', 'fiction', 'only', 'place',
