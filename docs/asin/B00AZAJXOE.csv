1618581,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AZAJXOE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[50, 54]","There is a refreshingly open and adult perspective about sex presented in the new lightweight Czech comedy ""4Some.""  Let me translate that: many people are going to hate Jan Hrebejk's look at unconventional relationships.  The movie suggests that friends can embark on an unorthodox sexual adventure that defies conventional norms AND not be ruined or punished for the event.  Wow!  What a suggestion, a shocking notion that we are free to make our own decisions as long as we're not hurting anyone else.  Of course, the opponents of sexual liberation will say this movie subverts decent living and the institution of family.  I say that it redefines family and live and let live.  I won't contend that ""4Some"" (also released as Holy Foursome and The Holy Quarternity) is the best film you'll see this year.  It's not.  But if you don't mind a candid comedy about the reawakening of middle-aged sexual desires, the movie feels strikingly differentI would try to be purposefully vague about the film's plotting, but the movie's biggest story revelations are spilled just about everywhere (including the DVD art and description, if you can't decipher the title itself).  The film depicts two close knit families.  The couples at the heart of ""4Some"" have reached a level of apathy or disinterest in their sexual dealings with their respective partners.  Instead, their teenaged children are at the age where they are starting to pair off (another component sure to upset the morality police).  The men take a job on a desolate Caribbean island for a few weeks and the wives accompany them.  What follows is an exploration of both friendship and love between all four.  For a movie filled with sex and nudity, there is a surprisingly gentle heart at the center of the film.That's really all I'll say.  ""4Some,"" in truth, is a bit light on plot.  The film is relative short at 79 minutes and plays as a breezy romp that still maintains its sweetness.  I credit the likable cast for keeping things grounded and, dare I say, believable.  But as much as the screenplay comments about marriage and sex, it is equally invested in friendship.  My favorite pairings in the movie are these friendships.  The men (Gregor Buaer and Vaclav Marhold) develop a terrifically funny bond and occasional rivalry.  But at heart, they truly love one another.  The same can be said for their wives (Jenovea Bokova and Valerie Samalova).  I genuinely liked the characters depicted in the film, and that made the journey worth taking.  In the end, it might all come across as too lightweight for some and too offensive for others.  But as the holiday getaway shown, the movie makes a nice break from the norm.

1618582,A3GXKR7NM0P0K4,B00AZAJXOE,Lottatime,"[5, 8]","A pleasant little film centered around a rather unlikely and improbable arrangement between friends. It never digs deeply enough to be troubling or challenging and that is why it is enjoyable. It could have ventured into the heavier aspects of morality, ethics and the inevitable burden of consequences that would likely occur as a result of their choices. The characters were defined and individually distinct enough to make the plot seem plausible based on who these people are. The notion that grown up, functional, responsible people could successfully break their day to day  drudgery with an unorthodox combination of partner swapping and child rearing is easy to discount as mere fantasy. Yet, it is presented in such a lighthearted and clever way as to make it worth buying into. The scenes of the men having to deal with one another in ways they had not envisioned were amusing. The sexuality displayed demonstrated an awkwardness and heavy handedness that seemed authentic owing to the fact that being friends does not by definition equate to being lovers.The story moves along without ever really questioning any of their motives or desires and concludes that, in the end, women rule. Which is exactly how it should be.My wife and I enjoyed it because we see nothing wrong with embracing a fantasy. Watching a movie about fantasy makes for comedy. Embracing such a fantasy creates drama, and often tragedy.fyi  This movie is obviously about sex and sexual exploration outside of the boundaries of societal norms.
