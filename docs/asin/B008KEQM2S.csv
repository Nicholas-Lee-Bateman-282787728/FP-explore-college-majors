1569080,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B008KEQM2S,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[28, 29]","The first episode of Kidnap and Ransom was released in early 2011.  It  was so good that we suspected that we may be seeing more before very long.  Trevor Eve, who many viewers will remember from his role as DS Boyd in Cold Case, plays the part of Dominic King who works for insurance companies as an international hostage negotiator. The series starts off dramatically with King paying over a ransom, but receiving a corpse back rather than the hostage and this shocking event weighs heavily on him subsequently.  The main story concerns a kidnap in South Africa which proves to be very complex and had viewers on the edge of their seats as they had to wait until the following week for the next episode on TV.We had to wait a further year before Dominic King appeared again in a new three part series of Kidnap and Ransom.  King was very obviously doing his own thing in the first series, but this time round, if anything, he seemed to be even more of a maverick and a complete law unto himself.  The second series started in an interesting fashion with King shown on a lake in a rowing boat shoving a sack covered parcel which looks suspiciously like a body, into the water, and then a reversal to 'two weeks earlier'. It was clear at that point that this was a marker for what was coming later to add extra interest, though what this was all about remained a mystery until right at the end. Not that any extra interest was really necessary as this is an engrossing and action packed story, set in Kashmir and built around the kidnap of the daughter of a key UK politician.  I will not say any more about the plots of these two series as there is a real danger of giving out spoilers here.This is very good and compelling entertainment.  There are sufficient twists and turns to keep the viewer highly engaged and the climax of each story is very tense.  The wait for the next episode on TV the following week felt far too long and I would not be at all surprised if many watch all three parts of each series in one go once they get their hands on the DVD. Dominic King is an interesting character and clearly there is plenty of potential for further outings.  If you have not seen these two series I would recommend you get hold of this box set.  You are unlikely to be disappointed.  It is sad that after the second series, ITV, the TV company which ordered Kidnap and Ransom cancelled the show but it is so good that one would hope that another company will pick it up.",5,Compelling Entertainment,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,2475,"['first', 'episode', 'Kidnap', 'Ransom', 'was', 'released', 'early', '2011', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'suspected', 'may', 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'very', 'long', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'who', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'remember', 'role', 'DS', 'Boyd', 'Cold', 'Case', 'part', 'Dominic', 'King', 'who', 'insurance', 'companies', 'international', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'series', 'dramatically', 'King', 'paying', 'over', 'ransom', 'receiving', 'corpse', 'back', 'rather', 'hostage', 'shocking', 'event', 'heavily', 'subsequently', 'main', 'story', 'concerns', 'kidnap', 'South', 'Africa', 'be', 'very', 'complex', 'had', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'had', 'wait', 'following', 'week', 'next', 'episode', 'TV.We', 'had', 'wait', 'further', 'year', 'Dominic', 'King', 'appeared', 'again', 'new', 'three', 'part', 'series', 'Kidnap', 'Ransom', 'King', 'was', 'very', 'obviously', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'first', 'series', 'time', 'round', 'anything', 'seemed', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'maverick', 'complete', 'law', 'unto', 'second', 'series', 'started', 'interesting', 'fashion', 'King', 'shown', 'lake', 'rowing', 'boat', 'shoving', 'sack', 'covered', 'parcel', 'suspiciously', 'body', 'water', 'then', 'reversal', ""'two"", 'weeks', 'earlier', 'was', 'clear', 'point', 'was', 'marker', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'later', 'add', 'extra', 'interest', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'remained', 'mystery', 'right', 'end', 'Not', 'extra', 'interest', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'engrossing', 'action', 'packed', 'story', 'set', 'Kashmir', 'built', 'kidnap', 'daughter', 'key', 'UK', 'politician', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'more', 'plots', 'two', 'series', 'real', 'danger', 'giving', 'out', 'spoilers', 'here.This', 'very', 'good', 'compelling', 'entertainment', 'are', 'sufficient', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewer', 'highly', 'engaged', 'climax', 'story', 'very', 'tense', 'wait', 'next', 'episode', 'TV', 'following', 'week', 'felt', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'many', 'watch', 'three', 'parts', 'series', 'one', 'go', 'once', 'get', 'hands', 'DVD', 'Dominic', 'King', 'interesting', 'character', 'clearly', 'plenty', 'potential', 'further', 'outings', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'two', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'get', 'hold', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'sad', 'second', 'series', 'ITV', 'TV', 'company', 'ordered', 'Kidnap', 'Ransom', 'cancelled', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'company', 'will', 'pick', 'up']",N/A
1569081,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B008KEQM2S,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","Trevor Eve plays the lead in this series just as he does in WAKING THE DEAD. It does not work as well as that series.  Eve is the same iconoclastic type character he is the first series. But the scripts involve his working as a negotiator for kidnap recoveries in foreign countries.  This is a lot more of a problem in the rest of the world than it is in the USA.  The USA regards kidnapping a top priority crime involving top law enforcement and top penalties whereas other countries do not regard it with such intensity. So this might happen to an American stationed in a foreign country with a company who took out kidnapping insurance (Eve is hired by these cos.) BUT it would never happen in the USA. So an American watching this series will be a bit puzzled by seeing regular police forces blunder about with kidnapping cases.These cases do not achieve the same level of poignancy that the WAKING cases do. The WAKING cases are filled with many tortured souls we have lived under the shadow of a murder never solved. Eve solves those cases with a wonderful team of characters.  In this kidnapping series, by contrast, there is a lot of hassling over money and he typically manages to save the victim and all is hunky dory.  I don't like any of the people who assist him.  But Eve is a great lead, the scripts are good and thus the fare is certainly very good.  It is just not terrific.If you have not seen WAKING THE DEAD, i would recommend starting there first if you are interested in experiencing Eve's acting talent in crime dramas.",4,Not as good as Waking the Dead,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1542,"['Trevor', 'Eve', 'lead', 'series', 'just', 'WAKING', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'Eve', 'same', 'iconoclastic', 'type', 'character', 'first', 'series', 'scripts', 'involve', 'working', 'negotiator', 'kidnap', 'recoveries', 'foreign', 'countries', 'lot', 'more', 'problem', 'rest', 'world', 'USA', 'USA', 'regards', 'kidnapping', 'top', 'priority', 'crime', 'involving', 'top', 'law', 'enforcement', 'top', 'penalties', 'other', 'countries', 'do', 'not', 'regard', 'such', 'intensity', 'might', 'happen', 'American', 'stationed', 'foreign', 'country', 'company', 'who', 'took', 'out', 'kidnapping', 'insurance', 'Eve', 'hired', 'cos.', 'BUT', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'USA', 'So', 'American', 'watching', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'seeing', 'regular', 'police', 'forces', 'blunder', 'kidnapping', 'cases.These', 'cases', 'do', 'not', 'achieve', 'same', 'level', 'poignancy', 'WAKING', 'cases', 'do', 'WAKING', 'cases', 'are', 'filled', 'many', 'tortured', 'souls', 'have', 'lived', 'shadow', 'murder', 'never', 'solved', 'Eve', 'cases', 'wonderful', 'team', 'characters', 'kidnapping', 'series', 'contrast', 'lot', 'hassling', 'money', 'typically', 'save', 'victim', 'hunky', 'dory', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'who', 'assist', 'Eve', 'great', 'lead', 'scripts', 'are', 'good', 'thus', 'fare', 'certainly', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'terrific.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'starting', 'there', 'first', 'are', 'interested', 'experiencing', 'Eve', 'acting', 'talent', 'crime', 'dramas']",N/A

A character study of a kidnap negotiator, a risk taker. Even scene transitions in this suspense will raise a viewer's blood pressure.

I've watched nothing quite like ""KIDNAP AND RANDSOM"".The series is about a hostage negotiator, Dominic King (Trevor Eve), a corporate businessman. He partners in the firm, Beddoes King, with Angela (Helen Baxendale). It's King who is in harms way, who takes the risk, who out-psyches kidnappers. King's wife is Sophie (Natasha Little-Young James Herriot). An office/field assistant is beautiful Carrie (Amara Karan).This complete Series 1&2 set holds two stories, each in 3 episodes.

1569089,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B008KEQM2S,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Trevor Eve is an actor whose work I&#8217;ve seldom seen, though there have been some close calls. While a student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in the early &#8217;80s, Eve was starring in a Detective show called &#8220;Shoestring,&#8221; which was very popular at the time and has since achieved cult status. He&#8217;d just come off a very successful adaptation of &#8220;Dracula&#8221; (arguably the best version ever) starring Louis Jourdan. As I didn&#8217;t have a television in those days I missed &#8220;Shoestring&#8221;, but saw &#8220;Dracula&#8221; on my return to Canada in 1982 when it was re-broadcast. Just after the run of &#8220;Shoestring&#8221; I went to London to see Eve in a stage production of &#8220;Children of a Lesser God&#8221; but was disappointed to find his understudy on that day. Eve won a prestigious London theatre award for his performance. Though my appreciation of his talents was limited, Eve was a household name in the U.K. and even gave Hollywood a shot in the mid-1980s.Eve has since cemented his television stardom in the U.K. with a particularly strong fan base for his work on the recent series &#8220;Waking The Dead&#8221;, which ran for nine years.It is this actor&#8217;s strong presence and deliberate style of acting that is the stand-out feature of KIDNAP & RANSOM which unfortunately only ran for two series of three episodes each.Kidnapping and ransoming is not common as a crime in North America but in other parts of the world it is epidemic. It is a strong premise for a series and it is a shame the show wasn&#8217;t allowed to find its &#8220;legs&#8221; and really develop.Deliberately-paced plots always run the risk of becoming lugubrious and losing the audience, especially if the protagonist is underplaying his role (as is the case here). It&#8217;s a bad combination which undoubtedly led to the series&#8217; demise. On the other hand if you are looking for some variation amidst the plethora of police procedural dramas that are out there, this may well be it.Filmed on location in South Africa there is a cinematic quality to this program that shows the care that went into it. Trevor Eve serves as one of the producers, which likely contributed to this achievement. Eve re-directed his creative focus in 1995 when an accident while playing polo rendered him incapable of acting for a few years. He was almost paralysed by the accident but fortunately recovered. Now he accomplishes both endeavours with the sure hand of experience and artistic integrity.As a retired army officer, Eve plays master negotiator Dominic King. His coolness under pressure and his insistence in not carrying a firearm (except in extreme cases) make him stand out from those around him (law enforcement and kidnappers). At first I thought Eve&#8217;s characterization too weak and unbelievable, but his approach grew on me and when I watched the 10 minute bonus feature interview with Eve in which he explains the meticulous research into the program and the background of real-life negotiators, I was able to buy into this somewhat unconventional leading man&#8217;s way of getting the job done.The stand-out among the supporting cast is the luminous Helen Baxendale, another unconventional actor, moreso for her distinctive look than anything else. Ms Baxendale has a prominent nose and deep-set eyes that may not strike the viewer as attractive initially, but the more you see her the more you like what you see. She&#8217;s quite stunning. And her range as an actor is well-documented. She was a wonderful Lady Macbeth in a lack-lustre film version of Shakespeare&#8217;s play &#8220;Macbeth&#8221; a number of years ago. Her work as Dominic&#8217;s business partner who runs the show from headquarters is wholly believable and her eventual attraction to her co-worker as his marriage unravels never seems forced or formulaic.John Hannah gets to play against type as one of the chief villains and a number of lesser-known actors shine by giving intense performances that add to the show&#8217;s dramatic impact.KIDNAP & RANSOM is definitely worth watching, particularly for fans of Trevor Eve.",4,Pretty good.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4155,"['Trevor', 'Eve', 'actor', 'work', '8217', 've', 'seldom', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'close', 'calls', 'student', 'Bristol', 'Old', 'Vic', 'Theatre', 'School', 'early', '8217', '80s', 'Eve', 'was', 'starring', 'Detective', 'show', 'called', '8220', 'Shoestring', '8221', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'time', 'achieved', 'cult', 'status', '8217', 'd', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'successful', 'adaptation', '8220', 'Dracula', '8221', 'arguably', 'best', 'version', 'ever', 'starring', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'television', 'days', 'missed', '8220', 'Shoestring', '8221', 'saw', '8220', 'Dracula', '8221', 'return', 'Canada', '1982', 'when', 'was', 're-broadcast', 'Just', 'run', '8220', 'Shoestring', '8221', 'went', 'London', 'see', 'Eve', 'stage', 'production', '8220', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', '8221', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'understudy', 'day', 'Eve', 'won', 'prestigious', 'London', 'theatre', 'award', 'performance', 'appreciation', 'talents', 'was', 'limited', 'Eve', 'was', 'household', 'name', 'U.K.', 'even', 'gave', 'Hollywood', 'shot', 'mid-1980s.Eve', 'cemented', 'television', 'stardom', 'U.K.', 'particularly', 'strong', 'fan', 'base', 'work', 'recent', 'series', '8220', 'Waking', 'Dead', '8221', 'ran', 'nine', 'years.It', 'actor', '8217', 'strong', 'presence', 'deliberate', 'style', 'acting', 'stand-out', 'feature', 'KIDNAP', 'RANSOM', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'ran', 'two', 'series', 'three', 'episodes', 'each.Kidnapping', 'ransoming', 'not', 'common', 'crime', 'North', 'America', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'epidemic', 'strong', 'premise', 'series', 'shame', 'show', '8217', 't', 'allowed', 'find', '8220', '8221', 'really', 'develop.Deliberately-paced', 'plots', 'always', 'run', 'risk', 'becoming', 'lugubrious', 'losing', 'audience', 'especially', 'protagonist', 'underplaying', 'role', 'case', 'here', '8217', 's', 'bad', 'combination', 'undoubtedly', 'led', 'series', '8217', 'demise', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'looking', 'variation', 'plethora', 'police', 'procedural', 'dramas', 'are', 'there', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'it.Filmed', 'location', 'South', 'Africa', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'program', 'care', 'went', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'one', 'producers', 'likely', 'contributed', 'achievement', 'Eve', 're-directed', 'creative', 'focus', '1995', 'when', 'accident', 'playing', 'polo', 'rendered', 'incapable', 'acting', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'almost', 'paralysed', 'accident', 'fortunately', 'recovered', 'Now', 'endeavours', 'sure', 'hand', 'experience', 'artistic', 'integrity.As', 'retired', 'army', 'officer', 'Eve', 'master', 'negotiator', 'Dominic', 'King', 'coolness', 'pressure', 'insistence', 'not', 'carrying', 'firearm', 'extreme', 'cases', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'law', 'enforcement', 'kidnappers', 'first', 'thought', 'Eve', '8217', 's', 'characterization', 'too', 'weak', 'unbelievable', 'approach', 'grew', 'when', 'watched', '10', 'minute', 'bonus', 'feature', 'interview', 'Eve', 'meticulous', 'research', 'program', 'background', 'real-life', 'negotiators', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'unconventional', 'leading', 'man', '8217', 's', 'way', 'getting', 'job', 'done.The', 'stand-out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'luminous', 'Helen', 'Baxendale', 'unconventional', 'actor', 'moreso', 'distinctive', 'look', 'anything', 'else', 'Ms', 'Baxendale', 'prominent', 'nose', 'deep-set', 'eyes', 'may', 'not', 'strike', 'viewer', 'attractive', 'initially', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'see', '8217', 'quite', 'stunning', 'range', 'actor', 'well-documented', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'lack-lustre', 'film', 'version', 'Shakespeare', '8217', 's', 'play', '8220', 'Macbeth', '8221', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'work', 'Dominic', '8217', 's', 'business', 'partner', 'who', 'show', 'headquarters', 'wholly', 'believable', 'eventual', 'attraction', 'co-worker', 'marriage', 'unravels', 'never', 'forced', 'formulaic.John', 'Hannah', 'play', 'type', 'one', 'chief', 'villains', 'number', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'shine', 'giving', 'intense', 'performances', 'add', 'show', '8217', 'dramatic', 'impact.KIDNAP', 'RANSOM', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'particularly', 'fans', 'Trevor', 'Eve']",N/A

1569091,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B008KEQM2S,Richard B. Schwartz,"[0, 0]","This recent series featuring Trevor Eve (known particularly as Peter Boyd in the exceptional series, Waking the Dead) centers on Dominic King (actually Colonel [ret.] Dominic King).  King is a partner in the firm BeddoesKing, whose work involves the negotiations and deliveries of ransoms for individuals who have been kidnapped.  A massive problem, particularly in South America, there are such firms and Eve discusses them in a 10-minute interview that is part of series I.  Negotiators are often ex-military, individuals who have become restive working behind a desk and who long for the stimulation and challenge of working in the field under difficult, threatening circumstances.Each of the two stories is shot on location, the first in South Africa and England, the second in England and Kashmir.  In the first episode a botanist is kidnapped; both she and her husband work for pharmaceutical firms whose products can result in big payouts.  In the second episode a family is kidnapped in Kashmir; when the police appear after the exchange, one of the kidnappers and a female accomplice take over a bus filled with tourists, including the daughter of a high-ranking British government official.In both cases there are back channels operating; i.e., all is not what it seems and there are secret connections behind the scenes.  Each story is fast-paced, beautifully written and shot and, perhaps most important, not claustrophobic (as some kidnapping stories can become).  Eve is exceptional, as always, and so is the supporting cast.  This is a fine series with some sex and violence but neither are prolonged nor dwelt-upon unnecessarily.Each episode is in three parts of 45 minutes each.  Thus, you can settle in for a full-night's viewing or watch it in parts of convenient length.  The special feature with disc one (the Eve interview) is enlightening and entertaining; the special features with disc two (statistics on kidnapping and the writer's discussion of his sources) are in print form rather than live action.",5,"Trevor Eve, Exceptional as Usual",1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,2027,"['recent', 'series', 'featuring', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'known', 'particularly', 'Peter', 'Boyd', 'exceptional', 'series', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'centers', 'Dominic', 'King', 'actually', 'Colonel', '[', 'ret', ']', 'Dominic', 'King', 'King', 'partner', 'firm', 'BeddoesKing', 'work', 'negotiations', 'deliveries', 'ransoms', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'massive', 'problem', 'particularly', 'South', 'America', 'are', 'such', 'firms', 'Eve', '10-minute', 'interview', 'part', 'series', 'Negotiators', 'are', 'often', 'ex-military', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'restive', 'working', 'desk', 'who', 'long', 'stimulation', 'challenge', 'working', 'field', 'difficult', 'threatening', 'circumstances.Each', 'two', 'stories', 'shot', 'location', 'first', 'South', 'Africa', 'England', 'second', 'England', 'Kashmir', 'first', 'episode', 'botanist', 'kidnapped', 'husband', 'work', 'pharmaceutical', 'firms', 'products', 'can', 'result', 'big', 'payouts', 'second', 'episode', 'family', 'kidnapped', 'Kashmir', 'when', 'police', 'appear', 'exchange', 'one', 'kidnappers', 'female', 'accomplice', 'take', 'bus', 'filled', 'tourists', 'including', 'daughter', 'high-ranking', 'British', 'government', 'cases', 'are', 'back', 'channels', 'operating', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'secret', 'connections', 'scenes', 'story', 'fast-paced', 'beautifully', 'written', 'shot', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'not', 'claustrophobic', 'kidnapping', 'stories', 'can', 'become', 'Eve', 'exceptional', 'always', 'so', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'series', 'sex', 'violence', 'are', 'prolonged', 'dwelt-upon', 'unnecessarily.Each', 'episode', 'three', 'parts', '45', 'minutes', 'Thus', 'can', 'settle', 'full-night', 'viewing', 'watch', 'parts', 'convenient', 'length', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', 'one', 'Eve', 'interview', 'enlightening', 'entertaining', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'two', 'statistics', 'kidnapping', 'writer', 'discussion', 'sources', 'are', 'print', 'form', 'rather', 'live', 'action']",N/A
