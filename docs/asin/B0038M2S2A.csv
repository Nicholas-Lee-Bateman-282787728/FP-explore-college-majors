His relationship with Louisa is complicated and I often wonder why she lingers in the relationship.  Wonderful casting of the townspeople.  Dogs are wonderfully insightful and despite his foibles and social ineptness the dogs in the show are wonderfully loyal to him which says musch about how the writers characterize the Doc.

Martin stay in Portwenn or go back to London to resume his career as a surgeon.  Doc. Martin delightfully played by Martin Clumes in this fourth series tries all kinds of ""remedies"" (including some very bloody and gross ones) to cure his aversion to the sight of blood in order to be a surgeon in London again. In the meantime he is still the only doctor in the beautiful little seaside village of Portwenn solving all kinds of ""medical mysteries"" that are plaguing the hysterically eccentric inhabitants (I just adore Mrs. Tichell the pharmacist/chemist who although married to a nearly deaf man is completely besotted with Doc Martin and is very jealous of any woman that comes into his life) of Portwenn--Yes all of the weird folks are back including the hypochondriac plumber (now resturant owner),  the very inept police officer along with the highly inept receptionist of the Doc., etc.  NO Doc. Martin has NOT acquired any ""bedside manners"".  If anything, Doc. Martin is more surly, irritable and impatient then ever mainly due to his disastrous attempt to marry Louisa in season 3.  His gruff manner is not helped when Louisa returns very pregnant by him and filled with the determination to have the baby completely ""on her own"".  Also adding to his extreme frustration is the appearance of an ""old flame"".Indeed this series continues to delight me bring to my life a lot of enjoyable entertainment--it is so well written and, most of all, it is so well acted.Do buy season 4 for it truly is very entertaining.  As a previous reviewer, on this board suggested, you should get seasons 1-3 first because all of the episodes are ""interconnected"".(I must add that at the end of series 4, we do kind of see Doc.

Series 4 picks right up with the dramatic falling apart of a wedding ceremony from the ending of Series 3. So what can get worse? Everything. About the only thing that compares to the eccentric characters in Portwenn is way back to Mayberry RFD. Is Portwenn a British Mayberry? May-be! It's Cornwall corny. And also a Cornwall (filmed in Port Isaac) beautiful quaint fishing port.Every weird local is back for Series 4. Rude, grumpy Doc (Martin Clunes) still gags at blood; Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) is poorer thus less sane; teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz) has an obvious situation; receptionist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny wanting a man, maybe Large Jr., son of Bert Large (Ian McNeice)plumber turned chef (ugh, don't order the soup); and newcomer Edith (Lia Williams)in charge of romantic mayhem. That's just the short-list of a crazy cast that keeps a tapestry of sub-plots moving fast.A great family series, which does have a 'graphic medical scene' warning due to numerous accidents involving some blood for Doc Martin to gag or spew from. A surgeon afraid of blood is just part of the absurd humor. If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this will do & make you beg for more. Episodes carry over to the next and all with SUBTITLES. Some of the best British Doctor Comedy/Drama ever produced.Need more evidence of greatness? Episode details:1 BETTER THE DEVIL-Louisa left Portwenn & Doc is out-grouching his own sour records. Doc's ex-girlfriend from med school arrives. Will he soon be London bound? His blood phobia may decide.2 UNEASY LIES THE HEAD-Louisa returns (much heavier) and town tongues tell tales. She doesn't want Martin involved. Edith becomes Louisa's doctor. Aunt Joan sides with Louisa & tells Doc to do right by her. The school headmaster acts stranger than the routine eccentric of Portwenn.3 PERISH TOGETHER AS FOOLS-Local copper's bro is ill. There is romance all about--but not what you expect. Doc shows a rare sign of tenderness with seeing the baby scan.4 DRIVING MR McLYNN-Louisa wants to be school head again, Joan needs money, & Doc tells Edith he applied for a surgery position but...what about the blood?5 THE DEPARTED-Doc falsifies his blood fear problem in a surgery job interview. Doc's newly widowed patient is talking with her departed. A mental problem? Not uncommon for Portwenn. Joan gets sued.6 MIDWIFE CRISIS-A midwife & Doc disagree on Louisa's care. Joan is told of Doc's new London job but who should tell Louisa? Bert's restaurant has a new cook, followed by an emergency.7 DO NOT DISTURB-Word gets out the Doc is leaving Portwenn. Doc accompanies Edith to a conference but it ends differently than expected. Joan starts taking in B&B; guests-paying guests.8 THE WRONG GOODBYE-Doc's last day at Portwenn includes abundant patients, too many expressions of affection, Edith wanting an apology, Aunt Joan's on his back over his unborn baby, and...oh dear, an emergency at an emergency.Bottom line recommendation: By all means watch it, but after Series 1, 2, & 3. Once you see Series 4, if not already owned, you WILL buy the others. Might as well watch them in order. Treat yourself.

The loons are back in town!This is British comedy at its best: quirky characters, unique plot twists, and gorgeous scenery leave you alternately chuckling and shaking your head incredulously.If one egocentric but brilliant physician is good, why not two?  An old flame of Doc Martin's surfaces with a predatory gleam in her eye whilst the charming but oft bewildered Louisa faces a new challenge to her love for Doc Martin and an unanticipated complication.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Titchell, the chemist (pharmacist), still burns with an unreciprocated crush that's hilariously optimistic.I could eat this series with a spoon and wait impatiently for each new season.  Apparently there are episodes released in Britain that are unavailable here in the States.

The next series kept me hooked, and the third series was terrific, at least it was until the unexpected ending. It left me so disappointed, but surely the next series would set things right? Sadly, the fourth series makes matters even worse.Martin seems to have undergone a personality shift in series 4. He's gone beyond anti-social, bellowing at everyone and deliberately undermining Louisa's and Pauline's efforts to get on with their careers. He had always been misanthropic, but now he takes on a particular disdain for women which is going to be difficult to explain away later.A new character, his old colleague and girlfriend Edith, has been written as so one-dimensionally evil that we wouldn't be surprised to see her grow horns and rub her hands in evil glee. Pauline and Auntie Joan become uncharacteristically bubble-headed at times, quite at odds with their characters in the previous series.For seven episodes, the old characters spin their wheels, and new characters who appear in single episodes act bizarre and eccentric. Martin appears to make progress in overcoming his aversion to blood and thinks about his own career. Rather than the bluster and embarrassment of the previous series, he engages in intimidation and rudeness which is remarkable even for him.Predictably, the last (eighth) episode softens Martin's edges just enough so that we will come back for a fifth series to see if it's a temporary transformation or if he will become even nastier still.
