484432,AK0CENM3LUM28,6305951624,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","X / B00000JL4L*Spoilers*First off, if you're not familiar with the X manga, I can honestly say that it is essential for you to brush up on the basics before attempting to watch this movie or you will be completely lost and confused. Unfortunately, the problem with this movie is that once you've brushed up on the manga (say, by reading the Wikipedia entry on it), you've already reached the level of immersion this movie offers. The beginning of the movie sets the scene - the main character's nude and dead (dying?) mother shows up in a dream and explains that the apocalypse is coming, he's the chosen one to prevent it, and a list of the seven trustworthy heroes that will fight along side him is as follows...etc., etc.And that's fine as far as it goes - bland but standard scene setting focusing on avoiding character development as much as possible and cutting straight to the action. Unfortunately, the seven heroes are almost immediately reduced to ancillary support characters, where ""support"" is loosely defined as ""die as quickly and as stupidly as possible"", which is a shame because the battles are really the only thing this movie has to hang its hat on.Well, that's not entirely true - the one other driving plot point in this movie is that the main character and his childhood friend are destined to oppose each other - whichever side the main character chooses to aid (humanity and technology vs. extinction and nature, basically), his friend will be compelled to oppose him from the other side. While this particular aspect is interesting, intriguing, and potentially tragic, it breaks down in two major respects. Firstly, the main character is so poorly characterized that it is difficult to feel any real resonance with him. He repeatedly protests that he absolutely *will not* fight to save the world because, he says, he ""only want to protect my friends!"" The problem, of course, being that he never puts together that the end of humanity will eventually entail the end of his pals as well.Indeed, as an aside, I have to say that this anime seems unique in the sense that I actually ended up rooting for the ""bad"" guys - even though I strongly got the impression that I wasn't 'supposed' to - because they generally seemed more good than the ""good"" guys. The bad guys at least threw themselves into their work, rather than passively reacting constantly like the good guys did. They'd put thought and preparation into their training and strategy, while it seemed that the good guys had sat around on their thumbs all day. And the bad guys seemed to genuinely believe in their cause - intending to wipe out all humanity, including themselves, for the good of the planet - as opposed to the lackluster enthusiasm of the good guys who basically said (and I'm paraphrasing) ""Things may not be so great nowadays, but my kids don't seem to know the difference."" There's a rallying cry.Which brings me neatly to the second problem with the ""Destined Tragedy"" plot. The writers seem to realize, about half-way through the movie, that the hero's foil is intensely more likable than the cardboard cut-out main character and decide to remedy this by immediately switching the foil character over to an insane, homicidal madman who kills friends and allies alike with a single blow. And it is this character shift - a desperate attempt to steer the story back on track and explain *why* the two characters can't just sit down and talk it out over a latte - that completely kills the movie because it's a gimmicky contrivance that removes drama (as well as all the remaining ancillary characters) instantly.Tragedies aren't tragic because someone we don't care about dies - if ""X"" had truly wanted to be tragic and thought provoking, then the two foil characters should have both chosen a side they truly believe in and then fought for that side with a heavy heart (a laSuikoden II). Instead, the writers try to have their cake and eat it to by making the hero a soggy ""I don't want to be involved"" cardboard cut-out and the anti-hero a stereotypical madman on a murder spree, thus allowing them to dodge any moral questions about the nature of mankind and our affect on the earth. Unfortunately, if you want a tragedy, you can't dodge moral questions like that.Having said all that, I have to now admit that I still found the movie oddly interesting - enough to maybe watch it again, hence my rating. One of my guilty pleasures is the ""Dragonball Z"" series, mostly because I think the subtext behind the writing is genuinely interesting, but I will admit that the spectacle fighting can be pleasant to watch. And that's kind of what this movie feels like - like someone took a manga about two opposing groups with super heroes, paired them all off, and told them to have at it. If that was all ""X"" was, I would have likely enjoyed it on those merits alone, but it still shoots itself in the foot by having the fights be terminally short and by making the characters die for stupid, suicidal reasons.To wrap this review up, there's two more things worth noting. First, there's definitely nudity and violence in this movie, so be forewarned if that sort of thing bothers you. Second, there is something rather 'off' with the English subtitles for the hearing impaired - not only do they not match the actual English dialogue (something I've come to expect from most anime), there are huge stretches of dialogue that isn't subtitled *at all*. I can't say that the lack of subtitles would hamper your understanding of the movie, but that's mostly an indictment on the bland dialogue itself rather than an excuse.~ Ana

484433,AYLQS7IXZVMFP,6305951624,Andres C.,"[1, 2]","This was the movie I was most eagerly awaiting in 2000, the film based on the long-running manga series by CLAMP (Card Captor Sakura). Not usually  known for their serious comics, many people had doubts whether or not CLAMP  would succeed with X/1999. However, it became a great manga and among my  favorites.I then had doubts about X: The Movie. My fears were realized.  First of all, many volumes of intense and dramatical manga were crushed  into an hour and a half of special effects and great animation. The script  went wrong somewhere, because at the very beginning we are winded with an  enormous amount of information that unfolded nicely in the manga. The  viewer is then subjected to our main character, Kamui, being projected back  and forth from dream to reality, and honestly, it didn't create the effect  intended. There were so many new techniques tested in this movie, that it  seemed more like an animation demo than a film. Events pass too  quickly.Now, onto the good. The drawings were excellent and so were the  coloring. Music was powerful but not exceptional like Yoko Kanno's works.  This is the equivalent of MI2. New techniques in filming, but a pretty dull  movie (no offense to fans of MI2). Remember, this is only my personal  opinion, and others may have enjoyed this movie very much. If it had been  made into a long-running series with the same techniques and animation, it  would be among my favorites. But, unfortunately, CLAMP opted for a 90  minute movie instead.Let's all keep our fingers crossed for an X/1999 TV  Series or OAV series to be released in the not-so-distant future.

484435,A2TZPRWK1WXPCX,6305951624,Cafe,"[17, 19]","X is probably one of my favorite anime movies of all time. It's based on a  manga of the same name by CLAMP. However the movie version tells a slightly  different story than the as yet uncompleted manga (which is currently  compiled in 10 tankabon).The shojo animation by CLAMP and the character  designs by Nobuteru Yuki are absolutely beautiful and are far better than  the animation in some of CLAMP's earlier OAVs (i.e. RG Veda and Tokyo  Babylon). The music is also excellent with the dark and gloomy soundtrack  complementing the gothic feel of X perfectly. However the movie's plot  suffers from two major problems. Firstly, the plot is rather slim in  comparison with the X manga, sacrificing a lot of the character interaction  and backstory to fit the whole manga series onto one 90 minute video.  Because of this it also suffers from the same problem as RG Veda, in that  there are a few parts of the movie which are seemingly unrelated to the  rest of the film. It would have been much better if X had been made into a  series of OAVs instead of a single movie to preserve the manga's story in  its entirety. The only other problem that I had with X was that the main  character, Kamui, came off as a wimp because of his voice actor. The other  characters were voiced excellently but Kamui seemed to lose a lot of  resentment against his fate and because of this the feeling of angst that  pervades the manga series in less evident in the movie version of X.",4,One of my favorites......,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1470,"['X', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'movies', 'time', 'based', 'manga', 'same', 'name', 'CLAMP', 'However', 'movie', 'version', 'slightly', 'different', 'story', 'yet', 'uncompleted', 'manga', 'currently', 'compiled', '10', 'tankabon', 'shojo', 'animation', 'CLAMP', 'character', 'designs', 'Nobuteru', 'Yuki', 'are', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'animation', 'CLAMP', 'earlier', 'OAVs', 'i.e', 'RG', 'Veda', 'Tokyo', 'Babylon', 'music', 'also', 'excellent', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'soundtrack', 'complementing', 'gothic', 'feel', 'X', 'perfectly', 'However', 'movie', 'plot', 'suffers', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'Firstly', 'plot', 'rather', 'slim', 'comparison', 'X', 'manga', 'sacrificing', 'lot', 'character', 'interaction', 'backstory', 'fit', 'whole', 'manga', 'series', 'one', '90', 'minute', 'video', 'also', 'same', 'problem', 'RG', 'Veda', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'X', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'series', 'OAVs', 'instead', 'single', 'movie', 'preserve', 'manga', 'story', 'entirety', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'X', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'Kamui', 'came', 'off', 'wimp', 'voice', 'actor', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'voiced', 'excellently', 'Kamui', 'seemed', 'lose', 'lot', 'resentment', 'fate', 'feeling', 'angst', 'manga', 'series', 'less', 'evident', 'movie', 'version', 'X']",X - The Movie VHS

Not only was the plot kind of lame, but also the art wasn't the best.  The movie's plot was simple, which is good, but it was made complex by ""dreams"" of the potential future thrown in at random times throughout the movie.  This made it hard to guess what was reality and what was the dream.  I think the movie would have done better if it were to stick the hardcore action and skip the overly-melodramatic dreams.The basic premise of this movie is good versus good.  Humans have been raping the planet for their entire existence.  Now the earth is about to crack; Mother Nature needs a rest.  The group that supports the Dragon of the Earth advocates wiping the human race out to accomplish this.  The group that supports the Dragon of the Heaven believes humans must achieve the greatness god planned for them.  That they will return Mother Nature to her greatness we just need to get over ourselves first.  We can accomplish this through love and all that other jazz.  Convoluted?  Yes but each argument has a leg to stand on.  With this being said you would think that one would be torn about whom to root for.  But this movie makes this choice for you by weak character development and those stupid dreams mentioned earlier.  The bad guy is this evil sadistic psycho and instead of empathizing with him you just want to see him dead.Overall the movie was simple but was made complex by useless scenes.  And on top of that the ending was predictable and frustrating.  See it for the sake of seeing it but don't buy.

Unlike fight scenes that I'm used to, which are very fast and furious, at least the first fight with Kamui against Nataku and the other man (Gomen, his name escapes me right now) was very slow and had a very strange but very interesting feel to it that I enjoyed a LOT.

Thompson,"[4, 6]","INTRO:  When I first bought this DVD, I was kinda' diving into a show that I had not read the manga of, and I half and half regret and am thankful for that.  The reasons why are:--Regret:  I didn't get to hear the whole backstory and learn about the whole plot before hand.--Thankful:  I'm glad I didn't get attached to the characters who died in this as much as I already did.----------------------------------------DVD:  To start, the DVD itself is average.  Nothing too special.  Has bios and some trailers and such.  I can't complain but can't praise it either.----------------------------------------STORY/PLOT:  The movie (and series) seems extremely well-done.  Usually I don't mind these types of shows (severely depressing).  Its just this one seemed to go a little bit too far.  Which isn't totally bad, its kinda' a twist from the normal ""Hero saves princess"" routine.  I would watch it a few times actually.----------------------------------------OVERALL:  I know this isn't the ""main"" review to read.  You should obviously read someone else's review before mine (or after).  The only advice I can give is that you should probably see the manga first since its far better from the many Otaku I've heard from.  Second, if you are hardcore into this series, you might want to check out the TV version that is coming out.

Well I was expecting a lot from the story line, because of the outside cover, but you should not judge anything by what is on the outside.  What was inside was definitely far different from what I perceived it to possibly have in it.  The plot line was disjointed, but very intriguing, though the messiah image is a bit cliqued, even though it works superbly into this movie.  The messiah plot did have some of its own quirks in this movie that are fairly original.  The whole mood and tone of the movie was oppressing and brooding, the animation surely made a proper set-up for the end of the world.  The characters were excellent, the ones that actually spoke and did not die randomly, especially Fuuma and Kamui.  The visuals were remarkable, definitely better than most animation out there.  The ending was kind of drawn out with a quick conclusion, and a time of mourning.  This is one of the most depressing animes I have seen, even more so than Akira, or the finale of Cowboy Bebop.  Well cheer for the Dragon of Heaven, but weep for the Dragon of Earth and watch something funny after this movie, because it really is depressing.

(some that died in the movie ended up not dying in the series and vica versa) the tv series basically gives each charicter an in depth story so you better relate to them and explains things like ""barrier fields"" in a understandable fashion. if i had not seen the tv series in its entirety before watching the movie, i wouldnt understand much of what went on. but as i said, some things were changed. for instance 2 charicters that end up falling in love and living in the seires... .actually hate and fight each other in the movie and end up dying. i prefer the story the way the tv series did it, but the movie for what it is is its own masterpiece. i see it as a loose adaptation of the manga/tv series with alot of creative changes implied. but this doesnt make it a bad movie, this is definately one of the better animes",4,its a basic loose adaptation/summary of the manga/tv series,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,1633,"['basically', 'movie', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'goings', 'manga', 'tv', 'series', '90', 'minute', 'period', 'time', 'opposed', 'watching', '10+', 'hours', 'x', 'tv', 'series', 'tv', 'series', 'far', 'batter', 'things', 'were', 'slightly', 'changed', 'work', 'time', 'frame', 'even', 'ending', 'different', 'think', 'comparison', 'kubrik', 'version', 'shining', 'newer', 'made', 'tv', 'version', 'many', 'things', 'werent', 'true', 'book', 'kubrick', 'version', 'excellent', 'movie', 'none', 'less', 'i', 'would', 'reccomend', 'watch', 'X', 'only', 'have', 'already', 'plan', 'view', 'series', 'movies', 'rushes', 'many', 'parts', 'not', 'taking', 'much', 'time', 'introduce', 'alot', 'charicters', 'are', '14', 'main', 'charicters', 'dont', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'died', 'way', 'did', 'really', 'much', 'care', 'when', 'do', 'died', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'dying', 'series', 'vica', 'versa', 'tv', 'series', 'basically', 'charicter', 'depth', 'story', 'better', 'relate', 'things', 'barrier', 'fields', 'understandable', 'fashion', 'i', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'tv', 'series', 'entirety', 'watching', 'movie', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'understand', 'much', 'what', 'went', 'i', 'said', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'instance', '2', 'charicters', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'living', 'seires', '.actually', 'hate', 'fight', 'other', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'i', 'prefer', 'story', 'way', 'tv', 'series', 'did', 'movie', 'what', 'own', 'masterpiece', 'i', 'see', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'manga/tv', 'series', 'alot', 'creative', 'changes', 'implied', 'doesnt', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'definately', 'one', 'better', 'animes']",X - The Movie VHS
484458,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,6305951624,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 1]","The film X is based off of an apocalyptic manga series.  However, unlike the manga, the film focuses on the roles of Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma, and the roles they play in the Apocalypse.  But this abbreviated story reduces the Dragons of the Heavens and the Earth to minor characters that the viewer never really gets to know.  And since so little character development has been done for the Dragons of the Heavens and the Earth, it's hard to feel any sense of loss as each of these characters are killed off during the film.  There is also very little done in the film in the way of plot development, which can make the film hard to follow if you don't already have some familiarity with the property through the manga or the X anime series that was produced several years later.The DVD contains five special features.  The first is labeled, ""Tarot Cards.""  There are three sets of cards: The Seven Dragons of Heaven, The Seven Dragons of Earth, and The Dream Watchers.  Under each section, you select a name, and you see a picture of a character in a ""tarot card,"" and information about the character is provided.  For many of the characters in the film, you get much more of their backstories through this feature than you ever get in the film.There is a photo gallery, which is made up completely of stills from the film.  The ""Director's Interview"" is twenty-three pages of text that the viewer reads through.  There is also an English theatrical trailer for the film included.X is an R-rated film, and it earns this designation primarily from all the blood that's shown during the film.  While there is some nudity, it is overshadowed by the blood.  With this rating, I cannot recommend this film to anyone under the age of 17.  If you like blood and gore and very little in the way of plot or character development, then you might find some enjoyment in this film.  However, if you prefer more substance for plot and character, or if the sight of animated blood makes you queasy, then you should avoid X.",2,"Beautiful animation, but weak story and character development",1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2009,"['film', 'X', 'based', 'apocalyptic', 'manga', 'series', 'However', 'manga', 'film', 'roles', 'Kamui', 'Kotori', 'Fuma', 'roles', 'play', 'Apocalypse', 'abbreviated', 'story', 'Dragons', 'Heavens', 'Earth', 'minor', 'characters', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'so', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'been', 'done', 'Dragons', 'Heavens', 'Earth', 'hard', 'feel', 'sense', 'loss', 'characters', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'done', 'film', 'way', 'plot', 'development', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'hard', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'familiarity', 'property', 'manga', 'X', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'several', 'years', 'later.The', 'DVD', 'five', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'labeled', 'Tarot', 'Cards', 'are', 'three', 'sets', 'cards', 'Seven', 'Dragons', 'Heaven', 'Seven', 'Dragons', 'Earth', 'Dream', 'Watchers', 'section', 'select', 'name', 'see', 'picture', 'character', 'tarot', 'card', 'information', 'character', 'provided', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'backstories', 'feature', 'ever', 'get', 'film.There', 'photo', 'gallery', 'made', 'up', 'completely', 'stills', 'film', 'Director', 'Interview', 'twenty-three', 'pages', 'text', 'viewer', 'also', 'English', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'included.X', 'R-rated', 'film', 'designation', 'primarily', 'blood', 'shown', 'film', 'nudity', 'overshadowed', 'blood', 'rating', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'age', '17', 'like', 'blood', 'gore', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'might', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'However', 'prefer', 'more', 'substance', 'plot', 'character', 'sight', 'animated', 'blood', 'queasy', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'X']",X - The Movie VHS
484459,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6305951624,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[1, 3]","From the very beginning of X - an animated movie based on the manga by Clamp and animated by Mad House - you know that this is going to be gory and graphic. Rintaro, of Astro Boy fame, directed this one.It's also very clear from the beginning that the movie, made in 2000, was created for the fans of the complex Manga series. You get a quick scene of a boy - Kamui - being given a sword drawn from the stomach of his naked mother. She then recites a laundry list of &quot;These are your friends, these are your enemies&quot;, showing each one briefly. While manga fans will instantly connect with them, newcomers to the series will be completely lost.Kamui is sent to Tokyo to face the Final Battle of the Dragon of Heaven vs the Dragon of Earth. He and the &quot;good guys&quot; are on the side of Heaven. The &quot;bad guys&quot; think the city is full of corruption, pollution and slime and needs to be cleansed so there can be a rebirth. We start with a personal battle beteen a pair of enemies, which apparently is the overture. And on the battles go ... well, in between all the flashbacks and dream sequences and meandering. There's lots of religious symbolism, from angels and devils to pentagrams and people being crucified. Kamui, the hero, is told his name mean's God's Power.The &quot;good side&quot;, the Dragon of Heaven, gets power from the 7 stars of the big dipper. They are defeated one by one. Kamui is told the 7 Dragons of Earth solely wish to destroy the earth. He refuses to care and just wants to protect his friends Fuma and Kotori. As it turns out, the final battle is between Kamui and his best friend, Fuma. Whatever side Kamui chooses, Fuma must be the other. And just as Kamui got a sword from his mom, Fuma pulls one from his sister.Interestingly, even though the original Manga's creators, Clamp, is made up of all women, I was disappointed to see either banana-brained girly-girls or lap-dancers. The two main girls - sisters - fall on the two sides of that coin. The two other main females both die gruesomely in order to 'birth' swords for their guys. The guys on the other hand are strong, intelligent and complex. It's a pretty bizarre vision to come from a smart group of women.I'm sure it was really hard to fit the complex Manga story into a 100-minute movie. But there are so many ways that it COULD have been told well. As it is, you have a hero who doesn't seem to really care about or do anything for the city. He decides to protect his 2 friends instead, but doesn't even do that. There are many battles between sides that we don't care about, and teammates just 'stroll' along when their friends are in danger.As far as the main sides, all we know is that there are the &quot;earth cleansers&quot; and &quot;earth savers&quot;. In fact the 'earth cleansers' seem to have a pretty good argument against corruption and pollution. They say to look in the future and that this solution gives the future the best possibility. The &quot;earth savers&quot; just say &quot;We must keep the status quo!&quot; One of the heroes of Heaven in fact decided to become a prostitute and learned to use flames. She might have chosen the wrong side ...When you get to the epic final battle, Kamui cuts off Fuma's head, and then holds the head tenderly. Flashbacks remind Kamui that he pretty much has failed at everything he tried to do.

First off, my favorite character, Kakyo, has been replaced with this pony-tail guy named Shugo who controls water. It was hard for Rintaro to direct a movie based on a Manga that hadn't ended yet at the time. But you have to realize that this is the way Rintaro works (just look at Galaxy Express 999). However, he does do a fare job of making the movie. I would of liked to see just one of the dragons of the heaven actually win a battle without commiting suicide. The battles were still terrific and the animation is as beautiful as that of the manga. The dubbing was a little off a times (too noisy). The ending had a little too much hype surrounding it. Through the whole movie, everyone talks about how Kamui and Fuma must fight with both swords. Well, they did get to it, but the battle only lasted about 2 minutes and that was it. At some points in the movie, it seemed real boring, but it explains a lot. This is not a movie for everyone. In fact, some will dislike the movie completely. It's for those who like unhappily ever after movies. There is a 30 minutes sequel to it called X2 (Which really just a music video featuring the earth being destroyed). But dont worry. If you wanted fan service, theres an X series in the works. Anyway, not a movie for everyone, but why don't you pick it up and see if you like it.

I've read and puzzled over those, and now I have spent several hours with this DVD.  There comes a point in the quest for value where one has to finally ponder why a work is the way it is.  I don't expect every DVD or book to be a work of art, but I do expect that each such effort have some sense of its purpose or potential value.In the case of 'X', I confess I am mystified.  On the surface, a young man (Kamui) returns to Tokyo at the behest of his dying mother to defend those he loves.  But he fails to defend Kotori, who loves him, and forces his friend Fuuma to make impossible choices.  On the layer below this Kamui and Fuuma are doomed to become the primary antagonists in a struggle over whether the human race should be allowed to survive.  In the ensuing fight, shared with the other dragons of heaven and earth, the destruction is sufficient to wonder whether the cure is worse than the disease.In truth, the plot is a pre-ordained ballet of opposing forces driven to a tragic conclusion.  I am not familiar with Japanese literature, but 'X' reminds me of a Greek tragedy where anyone could stop the inevitable end, but no one does.  Kamui's tragic flaw is his inability to act until it is too late.  Fuuma, supposedly the villain of the piece, seems to be the nobler of the two, simply because he throws himself into his role.  All of the characters are disjointed archetypes, but despite all of the symbols and portents, nothing really gels.So this becomes an apocalypse in search of a cause.  Harumitsu Shimuzu as put together an excellent score, which seems to capture Kamui's perpetual agonizing and the film's ambivalent perfectly.  The film's theme, 'Forever Love' by Yoshiki, is worth keeping as well.  But good music and interesting artwork are not enough to overcome a skeletal plot that never moves in any direction for long.  A glance at the final credits reveals that this was a production with a cast of hundreds, and perhaps that is the problem.

484463,A27FPQIWI6VAI9,6305951624,Martin Prehn,"[3, 3]","An interesting question X tries to answer. Before I start my review here's a little warning:DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH THE ENGLISH DUB!!!I saw it twice in japanese and understood everything. Then I saw it once in english and I was totally lost. Everything is different in English! The brief moments of humor - gone. The tragic element of impending doom - completely missing. Any sense of compassion or sympathy for Kamui, Fuma or Kotori - simply not there. But rest assured that in their places we find a) bad acting b) a lot of words and pointless explanations that were NOT in the original version c) Some of the most incredibly stupid translations and pronounciations of names.People said &quot;Kotori&quot; and I thougt they were talking about &quot;cutlery&quot;. And somehow they made &quot;Kamui&quot; sound exactly like &quot;Kanoe&quot;My favorite moment in the english version is when Kotori cuts her hand on the magic rain and as she starts bleeding Fuma brilliantly points out &quot;You're hurt!&quot;. In the Japanese version he says nothing.So, anyhoodelidoodely: my reviewI like it. The anmation is great. The interaction between the good guys (however brief) lets us know exactly what they're like and what the chemistry between them is like. The two bad guys (the one who control water and the one who has that long scarf thingy -I forget their names) are sooooo cool. I only subtracted a star because I would have prefered to see less people die from suicide/selfdestruct/two for one kind of thing where both fighters perish together. The best deaths are the individual ones. And while the end is no surprise I love it. It's short, sweet, to the point and completely inevitable. The whole movie plays out like a greek tragedy. Their destinies foretold the brave warriors try to alter fate but find in doing so they actually end up making it happen. Great stuff. Yes, Tragic but great.

Just as the amazon.com reviewer stated, the plot of ""X"" is so simple, yet it is made extremely complicated by back and forth scene shifting, similar to a Quentin Tarantino film and too many characters. ""X"" is a rather dark film which has the overused, and generic plot which pits a man against the destruction of the entire world. The ""dragons"" are superior beings who battle each other throughout Tokyo. The dragons from earth, do not want to destroy the earth, but destroy the human race which they feel is destroying their earth. The dragons from heaven are sent to stop the earth dragons. The battles are often quick and become too repetitive. Many of the beings a.k.a. dragons have their own special power. The dragons from heaven create a shield each time they battle so the rest of the city does not get damaged. As the film slowly moves along, the last 20 minutes are a bloody mess, where most of the chracters parish in quick sequences. But by then I didn't care, I just wanted the film to end. The last scene is a sentimental sequence between a man and a body-less head! It supposed to be sad, but I found it rather amusing. Don't get me wrong, ""X"" isn't the worst Anime film, it's just average. My review may have pointed out all the negative, but the film did have it's positives.

I was at [a local music store] a long time ago, and saw this movie.  I'd heard a lot about it, so I decided, 'hey, why not?' and ponied up the 20 bucks for the priviledge of taking it home.  My first impression?  Perhaps this was the weapon the Pied Piper of Hamlin used to chase the children away (or did they go with him?), because after seeing this film, I was certainly left with a few vivid impressions, namely #1: Anime fans who like this [stuff] are into violence, and #2: those same said fans probably smoke...quite often.  The entire movie is vulgar and disgusting, going from bloodbath to bloodbath, with forgettable characters like ""that chick who gets blown up"" and ""that chick with weird super powers"" and ""that evil guy who thinks he's the good guy for reasons that I really don't want to know.""  Of course, it's not all blood and violence, thankfully, our beloved and benevolent animators decided to put in a bunch of Kamui (main character)'s hallucinations, which probably can be enjoyed best ...while listening to Pink Floyd.  These hallucinations make no coherent sense, nor are they explained at all throughout the flick, making me increasingly itchy that I spent [money] on the stupid thing.  Thankfully, the movie ends, though to no one's satisfaction, if you're into that silly thing about ""happy"" or ""sensical"" endings.

I tried reading those and they not only made little sense, but ultimatly left me in state of bordem.  However this anime compiles the mangas into one feature length movie that is very good, and well worth the price.The story revolves around a boy who returns to tokyo to protect his two friends from childhood.  His mother is dead (in a very gruesome manner) and he si destined to become one of two dragons, the dragons of heaven (white) or the dragon of Earth (red).  the dragons of heaven want to save mankind while the dragons of earht want to destroy them.  Neither one is really a villian because both have their good and bad qualites.  Each also has a good argument for their cause.  However there is piece of the puzzle left out, and that would be that the boy has a double that would counter his every move, and take up the other form.As you probably have seen by other reviews this recieved average at best.  Chances are is that those critics have read the mangas or are die hard fans of the Mangas.

It gets better the more you watch it, as many of the dream sequences show events at the end, that until you actually watch it through, don't make sense.  Kamui returns to Tokyo(from where we don't know)to meet up with his friends, a brother and sister.  Upon arriving he is confronted by two awesome powers: the dragon of earth and the dragon of heaven.  The dragon of heaven want to stop the dragon of earth from cleansing the world of people.  This leads to some amazing fight scenes between the unbelievably powerful members of each group as they both want to recruit Kamui for their cause.  I don't want to give away much more of the storyline but as it progresses, you definitely notice a yin-yang type atmosphere.  This is a extremely dark/gothic type anime that has the best art since Ninja Scroll.  Had the plot been more straight forward and less jumbled with confusing dream sequences and constant cutting between the various characters it would be a masterpiece of modern animation.
