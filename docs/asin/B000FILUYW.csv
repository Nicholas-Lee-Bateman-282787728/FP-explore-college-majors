991136,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000FILUYW,Gregor von Kallahann,"[14, 22]","You don't really need to be a neo-Freudian to understand why it is that we laugh at vulgar and downright dirty jokes.  Little kids wet themselves laughing about wetting themselves.  Bodily functions are just about the most hysterical thing going, right?  Well, for many people that's the case anyway. It's partly the liberating sensation of transgressing societal taboos.  And, on some level, it's also about to do with the body/mind duality and the absurdity that implies.We are told that we are made in the image of God--but we still have to eat, excrete and procreate.  We know that the human mind is capable of grasping profound philosophical truths, but we also know that the human body has its own agenda. And it's not always very tidy. It is, in short, the absurdity of the human condition.Or as Gilda Radner's Roseanne Roseannadanna persona might put it, ""Whoa! Did that come out of ME?""So a movie about what is likely the filthiest joke ever told has got to be cathartic on some level, n'est-ce pas?  Well, I was half-expecting it to be myself.  But while I sniggered here and there, I was surprised that I did not find this documentary to be as hysterical as it was cracked up to be.  Nor did I feel purged in any sense of the word.  Interesting certainly.  But in a surprisingly clinical sense of the word.Some have complained that this documentary is peopled mainly by second stringers in the comic world, Robin Williams, Chris Rock and Whoopi Goldberg notwithstanding. (And their contributions are minimal anyway, especially Rock who only provides a meager commentary.) But actually, if you follow TV and film comedy at all, most of the names here will be familiar, and many are quite respected, if not so much for their stand-up routines, as for the films and comedy series they have written and performed in.Besides, it really is kinda interesting to see comedians like Bob Saget bust out of their media personae and start ""working blue.""  Then you read up a bit more and discover that Saget really does work blue onstage (and away from the soundstage).  Reminds me of the time the wife and I went to see Soupy Sales live:  it was not the same Soupy we remembered from TV kiddy shows.So it's interesting viewing.  But the hype has actually been a bit much.  I had expected much more extended clips of performances of the joke than the ones we get here.  Even the notorious Gilbert Gottfried telling, which is supposed to be the film's highlight, is surprisingly brief.  If the various versions of this ancient joke really are the comic equivalent of a Coltrane improvisation, you can't really prove it by the movie.  There's more commentary than performance.  That makes for a moderately interesting documentary (on an admittedly touchy subject).  But it does not make for catharsis.",3,Gut Buster!,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,2798,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'be', 'neo-Freudian', 'understand', 'why', 'laugh', 'vulgar', 'downright', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'Little', 'kids', 'wet', 'laughing', 'wetting', 'Bodily', 'functions', 'are', 'just', 'most', 'hysterical', 'thing', 'going', 'right', 'Well', 'many', 'people', 'case', 'anyway', 'partly', 'liberating', 'sensation', 'transgressing', 'societal', 'taboos', 'level', 'also', 'about', 'do', 'body/mind', 'duality', 'absurdity', 'implies.We', 'are', 'told', 'are', 'made', 'image', 'God', 'still', 'have', 'eat', 'excrete', 'procreate', 'know', 'human', 'mind', 'capable', 'grasping', 'profound', 'philosophical', 'truths', 'also', 'know', 'human', 'body', 'own', 'agenda', 'not', 'always', 'very', 'tidy', 'short', 'absurdity', 'human', 'condition.Or', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'Roseanne', 'Roseannadanna', 'persona', 'might', 'put', 'Whoa', 'Did', 'come', 'ME', 'So', 'movie', 'what', 'likely', 'filthiest', 'joke', 'ever', 'told', 'got', 'be', 'cathartic', 'level', ""n'est-ce"", 'pas', 'Well', 'was', 'half-expecting', 'be', 'sniggered', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'documentary', 'be', 'as', 'hysterical', 'was', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'did', 'feel', 'purged', 'sense', 'word', 'Interesting', 'certainly', 'surprisingly', 'clinical', 'sense', 'word.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'documentary', 'peopled', 'mainly', 'second', 'stringers', 'comic', 'world', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'notwithstanding', 'contributions', 'are', 'minimal', 'anyway', 'especially', 'Rock', 'who', 'only', 'meager', 'commentary', 'actually', 'follow', 'TV', 'film', 'comedy', 'most', 'names', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'many', 'are', 'quite', 'respected', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'stand-up', 'routines', 'films', 'comedy', 'series', 'have', 'written', 'performed', 'in.Besides', 'really', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'see', 'comedians', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'media', 'personae', 'start', 'working', 'blue', 'Then', 'read', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'discover', 'Saget', 'really', 'work', 'blue', 'onstage', 'away', 'soundstage', 'time', 'wife', 'went', 'see', 'Soupy', 'Sales', 'live', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'Soupy', 'remembered', 'TV', 'kiddy', 'shows.So', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'hype', 'actually', 'been', 'bit', 'much', 'had', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'extended', 'clips', 'performances', 'joke', 'ones', 'get', 'here', 'Even', 'notorious', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'telling', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'highlight', 'surprisingly', 'brief', 'various', 'versions', 'ancient', 'joke', 'really', 'are', 'comic', 'equivalent', 'Coltrane', 'improvisation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'prove', 'movie', 'more', 'commentary', 'performance', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'admittedly', 'touchy', 'subject', 'not', 'make', 'catharsis']",N/A

991140,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000FILUYW,Peter Shermeta,"[25, 28]","A man walks into a talent agent's office to promote his family act. He describes for the agent what the act consists of and when asked what they call their act, the man says, ""The Aristocrats!""I know it doesn't look funny. It also has one of the weakest punch lines since the creation of humor, but that is not the point. The point is that for a story that lasts anywhere between 30 seconds and upwards of 15-20 minutes, it is not about the punch line.That is a joke that has been passed through the close circles of stand up comedy for generations. Comedians tell this joke when they get together with other comedians. Every veteran comedian not only has heard it at some point in their career, but now even has their own adaptation which they tell frequently, though never on stage. They go on to say that stand up comedy is not about jokes, it is about telling funny occurrences. Jokes are for hack comedians. Few exceptions have been made, one of which was Gilbert Gottfried at the Hugh Hefner Roast.Comedians Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette decided to make a documentary involving 100 of their friends; the biggest names in comedy. The idea was to have everyone talk about the aura surrounding this joke. Everyone knows it. Everyone has an opinion on it. Everyone has their own version. Some tell their version, some tell stories about the first time they've heard it. A few even offer variations on it.It doesn't matter who was talking (or in one case, miming) this movie was hysterical. Oh, one small disclaimer is that you may not like the movie if you are in any way offended by jokes about incest, familial abuse, urination, defecation, vomiting, bestiality...well the list goes on. It is these things that are used as components of the ""family act"" in the joke. Aside from that, there is nothing offensive in this movie...More shock value than in the joke itself comes in the delivery. The movie says it is the ""singing, not the song."" As the comedians are interviewed, some explain that the beauty of The Aristocrats is that you have complete creative license as joke teller to try and induce as much shock value as you can. It also tells a lot about who tells the joke as to how dirty their mind is.Take actors you have seen on television for years. Now place them in front of a handheld camcorder and ask them to tell you the dirtiest joke ever told. I know I didn't expect to hear some things from certain people. In some cases you associate the actor with the character they play(ed) on TV; a character that would not tell a joke that involves a stage act of freaky circus sex between a man and garden variety barnyard animals.A few specific moments stood out from the rest. As hinted above, The Aristocrats was told by many, but also performed by a mime. He was on the street at the time, his ""telling"" was perfect and my only have been rivaled by the looks on the faces of passers-by. Kevin Pollock probably did a better job of sounding like Christopher Walken than Christopher Walken would have when telling a version of the joke. And who could forget Bob Saget? He starts off admitting that he has a reputation in the industry as being a dirty comic, which you do not expect to hear from Danny Tanner. I will leave it at that.ALL of the biggest names were present in this documentary. Robin Williams, George Carlin, Phyllis Diller, Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Jeni, Richard Lewis, Gilbert Gottfried...well you get the idea. But if you are curious, the full cast listing is available here. I did think that there may be some hesitation on part of some of the comedians to participate in a publicizing of this unique staple to the laughter industry, but everyone seemed eager to participate. The Aristocrats brings people together. It was fascinating to see such big stars humbled by their own thoughts of something as simple as one joke. The sincerity with which they spoke about The Aristocrats was amazing.For once I did not stick out nearly as much as usual in a theater for a funny movie. I have this bad habit of laughing out loud. Couple that with a decent set of lungs, I can get pretty obnoxious. I apologize to everyone who has ever been there for it and all of you whose experience(s) lie ahead. Last night was not so awkward, though. Everyone was laughing out loud. All inhibitions about being loud were left at the door. You could not help but belt out with laughter at this movie.To somewhat of a surprise, no one (that I noticed) got up and left the theater. I am glad that no one was so deeply offended by the content that they had to leave, even though there is something to be said for a movie that can be so funny and so offensive at the same time that maybe at least one husband and wife complete with teenage daughter walk out (Team America - World Police). The theater in which I saw the movie was mostly filled with older viewers though, there were no children. And yes, The Aristocrats is more offensive than Team America. Much more.I already have plans to see it in the theater a second time.",5,Better than I could have imagined.,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,5032,"['man', 'talent', 'agent', 'office', 'promote',

991141,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000FILUYW,Robert Moore,"[66, 70]","WARNING:  Spoilers galore and discussion of off color topics.First, it has to be emphasized to anyone contemplating seeing this film that it without any question contains more offensive language than any other general release film in American history.  If you are offended by graphic descriptions of every conceivable form of sexual perversion including incest and bestiality or by the most extreme descriptions of scatological activity, you really should pass on this one in favor of another film.  That being said, this is without question one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and the preview audition I saw it with was laughing loudly from beginning to end.""The Aristocrats"" is, we are told near the beginning of the film, a joke that comedians often tell one another.  In basic outline, it is quite simple.  The basic elements are a man walking into a talent scout's office and telling him that he has a great act, and then describes a performance in which the man and his wife and children and other relatives, including the family dog, come onstage and perform some bizarre combination of sexual, incestuous, scatological, bestial, and murderous acts.  After a long catalog of acts straight out of the Marquis de Sade, the scout then asks what they call themselves, to which the man replies, ""The Aristocrats.""  The joke--admittedly not a very good one--is the extreme contrast between the barbarity and outrageousness of the acts, and the man having the gall to imagine that their actions could in any sense be aristocratic.  This is not a joke that many comedians tell in public; it is simply too nasty, too extreme.  It is, instead, a bit of a test that comedians take in front of other comedians, to see if they have a right to respect among their peers.As the movie progresses, it becomes obvious that the challenge for comedians is to come up with some new variation of the joke that allows them some claim of originality.  It is like a chess problem that requires some new resolution.  Or, to put it in another sense, a comedian telling the joke anew is like a gunfighter taking on all previous gunslingers, creating a reputation for themselves.  And indeed, as the movie goes along, a number of comedians do manage new variants that are increasingly surprising.  Though obscene throughout, the film ends up being almost an academic, anthropological study of the nature and possibilities of humor.A vast number (I read somewhere that a hundred comics participate) of well known and lesser known comedians appear in the film, from such prominent stand ups as Robin Williams and George Carlin to a host of unknowns, as well as older veterans such as Larry Storch and Tim Conway.  A number provide their own retellings of the joke, with some being more successful than others.  Although there are many quite hysterical versions of the joke, I thought four stood out.  The best, in my opinion, was shockingly that of Bob Saggett of FULL HOUSE.  His version is unique in that as he tells it, he feigns shock that he is doing so, and seems momentarily to have doubts as to its wisdom, hesitates, and then plunges right back into the joke.  Very nearly as good is a somewhat less nasty, more cerebral version by Martin Mull, with the best punch line of the movie.  No one hates mimes more than I do, but a mime I did not previously know called Bill the Mime performed a brilliantly obscene mime version of the joke.  Finally, a truly awful ventriloquist (his mouth moved almost normally throughout) with a badly constructed puppet told the joke very ineptly, only to have his puppet jump in and show him the way it should be done.

It's really about the art of telling a joke. It's about the philosophy of comedy, of transgression, of challenging the rules of ""polite society"" as comics have done for centuries, about how the human mind works, how men and women see humor differently, about what we find funny, what surprises us, what revolts us, and more to the point, what DOESN'T revolt us even if it seems it should. And to discuss all these topics, the film makers have assembled a top flight group -- stand-up comedians, comedic actors, writers, and others, from old-time comics to the youngest and hippest new talents (is anyone funnier than Sarah Silverman when she really gets going?).It's a free turtorial in how comedy works, as we watch a large and diverse group of artists tell this same joke in dozens of different ways, with many different set-ups, many different payoffs, and more ways of exploring the middle of the joke (some compare it to an improvised jazz solo) than you could ever imagine. We see how men and women emphasize different things, how the younger comics make it more sexual and the older comics make it more scatalogical. Somebody could teach a semster course on this...It's a smart, insightful film about America and the American sense of humor, and about the real ""us"" that we rarely show the rest of the world.

It's not all that funny when someone makes jokes out of unspeakable acts.  They're not unspeakable.The premise of the ""Aristocrats"" is that a single ""inside"" joke of comedians can be told a thousand ways and 100 of them proceed to do so.  It's moderately entertaining and occasionally clever. The comedians enjoy themselves talking about their craft and experimenting with it.  They love being bad boys (and girls) but that part of the movie doesn't come over because what they're doing isn't all that controversial.  If they're so fearless and so determined to offend, why don't they tell nasty jokes about sacrosanct ethnic groups?

First of all the film DOES have its moments that had me aching with laughter, specifically Billy The Mime, South Park, and The Joke as told with a deck of cards. Those segments had me screaming really, really hard. The rest of it was so-so. What was interesting was after the film (shot on videotape, in 4:3 mode), being able to listen to ""Provenz"" talk about what we'd just seen. He was amiable enough, but his Q & A felt like SHTICK. It was strange to hear these GIANT guffaws of laughter emanating from the back of the theater. When I took a look back to see who it was - well, what do you know - it was his team of associates and friends. I soon realized it was PHONY LAUGHTER, the kind you hear at comedy clubs employed by the guy on stage to bolster his ""cred"" - HAR! HAR! HAR!! THIS GUY'S SO FUNNY, I'M ABOUT TO PUKE! AWW, DUDE, I'M LOSIN' IT, THIS GUY'S F____N' HILARIOUS!! HAR! HAR! HAR!! AIN'T HE GREAT? HAR! HAR! HAR!. I mean, I can't fault him for it from a business standpoint. Having ""plants"" in the crowd, using them to goad the rest of the audience into thinking this is the greatest experience of their lives - that goes on all the time, but at this screening it was particularly obvious. Provenz acted very strange when someone asked him why Gallagher wasn't included among the 100 comics. He made disparaging comments toward him that made you think there was some bad blood between them. Wonder what the story is behind THAT.
