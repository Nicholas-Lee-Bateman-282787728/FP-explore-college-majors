487001,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,7799437278,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Soul Surfer, 2011 film""This is based on a true story."" A girl is born to parents who surfed; what is her destiny? She had two older brothers and learned to compete. She grew up in Hawaii next to the ocean. [No mention of a daily job.] Skateboards are another hobby. There is competition to be better. [Note the product placement in these scenes.] Can people make sense of things when they only see part of a picture? Bethany avoids a trip to stay in training. [Job over pleasure?] Her mother says ""it's your call"". [No parental advice?] The girls go surfing at night. [Did they ever read a book on shark attacks?] Fireworks at night. They are home-schooled. ""Why didn't you ask?"" There is more surfing in beautiful weather. The sudden attack is unexpected. ""Get to the reef!"" Her left arm is gone!They meet the ambulance on the highway, transfer the patient, and rush to the hospital. Bethany survives but will have to relearn a lot of things. ""When can I surf again?"" There is anger and conflict in the family. Television news has this story (""if it bleeds, it leads""). Bethany yearns to return to surfing. At home she finds journalists with cameras to exploit this news. ""We'll take it day by day."" A TV show will pay for a prosthetic arm in return for an interview. She learns of the disadvantages. Its healing nice. ""I don't understand."" Later a shark was caught. ""It's a perfect fit."" [About eleven feet long?]Life goes on for Alanna and Bethany. At home Bethany prepares orange juice for the family. She returns to the ocean to relearn surfing. Later she puts on the prosthetic arm and finds problems. ""People like normal."" Bethany continues to practice surfing. She enters a surfing tournament. There is a big wave that causes a problem. A broken board ends her competition. ""I can't do this anymore."" She meets her fans and gives them a present."" ""It's over."" Will she ever be the same? There is more to life than surfing.Volunteers go to Thailand where a tidal wave destroyed people and homes. They pass out bags of rice. They hear of the disaster. Bad memories. They serve food to the hungry. Bethany uses a surf board to help children play in the ocean. She learns there is more to life than surfing. Back home Bethany gets fan mail. A board with a handle allows Bethany to compete again. Exercise strengthens her muscles.The ""Rip Curl"" National Tournament is held in Hawaii. Bethany enters against strong competition. They paddle out into the ocean. The contest is very close, and may be over. Then a wave appears! Can they count it? No, it was after the horn. But it counts for Bethany. ""Nobody is as tough as you."" Bethany lives to surf, in spite of the drawbacks. The ending credits show the real Bethany Hamilton, and others. This shark attack occurred in 2003 when Bethany was thirteen. She later wrote a book about her life. This movie seems to have downplayed her religious life.

She is one of those people who refuse to let anything get in their way - either physically or mentally. There have been countless people like her who not only overcame a tragedy - but went on to do truly amazing things. I believe that it's not what you go through - it's how you go through it - that will either make or break you.I cried quite a few times while watching this. Her range of emotions following a sudden ""disability"" that threatened to limit her great aspirations reminded me of my husband. He lost his vision 26 years ago, and then was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma shortly after that. He beat it like a champ, and was back to work the minute he was able. He pushed forward and excelled despite on-going, life-threatening health issues. He rarely complained or felt sorry for himself, but when he did he'd actually apologize, feel horrible about it and then resolve himself to use his unique experiences to do something inspiring and positive.Last year he survived non-Hodgkins lymphoma and B-cell follicular cancer by undergoing a stem cell transplant. His body had been through so much for so long, and that ordeal was nothing short of a living hell for him. The radiation he received at age 19 caused second and third degree burns from head to toe due to the radical chemotherapy that was necessary to save him at age 45. ""Radiation recall"" often leads to death because it is similar to being severely burned by a fire ... and in his case it was both internally and externally.But he trudged through it and jumped right back into his music career three months after the transplant. Last night, a little over a year later, his band opened for a nationally acclaimed act and the show was sold out.NEVER GIVE UP!",5,TRULY INSPIRING!,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1836,"['Break', 'out', 'Kleenex', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'should', 'be', 'inspiration', 'anyone', 'who', 'story', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'refuse', 'let', 'anything', 'get', 'way', 'physically', 'mentally', 'have', 'been', 'countless', 'people', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'overcame', 'tragedy', 'went', 'do', 'truly', 'amazing', 'things', 'believe', 'not', 'what', 'go', 'how', 'go', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'you.I', 'cried', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'watching', 'range', 'emotions', 'following', 'sudden', 'disability', 'threatened', 'limit', 'great', 'aspirations', 'reminded', 'husband', 'lost', 'vision', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'advanced', 'Hodgkin', 'lymphoma', 'shortly', 'beat', 'champ', 'was', 'back', 'work', 'minute', 'was', 'able', 'pushed', 'forward', 'excelled', 'on-going', 'life-threatening', 'health', 'issues', 'rarely', 'complained', 'felt', 'sorry', 'when', 'did', ""'d"", 'actually', 'apologize', 'feel', 'horrible', 'then', 'resolve', 'use', 'unique', 'experiences', 'do', 'something', 'inspiring', 'positive.Last', 'year', 'survived', 'non-Hodgkins', 'lymphoma', 'B-cell', 'follicular', 'cancer', 'undergoing', 'stem', 'cell', 'transplant', 'body', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'long', 'ordeal', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'living', 'hell', 'radiation', 'received', 'age', '19', 'caused', 'second', 'third', 'degree', 'burns', 'head', 'toe', 'due', 'radical', 'chemotherapy', 'was', 'necessary', 'save', 'age', '45', 'Radiation', 'recall', 'often', 'death', 'similar', 'being', 'severely', 'burned', 'fire', 'case', 'was', 'internally', 'externally.But', 'trudged', 'jumped', 'right', 'back', 'music', 'career', 'three', 'months', 'transplant', 'Last', 'night', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'later', 'band', 'opened', 'nationally', 'acclaimed', 'act', 'show', 'was', 'sold', 'out.NEVER', 'GIVE', 'UP']",Soul Surfer (2011)

Sharks scare me to death and I hardly go in to the ocean, and here she was bitten by one and didn't let it stop her! I thought Annasophia Robb did an amazing acting job and I really enjoyed Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid (he's one of my favorites!)

I cringed whenever she came on but at least that wasn't too much. Stick to singing, Carrie! All in all, worth the time!

487007,AE9V37MS6QY8D,7799437278,amerdale876,"[2, 2]","Ever since I saw the trailer for this film, I've wanted to see it. It's got great actors in it and I remember when I heard in the news about the true story of Bethany Hamilton being attacked in 2003 and losing an arm. Some may be put off by the fact that this film does have a strong presence of Christianity in it. And most would be correct to feel that way as films made with Christianity as its base (i.e.Fireproof [Blu-ray] andFacing the Giants [Blu-ray]) have been a little too cheesy and/or too preachy. I'm not much of a religious person, but with films likeTo Save a Life [Blu-ray] and especially this one being released, the film production is improving. Don't get me wrong, though, just because this film does have Christianity as just one of its facets, it's not what the entire film revolves around. ""Soul Surfer"" hits all the right marks in acting (well, except maybe Carrie Underwood; one can tell she's not a professional actress and it should stay that way), direction (by surfer Sean McNamara), story, pacing, setting, and -- most important with a film like this -- surfing. Hunt, Quaid and Sorbo all give great performances, but the best here -- as it should be -- is AnnaSophia Robb. This film proves that she is star material! The film is inspirational, showcasing the potential of the best in people. It sort of reminds me of that famously great quote from Jor-El to his son Kal-El (Superman) in the originalSuperman - The Movie [Blu-ray]: ""They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way."" Bethany Hamilton wishes to be that ""light"" to show people she meets ""the way.""

Hamilton's faith is obviously worn on her sleeve, but there's no preachy stretches or anything that feels out of place, with director Sean McNamara handling both the movie's land-based domestic drama and surfing sequences effectively. Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid are superb as Hamilton's understanding parents; John R.

487011,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,7799437278,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 19]","Honestly, I'm not sure what is worse; having your arm bitten off by a shark or having this movie made about the incident.  While her story in itself is certainly inspirational, there is VERY little about `Soul Surfer' that is truly inspired.  Instead, the film teeters on ridiculous while it heaps clich&eacute; upon clich&eacute; on a story that should have been told a lot better.`Soul Surfer' comes across like a television movie produced and (possibly) directed by Kirk Cameron.  I understand that God and his presence had a lot of influence on Bethany's life, but the way in which it is broached comes across very stagey and awkward.  The poor directorial choices make light of a serious subject and almost make the film's pivotal scenes come across somewhat unintentionally funny.Yes, I laughed and I feel like a terrible person because of it.Bethany's story is a very courageous one.  At the age of 13, and on the brink of becoming a Professional Surfer, Bethany suffered a serious injury as a result of an unexpected shark attack.  She lost her left arm.  Because of this attack, Bethany almost lost everything.  She almost lost her life, but it was her future that pressed on her the tightest.  She had to relearn everything, but she was determined to surf her heart out and she did.The film could have grounded itself better into taking a serious look at the effect the shark attack had on young Bethany, but instead the film seems to intent on creating yet another teen flick.  The inclusion of a heartless competitor (I mean, anyone who would despise or antagonize a young girl who just lost her arm deserves a punch in the face) was a preposterous attempt to create some drama that wasn't needed since the subject itself presented enough drama (although it wasn't handled well enough to play off that drama).  The acting all around was pretty mediocre, but Carrie Underwood takes the cake as a singer (who I love BTW) who should really stay away from acting.  AnnaSophia Robb is the only standout here (Quaid and Hunt who are usually solid suffer at the melodramatic lines they are given), delivering a remarkably astute performance that feels genuine, most of the time.Anyways, I would highly recommend watching some of the interviews with Bethany, for her story and her courageous rebound is beyond words inspiring; but skip this movie because it fails on nearly every level.",1,Poor Bethany Hamilton...,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2390,"['Honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'worse', 'having', 'arm', 'bitten', 'off', 'shark', 'having', 'movie', 'made', 'incident', 'story', 'certainly', 'inspirational', 'VERY', 'little', 'Soul', 'Surfer', 'truly', 'inspired', 'Instead', 'film', 'teeters', 'ridiculous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'lot', 'better.', 'Soul', 'Surfer', 'television', 'movie', 'produced', 'possibly', 'directed', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'understand', 'God', 'presence', 'had', 'lot', 'influence', 'Bethany', 'life', 'way', 'broached', 'very', 'stagey', 'awkward', 'poor', 'directorial', 'choices', 'make', 'light', 'serious', 'subject', 'almost', 'make', 'film', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'come', 'somewhat', 'unintentionally', 'funny.Yes', 'laughed', 'feel', 'terrible', 'person', 'it.Bethany', 'story', 'very', 'courageous', 'one', 'age', '13', 'brink', 'becoming', 'Professional', 'Surfer', 'Bethany', 'suffered', 'serious', 'injury', 'result', 'unexpected', 'shark', 'attack', 'lost', 'left', 'arm', 'attack', 'Bethany', 'almost', 'lost', 'everything', 'almost', 'lost', 'life', 'was', 'future', 'pressed', 'tightest', 'had', 'relearn', 'everything', 'was', 'determined', 'surf', 'heart', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'grounded', 'better', 'taking', 'serious', 'look', 'effect', 'shark', 'attack', 'had', 'young', 'Bethany', 'instead', 'film', 'intent', 'creating', 'yet', 'teen', 'flick', 'inclusion', 'heartless', 'competitor', 'mean', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'despise', 'antagonize', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'arm', 'punch', 'face', 'was', 'preposterous', 'attempt', 'create', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'subject', 'presented', 'enough', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'handled', 'well', 'enough', 'play', 'off', 'drama', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'cake', 'singer', 'who', 'love', 'BTW', 'who', 'should', 'really', 'stay', 'away', 'acting', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'only', 'standout', 'here', 'Quaid', 'Hunt', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'solid', 'suffer', 'melodramatic', 'lines', 'are', 'given', 'delivering', 'remarkably', 'astute', 'performance', 'genuine', 'most', 'time.Anyways', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'interviews', 'Bethany', 'story', 'courageous', 'rebound', 'words', 'inspiring', 'skip', 'movie', 'nearly', 'level']",Soul Surfer (2011)

I knew of the story of Bethany Hamilton, because I remember when the shark attack on her happened. I was half expecting this to be a extremely sad and depressing film, which I don't enjoy watching. This film is far from that though. Despite the tragic event it's based on, the film is very uplifting, has a lot of heart, and yet it's entertaining. It's been a few days since I watched it, but the film still remains in my mind. Few films have that lasting effect on me. I was quite touched by the closeness of the Hamilton Family too, and Bethany's beautiful outlook on people and life.It's pretty clear now that the religious message of the film, and the families reliance on religion, has rubbed a few reveiwers the wrong way. As a guy who hasn't taken a step inside a church in years, and who still has no plans to anytime soon, I'm quite perplexed by the negative reactions. First of all, the film is about a person and a family that is deeply religious. Religion, like it or not, clearly plays a huge part in these people everyday lives. And I don't think Bethany ever claimed to be perfect. Sure she defied her parents by going out late before the attack, but she was still very young and still a kid. I think people need to lighten-up with that. I didn't think the film tried to knock-me-over-the-head with religion, it was just a part of who the family is and how they chose to deal with a tragedy that may have left a majority of people in a funk for years and years. Heck that's the one part of religion I actually respect. I mean I can be as cynical as anyone, but this seemed a story as much about love and perseverance as anything else.

(Although the Hamilton family had to pressure the producers into instilling more of their Christian values than what was wanted) But there will always be people who have to make something bad out of a light-hearted, inspirational film like this--especially considering the source of the inspiration. Bethany sets a great example for young people with her sweetness, positive outlook and faith. She is not perfect: she demonstrates this with some slight snarkiness toward her adversary Molina (although much provoked) Also she sneaks out of the house to go night-surfing knowing her parents probably would not agree to it. This basically amounts to dishonesty and disobedience. But this shows realism rather than idealism; Christian children do sin. There is also a scene in the hospital cafeteria where angry words are exchanged between Bethany's family. This is actually a good lesson to those who feel Christian families are always shown in an unflawed, squeaky-clean light. They are as real as anyone. And although the family's faith is well-emphasized, it is not overdone to the point that it should turn off nonbelievers.

At the age of thirteen, on the cusp of great things as an aspiring pro surfer, she lost her left arm in a tragic shark attack. Many of us would've given up on our dreams then and there. Bethany didn't. Grounded in her faith and family, her story made the international news in 2003. She even wrote a book about her experience, aptly titled Soul Surfer.Now eight years later the movie of the same name is out and telling even more of her story, including some of Bethany's struggles and doubts after the accident. Starring AnnaSophia Robb as Bethany, Soul Surfer the movie isn't just another beating-the-odds sports flick. It's an incredible and inspiring story of a young girl who triumphed over adversity. Knowing these events really happened makes everything mean more.With a terrific cast giving spot on performances, Soul Surfer exceeded my expecations. Dennis Quaid as Bethany's father shows the depth of his acting skills, believably playing a fun-loving guy one minute, a devestated father ready to fall apart the next. The same is true for Helen Hunt as Bethany's mom, Cheri. In several scenes her deep, motherly emotions were palpable, and yet she hadn't said a word. AnnaSophia Robb gives one of her best performances in this role, every bit as heartfelt as you'd hope. A case could be made that supporting cast member Carrie Underwood as Sarah Hill, Bethany's youth leader, was possibly the weakest link in the acting department. She had the tendency to overact a little in her scenes, but you couldn't help liking her anyway as her character came across genuine and caring.It's fascinating how the filmmakers were able to make it appear as if Robb herself was actually missing an arm. She had to wear a green sleeve during the shooting, holding her arm behind her back, but it's almost eery how realistic it appears. Filmed on location in Hawaii, Hamilton herself was Robb's stunt double for the difficult surfing scenes.There's so much to take away from this story, but what's most refreshing is how the filmmakers didn't water down the Hamiltons' faith. Which isn't to say it's a preachy story; not at all. The message of relying on God and His strength flowed as naturally through the movie as the Hawaiian waves. The love the Hamilton family has for each other is touching. Soul Surfer would be a fantastic movie to watch with your youth group, but all ages will find something to enjoy. This is one you'll want to watch more than once.MPAA Rating: PG - the shark attack scene could be disturbing for young children.--Reviewed by C.J.

I was curious as to how you even begin to grasp being able to do just do the simple things, like put your hair in a ponytail, hook your bikini top, slice a tomato....you know, the normal things that you take for granted, until you aren't able to do those things without a huge undertaking.  Bethany's attack by the shark while out surfing with friends is very close to the beginning of the movie, so much of the movie his how she has doubts, how it isn't easy and though she is determined, how she isn't sure she will be able to come back to surf at all, much less compete.Before I read other comments I would not have felt that this movie was overly religious or preachy.  Yes she is in a youth ministry, and like most of us, wonders why obstacles are put in her place or why bad things happen to good people.  For many, faith, whether in one's self, God, or a higher power gets people through, I certainly don't have a problem with the few times that she mentioned her faith.  It didn't detract from the movie for me or make me feel that anything was being pushed at me.This is a good movie that aside from the shark attack, where it would be too scary for small kids, shows kids (all ages) that you can achieve if you set your mind to it, are willing to put everything into it and have faith in yourself.Overall an excellent movie with real shots of Bethany and her amazing family at the end.

487049,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,7799437278,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","""Soul Surfer"" is an inspiring film based on the true story of Bethany Hamilton, an American professional surfer who's life was changed after a shark attack in which she lost her left her arm.Without her arm and media coverage from all over the world, many witnessed Bethany Hamilton return to surfing but also to compete professionally not long after her accident.  And as simple as the story may seem, many things happened during those darker days of her life of whether or not she can function without an arm, if she can ever surf again but most importantly, what made her survive the entire ordeal.""Soul Surfer"" is a film adaptation directed by Sean McNamara (producer and director of teen TV series ""Beyond the Break"" and ""That's So Raven"") of Bethany Hamilton's book about her life, what happened during the day of the accident and what happened afterward.The film begins in Kauai, Hawaii where Bethany (played by Anna SophiaRobb, ""Bridge of Terabithia"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Jumper"") is a normal teenage girl who loves to surf.  She hangs out with her best friend, fellow professional surfer Alana Blanchard (played by Lorraine Nicholson, ""Click, ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""World's Greatest Dad"") and for both teenagers, their dream is to become professional surfers.But Bethany, her life is all about surfing...every day and every minute that she free time, she's surfing.Bethany lives with her surfing family which includes her father Tom (played by Dennis Quaid), her mother Cheri (played by Helen Hunt) and her brothers Noah (played by Ross Thomas) and Tim (played by Chris Brochu).  The family is Christian and Bethany is also active with her church youth group headed by Sarah Hill (played by Carrie Underwood).For Bethany, life is going very well and with a good showing at a competition, both she and Alana are sponsored by Rip Curl and both are looking forward to competing at the Regionals.But one day, Bethany went out to do some morning surfing with Alana, her father Holt (played by Kevin Sorbo) and Alana's younger brother at Tunnels Beach and while out the ocean and talking with Alana while lying on her surfboard, a tiger shark attacks Bethany, ripping out her left arm.Having lost 60% of her blood and thanks to the quick thinking of the Holt family and the medical services, Bethany was saved but her life would never be the same after the loss of her left arm.The film would focus on the difficulties that Bethany would have with one arm but also her desire to surf once again.  But most importantly, how her faith in God and the support that she has received from family, friends and those who were inspired by her story to surf again, made her stronger and made her continue to compete as a professional surfer.VIDEO:""Soul Surfer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  And once again, ""Soul Surfer"" is another film shot in Hawaii that continues my validation of how films shot at the island have looked vibrant and beautiful on Blu-ray.The film features a good layer of grain but its the colors that are so striking.  There is a good amount of detail, the cinematography in and out of the waves are just beautiful to watch and skin tones are natural and overall look of the film is warm.Personally, I felt that ""Soul Surfer"" looked fantastic on Blu-ray.  I didn't see any artifacts, nor did I see any banding, especially since this film is full of color.  Black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, PQ is absolutely pleasing and wonderful on Blu!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Soul Surfer"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and comes with an English audio descriptive track.  The lossless audio for ""Soul Surfer"" is primarily dialogue and music-driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear and although there are not many action sequences, aside from Bethany's parents trying to escape from the media or hearing the waves crashing (which do sound very good), the film is not the type of film to expect immersive audio but for this type of film, the lossless soundtrack works wonderfully.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Soul Surfer"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes  - (3:48) A total of eight deleted scenes.The Making of Soul Surfer - (12:47) The making of the film, the casting of the talent, bringing in the Hamilton family to help along with the film and also Bethany's input but also the challenges the film crew faced during shooting and more.Surfing for the Screen: Inside the Action - (5:28) In order to make the film authentic and not be fake, the actual talent of the film were trained on how to surf.Becoming Bethany - (3:42) AnnaSophia Robb and Bethany Hamilton talk about meeting each other and how Robb got to learn a lot from Bethany during the making of the film.Heart of a Soul Surfer Documentary - (30:31) A documentary of Bethany Hamilton's upbringing, how she became a surfer, the day she lost her arm and interviews with family and friends who talk about Bethany's dedication to her faith and more.Bethany Hamilton On Professional Surfing - (4:54) A featurette showcasing Bethany Hamilton surfing various waves.EXTRAS:""Soul Surfer"" comes with a DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Bethany Hamilton is a hero.She inspires people with her life as a professional surfer despite having one arm, she inspires people because of her calmness and her resolve to helping others because of her faith in God and how her determination to compete with other professional surfers and not willing to be treated any differently.Hamilton's story has been featured in the news, she won the ""Best Comeback Athlete ESPY Award, the ""Courage Award"" at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards and eventually in her career, taking first place in the 2005 National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) National Championships, competing full-time on the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) and also for the WQS (World Qualifying Series).As a surfer and also a person who has followed Bethany Hamilton's progress since the accident, I couldn't wait to watch ""Soul Surfer"".  Sure, we know of how inspirational her story is from various news segments and interviews done with Bethany Hamilton and of course, there is also her book that she wrote.But sometimes, it helps people to see things visually on how Bethany was able to overcome a lot of the things in her life and that is because of her faith in God.For me, watching ""Soul Surfer"" was pretty cool in the fact that the filmmakers wanted to make a film that was authentic.  Part of the problems that many people dislike about surfing films is their unrealistic portrayal of them and seeing a body double that looks nothing like the character.  The other is shoddy acting.First, lets talk about the acting.With ""Soul Surfer"", you have a talented actress with AnnaSophia Robb, granted, in real life, she is much shorter than Bethany but onscreen, viewers will probably not even care. Her performance was well-done!But possibly one of the best things about this film is the casting.  You have two star talents with Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt playing the parents of Bethany and also, you have Carrie Underwood also playing an acting role.  Granted, she a newbie in the field of acting but the fact that this film was able to secure these three talents is pretty awesome.But the next thing that made the film so much enjoyable is the fact that the filmmakers knew the criticism of surfing films and so they wanted to make sure the talent knew how to surf and they were filmed surfing.  So, AnnaSophia Robb, under the tutelage of Bethany's coach, learned to surf for a month, picked up quickly and started surfing each time she had a chance.As for Bethany's parents who love to surf, Helen Hunt knows how to surf but Dennis Quaid also went through training and enjoyed surfing as well.There is some awesome cinematography featured in the film and as mentioned, the acting is very well-done.But I know that for some people who have criticized this film, it's about how the film showcases Bethany's faith in God.It its important to note that for Bethany and her family, their faith is a big part of them as individuals and how they live their lives.  It was also instrumental in what brought them together during those darker moments but most importantly what made Bethany a stronger individual.  And a big reason of why she was able to surf again.And while the film does focus on faith, the filmmakers know that there must be a compromise of how they can also reach a mass audience and not to deluge non-religious viewers by not overly focusing on the religious topics.So, with that being said, the most you are going to see of any religion on film is when the film goes into Bethany attending her youth group or going to church (which are very short scenes) and when she goes to Thailand with her youth group to help those who were devastated by the tsunami.  But even those scenes, they are not preachy nor forcing religion in anyone's throats.If anything, the more discussion of faith especially Bethany's faith in God is mostly featured on the special features in the Blu-ray release.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic!  I've been on the record of saying how outdoor shots, especially in Hawaii have looked fantastic on Blu-ray and that goes the same for ""Soul Surfer"". This is a beautiful film on Blu-ray and colors are vibrant.  The lossless audio is primarily dialogue and musically driven but there are good moments of hearing constant wave crashing that sounds very good on Blu-ray.  Granted, it would have been even better to give the wave crashing sounds a more immersive soundscape through all channels but for the most part, the soundtrack is appropriate for this film.  And of course, there are a good number of special features included on the Blu-ray.Overall, there is really nothing negative to say about this film.  It's a straightforward film about Bethany, her darker days and her return to surfing and competing and as a person who has been inspired by Bethany Hamilton's story and now watching that story on film, I was pretty impressed by the film.  Inspiring, entertaining and yes, even brought me to tears a few times during the film.""Soul Surfer"" is definitely recommended!",5,Blu-ray (4.5 stars): I was deeply touched and inspired by this film.  Definitely a family film worth watching!,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,10329,"['Soul', 'Surfer', 'inspiring', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'American', 'professional',

The performances in particular and the movie as a whole were stellar. If you have a warmth of heart, it will be thoroughly engaged. At first my wife didn't want to see the movie at all because she knew that she would be crying throughout most of it (being a protective mom/grandma and a teary tender-heart), but after our daughters previewed it, they finally convinced their mom that overall the movie and true story are ultimately uplifting. A triumph over great difficulties. A story of faith, love, support and courage. My wife ended up watching the movie with tears throughout and after the tragedy, yes, but ended feeling positive and nurtured because of the way this amazing girl and her family handled everything and have forged forward to give of themselves to others around the world.

We also get to see Bethany visiting a poor Asian country where she discovered that she had more to give to the world, and that there was no reason to give her dream of being a top woman surfer. Stressing on Bethany's trials and seeing her family support her makes it a good inspirational movie for all ages. No doubt that kids of her age may see in it a movie with an optimistic and necessary message. One thing that I liked about it was that in spite of being inspirational, it didn't rely on sentimental tear-jerking scenes. We never feel sorry for her, even when she's struggling to get to the beach after the shark attacks her. On the contrary, we get to see in film the whole process of her pain, her family's pain, eventual emotional recovery, and finally, success.I confess, however, that I liked the book better because it gives you a lot of details about Bethany's parents and her relationship with her brothers, which have a great influence on her courageous nature. Bethany had a lot to say. But maybe I'm being ungenerous considering that films have greater limitations in time than the book form.

487056,A1CHM200OEN65X,7799437278,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[3, 4]","Most of us have heard of Bethany Hamilton, or at least of the surfer girl who lost her arm to a shark off the coast of Kauai. Fewer people know that she came from a Christian family, and that her faith played a huge part in her overcoming this obstacle and continuing on to become a national surf champion.""Soul Surfer"" features Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as the parents, and AnnaSophia Robb (from ""Bridge to Terebithia"") does a great job in the role of Bethany. The film starts with some scenes establishing her family's faith and their playful fun together. All of them have surfing background and interest, and their lives on the Hawaiian Islands are portrayed in heartwarming ways that only add to the coming terror. The movie gives us some great surfing scenes, some beautiful photography, and when it reaches the moment of the shark attack, we are fully engaged. Although restrained in its showing of the violence, it captures the horrible feeling of loss, fear, and parental anxiety.Soon, Bethany is questioning God's plan in all this, since her surfing days could be over. She wonders how she'll ever find a guy who will love her with only one arm. And she watches her best friend be featured in Rip Curl promotions, while she stands on the sidelines and bravely supports her. She also struggles with media attention, not to mention the expected challenges of cutting oranges and putting on her own clothes. The special effects are well done, and we feel the anguish of not only Bethany, but of her parents as well. They are strong in their faith, but they are not perfect, and each member of the family has an issue to deal with, whether its the father's desire to push his daughter back into surfing, or the mother's desire to help her daughter accept her new physical appearance as one of true beauty. We also have Carrie Underwood playing the role of Bethany's youth pastor, there to offer hugs, love, advice, and a life-changing trip to Thailand after the devastating tsunami.For those who find any of this cheesy or too easy, they are missing the point. This is based on a true story. It's not pie-in-the-sky answers given in a fictitious setting, but the real-life struggles of the Hamiltons, and how God sustained them through some tough times. Bethany's own answers to the reporters are often word-for-word from actual interviews, where she gave impromptu responses. With even Roger Ebert giving this movie a good review, it's hard to imagine why some viewers seem to have an ax to grind with the faith element. While some movies are nothing more than sermons tacked onto a weak story, this is a strong story that would be inspiring even if it weren't Christian-based, but becomes that much more intriguing when rooted in biblical wisdom.This movie is well-acted, full of excitement, humor, and a number of emotionally stirring moments, when inspiration can be found in the human will to live and move on, and even more so in the solid faith that can sustain even the hardest of blows when a life, even a teenage girl's life, is surrendered to God. My own teen daughters loved this story, as did my wife. It's not only the best Christian movie I've seen, but one of the best sports movies I've seen.

Bethany Hamilton's story of loosing her arm while surfing was world news, then a book, and now done in film form. It's an amazing story of one girl, her family, her friends, her church, and what can be accomplished not only through recovery but a continuing life of giving others an outlook of HOPE. She is one remarkable girl, a must-see film. The DVDs has a warning about the intense accident scene but it is actually not that bad. Of course there are lots of heavenly panoramas since the film is shot in Hawaii.Regardless of faith preference, Bethany has to give others with similar struggles a leap in optimism. For those who have been fortunate to never before dealt with a life/death episode; this can give you a taste of what it is like. This child looked to her faith. It was my nephew who encouraged my wife and I to get this DVD to view.There are those who oppose the Christian dialogue and direction that the family of Bethany, and she herself take. But that IS the truth of this Christian family. If anything it is downplayed, but not much, as the Bethany and her family was adamant that viewers hear the true story of how and why they feel Bethany survived. Bethany becomes a champion pro-surfer, with only one arm; the film and in real life. Plenty of big names acting in this film such as Dennis Quaid as Dad; Helen Hunt as Mom, AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany and seems almost a double to the real surfer. Singer Carrie Underwood has a non-singing role.SUBTITLES available in English, Spanish & French.

487075,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,7799437278,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[1, 1]","If you are offended by a positive portrayal of Christianity, avoid this picture. Otherwise, this is a must see movie. Film critic Roger Moore considered this the best faith movie made (at least of recent years -- I doubt he's saying this is better than classics like ""Ben Hur"", ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Lillies Of The Field"" and ""Chariots of Fire""). But I consider this movie to be more comparable with ""Rocky"" than ""Facing The Giants"".This movie is very well put together. Let me give an example. Towards the beginning of the movie, the main character and others are going to an outdoor church service. You know it's a church service because a band is singing the praise song ""Blessed Be The Name of the Lord"". For those familiar with the lyrics, the song is about praising God in good times and in tough times, when He gives and when He takes away. The song's theme was particularly relevant to the movie.This movie is based on a true story. The real family are Christians and they lobbied to keep their faith from the editing room floor. Thus, you have a Christian perspective. But I consider this movie to fit more into the genre of a sports movie than a faith movie. The main character is a competitive athlete. The villain in the film is not the shark but the main rival. The climax does not deal with overcoming fear of returning to the water (there wasn't really any) or the struggles with lacking an arm, but with the competitor leaving their all on the court -- or in this case, the waves.Another note. Some reviewers don't like any Christianity in the movie. But this movie is not preachy. It deals with how their faith impacted their life, but there are no conversion scenes. There is a missions trip, but that trip is more humanitarian than obvertly a preaching tour.Knowing the theme, I was surprised the movie only had a PG rating, without the unlucky number following it. Seeing it, I can see why. Of course, parents, watch the film with your children and discuss the aspects with them.I don't expect any Oscar buzz about this movie.

There are reviews for this movie that focus on that one detail and nothing else.Now for the good stuff. My brother and I watched this and had a great time enjoying. My bro almost thought it was a Disney movie then realized it was better (at least in terms of today's Disney flicks). I couldn't help but notice all the beautiful cinematography of the exotic locale and angles of surfing.The shark attack was real quick compared to what I was expecting, yet it did its part well enough for the speed to be a nonissue.The church sequences (yes, there's a couple of them) at first may seem preachy to some, but what made it different (aside from a country singer for a youth pastor) was it being an open-air beachside church. Very, very different compared to the closed walls of American churches. Then there's the competitive surfing. Long before I heard of Bethany Hamilton, and despite being city-raised, I'd hoped to try surfing out. Haven't got a chance yet, and this urging me to try even more.Besides the competitivity and Christian spirit throughout, there's a showing of the effects of civilian PTSD, social persecution for physical disabilities, media hunger for stories (no matter who they may end up hurting), mean-spirited competitive opponents... yet there's also hope, a teenage spirit of striving in spite of how others think they should go about anything, helping the helpless (never knew Bethany Hamilton went to Thailand to help tsunami survivors), and families striving togethet, blood-related and not. I even appreciated that it didn't show Christians to be incessantly happy-go-lucky even in the midst of tragedy right after listening about God having a plan for us, but showing confusion at it all (""I don't know how God could have a plan after this! What good could possibly come from this?""), showing a lot of realism (the very gritty kind) alongside practicality.Humor, tragedy, hope, realism, love between one another, seeing things differently.

A main theme of the movie is that good can come out of bad.  Also, it shows how we can help others through our personal tragedies and that life is not over when bad things happen to us.  There is a plan for everything. I was very impressed with all the acting, special effects and the family friendly tone. There are zilcho swears. Even in the characters' darkest moments, there are no typical overused omg's or anything that would indicate they were angry at God or anyone else. They don't shy away from Christian references but present it accurately, the way the family and Bethany responded in the situation. I was impressed that the faith message that was natural, but not preachy. Also, the Bible verse quoted was from Jeremiah 29:11 and really if you were of another faith you wouldn't be offended by it I don't think. In the credits they show interviews with the real Bethany and she mentions Jesus there. However, that's who she is!  Some of the critics have said oh she was too calm or sweet...but I didn't see it this way at all. In fact, in real life, it was her calmness that helped save her life!! She wasn't screaming but was in shock as well I think. I think she is just a very calm person. Later it showed how hard it was for her to deal with the loss of her limb from a functional standpoint and emotionally such as when she worried about not being attractive to boys. All the relationships and reactions were very typical of real people...nothing forced at all. It is clear how good the relationships are between the parents and among the siblings but they interact and argue like NORMAL people.  Bethany has said in real life interviews that she and her competitors weren't that catty with each other, like with the antagonist they created for the movie.  However, her response to the girl is very good which shows young people that being nice to someone gets you a whole lot further and can change the person. It also showed how she dealt with her celebrity status and how that was a real challenge. The other part critics say isn't realistic is about her artificial arm...but it's very common for amputees to reject a prosthesis when it's for their upper limb. Tony Melendez (singer and plays 12-string guitar with his feet) did the same thing and he found he could function more easily without the prosthesis. There are some beautiful shots of Hawaii and the underwater/wave effects were just breathtaking.  I definitely recommend this movie and am looking forward to having the blu-ray/dvd!",5,Outstanding!!!

487103,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,7799437278,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","This is an EXCELLENT film, with BRILLIANT actors, telling an EXCEPTIONNALLY moving real story! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.As you probably already know, this film tells the true story of Bethany Hamilton, a very promising young American surfer, who suffered a bad accident in October 2003, as the result of which she was very seriously and permanently injured. This is mostly the story of her struggle to overcome the results of the accident, return to a normal life and especially go back to her great passion - professional surfing.This is a rather low key film, made with a rather modest (by Hollywood standards) budget, but nevertheless it packs an enormous punch, with some scenes being simply breathtaking. It was made possible by skilfull filming, good scenario, strong dialogs and a little bit of very discreet but extremely well made CGI.All actors did their best in this film and for such a little production quite an ensemble cast was gathered:- AnnaSophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton, is of course the main star and she is AMAZING, as excellent as she was in her big break ""Bridge to Terabithia"" (and gosh, did this girl grow well since then!). I sincerely believe that she has the potential to become another Natalie Portman in the future!- Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt play Bethany's parents and they are both GREAT- singer Carrie Underwood, winner of ""American Idol"", makes here one of her rare appearances in cinema - and she is excellent!- Craig T. Nelson, a Hollywood veteran specialist of second roles, plays here the surgeon who treats Bethany after the accident, and his calm and low key performance is an asset to this film- Kevin Sorbo, mostly known for portraying Hercules in the 90s, plays here a role rather unusual for him - and he does it very well- Branscombe Richard, an actor of Hawaiian ancestry known for his huge size and unique facial features and haircut, appears here as a Hawaian ex-surfing champion- Lorraine Nicholson, young daughter of Jack Nicholson, appears here in the role of Alana Blanchard, Bethany's best friend - and also a great surfer herself- Jeremy Sumpter, who in 2003 was an impressive Peter Pan, appears here as one of Bethany's brothers- smoking hot model and surfer Sonia Balmores Chung, Miss Hawaii Teen 2004, plays here Malina Birch, Bethany's nemesis in surf competitons...- last but not least, REAL Bethany Hamilton (filmed from some distance) appears in some scenes showing her impressive surfingThis film is deeply immersed in Christian teachings, as in real life Hamilton family was (and still is) very religious. However, there is no heavy hammering of Bible on the viewers - the message is discreet and softly spoken. This film tries to tackle with one of the hardest questions a Christian can be asked: ""Why does bad things happen to good people?"". It is hardly a spoiler to say here that there will be no fully satisfying solution given to solve this riddle - but some elements of answer, quite important, will be provided. Those answers will not satisfy everybody - but those who so wish can find more elements in the Bible, and especially in the Book of Job.Bottom line, this is an excellent, wonderful film, which should please adults and young teenaegers alike. I recommend it with whole my heart! And to end this review, I will give the last word to Bethany Hamilton (who is now 23 and just announced her engagement), who said in her book: ""Surfing isn't the most important thing in life. Love is.""",5,"""I don't need easy - I just need possible!""",1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,3498,"['EXCELLENT', 'film', 'BRILLIANT', 'actors', 'telling', 'EXCEPTIONNALLY', 'moving', 'real', 'story', 'more', 'impressions', 'SPOILERS.As', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'very', 'promising', 'young', 'American', 'surfer', 'who', 'suffered', 'bad', 'accident', 'October', '2003', 'result', 'was', 'very', 'seriously', 'permanently', 'injured', 'mostly', 'story', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'results', 'accident', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'especially', 'go', 'back', 'great', 'passion', 'professional', 'surfing.This', 'rather', 'low', 'key', 'film', 'made', 'rather', 'modest', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'budget', 'enormous', 'punch', 'scenes', 'being', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'made', 'possible', 'skilfull', 'filming', 'good', 'scenario', 'strong', 'dialogs', 'little', 'bit', 'very', 'discreet', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'CGI.All', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'film', 'such', 'little', 'production', 'quite', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'gathered', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'course', 'main', 'star', 'AMAZING', 'as', 'excellent', 'was', 'big', 'break', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'gosh', 'did', 'girl', 'grow', 'well', 'then', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'potential', 'become', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'future', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'play', 'Bethany', 'parents', 'are', 'GREAT-', 'singer', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'winner', 'American', 'Idol', 'here', 'one', 'rare', 'appearances', 'cinema', 'excellent', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'specialist', 'second', 'roles', 'plays', 'here', 'surgeon', 'who', 'Bethany', 'accident', 'calm', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'asset', 'film-', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'mostly', 'known', 'portraying', 'Hercules', '90s', 'plays', 'here', 'role', 'rather', 'unusual', 'very', 'well-', 'Branscombe', 'Richard', 'actor', 'Hawaiian', 'ancestry', 'known', 'huge', 'size', 'unique', 'facial', 'features', 'haircut', 'here', 'Hawaian', 'ex-surfing', 'champion-', 'Lorraine', 'Nicholson', 'young', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'here', 'role', 'Alana', 'Blanchard', 'Bethany', 'best', 'friend', 'also', 'great', 'surfer', 'herself-', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'who', '2003', 'was', 'impressive', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'here', 'one', 'Bethany', 'brothers-', 'smoking', 'hot', 'model', 'surfer', 'Sonia', 'Balmores', 'Chung', 'Miss', 'Hawaii', 'Teen', '2004', 'here', 'Malina', 'Birch', 'Bethany', 'nemesis', 'surf', 'competitons', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'REAL', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'filmed', 'distance', 'scenes', 'showing', 'impressive', 'surfingThis', 'film', 'deeply', 'immersed', 'Christian', 'teachings', 'real', 'life', 'Hamilton', 'family', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'religious', 'However', 'heavy', 'hammering', 'Bible', 'viewers', 'message', 'discreet', 'softly', 'spoken', 'film', 'tackle', 'one', 'hardest', 'questions', 'Christian', 'can', 'be', 'asked', 'Why', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people', 'hardly', 'spoiler', 'say', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'solution', 'given', 'solve', 'riddle', 'elements', 'answer', 'quite', 'important', 'will', 'be', 'provided', 'answers', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'everybody', 'who', 'so', 'wish', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'elements', 'Bible', 'especially', 'Book', 'Job.Bottom', 'line', 'excellent', 'wonderful', 'film', 'should', 'please', 'adults', 'young', 'teenaegers', 'alike', 'recommend', 'whole', 'heart', 'end', 'review', 'will', 'give', 'last', 'word', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'now', '23', 'just', 'announced', 'engagement', 'who', 'said', 'book', 'Surfing', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'Love']",Soul Surfer (2011)

When I heard the Family Friendly, religious/spiritual, Christian appellations being thrown around i was skeptical. I avoided it in the theaters because of this - my mistake.Even with the outstanding cast of Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt, Keven Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and the lovely irrepressible AnnaSophia Robb, I was wary. I was wrong.I knew it was about Bethany Hamilton and remembered the 2003 shark attack incident but that was about it. After reading up about her online and watching some You Tube videos I decided to give it a try. I loved it! Not as sappy sentimental as I feared it would be, not as 'preachy' as I expected it to be and definitely not as cheesy as most of these type of films are. This is a professionally made story of a surfer girl, a champion athlete, who happens to live her Christian witness every day of her life and actually believes in a matter of fact way you don't often see portrayed on film.The surfing scenes are real, not hopped up or CGI exaggerated for excitement, this is the authentic thing. The acting is very good to outstanding. The story is beautiful and presents a real family as normal with normal problems but not dysfunctional as so many other movies both regular and Christian do for dramatic effect.  Granted, they do live in Paradise (according to many, not me, never wanted to go there) and the laid back lifestyle is revealed in all its happiness and joy that many who live there brag about.I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to be uplifted regardless if they are Christian or not, religious/spiritual or not but can appreciate life to the full.",5,SURF'S UP!

I didn't know she was a competitive surfer who made a truly miraculous comeback and was back on an international competitive circuit.  I was very impressed with this movie for a variety of reasons.One thing I will point out is when we watched this, we had an age range of 9 years old to 71 watching it - this is truly a great family movie which is pretty hard to find these days.  Be prepared to tear up several times in the movie as well as feel a burst of pride as Bethany goes through her recovery.The family leans hard on their faith in God to get them through this struggle - most movies with this type of theme fail because you feel as if the faith aspect is being put in front of the tale of the movie.  Not so in this case, but it is a refreshing thing for me to see - I believe God does have a plan and Bethany learns the plan is not for her to be a #1 ranked surfer, but for her to be an example to others worldwide for those with disabilities to overcome.The acting was very good in this one, with Helen Hunt providing her usual outstanding job, Dennis Quaid continuing his kind of goofy but still a role model characterization, and Carrie Underwood doing a believable job of a youth / missions leader.

When the movie was released, I hoped for two things: (1) that it would relfect Bethany's faith and how that faith saw her through horrific trauma in her life and (2) that it would be a family movie. The movie met my expectations on both accounts.Family unity and loyalty is strong in Soul Surfer and that is one of my favorite things about the movie. It's apparent that Bethany, her parents, and her brothers are a closeknit family and that they truly care for each other. When times are difficult, we need those we love most to come alongside us. Bethany is also surrounded by loyal friends, who rally around her, not only during her surfing competitions, but also after her accident. What amazed me was that she and her best friend competed in competitions, yet they didn't allow that to interfere in their friendship. What an example of how to love your neighbor!There are many opportunities for discussion in this film:1. Bethany sneaks out at night to go surfing. I'm not sure she had a consequence, but this provided a great discussion point nonetheless.2. There is a girl Bethany surfs against who is spiteful and mean. How should we handle people like that in our own lives?3. At one point, Bethany becomes discouraged about what happened. Why do bad things happen? Does the Lord distance himself from us during those times? Or does He forever remain by our side, never leaving us and never forsaking us?4. Another great discussion topic is about modesty, as at times, the bathing suits are a bit immodest. And finally,5. Bethany embarks on a missions trip. At times when we feel as though things couldn't be any worse in our lives, all we have to do is look around and see the pain and the suffering of others. Then, reach out and offer assistance.I loved this movie. Yes, I bawled after Bethany was injured (I'm a mom after all!) and yes, I bawled at the end. It is a powerful movie that points to God, family, and determination. I would highly recommend it for those ages tween and up. Younger children will be frightened by the shark attack, although it was tastefully done and not prolonged.

In the U.S. fundamentalist Christianity is connected to the Tea Party movement, which I absolutely abhor (I'm convinced Jesus would too).

Let me also point out that she is not the first, not the hardest ever stricken by tragedy. And finally that her story deserved something better than this soap opera...Acting is lame at best, dialogues shallow , the actors are all beautiful, zero fat, caucasian beverly hills types, intelligent, caring, warm , nice, just never showing any defect whatsoever ...The main actress, AnnaSophia Robb, has the athleticism of a dead fish, is half the size of the real Bethany,and nothing like her in character. A cute teen all right, the typical ""material"" for ""teen crush"" or ""teen horror"" cheap flicks..definitely out of place in a story like this one..But the worst part is the offensive and misleading way in which religion is used in this cheap flick. I have respect for the role that religion has had in Bethany's recovery, and just because of that respect I am offended by the ""valium for the masses"" way in which religion is treated here. Instead of taking the chance to investigate, reflect or question on the ""problem of evil"" the story writers chose the disgusting approach of connecting it with ""morals"". In the first part of the movie Bethany disobeys her parents (very mildly, just going to a night surf party..) and prefers to spend her time training instead of going to Mexico on a charitable mission. But luckily a ""shark on a mission"" will soon amputate her arm to bring her back on the ""good road"" so that she never disobeys her parents again, and goes on to relieve the sorrows of the poor people hit by the tsunami... This is a perfect compendium of the sick way in which religion is used to keep adults in an childish state of mind. Obey the authority or you will be punished, and if something evil happens is just because you were not obedient enough...and I won't even go into the hypocrisy of thinking that a trip to visit the tsunami stricken populations or the poor people in mexico could do anything useful for something other than one's won ego...In the end ""Bethany"" is asked if she could go back would she still go surfing the day she got attacked by the shark? First: I know journalist are often idiots, but can you conceive a dumbest question??  Second: she goes on answering ""Yes, I would, because that gave me the chance to embrace more people than I could have with two arms"". Please. That might have been a great sentence if it was ""Of course I would not, you dumbass! Who would be so idiotic to go have his arm chopped by a shark?? But I am still glad that this sad accident has given me the chance to embrace more people than I could do with two arms.."" This part reminds me of a genial italian comedian, Massimo Troisi.. he plays a scene in one of his movies in which he reacts a little skeptically to a priest trying to convince him that disgraces in life are actually a gift that God makes to his beloved ones. And when the priest, seeing his incredulity, says: ""I will pray for you"", Troisi answer ""Please no, or He might give some gift to me as well..

I love this movie for many reasons: One is the cast, especially Annasophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton and Lorraine Nicholson, who plays Bethany's friend, Alana Blanchard(those two actresses work well together and play their characters to perfection!).  I also love the fact that the entire movie was shot on location in Hawaii and it makes you feel like you're there.  Another thing that I like is that the whole Hamilton family was there during the filming of the movie and Bethany did all the one-armed surfing stunts.  I also love how, despite her injury, Bethany was able to be determined to be able to surf, again, which leads to the message that the movie brings that, despite difficult times, good things can come out because Rick Allen, drummer for the British heavy metal band, Def Leppard, lost his left arm in a car accident in '84, but he enventually came back and, through the use of electronics & foot pedals, he was able to  play drums, again, with one arm.  Not only do I love this movie for those reasons, while I'm not an emotional guy when I watch movies, there's about 5 or 6 scenes that make me want to burst into tears.  I think Bethany is a good, strong-hearted person and I'd love to meet her one day.

The message of this movie is that faith in God gives a person strength to overcome any obstacle.  I am not overally religious, but I think that faith in a higher power is a positive message.  AnnaSophia Robb gives an excellent performance as Hamilton, She is a teenager that lost her arm to a shark bite in 1996.  There are shots in the movie showing Anna Sophia struggling with the simplest things like cutting vegetables and making a sandwich after losing her arm.  Her dedication and her talent for the sport of surfing is what makes this movie entertaining.  I admire the skill, balance and coordination that Anna Sophia shows on the surf board.  Director Sean Mcnamara makes surfing look like an exciting and competitive sport.  There is one shot in the movie that shows Anna Sophia going inside of a wave and then coming out of it.  This shot is breathtaking and is a testament to Mcnamara's talent as a director.  Dennis Quaid co stars as Tom Hamilton.  He is Bethany's father.  He gives a good performance as a father who encourages Bethany not to give up her dream as a professional surfer.  Carrie Underwood is good in a supporting role as a youth minister who also encourages Bethany not to give out faith in God as after her accident.  Helen Hunt plays Bethany's mom Cheri.  Her performance is not as good as Quaid's, but she still comes across as a loving mother.  This film is filled with good music.  There is an uplifting song entitled Set The World On Fire"".

Anna Sophia Robb, ""Race to Witch Mountain"" [2009], lead an amazing cast. Dennis Quaid (Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor, 1973) Helen Hunt (Academy Award winner for Best Actress, 1997), Carrie Underwood in her acting debut (multi-Grammy Award winner), Craig T. Nelson (Emmy Award winner, 1992), and Kevin Sorbo (t.v. star of ""Hercules"" and ""Andromeda"") along with several others did an excellent job portraying family and friends coping with life-altering circumstances. For brevity's sake, my review is broken down into cons and pros of the film.Negative: (1) The film takes a bit more dramatic license regarding the rivalry between the surfing competitors than the book portrays. (2) The film may appear ""sugary"" or ""cheesy"" at times when dealing with difficulties encountered such as Ms. Hamilton's way of helping some of the 2004 Indian Ocean and Tsunami victims or Ms. Hamilton's statement at the end of the film.Positive: (1) It's an unbelievably, true story.

Talk about defying the odds-13 year old Bethany Hamilton loses her left arm to a shark attack while surfing and is back in the water in just three weeks! Remarkable,yes,but it was her faith in God that kept her going,even when she experienced times of frustration. Kudos to the producers for their excellent casting choices-everyone involved was wonderful. One performance I must comment on is that of Kevin Sorbo,who played Holt Blanchard,the man who saved Bethany's life. Although his screen time was limited,Kevin made the most of it,playing a man whose quick action and thinking made the difference and prevented almost certain death for Bethany,but at the hosptial,credited Bethany with keeping him calm and rational during that tense time. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt were great as Bethany's parents,whose faith never waivered throughout the whole ordeal. Carrie Underwood was good in her film debut. One minor quip I have is that there should have been some direct interaction between Tom & Holt since they are best friends,but that doesn't take away from the relationship shown between the two families and the support they show to Bethany and Alana. Most importantly,this movie shows that if you have faith in God,you can do anything!

Also, the water photography was awesome.The ""message,"" however, didn't do much for me. First off, while I am not minimizing the impact of losing an arm, and the reality that everyday activities, once easy and taken for granted, becoming different and difficult, it is not a ""tragedy."" Losing one's life is a tragedy. Suffering with painful illness or incapacitation is a tragedy. Children with no home or love are living a tragedy. I could understand Bethany's love of surfing being her whole world, and her lack of perspective, she was a child. What was her parents' excuse? They seemed to feel also that surfing was the most important thing for her, more important than church, way more important than school, and more important than doing anything to help anyone else. Bethany blew off a trip to help needy children in Mexico because she had to train, and her parents allowed this. Instead, all that was important to all of them was for her to be the best and to win endorsements.I saw after the film that Bethany did go on to be a pro surfer, continuing to focus on being the best and winning endorsements. The idea of ""surfing for Jesus"" leaves me cold.

This movie has a lot going for it and a couple of things going against it.  First off I wanted to like this movie (actual review is 3.5 stars).  Who doesn't like an underdog story?  The movie, inspired by the events that occurred to Bethany Hamilton who, at 13 lost an arm in a shark attack, does not sensationalize its subject matter.  At heart it wants you to look past the person/ character of Bethany (played here by actress AnnaSophie Robb in an understated performance) in order to see and appreciate a life of faith and a motto of ""everything happens for a good reason; don't lose heart if that reason is not apparent to you, give it time and keep your eyes open to the bigger picture.""  I think the movie succeeds quite well in conveying its message (when Hamilton teaches Thai tidal wave refugees how to surf and, at the end of the movie, when she expresses how she was able to touch so many with one arm, far more than she could have touched or would have touched with two) but the depiction of Hamilton as such a saint, with her family circle and others all seemingly worshipping her (I know that's a bit harsh but come on! where was the strife between siblings and the teenager's rebellious spirit!?!) even prior to the arm-loss incident, distracted from the film's message.  Another thing that detracted from the film (IMO) were both Randy Quaid as the father and Helen Hunt as Bethany's mother (can someone give Hunt something to eat? she looks like the skin on her face is going to rip if she loses any more weight) as they were emotionally underwhelming in their performances (Quaid less so though).  Something that the movie has going for it is a depiction of a family whose religious values are taken seriously and credibly; it was good to see people go to church and then not to be played off as hypocrites or ""crazy fanatics"".  Carrie Underwood was wooden in her performance as Bethany's friend/ Christian counselor.  Perhaps the best part of the movie is saved for last when we see clips of and read about the real Bethany Hamilton.

487160,ADS4S2JI2P0DI,7799437278,Tracy Wythe,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie in theaters back in May of this year. I knew what it was about going into it. A story like this wasn't easy to convey on the screen. At least it wouldn't seem like it'd be easy to do so, anyway. Of course, there have been plenty of surfer movies made in the past. This one definitely had a different vibe to it, partly because it was based on a true story. That's not to say that other surfer movies haven't been based on true stories. With this one, as I was watching it, I really felt like I could connect with the girl and everything that happened to her. I'm not saying that I went through the same things that she did, but that I was able to lose myself in the film's subject matter and feel as though I was there.

487161,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,7799437278,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","AnnaSophia Robb (gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") shines as Bethany Hamilton, a real-life young Hawaiian surfer who lost her arm in a shark attack. ""Soul Surfer"" may not be the first film about athletes who refuses to give up their dreams (my favorite is James Stewart's ""The Stratton Story""), and true, the film did not win any Oscar, but ""Soul Surfer"" delivers nonetheless, thanks to the strong performance from the star and beautifully shot surf sequences.Most of you have already known the amazing story of Bethany Hamilton, and even you don't, well, it's OK. All you have to know that the story is inspirational to everyone, even those who are not particularly interested in surfing.What makes the film special is the presence of AnnaSophia Robb, who embodies the heroine's indomitable spirit. Some complain (understandably) that her portrayal of Bethany Hamilton looks a bit too saintly. It is also true that despite the shocking incident and several complications that follow, AnnaSophia Robb's Bethany remains patient and resilient. But we also should know that some people can really behave like that. And remember, we are talking about someone who lost her arm in October, 2003 and came back to a surf competition in January, 2004!Director Sean McNamara re-creates the shark attack convincingly, with vivid (not graphic) details about the attack itself and how she was brought to the hospital. Another merit of the film is the surf competition scenes, which I find surprisingly thrilling and involving, even though I have never seen one before.My only complaint is Carrie Underwood's character and the Thailand episode that I think need more depth. That said, with a solid supporting cast including Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and Craig T. Nelson (more like an extended cameo though), ""Soul Surfer"" offers an uplifting tale of a real-life person who is determined to move on.",4,AnnaSophia Robb Shines in This Uplifting Tale,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1920,"['AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'gum-chewing', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'real-life', 'young', 'Hawaiian', 'surfer', 'who', 'lost', 'arm', 'shark', 'attack', 'Soul', 'Surfer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'athletes', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'favorite', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Stratton', 'Story', 'true', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Soul', 'Surfer', 'delivers', 'nonetheless', 'thanks', 'strong', 'performance', 'star', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'surf', 'sequences.Most', 'have', 'already', 'known', 'amazing', 'story', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'OK.', 'All', 'have', 'know', 'story', 'inspirational', 'everyone', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'interested', 'film', 'special', 'presence', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'heroine', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'complain', 'understandably', 'portrayal', 'Bethany', 'Hamilton', 'bit', 'too', 'saintly', 'also', 'true', 'shocking', 'incident', 'several', 'complications', 'follow', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Bethany', 'patient', 'resilient', 'also', 'should', 'know', 'people', 'can', 'really', 'behave', 'remember', 'are', 'talking', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'arm', 'October', '2003', 'came', 'back', 'surf', 'competition', 'January', '2004', 'Director', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'shark', 'attack', 'convincingly', 'vivid', 'not', 'graphic', 'details', 'attack', 'how', 'was', 'brought', 'hospital', 'merit', 'film', 'surf', 'competition', 'scenes', 'find', 'surprisingly', 'thrilling', 'involving', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'before.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'character', 'Thailand', 'episode', 'think', 'need', 'more', 'depth', 'said', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'more', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Soul', 'Surfer', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'real-life', 'person', 'who', 'determined', 'move']",Soul Surfer (2011)

487169,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,7799437278,Wuchak,"[0, 1]","""Soul Surfer"" (2011) relays the inspirational true story of 13 year-old surfer Bethany who's arm was bitten off by a shark in Hawaii in October, 2003. Despite this, she was back in the water surfing in less than a month (!).I admit that my wife & I cried at certain points during this movie, which is  a good testimony, but I felt the movie was sometimes too stagy and awkward, not all the time, but here and there, like the ending where a certain character has a sudden change of heart. People have changes of heart in real life, so I'm not objecting to that, but rather the awkward and questionable way in which it was portrayed. This was a key climatic scene and the filmmakers needed to take the time to do it right, even if it took more time, practice, re-shoots, money or what have you; but it's like they shot it and said, ""Well, it's not very good, but we'll try to make it work in the editing room"".About Bethany's nemesis, I liked the way Bethany took her continuing rivalry: She observed, ""At least she views me as competition"" as opposed to those who essentially viewed her with pity.Despite the occasional stagy awkwardness, there's enough good here for me to give the film an okay rating, like Bethany & Alana and their relationship (played by cuties AnnaSophia Robb & Lorraine Nicholson, Jack's daughter), the awe-inspiring Hawaiian locations, solid performances by Helen Hunt & others (Dennis Quaid, Kevin Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and Carrie Underwood), the music, the entire shark attack & aftermath sequence and, of course, the inspirational true story itself.But those stagy, awkward moments are really detrimental. Too bad they didn't take the time to work out the kinks.To view a similar inspirational coming-of-age surfing film that's done more effectively, check out 2010's ""Cutback"". It's a low-budget independent flick, but very good.The film was shot in Hawaii and runs 106 minutes.GRADE: C",3,"Inspirational, but too formulaic and (sometimes) awkward",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,1914,"['Soul', 'Surfer', '2011', 'inspirational', 'true', 'story', '13', 'year-old', 'surfer', 'Bethany', 'who', 'arm', 'was', 'bitten', 'off', 'shark', 'Hawaii', 'October', '2003', 'was', 'back', 'water', 'surfing', 'less', 'month', '.I', 'admit', 'wife', 'cried', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'good', 'testimony', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'sometimes', 'too', 'stagy', 'awkward', 'not', 'time', 'here', 'there', 'ending', 'where', 'certain', 'character', 'sudden', 'change', 'heart', 'People', 'have', 'changes', 'heart', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'objecting', 'rather', 'awkward', 'questionable', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'was', 'key', 'climatic', 'scene', 'filmmakers', 'needed', 'take', 'time', 'do', 'right', 'even', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'practice', 're-shoots', 'money', 'what', 'have', 'shot', 'said', 'Well', 'not', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'try', 'make', 'work', 'editing', 'room', 'Bethany', 'nemesis', 'liked', 'way', 'Bethany', 'took', 'continuing', 'rivalry', 'observed', 'least', 'competition', 'opposed', 'who', 'essentially', 'viewed', 'occasional', 'stagy', 'awkwardness', 'enough', 'good', 'here', 'give', 'film', 'okay', 'rating', 'Bethany', 'Alana', 'relationship', 'played', 'cuties', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Lorraine', 'Nicholson', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'awe-inspiring', 'Hawaiian', 'locations', 'solid', 'performances', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'others', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'music', 'entire', 'shark', 'attack', 'aftermath', 'sequence', 'course', 'inspirational', 'true', 'story', 'itself.But', 'stagy', 'awkward', 'moments', 'are', 'really', 'detrimental', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'kinks.To', 'view', 'similar', 'inspirational', 'coming-of-age', 'surfing', 'film', 'done', 'more', 'effectively', 'check', '2010', 'Cutback', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'flick', 'very', 'good.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Hawaii', '106', 'minutes.GRADE', 'C']",Soul Surfer (2011)
