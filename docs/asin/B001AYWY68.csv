It is NOT demanding, and the instructor provides many modifications for positions.  The scenery is attractive but nor a distraction, and the languaging is good.There are many Yoga videos like this (AM/PM routines), and it is a good idea to have several of them to rotate so that you don't get bored or stale.If you have absolutely zero experience with Yoga and want a 'first taste' of Yoga, this is a very good place to start.  It is gentle, well-explained, and easy to follow.If you are looking for a good beginner DVD, I would recommend this one.It is not demanding, and there is a fair variety of positions in the AM workout.  It is mildly challenging.  The PM workout is very gentle and relaxing.If you are looking for an easy stress-reduction Yoga DVD, the 'PM' workout is particularly good.If you are an experienced, intermediate, or advanced practitioner, you probably don't need this DVD.",4,"Very good beginner Yoga DVD, PM is very good for stress relief.",1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,1002,"['are', 'beginner', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'simple', 'workout', 'well-planned', 'well-executed', 'NOT', 'demanding', 'instructor', 'many', 'modifications', 'positions', 'scenery', 'attractive', 'distraction', 'languaging', 'are', 'many', 'Yoga', 'videos', 'AM/PM', 'routines', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'several', 'rotate', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'stale.If', 'have', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'experience', 'Yoga', 'want', ""'first"", 'taste', 'Yoga', 'very', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'gentle', 'well-explained', 'easy', 'follow.If', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'one.It', 'not', 'demanding', 'fair', 'variety', 'positions', 'AM', 'workout', 'mildly', 'challenging', 'PM', 'workout', 'very', 'gentle', 'relaxing.If', 'are', 'looking', 'easy', 'stress-reduction', 'Yoga', 'DVD', ""'PM"", 'workout', 'particularly', 'good.If', 'are', 'experienced', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'practitioner', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'DVD']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners
1168970,AL101ZVF6XPOY,B001AYWY68,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","Let me just preface my review by saying that I have never given a 5 star review to a workout video and I own some that I like very much.  So four is a good review for me and to me a 5 star rating would mean the video was perfect (which none are).  Also I have done yoga on and off for many years so I don't exactly qualify as the absolute beginner this video is targeted for.Into my review: I really like this video. I do the am yoga almost every morning and fnd rejuvinating and a nice way to wake.  I occasionally do the pm one, especially if I'm having trouble sleeping.  And I've thrown both together for a longer routine on the weekend.  All three have pleased me.The instruction is very well done and easy to follow, I only had to look at the screen once in the whole workout the first time I was doing it to check that I was correct.  And she gives both the Hindu and english names for the poses which is good for beginners trying to learn.  She speaks just enough to be informative without being chatty, and her voice and the music are very soothing.  I think a beginner would have no trouble figuring out the poses.  Also, there's a lot of work attuning to your breath and explicitly changing the pose with inhale and exhale which I liked as a way to awaken your muscles.  And the poses flow very easily from one to the next with no awkward changes.Things that bothered me.  The sun salutations in the am routine are extremely short.  It's just standing forward bend, plank, child's pose, downdog.  And then seperately she went through warrior I, II, and III.  I wish those had been incorporated into the sun salutation.  And that some more poses (side angle, triangle) had been included.  However, this is a beginner's DVD so I can see how the way she does it would be helpful.Overall: I think this would be an exquisite DVD for someone just coming to yoga (that said I don't think anything can replace classes and this should perhaps be just a supplement).  This was great for me as I was looking just for a relaxing, easy yoga routine to start my day.  However, for someone who has done yoga for awhile it's not very challenging and not a whole lot of poses are included.",4,"A relaxing, lovable yoga video",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2183,"['Let', 'just', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'have', 'never', 'given', '5', 'star', 'review', 'workout', 'video', 'own', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'So', 'four', 'good', 'review', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'mean', 'video', 'was', 'perfect', 'none', 'are', 'Also', 'have', 'done', 'yoga', 'many', 'years', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'qualify', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'video', 'targeted', 'review', 'really', 'video', 'do', 'am', 'yoga', 'almost', 'morning', 'fnd', 'rejuvinating', 'nice', 'way', 'wake', 'occasionally', 'do', 'pm', 'one', 'especially', ""'m"", 'having', 'trouble', 'sleeping', ""'ve"", 'thrown', 'together', 'longer', 'routine', 'weekend', 'three', 'have', 'pleased', 'me.The', 'instruction', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'easy', 'follow', 'only', 'had', 'look', 'screen', 'once', 'whole', 'workout', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'doing', 'check', 'was', 'correct', 'Hindu', 'english', 'names', 'poses', 'good', 'beginners', 'trying', 'learn', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'informative', 'being', 'chatty', 'voice', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'soothing', 'think', 'beginner', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'poses', 'Also', 'lot', 'work', 'attuning', 'breath', 'explicitly', 'changing', 'pose', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'liked', 'way', 'awaken', 'muscles', 'poses', 'flow', 'very', 'easily', 'one', 'next', 'awkward', 'changes.Things', 'bothered', 'sun', 'salutations', 'am', 'routine', 'are', 'extremely', 'short', 'just', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'plank', 'child', 'pose', 'downdog', 'then', 'seperately', 'went', 'warrior', 'II', 'III', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'incorporated', 'sun', 'salutation', 'more', 'poses', 'side', 'angle', 'triangle', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'However', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'helpful.Overall', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'exquisite', 'DVD', 'someone', 'just', 'coming', 'yoga', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'can', 'replace', 'classes', 'should', 'perhaps', 'be', 'just', 'supplement', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'looking', 'just', 'relaxing', 'easy', 'yoga', 'routine', 'start', 'day', 'However', 'someone', 'who', 'done', 'yoga', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'poses', 'are', 'included']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

1168972,A3FSWT60MFE363,B001AYWY68,AR,"[9, 13]","I like the steady pace of the DVD.  Too many other Yoga workouts are choppy when changing from one position to the next.  This DVD is contains two CONTINUOUS segments for both the AM and PM routines.  Plus one segment that combines both routines.  That being said, the times listed on this DVD are seriously misleading.  I'm okay with the AM routine running over the 30 minutes; the PM routine doesn't come close.AM Yoga starts immediately and truly ends at the 34 minute mark, with 2 minutes afterwards for breathing.  The AM segment is the star of the DVD.PM Yoga has a true routine time of 17.5 minutes.  The first 3+ minutes consist of sitting cross legged and breathing.  At the 22:25 mark, you lie on your back until the 26 minute mark, where you sit cross legged once again and breath.  PM ends at 26:49.I was looking for a SOLID 30 minute yoga workout.  I found the lack of movement of the PM routine to be highly annoying and actually created stress since I wanted to move and stretch after a day of sitting in the office.  I wasn't looking for anything too strenuous.  Just a basic DVD that involved more movement.

I've tried Yoga a couple of times before and found that it seems to put a lot of pressure on the joints while not really stretching the muscles all that much.  I was fairly pleased with this program, as it doesn't seem to put much pressure on the joints.  The poses are easy, feel good, and I think you get a nice stretch.  I was surprised to find just how relaxing Yoga can be:  some of the poses are held for moderate periods of time, while the instructor has you breathing in and out.  It's really quite soothing.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the routines get a bit long.  For something you're supposed to do every morning and evening, I think 30 minutes gets a bit time consuming, 20 would have been better.Overall though, I like this program and feel that it's a good choice for beginners.  I didn't find any of the poses particularly hard at all - the hardest part is trying to do the poses correctly when you're facing away from the TV screen.

Her previous DVD entitled Yoga for Beginners is really more of an intermediate practice, but also a beautiful production. It runs an hour long, where this DVD has the choice of 30 minutes practices which you can combine for a full hour-long practice or practice individually. It is a garden setting with the ocean far in the background, not ocean-front.This practice is good for beginners who have a bit of knowledge on form. It is much easier than her previous DVD. It does not teach correct positioning in the postures; it is a mix of vinyasa/flowing yoga, but at a slightly slower and concentrated pace. The practice helps you to get in touch with breathing and balance within your body and especially focuses on your heart and finding the good in all things.I tend to prefer gentle, relaxing, stretching yoga in the morning and invigorating yoga in the evening, so I switch and do the AM yoga practice in the afternoon and PM yoga practice in the morning. The PM practice is very slow paced and all performed on the floor (no standing postures). Elena spends a lot of time in downward dog which is a good inversion for beginners.Please see many other yoga, tai chi, and meditation CDs and videos that I have reviewed and feel free to email or send me yoga items for review.

I was interested in trying Elena Brower's yoga am/pm for two reasons.  One, is that she has a good reputation as a top yoga instructor, and the other was that my other yoga practices are longer, most at about the one hour mark and this would allow me to squeeze in a bit of yoga in on a day when I wanted a little extra, or didn't have time for my full practice.  Both the am and pm practice are roughly 30 minutes.The set is beautiful, with flowers and ocean in the background.  Elena's voice is calming and is friendly without being ""chatty"".  As any good yoga instructor, she reminds you when to inhale and exhale so that you really open up to the poses.  This is the essence of yoga of any type, the breathing.  Even if this is all you gain, you will have come away with an important aspect of yoga and a good tool to go back to when you are in the midst of your regular day and all of it's challenges.I have been doing yoga for several years through dvd's and enjoy working with the styles of different teachers.  Once you are familiar with the basics, you can take the beginners practices and build up to a more intermediate pose as the postures are the same as many you will know and have been practicing.  If you are a true beginner, this is a fine dvd.  Elena explains how to start and as in the boat pose (an abdominal and balance pose) shows you three separate variations, depending on your level of fitness and flexibility.I found the am practice to be rejuvinating and helped me start my day breathing fully, and felt that I had really loosened up.  The pm practice was soothing and relaxing and I know I will find myself going to this practice for a little relaxation and stress relief from a hard day.Yoga differs from my regular exercise in that it keeps me more in tune with how I feel and in proper breathing.  It does not matter how deeply I go into a pose or how hard I push, it is there to allow you to open your muscles, become more flexible, and tone, but also to sooth the mind and bring yourself to a better place.  For that reason, yoga is something that I do as a supplement to other forms of exercise that generally work my body only.I was definitely impressed with Elena's style and would seek out other yoga dvd's that she has out or puts out in the future.For a nice introduction to yoga, I would pick this one up and do something good for yourself....mind and body.",5,A perfect practice to begin or end your day....,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,2491,"['do', 'yoga', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'as', 'well', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'dance', 'other', 'forms', 'exercise', 'was', 'interested', 'trying', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'yoga', 'am/pm', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'good', 'reputation', 'top', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'other', 'was', 'other', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'longer', 'most', 'one', 'hour', 'mark', 'would', 'allow', 'squeeze', 'bit', 'yoga', 'day', 'when', 'wanted', 'little', 'extra', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'full', 'practice', 'am', 'pm', 'practice', 'are', 'roughly', '30', 'minutes.The', 'set', 'beautiful', 'flowers', 'ocean', 'background', 'Elena', 'voice', 'calming', 'friendly', 'being', 'chatty', 'good', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'when', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'so', 'really', 'open', 'up', 'poses', 'essence', 'yoga', 'type', 'breathing', 'Even', 'gain', 'will', 'have', 'come', 'away', 'important', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'good', 'tool', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'are', 'midst', 'regular', 'day', 'challenges.I', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'several', 'years', 'dvd', 'enjoy', 'working', 'styles', 'different', 'teachers', 'are', 'familiar', 'basics', 'can', 'take', 'beginners', 'practices', 'build', 'up', 'more', 'intermediate', 'pose', 'postures', 'are', 'same', 'many', 'will', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'are', 'true', 'beginner', 'fine', 'dvd', 'Elena', 'how', 'start', 'boat', 'pose', 'abdominal', 'balance', 'pose', 'three', 'separate', 'variations', 'depending', 'level', 'fitness', 'flexibility.I', 'found', 'am', 'practice', 'be', 'rejuvinating', 'helped', 'start', 'day', 'breathing', 'fully', 'felt', 'had', 'really', 'loosened', 'up', 'pm', 'practice', 'was', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'know', 'will', 'find', 'going', 'practice', 'little', 'relaxation', 'stress', 'relief', 'hard', 'day.Yoga', 'differs', 'regular', 'exercise', 'more', 'tune', 'how', 'feel', 'proper', 'breathing', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'deeply', 'go', 'pose', 'how', 'hard', 'push', 'there', 'allow', 'open', 'muscles', 'become', 'more', 'flexible', 'tone', 'also', 'sooth', 'mind', 'bring', 'better', 'place', 'reason', 'yoga', 'something', 'do', 'supplement', 'other', 'forms', 'exercise', 'generally', 'work', 'body', 'only.I', 'was', 'definitely', 'impressed', 'Elena', 'style', 'would', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'out', 'out', 'future.For', 'nice', 'introduction', 'yoga', 'would', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'do', 'something', 'good', '.mind', 'body']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

I usually do them both together, but on days when I am sore or not feeling well, I can just do the PM routine and feel like I got a little yoga into my day.She emphasizes breath a lot, which I really like.

If you have any injuries or are not in general good health, you should consult your doctor and/or  look for a disc that is specifically geared towards people with back pain, knee injuries, arthritis, etc...No, Elena doesn't give a lot of instruction.  She does explain how to execute the move, but she doesn't give a yoga history/theory lesson throughout the workout.  I, for one, am grateful.  I hate listening to a bunch of talking while doing yoga.  It keeps me from centering.  If that's what you're looking for, then go get an instructional video.This is definitely in the realm of the possible for beginners, but do expect a challenge.  If it was totally easy, then it wouldn't be worth doing!  I'm not new to yoga, but am coming back after a long break and this was exactly what I was looking for!The AM set is 34 minutes long.  It gets you warmed up, focused and energized for your day.  My only regret is that I don't normally have time to do it before work and have to save it for the weekends.The PM set is 26 minutes long.  It is exactly what I need at the end of the day.  By the time I get to the final resting pose, I feel as though I could lay there in a trance on my yoga mat for the whole rest of the night.  It is perfect on the days when I do a hard elliptical training after work and need something soothing to stretch out my muscles and calm my mind.Elena is a magnificent instructor.

Although I still need to maintain a cardio routine to fend off my gut, I also want a decent strength and flexibility workout that won't send me to the ER.  ""AM & PM Yoga for Beginners"" fits nicely into the latter category.This DVD comes with two thirty-minute workouts that can be done separately or all together (a half-hour is my yoga limit).  Both are led by the competent Elena Brower via voice-over, and are set on, as the package states, ""a beautifully serene location overlooking the Pacific Ocean.""  The accompanying music is good and soothing, although the lower range during the PM workout was a bit overwhelming to the speakers on my Samsung 32"" LCD TV.AM Workout: This routine is the more challenging of the two and is meant to gear you up for the day.  It contains the usual downward dogs, planks, twisted lunges, warriors, and so forth.  Although the workout can be done without a cardio-type warm-up, I like to do so because it loosens me up and makes the poses more accessible.  I'd classify the AM Workout more towards the intermediate side due to the tougher poses (particularly Warrior 3 and Side Balance).  Indeed, if you're new to yoga I recommend beginning with the PM Workout.PM Workout: This is a nice end-of-day routine, meant to relax you before bedtime.  The most strenuous parts of the routine are a couple of planks and downward dogs, but there are plenty of stretching poses like pigeon and seated twists to ease you into restfulness.  Even though it's less strenuous than the AM workout, I still found it profitable to warm up beforehand with some cardio.  I found the instructor's suggestion to sit on a pillow to raise my seat to knee level during the seated portion helpful (it was the first time I'd tried that particular prop).Ms. Brower's instruction is clear and easy to follow.  She's quite graceful, and her movements through the poses provide a good example (she suggests easier modifications as necessary).  Her focus on proper breathing and a serene mental attitude throughout both routines is unobtrusive.  I found it comforting that she pointed out how each side of the body can respond differently to a pose (I previously found that fact a bit disconcerting).""AM & PM Yoga for Beginners"" is a fine addition to anyone's yoga workout DVD collection (NOTE: for every four Element DVDs sold, the company will plant a tree...sweet!).  I liked both routines, especially since they didn't exceed my maximum yoga workout length tolerance.  In addition, I recommend Sara Ivanhoe's excellent and accessible 20-Minute Yoga Makeover series if you also enjoy shorter yoga workouts or are considering adding yoga to your exercise routine for the first time.

I loved her language in the DVD as well.  She used terms like ""open your heart"" when you were supposed to lean forward with your chest.

The poses may be easy enough for beginners to tackle, but this is not a video for teaching yoga to a novice.The video consists of two sets of postures (poses, movements), one for morning and one for evening. Elena Brower obviously knows her stuff, and each pose is shown from a variety of angles. The narration is helpful and clear. There are some instructions for a few variations based on the learner's abilities.While the video is well shot and the poses well done, I find it lacking in instructional value. There is too much unexplained jargon; ""soften your eyes,"" ""inhale brightly open,"" and so on. The yogic names, when used, are not explained, spelled out onscreen, or pronounced slowly. There is no booklet included to explain, define, or clarify any of the material. Someone already familiar with yoga, or other similar  practices, could learn the routines fairly easily from this video.This all serves to make it more difficult for a rank beginner who might want to start learning yoga from this video. The routines are great, and would be a wonderful addition to one's yoga regime.

Is it written somewhere that most yoga videos need to be shot in Hawaii?  Hahahaha.Yes, the routines are fairly basic, but they a challenging enough for advanced practitioners as well. The first few sessions you will probably need to watch more than exercise as many movements require taking your eyes off the screen.  But only for brief periods and the learning curve is low.The morning session last just over half an hour, and while you won't get out of breath, I do perspire and feel very relaxed and alert afterwards.  The many downward facing dog poses really stretch the legs and back and get the blood flowing.  I found the pace a bit slow, others find it fast, so that aspect is really subjective.  All the while Elena talks you through it and she explains things very well.The PM session is even more mellow and perfect for before bed.  The predominance of seated poses keep you from raising the heart rate too much.  Lost in the moves, the 28 minute session is over before you know it. Afterwards I am loose and relaxed and ready to hit the pillow.I recommend a yoga mat for the AM routine, but you don't really need it for the PM version.

Each pose slowly unfolds with modifications given.  She encourages students to use a Yoga cushion, which she says may be used for various seated positions. I like the backdrop (Pacific Ocean), and her voice is soothing, as well as the music. The workouts are well-organized, and have a nice flow.The AM routine is more the vigorous segment, to wake up to. There are a lot of ""down dog"" positions in this sequence, for me.  These I find can be stressful for a beginner with little upper-body strength; however, all the other positions are doable, and if not, there is a modification.  I just do my best.  One of the most challenging of poses is ""boat pose"", where you get to choose various levels of intensity, all the way up to ""V"" pose, where you are using your core the most. Elena winds this segment up with stretches.The PM portion of this DVD is very gentle Yoga.  Basic poses. Stretches. It is relaxing and sleep-inducing.

1169000,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B001AYWY68,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","I own several yoga DVDs and greatly appreciate the benefits yoga brings - better sense of balance, improved flexibility, ability to handle stress and to relax more. Yoga is something that every human could draw from, if they could only find a half hour each day to dedicate to its practice.Yoga AM PM gives you that ability. You get two quick routines - one for the morning, one for the evening, and neither one is a high challenge. Both are routines that the most basic of people could give a try and find success with. The instructor does a great job of offering options. If you can't touch your toes, reach for your thighs instead. If you can't fold flat, fold partially. She is always instructing you to take your time, to be patient, to go at your own pace. Yoga is not a competition. It is about stretching your own personal horizons.The landscape is beautiful - flowers, ocean - but really, after the first watch or two you aren't looking at the TV at all. You are immersed in your own practice, listening to her voice, going through the moves in your own space. I greatly appreciate that they filmed it in a ""pretty place"" but in the overall scheme of things that isn't as important as the vocal quality. They did an awesome job in both areas so I think people with either type of orientation will be happy.I do wish there was more here. Most DVDs I own have multiple tracks, with a wide variety of routines to work through. Here you only have two. AM. PM. That's it. I really think for a DVD they should have had more information. If nothing else, as this is for beginners, they should have had some sort of an ""intro track"" that explained what downward facing dog, child's pose, etc. really were all about. I have done yoga for a while so when the instructor says ""go up into downward facing dog"" I don't think about it, I simply do it. If someone really was a true beginner and grabbed this DVD to get started, they would have no idea what was being asked of them. I definitely do thing a track of ""intro to yoga"" and then another track of ""the basic moves and information about each one"" would be quite warranted here.So that is my caveat.

This one is great and I'm glad I decided to give it a go.  I didn't get it the first time round but I'm finding it getting a little easier with each go and now I'll be enjoying the challenge of progressing to a higher level of it.This has a gorgeous setting outdoors by the ocean and so that in itself is nice and relaxing.  The AM segment is done with standing movements to help energize you and the PM segment is more focused on relaxing and elongating your muscles and nice stretches.  I find down dog and sun salutation to be my two favourite moves here.  Ellen is a great instructor who has the perfect soft voice for yoga teaching and the way she describes the moves, helps you visualise them without necessarily having to look at your tv set.While I'm new to yoga, I do find this great.  As I mentioned, yoga usually seemed intimidating yet this workout isn't that at all.  So if you haven't tried it before (or you have and didn't like it), I think this workout will suit you.

The AM routine is good too, kind of winding the body up for the day ahead.The language is easy to follow and specifics are provided for a beginner.  Some of the terminology is very ""yoga"" but if you plan to keep at it, you will need know the terms and this is a good introduction.My minor complaint is that it is only one 30 minute routine for AM and PM.

Your experience, fitness level, ability, and enthusiasm are all factors.  I've practiced yoga for several years, never seriously.  I don't do it for the spiritual reasons I've heard about, I do it for the physical challenge, so I can only discuss that aspect of this video.  I've taken classes and have several favorite DVDs.  I'm not an expert at all, more of an enthusiastic amateur.  Last year I stopped yoga entirely due to an injury.This video was a good way to reintroduce myself.  Elena Brower leads by example with form and grace.  Though I've done most of these poses for years, she describes them in a way that shows them in a new light to me, and makes me reconsider and improve my own form.  Her voice is clear and soothing without making me sleepy, which is very important first thing in the morning.For each pose which might be difficult for the beginner or for those with limitations, she offers less strenuous alternatives.  These are displayed effortlessly as a natural part of the sequence.  There was only one pose in the AM segment that I felt I needed to skip because I thought it might aggravate my knee injuries.Both segments are half an hour long.  This might be more time than some folks have to spend in a busy morning, but I recommend at least starting the sequence and continuing for as long as possible, until reality intrudes.  Within 15 minutes of starting the AM sequence I felt quite awake and alive.The PM sequence is an excellent stretching routine, and because I've let that practice slide I found it to be more physically challenging.  I'm looking forward to doing this regularly, and I can tell that once I'm used to it, it will be useful to relax and unwind.This video probably won't be useful to the most advanced yoga practitioners, but I'd guess that few videos are.  For those at an intermediate level, this will be a useful addition to your library.  For the beginner, prepare to be challenged, but know that you'll be able work your way up to the challenge at your own pace.",4,"Challenging, educational... and very enjoyable.",1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2103,"['think', 'lot', 'what', 'get', 'fitness', 'video', 'what', 'put', 'Your', 'experience', 'fitness', 'level', 'ability', 'enthusiasm', 'are', 'factors', ""'ve"", 'practiced', 'yoga', 'several', 'years', 'never', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'spiritual', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'do', 'physical', 'challenge', 'can', 'only', 'discuss', 'aspect', 'video', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'classes', 'have', 'several', 'favorite', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'amateur', 'Last', 'year', 'stopped', 'entirely', 'due', 'injury.This', 'video', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'reintroduce', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'example', 'form', 'grace', ""'ve"", 'done', 'most', 'poses', 'years', 'way', 'new', 'light', 'reconsider', 'improve', 'own', 'form', 'voice', 'clear', 'soothing', 'making', 'sleepy', 'very', 'important', 'first', 'thing', 'morning.For', 'pose', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'beginner', 'limitations', 'less', 'strenuous', 'alternatives', 'are', 'displayed', 'effortlessly', 'natural', 'part', 'sequence', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'pose', 'AM', 'segment', 'felt', 'needed', 'skip', 'thought', 'might', 'aggravate', 'knee', 'injuries.Both', 'segments', 'are', 'hour', 'long', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'time', 'folks', 'have', 'spend', 'busy', 'morning', 'recommend', 'least', 'starting', 'sequence', 'continuing', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'reality', 'intrudes', '15', 'minutes', 'starting', 'AM', 'sequence', 'felt', 'quite', 'awake', 'alive.The', 'PM', 'sequence', 'excellent', 'stretching', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'let', 'practice', 'slide', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'physically', 'challenging', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'regularly', 'can', 'tell', 'once', ""'m"", 'used', 'will', 'be', 'useful', 'relax', 'unwind.This', 'video', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'useful', 'most', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'practitioners', ""'d"", 'guess', 'few', 'videos', 'are', 'intermediate', 'level', 'will', 'be', 'useful', 'addition', 'library', 'beginner', 'prepare', 'be', 'challenged', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'work', 'way', 'challenge', 'own', 'pace']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

Or something about the instructor always annoys me and I turn it off.  I loved this video.  It's the first yoga video I've ever made it through and definitely the first one I want to put back in and do it again.  What made me want to do it is I have a hip that has been aching and I thought the stretches would do it good and it did!  For the first time in weeks I woke up without hip pain today.There were a couple poses that I'm just not able to do, but not many and on those I just did what I could and focused on my breathing.  The setting is gorgeous and peaceful, it looks like a park right by the ocean, as are the voice of the woman and the colors of the clothes she wears (peach in one, lavender and tan in the other).  And I like that she isn't speaking while she's doing it, that it's a calm voice over.Some tips for doing it...if you wear glasses and contacts, go with the contacts while doing it.  Some times you have to put your head down on the mat and can't if you have glasses on or in that downward dog or whatever it's called, your glasses can fall off your face.  Don't wear too baggy of clothing, it gets in the way in some of the poses.  Put noise distractions out of the room (in my case a little dog that likes to hop all over me when I'm on the floor or whines when I won't engage in play which he thinks I'm doing).I like doing the PM one in the morning too because I can't believe how calm I feel after it.

The video is a little over 60 minutes long and is geared primarily for beginners like myself. There are two parts to it: a morning routine and an evening routine.I liked the morning routines as I am much more of a morning than an evening yoga-`person'. The morning routine teaches very basic poses of stretching, bending and exercising the muscles gently and in my opinion is a great experience.With the nightly routines, I felt a bit more stretched as the poses there exercise different body muscles.I like the sounds in this video, but could recommend more Theta-waved geared music for the nightly exercises.",3,Good morning routines for beginners,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,680,"['first', 'yoga', 'video', 'experience', 'been', 'very', 'satisfying', 'one', 'video', 'little', '60', 'minutes', 'long', 'geared', 'primarily', 'beginners', 'are', 'two', 'parts', 'morning', 'routine', 'evening', 'routine.I', 'liked', 'morning', 'routines', 'am', 'much', 'more', 'morning', 'evening', 'yoga-', 'person', 'morning', 'routine', 'teaches', 'very', 'basic', 'poses', 'stretching', 'bending', 'exercising', 'muscles', 'gently', 'opinion', 'great', 'experience.With', 'nightly', 'felt', 'bit', 'more', 'stretched', 'poses', 'there', 'exercise', 'different', 'body', 'muscles.I', 'sounds', 'video', 'could', 'recommend', 'more', 'Theta-waved', 'geared', 'music', 'nightly']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners
1169014,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,B001AYWY68,Sincerely Yours,"[2, 3]","I have been a yogi for some time and have tried many yoga dvds be it beginner or otherwise.  This dvd may call itself a beginner, which I concur with, but I think yogis would also benefit from the gentle voice of Elena Brower that incorporates conscious breathing,traditional sun salutations,hip openers, mini prayers injected and very good instructions where I did not have to constantly look at the screen.  This is not a power yoga.  Although there are AM and PM sections, I think you can do either, but I did find I liked PM for spine and back stretches, which  for me is where I build a lot of stress.  The PM is focused on shifting breathing and being conscious of the tensions in your 'tired' body and slowly stretching the muscles - ooh it does feel good, be prepared for more twisting and stretching than the AM section.The dvd would work for older people who are looking for the benefits without overstretching as there are also modified positions.  I love the fact that breathing is incorporated in the moves.The AM is 35 minutes long and PM is about 26 minutes or you can do both together, which works better for me at the weekend.I think this is definately one of the best beginner's AM/PM combo.  I am going to use this dvd a lot more often than most 'beginners' dvds.",5,"very gentle, breathing focused and great yoga dvd",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1282,"['have', 'been', 'yogi', 'time', 'have', 'tried', 'many', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'be', 'beginner', 'otherwise', 'dvd', 'may', 'call', 'beginner', 'concur', 'think', 'would', 'also', 'benefit', 'gentle', 'voice', 'Elena', 'Brower', 'conscious', 'breathing', 'traditional', 'sun', 'salutations', 'hip', 'openers', 'mini', 'prayers', 'injected', 'very', 'good', 'instructions', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'constantly', 'look', 'screen', 'not', 'power', 'yoga', 'are', 'AM', 'PM', 'sections', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'either', 'did', 'find', 'liked', 'PM', 'spine', 'back', 'stretches', 'where', 'build', 'lot', 'stress', 'PM', 'focused', 'shifting', 'breathing', 'being', 'conscious', 'tensions', ""'tired"", 'body', 'slowly', 'stretching', 'muscles', 'ooh', 'feel', 'good', 'be', 'prepared', 'more', 'twisting', 'stretching', 'AM', 'section.The', 'dvd', 'would', 'work', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'benefits', 'overstretching', 'are', 'also', 'modified', 'positions', 'love', 'fact', 'breathing', 'incorporated', 'moves.The', 'AM', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'PM', '26', 'minutes', 'can', 'do', 'together', 'better', 'weekend.I', 'think', 'definately', 'one', 'best', 'beginner', 'AM/PM', 'combo', 'am', 'going', 'use', 'dvd', 'lot', 'more', 'often', 'most', ""'beginners"", 'dvds']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

1169016,A1C139F5C7Y38P,B001AYWY68,"The Matrix Fan ""Video Gamer since 1979.""","[1, 1]","The DVD starts out with an introduction from Elena Brower, a 15-year yoga teacher & co-founder of Virayoga. She explains the goals of each program - the AM session is designed to invigorate tone and streamline the body, while the PM session is designed to dissolve stress and expand our breathing capacity.We have a brief menu where we can select either the AM or PM session, or if we wish to, we can play both the AM and PM sessions.Let's review the AM session first.Our session is conducted outside on a sunny day near the Pacific Ocean, with a very soothing piano tune playing in the background.  Our only companion is our instructor, Elena Brower. From the get-go, she has us start on our yoga mat and goes right into the Mountain Pose (Tadasana).I was a little nervous because I didn't know any yoga terminology, but as I soon discovered, it wasn't necessary. She talked very softly and evenly throughout the session, and mentions how the AM session is designed to prepare us for the day we are about to face.  We progressed through various yoga positions such as Child's Pose, Downward Facing Dog, Plank Pose, Twisted Lunge, and Warrior's Pose, among others. She gives very concrete examples on how to do each pose correctly. Here's an example:""...As you exhale, bend your front knee to just over your front foot, tracking that knee toward your fourth toe into Warrior II, Virabhadrasana II. As you inhale, straighten your front leg again, arms stay open.""Unlike other exercise videos, I didn't find myself wheezing or hoping the program would end quickly. I found the poses were explained very well, and each time I did the video, I found myself stretching further than my previous sessions. I could barely believe that 35 minutes had passed!Now, for the PM session:It's the same outdoor setting, but the sky is slightly overcast, to give an impression that the day is at an end. Instead of the piano, we have a slow guitar tune playing in the background. Sounds of inhalation and exhalation are heard during our exercises; which add to the relaxation we feel. Elena Brower gently offers suggestions throughout the session that moments of listening at the end of our day help to clear tension by focusing on our breathing instead of our thoughts, preparing for a restful sleep.Our PM session begins with breathing exercises and slowly moves into poses like Pigeon Prep, Seated Twist, Plank Pose, and others. As before, clear instructions are given:""Gently shift your seat over to your right side so that your right foot is now beneath you and your left foot is on the left side of your seat. Place your left hand on your right knee and your right hand on the floor next to your right seat for Seated Twist, Bharadvajasana I.""I felt very relaxed during this session. As before, the instructions were very easy to follow and I felt much more relaxed at the end of a long day of working. The 28 minutes just flew by - we spent over three minutes on our backs to relax before bringing the PM session to a close.On the whole, I enjoyed this DVD very much. I didn't feel rushed, I could do each pose without having to stare at the television every time, and I felt energized to face my workday as well as relaxed before sleeping. If the other videos in the Element series from Anchor Bay are as well done as this DVD was, I may have to try them out.If you're interested in giving yoga a try, this DVD is a great place to start.",5,Interested in trying yoga?

1169017,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B001AYWY68,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[8, 10]","LCW on September 27, 2008 wrote a great detailed review explaining the moves in the 25-30 min each two sessions.Elena Brower did a great job here of creating flow & keeping the pace calming, slow enough for you to be able to feel how the poses benefit your body, yet fast enough that today's rushed feeling population won't feel bored. She has a great voice that is never irritating or forced slow voiceover like some other yoga dvds. She teaches YOUR left/right so you can mirror her image & follow easily. I've tried over 150 yoga dvds & there are not that many I feel have body awareness like Elena. She has done a great job of telling you what body parts to be aware of in terms of changes & she's very accurate. She will ask you which lung feels more open & to breathe and put focus on them so they are both more open & I never realized my left lung felt soo tight & in the several seconds it really helped open up my breathing capacity. Everything she said was perfect, not too much info, not too little. Even though I was in a rush & normally I'll FFW through child's pose or simple resting sitting poses, I didn't want to miss anything she might teach/say.This is for beginners, the AM will be more likely to make you sweat, though it's for beginners. If it's not hard enough, you can always go deeper into the pose, hold harder poses longer (replay portion/pause dvd as well), do downward dog with only 1 leg 3 legged down dog), etc. Yoga dvds are very versatile depending on endurance level & beginner dvds tend to have more rest periods, so you can hold or re-do a hard pose while they are resting. If you want it easier, you can get out & rest sooner then the instructor. The PM is more about easy stretches that won't make you sweat & to relax you to help you sleep.I find any workouts that don't incorporate body awareness is a waste as well as boring. To be taught to be more aware is empowering as well as feeling of more benefit other then calorie burn or muscle building & positive feeling during & after. This feeling will carry over to mood as well & effect your interaction with the world around you in a better way.The only yoga dvd instructors I love that are very calming w/o being boring or annoying w/TRUE body awareness are:Rodney Yee, Rainbow Mars, Seane Corn, Gurutej Kaur, Kristin Mcgee, Wai Lana, Kristen Strohecker, Max Strom, Teigh McDonough, Ateeka, Jacquie Noelle Greaux, Shiva Rea (only for those with endurance) & now add Elena Brower.Non-yoga/non-belly or latin dance fitness body awareness instructors:Duncan Wong, Kari Anderson, Liz Gillies, Stephanie Herman, Rael IsacowitzIf you want to take charge of your health, not just lose calories/build muscle (though yoga does that great as well), more body awareness w/o feeling it a mindless workout, give this a chance.",5,Extensive help in body awareness & very calming w/o ever thinking it's boring,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,2806,"['LCW', 'September', '27', '2008', 'wrote', 'great', 'detailed', 'review', 'explaining', 'moves', '25-30', 'min', 'two', 'sessions.Elena', 'Brower', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'creating', 'flow', 'keeping', 'pace', 'calming', 'slow', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'how', 'poses', 'benefit', 'body', 'fast', 'today', 'rushed', 'feeling', 'population', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bored', 'great', 'voice', 'never', 'irritating', 'forced', 'slow', 'voiceover', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'YOUR', 'left/right', 'can', 'mirror', 'image', 'follow', 'easily', ""'ve"", 'tried', '150', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'feel', 'have', 'body', 'awareness', 'Elena', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'what', 'body', 'parts', 'be', 'aware', 'terms', 'changes', 'very', 'accurate', 'will', 'ask', 'lung', 'feels', 'more', 'open', 'breathe', 'put', 'focus', 'are', 'more', 'open', 'never', 'realized', 'left', 'lung', 'felt', 'soo', 'tight', 'several', 'seconds', 'really', 'helped', 'open', 'up', 'breathing', 'capacity', 'Everything', 'said', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'info', 'not', 'too', 'little', 'Even', 'was', 'rush', 'normally', ""'ll"", 'FFW', 'child', 'pose', 'simple', 'resting', 'sitting', 'poses', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'anything', 'might', 'teach/say.This', 'beginners', 'AM', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'sweat', 'beginners', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'can', 'always', 'go', 'deeper', 'pose', 'hold', 'harder', 'poses', 'longer', 'replay', 'portion/pause', 'dvd', 'well', 'do', 'downward', 'dog', 'only', '1', 'leg', '3', 'legged', 'down', 'dog', 'etc', 'dvds', 'are', 'very', 'versatile', 'depending', 'endurance', 'level', 'beginner', 'dvds', 'tend', 'have', 'more', 'rest', 'periods', 'can', 'hold', 're-do', 'hard', 'pose', 'are', 'resting', 'want', 'easier', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'rest', 'sooner', 'then', 'instructor', 'PM', 'more', 'easy', 'stretches', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sweat', 'relax', 'help', 'sleep.I', 'find', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'incorporate', 'body', 'awareness', 'waste', 'as', 'well', 'boring', 'be', 'taught', 'be', 'more', 'aware', 'empowering', 'as', 'well', 'feeling', 'more', 'benefit', 'other', 'then', 'calorie', 'burn', 'muscle', 'building', 'positive', 'feeling', 'feeling', 'will', 'carry', 'mood', 'as', 'well', 'effect', 'interaction', 'world', 'better', 'way.The', 'only', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'instructors', 'love', 'are', 'very', 'calming', 'w/o', 'being', 'boring', 'annoying', 'w/TRUE', 'body', 'awareness', 'are', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Rainbow', 'Mars', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'Gurutej', 'Kaur', 'Kristin', 'Mcgee', 'Wai', 'Lana', 'Kristen', 'Strohecker', 'Max', 'Strom', 'Teigh', 'McDonough', 'Ateeka', 'Jacquie', 'Noelle', 'Greaux', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'only', 'endurance', 'now', 'add', 'Elena', 'Brower.Non-yoga/non-belly', 'latin', 'dance', 'fitness', 'body', 'awareness', 'instructors', 'Duncan', 'Wong', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'Liz', 'Gillies', 'Stephanie', 'Herman', 'Rael', 'IsacowitzIf', 'want', 'take', 'charge', 'health', 'not', 'just', 'lose', 'calories/build', 'muscle', 'yoga', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'body', 'awareness', 'feeling', 'mindless', 'workout', 'give', 'chance']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

The instruction is impeccable, the music is nice, the instructor's voice is soothing, the scenery is great and the poses are geared more toward a beginning practitioner than others I've viewed and practiced.The AM routine is a 35 minute standing practice starting with a 4 minute warm-up.  The warm-up consist of arm raises with coordinated breathing, forward standing folds, cat-cow stretches and downward dog.The rest of the practice includes a vinyasa (flow) of Down dog and plank, childs' pose, cat-cow poses, lunges, Warriors 1, 2, & 3 and a sitting relaxation at the end.  I think that beginners may find the Down Dog/Plank flow challenging and also the Warrior 3, but it is doable with practice.The PM practice starts sitting and on the ground beginning with deep breathing, spinal waves, cobra's, and a variety of poses on the floor and ground that increase flexabilitiy and relaxation.  At the end of this 26 minute practice is a nice lying down relaxation and short sitting meditation.  Since it is on the ground for the most part, the heart rate stays steady and you won't exert yourself before bed.I think most beginners would enjoy this DVD as the instructor does give modifications for most poses and the instructions and suggestions for making the poses more comfortable are great.Worth the money.",5,One of my new favorite beginner DVD's,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1370,"['one', 'new', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'instruction', 'impeccable', 'music', 'nice', 'instructor', 'voice', 'soothing', 'scenery', 'great', 'poses', 'are', 'geared', 'more', 'beginning', 'practitioner', 'others', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'practiced.The', 'AM', 'routine', '35', 'minute', 'standing', 'practice', 'starting', '4', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'warm-up', 'consist', 'arm', 'raises', 'coordinated', 'breathing', 'forward', 'standing', 'folds', 'cat-cow', 'stretches', 'downward', 'dog.The', 'rest', 'practice', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'Down', 'dog', 'plank', 'childs', 'pose', 'cat-cow', 'poses', 'lunges', 'Warriors', '1', '2', '3', 'sitting', 'relaxation', 'end', 'think', 'beginners', 'may', 'find', 'Down', 'Dog/Plank', 'flow', 'challenging', 'also', 'Warrior', '3', 'doable', 'practice.The', 'PM', 'practice', 'sitting', 'ground', 'beginning', 'deep', 'breathing', 'spinal', 'waves', 'cobra', 'variety', 'poses', 'floor', 'ground', 'increase', 'flexabilitiy', 'relaxation', 'end', '26', 'minute', 'practice', 'nice', 'lying', 'down', 'relaxation', 'short', 'sitting', 'meditation', 'ground', 'most', 'part', 'heart', 'rate', 'stays', 'steady', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exert', 'bed.I', 'think', 'most', 'beginners', 'would', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'give', 'modifications', 'most', 'poses', 'instructions', 'suggestions', 'making', 'poses', 'more', 'comfortable', 'are', 'money']",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners
