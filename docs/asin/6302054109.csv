293687,A1M26ZBUZRVQT1,6302054109,"AllReviews ""Your Mo-o-o-o-vieMaven's Kwik Kri...","[1, 1]","Green Card  (1990) Andie McDowell, Gerard DepardieuWhile this is basically yer garden variety ""chick movie"", it goes one better by having some superbly done, charming scenes and clever plot devices. In one engrossing scene, for instance, our two would be lovers have only a weekend to get to know each other, create a history for themselves and memorize facts before interviews at the INS office on Monday. They end up having so much fun faking photographs in bogus locations and laughing it up that when, the doorbell rings suddenly - instantly sucking them back into the real world - they are genuinely startled. So is the viewing audience....you get that caught up in the characters. Ethan Phillips (Nelix from Voyager) is great as a suspicious INS agent who is on to their scam. This one was directed by Peter Weir (I assume in one of his earlier American film efforts) and he throws in a couple of clever plot devices such as starting out the movie with Gerard's & Andie's characters on their ""wedding day"" and taking a little while to let us in on the rationale of why they did this thing. Another good one is Depardieu's character's original ""composition"" which is preceded by a moment of silence that rivals the chasm of the grand canyon. Not to give anything away, but the ambiguous ending is just the icing on this entertaining slice-of-life cake, which got the Golden Globe for best picture that year.",4,A Timeless Charmer,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1412,"['Green', 'Card', '1990', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'Gerard', 'DepardieuWhile', 'basically', 'yer', 'garden', 'variety', 'chick', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'having', 'superbly', 'done', 'charming', 'scenes', 'clever', 'plot', 'devices', 'one', 'engrossing', 'scene', 'instance', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'lovers', 'have', 'only', 'weekend', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'create', 'history', 'memorize', 'facts', 'interviews', 'INS', 'office', 'Monday', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'faking', 'photographs', 'bogus', 'locations', 'laughing', 'up', 'when', 'doorbell', 'suddenly', 'instantly', 'sucking', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'genuinely', 'startled', 'viewing', 'audience', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'characters', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'Nelix', 'Voyager', 'great', 'suspicious', 'INS', 'agent', 'who', 'scam', 'one', 'was', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'assume', 'one', 'earlier', 'American', 'film', 'efforts', 'couple', 'clever', 'plot', 'devices', 'such', 'starting', 'out', 'movie', 'Gerard', 'Andie', 'characters', 'wedding', 'day', 'taking', 'little', 'let', 'rationale', 'why', 'did', 'thing', 'good', 'one', 'Depardieu', 'character', 'original', 'composition', 'preceded', 'moment', 'silence', 'chasm', 'grand', 'canyon', 'Not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'just', 'icing', 'entertaining', 'slice-of-life', 'cake', 'got', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'best', 'picture', 'year']",N/A

Andie and Gerard are so delightful and believable with very real chemistry between them...so interesting how Andie is gorgeous and sexy in this movie even while wearing very semi frumpy 80s styles. As an aside, I see how different actresses have to be nowadays. Overtly sexual ( PS I am NOT a prude) versus Andie's style of sexual in a real and human way via good acting. THAT is a whole other story...sorry for my soapbox but if you get this movie, you will see what I mean. And Gerard has a sexiness about him too, even though he is far from having classically handsome lady killer looks.They were wonderful together in this movie!Anyway, if you want a very clever love story, with heart, humor, passion, not to mention a killer apartment with greenhouse!, and lots of really wonderful New York City scenes, this is a wonderful movie.

293689,A1YCV76MUFESR1,6302054109,Anne-Marie G,"[0, 4]","Gerard Depardieu is amazing, its pretty hard to argue that point.  So inspite of my usual tepid response to McDowell, I picked this up at the video store.  The opening scene for me didn't really tie into the action of the film--a kid baning on a drum as if he is on his last breath (I suppose in a grander sense it does) But it left me with a very disjointed feeling from the begining, we start off with the marriage of the two main characters, knowing nothing about them, essentially. (This works for and against the movie).They are each marrying because marriage will give them something they want, he a Green Card, she a Green House. (Why she needs a green house so desperately, or can't get one else where is sort of unexplained, how convenient--or why she didn't marry her safe boyfriend...)A snag in the Green Card proceedings occur when he has difficulting showing one of the investigators where the restroom of her apartment is. So they spend the next several days getting to know each other.  this works for the movie, because the audience is also getting to know them, so the information is not redundant.  However, the audience has also spent the last 45 minutes without much of a connection to either character, because we knew so little about them until now.  She explains her well to do upbringing in a loving family, whlie he reminices about his life on the wrong side of the street.The ending was almost bittersweet in that it leaves the audience wanting the neat Hollywood ending (which is not given, cruel!  Almost makes me want to watch it again to see all of that build up again)Bronte is a sort of dumb character who has a very blinded view of the world and of the people in it.  She has considerable growth in the movie, in regards to Georges at least.  He seems a little more static, as he always treated her pretty well, its only his regard for her that changed.Some of the supporting characters were pretty amusing, Ethan Phillips, Bebe Neuwerth was probably the gem of the lot.  I wouldn't have minded seeing her in the title role.Not a bad way to spend some time, but I'm not sure of the strengths out weight the weaknesses enough for me to repeatedly watch it--even with Depardieu's amazingness in it.",3,"I watched it for him, and he is why I would watch it again.",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,2229,"['Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'amazing', 'pretty', 'hard', 'argue', 'point', 'inspite', 'usual', 'tepid', 'response', 'McDowell', 'picked', 'up', 'video', 'store', 'opening', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'tie', 'action', 'film', 'kid', 'baning', 'drum', 'last', 'breath', 'suppose', 'grander', 'sense', 'left', 'very', 'disjointed', 'feeling', 'begining', 'start', 'marriage', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'essentially', 'movie', 'are', 'marrying', 'marriage', 'will', 'give', 'something', 'want', 'Green', 'Card', 'Green', 'House', 'Why', 'green', 'house', 'so', 'desperately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'else', 'where', 'sort', 'unexplained', 'how', 'convenient', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'marry', 'safe', 'boyfriend', 'snag', 'Green', 'Card', 'proceedings', 'occur', 'when', 'difficulting', 'showing', 'one', 'investigators', 'where', 'restroom', 'apartment', 'spend', 'next', 'several', 'days', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'movie', 'audience', 'also', 'getting', 'know', 'information', 'not', 'redundant', 'However', 'audience', 'also', 'spent', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'much', 'connection', 'character', 'knew', 'so', 'little', 'now', 'well', 'do', 'upbringing', 'loving', 'family', 'whlie', 'life', 'wrong', 'side', 'street.The', 'ending', 'was', 'almost', 'bittersweet', 'audience', 'wanting', 'neat', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'not', 'given', 'cruel', 'Almost', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'build', 'up', 'again', 'Bronte', 'sort', 'dumb', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'blinded', 'view', 'world', 'people', 'considerable', 'growth', 'movie', 'regards', 'Georges', 'least', 'little', 'more', 'static', 'always', 'treated', 'pretty', 'well', 'only', 'regard', 'changed.Some', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'Bebe', 'Neuwerth', 'was', 'probably', 'gem', 'lot', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'seeing', 'title', 'role.Not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'strengths', 'out', 'weight', 'weaknesses', 'enough', 'repeatedly', 'watch', 'even', 'Depardieu', 'amazingness']",N/A

Attraction of opposites maybe (since I seem to be full of cliches today). There is American Bronte Parrish, played by gorgeous Andie MacDowell - a rich horticulturist from a privileged background that has found the perfect apartment. But only married couples can live there.Then there is French Georges Faure played by Gerard Depardieu at his scruffiest best. Georges comes from a background of poverty and petty crime, and is a composer, wanting a better life for himself.  To get a green card so he can stay and work in the United States, he needs to marry quickly. And so comes a solution for both of them.The problems start when INS officials don't believe they have a real marriage and want to quiz them to prove they actually ""know"" each other. They have to move in together and they learn that familiarity does NOT always breed contempt.I love this movie.  I love MacDowell. I thought Depardieu was the sexiest man ever in it (and couldn't understand why). Of course this was before his airplane escapades.I am glad I finally have my own copy of the movie now and will probably make it an annual event to watch it.I always wished they had made ""Green Card 2"" to follow up on Bronte and Georges' story.Edited: on 05/11/12 to correct spelling of MacDowell.",5,Marriage of inconvenience,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1458,"['Well', 'was', 'tenth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Green', 'Card', 'hardly', 'ever', 'watch', 'movies', 'more', 'once.What', 'little', 'comedy', 'movie', 'made', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'touches', 'heart', 'Attraction', 'opposites', 'maybe', 'seem', 'be', 'full', 'cliches', 'today', 'American', 'Bronte', 'Parrish', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'rich', 'horticulturist', 'privileged', 'background', 'found', 'perfect', 'apartment', 'only', 'married', 'couples', 'can', 'live', 'there.Then', 'French', 'Georges', 'Faure', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'scruffiest', 'best', 'Georges', 'background', 'poverty', 'petty', 'crime', 'composer', 'wanting', 'better', 'life', 'get', 'green', 'card', 'can', 'stay', 'work', 'United', 'States', 'marry', 'quickly', 'so', 'solution', 'them.The', 'problems', 'start', 'when', 'INS', 'officials', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'real', 'marriage', 'want', 'quiz', 'prove', 'actually', 'know', 'other', 'have', 'move', 'together', 'learn', 'familiarity', 'NOT', 'always', 'breed', 'contempt.I', 'love', 'movie', 'love', 'MacDowell', 'thought', 'Depardieu', 'was', 'sexiest', 'man', 'ever', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'course', 'was', 'airplane', 'escapades.I', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'own', 'copy', 'movie', 'now', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'annual', 'event', 'watch', 'it.I', 'always', 'wished', 'had', 'made', 'Green', 'Card', '2', 'follow', 'up', 'Bronte', 'Georges', 'story.Edited', '05/11/12', 'correct', 'spelling', 'MacDowell']",N/A

293695,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,6302054109,D. Munro,"[3, 3]","This movie is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  From the way they are when they meet, it's clear that Bronte and Georges are not impressed with each other (he wants a green card; she wants a high-end apartment with a huge greenhouse).  They see the other as a means to get what they want, not as actual people.  But when they are forced to live together in order to ""cram"" for a detailed interview, they get to know each other as people.  More importantly, they get to know the REAL people beyond what everybody else sees.One touching scene is when they're writing love letters to each other to support some of their more wild stories of Georges having gone to Africa to write music.  (""Africa"" happens to be the name of the cafe where they met and plays an important part in the final scene.)  They spend the days ""studying"" - talking over their past with the other, and even take pictures of themselves on phony vacations.  Part of their studying involves looking through childhood pictures.  When Georges is looking through Bronte's childhood photo album, he spots a picture of her first boyfriend.  ""And it was he who first kissed those lips?"" he asks softly.  It is Georges who is the first to speak aloud of a kiss, giving some indication that kissing Bronte had definitely crossed his mind already.  The sexual tension only gets stronger from there.  Flustered, Bronte ends the conversation and heads to her bedroom, keeping a hesitant eye (and, it seems, a hopeful one) on her bedroom door.  George, who sleeps on the sofa, is watching her bedroom door from the other side.  Both want to approach the other ... but do not give in.  A knock on Bronte's door and a question, ""What side of the bed do you sleep on?"" Bronte answers him, and he responds casually that he'll take the opposite side.  ""Okay,"" she says, and watches the door even harder.  She doesn't tell him no ... but she clearly has no idea what to expect. Georges does NOT enter -- it turns out he was only referring to which answer he would give the INS official as to what side he sleeps on.There is an interesting scene in which Bronte trys to gain her equilibrium.  Georges has gotten under her skin.  After a day in the park where she and Georges have studied (and clearly had fun doing so), she spots her boyfriend Phil, and quickly tells Georges she'll see him later.  She goes on a date with Phil and seems to be thinking of Georges, her attention wandering while Phil seems content to focus on himself or his latest cause. When Phil drops Bronte off at the door, his attentions get too amorous ... and Bronte turns him down.  When her refusals get louder and Phil remains steadfast, Georges makes his presence known.  Phil demands to know who Georges is, and Georges roars angrily, ""I'M THE HUSBAND!"" Phil leaves, and a furious Bronte throws Georges out.  With nowhere to go, Georges sleeps just outside the apartment door in the hallway, awakened by a neighbor who thinks he's a homeless man.  Bronte lets him in, and the two fabricate a cover story that he forgot his key and didn't want to wake Bronte.  Once inside, the two discuss the previous night ... and the sexual tension rises to a crescendo during an argument where Georges defends his actions, saying that he lost control when Phil was bothering her and adamantly stating that Phil is not right for her.  They circle each other, hurling personal barbs ... and the argument becomes a tango of sorts.  Right in the climax of this argument, when Bronte says that she now realizes she hates him (you can tell she doesn't mean that), Georges congratulates her on her first feeling ... and looks up to see the time.  They both realize they are due for their interview with the INS.  The argument forgotten, they immediately work as a team.  They make a mad dash across NYC to get to their interview ... including running through Central Park, hand-in-hand.The passion we see in the final scene was worth the wait.  It had been building up and Andie and Gerard delivered it in the small amount of time the characters were allowed to express it.  Though they clearly love each other, circumstances prevent Bronte and George from ""going all the way"" though I certainly hoped they reunited shortly afterward.  Both characters had changed because of the other and their initial motives for entering into their ""fake"" marriage proved to be less important than the other person.  For me, the highlight of the movie is during this final scene, when Georges walks away after promising to write her everyday ... and Bronte runs after him and hugs him fiercely - one of the most passionate hugs I've ever seen in a movie! This of course leads up to a wonderful, passionate kiss ... one of my absolute favorite rom-com kisses!Andie MacDowell did a great job ... but my favorite in this movie is Gerard Depardieu.  He gives Georges heart, vulnerability, passion, and love.  Bebe Neuwirth is her excellent self as well.  I keep this movie beside ""When Harry Met Sally"" and other favorite movies.

Each with their own agenda, agree to a marriage of convenience and break the law. Bronte's purpose is to have enough money to continue her projects of creating gardens in the inner city for the disadvantaged. George's purpose is to obtain the coveted green card, since he arrived only on a visitor's visa. The unexpected twists and turns in this creative comedy provide great entertainment, making it a ""must see"" film ...The Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) pull a surprise visit to spoil their plans ... Bronte had just moved into an exclusive apartment. She had been interviewd by the tenant's committe to whom she lied that her husband was in Africa, doing academic research on music of the region. George moves in with Bronte as they scheme how to outwit the INS who are investigating if theirs is a ""real marriage"" or a ruse to trick the government. When their personal habits clash - the two realize just how little they know about each other. They share personal information and create a detailed nonexistent past - to outwit the government agents. Gerard Depardieu is amazingly funny as he ad libs scenes inventing stories to cover up his fake husband role ... He is especially effective in scenes where Bronte meets her good friend Lauren, played by the ever dead-pan comedienne, Bebe Niewirth, who is intrigued by George. George does an outstanding performance to impress Lauren's parents at a dinner party in their home. He wins Bronte's affections due to his creativity. Even Bronte's parents are won over by George's antics. Bronte does all she can to make their relationship appear like her cover story and then surprise (!!!),  Philip, her boyfriend enters the picture. Next, the INS visitors arrive and everything goes topsy turvey. The film has one of those unexpected endings that leaves the viewer satisfied but craving for more.

293701,A2N2S9PPHMW016,6302054109,JDavid,"[9, 11]","It is fascinating how people have such diverse and even incompatible understandings of films and books, not to mention other slices of life.My take on ""Green Card,"", unlike other Amazon reviewers, is that it is a fairly serious film, despite its wonderful comic moments and tone.  I saw an unusual plea for the strength, mystery and nobility of marriage in this engaging account of two people who enter into a contrived marriage for their self-seeking ends.  The film actually works for me on two different levels, one as a metaphor for all marriages and another as a sly attempt to break through the modern mentality that sees the institution of marriage as irrelevant.In the film two perfect strangers to each other marry to achieve their individual goals--Georges the Frenchman to get a green card and Bronte the American girl to get a prized apartment with a rare greenhouse.  Their plan was to quickly divorce afterwards and never see each other again.  They are busy pursuing personal ends when this unusual arrangement throws both of their lives into disorder.  Because the INS is suspicious, they are forced to spend time together to prepare for an examination of their marriage.  As a result they fall in love by the story's conclusion and emotionally assent to their legal status as husband and wife.In every marriage the man and woman bring many personal and selfish goals into the relationship.  They are not necessarily getting married out of pure, selfless love for the other and they may not be truly committed to the marital relationship.  The emotional power of love acts as a certain force to overcome some of this natural selfishness.  Love is typically the force that overcomes earlier resistance to marriage but it is not enough to make marriage work.  Marriage also requires a foundational sacred meaning to make people take their marriage promises seriously.  When they do so, their love grows in maturity, loyalty and selflessness.Obviously most people are not plotting to deliberately use marriage as a temporary instrument to achieve a personal wish like Georges and Bronte.  But we are not so different from them as we might think when we use marriage for personal wish fulfillment, rather than as a sacred relationship of community building.  We may feel caught in the marriage web wondering how we got into this mess in the first place, muchlike Bronte does in the film.  But when we stay committed to our spouse and keep our marriage vows, love grows.  In an abbreviated manner, Georges and Bronte too experience the growth of true love after getting married and experiencing the trials of being chained to each other.I also saw the film as a clever endorsement of marriage in an age where many people don't take marriage seriously, either not believing that marriage is important or necessary like many Europeans or reducing marriage to meaning whatever they want it to mean.  In this light the doorman in Bronte's hotel could be viewed as an advocate for a deeper and more profound understanding of marriage.  His life is so far removed from the trendy liberalism of Bronte and the streetwise permissiveness of Georges, both of whom were destined for a lifetime of serial relationships and may never have married anyone absent this quirky twist of circumstance.  His admittedly brief role reminds the viewer of the many decent and unassuming people who take their responsibilities, particularly of marriage and parenthood, seriously.  By the end of the film, Bronte and Georges are becoming more like the doorman and less like themselves.  They both speak tenderly and with appreciation of each other's good and unique qualities in their interviews with the INS officials.  Georges thinks of Bronte's well-being rather than his own lost green card when he is caught in a mistake and their entire scheme is exposed.  Many moderns brought up to disdain natural law and religious interpretations of the deep significance of marriage might at least be tricked into a grudging respect for the marital institution through life experience like Georges and Bronte.Is it just romantic chemistry at work here?  Many may think so but I dissent.  The film depicts romantic chemistry undergirded and galvanized by the bond of marriage, a connection that even when lightly undertaken and even more lightly appreciated, forces a man and woman to think more seriously about the nature of human relationships.  What is the hope for Georges and Bronte at the end of the film, when Georges is to be taken away for probably deportation by the INS just after the two realize their deep love for each other and have emotionally confirmed their legal marriage?  Again, it is the fact that they are married to each other that will provide the likely impetus for their future reunion.  Absent marriage, they are just two lovers who could as easily move on to the next attractive and interesting partner who moves into their environment.  Absent marriage and a high view of marriage, there is never a compelling and authoritative reason for people to stay together.  But as married man and wife, they can never forget that their love has a legal and traditional bond that must be intentionally broken to be dissolved, that they have participated in an ancient institution that reflects the complementary and procreative nature of man and woman.  Marriages can be broken and ended as our divorce rates instruct us.  But the ending of a marriage means tearing a man and woman apart at a level far deeper than the breaking of any other relationship.  Despite the many different ideas about marriage today, I think most people would at least recognize that divorce is qualitatively different from breaking up.I give this thought-provoking film four stars only because a few plot details were not convincing, at least in my one viewing.  Otherwise I found the film to be excellent.",4,More Thoughtful than Appearances,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,5882,"['fascinating', 'how', 'people', 'have', 'such', 'diverse', 'even', 'incompatible',

Fernandez ""Bookiewookie""","[13, 17]","It is uncommon to find, such as in this gem worth keeping, a great combination of casting, feel-good and an almost believable plot (e.g., being asked the brand of Bronte's facial cream or perfume was pushing it),  colorful New York setting (fortunately set somewhere from spring to  summer), fine interior decorating, great camera shots (the fish-eye lens  image of George in that orbiting peephole; watching her at the back of the  elevator as she lets her hair down; the late afternoon light at her deck or  rooftop) and moving soundtrack that I can only describe as trademark Hans  Zimmer.  Everyone was perfect for his and her role, including the  unforgettable Lauren character played by Bebe Neuwirth.  And who could  forget the change of heart in Lauren's mother, in that goofy but  heart-rending piano scene?  That pesky building manager who lives across  the hall, and the equally pesky but well-meaning lobby watchman-guard;  Bronte's Jeff Daniels-ish boyfriend (lesser version, though) who, being an  inflexible person, doesn't quite draw our sympathy; the aging seductress  guest in Lauren's dinner party who checks out George and elaborates,  &quot;The Faure!&quot; and &quot;Whatever do you mean by that???&quot;  It  is a great movie to watch, particularly while falling in love.  Perhaps  when in this emotional state, one can truly relate to the last scene when  she pines hearing from him on that &quot;sunny&quot; rain day, opens the  door to find out it was the doorman (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock thinking  it was Bill Pullman instead of the doting neighbor in &quot;While You Were  Sleeping&quot;), reads the short note to the accompaniment of some  mysterious, enchanting music that gave me goosebumps when I was watching it  at &quot;that&quot; time of my life.  You could feel her emptiness after  they split from the interview and as he walks the various neighborhoods of  the city and later tends for her plants but does not really feel like doing  it.

Despite being directed by a then veteran director Peter Weir it oddly has the feel of a first effort by an up and coming director.Andie MacDowell was a new talent then and puts in an absolutely mediocre effort.  She appears in some scenes to be reading cue cards. It was probably the best she could do. She hadn't yet found her niche and honed her skills as the girlfriend character that would later be her stock in trade.For me the most interesting part of this was Gerard Depardieu.

Penola,"[51, 54]","The slim premise of Green Card -- a French slob wants to be a US citizen; a left-wing socialite wants a fabulous apartment with a greenhouse; they get married -- creeps up on you, and expands in ways that will surprise  you.  Yes, this is a love story, but it is somehow much more than that.  Peter Weir, who directed Witness (a wonderful, evocative romance), has a  way of weaving a spell on you with his movies.  Here, he is aided by the  galvanic performance of Gerard Depardieu, who is life itself.  Andie  MacDowell, who is his inferior in the acting department, is suited to her  uptight role in a way that favors her: you can actually believe she could  be this person, which is usually not the case with this lovely but inept  actress.  Bebe Neuwirth is her usual dead-on self, in a great, if small,  supporting role.  The New York locations, particularly that spectacular  greenhouse apartment, are winning, and shot with affection.  On top of  everything, the movie features, in key moments of tension and emotion, the  music of Enya, which of course elevates and punctuates scenes in inventive  ways.  The final moment is a well-earned emotional one, and I think you,  like me, will find it hard to resist Green Card, after all is said and  done.",4,CAPTIVATING,962064000,"06 27, 2000",2000,1257,"['slim', 'premise', 'Green', 'Card', 'French', 'slob', 'be', 'US', 'citizen', 'left-wing', 'socialite', 'fabulous', 'apartment', 'greenhouse', 'get', 'married', 'up', 'ways', 'will', 'surprise', 'Yes', 'love', 'story', 'somehow', 'much', 'more', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'who', 'directed', 'Witness', 'wonderful', 'evocative', 'romance', 'way', 'weaving', 'spell', 'movies', 'Here', 'aided', 'galvanic', 'performance', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'who', 'life', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'who', 'inferior', 'acting', 'department', 'suited', 'uptight', 'role', 'way', 'can', 'actually', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'person', 'usually', 'not', 'case', 'lovely', 'inept', 'actress', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'usual', 'dead-on', 'self', 'great', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'New', 'York', 'locations', 'particularly', 'spectacular', 'greenhouse', 'apartment', 'are', 'winning', 'shot', 'affection', 'top', 'everything', 'movie', 'features', 'key', 'moments', 'tension', 'emotion', 'music', 'Enya', 'course', 'elevates', 'punctuates', 'scenes', 'inventive', 'ways', 'final', 'moment', 'well-earned', 'emotional', 'one', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'resist', 'Green', 'Card', 'said', 'done']",N/A

The premise of the film - 2 people pretending to be married to get a green card is intriguing, but unfortunately the execution is very poor. No matter how good an actor you are, (and there are many in this film), ultimately there is a limit to how many insipid things you can say. And that's what the dialogue in this film is. There is no chemistry between the hero and heroine in this film, when compared to other great modern film screen couples Tom Hanks  /  Meg Ryan (Joe Versus The Volcano, Sleepless in Seattle) and Bill Pullman / Sandra Bullock (While You Were Sleeping). In these other films the leads give heartwarming and believable performances, you can almost see them falling in love. This is not the case for Green Card , ultimately it fails to convince. If you watched this film and thought it was a great romance, try watching some of the films I mention, believe me you will be captivated.
