1246682,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B0021L8UO4,A. Boston,"[3, 5]","I was looking forward to this movie, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of my favorite comedies and I thought this would have just has many laughs. Greece is one of the places on my list, but I haven't been there yet. The movie gave you a great idea of what's its like to visit and had stunning scenery.Unfortunately, beyond the gorgeous historical Greece, this movie didn't have much to offer. The supporting characters were all one-sided and flat. Definitely the cliche tourists. While I would usually find all those cliche touristy things funny, for some reason the main character's(Georgia) gripes about them were neither funny nor entertaining. I just felt she whined incessantly and moped about, and because of that, always got the short end of the stick. And while the 'love interest' was a nice pick, he doesn't say much, and all of a sudden she realizes he'd gorgeous and has so much depth and heart? It wasn't a well developed script, they could have done a lot more with his character and made you really understand and be rooting for them as couple. Now he's just eye candy at this point. The ending was cheesy and putting a cute little happy ending bow on it, when there was really nothing wrong with her life to begin with besides her bad attitude.Lastly... I love special features and there are none. Only a few previews for other movies.",3,"Flat characters, lacks heart",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1350,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'many', 'laughs', 'Greece', 'one', 'places', 'list', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'yet', 'movie', 'gave', 'great', 'idea', 'what', 'visit', 'had', 'stunning', 'scenery.Unfortunately', 'gorgeous', 'historical', 'Greece', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'one-sided', 'flat', 'Definitely', 'cliche', 'tourists', 'would', 'usually', 'find', 'cliche', 'touristy', 'things', 'funny', 'reason', 'main', 'character', 'Georgia', 'were', 'neither', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'just', 'felt', 'whined', 'incessantly', 'moped', 'always', 'got', 'short', 'end', 'stick', ""'love"", 'interest', 'was', 'nice', 'pick', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'sudden', ""'d"", 'gorgeous', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'heart', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'developed', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'made', 'really', 'understand', 'be', 'rooting', 'couple', 'Now', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'point', 'ending', 'was', 'cheesy', 'putting', 'cute', 'little', 'happy', 'ending', 'bow', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'life', 'begin', 'bad', 'attitude.Lastly', 'love', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'none', 'Only', 'few', 'previews', 'other', 'movies']",My Life in Ruins

1246688,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0021L8UO4,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 16]","For me, `My Life in Ruins' is a colossal failure.  It has all the elements of a failure, and so I should have known walking in that it was going to be bad, but I held out hope because this formula has been known to work when the elements come together in the right way.This film is a waste of time.I say this because `My Life in Ruins' has absolutely no charm.  It has the same scenarios and the same `characters' that all these `finding yourself' romantic comedies has, but it lacks any and all charm.  It is merely a series of events with a slew of mismatched people brought together with reckless abandon to create a hodgepodge of moments we either laugh at (because we have to) or we roll our eyes to.  There needs to be some sort of connective tissue with these films, some sort of entity that draws us in.Nia Vardalos just can't do that.The film follows a single middle-aged (or nearing) woman named Georgia who works as a tour guide in Greece.  She is in love with the culture, but she is disrespected by her boss and co-workers and finds herself consistently stuck with the worst groups and the worst hotels.  When she has finally had enough, she winds up finding happiness thanks to a scruffy driver and a crotchety old widower.Seriously.You can open mouth and insert corn right about now.  The film prides itself on slopping one ridiculous clich&eacute; after another right on you plate, with a healthy dose of stereotypes that don't even have the decency to try and appear fresh.  You have the sullen teenager, the crazy Americans, the fighting married couple, the wise old widow(er); etc.  And then you have the forced sentiment that comes in all shapes and forms, from Poupi (yes, you pronounce his name like the stuff in your toilet) explaining why he loves to drive to Irv pretending to be the oracle (the corniest scene in any film I've seen this year).  The jokes are all tired variations of jokes we've heard a million times.  This entire film just feels like a recycled version a every other comedy you've ever seen (almost).  The acting doesn't make up for it either.  I like Vardalos to an extent, but sadly she hasn't been able to capture the magic she ignited with `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and this surely doesn't help.  Georgoulis may clean up nice, but he's rather flat.  In fact, the only actor who brought anything to the film was Dreyfuss, and sadly he was hampered by being stuck with Mr. Clich&eacute; himself.I highly recommend walking far, far away from this movie.

Otherwise, I don't think any of them would have been involved with ""My Life in Ruins."" This is one of the worst romantic comedies I've seen in a long time, not so much a film as an exercise in meaningless messages and shallow characters. Only the final half hour shows any degree of entertainment, and even then it's a lost cause simply because the payoff wasn't earned. As a vehicle for director Donald Petrie and screenwriter Mike Reiss, it represents a colossal error in judgment, serving as nothing other than a way to spend ninety minutes out of the house. If you're with a date, good luck trying to make up for it afterwards.The story is about Georgia (Vardalos), a Greek American who moved to Greece hoping to teach classical studies. That didn't pan out, so she became a lowly tour guide on a ramshackle bus with no air conditioning. At the start of the film, she learns that she has been ranked as a merely average guide, which is essentially one step away from getting fired. Her brutally honest boss (Bernice Stegers) tells her that she lacks ""kefi,"" the Greek term for mojo or zest for life. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem too keen on helping Georgia find her ""kefi."" If anything, she's happy to let Georgia's competition, a bus driver named Nico (Alistair McGowan), do everything he can make her quit. And no wonder--Nico is given the nice-looking bus with the working air conditioner, and he's purposely assigned the nice Canadian tourists who love him for bypassing all the historical landmarks in favor of gift shops and stalls.So what does that leave Georgia? A mishmash of nationalities that no one seems to like. From America, we have Big Al (Harland Williams) and Kim (Rachel Dratch), perfect examples of why foreigners hate American tourists. We have the fat, clueless, slow witted Gator (Jareb Dauplaise), who unknowingly puts on a T-shirt with a Greek phrase that promotes sodomy. We have Marc (Brian Palermo), an IHOP executive who will gladly drone on and on about the history of pancakes and his collection of rare syrups. And then there's Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), another American; he's loud and obnoxious, cracking very unfunny jokes at Georgia's expense. He also serves as the archetypal wise elder, a lonely widower who inspires Georgia with astute observations on life.From England, we have the kind old woman, Dorcas (Sheila Bernette), who doubles as a pickpocket and shoplifter. We also have the snooty Mr. Tullen (Ian Ogilvy), his icy wife (Caroline Goodall), and their moody teenage daughter (Sophie Stuckey), who spends almost the entire film wearing headphones attached to a non-working MP3 player. From Australia, we have a young couple (Simon Gleeson and Natalie O'Donnell) who spout unintelligible slang and are never seen without a can of Fosters in their hands. From Spain, we have two bitter divorcees (Mar&iacute;a Botto and Mar&iacute;a Ad&aacute;naz) who are apparently not bitter enough to keep looking for their respective Mr. Rights.Finally, there's Alexis Georgoulis as the manly Greek bus driver, Poupi, which unfortunately is pronounced like ""poopy"" (his last name isn't any better). He inevitably becomes Georgia's love interest, although not before he shaves off his thick beard, dresses in nicer clothes, and reveals that he can in fact speak English. He's a student of the Zorba the Greek philosophy, giving Georgia the spiel about living life passionately and without a plan. What no one seems to notice is that he's all talk and no walk. It's not as if he dances in the streets or plays lovelorn melodies on the bouzouki. He's a bus driver, for God's sake. Where's the passion in that?These people are not characters. They're nothing more than caricatures, broadly drawn stereotypes so lacking in depth that they couldn't even aspire to be cardboard cutouts. Even Vardalos, talented though she may be, can't escape the superficiality of her painted face, her bright smile, and her salon-quality hair. Her character is not a woman with genuine problems so much as a byproduct of the romantic comedy paradigm--a nice enough girl trapped in a less-than-ideal situation with no boyfriend. The question is: Will she ever find love, or is she doomed to spend the rest of her days alone? And can she win the hearts and minds of the boorish tourists?Feel free to answer the above questions as you see fit. If there is a reason to see ""My Life in Ruins,"" it would be to look at the ruins, which are not only lovely up there on the screen, but are also hilariously symbolic of the film itself. To say that it goes in the wrong direction would be an understatement; it's tragically misguided, succeeding only as an example of what not to do when making a romantic comedy. It tries to be both an escapist date movie and a message about living life as it happens, but when there's nothing funny or truthful about the story or the characters, all you have is a ridiculous premise about ridiculous people. I can only hope that Nia Vardalos will put this one behind her, after which she can move on to something that will actually connect with the audience.",2,A Greek Tragedy,1244419200,"06 8,

It wasn't until ""My Big Fat Greek Weeding"" became a phenomenon that it was given a re-evaluation.  ""Connie and Carla"" was a gender reversal of ""Some Like It Hot"".

I also find it interesting that her love interests in these films are usually hunky guys (John Corbett, David Duchovny, Alexis Georgoulis).  In real life she's married to the tubby balding Ian Gomez from the late lamented ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"".  Gomez has a bit here as the randy hotel concierge.

How could that be in one of the most picturesque countries in the entire world?Well. . . blame it on Hollywood.Another ""I Love My Greek Ancestry"" vehicle for Greek Canadian actress Nia Vardalos whose one hit wonderMy Big Fat Greek Wedding(2002) still brings a smile to this reviewer's face, ""My Life in Ruins"" formulaically depicts the now skinny Vardalos as fired professor, now reluctant tour guide, Georgia, whose frustrated existence is summed up in a confession which effectively states she hasn't had sex in quite a long while.  Vardalos, who in ""Greek Wedding"" portrayed the overweight yet endearing Tula, shed more than just twenty pounds and some major eyebrow hair.  In ""Ruins"" she misses the mark, seemingly thrilled to show off her new figure and an expertly colored Tina-Fey-as-Sarah-Palin coiffure while sporting ridiculously high heels for her walk up the treacherously steep precipice leading to the Parthenon.  The amusing self-deprecating voice-over of ""Greek Wedding"" becomes cloying as Vardalos rushes from one scene to another hampered by sappy supposedly introspective dialogue, thanks to screenwriter Mike Reiss and 40-ish spinster woe as she sarcastically critiques her lack of romantic situation and then, of course within the span of two hours, as in all Hollywood fractured fairytales, suddenly switches on the light bulb of attitude adjustment, wins the guy and creates a synergistic miracle amongst all her troubled constituents.Whereas Vardolos had a fine supporting cast in her first film---the marvelous Lainie Kazan and the stoically hysterical Michael Constantine as her old-fashioned parents, (remember the crazy aunt whose biopsy showed teeth)--she is barely bolstered by the group of stereotypical tour bus goers that except for veteran actor Richard Dreyfus as the tour's self-appointed schtick-y comedian are simply not all that memorable.  Love interest Alexis Georgoulis definitely radiates attractive male charisma as he transforms from a hairy voiceless creature from Hades to a philosophy spouting demi-god with a six-pack.  However, he doesn't have the well-honed chemistry of John Corbett whose white bread sensitivity and boyish charm offset perfectly Tula's shy and unabashed vulnerability to create movie wow.  Couple Ruin's weak cast with an even weaker storyline: misfit tour director bonds with her disgruntled group to eventually form a mini-village of helping hands complete with the requisite happy ending.Bottom line:  Skip this one.  For a good film about Greece look atZorba the GreekorNever on Sunday.

In what amounts to be a sitcom remake of 1969'sIf It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium, a farce that depicted the whirlwind antics of an American tour group in Europe, this film is even more dependent on stock characters and situations that appear transported from an Eisenhower-era story. Seven years after her unexpected success withMy Big Fat Greek Wedding, star Nia Vardalos looks slimmer and more glamorous than she did in her debut, yet she portrays almost the same self-defeating character as Georgia, a history professor who came to Greece to teach but ends up leading tourists around its ancient ruins. Disappointed with the cards life has dealt to her, she is uptight about her job much to the consternation of her group who want only to have fun rather than an education on ancient Greece.Directed by Donald Petrie (Miss Congeniality) and written by Mike Reiss (episodes ofThe Simpsons) in an extremely slapdash fashion, the story focuses on how Georgia has lost her passion for life (called ""kefi"" in Greek) and how it takes the motley tour group and her attraction to a studly bus driver named Poupi to rediscover it. Vardalos is a likeable presence, but her screen persona is getting redundant as her depiction of an everywoman becomes less credible with her every appearance. Richard Dreyfuss is really slumming here as an avuncular Jewish widow named Irv who acts as Georgia's wizened counselor in love and life. Yet, his Oscar-winning chops at least make his stereotype less offensive and brain-draining than the other actors, in particular, Harland Williams and Rachel Dratch as a mouthy American couple. As Poupi, Greek actor Alexis Georgoulis looks initially like Grizzly Adams, but love transforms him into smoldering eye candy as the movie progresses, which is really the whole point of his role. Rita Wilson shows up in a sentimental cameo as Irv's deceased wife since she and husband Tom Hanks served as executive producers (same as they did with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"").With cinematography by frequent Pedro Almod&oacute;var collaborator Jos&eacute; Luis Alcaine, the Greek locations are refreshing, even though the environs around Valencia, Spain, apparently doubled for much of the country. The 2009 DVD oddly offers three separate commentary tracks from Vardalos, Petrie and Reiss. Vardalos' track is charming but marred by long pauses since she seems to miss someone prompting her to speak, while Petrie's is understandably more technical in nature. Surprisingly, the most entertaining commentary is provided by Reiss, a genuine comedy writer who convinces us that the story is based on his real-life experiences as part of a tour group. There are twelve minutes worth of deleted and alternate scenes, including an excisable alternate ending, and a comic three-minute featurette, ""Everybody Loves Poupi"", that Petrie created by re-editing some of the footage. Even though Vardalos is not at the helm this time (unlike the far more execrable ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" released a month later), I have a feeling that she has more talent than this movie allows her to display.",2,"Shallow Stereotype-Driven Sitcom Shows If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Athens",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,3276,"['clich', 'eacute', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'superficial', '2009', 'comedy', 'deliver', 'anything', 'close', 'wit', 'insight', 'level', 'Hallmark', 'greeting', 'card', 'what', 'amounts', 'be', 'sitcom', 'remake', ""1969'sIf"", 'Tuesday', 'Must', 'Be', 'Belgium', 'farce', 'depicted', 'whirlwind', 'antics', 'American', 'tour', 'group', 'Europe', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'dependent', 'stock', 'characters', 'situations', 'appear', 'transported', 'Eisenhower-era', 'story', 'Seven', 'years', 'unexpected', 'success', 'withMy', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'star', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'slimmer', 'more', 'glamorous', 'did', 'debut', 'almost', 'same', 'self-defeating', 'character', 'Georgia', 'history', 'professor', 'who', 'came', 'Greece', 'teach', 'up', 'leading', 'tourists', 'ancient', 'ruins', 'Disappointed', 'cards', 'life', 'dealt', 'uptight', 'job', 'much', 'consternation', 'group', 'who', 'want', 'only', 'have', 'fun', 'rather', 'education', 'ancient', 'Greece.Directed', 'Donald', 'Petrie', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'written', 'Mike', 'Reiss', 'Simpsons', 'extremely', 'slapdash', 'fashion', 'story', 'how', 'Georgia', 'lost', 'passion', 'life', 'called', 'kefi', 'Greek', 'how', 'motley', 'tour', 'group', 'attraction', 'studly', 'bus', 'driver', 'named', 'Poupi', 'rediscover', 'Vardalos', 'likeable', 'presence', 'screen', 'persona', 'getting', 'redundant', 'depiction', 'everywoman', 'less', 'credible', 'appearance', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'really', 'slumming', 'here', 'avuncular', 'Jewish', 'widow', 'named', 'Irv', 'who', 'Georgia', 'wizened', 'counselor', 'love', 'life', 'Oscar-winning', 'chops', 'least', 'make', 'stereotype', 'less', 'offensive', 'brain-draining', 'other', 'actors', 'particular', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'Rachel', 'Dratch', 'mouthy', 'American', 'couple', 'Poupi', 'Greek', 'actor', 'Alexis', 'Georgoulis', 'initially', 'like', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'love', 'smoldering', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'really', 'whole', 'point', 'role', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'up', 'sentimental', 'cameo', 'Irv', 'deceased', 'wife', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'served', 'executive', 'producers', 'same', 'did', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', '.With', 'cinematography', 'frequent', 'Pedro', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'collaborator', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Luis', 'Alcaine', 'Greek', 'locations', 'are', 'refreshing', 'even', 'environs', 'Valencia', 'Spain', 'apparently', 'doubled', 'much', 'country', '2009', 'DVD', 'oddly', 'three', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Vardalos', 'Petrie', 'Reiss', 'Vardalos', 'track', 'charming', 'marred', 'long', 'pauses', 'miss', 'someone', 'prompting', 'speak', 'Petrie', 'understandably', 'more', 'technical', 'nature', 'Surprisingly', 'most', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Reiss', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'writer', 'who', 'story', 'based', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'part', 'tour', 'group', 'are', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'including', 'excisable', 'alternate', 'ending', 'comic', 'three-minute', 'featurette', 'Everybody', 'Poupi', 'Petrie', 'created', 're-editing', 'footage', 'Even', 'Vardalos', 'not', 'helm', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'execrable', 'Hate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'released', 'month', 'later', 'have', 'feeling', 'more', 'talent', 'movie', 'display']",My Life in Ruins

I bought it because ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" always seems to end to soon, and while this movie is no relation to that one, it serves well as dessert.  That said, this isn't nearly as good as MBFGW.  The plot is simple:  An American college professor of Greek Art History is out of work and doing tours between offers, in Greece.  She wants to share the fine parts of Greek culture with tourists who want to shop, eat ice cream, and suntan at the beach.  She's very uptight.  Because the forward motion of the movie is largely dependent on a bus, the bus is filled with stick figures draped in stereotypes, and so we never really develop a relationship with them, that we had--to some extent--in MBFGW.  Two actors play Aussies, which means a couple hugging cans of Fosters and uttering gibberish from the Book Of Aussie Slang, and nothing else.  The eastern European women say nothing, but dress in print dresses circa 1958.  The Americans all play shades of dumb and rude, save for Richard Dreyfus who plays a God of sorts, and always utters something pithy.  It is Dreyfus' character who helps Nia's character to loosen up.  It takes about half the movie for the film to get moving.Again, I bought it because I liked ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", and recommend it accordingly, to those fans.  If you're considering this film without having seen the other;  I'd first recommend ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", instead, or, ""Bread And Tulips"" which is an Italian effort (with subtitles) that has a similar vein (to this film) in that it starts on a tour (of Italy) and ends in Venice, but has more developed characters and a better story.  On the other hand, if you're snow or rain bound, and want something light, and have some good popcorn and real butter, you won't hate yourself for watching ""My Life in Ruins"".",3,Good.

Aside from the beautiful scenery in Greece, there was no reason to watch it. My wife and I sat through only 40 minutes waiting for something funny to be said by someone, by anyone, before we gave up. Both of us were embarrassed for the lead actress Nia Vardalos. She was terrific in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", but seemed to be struggling to salvage something even marginally humorous from this mess of a movie. The plot was unbelieveable and silly. A college professor, Vardalos, is laid off from her position as a teacher of Greek History and can only find work as a tour guide. She shows her party of tourists (a busload of stereotypes: obnoxious Americans, drunken Australians, hot and hungry for love Spaniards, a bored teenager forced by her parents to take the tour with them, an unfunny guy who tries desperately to string out flat one-liners, etc.) the sights in and around Athens, informing them, without success, about the history and culture of the early Greeks at the ancient ruins they visit, when all the people on the tour really want to do is shop and eat.

I've seenMy Big Fat Greek WeddingandI Hate Valentine's Day (Widescreen).  But I really prefer ""My Life in Ruins.""  It's a great comedy film.

They had perfect chemistry and just the right amount of attitude.I did not know that it was the first time any production was able to film ""The Acropolis"" (according to Wikipedia and the ""London Guide"").  I was in the Navy for 4 years and blessedly visited about 8 countries.  I've been on various tours and made quick tours ourselves (being that each visit lasted no more than 4 days).Seeing this movie reminded me of the adventure of traveling and sight seeing.

While I can see some viewers enjoying this enough to add it to their collection, and certainly the location shots of the wonder and splendor that is Greece shines through, the story here just doesn't rise to the level of something that would likely be viewed multiple times.I give the writers credit for not going for the completely contrived and predictable, but then again what is here is barely above that.  There's humor in watching Georgia (Nia Vardalos) struggle in her job as a tour guide, but the setup is a bit too convenient.  Her tour group, Group B, is a mix of charicatures of various types all of which come together as a perfect mix of personalities that all wind up fitting too neatly with the rest of the group.  As the tour moves along Georgia winds up watching her rival tour guide leading his group, group A, in fun activities that makes her own group jealous and distracted.By the end of the flick, well, let me not give away the ending, even though it's fairly well telegraphed (heck, a blind person could likely see where things are going to go here).  Just be cautioned in advance that what you're watching, while cute, sweet, funny and somewhat entertaining, is also headed right where you expect.Personally I enjoyed the film more than I thought I would, and found several laughs along the way, but again, not enough to inspire me to give this film a buy it recommendation.  Err on the side of caution, rent first if possible.  Those that have an appreciation for Greek history might enjoy this more, and certainly it's a date night flick that both male and female can enjoy, but multiple viewings seems to be a value that just isn't achieved here.",3,"Entertaining, but probably best as a ...",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1767,"['review', 'title', 'here', 'should', 'read', 'Entertaining', 'probably', 'best', 'rental', 'think', 'Unbox', 'can', 'see', 'viewers', 'enjoying', 'enough', 'add', 'collection', 'certainly', 'location', 'shots', 'wonder', 'splendor', 'Greece', 'shines', 'story', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'rise', 'level', 'something', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'viewed', 'multiple', 'times.I', 'give', 'writers', 'credit', 'not', 'going', 'completely', 'contrived', 'predictable', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'here', 'barely', 'humor', 'watching', 'Georgia', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'struggle', 'job', 'tour', 'guide', 'setup', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'tour', 'group', 'Group', 'B', 'mix', 'charicatures', 'various', 'types', 'come', 'together', 'perfect', 'mix', 'personalities', 'wind', 'up', 'fitting', 'too', 'neatly', 'rest', 'group', 'tour', 'moves', 'Georgia', 'up', 'watching', 'rival', 'tour', 'guide', 'leading', 'group', 'group', 'A', 'fun', 'activities', 'own', 'group', 'jealous', 'end', 'flick', 'well', 'let', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'even', 'fairly', 'well', 'telegraphed', 'heck', 'blind', 'person', 'could', 'likely', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'here', 'Just', 'be', 'cautioned', 'advance', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'cute', 'sweet', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'also', 'headed', 'right', 'where', 'expect.Personally', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'found', 'several', 'laughs', 'way', 'again', 'not', 'enough', 'inspire', 'give', 'film', 'buy', 'recommendation', 'Err', 'side', 'caution', 'rent', 'first', 'possible', 'have', 'appreciation', 'Greek', 'history', 'might', 'enjoy', 'more', 'certainly', 'date', 'night', 'flick', 'male', 'female', 'can', 'enjoy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'be', 'value', 'just', ""n't"", 'achieved', 'here']",My Life in Ruins

But really this film was hilarious and really entertaining. Sadly it seems like Nia Vardalos has been 'dismissed' for not coming out with another Big Fat Greek Wedding (even though she still works with many actors from that cast), when really she's got so much more to offer comedically then just a mere sequel. This movie is definitely about finding one's self during circumstances one would rather change.  It's about stepping back, letting things happen, and enjoy life as a result; NOT about trying to control what's beyond our control. Stopping to smell the roses, even when they're not there.
