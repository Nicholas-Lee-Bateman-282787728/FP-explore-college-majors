Spain has never been a world power ever since. I went on board the Olympia, which was Admiral Dewey's flagship in the Phillipines, at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia on the Delaware River when I was going to Temple U. in 1970. Very interesting ship. The United States became a world power after this war. As I write this I actually haven't viewed the DVD yet. It's a documentary so I'm sure I'll enjoy it. I bought the DVD because I was collecting DVDs about each of the United States' wars.",5,"U.S. Beats Spain, becomes world power!",1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,605,"['strange', 'little', 'war', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'Not', 'as', 'quickly', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'pretty', 'quick', 'day', 'Spain', 'never', 'been', 'world', 'power', 'ever', 'went', 'board', 'Olympia', 'was', 'Admiral', 'Dewey', 'flagship', 'Phillipines', 'Penn', 'Landing', 'Philadelphia', 'Delaware', 'River', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'Temple', 'U.', '1970', 'Very', 'interesting', 'ship', 'United', 'States', 'became', 'world', 'power', 'war', 'write', 'actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'DVD', 'yet', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'collecting', 'DVDs', 'United', 'States', 'wars']",The History Channel Presents The Spanish-American War - First Intervention
1057997,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000NO240W,Jean E. Pouliot,"[16, 19]","I may be biased about this DVD, having seen the excellent PBS documentary ""Crucible of Empire: The Spanish American War"". This DVD, I thought, came up short in some ways, much of it having to do with the heavy use of actors and reenactors, the distracting attempts to recreate the look and feel of old film stock and the near-jingoistic view of the fighting. The film allowed actors to speak the words of the principals -- TR, William McKinley, Philino rebel Edwardo Aguyinaldo and others -- and interact with one another in set piece fashion.First Intervention covers the origins and subtleties of the conflist rather lightly, and spends (I think ) an inordinate amount of time on the Battle of San Juan Hill, which made an enduring name for Teddy Roosevelt. The battle -- a one-day affair in a 3-1/2 month war -- was a one-sided affair with 10,000 Americans battling 750 Spaniards. But the DVD spends quite a bit of time on it, making much of the courage of the Americans. The good news is that it seems to depict the battle accurately, with most of the Rough Riders advancing without their horses, in opposition to later illustrations. Another questinable aspect of the filk is its depictions of black American soldiers. I have no issue with depicting the involvement of these ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" who were among the few battle-tested portions of the American invasion force. But the chuminess they have with whites seems problematic. I rather doubt that blacks and whites -- given the racist overtones of the day -- sang and drank and smoked around campfires as shown here. And some of the reenactors looked mighty old and heavy to be playing young recruits, as the occasionally snippets of actual footage indicate.After watching both films, I would recommend ""Crucible of War"" for a more accurate and more fully rendered portrait of the war period. But ""First intervention,"" for all its restagings is valuable in depicting the contested ground on which the battles were fought. And its use of early war recreations (by Thomas Edison's company) was both instructive, comical and an unintended ironic parallel to the newer film's own troubles with reenacting warfare for a hometown audience. Take ""First Intervention"" with a grain of salt, don't believe everything you see, and obtain a window into an under-told and often mispresented period of US history.",3,Is relying on recreations a good thing?,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2359,"['may', 'be', 'biased', 'DVD', 'having', 'seen', 'excellent', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'Crucible', 'Empire', 'Spanish', 'American', 'War', 'DVD', 'thought', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'ways', 'much', 'having', 'do', 'heavy', 'use', 'actors', 'reenactors', 'distracting', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'look', 'feel', 'old', 'film', 'stock', 'near-jingoistic', 'view', 'fighting', 'film', 'allowed', 'actors', 'speak', 'words', 'principals', 'TR', 'William', 'McKinley', 'Philino', 'rebel', 'Edwardo', 'Aguyinaldo', 'others', 'interact', 'one', 'set', 'piece', 'fashion.First', 'Intervention', 'origins', 'subtleties', 'conflist', 'rather', 'lightly', 'spends', 'think', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'Battle', 'San', 'Juan', 'Hill', 'made', 'enduring', 'name', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'battle', 'one-day', 'affair', '3-1/2', 'month', 'war', 'was', 'one-sided', 'affair', '10,000', 'Americans', 'battling', '750', 'Spaniards', 'DVD', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'making', 'much', 'courage', 'Americans', 'good', 'news', 'depict', 'battle', 'accurately', 'most', 'Rough', 'Riders', 'advancing', 'horses', 'opposition', 'later', 'illustrations', 'questinable', 'aspect', 'filk', 'depictions', 'black', 'American', 'soldiers', 'have', 'issue', 'depicting', 'involvement', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'few', 'battle-tested', 'portions', 'American', 'invasion', 'force', 'chuminess', 'have', 'whites', 'problematic', 'rather', 'doubt', 'blacks', 'whites', 'given', 'racist', 'overtones', 'day', 'sang', 'drank', 'smoked', 'around', 'shown', 'here', 'reenactors', 'looked', 'mighty', 'old', 'heavy', 'be', 'playing', 'young', 'recruits', 'occasionally', 'snippets', 'actual', 'footage', 'indicate.After', 'watching', 'films', 'would', 'recommend', 'Crucible', 'War', 'more', 'accurate', 'more', 'fully', 'rendered', 'portrait', 'war', 'period', 'First', 'intervention', 'restagings', 'valuable', 'depicting', 'contested', 'ground', 'battles', 'were', 'fought', 'use', 'early', 'war', 'recreations', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'company', 'was', 'instructive', 'comical', 'unintended', 'ironic', 'parallel', 'newer', 'film', 'own', 'troubles', 'reenacting', 'warfare', 'hometown', 'audience', 'Take', 'First', 'Intervention', 'grain', 'salt', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'everything', 'see', 'obtain', 'window', 'under-told', 'often', 'mispresented', 'period', 'US', 'history']",The History Channel Presents The Spanish-American War - First Intervention
