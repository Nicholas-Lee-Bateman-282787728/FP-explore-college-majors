Very superficial really and not how real life is or maybe it is for some people.  As a lesbian woman I feel they miss the point and accept ordinaryness when a miracle was within their reach.  Sad movie.,3,A maybe story,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,312,"['movie', 'had', 'hallmarks', 'make', 'great', 'somehow', 'think', 'story', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'Very', 'superficial', 'really', 'not', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'maybe', 'people', 'lesbian', 'woman', 'feel', 'miss', 'point', 'accept', 'ordinaryness', 'when', 'miracle', 'was', 'reach', 'Sad', 'movie']",Round Trip

Then she meets Mushidi who moves in with Nurit and her two children as a nanny.  Nurit and Mushidi become lovers and, finally, Nurit smiles.  She is obviously happy with Mushidi.  But then, her estranged husband finds out about the two women and threatens to take the children from Nurit.  Nurit can't give up her children so she gives up Mushidi.
