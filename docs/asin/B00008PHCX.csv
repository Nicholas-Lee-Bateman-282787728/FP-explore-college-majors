A great way to jog the memories of baby boomers!I just wish they would sell individual DVD's of the show or at least do a ""Best of"" DVD with some of the better shows, like they did for ""The Best of Thunderbirds"".

746433,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00008PHCX,Chrijeff,"[1, 2]","I have fond memories of this series from when I was about nine or ten (viewing it again I realize that I probably actually saw no more than eight or ten of the segments), and I was surprised and delighted to see it available on DVD.  In an isolated laboratory in the desert at Blackrock, NV, an easy drive from Batesville and a couple of hours' bus time from Carson City, a three-man team has labored for five years to produce the vehicle of the future.  The men are the craggy, bedroom-eyed American test pilot, Mike Mercury; jolly, bespectacled German, Prof. Adolf Popkiss; and the brilliant but terminally absentminded Britisher, Dr. Horatio Beeker, whose eccentricities often land him (and sometimes the rest of the team as well) in trouble.  The vehicle, Supercar, is, as Mike says, ""like an airplane, only better"": she can fly from Nevada to New York City in 15 min. (not only super- but hypersonic), or loaf along at 1000 MPH (""low safe cruising speed"")--2500 MPH at an altitude of 50,000' provides best fuel economy; she can operate at 4 1/2 miles below the surface of the sea, or in low earth orbit (100-1240 mi. up); she's even been known to travel the British motorways, though her altimeter keeps insisting she's going to crash if Mike doesn't put another 150 feet under her belly plates, and her armor is so stout that she shrugs off bullets without so much as a dent.  On her first mission following the completion of testing, she rescues Bill Gibson, his 10-year-old brother Jimmy, and Jimmy's beloved pet monkey Mitch (much more intelligent than the average monkey, but equally mischievous) after their light plane ditches in the Pacific and their life raft goes astray in a heavy fog, and for reasons never fully explained Jimmy and Mitch are invited to stay at the lab with the team while Bill goes on to operate his small indy trucking business and later enter the astronaut corps.  Thereafter Supercar and her team assist people in trouble (from a Chinese oldster threatened with the destruction of the temple he cares for, to a deposed political leader) and tackle criminals, spies, and assorted other baddies, most notably the fat and sinister Masterspy and his cowardly cohort Zahrin (who, though they're Russian, are eventually revealed as freelancers, stealing secrets and devices to sell to the highest bidder, and occasionally doing a job for hire, as in ""Hi Jack"") and the British white-collar criminal Harper and his Cockney muscleman Judd.  The team is also very much aware of being a team, and willingly goes the extra mile for one another: once when Mitch becomes ill, Mike flies Dr. Beeker to the Amazon jungle in search of a plant that may cure him; when Prof. Popkiss has an appendectomy and needs a transfusion of blood from a rare group, Mike takes his doctor to an isolated research station in the Arctic to obtain plasma from a fellow scientist.As other reviewers have observed, the strings of Supercar and the puppets all too often show (apparently invisible thread hadn't been invented yet), body proportions aren't always right, there are various cartoonish explosions that leave people smoke-stained and dishevelled but uninjured, and the lab and control consoles are implausibly simple, but for what it is, the special effects are surprisingly good (especially when Supercar's jets fire), and there's a good deal of creative use of stock footage--artillery against the horizon, African wildlife in its native habitat, a Naval ship at sea, a nuclear blast.  There are also some implausibilities of plot, notably in ""Island Incident"" (how did the deposed General get from his island nation to the California desert, and once there, in those days before cell phones, how was he able to contact the Supercar team for help?) and in the fate of the recurring bad guys (why, once the team has them in its power, don't they end up securely in prison?).  The violence quotient, however, is very low (though there's occasional shooting, particularly in one segment where the team is besieged at the lab by Masterspy and cohorts and Dr. Beeker shows himself to be a determined marksman with a machine gun, nobody is ever killed), and there's a lot of humor, some of it rather subtle, some more kid-friendly (as when Mike, testing his new pilot-ejector seat, twice ends up atop a cactus).  As an adult I can still enjoy and appreciate this series and wish it could have lasted longer.  (Believe it or not, somebody online is working on a full-video continuation!)  Kids, even today's sophisticates, should like it too, especially with Jimmy as a focus for their own fantasies (as he once says, ""I bet lots of kids would love to be where I am"").",4,"The marvel of

While his later series became very sophisticated and the marionettes act less and less like puppets, in ""Supercar"" you have puppets acting and looking like puppets. Sometimes the eyes are simply painted on the heads of the puppets so that they never move. The anatomical proportions are way off so that you have large, goofy looking heads on slim, small bodies. The arms tend to wave wildly about when speaking. I like all of this: The Nelson Eddy like vocal singing/shouting the opening theme song, ""Supercar!!!"", the very visible strings pulling supercar up out of the water, the back screen projection of clouds and water (which actually works out well here), the ""not quite right"" miniature furniture (later series would scale down perfectly with obsessive attention to detail), the very simple and absurdly low budget lab equipment (although the Supercar model still looks great today).

Then, weeks or months later, I stumbled upon the same characters -- and Supercar -- on television, and it was the start of a very long love affair. This was of course Anderson's first marionette series, and the awful technical shortcomings are all too obvious now -- for some strange reason, my family's television in the early 1960s was unable to pick them up -- but as at least one other reviewer as noted, those flaws help make the show so endearing, particularly in retrospect for those of us who watched it the first time around.

Supercar is also a look back at a particular time in history: the jet age was just getting into full swing, the space age was taking its first baby steps, and we were poking into the last untouched corners of the planet. (Anyone remember the IGY?)  Several of the stories seem downright prophetic - a medical mercy mission flight to retrieve a researcher at the Pole in the middle of the arctic winter; an un-named small country trying to smuggle atomic bombs into the United States; a tinpot dictator sponsoring the highjacking of an airliner... That it's all in black and white just contributes to the overall charm of the show.Great fun!",5,Flight of Fantasy,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,1333,"['just', 'watched', 'way', 'entire', 'set', 'had', 'wonderful', 'time', 'lot', 'retro', 'fun', 'looking', 'back', 'future', 'product', 'age', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'later', 'work', 'Thunderbirds', 'where', 'came', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'exciting', 'looking', 'vehicles', 'straight', 'forward', 'adventure', 'stories', 'heroic', 'action', 'lot', 'gentle', 'humor', 'go', 'anywhere', 'do', 'anything', 'vehicle', 'Supercar', 'great', 'plot', 'device', 'supported', 'great', 'cast', 'even', 'are', 'marionettes', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'image', 'quality', 'Considering', 'budget', 'technology', 'limitations', 'time', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'amazing', 'Supercar', 'also', 'look', 'back', 'particular', 'time', 'history', 'jet', 'age', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'full', 'swing', 'space', 'age', 'was', 'taking', 'first', 'baby', 'steps', 'were', 'poking', 'last', 'untouched', 'corners', 'planet', 'Anyone', 'remember', 'IGY', 'Several', 'stories', 'seem', 'downright', 'prophetic', 'medical', 'mercy', 'mission', 'flight', 'retrieve', 'researcher', 'Pole', 'middle', 'arctic', 'winter', 'un-named', 'small', 'country', 'trying', 'smuggle', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'United', 'States', 'tinpot', 'dictator', 'sponsoring', 'highjacking', 'airliner', 'black', 'white', 'just', 'contributes', 'overall', 'charm', 'show.Great', 'fun']",Supercar - The Complete Series

I remember being thrilled by the adventures of Mike and the rest of the crewn and intrigued by the concept of the Supercar.

I even remember plotlines and specific scenes. This is really a great collection, and the quality is outstanding.

Casey ""Mark Goodwin""","[17, 17]","I watched this television series as a child of the fifties and was totally mesmerised by all of it's cinematic wonders, which were obviously limited at the time.  I was greatly pleased to see that this was to be released to DVD last month.  Sometimes you wonder if past TV shows and movies have stood the test of time, SUPERCAR has most definitely.  It is as real today as it was back then when I was a gullible child of eight.  And...with the onset of DVD, the quality is even better now, with every episode intact and order of presentation.

746451,A2ITPZOXVR7X6T,B00008PHCX,Vinny,"[4, 4]","When I was a seven years old back in the mid sixties this was my favorite show.  For years I was looking for it on VHS to no avail.  One night a cable access show played an episode and it brought me back to that time in my childhood.  That was the first time in about fort-five years that I saw an episode.  A couple of years ago I saw the box set DVD on Amazon for about $85.  Not sure if I would still like the show for that price I decided to wait to see if the price would drop.  Well it did an I just finished watching all 39 episodes for the first time in over forty-five years.  The video quality is very good, but sometimes the volume drops for Jimmy and for several ""guest characters"".  This is only a problem when watching late at night when I keep the volume down so I don't bother my neighbors.  This is probably due to the fact that the show is old and might not have been preserved properly.  If you remember this show and liked it then I highly recommend getting this set of the original Supermarionation.  I believe this was the first show of it's kind followed by other shows by Gerry Anderson and company like Thunderbirds and Stingray.  Yes you can see the strings but that's fine with me.  Yes it is in black and white but that's Ok also.  This was a time when there was no doubt who the good guys were.  I love the fact that you never see any one getting into Supercar, they are standing next to it then they cut back and they are in Supercar.  They can stand by a doorway but can't go through it because of the strings.  The plot lines are simple, Supercar is needed to save someone so off they go.  Today plot lines in TV shows aren't much more complicated.  Mike Mercury is the American, Dr. Beaker is ""most excellent"" as the English scientist and is my favorite.  Mitch the monkey can be a little annoying due to his screeching.  Prof. Popkiss is the other scientist with a German accent.  Jimmy is a kid they saved in the pilot episode who stayed with the Supercar team.  They made this show on a shoestring budget and you can see the love and sweat that went into it.  The other shows that followed are in color but this was the one that caught my imagination.  I enjoyed watching these shows and was happy to see them for the first time in forty-five years.
