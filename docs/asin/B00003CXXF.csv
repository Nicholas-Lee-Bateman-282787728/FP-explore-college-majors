538914,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00003CXXF,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[12, 13]","I am always suspicious whenever a best-selling book is used as the vehicle for a big-budget movie, as too often they are poorly interpreted sand transformed from print to film. For example, although many directors have tried, no one has ever successfully transformed one of Ernest Hemingway's novels to the screen. The attempt to bring ""Even Cowgirls Get The Blues"" to moviegoers was an unmitigated disaster, as was ""Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me"". Yet, perhaps because the siren call of the successful novel is so alluring, directors keep on trying. Here again they try to bring a masterful and long novel of over 400 pages to the screen.It some respects, this is a very successful adaptation. The depiction of both the romance and the dilemma the young officer faces is well depicted, and the director manages to recreate the quaint and provincial atmosphere of an Greek village masterfully, and one finds himself transported to this magical time and place through the magic of film. Yet in accomplishing this aspect of the story so well, the director gives short shrift to the rest of the story, so that the later parts of the novel get only brief and truncated treatments, undercutting the magic of the tale and seriously flawing the movie version of the story in the process.The cinematography, however, is spectacular, and the location on the island of Kefallonia is perfect suited to the tale, as are the local extras used, who add enormously to the genuine feel to the film's atmosphere and ambiance. Nicholas Cage shows his range both as a leading man and as a heroic leader and carries out both aspects to the role quite well. Penelope Cruz is a young woman who is so beautiful she doesn't have to do much to be believable, at least to male viewers of a certain age and disposition. Enuf said?  All in all, this is a very satisfying film, although I must admit to being disappointed to see the director skip so many subtle aspects of the latter parts of the story based on what appears to be time constraints. Still, this is very well done, and it is something I can highly recommend.

538918,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00003CXXF,Bobby Underwood,"[27, 29]","Those who could not see the beauty in this wonderful film were only using their eyes, and not their heart. Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a visually gorgeous and emotionally rich story of the beautiful Greek island of Cephallonia and its people during WWII. It is a slowly developing story of love and tradition amidst the awkwardness of war. We get a hint from the very beginning what this film is about as we hear the voice-over of the island's doctor, John Hurt: ""Ask not why we are wounded, but if the wound can be healed.""Hurt gives a wonderful performance as the island's doctor and the wise father of Pelagia (Penelope Cruz), who he is training to be a doctor as well. Cruz's fawn-like beauty only serve to enhance a fine and subtle performance of inner emotional turmoil. Pelagia is engaged to Mandras (Christian Bale) and their betrothal scene is one of the many traditions Madden lets us see as he slowly gives us a feel for the people of Cephallonia and their storied history.But war looms on the horizon and though the Greeks initially beat back the Italians in Albania they are overtaken when German reinforcements arrive. War finally comes to the island in the form of life-loving and peaceful Captain Antonio Corelli. Corelli and his men are Italians by birth and soldiers only by necessity. He and his troop sing opera and share a lust for life. When he comes to stay in Pelagia's home in exchange for medical supplies to her father, love begins to unfold in a very quiet and careful manner.Her betrothal to Mandras and the unwanted occupation of the Italians are stumbling blocks to their romance, however. Small and subtle moments like Pelagia's sitting back down to listen to Corelli play the mandolin, and her picking up a picture in his room and smiling tell us what is developing. After love fully blooms, forming a triangle, Hurt has a touching moment with his daughter, trying to explain to her what love really is. At the same time, the wise doctor has come to see in Corelli something he does not in Mandras, and relates the story of his courtship with Pelagia's mother. He was forced to leave the island in order to keep from being killed by her fiance.Things become more complicated when the Italians surrender to the allies and the Germans are on their way to the island. Corelli comes to learn that the Germans will treat he and his men just as the enemy and must make a decision that will change all their lives. A promise made to Pelagia by one of Corelli's men saves him, but in order to save Pelagia he must leave Cephallonia in a scene that is quiet and moving, like the entire film.When things return to normal on the island after the war, Pelagia becomes a doctor. But her wise father can see her pain and writes a letter to Corelli, in hopes that it will find him. Once again those words echo in our hearts: ""Ask not why we are wounded, but if the wound can be healed.""This is a quiet and beautiful film, very much with an old Hollywood type feel to it. Though visually beautiful, this is food for the heart and not just the eyes. Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz are marvelous, as are John Hurt and all the other inhabitants of this magical place in time. We are so involved in this story that by the time Cage enters the picture we hardly notice his in and out Italian accent.This is a film to lose yourself in and one that you will never forget if you view it not only with your eyes, but your heart as well.

538919,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00003CXXF,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","The film, based on the novel ""Corelli's Mandolin"", is a somewhat mixed product with some very good features and some questionable features also.Some of the strengths of the film include the unique perspective of the film, an invading Italian army in Greece at the beginning of World War II. The dialogue and contentions between Italian and Greek concerns was interesting. The film highlights the actions of both Italy and Greece in the early days of World War II.Several of the actors were superb, including Penelope Cruz, John Hurt (her country physician father), and Irene Pappas (the mother of Penelope's betrothal, Mandras). Irene Pappas is probably the most believable and capable actor in the entire film.The Greek island and countryside was beautiful. Seeing Penelope Cruz and Christian Bale swimming in the crystal clear Greek waters was especially inviting. The music was extra special, including many works of Italian opera. All of these features listed above kept the film afloat.However there were also weaknesses. These included the acting of both Nicholas Cage in the role of Captain Corelli and of Christian Bale in the role of Penelope Cruz's fianc&eacute;, Mandras. Both of these men are outstanding actors as evidenced by all their many fine films. Both of the characters they portray go through painful experiences that change them forever. So, what went wrong? I think the odd and fake sounding Italian accent Cage was asked to assume, and the fake sounding Greek accent that Bale was asked to assume gave the film an unreal comic sense that the director surely did not mean to occur. A second weakness of the film was the stereotypical screenplay which stereotyped Italians, Greeks, and Germans. Greek villagers had cute fights. Italian soldiers engaged in slapstick humor a bit too often. Germans were double-dealing to the extreme, even with their ally - the Italians. The third weakness was the battle scenes once the Germans invaded the island that was previously held by the Italians. The screen writing and film editing was a bit sophomoric, leaving the viewer with the concept that the chaos they were watching on the screen was not purposeful and was a result of faulty script and editing.Yet, despite the flaws, I would still recommend this entertaining film. Corelli and his men have a love for life which is often associated with the Italian national character. They do convey this throughout the film. The Greek characters balance life's tragedies and joys. We see people change in this film. We see a young woman in love with her childhood boyfriend lose that love gradually and fall in love with a man who stimulates her at many levels. We see her boyfriend, a handsome self-absorbed robust young man, undergo tragedy and take on a larger purpose in his life. Finally we see a sensual and well emotionally balanced Italian man experience great loss and pain and eventually emerge from that pain so that he can once again claim life. It is these aspects that redeem the film.",3,Re-claiming the joy in life,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,3009,"['film', 'based', 'novel', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'product', 'very', 'good', 'features', 'questionable', 'features', 'strengths', 'film', 'include', 'unique', 'perspective', 'film', 'invading', 'Italian', 'army', 'Greece', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'dialogue', 'contentions', 'Italian', 'Greek', 'concerns', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'actions', 'Italy', 'Greece', 'early', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.Several', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'including', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'John', 'Hurt', 'country', 'physician', 'father', 'Irene', 'Pappas', 'mother', 'Penelope', 'betrothal', 'Mandras', 'Irene', 'Pappas', 'probably', 'most', 'believable', 'capable', 'actor', 'entire', 'film.The', 'Greek', 'island', 'countryside', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Seeing', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'swimming', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Greek', 'waters', 'was', 'especially', 'inviting', 'music', 'was', 'extra', 'special', 'including', 'many', 'works', 'Italian', 'opera', 'features', 'listed', 'kept', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'included', 'acting', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'role', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'role', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Mandras', 'men', 'are', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'evidenced', 'many', 'fine', 'films', 'characters', 'portray', 'go', 'painful', 'experiences', 'change', 'forever', 'So', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'think', 'odd', 'fake', 'sounding', 'Italian', 'accent', 'Cage', 'was', 'asked', 'assume', 'fake', 'sounding', 'Greek', 'accent', 'Bale', 'was', 'asked', 'assume', 'gave', 'film', 'unreal', 'comic', 'sense', 'director', 'surely', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'occur', 'second', 'weakness', 'film', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'screenplay', 'stereotyped', 'Italians', 'Greeks', 'Germans', 'Greek', 'villagers', 'had', 'cute', 'fights', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'engaged', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'Germans', 'were', 'double-dealing', 'extreme', 'even', 'ally', 'Italians', 'third', 'weakness', 'was', 'battle', 'once', 'Germans', 'invaded', 'island', 'was', 'previously', 'held', 'Italians', 'screen', 'writing', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'bit', 'sophomoric', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'concept', 'chaos', 'were', 'watching', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'purposeful', 'was', 'result', 'faulty', 'script', 'editing.Yet', 'flaws', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Corelli', 'men', 'have', 'love', 'life', 'often', 'associated', 'Italian', 'national', 'character', 'do', 'convey', 'film', 'Greek', 'characters', 'balance', 'life', 'tragedies', 'joys', 'see', 'people', 'change', 'film', 'see', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'childhood', 'boyfriend', 'lose', 'love', 'gradually', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'many', 'levels', 'see', 'boyfriend', 'handsome', 'self-absorbed', 'robust', 'young', 'man', 'undergo', 'tragedy', 'take', 'larger', 'purpose', 'life', 'Finally', 'see', 'sensual', 'well', 'emotionally', 'balanced', 'Italian', 'man', 'experience', 'great', 'loss', 'pain', 'eventually', 'emerge', 'pain', 'so', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'claim', 'life', 'aspects', 'redeem', 'film']",N/A

This makes it a very unconventional war movie, just as HEAD IN THE CLOUDS is an unconventional war movie that explores a different angle of WWII.Cephallonia is a scenic Greek island in the Mediterranean.  Some have argued that it is one-in-the-same island as Ithica, which was Odysseous' home in Homer's epics.  It is an island with inhabitants who enjoy the simple wonders that life has to offer.Like the rest of the world, the island was dragged into the cruel reality of the 2nd world war, during which time it was occupied by both Italy and Nazi Germany.So far, the movie sounds like it is going to be all about Greek citizens having to cope with the harsh and bitter situation of having their beloved island occupied by foreign armies.  Well, yes, it does portray that, but there is an unexpected twist.After Italy surrenders there is a lot of confusion about their fate.  Instead of fighting the allied forces they find themselves having to face off against the Nazis, who don't want to see their arms end up in the hands of the allied coalition or the island's inhabitants.Such is the backdrop of this movie.  What happens from this point is historical fact, not fabricated Hollywood fiction.  John Madden, director of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, puts together another stellar movie that is well worth seeing.  Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz are noteworthy in their performances.This film is a must-see for fans of war movies, ""different"" war movies, World War II and European history.",5,An outpost of WWII,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,1557,"['story', 'movie', 'fiction', 'events', 'depicted', 'are', 'fact', 'very', 'unconventional', 'war', 'movie', 'just', 'HEAD', 'IN', 'THE', 'CLOUDS', 'unconventional', 'war', 'movie', 'different', 'angle', 'WWII.Cephallonia', 'scenic', 'Greek', 'island', 'Mediterranean', 'have', 'argued', 'one-in-the-same', 'island', 'Ithica', 'was', 'Odysseous', 'home', 'Homer', 'epics', 'island', 'inhabitants', 'who', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'wonders', 'life', 'offer.Like', 'rest', 'world', 'island', 'was', 'dragged', 'cruel', 'reality', '2nd', 'world', 'war', 'time', 'was', 'occupied', 'Italy', 'Nazi', 'Germany.So', 'far', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'Greek', 'citizens', 'having', 'cope', 'harsh', 'bitter', 'situation', 'having', 'beloved', 'island', 'occupied', 'foreign', 'armies', 'Well', 'yes', 'portray', 'unexpected', 'twist.After', 'Italy', 'surrenders', 'lot', 'confusion', 'fate', 'Instead', 'fighting', 'allied', 'forces', 'find', 'having', 'face', 'off', 'Nazis', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'arms', 'end', 'up', 'hands', 'allied', 'coalition', 'island', 'inhabitants.Such', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'What', 'point', 'historical', 'fact', 'not', 'fabricated', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'John', 'Madden', 'director', 'SHAKESPEARE', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'together', 'stellar', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Cage', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'performances.This', 'film', 'must-see', 'fans', 'war', 'movies', 'different', 'war', 'movies', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'European', 'history']",N/A
538921,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00003CXXF,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[6, 10]","...Nicholas Cage, who is one of my favorite actors but who was OUTRAGEOUSLY MISCAST in this film!!!  Cage excels in paying angry, wacky, unhinged, and/or offbeat characters---NOT the dashing and gallant Italian army officer in this film! I couldn't help guffawing through much of the movie as he was trying his best to dish out long lingering cow-eyes at his leading lady, or speaking oh so PASSIONATELY in the fake Italian accent.Luckily Penelope Cruz provides lots of soothing and distracting eye candy, as does the stunning natural landscape of the Greek island the film was shot at, otherwise I would've been out the door within the first 15 minutes.  John Hurt also puts in a decent performance as her father, the venerable and oh-so-wise village doctor.The main problem with this movie is that despite the authentic location and beautifully made sets (the village was totally constructed for the film), it just all feels very FAKE---from Cage's horrific miscasting to the fake Italian-accented English he and all the non-Italian, non-Greek cast members speak throughout.  The Italians, Germans, and Greeks are all portrayed in the simplest and well-worn stereotypes.  The story is also unevenly paced and the plot, while it does have a few somewhat unexpected twists towards the end, is mostly predictable.The brief war scenes are also disappointing, their lack of physical authenticity reminded me of some 1970s war movies, long before the advent of ""Platoon"" and especially ""Saving Private Ryan.""It's really a shame, because I'm sure that in the hands of a talented Italian director like Giuseppe Tornatore (""Cinema Paradiso"") and with an all-European cast speaking their native languages and us reading subtitles, this film could've easily been 200% better!Really about the best thing in this film is the fleeting glimpse not only of Penelope's lovely uppper torso but more deliciously, of her coal-black but neatly-trimmed armpit hair during the one very PG-13 (read: tame, vanilla stuff) love scene.  This is about the single most physically appealing and authentic moment in the whole 2 hours, I'm afraid.I'm afraid what the Germans couldn't do to this little Greek island (the film is supposedly based on a true story), Hollywood accomplished fairly quickly: blow all into little pieces, on the way to the bank.",3,Barely survives...,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2324,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'who', 'was', 'OUTRAGEOUSLY', 'MISCAST', 'film', 'Cage', 'excels', 'paying', 'angry', 'wacky', 'unhinged', 'and/or', 'offbeat', 'characters', '-NOT', 'dashing', 'gallant', 'Italian', 'army', 'officer', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'guffawing', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'best', 'dish', 'out', 'long', 'lingering', 'cow-eyes', 'leading', 'lady', 'speaking', 'oh', 'so', 'PASSIONATELY', 'fake', 'Italian', 'accent.Luckily', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'lots', 'soothing', 'distracting', 'eye', 'candy', 'stunning', 'natural', 'landscape', 'Greek', 'island', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'otherwise', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'out', 'door', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'John', 'Hurt', 'also', 'decent', 'performance', 'father', 'venerable', 'oh-so-wise', 'village', 'doctor.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'authentic', 'location', 'beautifully', 'made', 'sets', 'village', 'was', 'totally', 'constructed', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'very', 'FAKE', '-from', 'Cage', 'horrific', 'miscasting', 'fake', 'Italian-accented', 'English', 'non-Italian', 'non-Greek', 'cast', 'members', 'speak', 'Italians', 'Germans', 'Greeks', 'are', 'portrayed', 'simplest', 'well-worn', 'stereotypes', 'story', 'also', 'unevenly', 'paced', 'plot', 'have', 'few', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'end', 'mostly', 'predictable.The', 'brief', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'disappointing', 'lack', 'physical', 'authenticity', 'reminded', '1970s', 'war', 'movies', 'long', 'advent', 'Platoon', 'especially', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'really', 'shame', ""'m"", 'sure', 'hands', 'talented', 'Italian', 'director', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'all-European', 'cast', 'speaking', 'native', 'languages', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', '200', '%', 'better', 'Really', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'not', 'only', 'Penelope', 'lovely', 'uppper', 'torso', 'more', 'deliciously', 'coal-black', 'neatly-trimmed', 'armpit', 'hair', 'one', 'very', 'PG-13', 'read', 'tame', 'vanilla', 'stuff', 'love', 'scene', 'single', 'most', 'physically', 'appealing', 'authentic', 'moment', 'whole', '2', 'hours', ""'m"", 'afraid.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'what', 'Germans', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'little', 'Greek', 'island', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'accomplished', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'blow', 'little', 'pieces', 'way', 'bank']",N/A

According to him it was not historically accurate.  According to me, it is a lavishly beautiful film to look at, but the storyline is weak, the script is about as good as a harlequin romance, and Cage's acting is horrendous.  How often does an american actor actually get any foreign accent right?  Pretty much never.Penelope Cruz is Pelagia, a woman who dresses like a nurse cuz she wants to be a doctor.  She is a decent actress, Cage makes her look even better in their scenes together as I think this was just a bad choice for him as an acting role.  I usually like him, but lately he's done no movies I find him appealing in lately.  As the other reviewers are saying here, the characters are never developed so you don't really know enough to care what happens to them.  I do think that Christian Bale's character, Mandras, is the only character that comes close to any development.  You think he's bad for awhile, but he actually does end up being good..all for love of course.It wasn't a totally terrible movie, but it wasn't great.  I thought the script was just too corny and I couldn't believe the words coming out of John Hurt's character. He plays Pelagia's father.  It's like Danielle Steel wrote this.  He was very good in this movie as he is in everything I've seen him in.This is also very predictable.  If you LOVED Titanic or Pearl Harbor, chances are you will appreciate this film more than me.I just have to really be in love with the script in a film to appreciate it and this script is drivel.

However, I read the book first (which I absolutely adored) so the story was set in my mind.  The movie cut so many scenes that I thought were completely necessary to the plot, and added silly Hollywood scenes in their place.  The film relegated major characters in the book (like Carlo Guerccio) to one or two lines in the film.  In my opinion, this was a big mistake by the screen writers.Cage and Cruz played their respective parts well in this film.  Cage was funny and quirky like Corelli's character is described in the book, and Cruz honed in on Pelagia's quiet, reserved nature.  Christian Bale looked surprisingly Greek in the movie, playing Pelagia's fianc&eacute;, Mandras. Although his character in the novel was the complete opposite in the filml, he played the part well.  Dr. Iannis was intelligent, kind, and loving, and his character in the film translated the same way.In conclusion, the movie is good and beautiful, but it pales in the light of the novel.

538924,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00003CXXF,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 4]","This film belongs next to ""Casablanca"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The English Patient"" and a few other films which depict war and the struggle for human survival along with some tension between a man and woman that eventually leads to a passionate love affair. In most great films which include romance, the question arises if it can stand the test of time and become the one which will be forever remembered as the greatest love affair in their lives. When looking back from the future, will it be viewed as the greatest one despite the difficulties? Nicholas Cage plays the leading man, Captain Corelli and Penelope Cruz is portrayed as Pellagia, his love interest. Each is superbly cast. Each brings a realistic style and emotional depth to their respective roles. Each interprets the developing relationship and events with honesty and total openness ...What makes this film particularly unique is the setting of Cephalonia. It is a picture perfect, beautiful lush green island, home to a hearty group of Greeks who had faced many enemies over the centuries and survived, defending their mountain homes ... Another outstanding feature to this film is how it includes both the Italians and Germans who place a foothold on the island, as they prepare to fight the Allies. The Italian troop arrives first, a robust, hearty handsome group of young men, who are classically trained singers and musicians. They often engage in music during their off-time. Some of the officers are housed with the locals which is how Captain Corelli first met Pellagia, the daughter of the local doctor ... By living in the doctor's house, the relationship is mutually beneficial since the doctor can get much needed medical supplies. Capt. Corelli first saw Pellagia in the crowd during their arrival to the island, she watched from the roadside crowd. Pellagia stood out and caught his attention with her independence and beauty ...Prior to the Italians arriving, Pellagia had just become engaged to Mandros, her Greek boyfriend, who was semi-illiterate and a farmer. He volunteered to fight the Germans in northern Greece, he wanted to face the enemy and defend his homeland. Pellagia had no replies to her nearly one hundred letters written to him in which she poured out her love and devotion. He survived but was a changed man, he now had a purpose, to create an underground organization which worked with the Allies. Mandros suspected Captain Corelli had feelings for his fiance; also, Mandros noticed Pellagia was uncertain how to express her conflicting feelings, she was wrestling with deeply hidden thoughts ...The Germans arrived on Cephalonia and a new type of order and discipline was instituted. However, occasionally social gatherings with the locals was allowed where the populace mixed with their occupiers. At such a festivity, Pellagia danced an astonishing tango with an Italian friend of Corelli's, creating a sensation on the dance floor. It captured everyone's attention except it seems the one whose affections she was trying to reach: Capt. Corelli. Captain Corelli had been assigned to live in their home and when he noticed how uncomfortable it made Pellagia, he volunteered to leave. They had several heated exchanges ... Her father recognized a budding love affair, and encouraged Capt. Corelli to pursue his daughter ... When Captain Corelli played his mandolin and expressed his heartfelt emotions through his instrument, he won Pellagia's heart.Unfortunately, the tides of war had turned, the Italians had surrendered to the Allies and the German occupiers had a major problem on their hands. They received orders to massacre the Italians, although they let them pack and led them to believe they were returning to their homes ... Through an unusual set of circumstances, Capt. Corelli was allowed to live, although he is nearly at death's door. He is nursed back to health by the Greek doctor, while the island rebuilds itself and attempts to return to normalcy after the war is declared over. Capt. Corelli is provided safe passage back to Italy ... Pellagia pursues her studies and becomes a local doctor on the island. Until ... she receives a mysterious package from Italy, which contains a recording of mandolin music, the melody of one which she knows and recognizes. To the satisfaction of most viewers, several years after the war, Capt. Corelli does indeed return to Cephalonia and meets again with Pellagia ...

Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid.  Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fianc&eacute;.I rated this film an 8/10.  Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.

The music is unmemorable, much of the acting (e.g. John Hurt) is uncommitted, and even the cinematography seems unambitious in its scale.  I found myself caring nothing for the two lead characters, but perhaps I resented an American being cast as an Italian and a Hispanic cast as a Greek.  This is an enormous, wasted opportunity -- no wonder author Louis de Bernieres refused to have anything to do with the movie once he realised what the production team intended.  On the plus side, I cannot fault Cage for the effort put into his mandolin-playing and Cruz for the effort she put into her acting.

This particular story, which comes from a book, has been told magnificiently; all the WW2 details are accurate, including Corelli's Italian accent, which I found realistic, as I'm Northern Italian myself.The Italian soldiers stationed in the island to occupy it, sure love life, great music, good food and women, it cannot be denied, but they also manage to interact with the Greeks and become friends with them, thanks to the Italians' positive, outgoing and giving attitude.I feel compelled to stop telling more about the story itself, as I'm trying not to spoil the show to the future watchers, but I can draw a few bottom lines: the Italians hated the Nazis, their political agenda, their ruthlessness, and they proved it, as they gave their lives to protect the (wasn't even THEIR country, which makes their effort all the more honorable and valid) island from them, and another important part of the story is LOVE NEVER DIES.Also important, I believe this one is Nicholas Cage's finest performance, although all the other actors do a fine job as well.I also found the great love story told in the movie to be quite realistic and credible, and those of you who believe in the power of true love, will not be able to hold their tears throughout the movie and at the end, as I keep doing every time I watch this movie.",5,A true story and a masterpiece!,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,1871,"['What', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'been', 'already', 'said', 'reviews', 'Well', 'could', 'start', 'mentioning', 'been', 'need', 'someone', 'finally', 'telling', 'publicly', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'went', 'WW2', 'Italian', 'version', 'true', 'one', 'instead', 'American', 'extent', 'British', 'typical', '-factually', 'inaccurate-', 'propaganda', 'just', 'dismissed', 'Italians', 'coward', 'army', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'fight', 'freedom.Well', 'movie', 'real', 'story', 'happened', 'Kephalonia', 'hope', 'spelled', 'right', ""'m"", 'not', 'Greek', 'particular', 'story', 'book', 'been', 'told', 'magnificiently', 'WW2', 'details', 'are', 'accurate', 'including', 'Corelli', 'Italian', 'accent', 'found', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'Northern', 'Italian', 'myself.The', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'stationed', 'island', 'occupy', 'sure', 'love', 'life', 'great', 'music', 'good', 'food', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'also', 'manage', 'interact', 'Greeks', 'become', 'friends', 'thanks', 'Italians', 'positive', 'outgoing', 'giving', 'attitude.I', 'feel', 'compelled', 'stop', 'telling', 'more', 'story', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'spoil', 'show', 'future', 'watchers', 'can', 'draw', 'few', 'bottom', 'lines', 'Italians', 'hated', 'Nazis', 'political', 'agenda', 'ruthlessness', 'proved', 'gave', 'lives', 'protect', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'THEIR', 'country', 'effort', 'more', 'honorable', 'valid', 'island', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'LOVE', 'NEVER', 'DIES.Also', 'important', 'believe', 'one', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'finest', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'well.I', 'also', 'found', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'realistic', 'credible', 'who', 'believe', 'power', 'true', 'love', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'tears', 'movie', 'end', 'keep', 'doing', 'time', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A
538929,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00003CXXF,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[4, 4]","Director John Madden has quite a track record. Films like MRS.BROWN, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE were triumphs; artistically fantastic transfers from a novel to the screen. I'm sure that he approached this film with the same enthusiasm. He probably loved the book, and it was a good one. This is a classic tale, full of romance, war, betrayal, seduction, ethnic music and dance. The locales he picked for the film certainly looked like the Greek Isles.Penelope Cruz radiates as Pelagia, the village doctor's daughter. She managed to be intelligent, sexy, earthy, and vulnerable all in the same breath. She loved her father, and she had studied medicine with him all her life. She could have been a nurse. She could have studied to be a doctor. She loved her betrothed, Mandras, a young muscular fisheman; played very convincingly by Christian Bale. But World War II intervened, and its dark shadow blot out the idyllic qualities of her dreams, and her lifestyle; stomping on them like a Nazi jackboot.John Hurt found the pulse of his role as Dr. Iannis. His portrayal was touching, funny, profound, and tragic; a tribute to his skill as an actor. His became the pivotal role in this story. The movie is worth seeing just to experience his talent.Christian Bale found the simplicity, strength, and patriotism to play Mandras. We believed in him ( though we secretly felt, as the doctor did, that his intellect was beneath Pelagia's, and that someday she would rue marrying him ), and we cheered him on when he ran off to become a resistance fighter. Irene Papas, always reliable, was wonderful as Drosoula, the mother of Mandras. She is, of course, as Greek as olive oil, and her mere presence gave credibility to the tale.And then, sadly, we come to the Achilles heel of the production, the flawed edifice known as Nicolas Cage. Mr. Cage, despite his academy award, is the kind of narrow-range actor whose talent has specific parameters. When cast appropriately, he can be extremely effective. Not so this time. Now he has been bad, or had weak moments in many of his movies, but he is flat terrible in this one. His attempts at an Italian accent were ludicrous. Cage, whose real name is Coppola, has the blood of the Mediterranean running through his veins, and he should be ashamed of himself. His accent was so bad, it sounded like a fledging thespian in their first high school play. Even so, his Antonio Corelli had its moments. The guy can be charming. But there was no real depth, no truth in his technique. Captain Corelli was made of cardboard.No matter how sumptious the rest of the production may be, and actually all of the supporting cast, the art design, the writing, and the musical score for this film were very good; when the point man, the lead singer is weak, the whole project sinks like a rowboat with a slit seam. The movie was appropriately critically slammed and panned. Even the trailer could not disguise its flaws. One can, if they really try, overlook the poor performance delivered by Cage, but unfortunately the heart of the film, the great romance, the love story between Corelli and Pelagia, was as listless and lifeless as flat stale beer; no sparks, no chemistry. And a body of work without a beating heart is just zombie art; a still birth.For lovers and readers of the book, this movie is a must-see. For most of us, though, it turned out to be lukewarm experience. But always remember, watching a film is a very personal journey into tens kinds of Art. So if you like Madden as a director, or Cage as an actor, then give this lovely, albeit flawed, film a viewing, and see what you think.",3,Nick....Get a Dialect Coach,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,3621,"['Director', 'John', 'Madden', 'quite', 'track', 'record', 'Films', 'MRS.BROWN', 'SHAKESPEARE', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'were', 'triumphs', 'artistically', 'fantastic', 'transfers', 'novel', 'screen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'approached', 'film', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'probably', 'loved', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'classic', 'tale', 'full', 'romance', 'war', 'betrayal', 'seduction', 'ethnic', 'music', 'dance', 'locales', 'picked', 'film', 'certainly', 'looked', 'Greek', 'Isles.Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Pelagia', 'village', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'managed', 'be', 'intelligent', 'sexy', 'earthy', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'breath', 'loved', 'father', 'had', 'studied', 'medicine', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nurse', 'could', 'have', 'studied', 'be', 'doctor', 'loved', 'betrothed', 'Mandras', 'young', 'muscular', 'fisheman', 'played', 'very', 'convincingly', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'intervened', 'dark', 'shadow', 'blot', 'idyllic', 'qualities', 'dreams', 'lifestyle', 'stomping', 'Nazi', 'jackboot.John', 'Hurt', 'found', 'pulse', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Iannis', 'portrayal', 'was', 'touching', 'funny', 'profound', 'tragic', 'tribute', 'skill', 'actor', 'became', 'pivotal', 'role', 'story', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'experience', 'talent.Christian', 'Bale', 'found', 'simplicity', 'strength', 'patriotism', 'play', 'Mandras', 'believed', 'secretly', 'felt', 'doctor', 'did', 'intellect', 'was', 'beneath', 'Pelagia', 'someday', 'would', 'rue', 'marrying', 'cheered', 'when', 'ran', 'off', 'become', 'resistance', 'fighter', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'always', 'reliable', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Drosoula', 'mother', 'Mandras', 'course', 'as', 'Greek', 'olive', 'oil', 'mere', 'presence', 'gave', 'credibility', 'tale.And', 'then', 'sadly', 'come', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'production', 'flawed', 'edifice', 'known', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'academy', 'award', 'kind', 'narrow-range', 'actor', 'talent', 'specific', 'parameters', 'When', 'cast', 'appropriately', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'effective', 'Not', 'time', 'Now', 'been', 'bad', 'had', 'weak', 'moments', 'many', 'movies', 'flat', 'terrible', 'one', 'attempts', 'Italian', 'accent', 'were', 'ludicrous', 'Cage', 'real', 'name', 'Coppola', 'blood', 'Mediterranean', 'running', 'veins', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'accent', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'sounded', 'fledging', 'thespian', 'first', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'Even', 'so', 'Antonio', 'Corelli', 'had', 'moments', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'was', 'real', 'depth', 'truth', 'technique', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'was', 'made', 'cardboard.No', 'matter', 'how', 'sumptious', 'rest', 'production', 'may', 'be', 'actually', 'supporting', 'cast', 'art', 'design', 'writing', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'point', 'man', 'lead', 'singer', 'weak', 'whole', 'project', 'sinks', 'rowboat', 'slit', 'seam', 'movie', 'was', 'appropriately', 'critically', 'slammed', 'panned', 'Even', 'trailer', 'could', 'not', 'disguise', 'flaws', 'One', 'can', 'really', 'try', 'overlook', 'poor', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Cage', 'unfortunately', 'heart', 'film', 'great', 'romance', 'love', 'story', 'Corelli', 'Pelagia', 'was', 'listless', 'lifeless', 'flat', 'stale', 'beer', 'sparks', 'chemistry', 'body', 'work', 'beating', 'heart', 'just', 'zombie', 'art', 'still', 'birth.For', 'lovers', 'readers', 'book', 'movie', 'must-see', 'most', 'though', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lukewarm', 'experience', 'always', 'remember', 'watching', 'film', 'very', 'personal', 'journey', 'tens', 'kinds', 'Art', 'So', 'like', 'Madden', 'director', 'Cage', 'actor', 'then', 'give', 'lovely', 'albeit', 'flawed', 'film', 'viewing', 'see', 'what', 'think']",N/A
538930,A7Y6AVS576M03,B00003CXXF,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is an exceptional film and I enjoyed it very much. The love story is there but there are numerous emotional vignettes concerning the effects of the war on all concerned from Greek, Italian and German military to the Greek civilian population. These impressionable glimpses into the human psyche burdened by loyalty and duty to one's homeland overshadow the love story. War brings out feelings and ambiguities of the conscience that can never be experienced in peacetime. That is really the strength of this film. I did not read the novel. Often comparisons of films made from novels can be a burden on the viewer providing that the viewer has read the novel prior to seeing the film. In some cases a film can actually improve on an idea that the novel did not exploit to its full potential. My reaction here is just to what I viewed in the film. As I watched this film I kept getting flashes of David Lean's RYAN'S DAUGHTER. It is similar in that a love story develops between a young Irish woman and a young British officer of the army occupying her homeland during the First World War. Both films also contain very many scenes on the beach and seashore. In RYAN'S DAUGHTER the primary focus was on the love story and not the war. I suppose I mention RYAN'S DAUGHTER because when I first realized that films were a passion with me and I wanted to really know why that was, RYAN'S DAUGHTER was the film I delved into looking for answers. Often you come away with more questions than answers. What makes a film good? Perhaps that is not a legitimate question. More importantly, what is there in a film that attracts it to you? What makes it work for you? I think that a film that evokes an emotional response from you is something to take note of and perhaps cherish at some point. These are some of the thoughts that kept surfacing as I watched CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN. I can't say that CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is a film rich in character development. However, I go back again to the several vignettes that capture little snippets of conversation or a facial expression or body movement that reveals the soul and its true feeling of displeasure and hurt by the injustices of war that buries the rational mind and loving heart. For that alone I find CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN a film very worthy of your attention. Not since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has a war film touched that part of me. CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but it does scrutinize and bring to the forefront another facet of the effects of that war and all wars. The DVD images are brilliantly and artistically realized making this a truly wonderful film.",5,Moving Parable on Love and War and the Land They Loved,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,2667,"['CAPTAIN', 'CORELLI', 'MANDOLIN', 'exceptional', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'there', 'are', 'numerous', 'emotional', 'vignettes', 'concerning', 'effects', 'war', 'concerned', 'Greek', 'Italian', 'German', 'military', 'Greek', 'civilian', 'population', 'impressionable', 'glimpses', 'human', 'psyche', 'burdened', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'one', 'homeland', 'love', 'story', 'War', 'out', 'feelings', 'ambiguities', 'conscience', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'experienced', 'peacetime', 'really', 'strength', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'Often', 'comparisons', 'films', 'made', 'novels', 'can', 'be', 'burden', 'viewer', 'providing', 'viewer', 'read', 'novel', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'cases', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'improve', 'idea', 'novel', 'did', 'not', 'exploit', 'full', 'potential', 'reaction', 'here', 'just', 'what', 'viewed', 'film', 'watched', 'film', 'kept', 'getting', 'flashes', 'David', 'Lean', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'similar', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'Irish', 'woman', 'young', 'British', 'officer', 'army', 'occupying', 'homeland', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'films', 'also', 'contain', 'very', 'many', 'scenes', 'beach', 'seashore', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'primary', 'focus', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'war', 'suppose', 'mention', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'when', 'first', 'realized', 'films', 'were', 'passion', 'wanted', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'was', 'film', 'delved', 'looking', 'answers', 'Often', 'come', 'away', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'What', 'film', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'legitimate', 'question', 'More', 'importantly', 'what', 'there', 'film', 'What', 'work', 'think', 'film', 'emotional', 'response', 'something', 'take', 'note', 'perhaps', 'cherish', 'point', 'are', 'thoughts', 'kept', 'surfacing', 'watched', 'CAPTAIN', 'CORELLI', 'MANDOLIN', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'CAPTAIN', 'CORELLI', 'MANDOLIN', 'film', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'go', 'back', 'again', 'several', 'vignettes', 'capture', 'little', 'snippets', 'conversation', 'facial', 'expression', 'body', 'movement', 'soul', 'true', 'feeling', 'displeasure', 'hurt', 'injustices', 'war', 'rational', 'mind', 'loving', 'heart', 'alone', 'find', 'CAPTAIN', 'CORELLI', 'MANDOLIN', 'film', 'very', 'worthy', 'attention', 'Not', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'war', 'film', 'touched', 'part', 'CAPTAIN', 'CORELLI', 'MANDOLIN', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'scrutinize', 'bring', 'forefront', 'facet', 'effects', 'war', 'wars', 'DVD', 'images', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'artistically', 'realized', 'making', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

He's cast as an Italian Captain whose army occupies a Greek Island in 1940.  This is an interesting setting because it's not often we see films dealing with the Mediterranean conflict during WW 2 and it again reminded me how many people and nations were touched by that war.  It's a beautiful island, and the cinematography inspires me travel to Greece some day.John Hurt is cast as the town's physician, whose beautiful daughter, Peneople Cruz wants to study to be a doctor herself.  She gets engaged to an illiterate fisherman, played by Christian Bale, even though her wise father thinks she is too good for him.  There's a war on though, and the fisherman goes to the front, the Italian army marches in, and Nicholas Cage is boarded with the doctor and his beautiful daughter.  He loves to sing and play the mandolin and even dedicates a song to the lovely young woman.  The results are inevitable. When the Italians surrender and the Germans take over, there's a lot of violence, and what at first seemed like a languid love story suddenly shows the reality of war.This film could have been really good, but got bogged down.  One of the problems was the use of language as the whole cast spoke English even though they made believe they were translating.  This made everything seem unrealistic and I couldn't get up too much emotion for the characters. Even though there was tension throughout, it all seemed a bit too light for the seriousness of the subject. And the love affairs were curiously passionless.

When he played a love swain Italian, I just couldn't get into it. He has played in too many action films and just doesn't fit that role to me. Cruz was very good in her part and she can really act a heartbroken maiden and really show deep love and emotion. I compared her to Sophia Loren, that I'm not sure of it just came to me in a flash. I think Loren is a tremendous actor so it is surely a compliment. The film's story seemed old, boy meets girl, she falls out of love with her first love and falls for the new guy. The setting was spectacular with the most beautiful blue water and green coastal mountains, like a heaven on earth. This is what really got my attention, as well as Cruz who is very pretty. The things that I liked was that it showed the tragedy that happened to the Italians when the Germans turned against them in Greece. This is history and not shown in many movies. I also liked the mandolin music and really appreciated that Nick Cage learned how to play this instrument. I also liked the dancing, it was neat to see Cruz dance. I had heard she was a dancer and you can tell by her posture she is. The movie had a scene where I think she did either the tango, marengue or who knows whatever dance it was, it was good. So those were the things that made it stand out, the theme was also good. When Nick Cage said that morality was what was really important in times of war and this was shown by Cruz's first lover finding Cage's character after being shot and bringing him back to life. Even in times of anger we need to still reach out to another who is suffering, at least for me.

This is the story of how World War II affected the inhabitants of the Greek island of Cephallonia in the Ionian Sea.  When the Italians occupy the island, Captain Antonio Corelli is billeted in the home of Dr. Iannis and his daughter Pelagia.  Pelagia is engaged to a local fisherman who has joined the partisans to fight the invaders.  The Italian occupation is benign and Captain Corelli steals his way into Pelagia's heart.  When Italy surrenders to the allies, the Italians and the Greeks are happy.  But the Germans arrive to take over the occupation.  The Italians are disarmed and massacred.  Corelli is severed wounded, but Dr. Iannis saves him.  The Greeks help him escape by boat at night.  The war comes to an end, and life on the island returns to normal.  But in 1953 a terrible earthquake levels most of the buildings on Cephallonia.  Pelagia, her father and their adopted daughter Lemoni survive.  On the next celebration of St. Gerasimus, held in the ruins of the local church, Corelli returns to be reunited with Pelagia.Nicolas Cage may have been miscast as Captain Corelli.  His Italian accent sometimes grates on the ear, and his happy-go-lucky attitude seems forced at times.  But the rest of the cast, Greek and non-Greek were wonderful.  The entire film was shot on Cephallonia, and it is a beautiful place.  The sets were all built, but they look perfect in their locations.  The music is good enough to stand on its own without the movie.  Yes, the director John Madden and the screenwriter Shawn Slovo made changes to the story.  It is impossible to be completely faithful to a book when you have only two hours to tell the story.  I have read the book, and I think that the movie captures the essence of the book quite well.  Penelope Cruz does not get the credit she deserves for her role.  She translated Pelagia's serious nature and her fierce temper onto the screen very well.

He comes from the Coppola family, so you'd expect it to be a little more believable (take the scene where he laughs at a comment that Cruz makes... too fake!) plus the accent itself seemed to come and go depending on how loud he talked: don't expect Cage to be winning an Oscar for his performance as Captain Corelli.Penelope played Pelagia, a greek girl who lives with her father, and is learning to become a doctor. She threw a good performance, but not as good as John Hurt's, however. He did some good, old acting with some very enticing dialogs about life and love, playing Dr. Iannis, father of Pelagia. She had some very good moments, but it was her looks -staring at the camera in moments of sorrow- that conveyed much more than words at times. These seem to be becoming part of Penelope's unique acting seal.The music was very beautiful: Stephen Warbeck, the same composer of the music for ""Shakespeare in Love"" is to be praised for this. And just as beautiful was the scenery of the island. If only the photography had been a little better, so much more could have been accomplished.Finally, I have to say the screenplay (based on the book by Louis de Berni&egrave;res) did not help any of the above mentioned things, if it actually didn't make them worse. I've not read the book yet, but for certain the script that was pulled out of it was very weak and confusing at times (the characters are far from being exploited to their fullest potential, and many of them you hardly get to know at all, or hardly get to know each other, the most critical example being Capt.

538947,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXXF,Matthew Horner,"[3, 4]","I have read that the film version of Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a disappointment to fans of the novel. I can't comment on that because I didn't read the book. I can say that it is a disappointment as a movie.The movie begins in 1940 on the spectacularly beautiful Greek island of Kefallonia. The winds of war are sweeping across Europe. Italy, allied with Nazi Germany, has begun an invasion of Greece. The residents are somewhat philosophical about this because, over its long history, the island has suffered numerous invasions, as well as devastating earthquakes.The story is narrated by Dr. Iannis [John Hurt], a lifelong resident. He has seen to it that his beautiful and intelligent young daughter, Pelagia [Penelope Cruz], has received a good education. She is in love with Mandras [Christian Bale], a local fisherman. Her father knows that Mandras will never be Pelagia's equal, but his protestations do not stop the couple from getting engaged.One warm, bright day the Italian troops arrive. It's not a violent event, since the island has no army. Among the Italians is the dashing but gentle Capt. Antonio Corelli [Nicholas Cage], who has never aimed a gun at anyone in his life and who would rather be singing and playing his mandolin. He winds up being bivouacked in the Dr.Iannis and Pelagria's home. He is attracted to her, but she at first does not respond. She sees him only as part of an invading force. Later, though, she begins to view him differently. He is the equal she has unknowingly been waiting for. A classic love triangle begins to emerge, and the war that so far has been relatively benign will soon become malignant for both the islanders and the Italians.Regular readers know that the war movie is not my favorite kind. Of the ones I've liked, the majority center around the effects of war on civilian populations. Captain Corelli's Mandolin could have been one I enjoyed. The movie is as much about love and the ability of life to thrive in even the harshest settings than it is about war.A couple of things work against it. One is the script. Even though I didn't read the book, it's as though the movie is a compressed version of it. It's director, John Madden, has made some fine movies, including Shakespeare in Love and Mrs. Brown. Here, he has made editing choices that, while keeping the movie from running three hours, make the story feel choppy. The story advances months and even years without much warning.The other problem is the casting of the main roles. Cage is a fine actor. Though he is most closely associated with action adventure films, he has also shown talent in romantic roles in movies like Moonstruck  and City of Angels. Still, he's not quite soulful or peaceful enough to play Corelli, a most reluctant warrior, convincingly. I have seen Penelope Cruz in several movies she made in her native Spain, and she was quite good. I have yet to be impressed by a performance of hers in an English language flick. She needs to work on getting down the nuances of the language, not just its words. Also, it's disconcerting to hear her Greek character speaking English in a heavy Spanish accent.The star of this movie is Kefallonia itself.

This terrible acting is accented by Nicolas Cage, whose performance makes it seem like he researched his Italian accent by playing &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; games.Thus are the weaknesses of &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin,&quot; a valiant effort of a film that, nevertheless, fails to sizzle. And while the film does have its strengths, they ultimately can't save this picture.Those strengths include John Hurt and Christian Bale. John Hurt plays the highly cliche part of &quot;Wise Old Papa,&quot; and the part is, indeed, highly predictable and run-of-the-mill. But John Hurt is such a subtle and charming actor that he manages to rise above the part and make it a highly enjoyable performance, nevertheless. And Christian Bale does a convincing performance that makes him almost unrecognizable as Penolope Cruz's fiance before &quot;Mamma Mia Nicolas Cage&quot; comes into the story (It's hard to believe that this is the same Christian Bale who only a year before was playing an American WASP in &quot;American Psycho&quot;). These strong performances are coupled with beautiful locations and very smooth-looking cinematography.Still, these strengths cannot save a dulled-down story and terrible leads, and all in all, &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot; is a disappointment. If by chance it happens to be on TV, I'd reccommend a quick watch of it, but if not, than you should probably save your money with this one.",2,&quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot; a Disappointment,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,1661,"['As', 'much', 'NORMALLY', 'LOVE', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'sarcasm', 'folks', 'performance', 'quot', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'quot', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'series', 'gawky', 'smiles', 'frowns', 'accompanied', 'girlish', 'squeeks', 'squaks', 'terrible', 'acting', 'accented', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'performance', 'seem', 'researched', 'Italian', 'accent', 'playing', 'quot', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'quot', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'quot', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'quot', 'valiant', 'effort', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'sizzle', 'film', 'have', 'strengths', 'ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'picture.Those', 'strengths', 'include', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'John', 'Hurt', 'highly', 'cliche', 'part', 'quot', 'Wise', 'Old', 'Papa', 'quot', 'part', 'indeed', 'highly', 'predictable', 'run-of-the-mill', 'John', 'Hurt', 'such', 'subtle', 'charming', 'actor', 'rise', 'part', 'make', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'nevertheless', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'convincing', 'performance', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Penolope', 'Cruz', 'fiance', 'quot', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'quot', 'story', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'only', 'year', 'was', 'playing', 'American', 'WASP', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'strong', 'performances', 'are', 'coupled', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'very', 'smooth-looking', 'cinematography.Still', 'strengths', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'dulled-down', 'story', 'terrible', 'leads', 'quot', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'quot', 'disappointment', 'chance', 'be', 'TV', ""'d"", 'reccommend', 'quick', 'watch', 'not', 'should', 'probably', 'save', 'money', 'one']",N/A
538950,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXXF,Mike,"[6, 7]","&quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot; (2001)Love triangles in war movies are quite the trend lately. In Pearl Harbour the script relied on many one-liners and sunsets to portray the love story between, but in Captain Corelli's Mandolin the love story is used through music and expression, which I found to be very different and enjoyable. This movie is very different to Pearl Harbour though, it's more mature and the war story is generally more important than the romance one.There were some things that occasionally annoyed me about the film like the fact that Penelope Cruz continuously is picking flowers or berries (it seems the only excuse for her to bump into Nicholas Cage outside of their home) and the Italians are always singing. The fact that they sing and play the mandolin and all that is very heart-warming but as Cruz points out in one scene ""all you do is sing!"" It got a bit tedious after a while.The movie is also quite boring in places. Some of the scenes are reasonably unnecessary and dull. The movie is a little too drawn-out at the start for my liking. There wasn't enough going on in the first hour to maintain my interest for very long.Luckily, the film improves when the war story starts getting a bit more serious. Much of the first hour is for building up characters, atmosphere and setting. Always a good thing, but some of it was unnecessary as I mentioned before. In the second hour the movie really revs up and gets into action. The love story is thrusted into the plot with great tenderness (and thankfully there are no corny lines!) and the war scenes are more exhilarating and action-packed.Some things throughout the film were always good. Such as the script, which always maintained its heart and soul and development. The scenery was always lucious and stunning and a feast for the eyes. The sets were perfect and very well designed for the period. The tenseness between Cruz and Cage was heating up. The shocks were still delivering after 2 hours. But there was still that occasional uninteresting sequence.The acting stays brilliant throughout the movie and kept me watching always. Cage delivers a stunner again, as the warm-hearted and music-loving captain of the Italians. I've never noticed this before but Cage looks outstandingly Italianish, and he fits the role perfectly. Cruz is sweet and nicely cast in her 40's frocks. Bale's character is one I didn't really like that much but he gave a good performance, but if you're a big fan of his I recommend checking out American Psycho. John Hurt who played Pelagia's (Cruz) father was by far the best performer in the film, his character was a moustache-twirling admirable philosopher and Hurt just slipped into the character with such enthusiasm and easiness he ignited the screen!John Madden is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. He's directed such films as Mrs. Brown, Shakespeare in Love and now Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Madden is excellent at staging his films and making them look great. His effort with camera shots is stunning. Even better, he has a knack for always developing his characters and picking two of them to have a closeness that intrigues the audience. Madden covers all areas of filmmaking that need to be and I would establish him as a very promising director and writer. I appreciated his vision with this one and I look forward to more films from him in the next couple of years.People should not trust the critics who didn't like this film so much and catch the movie. It has a good plot, it's beautifully staged and very well-acted. It really keeps you engaged and wondering what's going to happen next. Add to that it has a variety of different characters and emotions, and its sounds beautiful too with the fabulous singing and playing of the mandolin (yes, I didn't know what it was either!). This is not one I highly recommend if you don't have a lot of patience though.MY GRADE: B",4,"Long, but beautifully acted and staged.",1018569600,"04 12, 2002",2002,3921,"['quot', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'quot', '2001', 'Love', 'triangles', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'trend', 'lately', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'script', 'relied', 'many', 'one-liners', 'sunsets', 'portray', 'love', 'story', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'love', 'story', 'used', 'music', 'expression', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'more', 'mature', 'war', 'story', 'generally', 'more', 'important', 'romance', 'were', 'things', 'occasionally', 'annoyed', 'film', 'fact', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'continuously', 'picking', 'flowers', 'berries', 'only', 'excuse', 'bump', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'home', 'Italians', 'are', 'always', 'singing', 'fact', 'sing', 'play', 'mandolin', 'very', 'heart-warming', 'Cruz', 'out', 'one', 'scene', 'do', 'sing', 'got', 'bit', 'tedious', 'while.The', 'movie', 'also', 'quite', 'boring', 'places', 'scenes', 'are', 'reasonably', 'unnecessary', 'dull', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'drawn-out', 'start', 'liking', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'going', 'first', 'hour', 'maintain', 'interest', 'very', 'long.Luckily', 'film', 'when', 'war', 'story', 'getting', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'Much', 'first', 'hour', 'building', 'up', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'Always', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'mentioned', 'before', 'second', 'hour', 'movie', 'really', 'revs', 'up', 'action', 'love', 'story', 'thrusted', 'plot', 'great', 'tenderness', 'thankfully', 'are', 'corny', 'lines', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'exhilarating', 'action-packed.Some', 'things', 'film', 'were', 'always', 'good', 'Such', 'script', 'always', 'maintained', 'heart', 'soul', 'development', 'scenery', 'was', 'always', 'lucious', 'stunning', 'feast', 'eyes', 'sets', 'were', 'perfect', 'very', 'well', 'designed', 'period', 'tenseness', 'Cruz', 'Cage', 'was', 'heating', 'up', 'shocks', 'were', 'still', 'delivering', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'still', 'occasional', 'uninteresting', 'sequence.The', 'acting', 'stays', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'kept', 'watching', 'always', 'Cage', 'stunner', 'again', 'warm-hearted', 'music-loving', 'captain', 'Italians', ""'ve"", 'never', 'noticed', 'Cage', 'outstandingly', 'Italianish', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Cruz', 'sweet', 'nicely', 'cast', '40', 'frocks', 'Bale', 'character', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'much', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'American', 'Psycho', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'played', 'Pelagia', 'Cruz', 'father', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'performer', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'moustache-twirling', 'admirable', 'philosopher', 'Hurt', 'just', 'slipped', 'character', 'such', 'enthusiasm', 'easiness', 'ignited', 'screen', 'John', 'Madden', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'favourite', 'directors', 'directed', 'such', 'films', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'now', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'Madden', 'excellent', 'staging', 'films', 'making', 'look', 'great', 'effort', 'camera', 'shots', 'stunning', 'Even', 'better', 'knack', 'always', 'developing', 'characters', 'picking', 'two', 'have', 'closeness', 'audience', 'Madden', 'areas', 'filmmaking', 'need', 'be', 'would', 'establish', 'very', 'promising', 'director', 'writer', 'appreciated', 'vision', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'films', 'next', 'couple', 'years.People', 'should', 'not', 'trust', 'critics', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'catch', 'movie', 'good', 'plot', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'very', 'well-acted', 'really', 'engaged', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Add', 'variety', 'different', 'characters', 'emotions', 'sounds', 'beautiful', 'too', 'fabulous', 'singing', 'playing', 'mandolin', 'yes', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'either', 'not', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'patience', 'though.MY', 'GRADE', 'B']",N/A

538952,A2EWC48FRNO3YP,B00003CXXF,"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99""","[3, 4]","A confession:  I did not read the book.  From what I can gather from reviewers, those who did read &quot;Corelli&quot; were sadly disappointed by  Hollywood's hatchet job.  Whaddja expect?As for the besotted grognard that I am, and not having been contaminated by prior perusal of that sensitive and romantic novel, I found the DVD &quot;Corelli&quot; to be a passable evening's entertainment, not great, but OK.  I happen to be a Nicholas Cage fan, although he is showing signs of overexposure in real turkey movies (&quot;e.g. &quot;Windtalkers&quot;) but still shows brilliance in films like &quot;Matchstick Men.&quot;  He is best when playing eccentric characters (&quot;Raising Arizona&quot;) and does less well when confined.  &quot;Corelli&quot; is somewhere in between.  His Italian accent is OK but along the lines of the old faux Italian restaurant operator in the ad, &quot;Chianti for everybody!&quot;  I found Penelope Cruz to be an unconvincing Greek, but how many convincing Greeks are there between Irene Pappas and Anthony Quinn?The story line is plausible.  We see a  happy and prosperous Greek fishing village where Penelope Cruz and her physician father live high on a hill above the town.  A swarthy but otherwise illiterate young fisherman yens for Cruz but she is hesitant (this is about all we get to know about the dark handsome fisherman, who eventually runs off to join the partisans).  Suddenly, the war intervenes and the Italians arrive to take over the town, assisted by a few Germans who are, at this point, non-assertive.  (Italy attacked Greece from Albania in the fall of 1940, got pushed back into Albania, and was ultimately bailed out of its embarrassment by German forces in the spring of 1941.)I suspect that in the book, the Italians are more complex; here, Corelli's artillerymen would rather sing opera and drink wine than tend to their guns.  Corelli's guileless charm ultimately wins over Cruz (she likes him, she likes him not) and a young German liaison officer who senses that his Italian allies are great drinking buddies but unreliable.  Flash forward to 1943: Italy capitulates to the Allies and attempts (mostly unsuccessfully) to switch sides; Corelli's troops are forcibly detained by the German occupation forces.  I will not get into the resulting tragedy, but I liked the treatment of this volatile period for the Italians in WW2.  I will not describe what happens to Corelli himself, save that I began to draw uncomfortable parallels to another tear-jerker, ""The English Patient.""I found the earthquake scene near the end of the movie stupid.  Was this to draw a connection between the natural disaster and manmade disaster that was WW2?  Hit me over the head.  And why does Corelli stay away so long after the war?  It's like the Rafe (Afflick) character in ""Pearl Harbor"", who disappears while flying overseas with the RAF, and then after many months all he can pen to his girlfriend is a hastily scrawled note, ""I am alive.""  Is the man illiterate?  Was he in a coma?  They did have telephones.

Cox,"[1, 1]","Captain Corelli's Mandolin***This movie deserved three stars, one for the setting and cinematography, one for John Hurt as the ageing doctor, and one for a certain degree of panache.In spite of its incongruity (a war film featuring warbling invaders) this film almost pulls it off.The movie was worth watching for the scenery alone.  The broad base historical events really happened,  which is tragic in itself.  I would have adored this film when I was seventeen.I like Nicholas Cage as a rule, but he is miscast here.  His so-called Italian accent is spotty at best.  (His performance,  when measured against his own yardstick, was wooden.)  Penelope Cruz's naturally Spanish accent came across as less forced, although how it sounded to Greek audiences, I would not know.  She is beautiful, so truly beautiful that one forgives her for not showing more raw passion.  There is a definite spark there, and she should improve as she gets older.It is difficult to have a movie cast speaking in ""foreign accents.""

538956,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B00003CXXF,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[3, 3]","This scenic movie combines loose history and romance.  Having not read the book I can not be critical of it on that level, though I'm sure changes were made that would upset readers.  The scenery and filming are beautiful, and these are the real strengths of the work in my opinion.  If you can survive Nicholas Cage's weak Italian accent, then chances are you will find this flick enjoyable.  I did, even though I had to wince every time Cage tried his stage Italian.  Still, his character manages to grow on you after a while somehow, and Ms. Cruz, while not Greek herself (Mexican I think) still manages to look and sound the part.  Having American actors play foreigners seems always to be problematical these days.  William Hurt's moving narration gives a lot of humor and warmth to this film. His words give the movie a sense of passing time, which combined with the beautiful scenery deffinitely convey a saga spanning many years.The German intervention against the Italians is probably the best part of the movie and the most interesting.  I can't comment on how accurate this is as far as the history goes, but at least its well done. The Sturkas, halftracks and even the German Hetzer assault gun are all accurately depicted weapons.  You might wine about this being a weepy romance, but the production value was supurb.  Someone really did their research to portray correct equipment here and I give any WW2 era movie credit for that!  Overall, something for everyone here.  A dropy romance for the ladies, and tanks and Stukha's for the guys!  Not a bad combo.  Just try and keep a straight face with Cage and his operatic singing!

I've been wrong before, but this movie never even made me think twice about my final analysis:  skip it.First and foremost, I'm bothered by the logistics.  The film takes place on a lovely Greek island that is occupied by Italians during WWII.  Penelope Cruz portrays an attractive young Greek woman; Nicholas Cage a reluctant Italian soldier who just happens to be quartered at the home Pelagia (Cruz) shares with her physician father.  Forgive me, but I was extrememly distracted by the fact that EVERYONE spoke English.  The locals sit around reading Greek newspapers while they twitter on in English and listen to English news on the radio.  Nobody--the Italians, the Greeks, the Germans who showed up now and then--had any trouble communicating.  Good grief!  The writers and director of this film didn't even try to pull off any communication barriers with the characters in this film--and Cruz didn't even try to shed her Spanish accent.I didn't read the book, but it was immediately obvious that this would be a love-triangle movie.  Sure enough . . . it was.  There are few surprises here, folks, and not even good acting to balance it out.  The dialogue is contrived and silly, especially Cage's over-the-top sense of humor.  His honking laughter in this film doesn't become him.This film would have been beautiful if it had been produced by Italians or Greeks--that way they could cast native speakers and the petty language issue would go away.

538960,A27A3AZA7L12N6,B00003CXXF,Stephen M. Bauer,"[6, 7]","For pure entertainment, it's hard to beat a love story wrapped in a war story.  As a war story, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a failure.  As a love story, it's barely there, but the combination is greater than the sum of the parts.  The story is rich; it's historical, and the cinematography of a sunny Greek island will give any movie a lift.Set in World War II, the Italian army, under the control of the Germans, occupies the Greek Island of Cephallonia.  The islanders are not intimidated in the least, by the Italians.  They regard them as hopeless, spineless cowards and the most pathetic excuse for soldiers.  These soldiers are not real fighting men anyway.  They are musicians in uniform.  Despite the intrusion of the Italian occupiers, these musicians bring a love of music and an enjoyment life, where they can find it, to the war stressed town.Penelope Cruz plays Pelagia, a medical student and daughter of the village doctor.  She has a boyfriend in the village, Madras, who is involved with the Greek resistance.  Nicholas Cage plays Captain Corelii, the ranking Italian officer on the island.  He of course, works on charming the initially hostile Pelagia away from Madras.  The romance is a little frustrating.  It's stretched out over the length of the film without enough romantic, ""Action, "" along the way.I've always liked Nicholas Cage.  By the formulas of Hollywood, he was not perfectly cast as the Captain.  His posture is awkward.  He's not slick, not a classic romantic type.  But the rough fit gives the film some of it's charm.  Penelope Cruz doesn't seem perfectly cast either, but by some magic, she made a Penelope Cruz fan out of me.  On the down side, Cage's accent is horrendous, by the way, and varies throughout the film.  It doesn't hurt the film, but both Cage and Cruz seem far too old for the roles they play.I thought the portrayal of the German officer, Captain Weber, by David Morrissey, was exceptional.  He is not characterized as the stereotypical, Teutonic tyrant.  With very little screen time, I felt his characterization was human, complex, sympathetic and conflicted.Christian Bale's acting, as Madras, is also excellent.  As a member of the Greek resistance and as Captain Corelli's rival for Pelagia, he has every reason to do him.  Observe his non-verbal behavior.In contrast to the Greek islander's initial view of the Italians, in the end, Captain Corelli and his band of musicians turn out to be courageous men of conviction.  The musicians fight, and die, for the love of life, humanity and the love of a woman.  By contrast the Germans fight and kill, for all the wrong things.  And when it came to life and love, it is our German officer, so capable of life and love, who becomes the spineless coward.How sad it was to read in the film's afterward that the German military executed thousands of Italian soldiers on Cephallonia in 1943.  How sad it is that so many films today entertain people with faked violence, exaggerated a thousand fold; yet, we remain ignorant where it was a reality.  By contrast, the makers of Captain Corelli's Mandolin had to minimize showing the historical violence so it would not obliterate the love story.  In the movie there is just violence enough to shock and inform us.The film was based on a historical novel of the same name, by the way.  If you want to know more about the historical incident upon which the movie was based, just search on the Internet for Cephallonia.  It is one of the three Ionian Islands, which also happen to be the birth place of Greek philosophy.  Today, the Greeks have a shrine there for the executed Italian soldiers.  The actual execution sites and places where the bodies were dumped are marked and preserved.  Many Greeks and Italians pray at the sites.",4,"Tragedy & love, drawn from history, on a sunny Greek isle!",1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,3782,"['pure', 'entertainment', 'hard', 'beat', 'love', 'story', 'wrapped', 'war', 'story', 'war', 'story', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'failure', 'love', 'story', 'barely', 'there', 'combination', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'story', 'rich', 'historical', 'cinematography', 'sunny', 'Greek', 'island', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'lift.Set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Italian', 'army', 'control', 'Germans', 'Greek', 'Island', 'Cephallonia', 'islanders', 'are', 'not', 'intimidated', 'least', 'Italians', 'regard', 'hopeless', 'spineless', 'cowards', 'most', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'soldiers', 'soldiers', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'fighting', 'men', 'anyway', 'are', 'musicians', 'uniform', 'intrusion', 'Italian', 'occupiers', 'musicians', 'bring', 'love', 'music', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'war', 'stressed', 'town.Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Pelagia', 'medical', 'student', 'daughter', 'village', 'doctor', 'boyfriend', 'village', 'Madras', 'who', 'involved', 'Greek', 'resistance', 'Cage', 'Captain', 'Corelii', 'ranking', 'Italian', 'officer', 'island', 'course', 'charming', 'initially', 'hostile', 'Pelagia', 'away', 'Madras', 'romance', 'little', 'frustrating', 'stretched', 'out', 'length', 'film', 'enough', 'romantic', 'Action', 'way.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'formulas', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'not', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Captain', 'posture', 'awkward', 'not', 'slick', 'not', 'classic', 'romantic', 'type', 'rough', 'fit', 'film', 'charm', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', ""n't"", 'seem', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'either', 'magic', 'made', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'fan', 'down', 'side', 'Cage', 'accent', 'horrendous', 'way', 'varies', 'film', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'Cage', 'Cruz', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'play.I', 'thought', 'portrayal', 'German', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Weber', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'was', 'exceptional', 'not', 'characterized', 'stereotypical', 'Teutonic', 'tyrant', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'felt', 'characterization', 'was', 'human', 'complex', 'sympathetic', 'conflicted.Christian', 'Bale', 'acting', 'Madras', 'also', 'excellent', 'member', 'Greek', 'resistance', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'rival', 'Pelagia', 'reason', 'do', 'Observe', 'non-verbal', 'behavior.In', 'contrast', 'Greek', 'islander', 'initial', 'view', 'Italians', 'end', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'band', 'musicians', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'courageous', 'men', 'conviction', 'musicians', 'fight', 'die', 'love', 'life', 'humanity', 'love', 'woman', 'contrast', 'Germans', 'fight', 'kill', 'wrong', 'things', 'when', 'came', 'life', 'love', 'German', 'officer', 'so', 'capable', 'life', 'love', 'who', 'spineless', 'coward.How', 'sad', 'was', 'read', 'film', 'afterward', 'German', 'military', 'executed', 'thousands', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'Cephallonia', '1943', 'How', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'today', 'entertain', 'people', 'faked', 'violence', 'exaggerated', 'thousand', 'fold', 'yet', 'remain', 'ignorant', 'where', 'was', 'reality', 'contrast', 'makers', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'had', 'minimize', 'showing', 'historical', 'violence', 'would', 'not', 'obliterate', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'just', 'violence', 'enough', 'shock', 'inform', 'us.The', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'historical', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'way', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'historical', 'incident', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'just', 'search', 'Internet', 'Cephallonia', 'one', 'three', 'Ionian', 'Islands', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'birth', 'place', 'Greek', 'philosophy', 'Today', 'Greeks', 'have', 'shrine', 'there', 'executed', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'actual', 'execution', 'sites', 'places', 'where', 'bodies', 'were', 'dumped', 'are', 'marked', 'preserved', 'Many', 'Greeks', 'Italians', 'pray', 'sites']",N/A

I also hope that in the intervening years, you have learned to read and write. If you have not, please have someone read the letter to you, much like they did when you were on the front lines in Albania, in the early days of the War.Before the War disrupted our idyllic, country life on the beautiful Greek Island that we grew up on, we lived a simple life. You returned home from fishing and your strapping body was too much to resist. Ah, those moments when you threw me into the water and we frolicked around together. To relive those times. I thought it was the smartest thing in the world for me to become engaged to you, before you left for the Albanian border. I was a medical student chomping at the bit for knowledge. You were an illiterate small village fisherman. It was to be a match made in heaven.How was I to know that an Italian Captain, who could speak Greek, German and Italian, but couldn't master his own accent, would come and turn my whole life around. Ah, that captain. Ah, that captain and his beautiful mandolin. His name, as you know, was Captain Antonio Correlli (Nicholas Cage) and I was never particularly attracted to him. If I was, I sure couldn't let my father, Dr. Iannis (John Hurt), see it. Much to my surprise, my father seems to have wanted me to become `friendly' with him. After all, he made an arrangement to get medical supplies in exchange for the Captain boarding with us. The attraction never seemed to be there, but my father waxed many platitudes about this and just about every other conceivable subject under the sun. My father is very wise.What a fun-loving group of Italians they were. An opera signing regiment, lead by the Captain, singing opera at every chance, frolicking in the waves with the Italian women they brought with them. They were here to fight a war, but damned if they weren't going to enjoy it as well. What a wacky bunch.I don't understand his attraction to me, either, but naturally when he played his little song to me on the mandolin, I fell in love. He found me in that garden that day and we made love, such good love, that I had to touch my lips many times, smiling, as I remembered his groping.Then, of course, the allies landed in Rome and the Germans wanted to take control of the idyllic Greek island where we lived. What a terrible time. Correlli realized that the German's would never let them go and tried to help defend out island, but... Enough of this history.The attraction that we shared is a strange thing, I don't really understand it, much to this day, and I must apologize again for letting it end our relationship. I am so happy that you were able to help him and he you. It means a lot to me that you embraced him as you did.But to the point of my letter, Mandras. I need your help. Now that Correlli and I have been together for many years, I am still wrestling with the reason why. He is not attracted to me and I am not attracted to him. I mean, he waited many years after the end of the war to contact me and I have to wonder why.He is also teaching the grandchildren Opera. He would rather they sing an Opera than to talk and discuss things, to learn. Rather than learning many operas, he insists that they sing only the most recognizable operas, like `Santa Lucia'.And that accent! It drivea me uppa the wall. The man has Italian ancestors and you would have to think that someone in the family would have an Italian accent. You would think it would be easier for him to approximate the accent of his heritage.But Mandras, I have come to learn that my father, the village doctor, that he adopted me.

I enjoyed this movie apart from one thing: Casting Cage in the leading role was a big mistake, in my opinion. I'm not trying to take anything away from Cage's acting ability here - he is great in some parts, such as in &quot;Face Off&quot; and &quot;The Rock&quot; but he is about as convincing as an Italian lover as Austin Powers would be! It is painful, almost, watching Cage try to be Italian. In one of the early scenes Cage is conducting his men singing the Anvil Chorus while they shave, with huge and overdne gestures. All I can see when he does this is Cage as the madman in the Halleluja Chorus scene in &quot;Face Off&quot;! Ditto when he laughs wildly and says &quot;Quick, get a gun&quot; when the father breaks the curfew. It just doesn't wash, somehow. However, that said, as the film progresses, Cage does seem to become more comfortable in the part and therefore more convincing.",4,Worth seeing,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1013,"['movie', 'everything', 'romance', 'action', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'human', 'interest', 'wonderful', 'locations', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'apart', 'one', 'thing', 'Casting', 'Cage', 'leading', 'role', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Cage', 'acting', 'ability', 'here', 'great', 'parts', 'such', 'quot', 'Face', 'Off', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rock', 'quot', 'about', 'as', 'convincing', 'Italian', 'lover', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'would', 'be', 'painful', 'almost', 'watching', 'Cage', 'try', 'be', 'Italian', 'one', 'early', 'scenes', 'Cage', 'conducting', 'men', 'singing', 'Anvil', 'Chorus', 'shave', 'huge', 'overdne', 'gestures', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'Cage', 'madman', 'Halleluja', 'Chorus', 'scene', 'quot', 'Face', 'Off', 'quot', 'Ditto', 'when', 'wildly', 'quot', 'Quick', 'get', 'gun', 'quot', 'when', 'father', 'curfew', 'just', ""n't"", 'wash', 'somehow', 'However', 'said', 'film', 'Cage', 'seem', 'become', 'more', 'comfortable', 'part', 'therefore', 'more', 'convincing']",N/A

Nicolas Cage is a terrible actor and his fake Italian accent was getting on my nerves in a major way. All the Italians in the movie joke around and sing-that all they do. I also couldn't see how they(N and P) fell in love. One day they just were. Yeah, right. I have to add one more thing and its about Penelope's looks. I think with right clothes and makeup she can look decent but in this movie she looks downright horrid. Her hair is done in the most unflattering hairdo on the planet and her clothes look as if she robbed the scarecrow. Whether the look was intentional or accidental is a mystery.  The ending was incredibly stupid. He leaves Penelope until the war is over and then doesn't come back until two years later because he feels guilty about coming between her and her fianc&eacute;.

But 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is certainly a decent film.  Although it's not as enjoyable as the above mentioned two, it still has its high points.  Pen&eacute;lope Cruz co-stars with Cage (Captain Corelli), who is attracted to Cruz (Pelagia).  And even though she is engaged, her fiance Mandras (Christian Bale) is a fighter; therefore she's left alone and in need of attention.And the fact that Corelli is Italian and Pelagia is Greek doesn't make things easier. As you can imagine, they do end up falling in love.  But that love is on the brink, due to the fact that Pelagia's husband to be is on his way back, and an attack from the Germans is about to get underway.  And when I say it's a war movie without war, I mean there's not much fighting going on.  It's not at all like 'Windtalkers', Nicolas Cage's latest film.  It's a different sort of war movie; it's torn between the idea of being a war movie and a romance story.I don't want to spoil any more of the movie, so I'll leave it at that.  Director John Madden does a great job with the cast, and makes a movie I believe is better than his hit 'Shakespeare In Love'.  The reason I ever bothered to rent this movie is because of Nicolas Cage, of who I am a big fan.  And I was not disappointed with his performance or the quality of the movie.  As it's hard to categorize this film as either a war or romance film, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys one or the other (or both, for that matter).  And if you're a Nicolas Cage fan, you need to check out his acting performance; it's incomparable to any other role he's played.",3,A war movie without war,1045699200,"02 20, 2003",2003,1710,"['Nicolas', 'Cage', 'made', ""'Gone"", '60', 'Seconds', 'Family', 'Man', ""'d"", 'expect', 'next', 'movie', 'be', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', ""'Captain"", 'Corelli', 'Mandolin', 'certainly', 'decent', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'above', 'mentioned', 'two', 'still', 'high', 'points', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'co-stars', 'Cage', 'Captain', 'Corelli', 'who', 'attracted', 'Cruz', 'Pelagia', 'even', 'engaged', 'fiance', 'Mandras', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fighter', 'left', 'alone', 'need', 'fact', 'Corelli', 'Italian', 'Pelagia', 'Greek', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'can', 'imagine', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'love', 'brink', 'due', 'fact', 'Pelagia', 'husband', 'be', 'way', 'back', 'attack', 'Germans', 'get', 'underway', 'when', 'say', 'war', 'movie', 'war', 'mean', 'not', 'much', 'fighting', 'going', 'not', ""'Windtalkers"", 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'latest', 'film', 'different', 'sort', 'war', 'movie', 'torn', 'idea', 'being', 'war', 'movie', 'romance', 'story.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'more', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'Director', 'John', 'Madden', 'great', 'job', 'cast', 'movie', 'believe', 'better', 'hit', ""'Shakespeare"", 'Love', 'reason', 'ever', 'bothered', 'rent', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'quality', 'movie', 'hard', 'categorize', 'film', 'war', 'romance', 'film', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'one', 'other', 'matter', ""'re"", 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'fan', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'acting', 'performance', 'incomparable', 'other', 'role', 'played']",N/A
