The video is harmless enough, I suppose, but why have Celia Cruz singing in English?  It's more of an exposure to some of the most well-known Latin American celebrations than a language video.  It may be good as a gift to parents who freak out if they hear a ""foreign"" language being spoken without everything repeated in English.",2,Very little Spanish,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,414,"['almost', 'entirely', 'English', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'marketed', 'Spanish', 'category', 'video', 'harmless', 'enough', 'suppose', 'why', 'have', 'Celia', 'Cruz', 'singing', 'English', 'more', 'exposure', 'most', 'well-known', 'Latin', 'American', 'celebrations', 'language', 'video', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'gift', 'parents', 'who', 'freak', 'out', 'hear', 'foreign', 'language', 'being', 'spoken', 'everything', 'repeated', 'English']",N/A

The songs are upbeat and catchy, of course all the Muppets dance themselves silly so your kids will love imitating them, and the celebrity singers, i.e. Celia Cruz, Linda Rondstadt added to the fun.

Earl ""Photographer""","[1, 1]","This is a great video to introduce your child to counting and speaking in Spanish, and to introduce some aspects of Mexican culture.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers that said it should include more Spanish--it is for small children, after all.  The basis of the storyline is that Maria, Gaby, Elmo, and Rosita are building a float for Carnivale.  Elmo breaks the float, and tries to come up with another way to build it.  It is interspersed with great clips from Sesame Street and catchy songs.",5,Entertaining Intro to Spanish and Mexican Culture,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,507,"['great', 'video', 'introduce', 'child', 'counting', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'introduce', 'aspects', 'Mexican', 'culture', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'should', 'include', 'more', 'Spanish', 'small', 'children', 'basis', 'storyline', 'Maria', 'Gaby', 'Elmo', 'Rosita', 'are', 'building', 'float', 'Carnivale', 'Elmo', 'float', 'tries', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'build', 'interspersed', 'great', 'clips', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'catchy', 'songs']",N/A
