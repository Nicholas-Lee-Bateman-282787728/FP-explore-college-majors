280322,A14CLM6MITNDM8,6301969235,B. Wilson,"[6, 6]","Combine Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy and a wild dream and what could be more fun?The premise of a boss and secretary falling in love and marrying is as old as the hills, but there's nothing about this plot that can remotely be called ordinary.  Let your mind wander into the realm of bizarre dreams and believe in the adage of ""be careful what you wish for because it might come true"" ... and this movie is a riot.  Yes, the original script fell victim to the Hays Code censorship who considered an angel losing her wings on her wedding night to be too scandalous for the times.  But in spite of numerous script re-writes, the story line is entertaining and Nelson & Jeanette appear to be having a blast with their unconventional roles.For the 6 years she's worked at the Palaffi bank, Anna Zador (Jeanette) has had a crush on her boss, but playboy Count Willi Palaffi doesn't even know the shy secretary exists.  All that changes when she is invited to his birthday costume party.  Her simple, cheaply made angel costume and sweetly shy demeanor glare in stark comparison to the lavish outfits and flirty exuberant behavior of the other guests and she quickly becomes the butt of jokes, drawing laughter from everyone including Willi.  But when he realizes he's hurt her feelings he apologizes and asks her to dance.  Afterwards and with the party still in full swing, Willi makes his way upstairs where he falls asleep.  And thus begins the dream.Enter Brigitta ... an angel who in Willi's champagne-hazed subconscious looks just like Anna Zador.  Brigitta announces she's been sent to marry him and that she will devote herself to his happiness.  At first Willi is enchanted by the sweet, pure demeanor and blatant honesty of his angel bride, but soon her overt truthfulness begins to cause him nothing but trouble.  His attempts to convert her to the more human like trait of shading the truth, backfires badly, leaving his marriage in shreds and him in ruin.  He declares he never again wants to hear the truth.  But by the time his dream ends, he recognizes the error of his ways and awakens to the realization that he's fallen in love with Anna Zador.The movie is an amusing fantasy with some wonderful songs and two terrific and charming stars whose voices are once again in fine form.  Jeanette even gets to display her dancing talent in a hearty Charleston with actress Binnie Barnes in a scene that is great fun.  As an interesting piece of trivia, actor Douglass Dumbrille who co-starred with Nelson & Jeanette in their first movie together (Naughty Marietta) also co-stars in this one, their last as a team.  And in both movies Dumbrille takes the role of the person pulling their relationship apart.MacDonald & Eddy were always terrific together and this movie is worth watching for that reason alone.  But if you enjoy comedic fantasy this is a definite must.",4,A Wild Dream Provides Great Entertainment,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2877,"['Combine', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'wild', 'dream', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'premise', 'boss', 'secretary', 'falling', 'love', 'marrying', 'as', 'old', 'hills', 'nothing', 'plot', 'can', 'remotely', 'be', 'called', 'ordinary', 'Let', 'mind', 'wander', 'realm', 'bizarre', 'dreams', 'believe', 'adage', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'might', 'come', 'true', 'movie', 'riot', 'Yes', 'original', 'script', 'fell', 'victim', 'Hays', 'Code', 'censorship', 'who', 'considered', 'angel', 'losing', 'wings', 'wedding', 'night', 'be', 'too', 'scandalous', 'times', 'spite', 'numerous', 'script', 're-writes', 'story', 'line', 'entertaining', 'Nelson', 'Jeanette', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'unconventional', 'roles.For', '6', 'years', 'worked', 'Palaffi', 'bank', 'Anna', 'Zador', 'Jeanette', 'had', 'crush', 'boss', 'playboy', 'Count', 'Willi', 'Palaffi', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'shy', 'secretary', 'exists', 'changes', 'when', 'invited', 'birthday', 'costume', 'party', 'simple', 'cheaply', 'made', 'angel', 'costume', 'sweetly', 'shy', 'demeanor', 'glare', 'stark', 'comparison', 'lavish', 'outfits', 'flirty', 'exuberant', 'behavior', 'other', 'guests', 'quickly', 'butt', 'jokes', 'drawing', 'laughter', 'everyone', 'including', 'Willi', 'when', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'dance', 'Afterwards', 'party', 'still', 'full', 'swing', 'Willi', 'way', 'where', 'asleep', 'thus', 'dream.Enter', 'Brigitta', 'angel', 'who', 'Willi', 'champagne-hazed', 'subconscious', 'just', 'like', 'Anna', 'Zador', 'Brigitta', 'been', 'sent', 'marry', 'will', 'devote', 'happiness', 'first', 'Willi', 'enchanted', 'sweet', 'pure', 'demeanor', 'blatant', 'honesty', 'angel', 'bride', 'soon', 'overt', 'truthfulness', 'cause', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'attempts', 'convert', 'more', 'human', 'trait', 'shading', 'truth', 'backfires', 'badly', 'leaving', 'marriage', 'shreds', 'ruin', 'never', 'again', 'hear', 'truth', 'time', 'dream', 'error', 'ways', 'awakens', 'realization', 'fallen', 'love', 'Anna', 'Zador.The', 'movie', 'amusing', 'fantasy', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'two', 'terrific', 'charming', 'stars', 'voices', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'fine', 'form', 'Jeanette', 'even', 'display', 'dancing', 'talent', 'hearty', 'Charleston', 'actress', 'Binnie', 'Barnes', 'scene', 'great', 'fun', 'interesting', 'piece', 'trivia', 'actor', 'Douglass', 'Dumbrille', 'who', 'co-starred', 'Nelson', 'Jeanette', 'first', 'movie', 'together', 'Naughty', 'Marietta', 'also', 'co-stars', 'one', 'last', 'team', 'movies', 'Dumbrille', 'role', 'person', 'pulling', 'relationship', 'Eddy', 'were', 'always', 'terrific', 'together', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'reason', 'alone', 'enjoy', 'comedic', 'fantasy', 'definite', 'must']",N/A

By the time this film was released in 1942, the extravagances of their past successes were already dated, what with wartime and the rise of performers like Betty Grable, so MGM revisited a risque stage show which they had never been able to get through the censors to provide a sophisticated but more contemporary setting. At the time, the film was panned for, among other things, the change of pace for the stars but in 2013, what we see is a beautifully produced fantasy of a playboy who falls for an angel in a dream. The dialogue is full of witticisms which circumvent the censor and give free reign to Macdonald's sense of fun. Her parody of a vamp is superb and the rhyming couplets delightful. All the songs are terrific, many by Rogers and Hart. The leads are really too old for their roles but it simply does not matter.The DVD has been released in the Warner's Archive Series which means it is unrestored and expensive, not even with scene selection but it does contain the original trailer which makes clear MGM's attempt to modernise the stars.

Of course, since I was a child, I have always been partial to Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald films. Together, they made beautiful music. This film is particularly bittersweet, as it was their final film together, forever ending a wonderful musical chapter in Hollywood history.Based upon the Rogers and Hart broadway hit, the film's plot is simple. Taking place in Budapest, a handsome and rich banker, thirty something playboy, Count William Palaffi (Nelson Eddy), falls asleep at his birthday party, dreaming of being married to a heaven sent angel named Brigitta (Jeanette MacDonald). The dream tracks the early days of their marriage and her transition from angel to devil in an effort to please her husband. When he awakens, he realizes that his angel has been there all along, as Ms. Szabo (Jeanette MacDonald), a secretary from his bank who had attended his costume birthday fete dressed up as an angel is a doppelganger for Brigitta. The path to true love is a strange one, indeed!The costumes are lovely in this film, and the music is glorious.

280334,A13M2TSVMDTBC8,6301969235,Ol'BlueEyes,"[0, 0]","My ninety-two year old mother worshipped Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald when she was a girl. I had bought her a TV with built-in DVD player but found that the series had never been released on DVD in the US. I found that I could order them from Brazil, in English. (Turner finally started producing the DVDs and they can be bought on the Amazon or Turner sites.)When I watched them I found that Jeanette MacDonald was quite a woman for her time and several of the Eddy/MacDonald films were very good. The first in the series, Naughty Marietta, in particular was a good romantic comedy, with the very funny extended ""omelet/radish"" scene, augmented by some good musical numbers (""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" and ""Italian Street Song"").Several others that I watched didn't interest me as much, but at least always had a few good scenes and songs. ""I Married an Angel"" was the last of the series and was always regarded as the worst. When I found a cheap copy of the DVD available, I decided that I wanted to see it and judge for myself, mainly because it was based on a Rodger and Hart hit Broadway musical. Could all that talent produce a dud?Unfortunately I found the critics to be correct. The story itself was centered around (I think) a confusing dream sequence that didn't deliver much in the way of drama or humor. Other than the title song, there were no Rodgers and Hart gems hidden in there.If you ever have any interest in seeing what this wildly popular twosome had to offer in the 30s, start with Naughty Marietta. Then if you want any more try Maytime, which is not a comedy but is still highly regarded for the music and the acting of John Barrymore as the villain.If you would like to see a very funny film with MacDonald, a Rodgers and Hart score, and Maurice Chevalier, try the 1932 Love Me Tonight. It introduces the songs ""Lover"", sung by Jeanette, ""Mimi"", sung by Chevalier to MacDonald in their first screwball meeting (""Mimi.

As my daughter and I watched this, she kept screaming over and over, ""This is so stupid!""  And it is.  I couldn't tell her that she was wrong.  But . . . if you can get past the fact that the plot is absurd and the premise ridiculous, it can provide a lot of fun.  The songs are good, even if the context is sometimes dreadful, the singing spirited, and the acting as good as could be expected under the circumstances.  And there is a certain bravery everyone displays in carrying the spirit of the thing all the way to the end.Although the movie is never not embarrassing, the hardest to watch part consists of bank owner Nelson Eddy falling asleep on a couch and having a vivid dream in which an angel, played by Jeanette MacDonald, who bears a striking resemblence to an employee in his bank who has come to his birthday party in an angel costume, descends from heaven with the intent to marry him.  The complications that arise in his dream of this marriage of heaven and earth provide the action for most of the film.  Once one gets past the silliness of all this, it is actually a lot of fun.  As a long time animal rights supporter, I got a kick out of the scene where angel MacDonald refuses to wear a hat with bird feathers on it, or a dress with an animal's tail, or carry a wolfskin hand warmer.  There is also a risque scene where MacDonald wakes up in the morning after her wedding, to discover that she no longer has wings.  And the long scene wedding reception where she speaks the truth to everyone she meets has its charms.  The fact is, while the material is pretty bad, the spirit and gusto with which everyone carries out their parts makes it a lot of fun.This was the end of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's string of enjoyable musicals, and pretty much the end of each's career as a film performer.  MacDonald was hurt by the fact that she would turn 40 the year after this movie was released (the unfair and unfortunate bane of many Hollywood actresses), and Eddy by the fact that his singing style had gone somewhat out of style and had little appeal apart from teaming with MacDonald.  I enjoy their films, though I acknowledge that they are an acquired taste, and lack the universal appeal of someone like Astaire and Rogers.I wish the singing duo had gone out with a better film.  But I proimise this film isn't as bad as many claim.  And if you cut it a lot of slack, it can be a lot of fun.",3,So awful it's good,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2579,"['MARRIED', 'AN', 'ANGEL', 'up', 'lot', 'lists', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'first', 'thing', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'truly', 'dreadful', 'daughter', 'watched', 'kept', 'screaming', 'so', 'stupid', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'wrong', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'plot', 'absurd', 'premise', 'ridiculous', 'can', 'provide', 'lot', 'fun', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'context', 'sometimes', 'dreadful', 'singing', 'spirited', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'circumstances', 'certain', 'bravery', 'everyone', 'displays', 'carrying', 'spirit', 'thing', 'way', 'end.Although', 'movie', 'never', 'not', 'embarrassing', 'hardest', 'watch', 'part', 'bank', 'owner', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'falling', 'asleep', 'couch', 'having', 'vivid', 'dream', 'angel', 'played', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblence', 'employee', 'bank', 'who', 'come', 'birthday', 'party', 'angel', 'costume', 'heaven', 'intent', 'marry', 'complications', 'arise', 'dream', 'marriage', 'heaven', 'earth', 'provide', 'action', 'most', 'film', 'Once', 'one', 'silliness', 'actually', 'lot', 'fun', 'long', 'time', 'animal', 'rights', 'supporter', 'got', 'kick', 'scene', 'where', 'angel', 'MacDonald', 'wear', 'hat', 'bird', 'feathers', 'dress', 'animal', 'tail', 'carry', 'wolfskin', 'hand', 'warmer', 'also', 'risque', 'scene', 'where', 'MacDonald', 'up', 'morning', 'wedding', 'discover', 'longer', 'wings', 'long', 'scene', 'wedding', 'reception', 'where', 'truth', 'everyone', 'charms', 'fact', 'material', 'pretty', 'bad', 'spirit', 'gusto', 'everyone', 'out', 'parts', 'lot', 'fun.This', 'was', 'end', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'string', 'enjoyable', 'musicals', 'pretty', 'much', 'end', 'career', 'film', 'performer', 'MacDonald', 'was', 'hurt', 'fact', 'would', 'turn', '40', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'unfair', 'unfortunate', 'bane', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', 'Eddy', 'fact', 'singing', 'style', 'had', 'gone', 'somewhat', 'style', 'had', 'little', 'appeal', 'apart', 'teaming', 'MacDonald', 'enjoy', 'films', 'acknowledge', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'lack', 'universal', 'appeal', 'someone', 'Astaire', 'Rogers.I', 'wish', 'singing', 'duo', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'better', 'film', 'proimise', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'claim', 'cut', 'lot', 'slack', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A
