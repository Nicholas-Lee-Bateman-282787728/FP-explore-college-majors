Even though it was to have taken place in the Southeastern United States, it is filmed in Oregon with beautiful scenery. The characters and the actors playing the parts make the movie, very well chosen. I loved the movie so much I gave it as a gift to my adult son who loves to fish. The movie revolves around the fishing talents of a soldier who returns from WWII to come home to everything he knew gone -- parents dead, farm owned by someone else, his only sibling in prison. He wanders the rivers of the south fishing to provide food and a livelihood while searching for something, someone he can belong to again. He is truly watched over and guided by an ""angel."" There is the underlying message of how the horrors of war effect the lives of those who live and return home; they can destroy life or make it stronger. Very good movie as a period piece for when life was simpler.",5,The Valley of Light,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,914,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Even', 'was', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'Southeastern', 'United', 'States', 'filmed', 'Oregon', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'characters', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'gave', 'gift', 'adult', 'son', 'who', 'fish', 'movie', 'fishing', 'talents', 'soldier', 'who', 'WWII', 'come', 'home', 'everything', 'knew', 'gone', 'parents', 'dead', 'farm', 'owned', 'someone', 'else', 'only', 'sibling', 'prison', 'rivers', 'south', 'fishing', 'provide', 'food', 'livelihood', 'searching', 'something', 'someone', 'can', 'belong', 'again', 'truly', 'watched', 'guided', 'angel', 'underlying', 'message', 'how', 'horrors', 'war', 'effect', 'lives', 'who', 'live', 'return', 'home', 'can', 'destroy', 'life', 'make', 'stronger', 'Very', 'good', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'simpler']",The Valley of Light (Hallmark Hall of Fame)

However, The Valley of Light is one of those films.  In short, this beautiful story is a gift to mankind. If everyone on the planet could exude as much compassion, wisdom and heart-felt love as the characters in this film, the world would be an entirely different place than the one we know now.  Please let the message of this film ripple out to as many people as possible.  Buy it for family and friends--maybe even your enemies.

1131239,A1P3EE281Z3URI,B0011FYM70,Steve V,"[2, 2]","This is a fine story, wise and well told.  I would call it romance and tragedy, with a blending of fantasy and a dash of comedy.  There is plenty of beauty for eye, ear, and mind. You will notice ""signs"" and broken hearts.It helped me feel the limits of what we can do for people we love.  How many movies are this entertaining, and also good medicine for the heart?Matthew (Zach Mills) and Grannie (Angela Paton) are really quite charming.  The people who made it did a fine job of adapting the story of the novel for use in a movie made for a TV audience.If you like this one, don't miss out onTender Mercies(even better, though not for children).",5,Everyone needs someone,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,649,"['fine', 'story', 'wise', 'well', 'told', 'would', 'call', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'blending', 'fantasy', 'dash', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'beauty', 'eye', 'ear', 'mind', 'will', 'notice', 'signs', 'broken', 'hearts.It', 'helped', 'feel', 'limits', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'people', 'love', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'entertaining', 'also', 'good', 'medicine', 'heart', 'Matthew', 'Zach', 'Mills', 'Grannie', 'Angela', 'Paton', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'charming', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'adapting', 'story', 'novel', 'use', 'movie', 'made', 'TV', 'audience.If', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'onTender', 'Mercies', 'even', 'better', 'not', 'children']",The Valley of Light (Hallmark Hall of Fame)
