The fight scenes are awesome, as Gail tries to kill the girl and the Hero tries to save her.  Even the police suffer the wrath of the evil Gail but some how our hero survives. until the end......Maybe.  A must see for action junkies.

They wanted to make a movie that had a lot of twists, but they did it wrong. They first have to establish a good base storyline and then throw in twists and clue slowly throughout the movie. But, when the twists started happing the movie was over.Another thing with story was that they continued the movie, but the main storyline was finished. Now it doesn't make sense because there's nothing to talk about or show to the viewer. The viewer is left wondering, what's going on? Why isn't the movie over with?
