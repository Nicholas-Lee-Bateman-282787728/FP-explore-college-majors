There is one &#34;classic&#34; and that is Anna Karennina and the movie is not that good.  This set comes in two disks.  My advice is keep[ disk one and throw disk two away without wasting any time on it.  Four of these movies are good to very good, but the other four are of poor quality in recording or maybe I just can't understand British accents.For the price it is not bad for four movies.  If you bought them separately you would probably pay double the amount.  If I rated the four I didn't like I would rate them with one star out of pity.  The four I did like deserve four stars.  Who knows maybe you will think this collection deserves five stars as so many others have thought.  Many reviewers have written how wonderful Katherine Hepburn is.

I've longed to see the film again for years.Don't ask me what made me search for the film again, but there it was in a reasonably priced collection of British classics. I snapped it up in a heartbeat and good thing I did since it's temporarily sold out now.So, what's the story?  Katharine Hepburn plays Jessica Medlicott, a wealthy English actress who is accused of slighting a lover. She hires Sir Arthur Granville - Jones (Sir Laurence Olivier) as her barrister. Arthur's a man who knows well the sting of losing Jessica's affections, because he's been in the same situation. And, he's loved Jessica for years.Jessica realizes she has to do something desperate to win the case.....Despite being a made-for-television film, ""Love Among the Ruins"" is beautifully filmed, beautifully acted, and costumed.

Each DVD9 disc holds four movies, so yes they're compressed to about half the filesize they should be. Adjust your expectations accordingly, especially if viewing on a high definition television, but the picture quality definitely isn't as bad as you'd expect having previewed all of the films and watched two of them so far in full. Many seem to be sourced from direct film-to-digital transfers, although The Inheritance, Love Among The Ruins, and Anna Karenina seem to be sourced from videotape masters. This is one of the better public domain copies of Anna Karenina you'll find - the print used seems to have fewer issues than most, but still doesn't compare to what I've seen of the official DVD from Fox.The main draw for many to this set will be the US DVD debut of Love Among The Ruins, a 1975 ABC movie directed by George Cukor and featuring the only screen pairing of lifelong friends Katharine Hepburn and Laurence Olivier - all three won Emmys for their work. The disc featuring that film, plus St. Ives, Anna Karenina, and The Inheritance is also available separately, and Love Among The Ruins and Anna Karenina are also available in an 8-DVD 36-film set from Echo Bridge called Hollywood Greats. Out of print on VHS and laserdisc for years, not seen on TV in decades, and only released to DVD outside the US, it's nice to not only have it on DVD, but in nicely-priced sets that give you 3, 7, or 35 other films. (Try to find the Hollywood Greats set on sale for less than the $22.49 Amazon's asking - most of those films will be public domain copies, and I find $22.49 to be a bit much to pay for 36 public domain films when one can often buy Mill Creek's 50-movie sets for $10-$15.)There are no subtitles, chapter menus only exist on one disc and just list them with generic names, although all 8 movies do have chapter stops approximately every 10 minutes. For the disc with Love Among The Ruins, you have to navigate to each movie's menu by clicking &#34;Next&#34; or &#34;Previous,&#34; while the other disc simply has all four movie covers on one single menu. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0. Three movies are in their original 4:3 release aspect ratio, one movie inexplicably is in roughly 16:9, but letterboxed within a 4:3 frame, and the other 4 are anamorphic widescreen. Bonus features are non-existent, which is fine considering how compressed the discs are to begin with and how little you're paying for 8 movies.So far I have watched Love Among The Ruins and Anna Karenina, and enjoyed both immensely. (Although I wouldn't place Anna Karenina above either of Greta Garbo's film adaptations, it was nice to see Vivien Leigh looking lovely and giving a great performance in the title role.) That alone makes it worth the $5.70 I paid for this disc. Would I have liked for them to have used 4 DVD9 discs with 2 movies on each one? Yes. Or even 2 flipper discs with each side being a DVD9. For a while, Mill Creek seemed to do many of their licensed titles from big Hollywood studios that way - only one movie per DVD5 or two movies per DVD9, although that still sometimes required compression, but it seems they've gone back to their original model of squeezing 2 films on a DVD5 or 4 films on a DVD9. Would I like subtitles? Yes. But I knew I wasn't going to get any of that when I purchased this set. For what it is, it's a nice set, and I'm looking forward to watching a few more of these films and hoping they're enjoyable enough that I've really gotten my money's worth.And on a superficial note, I really like the cover art on this release, and the quality of the printing. Echo Bridge has put out a lot of DVD's with covers that look like someone made them in PowerPoint and printed them off on a crappy printer. This DVD cover looks very classy and simply-but-elegantly designed, and the quality of the printing, at least on my copy, looks like it was printed at an actual DVD company and not someone's basement. Plus it's nice to have Katharine Hepburn be the star of the front cover, just as she was in real life.",3,"Not a perfect set, but not a bad buy for $5-$7.",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,4643,"['Not', 'going', 'go', 'details', 'film', 'plot', 'such', 'many', 'are', 'probably', 'here', 'maybe', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'titles', 'already', 'know', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'top', 'banner', '34', 'Miramax', '34', 'only', 'four', 'films', 'actually', 'came', 'Miramax', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'St.', 'Ives', 'only', 'such', 'film', 'disc', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'ThingsRowing', 'WindRogue', 'TraderThe', 'others', 'come', 'respective', 'US', 'rights', 'holders', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'public', 'domain.The', 'set', '2-DVD', 'amaray', 'case', 'two', 'discs', 'one', 'also', 'available', 'own', 'DVD9', 'disc', 'four', 'movies', 'so', 'yes', ""'re"", 'compressed', 'filesize', 'should', 'be', 'Adjust', 'expectations', 'accordingly', 'especially', 'viewing', 'high', 'definition', 'television', 'picture', 'quality', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', ""'d"", 'expect', 'having', 'previewed', 'films', 'watched', 'two', 'so', 'far', 'full', 'Many', 'seem', 'be', 'sourced', 'direct', 'film-to-digital', 'transfers', 'Inheritance', 'Love', 'Ruins', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'seem', 'be', 'sourced', 'videotape', 'masters', 'one', 'better', 'public', 'domain', 'copies', 'Anna', 'Karenina', ""'ll"", 'find', 'print', 'used', 'have', 'fewer', 'issues', 'most', 'still', ""n't"", 'compare', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'official', 'DVD', 'Fox.The', 'main', 'draw', 'many', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'US', 'DVD', 'debut', 'Love', 'Ruins', '1975', 'ABC', 'movie', 'directed', 'George', 'Cukor', 'featuring', 'only', 'screen', 'pairing', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'three', 'won', 'Emmys', 'work', 'disc', 'featuring', 'film', 'St.', 'Ives', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Inheritance', 'also', 'available', 'separately', 'Love', 'Ruins', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'are', 'also', 'available', '8-DVD', '36-film', 'set', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'called', 'Hollywood', 'Greats', 'Out', 'print', 'VHS', 'laserdisc', 'years', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'decades', 'only', 'released', 'DVD', 'US', 'nice', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'DVD', 'nicely-priced', 'sets', 'give', '3', '7', '35', 'other', 'films', 'Try', 'find', 'Hollywood', 'Greats', 'set', 'sale', 'less', '22.49', 'Amazon', 'asking', 'most', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'public', 'domain', 'copies', 'find', '22.49', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'pay', '36', 'public', 'domain', 'films', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'often', 'buy', 'Mill', 'Creek', '50-movie', 'sets', '10-', '15', 'are', 'subtitles', 'chapter', 'menus', 'only', 'exist', 'one', 'disc', 'just', 'list', 'generic', 'names', '8', 'movies', 'do', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'approximately', '10', 'minutes', 'disc', 'Love', 'Ruins', 'have', 'navigate', 'movie', 'menu', 'clicking', '34', 'Next', '34', '34', 'Previous', '34', 'other', 'disc', 'simply', 'four', 'movie', 'one', 'single', 'menu', 'Audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Three', 'movies', 'are', 'original', '4:3', 'release', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'one', 'movie', 'inexplicably', 'roughly', '16:9', 'letterboxed', '4:3', 'frame', 'other', '4', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'non-existent', 'fine', 'considering', 'how', 'compressed', 'discs', 'are', 'begin', 'how', 'little', ""'re"", 'paying', '8', 'movies.So', 'far', 'have', 'watched', 'Love', 'Ruins', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'would', ""n't"", 'place', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'film', 'adaptations', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'looking', 'lovely', 'giving', 'great', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'alone', '5.70', 'paid', 'disc', 'Would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'used', '4', 'DVD9', 'discs', '2', 'movies', 'one', 'Yes', 'even', '2', 'flipper', 'discs', 'side', 'being', 'DVD9', 'while', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'seemed', 'do', 'many', 'licensed', 'titles', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'way', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'DVD5', 'two', 'movies', 'DVD9', 'still', 'sometimes', 'required', 'compression', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'back', 'original', 'model', 'squeezing', '2', 'films', 'DVD5', '4', 'films', 'DVD9', 'Would', 'subtitles', 'Yes', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'when', 'purchased', 'set', 'what', 'nice', 'set', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'hoping', ""'re"", 'enjoyable', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'really', 'gotten', 'money', 'worth.And', 'superficial', 'note', 'really', 'cover', 'art', 'release', 'quality', 'printing', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'put', 'out', 'lot', 'DVD', 'covers', 'look', 'someone', 'made', 'PowerPoint', 'printed', 'off', 'crappy', 'printer', 'DVD', 'cover', 'very', 'classy', 'simply-but-elegantly', 'designed', 'quality', 'printing', 'least', 'copy', 'was', 'printed', 'actual', 'DVD', 'company', 'not', 'someone', 'basement', 'nice', 'have', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'be', 'star', 'front', 'cover', 'just', 'was', 'real', 'life']",N/A
