These whodunits may lack to some extent the panache of Nick and Nora Charles which was cultivated through the series, these as stand alone films do not fail to entertain as they reflect good screen pairings.With the exception of Fast and Loose, I had not seen the other films. If you like slick detective films from the  '30's with decent production values, this set will not disappoint. They move quickly, are fun, and the casting works.",4,A Fast Set Of Whodunits That Work,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,564,"['received', 'gift', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'films', 'were', 'vein', 'classic', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'whodunits', 'may', 'lack', 'extent', 'panache', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'was', 'cultivated', 'series', 'stand', 'alone', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'entertain', 'reflect', 'good', 'screen', 'pairings.With', 'exception', 'Fast', 'Loose', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'like', 'slick', 'detective', 'films', ""'30"", 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'move', 'quickly', 'are', 'fun', 'casting']",Fast Company/Fast and Loose/Fast and Furious-Triple Feature

In Douglas and Montgomery, however, we see the light touch that these first generation &#34;talkie&#34; actors could bring to a film, despite their ability to enrich the most serious of dramas. Enough of semi-serious discussion, these were made purely for fun; in that aim, the first two are quite successful, the third worth the time to see. It is good to have these back in circulation, with their mix of familiar 1930's character actors backing studio 'A' players. Why reviewers see a need to compare these with The Thin Man, aside from their being in the same sub-genre, I don't know. Before that classic film, the 'light comedy amateur detective' movie, was already well established, allowing the later actors, including Powell, to draw on their own as well as other's earlier works. In each of these, the part of the wife is subordinated to that of the husband, but is an essential element in the comedic success of  the film. In this case, the least well known at that time, Florence Rice (mated to Douglas) fulfills  her function admirably. None of these was unfamiliar to me but none disappointed in providing a most pleasant experience. The triple-header is to be highly recommended",5,Three Funny Mysteries from the late 30's,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1415,"['Franchot', 'Tone', 'never', 'made', 'Big', 'Leagues', 'did', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'still', 'good', 'job', 'least', 'adept', 'mini-series', 'use', 'term', 'still-to-come', 'television', 'world', 'Douglas', 'Montgomery', 'however', 'see', 'light', 'touch', 'first', 'generation', '34', 'talkie', '34', 'actors', 'could', 'bring', 'film', 'ability', 'enrich', 'most', 'serious', 'dramas', 'Enough', 'semi-serious', 'discussion', 'were', 'made', 'purely', 'fun', 'aim', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'quite', 'successful', 'third', 'time', 'see', 'good', 'have', 'back', 'circulation', 'mix', 'familiar', '1930', 'character', 'actors', 'backing', 'studio', 'A', 'players', 'Why', 'reviewers', 'see', 'need', 'compare', 'Thin', 'Man', 'aside', 'being', 'same', 'sub-genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'classic', 'film', ""'light"", 'comedy', 'amateur', 'detective', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'established', 'allowing', 'later', 'actors', 'including', 'Powell', 'draw', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'earlier', 'works', 'part', 'wife', 'subordinated', 'husband', 'essential', 'element', 'comedic', 'success', 'film', 'case', 'least', 'well', 'known', 'time', 'Florence', 'Rice', 'mated', 'Douglas', 'function', 'admirably', 'None', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'none', 'disappointed', 'providing', 'most', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'triple-header', 'be', 'highly', 'recommended']",Fast Company/Fast and Loose/Fast and Furious-Triple Feature

1646051,A3ICVJQMZAGQV5,B00CDV4LEA,wisdomstar,"[8, 8]","This DVD contains three movies with different actors playing the same characters. FAST COMPANY stars Melvyn Douglas and Florence Rice in a decent mystery with George Zucco as one of the bad guys. The rare book dealer world is the setting and makes for an interesting change. FAST AND LOOSE stars Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell and almost hits the gold  standard of the Thin Man mystery. Montgomery and Russell do a good job of the expected banter back and forth. A rare manuscript is missing and a mansion full of suspects are running around in the middle of the night. This is the best of the three from this mystery buff's point of view and the reason why I am keeping this dvd. FAST AND FURIOUS stars Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern and throws a young Mary Beth Hughes in as a bathing beauty. Yes, I did say bathing beauty - we have left the world of books for a beauty contest in 'Seaside City'. Busby Berkley directs - good heavens, how the mighty are fallen. This is one of those movies where people are dying but you just can't take any of it seriously. And I haven't even mentioned the lions. If you are fan of 30's mysteries, you will probably enjoy owning this set.",5,two out of three ain't bad,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,1181,"['DVD', 'three', 'movies', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'same', 'characters', 'FAST', 'COMPANY', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Florence', 'Rice', 'decent', 'mystery', 'George', 'Zucco', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'rare', 'book', 'dealer', 'world', 'setting', 'interesting', 'change', 'FAST', 'LOOSE', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'almost', 'gold', 'standard', 'Thin', 'Man', 'mystery', 'Montgomery', 'Russell', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'expected', 'banter', 'back', 'forth', 'rare', 'manuscript', 'missing', 'mansion', 'full', 'suspects', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'middle', 'night', 'best', 'three', 'mystery', 'buff', 'point', 'view', 'reason', 'why', 'am', 'keeping', 'dvd', 'FAST', 'AND', 'FURIOUS', 'stars', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'young', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hughes', 'bathing', 'beauty', 'Yes', 'did', 'say', 'bathing', 'beauty', 'have', 'left', 'world', 'books', 'beauty', 'contest', ""'Seaside"", 'City', 'Busby', 'Berkley', 'good', 'heavens', 'how', 'mighty', 'are', 'fallen', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'lions', 'are', 'fan', '30', 'mysteries', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'owning', 'set']",Fast Company/Fast and Loose/Fast and Furious-Triple Feature
