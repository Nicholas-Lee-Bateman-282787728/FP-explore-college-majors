This, to those of you, is the latter. Mr Magoo, a retired idea from a retired cartoon, that neither should have made it past phase one. After you laugh at one thing (As Ebert said about Money Pit) you have nothing more to laugh at. The jokes are neither funny nor inspiring. New material is essential to the survival of a comedy. Unless, that is, you enjoy redundancy. Leslie Nielson, is one of my favorite comedians, (With the exception of the unnecessary Wrongfully accused, in which I laughed twice) and I have to say he was the best for the job. But, how unfortunate for him, that the material was plucked from an animated floozy.

There also was the inevitable spoof of the competition between the CIA and the FBI, and the movie also managed to parody the international intrigue of many movies. If we were going to identify a heroic character, it would have to be Angus the bulldog, and at times it appeared that Angus was the only character with a lick of sense. Then the scene where Mr. Magoo goes down a ski slope on the backside of an ironing board was hilarious. All in all, those who liked Mr. Magoo cartoons, would find this an entertaining movie.Roy M.

He was watching a 'cooking' program when it was changed to an 'aerobics' program and next to a 'carpentary' program. Mr. Magoo as usual being visually impaired, went through all the 'rituals' with his chicken. It was hilarious! Get this movie and laugh your way through with Mr. Magoo from the beginning when the jewel was stolen to the end when he restored it to its rightful place, all the while not realizing the dangers he was in.
