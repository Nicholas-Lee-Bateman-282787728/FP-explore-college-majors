Mike the Knight want to be a true Knight like his father but in his quest to be a knight he forgets to think about how his behavior may be hurting others.  Fortunatley, Mike the Knight always learns from his mistakes and corrects his bad behavior.  This DVD teaches children to think about how their actions and behaviors can affect other people.",5,Mike the Knight in Training,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,475,"['children', 'love', 'DVD', 'love', 'lessons', 'Knight', 'Training', 'five', 'stories', 'one', 'DVD', 'Knight', 'want', 'be', 'true', 'Knight', 'father', 'quest', 'be', 'knight', 'think', 'how', 'behavior', 'may', 'be', 'hurting', 'others', 'Fortunatley', 'Mike', 'Knight', 'always', 'mistakes', 'bad', 'behavior', 'DVD', 'children', 'think', 'how', 'actions', 'behaviors', 'can', 'affect', 'other', 'people']",Mike the Knight: Knight in Training

We received the new Mike the Knight DVD last week- and my Daughter has fallen in LOVE with this series. Mom and Dad MAY be a little tired of hearing ""I want watch Mike the Knight"" in our house ;-) It is the movie she picks when it is ""movie time"" EVERY time! We do love the stories- and they teach great things to my little miss! From sharing with friends, to being a good neighbor, and working together- these stories teach classic life lessons in a fun and engaging way! She loves to quote Mike when he says ""It's time to be a knight and do it right""- it is absolutely adorable.

1624048,AOURF2C6EWZNS,B00BB8LRUW,Jennifer,"[6, 6]","As an NCircle NSider I got a copy of Mike The Knight  - Knight In Training DVD to review.  This DVD runs 56 minutes and has 5 episodes; Scary Dragons, Evie's Birthday Present,  Fluttering Favor, Trollee's Sleepover  and Mission Home. There are a few bonus features; Glendragon Matching Game, Meeting Mike's Friends and Mike The Knight Theme Song.For those of you who have never seen the show I'll give you a quick rundown. Mike is a young boy who is a knight in training; he wants to be a great knight just like his father. So in every episode he takes on a task, usually at first he doesn't get it right. But with the help from his sister Evie, who is doing some training of her own to become a wizard, and his two best friends... who just happen to be dragons, he finally gets it right. He has a cute motto of ""Be A Knight And Do It Right"".Each episode is not only entertaining but they all teach some good life lessons. The characters are lovable and vivid. Now even though the show is set in Medieval Times there is no violence involved. When Mike draws his sword he doesn't get a sword, thanks to one of Evie's spells going wrong. There is no slaying of dragons or hunting trolls and witches or anything like that. So you don't have to worry about your little one going after the cat or dog to slay it. Nor do you have to worry about it encouraging any hitting.  Right now my son is going through a Mine Phase and I love that Mike shares and works well with others.I can't even begin to tell you how many times we have watched the DVD now.  We watched it as soon it arrived and even the week when we were away it was one of the movies that just had to go with us. My son (he will be 2 in July)  really enjoys watching it. The show is cute and easy to follow; I'd say it's great for little kids up till about 5 or 6 years old.  We can't wait for another DVD to come, would be great if it was the whole first season... hint hint NCircle.",5,Mike Does It Right,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1940,"['NCircle', 'NSider', 'got', 'copy', 'Mike', 'Knight', 'Knight', 'Training', 'DVD', 'review', 'DVD', '56', 'minutes', '5', 'episodes', 'Scary', 'Dragons', 'Evie', 'Birthday', 'Present', 'Fluttering', 'Favor', 'Trollee', 'Sleepover', 'Mission', 'Home', 'are', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'Glendragon', 'Matching', 'Game', 'Meeting', 'Mike', 'Friends', 'Mike', 'Knight', 'Theme', 'Song.For', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'rundown', 'Mike', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'knight', 'training', 'be', 'great', 'knight', 'just', 'father', 'So', 'episode', 'task', 'usually', 'first', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'help', 'sister', 'Evie', 'who', 'doing', 'training', 'own', 'become', 'wizard', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'dragons', 'finally', 'right', 'cute', 'motto', 'Be', 'Knight', 'Do', 'Right', '.Each', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'teach', 'good', 'life', 'lessons', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable', 'vivid', 'Now', 'even', 'show', 'set', 'Medieval', 'Times', 'violence', 'involved', 'When', 'Mike', 'sword', ""n't"", 'get', 'sword', 'thanks', 'one', 'Evie', 'spells', 'going', 'wrong', 'slaying', 'dragons', 'hunting', 'trolls', 'witches', 'anything', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'little', 'one', 'going', 'cat', 'dog', 'slay', 'do', 'have', 'worry', 'encouraging', 'hitting', 'Right', 'now', 'son', 'going', 'Mine', 'Phase', 'love', 'Mike', 'shares', 'well', 'others.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'now', 'watched', 'soon', 'arrived', 'even', 'week', 'when', 'were', 'away', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'had', 'go', 'son', 'will', 'be', '2', 'July', 'really', 'watching', 'show', 'cute', 'easy', 'follow', ""'d"", 'say', 'great', 'little', 'kids', 'up', 'till', '5', '6', 'years', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'come', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'was', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'hint', 'hint', 'NCircle']",Mike the Knight: Knight in Training

There were five stories in all, each with a different message.  Before I let you know how happy we were with the storie I have to tell you that the short commercial in the beginning for the Mike the Night Toy castle was well placed, props to your marketing department because now that castle tops the Christmas/Birthday list for my son.My kids had two stand outs on this DVD, the first being ""Scary Dragons"".  Mike learns about responsibility and my kids really enjoyed the interactions with Mikes dragon friends because they are really a funny pair and not as scary as they should be.The other story that they loved was ""Fluttering Favour"" where Mikes mom explains that if Mike and Evie do a good deed they can win a favour (a handkerchief).  The two go out and try to do good deeds but because they work against each other they wind up making a mess of things.  It isn't until they learn to work as a team that they are able to succeed.  I love that lesson!I would recommend this DVD to everyone with kids, girls will like it to, the show has plenty of positive female characters.

His infamous statement is ""I'm Mike the Knight and my mission is to do it right."" Welllll things don't always go so right for Mike!

They loved the Trollee's Sleepover episode because that is something they have just recently started experiencing.Kids love the characters and stories and moms love the lessons that are always being taught on every episode.
