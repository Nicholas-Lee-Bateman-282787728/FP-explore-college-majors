1624360,A3GKZ44Q9GO8QZ,B00BC0WQWM,"Colleen Whalen ""Tiger Lilly""","[0, 0]","I saw the play live when it Christopher Plummer was touring nationwide in the 1990's.  As a regular theatre goer, this was among the very best plays I have seen in my life.  The DVD version is expanded and there are many extra elements compared to the stage performance.  However, the filmed version still sticks to the text of the stage play.  The special features are excellent.  There is a long documentary about the making of the film.  Great interviews with many actors who worked with Christopher Plummer.  A very long interview with Christopher Plummer rounds out the special features section.Combination of comedy, tragedy - the film takes place at the end of Barrymore's life.  He was phenomenally talented but was a massive alcoholic, skirt chaser and all around libertine, bon vivant.  I don't think there was a mean bone in Barrymore's body, but the world was his oyster and he used the wrong fork!  Brilliant, charming, mercurial, self-destructive, ribald - the sort of &#34;Bad Boy&#34; that you love - but he throws his life into the gutter.Due to decades of horrendous alcoholism, Barrymore cannot remember his lines.  Everyone in Hollywood thought he was washed up.  The play takes place over a few hours in the life of Barrymore when he rents a theatre stage for an evening trying to rehearse his lines.  He winds up doing a ,monologue of his life story - there are some utterly HILARIOUS sections and at other times it made me tear up because the pathos of Barrymore's self destructive behavior was so sad.It is a one man show - with only one other actor - you don't see the other actor - his dialogue is all off screen.  He plays a guy Barrymore hired to run lines with - practicing his performances in the hopes of a comeback..P.S.  There is some cursing and bad language - fine for adults - but parents should figure out if they want the kiddies to hear the bawdy bits.....wickedly funny - nothing too shocking - but not advisable for grammar school kiddies.",5,Brilliant Performance by Christopher Plummer,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1980,"['saw', 'play', 'live', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'was', 'touring', 'nationwide', '1990', 'regular', 'theatre', 'goer', 'was', 'very', 'best', 'plays', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'DVD', 'version', 'expanded', 'are', 'many', 'extra', 'elements', 'compared', 'stage', 'performance', 'However', 'filmed', 'version', 'still', 'text', 'stage', 'play', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'long', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'Great', 'interviews', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'very', 'long', 'interview', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'section.Combination', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'film', 'place', 'end', 'Barrymore', 'life', 'was', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'was', 'massive', 'alcoholic', 'skirt', 'chaser', 'around', 'libertine', 'bon', 'vivant', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'mean', 'bone', 'Barrymore', 'body', 'world', 'was', 'oyster', 'used', 'wrong', 'fork', 'Brilliant', 'charming', 'mercurial', 'self-destructive', 'ribald', 'sort', '34', 'Bad', 'Boy', '34', 'love', 'life', 'gutter.Due', 'decades', 'horrendous', 'alcoholism', 'Barrymore', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'lines', 'Everyone', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'was', 'washed', 'up', 'play', 'place', 'few', 'hours', 'life', 'Barrymore', 'when', 'theatre', 'stage', 'evening', 'trying', 'rehearse', 'lines', 'up', 'doing', 'monologue', 'life', 'story', 'are', 'utterly', 'HILARIOUS', 'sections', 'other', 'times', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'pathos', 'Barrymore', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'was', 'so', 'sad.It', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'actor', 'dialogue', 'off', 'screen', 'guy', 'Barrymore', 'hired', 'run', 'lines', 'practicing', 'performances', 'hopes', 'comeback..P.S', 'cursing', 'bad', 'language', 'fine', 'adults', 'parents', 'should', 'figure', 'out', 'want', 'kiddies', 'hear', 'bawdy', 'bits', '..wickedly', 'funny', 'nothing', 'too', 'shocking', 'not', 'advisable', 'grammar', 'school', 'kiddies']",N/A

Trew ""chekist""","[0, 0]","This is a wonderful mixture of stage and film as Christopher Plummer recreates his successful stage role as tragic stage and film legend John Barrymore. It's 1942 and Barrymore is a washed up alcoholic actor trying to make a comeback, He rents a small theater for a night to practice his famous Shakespearian roles. He is alone except for a prompt assistant that appears only in voice and shadow. Plummer's acting is really spot on for Barrymore and this is a great performance. He is at once funny and tragic and has a great state presence. I also liked the way it's mainly a stage show with some occasional visual forays utilizing the camera's unique capabilities. For instance, there is an audience watching this film being made but at certain sequences when they want to emphasize Barrymore's isolation and loneliness the audience vanishes. There is also an interesting sequence or two where Barrymore fantasizes and we can see the visuals he is having.

Braginsky ""suttca""","[7, 7]","I remember leaving a one woman show of my dear friend Ms. Julie Harris and complaining that the Playbill was dreadful as it did not list the Cast! I had been entranced as Julie WAS the cast. It is nearly impossible to do a one person show. Even more difficult for it to be a work of genius. Peter O'Toole did it in ""Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell"" and Julie Harris has done it twice. Christopher Plummer, an actor that Jason Robards Jr. loved to tease and call ""the pompous Canadian"", has reached for the stars in ""Barrymore"" and succeeded in grabbing all of them. John Barrymore was America's greatest actor. Christopher Plummer plays him as perfectly as could be played. Once in a generation we have a playwright and actor come together on Broadway for a non-musical, and create perfection.""Barrymore"" is perfection and be sure you buy an extra copy in case one breaks.Plummer, now well into his 80's has the look and physicality of a man 2 decades younger. He has truly come into his own in the last decade with pieces like ""Beginners"", ""The girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and especially ""Barrymore"". Errol Flynn idolized Barrymore as a youngster, had Barrymore living with him as a film icon, and played him in ""Too Much, Too Soon"". They were Flynn''s greatest reviews. One should own Barrymore's greatest films such as ""20th Century"" and ""Grand Hotel"", as well as Errol Flynn's portrayal.

There has to be an outstanding script - and an actor or actress that delivers the lines like an electric current. For most of this piece, well,  Christopher Plummer pulls it off.The time is 1942. John Barrymore is a hopeless alcoholic literally on his last legs. His mind is a swamp of lost and confused memories. But (as he says) he needs to be taken seriously so he arranges to play Shakespeare's Richard III,  a role he once made famous.  As Barrymore, when Plummer recites the Bard with feeling, he is darn effective.  Then he lapses into an alcoholic reverie that offers less rewards. What we experience, and experience is the word, is a glimpse of a great man sinking into wretchedness.  Lines of Shakespeare and episodes of Barrymore's life are pieced together the way a drunk stumbles down a street.  But I felt that Plummer captured some of Barrymore's greatness. He makes you believe he could have been the actor at the end of his career.By the end of the play, the audience does take the man seriously. The overwhelming sentiment is ""what a shame"" that Barrymore did so much voluntary damage to himself.In summary, the movie needs no special effects because it depends on the magic of a great actor by himself alone.",4,"Barrymore - ""I Need To Be Taken Seriously""",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1267,"['One', 'person', 'drama', 'very', 'tricky', 'stuff', 'be', 'outstanding', 'script', 'actor', 'actress', 'lines', 'electric', 'current', 'most', 'piece', 'well', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'off.The', 'time', '1942', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'hopeless', 'alcoholic', 'literally', 'last', 'legs', 'mind', 'swamp', 'lost', 'confused', 'memories', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'play', 'Shakespeare', 'Richard', 'III', 'role', 'once', 'made', 'famous', 'Barrymore', 'when', 'Plummer', 'Bard', 'feeling', 'darn', 'effective', 'Then', 'alcoholic', 'reverie', 'less', 'rewards', 'What', 'experience', 'experience', 'word', 'glimpse', 'great', 'man', 'sinking', 'wretchedness', 'Lines', 'Shakespeare', 'episodes', 'Barrymore', 'life', 'are', 'pieced', 'together', 'way', 'drunk', 'down', 'street', 'felt', 'Plummer', 'captured', 'Barrymore', 'greatness', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actor', 'end', 'career.By', 'end', 'play', 'audience', 'take', 'man', 'seriously', 'overwhelming', 'sentiment', 'what', 'shame', 'Barrymore', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'voluntary', 'damage', 'himself.In', 'summary', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'magic', 'great', 'actor', 'alone']",N/A
1624366,A2JAAUES5NXG4Z,B00BC0WQWM,Glen Boisseau Becker,"[0, 7]","What do John Barrymore and Christopher Plummer have in common? Each of them appeared in a handful of notable Shakespearean roles, receiving more praise than some of the more demanding critics felt he deserved. In his day, either one could be uncharitably described as a self-centered ham. And both had a certain fondness for drinking, preferably in the company of beautiful women. The similarities end there.Recruiting Plummer to ""play"" the legendary Barrymore makes about as much sense as hiring Jerry Seinfeld to appear in a serious drama as Jesus. (Or if that sounds like a good idea, let's try Homer Simpson as Macbeth.) Never mind that gray-haired Plummer is more than 20 years too old for the role; he doesn't look anything like Barrymore, he doesn't SOUND like Barrymore, and the script is pure fiction. And, as we used to say at Yale School of Drama, the man can't act his way out of a paper bag.Few remember the real Barrymore on stage, but we know his formidable gifts from his radio broadcasts of six Shakespeare plays, augmented by a string of movies (including scenes from RICHARD III, HAMLET, and ROMEO AND JULIET along the way), plus a couple of other audio recordings, photographs and prompt books, and the descriptions of his contemporaries. What other American could win over the British with an electrifying HAMLET? He may not have remembered his lines perfectly, but throughout most of his career his interpretations were aflame with life--wild, passionate, frightening, heartbreaking--as we can see in movies like THE BELOVED ROGUE, TEMPEST (no relation to Shakespeare), and SVENGALI.In his prime, it seemed Barrymore could do anything. As he was both the noble Hamlet and the diabolical Richard on stage, he was both Jekyll and Hyde on the screen. And surely no other actor in history gave the world equally riveting performances in both polar-opposite fields: silent films (where audiences had to imagine his voice) and radio (where audiences had to imagine everything else). Late in life, Barrymore was still sufficiently versatile to play two contrasting roles in the broadcast version of HAMLET, and again even more brilliantly in TWELFTH NIGHT. Many listeners didn't even catch on to the trick. His name is a household word for a reason: No one else could equal his power and charisma.By contrast, I've watched Plummer ineptly strut his way through four live productions, as well as countless appearances on movie and television screens. He doesn't stimulate my finer emotions; he insults my intelligence and exhausts my patience. On paper, his pedigree seems more than ample. Somehow I live in hope that he will vindicate himself with his next performance, yet seeing this octogenarian ""Barrymore"" brings to mind the words Nathan Lane impertinently ad-libbed to magician Doug Henning during the final performance of the musical comedy MERLIN: ""Don't start trying to act NOW!""Yes, with the debatable exception of his KING LEAR, I have yet to see this actor alter his self-satisfied Plummy personality in the slightest, except to overlay a script with incongruous bellows and gimmicks. (Just one case in point from OTHELLO: Why should Iago, confiding his darkest secret to Roderigo, be shouting his head off--""I! HATE! THE MOOR!""--reckless of the fact that a crowd of senators have only just now left the room?)Here in BARRYMORE, Plummer makes a half-hearted attempt to duplicate Barrymore's reverberating Richard, only to shatter the evil effect with a terribly unspontaneous-sounding laugh right in the middle of the elongated word ""I'LL"" (""Can I do this, and cannot get a crown? / Tut, were it further off I'll pluck it down""). Where Barrymore shook the earth with the violence of his vibrato, Plummer awkwardly exaggerates, distorts, and only succeeds in grating on our nerves.The rest of the film seems to be a hybrid of voyeuristic sensationalism and a modern player's ego trip. Wouldn't there be ample drama in the story of Barrymore's not-altogether-inglorious return to RICHARD III for radio in 1937? Must we focus on the concept of imaginary plans for an obviously doomed stage revival five years later, when Barrymore was dying and the resurgence of popular interest in Shakespeare had passed its crest, thanks to certain eruptions beyond our nation's borders?In fact, what reason does this BARRYMORE script have for being, except to show that Plummer is capable of playing out the tragedy of a man torn between inner genius and a vulgar flair for self-destruction? The trouble is, I don't see any genius. Watching Christopher Plummer put on a miserable face is a poor compensation.So today, I'm breaking two cherished rules. I never turn off a movie before the closing credits have ceased to roll. And I certainly wouldn't presume to pass judgment on a film I haven't seen all the way through. In the case of BARRYMORE, however, a few minutes is more than enough. This is trash. This is a desecration. This is an attempt to part fools from their money with a manipulative and thoroughly unflattering caricature of an actor who truly was larger than life. Don't settle for cheap imitations: seek out the legacy of the real John Barrymore.",1,Life is too short to be wasted on this twaddle,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,5175,"['What', 'do', 'John',

It is a well-modulated script - the bird upon which Plummer's genius soars.  His performance is pitch perfect. He holds the stage with the energy and panache of a much younger man.  The play allows him to run the entire gamut of emotions from heartbreaking sadness to high-flying happiness.  I was spellbound for the entire 90 and some minutes.  This is yet one more fine performance from an actor who has made a career of giving fine performances, whether in ""Hamlet"" or the more recent ""King Lear"" and ""The Tempest"".

1624371,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B00BC0WQWM,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[6, 6]","This film captures one of the great pieces of theater in the last 20 years. Christopher Plummer plays John Barrymore in the twilight of his career trying to make a comeback and looking back wrapped into echos of Richard III at Bosworth Field. Its a one person show. Or maybe a one and a half person show. In any case, its a very difficult thing for anyone to pull off but Plummer does it. They use the device of a person offstage to give Plummer something mostly inert to play off of.Plummer also avoids the trap of these sort of shows in that he makes the character his own. Its more than imitation or recreation. I think his literal age at the point of this performance even better captures Barrymore's premature physical decay. They also keep very true to the play but manage to avoiding making it seem static or seem like filmed theater. Of course the script itself, given that the action is on stage, makes it easier. The director talks about using Camera movement to accomplish similiar effects to those accomplished with lighting in a live performance. I can't remember a play that was shot better than this one.The extras are interesting as well. Most of the creative people involved are heard from from writer to director to the lighting effects. Its also in some measure a reunion and retrospective from those originally involved in the production. There are also interviews with Julie Andrews and Helen Mirran.",5,really great work,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,1421,"['film', 'one', 'great', 'pieces', 'theater', 'last', '20', 'years', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'twilight', 'career', 'trying', 'make', 'comeback', 'looking', 'back', 'wrapped', 'echos', 'Richard', 'III', 'Bosworth', 'Field', 'one', 'person', 'show', 'maybe', 'one', 'half', 'person', 'show', 'case', 'very', 'difficult', 'thing', 'anyone', 'pull', 'off', 'Plummer', 'use', 'device', 'person', 'offstage', 'give', 'Plummer', 'something', 'mostly', 'inert', 'play', 'off', 'of.Plummer', 'also', 'trap', 'sort', 'shows', 'character', 'own', 'more', 'imitation', 'recreation', 'think', 'literal', 'age', 'point', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'captures', 'Barrymore', 'premature', 'physical', 'decay', 'also', 'keep', 'very', 'true', 'play', 'manage', 'avoiding', 'making', 'seem', 'static', 'seem', 'filmed', 'theater', 'course', 'script', 'given', 'action', 'stage', 'easier', 'director', 'talks', 'using', 'Camera', 'movement', 'accomplish', 'similiar', 'effects', 'accomplished', 'lighting', 'live', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'play', 'was', 'shot', 'better', 'one.The', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'creative', 'people', 'involved', 'are', 'heard', 'writer', 'director', 'lighting', 'effects', 'also', 'measure', 'reunion', 'retrospective', 'originally', 'involved', 'production', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Helen', 'Mirran']",N/A

Mr. Luce is also the author of (among many other plays) 'The Belle Of Amherst' for which Julie Harris won a richly deserved Tony Award (as did Plummer for 'Barrymore') for her luminous portrayal of Emily Dickinson. And it's a pity that the writer of such superb material is often not given adequate -- or ANY -- credit for their marvelous craft, without which it is doubtful that those Tony awards would have been forthcoming. After all, no actor performs in a vacuum, without the benefit (or sometimes hindrance) of the play in which they are appearing. So here's a huge ""BRAVO"" to William Luce for his glorious WORDS! Take a bow, sir!An important addendum: Now that I have received the DVD I am delighted to report that it contains one of the finest behind-the-scenes ""making of"" documentaries I've ever seen, covering both the original Broadway stage production and the recent Toronto revivial and subsequent filming of it. All too often these kinds of bonus features are quickly cobbled together almost as an afterthought. However, this intimate backstage glimpse is so good it's worth the price of the DVD all by itself. And as it contains in-depth, insightful interviews with the entire production team -- yes, including the play's author William Luce who is very nicely represented -- it addresses all of my original concerns expressed above. Anyone who watches this glorious documentary will not only know full well who first created the play itself, but will get to know the other impressive talents who cumulatively pooled their skills to create the magical experience which is 'Barrymore'. And wonderful interviews with Helen Mirren, Zoe Caldwell and Julie Andrews are added icing to an already ultra-rich cake. Buy this DVD forthwith!",5,Author! Author!

First note that Amazon groups reviews of films by title rather than format so you will see reviews of both the DVD and the Bluray under either version.In 1997 Christopher Plummer starred in the Broadway version of ""Barrymore"" and won both a Tony and a Drama Desk Award. The play was directed by the great Gene Saks. 14 years later - in 2011- the producers of the stage play decided to film it as a film version in Toronto, Canada. They had the playwright make some changes and hired a new director. They also gave the only other actor in the film/play - the one who plays ""Frank, the off stage prompter"" - some new lines as well.Before the film was made the revised version was given 30 performances in from of a live audience in Toronto, to seek audience reaction.Though the filmed version takes place on the same stage, the lighting changes and the camera angles give the production extra life. Needless to say, Plummer is amazing in the 84-minute film.There is one ""Special Feature"". It is titled ""Backstage With Barrymore"" and, at 58 minutes, is nearly as long as the film. But it will give you a sense of the work that was involved in this production. In addition to those directly involved, we get interviews with Helen Mirren and two actresses who played opposite Plummer in other projects: Julie Andrews (""The Sound of Music"") and Zoe Caldwell (""Antony and Cleopatra"").Anyone interested in great acting will enjoy this and the home video release will give it a wider audience.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic.",5,Review of Bluray version.
