547737,A27BAJPXABYPBN,B00004R80T,"Bvet ""calgal33""","[1, 1]","This is one of the most unlikely Hugh Jackman movies ever. Jack Willis is a handsome roadtrain driver with a secret - he has just become a top-selling romance novelist. However, being a 'man's man' in the Australian outlook, to avoid embarrassment, he needs a name, a woman's name - and he chooses that of his best friend, Ruby Vale. He must do some fancy footwork to continue the charade when the glamorous city publisher, Ziggy, arrives in dusty outback Lucktown to sign 'Ruby Vale' to a major book deal. Ruby agrees to help Jack though it's for her own gain as well - the publisher will pay for her coming wedding (with Hamish, Jack's buddy). Accompanied by Jack, Ruby goes to Sydney to meet the media, appear on TV and cocktail parties, etc. Gradually, Jack realizes that he has fallen in love with Ruby, while Ruby is also touched by Jack's novel.I bought this on DVD from moviehunter dot tv.

It is a story about friendship, loving and being 'in love'.  There are many great scenes between Ruby and Jack, Ruby and Suze, Jack and Hammish, and Jack and Ziggy.

547740,A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ,B00004R80T,"John Baranyai ""Book Nerd And Ex High School G...","[1, 18]","In this movie we see Hugh Jackman who plays a ""truckie"" (long distance truck driver). He has a BIG secret, namely he has written a romance novel under the psuedonym of ""Ruby Vale"". Any Aussie Bloke (man) who could write a Romance Novel would soon come under the scrutiny of his ""mates (drinking buddies) and no doubt his sexuality would be questioned by them and he would no longer be a part of their ""shout ""(his turn to buy drinks). So he enlists the help of his friend Ruby to pretend to be the REAL writer of his book. Hugh's character is ""in love"" (whatever that means) with Ruby but he has a sexual encounter with her publisher. I realize that millions of guys throughout the world cannot resist the temptation of  a sexual invitation of any woman but that don't make it right as the man once said. So after he gives her what Austalians  so charmingly refer to as ""a good root"" (sexual encounter)he professes undying love to Ruby at which point I nearly spewed in disgust(i.e. vomited) at the immense ""Suspension Of Disbelief"" required to watch this movie.
