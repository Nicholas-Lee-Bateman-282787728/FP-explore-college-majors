Roy does some pretty damn good playing.My only complaints are 1) Too short and 2) I wish cameramen would quit taking shots of the audience while he's pulling off many of his signature licks.  However...luckily, this happens only a couple of times.  All in all, I think this is a pretty good representation of Roy live as we might get, although I've seen several pieces of footage on YOUTUBE that leads me to believe there might be more out there.

I'm sure many others must have as well because they have made it happen, and it is one of the oldest shows they have put out. This is a real gem to have been released! Great quality, great close ups, great sound! Great song selection considering how short it is too.  His playing is just incredible.  It's too bad they didn't have more footage but it's great to have what is here. (32 minutes)If you are a Buchanan fan I'm sure you have seen this footage in bootleg form but this is great quality!.

1144092,AT1ALF89PU5OP,B0013UL4DS,"M. Huber ""Michael  Huber""","[0, 1]","I really liked this DVD for it's look back at a VERY under rated guitarist and artist. This was recorded for a PBS program called ""Austin City Limits"" and they always had leading edge performers of various styles of music. The Audio is Very Good as well as the Video, Performance is stunning although he seems a little unmoved or bord, but maybe that's his style, all I know was that note for note he was right on. He's much better live, very stylish and smooth licks. The bass and drums could have been a little more pronounced and snappy but OK for a recording of this age. (Probably not enough market to re-master, what a shame.) This is a recording of a true master of early blues-rock and should be one for the keeper pile and is highly recommended, just wish it was longer!I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.*****2.****3.****Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice.

1144093,AILGCFXH3NN7Y,B0013UL4DS,MPQ,"[5, 6]",It's great that a live DVD from the fine Autin City Limits people of the great Roy Buchanan has been released. But $17.00 for 32 minutes of live songs that any true Buchanan fan already has? No thanks. There are other live Buchanan things out ther that are longer and better priced.
