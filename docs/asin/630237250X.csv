308948,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,630237250X,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","Bob Dylan often was in a shroud of mystery.  That's why J. Robert Van Dyke's documentary, `Don't Look Back' is so valuable.  Caught in the throes of his tour in England, the 1967 copyright only gives the release date of this fun and illuminating look at the great singer/songwriter/musician.  Taking from his newly released album, `Bringing It All Back Home,' the footage undoubtedly came from 1965 when he controversially went electric and invented the folk-rock hybrid.  The feel of the black and white film sometimes seems shaky and impromptu,  and scenes transition at times like a home movie.  Yet, the editing is the real gig, capturing some essential moments in the life of Dylan and his entourage at a consequential time in his career.The highlights are many.  There are times for him to ""meet the press"".  What is so revealing is how he turns the tables on one British reporter and a 'Time' correspondent later.  When a British reporter asks Bob, ""What is your attitude about life?""  He's put off by the ubiquitous question; so when he asks the reporter the same question, the reporter says he can't answer the question in two minutes.  Dylan responds, ""How do you expect me to?""  There are other great moments.  Joan Baez can be the real ham sometimes, but when she sings in their room her voice resonates beautifully.  Similarly, we get a brief, intimate performance by Donovan who visits Dylan.  There are also some fine behind-the-scenes action.  It becomes heated when the reporters come to interview Dylan, and one man tells his manager, Alan Grossman, to get out.  Another scene shows him making interesting negotiations for a couple of Dylan's performing nights in London.  Of course, the whole affair is worth the price of admission to be able to see and hear the ""Bard of Hibbing"" onstage doing numbers like ""It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" and ""The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll"".  The whole film starts with a bare-bones video of ""Subterreanean Homesick Blues,"" with Dylan changing display cards with his lyrics before the Beatles put theirs on `Sgt. Pepper'.Although not as polished as Scorsese's film, 'No Direction Home,' it is essential.  The real comparison is not with Scorsese's work, but a comparison of this film with what it would be like to have gone without it.  (I discovered this movie from `Rolling Stone,' as a list-topper from their ""Best Films of Rock `N Roll"".)",5,Archival Treasure,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,2411,"['Bob', 'Dylan', 'often', 'was', 'shroud', 'mystery', 'why', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'documentary', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'so', 'valuable', 'Caught', 'throes', 'tour', 'England', '1967', 'copyright', 'only', 'release', 'date', 'fun', 'illuminating', 'look', 'great', 'singer/songwriter/musician', 'Taking', 'newly', 'released', 'album', 'Bringing', 'All', 'Back', 'Home', 'footage', 'undoubtedly', 'came', '1965', 'when', 'controversially', 'went', 'electric', 'invented', 'folk-rock', 'hybrid', 'feel', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'sometimes', 'shaky', 'impromptu', 'scenes', 'transition', 'times', 'home', 'movie', 'editing', 'real', 'gig', 'capturing', 'essential', 'moments', 'life', 'Dylan', 'entourage', 'consequential', 'time', 'career.The', 'highlights', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'times', 'meet', 'press', 'What', 'so', 'revealing', 'how', 'tables', 'one', 'British', 'reporter', ""'Time"", 'correspondent', 'later', 'When', 'British', 'reporter', 'asks', 'Bob', 'What', 'attitude', 'life', 'put', 'off', 'ubiquitous', 'question', 'so', 'when', 'reporter', 'same', 'question', 'reporter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'question', 'two', 'minutes', 'Dylan', 'How', 'do', 'expect', 'are', 'other', 'great', 'moments', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'ham', 'sometimes', 'when', 'room', 'voice', 'beautifully', 'Similarly', 'get', 'brief', 'intimate', 'performance', 'Donovan', 'who', 'Dylan', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'behind-the-scenes', 'action', 'heated', 'when', 'reporters', 'come', 'interview', 'Dylan', 'one', 'man', 'manager', 'Alan', 'Grossman', 'get', 'out', 'scene', 'making', 'interesting', 'negotiations', 'couple', 'Dylan', 'performing', 'nights', 'London', 'course', 'whole', 'affair', 'price', 'admission', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'hear', 'Bard', 'Hibbing', 'onstage', 'doing', 'numbers', 'All', 'Right', 'Ma', ""'m"", 'Only', 'Bleeding', 'Lonesome', 'Death', 'Hattie', 'Carroll', 'whole', 'film', 'bare-bones', 'video', 'Subterreanean', 'Homesick', 'Blues', 'Dylan', 'changing', 'display', 'cards', 'lyrics', 'Beatles', 'put', 'theirs', 'Sgt', ""Pepper'.Although"", 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'Direction', 'Home', 'essential', 'real', 'comparison', 'not', 'Scorsese', 'work', 'comparison', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'gone', 'discovered', 'movie', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'list-topper', 'Best', 'Films', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll']",N/A

This DVD shows Bob Dylan on top of the world. The tour where he went from unplugged to plugged-in. Bob Dylan is in no way a sell-out. A lot of the DVD shows Dylan debating with a series of different people; mostly reporters that want an interview. He just blows them off, giving them absolutely nothing to write about and making them feel stupid in the process. Dylan is in your face; sticking it to the man every chance he gets. The discussions on the film really give you great insight into the way Dylan thinks and feels. He talks about his feelings as an atheist. He also seems to be pretty annoyed that people think he plays ""folk"" music. Most of the time, he seems to be having fun with the individual he's debating with; trying to get a rise out of them.If you like Bob Dylan's lyrics, this is an essential piece of Bob Dylan's discography.

It gives you a great perspective of Dylan as he travels throughout England on his 1965 tour...his last acoustical tour (I do believe). The movie was shot with a small camera giving the least amount of obtrusiveness to Dylan and his fellow friends/bandmembers. The movie captures scenes of concerts, of backstage antics, to parties in hotel rooms.The real gem of this DVD is the commentary by DA Pennebaker and Bob Neuwirth. They give A LOT of insight into the film as well as the events that happened during the 65 tour.There is also a bonus 'documentary' featuring an hour of deleted scenes from 'Don't Look Back'...it is edited in the same form as 'Don't Look Back', but it is only an hour long.The book that comes with it is entertaining. It is not a necessity but a nice bonus.

308957,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,630237250X,Bill R. Moore,"[4, 4]","Don't Look Back is one of the best music documentaries, essential for anyone even remotely interested in Bob Dylan or twentieth century music. The importance and influence of Dylan and the film itself are such that the latter is arguably essential for anyone interested in twentieth century culture period.The film covers Dylan's legendary 1965 English tour, historically significant as his last solo acoustic outing a few months before the infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival electric set and subsequent tours with The Band. Anyone curious about his artistic progression, especially onstage, will be fascinated. Yet this is no concert film. We see various songs from various shows - all immaculately performed and most of it impeccably filmed -, but none are complete, and there is even some repetition; anyone expecting a performance video will be disappointed. What we get instead is one of the first cinema verite examples; the black and white footage of director D. A. Pennebaker and his small staff - captured with a few of the first portable, high quality cameras - was extremely influential. It offered unprecedented intimacy, showing a high profile artist/celebrity in situations the public could not have imagined previously:  in hotel rooms, backstage, in cars, etc. Such things are now clich&eacute;d, but this is essentially where it began. The movie shows sides of Dylan that few could ever have hoped to see and that most people likely never even imagined. Some are revelatory, such as a casual Hank Williams singalong; others are less than flattering, but all are interesting. We also get tantalizing glimpses of contemporaries like Allen Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Bob Neuwirth, etc. The most engrossing scene has Dylan working out a new song at the piano; one hardly ever sees a great work in creation, and this is worth the price of Don't by itself. Even those uninterested in Dylan will find much to like, as Don't gives a very good idea of how those on the mid-1960s zeitgeist acted, talked, and dressed. Also intriguing is the insight into how a popular concert of the time looked onstage and off.Great as the film is, we must be careful not to take it as definitive. Dylan dislikes it, and it is easy to see why; he comes off as arrogant and portentous despite an always mesmerizing presence and spellbinding performances. His love of verbal dueling is clear, and it can be entertaining to watch him spar with the pretentious, presumptuous, and ignorant. However, it is hard not to sometimes feel sorry for his clearly surprised and occasionally unoffending victims and hard to admire his character as it appears here. His attitude is understandable to a significant degree; it would be hard not to tire of the same questions over and over, annoying faux-fans, etc., and his reactions are at least more lively and creative than most. We also must not forget that Dylan was after all very young and so wrapped up in prolific creative brilliance that it is remarkable he even had time for anything else.

It is fascinating to watch a young artist of extraordinary talent being asked questions about the meaning of his music.Dylan's incredulous manner in response is funny, ironic, and at times very sarcastic; especially with the totally ""out of it"" reporter from Time Magazine.  The interview is one of the subjects of a very informative commentary by director and documentary genius D.A. Pennebaker and Bob Neuwirth, the tour manager.His treatment of his young fans is a sweet counterpoint to his sarcastic treatment of the press.  He is kind and very solicitous of a gaggle of young girls he has up to his room before a performance.An added pleasure is the snatches of the beautiful voice of Joan Baez who accompanied him on the tour.  Her offstage voice is as beautiful and radiant as onstage; strong and pure.The deluxe edition has full tracks sung by Dylan while on the tour, including It Ain't Me Babe, It's All Over Now Baby Blue, Love Minus Zero/No Limit, The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll, and To Ramonna.

D.A. Pennebaker was certainly in the right place at the right time (and given access to the Right Guy!) to capture a pivotal and seminal moment in modern music history. One sublime scene of irony that no veteran comedy writer could have scripted so perfectly: Dylan's acerbic manager Albert Grossman kicks the snobby London hotel manager out after he complains other guests are upset over the &quot;ruckus&quot; in Dylan's suite (Yeah, could you please tell Joan Baez, Donovan and Bob Dylan to quit playing those noisy guitars and singing-I have to get up early!).

It is an excellent, realistically shot, accounting of an concert tour ,by the young Dylan and his then-entourage, through England.  I found it quite entertaining as were the limited number of concert pieces that he performed.Having said that, I should add that it would be sheer self-delusion to believe that one has learned much about Dylan, save how he  speaks, what some of his entourage, and other people he met, looked and sounded, the feel of some of the hotel rooms, and similar matters. What we cannot learn from these pictures and sounds, is the meaning of the actual scenes, the place they have, from the perspective of the tour and of Dylan's career line,  and.........In other words, we are seeing a dream-like illusion not social or psychological dynamics which make up the meaningful experience.  By no coincidence, I am concurrently reading one of the accepted standard biographies of Dylan to the age of about 50. While no book has been able to provide an acceptably ""realistic"" portrait of the singer/songwriter, the written form gives the possibility of greater depth than does a photo, series of photographs, or a moving picture. However, to the point, the ability of the written material to describe the roles of each of the participants in the Dylan nexus adds substance to the screen portrayal of their physical interactions.At any rate,  the film is a fine representation of the craft and a picture of what it might have been like to be a fly on the wall during some events in the life of a very important person.

Karasik,"[12, 15]","This film gives the viewer a candid view of an incredibly talented, precocious, irreverent, and actually quite beautiful young Dylan revealed in wonderful concert and behind-the-scenes footage.  After seeing the film I felt that Dylan's legendary arrogance has been perhaps misunderstood -- actually he was pretty humble and engaging with school kids and fellow musicians -- more interested in learning from them than in showing off his own talents.  What comes off as arrogance is his almost allergic aversion to simplistic, cliched, or hypocritical concepts imposed upon him by clueless, syncophantic journalists and fans.  His trenchant verbal sparring with a reporter from Time magazine, in which he argues that the readers of Time are settling for secondhand drivel and that Time has too much to lose by telling the truth, is one of the most refreshing and amusing interviews I've ever seen.  Likewise, one can appreciate his struggle to avoid being pigeonholed as either a political activist or a folk singer; certainly his political sensibilities are profound, but he understandably chaffed at the attempts to turn him into a mouthpiece for any single cause or established movement.  His instinctive fight to keep the doors of perception ajar has proven well founded; it is precisely his protean shape-shifting and incessant search for new levels of meaning and musical expression that have made him such a timeless icon.  The one sour note in the film was his obviously strained relationship with Joan Baez, not only a brilliant singer in her own right but also a witty mimic and comic, whom he relegates to groupie status and mostly ignores.  Given the fact that she invited Dylan to share her stage when he was virtually unknown, one would have expected Dylan to have invited her to sing a song or two.  What a waste of talent -- but then, apparently their romantic relationship was in its death throes, so it may be unfair to judge.  Ultimately, this film made me sad simply because it shows the sheer brilliance of a person at a moment in time that is now forty years in the past.

This documentary follows Dylan on a tour through England and the viewer gets to play a fly on the wall as you watch this genius interact with the likes of Alan Price (The Animals), Joan Baez, and Donovan.

With little ado, it follows Bob Dylan and his small entourage (including Joan Baez) around England on an acoustic concert tour in the spring of 1965, in delicious black-and-white (mostly with hand-held cameras.) Much of the time we are in cars and hotel rooms, with occasional footage of Bob onstage performing alone with his guitar and harmonica. On a certain level we get a gritty version of the carefree fun of the Beatles' &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; - Bob and friends mostly hang around, seemingly without a care in the world, not appreciating how fleeting is this era of anyone's youth. At the same time, Dylan spends much of his time in pointless debates with journalists and others who are hanging around, keeping up a self-centered patter that I trust would embarrass an older man looking back on his cocky youth. It's argument for the sake of argument. His insouciant bravado has always been maddening; Bob shows little of his true self to the public in interviews and encounters, but then...he goes onstage, and those songs speak directly to our hearts, now as then. It's a weird contrast between the backstage kiss-off artist and the onstage genius. However, snatches of the real Dylan do slip through in this footage too. He seems wary and insecure around peers such as Donovan. Before going onstage at the Royal Albert Hall, the man who has just spent a long time telling a reporter that Time magazine is meaningless stops to carefully check himself in the mirror before going on. After the same concert, he seems genuinely upbeat and glad about the performance. In these and a few other glimpses, we see chinks in the armor of the self-conscious rebel, and behold, there is a human being beneath. No wonder the songs are so good. (The sound quality of the live performances isn't great in this film, but then it probably wasn't in real life in those days either.)",4,"Trying to be hip, and actually being hip in spite of it",1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,1981,"['doubt', 'film', 'was', 'influential', 'piece', 'cinema', 'verite', 'subsequent', 'rockumentaries', 'little', 'ado', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'small', 'entourage', 'including', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'England', 'acoustic', 'concert', 'tour', 'spring', '1965', 'delicious', 'black-and-white', 'mostly', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'Much', 'time', 'are', 'cars', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'occasional', 'footage', 'Bob', 'onstage', 'performing', 'alone', 'guitar', 'harmonica', 'certain', 'level', 'get', 'gritty', 'version', 'carefree', 'fun', 'Beatles', 'quot', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'quot', 'Bob', 'friends', 'mostly', 'hang', 'around', 'seemingly', 'care', 'world', 'not', 'appreciating', 'how', 'fleeting', 'era', 'anyone', 'youth', 'same', 'time', 'Dylan', 'much', 'time', 'pointless', 'debates', 'journalists', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'hanging', 'around', 'keeping', 'up', 'self-centered', 'patter', 'trust', 'would', 'embarrass', 'older', 'man', 'looking', 'back', 'cocky', 'youth', 'argument', 'sake', 'argument', 'insouciant', 'bravado', 'always', 'been', 'maddening', 'Bob', 'little', 'true', 'self', 'public', 'interviews', 'encounters', 'then', 'onstage', 'songs', 'speak', 'directly', 'hearts', 'now', 'then', 'weird', 'contrast', 'backstage', 'kiss-off', 'artist', 'onstage', 'genius', 'However', 'snatches', 'real', 'Dylan', 'do', 'slip', 'footage', 'too', 'wary', 'insecure', 'peers', 'such', 'Donovan', 'going', 'onstage', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'spent', 'long', 'time', 'telling', 'reporter', 'Time', 'magazine', 'meaningless', 'stops', 'carefully', 'check', 'mirror', 'going', 'same', 'concert', 'genuinely', 'upbeat', 'glad', 'performance', 'few', 'other', 'glimpses', 'see', 'chinks', 'armor', 'self-conscious', 'rebel', 'behold', 'human', 'being', 'beneath', 'wonder', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'live', 'performances', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'then', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'days', 'either']",N/A
308973,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,630237250X,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[30, 31]","The documentary feature, especially biographical portraits of entertainers, has really evolved through the years.  The glimpse into Bob Dylan ""Don't Look Back"" was one of the earliest and the best to simply let the camera observe its subject without specific purpose.  This fly-on-the-wall access to the behind the stage antics during a three week concert tour in England redefined the narrative feature documentary with its simplicity and observational tone.  Dylan was an elusive entertainer and acclaimed documentarian D.A. Pennebaker knew that to get the truth from his artist was to leave him alone and report what happened.  In truth, there is nothing especially revelatory going on and no high drama--just an intimacy that the low-key Dylan rarely allowed (either before or after).  Now this classic documentary (purported to by the first feature documentary to enter DVD format in 1999) goes into the Blu-Ray realm.Visual/Audio:  Is it worth the upgrade?  If you don't own ""Don't Look Back"" and you have an interest in Dylan or film history, this is a pretty significant film--so why not pick up the Blu-ray edition?  If you have the earliest DVD release, this is also an easy recommendation for the added features and content.  If, however, you have the 2007 standard issue DVD release--things might get a little more complicated unless you are just updating every film in your library.  Mastered in High Definition, this new version looks fine, but not significantly superior.  Based on the source material, the original aspect ratio is maintained (which it should be) so this will not be shown in widescreen format.  The visual and audio presentation (in 2.0) isn't a leap from the 2007 presentation.Features:  The extra content on the two disc set is wonderful--but most is revamped from the earlier edition.  Included on both are '65 revisited (comprised significantly of about an hour of extra backstage footage), commentary tracks from Pennebaker and the tour road manager, five additional uncut audio tracks, an alternate version of Subterranean Homesick Blues, cue card sequence and the trailer.  EXCLUSIVE on this release:  a new interview with Pennebaker and critic Greil Marcus.I understand that most fans of the film will jump at the chance to add this to Blu-Ray--as well they should.  My comments are geared toward those collectors that have to be more selective when upgrading due to financial constraints.  If you own the 2007 release with the above listed features, this new edition will NOT change the viewing experience of ""Don't Look Back.""  The exclusive interviews are interesting enough but they don't make or break the collection.  So approach an upgrade based on the priority with which you value the film.  New viewers, though, pick this up for a bit of rock history AND documentary history.

308974,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630237250X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","When I heard that Bob Dylan had formally become a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, my immediate thought was that it was about time.  Words set to music are still words.  Besides, when they start rhyming, or at least are in that ballpark, then you can talk about them as being poetry, and poets have won the Noble prize for Literature, so why not Bob Dylan?  Writing in support of the nomination Alan Ginsberg wrote: ""Dylan is a major American Bard & minstrel of the XX Century, whose words have influenced many generations throughout the world. He deserves a Nobel Prize in recognition of his mighty and universal powers.""Fortunately the people who decide such things as Nobel prizes tend to restrict themselves to words on pages rather than cinema verit&eacute; documentaries, because what would they think of the 23-year-old Dylan who appears at the eye of ""Bob Dylan: Don't Look Back.""  Made during Dylan's 1965 tour of England by D.A. Pennebaker, there is not enough music in it to warrant watching it for that alone.  There are bits from several songs, such as  ""The Times They Are A-Changing'"" and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" but you can get a bit of a Dylan fix from the complete audio tracks for songs from the tour available as a special feature (Dylan's interaction with his audience seems civil and pleasant enough).  There are several shots of Dylan walking on stage and the audience erupting into applause, but Pennebaker is not interested in providing concert footage.  In contrast, for the most part Dylan is not all that interested in talking.  Sometimes you think that the only times he is happy is when he is playing his guitar or fooling around on the piano.What you think about this documentary comes down to what you think about Dylan, and that is going to depend on two key exchanges.  The first is a young man (if he had a name I missed it) who thinks that Dylan should get to know him.  Dylan asks ""Why?""  I do not think the question is posed facetiously, but more as a challenge.  The young man is upset over this challenge to his self-esteem, but for the life of him he cannot answer the question.  Yes, he is being asked to justify his existence, but there is a level on which that is what the Sixties were all about.  The young man studied science in school.  Why?  To what end?  To accomplish what with his life?  Dylan's questions get more and more specific, but the young man's answers keep him hiding in the tall grass of generalities.  I did not think Dylan was being cruel because as I read the exchange he was giving this guy every opportunity to come up with an answer.  Maybe he would have cut the guy off at the knees at that point, but it is only when this guy makes it clear he wants the validation to come from Dylan that the singer-songwriter just grins and unloads a few parting shots.  At the end of this first exchange I was thinking everybody praises Dylan for what he says (or at least what he writes) but they just do not listen.The second exchange is when a reporter from ""TIME"" shows up to interview Dylan, who insists that magazines would never dare print the truth.  Of course the reporter asks the big question, which can be traced back at least to Pontius Pilate, and wants to know what is truth.  Clearly no student of the Sophists, Dylan comes up with an operational definition of truth as a photograph of a tramp vomiting into a sewer next to one of Rockefeller.  The juxtaposition of such images is certainly confrontational, but the truth that Dylan suggests apparently needs more explanation.  The reporter presses for clarification, which is just what Dylan is doing in the previous scene.  But rather than provide specifics, Dylan sticks with the images he has articulated.  Of course, this is not surprising, because such images and words are the cornerstone of his most powerful lyrics.  Asking him to explain what such things mean is tantamount to asking a magician to explain his tricks.  However, it also begs the question as to whether such meaning is ultimately to be found in the poet rather than in his poetry (I go with the latter because for me meaning is created by my experience decoding the text and ultimately what the creator did or did not intend does not matter, as Charles Manson would be more than happy to explain to you while listening to ""The White Album"" by the Beatles).Of course, all of this is taking place in the fishbowl that was Dylan's life at that time in front of that small circle of friends (for lack of a better word) who are in constant attendance.  This includes Joan Baez, who for the most part sits around and smiles.  She breaks into song once, and apparently tosses a glass out of a window, but she has the Warren Beatty part in this one (i.e., she is smart enough to keep her mouth shut).  Donovan shows up to, both in Dylan's room and in the newspaper headlines.  The Beatles do not show up, but they are mentioned and it is painfully clear that they are on a different mountaintop from Dylan.  If only there had been a world where Dylan could have tattooed ""listen to the music and figure it out for yourself"" on his forehead.  Did getting 2,000 versus 1,500 pounds for an interview really matter?The DVD contains the requisite commentary track by Pennebaker and the tour manager Bob Neuwirth, and whatever you end up thinking of Dylan, you have to admit that Pennebaker comes out way ahead with ""Don't Look Back"" (but closed captioning would be helpful to anything in which Dylan speaks as well as sings).  There are five original, uncut audio performances of  ""To Ramona,"" ""It Ain't Me, Babe"", ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"", ""Love Minus Zero/No Limit"", and ""The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.""  Then we have an alternative ""never before seen"" version of the infamous ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" (a.k.a. the ""first music video"") bit with the cue cards.  I figure that anybody who reads this review has seen Dylan and Ginsberg hanging out in an alley.  That is just the prologue to this documentary and you should check out the entire thing at least once in your life.  Final Observation: The other day I traveled from the Zenith City, the birthplace of Robert Zimmerman, to Hibbing and sat in the auditorium of the high school.  If those seats in that gorgeous room were as uncomfortable when he was going to school there as they were this week, then that could offer an alternative explanation for Dylan's temperament.",5,Pay no

Yet nobody is writing their script; they are writing that themselves.  These comments are also relevant to this excellent documentary of young Bob Dylan on tour in England in 1965.I don't like the Spotlight Reviews on this site.  They are too ""expert"" and don't get everything right.  They are too full of themselves.One of the main impressions I get from this documentary concerns the clash between beautiful and brilliant Dylan, who is actually doing something good in the world, and the reporters/critics.  True, Dylan is very confrontational with them, but they are lucky to have his attention at all.It seems like these nothings, these cogs in the wheels that employ them, don't get the point at all.  The point is Hattie Carroll, being murdered by a rich and apathetic white s.o.b. and getting away with it.  The point is that Bob Dylan is coming out and saying something that needs to be said.  The point is that Bob Dylan believes in right and wrong, and therefore is a mouthpiece of God, cutting through all our crap.And very few others were doing this at the time.  Not too many are doing it now either.  Put on the radio.  What do you hear?  You hear personal lyrics, I love you, I find you attractive, I'm mad at you, whatever.  In one genre you hear that you are worthless except to the degree that you turn me on, and that the singer is worth more than you because he has a fancier car and more expensive jewelry, and will blow you away with a shotgun.What a bunch of baloney.  What kind of values are we offering to the young people who listen to this idiocy and think it is cool?Then you have Dylan.  Justice.  Poetry.  Intelligence.  How often do you hear a lyric on the radio that is intelligent?Contrast the Dylan of this documentary to some of the more recent Dylans.  Do you know the song Union Sundown?  That's the one ripping globalization to shreds, a decade before everyone else realized it needed to be stopped, a way to maximize profits by paying pennies for labor, firing American workers and replacing them with slave labor overseas.Contrast that Dylan to this younger one.  The more modern one, the older one, isn't physically beautiful anymore, isn't a pixyish darling anymore, but he's just as on target, just as sharp and penetrating.One of the highlights of this video is the live performance of the beginning of It's All Over Now Baby Blue at the special request of Donovan.  First, Donovan sings a perfectly nice song, then Dylan sings a freaking masterpiece.  I like the way Dylan smiles as he sings ""yonder stands your orphan"".  Think about that line.  Your orphan?  That means you are dead, doesn't it.  I like Dylan's smile as he sings that line, a smile saying hey, listen to that lyric, get it?  It's one of the really interesting lines to It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.At the Albert Hall, Dylan is alone with his guitar and harmonica, no band behind him, and he is mesmerizing the world's most elite audience, the Beatles among them.  He's doing it just being himself, his brilliant self.I like most of the commentary.  This is one of the few videos where I played the film a second time to listen to the whole commentary.  It's funny the way one of the commentators gives all his reasons for being pleased that Hattie Carroll was cut off before its climactic ending and thunderous applause, and then the other commentator, who is obviously right, completely disagrees with what we've been listening to, in a perfectly non-confrontational way, and says that was the one song that should have been shown in its entirety.  Far from detracting from the effectiveness of the film, this song would have made the entire point of the film, that Dylan was a powerhouse.Real people, worth watching",5,Real people worth watching,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,3892,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'reality', 'television', 'even', 'contestants', 'Survivor', 'Big', 'Brother', 'are', 'completely', 'artificial', 'situation', 'far', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'nobody', 'writing', 'script', 'are', 'writing', 'comments', 'are', 'also', 'relevant', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'young', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'tour', 'England', '1965.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Spotlight', 'Reviews', 'site', 'are', 'too', 'expert', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'are', 'too', 'full', 'themselves.One', 'main', 'impressions', 'get', 'documentary', 'clash', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'Dylan', 'who', 'actually', 'doing', 'something', 'good', 'world', 'reporters/critics', 'True', 'Dylan', 'very', 'confrontational', 'are', 'lucky', 'have', 'attention', 'all.It', 'nothings', 'cogs', 'wheels', 'employ', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'point', 'point', 'Hattie', 'Carroll', 'being', 'murdered', 'rich', 'apathetic', 'white', 's.o.b', 'getting', 'away', 'point', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'coming', 'out', 'saying', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'point', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'right', 'wrong', 'therefore', 'mouthpiece', 'God', 'cutting', 'crap.And', 'very', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'doing', 'time', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'either', 'Put', 'radio', 'What', 'do', 'hear', 'hear', 'personal', 'lyrics', 'love', 'find', 'attractive', ""'m"", 'mad', 'one', 'genre', 'hear', 'are', 'worthless', 'degree', 'turn', 'singer', 'more', 'fancier', 'car', 'more', 'expensive', 'jewelry', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'shotgun.What', 'bunch', 'baloney', 'What', 'kind', 'values', 'are', 'offering', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'listen', 'idiocy', 'think', 'cool', 'Then', 'have', 'Dylan', 'Justice', 'Poetry', 'Intelligence', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'hear', 'lyric', 'radio', 'intelligent', 'Contrast', 'Dylan', 'documentary', 'more', 'recent', 'Dylans', 'Do', 'know', 'song', 'Union', 'Sundown', 'one', 'ripping', 'globalization', 'shreds', 'decade', 'everyone', 'else', 'realized', 'needed', 'be', 'stopped', 'way', 'maximize', 'profits', 'paying', 'pennies', 'labor', 'firing', 'American', 'workers', 'replacing', 'slave', 'labor', 'Dylan', 'younger', 'one', 'more', 'modern', 'one', 'older', 'one', ""n't"", 'physically', 'beautiful', 'anymore', ""n't"", 'pixyish', 'darling', 'anymore', 'just', 'target', 'just', 'sharp', 'penetrating.One', 'highlights', 'video', 'live', 'performance', 'beginning', 'Over', 'Now', 'Baby', 'Blue', 'special', 'request', 'Donovan', 'First', 'Donovan', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'song', 'then', 'Dylan', 'freaking', 'masterpiece', 'way', 'Dylan', 'yonder', 'orphan', 'Think', 'line', 'orphan', 'are', 'dead', ""n't"", 'like', 'Dylan', 'smile', 'line', 'smile', 'saying', 'hey', 'listen', 'lyric', 'get', 'one', 'really', 'interesting', 'lines', 'Over', 'Now', 'Baby', 'Blue.At', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'Dylan', 'alone', 'guitar', 'harmonica', 'band', 'mesmerizing', 'world', 'most', 'elite', 'audience', 'Beatles', 'doing', 'just', 'being', 'brilliant', 'self.I', 'most', 'commentary', 'one', 'few', 'videos', 'where', 'played', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'listen', 'whole', 'commentary', 'funny', 'way', 'one', 'commentators', 'reasons', 'being', 'pleased', 'Hattie', 'Carroll', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'climactic', 'ending', 'thunderous', 'applause', 'then', 'other', 'commentator', 'who', 'obviously', 'right', 'completely', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'perfectly', 'non-confrontational', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'song', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'entirety', 'Far', 'detracting', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'entire', 'point', 'film', 'Dylan', 'was', 'powerhouse.Real', 'people', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I actually was prompted to this after seeing the recent Bob Dylan interview on ""60 Minutes"" (to promote his equally astonishing memoir ""Chronicles-Volume 1""). Were you as astonished by the ""60 Minutes"" piece as I was? In any event, ""Don't Look Back"" is essential on so many levels: first and foremost, it gives us a never-since equalled candid view at life (on the road) with Dylan. While it does contain a number of performances, ""Don't Look Back"" is not a concert movie. It's more a pre-concert movie than anything else, watching Dylan getting ready to perform in the ""Green Door"" and other performing halls' waiting rooms. The film also remains essential as a looking glass onto England, 1965, with its gritty, if not to say seemingly always gray outlook and feel to it.Back to the ""60 Minutes"" interview. When I was watching it, it felt so familiar. Even though the interviews are separated by almost 40 years, Dylan played the ""60 Minutes"" interviewer in very much the same way he played the British journalists in 1965, although admittedly in a somewhat nice fashion now. Watch again the ""interview"" Dylan did with the reporter from ""Time Magazine"" towards the end of ""Don't Look Back"", it's the highlight of the movie for me.The live performances in ""Don't Look Back"" are equally essential, if for no other reason that you are watching Dylan in Spring, 1965 (almost 40 years ago to the day!), a mere months before turning electric at the Newport Festival. From an audio perspective, the performances in ""Don't Look Back"" are very similar to the material covered in the 2 CD set ""Dylan Live 1964"", issued in Spring of 2004. The staying power of ""Don't Look Back"" 40 years later is proof that this movie is essential for any Dylan fan.

308982,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,630237250X,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[189, 205]","Don't Look Back is the best documentary about a musician on tour that I've ever seen. I can't say enough good things about it, and it is all I can do to imagine how D. A. Pennebaker simultaneously made himself so ubiquitous and so unnoticed as to capture the remarkable footage that he got on Dylan's British tour. From the incredible sequence of Joan Baez warbling the then-unreleased &quot;Percy's Song&quot; even as Dylan is pounding out the lyrics on his typewriter, to the revealing moments where Dylan manager Albert Grossman quite literally strong-arms the BBC into a high-paying deal for a tv appearance, to Dylan himself, at the most accessible he would ever be in his long career, alternately jousting and jesting with the British press, most of whom seem completely ignorant as to which is the jest and which is the joust. Dylan again, talking with a fan who doesn't like &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; because &quot;it just doesn't sound like you,&quot; (which was the whole point of the song), and Dylan's gritted-teeth reply: &quot;Oh, I see what kind of person you are right away.&quot; Dylan yet again, in an astonishingly unguarded moment, bawling out everyone in his hotel room over a wineglass Alan Price dropped out of the window, acting like the only responsible adult in a kindergarten class...and when a drunken Price admits the deed, Dylan lets him have it with both barrels and finally kicks him out, despite Price having been Dylan's best friend in England throughout the entire film. In fact, a lot of this movie is about Dylan shedding elements of his persona, entourage, and his music. Bringing it All Back Home had just been released when Don't Look Back was being filmed, and the album served as a harbinger of the rock and roll shift Dylan's music was about to take. It's far more noticeable in hindsight, of course, but in this film you see Dylan breaking his ties with his folkie past. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; being shown right up front is a dead giveaway, but you may miss some of the more subtle signs: His growing disenchantment with being pegged as a folkie, evidenced by both the abovementioned reaction to his fans and his jests/jousts with the press, both harbingers of the surreal &quot;anti-interviews&quot; Dylan would give over the next few years. Then there is the slow disintegration of his relationship with Baez -- there is a moment about midway or 2/3 of the way through Don't Look Back where Joan walks out of Dylan's hotel room...and though she appears later in the film through the judicious use of editing, Baez has since admitted that that was the moment she walked out of Dylan's life. Another folk-music tie broken, as much by Dylan as by Baez (his near-indifference to her through much of the film is chilling...). There is also Dylan's discomfort with the &quot;Donovan issue&quot;, both in being compared to Donovan and in meeting the guy. You can see the uncertainty all over Bob's face during this sequence, and the nicer he tries to be to Donovan -- who quite honestly sholdn't even be in the same room with Dylan -- the funnier the whole thing gets. Then there is Dylan's meeting with the President of Dylan's British fan club -- the bespectacled weedy fellow who looks like he just stepped whole and breathing out of the nightclub scene in A Hard Day's Night. Dylan's conversation with this guy is polite on the surface, but again, there are undertones of discomfort, even dislike, so palpable that they make you want to cringe. Dylan is so clearly disenchanted with some aspects of his career, even though he puts on a game face and acts satisfied with what he's doing, that it's a wonder he didn't completely telegraph his shift to electric music. (Actually, he did -- it's just that most people were too blind to see it coming at the time.)As I said above, the footage in this film is incredibly revealing. Never again would Dylan be so accessible, so honest and forthright, as he was in Don't Look Back -- and even here, as I've said, you can sense his withdrawal from that accessibility begin. How Pennebaker managed to capture all this intense, remarkable, human footage of Dylan and co., without his subjects noticing or caring about how they came across, is beyond me. Few music documentaries, before or since, have had such verve, or such nerve, as to show their subjects in such a potentially-unflattering light (the only two I can think of that come anywhere close are Gimme Shelter, the Maysles Brothers' astonishing Stones/Altamont document, and Let It Be, the Beatles' on-film disintegration (and final live performance) which stupidly remains out of print). Don't Look Back does all that and more, never cheating, never prevaricating or retreating, always telling the truth. It was a rare achievement for its time, and a film that could never be made today.(FINAL NOTE: All right, Messrs. Dylan and Pennebaker -- now that Don't Look Back has been remastered and rereleased, how about doing the same with the long-missing and much-missed 1966 followup, Eat the Document? It's no less raw, revealing, and astonishing than its predecessor, and is richly deserving of a rerelease.

I was able to live with my uncle in Cedar Rapids but I really didn't know anyone else there and it was about 100 miles away from my buddies (and had no car).  It was really a depressing time but I found my emotional outlet that summer of '72 in Bob Dylan.  I had all his first 5 albums and I kept playing them all summer long.  Cedar Rapids didn't have any meaning for me but Life was sure expanding its' meaning through the brilliant insight of Dylan.  I went back to college that Fall and my music playlist greatly expanded.  In time my interest in music expanded to where Dylan was just a part time thing.  Years later my wife, knowing my love for the music of Bob Dylan bought me ""Planet Waves"".  I only played it once; his singing sounded so awful I couldn't stand it.  Things picked up later, around the time of ""Hurricane"", and I enjoy a lot of the latter Dylan as well.  However, I was always so grateful for his presence and his insight that lousy summer of '72.I rented ""Don't Look Back"" with a rather casual interest recently.  I wasn't in a big hurry to watch it since my evenings were so full.  However, when I finally sat down to view it, I relived all the good that he put into that lonely Summer.  I mentally re-enacted every mood and insight that I had had before as I traveled down a memory lane of protests, noble causes, and revelations.  For the Dylan purists, all of this preceeds Dylan's discovery of the electric guitar.  It is a movie put together from his 1964 British Tour.  The music is great but the real enjoyment I took from the film was Dylan himself.  This movie candidly shows him in a variety of moods and settings.  Some of the scenes were simply outstanding.  I think my favorite was an extended scene where he and a cohort were interviewing a rather clumsy British interviewer.  It may sound uninteresting but I enjoyed Dylan's effort to try and figure out just what made this guy tick.  He was having fun and the rest of us were as well.I rented this DVD.  I will certainly be purchasing my own copy.  It's worth watching again and again...especially if I ever get stuck in Cedar Rapids.",5,The Early Years,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2265,"['had', 'hard', 'time', 'one', 'summer', 'parents', 'had', 'moved', 'out', 'East', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'spending', 'summer', 'away', 'college', 'buddies', 'was', 'able', 'live', 'uncle', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'was', 'about', '100', 'miles', 'away', 'buddies', 'had', 'car', 'was', 'really', 'depressing', 'time', 'found', 'emotional', 'outlet', 'summer', ""'72"", 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'had', 'first', '5', 'albums', 'kept', 'playing', 'summer', 'long', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'meaning', 'Life', 'was', 'sure', 'expanding', 'meaning', 'brilliant', 'insight', 'Dylan', 'went', 'back', 'college', 'Fall', 'music', 'playlist', 'greatly', 'expanded', 'time', 'interest', 'music', 'expanded', 'where', 'Dylan', 'was', 'just', 'part', 'time', 'thing', 'Years', 'later', 'wife', 'knowing', 'love', 'music', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'bought', 'Planet', 'Waves', 'only', 'played', 'once', 'singing', 'sounded', 'so', 'awful', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Things', 'picked', 'up', 'later', 'time', 'Hurricane', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'latter', 'Dylan', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'grateful', 'presence', 'insight', 'lousy', 'summer', ""'72.I"", 'rented', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'rather', 'casual', 'interest', 'recently', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'hurry', 'watch', 'evenings', 'were', 'so', 'full', 'However', 'when', 'finally', 'sat', 'view', 'relived', 'good', 'put', 'lonely', 'Summer', 'mentally', 're-enacted', 'mood', 'insight', 'had', 'had', 'traveled', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'protests', 'noble', 'causes', 'revelations', 'Dylan', 'purists', 'Dylan', 'discovery', 'electric', 'guitar', 'movie', 'put', 'together', '1964', 'British', 'Tour', 'music', 'great', 'real', 'enjoyment', 'took', 'film', 'was', 'Dylan', 'movie', 'candidly', 'variety', 'moods', 'settings', 'scenes', 'were', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'think', 'favorite', 'was', 'extended', 'scene', 'where', 'cohort', 'were', 'interviewing', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'British', 'interviewer', 'may', 'sound', 'uninteresting', 'enjoyed', 'Dylan', 'effort', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'made', 'guy', 'tick', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'rest', 'were', 'well.I', 'rented', 'DVD', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'purchasing', 'own', 'copy', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'especially', 'ever', 'get', 'stuck', 'Cedar', 'Rapids']",N/A
