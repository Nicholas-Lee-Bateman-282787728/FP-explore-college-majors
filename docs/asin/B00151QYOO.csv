This film could've possibly been OK, but I'm one of the many people who don't like this movie. ""One Missed Call"" is cliche in basically every way. It was basically as bad as ""Pulse"". I also hate that line where that girl says something like ""You get a phone call, you hear your death, and then you die"". It's trying to be creepy when it's horribly acted. There are some creepy points in this film, like that weird creature and those people that have screaming faces as eyes, but that's about it. You could possibly get this creepy feeling at the ending, but the feeling won't last long at all. You will NOT lose any sleep over this movie...unless you've never seen a horror movie and you're 6 years old.

No no, it's nothing to do with shadow people coming out of nowhere, or mysterious sounds and images that appear out of nowhere.  Cell phones are scary because, well, you know.  Like I said, no need to explain what makes them scary!  Just go driving or go to the movies for further proof!Anyway, this isn't really THAT bad of a movie.  It tried to have a spooky atmosphere, and it tried making the kill scenes interesting.  It even tried telling a story that was fairly interesting in that each time the cell phone would ring, the person who owned that phone would find out they were going to die soon.Of course that meant the people would start freaking out, which would lead to these strange demon creatures appearing, and sure enough, the people would die a short time later.And why was it whenever someone would die, their friends would have NO reaction to it other than a quick scream or moment of confusion?  Where were the tears?The death scenes were pretty graphic, even though the entire film is basically the same thing as Final Destination 3.  VERY similar vibe and appearance.  I know one thing- the woman who played the lead actress is very VERY hot.  What a face that girl has!  That's probably the main reason I'm giving the movie an extra star.  I guess I can't help myself there, hehe.Anyway, no, don't rent this movie, and especially don't BUY the darn thing.  It's laughable of course.

1148120,A278AF56R7J86,B00151QYOO,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[13, 19]","I would say the best thing that can be said about this film is that it's pretty average. Sadly, that's not really saying much.""One Missed Call"" is about a young woman who joins forces with a local detective in order to solve the mystery behind various bizarre deaths, while trying to keep herself from becoming the next victim. Each victim receives a phone call on their cell phone that goes to voice mail. The call is dated as being from the future, and when they listen to the voice mail they hear their own death.Like most Japanese horror movie remakes, this one had difficulty being translated and Americanized. The plot seems awkward and disjointed most of the time, and the acting (especially on the part of Edward Burns, who plays Detective Jack Andrews) was pretty terrible. I'm not sure if it was just because they were having difficulty with the material, but the acting definitely left something to be desired.There are no special features available on this disc, only the usual scene selection and language options.

1148125,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00151QYOO,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 14]","I'm sure I'll someday join the twenty-first century and buy a cell phone, but until then, I have films like ""One Missed Call"" to remind me of how frightening they are. One could argue that that's the point of the story: to show how our ever-growing reliance on cellular communication is incredibly scary, and we in turn fall victim to an overpowering influence. But this is only a theoretical approach to the pre-filmed story--if you've actually seen the final film, then you'll know that such a deep concept was never even considered. This movie is a full-blown fright fest, an excuse to scare the audience with lots of terrifying imagery and a wealth of sudden noises. All that is superficially fun, and I will admit that this is a very good-looking horror film. But even as the scares are piling up, there does come a point when something like an understandable story is needed. ""One Missed Call"" eventually loses itself to plot twists that make for more questions than answers, which isn't good for those who want to be truly horrified.The first major scene shows the death of a college student, a death that kick starts a chain reaction of other deaths. All the deaths are foreshadowed via a message left on each victim's cell phone. The message shows a future date and time, and what's even scarier, it plays a recording of what the person will say at the moment of their death. An interesting idea, no question, although similar ideas have been done before: in ""The Ring,"" the victims died seven days after watching a demonic videotape; in ""The Grudge,"" the victims entering a haunted house fell victim to an angry ghost; in ""Pulse"" the victims were all sent a possessed e-mail. There's a theme here--all these films are American remakes of Japanese horror films. So, too, is ""One Missed Call."" While I haven't seen the film on which it's based--""Chakushin Ari""--and while I haven't read Yasushi Akimoto's original novel, I can say that the idea of vengeful spirits working through technology and/or people is starting to get old.The basic plot is as follows: Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) begins losing all her friends after one of her classmates is found dead. She doesn't know why; all she does know is that each of her friends received a voicemail on their cell phones, one that told them when they would die and what they would say at that moment. It's actually quite creepy: each time a person gets a call, his or her phone plays a quiet music box lullaby instead of a ring tone. And after they hear the message, they begin to see disturbing things, like phantom centipedes and bizarre figures with pale, dirty, rotted faces (one figure has screaming mouths where it's eyes should be). As soon as they die, they cough up a piece of hard candy, after which their cell phones magically dial another number, marking the next person on the list. Beth eventually gets the call; with the help of Officer Jack Andrews (Edward Burns)--who has a personal connection to the case--she hopes to solve this mystery before her time runs out.Believe it or not, I didn't find this idea so bad. Actually, some of the film was effectively tense, and many moments are more than a little frightening. What brought the story down was a heavy reliance on background material--it was as if the filmmakers were purposely trying to add depth to the story, not realizing that each bit of information didn't really add up to anything. Consider Beth's remembrance of a traumatic childhood experience: it barely connects to a subplot involving a mute girl who survived a hospital fire. You see, the girl's mother--whose body was never found--is suspected of being abusive, which is painful for Beth since her own mother was the same way. Had the connection gone any deeper than that, maybe Beth's back-story would have worked. But it didn't, so it doesn't.To be fair, certain parts of the film work wonderfully, given the genre. The most frightening moments take place at the scene of the fire, a place that has enough dark corners, spooky sounds, and pop out scares to go around. One scene has Beth crawling through a ventilation shaft, only to make a gruesome discovery. I won't reveal what she finds or what happens, but I will say it was scary enough for me to overlook the ridiculousness of crawling through a shaft in an abandoned hospital. Were this any other scene, it would only reinforce our collective hatred of horror movie clich&eacute;s.As you've probably guessed, Beth and Jack eventually have to figure out what's going on and who--or what--is responsible. By the time everything is explained, I felt more confused than anything else, simply because far too many new details are thrown into the mix. I realize I'm being incredibly vague, but ""One Missed Call"" is the kind of horror film that thrives on mystery and suspense, so I know that being more specific would risk giving away crucial plot points. Whatever. I wish I could say that it tells a meaningful story, but the reality is that it's just a routine scary movie, and as such, it only exists to make the audience jump. This is fine, I guess, as long as you can overlook the weak story and the preposterous twists of fate. If you can, then you can definitely overlook the missed opportunity at social commentary. After all, cell phones are absolutely everywhere these days.

1148126,AT2L9P49VHVY5,B00151QYOO,Christopher R,"[2, 4]",I am sick of these Hollywood remakes of Japanese horror films.  When the Ring came out I think that most people were genuinely intrigued and held in suspense as the concept was original to most American viewers.  Five or six years later Hollywood has milked this genre dry.They all have the same central theme.  One or several people are brutally killed and a spirit is left behind in our world to continue to rack up the body count.  From there an attractive female star enlists the help of an attractive male assistant to track down the source of the spirit and save both of their lives (and sometimes even the whole world!).It is all the same thing over and over again.  If I wanted to watch a sub-genre of horror films that recycles the same plot dozens of times I would watch another zombie movie.  Do not get me wrong and think that I am condemning zombie movies because I'm actually a huge fan of them.  What I am not a fan of are these glorified ghosts.  Rather than spending several million dollars on multiple ghost movies that are nothing but corny remakes of mediocre Japanese movies they should spend that money on zombie movies.,2,Stop remaking crappy Japanese horror films!,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1142,"['am', 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'When', 'Ring', 'came', 'out', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'genuinely', 'intrigued', 'held', 'suspense', 'concept', 'was', 'original', 'most', 'American', 'viewers', 'Five', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'Hollywood', 'milked', 'genre', 'dry.They', 'have', 'same', 'central', 'theme', 'One', 'several', 'people', 'are', 'brutally', 'killed', 'spirit', 'left', 'world', 'continue', 'rack', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'attractive', 'female', 'star', 'help', 'attractive', 'male', 'assistant', 'track', 'down', 'source', 'spirit', 'save', 'lives', 'sometimes', 'even', 'whole', 'world', '.It', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'wanted', 'watch', 'sub-genre', 'horror', 'films', 'same', 'plot', 'dozens', 'times', 'would', 'watch', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'am', 'condemning', 'zombie', 'movies', ""'m"", 'actually', 'huge', 'fan', 'What', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'are', 'glorified', 'ghosts', 'Rather', 'spending', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'multiple', 'ghost', 'movies', 'are', 'nothing', 'corny', 'remakes', 'mediocre', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'should', 'spend', 'money', 'zombie', 'movies']",N/A

1148129,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00151QYOO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","Subtlety.  It's what makes Japanese horror so effective - and American remakes of same so ineffective.  Japanese horror directors have mastered the art of subtlety, but it's still an alien concept in Hollywood, which explains how a remake that follows the original film's story fairly closely can turn out unrealistic at best - and downright silly at worst.  Hollywood thinks CGI is the answer to everything, especially in horror movies, and I'm at a loss as to explain why they continue to think the C in CGI stands for creepiness when it certainly does not.  You just have to observe this film's potentially creepiest moment, which is thoroughly destroyed by a moment of CGI utter silliness.  Famed director Takashi Miike made Chakushin Ari (One Missed Call), the original Japanese version of this film, one of the creepiest horror movies I had seen in a long time.  Having loved that film so much, and having seen other great J-horror films turned inside out by American directors, I did not have the highest of hopes for this remake.  It actually turned out a little better than I expected - but it's still the palest of reflections of Chakushin Ari.The basic premise of the story is that people start receiving calls on their cell phones recording the moments of their own deaths. The phone calls come from each individual's own cell phone number, feature the same creepy ringtone, and are always dated a day or two in the future, thus revealing the exact time of that person's death. Then, when each such death actually takes place (just as it was recorded on the cell phone messages), someone in the victim's list of saved phone numbers is automatically selected to be the next phone call recipient.  Authorities also find a piece of hard candy in the victims' mouths.  The one person closest to the mystery is Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), who hears the messages and witnesses the deaths of several of her friends.  In one of the most unexplainable casting decisions of all time, Margaret Cho plays the cop who pretty much blows her off.  Fortunately, Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) hears and believes her story; it seems his sister was one of the earlier victims of whatever is going on, so he and Beth team up to try and track these calls back to the source - and to do so before Beth's number comes up (in more ways than one).One of the many things that director Takashi Miike did exceptionally well in Chakushin Ari was to limit the number and scope of ghostly appearances up until the last few scenes of the movie. From the subtle to the in-your-face manifestations, each appearance thus played to maximum effect.  You can forget about that in this remake.  I knew it was going to be a problem when this movie opened with a huge hospital fire, as opposed to the relaxed friendly atmosphere that started Chakushin Ari on its creepy way.  And, as I alluded to, awful CGI effects are strewn everywhere in this movie (doing what was already a rather ambiguous ending no favors).  Perhaps the worst mismanagement of the original script comes when one of Beth's terrified, fated-to-die friends ends up going on a paranormal television show to find protection.  In Chakushin Ari, this made for a surprisingly effective and memorable scene, whereas here you have a televangelist trying to cast out demons from a cell phone.  Sound silly?  It is.The worst thing about One Missed Call is the fact that it denies viewers the thrill of truly enjoying Chakushin Ari at a later date (since you'll already basically know what happens).  The original is one of my favorite horror films of all time, and I would implore viewers to seek out that film before ever casting eyes upon this inferior American remake.",3,Yet another disappointing remake of a truly creepy Japanese original,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,3708,"['Subtlety', 'what', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'so', 'effective', 'American', 'remakes', 'same', 'so', 'ineffective', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'directors', 'have', 'mastered', 'art', 'subtlety', 'still', 'alien', 'concept', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'story', 'fairly', 'closely', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'unrealistic', 'best', 'downright', 'silly', 'worst', 'Hollywood', 'thinks', 'CGI', 'answer', 'everything', 'especially', 'horror', 'movies', ""'m"", 'loss', 'explain', 'why', 'continue', 'think', 'C', 'CGI', 'stands', 'creepiness', 'when', 'certainly', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'observe', 'film', 'potentially', 'creepiest', 'moment', 'thoroughly', 'destroyed', 'moment', 'CGI', 'utter', 'silliness', 'Famed', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'made', 'Chakushin', 'Ari', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film', 'one', 'creepiest', 'horror', 'movies', 'had', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Having', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'having', 'seen', 'other', 'great', 'J-horror', 'films', 'turned', 'out', 'American', 'directors', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'highest', 'hopes', 'remake', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'little', 'better', 'expected', 'still', 'palest', 'reflections', 'Chakushin', 'Ari.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'people', 'start', 'receiving', 'calls', 'cell', 'phones', 'recording', 'moments', 'own', 'deaths', 'phone', 'come', 'individual', 'own', 'cell', 'phone', 'number', 'feature', 'same', 'creepy', 'ringtone', 'are', 'always', 'dated', 'day', 'two', 'future', 'thus', 'revealing', 'exact', 'time', 'person', 'death', 'Then', 'when', 'such', 'death', 'actually', 'place', 'just', 'was', 'recorded', 'cell', 'phone', 'messages', 'someone', 'victim', 'list', 'saved', 'phone', 'numbers', 'automatically', 'selected', 'be', 'next', 'phone', 'call', 'recipient', 'Authorities', 'also', 'find', 'piece', 'hard', 'candy', 'victims', 'mouths', 'one', 'person', 'closest', 'mystery', 'Beth', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'messages', 'deaths', 'several', 'friends', 'one', 'most', 'unexplainable', 'casting', 'decisions', 'time', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'cop', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'off', 'Fortunately', 'Detective', 'Jack', 'Andrews', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'hears', 'story', 'sister', 'was', 'one', 'earlier', 'victims', 'going', 'Beth', 'team', 'up', 'try', 'track', 'calls', 'back', 'source', 'do', 'so', 'Beth', 'number', 'up', 'more', 'ways', 'one', '.One', 'many', 'things', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'did', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Chakushin', 'Ari', 'was', 'limit', 'number', 'scope', 'ghostly', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'subtle', 'in-your-face', 'manifestations', 'appearance', 'thus', 'played', 'maximum', 'effect', 'can', 'forget', 'remake', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'problem', 'when', 'movie', 'opened', 'huge', 'hospital', 'fire', 'opposed', 'relaxed', 'friendly', 'atmosphere', 'started', 'Chakushin', 'Ari', 'creepy', 'way', 'alluded', 'awful', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'strewn', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'favors', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'mismanagement', 'original', 'script', 'when', 'one', 'Beth', 'terrified', 'fated-to-die', 'friends', 'up', 'going', 'paranormal', 'television', 'show', 'find', 'protection', 'Chakushin', 'Ari', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'memorable', 'scene', 'whereas', 'here', 'have', 'televangelist', 'trying', 'cast', 'out', 'demons', 'cell', 'phone', 'Sound', 'silly', 'worst', 'thing', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'fact', 'viewers', 'thrill', 'truly', 'enjoying', 'Chakushin', 'Ari', 'later', 'date', ""'ll"", 'already', 'basically', 'know', 'what', 'original', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'would', 'implore', 'viewers', 'seek', 'out', 'film', 'ever', 'casting', 'eyes', 'inferior', 'American', 'remake']",N/A

Why would a mobile phone kill anyone? Doesn't make sense. How can a mobile phone have an agenda and kill people?"" ~ Aldous SnowWords of the wise.  Sure, the quote fromsomething substantialmight not have poked directly towards this movie, but it certainly fits the bill. The premise for ""One Missed Call"" really was stupid.  What's next: death by GPS, or death by having your name typed on an occult website for grieving victims---oh wait, that last one actually happened.  HOW the premise came to be was the real threshold to this disaster: a ghostly figure kills people by leaving voice messages on their cellphone, hearing their last words before their imminent death two days from now; it goes through one victim after another, all in a manner that reminded me so much like the ""Final Destination"" movies, as well as other Japanese horror remakes.  The reasons behind the ghostly figure and its motivation made no sense.  A cell phone may have multiple contacts, so did it target all of them or only plot-specific characters on the list?  Why does it target its preys and what do they have to do with the ghost's plight?  Why did it need to have the corpse press the phone keys when it was established in the beginning it can do that on its own?  The movie tried its earnest to diverge the quote above (taking off the battery, smashing the phone, and throwing it away doesn't help), but it didn't avoid the obvious one: LEAVE THE PHONE ALONE!The deaths in this movie are shoddy, and personally they were insulting.  I know this is PG-13 so it has to be as tamed as horror can be, but when a victim got pierced by a sharp metal object and no blood came out on both its mouth and the area that was pierced (it was clearly shot, mind you), I had to roll my eyes in disgust.  The movie had a sub-plot about the lead girl's abusive mother, but the story didn't really do anything with it.  Also, the resolution made the entire quest of survival pointless; not uncommon in horror films, but this one is so anticlimactic and forced that I felt like the movie needed to have one more scare.

Horror films like Ju-On: The Grudge, Gin Gwai (The Eye), Kairo (Pulse), and even Rec always seem to be downgraded with standard shock effects and pointless blood & gore. If you have seen these movies back to back (except Rec/Quarantine), then you'll notice the difference. Most of the original foreign versions rely more on atmosphere, while the remakes rely more on shocks effects. One Missed Call is another one that can be considered a failure. It isn't among the worst remakes, but it's still dull and ineffective. Granted, I've seen the original Japanese version, so I knew what was going to happen during the American remake. And watching this movie ""again"" made the experience even worse. But aside from that, the acting is completely terrible (Come on, Edward Burns, you can do better than this!), the scares are nowhere to be found, and the characters are pretty much unlikable. The movie isn't at all a failure: there are a few images that are rather more creative than frightening. Still, this remake of One Missed Call is nothing to be scared about.

1148149,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00151QYOO,Jason,"[14, 20]","In yet another Japanese horror remake, One Missed Call is quite ordinary. It's in the same mold as The Grudge and The Ring, with thrills here and there - mostly of the quiet-then-LOUD variety, a few genuine shock scenes - the creepy visions each victim has, and a touch of ridiculousness - the other 75% of the movie.Essentially, the movie's plot breaks down as a Final Destination meets Alltel's ""My Circle 5"" campaign. When a person gets a voicemail - the call is suspiciously absent - they hear their own voice moments before death. To top it all off, the voicemail is time-date stamped at the time of death. So, if there is a voicemail with a date of 2045, then it's clear for you to laugh in the face of the terror and danger - like I did the entire movie.The main character in the movie, Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), has a collection of friends who one-by-one have received a voicemail letting them know that death is on the way. It begins with a nurse - who happens to be the sister of Jack Andrews (Edward Burns), a detective helping Beth solve the mysterious voicemails, and the original victim of the insidious killer (1). After that, the chain of events has begun. Each death shown on screen is borderline hilarious. At first an arbitrary girl and her stupid cat go scuba diving without gear in a backyard pool (2), then a grotesque blonde gets sent into orbit by a moving train (3), followed by a grungy moron who quickly learns why construction sites require hardhats (4), and finally a bad foreign actress who receives a rear-naked chokehold from one of the ghostly, evil jujitsu-practicing killers (5). Alltel's product placement is now complete.In each situation, the victim receives a notification via voicemail a few days prior to death, giving them time to hallucinate, and generally have psychotic visions of dead people and giant millipedes. If the call and knowledge of an impending death wasn't enough, each victim gets taunted until their last minute and is inexplicably gagged by a large piece of candy post-death (similar to the murders in Silence of the Lambs). Well, all is good until Beth receives the inevitable call; then her search for the answer becomes extremely important.Will Beth and Jack figure it out in time to save Beth's life? You betcha, and it's completely ridiculous as the finale is reached, an inordinate amount of twists are shoved in, and absolutely no answers are gained.There are enough downfalls to this movie that I won't waste time - here's a bullet list:-It's not scary, unless you're a timid 6-year old Japanese girl.-It has a laughable plot that requires not only suspension of disbelief, but also a slight bit of retardation in order to truly become engrossed.-One of the scenes of a green, ""scary"" baby at the end is reminiscent of the B-movie horror classic Ghoulies.-From beginning to end, the movie fails on the horror genre formula, where the person wronged is vindicated and then the story reaches a resolution.-It's almost guaranteed that each viewer will leave the movie hating themself just a little bit for watching yet another Japanese horror flick adaptation that failed to deliver.-Each good looking college-aged student has the same ringtone. In a world of ubiquitous ringtones and downloads, especially amongst college students, to hear the exact same monophonic ringtone over and over is absurd.-The actors, minus Sossamon, are all fairly wooden, and bland, as if they attended the William Shatner school of acting.-There is a barely connected, ludicrous subplot of a troubled little girl who is clearly a ripoff from Poltergeist.-The traumatic childhood experience suffered by Beth is a forced and superflous, and has absolutely no real point.If you, like me, enjoy watching a preposterous horror movie and making jokes all throughout, then this is the right one for you.

A group of college friends are mysteriously dying one by one.  Prior to their death, each one receives a ""1 Missed Call"" message on their cell phone from the last person to die.  Upon listening to this message, they hear their own voice screaming, pleading and begging for help.  Who or what is responsible for these deadly premonitions?Cute-as-a-puppy Edward Burns is famous for his roles in such romantic comedies as ""The Holiday"" and ""Life or Something like It.""  It was a treat to see him portray gutsy Detective Jack Andrews whose sister may have been the first victim of the cell phone curse.  During his investigation, he teams up with psychology student Beth Raymond (played by gorgeous Angelina Jolie look alike Shannyn Sossamon).  The two share great chemistry.  (A love scene between them would've been nice.)  Jack and Beth frantically race against time in an effort to prevent more gruesome deaths, including their own.  As in ""Final Destination,"" death becomes a physical manifestation that appears unstoppable.Now that cell phones outnumber landline phones, a horror film such as ""One Missed Call"" seemed inevitable.

It's called a horror movie but I was laughing during most of it. The only time I was actually a bit creeped out was when I checked my phone and it said that I have One Missed Call. I love the original. I definitely didn't expect to be any good but once in a while everybody wants to see a movie on a long Saturday afternoon that they don't have to think or talk about ever again. But in the end too many words came out of it. I enjoy good movies but I can also appreciate certain bad movies that are good for passing time but ultimately this offers me one missed call too many.As you watch this you will notice a mixture of The Ring and Final Destination, both of the above films are clearly better. The central character is Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), a young student who witnesses more than one of her friend's grisly demises and who appears in line to be a victim despite the disbelief of local authorities (represented largely by Margaret Cho, in a non-comic role). She is finally believed by Det. Jack Andrews (Edward Burns), whose sister died a mysterious death and who joins Beth in searching for answers. Sossamon is competent as the bewildered victim, while Burns adds a certain depth to a fairly nondescript role. Supporting plays include Meagan Good (too short of scene), Ray Wise and Azura Skye.Production design is generally effective; however, the film's score generally is of the garden-variety horror type in which one can easily tell by the music when something bad is going to happen.I always try to refrain from bashing any movie just because I understand that a lot of effort goes into making even the worst movie. I found myself bored most of the movie and again amused at the ""scary"" parts because of how weak it is. I can't really say much about the acting except that its sub par, Ed Burns is the only decent actor in the whole movie. ""One Missed Call"" may very well hold over horror fans desperate for something even remotely near their beloved genre, however, gorehounds and true horror fans are likely to be disappointed. Do yourself a favor watch the Japanese movie ""One Missed Call 2003"", if you don't like subtitles it is dubbed in English plus it's well worth a watch, as far as this movie goes its one call you won't regret missing.",2,1.5--Well at least I wasn't the one who miss a $10 bill in my pocket,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,2330,"['Should', 'talk', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'called', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'laughing', 'most', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'creeped', 'out', 'was', 'when', 'checked', 'phone', 'said', 'have', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'love', 'original', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'good', 'once', 'while', 'everybody', 'see', 'movie', 'long', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'talk', 'ever', 'again', 'end', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'came', 'enjoy', 'good', 'movies', 'can', 'also', 'appreciate', 'certain', 'bad', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'passing', 'time', 'ultimately', 'one', 'missed', 'call', 'too', 'many.As', 'watch', 'will', 'notice', 'mixture', 'Ring', 'Final', 'Destination', 'above', 'films', 'are', 'clearly', 'better', 'central', 'character', 'Beth', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'more', 'one', 'friend', 'grisly', 'demises', 'who', 'line', 'be', 'victim', 'disbelief', 'local', 'authorities', 'represented', 'largely', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'non-comic', 'role', 'finally', 'believed', 'Det', 'Jack', 'Andrews', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'sister', 'died', 'mysterious', 'death', 'who', 'Beth', 'searching', 'answers', 'Sossamon', 'competent', 'bewildered', 'victim', 'Burns', 'certain', 'depth', 'fairly', 'nondescript', 'role', 'Supporting', 'plays', 'include', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'too', 'short', 'scene', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Azura', 'Skye.Production', 'design', 'generally', 'effective', 'however', 'film', 'score', 'generally', 'garden-variety', 'horror', 'type', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'music', 'when', 'something', 'bad', 'going', 'happen.I', 'always', 'try', 'refrain', 'bashing', 'movie', 'just', 'understand', 'lot', 'effort', 'making', 'even', 'worst', 'movie', 'found', 'bored', 'most', 'movie', 'again', 'amused', 'scary', 'parts', 'how', 'weak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'acting', 'sub', 'par', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'only', 'decent', 'actor', 'whole', 'movie', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'hold', 'over', 'horror', 'fans', 'desperate', 'something', 'even', 'remotely', 'beloved', 'genre', 'however', 'gorehounds', 'true', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', '2003', 'do', ""n't"", 'subtitles', 'dubbed', 'English', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'one', 'call', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'missing']",N/A

Each one is different but always has the person during the last brief seconds of their life and gasp each call comes true as they die.Thats about it for the plot, there's the usual collection of idiots including Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon, ""A Knight's Tale"") and a detective named Jack Andrews (Ed Burns, ""Man on a Ledge"") who keeps trying to find out who or what is making these calls and causing the deaths of these people. The deaths are pretty hokey, there's not a lot of horror to it and very few if any scares.Whats laughable is the explanation, the special effects and how there's not one shred of good acting, suspense or decent writing.

1148153,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00151QYOO,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 1]","A remake of a Japanese horror film of the same name, ""One Missed Call"" uses technology and ghosts (as so many of these Japanese films and their American copycats do) in an attempt to generate scares.  And much like many of its predecessors, ""One Missed Call"" does little more than make the viewer wonder why they are sitting through yet another boring techno/ghost flick.In the film, a string of deaths occur that are tied together by cell phones.  The soon-to-be deceased receive a message that plays out their final seconds of life.  Once they have died, their phone dials up the next victim.Luckily for the viewer, ""A Knight's Tale"" starlet Shannyn Sossamon notices the cellular connection and goes hunting for clues in order to prevent the death of her friends and of herself.  Along for the ride in this stale horror is Ed Burns, who plays the only detective who believes Sossamon's story.The entire film is bland.  About the only thing that it has going for it is the eerie tone that is set by the appearance of the ghosts and the visions that victims have before they meet their doom.  Unfortunately for ""One Missed Call,"" this atmospheric effect has been used and abused by Japanese filmmakers (and the Hollywood types who copy them) for a long time.  In other words, if you've watched ""The Grudge,"" ""The Ring,"" or any of the other originals or remakes of any of this genre, you've seen it all before.For some strange reason, Margaret Cho is cast as one of Burns' fellow detectives.  She delivers the poorest acting job in the film, delivering her lines as if she's reading them off of a teleprompter.  This only adds to the ""blah"" feel of this film.No originality, wooden acting, and just downright boring, I don't recommend ""One Missed Call.""

After seeing it, I would say that although it's entirely dissapointing consdering the previews, it is not as bad as people are claiming it to be.The film is about a group of friends that start receiving anonymous messages that tells them the day, hour, and how he/she will die, and whe te time comes, the message becomes true. The film is based on the superior japanese film ""Chakushin ari"" and forms part in the long-running series of japanese remakes that include: The Grudge, The Eye, Pulse, The Ring, etc.I think the film would work better for people that haven't seen the original movie; but those who has, would agree that many elements that make a horror movie scary in this version were gone, there is no tension nor suspense, it lacks on scares (there were at least 2 or 3), and the acting was meh in my opinion (I would consider Shannyn Sossamon's acting as the best). But at least the effects were very well done and in some ways they were very disturbing (most likely in the last act).So I would say that although the effects contributed into making some scenes terrifying, the way the film builds up was very boring and the action starts in the last 30 minutes (deaths aside). The acting couldn't help the movie neither. Now, you could find it scary by watching this movie before the original, but those that had already watched the original and are planning to give this one a shot, I suggest you or to rent it first, or to look for a better horror film.",3,"Meh, Previews were better",1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1675,"['bought', 'film', 'missed', 'cinema', 'tried', 'stay', 'aways', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'trailer', 'was', 'really', 'scary', 'wanted', 'try', 'film', 'seeing', 'would', 'say', 'entirely', 'dissapointing', 'consdering', 'previews', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'claiming', 'be.The', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'start', 'receiving', 'anonymous', 'messages', 'day', 'hour', 'how', 'he/she', 'will', 'die', 'whe', 'te', 'time', 'message', 'true', 'film', 'based', 'superior', 'japanese', 'film', 'Chakushin', 'ari', 'forms', 'part', 'long-running', 'series', 'japanese', 'remakes', 'include', 'Grudge', 'Eye', 'Pulse', 'Ring', 'etc.I', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'who', 'would', 'agree', 'many', 'elements', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'scary', 'version', 'were', 'gone', 'tension', 'suspense', 'scares', 'were', 'least', '2', '3', 'acting', 'was', 'meh', 'opinion', 'would', 'consider', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'acting', 'best', 'least', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'ways', 'were', 'very', 'disturbing', 'most', 'likely', 'last', 'act', '.So', 'would', 'say', 'effects', 'contributed', 'making', 'scenes', 'terrifying', 'way', 'film', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'action', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'deaths', 'aside', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'Now', 'could', 'find', 'scary', 'watching', 'movie', 'original', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'original', 'are', 'planning', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'suggest', 'rent', 'first', 'look', 'better', 'horror', 'film']",N/A

I think that is what has really left a bad taste in so many peoples mouths, and that's the ending of the film.

OK, when I finally got to rent the movie (it seemed to always be out), I was disappointed to discover it was PG-13. So, after disappointing unrated junk like Dead Silence, I went in with very low expectations, and was delightfully surprised. This movie was creepy and tense and had many disturbing images and didn't have to resort to cheap (or expensive) gore effects to tell the story. And that haunting ringtone is still with me! A psych student and a cop race against time to find the source of a cell phone caller who calls intended victims from a dead person's cell with their own voices at their last moments of life...a day or two before it happens. (Yes, it seems that Japanese horror formulas follow the whole I saw/heard this and now have 24 hours to live). I will not spoil the movie with details, but it is very creepy and some of the images are sure nightmare-inducing. If you are bothered by gore but like a scary movie, I recommend this one.

Though the idea was new-ish (premonitions of death are old hat, but this might be the first case of them being delivered via cell phone) it just fails to be the slightest bit scary or even suspenseful.  And when it was all explained at the end I was left with an 'okay, what?' feeling - never a good thing.I don't think there was enough coherency to the plot, which was stretched a bit thin to... well, I don't know why it was so thin.  It could have been more well-developed, more interesting, and still fit the basic premise.  But in trying to shock (the main character's past and the whole nanny-cam revelation) I think they lost whatever momentum they had (which, to be fair, was very little).And despite understanding that you do have to give a little in the logic department when it comes to horror movies, there are too many things that just didn't make sense.  The overriding one being: why?  Evil being evil just isn't that interesting, it's a story you can see played out on the 6 o'clock news.

It's as if they tried to use the ""tortured soul who must overcome a personal fear"" concept often used by Alfred Hitchcock.  It was a shallow attempt to make their film somehow meaningful.I often like Asian influenced horror films as I just like their look and the American star usually do a decent job, but this is a disaster from the opening sequence.

1148183,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00151QYOO,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","In ""One Missed Call"" a group of young Americans receive a strange message. It is a voicemail apparently recorded by themselves at the moment of their own deaths that will happen in a few days. The premise is surely unbelievable, even absurd at times, but still interesting, I admit, but you have to be very careful in turning it into a film because this kind of story becomes silly on screen pretty easily. Sadly this is exactly what happens in the remake version of ""One Missed Call.""Shannyn Sossamon is Beth, whose friends start to die in a bizarre way one after another. With a help from a police detective (Ed Burns), she tries to find out the truths behind the cursed calls, and stop the chain of deaths once and for all.So far, so good. The problem with ""One Missed Call"" is that everything these characters say and do looks very silly. I cannot reveal too much about the details, but all you have to know is that none of the characters act rationally. One example: while terribly scared, all the would-be victims prefer to be alone. Also, it is not thrilling to see again the clich&eacute;d horror techniques like watching shadows silently moving. And the film's latter part and conclusion is just a mess.As you know, this is a remake of the 2003 Japanese horror of the same title directed by Takashi Miike. The idea of a curse transmitted through cell phones had already become familiar by the time the original was released (Hollywood version of ""The Ring"" was released in October 2002 in USA). Considering this fact, Miike did a fine job, toning down his usual over-the-top directing style to create several chilly set-pieces.Unfortunately French-born director Eric Valette seems not to know what he really wants to do. The 2008 remake doesn't have enough gore or violence (that is not bad itself); it doesn't have atmosphere, twists and turns in story, dark humor or witty cultural references or social satire. (Miike did include all of them in his original.) New ""One Missed Call"" has none of them. The remake (first half especially) only copies its source material scene by scene without adding anything, and that is neither original nor scary.",2,Yet Another Not-So-Scary J-Horror Remake,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,2157,"['One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'group', 'young', 'Americans', 'receive', 'strange', 'message', 'voicemail', 'apparently', 'recorded', 'moment', 'own', 'deaths', 'will', 'happen', 'few', 'days', 'premise', 'surely', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'times', 'still', 'interesting', 'admit', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'turning', 'film', 'kind', 'story', 'becomes', 'silly', 'screen', 'pretty', 'easily', 'Sadly', 'exactly', 'what', 'remake', 'version', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'Beth', 'friends', 'start', 'die', 'bizarre', 'way', 'one', 'help', 'police', 'detective', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'find', 'out', 'truths', 'cursed', 'calls', 'stop', 'chain', 'deaths', 'once', 'all.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'problem', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'everything', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'looks', 'very', 'silly', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'details', 'have', 'know', 'none', 'characters', 'act', 'rationally', 'One', 'example', 'terribly', 'scared', 'would-be', 'victims', 'prefer', 'be', 'alone', 'Also', 'not', 'thrilling', 'see', 'again', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror', 'techniques', 'watching', 'shadows', 'silently', 'moving', 'film', 'latter', 'part', 'conclusion', 'just', 'mess.As', 'know', 'remake', '2003', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'same', 'title', 'directed', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'idea', 'curse', 'transmitted', 'cell', 'phones', 'had', 'already', 'become', 'familiar', 'time', 'original', 'was', 'released', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Ring', 'was', 'released', 'October', '2002', 'USA', 'Considering', 'fact', 'Miike', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'toning', 'down', 'usual', 'over-the-top', 'directing', 'style', 'create', 'several', 'chilly', 'set-pieces.Unfortunately', 'French-born', 'director', 'Eric', 'Valette', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'do', '2008', 'remake', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'gore', 'violence', 'not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'have', 'atmosphere', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'dark', 'humor', 'witty', 'cultural', 'references', 'social', 'satire', 'Miike', 'did', 'include', 'original', 'New', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'none', 'remake', 'first', 'half', 'especially', 'only', 'source', 'material', 'scene', 'scene', 'adding', 'anything', 'original', 'scary']",N/A
