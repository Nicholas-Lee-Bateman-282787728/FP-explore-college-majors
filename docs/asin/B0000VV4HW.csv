Whether this is a substantiated case or a feigned condition is my first thought???  If a person hates themselves and who they are enough is it possible they would establish a new identity to be someone new???  This movie raises a lot of questions in my mind.  Terri Garr perhaps over plays her role, but I don't feel like it was an authentic portrayal of the case.  I can't explain why exactly, but it just doesn't convince me.",2,Con Game or REAL???,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,539,"['Dissociative', 'Disorder', 'decision', 'deep', 'down', 'psyche', 'person', 'one', 'really', 'substantiated', 'case', 'feigned', 'condition', 'first', 'thought', 'person', 'who', 'are', 'enough', 'possible', 'would', 'establish', 'new', 'identity', 'be', 'someone', 'new', 'movie', 'lot', 'questions', 'mind', 'Terri', 'Garr', 'perhaps', 'plays', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'exactly', 'just', ""n't"", 'convince']",Stranger in the Family

I finally went on to watch something else.

Terri Garr over acted as usual while Neil Patrick Harris was okay in a part that could have been better written.
