Filled with empathy and good humor, the title character (a lisping Shane Jacobson) frames the prima donnas he meets who easily show how much people take for his indispensable (sorry!) work for granted.  There's a lot of poop to contend in his life (in more ways than one), but the film takes an even keel when Kenny goes to a bathroom rental convention in Nashville, Tennessee where he meets a warm and engaging stewardess.  Yes, there's potty humor for sure, but so much more!A J.P.'s Pick 3*'s =Good",3,Walking in Another Man's Filthy Boots,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,687,"['Australian', 'indie', 'film', 'following', 'boots', 'easy-going', 'port-o-rental', 'worker', 'day-to-day', 'struggle', 'more', 'about', 'filth', 'people', 'attitudes', 'Filled', 'empathy', 'good', 'humor', 'title', 'character', 'lisping', 'Shane', 'Jacobson', 'prima', 'donnas', 'who', 'easily', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'take', 'indispensable', 'sorry', 'work', 'granted', 'lot', 'poop', 'contend', 'life', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'film', 'even', 'keel', 'when', 'Kenny', 'bathroom', 'rental', 'convention', 'Nashville', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'warm', 'engaging', 'stewardess', 'Yes', 'potty', 'humor', 'sure', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '3*', '=Good']",Kenny

So it's no suprise this comedy hit was independently funded completely outside the poisonous aussie film industry system. And Kenny is easily the best Aussie comedy in 10 years. If your going to make a film about a toliet plumber this is the way to do it. A simple, well told feel good movie with charming characters.Plus it's bloody hilarious!! Gags galore and trenchant character humour make 'Kenny' a riot.It's all driven by a brilliant performance by Shane Jacobsen as 'Kenny' not only does he pump out the terrific one liners with great comic timing, he's got the kind of appeal that instantly charms an audience.Also brilliant is Kenny's ghastly old father (Played by Shane's father Ron-right up there with such nightmare screen dad's as Frank Costanza, Frank Barone and Cotton Hill) he's a bitter old curmugeon who'd be utterly detestable if it weren't for the fact the fact that he's also damn funny.And Kenny's co-workers are a bunch of all too familiar eccentrics that provide plenty of laughs and some killer slapstick. Just to top it offthere's a nice romantic subplot that's deftly handled.The plot is probably a little thin in places, but it doesn't matter a hoop, Kenny's one of the only recent Aussie movies that is a sure fire crowd pleaser.

Kenny appears to be a bit rough around the edges but he is a funny person that leads a unique lifestyle installing port-a-loos. The humor is mostly toilet related humor but it's understated and mostly revolves around the way people stereotype him and the strange situations that his job gets him into (saving the port-a-loos from Nascar fans).The interviews with Kenny are very candid and his support cast are great. I especially liked Kenny's relationship with his family and how they give him so much strife about ""not having a real job"" and he just takes it. It certainly makes his romance with the flight attendant who accepts him for who he is, more genuine.

Kenny is funny, sure, but he's also a decent bloke trying to make an honest living, and he carries himself with a certain amount of dignity and grace as he goes about his job.  We should all try to be more like Kenny.  He knows his job is distasteful to just about everybody, but he refuses to apologize for it or feel belittled by his choice of profession.  After all, he performs a valuable service, that let's face it, everybody is going to need sooner or later.Kenny handles his ex-wife and mean-spirited father with an almost zen-like calm, as well as annoying co-workers and whiny, uppity people at public events (where he's working).  The acting is so top-notch, I really believed I was watching a documentary all the way through, I just couldn't believe that Kenny wasn't the real deal.  Also, the convention in Nashville was a real convention, wasn't it?

1176247,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001CDR1F6,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Kenny"" was a big hit in Australia, where it was made by the Jacobson brothers: Clayton, who writes, directs, and produces, and Shane, who writes, produces, and stars as Kenny Smyth, port-a-potty man. This s a mockumentary deliberately made to look amateurish, so it doesn't' suffer for its low budget and handheld camera. The brothers' father Ronald Jacobson and Clayton's wife and son are in the film as well, so it seems like a family project. Kenny is an unassuming, easy-going employee of Splashdown, a company that furnishes ""corporate bathroom rentals"". He speaks frankly about the life and work of a man who plumbs poo for a living to a documentary film crew that follows him to all kinds of events that need potties and, finally, to a big Pumper and Cleaner Expo in the USA.I don't think I've ever seen a greater burden put on one actor to carry a movie. Kenny is at the center of every scene. His blunt talk and surprisingly good nature combine to make him a lovable working class hero. Director Clayton Jacobson has found a way to get good dialogue in a loosely scripted film, and that is to tell the actors what the character says in general terms and let them put it in their own words. Shane Jacobson is a veteran of the stage and conveys an almost hyper-genuineness in his manner and speech. Many of the other actors are non-professionals. And Splashdown is a real company. Its owner really is Glenn Preusker, and we see real employees in the film. Kenny's not real, but his friendliness and gift for understatement are enormously appealing.The DVD (Xenon 2008): There are 16 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""The Making of Kenny"" (44 min) is a full-featured documentary that interviews the Jacobsons, their family, cast, and others about the film and its appeal, from the project's conception to its warm reception in Australia. ""Post Production"" (5 min) is about editing and recording the sound. ""Directing in Nashville"" (9 min) joins the cast and crew filming in the US. The director talks about working with non-actors and filming on locations. ""Shootin the Sh*% with the Cast and Crew"" (6 min) are outtakes. The audio commentary is with Clayton Jacobson and Shane Jacobson in the character of Kenny, so it is a sort of continuation of the film. The film is optionally subtitled in English to help with the accents and the fact that Kenny slurs a bit.",4,Mockumentary That's Funnier Than the Real Thing but No Less Genuine.,1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,2415,"['Kenny', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'Australia', 'where', 'was', 'made', 'Jacobson', 'brothers', 'Clayton', 'who', 'directs', 'Shane', 'who', 'produces', 'stars', 'Kenny', 'Smyth', 'port-a-potty', 'man', 'mockumentary', 'deliberately', 'made', 'look', 'amateurish', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'low', 'budget', 'handheld', 'camera', 'brothers', 'father', 'Ronald', 'Jacobson', 'Clayton', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'project', 'Kenny', 'unassuming', 'easy-going', 'employee', 'Splashdown', 'company', 'corporate', 'bathroom', 'rentals', 'frankly', 'life', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'poo', 'living', 'documentary', 'film', 'crew', 'kinds', 'events', 'need', 'potties', 'finally', 'big', 'Pumper', 'Cleaner', 'Expo', 'USA.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'greater', 'burden', 'put', 'one', 'actor', 'carry', 'movie', 'Kenny', 'center', 'scene', 'blunt', 'talk', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'nature', 'combine', 'make', 'lovable', 'working', 'class', 'hero', 'Director', 'Clayton', 'Jacobson', 'found', 'way', 'get', 'good', 'dialogue', 'loosely', 'scripted', 'film', 'tell', 'actors', 'what', 'character', 'general', 'terms', 'let', 'put', 'own', 'words', 'Shane', 'Jacobson', 'veteran', 'stage', 'conveys', 'almost', 'hyper-genuineness', 'manner', 'speech', 'Many', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'non-professionals', 'Splashdown', 'real', 'company', 'owner', 'really', 'Glenn', 'Preusker', 'see', 'real', 'employees', 'film', 'Kenny', 'not', 'real', 'friendliness', 'gift', 'understatement', 'are', 'enormously', 'appealing.The', 'DVD', 'Xenon', '2008', 'are', '16', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '4', 'featurettes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Making', 'Kenny', '44', 'min', 'full-featured', 'documentary', 'Jacobsons', 'family', 'cast', 'others', 'film', 'appeal', 'project', 'conception', 'warm', 'reception', 'Australia', 'Post', 'Production', '5', 'min', 'editing', 'recording', 'sound', 'Directing', 'Nashville', '9', 'min', 'cast', 'crew', 'filming', 'US', 'director', 'talks', 'working', 'non-actors', 'filming', 'locations', 'Shootin', 'Sh*', '%', 'Cast', 'Crew', '6', 'min', 'are', 'outtakes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Clayton', 'Jacobson', 'Shane', 'Jacobson', 'character', 'Kenny', 'sort', 'continuation', 'film', 'film', 'optionally', 'subtitled', 'English', 'help', 'accents', 'fact', 'Kenny', 'slurs', 'bit']",Kenny

And he is so shrewd and wry in his insights into human nature that he emerges as nothing short of a philosopher/poet for the common man.In the end, the movie itself becomes a moving and uplifting paean to the dedicated worker who takes pride in his job, and who demonstrates that pride by doing it better than anyone else - no matter what it happens to be.""Kenny"" might have been even better had it been an actual documentary about a real person - but we'll settle for artfully crafted facsimile this time around.",4,The Citizen Kane of poo humor,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1256,"['Plenty', 'comedies', 'moment', 'desperation', 'have', 'turned', 'occasional', 'poop', 'joke', 'elicit', 'laughs', 'ENTIRE', 'film', 'based', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'scatological', 'humor', 'Well', 'something', 'else', 'again', 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'Kenny', 'Australian', 'mockumentary', 'professional', 'plumber', 'who', 'porta', 'potties', 'large-scale', 'outdoor', 'events', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'endearing', 'subject', 'excrement', 'can', 'become', 'when', 'placed', 'right', 'hands.In', 'case', 'hands', 'belong', 'comedian', 'Shane', 'Jacobson', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'plays', 'Kenny', 'Smyth', 'dude', 'who', 'relentlessly', 'cheerful', 'optimistic', 'good-natured', 'face', 'crap', 'literal', 'figurative', 'life', 'throws', 'so', 'shrewd', 'wry', 'insights', 'human', 'nature', 'nothing', 'short', 'philosopher/poet', 'common', 'man.In', 'end', 'movie', 'moving', 'uplifting', 'paean', 'dedicated', 'worker', 'who', 'pride', 'job', 'who', 'pride', 'doing', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'what', 'be', 'Kenny', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'actual', 'documentary', 'real', 'person', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'artfully', 'crafted', 'time', 'around']",Kenny
