Conk Adams willingly expresses his emotions.Hereis a story of two fragile people drawn together on a murder case that soon becomes something else entirely and they become close. Not really lovers but more than friends and share an emotional bond.The ending came as a total surprise, so simple it should have been expected but you are so involved in what is happening you don't even think of what is to come until it happens.There is no real "" Happy Ever After "" here only a bittersweet release.

It is paced slowly, contemplatively, so that the viewer can absorb of the implications of the story as the drama unfolds. It's a murder mystery, yes, but it goes where few in this genre are willing to go - to search out the very marrow of death and its significance.Roy Dupuis delivers a characteristically excellent and nuanced performance as a detective, struggling with his own demons whilst attempting to solve a 150-year-old murder. Jane McGregor is adequate in her role as the archaeologist brought on to the case who has a secret of her own.It's a thoughtful, careful movie, beautifully filmed. Particularly gratifying is the use of doubling (ok, this isn't a technical term, but then, I'm not a film scholar, just an enthusiast). Robert Budreau excellently parallels the personal struggles of his protagonists by seamlessly shifting the story lines with visual cues.The only flaw I found was that the soundtrack was at times overwrought, overpowering the performance of the actors.

1088350,A7JCLD719XPOB,B000T28PV0,Norman Zoe,"[0, 0]","That Beautiful Somewhere"" is a Canadian film from 2006, shot in North Bay and Temagami, Ontario. It's part mystery and part love story. I don't mean ""mystery"" in the conventional sense, but in the sense that the film has a mysterious ambiance and there's a mysterious death, albeit from the distant past. The plot revolves around some remains found in a marsh with supposed healing powers, the archaeologist and cop assigned to the case, and some Native Americans.The reason I bought the DVD is because the cover makes it look like a film I'd like. I do like it, but not enough to give it anything more than a 6/10 rating. The locations, cinematography, acting and overall atmosphere of the film are top-rate, but certain factors in the story pull down my rating. The biggest being the ending and its sudden surprise; it destroys what was building up to that point.I guess if you reflect on it, though, it all makes sense and there's some spiritual typology.What I like most is the film's mysterious and beautiful aura. There's a palpable reverence. Plus I enjoy seeing this remote part of Canada. But the story -- while okay -- isn't all that compelling and the ending does it in.Still, it's not bad.

While the film expertly dissects the two leads and their minds and motives, it unfortunately takes its time to delve into the complex character development and often lingers on every moment, no matter its degree of poignancy, creating a cumbersome pacing that may be too slow for today's less-than-patient moviegoer.Detective Conk Adams (Roy Dupuis) is assigned to help young archaeologist Catherine Nyland (Jane McGregor) discover the identity and cause of death of a mummified body found in a local bog in the snowy depths of Canada. At first he disregards the scientist's notions of the bog's curative powers and the supposed murder, but soon grows to value and appreciate the time he spends with her. After running several tests on the corpse, Catherine slowly begins to uncover its identity and searches for the truth behind the myths of the Native American healing ritual that may have lead to its death. Wishing to use the healing powers of the bog herself, she and Conk track down a reclusive Indian who holds the final clues to the body's identity as well as the shocking path that both tortured souls will eventually travel.Beautifully shot exteriors and snowy forested scenery almost make up for the dragging pace the film chooses to adopt. While the presentation is top notch, the film crawls at times and makes several attempts to go somewhere beautiful, and then doesn't. In the quest to understand life, death, love, and sacrifice, the two characters build to the drastic conclusion with great detail and concern, but the philosophies of the Native American healing ritual hold little weight with the reasoning behind the characters' decisions.Roy Dupuis portrays the haunted detective with mature finesse and a gruff disposition, creating a performance as convincing as it is compelling. Jane McGregor plays off the troubled soul with an equally tormented character but doesn't quite capture the intensity of the disturbed detective. While revealing the beliefs surrounding an ancient ritual, the ideals and sacrifices required betray a certain believability which is difficult to accept, though the characters are at an edge of desperation that can only be quelled by the dire tasks placed before them.A flawed yet noble exploration of the human condition, That Beautiful Somewhere reveals bits of truly stunning emotion, yet its deliberate pacing may offset those unable to wait for its deeply moving ending that offers a compelling look into the lengths some will go for forgiveness and redemption.- The Massie Twins",3,That Beautiful Somewhere Movie Review by The Massie Twins,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2776,"['haunting', 'tale', 'tormented', 'characters', 'plagued', 'pasts', 'secrets', 'consuming', 'Beautiful', 'Somewhere', 'two', 'troubled', 'souls', 'struggling', 'find', 'meaning', 'lives', 'way', 'heal', 'physical', 'mental', 'pain', 'film', 'expertly', 'two', 'leads', 'minds', 'motives', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'delve', 'complex', 'character', 'development', 'often', 'lingers', 'moment', 'matter', 'degree', 'poignancy', 'creating', 'cumbersome', 'pacing', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'today', 'less-than-patient', 'moviegoer.Detective', 'Conk', 'Adams', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'assigned', 'help', 'young', 'archaeologist', 'Catherine', 'Nyland', 'Jane', 'McGregor', 'discover', 'identity', 'cause', 'death', 'mummified', 'body', 'found', 'local', 'bog', 'snowy', 'depths', 'Canada', 'first', 'scientist', 'notions', 'bog', 'curative', 'powers', 'supposed', 'murder', 'soon', 'grows', 'value', 'appreciate', 'time', 'running', 'several', 'tests', 'corpse', 'Catherine', 'slowly', 'uncover', 'identity', 'searches', 'truth', 'myths', 'Native', 'American', 'healing', 'ritual', 'may', 'have', 'lead', 'death', 'Wishing', 'use', 'healing', 'powers', 'bog', 'herself', 'Conk', 'track', 'down', 'reclusive', 'Indian', 'who', 'final', 'clues', 'body', 'identity', 'as', 'well', 'shocking', 'path', 'tortured', 'souls', 'will', 'eventually', 'travel.Beautifully', 'shot', 'exteriors', 'snowy', 'forested', 'scenery', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'dragging', 'pace', 'film', 'adopt', 'presentation', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'crawls', 'times', 'several', 'attempts', 'go', 'somewhere', 'beautiful', 'then', ""n't"", 'quest', 'understand', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'two', 'characters', 'build', 'drastic', 'conclusion', 'great', 'detail', 'concern', 'philosophies', 'Native', 'American', 'healing', 'ritual', 'hold', 'little', 'weight', 'reasoning', 'characters', 'decisions.Roy', 'Dupuis', 'haunted', 'detective', 'mature', 'finesse', 'gruff', 'disposition', 'creating', 'performance', 'as', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'Jane', 'McGregor', 'troubled', 'soul', 'equally', 'tormented', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'intensity', 'disturbed', 'detective', 'revealing', 'beliefs', 'surrounding', 'ancient', 'ritual', 'ideals', 'sacrifices', 'required', 'certain', 'believability', 'difficult', 'accept', 'characters', 'are', 'edge', 'desperation', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'quelled', 'dire', 'tasks', 'placed', 'them.A', 'flawed', 'yet', 'noble', 'exploration', 'human', 'condition', 'Beautiful', 'Somewhere', 'bits', 'truly', 'stunning', 'emotion', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'may', 'offset', 'unable', 'wait', 'deeply', 'moving', 'ending', 'compelling', 'look', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'forgiveness', 'redemption.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",That Beautiful Somewhere

Unfortunately none of it came together for me.  I didn't really care about the female lead and her ""mysterious illness"" which turns out to be not so mysterious, the scenes with the native american indians are cheesy and overly dramatic, the storyline was jerky and implausible.On the good side, I liked how the story of the two leads, the young female scientist and the older jaded poiice detective and their personal tragedies wove together - if they had only focused on that - but alas - someone had the great idea to try to make this a love story and here is where the movie goes horribly awry.  I was wondering where the relationship was going and when it finally got to their embrace I wanted to scream out ""NOOOOOOO"" and cover the screen - it just felt so not right and forced.Roy as usual gives a touching and nuanced performance - his counterpart in the female lead just cannot come close to meeting his talent.  If they had only reshot the film and left the romance parts on the cutting room floor this movie might have gone somewhere - or perhaps with a different lead actress who could be more sympathetic in the role - as it was I didn't give a hoot about her illness and wanted her scenes to end more quickly so we could get back to the really interesting story line of the detective struggling with a huge personal decision of his own.Recommended for Roy Dupuis fans as you will not be dispointed in his performance - but the rest of it left me lukewarm at best.",2,Roy Dupuis doesn't disappoint - the rest of the movie does...,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1689,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'Canadian', 'Frech', 'working', 'actors', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'bog', 'bodies', 'native', 'american', 'indians', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'Northern', 'Canada', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'came', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'female', 'lead', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'mysterious', 'scenes', 'native', 'american', 'indians', 'are', 'cheesy', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'storyline', 'was', 'jerky', 'implausible.On', 'good', 'side', 'liked', 'how', 'story', 'two', 'leads', 'young', 'female', 'scientist', 'older', 'jaded', 'poiice', 'detective', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'wove', 'together', 'had', 'only', 'focused', 'alas', 'someone', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'try', 'make', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'horribly', 'awry', 'was', 'wondering', 'where', 'relationship', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'embrace', 'wanted', 'scream', 'out', 'NOOOOOOO', 'cover', 'screen', 'just', 'felt', 'so', 'not', 'right', 'forced.Roy', 'usual', 'touching', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'counterpart', 'female', 'lead', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'meeting', 'talent', 'had', 'only', 'film', 'left', 'romance', 'parts', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'somewhere', 'perhaps', 'different', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'hoot', 'illness', 'wanted', 'scenes', 'end', 'more', 'quickly', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'really', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'detective', 'struggling', 'huge', 'personal', 'decision', 'own.Recommended', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dispointed', 'performance', 'rest', 'left', 'lukewarm', 'best']",That Beautiful Somewhere
