The great thing about this is the pacing- just when you think you're about to die, she takes it down a notch to strength or ab moves so you can catch your breath, and then kicks it right back up. That being said, every move is a cardio move if you do it correctly. It's a great way to jump start your fitness routine without feeling overwhelmed. The commentary gets a little annoying, but you can choose the ""workout with music only"" option and that solves the problem.I haven't seen any dramatic results, but I am feeling better and gradually mastering the moves.

Jillian really pushes and motivates you, and that kept me going through my fitness journey at the beginning, which is when faltering often occurs. I know some people dislike her 'tough trainer' attitude, but it can be very motivating for others! The moves in this workout are very athletic and easy to follow; there's no tricky choreography, just a lot of very effective plyometric and calisthenic moves, all using your own body weight. Because of the very basic nature of the moves, it doesn't require a lot of space either, which is a huge pro for me working out in my small studio. (Though my neighbors probably don't appreciate the plyometric nature of Jillian's moves!)After a few weeks of doing this video, some moves became too easy, so I added 5-lb handweights.

By the 14-minute mark, I'm pretty sweaty, so I feel like I'm getting a good workout.Pros:  It's easy to follow and straight-forward.  There are no crazy moves.  There are also two other people in the video besides Jillian Michaels, so if you need to slow it down a bit or really ramp it up, you know who to watch.  I love the interval training - each segment has 3-4 exercise routines, and after running through them once you come back to them at the end of the segment.

1219798,A16NQF4IUGU29B,B001NFNFN0,Beachbabe1984,"[18, 21]","This was my first experience with a Jillian Michaels workout DVD and I was very impressed!  I work out regularly and consider myself in pretty good shape, but this DVD left me dripping with sweat (it was actually the first time I've gotten sweat dripping into my eyes...).  I was especially excited about how much energy I had after doing the workout.  Unlike the other 99% of the universe, a lot of workouts leave me tired and wanting to sit on my butt.  However, this workout left me feeling on top of the world!The workout starts off with a quick warm-up and then heads into seven 6 minute circuits which use kickboxing moves, plyometrics, and a fair amount of core work.  In each circuit, you repeat the set of exercises twice.  You don't need any equipment (well, maybe a sports bra...) which is great for those who haven't built up much of a home gym.  However, there is quite a lot of jumping, so this workout is maybe not for everyone (bad joints beware).  You don't get any real breaks in this workout beyond a quick 5 seconds to catch your breath occasionally.  The first time I did this DVD I had to pause a few times to get water.  However, having done it a few more times, it's gotten easier to push through the whole thing.  She does a nice cool-down with some stretching at the end, where you really start to feel great after a very tough 45 minutes.I know some people have mentioned that they found Jillian to be too abrasive.  Personally, I found her quite motivating - sure, she tells you to push yourself, but it's usually at those points where you're considering giving up.  I also really like how she counts down the last few of every move so you know how much longer you have to hang in there for.  She also provides beginner and advanced modifications for a good number of the moves, so you can really work at your own level of ability.  Each time I do the workout, I push myself a little bit harder than the last time - there's always room to improve.My only issue with the DVD was the bonus section.  There's a segment where Jillian gives lifestyle tips - I decided to watch and see if she had any interesting tips that might help me out.  Well, it turned out to be a push to buy an Oral B Vitality toothbrush.  As a dental professional, I don't really like seeing oral health reduced to a black and white picture (they're basically saying that if you use a power toothbrush, you don't get cavities, which is not necessarily true...I could go on all day...).  Anyway, it just kind of rubbed me to the wrong way to get company sponsored dental advice after a good workout experience.Advertisements aside, I felt this was a really fantastic workout.  I've noticed the flabby areas on my thighs and butt have gotten a lot tighter and all my clothes are fitting a little looser.

1219801,A8KWNRQPZLAXC,B001NFNFN0,Bette,"[3, 3]","Most of Jillian's fans came to this dvd circa its 2009 release date, but I just became a Jillian convert 5 months ago, using BFBM, NMTZ, 30DS and SIWW.  I had never before seen an episode of The Biggest Loser, so I had no idea what to expect. I just knew her reputation as a tough trainer.Since it matters, I will say that I have been losing weight for over a decade. That's right - 11 years, to be exact. No gastric bypass or any other magical surgery.  I got my butt to the gym and JUST DID IT!  (Previously I was swimming laps for weight loss, but because it is not a weight bearing exercise, once you plateau, swimming's effectiveness is over. I would do laps for over an hour and it was getting me nothing but bad headaches. But swimming is still a good kickstart for someone who is overweight.)  I started out on the elliptical and went low carb. I began walking 2 miles, then 3, then 5, now it's up to 10 if I want.  I'm a Zumba instructor and a hiker.  While I am no longer 300 lbs, 88% body fat (some crazy high number when they tested me at a gym long ago) and a size 28/30, I'm still not a skinny girl.  It has taken me a LONG TIME to lose the weight, but that's a good thing - this was more of a commitment than I ever knew, and once you get to the 5th year and it's not all done with, you realize you've committed to a lifestyle change, and not just to losing the weight.  After the Zumba convention this year I hit yet another plateau.  Someone mentioned 30 Day Shred in a Facebook group and I went with it!All of that to let you know that I am not a size 10, yet I am very physically capable, my only real limits being lower back and knee issues if I am not careful.  So...BFBM is challenging for me, every time.  I don't get through it as fast as they do (45+ mins) because I need longer breaks to allow my lower back to rest, otherwise my muscles tense up and my back will go out.  I'm still challenging myself, still working at an increased pace, still sweating, but always remaining tuned into my body or else face consequences.  If you have lower back issues, I suggest you do the same.  However, out of all of JM's workouts that I have done so far, this one is the most lower-back and knee-friendly.  There's impact but no lunging, which typically bothers my knees.  Many of the ab moves are standing rather than mat work - still challenging, but not stressing.  There are some great kickbox moves, which I love.Overall, I skip only a couple of exercises in BFBM.  Anything ski-like is bound to stress my lower back, so I skip those.  But you'd be surprised how much you can do, even if you're overweight to begin with.  Do not let plank moves such as mountain climbers and oblique twists intimidate you - they are challenging at first, but if you keep pushing yourself, you will increase your abilities.  Do what you can at first, and do not give up!  If you keep at it, your body will become accustomed to it and eventually you will actually find some of these moves pleasurable.I like Jillian's interactions with the other girls, and ""instructor speak"" in most of her videos.  She's a fun personality overall, and she's encouraging.  ""Push yourself. Don't phone it in.""  The other girls provide modified moves for beginners as well as the advanced ""kickass"" version of the moves.  No one is left out here.  I'm not saying it's going to be easy at first - it wasn't easy for me, and I can do hours of Zumba with no problem, and hike and walk several miles.  It's just a different kind of workout, very intense, little rest, always moving.Try it and keep at it.  Do not give up - you will see changes in your body right away, and you will keep losing weight/getting fit as you progress because you will be able to do more, faster, better, quicker within months.  With Jillian's dvds I beat yet another plateau, and people comment that they notice my weight loss, even if it has only been a month since they last saw me.  But you cannot just do BFBM for the rest of your life - mix it up with other workouts to keep seeing changes.",5,Super cardio workout,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,4052,"['Most', 'Jillian', 'fans', 'came', 'dvd', '2009', 'release', 'date', 'just', 'became', 'Jillian', 'convert', '5', 'months', 'ago', 'using', 'BFBM', 'NMTZ', '30DS', 'SIWW', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'episode', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'just', 'knew', 'reputation', 'tough', 'trainer.Since', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'losing', 'weight', 'decade', 'right', '11', 'years', 'be', 'exact', 'gastric', 'bypass', 'other', 'magical', 'surgery', 'got', 'butt', 'gym', 'JUST', 'DID', 'IT', 'Previously', 'was', 'swimming', 'laps', 'weight', 'loss', 'not', 'weight', 'bearing', 'exercise', 'once', 'plateau', 'swimming', 'effectiveness', 'would', 'do', 'laps', 'hour', 'was', 'getting', 'nothing', 'bad', 'headaches', 'swimming', 'still', 'good', 'kickstart', 'someone', 'who', 'overweight', 'started', 'out', 'elliptical', 'went', 'low', 'carb', 'began', 'walking', '2', 'miles', 'then', '3', 'then', '5', 'now', '10', 'want', ""'m"", 'Zumba', 'instructor', 'hiker', 'am', 'no', 'longer', '300', 'lbs', '88', '%', 'body', 'fat', 'crazy', 'high', 'number', 'when', 'tested', 'gym', 'long', 'ago', 'size', '28/30', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'skinny', 'girl', 'taken', 'LONG', 'TIME', 'lose', 'weight', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'more', 'commitment', 'ever', 'knew', 'once', 'get', '5th', 'year', 'not', 'done', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'lifestyle', 'change', 'not', 'just', 'losing', 'weight', 'Zumba', 'convention', 'year', 'hit', 'yet', 'plateau', 'Someone', 'mentioned', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'Facebook', 'group', 'went', 'let', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'size', '10', 'yet', 'am', 'very', 'physically', 'capable', 'only', 'real', 'limits', 'being', 'lower', 'back', 'knee', 'issues', 'am', 'not', 'careful', 'So', 'BFBM', 'challenging', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'fast', 'do', '45+', 'mins', 'need', 'longer', 'breaks', 'allow', 'lower', 'back', 'rest', 'otherwise', 'muscles', 'tense', 'up', 'back', 'will', 'go', 'out', ""'m"", 'still', 'challenging', 'still', 'working', 'increased', 'pace', 'still', 'sweating', 'always', 'remaining', 'tuned', 'body', 'else', 'face', 'consequences', 'have', 'lower', 'back', 'issues', 'suggest', 'do', 'same', 'However', 'JM', 'workouts', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'lower-back', 'knee-friendly', 'impact', 'lunging', 'typically', 'bothers', 'knees', 'Many', 'ab', 'moves', 'are', 'standing', 'rather', 'mat', 'work', 'still', 'challenging', 'not', 'stressing', 'are', 'great', 'kickbox', 'moves', 'love.Overall', 'skip', 'only', 'couple', 'exercises', 'BFBM', 'Anything', 'ski-like', 'bound', 'stress', 'lower', 'back', 'skip', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'even', ""'re"", 'overweight', 'begin', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'plank', 'moves', 'such', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'oblique', 'twists', 'intimidate', 'are', 'challenging', 'first', 'keep', 'pushing', 'will', 'increase', 'abilities', 'Do', 'what', 'can', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'keep', 'body', 'will', 'become', 'accustomed', 'eventually', 'will', 'actually', 'find', 'moves', 'pleasurable.I', 'Jillian', 'interactions', 'other', 'girls', 'instructor', 'speak', 'most', 'videos', 'fun', 'personality', 'overall', 'encouraging', 'Push', 'Do', ""n't"", 'phone', 'other', 'girls', 'provide', 'modified', 'moves', 'beginners', 'as', 'well', 'advanced', 'kickass', 'version', 'moves', 'one', 'left', 'out', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'can', 'do', 'hours', 'Zumba', 'problem', 'hike', 'walk', 'several', 'miles', 'just', 'different', 'kind', 'workout', 'very', 'intense', 'little', 'rest', 'always', 'moving.Try', 'keep', 'Do', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'will', 'see', 'changes', 'body', 'right', 'away', 'will', 'keep', 'losing', 'weight/getting', 'fit', 'progress', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'faster', 'better', 'quicker', 'months', 'Jillian', 'dvds', 'beat', 'yet', 'plateau', 'people', 'comment', 'notice', 'weight', 'loss', 'even', 'only', 'been', 'month', 'last', 'saw', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'BFBM', 'rest', 'life', 'mix', 'up', 'other', 'workouts', 'keep', 'seeing', 'changes']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

1219803,A2QQR7FWJGKNBC,B001NFNFN0,bubbles246,"[12, 14]","I was introduced to Jillian Michaels via her 30 Day Shred DVD.  That workout is tough...and awesome.  This one is just as awesome.  Notice how many reviews it has and how many stars it has - there is a reason for this.Previous reviewers have commented that you should get through 30 Day Shred before attempting this one...I agree, yet I disagree at the same time.  What I like about this DVD as opposed to the 30 Day Shred is that the time spent doing each exercise is shorter, so I find I can get through them more easily without wanting to stop.  For example, in 30 Day Shred I will start to lose my steam and motivation because I'll feel like we've been doing squats or lunges FOREVER, and Jillian will say, ""halfway there, don't quit on me now!"" and I'm like, aaagh how many are left?!  But with this DVD, because the circuits are set up differently, you'll do a set of four to five exercises twice.  So, you'll do each exercise for a little bit of time, twice instead of doing a whole bunch at once.  Make sense?  This helps me psychologically because just when I'm starting to lose my steam on the lunges, Jillian switches to another move.The moves are hard, and I get winded very easily.  And, I have yet to make it through the entire DVD.  But that's okay, and Jillian says in the introduction that beginners will have to work up to the full workout.  Another previous review mentioned they like to use a circuit or two from this to supplement another workout...that's a good idea, and the DVD setup allows you to pick one area you'd like to work if this is how you want to use the DVD.I like to rotate between 30 Day Shred, this DVD, and No More Trouble Zones.

1219804,A1D0PONZTGWY73,B001NFNFN0,bubblewrap74,"[7, 8]","People who say Jillian is annoying and grating are absolutely right. However, she is less annoying in this video than some of her newer ones. In this one, she encourages you, talks about form, etc. and doesn't try to do her cute/tough routine. Plus, the moves are straightforward enough that if you do the video a few times, you can turn the sound off and just listen to your own music. In many of her videos, this is not true.I think this her most difficult workout. The moves themselves are simple and anyone can do them, unlike some of the newer videos where you are struggling with trying to do the move but not actually getting that much exercise out of it. It is harder and longer (45min workout segment) than 30 day shred - you would have to combine two workouts in 30DS to do a workout as long and as hard as this. If you do all six circuits (yes, I said six), you will be very tired at the end. For these reasons, it has taken the top spot as my favourite Jillian video. I've tried quite a few of them. My favourites are 30DS, this one, and no more trouble zones. These three actually come as a set on Amazon, which I think would be a great deal.There is a lot of cardio here. Jillian unfortunately does not show many of the moves in a low impact version, but if you have been exercising for any length of time at all, you already know how to modify the jumping moves into something that is lower impact. What I like is that she doesn't spend a lot of time doing plank and yoga based circuits (only circuit #4) which are hard on the wrists and back. You do not need equipment to do this video, not even hand weights. For me this is irrelevant, but some people might apreciate it. Note, I'm not saying there is not strength based stuff here, it's just that you are using your bodyweight more and you do the moves quickly, so I'd say it is more cardio than strength. It reminds me of an intense boot camp class. She does not have a lot of ab stuff here, unlike 30 day shred where it's at the end of each circuit. Some people will like this, some will want more abs.The length and intensity might be too much for people to want to do every day, but it is a great cardio video to mix in with your strength workouts. I often feel like 30DS and Ripped in 30 are a little too short, because the actual workout segments are only 20-25 minutes long. With this BFBM, I don't feel ripped off that way. It's like going to the gym and doing a bootcamp class, but you can do it in the privacy of your own home.Breakdown:C1: kickboxing movesC2: plyometricsC3: calisthenicsC4: floor core stuff (plank, mountain climbers, etc)C5: kickboxing again, this time harderC5: plyometrics again, this time harderC6: misc",5,one of my favourites,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2703,"['People', 'who', 'say', 'Jillian', 'annoying', 'grating', 'are', 'absolutely', 'right', 'However', 'less', 'annoying', 'video', 'newer', 'ones', 'one', 'talks', 'form', 'etc', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'cute/tough', 'routine', 'moves', 'are', 'straightforward', 'enough', 'do', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'turn', 'sound', 'just', 'listen', 'own', 'music', 'many', 'videos', 'not', 'true.I', 'think', 'most', 'difficult', 'workout', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'newer', 'videos', 'where', 'are', 'struggling', 'trying', 'do', 'move', 'not', 'actually', 'getting', 'much', 'exercise', 'harder', 'longer', '45min', 'segment', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'would', 'have', 'combine', 'two', 'workouts', '30DS', 'do', 'workout', 'long', 'as', 'hard', 'do', 'six', 'circuits', 'yes', 'said', 'six', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'tired', 'end', 'reasons', 'taken', 'top', 'spot', 'favourite', 'Jillian', 'video', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'quite', 'few', 'favourites', 'are', '30DS', 'one', 'more', 'trouble', 'zones', 'three', 'actually', 'come', 'set', 'Amazon', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'deal.There', 'lot', 'cardio', 'here', 'Jillian', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'show', 'many', 'moves', 'low', 'impact', 'version', 'have', 'been', 'exercising', 'length', 'time', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'modify', 'jumping', 'moves', 'something', 'lower', 'impact', 'What', 'like', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'doing', 'plank', 'yoga', 'based', 'circuits', 'only', 'circuit', '4', 'are', 'hard', 'wrists', 'back', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'equipment', 'do', 'video', 'not', 'even', 'hand', 'weights', 'irrelevant', 'people', 'might', 'apreciate', 'Note', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'not', 'strength', 'based', 'stuff', 'here', 'just', 'are', 'using', 'bodyweight', 'more', 'do', 'moves', 'quickly', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'cardio', 'strength', 'intense', 'boot', 'camp', 'class', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'ab', 'stuff', 'here', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'where', 'end', 'circuit', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'will', 'want', 'more', 'abs.The', 'length', 'intensity', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'want', 'do', 'day', 'great', 'cardio', 'video', 'mix', 'strength', 'workouts', 'often', 'feel', '30DS', 'Ripped', '30', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'actual', 'workout', 'segments', 'are', 'only', '20-25', 'minutes', 'long', 'BFBM', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'way', 'going', 'gym', 'doing', 'bootcamp', 'class', 'can', 'do', 'privacy', 'own', 'home.Breakdown', 'C1', 'kickboxing', 'movesC2', 'plyometricsC3', 'calisthenicsC4', 'floor', 'core', 'stuff', 'plank', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'etc', 'C5', 'kickboxing', 'again', 'time', 'harderC5', 'plyometrics', 'again', 'time', 'harderC6', 'misc']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

Not each circuit makes you want to vomit, so that's good, but two of them will (the second and the second to the last circuits you will HAVE to stop--and if you don't, bravo). I am in excellent shape, work out at least five days a week, and this kicked my arse. You don't need any equipment for this dvd. LOTS of plyometric ""jump work"" as Jillian calls it. There are, I think, six circuits and they go fast but it's tough. TRUST.Here are some more dvds I do (since I get asked a lot!). Not that you know me, but whatever. These aren't in any particular order, just ones I like.1. Biggest Loser: Cardio Max2. Biggest Loser: Last chance workout**You need a set of 3 or 5 lb weights w/ Biggest Loser workouts. Always good to have anyway!3. The Firm: 500 cal workout (w/ Kelsie--she's a great instructor)4. The Firm: Bootcamp maximum calorie burn (with Alison)**The Firm workouts tend to be dancey, which is not good for Clydes like me, and you'll have to watch/do them a few times before you get the hang of it, but it's worth it. And then once you know the workout you'll feel like you actually have rhythm, which is nice. I generally just use the 5 lb weights w/ the Firm, but I also have a pair of 3 lb. weights.5. Jillian Michaels: No more trouble zones6. Turbo Jam: Cardio Party (1) **this is a fun one for when you are a little short on time. Make sure you get some 1 lb weighted hand weights (you can get them for $12 at Academy--don't pay $60 for the Beachbody ones, insane.)7. Billy Blanks anything (but can be dancey). I like the Tae-Bo Amped Live in Hollywood--it's a bit shorter, and you can modify it to make it harder (just add your own stuff in when he's running his mouth). You will need the Tae-Bo Amped bar for this one if you want to actually get a work out.8.

1219813,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B001NFNFN0,Colleen M. Schneider,"[3, 4]","Alright, here's the scoop-this is not a beginner workout, and intermediates may be lost by the wayside as well on some of the drills.  Jillian takes you through a course of seven 6 minute circuits.  Now remember who we are dealing with here....Jillian will be pushing you HARD and 6 minutes will seem like a really long time on some of the more challenging circuits, so don't think this will be easy.  There are classic exercises, such as jumping jacks & jogging in place, some kickboxing moves, plyometric jumping, mat exercises, etc.I found that some areas I was really good at-kickboxing (I do it a couple times a week), and the standing cardio stuff, but where I saw the real slow down of that 6 minutes for me was the exercises that put me in a pushup and had me do mountain climbing, which switches the legs up toward the chest in an alternating pattern and the one where you start in a pushup drop one elbow, drop the other and then go back up to a full push up stance again.  Ok, so, this will really highlight those areas that need work...On cuing the moves-excellent!  Good form & good modificationsOn dialog-excellent-enough to keep me motivated-my favorite being the (just a couple more-Oh thank GOD!) I definitely like the non-chatty, no bs, get to the point instruction.  The last thing I want at o'dark thirty in the morning is chirpy instruction from the skinny chick.On moves-excellent moves that get your heart rate up and make you feel like you are really accomplishing something here.On music selection: I didn't notice it until the last segments, and it may just be me, but it sounded like Friday the 13th, music-well, I suppose that WOULD motivate me to move faster, but not really what I like in music.....On fun factor-this is my own thing.  I have to have a bit of a fun factor in my workouts-do I feel like I will go back to it because I enjoy doing it?  Kickboxing? fun, dancin?, fun, old school butt kicking work-out-effective, but not high on the fun factor, so a little bit of a deduction here. I will do it because it is good for me, but it probably will be edged out by kickboxing/pilates or yoga on some days due to low ""fun"" factor....Overall feeling when through-like I had really worked out hard-sweaty for sure and felt like I had really worked.

1219820,A3FAA6VVDSMZYH,B001NFNFN0,Don't Run Over Your Foot,"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite workout videos because it's very easy to do and incorporates a lot of plyometric moves into the workout.  I mean it's very easy to do as in you don't need extra gym equipment, your own body weight is used throughout the workout, and you don't need a whole bunch of space (maybe 8 ft by 3 ft).  I have a small aparmtent, so I don't have a ton  of space.With that being said, the actual run time on this DVD is 45 minutes rather than 40.  Jillian and her workout partners are very motivating.  Just pop on itunes in the background and the workout goes by pretty quickly.  The workout also can be challenging.  There are 7 circuits, and each circuit is repeated before moving onto the next one.  The circuits incorporate ab moves, jumps, squats, kickboxing moves, and miscellaneous moves such as burpees and skaters.  One area they could've improved on with this DVD is incorporating more upper body.  Jillian does have push-ups in some of her other videos.  The arm moves she does (punches), really don't do anything for my arms and I even use 2 lb weights per arm,  Maybe I should buy a pair of 5 lb boxing gloves haha, maybe the fighting moves will work then. :)I have also owned this DVD for at least 2 years, so I've grown accusomed to how many reps are done for each exercise.  That does help motivate me to finish strong.  I enjoy doing this video when I'm too tired to workout right after work (12 hour shifts can kill you), or when there is bad weather outside.  The cardio will make you sweat and by the time the 6th circuit rolls around, I have to really motivate myself to get through that one.

I honestly can't imagine a total beginner getting through this...well maybe if you're a masochist, lol. So, try one of the shorter 1's 1st and see how you like it.Like all the Biggest Loser/Jillian Michaels videos that I've done (the ones on OnDemand), it's very lower body heavy because the legs will burn the most amount of calories. If that's all you need because you don't do any other cardio, great, but I couldn't care less how many calories I burn since I already run 5 miles every morning... it's just more calories I have to worry about consuming so I don't pass out and die throughout the day.Don't get me wrong, I think all the squat jumps she makes you do in this workout are PERFECT for increasing agility and running speed, but that's the problem--it's not something I would consider a total body workout, which is what I believe it's marketed as. I would have loved to see some push-ups along with the planks and perhaps a dumbbell circuit.As for Jillian, sorry guys, but I'm just not a fan. Her self-deprecating ""humor"" gets old after she says the same thing like 10 times. I get it, you're not flexible...sucks for you.

No problem.I'm happy to report that this WAS, indeed, quite a challenge, even for myself, a seasoned workoutaholic. In fact, I can't imagine this NOT being a challenge. Every plyometric move can be done deeper, or higher, or more intensely. There's endless room for growth here; these 40 minutes are packed with moves that combine strength and cardio without rest. If you're bored of treadmills and bikes, these moves offer variety and challenge more than one group of muscles. Furthermore, I learned new moves that I can use at the gym, while traveling, and for outdoor workouts. These moves require no equipment.Why, you must be asking, did I dock 1 star? It has nothing to do with Jillian's excellent cuing or the workout; it's the DVD. For one, I wonder what they're thinking when they have the option to do the workout with just the music. As if the music on these DVDs was ever even slightly good. A lot of the moves are done looking at the floor or ceiling rather than at the TV, so the cuing is helpful. I'd rather just hear Jillian's voice and play my own music, frankly.

1219836,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B001NFNFN0,Honest,"[0, 0]","This is classic Jillian Michaels. Lots of plyometrics, squats, and kickboxing moves are integrated in and one of the circuits is focused on abdominal work (floor-based mountain climbers, planks, pike-legged crunches, etc...). Each circuit is repeated twice and the workout it set up so that going through each circuit twice pretty much equals to 6 minutes apiece.If knee problems are an issue for you, use caution because there is a lot of jumping in this workout.Per the title of this review, the workout is set up to produce a good cardio session while integrating some body-weight muscle conditioning; and it does offer this feature. However, the workout is so boring that by the time I got to the 5th circuit, I was so disinterested that I started thinking about other places I'd rather be and setting up way more attractive scenarios in my head. The reason this is a problem is because I find that workouts are more effective when you are focusing on them (ie. mind-muscle connection).The abdominal circuit (#4), for me, was totally anti-climactic and I feel that it lent to the feeling of &#34;over it&#34; I had soon after. Perhaps, Jillian should have put that one as the last circuit. If I had to guess, I'd say that the slight recuperative nature of the floor work just doesn't help maintain motivation for the rest of the more aerobic circuits that follow it.What I really think this DVD should have done was left it to 5 circuits which would still have been a good 30 minute workout (not including warm-up) OR just performed each circuit once through to avoid the tedium and downright annoyance of having to perform the circuits twice (maybe that's why several of her subsequent DVD's have multiple shorter workouts instead).The DVD has a &#34;Recommendations&#34; option that's basically a paragraph saying that for best results, you should workout with Jillian 5 days/wk (if you can do this 5 days/wk without feeling like you're watching paint dry, hats off to you).

However, I've also admitted that her workouts are the real deal and she knows her stuff.  I started with 30-Day Shred a few years ago...never liked her personally, but she delivered.  I added 6 weeks-6 pack a couple months ago, and was amazed at how quickly my endurance and core strength improved...next went on to her NMTZ which is also a great weight-training workout (I like to mix up my workouts so I don't get bored, so it's not that I've ""graduated"" from any of these yet).Unfortunately, while doing NMTZ I substituted the 3 lb weights for 6 lbs for some of the moves and injured my left shoulder:-(. My Doctor banned me from doing any more weight-training workouts for the next couple weeks, so needed to find an aerobic workout that didn't require weights...he also suggested Yoga.  Decided to give Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism for the simple reason that no weights are required and I wanted a good workout.  Whenever I've wanted to do a low-impact workout I'd reach for Tony Horton's Cardio workout, which helped me to lose 18 lbs a few years ago, but I'm a little bored with that so decided to buy BFBM.All I can say is Wow!  Aside from 6 weeks, 6 pack, it's been a while since I've done a workout that has me sweating so much! I'm 108 lbs, so I really don't need to lose fat, but my metabolism has been a bit sluggish for the past few weeks.  I can say that this is THE best aerobic workout I've done in a long time...I was a bit hesitant at first, as I watched it last Friday before actually doing the workout and was concerned at the many jumps, as I have arthritis in my knees.  I started the actual workout on Monday this week and have done it 3 times so far, and you just need to go at your own pace...as Tony always says ""don't come down like a thud""...land softly.  The only moves I don't like are Burpees as it strains my wrists, but I simply do the modified version or substitute with another move until that's finished.  The segment with butt kicks, knee lifts and jumping jacks right after each other is also challenging, as well as the 180 degrees jumps, but again just go at your own pace.  I also go easy on the skiing moves as it's too much for my knees, so I just jog.I definitely know that this is one workout I'll be doing for a very long time and have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this DVD...you won't be disappointed!",5,NOW THIS IS A WORKOUT!,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,2521,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'Jillian', 'mainly', 'attitude', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'harsh', 'However', ""'ve"", 'also', 'admitted', 'workouts', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'stuff', 'started', '30-Day', 'Shred', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'liked', 'personally', 'delivered', 'added', '6', 'weeks-6', 'pack', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'quickly', 'endurance', 'core', 'strength', 'improved', 'next', 'went', 'NMTZ', 'also', 'great', 'weight-training', 'workout', 'like', 'mix', 'up', 'workouts', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'not', ""'ve"", 'graduated', 'yet', '.Unfortunately', 'doing', 'NMTZ', 'substituted', '3', 'lb', 'weights', '6', 'lbs', 'moves', 'injured', 'left', 'shoulder', 'My', 'Doctor', 'banned', 'doing', 'more', 'weight-training', 'workouts', 'next', 'couple', 'weeks', 'so', 'needed', 'find', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'weights', 'also', 'suggested', 'Yoga', 'Decided', 'give', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'simple', 'reason', 'weights', 'are', 'required', 'wanted', 'good', 'workout', 'Whenever', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'do', 'low-impact', 'workout', ""'d"", 'reach', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'helped', 'lose', '18', 'lbs', 'few', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'little', 'bored', 'so', 'decided', 'buy', 'BFBM.All', 'can', 'say', 'Wow', 'Aside', '6', 'weeks', '6', 'pack', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'done', 'workout', 'sweating', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", '108', 'lbs', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lose', 'fat', 'metabolism', 'been', 'bit', 'sluggish', 'past', 'few', 'weeks', 'can', 'say', 'best', 'aerobic', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'done', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'first', 'watched', 'last', 'Friday', 'actually', 'doing', 'workout', 'was', 'concerned', 'many', 'jumps', 'have', 'arthritis', 'knees', 'started', 'actual', 'workout', 'Monday', 'week', 'have', 'done', '3', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'need', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'Tony', 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'thud', 'land', 'softly', 'only', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'Burpees', 'wrists', 'simply', 'do', 'modified', 'version', 'substitute', 'move', 'finished', 'segment', 'butt', 'kicks', 'knee', 'lifts', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'right', 'other', 'also', 'challenging', 'as', 'well', '180', 'degrees', 'jumps', 'again', 'just', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'also', 'go', 'easy', 'skiing', 'too', 'much', 'knees', 'just', 'jog.I', 'definitely', 'know', 'one', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'absolutely', 'hesitation', 'recommending', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

But of the several circuits, I really only felt as though I was working hard on two of them. And then there were some moves that I had to modify because they are really bad on your knees. I don't do jump squats, and turning 180 degress to land in a squat is very hard to do correctly, and if you don't do it exactly right, you can really hurt your knees. I'm in an intermediate to advanced level, so that's where I'm coming from. I've worked out much, much harder in other dvds.

1219853,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B001NFNFN0,Kelly Klepfer,"[7, 8]","Immediately after finishing 30 days of Shred, I jumped into Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I didn't buy it because a friend had just purchased it and offered to let me try it out but I will be ordering my own copy. Here's why:It's a darn good, fast-moving workout that leaves me feeling completely satisfied that I worked out.Interestingly, on day one of doing Banish Fat, after just finishing 30 days of Shred, I was disappointed. Why? I almost felt like I didn't get as good as a workout as I did with Shred, it seemed easier for some reason. However, while I was thinking this over, I was still panting, guzzling water and sweating like a pig. So. Were my initial thoughts right? I don't think  so. Not at all. Now after having done it several times, I think the issue is that Jillian breaks the intensity a bit so that you end up doing some of the awful moves slightly less time at a pop. Each of the 7 circuits has about 5-6 moves (I haven't really counted yet, or timed any of them) and each of those moves is done with no (or very little) rest in between and then you start over and redo them all over again before moving right into the next circuit.Shred is three 20ish minute workouts with three different levels of intensity. Banish Fat has the same workout everyday. There is the option to do individual circuits and therefore make your own workout. Shred is 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute ab done in 3 different circuits. Banish Fat is 7 circuits without a specific, timed focus. One circuit is an ab workout on the floor. Two circuits are kick-boxing based. Another one is ""old-school"" calisthenics.Banish Fat moves aren't easy. And each move is tweakable into easier or more advanced. Plyometrics are abundant, several of the moves require jumping or hopping. And squats and lunges are frequent throughout most circuits. Jillian explains the whys of doing moves the way she sets up the circuit. Many of the exercises in Banish Fat are included in Shred. Jumping Jacks, Jump Squats, Speed Skaters, Supermans, Plank Oblique Twists, Jump Ropes, High Knees, Butt Kicks, Mountain Climbers, Walking Planks and a few more. An estimated guess is that Banish Fat has 38-42 moves to Shred's 18-24. The biggest difference between Shred and Banish Fat, besides the time difference, is that Banish Fat uses no weights and 1/3 to 1/2 of Shred's moves do.The reason I'm going to buy a copy of Banish Fat is because there are days I'm going to want to use weights and challenge myself in 20 minutes of work. And there are going to be days that I want to push myself to 40 minutes and get a nice sweat on. Besides that, these workouts are so good that I don't want to get sick of repetition by doing the same thing every day.",5,"Borrowed it From a Friend, But Going to Get a Copy for My Workout Video Library",1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2737,"['Immediately', 'finishing', '30', 'days', 'Shred', 'jumped', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'friend', 'had', 'just', 'purchased', 'offered', 'let', 'try', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'ordering', 'own', 'copy', 'Here', 'why', 'darn', 'good', 'fast-moving', 'workout', 'feeling', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'worked', 'out.Interestingly', 'day', 'one', 'doing', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'just', 'finishing', '30', 'days', 'Shred', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Why', 'almost', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'good', 'workout', 'did', 'Shred', 'seemed', 'easier', 'reason', 'However', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'still', 'panting', 'guzzling', 'water', 'sweating', 'pig', 'So', 'Were', 'initial', 'thoughts', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Not', 'Now', 'having', 'done', 'several', 'times', 'think', 'issue', 'Jillian', 'intensity', 'bit', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'awful', 'moves', 'slightly', 'less', 'time', 'pop', '7', 'circuits', '5-6', 'moves', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'counted', 'yet', 'timed', 'moves', 'done', 'very', 'little', 'rest', 'then', 'start', 'redo', 'over', 'again', 'moving', 'right', 'next', 'circuit.Shred', 'three', '20ish', 'minute', 'workouts', 'three', 'different', 'levels', 'intensity', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'same', 'workout', 'everyday', 'option', 'do', 'individual', 'circuits', 'therefore', 'make', 'own', 'workout', 'Shred', '3', 'minutes', 'strength', '2', 'minutes', 'cardio', '1', 'minute', 'ab', 'done', '3', 'different', 'circuits', 'Banish', 'Fat', '7', 'circuits', 'specific', 'timed', 'focus', 'One', 'circuit', 'ab', 'workout', 'floor', 'Two', 'circuits', 'are', 'kick-boxing', 'based', 'one', 'old-school', 'calisthenics.Banish', 'Fat', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'move', 'tweakable', 'easier', 'more', 'advanced', 'Plyometrics', 'are', 'abundant', 'several', 'moves', 'require', 'jumping', 'hopping', 'squats', 'lunges', 'are', 'frequent', 'most', 'circuits', 'Jillian', 'whys', 'doing', 'moves', 'way', 'up', 'circuit', 'Many', 'exercises', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'are', 'included', 'Shred', 'Jumping', 'Jacks', 'Jump', 'Squats', 'Speed', 'Skaters', 'Supermans', 'Plank', 'Oblique', 'Twists', 'Jump', 'Ropes', 'High', 'Knees', 'Butt', 'Kicks', 'Mountain', 'Climbers', 'Walking', 'Planks', 'few', 'more', 'estimated', 'guess', 'Banish', 'Fat', '38-42', 'moves', 'Shred', '18-24', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Shred', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'time', 'difference', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'weights', '1/3', '1/2', 'Shred', 'moves', 'do.The', 'reason', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'copy', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'are', 'days', ""'m"", 'going', 'want', 'use', 'weights', 'challenge', '20', 'minutes', 'work', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'days', 'want', 'push', '40', 'minutes', 'get', 'nice', 'sweat', 'workouts', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'sick', 'repetition', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'day']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

She eases you from warm up to workout, which is good because I have never gotten injured with her videos. The jumps, etc. really get your heart rate up, not like if you'd just sprinted for hours uphill, but I've tried her butt, abs, and this DVD, and they all got my heart rate up.I workout four or five times a week, sometimes six. Weights, cardio, videos, crunches, etc. A little of this and a little of that. I consider myself intermediate when it comes to weights and advanced with cardio. The fact that a workout video manages to get my heart rate up is a good thing. I can't stand the videos where you march in place slowly with a big cheerleader smile on your face.This DVD runs at about 55 minutes, counting warm up and cool down. You don't need any equipment, just make sure you have your body with you. I like that it doesn't require a shopping list of supplies to purchase before you're able to use the video.

I love the way she encourages me and tells everyone that even very heavy out of shape people can get healthy and fit. It's because of her encouragement that I have stuck with a consistent workout program for three months and have gotten the most fit and toned that I've ever been in my life, at 35 years old, and I'm proud of it. With that said, her workouts are no walk in the park, and I think this is the hardest one of all the ones I've tried. It is 40 minutes of nonstop, high impact cardio. The DVD doesn't warn you that it's all cardio either, and that's unusual for her, because normally she breaks her workouts down into short strength/cardio/ab circuits. I've done this video once, and I was only able to complete about half of it. I've already done her 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, No More Trouble Zones, and The Biggest Winner DVDs, and this one has them beat by a mile in terms of difficulty.

The moves are TOUGH, but as soon as you think you have to give up, Jillian says, ""Okay, just 5 more seconds,"" and you can push through it.  So there are 5 or 6 moves that range from super hard to slightly recovery mode, and then the circuit is repeated.  It truly makes it feel easier to finish each set.Recovery moves.  Jillian inserts moves that allow you to recover slightly at just the right moments.  Just don't think that they floor circuit is all recovery; it's NOT!Move modification for knees.  It is important to note that you don't have to jump all the time.  Jillian tells you to just squat or step until you can move to jumping.The bad stuff:Missed instructions.  There are some moves that Jillian completely skips introducing to you, so you are caught off-guard and have to watch a few times before figuring out what to do.  An example would be the reverse crunch move where you step back with your arms raised and then pull your knee up while pulling your arms down, alternating legs.  She jumps right into that without explaining what you are going to do.  There are others.The quad stretch at the end.  WTH??  This is hard on my good knees!  Why would she prefer that stretch to the standing quad stretch?  She does it on other DVDs, too.  I just skip that, and do the standing quad stretch on my own.All in all, this is an excellent workout!

There are 7 circuits to choose from, so if you are pressed for time, you can just do a few of your favorite circuits. The moves are easy to follow, yet entertaining enough so you don't get bored. You don't need a lot of equipment to do this video. It keeps your heart rate up the entire time. Sometimes I modify the moves to make it even more intense (I'm pretty advanced) but any advanced user would know how to do this. For beginners, it is great because she does show modifications. I am a huge fan of Angie Gorr's 50/50 Aerobics and Weights, and also a fan of Jackie Warners time-saver video and Jari loves Get ripped 1000. I've done over 50 videos and this is one of my favorites. Jillians style takes some getting used to, but it is tough love! She has so many DVDs out there, but I have my select few favorites. I like 30 day shred, this video burn fat and boost metabolism.

However, I was looking for some more intense cardio to add to my weekly workout routine. I have definitely found it! This DVD is tough (I would say I'm an intermediate exerciser, and I found myself stopping and panting a few times here). It works ALL muscles to the point of soreness while giving you a great, sweaty, cardio workout.

1219871,AYEWU9TDE8HX3,B001NFNFN0,"Megan Alderton ""Home workout addict""","[34, 41]","Ok.  This video is no joke.  I had done the 30 day shred a bit before buying this DVD and I found that moderately hard.  I liked Jillian's style and I could tell she knows her stuff, so I decided to try this.This video is made up of 7 six minute circuits, including about another 6 minutes of warm-up and 6 minutes of cool down.  All tolled, when you shut off the DVD in your pile of sweat, it will be at about 55 minutes.  I wasn't really sure what to expect at first, but I was determined to get through the whole thing without stopping.  I did, but it nearly killed me.  The first circuit was not that hard, so I got lulled into a false sense of security.  The next ones take it up a notch.  By the end of the second circuit, I was hurting, and panting.  She gives you what she calls a ""break"" at the end of the 3rd cicuit with side oblique crunches.  Basically, it's not really cardio,  you just put your hand behind your head and raise your leg out to the side, crunching your side.  You pay for it in the next circuit... circuit 4... it's a core circuit, but it moves superfast and it's intense.  It still feels like cardio.  She throws those damn walking planks into this circuit.  I hate these.  I do the advanced version, no knees for me.  The next circuit is another kickboxing one.  It takes it back down a notch, but it's still hard.  The 6th one is the hardest one, I think because it's all jump work... plyometrics.  You will do jump squats, cross country skiing, scissor kicks (AHHH!) skaters, and standing mountain climbers (go to hell standing mountain climbers!).  The last circuit is not a whole hell of a lot easier, and trust me by the time you get here, you have just about had it.  You're going to be dripping sweat, but you will have given up trying to wipe it off yourself because it is so profuse and everything in your body is screaming at you and you have simply given up on catching your breathe, but Jillian makes you feel like stopping is not an option.Someone else mentioned that you will not look hot immediately after doing this... very true.  But after showering and resting, you will feel great about what you did.I still do this non-stop sometimes, but other days I will do the first 4 cicuits in the morning and then do the rest in the evening.  Although Jillian might consider this cheating, I feel like it's a good way to still do the whole video and kill myself a little less.I am an avid exerciser.  I hit it for 1 to 2 hours everyday and have done so for years.  I weigh between 110-115 at 5' 4""  I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds, but mainly exercise just to stay in good health and stay toned.  My point is, I am no wimp to find this exercise routine so difficult.  You had better be up for a challenge if when you start this and/or be prepared to pace yourself or maybe not get through the whole thing the first few times.Good luck!",5,Wowsers!,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2880,"['Ok', 'video', 'joke', 'had', 'done', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'bit', 'buying', 'DVD', 'found', 'moderately', 'hard', 'liked', 'Jillian', 'style', 'could', 'tell', 'stuff', 'decided', 'try', 'this.This', 'video', 'made', '7', 'six', 'minute', 'circuits', 'including', '6', 'minutes', 'warm-up', '6', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'tolled', 'when', 'shut', 'off', 'DVD', 'pile', 'sweat', 'will', 'be', 'about', '55', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'first', 'was', 'determined', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'stopping', 'did', 'nearly', 'killed', 'first', 'circuit', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'got', 'lulled', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'next', 'ones', 'take', 'up', 'notch', 'end', 'second', 'circuit', 'was', 'hurting', 'panting', 'what', 'break', 'end', '3rd', 'cicuit', 'side', 'oblique', 'crunches', 'Basically', 'not', 'really', 'cardio', 'just', 'put', 'hand', 'head', 'raise', 'leg', 'side', 'crunching', 'side', 'pay', 'next', 'circuit', 'circuit', '4', 'core', 'circuit', 'superfast', 'intense', 'still', 'cardio', 'damn', 'walking', 'planks', 'circuit', 'hate', 'do', 'advanced', 'version', 'knees', 'next', 'circuit', 'kickboxing', 'one', 'back', 'down', 'notch', 'still', 'hard', '6th', 'one', 'hardest', 'one', 'think', 'jump', 'work', 'plyometrics', 'will', 'do', 'jump', 'squats', 'cross', 'country', 'skiing', 'scissor', 'kicks', 'AHHH', 'skaters', 'standing', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'go', 'hell', 'standing', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'last', 'circuit', 'not', 'whole', 'hell', 'lot', 'easier', 'trust', 'time', 'get', 'here', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'had', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'will', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'wipe', 'off', 'so', 'profuse', 'everything', 'body', 'screaming', 'have', 'simply', 'given', 'up', 'catching', 'breathe', 'Jillian', 'feel', 'stopping', 'not', 'option.Someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'will', 'not', 'look', 'hot', 'immediately', 'doing', 'very', 'true', 'showering', 'resting', 'will', 'feel', 'great', 'what', 'did.I', 'still', 'do', 'non-stop', 'sometimes', 'other', 'days', 'will', 'do', 'first', '4', 'cicuits', 'morning', 'then', 'do', 'rest', 'evening', 'Jillian', 'might', 'consider', 'cheating', 'feel', 'good', 'way', 'still', 'do', 'whole', 'video', 'kill', 'little', 'less.I', 'am', 'avid', 'exerciser', 'hit', '1', '2', 'hours', 'everyday', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'years', 'weigh', '110-115', '5', '4', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'losing', 'few', 'pounds', 'mainly', 'exercise', 'just', 'stay', 'good', 'health', 'stay', 'toned', 'point', 'am', 'wimp', 'find', 'exercise', 'routine', 'so', 'difficult', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'up', 'challenge', 'when', 'start', 'and/or', 'be', 'prepared', 'pace', 'maybe', 'not', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'first', 'few', 'times.Good', 'luck']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

I didn't think I could compete; I believed I was middle of the road athletic wise and was afraid of getting my bottom completely spanked by an exercise video.I finally sucked it up, drank water and did the video and not only did I finish it (without phoning it in), I loved it. No more complex moves or hours of staring into space on the eliptical nor waiting for the snow to melt so I can run... I can pop this dvd in and get an amazing workout.The video (thankfully) starts out deceptively slow and builds.

I really liked the combination of variety and toughness in this DVD -- might go check out the other DVDs by Jillian Michaels soon (all of which include hand weights, from what I saw at Walmart).",5,Exactly as the DVD title says,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,931,"['Banish', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'DVD', 'where', 'body', 'resistance', 'used', 'instead', 'hand', 'weights', 'just', 'personal', 'preference', 'even', 'probably', 'should', 'work', 'more', 'DVD', 'great', 'range', 'different', 'circuits', 'got', 'muscles', 'working', 'time.I', 'have', 'DVDs', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'few', 'others', 'DVD', 'really', 'toughest', 'ones', 'have', 'Great', 'indoor', 'workout', 'especially', 'winter', 'time', 'living', 'places/countries', '4', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'difficult', 'beginners', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'tips', 'way', 'how', 'modify', 'steps', 'such', 'jump', 'squats', 'etc', 'really', 'liked', 'combination', 'variety', 'toughness', 'DVD', 'might', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'soon', 'include', 'hand', 'weights', 'what', 'saw', 'Walmart']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

But then, I ""love"" it for the results, and for how great I feel after I've completed the workout.Jillian will take you through a full warm-up before the workout begins, and then a good cool-down at the end. The moves are not at all difficult to learn, which I appreciate, and with the various circuits it does not get boring, not even after months of doing the program. Jillian is great at keeping you motivated as well, even when you feel ready to give up and turn off the TV. If you are just starting a workout program and not in the best shape, or have problems with some jogging/bouncing moves, you may have to modify your steps at least at first. But she also shows you how to do that for some of the trickier ones, so that you can feel very accomplished when in time you can work up to doing the full moves.Overall this is a great program, especially when used in conjunction with her ""No More Troublezones"" program for strength training and muscle toning.

1219889,A3CLO1GCWJ2VVG,B001NFNFN0,N. Williams,"[6, 6]","First of all -  I believe this is the best priced cardio DVD out there. There are other good ones, Amy Dixon, Cathe, Insanity, etc, but they tend to be more expensive. Value for money, this is the best, in my opinion.I have been doing this workout now once a week for several months. I did 30 day shred then was looking for something more intense and longer so I purchased this and NMTZ. I currently do NMTZ( or Cathe's muscle max)  3 times a week alternating with cardio 3+ times a week - BFBM, breathless body, and others or running. I am 5'3 and 146 pounds, I've lost about 7 lbs since I started this regime and am a lot more toned. Gone from size 8 to 6. I  try to eat healthy but have trouble staying on low calorie diets.I'm sure if I had more will power (and didn't manage a restaurant/bar!) I would have lost a lot more.Things to mention :1. Easy to follow, basic exercises that work2. customizable -  You can amp up the workout over time - When I started, doing the workout as stated was hard enough but now I need to do a bit extra and it's easy to do that. For example, the kickboxing sets are quite easy- but you can double time those, add hand weights, do extra reps (she does quite a bit of pause and talking between exercises, I keep going until next exercise actually starts) For the jumping jacks, I do air jacks, and I always do the full burpees as fast as I can. Once you're conditioned to all the jumps with good form those can go higher and faster as well.3. Doesn't take up much space, no equipment needed.4. Good results5. I think the sets are well laid out. For example set 1 is easy.. but it's kind of the warm up set. And set two is very hard if you do full intensity, set 3 and 4 takes it down a bit but maintain intensity, set 5 is your break again and set 6 is very hard and set 7 is  your easier cool down abs set6. I like that it's pure cardio, no weights sets, which is actually hard to find these days.7. The kickboxing segment is well... a little silly. She's telling you it's a fighting move while she's having you ""uppercut"" the ceiling in a move that bares only a very passing resemblance to an uppercut. My mma/muay thai trained fiance occasionally mocks me when he sees me doing this. But I just say ""hey - it's for fitness not fighting"".... and the moves are slow, but again, I just pick up the pace, use correct form and add intensity.8.The background girls don't always look as though they are pushing themselves. I would have liked one of them to model a higher intensity option.There are a lot of comments in the reviews on the jumping and knee ankle problems. And I agree if you want the full benefit of this workout, you need the jumping or it's just not going to be that hard. So if that's a problem area, this may not be the dvd for you. However, I have had knee and ankle issues in the past, still when I run farther than 3 miles my knees and ankles start to hurt. I have never had a problem with 6 months of doing this DVD. I make sure I focus on soft landings, have good shoes, when I lived in a house with hardwood floors, I always jumped on a folded in half yoga mat. (Keeps down the noise and easier on the body)All in all - I love this DVD, it works, I can stick with it. I still sweat and still feel it every time .",5,"Great Workout, Great Value",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3271,"['First', 'believe', 'best', 'priced', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'there', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'ones', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Cathe', 'Insanity', 'etc', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'expensive', 'Value', 'money', 'best', 'opinion.I', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'workout', 'now', 'once', 'week', 'several', 'months', 'did', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'then', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'intense', 'longer', 'so', 'purchased', 'NMTZ', 'currently', 'do', 'NMTZ', 'Cathe', 'muscle', 'max', '3', 'times', 'week', 'alternating', 'cardio', '3+', 'times', 'week', 'BFBM', 'breathless', 'body', 'others', 'running', 'am', '5', '3', '146', 'pounds', ""'ve"", 'lost', '7', 'lbs', 'started', 'regime', 'am', 'lot', 'more', 'toned', 'Gone', 'size', '8', '6', 'try', 'eat', 'healthy', 'have', 'trouble', 'staying', 'low', 'calorie', 'diets.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'more', 'will', 'power', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'restaurant/bar', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'lot', 'more.Things', 'mention', ':1', 'Easy', 'follow', 'basic', 'work2', 'customizable', 'can', 'amp', 'up', 'workout', 'time', 'When', 'started', 'doing', 'workout', 'stated', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'now', 'need', 'do', 'bit', 'extra', 'easy', 'do', 'example', 'kickboxing', 'sets', 'are', 'quite', 'easy-', 'can', 'double', 'time', 'add', 'hand', 'weights', 'do', 'extra', 'reps', 'quite', 'bit', 'pause', 'talking', 'exercises', 'keep', 'going', 'next', 'exercise', 'actually', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'do', 'air', 'jacks', 'always', 'do', 'full', 'burpees', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'Once', ""'re"", 'conditioned', 'jumps', 'good', 'form', 'can', 'go', 'higher', 'faster', 'well.3', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'equipment', 'needed.4', 'Good', 'results5', 'think', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'example', 'set', '1', 'easy..', 'kind', 'warm', 'up', 'set', 'set', 'two', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'full', 'intensity', 'set', '3', '4', 'down', 'bit', 'maintain', 'intensity', 'set', '5', 'break', 'again', 'set', '6', 'very', 'hard', 'set', '7', 'easier', 'cool', 'down', 'abs', 'set6', 'pure', 'cardio', 'weights', 'sets', 'actually', 'hard', 'find', 'days.7', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'well', 'little', 'silly', 'telling', 'fighting', 'move', 'having', 'uppercut', 'ceiling', 'move', 'only', 'very', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'uppercut', 'mma/muay', 'thai', 'trained', 'fiance', 'occasionally', 'mocks', 'when', 'doing', 'just', 'say', 'hey', 'fitness', 'not', 'fighting', 'moves', 'are', 'slow', 'again', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'use', 'correct', 'form', 'add', 'intensity.8.The', 'background', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'are', 'pushing', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'one', 'model', 'higher', 'intensity', 'are', 'lot', 'comments', 'reviews', 'jumping', 'knee', 'ankle', 'problems', 'agree', 'want', 'full', 'benefit', 'workout', 'need', 'jumping', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'So', 'problem', 'area', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'dvd', 'However', 'have', 'had', 'knee', 'ankle', 'issues', 'past', 'still', 'when', 'run', 'farther', '3', 'miles', 'knees', 'ankles', 'start', 'hurt', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'problem', '6', 'months', 'doing', 'DVD', 'make', 'sure', 'focus', 'soft', 'landings', 'have', 'good', 'shoes', 'when', 'lived', 'house', 'hardwood', 'floors', 'always', 'jumped', 'folded', 'half', 'yoga', 'mat', 'Keeps', 'down', 'noise', 'easier', 'body', 'love', 'DVD', 'can', 'stick', 'still', 'sweat', 'still', 'feel', 'time']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

Repetitive bending at the lumbar spine with your knees straight---isn't that what they tell you NOT to do at all of your ergonomic meetings at work? So her warm-up is a little sketchy.The workout itself is okay. This is not a low impact aerobic video, and is more suited for someone who is in decent shape.  There are lower impact variations of most of the moves she does.  But, you'd be better off buying a video more suited for low impact aerobics that trying to adjust this one to fit your needs.I can't imagine doing this video over and over again, as it is one 40 minute workout.  I would think most people would get bored with it after seven or so times in a row.  Jillian says if we keep doing this workout with her, we'll look like her models. I'm sure we would die of boredom before then.I expected a lot more out of a Jillian Michaels video, but I don't do many of these.  I wanted something I could do at home while my babies were sleeping or otherwise occupied.

I felt so accomplished after I was done even though every muscle was quivering. Jillian's motivation is what kept me going throughout the workout without that I wouldn't have made it as far I did. Although her talking can get irritating sometimes, her pushing you to work harder really helps especially for someone like me who tends to give up easily.

I am an advanced exerciser, and I must say Jillian really pushed me to my limit on this one.  She does 7 circuits (twice each), and I like how she varies the intensity of each circuit.  The moves are easy to follow and do, and I kept up with her the entire time; however, I was sweating bullets and huffing and puffing during those more intense circuits, and grateful for the circuits that were less intense! (I barely made it through the 6th circuit!)  I also like how she had a circuit in the middle entirely on the floor.  There are a great variety of exercises in this workout (some she uses in her 30 day shred and her How to Win By Losing series) to keep it fresh the entire time.  She is much more professional in this video than in past series (I was happy to see no giggling and repeating of sets simply because she said so), and suggests modifications for beginners.  The only thing I was disappointed about was her ""Tips for Healthy Living"" segment under the ""Bonus"" menu on the DVD.  It turned into an infomercial for Oral B power toothbrushes. . . ugh.

I am allergic to cardio and all forms of exercise.Also, I hate gyms and whenever I have to whip myself into shape, prefer to make a fool of myself in the privacy of my own home.2 years ago, I lost over 22 pounds in 4 months, following a very low cal diet( 1000 daily calories sometimes starving myself down to 700) and exercising 5 times a week, at least.At first, the weight didn't come off because I was counting walking to town for 30 minutes as cardio and exercising 3-4 times a week doing toning through Callanetics ( Best toning results in the world!).I had been told that the best way to lose weight was through walking for one hour on the treadmill 5 times a week but not do high impact aerobics.I successfully reshaped my body with the help of Callanetics, 20 minutes to 30 minutes of cardio with the 10 Minutes Solution Dance it Off DVD, plus 30 minutes walking from my home to Downtown.As soon as I introduced cardio dance, I got faster results. I started to realise that my body needed higher impact cardio to slim down and heavy sweating.Introducing Jillian Michaels Banish Fat Boost Your Metabolism!I was really scared reading here that some intermediate to advanced exercisers could not go through it, I expected to not be able to go through the whole workout at first.Also, I have sprained both my ankles in the past 2 years and have knee problems,and lower back weakness through a fall, 10 years ago. I tried jumping rope for cardio but  it killed my back, so I was very very cautious starting Jillian's workout.I almost died and threw up but managed to go through the whole DVD doing modifications as follows:Squats with scissor legs:I squat then straighten my left leg without jumping and scissor the right leg, pointing the tip of my right foot at the knee level of my left leg,it's like making a triangle shape with the legs, then I alternate legs.Butt kicks:I walk instead of running.Cross Country skying:I do not jump.I lunge on alternate  foot ,in a walking motion, so that I always have one foot on the floor, instead of both in the air, with the scissor motion of jumping.Jogging high knees:I walk instead of running.I have done the DVD 5 times in the past 2 weeks and have lost 0.7 % body fat and about 1 pound.My belly that looked like I had given birth to triplets the day before, is now noticeably reduced and my obliques are showing. I can tell that fat has been lost but also I have more vitality and cardio endurance. I now walk with a dynamic stride and do not feel as winded as before when I walk up 2 flights of stairs.More importantly, I am motivated because I am seeing results and I am proud of myself that I can stick through such a grueling workout.The only thing I don't like in the DVD is the music and the goddawful infomercial in the Bonuses. Because of those, I would give this DVD 4 and a half stars.",5,Results speak louder than hype!,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,3013,"['reading', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'took', 'plunge', 'bought', 'DVD.I', 'am', 'early', '40s,50', 'pounds', 'overweight', 'sedentary', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', '20', 'months', 'am', 'allergic', 'cardio', 'forms', 'exercise.Also', 'hate', 'gyms', 'whenever', 'have', 'whip', 'shape', 'prefer', 'make', 'fool', 'myself', 'privacy', 'own', 'home.2', 'years', 'ago', 'lost', 'over', '22', 'pounds', '4', 'months', 'following', 'very', 'low', 'cal', 'diet', '1000', 'daily', 'calories', 'sometimes', 'starving', '700', 'exercising', '5', 'times', 'week', 'least.At', 'first', 'weight', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'was', 'counting', 'walking', 'town', '30', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'exercising', '3-4', 'times', 'week', 'doing', 'toning', 'Callanetics', 'Best', 'toning', 'results', 'world', '.I', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'best', 'way', 'lose', 'weight', 'was', 'walking', 'one', 'hour', 'treadmill', '5', 'times', 'week', 'not', 'do', 'high', 'impact', 'aerobics.I', 'successfully', 'reshaped', 'body', 'help', 'Callanetics', '20', 'minutes', '30', 'minutes', 'cardio', '10', 'Minutes', 'Solution', 'Dance', 'Off', 'DVD', '30', 'minutes', 'walking', 'home', 'Downtown.As', 'soon', 'introduced', 'cardio', 'dance', 'got', 'faster', 'results', 'started', 'realise', 'body', 'needed', 'higher', 'impact', 'cardio', 'slim', 'down', 'heavy', 'sweating.Introducing', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'was', 'really', 'scared', 'reading', 'here', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'expected', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'whole', 'workout', 'first.Also', 'have', 'sprained', 'ankles', 'past', '2', 'years', 'have', 'knee', 'problems', 'lower', 'back', 'weakness', 'fall', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'tried', 'jumping', 'rope', 'cardio', 'killed', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'cautious', 'starting', 'Jillian', 'workout.I', 'almost', 'died', 'threw', 'up', 'managed', 'go', 'whole', 'DVD', 'doing', 'modifications', 'Squats', 'scissor', 'legs', 'squat', 'then', 'straighten', 'left', 'leg', 'jumping', 'scissor', 'right', 'leg', 'pointing', 'tip', 'right', 'foot', 'knee', 'level', 'left', 'leg', 'making', 'triangle', 'shape', 'legs', 'then', 'alternate', 'legs.Butt', 'kicks', 'walk', 'instead', 'running.Cross', 'Country', 'skying', 'do', 'not', 'jump.I', 'lunge', 'alternate', 'foot', 'walking', 'motion', 'always', 'have', 'one', 'foot', 'floor', 'instead', 'air', 'scissor', 'motion', 'jumping.Jogging', 'high', 'knees', 'walk', 'instead', 'running.I', 'have', 'done', 'DVD', '5', 'times', 'past', '2', 'weeks', 'have', 'lost', '0.7', '%', 'body', 'fat', '1', 'pound.My', 'belly', 'looked', 'had', 'given', 'birth', 'triplets', 'day', 'now', 'noticeably', 'reduced', 'obliques', 'are', 'showing', 'can', 'tell', 'fat', 'been', 'lost', 'also', 'have', 'more', 'vitality', 'cardio', 'endurance', 'now', 'walk', 'dynamic', 'stride', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'as', 'winded', 'when', 'walk', 'up', '2', 'flights', 'stairs.More', 'importantly', 'am', 'motivated', 'am', 'seeing', 'results', 'am', 'proud', 'can', 'stick', 'grueling', 'workout.The', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'music', 'goddawful', 'infomercial', 'Bonuses', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', '4', 'half', 'stars']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

Even if you don't have time for the whole workout, the DVD is set up where you can choose whatever circuits you want.As for the workout in itself, I really had a good time with it. I wear a heart rate monitor to track calories burned and at the end, I was over 400 calories burned... in just 45 minutes! I consider myself in somewhat good shape, as I've been doing a lot of her other DVD's and have been long distance running for almost a  year now. It is great for seasoned athletes and beginners alike.

I thought this would be easy.. Now I thought No More Trouble Zones would be harder than this because you dont lift weights in this one-- WRONG! For me I found this work out so tough, a real challenge, a dripping sweat work out.Some of the moves I found easy to do like the kickboxing because I was an avid Tae Boe addict for years. I checked my heart rate half way in and it was 187-- the rate it should be for athletic training. The circuit where jumping jacks were invloved, i had to grab some water because i was really getting weak.I was able to complete the whole workout at a begginer level and Im not a begginer. Some moves I was unable to do were the scissor jumps-- I was afraid my knees would damage on that so i just did regular lunges, after 2 weeks of doing his dvd, iwas able to do the scissor jumps, u have to be careful with thise,,also the knee lifts she does I found hard to follow and just did regular knee lifts instead of lunging knee lifts.I must admit towards the end of the tape I was feeling exhausted.I am doing this dvd and switching to the No More target Zones on alternate days... Jillian is a great motivator as well.... This workout is tough and trust me this will get you in shape. She blows me away.If your out of shape or just beigginning to work out I really dont reccomend this dvd as you can injure yourself, I would start with the 30 Day Shred and then work your way to this..

There are 7 six minute circuits full of heart pumping exercises, some of my favorites are the 180 jumps, the squats with a kick out, the skiers, pike crunches and some of the old school stuff like jumping jacks and butt kicks.  I like that there is a circuit that works the abs with plank work- twists, ab holds, pike crunches, supermans etc.  The kick boxing stuff is actually kind of fun too.  One word of advice if you are a more advanced athlete, you may want to add weights to some of these moves.  I consider myself in good shape and some of these were slightly too easy for me, so I just picked up a weight and held while I did the squats or leg kicks or some of the boxing moves.  Some of the moves were too difficult for me with weights, but there were many I needed the extra ""punch"".  Overall, I did 48 minutes (not including cool down) and burned 300 calories- I'm 5"" tall, 115lbs.  Definitely a great burn for my time!!I'd definitely recommend this DVD to friends, as I do all her DVD's (well, most!).  If I didn't run and bike, I'd do this much more frequently, but it's nice to change things up.  This dvd mixed with No More Trouble Zones, will really get you great results!  That is my favorite of hers because it targets EVERYTHING, plus your HR is up and it's got lots of strength moves.  Classic Jillian DVD's are my favorite.",5,High Intensity Calorie Burning Cardio Workout!,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1770,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'just', 'Jillian', 'DVD', 'last', '3', 'years', 'Started', 'Shred', 'Ripped', '30', 'what', 'DVD', 'just', '3-2-1', 'circuits', 'mix', 'strength', 'abs', 'BFBM', 'pretty', 'much', 'purely', 'cardio', 'Which', 'appreciate', 'having', 'Jillian', 'DVD', 'know', 'going', 'BURN', 'LOTS', 'calories', 'BFBM', 'approximately', '55', 'minute', 'workout', 'include', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'are', '7', 'six', 'minute', 'circuits', 'full', 'heart', 'pumping', 'exercises', 'favorites', 'are', '180', 'jumps', 'squats', 'kick', 'out', 'skiers', 'pike', 'crunches', 'old', 'school', 'stuff', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'butt', 'kicks', 'like', 'circuit', 'abs', 'plank', 'work-', 'twists', 'ab', 'pike', 'crunches', 'supermans', 'etc', 'kick', 'boxing', 'stuff', 'actually', 'kind', 'fun', 'too', 'One', 'word', 'advice', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'athlete', 'may', 'want', 'add', 'weights', 'moves', 'consider', 'good', 'shape', 'were', 'slightly', 'too', 'easy', 'so', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'weight', 'held', 'did', 'squats', 'leg', 'kicks', 'boxing', 'moves', 'moves', 'were', 'too', 'difficult', 'weights', 'were', 'many', 'needed', 'extra', 'punch', 'Overall', 'did', '48', 'minutes', 'not', 'including', 'cool', 'down', 'burned', '300', 'calories-', ""'m"", '5', 'tall', '115lbs', 'Definitely', 'great', 'burn', 'time', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'friends', 'do', 'DVD', 'well', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'bike', ""'d"", 'do', 'much', 'more', 'frequently', 'nice', 'change', 'things', 'up', 'dvd', 'mixed', 'More', 'Trouble', 'Zones', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'great', 'results', 'favorite', 'hers', 'EVERYTHING', 'HR', 'up', 'got', 'lots', 'strength', 'moves', 'Classic', 'Jillian', 'DVD', 'are', 'favorite']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

I had a 3 level fusion in my lower back in Dec 2010 and have been fairly inactive since that time, so I wanted something to help get my metabolism back up and weight down.  P90x seemed too aggressive for what I was looking to do, so I began looking at Jillians tapes and was happy I did.This video is really good at getting your blood pumping.  It's not geared specifically towards 23 year olds with iron hearts, but an entire age range of people with varying degrees of fitness.  Some of the exercises are tough if you are older and/or have bad joints (or back) but you can very easily modify any set to your comfort level.  I'm 6'4"" and pushing 300 pounds and almost made it through the entire series the first time I tried, I was tired and completely spent but that's good, that's what I'm looking for in a workout.  Once my body gets used to working out again, I look forward to getting 100% out of this video.Now I've read reviews on other videos by Jillian where people talk about her being arrogant and somewhat self-promoting, but I have found very little of that in this video.  Jillian comes across as very motivated and driven, she's good at keeping you motivated when it starts getting tough, especially towards the end.

1219926,A1AIW8QPB4TGMX,B001NFNFN0,"Valerie Ann Webber ""vwalker72""","[16, 22]","First, the good points. This DVD is reasonably priced, so it doesn't make fitness unaffordable. The exercises really are challenging, so there is a lot of room to grow into the disc once you buy it. I am in pretty good shape, and was sore for the next two days after doing it. The circuits were really challenging.Downsides:I would have liked more cardio, or maybe just more interesting cardio. She was talking about how you should be feeling your chest pounding at this point...doing just some jumping jacks or running in place. I felt like, ""eh, whatever."" But then again, I'm not a couch potato. But I feel like I get a better CARDIO workout in Zumba, running, or dancing at a club. (However, the circuits really did push my upper body and abs and I like that).I think Michael's style is kind of blah, but that's a personal thing. A lot of people really seem to love her no-nonsense approach.This workout would not be very good for beginners just starting out. It would take some work to be able to do some of the circuits.I would not say I had ""fun"" doing this workout. It's not really something I would do by choice. If it's raining or too windy outside to run and I don't have time to drive to the gym, then it's okay to get in my 60 minutes of exercise for the day--but given the choice between this and a 3-mile run or an hour of zumba, this tape would be last on my list.How could this video be better for me?I'd like a little better music, a sense of fun, less kickboxing, and generally a lot more energy.",3,"Good, reasonably priced, but with room for improvement",1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,1515,"['First', 'good', 'points', 'DVD', 'reasonably', 'priced', ""n't"", 'make', 'fitness', 'unaffordable', 'exercises', 'really', 'are', 'challenging', 'lot', 'room', 'grow', 'disc', 'buy', 'am', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'was', 'sore', 'next', 'two', 'days', 'doing', 'circuits', 'were', 'really', 'challenging.Downsides', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'cardio', 'maybe', 'just', 'more', 'interesting', 'cardio', 'was', 'talking', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'chest', 'pounding', 'point', 'doing', 'just', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'running', 'place', 'felt', 'eh', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'couch', 'potato', 'feel', 'get', 'better', 'CARDIO', 'workout', 'Zumba', 'running', 'dancing', 'club', 'However', 'circuits', 'really', 'did', 'push', 'upper', 'body', 'abs', 'like', '.I', 'think', 'Michael', 'style', 'kind', 'blah', 'personal', 'thing', 'lot', 'people', 'really', 'seem', 'love', 'no-nonsense', 'approach.This', 'workout', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'beginners', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'would', 'take', 'work', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'circuits.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'had', 'fun', 'doing', 'workout', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'would', 'do', 'choice', 'raining', 'too', 'windy', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'drive', 'gym', 'then', 'okay', 'get', '60', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'day', 'given', 'choice', '3-mile', 'run', 'hour', 'zumba', 'tape', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'list.How', 'could', 'video', 'be', 'better', ""'d"", 'like', 'little', 'better', 'music', 'sense', 'fun', 'less', 'kickboxing', 'generally', 'lot', 'more', 'energy']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism

She comes off as very egotistical and I don't feel encouraged.  However, this is the ONE video of hers that I actually enjoy.For starters, I don't think it's as challenging as she makes it out to be.  If you're looking for something to give you a real workout I'd recommend Michelle Dozois' Peak 10.  However I love it as a cardio workout when I don't have a lot of time or energy and need a boost (usually my Monday workout).  I like the variety; you do the move for 30 seconds then switch to something else.  There are 7 sequences that have 5 moves, and you run through each series twice.  Because I get bored very easily this works out perfectly for me.  There are no moves with weights; it's purely cardio (and a little abs).  Also, the moves are very simple and non-dancy:  something that's hard to find in a cardio workout.Sequence 1:  side kicks, jab/cross punches, side kicks (other side), jab/cross/hook/elbow punches, front kicks2:  burpees, plie hops (jump then squat in plie), jab/cross hop (3 punches then hop), 180 jump (legs apart, squat, jump 180 degrees to face other side), single leg hops (hop side to side and land on one leg)3:  butt kicks, high knees, jumping jacks, side crunches (I hold a weight through these), side crunches other side4 (abs sequence):  mountain climbers, superman (lay on your stomach, lift arms and legs), pike crunches (lay on your back lift arms and legs), oblique crunches (all fours, bring knee to opposite armpit), walking plank (plank on forearms, lift up to plank on hands)5:  swing kicks, uppercuts, back kicks, jab/cross, knees6:  squat jumps, cross-country skier, scissor kicks (start legs apart, jump up and bring them together, land apart), skaters, standing mountain climbers7:  twist hops (twist side to side with by hopping to each side, legs together), standing pikes (stand up straight, kick leg straight up to extended hands), knees on right, knees on left, jump ropeSequence 1 and 5 are really easy, 2 and 6 are the most challenging.As with any workout it's not a good idea to do it every single day with no rests in between.  That won't make your joints happy.  I like to alternate pure cardio days with cardio/weights mixed days and this has fit in very well with that rotation.",3,The only Jillian DVD I like,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,2352,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'several', 'DVDs', 'attitude', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'off', 'very', 'egotistical', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'encouraged', 'However', 'ONE', 'video', 'hers', 'actually', 'enjoy.For', 'starters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'challenging', 'out', 'be', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'give', 'real', 'workout', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Michelle', 'Dozois', 'Peak', '10', 'However', 'love', 'cardio', 'workout', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'energy', 'need', 'boost', 'usually', 'Monday', 'workout', 'variety', 'do', 'move', '30', 'seconds', 'then', 'switch', 'something', 'else', 'are', '7', 'sequences', 'have', '5', 'moves', 'run', 'series', 'twice', 'get', 'bored', 'very', 'easily', 'out', 'perfectly', 'are', 'moves', 'weights', 'purely', 'cardio', 'little', 'abs', 'Also', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'non-dancy', 'something', 'hard', 'find', 'cardio', 'workout.Sequence', '1', 'side', 'kicks', 'jab/cross', 'punches', 'side', 'kicks', 'other', 'side', 'jab/cross/hook/elbow', 'punches', 'front', 'kicks2', 'burpees', 'plie', 'hops', 'jump', 'then', 'plie', 'jab/cross', 'hop', '3', 'punches', 'then', 'hop', '180', 'jump', 'legs', 'apart', 'squat', 'jump', '180', 'degrees', 'face', 'other', 'side', 'single', 'leg', 'hops', 'hop', 'side', 'side', 'land', 'one', 'leg', '3', 'butt', 'kicks', 'high', 'knees', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'side', 'crunches', 'hold', 'weight', 'side', 'other', 'side4', 'abs', 'sequence', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'superman', 'lay', 'stomach', 'lift', 'arms', 'legs', 'pike', 'crunches', 'lay', 'back', 'lift', 'arms', 'legs', 'oblique', 'crunches', 'fours', 'bring', 'knee', 'opposite', 'armpit', 'walking', 'plank', 'plank', 'forearms', 'up', 'plank', 'hands', '5', 'swing', 'kicks', 'uppercuts', 'back', 'kicks', 'jab/cross', 'knees6', 'squat', 'jumps', 'cross-country', 'skier', 'scissor', 'kicks', 'start', 'legs', 'apart', 'jump', 'up', 'bring', 'together', 'land', 'apart', 'skaters', 'standing', 'mountain', 'climbers7', 'twist', 'hops', 'twist', 'side', 'side', 'hopping', 'side', 'legs', 'together', 'standing', 'pikes', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'kick', 'leg', 'straight', 'up', 'extended', 'hands', 'knees', 'right', 'knees', 'left', 'jump', 'ropeSequence', '1', '5', 'are', 'really', 'easy', '2', '6', 'are', 'most', 'challenging.As', 'workout', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'do', 'single', 'day', 'rests', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'joints', 'happy', 'like', 'alternate', 'pure', 'cardio', 'days', 'cardio/weights', 'mixed', 'days', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'rotation']",Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat Boost Metabolism
