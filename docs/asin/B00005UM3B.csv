There was so much hype about how GOOD this movie was and the sweet little boy in the movie and his bravery that we bought the movie only to be horrified of what they do to these children and the lack of ""real quality"" storyline.  The storyline is missing so much and the parents of this little boy should be shot or perhaps the writer should be shot for even making this movie.  If they had added some real depth and detail other than the depressed state of this poor family and stuck with the child's life in more detail then the movie might have been worth the $18.00 we paid!!

684492,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B00005UM3B,Carolyn Paetow,"[0, 1]","Liam, as depicted on the dvd cover, looks to be a self-assured boy with an air of scrappy defiance.  In the movie, however, Liam is a pathetic child stunted both physically and socially, a grimey, greasy urchin so debilitated by stuttering that his portrayal borders on black comedy.  He seems destined for utter failure, as every mere striving is aborted by dire circumstance.  He scarcely reacts, either corporally or emotionally, to chiding and strapping.  Even his worries about a fiery, Hell-bound fate are silent and stilted.  His most urgent concern is that his mother is deformed because her once-glimpsed body looks different from classic nude paintings surrepticiously seen in books.But, as blighted as Liam's life appears to be, he resides within a poor but normal family that does the best it can for him.  As about ninety percent of the film shouts, it is the Catholic Church that is responsible for the woes of everyone in Liam's life.  Poverty, judophobia, sexual repression, and public disorder are all rooted in the teachings of the catechism.  Even the money given Liam by a charitable nun is used for presumed ill since he takes his sister to a Western movie in which the audience cheers the cinematic killing of Indians.There is no hope for Liam, the film laments.  Those around him will continue to march to the gloomy tune of the Church, whether they realize it or not.  A character is engulfed in flame, yet emerges scarcely scorched to continue in mindless obedience.  Such an event seems to portray a miracle, but in this movie it can only be another hole in its pointless, rut-stuck plot.",2,"A Boy's Life, Anti-Catholic Style",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,1614,"['Liam', 'depicted', 'dvd', 'cover', 'be', 'self-assured', 'boy', 'air', 'scrappy', 'defiance', 'movie', 'however', 'Liam', 'pathetic', 'child', 'stunted', 'physically', 'socially', 'grimey', 'greasy', 'so', 'debilitated', 'stuttering', 'portrayal', 'borders', 'black', 'comedy', 'destined', 'utter', 'failure', 'mere', 'striving', 'aborted', 'dire', 'circumstance', 'scarcely', 'corporally', 'emotionally', 'chiding', 'strapping', 'Even', 'worries', 'fiery', 'Hell-bound', 'fate', 'are', 'silent', 'stilted', 'most', 'urgent', 'concern', 'mother', 'deformed', 'once-glimpsed', 'body', 'different', 'classic', 'nude', 'paintings', 'surrepticiously', 'seen', 'books.But', 'as', 'blighted', 'Liam', 'life', 'be', 'poor', 'normal', 'family', 'best', 'can', 'ninety', 'percent', 'film', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'responsible', 'woes', 'everyone', 'Liam', 'life', 'Poverty', 'judophobia', 'sexual', 'repression', 'public', 'disorder', 'are', 'rooted', 'teachings', 'catechism', 'Even', 'money', 'given', 'Liam', 'charitable', 'nun', 'used', 'presumed', 'ill', 'sister', 'Western', 'movie', 'audience', 'cinematic', 'killing', 'Indians.There', 'hope', 'Liam', 'film', 'laments', 'will', 'continue', 'march', 'gloomy', 'tune', 'Church', 'realize', 'not', 'character', 'engulfed', 'flame', 'scarcely', 'scorched', 'continue', 'mindless', 'obedience', 'event', 'portray', 'miracle', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'hole', 'pointless', 'rut-stuck', 'plot']",N/A

684494,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005UM3B,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[9, 12]","1930's Liverpool during the Depression was not a great place to be.  True, the war would change all that, but for the Sullivans, an Irish Catholic family it's a time of cruel hardship, especially when one gets unemployed.  Imagine the dread that fills one's guts when the fellow at the head of the line opens his pay packet, only to find a slip of paper.  He then tells the guy behind him that the factory's closed, with the news filtering down the line.  Well, that's what happens to Pa Sullivan.Fortunately, the oldest son, Con, finds work, as does Teresa, but for the most part, the father's loss of self-respect at not being able to provide for his family creates tension between he and the rest of the family.  He's too proud to bribe the gaffer (foreman) with a drink at the pub,  so that he is one of the few allowed to work.  But when he does, the gaffer passes him over, which further destroys his pride.  And there seems some resentment over the fact that his children can find work, but not he.Liam, the youngest, has to undergo the twin Catholic rituals of first confession and first communion.  Like the rest of his peers, he is given the fire and brimstone version of hell.  The instructor, Ms. Abernathy, tells them how their souls are filthy and only with their first confession will they be pure enough to receive first communion, otherwise it's sacrilege.  And the priest tells them to imagine the hottest fire one's ever seen, because hell is worse than that.Liam is also affected with a pronounced stutter resulting in an intense hissing ""s,"" as if the words are trying to escape his mouth but are trapped.  At times, he repeats what his mother tells him when sent to the pawnbroker, with instructions of ""seven and a tenner.""  However, when he is asked the price, his mouth betrays him.  He's a nice and sweet kid, very quiet, but also puzzled.  He catches sight of his mother stepping out of the bath, then sees the Vermeer nudes, which are bare all over.  Why the difference?  The conclusion he draws, well, one can't blame him for his lack of knowledge, but it turns out to be amusing.The religious and class tensions of 1930's Liverpool are fully at play here.  During a New Year's party, two women, one Catholic, one Protestant, get into a singing, then fighting match that leads to both of them leaving the party.  Another is Teresa, the daughter and middle child, a girl just entering her teens, who takes on a housekeeping job for the Samuels, a Jewish family.  Ms. Samuels is a kindly lady and bribes the young girl for keeping quiet about her male lover.  However, to take on the job, Teresa says she's not Catholic.Catholics really had it hard given the sacraments they honour.  Indeed, Pa Sullivan rages at how ""Jesus Christ has made us skint,"" meaning how they get broke spending money needed for more basic necessities on the suits, ties, and frocks to be worn on special occasions to make young boys and girls good and presentable Catholics.  That leads to his blaming the pawnbrokers, who are Jewish, for profiting on the poverty-stricken Catholics, a wry irony considering the Jews' perceived stigma as Christ-killers on the part of Christians.  But maybe Liam's stutter and naivete regarding the paintings reveal the repressive nature of Catholicism, and how one can't learn or think due to religious bias, which in turn leads to class conflict.I learned in history that anti-Semitism has a latent/manifest dynamic.  During economically troubling times or times of catastrophes, like the Black Death, the Jews were blamed.  Small wonder then that the father becomes a willing follower of Sir Oswald Moseley's BUF, the British Union of Fascists, and makes the Jews the scapegoats for his troubles.Ian Hart (Pa) who played Professor Quirrel in Harry Potter, gives a lot of depth of a man who loses his self-respect during a time of troubles, and is desperate to prove that it's not his fault.  But the other players are well-cast, especially Anthony Burrows as Liam and Megan Burns as Teresa.",4,Fear and the repressive nature of Catholicism,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,4029,"['1930', 'Liverpool', 'Depression', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'place', 'be', 'True', 'war', 'would', 'change', 'Sullivans', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'family', 'time', 'cruel', 'hardship', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'unemployed', 'Imagine', 'dread', 'one', 'guts', 'when', 'fellow', 'head', 'line', 'pay', 'packet', 'only', 'find', 'slip', 'paper', 'then', 'guy', 'factory', 'closed', 'news', 'filtering', 'down', 'line', 'Well', 'what', 'Pa', 'Sullivan.Fortunately', 'oldest', 'son', 'Con', 'work', 'Teresa', 'most', 'part', 'father', 'loss', 'self-respect', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'provide', 'family', 'tension', 'rest', 'family', 'too', 'proud', 'bribe', 'gaffer', 'foreman', 'drink', 'pub', 'so', 'one', 'few', 'allowed', 'work', 'when', 'gaffer', 'over', 'further', 'pride', 'resentment', 'fact', 'children', 'can', 'find', 'work', 'not', 'he.Liam', 'youngest', 'undergo', 'twin', 'Catholic', 'rituals', 'first', 'confession', 'first', 'communion', 'rest', 'peers', 'given', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'version', 'hell', 'instructor', 'Ms.', 'Abernathy', 'how', 'souls', 'are', 'filthy', 'only', 'first', 'confession', 'will', 'be', 'pure', 'enough', 'receive', 'first', 'communion', 'otherwise', 'sacrilege', 'priest', 'imagine', 'hottest', 'fire', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'hell', 'worse', 'that.Liam', 'also', 'affected', 'pronounced', 'stutter', 'resulting', 'intense', 'hissing', 's', 'words', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'mouth', 'are', 'trapped', 'times', 'what', 'mother', 'when', 'sent', 'pawnbroker', 'instructions', 'seven', 'tenner', 'However', 'when', 'asked', 'price', 'mouth', 'nice', 'sweet', 'kid', 'very', 'quiet', 'also', 'puzzled', 'sight', 'mother', 'stepping', 'bath', 'then', 'Vermeer', 'nudes', 'are', 'over', 'Why', 'difference', 'conclusion', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'out', 'be', 'amusing.The', 'religious', 'class', 'tensions', '1930', 'Liverpool', 'are', 'fully', 'play', 'here', 'New', 'Year', 'party', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'Catholic', 'one', 'Protestant', 'get', 'singing', 'then', 'fighting', 'match', 'leaving', 'party', 'Teresa', 'daughter', 'middle', 'child', 'girl', 'just', 'entering', 'teens', 'who', 'housekeeping', 'job', 'Samuels', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Ms.', 'Samuels', 'kindly', 'lady', 'young', 'girl', 'keeping', 'quiet', 'male', 'lover', 'However', 'take', 'job', 'Teresa', 'not', 'Catholic.Catholics', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'given', 'sacraments', 'honour', 'Indeed', 'Pa', 'Sullivan', 'how', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'made', 'skint', 'meaning', 'how', 'get', 'broke', 'spending', 'money', 'needed', 'more', 'basic', 'necessities', 'suits', 'ties', 'frocks', 'be', 'worn', 'special', 'occasions', 'make', 'young', 'boys', 'girls', 'good', 'presentable', 'Catholics', 'blaming', 'pawnbrokers', 'who', 'are', 'Jewish', 'profiting', 'poverty-stricken', 'Catholics', 'wry', 'irony', 'considering', 'Jews', 'perceived', 'stigma', 'Christ-killers', 'part', 'Christians', 'maybe', 'Liam', 'stutter', 'naivete', 'regarding', 'paintings', 'reveal', 'repressive', 'nature', 'Catholicism', 'how', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'learn', 'think', 'due', 'religious', 'bias', 'turn', 'leads', 'class', 'conflict.I', 'learned', 'history', 'anti-Semitism', 'latent/manifest', 'dynamic', 'economically', 'troubling', 'times', 'times', 'catastrophes', 'Black', 'Death', 'Jews', 'were', 'blamed', 'Small', 'wonder', 'then', 'father', 'willing', 'follower', 'Sir', 'Oswald', 'Moseley', 'BUF', 'British', 'Union', 'Fascists', 'Jews', 'scapegoats', 'troubles.Ian', 'Hart', 'Pa', 'who', 'played', 'Professor', 'Quirrel', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'lot', 'depth', 'man', 'who', 'self-respect', 'time', 'troubles', 'desperate', 'prove', 'not', 'fault', 'other', 'players', 'are', 'well-cast', 'especially', 'Anthony', 'Burrows', 'Liam', 'Megan', 'Burns', 'Teresa']",N/A

Frears is so universal when he starts getting down into the spasms of our entirely repressed freedom. Here the repression comes from the catholic church and the catholic faith that is transformed into a pilory of flames, hells sins, blazes, punishments, retaliations, guilts, and so many other vexations and humiliations that you remain like Liam, speechless and wordless in front of the denied basic human need for communication. The little Jesus of this fundamentalistic catholic vision of the world has got your tongue. But then you have the creeping or at times pouncing unemployment that bosses create by closing their factories for no reason whatsoever, no reason explained or given to the fired workers, those who get the flames of unemployment, the sack of the dole in which they are huddled to be drowned in the next canal, and the blinders of humble annihilation that makes them pay a pint of lager to their prospective day-employer if they want him to choose them on the folllowing morning. This builds up in the consciousness of the workers and little by little the time-old survival instinct tells them there must be one person responsible somewhere, a scapegoat that can be eliminated, and the Jews become the natural preys of this survival of the most alienated: the pawnbroker's shop first, the rich employer of the daughter second, etc. And here Frears becomes a genius by linking all the strings together: the priest tells the girl, in confession mind you, to get away from this Jewish family that makes her sin, the father has become a member of the fascist commando that is going to strike this Jewish home exactly when the girl is inside telling them she won't be working for them any more, Liam's speechlessness that prevents him from telling his father about his sister's presence in the house and the Molotov cocktail that ignites the daughter and/or sister and practically nothing else. There the film reaches the level of a visitation to the real hell these people are living in, their mental submissive and subservient alienation, when the incendiary father has to come and visit his daughter out of the hospital and she apologizes for having been there at the wrong moment. An angel crosses the screen. The Holy Spirit might exist after all: in Liam's eyes when watching this absurd world created by a father, THE father, God of course.

Things pickup a little in the second half, but still very little is resolved by the end of the movie. Other than Liam getting something off his conscience near the end of the movie, his and his family's situation does not improve, in fact things only get worse as time goes by. It is not a happy ending, it is more like the story just stops without a climax. I just could not get into this movie.That is not to say that I cannot see why some people are quite thrilled with it. If you are interested in the political and social changes which went on in Liverpool during the 1930's this might be just what you are looking for. The 1930's were of course the Great Depression and times were hard. People were losing their jobs and many people were not able to obtain the necessities of life for themselves nor for their families. This caused tempers to flair, and people were looking for someone to blame. Following this family follows these changes and prejudices, often very graphically.Social class and prejudicial views are shown and attempts are made to justify these views. Actions are taken based on these prejudicial views. It is not just arguments, accusations, and fights, there is vandalizing and fire bombing. Religious view points are also a constant theme in the movie, both by the adults and by the children. Liam, the young boy the film is named for, attends a Catholic school with strong religious teachings which makes constant threats of fire and brimstone.The view point of the movie is sometimes, but not always, shaded by the view point of the children. This is especially true on the theme of sexuality. Not a major theme for the movie overall, but a major theme for the Liam. What he gets from school is that everything about sex is a sin, however, he is still curious. Twice he looks at ancient religious art in a school book depicting nude women; he accidentally sees his mother in full frontal nudity; and he tries a couple of times to see ""more"" of his older sister.

The setting in 1930's working class England is harsh. Daily life is harsh with little solace. The personalities are harsh and even in places where people try to find respite, whether it is in religion or with friends, harshness is all that can be found.We see the story through the eyes of Liam Sullivan, a young boy about First Communion age. Liam has a speech impediment which makes some people dismiss him but we realize he is more observant than some realize. Liam's father is hardly likable from the beginning, and or dislike of him only grows throughout the film. He hates the Jews and makes his hatred known. He also hates the Irish even though his name is Sullivan, claiming to be British because he was born in the country. Liam's mother is trying to do her bets to keep the family together, but the stress seems too much for her. Liam also lives with his sister Teresa who works as a made for a Jewish family, getting the job by announcing she's not Catholic, believing denying her faith will be an advantage, and an older brother Con.The film always keeps its edge, never veering toward the sentimental. It never becomes a feel good film but leaves the viewer thinking and questioning.  We see a side of pre-war England we forget existed and don't always see in film-one that sympathizes with socialism and with its anti-Semitism could easily have fallen in line with the Nazis who would have been gaining ground in continental Europe at the time. The film is not without flaws. While it cannot be denied that the Catholicism of the era was rigid, the film relies on stereotypes that would be unacceptable in films that depict other faiths. At times the priest and religion teacher are caricatures, the emphasis of the faith is somewhat inaccurate as afar as British Catholicism is concerned (Ireland would be a different story), and seem to be present only as a swipe against Catholicism. Teresa's denial of her faith is original and could have been explored more deeply and Liam's fear sins of the flesh could have been downplayed. To some extent its climax may be a bit to coincidental, but it still retains some power.",3,A Different View of Working Class England,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2242,"['were', 'think', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'film', 'LIAM', 'harsh', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'come', 'mind', 'setting', '1930', 'working', 'class', 'England', 'harsh', 'Daily', 'life', 'harsh', 'little', 'solace', 'personalities', 'are', 'harsh', 'even', 'places', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'find', 'respite', 'religion', 'friends', 'harshness', 'can', 'be', 'found.We', 'see', 'story', 'eyes', 'Liam', 'Sullivan', 'young', 'boy', 'First', 'Communion', 'age', 'Liam', 'speech', 'impediment', 'people', 'dismiss', 'realize', 'more', 'observant', 'realize', 'Liam', 'father', 'hardly', 'likable', 'beginning', 'dislike', 'only', 'film', 'Jews', 'hatred', 'known', 'also', 'Irish', 'even', 'name', 'Sullivan', 'claiming', 'be', 'British', 'was', 'born', 'country', 'Liam', 'mother', 'trying', 'do', 'bets', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'stress', 'too', 'much', 'Liam', 'also', 'sister', 'Teresa', 'who', 'made', 'Jewish', 'family', 'getting', 'job', 'announcing', 'not', 'Catholic', 'believing', 'denying', 'faith', 'will', 'be', 'advantage', 'older', 'brother', 'Con.The', 'film', 'always', 'edge', 'never', 'veering', 'sentimental', 'never', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'questioning', 'see', 'side', 'pre-war', 'England', 'forget', 'existed', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'see', 'film-one', 'socialism', 'anti-Semitism', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fallen', 'line', 'Nazis', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gaining', 'ground', 'continental', 'Europe', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'Catholicism', 'era', 'was', 'rigid', 'film', 'relies', 'stereotypes', 'would', 'be', 'unacceptable', 'films', 'depict', 'other', 'faiths', 'times', 'priest', 'religion', 'teacher', 'are', 'caricatures', 'emphasis', 'faith', 'somewhat', 'inaccurate', 'as', 'afar', 'British', 'Catholicism', 'concerned', 'Ireland', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'story', 'seem', 'be', 'present', 'only', 'swipe', 'Catholicism', 'Teresa', 'denial', 'faith', 'original', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'more', 'deeply', 'Liam', 'fear', 'sins', 'flesh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'downplayed', 'extent', 'climax', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'coincidental', 'still', 'power']",N/A
684504,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005UM3B,Tsuyoshi,"[20, 22]","After critically praised ""High Fidelity,"" director Stephen Frears came back to his homeground with ""Liam,"" which traces a family living in Liverpool during the time of the 1930s, immediately after the Great Depression.Though, with justification, some people pointed out the resemblamce between this one and ""Angela's Ashes,"" you must know that ""Liam"" is set in Liverpool, England while the other in Ireland.  So it is very suitable that ""Liam"" cast Ian Hart as Dad of the family because Liverpool-born actor once played a very credible portrait of John Lennon.  But you may now remember him as Prof. Quirrell in ""Harry Potter.""  Whichever you are, he totally remodelled himself, to become this father of 7-year-old  Liam, whose stuttering sometimes works for his advantage in this hard times of Depression.The film follows the life of Liam's family members, each of which strrugles to live under conditions of life that gradually get harder.  Liam goes to a Catholic school where he is taught about the hell and its fire; his elder sister Teresa starts a job of a housemaid in a rich Jewish family, where she inspite of herself helps to conceal the mother's affair from her husband; and Liam's father, who lost his job at factory, resorts to entering the membership of radical political party.It seems at first sight that the film is dark, grim, and somber to put off many of you, but it shouldn't.  The fact is, thanks to the fast-paced editing of the film, and very sly humors of Jimmy McGovern (of controvertial ""Priest""), which include ones with sexual nature -- little Liam had to witness his mother's naked body accidentally, and thinks he has committed a sin --the film is always watchable.  You may call it a light-weight work from Frears (running time is about 90 minutes), but it has good acting all around, convincing production designs, and most of all Anthony Borrow's adorable Liam, which itself is worth your money.  He has no previous acting experience, but you won't believe it after seeing his face.Also good is Ian Hart, as always he is.  But his final act as Dad, which is very drastic and melodramatic, looks out of tune, and certainly many of you might feel disappointed (and I was too).  But I know a Japanese reviewer who pointed out that final conclusion shows an irony -- while Liam himself is terribly afraid of being burnt in hell, it is not he that receives that fate.  Is the ending a right one?  Please judge it for yourself.Very gripping drama about a family in Liverpool, ""Liam"" tells you a thing or two about living there at that time, and influece of religion on the children.  You may wonder why Teresa had to say ""I'm sorry"" while it is Dad that should say so.  It is thus always engaing, and thought-provoking.  If you didn't like ""Angela's Ashes"" (which I liked), you may go for it.",4,Liverpool in the 1930s: Depression: and an Adorable Kid,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,2821,"['critically', 'praised', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'came', 'back', 'homeground', 'Liam', 'family', 'living', 'Liverpool', 'time', '1930s', 'immediately', 'Great', 'Depression.Though', 'justification', 'people', 'pointed', 'out', 'resemblamce', 'one', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'must', 'know', 'Liam', 'set', 'Liverpool', 'England', 'other', 'Ireland', 'very', 'suitable', 'Liam', 'cast', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Dad', 'family', 'Liverpool-born', 'actor', 'once', 'played', 'very', 'credible', 'portrait', 'John', 'Lennon', 'may', 'now', 'remember', 'Prof.', 'Quirrell', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'are', 'totally', 'remodelled', 'become', 'father', '7-year-old', 'Liam', 'stuttering', 'sometimes', 'advantage', 'hard', 'times', 'Depression.The', 'film', 'life', 'Liam', 'family', 'members', 'strrugles', 'live', 'conditions', 'life', 'gradually', 'get', 'harder', 'Liam', 'Catholic', 'school', 'where', 'taught', 'hell', 'fire', 'elder', 'sister', 'Teresa', 'job', 'housemaid', 'rich', 'Jewish', 'family', 'where', 'inspite', 'conceal', 'mother', 'affair', 'husband', 'Liam', 'father', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'factory', 'entering', 'membership', 'radical', 'political', 'party.It', 'first', 'sight', 'film', 'dark', 'grim', 'somber', 'put', 'off', 'many', 'should', ""n't"", 'fact', 'thanks', 'fast-paced', 'editing', 'film', 'very', 'sly', 'humors', 'Jimmy', 'McGovern', 'controvertial', 'Priest', 'include', 'ones', 'sexual', 'nature', 'little', 'Liam', 'had', 'witness', 'mother', 'naked', 'body', 'accidentally', 'committed', 'sin', 'film', 'always', 'watchable', 'may', 'call', 'light-weight', 'work', 'Frears', 'running', 'time', '90', 'minutes', 'good', 'acting', 'convincing', 'production', 'designs', 'most', 'Anthony', 'Borrow', 'adorable', 'Liam', 'money', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'seeing', 'face.Also', 'good', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'always', 'final', 'act', 'Dad', 'very', 'drastic', 'melodramatic', 'tune', 'certainly', 'many', 'might', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'was', 'too', 'know', 'Japanese', 'reviewer', 'who', 'pointed', 'out', 'final', 'conclusion', 'irony', 'Liam', 'terribly', 'afraid', 'being', 'burnt', 'hell', 'not', 'fate', 'ending', 'right', 'one', 'Please', 'judge', 'yourself.Very', 'gripping', 'drama', 'family', 'Liverpool', 'Liam', 'thing', 'two', 'living', 'there', 'time', 'influece', 'religion', 'children', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'Teresa', 'had', 'say', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Dad', 'should', 'say', 'so', 'thus', 'always', 'engaing', 'thought-provoking', 'did', ""n't"", 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'liked', 'may', 'go']",N/A

The act is inevitable, the irony of it unexpected. The victim is innocence itself. Everything seems to lead to this shattering moment, one for which we are not prepared. The quiet coda before the credits, when the victim actually apologizes, does not let us off the hook. You are going to hate how you feel.A hardscrabble family in Liverpool before WWII is burdened further when the father loses his job and self esteem, blames the Irish and the Jews, and becomes an anti-Semetic lout. We watch his descent through two of his children, a teenage girl and her seven-year-old brother, Liam, a stuttering lad who is also being sucked into the supernatural rites and educational wrongs of Roman Catholicism back when the Church was blindly obeyed.Catholics are not going to like this movie much. It leaves them no wiggle room. Without being explicit or mean-spirited, and years before sexual scandal and Vatican politics wrecked their havoc, director Stephen Frears has made Catholicism the villain. It is clear from the start, especially in the schoolroom scenes, that the source of all  misery is the superstition and institutional myth emanating from the pulpit and the confessional.This is a time when depression families turned to the Church for solace, only to have it unknowingly withheld. No wonder this unhappy family turns dysfunctional, its members set against themselves and their neighbors. All the actors are remarkably natural, the direction and cinematography unobtrusive, and the script honest almost to a fault. Little Liam is unlikely to grow up unharmed by his family and his faith.
