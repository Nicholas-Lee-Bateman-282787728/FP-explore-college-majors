Once I learned more about my relationship with food and got to the spiritual matter that is the foundation of my weight gain, I was able to lose some weight and keep it off. This DVD covers a lot of material and answers lots of questions that might be helpful to some people on the path to weight loss.",5,Weight Loss for the Mind,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,442,"['have', 'been', 'going', 'up', 'down', 'weight', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'lose', 'weight', 'applying', 'what', 'learned', 'DVD', 'Once', 'learned', 'more', 'relationship', 'food', 'got', 'spiritual', 'matter', 'foundation', 'weight', 'gain', 'was', 'able', 'lose', 'weight', 'keep', 'off', 'DVD', 'lot', 'material', 'answers', 'lots', 'questions', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'people', 'path', 'weight', 'loss']",N/A
168314,A3FY3H6F4249E0,140192655X,Kathy W,"[49, 49]","These 2 discs are a compilation of Q & A clips, taken from past seminars, but these are the questions that most of us would likely ask when we want to know about weight issues.  If you are familiar with the Hicks, they speak for Abraham, a collective consciousness and much, if not all, of the message is based on the Law of Attraction.  This program is, in effect, aligning your consciousness to only what you do want (instead of what you do NOT want) to reach the weight you want to be.Disc 1In disc 1, Esther/Abraham reminds us about being able to create our own realities and how aligning up properly with focused energy can bring us anything we want.  She explains the need to develop a process that slowly changes the vibrational effect of what we want to achieve. Really a double-whammy program, it talks about relieving yourself of not only weight, but debt, too and anything else you don't want.  This is a totally different way of losing weight than 99% of the diet programs you will normally find.  She also explains the importance of the emotion and expectation you place within your thoughts and how you actually need to ALLOW wellness.  It is about subtle differences in your thinking that change the resistance and change your vibration. She gives you plenty of examples in the change in the words you say to yourself. She also explains that there is no one way for everyone; no diet that fits us all, because we are all different.Disc 2We continue with Q & A clips, as the person asks their particular question and as Abraham answers through Esther.  This disc talks about creating a positive vibrational alignment with your eating experience; FEELING the emotion within where you want to be, while accepting and loving yourself where you are now; KNOWING that you are moving ""downstream"" (in the direction you want) and not giving up before the results can show up; not worrying about what you think others think about you; improving your own vibration, which improves the vibration of everything and everyone who comes into contact with you; not feeding a lot of energy into things that happened to you in the past; changing your CURRENT vibration; putting things into your vibrational escrow; getting excited about moving forward.Of course, that's it in a nutshell. You need to actually listen to the 2 discs to get the full effect and the emotional buy-in, and probably listen to them many times.  It sounds like a good product with a ton of helpful information.  For many of us, weight maintenance has been a life-long process, so it is difficult to believe that changing our way of thinking could help. I can say that I have been doing my own work with the Law of Attraction in a variety of ways and I have made a tremendous difference just by re-aligning my thought patterns. The hardest thing seems to be to BELIEVE first, BEFORE you see, because that is in total contrast with everything we have been taught as we have traveled through life.  Sometimes, the very act of re-aligning our thoughts, at the very least, changes our determination, our outlook, and our way of proceeding toward a goal.I think it's worth a try and what Abraham/Esther says makes sense to me.",5,Weight Loss through Mental & Vibrational Reprogramming,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,3192,"['2', 'discs', 'are', 'compilation', 'Q', 'A', 'clips', 'taken', 'past', 'seminars', 'are', 'questions', 'most', 'would', 'likely', 'ask', 'when', 'want', 'know', 'weight', 'issues', 'are', 'familiar', 'Hicks', 'speak', 'Abraham', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'much', 'not', 'message', 'based', 'Law', 'Attraction', 'program', 'effect', 'aligning', 'consciousness', 'only', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'instead', 'what', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'reach', 'weight', 'want', 'be.Disc', '1In', 'disc', '1', 'Esther/Abraham', 'being', 'able', 'create', 'own', 'realities', 'how', 'aligning', 'up', 'properly', 'focused', 'energy', 'can', 'bring', 'anything', 'want', 'need', 'develop', 'process', 'slowly', 'vibrational', 'effect', 'what', 'want', 'achieve', 'Really', 'double-whammy', 'program', 'relieving', 'not', 'only', 'weight', 'debt', 'too', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'losing', 'weight', '99', '%', 'diet', 'programs', 'will', 'normally', 'find', 'also', 'importance', 'emotion', 'expectation', 'place', 'thoughts', 'how', 'actually', 'need', 'ALLOW', 'wellness', 'subtle', 'differences', 'thinking', 'resistance', 'change', 'vibration', 'plenty', 'examples', 'change', 'words', 'say', 'also', 'one', 'way', 'everyone', 'diet', 'are', 'different.Disc', '2We', 'continue', 'Q', 'A', 'clips', 'person', 'particular', 'question', 'Abraham', 'answers', 'Esther', 'disc', 'talks', 'creating', 'positive', 'vibrational', 'alignment', 'eating', 'experience', 'emotion', 'where', 'want', 'be', 'accepting', 'loving', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'KNOWING', 'are', 'moving', 'downstream', 'direction', 'want', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'results', 'can', 'show', 'up', 'not', 'worrying', 'what', 'think', 'others', 'think', 'improving', 'own', 'vibration', 'vibration', 'everything', 'everyone', 'who', 'contact', 'not', 'feeding', 'lot', 'energy', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'changing', 'CURRENT', 'vibration', 'putting', 'things', 'vibrational', 'escrow', 'getting', 'excited', 'moving', 'forward.Of', 'course', 'nutshell', 'need', 'actually', 'listen', '2', 'discs', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'emotional', 'buy-in', 'probably', 'listen', 'many', 'times', 'good', 'product', 'ton', 'helpful', 'information', 'many', 'weight', 'maintenance', 'been', 'life-long', 'process', 'difficult', 'believe', 'changing', 'way', 'thinking', 'could', 'help', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'own', 'work', 'Law', 'Attraction', 'variety', 'ways', 'have', 'made', 'tremendous', 'difference', 'just', 're-aligning', 'thought', 'patterns', 'hardest', 'thing', 'be', 'BELIEVE', 'first', 'see', 'total', 'contrast', 'everything', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'have', 'traveled', 'life', 'Sometimes', 'very', 'act', 're-aligning', 'thoughts', 'very', 'least', 'determination', 'outlook', 'way', 'proceeding', 'goal.I', 'think', 'try', 'what', 'Abraham/Esther', 'sense']",N/A
