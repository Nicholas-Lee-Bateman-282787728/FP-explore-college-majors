634214,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JNRQ,calvinnme,"[31, 32]","This was the second of Steven Bochco's hit TV series, the first being ""Hill Street Blues"". It was set in and around the fictitious Los Angeles law firm McKenzie, Brackman, Cheney and Kuzak and featured attorneys at the firm and various members of the support staff and dealt with important social and cultural issues the times, with its first season starting in 1986. As a result, it seems very much dated and tied to the times in which it aired in a way that Bochco's other series do not. That might be part of the reason for the delay in releasing this series to DVD, although Bochco's other hit shows have been slow to be released on DVD too.In the first season you get a glimpse of a very young Jimmy Smits playing newly hired associate Victor Sifuentes. Also, real-life husband and wife Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry play a beauty and the beast type couple working at the firm that begin dating, including the much talked about ""Venus Butterfly"", also from this season. Also, this was the time when Grace Van Owen and Michael Kuzak still were OK to watch as a couple constantly dancing around commitment, about a year before their relationship became boring to watch because it never seemed to grow or change. Overall, I'd say the quick pace of the show, the interesting cases, and the great cast outweigh the dated issues raised.",5,A stellar first season that is very much tied to the 80's,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,1340,"['was', 'second', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'being', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'was', 'set', 'fictitious', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'law', 'firm', 'McKenzie', 'Brackman', 'Cheney', 'Kuzak', 'featured', 'attorneys', 'firm', 'various', 'members', 'support', 'staff', 'dealt', 'important', 'social', 'cultural', 'issues', 'times', 'first', 'season', 'starting', '1986', 'result', 'very', 'much', 'dated', 'tied', 'times', 'aired', 'way', 'Bochco', 'other', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'delay', 'releasing', 'series', 'DVD', 'Bochco', 'other', 'hit', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'slow', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'too.In', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'glimpse', 'very', 'young', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'playing', 'newly', 'hired', 'associate', 'Victor', 'Sifuentes', 'Also', 'real-life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Michael', 'Tucker', 'Jill', 'Eikenberry', 'play', 'beauty', 'beast', 'type', 'couple', 'working', 'firm', 'begin', 'dating', 'including', 'much', 'talked', 'Venus', 'Butterfly', 'also', 'season', 'Also', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Grace', 'Van', 'Owen', 'Michael', 'Kuzak', 'still', 'were', 'OK', 'watch', 'couple', 'constantly', 'dancing', 'commitment', 'year', 'relationship', 'became', 'boring', 'watch', 'never', 'seemed', 'grow', 'change', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'quick', 'pace', 'show', 'interesting', 'cases', 'great', 'cast', 'dated', 'issues', 'raised']",N/A
