It pains me to write a two star review about a movie with Red Green's name on it. It had some good humor thrown into certain scenes, but the comedy was mostly non-existant. The plot is actually pretty good and everything made sense, there was just not enough humor. Here's another thing I noticed, it's like this movie was made so you can spot &quot;The Lucky West Virginians.&quot; I live in West Virgina, and PBS really made a big deal out of it. I have a few suggestions, RENT THIS MOVIE FIRST, THEN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT(I saw it on TV, thank god)!

He said ""thanks for lowering them.""I also promised him that I'd write a review on Amazon.com, and I've been waiting for this DVD to become available on Amazon.com in the US...Anyway, this is a movie so don't expect it to have the ""look and feel"" of the series.  After all, it's not 90 minutes of short, mostly unrelated skits.  It has a slower pace, but most all of your favorite characters from the show are here, and there's a lot of that Red Green humor.Some people gripe that this movie is a ""road trip"" and not a story shot at ""Possum Lodge"".

746816,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B00008R9KR,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[0, 0]","I watched the ""Red Green Show"" for years on PBS. Red Green I suppose is Canada's response to Tim Allen (or vice versa as the case may be), a male-oriented show demonstrating all the foibles and fallacies of men and their hobbies. At some point, somebody with money must have said, ""Let's make a Red Green movie!"" and this was the result.The plot is pretty straightforward on the surface as the Possum Lodge is being threatened by some Evil Rich Guy whose limo was accidentally destroyed while apparently visiting the property. The court gives Red and his crew 10 days to come up with $10,000 to pay the fine or else. So naturally, the Possum Lodge gang proceeds to build a rather nice looking goose out of duct tape to enter the annual Duct Tape competition in Minnesota since third prize happens to be $10,000. However, the Evil Rich Guy has plans for taking over the property and does everything possible to stop Red from succeeding.On the positive side, Red Green (Steve Smith) is a natural in front of the camera and behind it as well since he narrates the story. He manages to pull out some laughs and keep things rolling. However, the real star is Patrick McKenna who really imbues Harold with more thought, energy and depth than ever seen before. Although his relationship with Deputy Dawn (Melissa DiMarco) is way underdeveloped and makes little sense at all, this is arguably the best Harold story ever.Other great touches include the main henchman of the Evil Rich Guy who is constantly eating, a visit with Ranger Gord (Peter Keleghan) who is just too darn excited about seeing ANYONE, and the all-too-brief appearance of everyone's favorite dynamite expert Edgar K. B. Montrose (Graham Greene) whose reactions are just perfect in the two minutes he's on-screen.Unfortunately, the story is so ill-conceived and poorly executed that it works against the flow of the plot which undermines a lot of humorous possibilities. The Evil Rich Guy story is older than dirt and frankly just doesn't work (in Canada, rich people apparently can own a town Sheriff). Red's visit to the Records Office just makes no sense at all since they owe the court the $10,000 meaning he shouldn't be stopping along the way and wasting time. The climatic ending where the duct tape goose manages to reach the competition (like you didn't think that was going to happen) is not really funny and works on a level of humor far different than the rest of the film...not to mention different physics. Plus, what's the conversion rate of US dollars to Canadian dollars?...Yea, the movie didn't take that into account either.Given the numerous characters that fill Possum Lodge, a ""scavenger-hunt"" type storyline involving all of them would have been far stronger or at least more entertaining than this mess which was seemingly cooked up by people having little to do with the show...or at least that is what it seems. Instead, we get what appears to be a quickly written up script for a movie that is not very well photographed or edited for that matter. Almost all of Possum Lodge's most beloved characters, save for Red, Harold and arguably Dalton Humphrey (Bob Bainborough) are barely seen which is really disappointing.Having said all that, I do enjoy seeing Red Green and his nephew Harold to the point of giving this film essentially a pass at three stars. If you like ""The New Red Green Show"", then you will probably at least tolerate this movie. If you have never seen the show, then by all means do NOT watch this movie until you have seen several episodes which are far, far superior than what's in this film.",3,Red Can't Quite Keep His Stick on the Humor,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,3599,"['watched', 'Red', 'Green', 'Show', 'years', 'PBS', 'Red', 'Green', 'suppose', 'Canada', 'response', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'vice', 'versa', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'male-oriented', 'show', 'demonstrating', 'foibles', 'fallacies', 'men', 'hobbies', 'point', 'somebody', 'money', 'must', 'have', 'said', 'Let', 'make', 'Red', 'Green', 'movie', 'was', 'result.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'surface', 'Possum', 'Lodge', 'being', 'threatened', 'Evil', 'Rich', 'Guy', 'limo', 'was', 'accidentally', 'destroyed', 'apparently', 'visiting', 'property', 'court', 'Red', 'crew', '10', 'days', 'come', 'up', '10,000', 'pay', 'fine', 'else', 'So', 'naturally', 'Possum', 'Lodge', 'gang', 'proceeds', 'build', 'rather', 'nice', 'looking', 'goose', 'duct', 'tape', 'enter', 'annual', 'Duct', 'Tape', 'competition', 'Minnesota', 'third', 'prize', 'be', '10,000', 'However', 'Evil', 'Rich', 'Guy', 'plans', 'taking', 'over', 'property', 'everything', 'possible', 'stop', 'Red', 'succeeding.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Red', 'Green', 'Steve', 'Smith', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'behind', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'pull', 'out', 'laughs', 'keep', 'things', 'rolling', 'However', 'real', 'star', 'Patrick', 'McKenna', 'who', 'really', 'Harold', 'more', 'thought', 'energy', 'depth', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'relationship', 'Deputy', 'Dawn', 'Melissa', 'DiMarco', 'way', 'underdeveloped', 'little', 'sense', 'arguably', 'best', 'Harold', 'story', 'ever.Other', 'great', 'touches', 'include', 'main', 'henchman', 'Evil', 'Rich', 'Guy', 'who', 'constantly', 'eating', 'visit', 'Ranger', 'Gord', 'Peter', 'Keleghan', 'who', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'excited', 'seeing', 'ANYONE', 'all-too-brief', 'appearance', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'dynamite', 'expert', 'Edgar', 'K.', 'B.', 'Montrose', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'reactions', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'two', 'minutes', 'on-screen.Unfortunately', 'story', 'so', 'ill-conceived', 'poorly', 'executed', 'flow', 'plot', 'lot', 'humorous', 'possibilities', 'Evil', 'Rich', 'Guy', 'story', 'older', 'dirt', 'frankly', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Canada', 'rich', 'people', 'apparently', 'can', 'own', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'Red', 'visit', 'Records', 'Office', 'just', 'sense', 'owe', 'court', '10,000', 'meaning', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopping', 'way', 'wasting', 'time', 'climatic', 'ending', 'where', 'duct', 'tape', 'goose', 'manages', 'reach', 'competition', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'level', 'humor', 'far', 'different', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'different', 'physics', 'what', 'conversion', 'rate', 'US', 'dollars', 'Canadian', 'dollars', 'Yea', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'either.Given', 'numerous', 'characters', 'fill', 'Possum', 'Lodge', 'scavenger-hunt', 'type', 'storyline', 'involving', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'stronger', 'least', 'more', 'entertaining', 'mess', 'was', 'seemingly', 'cooked', 'up', 'people', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'show', 'least', 'what', 'Instead', 'get', 'what', 'be', 'quickly', 'written', 'up', 'script', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'photographed', 'edited', 'matter', 'Almost', 'Possum', 'Lodge', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'save', 'Red', 'Harold', 'arguably', 'Dalton', 'Humphrey', 'Bob', 'Bainborough', 'are', 'barely', 'seen', 'really', 'disappointing.Having', 'said', 'do', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Red', 'Green', 'nephew', 'Harold', 'point', 'giving', 'film', 'essentially', 'pass', 'three', 'stars', 'like', 'New', 'Red', 'Green', 'Show', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'least', 'tolerate', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'means', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'what', 'film']",N/A

I admit, I found it a little odd seeing the gang in a movie for the first time.  Those who are use to the show's format will have to adjust in order to appreciate the movie. I know with me the first time I viewed it I was not thrilled.  But a subsequnt viewing made me enjoy it a lot more.  I think Red Green is kinda like that.  When you first view it you kind of dismiss it, but something draws you back none the less, and then it gradually grows on you like a fungus!  Give this movie a chance to do the same thing.  True, its a little silly and sentimantal, perhaps more so than the Show for sure, but that's the why movies are these days.  Red and his characters actually have to sustain some longer scenes, and the production value is deffinitely better than what we are accustomed to on the show.  Harold seems to be the main character who gets to evolve, just a little bit, and he gets his first kiss with the female cop which was a bit hooky, but thats the movies!  I wonder if they have sheriffs in Canada? Thought it might be Constables more on the English model.  Was not sure on that point, but one really should not ask these kinds of questions with Red Green!  An added feature are the behind the scenes notes on the making of the movie where many amusing interviews of the charaters are shown.  This could be a real plus for the viewer even more than the movie perhaps.  Overall, Red Green fans should enjoy it. This is the kind of film with a built in audience. I would recommend first time viewers to see some of the shows before checking out the movie. That way they can understand the strange way that Red Green works. Otherwise, sit back, lower your standards and enjoy!",5,Duct Taped Comedy,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,1774,"['Anyone', 'who', 'Red', 'Green', 'Show', 'should', 'take', 'movie', 'duck', 'water', 'admit', 'found', 'little', 'odd', 'seeing', 'gang', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'who', 'are', 'use', 'show', 'format', 'will', 'have', 'adjust', 'order', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'subsequnt', 'viewing', 'made', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'Red', 'Green', 'kinda', 'When', 'first', 'view', 'kind', 'dismiss', 'something', 'draws', 'back', 'none', 'less', 'then', 'gradually', 'fungus', 'Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'True', 'little', 'silly', 'sentimantal', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'Show', 'sure', 'why', 'movies', 'are', 'days', 'Red', 'characters', 'actually', 'have', 'sustain', 'longer', 'scenes', 'production', 'value', 'deffinitely', 'better', 'what', 'are', 'accustomed', 'show', 'Harold', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'evolve', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'kiss', 'female', 'cop', 'was', 'bit', 'hooky', 'movies', 'wonder', 'have', 'sheriffs', 'Canada', 'Thought', 'might', 'be', 'Constables', 'more', 'English', 'model', 'Was', 'not', 'sure', 'point', 'one', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'ask', 'kinds', 'questions', 'Red', 'Green', 'added', 'feature', 'are', 'scenes', 'notes', 'making', 'movie', 'where', 'many', 'amusing', 'interviews', 'charaters', 'are', 'shown', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'plus', 'viewer', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'Overall', 'Red', 'Green', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'film', 'built', 'audience', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', 'time', 'viewers', 'see', 'shows', 'checking', 'out', 'movie', 'way', 'can', 'understand', 'strange', 'way', 'Red', 'Green', 'Otherwise', 'sit', 'back', 'lower', 'standards', 'enjoy']",N/A
746820,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00008R9KR,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[4, 5]","Perhaps the easiest way to describe ""Duct Tape Forever"" is to say that it's better than ""Cabin Boy."" If you understand that, you don't need to read any further.""DTF"" is the movie version of ""The Red Green Show,"" a CBC production shown only on PBS stations in the US (and on CBC, if your cable or satellite system carries it). It's hard to describe in a few words, other than to say it's about the ""inadequacy"" of the human male, while also conveying an implicit misogyny, in a Zoroastrian sort of way. Though ""Home Improvement"" starts from roughly the same base, ""Red Green"" is a great deal cleverer and wittier, and is devoid of the annoyance of being a ""family"" sitcom.Steve Smith, the show's co-creator, is a writer possessed of dry, subversive wit. In the ""making of"" featurette (included on the DVD) he gives a guided tour of his private trailer and its cheap accoutrements. He explains that the TV's remote control is best used to turn off the TV, ""because you have no cable or no aerial or anything. I mean, it's like having TV in Baffin Island."" Pointing to the microwave oven, he informs us that ""This is mainly where I do my viewing. You get a bag of the Jiffy-Pop type popcorn -- especially with the foil on -- you put it in there and set it for around 20 minutes, and that's as good as any episode of `Matlock' you'll ever see."" In detailing the need for stunt doubles, he tells us ""When you kill someone in a movie and they're not a stunt person, you can get into some trouble for that.""This is pretty funny on paper, but it's even funnier in the delivery, because Steve Smith gives it what can only be described as a schizophrenic or Cubist reading -- you hear the material simultaneously from two perspectives -- Steve Smith the writer, and Red Green the character. It's all very post(?)-post-modern, with the actor occupying two distinct psychological spaces at the same time (ie, ""inside"" and ""outside"" his character).Despite being filmed on a budget that would barely cover the catering charges of a Hollywood blockbuster, ""DTF"" is a visually slick production. If you're expecting something as sloppily assembled as ""Strange Brew,"" you'll be pleasantly surprised. Steve Smith had the good sense to hire a talented director, cinematographer, and editor, and it shows.""Strange Brew"" had Max von Sydow. ""DTF"" has Patrick McKenna, probably the only actor who can turn the need for orthodontic work into an artistic statement. He has a lot of screen time and several scenes that really show off his acting chops, which are considerable. He also gets the funniest line in the film.""Red Green"" has never shied away from slapstick (slapstick and duct tape are natural partners), so the film has plenty of visual humor, even borrowing a classic gag from Buster Keaton. My only quibble is with the film's climax, where the slapstick gets out of hand, in a scene that must have had many viewers squirming and groaning.One final, semi-personal comment... Steve Smith seems to have a Norma-Desmondish obsession with being middle-aged. I would simply suggest he stay away from wide-angle lenses, the nasally deleterious effects of which can be seen on the move's poster.Warning to videophiles... The box is labeled ""anamorphic widescreen,"" but the transfer is conventional 4:3 letterbox.
