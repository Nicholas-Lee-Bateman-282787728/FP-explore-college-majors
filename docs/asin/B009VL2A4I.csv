1602683,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B009VL2A4I,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[2, 4]","Coming of age, in a small town near Charleston SC, are a group of high school seniors involved in their local Baptist church's drama and music ministry.  The film focuses primarily on three of these students:  Brea, daughter of the church's minister but who finds herself questioning her Christian beliefs; Tim, a very personable and talented young man who has revealed - to his single dad and closest friends - that he is gay; and Laura, an ambitious and focused girl who expresses doubts at the revelations of the other two.  They are involved in an Easter pageant, under the direction of  Austin (Stephen Cone, who also wrote and directed the film), whose working with the self-assured Tim makes him suspect what may be the reason for his own passion-less eight year marriage.  While most of the graduates will be going to nearby colleges, Brea and Tim will be attending schools in New York City, which makes their friends and family wonder if and how it will change them.With a tiny budget, Cone manages to create a film that feels understated and subtle, while at the same time riveting the viewer and delivering a cohesive, powerful message of self-acceptance, diversity and true friendship.  It does not challenge religion or sexuality, but reinforces that they can coincide among people who respect each other.  The acting is superb, especially Tyler Ross (who also starred in ""Nate and Margaret) as Tim, and Molly Kunz as the complex yet relatable Brea. Won highest awards at the Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta and Memphis LGBT film festivals, and awarded a Critic's Pick by the New York Times.  DVD extras include a ""making of"" feature and discussion of the treatment of religion and homosexuality in the film.  Not rated, but likely a PG-13, appropriate (and recommended) for mixed audiences.  My favorite for the year, thus far, and I give it a full five stars out of five.",5,Understated yet outstanding slice of life in small Southern town,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1890,"['Coming', 'age', 'small', 'town', 'Charleston', 'SC', 'are', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'involved', 'local', 'Baptist', 'church', 'drama', 'music', 'ministry', 'film', 'primarily', 'three', 'students', 'Brea', 'daughter', 'church', 'minister', 'who', 'questioning', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'Tim', 'very', 'personable', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'revealed', 'single', 'dad', 'closest', 'friends', 'gay', 'Laura', 'ambitious', 'focused', 'girl', 'who', 'doubts', 'revelations', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'involved', 'Easter', 'pageant', 'direction', 'Austin', 'Stephen', 'Cone', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'working', 'self-assured', 'Tim', 'suspect', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'own', 'passion-less', 'eight', 'year', 'marriage', 'most', 'graduates', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'nearby', 'colleges', 'Brea', 'Tim', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'schools', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'friends', 'family', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'change', 'them.With', 'tiny', 'budget', 'Cone', 'create', 'film', 'understated', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'riveting', 'viewer', 'delivering', 'cohesive', 'powerful', 'message', 'self-acceptance', 'diversity', 'true', 'friendship', 'not', 'challenge', 'religion', 'sexuality', 'reinforces', 'can', 'coincide', 'people', 'who', 'respect', 'other', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'Tyler', 'Ross', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Nate', 'Margaret', 'Tim', 'Molly', 'Kunz', 'complex', 'yet', 'relatable', 'Brea', 'Won', 'highest', 'awards', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Atlanta', 'Memphis', 'LGBT', 'film', 'festivals', 'awarded', 'Critic', 'Pick', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'making', 'feature', 'discussion', 'treatment', 'religion', 'homosexuality', 'film', 'Not', 'rated', 'likely', 'PG-13', 'appropriate', 'recommended', 'mixed', 'audiences', 'favorite', 'year', 'thus', 'far', 'give', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'five']",The Wise Kids
1602684,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B009VL2A4I,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[2, 2]","Outstanding performances from the young ensemble cast, especially Tyler Ross (star ofNate & Margaret) highlight this dramatic film which actually follows 2 very deep storylines.  The primary focus is on teenager Tim (played by Ross) as he maneuvers his Baptist upbringing with the realization he is gay.  His closest friends take 2 sides as they come to terms with something that challenges their faith.Meanwhile, Austin (played by Stephen Cone) is the involved church member.  He and his wife are leading the church production.  As Tim begins to accept and embrace his sexuality (alongside a supportive father), the event triggers Austin to question his own sexuality.  Dramatic and complex, everything changes, more so for Austin than Tim.  A visible stark contrast is present between the two experiences.  After all, for Tim, college life and his entire future await.  For Austin, the challenge is far more engrossing - a prominent church position, a wife - what are his next steps?If only films like this would make it mainstream - it would do the world well to see the comprehensive battles individuals face during coming out, especially for those late in life.The production is a mix of Lifetime Movie meets Afterschool Special meets Christian programming.  At times, the acting / flow can be quite annoying but overall, the production - and the message - carries the film.  No doubt a low-budget production, the music soundtrack is actually quite impressive.  For me, one of the most endearing scenes was the birthday dance, which featured the song ""Crosswalk Stereo"" by The Pass.  Parts of the film, along with the character Tim reminded me of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", minus the big Hollywood financing.Watch carefully, and you'll catch the message in some of the final conversations in the closing scene.  Powerful, dramatic, The Wise Kids provides a forum for a critical message about understanding and acceptance.",4,A Dramatic Embrace of Understanding in Two Intersecting Storylines,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,1934,"['Outstanding', 'performances', 'young', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'especially', 'Tyler', 'Ross', 'star', 'ofNate', 'Margaret', 'highlight', 'dramatic', 'film', 'actually', '2', 'very', 'deep', 'storylines', 'primary', 'focus', 'teenager', 'Tim', 'played', 'Ross', 'Baptist', 'upbringing', 'realization', 'gay', 'closest', 'friends', 'take', '2', 'sides', 'come', 'terms', 'something', 'faith.Meanwhile', 'Austin', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Cone', 'involved', 'church', 'member', 'wife', 'are', 'leading', 'church', 'production', 'Tim', 'accept', 'embrace', 'sexuality', 'supportive', 'father', 'event', 'Austin', 'question', 'own', 'sexuality', 'Dramatic', 'complex', 'everything', 'changes', 'more', 'so', 'Austin', 'Tim', 'A', 'visible', 'stark', 'contrast', 'present', 'two', 'experiences', 'Tim', 'college', 'life', 'entire', 'future', 'await', 'Austin', 'challenge', 'far', 'more', 'engrossing', 'prominent', 'church', 'position', 'wife', 'what', 'are', 'next', 'steps', 'only', 'would', 'make', 'would', 'do', 'world', 'well', 'see', 'comprehensive', 'battles', 'individuals', 'face', 'coming', 'out', 'especially', 'late', 'life.The', 'production', 'mix', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Afterschool', 'Special', 'meets', 'Christian', 'programming', 'times', 'acting', '/', 'flow', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'overall', 'production', 'message', 'film', 'doubt', 'low-budget', 'production', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'scenes', 'was', 'birthday', 'dance', 'featured', 'song', 'Crosswalk', 'Stereo', 'Pass', 'Parts', 'film', 'character', 'Tim', 'reminded', 'Perks', 'Being', 'Wallflower', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'financing.Watch', 'carefully', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'message', 'final', 'conversations', 'closing', 'scene', 'Powerful', 'dramatic', 'Wise', 'Kids', 'forum', 'critical', 'message', 'understanding', 'acceptance']",The Wise Kids

The script and the directing, however, were pretty darn bad. There were one or two poignant moments worthy of being put onscreen; unfortunately, the writer/director appears to have felt like one of these moments happened every two minutes. There were ridiculously drawn-out scenes and conversations, vacant stares, knowing looks... but instead of being poignant they were just roll-your-eyes silly. I don't mind slow films when there's a point to them moving slow and there's enough dramatic tension or eye candy or beautiful cinematography or something onscreen to hold my interest, but this movie seemed to be slow just because the script was shorter than the film the director wanted to make. Both the actors and the film took... forever... to... say... anything... and... in... the... end... didn't... have... much... to... say... at... all. But the main actor was cute enough and the intentions were good enough that I'll give it three stars.

1602688,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B009VL2A4I,J. Martin,"[4, 4]","Wow. Movies don't get much better than this little gem.Nothing is either predictable or stereotyped, none of the characters are one-dimensional villains or good guys, gays don't hate Christians and Christians don't hate gays, homos and heteros get along okay - and yet (and this is the movie's most astounding accomplishment) every person in it is real and complex and nobody gets shoehorned into a false and creepy ""let's all just love one another"" box.These are real people, doing what real people do in tough situations. Not ranting at each other like the morons on talk radio and in Congress but living together, working through their differences instead of using the differences to attack each other.Without ever being the least bit sappy or manipulative or simplistic, this movie shows what love is: Loving is hard most of the time, and it hurts - a LOT - sometimes, but it's worth every tear and every drop of blood it costs.This is a fantastic movie. The actors are great, every last one of them (although Allison Torem as Laura is electrifying, the steady, pulsing heart of the movie); the story and dialog are smart without ever seeming to be smart, interesting and entertaining without ever being mindless: just people talking to each other about things that matter to them; and the direction by Stephen Cone - pulling all of this together so beautifully and so powerfully, while writing AND producing AND acting one of the main roles - is just astounding.I cannot praise this movie highly enough or recommend it enthusiastically enough.
