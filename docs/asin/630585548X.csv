Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[4, 7]","Although no classic Dinosaur Valley Girls contains enough silliness to make it a watchable Saturday afternoon time waster. Writer/director Donald Glut makes darn certain that the viewer knows that this is a joke (he all but pummels us over the head with it) and that makes up for the really bad special effects (considering that this was made for a measly ...though I think that it is understandable). The cast is obviously having fun goofing off in front of the camera and it's contagious.

I like seeing attractive women come out of their clothes as much as the next red-blooded guy, but there are far better DVD's for that than this one. I did not expect much of a story line with a title like this, so at least that wasn't a shock. A modern day actor gets 'magically' transported back to prehistoric days. And oh, what luck. The stone age men and women have had a little tiff and are now living apart, and our 'hero' (cough, cough) ends up in the girls' camp. But none of the cast could act their way out of a wet paper sack if their lives depended on it. The so-called 'dinosaurs' are among the cheapest, most cheesy looking I've ever witnessed in a film. You can see better effects done by amateurs on YouTube. As for the women, most are decently attractive, but for me, it was the dusky-skinned Arkeni (Ta-mee) who stole the show. And what WAS it with the retard names? Deb-bee, Bar-bee, Mee-shell, Ro-kell, enough already. If you catch this one on sale or in your local big box store's bargain bin, it's money that won't be terribly wasted.

There are other actors and actresses that play extra parts I suppose.

The acting is of course very campy and lame, but any guy over 5 years old will want to watch it start to finish, regardless of which version being shown.

481168,A38ZTUNQJVGP6S,630585548X,Michael Patrick Boyd,"[0, 0]","Dinosaur Valley Girls is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released on video on September 16, 1997. The movie tells the story of actor Tony Markham who star is eroding due to his pack a day smoking. His wife or live in girlfriend (the movie does not say) is whinny and uses Tony to try to advanced her career. Tony is also somewhat miserable with his life. While practicing his martial arts, a vision of a cavewoman flashes before his eyes. He decides to head over to a dinosaur museum after sparring. While at the museum, he is shown an unusual artifact and it transport him back a million plus year in time. There the movie really begins to fall apart. Basically a cave girl named Hea-Thor takes Tony in after he rescues her. Tony meets several other cave girls back at the cave and his new life begins. Tony begins to like this new life and even starts dressing in that time period. One evening cavemen capture the cavewomen and take them back to their cave and do a period cave rape\sex. No matter how you look at it, it is corny either way. Tony and Hea-Thor come to the rescue but the cavewomen have everything under control. In the end Tony decides to stay with Hea-Thor. Dinosaur Valley Girls does not have a really good story nor is the acting really great. The only thing this movie has going for it is sexy topless girls.
