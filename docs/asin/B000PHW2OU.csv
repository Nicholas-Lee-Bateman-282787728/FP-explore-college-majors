It really is a bunch of Horny guys trying to peep and the girls who came to their school for the summer. There were some parts with the guys that were really disturbing for me. The main characters were likable as well as the other girls. It wasn't until the last couple episodes that I actually became interested and the actual plot was revealed. It's OKAY for a starter Anime.,3,I got it for $13,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,459,"['title', 'bought', '13', 'bucks', 'Best', 'Buy', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'really', 'bunch', 'Horny', 'guys', 'trying', 'peep', 'girls', 'who', 'came', 'school', 'summer', 'were', 'parts', 'guys', 'were', 'really', 'disturbing', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'girls', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'couple', 'actually', 'became', 'interested', 'actual', 'plot', 'was', 'revealed', 'OKAY', 'starter', 'Anime']",N/A

(yes, it happened while locked in a room together, oh so painful!)I endured pain throughout each episode hoping that it would get better, it didn't :(  If they could have just dropped the first 10 episodes and kept the final ones, it would have been a much better series.Seriously, watching three loser boys, looking through knot holes in a fence into the girls bath, and then getting caught, come on?  Can't they come up with anything better?If you just want fan service, then yes, by all means, please buy two copies, but there are so many other anime series you'll find entertaining, funny and yes, stimulating without having to endure 325 minutes of this adolescent drivel!",1,Adolescent Drivel,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,879,"['want', 'watch', 'subpar', 'plot', 'lots', 'breasts', 'jiggling', 'around', 'boobies', 'key', 'word', 'used', 'watching', '3', 'boys', 'engaging', 'fantasy', 'other', 'then', 'anime', 'yes', 'happened', 'locked', 'room', 'together', 'oh', 'so', 'painful', 'endured', 'pain', 'episode', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', 'have', 'just', 'dropped', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'kept', 'final', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'series.Seriously', 'watching', 'three', 'loser', 'boys', 'looking', 'knot', 'holes', 'fence', 'girls', 'bath', 'then', 'getting', 'caught', 'come', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'better', 'just', 'want', 'fan', 'service', 'then', 'yes', 'means', 'please', 'buy', 'two', 'copies', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'anime', 'series', ""'ll"", 'find', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'yes', 'stimulating', 'having', 'endure', '325', 'minutes', 'adolescent', 'drivel']",N/A

The subtitles match the English voice track pretty well so there's not much to lose listening to the Japanese.I found it sufficiently different in story and character detail from other anime to be a worthwhile addition to my collection.It has a VERY strong fanservice content, a middling comedy aspect and a nicely handled romantic story line. Sure, there are some ecchi aspects that were not my cup of tea, but on the whole I enjoyed it.",4,It's not THAT bad,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,519,"['watched', 'need', 'something', 'light-hearted', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'subtitles', 'match', 'English', 'voice', 'track', 'pretty', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'lose', 'listening', 'Japanese.I', 'found', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'story', 'character', 'detail', 'other', 'anime', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'collection.It', 'VERY', 'strong', 'fanservice', 'content', 'middling', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'nicely', 'handled', 'romantic', 'story', 'line', 'Sure', 'are', 'ecchi', 'aspects', 'were', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'whole', 'enjoyed']",N/A

However, the title of the set (Green Green Complete) is a bit misleading, because there is technically one more episode that was never released in the United States.  Each disc contains four episodes of the series, as well as some extras ans trailers.  The extras came from three character DVDs that were released in Japan back in 2003 and 2004; these extras include mini-episodes, music videos for ""character songs,"" television spots, textless version of the opening, textless version of the closing, as well as three alternate closing sequences.Green Green is ultimately mindless ""fan service"" entertainment, but it was done in such a way that it was enjoyable viewing.

Baltz,"[19, 25]","Green Green has a great opening sequence, awesome extra content on each disk, and is available at one of the best prices I've ever seen for an anime collection. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it that's good.I didn't like any of the character designs, and many of them I found extremely annoying. The storyline is nonexistent; it's just a bunch of horny highschool boys chasing after a bunch of girls for 12 episodes. And while this sounds like it should be the setting for a great comedy, it's not. I didn't laugh once during the entire series.Normally I love anything with fanservice no matter how bad the story is, but even with the abundant girls Green Green just wasn't at all entertaining to me. Moreover, while I was watching I just wanted to turn it off and never watch it again, that's how bad it is.I can only recommend Green Green for the most hardcore of anime collectors, anyone else shouldn't waste their money.",2,Too good to be true..,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,935,"['Green', 'Green', 'great', 'opening', 'sequence', 'awesome', 'extra', 'content', 'disk', 'available', 'one', 'best', 'prices', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'collection', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'say', 'good.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'designs', 'many', 'found', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'storyline', 'nonexistent', 'just', 'bunch', 'horny', 'highschool', 'boys', 'chasing', 'bunch', 'girls', '12', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'setting', 'great', 'comedy', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'entire', 'series.Normally', 'love', 'anything', 'fanservice', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'story', 'even', 'abundant', 'girls', 'Green', 'Green', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'Moreover', 'was', 'watching', 'just', 'wanted', 'turn', 'off', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'Green', 'Green', 'most', 'hardcore', 'anime', 'collectors', 'anyone', 'else', 'should', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money']",N/A
