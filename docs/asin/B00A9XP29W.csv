I have almost all her DVDs and enjoy the balance between cardio and strength training. This one fell a bit short for me. You will get a good strength workout, but be aware that there is essentially no cardio. This is not a bad thing, you just need to be aware of what you're getting.she uses tried and true exercises, no fanfare, but the reps seem to go on forever. Even the women working out with her in the DVD seem to get a bit tired of doing the same move ad infinitum. You will feel the muscle burn but I got bored. Also, in the cons category the ""background"" music seemed a bit too loud and was obtrusive.still if you can push past the distracting music and repetitive repetitions, this might be one for you.",3,Good but Flawed,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,854,"['have', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'really', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'Jari', 'Love', 'supportive', 'encouraging', 'instructor', 'stuff', 'have', 'almost', 'DVDs', 'enjoy', 'balance', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'one', 'fell', 'bit', 'short', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'strength', 'workout', 'be', 'aware', 'essentially', 'cardio', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting.she', 'uses', 'tried', 'true', 'exercises', 'fanfare', 'reps', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'Even', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'DVD', 'seem', 'get', 'bit', 'tired', 'doing', 'same', 'move', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'will', 'feel', 'muscle', 'burn', 'got', 'bored', 'Also', 'cons', 'category', 'background', 'music', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'loud', 'was', 'obtrusive.still', 'can', 'push', 'distracting', 'music', 'repetitive', 'repetitions', 'might', 'be', 'one']",Get Extremely RIPPED! and Chiseled Exercise & Fitness
1607037,A7A9DGPLJL1BM,B00A9XP29W,Carmel K. Dunlap,"[1, 1]","I loved this dvd from the first time I did it.  I even enjoy the warm up, which I often skip on many other dvds as it seems to be mainly stretching but Jari gets you moving right off and I feel great to start the rest of the workout.  After the warm up she does crouching squats, which look a bit funny but they are incredibly effective!  I usually end up getting sore from doing this dvd and I would consider myself in pretty good shape.  My daughter also works out and is in track at school and she did this dvd and could barely walk two days later!  It does advertise that it has 2-30 minute workouts, which is misleading as they are indeed each longer than 30 min.  But the way it is set up you could do only 30 min by just stopping before the segment is entirely over.  I usually keep this one for when I have a day off so that I can do the 40+ min. segments and get the full effect.  I have done the entire workout in one session and if you do it that way be aware that it is very long....longer than an hour.  Haven't had time to do the entire thing lately but believe me, you will get a great workout by just doing either of the shorter workouts.  One reviewer mentioned that there is no cardio on this.  While I wouldn't consider it to be a cardio workout, there are certain segments that definitely get your heart pumping and get the sweat pouring.  If that isn't cardio, I'm not sure what is!  I find it to be a nice mix of cardio and strength.  I know I feel great after I'm done!",5,my absolute fav!,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1492,"['loved', 'dvd', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'even', 'enjoy', 'warm', 'up', 'often', 'skip', 'many', 'other', 'dvds', 'be', 'mainly', 'stretching', 'Jari', 'moving', 'right', 'feel', 'great', 'start', 'rest', 'workout', 'warm', 'up', 'crouching', 'squats', 'look', 'bit', 'funny', 'are', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'sore', 'doing', 'dvd', 'would', 'consider', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'daughter', 'also', 'out', 'track', 'school', 'did', 'dvd', 'could', 'barely', 'walk', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'advertise', '2-30', 'minute', 'workouts', 'misleading', 'are', 'indeed', 'longer', '30', 'min', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'could', 'do', 'only', '30', 'min', 'just', 'stopping', 'segment', 'entirely', 'usually', 'keep', 'one', 'when', 'have', 'day', 'can', 'do', '40+', 'min', 'segments', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'have', 'done', 'entire', 'workout', 'one', 'session', 'do', 'way', 'be', 'aware', 'very', 'long', '.longer', 'hour', 'Have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'do', 'entire', 'thing', 'lately', 'believe', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'just', 'doing', 'shorter', 'workouts', 'One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'cardio', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'cardio', 'workout', 'are', 'certain', 'segments', 'definitely', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'get', 'sweat', 'pouring', ""n't"", 'cardio', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'find', 'be', 'nice', 'mix', 'cardio', 'strength', 'know', 'feel', 'great', ""'m"", 'done']",Get Extremely RIPPED! and Chiseled Exercise & Fitness
