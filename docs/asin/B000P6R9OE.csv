1068938,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000P6R9OE,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 10]","Certainly NOMAD has some of the best horse riding scenes, swordplay, and scrumptious landscape cinematography you'll likely see, but this isn't what makes a film good. It helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things. And that's where Nomad wanders.The story is stilted, giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a ""cool"" movie that ""looks"" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and it's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they damn well better use actors/actresses that look the part.Warring tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our ""heroes"", are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during its filming, specifically the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the changing over to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I sense comes from Bodrov's eyes and not Passer's. A true travesty.The most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film, with both character and action focuses. Unfortunately, the higher-ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap (intellectually speaking) way out.Even though I can't give this film a positive rating, it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work.

1068944,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000P6R9OE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","NOMAD (THE WARRIOR) - (a/k/a NOMAD: THE WARRIOR, 2004, released 2006) - is one of the weirdest films I've ever encountered. I suppose it ought to be since it is a Kazakhstani film. To quote the story behind it: due to financial and weather problems, the film shut down halfway through in 2004. It was bought by brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein and completed in early 2005, but director Ivan Passer and cinematographer Ueli Steiger were replaced by Sergey Bodrov and Dan Laustsen. I also know a second-unit director was hired, I forget his name!Mexican hunk Kuno Becker (From Prada to Nada) plays ""Ablai"" Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan and leader of the Kazakh tribal nation. Set in the region of the Russian steppes (roughly from the Caucasus down to the tip of Afghanistan, including modern Kazakhstan) and set in the 18th century A.D., it purports to tell something of the history of that region.Jason Scott Lee plays Oraz, some sort of martial arts wizard/Muslim wise man whose task it is to hide the Great Khan's baby. He trains the child until a ready warrior comes out the other side of the timeline ... and do not ask me to explain anything further. This thing is so muddled and awful that it made my head spin. All I could really gather is that this is about ""Ablai"" Khan, and judging by the period this is not meant to be one and the same as Kublai Khan. I also gathered that the Kazakhs were pretty angry at the ""Jungars"" - a Chinese/Tibetan sort of people.Let me address another strange item: this film has always been touted as being in the Kazakhstan language and subtitled in English. The film I saw (both times I saw it, once when new and recently) had obvious English spoken parts, in English, and everyone else spoke in English also - clearly dubbed because their words patently did not match their oral motions! Kindly do not tell me this is because it was meant to be dubbed into Kazakh as well as English. That does not wash with me.The thing is really poorly filmed and tough to follow. The language issue was not a problem, since as I said, this was all in English and most of the actors were clearly meant to be speaking English. I did not hear a word of Kazakh, much to my disappointment. Then again, this whole stupid thing is a disappointment. For example: who gladly gave the Jungars the cannons to use against the Great Khan? Why did they not seem to raise much of a fuss when Ablai Khan escaped from their clutches? Who is the foolish Kazakh girl who was kidnapped then saved years later?!So many headaches that I can only warn you away from this fetid piece of crap. Oh, what might have been done with an excellent director and writer: the history of Kazakhstan. It matters little what sort of work goes into a film that is ultimately stupid, muddled, slow, hard to follow ... and apparently unfinished with no sequel in sight.",2,See what happens when you give Kazakhstanis a camera!!,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,2862,"['NOMAD', 'THE', 'WARRIOR', 'a/k/a', 'NOMAD', 'WARRIOR', '2004', 'released', '2006', 'one', 'weirdest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'suppose', 'ought', 'be', 'Kazakhstani', 'film', 'quote', 'story', 'due', 'financial', 'weather', 'problems', 'film', 'shut', 'down', 'halfway', '2004', 'was', 'bought', 'brothers', 'Bob', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'completed', 'early', '2005', 'director', 'Ivan', 'Passer', 'cinematographer', 'Ueli', 'Steiger', 'were', 'replaced', 'Sergey', 'Bodrov', 'Dan', 'Laustsen', 'also', 'know', 'second-unit', 'director', 'was', 'hired', 'forget', 'name', 'Mexican', 'hunk', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'Prada', 'Nada', 'Ablai', 'Khan', 'descendant', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'leader', 'Kazakh', 'tribal', 'nation', 'Set', 'region', 'Russian', 'steppes', 'roughly', 'Caucasus', 'down', 'tip', 'Afghanistan', 'including', 'modern', 'Kazakhstan', 'set', '18th', 'century', 'A.D.', 'tell', 'something', 'history', 'region.Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'Oraz', 'sort', 'martial', 'arts', 'wizard/Muslim', 'wise', 'man', 'task', 'hide', 'Great', 'Khan', 'baby', 'child', 'ready', 'warrior', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'timeline', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'explain', 'anything', 'further', 'thing', 'so', 'muddled', 'awful', 'made', 'head', 'spin', 'could', 'really', 'gather', 'Ablai', 'Khan', 'judging', 'period', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'Kublai', 'Khan', 'also', 'gathered', 'Kazakhs', 'were', 'pretty', 'angry', 'Jungars', 'Chinese/Tibetan', 'sort', 'people.Let', 'strange', 'item', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'touted', 'being', 'Kazakhstan', 'language', 'subtitled', 'English', 'film', 'saw', 'times', 'saw', 'once', 'when', 'new', 'recently', 'had', 'obvious', 'English', 'spoken', 'parts', 'English', 'everyone', 'else', 'spoke', 'English', 'also', 'clearly', 'dubbed', 'words', 'patently', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'oral', 'motions', 'Kindly', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'dubbed', 'Kazakh', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'not', 'wash', 'me.The', 'thing', 'really', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'tough', 'follow', 'language', 'issue', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'said', 'was', 'English', 'most', 'actors', 'were', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'speaking', 'English', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'word', 'Kazakh', 'much', 'disappointment', 'Then', 'again', 'whole', 'stupid', 'thing', 'disappointment', 'example', 'who', 'gladly', 'gave', 'Jungars', 'cannons', 'use', 'Great', 'Khan', 'Why', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'raise', 'much', 'fuss', 'when', 'Ablai', 'Khan', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'Who', 'foolish', 'Kazakh', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'then', 'saved', 'years', 'later', 'So', 'many', 'headaches', 'can', 'only', 'warn', 'away', 'fetid', 'piece', 'crap', 'Oh', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'excellent', 'director', 'writer', 'history', 'Kazakhstan', 'little', 'what', 'sort', 'work', 'film', 'ultimately', 'stupid', 'muddled', 'slow', 'hard', 'follow', 'apparently', 'unfinished', 'sequel', 'sight']",Nomad: The Warrior
1068945,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000P6R9OE,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","In a time when Antoine Fucqua and Ridley Scott attempt to bring their mythologized heroes down to earth in ""King Arthur"" and ""Robin Hood"" it's odd to see this Ivan Passer film attempt just the opposite. ""Nomad"" deals with a Kazakh warrior, Mansur, who was prophesied to unite all the Kazakh tribes and lead them to victory over the Junger invaders. The movie even takes notes from various ancient stories, including the old and new testaments, where the invading ruler needs to find and kill the prophesied child so said prophecy cannot come to fruition.This is an OK movie. The costumes, sets, use of the landscape and cinematography are all great. The writing, however, pulls everything down. The approach reminded me of epics from the 60s where the characters were more iconic than real. And the actors here could not rise above the stilted dialogue. It were as though the writers knew what needed to be done, but simply did not know how to do it. For instance: (and I don't believe I'm spoiling anything here) As the tribes all rally for the final battle the viewer is not certain why. The movie shows nothing that the hero has done to bring this disparate group of tribes together. And that was the whole point of the movie. That's one example but there are a few more of near equal importance.The directing is uneven. Some of the scenes show great scope and detail. Seeing these people in their native garb and carrying out various tasks and rituals brings much needed life to the proceedings. But some of the climax stuff, fights and battles, aren't up to snuff. As lousy as Hollywood can be with certain things they probably would have done a better job of this than these folks did. They get this sort of thing all too well.This is not a bad watch.

for a going-nowhere movie? thundering like a huge storm was coming, but suddenly all the dark clouds were gone, sun reappeared, not even one drop of rain dropped. that's how bad and how hollow this movie was.then, they also did a very bad casting, chosen two short and lightweight young men to play the major roles. they both failed to deliver a convincing figures but only gave you a small-timer's feeling. this bad casting job also affected this movie greatly.all in all, this movie was a superfluous, lame, crippling try to  tell a great legend in vain. the production of this movie suffered a lot of bad and harsh weather and low temperature, wasted a lot of film and manpower in battle scenes and in the logistic. but nothing was ever correctly and effectively done.it only turned out to be a very hollow and purposeless running-around-for-nothing movie.not recommended. stay away if you don't want to curse afterwards.",2,"a film could be better even great, but",1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,2968,"['ruined', 'lame', 'screenplay', 'storyline', 'movie', 'had', 'spent', 'lot', 'production', 'budget', 'changed', 'two', 'times', 'total', '3', 'directors', 'had', 'screenplay', 'rewritten', 'revised', 'constantly', 'just', 'purpose', 'emphasize', 'battle', 'scenes.jason', 'scott', 'played', 'prophet-like', 'mysterious', 'kosake', 'who', 'predict', 'future', 'strong', 'ruler', 'who', 'unite', 'three', 'tribes.mark', 'dacascos', 'played', 'ruthless', 'general', 'who', 'liked', 'battle', 'kill', 'everyone', 'way', 'later', 'lost', 'head', 'kid', 'had', 'tried', 'kill', '20', 'years', 'ago.okay', 'spoiler', 'spoiler', 'i', ""'d"", 'like', 'stop', 'right', 'here', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'movie', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'moronically', 'lost', 'focus', 'only', 'focused', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'pointless', 'duel', 'scenes', 'had', 'tried', 'first', 'include', 'triagle', 'romance', 'one', 'girl', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'too', 'proved', 'be', 'futile', 'totally', 'wasted', 'storyline', 'went', 'tried', 'vain', 'tell', 'love', 'story', 'triangle', 'romance', 'never', 'developed', 'well', 'thorough', 'enough', 'just', 'other', 'possible', 'subject', 'wanted', 'develop', 'never', 'successfully', 'done.it', 'never', 'told', 'completely', 'how', 'young', 'future', 'ruler', 'finally', 'conquered', 'united', 'tribes', 'stopped', 'suffered', 'sudden', 'death', 'just', 'what', 'usually', 'described', 'person', 'who', 'fell', 'down', 'obvious', 'reason', 'just', 'died', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'suddenly', 'ended', 'then', 'saw', 'black', 'screen', 'floating', 'up', 'names', 'location', 'russian', 'credited', 'names', 'involved.jason', 'scott', 'lee', 'also', 'mysterious', 'disappeared', 'never', 'saw', 'conclusion', 'whatever', 'movie', 'makers', 'really', 'wanted', 'tell', 'was', 'practical', 'joke', 'played', 'viewers', 'knew', 'lights', 'were', 'up', 'audience', 'had', 'stand', 'up', 'leave', 'confused', 'big', 'question', 'mark', 'heh', 'ended', 'what', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'also', 'wasted', 'lot', 'manpower', 'portray', 'great', 'grass', 'land', 'high', 'plateau', 'tents', 'costumes', 'ancient', 'weaponry', 'huge', 'manpower', 'who', 'played', 'fighting', 'tribesmen', 'what', 'going-nowhere', 'movie', 'thundering', 'huge', 'storm', 'was', 'coming', 'suddenly', 'dark', 'clouds', 'were', 'gone', 'sun', 'reappeared', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'drop', 'rain', 'dropped', 'how', 'bad', 'how', 'hollow', 'movie', 'was.then', 'also', 'did', 'very', 'bad', 'casting', 'chosen', 'two', 'short', 'lightweight', 'young', 'men', 'play', 'major', 'roles', 'failed', 'deliver', 'convincing', 'figures', 'only', 'gave', 'small-timer', 'feeling', 'bad', 'casting', 'job', 'also', 'affected', 'movie', 'greatly.all', 'movie', 'was', 'superfluous', 'lame', 'crippling', 'try', 'tell', 'great', 'legend', 'vain', 'production', 'movie', 'suffered', 'lot', 'bad', 'harsh', 'weather', 'low', 'temperature', 'wasted', 'lot', 'film', 'manpower', 'battle', 'scenes', 'logistic', 'nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'correctly', 'effectively', 'only', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'hollow', 'purposeless', 'running-around-for-nothing', 'movie.not', 'recommended', 'stay', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'curse', 'afterwards']",Nomad: The Warrior

Hence the movie is historically inaccurate as it follows a Kazakh nationalist agenda which includes the slightest anti-Russian jabs.Jason Scott Lee, Kuno Becker, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, though I fail to see why foreign actors were used to portray Kazakhs. Moreover, it was rather obvious that the lead actors were ethnically different from the supporting cast to the point that Mansur and his father are as similar as far as both of them belonging to the human race and that's about it (i.e. father and son look nothing like one another).Additionally, Gauhar's capture was a bit ridiculous, thus becoming a bit of a spoiler.Furthermore, those that wrote the Greek subtitles do not know the difference between Cossacks and Kazakhs!!! Amateurs!Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!

There was even something endearingly sweet and charming about it despite all the fighting.Thanks for a hero who is strong and is just a nice guy with inner strength and warrior skills and does not have to rub our face in it with bluster and swagger! These visual cliches could have worked too, but it has been done countless times by John Wayne, Bruce Willis, etc. Becker was a refreshing alternative that worked for me given the script. His people had been waiting for a prophesied warrior-leader -- and he was up to his destiny without having to be theatrically charismatic. In fact he was raised learning to conceal his identity and destiny and that helped make his modesty and quiet strength work for me. Of course the deviation from warrior-hero stereotypes and uncomplicated script also offered fresh meat for the critics who apparently expected it to be in competition with other epics and used them as standards.I don't think the film was over-dramatized or that the blood was gratuitous and this may disappoint some viewers. I am glad that I took some negative reviews with a grain of salt.

Like these mongolian tribes, I couldn't wait to see the child become a great man-warrior while adding to the great settings and costumes of this movie.Then it happens. The child grows up in this beautiful asian land full of beautiful asian people practicing ancient asian customs. Immediately I notice the huge fault in the movie.  The child, who's destined to lead his people, has grown into what looks like a young caucasian male, the least likely actor in the movie to play the role of ""Golden Child"" in an asian land.  Heck, his sidekick who looks Puerto Rican, would've fit the role better than he.I tried but couldn't continue to suspend belief while watching. If I felt like this, I wonder how asian peoples must feel when viewing this movie.  I'm sure the Mexican-American actor playing the role questioned why he was chosen as the lead over say, Jason Scott Lee, the asian looking seer and teacher in the movie.The movie had so much potential.  It had me hooked early.  Until Nomad turned out to be America's next male model. From there the hole story seemed to lose its luster and go into superhero mode. Sorry folks, but this movie is a step backwards for race relations in film. I still can't believe the asian cast agreed to go along with this major fault in the film.

Freeman ""Zach""","[39, 45]","When the only other Kazakhi film on people's minds this year is a Jackass-style pseduo-documentary comedy about a bumbling Kazakhi reporter named Borat, it's probably hard to get people interested in a Kazakhi war epic. Much less one with subtitles. Especially when the cover makes it look like a 300 knockoff or a Gladiator wannabe. But Nomad: The Warrior stands on its own as a sprawling desert landscaped, bloody battlefield epic piece of cinema.Mostly set in Kazakhstan in 1710, Nomad follows the story of a young man who is born to fulfill the prophecy of uniting the three warring sects of his country to rid themselves of their violent enemies once and for all. Spanning over 30 years, the film never flinches as it uncovers intense hardcore battle sequences staged with Braveheart-esque grandiosity. Heads will roll and warriors will run screaming and flaming off camera, all under the watchful eyes of directors Sergei Bodrov and Ivan Passer. The washed out desert landscapes are reminiscent of Gladiator, and while the story itself never reaches the true epic magnificence of the Ridley Scott movie, Nomad does manage to come close, lacking the singular vision and unique story to truly find its place among the famous period epics.Each character here has been powerfully created by this strong multi-cultural cast. Kuno Becker (Goal!, Goal II, Goal!3) stars as Mansur, the prophetic warrior of the title. With his mouth set in a grim line he travels from battlefield to battlefield hardly flinching at the various attacks launched against him. As an almost unbeatable warrior, Mansur has the training and determination to rival any warrior in recent cinematic history. And Nomad: The Warrior has the film clips to prove it. Jay Hernandez (Hostel, Hostel II, and Friday Night Lights) comes in a close second as Mansur's equally well-trained, but less prophetic, ""brother"" Erali. Both of them, along with a small army, have been trained by the wise Master Oraz (masterfully played by Jason Scott Lee) to face the dangerous Jungers in a final showdown battle.Every scene in the film is carefully crafted and executed, laid out in classic mythical style, but constantly infused with reality-driven character development. Except for its palatable 111 minute running time, Nomad: The Warrior is an epic in every sense of the word: love, betrayal, brotherhood, loyalty, prophecy, and responsibility all make their required appearances, but it never feels typical or unoriginal. The subtitles manage to make the film feel more authentic somehow, and the big budget fight scenes serve as a reminder that the filmmakers were never left wanting. Audiences will find that after watching Nomad, they're not left wanting either. But seeing as the DVD itself doesn't contain any extras at all, not even the standard ""making of"" featurette, true fans of the film may find themselves asking for more.",4,An epic in every sense of the word,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2894,"['When', 'only', 'other', 'Kazakhi', 'film', 'people', 'minds', 'year', 'Jackass-style', 'pseduo-documentary', 'comedy', 'bumbling', 'Kazakhi', 'reporter', 'named', 'Borat', 'probably', 'hard', 'get', 'people', 'interested', 'Kazakhi', 'war', 'epic', 'Much', 'less', 'one', 'subtitles', 'Especially', 'when', 'cover', 'look', '300', 'knockoff', 'Gladiator', 'wannabe', 'Nomad', 'Warrior', 'own', 'sprawling', 'desert', 'landscaped', 'bloody', 'battlefield', 'epic', 'piece', 'cinema.Mostly', 'set', 'Kazakhstan', '1710', 'Nomad', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'born', 'fulfill', 'prophecy', 'uniting', 'three', 'warring', 'sects', 'country', 'rid', 'violent', 'enemies', 'once', 'Spanning', '30', 'years', 'film', 'never', 'intense', 'hardcore', 'battle', 'sequences', 'staged', 'Braveheart-esque', 'grandiosity', 'Heads', 'will', 'roll', 'warriors', 'will', 'run', 'screaming', 'flaming', 'off', 'camera', 'watchful', 'eyes', 'directors', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'Ivan', 'Passer', 'washed', 'out', 'desert', 'landscapes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Gladiator', 'story', 'never', 'true', 'epic', 'magnificence', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'movie', 'Nomad', 'manage', 'come', 'close', 'lacking', 'singular', 'vision', 'unique', 'story', 'truly', 'find', 'place', 'famous', 'period', 'epics.Each', 'character', 'here', 'been', 'powerfully', 'created', 'strong', 'multi-cultural', 'cast', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'Goal', 'Goal', 'II', 'Goal', '3', 'stars', 'Mansur', 'prophetic', 'warrior', 'title', 'mouth', 'set', 'grim', 'line', 'battlefield', 'battlefield', 'hardly', 'flinching', 'various', 'attacks', 'launched', 'almost', 'unbeatable', 'warrior', 'Mansur', 'training', 'determination', 'rival', 'warrior', 'recent', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Nomad', 'Warrior', 'film', 'clips', 'prove', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Hostel', 'Hostel', 'II', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'close', 'second', 'Mansur', 'equally', 'well-trained', 'less', 'prophetic', 'brother', 'Erali', 'small', 'army', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'wise', 'Master', 'Oraz', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'face', 'dangerous', 'Jungers', 'final', 'showdown', 'battle.Every', 'scene', 'film', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'executed', 'laid', 'out', 'classic', 'mythical', 'style', 'constantly', 'infused', 'reality-driven', 'character', 'development', 'palatable', '111', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'Nomad', 'Warrior', 'epic', 'sense', 'word', 'love', 'betrayal', 'brotherhood', 'loyalty', 'prophecy', 'responsibility', 'make', 'required', 'appearances', 'never', 'typical', 'unoriginal', 'subtitles', 'manage', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'authentic', 'somehow', 'big', 'budget', 'fight', 'scenes', 'serve', 'reminder', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'never', 'left', 'wanting', 'Audiences', 'will', 'find', 'watching', 'Nomad', ""'re"", 'not', 'left', 'wanting', 'seeing', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'contain', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'standard', 'making', 'featurette', 'true', 'fans', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'asking', 'more']",Nomad: The Warrior
