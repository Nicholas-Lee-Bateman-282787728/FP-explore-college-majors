1149353,A15OZEIN9FM28O,B0015DLZXM,"Capt. Lou Costello ""Capt. Lou""","[5, 5]","and the misery that comes to those who are caught up in it is brought to frightening reality on the big screen in this masterfully filmed effort by Feng Xiaogang. The story of a Chinese regiment fighting against the Nationalists in the brutal civil war manages to tug at almost every human emotion. The protagonist officer who leads his men in a savage last stand is perfectly portrayed. The scenes of warfare in this movie are very well done and manage to do so without demonizing the enemy as in so many war films. For those of you who know such things, and there are many, the range of weaponry used in this film spans the the entire history of modern warfare for the Chinese from the 1920's on through the war in Korea and adds greatly to the intense realism of the film. Watch for the scene in which the Captain sees what has become of the old helmets once used by the soldiers.The main character, Captain Gu Zidi, superbly played by Zhang Hanyu, cannot give up the memory of his lost men and never ceases in his struggle to have their memory honored. The portrayal of this struggle by this one man gives this film everything thing it needs for great drama. This work has a far stronger story than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and in modern cinema can only be rivaled by South Korea's ""Tae Guk Gi"". This is not only a great war film but is one of the very best films of any kind I have been privileged to see in recent years.",5,THE CATASTROPHY OF WAR,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,1423,"['misery', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'brought', 'frightening', 'reality', 'big', 'screen', 'masterfully', 'filmed', 'effort', 'Feng', 'Xiaogang', 'story', 'Chinese', 'regiment', 'fighting', 'Nationalists', 'brutal', 'civil', 'war', 'manages', 'tug', 'almost', 'human', 'emotion', 'protagonist', 'officer', 'who', 'men', 'savage', 'last', 'stand', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'scenes', 'warfare', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'manage', 'do', 'so', 'demonizing', 'enemy', 'so', 'many', 'war', 'films', 'who', 'know', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'many', 'range', 'weaponry', 'used', 'film', 'entire', 'history', 'modern', 'warfare', 'Chinese', '1920', 'war', 'Korea', 'greatly', 'intense', 'realism', 'film', 'Watch', 'scene', 'Captain', 'what', 'become', 'old', 'helmets', 'once', 'used', 'soldiers.The', 'main', 'character', 'Captain', 'Gu', 'Zidi', 'superbly', 'played', 'Zhang', 'Hanyu', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'memory', 'lost', 'men', 'never', 'ceases', 'struggle', 'have', 'memory', 'honored', 'portrayal', 'struggle', 'one', 'man', 'film', 'everything', 'thing', 'great', 'drama', 'work', 'far', 'stronger', 'story', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'modern', 'cinema', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'rivaled', 'South', 'Korea', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'kind', 'have', 'been', 'privileged', 'see', 'recent', 'years']",Assembly

Having said that, I find this movie, about the struggle of a Chinese soldier during and after his participation on several wars, fascinating.  A reminder that war goes on for soldiers even after the battle has ended.  As a person who has lived in the Western hemisphere under a democracy it's easy to believe the propaganda fed by our government about why we go to war just as easy as they do on the other side.  And even easier to demonize those whose culture and ideology are different from ours.  Assembly is a great antiwar probably without being its intention.The battle scenes are merciless and realistic.  ""Even gods would pee if they were to face combat"" is a more realistic assessment of the real feelings involved in war than what most Hollywood made movies have led us to believe.  The second act of the movies shortly show us the Korean war from the Chinese's viewpoint. And the third act of the movie deals with the aftermath for those who survive and have to deal with catastrophic loss even when the governments who made fought and the civilians quickly forget about those who were senselessly killed at war.",3,Interesting study about the reality and toll of war on the human spirit.,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1244,"['First', 'war', 'most', 'internecine', 'activity', 'humans', 'have', 'created', 'actively', 'participated', 'history', 'Having', 'said', 'find', 'movie', 'struggle', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'participation', 'several', 'wars', 'fascinating', 'reminder', 'war', 'soldiers', 'even', 'battle', 'ended', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'Western', 'hemisphere', 'democracy', 'easy', 'believe', 'propaganda', 'fed', 'government', 'why', 'go', 'war', 'just', 'as', 'easy', 'do', 'other', 'side', 'even', 'easier', 'demonize', 'culture', 'ideology', 'are', 'different', 'ours', 'Assembly', 'great', 'antiwar', 'probably', 'being', 'intention.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'merciless', 'realistic', 'Even', 'gods', 'would', 'pee', 'were', 'face', 'combat', 'more', 'realistic', 'assessment', 'real', 'feelings', 'involved', 'war', 'what', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'movies', 'have', 'led', 'believe', 'second', 'act', 'movies', 'shortly', 'show', 'Korean', 'war', 'Chinese', 'viewpoint', 'third', 'act', 'movie', 'deals', 'aftermath', 'who', 'survive', 'have', 'deal', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'even', 'when', 'governments', 'who', 'made', 'fought', 'civilians', 'quickly', 'forget', 'who', 'were', 'senselessly', 'killed', 'war']",Assembly
1149355,A3SFC0OTJ9ERMX,B0015DLZXM,"Gisli Jokull Gislason ""Jokull""","[4, 4]","There are quite a few War Movies made about soldiers reminiscent of war. Saving Private Ryan, Brotherhood, Flags of Our Fathers and Days of Glory to name a few. This movie ranks with the best of them.This movie is surprising in many ways. First of its production values are very high and on par with the best of Hollywood or European Cinema. In fact this is a much better movie than Enemy at the Gates or Flags of Our Fathers and is quite possibly what Flags wanted to be. It takes some getting used to watching a Chinese movie that feels European.The story is in two parts.The first half is a continuation of battle scenes that are among the best in war movies for some time. The prespective is at company level so you get quite big battles but it is possible to focus on individuals. Scenery and unit detail is incredible and everything is well done. There is a small dash of theatrics but for the most part these are very realistic gritty battle scenes with excellent cinema work. As I said the best to be seen for quite some time, I would say on par with Band of Brothers except the scenes are bigger and more impressive than in the television series. Attention to detail is of high quality and viewers will be treated to quite a novel experience such as oil barrel mortars. War movie enthusiast should be well pleased. Also the movie throws you right in there from the start with no sentimental scenes of old men in war cemeteries, lying in their dying bed etc.The second part is a story of redemption. As a survivor Gu Zidi tries to piece togeather what happened and redeem his brothers and himself. This part of the movie is a very Chinese story set in the post civil war Communist state of China and will be harder on the general audience. The important part is if the bodies of the dead are not found then the soldiers are MIA and their families honour is tarnished. Their deaths are worth 200 barrels of rice but would be 700 barrels if the died heroes of Liberation, but that is merely trying to put a price to honour, and the Chinese take honour very seriously. This one man struggle is hard since record keeping in the civil war is sketchy at best and the battlefield has turned into a mountain of coal from nearby mines. Close to the end a solitary veteran is trying to dig at the mountain of coal to redeem his brothers.The pace of the two stories is very different but the story is focused, linear and is free from going constantly back and forth. Historically it is interesting in that I don't recall any other movie set in the post World War 2 Chinese Civil War although this movie goes on to the Korean War. Nor is this movie any kind of white wash with clear boundries. It goes on in shades of gray.I thought the movie was good, in fact probably the best one of its kind. I liked how the story went in a straight line instead of going back and forth but it did break the story into 2 distinct halves. War movie buffs will find pleanty to like as will those with an interest in Chinese history if they can stomach the first half and even then there are interesting things such as lack of equipment of the communists and the portrayal of the Chinese soldiers and the conduct of the communist forces. In this day and age when it has become popular to demonize Mao, people tend to forget that there was a reason why the communists won. I recommend Assembly and look forward to seeing more of this new Chinese Cinema.",4,A matter of honour - the bugle call,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,3432,"['are', 'quite', 'few', 'War', 'Movies', 'made', 'soldiers', 'reminiscent', 'war', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Brotherhood', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Days', 'Glory', 'name', 'few', 'movie', 'best', 'them.This', 'movie', 'surprising', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'par', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'European', 'Cinema', 'fact', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'quite', 'possibly', 'what', 'Flags', 'wanted', 'be', 'getting', 'used', 'watching', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'European.The', 'story', 'two', 'parts.The', 'first', 'half', 'continuation', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'prespective', 'company', 'level', 'so', 'get', 'quite', 'big', 'battles', 'possible', 'focus', 'individuals', 'Scenery', 'unit', 'detail', 'incredible', 'everything', 'well', 'done', 'small', 'dash', 'theatrics', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'battle', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'cinema', 'work', 'said', 'best', 'be', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'would', 'say', 'par', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'scenes', 'are', 'bigger', 'more', 'impressive', 'television', 'series', 'Attention', 'detail', 'high', 'quality', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'quite', 'novel', 'experience', 'such', 'oil', 'barrel', 'mortars', 'War', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'pleased', 'Also', 'movie', 'right', 'there', 'start', 'sentimental', 'scenes', 'old', 'men', 'war', 'cemeteries', 'lying', 'dying', 'bed', 'etc.The', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'redemption', 'survivor', 'Gu', 'Zidi', 'piece', 'togeather', 'what', 'happened', 'redeem', 'brothers', 'part', 'movie', 'very', 'Chinese', 'story', 'set', 'post', 'civil', 'war', 'Communist', 'state', 'China', 'will', 'be', 'harder', 'general', 'audience', 'important', 'part', 'bodies', 'dead', 'are', 'not', 'found', 'then', 'soldiers', 'are', 'MIA', 'families', 'honour', 'tarnished', 'deaths', 'are', 'worth', '200', 'barrels', 'rice', 'would', 'be', '700', 'barrels', 'died', 'heroes', 'Liberation', 'merely', 'trying', 'put', 'price', 'honour', 'Chinese', 'take', 'honour', 'very', 'seriously', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'hard', 'record', 'keeping', 'civil', 'war', 'sketchy', 'best', 'battlefield', 'turned', 'mountain', 'coal', 'nearby', 'mines', 'Close', 'end', 'solitary', 'veteran', 'trying', 'dig', 'mountain', 'coal', 'redeem', 'brothers.The', 'pace', 'two', 'stories', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'focused', 'linear', 'free', 'going', 'constantly', 'back', 'forth', 'Historically', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'other', 'movie', 'set', 'post', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Chinese', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'Korean', 'War', 'movie', 'kind', 'white', 'wash', 'clear', 'boundries', 'shades', 'gray.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'fact', 'probably', 'best', 'one', 'kind', 'liked', 'how', 'story', 'went', 'straight', 'line', 'instead', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'did', 'break', 'story', '2', 'distinct', 'halves', 'War', 'movie', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'pleanty', 'like', 'as', 'will', 'interest', 'Chinese', 'history', 'can', 'stomach', 'first', 'half', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'interesting', 'things', 'such', 'lack', 'equipment', 'communists', 'portrayal', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'conduct', 'communist', 'forces', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'become', 'popular', 'demonize', 'Mao', 'people', 'tend', 'forget', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'communists', 'won', 'recommend', 'Assembly', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'new', 'Chinese', 'Cinema']",Assembly
1149356,A16XRPF40679KG,B0015DLZXM,Michael Dobey,"[6, 9]","This movie is more than a war movie, it's also about the struggle that all soldiers feel about forgotten friends.  Civilians often don't want to hear about it and don't want to remember the sacrifices of the fallen. This story is a true one about a company that is destroyed in the chinese civil war (1920's-40's) with a break in their to fight the japanese , it carries on into the korean war too as we follow the survivors struggles to gain acknowledgement for his fallen comrades. This is a universal story and it stands solid for the soldiers of all wars. This movie shows us how soldiers are bound together in suffering no matter what ideology they fought for. And the chinese communist one is one histories bloodiest , but the soldiers in the chinese army were not murderers or ideologues they were just men. This movie is one of the greatest war movies ever made in my opinion because it shows how a man cannot let go of his fallen friends. And remember this man also fights The u.s. in korea (the worst regime in the world at that time and probably today as well)  and it still doesn't matter because he's just a soldier who is fighting for his friends first of all.  The battle scenes are true to life and this is the way all battles should be shown , in all their horror and fear. But what is touching is the story after the two wars are over for our character and the fact that fellow soldiers still try to look out for him. Every soldier should see this movie and perhaps they can understand why they hurt so deep inside sometimes. The world forgets but the soldier cannot and the people he fights are often men like him in military values. Except when fighting  insurgents , some of whom  use civilians as shields. or even worse terrorists. But men and women of the trained army from whatever nation canrelate to the struggle that captain c goes through to bring justice to his men's memory.  The blu ray looks stunning and it's battle scenes are among the truest and best out there , alongside pvt ryan and other realistic movies.

1149357,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B0015DLZXM,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","A movie in two halves, this Chinese film does a nifty job of both emulating the style that made Ryan such a hit, and providing enough of a soul to go along with it to be interesting on its own merit.Based on a novel, which itself was based on a true story, the movie is set in the late 40's during the Chinese Civil War and goes on into the following decade.  The first half sees the Captain ordered with his company into a desolate war zone in 1948, to hold and fight to the last man until he hears the bugle cry of assembly.  It never comes... scenes of carnage in grayed out colors in very shaky camerawork (as patented my Spielberg) ensue... all fairly effectively done.  However, it is in the second half, that the film finds its heart.. The Captain, now scarred both physically and emotionally, realizes his company are listed as missing, affording them no honor, and so he makes it his goal to find proof of their story and restore their name.It is surprising to see a movie like this, after a decade or more of brightly colored highly choreographed wushu epics made China more of an international movie force.. this is quite the opposite, with its realism, grim tone and very human heart.  In taking so many cues from Western films like Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, there is perhaps an element of disappointment in what at first seems a lack of originality.  In fact, during some of the battle scenes the shaky camera work just seems a fraction too much, as if they have not quite developed the skill set yet.  The script and the music both feel almost self consciously Western in origin. In addition, while the journey in the latter half to redemption is effective, the time and location shifts are clunky in places and serve to distract rather than build development of the story.Having said that, this is a uniquely Chinese story, during a period of history that is close to Chinese hearts, and why not tell it?  The latter half, the all important journey to redemption, is handled deftly, and the end result should move even the toughest hearts just a little, with themes of honour, loyalty and brotherhood unhindered by jingoism or propaganda.A recommended watch then, and yet more signs that China is showing no end to its high quality movie output.Extras include around an hour of in depth analysis of all aspects of the moviemaking, from story through cast to details such as effects and costumes.",4,Private Ryan goes to China?,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,2426,"['movie', 'two', 'halves', 'Chinese', 'film', 'nifty', 'job', 'emulating', 'style', 'made', 'Ryan', 'hit', 'providing', 'enough', 'soul', 'go', 'along', 'be', 'interesting', 'own', 'merit.Based', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'set', 'late', '40', 'Chinese', 'Civil', 'War', 'following', 'decade', 'first', 'half', 'Captain', 'ordered', 'company', 'desolate', 'war', 'zone', '1948', 'hold', 'fight', 'last', 'man', 'bugle', 'cry', 'assembly', 'never', 'scenes', 'carnage', 'grayed', 'out', 'colors', 'very', 'shaky', 'camerawork', 'patented', 'Spielberg', 'ensue', 'fairly', 'effectively', 'done', 'However', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'heart..', 'Captain', 'now', 'scarred', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'company', 'are', 'listed', 'missing', 'affording', 'honor', 'so', 'goal', 'find', 'proof', 'story', 'restore', 'name.It', 'surprising', 'see', 'movie', 'decade', 'more', 'brightly', 'colored', 'highly', 'choreographed', 'wushu', 'epics', 'made', 'China', 'more', 'international', 'movie', 'force..', 'quite', 'opposite', 'realism', 'grim', 'tone', 'very', 'human', 'heart', 'taking', 'so', 'many', 'cues', 'Western', 'films', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'perhaps', 'element', 'disappointment', 'what', 'first', 'lack', 'originality', 'fact', 'battle', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'just', 'fraction', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'not', 'quite', 'developed', 'skill', 'set', 'yet', 'script', 'music', 'feel', 'almost', 'consciously', 'Western', 'origin', 'addition', 'journey', 'latter', 'half', 'redemption', 'effective', 'time', 'location', 'shifts', 'are', 'clunky', 'places', 'serve', 'distract', 'rather', 'build', 'development', 'story.Having', 'said', 'uniquely', 'Chinese', 'story', 'period', 'history', 'close', 'Chinese', 'hearts', 'why', 'not', 'tell', 'latter', 'half', 'important', 'journey', 'redemption', 'handled', 'deftly', 'end', 'result', 'should', 'move', 'even', 'toughest', 'hearts', 'just', 'little', 'themes', 'honour', 'loyalty', 'brotherhood', 'unhindered', 'jingoism', 'propaganda.A', 'recommended', 'watch', 'then', 'yet', 'more', 'signs', 'China', 'showing', 'end', 'high', 'quality', 'movie', 'output.Extras', 'include', 'hour', 'depth', 'analysis', 'aspects', 'moviemaking', 'story', 'cast', 'details', 'such', 'effects', 'costumes']",Assembly

But this bugle call was never heard...Captain Guzidi's greatest curse seems to have been to survive. He witnesses his whole battalion killed and then risks almost certain death to save the life off his commander. And yet, despite incredible odds he survives. It is only after the war is over that he realises his purpose. He must honour his fallen comrades by letting the world know of their sacrifice, and he will fight to have them declared war heroes even if it takes a lifetime to do it.Assembly is at times very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. Assembly's battle scenes are gritty and chaotic and, like Saving Private Ryan, they are utterly compelling. However, unlike Spielberg's war movie, at no time does Assembly descend into clich&eacute;d sentimentality. Even after the battles have finished this film still keeps up the pace by telling the intriguing story of Guzidi's moral victory. This film is a treat for those who appreciate war films with wonderfully layered characterization and thrilling back stories.I have to admit, I couldn't find much accurate historical information on the people portrayed in this film, or on the book that the movie is based on - Guan Si. However, even if only a few of the events shown on screen are fact, this is a story about heroes and the sacrifices they make for what they believe in.In short, this movie shows its audience a realistic and compelling depiction of the 139th Battalion's heroic sacrifice and the story of one man's determination to get this sacrifice acknowledged.

The film was inspired by true events.The film takes place during the Chinese civil war of 1948 between the Communist People's Liberation Army and the Nationalist Kuomin Tang forces (KMT). Captain Gu Zidi (Zhang Hanyu) leads the 9th Company (139th Regiment) and the group is determined to win at any cost. Gu did time in prison for killing his captive P.O.W.'s after they've already surrendered. Reassigned to the frontlines to defend a mineral mine from the approaching KMT Army, the 9th company is outgunned and outnumbered by the approaching army--this KMT Army is equipped with tanks, and heavy artillery. Gu's 9th company suffer heavy losses that leads to the men arguing as whether they should fight or retreat, they are supposed to retreat once they hear a Bugle call but Gu's hearing has been impaired during one of the assaults. Some soldiers say that they heard it while some didn't--Gu is unable to verify whether or not the Bugle call has been made, so he commits his men to fight on--to the very last man standing.The first half of the film focuses on the 9th company's experiences in the frontline. The film's battle sequences are among the best I've seen and undoubtedly the best ever produced in Chinese cinema. The sequences are gripping, intense and riveting as you see the men of the 9th company fight on to the last man. Shot in a grayish hue, (almost black and white) and shaky camera work, the film has that very realistic feel. Director Feng manages to shoot the scenes with a lot of power and intensity--although I have to say that some of the shots isn't exactly very harmonious or doesn't really mesh well as with ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is a lot of blood and gore, a lot of spewing mud and powerful explosions. Don't get me wrong, the scenes are VERY exciting and riveting but for some reason, it felt that it lacked an emotional connection; the disagreements between Gu and his C.O. Wang (Yuan Wenkang) does have its merits but I thought they were just your usual conflicts. The battle sequences are indeed a near stellar achievement in Chinese cinema, but without a proper inner conflict, the scenes lose some of its effect. The usual overwhelming army against a small band of soldiers have been done numerous times before but hey, the battle isn't any less exciting.The second half of the film focuses on Gu's struggle as a half-deaf war veteran. Director Feng does successfully flesh out its main character as Gu first enlists in the Korean war before he attempts a post-war existence. For some reason, any records of the 9th company or Gu himself has been lost by record keepers. Gu becomes very frustrated that the sacrifices of his men are unrecognized by the country they fought for--to ensure the continued power of the State. I think Feng was trying to move to a political commentary as we all know the score: Bureaucrats tend to use soldiers as expendable resources and make body counts irrelevant for the common good. Sadly, this is the work of a soldier.The film's human drama itself becomes very predictable and offers nothing new. Please keep in mind that Feng is a very mainstream Chinese director and of course, he would never make a critical war film. The movie is very China-friendly and full of flag-waving elements. The inner issues Gu experiences is very defined but the film itself offers no surprises in this regard. Serving in the People's army is portrayed as a righteous cause and the existing authority figures will no doubt take care of its soldiers. Thankfully, Zhang Hanyu's performance is convincing enough although some scenes had the dangerous potential to become overly melodramatic.""THE ASSEMBLY"" is not a perfect film. The film's main premise is very involving but it just doesn't really ""click"" as a ""pure"" epic war film. I have a few ideas as to how this film could have been better--Feng's decision to avoid the political issues somewhat kills the film's emotional potential. Instead, the director opts to make the portrayal of war in human ""effect"" and sidesteps any indictment or finger-pointing at any political body for the causes of war itself. Feng's war epic is very ""friendly"" and it never approaches the level of excellence in emotions as achieved by other war films. The film is very ""human"" in its approach and very sympathetic--although not entirely patriotic. The film offers nothing surprising or offers a complex dramatic resolution. The film never chooses a side (Feng Xiaogang would be banned from filmmaking if he did so) and the film is definitely geared towards an international audience. ""The Assembly""'s emotional content is very basic but despite its massive commercial appeal, the film still commands high esteem.Highly Recommended![4+ Stars]",4,Feng Xiaogang's Chinese War Epic is a
