BUT it seems like the action we want will be coming in with the next season! (or so we hope).",4,Keep 'em coming,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,242,"['was', 'good', 'season', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'action', 'last', 'ones', 'had', 'lot', 'felt', 'went', 'back', 'few', 'steps', 'seasons', '1-4', 'BUT', 'action', 'want', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'next', 'season', 'so', 'hope']",Red Vs.

I love this series!When I watched season 9 I was amazed at the graphics they were using.  They were finally using their own CGI!Season 10 was EPIC!  I  watched season 10 all 3 days of my 3 day rental.  It was THAT good!  I could not wait for season 11 to come out, so instead of watch the mini episodes on their website, I waited for the year to finish and rented the whole episode.I can't believe I paid for this!!!!  Not only is it 40 minutes shorter than season 10, but they used ZERO CGI!!!!  Why are they going backwards!!!!  And they left the season short!!!!  This is BS!!!  What a waste of a year!!!!
