NO MORE!!This shameless habit of Universal generally charging a great deal for its DVD sets and providing an inferior product knowing that enough demand exists for the content to get away with it.

906600,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B0009JE6FC,Amateur Stargazer,"[0, 0]","Like the other Sliders set of seasons one and two, the case of this set of season three does not provide adequate protection for the discs.  Three of the four DVD's are double sided and all of them were stacked over each other (with the grooves touching) in the case.  The discs in my set arrived in good condition in spite of the bad packaging, but I transferred them to my own cases soon after receiving them.This was quite a good season for Sliders with some fine episodes, although some fans feel that the addition of the Kromaggs was mistake and caused the show to decline in quality.  They didn't have much character since they weren't very clever as villains and were not very challenging opponents for the  Sliders. This was a full season with 25 episodes, which makes one wish that seasons one and two, with their excellent quality, had as many shows. Arturo's death (and the departure of John Rhys-Davies) before the end of the season was a great loss for the series.  Still, this is set well worth owning and you won't be disappointed in its content.The episodes are not all in the order in which they were filmed. Part one of ""The Exodus"", in which Arturo dies at the end, is included on Side B of disc one and part two of that episode is first on side A of disc three.  The two parts should not have been separated.  The next episode after ""Exodus, Part Two"" is one with Kari Wuhrer, and then there is another that follows,""The Last of Eden"", which has Arturo still living.  The episodes of each disc are not listed anywhere on the case so you have  to access the menu of each DVD to see the contents, which isn't very convenient.  Why didn't the people who put together this set have any regard for the continuity of the series?My rating is an average-- four stars for this season of Sliders and two for the DVD set since it contains some nice bonus material (e.g. footage from ""Exodus"", gag reels, bloopers, etc.).  The case, however, is very bad and should get one star at maximum, perhaps not even that much.  So a 2.5 rating would probably be the most fair, but since that can't be designated here I'll round it up to three stars, which may be a little too generous.",3,Buy your own cases!,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,2184,"['other', 'Sliders', 'set', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'case', 'set', 'season', 'three', 'not', 'provide', 'adequate', 'protection', 'discs', 'Three', 'four', 'DVD', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'were', 'stacked', 'other', 'grooves', 'touching', 'case', 'discs', 'set', 'arrived', 'good', 'condition', 'spite', 'bad', 'packaging', 'transferred', 'own', 'cases', 'soon', 'receiving', 'them.This', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'season', 'Sliders', 'fine', 'episodes', 'fans', 'feel', 'addition', 'Kromaggs', 'was', 'mistake', 'caused', 'show', 'decline', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'character', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'clever', 'villains', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'opponents', 'Sliders', 'was', 'full', 'season', '25', 'episodes', 'one', 'wish', 'one', 'two', 'excellent', 'quality', 'had', 'many', 'shows', 'Arturo', 'death', 'departure', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'loss', 'series', 'Still', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'content.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'order', 'were', 'filmed', 'Part', 'one', 'Exodus', 'Arturo', 'end', 'included', 'Side', 'B', 'disc', 'one', 'part', 'two', 'episode', 'first', 'side', 'A', 'disc', 'three', 'two', 'parts', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'next', 'episode', 'Exodus', 'Part', 'Two', 'one', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'then', 'Last', 'Eden', 'Arturo', 'still', 'living', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'anywhere', 'case', 'so', 'have', 'access', 'menu', 'DVD', 'see', 'contents', ""n't"", 'very', 'convenient', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'set', 'have', 'regard', 'continuity', 'series', 'rating', 'average', 'four', 'stars', 'season', 'Sliders', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'nice', 'bonus', 'material', 'e.g', 'footage', 'Exodus', 'gag', 'reels', 'bloopers', 'etc.', 'case', 'however', 'very', 'bad', 'should', 'get', 'one', 'star', 'maximum', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'much', '2.5', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'fair', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'designated', 'here', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'three', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'generous']",N/A
906601,A2SW560X584UEF,B0009JE6FC,Barbara B.,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed the first season, and some of the second, but it really ""jumps the shark"" in season three. For me, the biggest problem was that it started taking itself too seriously, trying to get dark and edgy, with few comedic breaks to lighten the mood. Most episodes have them entering a dystopian world that I sure didn't want to spend even an hour in. The show should have taken the lead from Quantum Leap, which managed to balance a few more serious plotlines with more lighthearted fare. Perhaps if the show had started out being deadly serious, the transition would have worked better for me. Instead, it morphed into something it wasn't and slid into a season that left me behind.",2,Jumps the shark in this season,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,685,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'really', 'shark', 'season', 'three', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'started', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'trying', 'get', 'dark', 'edgy', 'few', 'comedic', 'breaks', 'lighten', 'mood', 'Most', 'episodes', 'have', 'entering', 'dystopian', 'world', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'even', 'hour', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'lead', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'managed', 'balance', 'few', 'more', 'serious', 'plotlines', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'fare', 'Perhaps', 'show', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'being', 'deadly', 'serious', 'transition', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'Instead', 'morphed', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'slid', 'season', 'left']",N/A

What started as a fun series with season 1 and 2 starring a group of 4 likable people ends with the death of the Professor who was the indispensable father figure, only to be replaced by an actress with dubious acting skills spending most of her time half naked in several episodes.Wuhrer was obviously hired to attract male viewers. Unfortunately it ruined the show's main attraction which to me was in the original 4 characters' relationship. After Arturo dies, no more Wizard of Oz team, instead, an a la Seven of Nine debacle.The first 2 DVDs feature the original team and several episodes are actually pretty good, which is why I gave it 3 stars. After Exodus however, exit Arturo, Wuhrer becomes part of the team, and welcome to the fastest downward spiral with the most ridiculous episodes, including rip offs of ""I am Legend"", X-files, The Island of Dr. Moreau, B Horror movies etc...Previous reviewers mentioned a new producer.

906604,A2W1JTYZXWMR56,B0009JE6FC,"crouteru ""crouteru""","[16, 17]","There was a great deal going on behind the scenes during this season.Conflict between creator Tracy Torme and new executive producer David Peckinpah resulted in Torme's vision being restricted and him leaving the series.Star John Rhys-Davies also had many problems with Peckinpah, and always spoke out if he thought a script was rubbish (which most were). Peckinpah didn't like him and this led to him being sacked and his character killed off in two-part episode ""The Exodus"", although the official statement was that he left because of creative differences.Further strain occured when his replacement, Kari Wuhrer, didn't get on with other cast member Sabrina Lloyd, which was a one of the biggest factors in her exit from the series after season 3. She said to Peckinpah it was either her or Wuhrer, and he picked Wuhrer.Again, the Fox Network, in all it's glory, didn't air the episodes in their correct order, although it wasn't as bad a shuffle as on the first two seasons.One episode, ""The Last of Eden"" was supposed to air before ""The Exodus"" since it had the Professor in it, but since it aired after, when he was killed off, they had to quickly add in a bit at the beginning to make it a flashback episode.Season 3 Episodes (in their correct order!)1.

The Other Slide of Darkness21. The Breeder22. Stoker23. Slither24. Dinoslide25. This Slide of ParadiseThe 25 episodes of this season are quite mixed, as other reviewers have mentioned. Most of the 'post-exodus' episodes are fairly below average, but there are some 'pre-exodus' episodes that are true to classic Sliders form.Personal favorites include ""Double Cross"", ""Dead Man Sliding"", ""The Guardian"", ""The Prince of Slides"" and ""Season's Greedings"".There are several movie rip-offs aswell in this season. ""Electric Twister Acid Test"" was made to cash-in on the movie ""Twister"", which had recently been released at the time. ""Desert Storm"" seems to have taken several ideas from the ""Mad Max"" movies. ""Dragonslide"" seems almost a carbon copy of ""Dragonslayer"". ""The Prince of Slides"" reminds me of a sweet little movie called ""Junior"". ""Paradise Lost"" has a creature in it very similar to the one in ""Tremors"". ""Sole Survivors"" is just like any typical zombie movie. ""The Breeder"" is so much like ""Species"", that a lawsuit could have been issued against the series. Finally, ""This Slide of Paradise"" is again so much like ""The Island of Dr Morteau"", that even some of the characters have the same name.The quality of the storylines was so bad in the back half of the season that you'll laugh. We have zombies, vampires and killer snakes. Personally, I don't tune in to Sliders for that, I'd expect stories like that from something like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It looks like the alternate histories premise from season's one and two are well and truly gone.The extras are a little thin again. We only have the gag reel for this season, plus, quite strangely, an episode of Cleopatra 2525 (or whatever year it is) and two episodes of Earth 2. These are probably to promote the recent release of the two shows.Still, there is some fun to be had with this season, and I'd recommend it to sci-fi fans, but not necessarily Sliders fans, as it's an insult to the first two seasons.",4,The last of Torme's Sliders,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,3618,"['was', 'great', 'deal', 'going', 'scenes', 'season.Conflict', 'creator', 'Tracy', 'Torme', 'new', 'executive', 'producer', 'David', 'Peckinpah', 'resulted', 'Torme', 'vision', 'being', 'restricted', 'leaving', 'series.Star', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'also', 'had', 'many', 'problems', 'Peckinpah', 'always', 'spoke', 'out', 'thought', 'script', 'was', 'rubbish', 'most', 'were', 'Peckinpah', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'led', 'being', 'sacked', 'character', 'killed', 'off', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Exodus', 'official', 'statement', 'was', 'left', 'creative', 'differences.Further', 'strain', 'occured', 'when', 'replacement', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'cast', 'member', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'factors', 'exit', 'series', 'season', '3', 'said', 'Peckinpah', 'was', 'Wuhrer', 'picked', 'Wuhrer.Again', 'Fox', 'Network', 'glory', 'did', ""n't"", 'air', 'episodes', 'correct', 'order', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'shuffle', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.One', 'episode', 'Last', 'Eden', 'was', 'supposed', 'air', 'Exodus', 'had', 'Professor', 'aired', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'had', 'quickly', 'add', 'bit', 'beginning', 'make', 'flashback', 'episode.Season', '3', 'Episodes', 'correct', 'order', '1', 'Double', 'Cross2', 'Rules', 'Game3', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Sliding4', 'Electric', 'Twister', 'Acid', 'Test5', 'Guardian6', 'Dream', 'Masters7', 'Desert', 'Storm8', 'Dragonslide9', 'Fire', 'Within10', 'Prince', 'Slides11', 'State', 'A.R.T.12', 'Season', 'Greedings13', 'Murder', 'Most', 'Foul14', 'Slide', 'Egyptian15', 'Paradise', 'Lost16', 'Last', 'Eden17', 'Exodus', 'Part', '1', '18', 'Exodus', 'Part', '2', '19', 'Sole', 'Survivors20', 'Other', 'Slide', 'Darkness21', 'Breeder22', 'Stoker23', 'Slither24', 'Dinoslide25', 'Slide', 'ParadiseThe', '25', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'quite', 'mixed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Most', ""'post-exodus"", 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'below', 'average', 'are', ""'pre-exodus"", 'episodes', 'are', 'true', 'classic', 'Sliders', 'form.Personal', 'favorites', 'include', 'Double', 'Cross', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Sliding', 'Guardian', 'Prince', 'Slides', 'Season', 'Greedings', 'are', 'several', 'movie', 'rip-offs', 'aswell', 'season', 'Electric', 'Twister', 'Acid', 'Test', 'was', 'made', 'cash-in', 'movie', 'Twister', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'time', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'have', 'taken', 'several', 'ideas', 'Mad', 'Max', 'movies', 'Dragonslide', 'almost', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Dragonslayer', 'Prince', 'Slides', 'sweet', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Junior', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'creature', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'Tremors', 'Sole', 'Survivors', 'just', 'typical', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Breeder', 'so', 'much', 'Species', 'lawsuit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'issued', 'series', 'Finally', 'Slide', 'Paradise', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'Island', 'Dr', 'Morteau', 'even', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'name.The', 'quality', 'storylines', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'back', 'half', 'season', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'have', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'killer', 'snakes', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'tune', 'Sliders', ""'d"", 'expect', 'stories', 'something', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'alternate', 'histories', 'premise', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'well', 'truly', 'gone.The', 'extras', 'are', 'little', 'thin', 'again', 'only', 'have', 'gag', 'reel', 'season', 'quite', 'strangely', 'episode', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'year', 'two', 'episodes', 'Earth', '2', 'are', 'probably', 'promote', 'recent', 'release', 'two', 'shows.Still', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'season', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Sliders', 'fans', 'insult', 'first', 'two', 'seasons']",N/A

The season began well enough, but unfortunately, some of the ideas were really not well conceived.Personally, there were many missed opportunities that seemed in the first season and part of the second, to hold so much hope they'd cover. With so much ""alternate history/earth"" ideas having been around for a long time, one wonders why they tried to create their own. It isn't that they were bad, just not very well developed. Without going in to this episode or that, it's just a comment about direction more than content.I still like the series and hope they put out the last two seasons eventually. I bought this so clearly it was enjoyable to me, and is still. But I'm a Science Fiction fan and am willing to let some things go for the sake of the conceptual whole; they call that 'suspension of disbelief', a willingness to let the story tell itself without pointing out the sometimes glaring errors and/or problems with the concept or idea they are asking you to embrace.I guess it's just disappointing when they start changing a series because ratings (adding ""sex appeal"") are more important than content and substance, which became even more problematic in the final two seasons. They did seem to struggle to maintain some kind of conceptual relevance and good story telling, and it is evident in some of the episodes. Pushing the story arc along helped.Not the best of reviews, but honest.

It was mired in stupidity and cornball robots, vampires and plots that had nothing to do with the original premise.The chemistry of the show was the Core Four and without them it couldn't survive, even if the stories were better.

Kindel,"[1, 1]","It's incredible how many great shows had their origin on Fox TV; and how many the SciFi channel proceeded to run into the ground once it acquired them.  To me, there simply is no greater show - sci-fi or otherwise.  Period.  Whatever it was that came together so beautifully to create this masterpiece has pretty much vanished from TV.  For one thing, there was a small window of opportunity for a sci-fi show not based on a military paradigm and not seeped in violence.  Not that there's no violence to be found in Sliders - nor even that there's anything wrong with violence in a TV show.  Rather, that the show's main characters do not go from world to world carrying an array of weapons in expectation of violence.  Being peaceful - i.e., non-military - they expect to find relatively peaceful conditions.  Of course, all that changes forever with the introduction of the Cro-Mags.  Though I agree with most reviewers that seasons 1 and 2 were essentially Sliders at their best; I've chosen to review season 3 because my all-time favorite Sliders episode - The Guardian - is part of season 3.  This episode, besides representing a glitch in the normal parallel world sliding because of its introduction of the temporal factor, shows Quinn Mallory at his most sensitive and humane.  It's simply magnificent.  Quinn Mallory is the quintessential hero of all sci-fi in that he uses intelligence and guile to find his way out of every predicament; he uses no weapons - not on ""stun,"" not on ""kill,"" not on any setting whatever.  The same, of course, is true of the other three characters, even if they do from time to time show more ""human flaws"" than Quinn.  And just as the characters are great, so is the cast.  It's nothing unusual or unique for the cast of any show to seem perfect for the characters; but this particular cast is more than perfect: not only are they the characters, they're the show itself.  Season 4 and 5, where the cast changes, are still good, with good stories and good characterizations.  There's a particularly good story in season 5, where the character of Diana has been separated from the others in a war zone and is relating the events.  But even that falls short of almost any of the stories from seasons 1, 2 and 3.  The magic that made Sliders great gradually disappeared as first Arturo then Wade then Quinn himself departed.

Ross ""Kristy""","[2, 3]","SLIDERS was unpretentious SF entertainment that combined both cerebral and cockamamie aspects while retaining the quality of the episodes throughout the first 3 seasons. Jerry O'Connell has never bettered his role as Quinn Mallory, the parallel dimension jumping amateur scientist exploring dissimilar earths. As a long time fan of the show, it's great too see such a debonair presentation of season 3 on digital. Understandably cut short after it's 5th season, Sliders found its legs and maintained a high-quality standard until physics professor Arturo (John Rhys-Davies) was killed off. A specific point perhaps, but for me, that was when the show `jumped the shark' and tried to imitate certain aspects of Star Trek and Stargate SG: 1. Regardless, this is the best season, showcasing all the various worlds, and Robert K. Weiss' narrative reached its peak. True, several episodes like `Exodus, part one' and `The Other Slide Of Darkness' slide too close to the overly-dramatic confusion corner, but for the most part, the writers kept it real, not relying fully on ostentatious SFX for plaudits. The special effects, were for the most part impressive, but there are some inconsistant sections. Unfortunately with some TV on digital, you get inconsistencies with the eminence, so to be a completist means buying a collection that ranges from exceptional to excremental. Take my advice, only pay money for the first 3 seasons and leave it at that. On the technical side, Dennis McCarthy's imaginative musical score highlights the most action-packed episodes while Ron Spang's `Ferrari flash' editing was spectacular.

But it remains entertaining. The loss of the professor is a huge blow to the series though. Although the next two seasons are not terrible. They were never the same as this cast's efforts. That being said I do enjoy those later eps. It took me time but they  are ok! This one isn't as great as the first two but it was still a good show.  And it remains highly entertaining to this day. The case is crap though.  But that's no reason to downgrade the whole show.  Kari whurer gets better as each episode goes on too. So she's really got chops by the fifth season.  It is worth watching all the seasons. As the show was a fun romp of sci fi and although this season isn't near as perfect as the first two it's worth watching. There is one truly bad episode  though, 'dragon slide'. It is perhaps the worst of the entire sliders run.

906625,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0009JE6FC,Mitch Weaver,"[5, 5]","At one time, Sliders was one of my favorite shows. The premise of traveling to parallel worlds made for an extremely interesting concept and the original cast of Jerry O Connel, John Rhys Davies, Sabrina Lloyd, and Cleavant Derricks all worked so well together. The first two seasons of the show were simply outstanding and rank up there with Quantum Leap with being some of the best science fiction I have ever seen on television.Unfortunately, the momentum that the show had going for it, did not carry over into its third season. There are a few really enjoyable episodes in season three that will remind you of how great the show used to be like ""The Guardian"" in which the Sliders arrive on a world that is 12 years slower than normal, and Quinn takes it upon himself to become a guardian to his young double to change an upcoming event in his life. But overall, the enjoyable episodes were few and far between in this lackluster season.There were a few reasons for the show's decline in my opinion. The biggest reason first and foremost was the decision to breakup the original group of cast members. Professor Arturo was the best character on the show in my opinion, and once the character was taken off the show, it signaled a turn for the worst. The dynamic that the original characters shared was now gone. There were also changes to the layout of the show, in which the settings expanded outside of San Francisco and opened up to the entire state of California. Not to mention the fact that some episodes would open with the Sliders already in the new world, without showing them slide in, a lot more people knowing about the technology of sliding in other worlds, etc.. It just felt like a different show. There was also a big change in Quinn's character as well. In the first two seasons, Quinn would use his mind to get out of tough situations. But in season three, his character was changed into more of a tough guy character that would rely more on his fists than his wits.I was also really dissapointed with the extras that were offered for this set as well. There were no behind the scenes interviews or commentaries whatsoever. If you are a hardcore fan of the show, this set is worth owning just to complete the collection of owning the entire show on DVD. But with the acception of a few great episodes, this season does not even come close to the greatness that the first two seasons brought fans of the show.3/5",3,Season three = A Mixed Bag,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2434,"['one', 'time', 'Sliders', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'premise', 'traveling', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'made', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'concept', 'original', 'cast', 'Jerry', 'O', 'Connel', 'John', 'Rhys', 'Davies', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Cleavant', 'Derricks', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'being', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television.Unfortunately', 'momentum', 'show', 'had', 'going', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'over', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'used', 'be', 'Guardian', 'Sliders', 'arrive', 'world', '12', 'years', 'slower', 'normal', 'Quinn', 'become', 'guardian', 'young', 'double', 'change', 'upcoming', 'event', 'life', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'lackluster', 'were', 'few', 'reasons', 'show', 'decline', 'opinion', 'biggest', 'reason', 'first', 'foremost', 'was', 'decision', 'breakup', 'original', 'group', 'cast', 'members', 'Professor', 'Arturo', 'was', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'opinion', 'once', 'character', 'was', 'taken', 'off', 'show', 'signaled', 'turn', 'worst', 'dynamic', 'original', 'characters', 'shared', 'was', 'now', 'gone', 'were', 'also', 'changes', 'layout', 'show', 'settings', 'expanded', 'San', 'Francisco', 'opened', 'up', 'entire', 'state', 'California', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'episodes', 'would', 'open', 'Sliders', 'already', 'new', 'world', 'showing', 'slide', 'lot', 'more', 'people', 'knowing', 'technology', 'sliding', 'other', 'worlds', 'etc..', 'just', 'felt', 'different', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'big', 'change', 'Quinn', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Quinn', 'would', 'use', 'mind', 'get', 'tough', 'situations', 'season', 'three', 'character', 'was', 'changed', 'more', 'tough', 'guy', 'character', 'would', 'rely', 'more', 'fists', 'wits.I', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'dissapointed', 'extras', 'were', 'offered', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'whatsoever', 'are', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'show', 'set', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'complete', 'collection', 'owning', 'entire', 'show', 'DVD', 'acception', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'greatness', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'brought', 'fans', 'show.3/5']",N/A

That ruined the show entirely. This season still had a few winners in it, but it was still sorely lacking. Also with Ryes-Davies leaving the show it left a big hole in the cast. Jerry's brother Charlie was okay, but that added a new (probably network thought up) twist that ""Cueball"" wasn't even from ""our"" earth, but another alternate earth and didn't really invent sliding at all.

Apparently, something horrible must have happened in the production of the show during this time, however, because while the early episodes in this season are some of the strongest of the series, by the end it is a whimper.This collection should be required viewing for anyone in television. This is the season where a fantastic show hops on a motorcycle and flys over a shark in a big way. A great show to start. Then, producers fire (or let go or whatever) the anchoring character (Arturo) because he has the audacity to question the show. Immediately, his absence is felt. In a desperate attempt to save it, they rely on the old cliche that anything can be rectified with the American people if you make it sexy enough. Enter an untalented actress whose sole asset (in her own words) is her body. What the producers failed to realize is that the premise of the show wouldn't allow for a sexual relationship between two main characters. The growing affection between Wade and Quinn was beautiful. Plus, in the first seasons, Quinn had this whole Captain Kirk girl in every port thing going on that was hilarious, as his character was nowhere near as suave as Kirk (sort of a dorky Captain Kirk thing -- it was great). There was no chemistry between Maggie and Quinn because the whole premise of the show was that sliders must become a family of warriors together. There was no place for jealousy and sexual intrigue.The sad thing is that people who watched the original series know that it only got much much worse as the producers stopped caring about the writing and relied on cheap and tawdry storylines.

906645,A2172P0XZDC8L3,B0009JE6FC,"Thomas A. Zulli ""Tazz""","[1, 1]","I used to love watching sliders years ago but for some reason stopped watching it after the 2nd season. Possibly because I didnt have cable at the time it moved to sci fi. Once in a while I would catch reruns when I could years later but I never knew what actually happened since I stopped. Then the show stopped showing reruns and I was missing Sliders again. Until I saw that season 1 & 2 was for $20 (which I got) and then found out 3  was the same. I couldnt resist.If you have never heard of the show. Its about a college student named Quinn Mallory (Jerry O'Connel) his friend who is a girl named Wade Wells (Sabrina Loyd), former 60s-70s singer Rambrant brown (forgor his name) and Prof. Autaro (forgot his name but played Glimii in Lord of the Rings) discover there are altnerate universes where its the same place, time (with one exception) with the same people (sometimes not) but a different road was taken. (Russia won the cold war, england won the American Revolution, etc). They travel to these worlds but cant find their way home, now they must travel to each world until they find theirs without getting killed or trapped in the world.Now there are some issues. The dvd case is cheap looking and at first is hard to master just to open it. Season 3 has 4 discs but in realiaty it has 8. Each disc is double sided which I personally dont like. They should have just had 8 discs. Or try to fit everything onto 4 discs. The special features are very limited. Season 3 has a gag real and episodes of ""Earh 2"" and another show I never even heard of.Now the reason why I gave this dvd dual pack a perfect score is because regardless or the dvd case, the lack of special features and the the 4x2 discs, this show is great. Each episode is exciting (though some arent as good as others) and intriguing with the what might have been theory.If you loved the show, if you love sci fi, or tv in general get this before they stop doing the dual pack (after you get seasons 1 & 2, then get 4), if you miss out still get it",5,Slide into the third season,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2024,"['used', 'love', 'watching', 'sliders', 'years', 'ago', 'reason', 'stopped', 'watching', '2nd', 'season', 'Possibly', 'didnt', 'have', 'cable', 'time', 'moved', 'sci', 'fi', 'Once', 'while', 'would', 'catch', 'reruns', 'when', 'could', 'years', 'later', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'stopped', 'Then', 'show', 'stopped', 'showing', 'reruns', 'was', 'missing', 'Sliders', 'again', 'saw', 'season', '1', '2', 'was', '20', 'got', 'then', 'found', '3', 'was', 'same', 'couldnt', 'resist.If', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'show', 'college', 'student', 'named', 'Quinn', 'Mallory', 'Jerry', ""O'Connel"", 'friend', 'who', 'girl', 'named', 'Wade', 'Wells', 'Sabrina', 'Loyd', 'former', '60s-70s', 'singer', 'Rambrant', 'brown', 'forgor', 'name', 'Prof.', 'Autaro', 'forgot', 'name', 'played', 'Glimii', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'discover', 'are', 'altnerate', 'universes', 'where', 'same', 'place', 'time', 'one', 'exception', 'same', 'people', 'sometimes', 'not', 'different', 'road', 'was', 'taken', 'Russia', 'won', 'cold', 'war', 'england', 'won', 'American', 'Revolution', 'etc', 'travel', 'worlds', 'cant', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'now', 'must', 'travel', 'world', 'find', 'theirs', 'getting', 'killed', 'trapped', 'world.Now', 'are', 'issues', 'dvd', 'case', 'cheap', 'looking', 'first', 'hard', 'master', 'just', 'open', 'Season', '3', '4', 'discs', 'realiaty', '8', 'disc', 'double', 'sided', 'personally', 'dont', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'had', '8', 'discs', 'try', 'fit', 'everything', '4', 'discs', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'limited', 'Season', '3', 'gag', 'real', 'episodes', 'Earh', '2', 'show', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'dvd', 'dual', 'pack', 'perfect', 'score', 'regardless', 'dvd', 'case', 'lack', 'special', 'features', '4x2', 'discs', 'show', 'great', 'episode', 'exciting', 'arent', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'intriguing', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'theory.If', 'loved', 'show', 'love', 'sci', 'fi', 'tv', 'general', 'get', 'stop', 'doing', 'dual', 'pack', 'get', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'then', 'get', '4', 'miss', 'out', 'still', 'get']",N/A

I was really psyched to find they made DVDs for the show.I never got to watch much of the third season, but upon picking it up--I'm kind of glad I didn't. Definitely not anywhere near as good as the first and second seasons.The DVDs menus are easy to navigate, have plenty of info, and most of all, have a 'Play All' feature--which is great for when you just want to have some background noise.It seems like they didn't learn from the season 1 & 2 DVD case, though. The case is a hard orange plastic that hardly moves. I wouldn't be surprised if it just breaks at the creases one day.The DVDs are double-sided, which to me is kind of a downer. This is a great age of technology and we're having to treat this like they're Laserdiscs? Only difference is I don't see any DVD players that'll read both sides...

906649,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0009JE6FC,Twiddles42,"[7, 7]","Seasons 1 and 2 allowed more creativity because they were filmed in Canada, with Tracy Torme having more input.  FOX, claiming bad ratings and pretending they know anything about sci-fi (or drama for that matter), change the premise of the series to allow our heroes to slide anywhere in a 4500 mile radius (said to be only between San Francisco and LA; never mind 400 mile radius could land anywhere and not sequentially either).FOX not only allowed the season to end on a cliffhanger (involving time travel, if things weren't daft enough already) but the whole season changes from an action/what-if thoughtfest into a movie ripoff of the week with sappy, maudlin characters.  There's more to sci-fi than character interaction, and seasons 1 and 2 managed to do everything right.  So what happens in season 3 that comes crashing everything down?  Obviously, the core necessity for any television -- the storylines themselves.  And trust me, I'm being lenient with 3 stars thanks to the small handful of decent entries...Now add in some atrocious incidental music and wince until you puke.  Then continue to wince.  Yuck.Tracy soon left the show, but keep an eye open for his penned episodes ""The Guardian"" and ""Double Cross"" - these stick to the proper premise of the series.And now to rate these stories:1- Rules Of The Game- 8/10The group lands on ""arcade world"" - an acquired taste, but works if you can suspend disbelief.2- Double Cross- 10/10Quinn's double on an Earth suffering energy shortages has a clever twist - best of the season, and sadly never brought through to any proper continuation, nor conclusion3- Electric Twister Acid Test- 2/10""Twister!""  'nuff said4- The Guardian- 10/10Parallel universe running on a slower elliptical curve; Quinn sees himself at an earlier time and interferes with his development5- The Dream Masters- 2/10Dweeby brats go into peoples' minds and kill them. Trite at best.  Shock jock blood; nothing special.  I'm sure they shamelessly ripped the idea from someone else; but even if they didn't, it's obscenely bad.6- Desert Storm- 1/10See ""Mad Max"" - Worse, this story is dedicated to a stunt man who died while making it.  A real tragedy, as the story is so much rubbish.  :(7- Dragonslide- 4/108- The Fire Within- 7/10The show finally addresses what happens if they land on a parallel earth that might prove less than capable of supporting life.  About time too! With some interesting ideas afoot, let down by more trite garbage and it seems the same computer platform has become standard on every parallel universe they go to too...  roll with the ideas and it'll work.9- The Prince Of Slides- 3/10Guess who gets pregnant?10- Dead Man Sliding- 3/10*sigh*  If only the title was referring to the mental state of the people watching this episode...11- State Of The A.R.T.- 2/10Well, he played Freddy Krueger.  He played a friendly lizard in a landmark sci-fi miniseries that had a lot more cranial work put into it...  So what's he doing in this garbage as an android?12- Season's Greedings- 1/10Never mind ""Lois and Farce - the new adventures of Stuporman"" (ABC) having a story of the same title; but the Jeffersons don't guest in this dog of an episode.  If only they had, I suppose...  You can guess the plot...  it's about greed at Christmastime...13- Murder Most Foul- 1/10No comment.  With a title like ""Foul"", it's too easy.14- Slide Like An Egyptian- 5/10Okay, they land on a world where the Egyptians maintained their society and somehow developed technology.  With all that silica around them, it'd have been easy enough...  Unfortunately, this story is more or less an excuse to get a new stylish looking timer, it could have been so much more - but am glad we got as little as we had.15- Paradise Lost- 4/10By this time, try ""Fanbase Lost"" instead.16- The Exodus, part one- 7/10Co-written by John Rhys-Davies, and is also his swansong.  Not the best way out; but by now it makes sense why he wanted out.  :(  A terrific premise, but I have to wonder how much was edited or removed from JR-D's control...17- The Exodus, part two- 1/10If only Roger Daltry stayed on further epidodes for the new quest and bash a few guitars along the way...  JR-D's demise is so incredibly unworthy and undeserved.18- Sole Survivors- 2/10The title must be a euphemism for the 2 people still watching the show, perhaps?19- The Breeder- 1/1020- The Last Eden- 2/1021- The Other Slide Of Darkness- 2/1022- Slither- 1/10""Anaconda"" - 'nuff said.25- Dinoslide- 3/10They go back to a previously visited world, but it's not the one from ""In Dino Veritas"", unfortunately...23- Stoker- 2/10""Dracula"".  Yawn.24- This Slide Of Paradise- 4/10""Island of Dr Moreau"" with the stupidest ending ever as Quinn and hottie Maggie are separated from (what FOX deemed deadweight) Rembrandt and Wade.Now Season 4 picks up a bit, but has to retcon the entire series' premise in order to do it.  Pity...  ""Sliders"" to me, will always be seasons 1 and 2; FOX slowly and brutally kills it in season 3, and Sci-Fi channel bastardizes it onward.

906650,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0009JE6FC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[61, 66]","First this is an honest to goodness review of the boxed set. There's no speculation here as to what's in the set. The first two seasons of ""Sliders"" found the series looking for its ""slider legs"" so to speak. By the second short season the series had found its niche and a solid direction for the series. Both seasons had their fair share of strong episodes. The third season was the first full one with 25 episodes produced. While there were about as many quality episodes here as seasons 1 & 2, we get a number of the series best episodes here including one where Dr. Arturo leaves the group permanently in a moving episode. Regardless, season three had a number of strong episodes (""Rules of the Game"", ""Number 1 Fan"", ""The Exodus"" Parts 1 & 2 and ""The Guardian"" are a few highlights). I'm not going to go over the plots of the episodes (there's too many to do justice to the series)but you can find synposis of each at the tv.com website.Image and sound quality are exceptionally good. The series looks great with vivid, bold colors and features nice use of the Dolby Digital Surround format (evidently Universal must be thinking of the other ""Sliders"" produced on an alternate Earth as they list the soundtrack as being in mono in a number of places). Extras are light for season three with only a gag reel (provided by one of the fan sites). There was more material that another fan site had and would have offered Universal for free if they had been contacted in time (at least according to Gord Lacey at tvondvd). I'm hoping he's right as, perhaps, we could see this material on the mixed fourth season boxed set.We do get as a bonus episodes of ""Earth 2"" and ""Cleopatra 2525"" (""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", no it isn't related to Nichoas Roeg's movie, and ""Quest for Fire Power"" respectively)which is designed to get ""Sliders"" fans to purchase those series as well. While ""Earth 2"" had its moments, ""Cleopatra 2525"" never appealed to me all that much.The packaging has improved with a digipak plastic container holding the discs. They no longer appear to ""hover"" in their container like the first season set (the design of which many fans disliked)but the digipak plastic container has its own challenges. Personally, I'm going to be putting mine into four slim line cases as these discs are dual sided and, as I experienced with ""The Outer Limits"", suffer damage so much easier than single sided dual layered discs.Overall, season three had a good run of great episodes. While the quantity of episodes was up the quality didn't increase with more episodes so there's about the same ratio of good to so-so episodes here. At least this set is more reasonably priced and that's good news.",4,"""Sliding"" into season 3 of cult sci-fi show",1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2694,"['First', 'honest', 'goodness', 'review', 'boxed', 'set', 'speculation', 'here', 'what', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Sliders', 'found', 'series', 'looking', 'slider', 'legs', 'so', 'speak', 'second', 'short', 'season', 'series', 'had', 'found', 'niche', 'solid', 'direction', 'series', 'Both', 'seasons', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'strong', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'first', 'full', 'one', '25', 'episodes', 'produced', 'were', 'about', 'as', 'many', 'quality', 'episodes', 'here', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'get', 'number', 'series', 'best', 'episodes', 'here', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Arturo', 'group', 'permanently', 'moving', 'episode', 'Regardless', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'number', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Rules', 'Game', 'Number', '1', 'Fan', 'Exodus', '1', '2', 'Guardian', 'are', 'few', 'highlights', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'plots', 'episodes', 'too', 'many', 'do', 'justice', 'series', 'can', 'find', 'synposis', 'tv.com', 'website.Image', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'series', 'great', 'vivid', 'bold', 'colors', 'features', 'nice', 'use', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'format', 'evidently', 'Universal', 'must', 'be', 'thinking', 'other', 'Sliders', 'produced', 'alternate', 'Earth', 'list', 'soundtrack', 'being', 'mono', 'number', 'places', 'Extras', 'are', 'light', 'season', 'three', 'only', 'gag', 'reel', 'provided', 'one', 'fan', 'was', 'more', 'material', 'fan', 'site', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'offered', 'Universal', 'free', 'had', 'been', 'contacted', 'time', 'least', 'according', 'Gord', 'Lacey', 'tvondvd', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'right', 'perhaps', 'could', 'see', 'material', 'mixed', 'fourth', 'season', 'boxed', 'set.We', 'do', 'get', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'Earth', '2', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'Man', 'Who', 'Fell', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'related', 'Nichoas', 'Roeg', 'movie', 'Quest', 'Fire', 'Power', 'respectively', 'designed', 'get', 'Sliders', 'fans', 'purchase', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Earth', '2', 'had', 'moments', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'never', 'appealed', 'much.The', 'packaging', 'improved', 'digipak', 'plastic', 'container', 'holding', 'discs', 'no', 'longer', 'appear', 'hover', 'container', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'design', 'many', 'fans', 'disliked', 'digipak', 'plastic', 'container', 'own', 'challenges', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'putting', 'four', 'slim', 'line', 'cases', 'discs', 'are', 'dual', 'sided', 'experienced', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'suffer', 'damage', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'single', 'sided', 'dual', 'layered', 'discs.Overall', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'good', 'run', 'great', 'episodes', 'quantity', 'episodes', 'was', 'up', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'increase', 'more', 'episodes', 'same', 'ratio', 'good', 'so-so', 'episodes', 'here', 'least', 'set', 'more', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'good', 'news']",N/A
