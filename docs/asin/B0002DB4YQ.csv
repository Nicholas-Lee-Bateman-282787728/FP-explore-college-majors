831078,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0002DB4YQ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Felini's films often carry with them this universally felt weight of humanity, as if you can feel the life lessons spilling from every frame due to the fact that you can ultimately relate to these characters and understand their plights.  This early lesser masterpiece is no different.  I label it a `lesser' masterpiece because it lacks the dynamic nature of films like `8 ' and `La Dolce Vita' but still maintains the earnest honesty that his films are synonymous with.In `I Vitelloni' we are introduced to five friends with varying degrees of laziness that dwell in an Italian neighborhood where their slacking nature is being driven to an end by the imposing walls of life.  Fausto knocked up Moraldo's sister and attempts to leave town but is forced to marry her and take up a job at a local religious gift shop.  Fausto's philandering ways are a problem though and threaten to derail his marriage and his life henceforth.  Alberto is struggling to keep peace in his home as he battles with his adulterous sister as she pursues a relationship with a married man.  Moraldo is trying to keep his friends in line, but especially reel in his new brother-in-law, and Leopold (and aspiring writer) and Riccardo (a talented singer) try to keep up with their feisty friends.While at times the film can feel scattered, it all comes together in such an organic way, and these characters are all given so much light (although Alberto and Fausto are certainly the more developed characters).  Alberto Sordi is sensational as the deeply affected Alberto, and Franco Fabrizi anchors this film in such a suavely unlikable way as the complicated Fausto.The technical aspects are all well placed, with a rapturous score and delightful cinematography, but it is Felini's direction and grasp of the material that makes this film so special.  It is a deeply personal film for Felini (semi-autobiographical) and it shows in the love poured into every frame!",5,Boys will be boys...,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1941,"['Felini', 'films', 'often', 'carry', 'universally', 'felt', 'weight', 'humanity', 'can', 'feel', 'life', 'lessons', 'spilling', 'frame', 'due', 'fact', 'can', 'ultimately', 'relate', 'characters', 'understand', 'plights', 'early', 'lesser', 'masterpiece', 'different', 'label', 'lesser', 'masterpiece', 'dynamic', 'nature', 'films', '8', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'still', 'earnest', 'honesty', 'films', 'are', 'synonymous', 'Vitelloni', 'are', 'introduced', 'five', 'friends', 'varying', 'degrees', 'laziness', 'dwell', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'slacking', 'nature', 'being', 'driven', 'end', 'imposing', 'walls', 'life', 'Fausto', 'knocked', 'up', 'Moraldo', 'sister', 'attempts', 'leave', 'town', 'forced', 'marry', 'take', 'up', 'job', 'local', 'religious', 'gift', 'shop', 'Fausto', 'philandering', 'ways', 'are', 'problem', 'threaten', 'derail', 'marriage', 'life', 'henceforth', 'Alberto', 'struggling', 'keep', 'peace', 'home', 'adulterous', 'sister', 'relationship', 'married', 'man', 'Moraldo', 'trying', 'keep', 'friends', 'line', 'especially', 'reel', 'new', 'brother-in-law', 'Leopold', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Riccardo', 'talented', 'singer', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'feisty', 'friends.While', 'times', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'scattered', 'together', 'such', 'organic', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'light', 'Alberto', 'Fausto', 'are', 'certainly', 'more', 'developed', 'characters', 'Alberto', 'Sordi', 'sensational', 'deeply', 'affected', 'Alberto', 'Franco', 'Fabrizi', 'anchors', 'film', 'suavely', 'unlikable', 'way', 'complicated', 'Fausto.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'rapturous', 'score', 'delightful', 'cinematography', 'Felini', 'direction', 'grasp', 'material', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'deeply', 'personal', 'film', 'Felini', 'semi-autobiographical', 'love', 'poured', 'frame']",I Vitelloni

831080,A11KNUBP56G6AL,B0002DB4YQ,Arlee Bird,"[0, 0]","This film delivered far more than I was expecting.  This is the neo-realism side of Fellini prior to his transition into the more surrealistic fare that came later.  The film is a premonition of things to come in later films such as &#34;8 1/2&#34; and &#34;Amarcord&#34;--some of the scenes are very similar to later Fellini films.  The story is a sort of coming of age story (though we wonder how much the characters really learn) of 5 friends in a small Italian seaside town where not much happens on the surface of things.  But in the story it's the little things that matter and as he does so well in his films, Fellini pays close attention to detail.  After all in a little insignificant seeming town it's the detail that is mostly all people have.The story is mundane over all, but touching in small ways.  Nothing grandiose.  This is life as most of us probably know it to one extent or another.  &#34;I Vitelloni&#34; could easily be our own story if filled with the people, places, and events in our own lives.  It's a tale that made me smile and feel just a bit wistful.The Criterion DVD is a much better transfer than I expected.  The image is sharp and the sound comes across clearly.  The film is over 60 years old, yet the picture quality was like it had recently been made.I'm a Fellini nut so I'm definitely biased about his movies.

It's about five shiftless men in a provincial Italian town who never grow up and accept responsibility. The movie centers around Fausto, a womanizer, who even after marriage (it's a shotgun wedding) roves after other women. Most of the other men aren't much to write home about, either: one (Leopoldo) is a playwright churning out awful plays and dreaming they'll be performed someday (not on this planet), and another (Alberto) still lives with his mom and sister.  Only one of them has the courage to leave this wasteland at the movie's end, and his poignant farewell scene is the highlight of the movie. I found it difficult to be drawn into the plight of these men; perhaps it's because their empty lives and wasted dreams are just so hopeless and depressing.

The general impression is the same: a melancholic, tender-hearted remembrance of bygone times.I Vitelloni (the guys) is a bunch of provincial young men who don't want to grow up. They linger in an idyllic town living their joyful and careless lives. But the world does not stop even if they have. Life brings many changes and responsibilities which they don't want to face, not yet. But they all will have to, inevitably.This is such a good movie because it's story is the story of every human being who wakes up one day and realizes that he is the master of his own life; and here's the kick, a life that calls for making choices and bearing their consequences.Its a very humorous and, at the same time, sad story. Young men who don't want to grow up, who don't want to work, simply because there's no urgent need to do it (work as last resource). This is also a good portrait of family life and social conditions in Western Europe after the Marshall Plan had been implemented.I love Fellini's movies (most of them) specially because of this harmless and innocent way of critizicing -if not just simply depicting- his world.

It's vivid, beautiful rendered, wry and wise.  It's also one artist's heartfelt look at a pivotal juncture in his life -- whereas his later masterpieces analyzed the entry into middle age, ""Vitelloni"" looks at the loss of the privelages of youth.  It's gorgeous, funny and occasionally quite stinging.This is an enormously influential film -- it's a mirror image of ""Diner"" and a clear influence on Scorsese, who borrowed subtexts and shots for ""Who's That Knocking,"" ""Mean Streets"" and -- with its gliding camera and voiceover introductions -- ""Goodfellas.""""I Vitelloni"" hasn't been easily available in the past.

It also augurs a theme that Fellini would satirize to grand fruition in La Dolce Vita, his masterpiece: the anomy of modern human existence. There was a time when life was arranged- marriages and apprenticeships. But Fellini was alive at the time that changed, and the modern loner was born.

They are adults but they don't act like adults. They spend idle time hanging out and coming home in the later night. The cad Fausto gets Miss Mermaid Sandra pregnant and he has to marry her. However this doesn't stop him from being a cad. He continues his little exploits until it gets him in trouble with the boss when he finds out that he has hit on his wife. Alberto was the comical juvenile of the group. He entertained the crowd with his antics. He was also compassionate towards his mother and his sister. When his sister leaves with her lover, both he and his mother are devastated. Looking at this part, the sister was the sole income earner and it was time for her to get a life of her own. Alberto couldn't forever rely on her for money and getting away was the best thing for her to do; even it meant running off with a married lover.Riccardo, played by the director's brother, just sang and enjoyed the company of the men. There wasn't much centered around his character and it was for the best because the movie would've taken longer and it would have strayed from what the movie itself is about. Leopoldi, the intellectual of the group, had opportunities to leave and begin his playwriting career. But sometimes letting go can be hard to do. Your friends are your source of support. But friends can sometimes let you down. And there's Moraldo. He is the youngest one of the group. But he is the observant of the gentlemen and their actions. He has to be the one to keep them in line. Even this can be a burden on him. Especially when he sees his close friend Fausto cheat on his sister. Moraldo was more grown up than the rest of the fellows. He knew that it was his time to leave Rimini and live his own life.This isn't my first time seeing a Fellini movie.

831087,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B0002DB4YQ,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","I watched I VITELLONI a few days before the beginning of the BBC Radio 4 celebration of British neo-realistic novels and plays such as THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER and THIS SPORTING LIFE. After having watched the film, I realized that Fellini's film adumbrates many of the themes discussed in the British works: a study of young men living in small-town Italy, I VITELLONI captures the futility of their existences as they play pool in seedy halls, loaf aimlessly about the litter-strewn streets and try to enjoy themselves. Fausto (Franco Fabrizi) gets Sandra (Eleonora Ruffo) pregnant and has to marry her; but his wandering eye prevents him from sustaining a stable relationship. Although the two are reconciled at the end, we have no guarantee that they will stay together. Eventually Fausto's friend Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) leaves the small town life for good; he does not know where he is going, but he feels he has to escape (in an ending that foreshadows Schlesinger's BILLY LIAR). Brilliantly photographed in atmospheric black-and-white, I VITELLONI portrays a fundamentally indifferent world where passers-by walk past without even glancing at one another; and life revolves around clutter-strewn shops and seedy bars.

This movie about 5 friends growing up in a small Italian town is a well made and written movie that is as lighthearted and free as the characters populating it, until one character makes a stupid error of judgement and the movie becomes as serious as his situation.  You feel for the characters but at the same time you feel they are too naive and careless, and that despite their age and responsiblities, they really are immature people trying to live life in limbo without worries, until the responsibilities presented to our main character become to much to bear when he ignores them, and the consequences are seen.  The movie questions what 'maturization' is and by the end you have a feeling of the quiet character througout the entire film, unsure of the answer but knowing it isn't there; the movie leaves with a question mark, and despite not living up to Fellini's following and later efforts, it is a well made if slow going movie filled with these 'vitelloni's trying to find their role in life.",4,"Good early Fellini: when does one 'grow up', if they do?",1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,1220,"['Vitelloni', 'early', 'Fellini', 'film', 'talents', 'filmmaker', 'creating', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'unique', 'ability', 'put', 'characters', 'situations', 'truly', 'express', 'inner', 'character', 'movie', '5', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'small', 'Italian', 'town', 'well', 'made', 'written', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'free', 'characters', 'populating', 'one', 'character', 'stupid', 'error', 'judgement', 'movie', 'as', 'serious', 'situation', 'feel', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'are', 'too', 'naive', 'careless', 'age', 'responsiblities', 'really', 'are', 'immature', 'people', 'trying', 'live', 'life', 'limbo', 'worries', 'responsibilities', 'presented', 'main', 'character', 'become', 'much', 'bear', 'when', 'consequences', 'are', 'seen', 'movie', 'questions', 'what', ""'maturization"", 'end', 'have', 'feeling', 'quiet', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'unsure', 'answer', 'knowing', ""n't"", 'movie', 'question', 'mark', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'Fellini', 'following', 'later', 'efforts', 'well', 'made', 'slow', 'going', 'movie', 'filled', 'trying', 'find', 'role', 'life']",I Vitelloni

""Vitellone"" means ""idle young person of the provinces, often an eternal student"". The title matches its characters very well. They live in the town where nothing much happens; they don't have jobs and spend the money given by their loving families. They have the most ardent hopes and they face the cruel disappointments. They are different - cynical skirt chaser Fausto who is forced to marry a girl pregnant with his baby; the intellectual and ambitious Leopoldo who dreams of becoming a famous writer; the irresponsible ""big child"" Alberto (Alberto Sordy, the famous comic, absolutely wonderful in his early role), and Moraldo, the only one of the group who in the final scene will leave the town of his childhood to start a new life.I loved I Vitelloni. Nino Rota's music is above any words (as always) as well as the young director's camera work, the character study and acting. I think of ""I Vitelloni"" as more realistic and sober ""Amarcord"" in B/W. One of scenes was absolutely stunning -the carnival - the music, the dancing, the camera's rapid but fluid movements - simply breathtaking.It is without doubt that Fellini influenced a lot of directors, and there are similarities between ""I Vitelloni"" and George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" and Barry Levinson's ""Diner"". Stanley Kubrick and Marin Scorsese both named ""I Vitelloni"" as one of their favorite films.Highly recommended: 9/10 (or 4.5/5)",4,The Eternal Students,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,1691,"['Somewhere', 'way', 'neo-', 'sur-', 'young', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'had', 'made', 'Vitelloni', '1953', 'lighthearted', 'unconventional', 'bold', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'hopes', 'miseries', 'four', 'friends', 'four', 'young', 'men', 'Vitelloni', 'small', 'seashore', 'province', 'town', 'Vitellone', 'idle', 'young', 'person', 'provinces', 'often', 'eternal', 'student', 'title', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'live', 'town', 'where', 'nothing', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'jobs', 'spend', 'money', 'given', 'loving', 'families', 'have', 'most', 'ardent', 'hopes', 'face', 'cruel', 'disappointments', 'are', 'different', 'cynical', 'skirt', 'chaser', 'Fausto', 'who', 'forced', 'marry', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'intellectual', 'ambitious', 'Leopoldo', 'who', 'becoming', 'famous', 'writer', 'irresponsible', 'big', 'child', 'Alberto', 'Alberto', 'Sordy', 'famous', 'comic', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'early', 'role', 'Moraldo', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'leave', 'town', 'childhood', 'start', 'new', 'life.I', 'loved', 'Vitelloni', 'Nino', 'Rota', 'music', 'words', 'always', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'director', 'camera', 'work', 'character', 'study', 'acting', 'think', 'Vitelloni', 'more', 'realistic', 'sober', 'Amarcord', 'B/W', 'One', 'scenes', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', '-the', 'carnival', 'music', 'dancing', 'camera', 'rapid', 'fluid', 'movements', 'simply', 'breathtaking.It', 'doubt', 'Fellini', 'influenced', 'lot', 'directors', 'are', 'similarities', 'Vitelloni', 'George', 'Lucas', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'Diner', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Marin', 'Scorsese', 'named', 'Vitelloni', 'one', 'favorite', 'films.Highly', 'recommended', '9/10', '4.5/5']",I Vitelloni

Drawing on his own beginnings, Fellini creates one of the crowning coming-of-age stories, a meditation on the bonds of loyalty, friendship, and home that features early glimpses of the maestro's fascination with all things carnivalesque, and a memorably bittersweet farewell.

831093,A2ECPW4RA7NWMP,B0002DB4YQ,John Sollami,"[6, 7]","Barry Levinson's ""Diner"" must have been inspired by this ground-breaking work of genius from 1953 written by Federico Fellini. Both ""I Vitelloni"" and ""Diner"" are about five males who linger somewhere between childhood and manhood, sensing the greater world beyond their small domain, but who are incapable of breaking out of the protective comfort of what they know so well. Both directors are known to have given their actors little in the way of direction. Both accepted their actors on their own terms, as the people they were, and let them embody the characters they played as naturally as water embraces the shape of the objects it fills. For me, ""I Vitelloni"" is by far the greater work. It's the template from which every other work about aimless youth has been pressed. Much of what takes place in this movie is autobiographical, and some of it is coaxed from Fellini's dreams and passions. As a great artist, Fellini changed the way we see ourselves, and the word ""vitelloni"" itself became a new expression for soft, well-fed young people with no direction. Only his second film, the first being the box-office flop ""The White Sheik,"" starring Alberto Sordi, Fellini took his sweet time putting this together. He shot it over a period of four months in various locations, none of which was Rimini, the city of his youth. He was just 30 years old, full of wit, spontaneity, humor, and joy, all of which would slowly fade away with the oncoming years. Alberto Sordi again appears here, even though he was obviously not liked by the viewing public, but he is triumphant as Alberto. In fact, there isn't a weak performance anywhere to be found in this fantastic cast. Entertaining from the opening moment to the closing poignant scene, this masterpiece is all about a specific group of young Italian men, almost a leisure class supported by their families, who must come to terms with women, their dreams, their families, and themselves. And it is about a much larger theme: what makes up a meaningful life? For one character who eventually leaves this small town, Moraldo, the search itself for meaning draws him away. Moraldo is, in fact, a stand-in for Fellini, as he left Rimini at the age of 17 to seek his fortunes in Rome. What meaning he found was in his cinematic art, his writing, and his directing. We are privileged to bear witness to that genius by viewing the treasures that sprang from his mind.And in particular, this version of the movie on ""The Criterion Collection,"" put out in 2004, provides us with wonderful insights into this work as well as informative interviews from original cast members and the assistant director. I personally couldn't ask for more.If you want to see a true cinematic masterpiece, get this movie.

The success of this film, sometimes played as ""The Bachelors"" provokes the release of his previous film (the first) in a badly dubbed and cut up copy which gave no hints of the richness of his compositions or even his plot line.  Today we are blessed with the sense of what came after, and sometimes people come to this film expecting to see the later Fellini of HULIET OF THE SPIRITS or 8  and oh, are they in for a shock.  Here it is a tamer Fellini, without the wild flights of fancy and without, I expect, the huge budgets either.  Some say that Riccardo, Federico's brother and the originator of the screenplay, kept the realist flame burning longer than Federico, whose soul was more poetic and surrealist.  Here, the guys are pretty dreary.  Sure, one or two of them have that Italian charm and appeal that (in later films) Fellini brought out of Mastroianni, but as a group they are pretty lackluster.Their different problems are handled oh so simply.  One is a ladies man who can't keep it in his pants even after he gets married.  Another is the brother of the betrayed wife, but he too is so charmed by Fausto that he never even complains.  All of these guys seemed like mama's boys to US audiences of the mid-1950s, when most men were looking for their own place to live as soon as they turned 18, not hanging on at home till one's parents died, but such was the socio-economic climate in postwar Italy, when housing construction was at an all-time low after the Fascist building boom of 1928-1940.  There simply wasn't any place for young people to live.  And also, in a Church dominated country, there was no place to make love or even have a moment's privacy.  One's social life was held in bars, restaurants, on the streets, or in musical settings.  There was a colorful street life, but in this movie at least, not much fun.  Everyone works and lives for the weekend.  It makes the drudgery of MYSTIC PIZZA look like ROMAN HOLIDAY.I saw this film in a cinema club made up of five guys whose lives were all pretty much like the men in this movie, except we were all 14 and they look like they're pushing 40.

The mutual motivations for the five men that keeps them adrift are women, wine, and the stories they tell each other.

The lazy Alberto is the groups clown who is dependent on his mother whom he will never leave.  Alberto frequently pleads for money from his sister as he is continuously broke.  Eventually Alberto finds out that his sister has a married lover and it angers him.  Leopold an aspiring writer and the intellectual of the group dreams of fame and success.  The singer Riccardo follows the group on its nightly adventures.

However, Moraldo has not yet found the courage to leave the small seaside town.I Vitelloni is the second film that Fellini directed by himself which he also co-wrote with his talented brother, Riccardo Fellini.  Riccardo and Federico based the script on semi-autographical accounts from their home town and a life which they both were very much inclined to depict.  Unlike many of Fellini's later films I Vitelloni displays some of the Italian neo-realistic cinematic qualities that were common in the period when the film was shot.  The realism brings an honest and warm atmosphere to the film which emphasizes the true nature of the characters.  Realism in the script allows the audience is to experience an examination of the different characters in the film.  This character study brings the audience candid emotions and a brilliant cinematic experience that warms the heart as there are hopes and dreams for us all.",5,A Candid and Warm Cinematic Event...,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,2368,"['Trapped', 'timeless', 'sphere', 'pressure', 'accomplishment', 'maternal', 'love', 'nurses', 'five', 'men', 'way', 'adolescence', 'small', 'tourist', 'town', 'Adriatic', 'Sea', 'post-war', 'Italy', 'five', 'men', 'drift', 'dreaming', 'escape', 'town', 'lack', 'motivation', 'prisoners', 'seaside', 'location', 'mutual', 'motivations', 'five', 'men', 'adrift', 'are', 'women', 'wine', 'stories', 'tell', 'other', 'However', 'character', 'own', 'motivating', 'factor', 'forward', 'daily', 'life.The', 'group', 'five', 'men', 'Fausto', 'Franco', 'Fabrizi', 'Alberto', 'Alberto', 'Sordi', 'Leopoldo', 'Leopoldo', 'Trieste', 'Riccardo', 'Riccardo', 'Fellini', 'Moraldo', 'group', 'leader', 'Fausto', 'perpetual', 'flirter', 'gotten', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'Fausto', 'father', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'marry', 'girl', 'disgraced', 'public', 'lazy', 'Alberto', 'groups', 'clown', 'who', 'dependent', 'mother', 'whom', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'Alberto', 'frequently', 'money', 'sister', 'continuously', 'broke', 'Eventually', 'Alberto', 'out', 'sister', 'married', 'lover', 'Leopold', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'intellectual', 'group', 'fame', 'success', 'singer', 'Riccardo', 'group', 'nightly', 'Moraldo', 'philosophical', 'moralist', 'streets', 'night', 'deep', 'thought', 'faults', 'way', 'live', 'life', 'However', 'Moraldo', 'not', 'yet', 'found', 'courage', 'leave', 'small', 'seaside', 'town.I', 'Vitelloni', 'second', 'film', 'Fellini', 'directed', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'talented', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'Fellini', 'Riccardo', 'Federico', 'based', 'script', 'semi-autographical', 'accounts', 'home', 'town', 'life', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'inclined', 'depict', 'many', 'Fellini', 'later', 'films', 'Vitelloni', 'Italian', 'neo-realistic', 'cinematic', 'qualities', 'were', 'common', 'period', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'realism', 'honest', 'warm', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'true', 'nature', 'characters', 'Realism', 'script', 'audience', 'experience', 'examination', 'different', 'characters', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'audience', 'candid', 'emotions', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'heart', 'are', 'hopes', 'dreams']",I Vitelloni

This movie shows that.In this movie too, you start to see scenes that will reappear throughout the rest of Fellini's career. One in particular is the mambo dancing scene, which resembles the same kind of surreal quality as similar scenes in 8 1/2 and Amarcord.All together this is an incredibly enjoyable movie, and should be a must see for any foreign movie fan.

831097,A237RLQXTL55RG,B0002DB4YQ,off the tropic,"[0, 0]","""I Vitelloni"" is a tragicomic look at the life of five young men in a small provincial town in Italy. Leisurely fun, boredom, listlessness and frustrated ambition define their lives. They want to leave their provincial town and live life to the fullest in a city. But they cannot. There is always some reason, good or bad, to hold them back. Love and an early marriage for Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), duty to stay behind and allay the worries of a mother and sister for Alberto (Alberto Soldi), loyalty to close friend and brother-in-law Fausto and protecting Fausto's marriage to his sister Sandri (Leanora Ruffo) for Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), writing that significant play that will be a ticket out of this town into the high culture of the cities for Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) who is at the brink of writing a significant play but is almost always never quite there, and continuous distractions for Ricardo (Ricardo Fellini). Each one believes they will get out but they just cannot undo the meandering and stultifying influence of their provincial town and their loyal gang of friends who cannot be anything more than mere ""loafers"".Fausto is the leader of this group of idlers. He is thirty and the only skill he can boast is his ability to seduce just any lady in town he sets his heart on. He does his philandering bit without guilt. Early in the film his roving eye gets the better of him - we learn that he has gone too far with the beautiful Sandri. When Sandri is ""expecting"", Fausto is forced to consider delaying his plans of going out into the world and make the most of his life. If he had his way he would take the next train out of town. He even impulsively tries to run away but his disciplinarian father stops him. Fausto is run back to the altar. As Ricardo says, Fausto is a passionate man, and he really does not mean any harm. He may be a ladykiller when he has his way but we see him reduced to a boy more than willing to admit remorse and take his father's invectives with child like remorse. He dutifully marries Sandri. He is even happy that he is marrying her, since the wedding day, its festivities, the momentary spot light it offers is not as bad as he thinks it is. Morover, he does love Sandri in his own way.Fellini's magic is at full play in ""I Vitelloni"" with his definitive creation of an Italian ""Dmitri Karamazov"". A man who is in love with life. His relentless appetite for women hardly has a trace of furtiveness or malice about it. He is no Don Juan. A seducer set on ruining the lives of his victims. There is an innocent flirtatiousness about the protagonist Fausto. He is the personification of sensuality and he cannot help himself as he moves from submitting to one ""temptation"" to another.His lack of furtiveness is evident when he does all this unabated in front of his brother-in-law Moraldo. His friends know he is just being himself. He does not intend to harm Sandri. How could he since he is only doing what he has always seemingly done. Why resist what is natural? This is one way to describe Fausto. But after his marriage the sense of furtiveness in his exploits grows. He cannot help but feel guilty about it. Much of Fellini's nuance as a storyteller is fully at display here. He documents this delicate unraveling of a man who is gradually growing up to the realization of ""duty"" and ""love"". It is touching to see the growth of ""Fausto"". He has that all embracing craving to ""know"" women and this ravenous appetite to""know"" in this sense ties him to the legendary Faustian figure. Sandri is his Gretchen. Sandri and now his ""bambino"" offer him a new kind of happiness. He is on the brink of losing it all. The core drama of this film is seeing if he ends up like Faust, damned eternally.And Sandri played by Leanora Ruffo has that element of beauty that Fellini alone can bring alive. It is not just her wonderful looks; Her's is a sensuous beauty. But there is something much deeper. And this quality is given to her by the character that is spun out by Fellini's incomparable cinematic eye. He has a way of resurrecting beauty that is unlike anything I have seen in cinema. There is the undefinable purity about her that reminds me of Giulietta Masina's Gelsomina character in ""La Strada"". Beauty's innocence takes on a secret rage when it is wronged. Beauty looks sacred here. Sandri's innocence takes on a real power in this sense towards the end of the film. And we respond to that power as much as Fausto and everyone around her does. With a broken heart. This response could only happen in a Fellini film. This mixture of amusement and light heartedness that these characters initially evoke changes to a growing heaviness. I respond to some characters in Dostoevsky and Shakespeare in the same way.If only Fellini had adapted a Dostoevsky film! He has that marvelous comic sense that changes to deep tragedy. Fellini is in love with the ""fool"", the ""idiot"", that we encounter in Russian novels and Elizabethan plays. If he had tried his hand in directing Shakespeare and Dostoevsky it would have surely resurrected a different philosophy of adaptation preached often by Nietzsche. It takes a great artist to breathe life into the great works of the past. Only great artists can be great interpreters. Seeing ""I Vitelloni"" I can only dream what this great filmmaker could have done to the business of Shakespeare and Dostoevsky criticism. At the very least he would have kept the likes of Visconti and Kurosawa company.",5,I Vitelloni,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,5489,"['Vitelloni', 'tragicomic', 'look', 'life', 'five', 'young', 'men',

831099,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0002DB4YQ,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This film is a must-have for any fan of Fellini.  His second film under his complete control, it was his first large success and established him as a European cultural force.  Beyond that legacy, it is a great story and has only a mild dreamy quality to it, which would become his trademark later.The principal characters are a group of childhood friends who are no longer young.  With the exception of the singer, they are all unemployed and still living with their parents, even though they are entering their 30s.  They still love to hang out, never follow through on their dreams to leave their dinky seaside town, and seek one night stands rather than relationships.  They cannot make real choices, are frustrated with the families they cannot leave and are dependent upon, and prefer to build some unrealizable future in their imaginations.While trying to disappear on a train out of town, the principal character is forced to marry the sister of his best friend, a beautiful girl whom he has gotten pregnant.  However, though married and in a deadend shop job his father in law found for him at his best friend's business, he continues on in the same way, chasing girls even when out with his wife, getting into stupid schemes to make a quick buck, and partying with his friends rather than returning home.  Once his baby is born, he really messes up, staying out all night with one of his lovers and getting caught stealing from his employer (after coming on to his wife, a lovely older woman).  This leads to a crisis, perhaps the first of his life, and he has to decide whether or not to grow up.  (I reveal nothing here as this is on the jacket blurb.)This kind of immature man may strike AMerican viewers as outlandish, if not unbelievable.  These guys, they say, are still living with their mothers!  Nonetheless, after having lived in Italy for 4 years, I can say that there are plenty of men like that, indeed that it is typical even for married couples to live with their parents or in-laws for decades, in large part because their wages are so low that they can't afford an apartment of their own.  The mother continues to control the life of her son, cleaning and cooking for him to chagrin of many a new wife.  For example, one of our friends who was getting divorced said, ""I just hope I can find a 40-year old man who doesn't still live with his mother.""  She wasn't joking and you can imagine how mature they might be.  Here Fellini has portrayed this mentality, with humor and pathos, better than any other fiction I have ever seen.Warmly recommended.

831100,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B0002DB4YQ,Russell Fanelli,"[6, 6]","I Vitelloni, released in 1953, is Federico Fellini's first commercially successful film and we are fortunate that the Criterion Collection decided to make it available on DVD in August of this year.Moraldo, who looks to be in his mid-thirties, represents Fellini.  Moraldo and four of his friends hang around a seaside town in northern Italy looking for anything interesting to do to distract them from the boredom of their wasted lives.  The young men are Vitelloni, slang in Italian for loafers.  All of the young men have dreams, but not much ambition.  Only Moraldo will find the courage to break free of the paralysis that traps the young men in surroundings too comfortable to leave but with no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.Fellini gives us the story of each of the five men, but more attention is paid to Fausto, a womanizer who impregnates Moraldo's sister and then is forced to marry her.  Marriage is hardly an inconvenience to Fausto, who immediately cheats on his wife every chance he gets.  Moraldo knows that Fausto is unfaithful, but his allegiance to his friend is greater than to his sister.  Like Fellini, Moraldo is a careful observer of his surroundings, but does not criticize or judge what he sees.  He appears to be somewhat detached and thoughtful.  He is a good friend to have if not a protective brother to his sister.I Vitelloni is a slice of Italian life that resonates deeply with the viewer.  Fellini organizes carefully each scene and then allows his actors the freedom to bring to life the characters they represent.  His confidence in his actors is repaid by superb performances from each member of his cast.  For the first time we see and experience his enormous talent as a director.  His next film, the great La Strada, and then later such superb films such as La Dolce Vita and Amarcord, confirm his importance as a director of the first rank.With the release of I Vitelloni, the Criterion Collection continues to provide a valuable service for the lovers of great, classic films.  Fans of Federico Fellini are sure to enjoy this first glimpse of the master at work.

What is the point of this?""

Then I actually watched it - all I saw on the screed was Federico - his personality is so strong it comes out in everything he does - and this is indeed one of my new favorites. Interestingly, this and 'White Shiek' were Orson Welles' favorite Fellini movies! I think the camera work contains something that had not been seen up to that point in neo-realism - there is something in the choice of composition that seperates Fellini here from the stately angles of Visconti, and the more static pictures of Rossellini. Surely, this is a movie to be watched by all Fellini fans - and for some reason I think it contains many elements of his later films. At times I was reminded of 'Nights of Cabiria' perhaps it was the party sequence - but it seemed more in the general style of filming.

831104,A13ROGMWR5SZ7G,B0002DB4YQ,"Steven Haskins ""(the architect)""","[1, 1]","I decided to start my Fellini collection with this, his first big release, on a definitive DVD version from Criterion. First of all the Criterion edition may be the best available version of the film but it does have problems that were transferred from the original. Most irritating is at scene/camera angle changes where the frame skips or jumps, just as though the original print had been poorly spliced or damaged at a splice. I don't expect Criterion to fill in gaps from missing frames but I do expect them to take the frames that are available and make sure they are registered properly in the correct location for duplication into digital format, so that the frames don't jump when watching the DVD.Once into the film these problems can be ignored, as the story and characters are somewhat interesting. Having seen several of his later films and knowing this to be a tale of a group of friends in an Italian town, I expected a quirky and amusing comedy. Instead the film struck me as a precursor to those later, great films. It is like a pencil sketch made by an artist prior to them painting a masterpiece. The sketch relays the basic idea of the masterpiece but lacks color, depth, and appropriate detail.Rather than being a solidly amusing tale Vitelloni seems to play along the border between drama and comedy, never venturing solidly into humor. The only amusing scene that comes to mind is when a famous but over-the-hill actor asks one of the group, a struggling writer, to sit on the pier with him so that the writer can read his play to the actor. The young writer suddenly senses the actor may be interested in more than just the play, and runs off.As a drama the characters' lives and stories don't seem well enough developed to hold the entire film together. My overall impression is that the film is interesting, especially to a Fellini fan, but likely leaves the average American viewer unfulfilled and unimpressed.  Because of this I can only give it four stars when I would happily give his later films six.",4,"""Okay""",1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2030,"['decided', 'start', 'Fellini', 'collection', 'first', 'big', 'release', 'definitive', 'DVD', 'version', 'Criterion', 'First', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'available', 'version', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'were', 'transferred', 'original', 'Most', 'irritating', 'scene/camera', 'angle', 'changes', 'where', 'frame', 'jumps', 'just', 'original', 'print', 'had', 'been', 'poorly', 'spliced', 'damaged', 'splice', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Criterion', 'fill', 'gaps', 'missing', 'frames', 'do', 'expect', 'take', 'frames', 'are', 'available', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'registered', 'properly', 'correct', 'location', 'duplication', 'digital', 'format', 'frames', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'when', 'watching', 'DVD.Once', 'film', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'ignored', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'Having', 'seen', 'several', 'later', 'films', 'knowing', 'be', 'tale', 'group', 'friends', 'Italian', 'town', 'expected', 'quirky', 'amusing', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'film', 'struck', 'precursor', 'later', 'great', 'films', 'pencil', 'sketch', 'made', 'artist', 'prior', 'painting', 'masterpiece', 'sketch', 'basic', 'idea', 'masterpiece', 'color', 'depth', 'appropriate', 'detail.Rather', 'being', 'solidly', 'amusing', 'tale', 'Vitelloni', 'play', 'border', 'drama', 'comedy', 'never', 'venturing', 'solidly', 'humor', 'only', 'amusing', 'scene', 'mind', 'when', 'famous', 'over-the-hill', 'actor', 'one', 'group', 'struggling', 'writer', 'sit', 'pier', 'so', 'writer', 'can', 'read', 'play', 'actor', 'young', 'writer', 'suddenly', 'actor', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'more', 'just', 'play', 'off.As', 'drama', 'characters', 'lives', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'well', 'enough', 'developed', 'hold', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'overall', 'impression', 'film', 'interesting', 'especially', 'Fellini', 'fan', 'likely', 'average', 'American', 'viewer', 'unfulfilled', 'unimpressed', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'when', 'would', 'happily', 'give', 'later', 'films', 'six']",I Vitelloni
831105,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B0002DB4YQ,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","The impressive third film by Federico Fellini, I vitelloni, is one of his most accessible because it has less typical Fellini-esque qualities; even as an adoring Fellini fan, I recognize that not everyone would necessarily enjoy his whimsical, surreal, and fantastical depictions of Italian life. This movie, about five young men in postwar Italy, exhibits more neorealism common to other Italian directors of that time. Its groundedness makes it almost feel not like a Fellini film.The structure of the film, like later Fellini, is rather fluid and lacks the traditional plot you expect; there is not really a beginning, middle, or end, but rather a series of vignettes showing the relationship among these men. We see their romantic, creative, and professional prospects throughout nearly two hours with them, told with wit and realism. It is a picture into typical Italian life for a very particular subset of the population: late twentysomething / early thirtysomething men.This may be a result of the release date of the film (in the early 1950s), but the chronology and age of the characters plays an interesting role in our perspective of them. In Italian, vitelloni is slang for slackers, and these men certainly fit that bill, loafing through life rather aimlessly. Given that one of the men turns 30 during the course of the film, we can calculate backwards and figure out that these men would have just been too young (under 18) when World War II hit. Their experience was vastly different than those just older than them, and did not experience the hardships and devastation of war abroad. This theme is evident in their relationships with those older than them, as the men lack the discipline and seriousness of their parents.In addition to their immaturity by age, we also see the recurring Fellini theme of reckless and insensitive masculinity. The standard tropes of Italian machismo, of being overbearing and aggressive towards women and overall arrogance are shown in all the young men. These negative qualities, however, do backfire and they are forced to deal with the consequences.While not his most memorable or even one of his best works, Federico Fellini's I vitelloni is still a great piece of art, reflective of its time and culture.",5,"Great, down-to-earth Fellini",1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2259,"['impressive', 'third', 'film', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'vitelloni', 'one', 'most', 'accessible', 'less', 'typical', 'Fellini-esque', 'qualities', 'even', 'adoring', 'Fellini', 'fan', 'recognize', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'necessarily', 'enjoy', 'whimsical', 'surreal', 'fantastical', 'depictions', 'Italian', 'life', 'movie', 'about', 'five', 'young', 'men', 'postwar', 'Italy', 'more', 'neorealism', 'common', 'other', 'Italian', 'directors', 'time', 'groundedness', 'almost', 'feel', 'not', 'Fellini', 'film.The', 'structure', 'film', 'later', 'Fellini', 'rather', 'fluid', 'traditional', 'plot', 'expect', 'not', 'really', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'rather', 'series', 'vignettes', 'showing', 'relationship', 'men', 'see', 'romantic', 'creative', 'professional', 'prospects', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'told', 'wit', 'realism', 'picture', 'typical', 'Italian', 'life', 'very', 'particular', 'subset', 'population', 'late', 'twentysomething', '/', 'early', 'thirtysomething', 'men.This', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'release', 'date', 'film', 'early', '1950s', 'chronology', 'age', 'characters', 'plays', 'interesting', 'role', 'perspective', 'Italian', 'slang', 'slackers', 'men', 'certainly', 'fit', 'bill', 'loafing', 'life', 'rather', 'aimlessly', 'Given', 'one', 'men', '30', 'course', 'film', 'can', 'calculate', 'backwards', 'figure', 'out', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'too', 'young', '18', 'when', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'hit', 'experience', 'was', 'vastly', 'different', 'just', 'older', 'did', 'not', 'experience', 'hardships', 'devastation', 'war', 'abroad', 'theme', 'evident', 'relationships', 'older', 'men', 'lack', 'discipline', 'seriousness', 'parents.In', 'addition', 'immaturity', 'age', 'also', 'see', 'recurring', 'Fellini', 'theme', 'reckless', 'insensitive', 'masculinity', 'standard', 'tropes', 'Italian', 'machismo', 'being', 'overbearing', 'aggressive', 'towards', 'women', 'overall', 'arrogance', 'are', 'shown', 'young', 'men', 'negative', 'qualities', 'however', 'do', 'backfire', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'consequences.While', 'not', 'most', 'memorable', 'even', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'vitelloni', 'still', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'reflective', 'time', 'culture']",I Vitelloni

That it somehow becomes more than the sum of its parts is quietly magical in its own way, and the amiably dry narration linking the events and non-events underlines the ebb and flow of the film nicely.
