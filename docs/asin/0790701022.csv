85447,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,0790701022,683,"[1, 1]","Stanley Kubrick is my 2nd favorite director (1st is Alfred Hitchcock), and his direction in ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the reasons why I consider him the greatest American director of all time. This film is filled with mind-bending and twisted images, and when the movie ends, you'll be thinking about it afterwards, and maybe even for days, because it's just so unforgettable, with the direction, the acting, the music. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is truly a one-of-a-kind movie that I don't feel really fits in a single genre.""A Clockwork Orange"" takes place in a futuristic (and hyper-sexualized) London, where Alex DeLarge (played by Malcolm McDowell is a definitive role), and his 3 ""droogs"", Pete, Georgie, and Dim, go around beating and raping people; something they call ""the old ultra-violence"". Later on, his droogs betray him and leave him bleeding after one of them smashes a milk bottle in his face, and he gets taken by the police and incarcerated for 14 years. Later he becomes a volunteer for the Ludovico technique, a 2 week treatment where he is forced to be subjected to ultra-violent movies, which make him physically ill from anything violent or sexual after the 2 weeks, when he is cured. He is later beaten up by multiple people whom he beat up after he is released.The first 15-30 minutes are filled with disturbing and sexual images, but they're all important to the rest of the film. It's filled with quick editing, a great use of color, long shots, sped-up/slowed-down scenes, and the result is a film that can hold up for decades and decades from now, because everything is unique. The direction from Stanley Kubrick, the acting, especially from Malcolm McDowell, the electronic and classical music composed by Wendy Carlos, and, of course, Beethoven, the thought-provoking messages, and just about everything else. While ""A Clockwork Orange"" isn't my favorite Kubrick movie, it's definitely one of my favorites.This DVD for ""A Clockwork Orange"" isn't bad either, but other than production notes and the original theatrical trailer, there's nothing else on it, even though it's still very good.",5,"""I was cured, all right!""",1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2119,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2nd', 'favorite', 'director', '1st', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'direction', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'consider', 'greatest', 'American', 'director', 'time', 'film', 'filled', 'mind-bending', 'twisted', 'images', 'when', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'afterwards', 'maybe', 'even', 'days', 'just', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'direction', 'acting', 'music', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'truly', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'fits', 'single', 'genre', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'place', 'futuristic', 'hyper-sexualized', 'London', 'where', 'Alex', 'DeLarge', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'definitive', 'role', '3', 'droogs', 'Pete', 'Georgie', 'Dim', 'go', 'beating', 'raping', 'people', 'something', 'call', 'old', 'ultra-violence', 'Later', 'droogs', 'betray', 'leave', 'bleeding', 'one', 'milk', 'bottle', 'face', 'taken', 'police', 'incarcerated', '14', 'years', 'Later', 'volunteer', 'Ludovico', 'technique', '2', 'week', 'treatment', 'where', 'forced', 'be', 'subjected', 'ultra-violent', 'movies', 'make', 'physically', 'ill', 'anything', 'violent', 'sexual', '2', 'weeks', 'when', 'cured', 'later', 'beaten', 'up', 'multiple', 'people', 'whom', 'beat', 'up', 'released.The', 'first', '15-30', 'minutes', 'are', 'filled', 'disturbing', 'sexual', 'images', ""'re"", 'important', 'rest', 'film', 'filled', 'quick', 'editing', 'great', 'use', 'color', 'long', 'shots', 'sped-up/slowed-down', 'scenes', 'result', 'film', 'can', 'hold', 'up', 'decades', 'decades', 'now', 'everything', 'unique', 'direction', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'acting', 'especially', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'electronic', 'classical', 'music', 'composed', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'course', 'Beethoven', 'thought-provoking', 'messages', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorites.This', 'DVD', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'other', 'production', 'notes', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'nothing', 'else', 'even', 'still', 'very', 'good']",N/A

it understandable.example:i had a pain in me ol gulliver or head you know?gulliver means head.theres alex and his 3 droogs who go out at night and get into felonious mischief errrrrrr i mean a bit of the old ultra-violence.i mean they gang rape a chick and force her husband to watch,play hogs of the road where they drive up the wrong side of the road to make people crash and all sorts of stuff like that.then they stop by the korova milk bar..............youll love this place...................and get some milk plus.plus what?synthamesc or drencrom or velloceet..........drugs!it is not,i repeat not,for kids.theres nudity in all sorts,rape,violence with beethoven playing,naked jesus figurines.................it never stops.anyhow,the main character eventualy is thrown in jail.they want to try a new technique on him that makes him become physicaly wracked with pains at the very thought of being bad.this includes fighting,illicit sex,raising his hand in anger,defending himself,you name it.the director is stanley kubrik.this is his masterpiece!thats saying a lot since hes also cooked up such classics as spartacus,lolita,2001;a space odyssey,the shining,full metal jacket and eyes wide shut.it looks low budget but everything in the 70s does to me.a lot of people are turned away by the rape scene and shows of nudity going further than full frontal.then again some people are heterosexual and like seeing naked chicks.there are a couple places where id say there is lewd things going on,but they are brief.the main character alex was portrayed extremely well.his buddies-droogs are petie,georgie and dim-dim being really dim.hes not all that well played out but is light years ahead of his time since now its commonplace to have a unbelivably stupid character in every show and movie.it is pretty well consistent with the book.the book is far better and way worse.and since the book is longer,i will let the cat out of the bag.the movie and in u.s. print,end with alex laughing about getting released.the book in england and many other countries has a lost chapter where he also grows up and reforms for real.the part where the shrinks are making hi m incapable of bad involves them showing him very graphic violence and forcing him too watch.this mixed with thier meds makes for a very intense scene.one show he viddies is even aconcentration camp scene with beethoven playing in the background.kubrik is to film what mozart was to music or the beatles to rock or hendrix to guitar.this is his best work!",5,the second best movie ever.,1096675200,"10 2,

Thirty years after its initial release, it still holds up well and is the ultimate dystopia on film. Through its nightmarish view of a world where crime and chaos appear unstoppable to its equally nightmarish view of humanity in general, this film packs so much information on the human condition and our present day society that it is possible to feel like you are drinking from a garden hose, as there is so much being thrown at you at once that it is simply impossible to appreciate all of it.The story opens up showing Alex, the protagonist played by Malcolm McDowell, and his three droogs, or gang members. Initially we see them performing all kinds of ""ultraviolence"" and rape. Then, later, when Alex becomes angry with his droogs and punishes two of them, they turn on him and leave him for the police. Placed in a bleak prison, he hears of a new treatment that will get him out of prison in a matter of weeks. He enthusiastically signs up, but he soon finds out that this treatment will make him physically sick at the sight of violence, sex and even upon hearing his beloved Beethoven. Released back into society, he soon becomes the victim as that timeless human truism, whatever goes around comes around, is proven correct.There are so many themes and aspects of the human condition explored here that it is simply impossible to list them. Just a few are the innate moral condition of man, generally, the criminal mind, victims of crime, media exploitation, the old versus the young, and what happens when the ethics are pushed aside in favor of expediency or safety. All this being said, it is not a film for everyone. There is a lot of violence, sex, and nudity, so prudes need not apply. Certainly if you enjoy films where every question is answered and solutions to all of the problems are easy to find, this is not for you either. A Clockwork Orange raises many issues and also answers them, although you will have to watch closely to find them.Finally, the technical side. Malcolm McDowell does a fantastic job playing malevolent Alex, grasping the nuance and contradiction that make him tick. Kubrick is perfectly in tune with Burgess' novel, able to add touches that perfectly complement the book. He makes the story his own without compromising what made the book so good. Excellent score and cinematography make it seem as if you are there with Alex.If you are looking to see a film that examines the human condition without embellishing at all, gritty in the truest sense, you cannot go wrong with this movie.

But recently my nephew Ronald and I sat down and watched it together he is a 16 year old male and for some reason he was unfased by he images so i ran out and brought the novel for him to read since it may spark a more clearer image of horror in his imagination but alas he laughed the thre film and the novel and that made me watch the film again and realize the true genuis behind it. Kubrick used classical music the music of beauty and intellect to propell a barbaric act of violence but violence isn't barbaric at all it is what keeps the world moving and is the driving force behind human nature.

85458,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,0790701022,Alejandro Cortes,"[5, 6]","One of the biggest complaints about ""A Clockwork Orange"", is the use of excessive violence. It's a shame, but let's face it: the violence is part of the human nature, it's an ugly side of our behavior, but it's useless to pretend that someone can't have violent thoughts once in a while. So I recommend to all those people that blame movies (like ""A Clockwork Orange"") for the violence all around the world, please read any Universal History book. Perhaps you might realize that the human race has a violent side by nature: wars, territorial invasions, betrayals, you name it, violence was here before the movies. ""A Clockwork Orange"" explores the violent side of the human being.""A Clockwork Orange"" shows the dark side of our nature, and the attempts made by the society to repress that dark side through the excessive control of the individuals. The main character, Alex (Malcolm McDowell, in a very charismatic performance) is a young man that enjoys life, but with violence and excesses. Usually, a character like Alex would be hated by the audience, but our antihero is so human, with so many sides, attitudes and personalities, that without a doubt he is an excellent example of the complexity of the human being.One of the readings of ""A Clockwork Orange"" is: every person has a negative side and a positive side, everybody. Throughout the movie, we see that Alex is more than a bully, he is a person with all the flaws, needs and suffering, proper of the human being. Also, in ""A Clockwork Orange"", we can see that all our actions will have consequences, no matter if we act right or wrong. Alex acts wrong, but he also pays a high price in the movie.One of the strongest highlights in ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the masterful use of music to improve the scenes. Music by Beethoven, Rossini, Walter Carlos and, oh yeah, a disturbing version of ""Singing In The Rain"", helped to create some of the most memorable scenes in film history.""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most important films of all time, in most of film critics ""100 best movies of all-time"" lists, we can read the name ""A Clockwork Orange"", proof of the transcendence of the movie. It's also the best movie made by Stanley Kubrick (in my humble opinion). It has a little of everything: action, comedy, satire, drama, excellent music, very creative dialogues, a very charismatic central character, and oh yeah, something that may confuse people that enjoy movies with MTV pace and one page scripts: A PLOT. If you can't notice the excellent portrait of the complexity of the human being in this film, I recommend you to try ""American Pie"", ""Ernest Goes To Jail"" or ""Gigli"".

If nothing else, Kubrick was a masterful stylist with a wonderful eye for composition and detail.  Wildly controversial when it debuted, the film continues to spark heated debate, even among Kubrick admirers.  Clockwork Orange was condemned for its graphic depiction of senseless violence, but screen violence of this sort is common today.  There are two reasons why this chilling masterpiece still has the power to unnerve audiences; the first reason has to do with Alex, the protagonist, the second with the broader implications of the movie's snarling social satire.Alex is not your garden-variety thug.  He adores Beethoven, he's intelligent, articulate, and capable of being charming.  More to the point, we don't get the sense that his pathology is the result of a wretched childhood or societal abuse - he simply delights in violence and cruelty, they make him happy.  The unforgettable ""Singin' In The Rain"" scene makes this point most emphatically, and tragically.  In this regard, Alex (played masterfully by Malcolm McDowell), is less a symbol of modern society than of man's inherently violent nature, celebrated every day around the world both directly and indirectly through innumerable well-respected rituals.  In short, Alex is especially horrifying because he is, if not likable, certainly familiar.The second is the allegorical nature of the film.  (Viewers determined to critique the movie literally are reminded that Alex has his own language.  The headline of this review, translated from Alex-speak, would read Great Story, No Apology.) Especially in the Burgess novel, but also here, we are invited to consider the moral consequences of a society's decision to use brainwashing and torture as a means of curing its violence-management problem.  Kubrick makes it easy to spot this ethical dilemma by having some of the droogs turn up in police uniforms, thus inviting the question, how does one tell the criminals from the good guys without a score card?Years after its release, Clockwork Orange holds its own.  As entertainment it is tough sledding but fascinating.  As art it is triumphant.  In art we look not for answers but for the right questions.  Clockwork Orange shines a very bright light on some fascinating and fundamental moral mysteries that go right to the heart of being human - brilliant then, brilliant now.

Their hobbies include listening to Beethoven, drinking drug-laced milk, trying to run cars off the road, beating up bums, beating up other gang members, and breaking into people's homes to rape the women while singing ""Singing in the Rain."" In this crime-ridden, nihilistic future, the British government is willing to try an unorthodox technique to purge violent tendencies out of their criminals. Alex volunteers for this technique after being caught for murder, eager to claim the promise that he will be cured and free within two weeks. But it does something to him that he didn't expect, and the viewer wonders whether the cure is worse than the disease.This is a shockingly violent, graphic film, even by today's standards--but one wonders how much moreso in 1971. The scenes of attempted and successful rape nearly earned the film an X-rating in its day, and the sheer brutality and meaninglessness of Alex's violence is hard even for post-Columbine, post-inner city, and post-9/11 audiences to watch. (Moreover, it's even less violent than the book on which it's based!) He is the narrator, however, and his carefree, nonchalant attitude manages to grip the viewer nonetheless, though the viewer initially despises the scoundrel, until the terrible treatment he undergoes takes its toll. Kubrick's satire of government social engineering is brilliant, letting neither the hoodlums nor the meddling scientists off the hook for trying to scientifically fix what is really a spiritual problem (as the ineffectual presence and protests of an Anglican priest shows): violence and sin is inherent in the human condition. No treatment can really get rid of it, but a spiritual answer isn't really welcome in the day and age portrayed in the film, which seems like a near-future as imagined in 1971. (The set designs and synthesizer music are the most dated aspects, though the latter is still ominous and eerie all these decades later. Kudos to Walter/Wendy Carlos. Also, Kubrick will never let you listen to the William Tell Overture, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, or Rossini's ""The Thieving Magpie"" the same way again . . . ) The startling juxtapositions of monstrous ""modern"" design, nihilistic violence set to classical music, and youthful joy with the suffering of others, make this one of Kubrick's most memorable films.

85472,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,0790701022,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","Justly regarded as a landmark film, this disturbing and violent movie by Stanley Kubrick - stunningly filmed and still shocking after forty years - has been so talked about and overanalyzed that there is probably not much more to say. But let me add a few thoughts about A Clockwork Orange, after having recently seen it again after perhaps some twenty years.First, the movie has three clear and differentiated acts. In the first act, we see Alex and his gang commit outrageous acts of violence, rape and eventually murder against helpless citizens in a futuristic London. In the second act, Alex is caught and sent to prison, where he is ""cured"" through an aversion method called the Ludovico technique (involving basically the infliction of pain and nausea on Alex when he is forced to see violent acts in a movie). The third act sees Alex being rereleased into society, supposedly cured, but he will find it impossible to reintegrate himself to society. If the first act is a clear masterpiece (perhaps the best thing that Kubrick ever made), and the second act is very powerful, the third act I found wanting. It's as if Kubrick (or for that matter, author Anthony Burgess) wasn't very sure about how to wrap the story or what particular message he wanted to give forward.Lastly, and about the message of the film, there has been some debate on whether this is a right wing (conservative) film or is it a left wing (liberal) film. My feeling is that it cannot be put safely in any of the two categories. Kubrick was too idiosyncratic a director to be put into a neat ideological label. Thus, while the movie's radical critique of contemporary western society might put it in the left category, its skepticism that criminals can be ""cured"", can be seen as a conservative position. Also conservative might be its skepticism about whether any government bureaucracy can have good intentions toward the people.",4,"Landmark, even if not perfect, film",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,1910,"['Justly', 'regarded', 'landmark', 'film', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'stunningly', 'filmed', 'still', 'shocking', 'forty', 'years', 'been', 'so', 'talked', 'overanalyzed', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'let', 'add', 'few', 'thoughts', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'having', 'recently', 'seen', 'again', 'perhaps', 'twenty', 'years.First', 'movie', 'three', 'clear', 'differentiated', 'acts', 'first', 'act', 'see', 'Alex', 'gang', 'commit', 'outrageous', 'acts', 'violence', 'rape', 'eventually', 'murder', 'helpless', 'citizens', 'futuristic', 'London', 'second', 'act', 'Alex', 'caught', 'sent', 'prison', 'where', 'cured', 'aversion', 'method', 'called', 'Ludovico', 'technique', 'involving', 'basically', 'infliction', 'pain', 'nausea', 'Alex', 'when', 'forced', 'see', 'violent', 'acts', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'Alex', 'being', 'rereleased', 'society', 'supposedly', 'cured', 'will', 'find', 'impossible', 'reintegrate', 'society', 'first', 'act', 'clear', 'masterpiece', 'perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'Kubrick', 'ever', 'made', 'second', 'act', 'very', 'powerful', 'third', 'act', 'found', 'wanting', 'Kubrick', 'matter', 'author', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'sure', 'how', 'wrap', 'story', 'what', 'particular', 'message', 'wanted', 'give', 'forward.Lastly', 'message', 'film', 'been', 'debate', 'right', 'wing', 'conservative', 'film', 'left', 'wing', 'liberal', 'film', 'feeling', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'safely', 'two', 'categories', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'too', 'idiosyncratic', 'director', 'be', 'put', 'neat', 'ideological', 'label', 'Thus', 'movie', 'radical', 'critique', 'contemporary', 'western', 'society', 'might', 'put', 'left', 'category', 'skepticism', 'criminals', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'conservative', 'position', 'Also', 'conservative', 'might', 'be', 'skepticism', 'government', 'bureaucracy', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'people']",N/A
85473,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790701022,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","`A Clockwork Orange', in novel form, is one of the most important pieces of literature and should be read by everyone in my humble opinion.  I had never seen the film but had embraced the novel head on and respect it in its entirety.  My best friend told me that I had to see the film if I loved the novel so much.  He had seen it numerous times and just knew that it would interest me.  So I finally buckled down and rented this film and dare I say that it is one of the best motion pictures to ever be released.  For a film of the 70's it barely seems dated for the acting is top notch and the direction by Kubrick may very well be his finest.  Kubrick faithfully adapted Anthony Burgess' classic novel with fervor and fearlessness, not shying away from the darkness that clouded the pages.Let it be known that `A Clockwork Orange' is not a film for everyone, but it is a film that everyone should see.  I don't know if that makes perfect sense so let me see if I can explain.  In my humble opinion `A Clockwork Orange' delves into some of the most intricate workings of mankind.  It fleshes out the demons, the innate desire to have total control and it asks the questions that we do well to ask ourselves with regard to crime and punishment, vengeance and mercy.  In this respect it is an important film that begs to be lauded and respected.  In do this though is breaches dark territory and at times is both vulgar and explicit.  It is shocking, even with its age, and can at times even repel the audience.  Nothing is glorified, in fact it is extremely detestable and looked down upon, but it is visually included and very much a large part of the film.  In that respect not everyone can handle a film of this nature.The film (as does the novel) centers around a young man by the name of Alex.  Alex is, for lack of a better word, a gang member.  He walks the streets at night with his friends making trouble, stealing, pillaging, assaulting...killing.  Alex though has a bit of a power issue and this incessant need to be the ringleader puts him at odds with his fellow `droogs', Pete, Georgie and Dim.  When Alex is arrested and incarcerated he begins to see the folly of his ways.  Whether or not this `transformation' is real or merely an attempt at freedom is left up to the viewer in this instance (I'll get back to this point in a minute) but the `transformation', real or fake, is there and this prompts Alex to volunteer for a new government procedure supposedly able to cure him of his sick and twisted tendencies.My one disappointment with the film is one I saw coming.  The film was adapted from the originally released version of the novel.  So, the film, much like that novel, is unfinished, incomplete...wrong.  Anthony Burgess had written one final chapter, a controversial chapter that was omitted in order to boost sales by the publishing house.  This final chapter takes the novel to a whole new level and would have taken the film there too.  It would help make things clearer to the audience and help him or her become more in tune with Alex himself.  The ambiguity of Alex's `transformation' is one area that would have been crystal clear had the final chapter been part of the adaptation.  I won't say any more in this regard (read the novel, now released with the final chapter).Regardless though, the film is brilliant.  Aided by the powerhouse (and Oscar snubbed) performance by Malcolm McDowell, who masterfully captures Alex from his outward swagger to his emotional impotence, `A Clockwork Orange' delivers on each and every front.  Stanley Kubrick was a master of film and this is no exception.  This may very well be his finest film, but that is up to each and every one of us to decide for ourselves.",5,A visionary masterpiece that challenges the viewer in more ways than one...,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,3738,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', 'novel', 'form', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'pieces', 'literature', 'should', 'be', 'read', 'everyone', 'humble', 'opinion', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'embraced', 'novel', 'head', 'respect', 'entirety', 'best', 'friend', 'told', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'loved', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'seen', 'numerous', 'times', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'interest', 'So', 'finally', 'buckled', 'down', 'rented', 'film', 'dare', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'motion', 'pictures', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'film', '70', 'barely', 'dated', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'direction', 'Kubrick', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'Kubrick', 'faithfully', 'adapted', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'classic', 'novel', 'fervor', 'fearlessness', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'darkness', 'clouded', 'pages.Let', 'be', 'known', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perfect', 'sense', 'so', 'let', 'see', 'can', 'explain', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'delves', 'most', 'intricate', 'workings', 'mankind', 'out', 'demons', 'innate', 'desire', 'have', 'total', 'control', 'questions', 'do', 'well', 'ask', 'regard', 'crime', 'punishment', 'vengeance', 'mercy', 'respect', 'important', 'film', 'be', 'lauded', 'respected', 'do', 'though', 'breaches', 'dark', 'territory', 'times', 'vulgar', 'explicit', 'shocking', 'even', 'age', 'can', 'times', 'even', 'repel', 'audience', 'Nothing', 'glorified', 'fact', 'extremely', 'detestable', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'visually', 'included', 'very', 'much', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'respect', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'handle', 'film', 'nature.The', 'film', 'novel', 'centers', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'gang', 'member', 'streets', 'night', 'friends', 'making', 'trouble', 'stealing', 'pillaging', 'assaulting', 'killing', 'Alex', 'bit', 'power', 'issue', 'incessant', 'need', 'be', 'ringleader', 'odds', 'fellow', 'droogs', 'Pete', 'Georgie', 'Dim', 'When', 'Alex', 'arrested', 'incarcerated', 'see', 'folly', 'ways', 'Whether', 'not', 'transformation', 'real', 'merely', 'attempt', 'freedom', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'instance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'point', 'minute', 'transformation', 'real', 'fake', 'there', 'Alex', 'volunteer', 'new', 'government', 'procedure', 'supposedly', 'able', 'cure', 'sick', 'twisted', 'tendencies.My', 'one', 'disappointment', 'film', 'one', 'saw', 'coming', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'originally', 'released', 'version', 'novel', 'So', 'film', 'much', 'novel', 'unfinished', 'incomplete', 'wrong', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'had', 'written', 'one', 'final', 'chapter', 'controversial', 'chapter', 'was', 'omitted', 'order', 'boost', 'sales', 'publishing', 'house', 'final', 'chapter', 'novel', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'there', 'too', 'would', 'help', 'make', 'things', 'clearer', 'audience', 'help', 'become', 'more', 'tune', 'Alex', 'ambiguity', 'Alex', 'transformation', 'one', 'area', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'crystal', 'clear', 'had', 'final', 'chapter', 'been', 'part', 'adaptation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'regard', 'read', 'novel', 'now', 'released', 'final', 'chapter', '.Regardless', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Aided', 'powerhouse', 'Oscar', 'snubbed', 'performance', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'masterfully', 'Alex', 'outward', 'swagger', 'emotional', 'impotence', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'delivers', 'front', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'master', 'film', 'exception', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'film', 'up', 'one', 'decide']",N/A

85480,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,0790701022,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[5, 5]","Stanley Kubrick, one of the legendary directors, is also the easiest to misunderstand, I think. His movies range in genre but generally follow his usual oddball style, and many find this style unsavory, even me. In fact, many of his movies, especially his newer ones, I have no care for. But to me, his three greatest films are some of the best ever. Those films are The Shining, Full-Metal Jacket, and this, A Clockwork Orange, which I think is his greatest.The story of Clockwork follows a young hoodlum named Alex as he goes about his days beating and raping people, bullying his friends, and drinking drug-laced milk. But when he goes too far and accidentally kills someone, things take the expected turn and he ends up getting caught by the police. After spending some time in prison, Alex gets word of an experimental new rehabilitation program, one that guarantees him a chance to get out of prison within two short weeks. He doesn't realize, however, what this treatment entails, believing only that it's his chance to get out or prison and back to his old life. And so begins the rehabilitation of Alex, and when released fourteen days later, he's a new man incapable of doing violence, having sex, or even listening to the Beethoven's Ninth.What drives this movie is easily the character of Alex, a kind of an amoral Peter Pan of sorts, a boy who doesn't want to grow up, locked in a world of ultra-violence that he rules without exception. He's intelligent and manipulative to the point of genius. He's fun-loving, singing and dancing while dishing out pain and torment. Yet, though we should hate this anti-hero, he's just so damn easy to cheer for, especially during the early moments, which are as shocking as they are exciting.I will say that A Clockwork Orange, like 2001, has the capability of being misunderstood, and could easily be considered Kubrick's worst film. It's a movie that takes a certain amount of stomach to withstand, because it places an emphasis on torture, full body nudity, and desensitized youth, and attempts to disturb the viewer constantly. But, even if you think this movie is bad, you can't help but realize that it's at least unique. No movie has ever been made like this, and it's been thirty-five years since its original release. If you haven't seen this movie, pick it up, especially if you are a fan of gory horror movies, apocalyptic sc-fi films, or adult Japanese anime, as all of these types of movies share some of the themes of A Clockwork Orange.",5,Kubrick's Best,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2501,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'one', 'legendary', 'directors', 'also', 'easiest', 'misunderstand', 'think', 'movies', 'range', 'genre', 'generally', 'follow', 'usual', 'oddball', 'style', 'many', 'find', 'style', 'unsavory', 'even', 'fact', 'many', 'movies', 'especially', 'newer', 'ones', 'have', 'care', 'three', 'greatest', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'ever', 'films', 'are', 'Shining', 'Full-Metal', 'Jacket', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'think', 'greatest.The', 'story', 'Clockwork', 'young', 'hoodlum', 'named', 'Alex', 'days', 'beating', 'raping', 'people', 'bullying', 'friends', 'drinking', 'drug-laced', 'milk', 'when', 'too', 'far', 'accidentally', 'kills', 'someone', 'things', 'take', 'expected', 'turn', 'up', 'getting', 'caught', 'police', 'spending', 'time', 'prison', 'Alex', 'word', 'experimental', 'new', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'one', 'chance', 'get', 'prison', 'two', 'short', 'weeks', ""n't"", 'realize', 'however', 'what', 'treatment', 'believing', 'only', 'chance', 'get', 'out', 'prison', 'back', 'old', 'life', 'so', 'rehabilitation', 'Alex', 'when', 'released', 'fourteen', 'days', 'later', 'new', 'man', 'incapable', 'doing', 'violence', 'having', 'sex', 'even', 'listening', 'Beethoven', 'Ninth.What', 'movie', 'easily', 'character', 'Alex', 'kind', 'amoral', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'sorts', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'locked', 'world', 'ultra-violence', 'rules', 'exception', 'intelligent', 'manipulative', 'point', 'genius', 'fun-loving', 'singing', 'dancing', 'dishing', 'out', 'pain', 'torment', 'should', 'hate', 'anti-hero', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'easy', 'cheer', 'especially', 'early', 'moments', 'are', 'as', 'shocking', 'are', 'exciting.I', 'will', 'say', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '2001', 'capability', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'Kubrick', 'worst', 'film', 'movie', 'certain', 'amount', 'stomach', 'withstand', 'emphasis', 'torture', 'full', 'body', 'nudity', 'desensitized', 'youth', 'attempts', 'disturb', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'even', 'think', 'movie', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'realize', 'least', 'unique', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'been', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'original', 'release', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'gory', 'horror', 'movies', 'apocalyptic', 'sc-fi', 'films', 'adult', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'types', 'movies', 'share', 'themes', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange']",N/A

85487,A2582KMXLK2P06,0790701022,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","A Clockwork Orange is the kind of film that, upon reviewed, many of these reviews often get criticized for either missing the point, or not entirely understanding what the movie writers were going for during its creation.I'm just another person with an opinion, but the way *I* interpreted the storyline is like this-A punk teenager from England is the leader of a gang, and he does some of the worst things imaginable.  He and his gang torture people while dancing around the room and singing, they rape women and feel no remorse whatsoever, and this gang of punks basically just continues to ruin peoples lives as they find new victims during their deplorable nightly journeys around the town.Some people view this film as a dark comedy, but I honestly fail to see any comedy elements whatsoever.  I don't think this is an example of another American who doesn't understand British humor either.  I just don't see how anything taking place is supposed to be funny.Oh sure, some of the sexual references have a bit of humor to them (such as the one gang member picking up a statue of a... mans thingy) but the thing is, if you look at the plot from an overall point of view, the main focus of the storyline is obviously NOT funny at all.  It's about an extremely serious matter and delivered in a twisted way.Let me put it another way- just because you witness a few scenes that could probably pass for comedy, it's really easy to dismiss these particular scenes since the main focus should definitely be on the shocking seriousness of the storyline.  Actually, considering the year this film was released, it wouldn't surprise me if those slightly humurous bits were included simply as a way to cover-up how disturbing this movie *really* could have been, had the writers been granted permission to go out and make it even more shocking.With that said, a Clockwork Orange is highly enjoyable because, for one thing, the first 20 minutes of film are VERY shocking considering the time period in which this film was created- the early 70's.  Not many films back then touched upon topics in *this* much brutal detail.I liked when the one gang member asked to be involved in a new experiment to figure out what triggers murderers and psychotics to go absolutely insane.  Without spoiling anything, the guy had to go through mental pain the likes of which most people wouldn't be able to handle, and well, by the time he was released, that mental pain quickly turned to physical.  You'll see what I mean by this.  Talk about VERY clever writing.  What goes around comes around is the moral of this storyline.Overall, the storyline holds up remarkably well, the acting is really good (though entirely British- be prepared for that) and it's easy to see the kind of reputation a Clockwork Orange has built over the years.",5,interesting film,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2816,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', 'kind', 'film', 'reviewed', 'many', 'reviews', 'often', 'get', 'criticized', 'missing', 'point', 'not', 'entirely', 'understanding', 'what', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'creation.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'person', 'opinion', 'way', '*I*', 'interpreted', 'storyline', 'this-A', 'punk', 'teenager', 'England', 'leader', 'gang', 'worst', 'things', 'imaginable', 'gang', 'torture', 'people', 'dancing', 'room', 'singing', 'rape', 'women', 'feel', 'remorse', 'whatsoever', 'gang', 'punks', 'basically', 'just', 'ruin', 'peoples', 'find', 'new', 'victims', 'deplorable', 'nightly', 'journeys', 'town.Some', 'people', 'view', 'film', 'dark', 'comedy', 'honestly', 'fail', 'see', 'comedy', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'example', 'American', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'British', 'humor', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anything', 'taking', 'place', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny.Oh', 'sure', 'sexual', 'references', 'have', 'bit', 'humor', 'such', 'one', 'gang', 'member', 'picking', 'up', 'statue', 'mans', 'thingy', 'thing', 'look', 'plot', 'overall', 'point', 'view', 'main', 'focus', 'storyline', 'obviously', 'NOT', 'funny', 'extremely', 'serious', 'matter', 'delivered', 'twisted', 'way.Let', 'put', 'way-', 'just', 'witness', 'few', 'scenes', 'could', 'probably', 'pass', 'comedy', 'really', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'particular', 'scenes', 'main', 'focus', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'shocking', 'seriousness', 'storyline', 'Actually', 'considering', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'slightly', 'humurous', 'bits', 'were', 'included', 'simply', 'way', 'cover-up', 'how', 'disturbing', 'movie', '*really*', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'writers', 'been', 'granted', 'permission', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'shocking.With', 'said', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'thing', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'VERY', 'shocking', 'considering', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'was', 'created-', 'early', '70', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'back', 'then', 'touched', 'topics', '*this*', 'much', 'brutal', 'detail.I', 'liked', 'when', 'one', 'gang', 'member', 'asked', 'be', 'involved', 'new', 'experiment', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'murderers', 'psychotics', 'go', 'absolutely', 'insane', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'guy', 'had', 'go', 'mental', 'pain', 'likes', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'well', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'mental', 'pain', 'quickly', 'turned', 'physical', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Talk', 'VERY', 'clever', 'writing', 'What', 'around', 'around', 'moral', 'storyline.Overall', 'storyline', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'entirely', 'British-', 'be', 'prepared', 'easy', 'see', 'kind', 'reputation', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'built', 'years']",N/A

With Malcolm McDowell as Alex, the monstrous yet charismatic leader of the gang (in an inspired piece of casting), and working directly from Burgess' book, Kubrick literally wrote the screenplay as he filmed, toning down the Russian/English slang of the characters, and stylizing the extreme violence and sexual abuse into a visual ballet, orchestrated to ""Singing in the Rain"", and Walter Carlo's electronic adaptations of classical music. The end result was staggering, an astonishing mix of black humor, social satire, and irreverence that literally rocked the film world, and turned him into a pariah in Great Britain, where Alex's nonconformity and allure proved so attractive that 'copy-cat' crimes based on the film sprang up. When Kubrick's life and the lives of his family were threatened, in an unprecedented move, he convinced Warner Brothers to pull the film from distribution in England, where it remained 'banned' until his death.While 'no frills' editions of the film have been available in the U.S. for a number of years, this new release truly explores the creative process involved, through the optional commentary track, and in the second disc, offering two 'making of' featurettes, with observations by Kubrick's family, McDowell, the production staff, and some of today's best-known directors. As Kubrick himself never spoke publicly about his work, these insights are a revelation into the mind of a master filmmaker. Also on the second disc is a marvelous bio-documentary of Malcolm McDowell (""O Lucky Malcolm!""), brilliant and as wickedly funny as the man, himself.""A Clockwork Orange"" was a film far ahead of it's time, disturbing and incomprehensible for many 1972 audiences; today, in our climate of violence, terrorism, sexually-oriented crimes, and loss of personal freedom, it seems remarkably timely.

85496,A20IIR0422G3A5,0790701022,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 4]","`Clockwork Orange', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on an important short novel by Anthony Burgess has the misfortune of being the movie Kubrick made after `2001'. I still remember having skipped out of work to see the movie on the very first afternoon it opened in local Baltimore theaters. I had read the novel and seen the previews many times over, so I was well primed for what I was about to see.My first reaction was that I was missing something. There were pieces of the movie which were truly masterful, especially Malcolm MacDowell's career defining role as the principle bad boy. The use of music was similarly well up to Kubrick's usually excellent use of borrowed music. The application of `Singin' in the Rain' alone was almost worth the price of admission. But somehow, neither the narrative nor the visual context seemed to hang together quite as well as Kubrick's earlier movies.In retrospect, this may not be too surprising, as `Full Metal Jacket', for example, has famously been described as half of a great movie and half of a good movie, with logical, but not entirely aesthetic connection between the two parts.Similarly, `Clockwork Orange' breaks down into at least three acts, where our `hero' Alex (MacDowell) is the quintessential bad boy, the tamed wimp, and the restored nasty Marker. Along the way, Kubrick does great things with ambient lighting, which makes this movie important from the cinematic point of view, but contributes only a marginal value to the overall audience experience.Part of my feeling of loss may be the fact that given the limited amount of screen dialogue in comparison to the dialogue in the book, Kubrick could not fully exploit Burgess' invented slang, which was a cross between Cockney and Russian words. This kind of wordplay is great for the cognoscenti, but it tends to leave the average audience scratching their heads trying to figure out what the characters are saying, without the benefit of a slang dictionary at the back of the book.Among all of Kubrick's works, this may be the least fondly remembered, because it had left no indelible quote in our minds like Slim Pickins' bomb ride, Hal's goodby to his human colleagues, Jack Nicholson's `Here's Johnny!', `Full Metal Jacket's `thousand yard stare',  and Sue Lyons' `Lolita'. `Eyes Wide Shut' and `Barry Lyndon' may be equally anonymous, but expectations for those films, I think was simply not as high as for `Clockwork Orange'.And yet, this movie is still better than 9/10 of all other movies ever made, and deserves an important place in our history of film. If for no other reason than it stands with `Bonnie and Clyde' as an exercize in the use of violence in film which is done to good cinematic effect rather than for pure gratuitous thrills.My biggest regret is that Herr Kubrick is no longer with us to give us comment tracks on his movies to give us some insights into his aesthetic.",5,Cinematicly brilliant.

They beat up other gangs, and in an especially vile moment, they beat an elderly man and rape his wife. To make a long story short, Alex has a falling out with his friends, and Alex is arrested.This is when things start to get interesting. Certainly, Alex's actions were not to be admired. But gradually, we see that the people around him, and even the ones in the system are not so likable or admirable either. (A counselor is a pervert; the prison workers seem more interested in vengeance than justice; one prison worker seems to be a spin off of Adolf Hitler; the list goes on and on.)Alex hears about a method designed for getting people out of prison early, and making sure they never go back. (It basically makes the patient incapable of making the choice to act on sexual or violent impulses.)  The prison Chaplain seems to be the only voice of reason when he says: ""When a man can not choose, he ceases to be a man."" But Alex gets his way.All seems well, and Alex gets released from prison early. But things are not so well on the outside. His parents rented his room out, and there is really nowhere for Alex to go. From this moment on, the director does NOT allow our newly won sympathy for Alex to slack for a moment. It does in fact intensify. Alex's former victims see him and take their opportunity for revenge, and because of the treatment, Alex can't protect himself. To make matters worse, Alex runs into his former friends who have now become cops. (And should we be surprised? This does seem to keep with the movie's intentions.) But the worst is yet to come.It is interesting how the government appears to want to help Alex towards the end, but with just a bit of thought, we can see that helping Alex only seems to go along with their hopes of getting reelected. McDowell does in fact 'get cured.' But how different is the end of the movie from the start now? If anything, McDowell has more material to blackmail the government with now.Not only is this movie a masterpiece on social awareness, but the soundtrack is great too.

It seems that the viewership of this film either loves it or loathes it.  Some (I among them) salivate over Kubrick's complete mastery of the film medium while others want to burn the film as morally dubious at best and repugnant at worst.  The criticisms I hear most often leveled at the film concern the fact that Kubrick has us sympathizing with a young punk whose favorite pasttime is violence (any kind, including beatings, rapings, bludgeonings and stabbings).I do agree that we sympathize with Alex, the film's main character, but I disagree that this is to the film's detriment.  The movie, like the book on which it is based, is told essentially in first person. Alex narrates the film, and we never see an event occur that Alex himself is not present to witness.  Even the mise-en-scene of the film (the distorted angles, stylized sets, use of slow and fast motion, etc.) lend the film a subjectivity and reminds the audience that it is seeing events unfold through a perspective other than its own.I think anyone with a shred of humanity will sympathize with Alex; I think that's the movie's point.  Alex treats others as if they are animals, and we are repelled by it.  Then, when the state treats him as if he is just another animal, why should we not be just as repelled?  In some ways, the questions this film poses can have practial applications to the ongoing debate over the death penalty.  Does recoiling at the idea of putting someone to death mean that we condone the crimes he or she comitted to have that sentence brought against them in the first place?I want to save my last comment for Malcolm McDowell's unimprovable performance.  I can't imagine anyone playing Alex better than he does.  He's got the perfect blend of charm, charisma and menace that this character needs.  His performance is comedic and scary at the same time.  It's a shame that he didn't receive more recognition for this film when it was released.Grade: A",5,33 Years Old and Still Going Strong,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,2023,"['quot', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'quot', 'never', 'polarize', 'audience', 'viewership', 'film', 'salivate', 'Kubrick', 'complete', 'mastery', 'film', 'medium', 'others', 'want', 'burn', 'film', 'morally', 'dubious', 'best', 'repugnant', 'worst', 'criticisms', 'hear', 'most', 'often', 'leveled', 'film', 'concern', 'fact', 'Kubrick', 'sympathizing', 'young', 'punk', 'favorite', 'pasttime', 'violence', 'kind', 'including', 'beatings', 'rapings', 'bludgeonings', 'stabbings', '.I', 'do', 'agree', 'sympathize', 'Alex', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'disagree', 'film', 'detriment', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'told', 'essentially', 'first', 'person', 'Alex', 'film', 'never', 'see', 'event', 'occur', 'Alex', 'not', 'present', 'witness', 'Even', 'mise-en-scene', 'film', 'distorted', 'angles', 'stylized', 'sets', 'use', 'slow', 'fast', 'motion', 'etc', 'lend', 'film', 'subjectivity', 'audience', 'seeing', 'events', 'unfold', 'perspective', 'other', 'own.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'shred', 'humanity', 'will', 'sympathize', 'Alex', 'think', 'movie', 'point', 'Alex', 'others', 'are', 'animals', 'are', 'repelled', 'Then', 'when', 'state', 'just', 'animal', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'repelled', 'ways', 'questions', 'film', 'poses', 'can', 'have', 'practial', 'applications', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'death', 'penalty', 'recoiling', 'idea', 'putting', 'someone', 'death', 'mean', 'condone', 'crimes', 'comitted', 'have', 'sentence', 'brought', 'first', 'place', 'want', 'save', 'last', 'comment', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'unimprovable', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'playing', 'Alex', 'better', 'got', 'perfect', 'blend', 'charm', 'charisma', 'menace', 'character', 'performance', 'comedic', 'scary', 'same', 'time', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'more', 'recognition', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released.Grade']",N/A

So many of the noteworthy movies of the 70's (a great era for American cinema) have fallen by the cultural wayside. This is Kubrick's masterful  interpretation of Burgess' controversial, difficult brainchild. Burgess  envisioned a polyglot, dystopian future, an amalgam of Huxley, Golding,  Orwell and Mad Max. Kubrick took the raw bones of the narrative and  fashioned an entirely self-contained work of art. I couldn't get over, when  first viewing this film on a wide screed, upon its initial release, the  incredible clarity and crispness of the print. It was like seeing an  entirely new kind of movie. There was a bright, distinct aura to it, unlike  anything I've seen before or since. It has to be one of the most carefully  controlled and executed pieces of filmmaking ever executed. Every frame,  every bit of business, every prop, every line, is perfectly realized. I to  this day can't comprehend the kind of artistic rigor and planning that went  into creating this masterwork. There isn't a wasted shot or a throwaway  line in the entire film. It is perfectly sequential. It is the essence of  intelligence in combination with artistry.Many reviewers have  commented on Malcom McDowell's uncanny performance and I would agree that  he is brilliant as are all cast members. I would beg to differ that this  was his debut, however. If I am not mistaken, he had already starred in  Lindsay Anderson's potent portrait of youthful rebellion, &quot;If.&quot; I  notice, as an aside, that &quot;If&quot; is not listed on Amazon and I  wonder if that has anything to do with Littleton and other recent school  tragedies. The subject matter of that film has to do with a group of  students who go on a shooting rampage in an English public (US private)  school.I would love to see Clockwork Orange on a large screen again.

After being betrayed by his friends, Alex is caught by the police and incarcerated in a state prison, where he volunteers for an experimental new treatment in order to earn himself an early release. Here at the Ludovico Institute, he is subjected to hours of brainwashing images and conditioning that force a negative association with violence in his mind that is accompanied by a wrenching pain in his gut. Now free, he is a truly a changed man, but he re-enters a bitter society that is still riddled with violence, where he is beaten to the brink of death by those he had harmed in the past.Master craftsman Stanley Kubrick brings his own unique vision to the classic Anthony Burgess novel about free will and governmental control. This dystopian tale uses Alex and his droogs as extreme examples of youth in revolt, living without rule in an ambivalent society where teachers and family have all but given up on enforcing the law. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE paints the governing authorities in a mocking and contemptuous light, demonstrating their inadequacies through their dogmatic practices, failed social experiment, and loose hiring techniques.While the great Malcolm McDowell would go on to star in many other excellent films, it would be his role as Alex that would prove to be his most memorable and lasting performance. He plays beside an equally talented cast that each manage to extract the biting cynicism of the script and bring it to life on-screen. Kubrick's extraordinary use of color and expert filming techniques immediately juxtapose the graphic subject matter and violence, a trend that is heightened even further by the Classical music score that is intrinsically linked to Alex's character progression. The culmination of these various elements can be seen early on, when Alex and his gang terrorize an older couple in their home to the gleeful tune of ""Singin' in the Rain.""Nominated for no less than four Oscars (including Best Script and Best Director) and winner of countless other awards, Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is in a class all unto itself.

This work of art, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" is now available in an equally fantastic and historic Blu-ray 40th anniversary edition.The story takes place in a futuristic Britain, where we immediately meet Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang - Dim (Warren Clark), Pete (Michael Tam), and Georgie (James Marcus). These young men spend their time creating havoc in their city - stealing, raping, fighting... At one point - in an infamous classic scene --, they enter a well-to-do family's home, and rape the lady of the house, while Alex sang ""Singing in the rain."" Once they are done for the day, Alex would return home, an apartment, in which he lived with his parents. They either don't know about his escapades or just conveniently ignore them. Unfortunately, Alex was abusive as the gang's leader, and Dim, Pete, and Georgie resented the mistreatment. They truly began to hate him, and revenge would eventually come. It did, and the fellows did not wait for a second chance, making sure that Alex was captured by the police and accused of homicide. He was convicted for many years, and while in jail, he learned about an experimental rehabilitation method that ""gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get back in again.""  With the help of the Minister of Interior and the prison's priest, he eventually gets what he wants, and enters the medical facility for treatment. He doesn't realize it, but he is in for one hell of an experience.""A Clockwork Orange"" is powerful in every sense of the world. The scenes are brutal, yet absorbing; the soundtrack, especially the Beethoven' classics, is captivating; and the cinematography grandiose. The futuristic sets, as well as the production design in general - including many phallic and erotic references and symbols -- are still amazing. The amazing two-disc 40th anniversary edition Blu-ray is loaded with extras, including the documentaries ""Malcolm McDowell looks back;"" ""Turning like Clockwork,"" about the film's violence; ""Great Bolshy Yarblockos!: Making of Clockwork Orange"" and more. In addition, there are commentaries by McDowell and historian Nick Redman, as well as the films ""Stanley Kubrick: A life in Pictures"" and ""O Lucky Malcolm"" (a profile of the actor). Furthermore, the set also includes a digital copy of the movie, and it all comes inside a precious 40-page book about the film.

Stanley Kubrick directed this, and if he ever goes to Film Hell for Eyes Wide Shut, this will more than make up for it, at least it will get him into purgatory.Anthony Burgess wrote this in response to hearing about some controversial techniques that were proposed as a solution to the problem of teen violence, specifically the Mod vs. Rocker battles that were also the subject of The Who's Quadraphenia.The book is written entirely in Nadsat, which is a slanguage invented by Burgess that contains Russian words, Gypsy argot, Cockney rhyming slang (where a word is substituted for another that rhymes with it, or is connected somehow to the rhyming word, so the original connection is lost and only another Cockney would understand the reference) and other teen age slang words all mixed together. A glossary is included, but soon you'll have no need for it.Malcolm McDowell does a great performance, though he is much older than 15, the supposed age of the Beethoven lovin' hooligan, Alex. He has a certain boyish charm, and the panache to carry it off.This film is a lot like V for Vendetta, in that it could work as an action film, or be enjoyed on a deeper level as a thought provoking essay on society, violence, and classical music. In both movies the cinematic violence is exhilarating, really good use of the music to enhance the excitement, and just an artistic stylized look that draws you in to the strange dystopia of the future.Some people will be put off by the violence, but it is not merely gratuitous, but essential to the story, and in fact, the subject at hand. You could say Oliver Stone fell into that trap in Natural Born Killers, trying to make a statement about how the media glorifies and exploits violence, and in so doing just glorifying and exploiting it even more, but Stanley Kubrick has dodged that bullet--at least he dodged it until Eyes Wide Shut.",5,"Masterpiece in Orange, and Malcolm McDowell in the Middle",1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2006,"['saw', 'were', '699', 'reviews', 'film', 'much', 'like', 'number', 'had', 'weigh', 'make', 'even', '700', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'directed', 'ever', 'Film', 'Hell', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'will', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'least', 'will', 'get', 'purgatory.Anthony', 'Burgess', 'wrote', 'response', 'hearing', 'controversial', 'techniques', 'were', 'proposed', 'solution', 'problem', 'teen', 'violence', 'specifically', 'Mod', 'vs.', 'Rocker', 'battles', 'were', 'also', 'subject', 'Who', 'Quadraphenia.The', 'book', 'written', 'entirely', 'Nadsat', 'slanguage', 'invented', 'Burgess', 'Russian', 'words', 'Gypsy', 'argot', 'Cockney', 'rhyming', 'slang', 'where', 'word', 'substituted', 'connected', 'somehow', 'rhyming', 'word', 'original', 'connection', 'lost', 'only', 'Cockney', 'would', 'understand', 'reference', 'other', 'teen', 'age', 'slang', 'words', 'mixed', 'together', 'glossary', 'included', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'need', 'it.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'great', 'performance', 'much', 'older', '15', 'supposed', 'age', 'Beethoven', 'lovin', 'hooligan', 'Alex', 'certain', 'boyish', 'charm', 'panache', 'carry', 'off.This', 'film', 'lot', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'could', 'work', 'action', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'deeper', 'level', 'thought', 'provoking', 'essay', 'society', 'violence', 'classical', 'music', 'movies', 'cinematic', 'violence', 'exhilarating', 'really', 'good', 'use', 'music', 'enhance', 'excitement', 'just', 'artistic', 'stylized', 'look', 'strange', 'dystopia', 'future.Some', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'violence', 'not', 'merely', 'gratuitous', 'essential', 'story', 'fact', 'subject', 'hand', 'could', 'say', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'fell', 'trap', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'trying', 'make', 'statement', 'how', 'media', 'glorifies', 'exploits', 'violence', 'so', 'doing', 'just', 'glorifying', 'exploiting', 'even', 'more', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'dodged', 'bullet', 'least', 'dodged', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut']",N/A

First I heard it was under Comedy, then Drama, then Horror, and finally Action. In my opinion, it could be a cram mixture of all four, but most of all, this movie lies in the Foreign genre, for all its british anecdotes, comic styles(notice all the different shades of hair? watch pbs in the afternoon and see what i mean), and fairly obnoxious dialogue and eating habits. At least, that's my opinion.Now, this movie is rated R for a reason. It has nudity(most of which is exaggerated and satirical), violence in the way of bludgeoning people, and strong sexuality(there's a difference between being naked, and being sandwiched). In regards to all these warnings, just make sure you know what you're watching, because the entire film is this and more.What's in a name? I sure don't know what the title means. But I'm assuming it has some sort of heavy symbolism as the movie shows throughout. Now, first I'll summarize the film and then I'll nitpick. (SPOILER) Alex is part of a gang of four hooligans who, in a society bereft of common law and order, commits random acts of violence, rape, and burglary. Well, as the beginning of the movie fills out some of these acts, it comes to a scene in which he sneaks inside some lady's home, teases her, and murders her ""by accident."" Well, the authorities find out and convict him of murder. He finds himself sentenced to a hefty 14 years of prison, until it is heard two years into his sentence that a new government experiment is being executed to let out convicts within a period of only a month or so, cured, sane, and guaranteed not to commit a crime again. Well, wouldn't you know that our protagonist takes this oppurtunity and succumbs to severe traumatic brainwash, much like in other films, in which the subject is forced to watch immoral acts in hopes that they will change their mind. Some other factors play into his so-called reform and finally the results prove positive, but the whole episode gives the government a cruel public view. Alex moves out of his house as his parents no longer need him, still convinced that he is criminal, where he catches up to his old gang mates. Well, they've become police by now and decide to punish him for all the pain they went through from before. Bloodied, half-drowned and then rescued by none other than a former victim of Alex's crimes, our ""humble narrator"" again finds himself in a fix after the savior remembers the night he was victimized. He tries to torture Alex with a defect of his brainwashing condition and Alex frees himself by jumping from a window, landing himself in a hospital, and clearing his name after the government decides that the experiment was immoral. However, we know that even through all of this, our little hooligan is still run amock.Now, what didn't really appeal to me was the british tradition of extremely heavy dialogue. They don't seem to let their characters' actions speak for themselves. On the other hand, this is probably part of a technique to shock the viewer. Anyhow, the movie was very long and the setting was very interesting-sort of a pseudo, unashamed, tacky futuristic britain in which even old ladies can wear tight leather and furnishings are trippy and oblong. The art was very interesting too, though some tastes may not suit for various pictures of nudity in compromising positions.So really, my final word is this: The director did an amazing job of making the pro/antagonist menacing and coy. He also did a fine job of lifting a novel to the screen. However, it's really kind of disgusting how one movie can have so many different kinds of mood to it. Don't get me wrong now. Mood is good. But first we're in a dark world, then a dark comedy, then some kind of comical porn, next a slew of dramatic metaphors, the dredge of prison life, cruel intentions, madness, and finally you hate the character as much as you love him for still getting away with everything and learning nothing! Just cram the whole movie store into one movie and change the mood every 20 minutes. It seemed like that was the goal of this film. What's worse is that with all the character went through, he remains just as vice-ridden as before. Waste of time anyone? That's my opinion.",3,Why don't they just call this a foreign film?,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,4308,"['Okay', 'first', 'let', 'explain', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'DVD', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'First', 'heard', 'was', 'Comedy', 'then', 'Drama', 'then', 'Horror', 'finally', 'Action', 'opinion', 'could', 'be', 'cram', 'mixture', 'four', 'most', 'movie', 'Foreign', 'genre', 'british', 'anecdotes', 'comic', 'styles', 'notice', 'different', 'shades', 'hair', 'watch', 'pbs', 'afternoon', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'fairly', 'obnoxious', 'dialogue', 'eating', 'habits', 'least', 'opinion.Now', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'reason', 'nudity', 'most', 'exaggerated', 'satirical', 'violence', 'way', 'bludgeoning', 'people', 'strong', 'sexuality', 'difference', 'being', 'naked', 'being', 'sandwiched', 'regards', 'warnings', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'entire', 'film', 'name', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'title', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'sort', 'heavy', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'Now', 'first', ""'ll"", 'summarize', 'film', 'then', ""'ll"", 'nitpick', 'SPOILER', 'Alex', 'part', 'gang', 'four', 'hooligans', 'who', 'society', 'bereft', 'common', 'law', 'order', 'commits', 'random', 'acts', 'violence', 'rape', 'burglary', 'Well', 'beginning', 'movie', 'out', 'acts', 'scene', 'lady', 'home', 'accident', 'Well', 'authorities', 'find', 'out', 'convict', 'murder', 'sentenced', 'hefty', '14', 'years', 'prison', 'heard', 'two', 'years', 'sentence', 'new', 'government', 'experiment', 'being', 'executed', 'let', 'out', 'convicts', 'period', 'only', 'month', 'so', 'cured', 'sane', 'guaranteed', 'not', 'commit', 'crime', 'again', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'protagonist', 'oppurtunity', 'succumbs', 'severe', 'traumatic', 'brainwash', 'much', 'other', 'films', 'subject', 'forced', 'watch', 'immoral', 'acts', 'hopes', 'will', 'change', 'mind', 'other', 'factors', 'play', 'so-called', 'reform', 'finally', 'results', 'prove', 'positive', 'whole', 'episode', 'government', 'cruel', 'public', 'view', 'Alex', 'house', 'parents', 'no', 'longer', 'need', 'still', 'convinced', 'criminal', 'where', 'up', 'old', 'gang', 'mates', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'become', 'police', 'now', 'decide', 'punish', 'pain', 'went', 'Bloodied', 'half-drowned', 'then', 'rescued', 'none', 'other', 'former', 'victim', 'Alex', 'crimes', 'humble', 'narrator', 'again', 'fix', 'savior', 'remembers', 'night', 'was', 'victimized', 'torture', 'Alex', 'defect', 'brainwashing', 'condition', 'Alex', 'frees', 'jumping', 'window', 'landing', 'hospital', 'clearing', 'name', 'government', 'experiment', 'was', 'immoral', 'However', 'know', 'even', 'little', 'hooligan', 'still', 'run', 'amock.Now', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'appeal', 'was', 'british', 'tradition', 'extremely', 'heavy', 'dialogue', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'let', 'characters', 'actions', 'speak', 'other', 'hand', 'probably', 'part', 'technique', 'shock', 'viewer', 'Anyhow', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'long', 'setting', 'was', 'very', 'interesting-sort', 'pseudo', 'unashamed', 'tacky', 'futuristic', 'britain', 'even', 'old', 'ladies', 'can', 'wear', 'tight', 'leather', 'furnishings', 'are', 'trippy', 'oblong', 'art', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'too', 'tastes', 'may', 'not', 'suit', 'various', 'pictures', 'nudity', 'compromising', 'positions.So', 'really', 'final', 'word', 'director', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'making', 'pro/antagonist', 'menacing', 'coy', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'lifting', 'novel', 'screen', 'However', 'really', 'kind', 'disgusting', 'how', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'mood', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'now', 'Mood', 'good', 'first', ""'re"", 'dark', 'world', 'then', 'dark', 'comedy', 'then', 'kind', 'comical', 'porn', 'slew', 'dramatic', 'metaphors', 'dredge', 'prison', 'life', 'cruel', 'intentions', 'madness', 'finally', 'hate', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'still', 'getting', 'away', 'everything', 'learning', 'nothing', 'Just', 'cram', 'whole', 'movie', 'store', 'one', 'movie', 'change', 'mood', '20', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'was', 'goal', 'film', 'What', 'worse', 'character', 'went', 'just', 'as', 'vice-ridden', 'before', 'Waste', 'time', 'anyone', 'opinion']",N/A

One of the most disturbing , humorous , violent , sadistic , and just bizzare films that I have seen and actually enjoyed. I have watched this at least 1000 something times since my first viewing at the age of 12. The message and actual purpose of the story gets lost to most viewers who either see it as a warning on the governments method of curving crime , or someone who enjoys violence and nudity , or those who just can't stomache it. Malcom McDowell gives his finest sneering performance ever as Alex the droog leader who enjoys his dope laced milk , ultraviolence , horrorshow and rape and Beethoven. The perfect antihero . Kubrick loaded the film with his usual artsy imagery and popped up versions of famous classical compositions. The slang of the characters is hard to sit through but it makes the film better. The movie does and excellent job at toying with the viewers emotions..we have this sadistic sick character who becomes the victim himself , and also to some may be shown sympathy for. Burgess wanted to prove his point on freedom by creating a ghoulish character of sadism , but also saying that every man deserves to change himself and shouldn't be forced. Alex was brainwashed into curving his violence and sexual activity , he had no choice , the government was only concerned with cutting down crime ..therefor eliminating his freedom in the free world. Now the only problem with this film in comparrison to the book is the omission of the last chapter in which Alex questions his life and wants to reform it on his own. The movie simply just ends with him going back to his nasty self.

85528,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,0790701022,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[51, 71]","Made in 1971, this was considered a very brutal film for its time.  In 2001, I still wonder why this movie is only rated ""R"". It contains a lot of scenes of rape, nudity, graphic violence, and other mayhem that I believe caused it to be banned in several countries.  But it has also won praise from many critics and is considered to be a cult classic.Set in near-future England, this film tells the story of Alex.  On the surface, Alex (played by twenty-something Malcolm McDowell) is a typical teenage boy who engages in meaningless conversations with his parents, puts on a good show in front his counselor... and does other things to keep up appearances.  However, Alex is a gang member who indulges in every sort of impulsive criminal activity possible while listening to Beethoven to psyche himself up.One night, Alex and his gang break into a lady's house.  The rest of the gang is outside while Alex struggles with the lady until he eventually kills her.  After Alex leaves the house, his gang turns on him and leaves him to fend for himself until the police arrive.Alex is sent to prison.  After a while, Alex wants to reform.  He has a chance when a new behavioral experiment called the ""Ludovico"" treatment is in need of guinea pigs.  Alex volunteers.  The experiment is a brainwashing method that causes Alex to be sickened by any form of sex or violence.  It even causes him to be sickened by Beethoven's music.After Alex is released from prison, several things happen.  His family disowns him, his former friends are now police officers that assault him, and the experiment has other side effects than just eliminating his urges.  He is no longer able to defend himself when attacked as well.This is not an easy movie to watch with the numerous physically and emotionally violent scenes, but it does make you ask yourself a few things.  Is society justified in destroying a predator by creating a victim?  Or who needs reform the most: the criminals or the society that continues to punish them after their legitimate sentences have been served?  The film is not one that offers any quick or easy answers, yet it shows a perspective of societal problems that is equally timely for 1971 or 2001.",5,30 years old and still ahead of its time,995500800,"07 19, 2001",2001,2207,"['Made', '1971', 'was', 'considered', 'very', 'brutal', 'film', 'time', '2001', 'still', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'only', 'rated', 'R', 'lot', 'scenes', 'rape', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'violence', 'other', 'mayhem', 'believe', 'caused', 'be', 'banned', 'several', 'countries', 'also', 'won', 'praise', 'many', 'critics', 'considered', 'be', 'cult', 'classic.Set', 'near-future', 'England', 'film', 'story', 'Alex', 'surface', 'Alex', 'played', 'twenty-something', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'typical', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'meaningless', 'conversations', 'parents', 'good', 'show', 'front', 'counselor', 'other', 'things', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'However', 'Alex', 'gang', 'member', 'who', 'sort', 'impulsive', 'criminal', 'activity', 'possible', 'listening', 'Beethoven', 'psyche', 'up.One', 'night', 'Alex', 'gang', 'break', 'lady', 'house', 'rest', 'gang', 'outside', 'Alex', 'lady', 'eventually', 'Alex', 'house', 'gang', 'fend', 'police', 'arrive.Alex', 'sent', 'prison', 'while', 'Alex', 'reform', 'chance', 'when', 'new', 'behavioral', 'experiment', 'called', 'Ludovico', 'treatment', 'need', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'Alex', 'volunteers', 'experiment', 'brainwashing', 'method', 'Alex', 'be', 'sickened', 'form', 'sex', 'violence', 'even', 'be', 'sickened', 'Beethoven', 'music.After', 'Alex', 'released', 'prison', 'several', 'things', 'happen', 'family', 'former', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'police', 'officers', 'assault', 'experiment', 'other', 'side', 'effects', 'just', 'eliminating', 'urges', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'defend', 'when', 'attacked', 'well.This', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'numerous', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'violent', 'scenes', 'make', 'ask', 'few', 'things', 'society', 'justified', 'destroying', 'predator', 'creating', 'victim', 'who', 'reform', 'most', 'criminals', 'society', 'punish', 'legitimate', 'sentences', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'quick', 'easy', 'answers', 'perspective', 'societal', 'problems', 'equally', 'timely', '1971', '2001']",N/A

85537,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0790701022,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Friends are shocked when I tell them I find this movie fascinating and enjoy watching it every five years or so. They all think this is a very sick, shocking and just plain revolting movie. Hey, I understand that. When this film was released almost four decades ago, it was highly controversial. Even though nudity is nothing new in films today, I suspect this story still shocks a lot of people. It isn't just the nudity but the carefree-sadistic attitude of the main character that is repulsive to many.The vocabulary and the creepiness of lead actor Malcolm McDowell's character ""Alexander de Large"" is like nothing I have ever heard and seen on film. I play the DVD now with the subtitles on to understand all the strange words and expressions McDowell uses as he narrates this story. That dialog, too, is still unique and probably always will be.A big attraction for me or the wild visuals. The outrageous colors in here from the clothing McDowell and his gang wore, to the futuristic house interiors and sets, are still something to see! I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best work, cinematography-wise, which is why - when I saw the first 10 minutes on Blu-Ray at a store, I was disappointed it wasn't that sharp.Yes, the violence is shocking but that sets up the main storyline: dealing with that kind of mentality (a sick thug with no apparent conscience). What ensues in the story is almost as disturbing - and thought-provoking.  After ""Alex"" is captured, he is a part of new experiment to cure violent and overly sexual tendencies. The scenes of his ""rehabililation"" aren't always easy to watch. He then returns to the street and is almost killed by his former victims who ""accidently"" run into him. Things get so bad Alex"" tries to kill himself, so the media gives him a big splash and they de-program him back to his normal sick self and the movie ends abruptly with Alex a happy man again. How twisted is that?? A rapist homicidal maniac is set free and the government is made to look stupid? Well, since this comes from Kubrick, that's not surprising. But, this film probably was interpreted in numerous ways and was an interesting discussion-starter.In summary, a perverted story but the one-of-a-kind lead character, famous visuals and sets and interesting message always make this film watchable, but be warned: this is a brutal and often uncomfortable movie to watch.",5,One-Of-A-Kind,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,2437,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Friends', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'tell', 'find', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'think', 'very', 'sick', 'shocking', 'just', 'plain', 'revolting', 'movie', 'Hey', 'understand', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'almost', 'four', 'decades', 'ago', 'was', 'highly', 'controversial', 'Even', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'new', 'films', 'today', 'suspect', 'story', 'still', 'lot', 'people', ""n't"", 'just', 'nudity', 'carefree-sadistic', 'attitude', 'main', 'character', 'repulsive', 'many.The', 'vocabulary', 'creepiness', 'lead', 'actor', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'character', 'Alexander', 'de', 'Large', 'nothing', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'seen', 'film', 'play', 'DVD', 'now', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'strange', 'words', 'expressions', 'McDowell', 'story', 'dialog', 'too', 'still', 'unique', 'probably', 'always', 'will', 'be.A', 'big', 'attraction', 'wild', 'visuals', 'outrageous', 'colors', 'here', 'clothing', 'McDowell', 'gang', 'wore', 'futuristic', 'house', 'interiors', 'sets', 'are', 'still', 'something', 'see', 'think', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'best', 'work', 'cinematography-wise', 'why', 'when', 'saw', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'Blu-Ray', 'store', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'sharp.Yes', 'violence', 'shocking', 'up', 'main', 'storyline', 'dealing', 'kind', 'mentality', 'sick', 'thug', 'apparent', 'conscience', 'What', 'story', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'thought-provoking', 'Alex', 'captured', 'part', 'new', 'experiment', 'cure', 'violent', 'overly', 'sexual', 'tendencies', 'scenes', 'rehabililation', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'watch', 'then', 'street', 'almost', 'killed', 'former', 'victims', 'who', 'accidently', 'run', 'Things', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'Alex', 'kill', 'media', 'big', 'splash', 'de-program', 'back', 'normal', 'sick', 'self', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'Alex', 'happy', 'man', 'again', 'How', 'twisted', 'rapist', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'set', 'free', 'government', 'made', 'look', 'stupid', 'Well', 'Kubrick', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'probably', 'was', 'interpreted', 'numerous', 'ways', 'was', 'interesting', 'discussion-starter.In', 'summary', 'perverted', 'story', 'one-of-a-kind', 'lead', 'character', 'famous', 'visuals', 'sets', 'interesting', 'message', 'always', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'be', 'warned', 'brutal', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A
85538,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,0790701022,C. Sawin,"[4, 5]","Alex DeLarge is your average eighteen year old boy...if by average, you mean he fully embraces the old ultraviolence and wanders the streets with his three droogs causing havoc and doing whatever he likes. Skipping school, breaking and entering, rape, assault...just another day in Alex's life. However, when a planned rape turns into an ""accidental"" murder, things start to turn fowl for Alex. His droogs turn on him and he winds up being caught by the police. He is then taken to a correctional facility where he spends the next few years, puts on the front that he's fully embraced the bible, and that he's now a changed man. But when word makes round of the experimental Ludovico treatment, Alex realizes his chance at freedom and jumps through the proper hoops to get out of the penitentiary he finds himself in and get into the experimental facility where he can be ""cured."" He is promised that he'll be a free man within a fortnight. The treatment consists of a drug known as Serum 114 being injected into the patient before making them sit through short films such as a man being beaten to a pulp, a woman being the sexual victim of several men, and a Nazi concentration camp film set to the soundtrack of Beethoven's ninth symphony. Alex begins to feel sick during the films and the doctors insist it's part of the cure. Alex's love for music and Beethoven in general become one of the adverse affects of the treatment as the ninth symphony has the same affect on Alex as the urge to beat or rape someone would. Alex soon comes to realize that you can never go home again and that being a free man isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially after a treatment such as this.It took me this long to finally sit down and watch this film. I have been told for months, maybe years, by friends that I need to see this because I'd enjoy it. I should have listened to those recommendations long ago because I did enjoy it. It is definitely an odd film. The film starts and it makes the viewer feel like they've missed something entirely that everyone else already knows about, but as the film unravels it snowballs into a unique vision of cinema. It kind of reminded me of Altered States, but I enjoyed this much more than Altered States. Even though A Clockwork Orange has a running time of well over two hours, it didn't feel that way. I wasn't glancing at the clock wondering when the film would end. The film didn't drag at all. It was odd, as I mentioned before, but it was interesting enough to keep my attention span throughout the entire film. That's something I take note of with the amount of films I sit through every week.The way the film looked and sounded was amazing, as well. Even though Clockwork is closing in on being forty years old, it sure doesn't look like it. Every scene had brilliant, vibrant colors that pretty much made every frame jump off the screen. The sound in the film was also near perfection. I was reading on IMDb that this was the first film take advantage of Dolby Digital surround sound and it shows.I also really love the way Kubrick shot this film. His sense of perspective is incredible. The long hallway shots and scenes that highlight an actors facial expressions are some of the most memorable scenes in the film and a lot of credit for that goes to the way he shot it. He's a director that I've come to realize I actually admire quite a bit, but need to actually see more of his work.Malcolm McDowell deserves a nod, as well. I doubt I'll be saying anything that hasn't already been said about him in this role, but humor me and pretend that this movie was just released on DVD or something. He makes the film and I'm not just saying that because he's in the lead role. I mean, it's hard to imagine A Clockwork Orange with another actor in McDowell's place. Malcolm McDowell is Alex DeLarge, period. Some of the speeches he gives along with the way he acts during and after the treatment process are some of the most memorable of any film I've sat through.A Clockwork Orange is quite a unique trip, no matter how you look at it. It is weird and unusual, but is worth the watch since it's never actually boring. Kubrick's vision of the film could be the main reason to sit through it as it seems like every shot grabs your attention largely in part to its perspective. Arguably though, the film could be worth seeing due to being the film that Malcolm McDowell is best known for. Clockwork is a film I wouldn't recommend to anyone as I feel like it may not only go over some viewers heads, but soar over. It's for viewers with unique taste for cinema that are willing to sit down and actually pay attention to a film rather than be on the computer or do anything else while trying to watch a movie. A dramatic/science fiction/thriller that is not only viewed by some as one of the ten greatest films in the sci-fi genre but also one of the greatest films of all time.Rating: 8/10",4,A Taste of the Old Ultraviolence,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,4926,"['Alex', 'DeLarge', 'average', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'average', 'mean', 'fully', 'old', 'ultraviolence', 'streets', 'three', 'droogs', 'causing', 'havoc', 'doing', 'whatever', 'Skipping', 'school', 'breaking', 'entering', 'rape', 'assault', 'just', 'day', 'Alex', 'life', 'However', 'when', 'planned', 'rape', 'accidental', 'murder', 'things', 'start', 'turn', 'fowl', 'Alex', 'droogs', 'turn', 'up', 'being', 'caught', 'police', 'then', 'taken', 'correctional', 'facility', 'where', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'front', 'fully', 'embraced', 'bible', 'now', 'changed', 'man', 'when', 'word', 'round', 'experimental', 'Ludovico', 'treatment', 'Alex', 'chance', 'freedom', 'jumps', 'proper', 'hoops', 'get', 'penitentiary', 'get', 'experimental', 'facility', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'promised', ""'ll"", 'be', 'free', 'man', 'fortnight', 'treatment', 'drug', 'known', 'Serum', '114', 'being', 'injected', 'patient', 'making', 'sit', 'short', 'films', 'such', 'man', 'being', 'beaten', 'pulp', 'woman', 'being', 'sexual', 'victim', 'several', 'men', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'film', 'set', 'soundtrack', 'Beethoven', 'ninth', 'symphony', 'Alex', 'feel', 'sick', 'films', 'doctors', 'insist', 'part', 'cure', 'Alex', 'love', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'general', 'become', 'one', 'adverse', 'affects', 'treatment', 'ninth', 'symphony', 'same', 'affect', 'Alex', 'urge', 'beat', 'rape', 'someone', 'would', 'Alex', 'soon', 'realize', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'being', 'free', 'man', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'especially', 'treatment', 'such', 'this.It', 'took', 'long', 'finally', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'months', 'maybe', 'years', 'friends', 'need', 'see', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'recommendations', 'long', 'ago', 'did', 'enjoy', 'definitely', 'odd', 'film', 'film', 'viewer', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'something', 'entirely', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'film', 'unravels', 'unique', 'vision', 'cinema', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Altered', 'States', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'Altered', 'States', 'Even', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'running', 'time', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'glancing', 'clock', 'wondering', 'when', 'film', 'would', 'end', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag', 'was', 'odd', 'mentioned', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'span', 'entire', 'film', 'something', 'take', 'note', 'amount', 'films', 'sit', 'week.The', 'way', 'film', 'looked', 'sounded', 'was', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'Clockwork', 'closing', 'being', 'forty', 'years', 'old', 'sure', ""n't"", 'look', 'Every', 'scene', 'had', 'brilliant', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'frame', 'jump', 'screen', 'sound', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'near', 'perfection', 'was', 'reading', 'IMDb', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'take', 'advantage', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'surround', 'sound', 'also', 'really', 'love', 'way', 'Kubrick', 'shot', 'film', 'sense', 'perspective', 'incredible', 'long', 'hallway', 'shots', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'actors', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'lot', 'credit', 'way', 'shot', 'director', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'actually', 'admire', 'quite', 'bit', 'need', 'actually', 'see', 'more', 'work.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'nod', 'as', 'well', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'saying', 'anything', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'role', 'humor', 'pretend', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'DVD', 'something', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', 'lead', 'role', 'mean', 'hard', 'imagine', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'actor', 'McDowell', 'place', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Alex', 'DeLarge', 'period', 'speeches', 'way', 'treatment', 'process', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'through.A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'quite', 'unique', 'trip', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'weird', 'unusual', 'watch', 'never', 'actually', 'boring', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'main', 'reason', 'sit', 'shot', 'grabs', 'attention', 'largely', 'part', 'perspective', 'Arguably', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'due', 'being', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'best', 'known', 'Clockwork', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'feel', 'may', 'not', 'only', 'go', 'over', 'viewers', 'heads', 'over', 'viewers', 'unique', 'taste', 'cinema', 'are', 'willing', 'sit', 'down', 'actually', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'rather', 'be', 'computer', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'trying', 'watch', 'movie', 'dramatic/science', 'fiction/thriller', 'not', 'only', 'viewed', 'one', 'ten', 'greatest', 'films', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time.Rating', '8/10']",N/A

And we sat in the Korova Milkbar, trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening.  The Korova Milkbar sold milk-plus; milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.""Alex's mug, with eyes twinkling with combined mischief and malice, is shown full view.  Two other things make this opening scene memorable.  One is the gradual pullback that gives a symmetrical picture of the Milkbar, with the furniture and milk dispensers of nude females in submission.  The other is Henry Purcell's ominous ""Funeral for Queen Anne"" music adapted by Wendy Carlos, playing.The next few scenes are scenes of sheer violence pounded one by one like blows from Thor's hammer in rapid succession--the beating of the old drunk, the fight with Billy Boy's gang, the ride in the Durango 95, and of course, the most disturbing scene of all, the raid on the author's house and his wife's assault.However, Alex's dictatorial ways prove to be his undoing and he is sent to prison for ""the accidental killing of a person.""The use of aversion therapy, mind control, and the use of musical association to control behavior is explored but the conversation between Dr. Branom and Alex on violence is interesting:Branom:  Violence is a very horrible thing.  That is what you're learning now.  Your body is learning it.Alex:  I don't understand about feeling sick like I did.  I neverused to feel sick before.  I used to feel like the very opposite.  Doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow [great]Branom:  You felt ill this afternoon because you are getting better.  When we're healthy, we respond to the hateful with fear and nausea.  You're becoming healthy, that's all.I'd add here, yes, but surely watching violence is better than actually doing it?The theme explored in this movie that really struck the deepest chord in me is the concept of human choice and free will.  Ironically, it isn't a philosopher who speaks on this subject but the padre.  His conversation with Alex while discussing the Ludovico Technique asks:  ""The question is whether such a technique can really make a man good.  Goodness comes from within.  Goodness is something chosen.  If a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""  The padre is also the only one who questions the treatment:  ""The boy has no choice does he?  Self-interest drove him to that act of self-abasement.  He ceases to be a wrongdoer.  He also ceases to be capable of moral choice.""  So does that mean that someone who chooses to be evil is better than someone compelled to do good sans choice?  To go further, what is the unfettered instinctive nature of man and woman?

A brilliant and moral  &quot;shocker&quot; that really tries to dig deep into you and successfully  does so even after the first few minutes. People hate it because it  &quot;glorifies violence.&quot; If this is true, then why does the plot  itself suggest that violence is an ugly thing? Alex gets my vote for best  costume of the 70's (I went as him for halloween) and he did a pretty good  job, although I hear him and Kubrick didn't say one word to one another  after production was completed. Was Kubrick an eccentric man? You bet he  was. This makes this movie all the more greater; he could care less about  the criticism. He knew what he was doing. He knew it wasn't going to be a  &quot;normal&quot; movie. And low and behold: it's still being praised  after 30 years and is really clicking with generation Xers for some odd  reason (LSD, anyone?). If not for all the rape and nudity scenes, this  would be the perfect film to show in a religion class to teach the kiddies  about the value of free will. And it's not a boring movie either. Kubrick  maintains a smooth story to go along with his perfectionist style and  creates one of the most beautiful and visually spectacular films of the  70's; or of any decade for that matter.

85547,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790701022,David Baldwin,"[1, 3]","Before I review this film I'd like to give a note of caution. ""A Clockwork Orange"" was adapted from a novel by Anthony Burgess, who based some of the events in the book on the brutal rape of his wife.  Stanley Kubrick, the director, pulled this film from release in his adopted country, England, after there were copy-cat crimes based on incidents depicted in the film.  His concern was the heinous acts portrayed in the film would be mis-interpreted by impressionable minds.  In the United States, this film was originally given an ""X"" rating, prohibiting anyone under seventeen from viewing it.  On a personal note I saw this film(repeatedly) as a teenager and the selling point to me was how cool the stylized violence was portrayed in the film.  Preaching aside, this is a great film for adults.  The story, set in an undetermined future, where youth gangs rule the streets of England.  One particular gang,or ""droogs"", is led by the charismatic Alex(Malcolm McDowell) who enjoy nothing more than assaulting homeless people, pinching autos, raping women,and just general mayhem.  After accidently killing a woman in a breaking and entering, Alex is imprisoned.  To his fortune or misfortune he is selected by the present government to receive treatment that would involuntarily supress his propensity for violence.  Released from prison without the free-will to protect himself from the malevolent forces who would prey on him, Alex is victimized.  The question that has to be asked by discerning viewers is does this film concern itself with free-will or is is it just an excuse for displaying stylized, choreographed violence?  I would have to say this film does effectively navigate itself on the side of free-will.  The rationale for the prettiness of some of the violence is that the story is told in the first person, as it was in Burgess' novel.  We have to see violence as Alex sees it and Alex loves violence.  McDowell does a charismatic turn as Alex and is supported by a fine cast(Patrick Magee, Miriam Karlin, etc.).  The art-deco look, the editing, the cinematography, the music(including moog classical by Wendy Carlos) is excellent.  Kubrick further cemented his reputation as the top director in films at the time and also contributed a superior screenplay.  A lot of the dialogue in the film is in ""nadsat"", a hybrid of English slang and Russian.  In the novel, Burgess uses an appendix to explain some of the terms but Kubrick effectively conveys here the meaning of a lot of these terms.  On a final note, the film ends somewhat ambiguously where Alex states ""I was cured alright"".  This corresponds with the ending that appeared in the American editions of Burgess' novel.  The British version contains an additional chapter that only appeared recently in America where it would appear that Alex repudiates his old ways.",5,What's It Going To Be Eh?,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2845,"['review', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'note', 'caution', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'who', 'based', 'events', 'book', 'brutal', 'rape', 'wife', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'director', 'pulled', 'film', 'release', 'adopted', 'country', 'England', 'were', 'copy-cat', 'crimes', 'based', 'incidents', 'depicted', 'film', 'concern', 'was', 'heinous', 'acts', 'portrayed', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mis-interpreted', 'impressionable', 'minds', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'given', 'X', 'rating', 'prohibiting', 'anyone', 'seventeen', 'viewing', 'personal', 'note', 'saw', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'teenager', 'selling', 'point', 'was', 'how', 'cool', 'stylized', 'violence', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Preaching', 'aside', 'great', 'film', 'adults', 'story', 'set', 'undetermined', 'future', 'where', 'youth', 'gangs', 'rule', 'streets', 'England', 'One', 'particular', 'gang', 'droogs', 'led', 'charismatic', 'Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'enjoy', 'nothing', 'more', 'assaulting', 'homeless', 'people', 'pinching', 'autos', 'raping', 'women', 'just', 'general', 'mayhem', 'accidently', 'killing', 'woman', 'breaking', 'entering', 'Alex', 'imprisoned', 'fortune', 'misfortune', 'selected', 'present', 'government', 'receive', 'treatment', 'would', 'involuntarily', 'supress', 'propensity', 'violence', 'Released', 'prison', 'free-will', 'protect', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'who', 'would', 'prey', 'Alex', 'victimized', 'question', 'be', 'asked', 'discerning', 'viewers', 'film', 'concern', 'free-will', 'just', 'excuse', 'displaying', 'stylized', 'choreographed', 'violence', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'effectively', 'navigate', 'side', 'free-will', 'rationale', 'prettiness', 'violence', 'story', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'was', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'have', 'see', 'violence', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'violence', 'McDowell', 'charismatic', 'turn', 'Alex', 'supported', 'fine', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'Miriam', 'Karlin', 'etc.', 'art-deco', 'look', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'music', 'including', 'moog', 'classical', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'excellent', 'Kubrick', 'further', 'cemented', 'reputation', 'top', 'director', 'films', 'time', 'also', 'contributed', 'superior', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'film', 'nadsat', 'hybrid', 'English', 'slang', 'Russian', 'novel', 'Burgess', 'appendix', 'explain', 'terms', 'Kubrick', 'effectively', 'here', 'meaning', 'lot', 'terms', 'final', 'note', 'film', 'somewhat', 'ambiguously', 'where', 'Alex', 'was', 'cured', 'alright', 'ending', 'appeared', 'American', 'editions', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'British', 'version', 'additional', 'chapter', 'only', 'appeared', 'recently', 'America', 'where', 'would', 'appear', 'Alex', 'old', 'ways']",N/A

First, the film's weird plot is very inventive and dynamic. Second, the characters, and that rather strange dialogue they use, which Kubrick refers to as Nasdat (please don't ask me abot that one!). Third, get a load of those costumes and disguises Alex and his droogs wear! Fourth, the infamous rape scene (which turns some people off), which I won't care to elaborate further, and fifth, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was filmed in Jolly Olde England (you just gotta love those British accents!). Granted, when I first saw this movie some years ago, to be quite honest, I couldn't make heads or tales of what was going on! That's the beauty of watching a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, in that he doesn't insult the average viewer's intelligence, so he leaves the viewer to use his or her own imagination as to why the nature of the plot in question occurred.

After read the article I was more than a little bit curious to see what all of the hype was about, frankly after seeing it I can understand, somewhat why people freaked out the way they did, the film from my experience manages to get inside you head and mess with your mind a little bit, I figure that if it does that to me now I can only imagine what it did to some of the more conservative veiwers of the early 70's.The Acting, Directing, screenplay, visuals and music of the film are all very well done and put together in what could be considered by some to be Kubricks best or second best film (he has made 7), Kubrick is known for his excplict scenes have given the MPAA more than a little bit of a difficult time over the years if you know what I mean ...Grade: A",5,Brilliance.,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,1607,"['Genious', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1971', 'classic', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'absolute', 'masterful', 'display', 'film', 'made', 'early', '70', 'film', 'feel', 'am', 'watching', 'something', 'far', 'time', 'period', 'am', 'only', '16', 'years', 'old', 'be', 'completely', 'furthest', 'thing', 'mind', 'was', 'watching', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'i', 'read', 'recent', 'article', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'was', 'titled', '25', 'most', 'controversial', 'films', 'Ever', 'made', 'suprise', 'Cult', 'classic', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'included', 'close', 'top', '2', 'just', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'Britian', '2000', 'was', 'just', 'year', 'Kubricks', 'death', 'then', 'was', 'labled', 'pornography', 'given', 'X', 'rating', 'reported', 'several', 'copycat', 'killings', 'film', 'read', 'article', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'about', 'frankly', 'seeing', 'can', 'understand', 'somewhat', 'why', 'people', 'freaked', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'film', 'experience', 'get', 'head', 'mess', 'mind', 'little', 'bit', 'figure', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'did', 'more', 'conservative', 'veiwers', 'early', ""70's.The"", 'Acting', 'Directing', 'screenplay', 'visuals', 'music', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'put', 'together', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'Kubricks', 'best', 'second', 'best', 'film', 'made', '7', 'Kubrick', 'known', 'excplict', 'scenes', 'have', 'given', 'MPAA', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'difficult', 'time', 'years', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Grade']",N/A

Many characters in movies have become household names in the United States; Luke Skywalker, Don Corleone, Michael Myers, etc, etc.  One of the main things I did not like about 'A Clockwork Orange' was its main character, and that was what ruined the movie.  In fact, I think this movie did not have any likable characters, which makes it even harder to watch.Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' has become a cult-classic.  I remember in high school, this film was very well known and liked by a lot of people.  At the same time, I realized that it was liked because of how grotesque and violent the story was, and not famous for the messages it was trying to convey.  The film is based on a book with the same name by Anthony Burgess.  I think both the book and movie are vastly overrated.  The book was slightly better than the movie, but it still did not impress me that much.One of the main problems with the story is that we have so sympathize with a rapist and a murderer.  This is hard to do regardless of what punishments he receives.  The basic prolbem is that we have to feel sorry for a character whose main solutions in solving problems is through violent means.  Sorry, I cannot like somebody like that regardless if his free will is taken away.  Let me ask a question to those people who are in favor of this film.  Would you still be adulation of Kubrick's overrated movie if it had starred somebody similar to Jeffry Dahmer, Adolf Hitler, or any other real-life killer?

tale of Alex and his 3 ""Droogs""...here are some cool side notes on the making of the film: an interesting bit involving the scence where Officer Dim and Officer Georgie beat and stuff Alex's head into a bin filled with water...Malcom McDowell almost truly drowned then as his breathing device failed...wow would that have been ""real tragic like""...another cool side note is that at the begining point of talks of making this a movie...Mick Jaegger of the rOLLING sTONES actually bought the rights and had planned on making the film starring himself as Alex and the Stones as the DROOGS...""O'H

There are scenes here without any dialogue that simply scream for your attention, such as lewd graffiti drawn on the wall as a character passes by; or the outrageous costumes that all the bizarre characters wear.  Elements like this Stanley Kubrick inserted for extra punch, provoking reaction.  As a side note, do not read the novel before watching the film.  I saw the movie first, then read the novel, and it really does help to fully understand all the slang Anthony Burgess created solely for the novel.  I lent the book to a friend who hadn't seen the film, and to say the least, he had a difficult time digesting the strange material.

The last time I watched it I was only 15, so clearly my impression of it at this point in my life is different. Even at 15, I found the violence to be disturbing and not at all funny, and understood on some level that the main characer, Alex, despite his ""rehabilitation"", still had to pay the price for the vicious crimes he commits in the beginning of the film. At 29, this karmic theme makes even more sense to me. Despite being rendered incapable of violence due to the experimental treatment he receives, Alex still doesn't understand the consequences of his actions, and can't see his crimes from the perspective of his victims. So although the government's ""treatment"" may keep violent criminals from committing more violent crimes, it does nothing to treat the spiritual illness of a society who still, at it's core, rewards aggressiveness and believes that ""might makes right"".What I certainly didn't appreciate at 15 were the stunning and provocative visuals of the film. Instead of creating a future full of high-tech gadgets, Kubrick fills the scenary with imagery suggesting mannequin-like sexuality and soulless, tacky modernism. Even Alex's gang uniform (lipstick, false eyelash, jockstrap, combat boots) suggests phony, plastic beauty combined with aggressiveness and insanity.Although I believe that ""Clockwork"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are the only Kubrick films I've seen so far, I can see from both of these brilliant films why he's widely considered to be a genius filmmaker.",5,Karma,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1572,"['just', 'watched', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'fourteen', 'years', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'only', '15', 'so', 'clearly', 'impression', 'point', 'life', 'different', 'Even', '15', 'found', 'violence', 'be', 'disturbing', 'not', 'funny', 'understood', 'level', 'main', 'characer', 'Alex', 'rehabilitation', 'still', 'had', 'pay', 'price', 'vicious', 'crimes', 'beginning', 'film', '29', 'karmic', 'theme', 'even', 'more', 'sense', 'being', 'rendered', 'incapable', 'violence', 'due', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'Alex', 'still', ""n't"", 'understand', 'consequences', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'crimes', 'perspective', 'victims', 'government', 'treatment', 'may', 'keep', 'violent', 'criminals', 'committing', 'more', 'violent', 'crimes', 'nothing', 'treat', 'spiritual', 'illness', 'society', 'who', 'still', 'core', 'rewards', 'aggressiveness', 'might', 'right', '.What', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', '15', 'were', 'stunning', 'provocative', 'visuals', 'film', 'Instead', 'creating', 'future', 'full', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'Kubrick', 'scenary', 'imagery', 'suggesting', 'mannequin-like', 'sexuality', 'soulless', 'tacky', 'modernism', 'Even', 'Alex', 'gang', 'uniform', 'lipstick', 'false', 'eyelash', 'jockstrap', 'combat', 'boots', 'phony', 'plastic', 'beauty', 'combined', 'aggressiveness', 'insanity.Although', 'believe', 'Clockwork', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'are', 'only', 'Kubrick', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'brilliant', 'films', 'why', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'genius', 'filmmaker']",N/A

85572,A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA,0790701022,Eddy Oquendo,"[6, 7]","Few films in the history of cinema leave one with as many powerfully ingrained images as Stanley Kubrick's &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; Based on the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name, it's an often violent,  sometimes funny, Dali-esque picture of great artistic appeal. The  quintessential &quot;love-it-or-hate-it&quot; film, &quot;Clockwork&quot;  makes demands of our senses and of our moral values. It is a work made for  people that are unafraid to peer into the basest of human tendencies, and  dares to force everyone else to look as well.One of the underlying  themes of the story lessens the irony that today's audiences find its brand  of violence tame. But Kubrick does a fantastic job of using quirky humor to  enhance the impact of the brutality on the screen. Juxtaposing camp that is  reminiscent of the sixties &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, with images of  sheer savagery, was a masterstroke that exposes violence for the absurdity  that it is. As the viewers will see for themselves, the protagonist becomes  the target of a very insidious form of evil.The great director's use of  cinematography is brilliant in this work, and his lacing of music with the  imagery is potent indeed. Burgess's novel is flecked with references to  music, and Kubrick exploited this fact to the utmost. We are often treated  to sensory paradox, as the director blends fury with whimsy, and the  mundane with menace. Among other scenes, who can forget the opening shot,  the &quot;signing in the rain&quot; sequence, or the scene by the  &quot;flatblock marina&quot;?Malcolm McDowell's performance is fabulous!  As the sociopathic, young hoodlum, &quot;Alex,&quot; McDowell manages to  make us laugh (sometimes with remorse), make us loathe him, and even,  somehow, pity him. Malcolm takes his lines, laden with the catchy, invented  language &quot;Nadsat,&quot; and makes them memorable. Kubrick himself  didn't want to make the movie with another actor, and his genius served him  well; one CANNOT imagine any other actor in the role of  &quot;Alex.&quot;The video transfer of this movie to DVD is adequate; I  found little to complain about, other than the grainy appearance of a  couple of scenes. The sound is fine, but consumers should be aware that  it's only offered in the original mono. Purists may be disappointed with  the film's &quot;matted&quot; widescreen format, as there has been some  question regarding the legitimacy of this &quot;preserving the aspect ratio  of its original theatrical exhibition.&quot; Finally, there are NO special  features other than the theatrical trailer. (It's unfortunate that the same  elitism that helped make Kubrick a legendary director has shortchanged fans  of his works.) Still, this is the best that lovers of &quot;A Clockwork  Orange&quot; have at their disposal, and, at Amazon's price, it's hard to  pass up.For fans of this film, I highly recommend the excellent, seminal  novel by Anthony Burgess; it's a fast, enjoyable read, containing the 21st  chapter omitted in the movie version. Among movies, I suggest that you give  &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; and, the soon to be released on DVD,  &quot;Fightclub&quot; a try.

85573,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,0790701022,Edmonson,"[2, 3]","""A Clockwork Orange""(1971) was Stanely Kubrick's low budget film made for a fraction (2.2 million) of what it had cost him to make ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (10.5 million) three years earlier. This darkly satirical science fiction movie was based on Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel ""A Clockwork Orange"". The novel was a cathartic novel for Burgess who wrote it after his own wife had been raped. The story is a sort of morality tale whereby Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the leader of a group of thugs, finds the tables flipped after his own gang turns on him, and he later stumbles across the paths of those that he had previously done wrong by. The story also involves the issue of free-will and psychological conditioning as Alex undergoes aversion therapy which turns him into a good member of society, but at the loss of his free-will. In this sense Alex becomes a kind of clockwork orange, organic on the outside and mechanical on the inside.One of the major differences between the movie and the book was the deletion of the last chapter dealing with Alex's redemption. This last chapter, however, was missing from all American editions of the novel prior to 1986. Kubrick found out about this discrepancy when he was nearly finished the screenplay, but he decided to keep out the final chapter since he thought that it weakened the story. The movie, like the book, also features an invented dialect which is a mixture of Russian (slavic), English, and Cockney slang. Burgess knew that linguistic slang was constantly changing and so in order to prevent his novel from becoming dated he chose to give his narrator a unique voice that would remain ageless, while at the same time reinforcing Alex's indifference to his society's norms.This movie has the distinction of being the first movie to use the Dolby Sound system. The blu-ray is in PCM 5.1 Dolby Digital and has been remastered and cleaned up and presented in 1080p HD with an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. There are many special features, including commentary by Malcolm McDowell, and Nick Redman, and documentaries such as ""The Return of Clockwork Orange"", ""Great Bolshy Yarblockos!: Making of a Clockwork Orange"", and an excellent career profile of Malcolm McDowell, ""O Lucky Malcolm!"", which is over an hour long.",5,Satirical morality tale set in the not too distant future...,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2265,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', '1971', 'was', 'Stanely', 'Kubrick', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'made', 'fraction', '2.2', 'million', 'what', 'had', 'cost', 'make', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', '10.5', 'million', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'darkly', 'satirical', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', '1962', 'novel', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'novel', 'was', 'cathartic', 'novel', 'Burgess', 'who', 'wrote', 'own', 'wife', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'story', 'sort', 'morality', 'tale', 'whereby', 'Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'leader', 'group', 'thugs', 'tables', 'flipped', 'own', 'gang', 'turns', 'later', 'paths', 'had', 'previously', 'done', 'wrong', 'story', 'also', 'issue', 'free-will', 'psychological', 'conditioning', 'Alex', 'aversion', 'therapy', 'good', 'member', 'society', 'loss', 'free-will', 'sense', 'Alex', 'kind', 'clockwork', 'orange', 'organic', 'outside', 'mechanical', 'inside.One', 'major', 'differences', 'movie', 'book', 'was', 'deletion', 'last', 'chapter', 'dealing', 'Alex', 'redemption', 'last', 'chapter', 'however', 'was', 'missing', 'American', 'editions', 'novel', 'prior', '1986', 'Kubrick', 'found', 'out', 'discrepancy', 'when', 'was', 'nearly', 'finished', 'screenplay', 'decided', 'keep', 'out', 'final', 'chapter', 'thought', 'weakened', 'story', 'movie', 'book', 'also', 'invented', 'dialect', 'mixture', 'Russian', 'slavic', 'English', 'Cockney', 'slang', 'Burgess', 'knew', 'linguistic', 'slang', 'was', 'constantly', 'changing', 'so', 'order', 'prevent', 'novel', 'becoming', 'dated', 'chose', 'give', 'narrator', 'unique', 'voice', 'would', 'remain', 'ageless', 'same', 'time', 'reinforcing', 'Alex', 'indifference', 'society', 'norms.This', 'movie', 'distinction', 'being', 'first', 'movie', 'use', 'Dolby', 'Sound', 'system', 'blu-ray', 'PCM', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'been', 'remastered', 'cleaned', 'up', 'presented', '1080p', 'HD', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'are', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Nick', 'Redman', 'documentaries', 'such', 'Return', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Great', 'Bolshy', 'Yarblockos', 'Making', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'excellent', 'career', 'profile', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'O', 'Lucky', 'Malcolm', 'hour', 'long']",N/A

Even though it's not horrible, it's far from as great as I had been led to believe it would be. Had I been alive and able to view this movie when it was first released, I might feel differently. But having heard so much about how this movie is a masterpiece I felt as if I had been somehow misled when I finally got to see it. The first half of the film is almost laughable, from the opening scene of the clearly-in-his-thirties-instead-of-a-teenager Alex with the goofy ""tattoo"" around his right eye and his ""droogs"" sitting at their bar drinking tall glasses of what looks like milk (making these tough ""gang"" members even more laughable) I feared this was going to be pure cheese whiz. The scenes of violence and mayhem are so tame that it's amazing there was so much controversy surrounding this movie. I felt like I was watching a play with a very stilted performance by an unprofessional cast. Let's not forget the ridiculous gang member outfits, complete with codpiece. Although, I suppose they are no less silly than today's baggy-below-the-butt pants.The second half where Alex is sent to prison and then his subsequent time in the program becomes interesting. The messages about good, and wanting to choose good rather than being conditioned to be good are interesting, but the surrounding datedness of the film makes it hard to get any of the movie's more interesting messages about morality.This is the punishment element perhaps...It's pretty clear the doctors have no idea what they are doing.

But when McDowell is captured by the law, tried, and sentenced, in order to get an early release, he undergoes the Ludovico treatment, which is designed to cure him of his impulses toward sex and violence.  The problem is that this politically correct form of brainwashing also cripples him to an extent that he can't defend himself against his former tormentors, who are now out for revenge against him.A CLOCKWORK ORANGE caused a furor over its no-holes-barred sex and violence, which briefly earned it an 'X' rating in America, before Kubrick trimmed it ever so slightly for an 'R'.  But what is far more disturbing than the overt content of the film is its challenging questions.  Is the State really justified in rehabilitating criminals by brainwashing them?  Are people like McDowell's Alex really that much worse than those who would try to get revenge on him?  Is law and order worth squashing free will, even if some of us abuse it?Kubrick raises these questions in his usual challenging fashion, punched up here by his unique uses of classical music pieces, including the second and fourth movements of Beethoven's 9th in ways one never dreamed this piece could be used.  Often scathing in its satire and a definite slap against right-wing politicos on both sides of the Atlantic, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE remains disturbing but compulsive watching even after thrity years.",5,Violence makes violence,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,1795,"['2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'was', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'most', 'affirmative', 'look', 'future', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'definitely', '180-degree', 'turnaround.This', 'still-controversial', 'film', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'equally', 'controversial', '1962', 'novel', 'Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'leader', 'group', 'quot', 'droogs', 'quot', 'idea', 'fun', 'robbing', 'raping', 'beating', 'people', 'senseless', 'London', 'near-future', 'when', 'McDowell', 'captured', 'law', 'tried', 'sentenced', 'order', 'get', 'early', 'release', 'Ludovico', 'treatment', 'designed', 'cure', 'impulses', 'sex', 'violence', 'problem', 'politically', 'correct', 'form', 'brainwashing', 'also', 'extent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'defend', 'former', 'tormentors', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'revenge', 'him.A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'caused', 'furor', 'no-holes-barred', 'sex', 'violence', 'briefly', 'earned', 'X', 'rating', 'America', 'Kubrick', 'trimmed', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'R', 'what', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'overt', 'content', 'film', 'challenging', 'questions', 'State', 'really', 'justified', 'rehabilitating', 'criminals', 'brainwashing', 'Are', 'people', 'McDowell', 'Alex', 'really', 'that', 'much', 'worse', 'who', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'revenge', 'law', 'order', 'worth', 'squashing', 'free', 'will', 'even', 'Kubrick', 'questions', 'usual', 'challenging', 'fashion', 'punched', 'up', 'here', 'unique', 'uses', 'classical', 'music', 'pieces', 'including', 'second', 'fourth', 'movements', 'Beethoven', '9th', 'ways', 'one', 'never', 'dreamed', 'piece', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'Often', 'scathing', 'satire', 'definite', 'slap', 'right-wing', 'politicos', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'disturbing', 'compulsive', 'watching', 'even', 'thrity', 'years']",N/A

From ""Dr. Strangelove"" to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to this, Stanley Kubrick's brilliant directing genius can only be described as producing cinematic high works of art.  Just like in the great ""2001:..."", Kubrick forces you to think about serious issues, stunning and shocking you to come to your own conclusions and to stimulate your senses all the while refusing to tell you what to think.Some may feel Alex got off too easy and for all his major offences against society should be severely punished ala capital punishment and may actually come to this conclusion from watching the film.  Others may actually feel sorry for and happy for Alex that he returns to ""normal"" and that the powers that be get what they deserve with the threat of a loss of power.  Either way, the film disturbs you enough to elicit strong responses making it difficult to remain indifferent or to not have an opinion which is the definition of good modern art.This film could also be a metaphor for thought control and governance asking the question: is it proper to force people to accept an ideology even if they don't truly believe it themselves?  Whether it is Communism or even Capitalism or any religion should people be given a choice which one to go with or should society take all steps to penalise even to the point of using physical pain and suffering to ensure compliance?  It is telling at the end when Alex becomes ""healed"" only when he realises that the very powers that are trying to ""heal"" him are sick and maybe even sicker than he is; a different sort of corruption but corruption nonetheless.This film as time has shown is the true winner of the Oscar for the Best Picture, Director and Actor awards for that year and how ""The French Connection"" won for these categories is beyond belief.  This film is certainly a lot more rewarding on so many levels and has certainly aged a lot better to rank among the best ever films.The great news is that the digital restoration and remastering has been done very well making both the picture and sound quality of this dvd very, very good indeed.  Although the Special Features are nothing to speak about, I'm hoping the newly-released Blu-Ray version will have extras such as making-of and other sorts of documentaries as well.By far a film masterpiece by the great Kubrick and a must-have for every film buff's dvd library.Highly recommended!",5,Shocking!

Well, as we all know, ""Caligula"" is not exactly a masterpiece but it does not make McDowell's work in the movie any less interesting.For me, though, the favorite McDowell's performance is everyman Mick Travis from Lindsay Anderson's stunning ""O Lucky Man!"" the young man with a conquering irresistible smile who just wanted to succeed.I watched ""Clockwork Orange"" a few weeks ago and thought that I would mention Malcolm McDowell.

Most of the films were foreign. At that time a very-highly-acclaimed film was released to the major theaters and that was Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" and it was X rated, amazingly  enough. The X rating was for the violence content not what you might be thinking. Well, it was a pretty violent film at the time but would be pretty mild by today's standards. I was really taken back by the film. It was quite unlike anything I'd seen up to that time and I was talking about it for several years thereafter. Well, I recently found a new ""A Clockwork Orange"" DVD on my favorite bargain rack and I snapped it up in an instant. The film is now just about 40 years old and has held up remarkably well.The basic story in ""A Clockwork Orange"" had to do with a small group of English hoodlums who got their kicks by savagely beating people up and other assorted violence. It was a random and very impersonal striking out and finally they were caught after the leader caused the death of one of his innocent victims and was sent off to prison for an extended period.

85593,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,0790701022,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 1]","Set in the future, ""A Clockwork Orange"" tells the story of Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), a juvenile delinquent whose idea of fun is committing acts of extreme violence. After being arrested for murder, Alex becomes one of the first people to receive ""the treatment"", a process which leads to the recipient becoming nauseated at the very thought of violence.Given that almost 40 years have passed since ""A Clockwork Orange"" was first released, I went into this film expecting to find something that was dated and worth watching purely for historical reasons. Boy, was I wrong. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the few ""classic"" movies that actually deserves its classic status. Everything about this film is truly mind-blowing. Before watching this movie, I had already read the novel upon which it is based, and didn't like it at all (I despised Alex) and I have never been a fan of Kubrick's other works, and yet, I loved every minute of this movie.Although Stanley Kubrick's script is extremely faithful to the novel, the combination of Kubrick's innovative direction; Malcolm McDowell's acting; some of the most imaginative costumes and sets ever; and what is now my favourite score of all time, set this film apart from its source material. Kubrick and McDowell somehow manage to make Alex simultaneously frightening and likeable (quite an achievement, considering that Alex is one of the vilest characters ever created) and I am astounded that McDowell performance wasn't nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. I am even more astounded that, of the Oscars this film was nominated for (including Best Picture and Best Director), it didn't win any - ""The French Connection"" took most of the Oscars that year.

The message from Anthony Burgess' novel is all there in Stanley Kubrick's movie. Burgess once said that misery and suffering are  the price of freedom. What he meant was, goodness is a virtue that is  chosen.What if everyone in the world was good? Can people really  appreciate goodness if they have no knowledge of evil? If there was no  darkness, could people understand what light is? If everyone was good it  wouldn't be something chosen by their own free will. If people can't choose  then they're not really free. Gandhi wasn't born good, Hitler wasn't born  evil. These men chose the way they led their lives and acted  accordingly.The same applies with Alex. Alex doesn't commit crime  because he needs money. He doesn't live in poverty. He is violent because  he enjoys it. When he is arrested he is forced to be good. This treatment  works, at the cost of Alex's freedom. Alex's acts of &quot;goodness&quot;  are not done out of kindness or nobility, they are desparate reactions to  nausea at the thought of violence.None of Burgess' message is lost in  Kubrick's film, except for the ending. The film is full of irony and black  humour, but the violence is only a superficial part of the story. The all-  important message is freedom of choice.

85600,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,0790701022,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[5, 5]","I saw this film when I was in high school (I tricked my mother into renting it for me...she's so sweet), and I have never forgotten it. It's always a toss up between this film and 2001: A Space Odyssey over which Kubrick film is better (2001 is winning right now).  It was a bit heady for a high school teen (even one like me who was already searching out intelligent cinema), but I always thought it was a masterpiece.  Many people talk (and talk) about its violence, and they usually miss the satire and the sadness of the story.  McDowell gives his best performance ever, and Kubrick proves why he is the master that he is.  You feel real empathy for Alex, despite his being a monster (or just a man who embraces his dark nature).  I feel that there's an actual point to all the violence in the film.  Just one small quip: I didn't like the trough scene (even though upon further reflection, it is an ironic scene in that Alex attacked Dim and Georgie earlier in the film at a marina filled with dirty water).  There's no way Alex would have been able to hold his breath under the water because he gets sick whenever violence is done upon him.Most people who see the film love this film for the violence, and ignore the substance of the film.  I am not one for liking films that are just violent for violence sake.  The film is a film of ideas as well as emotions.  It's about free will, the power of the state, the true nature of man, etc., etc..  It's another challenging piece of cinema from one of the greatest directors of all time.  Amazingly, the film was shot almost exclusively on location in the UK.  There were only 4 sets built (the milkbar, a mirrored hall, a mirrored bathroom, and the prison reception area).  All of the supporting performances are excellent (with special mention going to Anthony Sharp as the Minister of the Interior, Michael Bates as the Chief Guard, Patrick Magee as the writer, and Warren Clarke as Dim).  Most of you probably know this already, but the huge man servant that the writer has later in the film is David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the first 3 Star Wars films.  And let's not forget Philip Stone, an actor who appeared in 3 Kubrick films (perhaps a record, there are many actors who appeared here that appeared in other Kubrick pictures, like 2001 and Barry Lyndon).  Another aspect of this film I love is that it's so quinessentially British.  If you didn't know Kubrick was an American, you'd swear it was directed by an Englishman. O nly a handful of films have done that, where the director immerses himself so much in a foreign culture that his film makes you think he's lived there his whole life.  Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are like that.  They were so quinessentially Russian and Swedish films, despite being directed by a Japanese man and a Russian man.This 2 disc edition has some fascinating extras, including a great documentary called Still Tickin':  The Return of Clockwork Orange.  Sam Mendes (director of American Beauty) is one of the commentators, and he says this film is remarkable because Kubrick really trusts the audience, and that most directors don't do that today.  Never in the film is there any attempt to sentimentalize or moralise in any way.  Kubrick makes no moral judgements here, which increases the film's power.  There is also commentary by Alex himself, Malcolm McDowell.  He shares the good times and the bad times, but all with great affection.  He had a minor falling out with Kubrick after this film, but that seems to have dissipated.This is still a deeply unsettling, scary, thought provoking film, one that deserves every accolade it gets.",5,"Still valid, still brilliant, etc., etc..",1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,3670,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'tricked', 'mother', 'renting', 'so', 'sweet', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'always', 'toss', 'up', 'film', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'better', '2001', 'winning', 'right', 'now', 'was', 'bit', 'heady', 'high', 'school', 'teen', 'even', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'searching', 'out', 'intelligent', 'cinema', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'Many', 'people', 'talk', 'talk', 'violence', 'usually', 'miss', 'satire', 'sadness', 'story', 'McDowell', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'Kubrick', 'why', 'master', 'feel', 'real', 'empathy', 'Alex', 'being', 'monster', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'dark', 'nature', 'feel', 'actual', 'point', 'violence', 'film', 'Just', 'one', 'small', 'quip', 'did', ""n't"", 'trough', 'scene', 'even', 'further', 'reflection', 'ironic', 'scene', 'Alex', 'attacked', 'Dim', 'Georgie', 'earlier', 'film', 'marina', 'filled', 'dirty', 'water', 'way', 'Alex', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'hold', 'breath', 'water', 'sick', 'whenever', 'violence', 'done', 'him.Most', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'love', 'film', 'violence', 'ignore', 'substance', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'liking', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'violent', 'violence', 'sake', 'film', 'film', 'ideas', 'as', 'well', 'emotions', 'free', 'will', 'power', 'state', 'true', 'nature', 'man', 'etc.', 'etc..', 'challenging', 'piece', 'cinema', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'Amazingly', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'location', 'UK', 'were', 'only', '4', 'sets', 'built', 'milkbar', 'mirrored', 'hall', 'mirrored', 'bathroom', 'prison', 'reception', 'area', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'special', 'mention', 'going', 'Anthony', 'Sharp', 'Minister', 'Interior', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'Chief', 'Guard', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'writer', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'Dim', 'Most', 'probably', 'know', 'already', 'huge', 'man', 'servant', 'writer', 'later', 'film', 'David', 'Prowse', 'who', 'played', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'first', '3', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Philip', 'Stone', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', '3', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'perhaps', 'record', 'are', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'here', 'that', 'appeared', 'other', 'Kubrick', 'pictures', '2001', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'aspect', 'film', 'love', 'so', 'quinessentially', 'British', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'American', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'directed', 'Englishman', 'O', 'nly', 'handful', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'where', 'director', 'so', 'much', 'foreign', 'culture', 'film', 'think', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'Kurosawa', 'Dersu', 'Uzala', 'Tarkovsky', 'Sacrifice', 'are', 'were', 'so', 'quinessentially', 'Russian', 'Swedish', 'films', 'being', 'directed', 'Japanese', 'man', 'Russian', 'man.This', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'fascinating', 'extras', 'including', 'great', 'documentary', 'called', 'Still', 'Tickin', 'Return', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'director', 'American', 'Beauty', 'one', 'commentators', 'film', 'remarkable', 'Kubrick', 'really', 'audience', 'most', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'today', 'Never', 'film', 'there', 'attempt', 'sentimentalize', 'moralise', 'way', 'Kubrick', 'moral', 'judgements', 'here', 'film', 'power', 'also', 'commentary', 'Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'shares', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'great', 'affection', 'had', 'minor', 'falling', 'out', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'have', 'dissipated.This', 'still', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'scary', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'one', 'accolade']",N/A

Taking it away from a human being means making him less than human. &quot;When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man!&quot; - the prison chaplain puts it this way.When you watch the first shot of this movie you can't not be intrigued and wait to see what follows: it opens on Alex's face while the camera slowly pulls back accompanied by an eerie synthetized music and narration on the part of Alex. He and his droogs are sitting there on a drugged-up milk bar, drinking and thinking of what will be the evening's ultra violence programme. It's a beatifully shot scene, with some bright vivid colors of red, blue, orange and white.But my favourite scene and, I guess, the key to the movie is the one where Alex is injected with a drug that is supposed to make him immune to violent acts of any kind while he's forced to watch violent films footage with his eyelids propped up and in a straight jacket as he slowly changes into someone else, forced to watch images of violence accompanied by Ludwig Van's music.Once the &quot;cure&quot; is complete, he's put to some rude tests as, laid down to the ground, he is told to lick someone's shoe and he obeys; he throws up when a topless woman walks up to him. He's no longer able to defend himself - he's now nauseous to sex or violence of any kind, simply because he has been conditionned towards violence and has no choice anymore. He is a programmed human being at this point.I was intrigued and somewhat shocked when I first watched this movie many years ago, but as almost with every Kubrick movie, once is barely enough. Then I watched it over and over again and I couldn't help thinking that Kubrick was pointing his finger at the bases of the community - parents, family, school, religion - and at last but not least at the politicians who, not seeming to have an idea of how to deal with youth violence at all, they abuse and use Alex for their political ambitions. It seems that the community has started to crumble, that the streets are overrun by teenage gangs and that parents have no control at all over their children and that they're constantly and easily manipulated and outwitted by them (have fun at the factory, mom!).We have seen so many antiheroes in the cinema history so far but Alex de Large is probably the most sympathetic, complex, vicious and intelligent of them all, and Mc Dowell's performance is certainly one of the best of all Kubrick's movie - a milestone on the history of acting. &quot;I was cured all right&quot; - is the last line of the movie, but we have strong doubts about that and can't help thinking that the good old Alex is back.",5,the quintessence of dehumanizing cinema!,1007078400,"11 30, 2001",2001,2729,"['Violence', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'life', 'eternal', 'inherently', 'human', 'characteristic', 'Taking', 'away', 'human', 'being', 'means', 'making', 'less', 'human', 'quot', 'When', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'choose', 'be', 'man', 'quot', 'prison', 'chaplain', 'watch', 'first', 'shot', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'be', 'intrigued', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Alex', 'face', 'camera', 'slowly', 'back', 'accompanied', 'eerie', 'synthetized', 'music', 'narration', 'part', 'Alex', 'droogs', 'are', 'sitting', 'there', 'drugged-up', 'milk', 'bar', 'drinking', 'thinking', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'evening', 'ultra', 'violence', 'programme', 'beatifully', 'shot', 'scene', 'bright', 'vivid', 'colors', 'red', 'blue', 'orange', 'white.But', 'favourite', 'scene', 'guess', 'key', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'Alex', 'injected', 'drug', 'supposed', 'make', 'immune', 'violent', 'acts', 'kind', 'forced', 'watch', 'violent', 'films', 'footage', 'eyelids', 'propped', 'up', 'straight', 'jacket', 'changes', 'someone', 'else', 'forced', 'watch', 'images', 'violence', 'accompanied', 'Ludwig', 'Van', 'music.Once', 'quot', 'cure', 'quot', 'complete', 'put', 'rude', 'tests', 'laid', 'down', 'ground', 'told', 'lick', 'someone', 'shoe', 'obeys', 'up', 'when', 'topless', 'woman', 'up', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'defend', 'now', 'nauseous', 'sex', 'violence', 'kind', 'simply', 'been', 'conditionned', 'towards', 'violence', 'choice', 'anymore', 'programmed', 'human', 'being', 'point.I', 'was', 'intrigued', 'somewhat', 'shocked', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'almost', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'once', 'barely', 'enough', 'Then', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'pointing', 'finger', 'bases', 'community', 'parents', 'family', 'school', 'religion', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'politicians', 'who', 'not', 'seeming', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'deal', 'youth', 'violence', 'abuse', 'use', 'Alex', 'political', 'ambitions', 'community', 'started', 'crumble', 'streets', 'are', 'overrun', 'teenage', 'gangs', 'parents', 'have', 'control', 'children', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'outwitted', 'have', 'fun', 'factory', 'mom', '.We', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'antiheroes', 'cinema', 'history', 'so', 'far', 'Alex', 'de', 'Large', 'probably', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'complex', 'vicious', 'intelligent', 'Mc', 'Dowell', 'performance', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'milestone', 'history', 'acting', 'quot', 'was', 'cured', 'all', 'right', 'quot', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'have', 'strong', 'doubts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'good', 'old', 'Alex', 'back']",N/A

The bizarre future and the excellent usage of Beethoven as well as the strange ideas, scene portrayed and sexuality are...unique.  It's hard to speak of this movie to someone who's never seen it.  If you like simple, modern movies, and do not view movies as a form of art and more so as Adam Sandler entertainment, then stop reading right now, click the back button and forget you ever heard of Stanly Kubrick.  If you do like these artistic movies, and/or are a type of film maker yourself, then you must see this movie.  The primitive rape scenes seem awkward, but that's because you are supposed to feel awkward.  Upon release, the movie got an X (NC-17) rating because of its intense scenes of brutality and rape, but now they might appear as laughable but only in the nervous laughter sort of way that only serves to comfort ourselves.  So the movie is dated, but it's still extremely strong and makes you think as to how far the legal system will go to keep citizens in line.  I'm giving the movie four stars because it's a great film, though it's not for everyone.  It's a great film by far, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  For example, I probably wouldn't watch this more than once a year, though I am very glad I've seen this film.  See this film if you like art and a unique story.

There is no real moral base he seeks to induce from his films and this is possibly why this movie is such an enjoyable watch.(i might be wrong i should add cause this was my first watch) For all those, who seek humor from this movie and enjoyed Clockwork Orange just for the humor bit,friends,I dare say, you don't deserve to watch films of this high a statute. Without trying to sound too much like a prude, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is gripping,unabrasive,interesting and big yet not ready for an immediate second watch.The characters in the film are few and simple, the dialogue writing is of supreme nature and the sets are extraordinarily rich with chaos and flamboyance of color. The first fifteen minutes of the film brought quite a jolt of shock to me owing to the graphic nature depicted. Interestingly enough, the main character is a huge Beethoven fan and has a life without pauses and limits. WHERE THE FILM SCORES FULL MARKS is in the character of Alex,who is one easy to dislike rodent.Somehow his narration is extremely likeable.Second most interesting character in this film would be the old man on the wheel chair and his crazy fatigued lifestyle. Everyone in this movie other than Alex is dislikeable as far as storyline makes you beleive. My favourite scene in the film would have to be a choice between Alexander's moodshift when he's sent to prison and his torture scenes OR the beginning of the movie where his rather scarily determined eyes pierce the watcher.Overall, I wouldnt be shameful enough to rate this.

85606,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,0790701022,H. Jin,"[6, 7]","Antony Burgess' novel `A Clockwork Orange' is in many ways the perfect vehicle for Stanley Kubrick. It contained many of the usual Kubrick themes (individual vs the organisation, morally ambiguous characters, dehumanisation), and no doubt someone like Kubrick would have appreciated the novel's subversive content. So it's no surprise that Kubrick does a great job of translating the novel to the screen, although it does contain one significant flaw.Kubrick once again nails the technical aspects of the film. There is an unsettling use of close-ups, such as the very opening shot, or the author when he realises who Alex is. Unable to shield the violence with unique language (as Burgess did), Kubrick takes the edge off the most intense scenes with a choreographed, even surreal, approach. Generally, the film closely follows the novel (with the one major exception discussed below), makes use of Nadsat slang in the narration, and the set design mirrors Burgess' deliberately anachronistic setting.The cast, too, do an excellent job. Malcolm McDowell, a talented but inconsistent actor, was born to play anti-hero Alex, and his outstanding performance carries the film.  Reportedly, McDowell suffered quite a few injuries such as scratched corneas and near-drowning, all in the name of realism. Despite this being basically a one-man show, there are also entertaining cameos from Aubrey Morris as Mr Deltoid and Michael Bates as the prison warden.The ""major flaw"", of course, is that the final chapter from Burgess' novel in which Alex matures and decides to end his violent ways, is omitted. This was not Kubrick's fault, it was a decision by the US publisher, but the reality is that it destroys the whole point of the book. The darker ""I was cured all right!"" ending probably fits better with Kubrick's vision, but means that Alex has not developed at all through the course of the film. Despite all he has experienced, he ends up back where he started. As such, Burgess' emotionally complex novel about growth and maturity becomes a bleak and cynical dystopian film, where there is little hope for the future.Altering the message in this way does hurt the film, and it is impossible for fans of the novel to overlook this. For this reason, I can't really give it five stars. However, in nearly every other aspect this film succeeds, and it will certainly impress fans of Kubrick's other films.",4,Brilliant movie with one major flaw,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2401,"['Antony', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'many', 'ways', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'contained', 'many', 'usual', 'Kubrick', 'themes', 'individual', 'organisation', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'characters', 'dehumanisation', 'doubt', 'someone', 'Kubrick', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'novel', 'subversive', 'content', 'surprise', 'Kubrick', 'great', 'job', 'translating', 'novel', 'screen', 'contain', 'one', 'significant', 'flaw.Kubrick', 'once', 'again', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'unsettling', 'use', 'close-ups', 'such', 'very', 'opening', 'shot', 'author', 'when', 'who', 'Alex', 'Unable', 'shield', 'violence', 'unique', 'language', 'Burgess', 'did', 'Kubrick', 'edge', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'choreographed', 'even', 'surreal', 'approach', 'Generally', 'film', 'closely', 'novel', 'one', 'major', 'exception', 'discussed', 'use', 'Nadsat', 'slang', 'narration', 'set', 'design', 'mirrors', 'Burgess', 'deliberately', 'anachronistic', 'setting.The', 'cast', 'too', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'talented', 'inconsistent', 'actor', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'anti-hero', 'Alex', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'film', 'Reportedly', 'McDowell', 'suffered', 'quite', 'few', 'injuries', 'such', 'scratched', 'corneas', 'near-drowning', 'name', 'realism', 'being', 'basically', 'one-man', 'show', 'are', 'also', 'entertaining', 'cameos', 'Aubrey', 'Morris', 'Mr', 'Deltoid', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'prison', 'major', 'flaw', 'course', 'final', 'chapter', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'Alex', 'matures', 'end', 'violent', 'ways', 'omitted', 'was', 'not', 'Kubrick', 'fault', 'was', 'decision', 'US', 'publisher', 'reality', 'whole', 'point', 'book', 'darker', 'was', 'cured', 'all', 'right', 'ending', 'probably', 'fits', 'better', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'Alex', 'not', 'developed', 'course', 'film', 'experienced', 'up', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'such', 'Burgess', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'novel', 'growth', 'maturity', 'bleak', 'cynical', 'dystopian', 'film', 'where', 'little', 'hope', 'future.Altering', 'message', 'way', 'hurt', 'film', 'impossible', 'fans', 'novel', 'overlook', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'nearly', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'impress', 'fans', 'Kubrick', 'other', 'films']",N/A
85607,A1KLNYFROE90OV,0790701022,Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...,"[0, 0]","Okay, here's another review that I'm doing for a new friend of mine. He has made some suggestions for my reviews and I'm trying out different kinds of reviewing styles to impress him with my versatilty. You should have seen my last review for him! A rare new style was born for you people reading. Pure Tuttleman. Okay, anyways for this review here, I'm going to innovate yet ANOTHER new style. I will call it: The Live The Movie Review-Style! Never heard of THAT one, huh? Well of COURSE you haven't! This is it's debut. Okay, the movie is called The Clockwork Orange, which I guess sounds interesting. It conjures up a thought-dream of a piece of fruit with all sorts of gears and wires making it do things. Okay, Bosco has returned with the DVD and I'm ready to ""Live the Movie""!Okay here it goes. I'm wearing an all white uniform and have a silly hat on...I'm with 2 guys with the same costumes as me...I think I'm the one in the middle...we are at a kind of department-store with lots of mannequins...I'm talking slowly and strangely.Now we are driving in my convertable, dangerously irresponsibly. Now we are walking around talking to a singing bum. We beat him up because he probably did something bad to us.... OKAY, hold on, hold on. This is Howard again, guys. Give me around 20 or more minutes and I'll just watch and then I'll catch you up on what I did in the movie. If I don't do this then the review will be very long. Hang on.Okay, wow....me and my friends just went around doing WHATEVER we wanted to ANYBODY. We got in gang fights, we broke into houses and beat people up while I, uh sang show-tunes I guess. At home everything is cool....I have a house of the future. Incredible. There's a guy in a suit that is a real jerk to me though....I hate him. I go to the music store in a kind of cape or cloak of some kind....Now for some reason I beat my friends up with a stick. Whack! BAM! You could tell they deserved it. (Hey guys, Howard here again. Well, my new life is pretty fantastic in my movie. No one can stop me. I'm getting new ideas for my life out-side of the movie. Resume)I fought 2 girls that I met at the cd store too earlier. I can do whatever I want. Now we are burglarizing a mansion...I just killed a cat-lady with a ceramic canoe! Time to escape! .....WHAT?! I HAVE BEEN BETRAYED!! My jerk-friends hit me in the face with a milk-bottle of all things! Ugh. I new something bad was bound to happen. Now I'm probably going to plot my revenge. Excellent. NO!! I've been sent to jail! Come ON!! Well at least the look on my face and my attitude say ""I have an escape plan"". It won't be long now.Okay, it's me, Howard, once more. I'm going to sit back and watch while I'm in jail. As soon as I escape I will resume writing.How fantastic! I'm being released! I'm quite pleased with how this turned out. All I had to do was listen to music and watch movies all day. I pretended not to like this, and their reverse psychology failed, so they let me go! I beat the system! I'm free to go back out and do whatever I want again!Okay, I went around and got sick and did boring things. Yeah, yeah, when does the good stuff pick back up for me? Oooooh, I met up with my betrayers. They beat the crap out of me and tried to drown me to death. I really don't like how things are going for me. Whoa! I jumped out of a window! I guess I make pretty bad descisions sometimes. The credits are rolling on this amazing chapter in my life.Okay guys, Howard here for the ""in conclusion"". Talk about inspiring! In my movie I just lived how I really want to in my non-movie life! This was a revelation for me. I would love to be able to do anything I want in this life. The guy in the movie sure could! Now I'm not neccessarily saying that I'm going to go out and do all the things I did in my movie, but I'm pretty pumped-up right now. No more listening to people, no more worrying about what's going to happen. Doing without thinking. I will just do whatever I want at any time. Things are going to change in the life of Howard.Wow guys, I'm just getting better all the time. This review served multiple purposes. Number one, I reviewed at a friend's request, showing my versatility once again. Number two, I innovated yet ANOTHER new form of reviewing: The Live the Movie Review-style"". Fascinating. And 3rd and most importantly it inspired me in ways you cannot imagine. I learned. The movie made me realize that basically, anybody can say or do anything they want. I mean, really think about it. You can technically SAY anything. I mean ANYTHING, right? People might not like it, but you can. If you can think it, you can say it. And as long as you can physically do something, you can do it. Sure, some people might not like it, but who cares? If there are consequences, you can do whatever you want to beat them. This guy in the movie made me realize this when I was seeing through his eyes in his movie. I'm going to look for more movies he's in on amazon.com. I'm going to try to learn all I can for my new life-style and attitude. This guy truly insprired me. He is an amazing man.

85608,A1QP5VCWEL1LHD,0790701022,"Humberto Mejia ""Still alive and kicking""","[0, 0]","This is  review on the movie not the dvd product- No qualifications whatsover as cinema criticI would use this movie for a forum that would explore the concept of evil and to force us to reflect is evil control is not by itself an evil concept as well... therefore this review will embark on a course of reasoning that I think this movie leads to.The movie is psychoelic and very close in its use of the english language as a dr. Suss story. It a critical satyre of a society that permits the rampage of a quarter of unescrupulous hoodlums to take their nights of criminal savagery upon the innocents, which are us all... this was for me the most powerful message, the innocents are in the mercy of the random violents... random is closely related to the way a society also views what liberty is about.. the movie is based on a psychodellic London of the 60s, where new urban developments have shown it fast deteriorating aspects as they were too alien for its inhabitants, but where freedom and non intervention on individuals was the overriding credo... this created a gap, an opportunity window for the criminals to ride on.That the violents can operate in any society? well yes, all societies have their underworlds, but the more tyranical the less of an opportunity for the random violent happy groups to attack the innocent...I remember a chinese taxicab drive in Adelaide, Australia who complained that police there were too soft and considerate on controlling crime compared to China...on the other side, the growing presence of ruthless street gangs that are taking over the cities of the USA is in a way a social manifestation that the enphasis has been put on creating a liberal society and deterring the offenders by severity of the law, something that has obviously failed (if internal crime were treated as terrorist acts, as they should be, we would see a stop this senseless violence soon)... do I preach a totalitarian state that will help us have freedom and security for us all?... in a way yes, there is no denying that many of us would like to see law officers ride the wave of the Terroist Act and use it to wipe off a series of undesirables.. if by now you are saying: this guy is full of croc!! - then you are at the zenith point that this movie pursues.One of the hoodlums, that amid his criminal psychopathic mind, can still have the paradoxical ability to adore, no, to worship the music of Beethoven.. has been cought and is in  prison, he volunteers in a pyschological experiment that supresses his ability to react violently... he is thrown back to society, yes, that same liberal society he injured so much... I am not giving anything away for hose who have not seen it, but for those that have and keep on seeing it because of its mordid captivation, this fellow goes through a pathos of karma.. while this ought to feel good, and it does, it is the bleeding heart liberals who were victims of his crime the ones that eventually expose the experiment as sign that the establisment is trying to control individual self determination.It take stomach and brain to see this movie, its is spoken in british 60s lingo so I must confess I am at loss here...",5,Evil is out there its pure and brutal- pray that it does not find you,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,3182,"['review', 'movie', 'not', 'dvd', 'product-', 'No', 'qualifications', 'whatsover', 'cinema', 'criticI', 'would', 'use', 'movie', 'forum', 'would', 'explore', 'concept', 'evil', 'force', 'reflect', 'evil', 'control', 'not', 'evil', 'concept', 'as', 'well', 'therefore', 'review', 'will', 'embark', 'course', 'reasoning', 'think', 'movie', 'to.The', 'movie', 'psychoelic', 'very', 'close', 'use', 'english', 'language', 'dr.', 'Suss', 'story', 'critical', 'satyre', 'society', 'rampage', 'quarter', 'unescrupulous', 'hoodlums', 'take', 'nights', 'criminal', 'savagery', 'innocents', 'are', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'message', 'innocents', 'are', 'mercy', 'random', 'violents', 'random', 'closely', 'related', 'way', 'society', 'also', 'what', 'liberty', 'movie', 'based', 'psychodellic', 'London', '60s', 'where', 'new', 'urban', 'developments', 'have', 'shown', 'fast', 'deteriorating', 'aspects', 'were', 'too', 'alien', 'inhabitants', 'where', 'freedom', 'non', 'intervention', 'individuals', 'was', 'overriding', 'credo', 'created', 'gap', 'opportunity', 'window', 'criminals', 'ride', 'violents', 'can', 'operate', 'society', 'well', 'yes', 'societies', 'have', 'underworlds', 'more', 'tyranical', 'less', 'opportunity', 'random', 'violent', 'happy', 'groups', 'attack', 'innocent', 'remember', 'chinese', 'taxicab', 'drive', 'Adelaide', 'Australia', 'who', 'complained', 'police', 'were', 'too', 'soft', 'considerate', 'controlling', 'crime', 'compared', 'China', 'other', 'side', 'growing', 'presence', 'ruthless', 'street', 'gangs', 'are', 'taking', 'cities', 'USA', 'way', 'social', 'manifestation', 'enphasis', 'been', 'put', 'creating', 'liberal', 'society', 'deterring', 'offenders', 'severity', 'law', 'something', 'obviously', 'failed', 'internal', 'crime', 'were', 'treated', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'should', 'be', 'would', 'see', 'stop', 'senseless', 'violence', 'soon', 'do', 'preach', 'totalitarian', 'state', 'will', 'help', 'have', 'freedom', 'security', 'way', 'yes', 'denying', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'law', 'officers', 'ride', 'wave', 'Terroist', 'Act', 'use', 'wipe', 'off', 'series', 'undesirables..', 'now', 'are', 'saying', 'guy', 'full', 'croc', 'then', 'are', 'zenith', 'point', 'movie', 'pursues.One', 'hoodlums', 'criminal', 'psychopathic', 'mind', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'paradoxical', 'ability', 'adore', 'worship', 'music', 'Beethoven..', 'been', 'cought', 'prison', 'pyschological', 'experiment', 'ability', 'react', 'violently', 'thrown', 'back', 'society', 'yes', 'same', 'liberal', 'society', 'injured', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'hose', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'have', 'keep', 'seeing', 'mordid', 'captivation', 'fellow', 'pathos', 'karma..', 'ought', 'feel', 'good', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberals', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'crime', 'ones', 'eventually', 'expose', 'experiment', 'sign', 'establisment', 'trying', 'control', 'individual', 'self', 'determination.It', 'take', 'stomach', 'brain', 'see', 'movie', 'spoken', 'british', '60s', 'lingo', 'so', 'must', 'confess', 'am', 'loss', 'here']",N/A

85610,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,0790701022,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[8, 9]","Allow me to preface this review with some personal information.  I am an ordained Fundamentalist minister.  I think movies put in too much sex and violence.Then why am I giving this movie 5 stars, or even admitting I watched this movie?  After all, there is plenty of violence, sex, and nudity in it; I actually believe it was originally rated X, and downgraded to an R in the early '80's.My rating does not mean I think everyone should see this movie.  It is definitely for adults; I would be uneasy for teenagers to see this movie even if with a parent present.  This is definitely not a movie to show at church as some churches do with the Andy Griffith Show.If you mean by ""a good movie"" that it was well directed and written, worthy to be recognized by the Movie Academy as a piece of art, this qualifies.  The direction is very effective, and Malcolm McDowell's performance is charismatic and memorable.  Additionally, this movie made #2 on the list of movies that create the most discussion (I believe ""The Passion Of The Christ"" took over #1).While this is not a ""Christian movie"", I have found some themes in this movie that are compatible with Scripture.  These include:1. ""There is a path that seems right to a man, but that way leads to death.""  (Proverbs 14:12)2. ""Be not deceived; God is not mocked:  for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.""  (Galatians 6:7)3. This movie deals with the issue of predetermination and free will, with a clergyman pointing out the importance of free will.4.

I didnt origionally have interest in the movie at all after reading it, but after hearing countless great things from ""genious"" to ""cult classic"" I had to see it. I wasnt dissappointed but there were a few things that really bothered me that keep this movie from getting 5 stars from me.Now obviously they had to change a few things for the movie (because 7 year old girls cant be raped on screen, thats messed up) So expect little things like that to be different. But the one huge thing that bothered me was the entire part where Alex finds the book-in-progress 'A Clockwork Orange' and then proceeds to destroy it, this appears later in the book when Alex realizes the meaning and uses it to defend himself. As well, its the TITLE OF THE MOVIE and yet its never even mentioned. Thats the huge things that bothered me, it loses a star just for that.Other things changed/missing are things like Alex's experiences inside the jail cell with his prisonmates, the changing of weapons that each droog had (with the exception of Dim). And plenty of other little things that can mostly be looked over, The only other big thing that bothered me was how the movie left out the real ending of the book. The movie goes by the old american version of the book which leaves out chapter 21. So the movie leaves a lot tot he imagination at the end.Overall though, if you can look past the things I mentioned its actually a very interesting, entertaining, and even funny movie.

85617,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790701022,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 3]","This film is banned or at least has been banned for many years in Great Britain because it cuts deep into the political fabric of British society. It shows what ultraviolence is for some young teenagers in England : an entertainment in a society where being entertained is necessarily realizing deep and not so unconscious impulses and drives. These young people all seem to carry some Shakespearian Richard III in them. But the main, object of the film is to show how the political system of the country uses this violence and these violent teenagers to promote their power, to win their elections, to impose their visions and manipulate public opinion. It is true that they can easily use the family structure that is both permissive and cold, and even rejects the young. They can easily use the social services that are supposed to help and protect young people but who are a nest of perverts and ambitious mediocre social-climbers who prefer playing with their fantasms to solving the problems they are supposed to solve. They can count on the prison system who has only one objective : to humiliate the prisoners and to live in a dream of domination and power over helpless inmates. They can also count on the press and the media that do not look for truth, or do not assume their mind-building duty or mission, but only look for sensational news to sell as many copies as possible, to attract as many viewers as possible. So politicians can easily manipulate this press and these media and hence public opinion, provided the news they provide them with are pungent and hefty enough to shock benevolence and indifference. This film is a caustic satire of modern English society. But furthermore, it is the most beautiful and powerful musical film since the whole film is entirely accompanied by classical music showing how strongly this classical music speaks to young people, and to us, and how it conveys and means so many violent feelings and frustrations in them. We may think Ludwig van Beethoven is a little old-fashioned in that line. But yet it gets such a marvellous new life in the film by the association of the last movement of the ninth symphony with every moment of the film, giving to that music at least ten or a dozen different meanings. Classical music is first of all and before all a music that can take any meaning we want provided we invest it into the situation that will bring this meaning into the picture.

85618,A3HSA7050DR9UG,0790701022,"Jake ""jaker5064""","[5, 7]","There's something huge in this film that goes beyond any sort of rational explanation. If you can force yourself to watch the film past the first 15 minutes (and believe me, the big starting sequence of that one night that is NOT for the squeamish), then you'll see the utter sadist nature of little Alex, a Tom Sawyer-type who likes to play hooky and constantly get laid. However, though his wild behavior may not be completely distant of real life juvenile delinquency, he takes it too far, and his three-man gang betrays him and leaves him for the cops. Then through the next few years of Alex's life, he is shoved around by the society that he so happily kicked and ""malchocked"".Even though this was, and perhaps still is, the most shockingly sadistic film ever made, that only seems to accentuate the character's horrible treatments in ""The Ludovico Technique"" and his family's abandonment afterwards. While he's portrayed as the class punk who went down a terrible road, you may actually feel pity for Alex as he's surrounded by fellow inmates of the adult world (he does go to prison) and abused just as badly as he abused people. He is the ultimate creation of the political Frankenstein: a brainwashed human being treated like an animal. He's the bad guy, and in society's eyes he will always be the bad guy, so revenge is taken by even the people that once loved him the most. I haven't read the book, though I'm sure at one point I will, but the story can be even thought of as being Shakespearean, which you'll see why in the very first lines of dialouge. The language of Alex is so profoundly bASs-awKArDs in a thick Welsh dialect that you may need to watch it a few times with the subtitles to understand just what the hell everyone's saying!The title of this review is made in reference to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", because if you want to make a modern day connection then it would certainly be the best one to make. Both films were nominated for numerous Academy Awards but instead got the shaft, both were extremely controversial when released, and both deal with the morality of the choices we make. Any way you look at it, this is a DEEP film.As for the DVD itself, there's a nice 5.1 remastered soundtrack, but a disappointing 1.66:1 widescreen ratio that's okay but could've been better.Even though this is a strong drama, there's also some comedic relief that can be taken as funny, in a slightly twisted way. Some other good recommendations would be Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" made a few years after this, or the more recent ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". I've always liked to see movies that go beyond the boundaries of safety and Hollywood crap (like the Matrix sequels, for example), because that means that there's still some people left in Tinseltown with some b**** left to make shockingly real films. While there's real and there's just mindless barbarics, at least Stanley gave this one a little thought and used the questionalable ethics as a tool for accentuation of the story (because in all honesty, he could've cut that choice scene differently but probably felt the story needed that emotional jolt) R.I.P., Stanley Kubrick.

I won't discuss its merits as movie.  CWO has a lot of similarities in its treatment of anarchy and violence as Brad Pitt in Fight Club, yet Fight Club is less controversial?I was too young to see CWO's theatrical release.  But since, I've seen it on various tape versions, DVD and finally BD, as a fan of Kubrick's cinema style.This movie is stellar in BD.  I never really thought much of CWO but on BD, the framing of scenes and high resolution detail reveal subtleties that make visuals speak in strong visceral prose like no version before it [could also be remastering?], and the audio is beyond all prior CWO scores on record, tape, CD or its DVD.  The subtitles are tack sharp on BD, making for a much more pleasant experience, helping viewers understand droog speak, or ""nadsat"", yes, yes?For example, as McDowall's character Alex peruses records in a shop, one can make out clearly titles and liner notes on some covers.  Alex's face show subtle changes as blood flows and ebbs into his skin, and shows how McDowall's acted [ or directed ] with frightening zest.  Violent scenes of rape and assault appear more play acting or dance moves, as actors use exaggerated movements and victims almost are almost never bruised or bloodied, despite the pounding, compare this to similar themed and recent movies like Fight Club.The clear crisp BD sound track makes it far easier to discern the nadsat words that at times were garbled in old analog transmission, broadcast TV, VHS, beta, and less on DVD.  However, watching the movie with subtitles is less distracting on a large TV in the better font of BD.The music was a revelation.  I never cared for Wendy [credited as Walter prior to her sex change]  Carlos's music, sometimes the synthesizer sound gave me headaches.  But somehow, the BD version is so much smoother and richer in overtones compared to modern digital synthesizers, I actually enjoyed listening to her.",5,CWO shines in blu-ray,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,2032,"['are', 'plethora', 'reviews', 'movie', 'review', 'mostly', 'comparison', 'BD', 'vs', 'DVD', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'merits', 'movie', 'CWO', 'lot', 'similarities', 'treatment', 'anarchy', 'violence', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Fight', 'Club', 'yet', 'Fight', 'Club', 'less', 'controversial', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'CWO', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'various', 'tape', 'versions', 'DVD', 'finally', 'BD', 'fan', 'Kubrick', 'cinema', 'style.This', 'movie', 'stellar', 'BD', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'much', 'CWO', 'BD', 'framing', 'scenes', 'high', 'resolution', 'detail', 'reveal', 'subtleties', 'make', 'visuals', 'speak', 'strong', 'visceral', 'prose', 'version', '[', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'remastering', ']', 'audio', 'prior', 'CWO', 'scores', 'record', 'tape', 'CD', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'are', 'tack', 'sharp', 'BD', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'helping', 'viewers', 'understand', 'droog', 'speak', 'nadsat', 'yes', 'yes', 'example', 'McDowall', 'character', 'Alex', 'records', 'shop', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'clearly', 'titles', 'liner', 'notes', 'covers', 'Alex', 'face', 'show', 'subtle', 'changes', 'blood', 'flows', 'skin', 'how', 'McDowall', 'acted', '[', 'directed', ']', 'frightening', 'zest', 'Violent', 'scenes', 'rape', 'assault', 'appear', 'more', 'play', 'acting', 'dance', 'moves', 'actors', 'use', 'exaggerated', 'movements', 'victims', 'almost', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'bruised', 'bloodied', 'pounding', 'compare', 'similar', 'themed', 'recent', 'movies', 'Fight', 'Club.The', 'clear', 'crisp', 'BD', 'sound', 'track', 'far', 'easier', 'discern', 'nadsat', 'words', 'times', 'were', 'garbled', 'old', 'analog', 'transmission', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'VHS', 'beta', 'less', 'DVD', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'less', 'distracting', 'large', 'TV', 'better', 'font', 'BD.The', 'music', 'was', 'revelation', 'never', 'cared', 'Wendy', '[', 'credited', 'Walter', 'prior', 'sex', 'change', ']', 'Carlos', 'music', 'sometimes', 'synthesizer', 'sound', 'gave', 'headaches', 'somehow', 'BD', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'smoother', 'richer', 'overtones', 'compared', 'modern', 'digital', 'synthesizers', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'listening']",N/A

It's pretty hard, if not impossible, to convince today's youth to watch older movies, let alone enjoy them.  This movie is different, it's simply amazing.I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.  Someone else said in their review that this was the American Beauty of the 70's and I think this is quite true.  It's a movie that depicts society, or the near future society, in England.  Quite simply the movie has it all, in fact I don't even know how to categorize the film.  It's almost an action/horror movie when you watch the rape scenes, but it's also a comedy in a sick way, and in the end a huge satire of government, and how they try and ""fix"" criminals even though we all know this really isn't possible.  The truth is evil and hatred exist in all of us, some of us are just better at hiding it.  You can't get rid of it, it's part of the human nature, and when you do try and ""cure"" someone of their primal nature you just dehumanize them.I won't bother trying to explain much of the plot, cause it's a really difficult movie to explain.  You just have to watch it for yourself, it will definetly make you think for days and weeks after seeing it.Lastly, the acting is top notch, the soundtrack is also excellant, and the movie flows quite well.  I honestly can't find one thing wrong with this movie.  Go buy it or at the very least rent it immediately.  WARNING-  This movie contains scenes of extreme violence, rape and nudity.  It's beyond what you expect out of an R rated movie.  Do not watch it with young children.  At the same time don't let this turn you off from the movie though.

He informs the viewer that he loves the violence and sex contained in the first part, but really has no use for the preaching in the latter half.  I have come across a lot of folks who have seen this flick and it never fails- there are many out there who, like Alex and the Bible, love the brutality of the first hour of the film, and cannot abide the preachy second half.  If you are one of those, stop reading this review.A Clockwork Orange is an ingenious comparison of two theories of punishment- retributivism and utilitarianism.  Debate has raged over the proper role of a criminal justice system.  Is the goal to punish the criminal according to the old eye for an eye standard (retributivism) or to reform the criminal into a useful, law abiding citizen (utilitarianism)?  At the outset, many people dismiss utilitarian values as a lot of liberal silliness: soft on crime.  A more important question is whether we should reform criminals whether they desire to be reformed or not for the good of society.  One of the more interesting aspects of this film is that is shows utilitarianism can be a far more brutal method than retributivism, contrary to popular thought.Here we have the debate crystallized as if the proponents of both, Kant and Bentham, were debating the merits before our very eyes through the characters on screen.  Alex is unquestionably rotten to the core; he maims and rapes helpless victims for laughs.  The first hour of the film is dedicated to underscoring this point.  When Alex is apprehended by the authorities, he is dealt with in the old fashioned Kantian way- punishment.Alex then volunteers for a special treatment that will cure him, in exchange for freedom.  The cure is a form of conditioning that causes Alex to become terribly ill whenever any inclination towards sex or violence surfaces- he now has a reflexive aversion toward evil, and ?ceases to be a being capable of moral choice?.  The final act of the film deals with the consequences of being cured in such a way.By now you probably get the idea- go see this film (but not as a date).  To further entice you, it is one of the most visually exciting movies ever made, with vibrant images that will burn themselves into your mind.  If you have never seen it on DVD, the transfer is great, and you will see things you might have missed before.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","I've never read the book, but I bet many others have not either, though I had read a lot of reviews about `A Clockwork Orange' before seeing it, basically because I was unable to see it. Alex de Large(Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of four droogs who steel, rape, and fight for pleasure in a futuristic society. They spend every minute of their spare time causing absolute chaos anywhere they please. But after being challenged for his leadership, Alex puts his own droogs in their place by beating them. Wanting revenge for Alex's betrayal, the gang betrays Alex and leaves him for the police by whom he is told that he will be prosecuted for murder. Alex is sentenced for 14 years in prison, but after a while with good behavior, he is given the opportunity to get out early through an experiment that reforms criminals through brainwashing to be perfect citizens. Now, a totally reformed Alex must go back and face the society that he once terrorized as a human being with no free will.What amazed me most about this movie was the classical music that was played throughout horrific violent acts that Alex committed, showing that his violence was in nature. The music assisted the idea that he was a criminal at heart and he doesn't want to change. With the movie originally being rated X, you can probably guess that the criminal acts are very graphic. But that it was makes the movie even more brilliant. It doesn't hesitate to show the viewers every aspect of brutal fight scenes or disgusting rape visuals. Every detail adds to the idea that he is a sinner, plain and simple.The acting was also great in here. Malcolm McDowell did a masterful job at his character's changes throughout the movie. The mood changes throughout the movie also. When Alex is ""allowed"" to be sinister, the mood is dark but yet happy. But when he is forced to be good (either in prison or after the reformation) the mood turns very dark and you can see Alex's unhappiness at what he has become. The movie shows very strong opinionated themes: Society cannot forgive other's sins and criminals are naturally evil and cannot be reformed. Disagree with this you may, but you have to respect the epic masterpiece that is A Clockwork Orange.Overall, the movie is completely flawless and is everything it was meant to be and more. The idea of a criminal being transformed into being the idol citizen was captured rather nicely, through the graphic genius of Stanley Kubrick. I highly recommend this movie.",4,Raw and wicked.

To take the viewer to a virtual hell and then when things seem their bleakest dive a bit deeper.  it is good story telling and movie making.  Kubrick loved to dive into the extreme's which is a part of human nature.  In this case he looked at the extremes of evil,crime and crime prevention.  Very powerful topics that needed to be handled in a fashion that would allow the viewer to come to his own conclusion.  If all you saw was violence then you were only watching the movie without seeing the story.  Subtext is the most powerful tool in art and is so comonly overlooked.  A lot of the viewers who miss the point remind me of Alex the way that they are programmed into accepting the mundane and mindlesss forms of entertainment like ""Friends"" or ""Spiderman"" and rejecting the deeper pieces of culture that society has to offer:""Babylon 5"" or any Kubrick or David Lynch movie.

He was the water tycoon in Tank Girl and the rich mastermind with healing powers in Heroes.  He was also the lead character and narrator in A Clockwork Orange.  For that reason alone, I think this movie deserves a watch.A Clockwork Orange is an old film but it certainly ages well.  The film had good color, good sound, and a pretty extremist plot.  The actors were also well-known and there were some very sexy broads throughout the film.  The nudity was also, at the time, a rarity, and in this film, it just seems like a smut film.  The movie uses its mature undertones as overtones and throws sexuality right in your face for most of the film.  Nowadays, it may be more commonplace to see depravity in films, but back then, it was probably a bit of a shock value.  Overall, all these aspects help the film appeal to newer audiences.It helps that the plot is also fairly interesting.  The story is based closely on a book by the same name.  I think it does the book justice.  Less can be said about the Harry Potter films, which are praised so often as being great stories.  Give me a break.  A Clockwork Orange is a much more interesting story with well written dialogue and very nicely executed camera work.I give this film a 4/5 simply because it has no obvious point.  Once you watch the movie to the ending, you have to ask youself, ""What is the film trying to focus on?  Is it the dangers of brainwashing or that the government is just a bunch of people who don't know what they're doing?""  I think the story is meant to just be gritty for the purpose of being gritty.  It is an enjoyable ride.  I just wish it had a more proper closure.  I say the same about the book, though.  The ending sucks and just leaves you a little dissatisfied.

Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[1, 2]","Which is better: to be capable of choice even if we use this capability to choose monstrous evil, or to be capable only of 'good' even if we are therefore incapable of real moral choice?Anthony Burgess asked and answered this question in his haunting and disturbing novel _A Clockwork Orange_. Stanley Kubrick's stunning adaptation of the book to the screen succeeds at every level in conveying both the question and Burgess's preferred answer.The film is rigorously staged and stylized, the graphic visual content often in fittingly violent conflict with the classical music of the soundtrack. The sex and violence are both repulsive and fascinating, as they must be in order to pose Burgess's question fairly (and to fulfill another purpose of Burgess's that he acknowledges in his introduction to the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel: 'to titillate the nastier propensities' of the audience).Like the novel, the film features the unlikeliest 'hero' in the history of literature (and one of its greatest antiheroes). Alex is a sadistic teen gang leader with a taste for rape and destruction (and for Beethoven). Eventually, for reasons you will learn in the film, he's subjected to a groundbreaking behavior-modification treatment at the hands of a 'benevolent' State bent on reducing crime (partly in order to make room in the jails for political prisoners; incidentally, Burgess's book is also one of the finest man-vs.-the-State novels).Malcolm McDowell is hypnotic in what is still the role of his lifetime. His moral choices during the first portion of the film will make you want to vomit. This guy isn't a handsome Cool Hand Luke charmingly lopping the heads off parking meters, or even a disarmingly free-spirited Randle Patrick McMurphy getting caught engaging in consensual sex with an underage girl. Alex is a violent thug, rapist, and (eventually) killer, and he does it all for the sheer fun of it. Far from being a likeable antiauthority figure, he will initially have you rooting for the authorities.But after he (ironically enough) chooses to be subjected to the Ludovico treatment, you will find yourself on his 'side' (such as it is). The fact that Burgess is able to bring his reader to _sympathize_ with such a character is one of the novel's greatest achievements; Kubrick matches it point by point on the screen. (That's why this film is so much _better_ a 'countercultural'/'antiauthoritarian' film than even the admittedly great _Cool Hand Luke_ and _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_.)The end of the film leaves something to be desired: namely, the final (twenty-first) chapter of Burgess's novel, which wasn't included in the original U.S. edition of the book. For some reason, even though the film was shot in the U.K., Kubrick elected not to incorporate this final chapter, with the effect that non-U.S. audiences were surprised at the abrupt and seemingly unfinished ending. U.S. audiences who have read the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel may feel likewise.Whatever the merits of the omission, the film is not only great on its own terms but one of the greatest screen adaptations ever made of a novel. It will help a bit if you've read the book first, just because you'll have been thereby clued in to the largely Russian-based slang used by Alex and his droogs. But it's not necessary; as in the book, the screenplay gives you time and opportunity to adjust. In this respect and in every other, Kubrick's film stands just fine on its own merits.This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. You'll need a strong stomach to watch it, but it will hold up under repeated viewings for as long as you can stand it.",5,"'When man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.'",1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,3648,"['better', 'be', 'capable', 'choice', 'even', 'use', 'capability', 'choose', 'monstrous', 'evil', 'be', 'capable', 'only', ""'good"", 'even', 'are', 'therefore', 'incapable', 'real', 'moral', 'choice', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'asked', 'answered', 'question', 'haunting', 'disturbing', 'novel', '_A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange_', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'stunning', 'adaptation', 'book', 'screen', 'level', 'conveying', 'question', 'Burgess', 'preferred', 'answer.The', 'film', 'rigorously', 'staged', 'stylized', 'graphic', 'visual', 'content', 'often', 'fittingly', 'violent', 'conflict', 'classical', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'sex', 'violence', 'are', 'repulsive', 'fascinating', 'must', 'be', 'order', 'pose', 'Burgess', 'question', 'fairly', 'fulfill', 'purpose', 'Burgess', 'introduction', '1986', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'novel', ""'to"", 'titillate', 'nastier', 'propensities', 'audience', 'novel', 'film', 'unlikeliest', ""'hero"", 'history', 'literature', 'one', 'greatest', 'antiheroes', 'Alex', 'sadistic', 'teen', 'gang', 'leader', 'taste', 'rape', 'destruction', 'Beethoven', 'Eventually', 'reasons', 'will', 'learn', 'film', 'subjected', 'groundbreaking', 'behavior-modification', 'treatment', 'hands', ""'benevolent"", 'State', 'bent', 'reducing', 'crime', 'partly', 'order', 'make', 'room', 'jails', 'political', 'prisoners', 'incidentally', 'Burgess', 'book', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'man-vs.-the-State', 'novels', '.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'hypnotic', 'what', 'still', 'role', 'lifetime', 'moral', 'choices', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'vomit', 'guy', ""n't"", 'handsome', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'charmingly', 'lopping', 'heads', 'off', 'parking', 'meters', 'even', 'disarmingly', 'free-spirited', 'Randle', 'Patrick', 'McMurphy', 'getting', 'caught', 'engaging', 'consensual', 'sex', 'underage', 'girl', 'Alex', 'violent', 'thug', 'rapist', 'eventually', 'killer', 'sheer', 'fun', 'being', 'likeable', 'antiauthority', 'figure', 'will', 'initially', 'have', 'rooting', 'authorities.But', 'ironically', 'enough', 'be', 'subjected', 'Ludovico', 'treatment', 'will', 'find', ""'side"", 'such', 'fact', 'Burgess', 'able', 'bring', 'reader', '_sympathize_', 'character', 'one', 'novel', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'Kubrick', 'point', 'point', 'screen', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'much', ""'countercultural'/'antiauthoritarian"", 'film', 'even', 'admittedly', 'great', '_Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke_', '_One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest_', 'end', 'film', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'namely', 'final', 'twenty-first', 'chapter', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'original', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'book', 'reason', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'U.K.', 'Kubrick', 'elected', 'not', 'incorporate', 'final', 'chapter', 'effect', 'non-U.S.', 'audiences', 'were', 'surprised', 'abrupt', 'seemingly', 'unfinished', 'ending', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'read', '1986', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'novel', 'may', 'feel', 'merits', 'omission', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'own', 'terms', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'made', 'novel', 'will', 'help', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'first', 'just', ""'ll"", 'have', 'been', 'thereby', 'clued', 'largely', 'Russian-based', 'slang', 'used', 'Alex', 'droogs', 'not', 'necessary', 'book', 'screenplay', 'time', 'opportunity', 'adjust', 'respect', 'other', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'just', 'fine', 'own', 'merits.This', 'one', 'greatest', 'motion', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made', ""'ll"", 'need', 'strong', 'stomach', 'watch', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'stand']",N/A

Just some quick thoughts on this bizarre movie...A Clockwork Orange (1971) was produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and is based on the novel by Anthony Burgess.  The best way I can describe this movie is &#34;bizarre&#34;.  This is a bizarre, twisted, sick, sort of psychedelic movie that makes me think that maybe it's the result of an LSD trip.  Who knows.  Malcolm McDowell gives a great performance as the psycho he portrays.  The music throughout is &#34;far out&#34;.  This movie has an early '70s feel to it.  The sets are unique, the colors, the props - all futuristic.  The movie has nudity galore.  Lots of naked women, lots of shocking scenes.  A lot of people don't like this movie, and it's understandable, but I see this movie as a work of art - and there wasn't any CGI in 1971 (thankfully!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).Why am I giving this movie 5 stars?

The story follows Alex as he commits some hideous crimes and, after being caught, participates in a new criminal reform program. It is an amazing film for many reasons, but may not be for everyone.What did I like? It's very well shot and almost feels surreal. The story is thoroughly interesting and immersive. The acts of violence are realistic and powerful, although it can be excessive at times. Also, the acting was great, and the music was amazing. Malcom McDowell was evil, yet he was also charismatic; you hate him most of the time but feel bad for him at some other points in the film.What did I dislike? As I previously stated, the violence was very graphic. I had very mixed feelings about it, especially the rape scenes. It doesn't really affect how much I like the movie though, I think it was intentional to make the movie memorable and powerful. But the violence is worth noting.As you can see, most of the good in this film outweighs the bad. I truly enjoyed it and it's a very memorable experience.

Cardwell ""ghosthead101""","[2, 8]","There's quite a few really good films from the '70's; just about every horror film from then (even the really dumb ones) are much scarier than today's ""horror films"".  There were a lot of gloomy films (The Exorcist & The Godfather being two good examples) and there was ATMOSPHERE in just about every film put out then, even the ones that didn't matter much to anyone (then or now).  This film topples 'em all, 'cause it's got all the atmosphere of a Vietnam-era film and it's got A TOTAL-FRAKIN' SLEW of compelling ideas AND dazzling imagery...it's emotional depth is a little lacking, but it's not meant to do what FORREST GUMP did, it's meant to do what IT does and if the ""true"" version of the film (which was never filmed, aka THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF THE BOOK) were released, it would have been a meaningless, out-of-context film (with the ending considered...).  I read the ""true"" version of the film (the re-published book w/ the extra chapter added in) and it gave me a reason to defend the film against this guy who hated it b/c its plot pertained to violence (a guy who'd never even seen the film), but that was not worth the feelings I have against the book, the author of the book, AND the people who've claimed this film is trash b/c of its lack of depth/??/.../...; yeah, maybe the author wanted to tell ""a man and his story"", but why?  WHO THE FFF cares???????????  It's not based on a true story (this bleak future of London, thus far, has yet to happen) and it's not even modeled after an IMPORTANT man (important like Rosa Parks was important; or Martin Luther King, Jr., or even Malcom X for that matter...); it's made-up and fake!  Who cares about what happens after all the stuff the book describes prior to the re-birth of Alex's mind?  It doesn't make sense, it's unrealisitc and has NO MEANING!  All films should have a purpose (either to over-induldge in emotion, to make a statement or SOMETHING!!!!) and the ""original"" story does not!  This is an improvement on the original manuscript.  I don't like the publisher's ""reason"" for neglecting Mr. Burgess' 21st chapter (people'd rather buy violence than positivity ; that isn't true unless you ignore all the tens of thousands - possibly millions - of passionate devoted Christians), but the 21st chapter SHOULD have been ommitted.  If it hadn't (like it was), then Mr. Kubrick probably would have been VERY hesitant to film this movie (like he did, although maybe not...he supposedly ruined Mr. Stephen King's ""The Shining"" as well...although it would have been impossible to make such an elaborate film back then - read the book and you'll know what I mean - and they didn't do such a good job even when it WASN'T impossible to make such an elaborate film simply b/c Mr. King just HAAAAAD to have it made for TV...but ya never know).  All in all, this film is a masterpiece and the BOOK is trash; to say this film is intruging is a gross understatement; I can't say that about any other film I've seen; it's like the best film from the 1970's; if you want to see a little more lighthearted film with just as well-constructed satire, I suggest BEING THERE, a film that came out at the end of the 1970's starring Peter Sellers (of the Pink Panther series); that film is hysterically funny (I laughed 'till it hurt like the 2nd or 3rd time i saw it and there was no shortage of laughter the 1st time around...) but still has a deep satirical message...thanks for reading this review and i hope you watch this film if you haven't seen it, for the reasons I gave AND the reasons others have (if any I haven't given).

One night it was being shown on cable and my curiosity got the better of me. It is a dark disturbing tale of 3 violent delinquent punks headed by Alex played by Malcolm McDowell, who first appears in this dark room in some weird make up and has a this sinister look. It is not long before they are seen doing their dirty deeds, such as: running vehicles off the road, engaging in a gang fight with another gang in the middle of their dirty deeds, rape, beating a homeless bum, and raid a home in which they commit unspeakeable misdeeds to the unfortunate inhabitants(i.e leave it to you people to find out about this, let's just say it's one of the more disturbing scenes of the movie.) Alex runs into a crossroads when after a burglary goes bad and results in a murder, he is then betrayed and almost knocked unconscious by his two partners in crime and leave him hung out to dry and arrested by the police. He is put after an opportunistic moment in prison, put into a rehabilitation program, which seems to deprogram him out of his barbaric instincts after much painful tests. He is then released and that is where he faces the consequences, facing some of the people he tormented, some torment him back, including his former partners in crime, who just on the surface seem to take a new leaf by becoming police officers. The ending is somewhat anti climatic, and one is left wondering wether he really is rehabilitated or he is just acting as a creature of survival and convenience. But the film does depict perhaps some of the hipocisy of the political system in dealing with crime and punishment. It leaves one with food for thought, and it's one of those disturbing films that draw one, with good acting, setting and cinematograpy despite it's theme.",4,"A Clockwork Orange: Dark, Disturbing, Great Cinematography.",993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1861,"['got', 'look', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'One', 'night', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'cable', 'curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'tale', '3', 'violent', 'delinquent', 'punks', 'headed', 'Alex', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'first', 'dark', 'room', 'weird', 'make', 'up', 'sinister', 'look', 'not', 'long', 'are', 'seen', 'doing', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'such', 'running', 'vehicles', 'road', 'engaging', 'gang', 'fight', 'gang', 'middle', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'rape', 'beating', 'homeless', 'bum', 'raid', 'home', 'commit', 'unspeakeable', 'misdeeds', 'unfortunate', 'inhabitants', 'i.e', 'leave', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Alex', 'crossroads', 'when', 'burglary', 'bad', 'results', 'murder', 'then', 'betrayed', 'almost', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'two', 'partners', 'crime', 'leave', 'out', 'dry', 'arrested', 'police', 'put', 'opportunistic', 'moment', 'prison', 'put', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'deprogram', 'barbaric', 'instincts', 'much', 'painful', 'tests', 'then', 'released', 'where', 'consequences', 'facing', 'people', 'tormented', 'torment', 'back', 'including', 'former', 'partners', 'crime', 'who', 'just', 'surface', 'seem', 'take', 'new', 'leaf', 'becoming', 'police', 'officers', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'anti', 'climatic', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'wether', 'really', 'rehabilitated', 'just', 'acting', 'creature', 'survival', 'convenience', 'film', 'depict', 'perhaps', 'hipocisy', 'political', 'system', 'dealing', 'crime', 'punishment', 'one', 'food', 'thought', 'one', 'disturbing', 'films', 'draw', 'one', 'good', 'acting', 'setting', 'cinematograpy', 'theme']",N/A

This is one movie that completely holds your attention all the way through.  By the time it was over, I was totally aghast.  I knew that I had just witnessed the greatest movie ever made.The most amazing thing about this movie isn't the acting, the score, or anything like that, it's the FEELING that it gives you.

I promise you - it will be unlike anything you've ever seen.Since this is a British movie, the slang can be somewhat puzzling for us Americans.  But it doesn't deprecate the movie at all, believe me.  Anyway, I should probably discuss the plot now (forgive me for rambling on).  The main character is Alexander de Large, the ruthless leader of a gang of delinquents.  Alex and his droogs get their kicks by committing acts of ""ultra-violence"".  But soon, Alex finally gets caught and put in jail.  After serving only a portion of his sentence, he is released in order to be the recipient of a strange new treatment.  The treatment makes Alex horribly sick every time he thinks of violence; thus, making him a better person.  But the priest in the film makes a good point: Alex may be free of violent impulses, but he is not MORALLY free.  In otherwords, he does not have the ability to choose his own lifestyle, due to the ghastly effects of the treatment.All the reviews in the world still can't do this movie justice, you have to see it for yourself.

85651,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0790701022,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","A Clockwork Orange is one of three films, along with Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey, generally regarded as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and is probably my personal favorite of the three. Adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel of the same name, A Clockwork Orange is a violent, controversial film with some of the most iconic images in cinematic history and is easily the most accessible of those three Kubrick films. The film satirizes society, politics, and is also (like many Kubrick films) deeply philosophical. In addition, it's also one of the most surreal and endlessly fascinating films ever made.The film opens iconically with a close-up of the anti-hero protagonist and narrator Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and slowly pulls back to reveal his three droogs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim) sitting in the Korova Milk Bar where they are enjoying ""milk plus"" before embarking on a night fraught with ""ultra-violence."" Alex and his droogs wreak havoc in thoroughly immoral ways, beginning with the beating of an elderly vagrant and concluding with a home-invasion and rape, the latter performed while Alex joyfully sings ""Singin' in the Rain."" When he's not terrorizing the countryside by night, Alex is shown religiously listening to the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and inviting some girls back to his house to participate in a bit of the old ""in-out, in-out."" After Alex is betrayed by his droogs and sentenced to a 14-year stay in prison, he is given the chance to participate in a new experiment that will see his sentence commuted by brainwashing him into being unable to commit such atrocities.In addition to being a novelist, Burgess was also a linguist and the characters in A Clockwork Orange speak in Nadsat, slang comprised of Russian, English, and Cockney rhyming slang. For the adaptation, this remained intact and is one of the film's most indelible aspects. It's one of the reasons that the film is so memorable and timeless, as well as a contributor to what makes it so original. The brilliance of the story comes from Burgess, but the brilliance of the film is all Kubrick. A Clockwork Orange does not simply function on the foundation of having a brilliant story, but on the way that story is conveyed. This is one of the best assembled films ever made with one amazing scene consistently following another.The term ""film composition"" is never more appropriate than when discussing the works of Stanley Kubrick, as he treated each film like a musical composition with each piece falling perfectly into place at the precise moment. The composition of this film is masterful, perfect and it maintains an atmosphere so unlike any other film. Speaking of musical composition, it's impossible to separate this film and its spellbinding effect from the music of Ludwig van Beethoven that makes up a large part of the film's score. It may be a bold statement, but those looking for a perfect film need look no further. There is never a dull moment in A Clockwork Orange and this is not simply because of a compelling story, but because of the spell the film casts with performances that are like choreographed dance and the production design/art direction (by John Barry, Russell Hagg, and Peter Sheilds) that is truly a thing of beauty. There is not a single film in all of history that looks like this one and it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see.The whole cast give pitch-perfect performances and, typical once again of Kubrick films, several minor supporting roles are populated with actors who stand out substantially due to their little quirks. McDowell gives the performance of a lifetime as Alex, the role that made him an icon in addition to leaving him forever typecast. Shades of the character are noticeable in McDowell's earlier performance in If..., the film that inspired Kubrick to cast him, but it's a fully-realized, simultaneously comical and menacing performance here and it's doubtful that anyone could have pulled it off as marvelously as McDowell. He appears in every scene and carries the entire film on his shoulders with his mannerisms, voice, and movement, all of which are partly responsible for keeping the audience glued to the screen. In minor roles, the most unforgettable are arguably Patrick Magee (as F. Alexander, the writer whose home is invaded early on) and Aubrey Morris (as probation officer P.R. Deltoid). Deltoid's high-strung, comically nervous way of adding ""mmm...yes"" to the end of every sentence and Magee's creepy and unforgettable transformation from a quiet writer to a madman make these performances stand out even with very little screen time.I'm not the first person to say it nor will I be the last, but A Clockwork Orange is a work of art and stands as one of the best films ever made. Nothing in Kubrick's oeuvre remotely resembles it and yet it's so thoroughly Kubrick's work; a film that casts a spell on you with its biting originality and carries you through a cinematic world so uniquely its own. Kubrick began as a photographer and that profession largely contributes to why so many iconic, unforgettable images spawn from his films. Kubrick, possibly more so than any other director, knew how to point a camera at a particular image and get the most effective shot from it. Nearly every frame of this film is perfect from a photographic standpoint and easily has the best opening and closing shots of any film I can readily recall.It's a film that, with its political, societal, and moral implications, makes you think. It's a film that continues to cast a spell after repeated viewings; a film that still manages to entertain, shock, and excite. It remains, as it did at the time of its release, a controversial, subversive, and brilliant film that even the casual filmgoer cannot help but be drawn to. 40 years after it was made and there are still not enough adjectives to accurately convey how blisteringly original, brave, and immersive it is. With this recent Blu-Ray release, you're able to experience the film all over again and it's never looked or sounded better. Like nearly all of his films, this one had the Kubrick touch and, as such, it's pure cinematic gold.GRADE: A",5,A Timeless Work of Art,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,6180,"['Clockwork', 'Orange',

A Clockwork Orange is certainly one of them that has been in there for quite some time, and after 26 years, this masterpiece is still giving people the `treatment' that A Clockwork Orange always has.Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a violent juvenile in the near future, is caught after a number of brutal rapes and murders. While imprisoned, he submits to a controversial experiment to make criminals ill at the mildest suggestion of violence or conflict. Now Alex's victims want to welcome him back into society with the same enthusiasm Alex had always exhibited when performing his crimes.A breathtakingly simply story line in a brilliantly complex film. It keeps you hooked and it stays in your mind long after the credits have rolled, what more do you need? Just in case you're saying `more,' I'll give you more. How about Kubrick's oh-so-extraordinary vision through a near-future Britain with his groundbreaking script and typically mindblowing direction effort? Or what about Malcolm McDowell's stunner of a performance in a stunner of a film? This has often been called Kubrick's best movie ever, and although in my opinion, Dr. Strangelove takes that award, A Clockwork Orange is still a classy masterpiece that will flutter around in the back of your head long after the tape has been returned.Simply masterful, A Clockwork Orange is a film that is no to missed, and not to be messed with.",5,A classy masterpiece,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1528,"['Clockwork', 'OrangeScore', '97/100There', 'are', 'certain', 'films', 'certain', 'director', 'are', 'placed', 'Stood-The-Test-Of-Time', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'certainly', 'one', 'been', 'there', 'quite', 'time', '26', 'years', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'giving', 'people', 'treatment', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'always', 'has.Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'violent', 'juvenile', 'near', 'future', 'caught', 'number', 'brutal', 'rapes', 'murders', 'imprisoned', 'controversial', 'experiment', 'make', 'criminals', 'ill', 'mildest', 'suggestion', 'violence', 'conflict', 'Now', 'Alex', 'victims', 'want', 'welcome', 'back', 'society', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'Alex', 'had', 'always', 'exhibited', 'when', 'performing', 'crimes.A', 'breathtakingly', 'simply', 'story', 'line', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'film', 'hooked', 'mind', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'what', 'more', 'do', 'need', 'Just', 'case', ""'re"", 'saying', 'more', ""'ll"", 'give', 'more', 'How', 'Kubrick', 'oh-so-extraordinary', 'vision', 'near-future', 'Britain', 'groundbreaking', 'script', 'typically', 'mindblowing', 'direction', 'effort', 'what', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'stunner', 'performance', 'stunner', 'film', 'often', 'been', 'called', 'Kubrick', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'opinion', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'award', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'still', 'classy', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'flutter', 'back', 'head', 'long', 'tape', 'been', 'returned.Simply', 'masterful', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'film', 'missed', 'not', 'be', 'messed']",N/A

Perhaps I don't have the 'intellect', but I always feel as though he is pushing through a obscured message that if you don't get, well than your precious time is wasted. I sometimes think he is not even pushing through a message, just relying on the fact that the audience assume there is one, hidden underneath all that art. Take 'Eyes Wide Shut' for example. We could talk for hours about the symbolism of red and sexuality in the film, but in all honesty, what portion of the population who has not taken psych, drugs or not is attempting to appear intellectual for the sheer sake of it, what portion is going to notice something for that. Cinematic masterpieces, undoubtedly, but certainly not fit for entertainment value.That said and done, 'A Clockwork Orange' is by far his most brillant piece, and cinematically his most stunning. It would also have to be the most uncomfortable film ever made, for even the most exposed of viewers. There is films that match up to the level of violence displayed in this piece, for example Oliver Stone's ultra violent 'Natural Born Killers', or perhaps the recently made 'Fight Club', but one must ask themselves whether there is truly any formally made film as horrifying. I have seen many a violent and disturbing film, but I believe the backward panning opening image of the boys sitting in their disgustingly white bar, their feet on a table shaped like unnecessarily flexible women, that eyelash thing on Alex's eye, could anything be as confronting despite the fact that nothing confronting, no violence, no sex, no intravenous drug use, nothing is occuring? This goes with the image of concentration camps on big screens while Alex has drops fed into his unclosing eyes by a sterile looking doctor. The violence isn't really that bad when we consider that it is not Alex's violence or sex which comprises the most horrifying part of the film, but the treatment he recieves by the world when his defenses are lowered.This film is no Kevin Smith movie, but is funning in that smirking 'Isn't that ironic' style.

Kubrick created a film set in a near-future London where gangs rule the streets to such an extent that the authorities must use drastic measures to stop the violence.The main character of Alex is played (with a maniacal glint in his eye) by Malcolm McDowell. It's McDowell's breakout acting performance. All of the other actors are incidental to Alex, as we watch him and his ""Droogs"" terrorize, rape, and plunder like pirates on the high-seas. But when Alex is double-crossed by his gangster buddies, Alex's troubles really begin.Alex undergoes a brainwashing regimen in order to get him to associate everything that excited him with a regurgitation effect. This is modern society's way of dealing with hopeless cases like Alex. But, does the experiment succeed? That's for you to discover.The film was supposedly banned in Britain due to its content, but the truth is the film played in Britain for a short amount of time, and Kubrick saw that some sick British fans of the film were emulating the violence of the Droogs. This so upset him that he refused to release the film again in the UK. It took decades for the film to be shown again to a British audience.That is a testament to the film's powerful message. It is a character study about humanity, and what happens when we think we can control a seemingly uncontrollable situation.It is hard to watch at times, even in the 21st Century, but it is a landmark film by one of the 20th Century's greatest film directors, Stanley Kubrick.",5,"So Far Ahead Of Its Time, Its FRIGHTENING!",1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,1599,"['filmed', 'adaptation', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'book', 'shot', 'cannon', 'never', 'up', 'pace', 'Kubrick', 'created', 'film', 'set', 'near-future', 'London', 'where', 'gangs', 'rule', 'streets', 'extent', 'authorities', 'must', 'use', 'drastic', 'measures', 'stop', 'violence.The', 'main', 'character', 'Alex', 'played', 'maniacal', 'glint', 'eye', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'McDowell', 'breakout', 'acting', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'incidental', 'Alex', 'watch', 'Droogs', 'terrorize', 'rape', 'plunder', 'pirates', 'high-seas', 'when', 'Alex', 'double-crossed', 'gangster', 'buddies', 'Alex', 'troubles', 'really', 'begin.Alex', 'undergoes', 'brainwashing', 'regimen', 'order', 'get', 'associate', 'everything', 'excited', 'regurgitation', 'effect', 'modern', 'society', 'way', 'dealing', 'hopeless', 'cases', 'Alex', 'experiment', 'succeed', 'discover.The', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'banned', 'Britain', 'due', 'content', 'truth', 'film', 'played', 'Britain', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'Kubrick', 'saw', 'sick', 'British', 'fans', 'film', 'were', 'emulating', 'violence', 'Droogs', 'so', 'upset', 'refused', 'release', 'film', 'again', 'UK', 'took', 'decades', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'again', 'British', 'audience.That', 'testament', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'character', 'study', 'humanity', 'what', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'control', 'seemingly', 'uncontrollable', 'situation.It', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'even', '21st', 'Century', 'landmark', 'film', 'one', '20th', 'Century', 'greatest', 'film', 'directors', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick']",N/A

After Alex and friends commit various crimes, Alex is finally arrested and put in prison with a sentence of 14 years. Eventually, his sentence is commuted in exchange for him undergoing experimental aversion therapy which makes him physically ill at the thought of sex or violence. However, it also makes him hate Beethoven's 9th Symphony which was played as background music to some films during aversion treatment. After an attempted suicide, Alex is re-treated with apologies by the government for inhuman treatment, and Alex appears he will resume his old ways.This movie is highly stylized, including wardrobe, hairdo's (mom has purple hair, another woman had dark blue hair), set dressing, location and props.

85680,A36T2TEF5SKPUM,0790701022,Laon,"[15, 18]","When this film came out it was almost universally misread.  One school, the late and generally great Pauline Kael for one,  thought that because we almost invariably saw through junior Droog Alex's eyes, including his victims, and we are cajoled and occasionally amused or charmed by his narration, that we are invited to share his vile and violent worldview, and that the film endorses his rapes, bullyings and bashings.Others, more worryingly, fell for Alex's superfical charms (especially as played by Malcolm McDowell, as a petulant, mod angel), Alex's clothes, his before-his-time interest in false eyelashes and make-up for men, the wit and energy of the invented slang language that Burgess endowed him with, the Russian-influenced Droogish, and his taste for synthesized Beethoven on great speakers.Alex's moronic real-life imitators, carrying out a few sordid bashings in the UK while wearing longjohns, bovver boots and false eyelashes, were enough to have Kubrick withdraw the film from circulation from the UK for the next several decades.But this is a moral film about violence and evil, viewed with cold precision.  No excuses are made for Alex: the damage he has done to his terrified parents, to the writer he cripples (a painfully thinly-disguised Burgess) and the women he rapes and in one case kills, is shown utterly without sentiment and without flinching.  Nor are sentimental ideas about the redeeming value of culture allowed to stand.  Alex's love for Beethoven has no humanising significance; it only makes him a thug with good taste in music.(Music trivia footnote: the smart 1980s electrofunk band Heaven 17 [_We don't need that fascist groove thang_, _Penthouse and Pavement_ and other minor-but-cool hits] take their name from a fictitious band named in the film, whose records are prominently displayed in the record store scene.  Intelligent pop with a conscience; Alex would have hated them.)Alex is an evil product of an evil culture, and is at times only a pathetic pawn in the larger games of police, prison wardens, priests, probation officers, psychologists, at least those specalising in aversion therapy, and of course politicians.  But his ""suffering"", once he been conditioned to be incapable of violence and is vulnerable to the revenge of those he has bullied in the past, does not win our sympathy.  Nor is it meant to.  Rather it is part of a bitter and general condemnation of moral corruption in our lives and structures.Both book and movie are also a product of fear.  Burgess was in real life attacked, his wife raped: his use of this experience in his fiction is both an invocation and an exorcism of demons.  And Kubrick, like Burgess, was perhaps once the class intellectual, observing and no doubt picked on by the school bully, fearful, angry and puzzled by the apparent attractiveness of evil, even in its junior forms.  Kubrick is no fan or apologist for violence, which is shown in stylised, often balletic form, but always as horrifying, as leading to real pain.Kubrick's vision offers no hope, unlike Burgess, who offers Alex an unconvincing form of redemption; no hope except perhaps for the satirist's hope that if we see evil with a cold eye, for what it is and what it does, we may learn to reject it.This is also an extraordinary film at a visual level, a film of unparalelled originality and strangeness of design and cinematography.  Kubrick's visual world in this film, populated by erotic barbie-dolls serving as tables, drugs hiding in milk, eerily lit mansions and burnt-out housing estates, each looking as unwelcoming as the other, is actually colder than the outer space of _2001: A Space Odyssey_, and in some ways it is not only more sinister but also and uncomfortably more beautiful.I haven't mentioned acting except for Malcolm McDowell's, but in fact Kubrick's cast is uniformly excellent: efficient, credible, and almost invariably loathsome.The music, Beethoven, Purcell, Rossini and others, often synthesised by Walter (later Wendy) Carlos is justly famous: one of the most tellingly-selected soundtracks ever assembled, with the possible exception of _2001_ itself.This is a cold, horrifying film.  Though it offers several moments of bitter humour, some of which are shockingly funny in their context, as well as the linguistic gusto of Droog-speak, it is not a ""fun"" film.

About a dozen years after this masterpiece was released, a new drug -- Depo Provera -- appeared. It was said to be the chemical cure to rape and sex crimes by taking away the criminal's sexual appetite. A decade after this film appeared, nearly every contigous state entered into a prison-building program that made corrections officers the most plentiful state employees in America. All this was forecast by this brilliant film.If you've never seen it, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is Stanley Kubrick's political allegory set in a not too distant but very bleak future. The story revoles around Alex, a violent young criminal, a killing he participates in, and variouls political maneuverings after the fact. Ultimatley, it is a story about the human condition and how politics affects that condition.Alex and his cohorts commit a murder one night and he goes to prison. While there, he learns a new chemical treatment -- the Ludovico Treatment -- can render him harmless and get him released from prison. He volunteers to participate, gets the treatment, and is released. Unfortunately, the treatment turns him into a clockwork orange -- an organic creature that can only respond to sex and violence in a mechanical way -- and he becomes a victim instead of hero.Kubrick uses one of his most consistent devices -- irony -- to tell a tale of surprise, woe, retribution and ultimately optimism. Alex's life becomes an irony after his release. His former co-killers are now part of the police department and brutalize him. One of his former victims, a bum, ends up beating him up. Another victim, the husband of the deceased woman from Alex's killing, uses Alex in a political way to gain revenge. And because of the treatment he received, Alex can no longer listen to Beethoven, his favorite composer.There is no way to adequately describe the miracle of invention that is apparent in this film. Mixed with its potent political message and the way it projects the near future, I would say this has to be Kubrick's greatest work, better even than the funnier &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and more intellectually complex that his other films, although not as visually striking as &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.It was nominated for the Academy Award for best film, but any movie with an much objectionable content (it was rated X when it came out) could never win such a mainstream award.

The extras are fine indeed--McDowell dominates a great interview piece entitled &#34;O Lucky Malcolm!&#34;, and the 'making of' piece (which prominently features British film critic Alexander Walker) is absolutely fantastic. The picture and sound on this disc is superb--even, adjusted, and well balanced. It works well if you have a nice stereo to play it on (even Alex DeLarge would approve). But, for me, the highlight of this disc is the great audio commentary by Nick Redman (historian) and the great Malcolm himself--I laughed most of the way through it. There is a lot of information on this DVD commentary, and you must listen to it if you like this film at all.As for the movie itself, this one is from the days when real filmmakers were on the block, not these weirdo capitalists who are feeding you pleasantries because you have been lead to believe that rosy sunshine movies are the finest things since the invention of hand soap. Not so! McDowell's performance is a bright spot in a wonderfully satirical, quite dark, and sometimes rambunctious movie that makes a strong case for Kubrick's god-like supremacy at the top of Movie Master Mountain. If you find yourself disturbed by the scenes of rape, violence, and torture, then wait for quite a while until you grow up, and then come back to it with fresh eyes. The entire screenplay is one memorable (and original!) quote, the music score is unbelievable, the photography is beyond professional, and the brazen and dark-themed content is both clever and satirical to the point of perfection. In this age of digital crapola, Kubrick's actual movie sings and stomps with voice, color, character, sin, and redemption that makes fools out of the present day filmmakers who can only labor tiredly beneath the giant shadow cast by Kubrick.

85685,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0790701022,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[4, 6]","I've seen A Clockwork Orange several times, at different stages in life. I recently re-watched it in order to see it fresh, as part of my watching of all AFI Top 100 movies. A Clockwork Orange ranks #46 on that list. Released in 1971, this movie was unlike anything that had come before and still stands quite unique in the realm of movies. It nearly creates its own new language and immerses the watcher in a bizarre but entirely understandable alternate reality.The scene is a futuristic / alternate version of England where gangs of miscreants roam around with little to stop them. Some would say this isn't *too* far off from reality. Malcolm McDowell plays a school-age gang leader who by day lives with his parents and talks fairly respectfully to the adults in his life. He keeps a neat room, loves his pet snake, and listens to classical music. By night, he and his friends dress up in matching outfits and go out violently raping and killing people. They get great joy out of their violence, singing and laughing while they do it.It's the adoration of violence which is so powerful here. They don't just ""fight"" the opposing gang members, they bludgeon them into jelly. They don't just ""rape"" women, they laugh while they brutalize them. It's hard to watch. And the scenes are choreographed to classic music, making the viewing of it even more complex.It brings to mind what came up in another movie we recently watched. In The Third Man, a dialogue talks about how the peace and calm of the Swiss only produced the cuckoo clock, while the anarchy and violence of the Italian Renaissance created a wealth of wonders, music, and art.The government tries to ""fix"" Malcolm's brain by doing experiments to tie any glimpse of violence with enormous nausea and depression. There's some brief discussion about free will here, but in the end we see that the police are violent, the government is violent, and that the street gangs are just one small part of a larger, dysfunctional whole.It's challenging for me to watch this movie. There is full body nudity of several women who are violently gang raped. It is disturbing to watch. And there's little sense that anything is going to change in this society. The men will go around gang raping women, and those women will be brutalized and perhaps slain. The only two females in the movie besides the many victims are the mom, who one could say is an emotional victim, and the nurse. So this movie definitely fails the Bechdel test.I do appreciate the brilliance of how the movie immerses us in an alternate reality that is both very different from our own and at the same time quite similar. I appreciate the acting, the dialogue, and the themes being investigated. But it is so full of gratuitous violence and rape that I'm just not sure I'll watch this one again.

Released in 1971, three years after that masterpiece, ""Clockwork"" faced the peril of comparison with what has become the greatest cinematic achievement of all time. In short, how could Kubrick follow ""2001,"" a film that was so incredibly good that one could not imagine a worthy successor?He did it by making a film so different from its predecessor that any comparisons simply fall apart. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is its own animal -- and ""animal"" it is, indeed. Whereas ""2001"" was about the exploration of space but also the exploration of humankind's capacity for change, ""Clockwork"" was the at-times painful study of a young man caught between violent individualism and repressive society.Malcolm McDowell is brilliant as Alex, the young ""droog"" who's ever on the prowl for deviant sex, ""ultraviolence"" and, seemingly, all manner of wickedness for its own sake. The character's relentlessly immoral (or amoral?) behavior stunned audiences at the time. The violent scenes -- of various victims being raped, beaten, kicked, murdered -- proved that, in 1971 at least, people had not yet become inured to extreme depictions of violence. Some of the film's detractors called it sick. In UK, there was a considerable amount of copycat behavior, which so unnerved director Kubrick that he had the film pulled from distribution there -- for quite a number of years.In between those two extremes -- those who would condemn the film, and those who seemingly condoned it by acting it out -- was an audience that pondered the dilemma posed by Kubrick: Which is worse? An insistence upon individual freedom, which allows for such horrible behavior, or a society that may be going too far in trying to cleanse the populace of such villainy?Alex, you see, is caught and subjected to a conditioning program that is supposed to make him incapable of committing any more crimes. But the effect of this behavior modification upon him is so drastic that he is effectively stripped of any free will at all.It's a diabolical film in part because it steadfastly refuses to provide any answers. Kubrick was a filmmaker, not a moralist, and so his audiences were left to decide, for themselves, which could be more cruel -- the solitary human heart, or the collective conscience that sometimes grows so harsh that it, too, seems hopelessly corrupted.This is a brilliant film. Do not see it, though, if you are easily offended. Upon its initial theatrical release, the film was one of a very few non-pornographic productions in those days to receive an X rating. Frankly, I've seen films far more graphically violent than this one that got tagged with an R, not an NC-17, the successor of the X. But it is true that there is something about this film -- something about Alex's gleefully nightmarish world -- that disturbs the mind like nothing else.",5,Still disturbing after all these years,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,2961,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'canon', 'known', 'only', 'film', 'followed', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Released', '1971', 'three', 'years', 'masterpiece', 'Clockwork', 'faced', 'peril', 'comparison', 'what', 'become', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'time', 'short', 'how', 'could', 'Kubrick', 'follow', '2001', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'good', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'worthy', 'successor', 'did', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'different', 'predecessor', 'comparisons', 'simply', 'fall', 'apart', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'own', 'animal', 'animal', 'indeed', '2001', 'was', 'exploration', 'space', 'also', 'exploration', 'humankind', 'capacity', 'change', 'Clockwork', 'was', 'at-times', 'painful', 'study', 'young', 'man', 'caught', 'violent', 'individualism', 'repressive', 'society.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'brilliant', 'Alex', 'young', 'droog', 'who', 'ever', 'prowl', 'deviant', 'sex', 'ultraviolence', 'seemingly', 'manner', 'wickedness', 'own', 'sake', 'character', 'relentlessly', 'immoral', 'amoral', 'behavior', 'stunned', 'audiences', 'time', 'violent', 'scenes', 'various', 'victims', 'being', 'raped', 'beaten', 'kicked', 'murdered', 'proved', '1971', 'least', 'people', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'become', 'inured', 'extreme', 'depictions', 'violence', 'film', 'detractors', 'called', 'sick', 'UK', 'was', 'considerable', 'amount', 'copycat', 'behavior', 'so', 'unnerved', 'director', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'film', 'pulled', 'distribution', 'quite', 'number', 'years.In', 'two', 'extremes', 'who', 'would', 'condemn', 'film', 'who', 'seemingly', 'condoned', 'acting', 'out', 'was', 'audience', 'pondered', 'dilemma', 'posed', 'Kubrick', 'Which', 'worse', 'insistence', 'individual', 'freedom', 'such', 'horrible', 'behavior', 'society', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'trying', 'cleanse', 'populace', 'such', 'villainy', 'Alex', 'see', 'caught', 'subjected', 'conditioning', 'program', 'supposed', 'make', 'incapable', 'committing', 'more', 'crimes', 'effect', 'behavior', 'modification', 'so', 'drastic', 'effectively', 'stripped', 'free', 'will', 'all.It', 'diabolical', 'film', 'part', 'steadfastly', 'provide', 'answers', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'moralist', 'so', 'audiences', 'were', 'left', 'decide', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'cruel', 'solitary', 'human', 'heart', 'collective', 'conscience', 'sometimes', 'so', 'harsh', 'too', 'hopelessly', 'corrupted.This', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Do', 'not', 'see', 'though', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'non-pornographic', 'productions', 'days', 'receive', 'X', 'rating', 'Frankly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'graphically', 'violent', 'one', 'got', 'tagged', 'R', 'not', 'NC-17', 'successor', 'X', 'true', 'something', 'film', 'something', 'Alex', 'gleefully', 'nightmarish', 'world', 'mind', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A
85691,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0790701022,magellan,"[5, 20]","I realize that this is a much venerated cult classic. Some even say it represents the zenith of Kubrick's distinguished career. With Kubrick and Burgess as the director and novel writer, you can't ask for a better team than that. Perhaps that caused me to have unrealistically high expectations that weren't fulfilled. I was also familiar with some of Burgess's scholarly work in philology (I being sort of an amateur linguist) and had great respect for Burgess because of that. (Burgess was also considered an expert on primitive languages and was the consultant for the movie, ""Quest for Fire"").Unfortunately, for me the movie is an almost total, abject failure, and I say that as someone who is a fan of both Burgess and Kubrick. The story of a gang of London street toughs has been told so many times that the idea is shopworn, and putting it in the near future doesn't make it anymore interesting or original. By the standards of the time, the violence in the flick was considered brutal, but by present-day standards it's quite tame. I don't hold that against it; it's just that even by the standards of the time it's not that violent, despite the film having been banned in several countries.The future society Burgess creates isn't that interesting or shocking, although it tries hard to be the later. The movie tries to use shocking imagery to paint a picture of a dreary, desperate, violent future society, but ends up looking like a slightly weirder, lame version of the 60s--art deco couches shaped like eggs, strange fashions in clothes with codpieces for the men, walls covered with nude posters, a society made up of haves and have-nots, lots of crime and violence--this is supposed to be shocking? It wasn't that different from what existed then, or now.Although McDowell turns in a fine performance as Alex--one of the few high points in the movie is his performance--a lowlife like Alex probably wouldn't care for Beethoven. I suppose this is an attempt by Burgess to show that Alex had some ""higher nature"" or sensibilities and is somehow worth rehabilitating, but that's unlikely. Finally the avoidance conditioning used as punishment likely wouldn't work the way it's described in the movie.So overall, the story isn't particularly interesting and the future society Burgess envisages isn't that scary or shocking even by the standards of the time. I didn't read the original book, but being by Burgess, I'm sure it had depths, nuances, and complexities that couldn't be explored in only a two-hour movie, but unfortunately, very little of that comes through in the movie. So although I had high hopes for it, I have to give this one the thumbs down. I rate it two stars for effort, but really, that's being generous. As someone once said, maybe this is the sort of movie that people profess to like in order to show how cultured they are. Well, it's one thing to not have any learning or erudition in artistic matters, but saying that something is truly great that is as bad as this is something I just don't understand.By the way, the review by Clint the Cool Guy, which is several pages back from my more recent review, critiques the film's shortcomings in much more detail than mine. I recommend you read his review also. I agree with almost everything he said, and he says it better than me. I gave it two stars, but he gave it only one.

A World War is reduced to: a fight between Alex and his gang wearing Bobby-hats and billy clubs and Billy and his boys dressed in German war paraphernalia.The powers that be decide 'Alex' is in need of reform. He's strapped in a chair (similar to one once used to test viewers emotional responses during movie making) for aversion therapy. He's shown footage of Nazi atrocities while being made to feel bad, ""I can't stop watching""! Alex exclaims.Alex is tested - he's made to lick another man's boot and he is found unable to approach a beautiful naked woman - then he's released.Alex comes across every person he's done wrong to in the past. Each extracts their vengeance, and of course Alex is now unable to defend himself.In the end (after Alex's unforeseen breakdown), to save face, the political class presses Alex to admit, he has been cured of his cure.

Based on a novel by Anthony Burgess, the story of an adolescent monster fueled by music reflected an attack on Burgess's wife Lynn by four American soldiers in WWII. By turning this instance into a meditation on the nature of man's intrinsic evil and man's intrinsic need to mitigate that natural evil, Burgess created a compelling book whose main character is both Milton's Satan and Christ.Kubrick did little to transcribe the book to the screen in terms of the character or the story.  Wisely, Kubrick retained Burgess's linquistic pyrotechnics in the form of the Nadsat slang spoken by Alex and Droogs, but took the vaguely English Labor Government setting of the book one further by creating a defamiliarizing series of sets whose weirdness is only a sheath beneath which lies the police station and prison where Alex sufferes for his crimes.Kubrick created a new visual languange for this film. The shot of the four droogs walking slo-mo shot using a telephoto lens first made its appearance here; now this shot is a cliche used mainly for comedy.  The crisp color photography is also new and still rare.  The sense of meticulousness of each shot adds an almost novelistic depth to the film.  The depiction of sexual assault shocked critics in 1971, but it's not always real violence, as demonstrated by Kubricks use of ""The Thieving Magpie"" in the Casino rumble; but when Alex, Georgie, Dim and Pete invade HOME and brutalize the couple, the enjoyment of the violent dance becomes discomfort and shame as we watch the ritualized rape, another sort of dance.The music is this film is groundbreaking as well. Wendy Carlos's electronic orchestrations of classical music adds to the defamiliarization but also the sense of the artificial that pervades the film.  The selection of the March from the Funeral for Queen Mary as the title music is too inspired and perfect for any further comment.There are people who hate this movie, and with good reason. The violence is beautified, the rapist is made sympathetic, and the entire idea of Enlighment reliance on the scientic method is called into serious question. Alex is Evil but human; science can cure the badness but must rob the agency that defines humanity.A work of beauty, pain, and athesticism as the trump over right and wrong.

Not so, Kubrick came up empty despite the superalative reviews.Predictably, the academy stayed away from this dark and distrurbing masterpiece. For my money this is Kuberick's finest hour. As in all his movies he immerses the viewer with a torrent of sensory and auditory stimuli. I loved the musical selections of every scene, without exception. And, the back-lighting and orange tinge of almost every shot proves Kuberick the master of atmospheric juxtaposition.I loved this movie, but then again I loved The French Connection as well.

Whenever a director builds his movie on that single element, then if that element is no longer in synch with future audiences, this movie dates badly.  With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director Stanley Kubrick made sure this would not happen.  Kubrick took the novel by Anthony Burgess and squeezed out the ultra violence that characterized the nihilistic teens of a vaguely futuristic England and grafted it onto the big screen.  Malcolm McDowell as Alex the Droog is a walking trunk of unleashed anger that feels unbound by the laws of morality that bind the rest of the world.  To him, the world exists only to serve as the backdrop against which he plays out his fantasies of sex and violence.  For Alex, as his inability to distinguish Beethoven from brutality indicates, is similarly unable to recognize that the violence that he sees daily on the screens of his milkbars originates not from them but from within himself.The novel suggests that Alex's violence is a learned response to the violence of a harsh world that is even more morally empty than Orwell's Oceania.  Kubrick implies that if violence is the problem then more violence is the solution.  If there ever were an unregenerate soul it is the teen Alex, and if any technique could regenerate him, then that technique ought to be seriously considered for widespread use.  The problem with that is that Kubrick's use of sight and sound mask the inner villainy of a solution that is, at least on the Christian level, as bad as the disease.  Human beings are human, not because they can do both good and evil, but because they are free to choose either.  When Alex is sufficiently brainwashed, what emerges is not a de-violenced Alex, but a totally different young man who only looks like his amoral predecessor but with whom he has nothing in common.  This Alex reminds one of nothing less than a morally inverted character from any novel from the Marquis de Sade.  If one can unlearn violence and have that process hailed, then the reversal of that same process can be hailed too--if one also believes that free willed evil is preferable to forced good.Such weighty issues of free will versus predetermination stamp A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as far more than the astounding melange of surreal violence accompanied by classical music that many critics have either praised it as thoughtful or condemned it as mindless.  What both the book and film emphasize is that if a thug like Alex can choose evil over good, then it is far better for society to punish him than punish the rest of us by forcing him to tread a path that to him might have once seemed ugly beyond belief.",4,To Understand the Movie Understand the Title,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2739,"['Movies', 'seem', 'focus', 'one', 'apparent', 'theme', 'set', 'visuals', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'ravages', 'time', 'Whenever', 'director', 'movie', 'single', 'element', 'then', 'element', 'longer', 'synch', 'future', 'audiences', 'movie', 'badly', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'made', 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'Kubrick', 'took', 'novel', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'squeezed', 'out', 'ultra', 'violence', 'characterized', 'nihilistic', 'teens', 'vaguely', 'futuristic', 'England', 'grafted', 'big', 'screen', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Alex', 'Droog', 'walking', 'trunk', 'unleashed', 'anger', 'unbound', 'laws', 'morality', 'rest', 'world', 'world', 'only', 'serve', 'backdrop', 'out', 'fantasies', 'sex', 'violence', 'Alex', 'inability', 'distinguish', 'Beethoven', 'brutality', 'indicates', 'similarly', 'unable', 'recognize', 'violence', 'daily', 'screens', 'milkbars', 'not', 'himself.The', 'novel', 'Alex', 'violence', 'learned', 'response', 'violence', 'harsh', 'world', 'even', 'more', 'morally', 'empty', 'Orwell', 'Oceania', 'Kubrick', 'violence', 'problem', 'then', 'more', 'violence', 'solution', 'ever', 'were', 'unregenerate', 'soul', 'teen', 'Alex', 'technique', 'could', 'regenerate', 'then', 'technique', 'ought', 'be', 'seriously', 'considered', 'widespread', 'use', 'problem', 'Kubrick', 'use', 'sight', 'sound', 'mask', 'inner', 'villainy', 'solution', 'least', 'Christian', 'level', 'as', 'bad', 'disease', 'Human', 'beings', 'are', 'human', 'not', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'free', 'choose', 'either', 'When', 'Alex', 'sufficiently', 'brainwashed', 'what', 'not', 'de-violenced', 'Alex', 'totally', 'different', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'amoral', 'predecessor', 'whom', 'nothing', 'common', 'Alex', 'one', 'nothing', 'less', 'morally', 'inverted', 'character', 'novel', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'one', 'can', 'unlearn', 'violence', 'have', 'process', 'hailed', 'then', 'reversal', 'same', 'process', 'can', 'be', 'hailed', 'too', 'one', 'also', 'free', 'willed', 'evil', 'preferable', 'forced', 'good.Such', 'weighty', 'issues', 'free', 'will', 'versus', 'predetermination', 'stamp', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'far', 'more', 'astounding', 'melange', 'surreal', 'violence', 'accompanied', 'classical', 'music', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'praised', 'thoughtful', 'condemned', 'mindless', 'What', 'both', 'book', 'film', 'emphasize', 'thug', 'Alex', 'can', 'choose', 'evil', 'good', 'then', 'far', 'better', 'society', 'punish', 'punish', 'rest', 'forcing', 'tread', 'path', 'might', 'have', 'once', 'seemed', 'ugly', 'belief']",N/A

Scenes of sex & violence leaded to film's exhibition being banished in many countries (Argentina amongst them), so we were able to see it for the first time many years after its release.There are scenes of rape, gratuitous violence against senior people, drug abuse and sheer madness.Nevertheless all these violence is not senseless as in most contemporary movies. It tries to shock the viewer and make her/him reflect about public and private use of power, social and individual manipulation, hypocrisy and family relationships amongst other critical issues.The story, adapted from Anthony Burgess' sci-fi novel of the same title, is situated in a decadent future (may be due to post-WWIII conditions) at London.In this world teenagers band in quartets, consume exciting drugs, fight each other ruthlessly, use a peculiar language (the novel provides a glossary at the end of the book), ravage isolated country villas and commit remorselessly whatever violent act comes to their fogged minds. At the same time some institutions as penitentiaries & police force still stick to old repressive codes.Alex is the leader of one of these infamous quartets until an ""excess"" lead him into prison. Being there he will apply to receive an innovative ""conversion"" method.The outcome of this therapy-conversion method will have unexpected results.Malcolm McDowell in the best performance of his extended professional life fleshes Alex de Large. Michael Bates is very good too as Chief Guard.As is his trade mark, Stanley Kubrick, uses non-original music score outstandingly.

The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence"". Strange beginning for a movie, don't you think?. Disregarding that, that's the way in which this movie starts, and more or less what you can expect from the rest of ""A Clockwork Orange"".This film tells the story of Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell), a teenager that has his own gang, and that does all kind of despicable things, from robbery and battery to rape, all without remorse of any kind. This band of outlaws has its own slang (""nadsat"", a mixture of English and Russian) and dress code, and only one law: violence. Due to a fall out with the rest of the gang, Alex is caught by the police after commiting murder, and condemned to spend 14 years in jail.Looking for a way to get out of jail early, Alex volunteers for a ground-breaking experiment, that supposedly transforms criminals into law-abiding citizens. He is chosen, and ""conditioned"" against violence, the end result being that he feels nauseous merely by the idea of committing a violent or sexual act. A secondary effect is that he now hates the music he had always loved, Beethoven's 9th symphony.As a consequence of all this, Alex gets an early release from jail, and is thrown into the world without any kind of defense mechanism. The truth is, he has to be a model citizen because he doesn't have any other option. In a way, Alex is like a machine (a ""clockwork orange""), because his actions are preordained. But how will the world treat this new Alex?. And do his actions have any kind of merit, if they aren't inspired on free will?. You can answer one of those two questions quite easily if you watch ""A Clockwork Orange"". The other involves a conclusion you will have to reach for yourself after watching the movie and reflecting on it for a while.A word of caution is in order, though. ""A Clockwork Orange"" includes many explicit sex scenes, lots of violence, and parts that will make you recoil in disgust. If you think I'm exaggerating, take into account that even nowadays this movie is not for sale to persons under age 18, and that when it was first released in 1971 it received an ""X"" rating.Finally, I want to point out that this movie is based on a book of the same name written by Anthony Burgess, that significantly differs from the film, especially in what regards to the ending. Furthermore, I think it is worthwhile to highlight the fact that Burgess didn't like his own book too much, and absolutely hated Stanley Kubrick's filmic version of it. Unfortunately for him, the movie helped to promote the book, and ""A Clockwork Orange"" has becomed Burgess' most well-known work.All in all, and as a conclusion, I think this film is worth watching, and I recommend you to do so if you believe you can stomach the violent parts in order to eventually understand the message beneath them. I prefer to watch other kind of films, but I understand that this is a classic, and that as such it should be watched at least once.Belen Alcat",4,"I prefer to watch other kind of films, but ...",1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,3292,"['was', 'Alex', 'three', 'droogs', 'Pete', 'Georgie', 'Dim', 'sat', 'Korova', 'Milkbar', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'rassoodocks', 'what', 'do', 'evening', 'Korova', 'milkbar', 'sold', 'milk-plus', 'milk', 'vellocet', 'synthemesc', 'drencrom', 'what', 'were', 'drinking', 'would', 'sharpen', 'up', 'make', 'ready', 'bit', 'old', 'ultra-violence', 'Strange', 'beginning', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Disregarding', 'way', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'rest', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '.This', 'film', 'story', 'Alex', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'teenager', 'own', 'gang', 'kind', 'despicable', 'things', 'robbery', 'battery', 'rape', 'remorse', 'kind', 'band', 'outlaws', 'own', 'slang', 'nadsat', 'mixture', 'English', 'Russian', 'dress', 'code', 'only', 'one', 'law', 'violence', 'Due', 'fall', 'out', 'rest', 'gang', 'Alex', 'caught', 'police', 'commiting', 'murder', 'condemned', 'spend', '14', 'years', 'jail.Looking', 'way', 'get', 'jail', 'early', 'Alex', 'volunteers', 'ground-breaking', 'experiment', 'supposedly', 'criminals', 'law-abiding', 'citizens', 'chosen', 'conditioned', 'violence', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'nauseous', 'merely', 'idea', 'committing', 'violent', 'sexual', 'act', 'secondary', 'effect', 'now', 'music', 'had', 'always', 'loved', 'Beethoven', '9th', 'symphony.As', 'consequence', 'Alex', 'early', 'release', 'jail', 'thrown', 'world', 'kind', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'truth', 'be', 'model', 'citizen', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'option', 'way', 'Alex', 'machine', 'clockwork', 'orange', 'actions', 'are', 'preordained', 'how', 'will', 'world', 'treat', 'new', 'Alex', 'do', 'actions', 'have', 'kind', 'merit', 'are', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'free', 'will', 'can', 'answer', 'one', 'two', 'questions', 'quite', 'easily', 'watch', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'other', 'conclusion', 'will', 'have', 'reach', 'watching', 'movie', 'reflecting', 'while.A', 'word', 'caution', 'order', 'though', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'many', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'lots', 'violence', 'parts', 'will', 'make', 'recoil', 'disgust', 'think', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'take', 'account', 'even', 'movie', 'not', 'sale', 'persons', 'age', '18', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1971', 'received', 'X', 'rating.Finally', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'significantly', 'film', 'especially', 'what', 'regards', 'ending', 'Furthermore', 'think', 'worthwhile', 'highlight', 'fact', 'Burgess', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'own', 'book', 'too', 'much', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'filmic', 'version', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'helped', 'promote', 'book', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'becomed', 'Burgess', 'most', 'well-known', 'work.All', 'conclusion', 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'recommend', 'do', 'so', 'believe', 'can', 'stomach', 'violent', 'parts', 'order', 'eventually', 'understand', 'message', 'beneath', 'prefer', 'watch', 'other', 'kind', 'films', 'understand', 'classic', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'least', 'once.Belen', 'Alcat']",N/A

So which version is it, X or R?  Not as simple to answer as it may seem...The original theatrical release in 1971 was rated X.  According to IMDB, the movie was re-released in 1973 with three editorial changes (see IMDB under ""ACO""/ Trivia for a description of the changes).  That altered 1973 version was rated R by the MPAA.  (This is not unheard of: Paramount did the same thing with ""Saturday Night Fever,"" re-editing the R film to a PG to allow Travolta's teenage fans to see it in re-release.)By the time the first Home Video release of ""A Clockwork Orange"" came out (mid-'80s), the climate for sex and violence in the moves had changed and the original X version was considered to be more properly an R, and so the original, unaltered X version was released on Home Video with its new R rating.  (IMDB says the MPAA did not re-rate it for Home Video, that the studio simply changed it.  Having worked at a major studio for some years, I don't believe the MPAA would allow a studio to change an MPAA rating without their input; they own the ratings system. But, with or without them, the original X version has always been the one released on Home Video, with an R rating). That re-edited R version from 1973 has not seen the light of day since, and was never released on Home Video in any format.Bottom line (I said it wasn't going to be simple):  This DVD contains the original, unaltered, X-rated version, which is now distributed with an R rating.Thanks to Prof Cicero for his help with this history.",5,"Is This the ""X"" Version Or the ""R"" Version?

This is a classic that just goes to show you how great films can be.  There is no equal to this movie.  This is a movie that must be seen by all movie lovers.Alex is a troubled youth, who plays hookey and hangs around with his friends, (or ""droogs, as he calls them).  They are the most reckless, violent, offensive, and careless sort who feels no sympathy for anyone or anything.  Well, all of that changes one night when Alex is caught up in an accidental murder and is sent to prison.  He is then found eligible for a rehabilitation program, which proves to take its toll on the young hoodlum.  This is a dark and briliant film, which also proves to be a bit of a satire about governments and rehab programs.I loved this movie.  It was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who never missed a beat when it came to directing haunting and disturbing films that enhances the brain.  The images are disturbing and beautiful at the same time.  Malcom McDowell is a fine actor in this movie, spewing out dialogue that sounds like poetry.I know this DVD set is tough to find, but if you can, it's worth it.  Though, there are no different special features, the picture is remastered and the second disk is the soundtrack.Most memorable scene in the movie:  When Alex and the gang are beating up a couple in their home.  As he is kicking and stomping the man, he is singing ""Singin' in the Rain.""  What once was something so innocent and sweet is transformed into something so hideous and violent.  I loved it!This is what film making is all about.  I plan to read the book as soon as I can.  ""A Clockwork Orange,"" is, and will forever be, a true classic.  This movie is flawless, or at least I think so.  If you are a movie lover of true classics, see this movie as soon as you can.  If you've already seen it, SEE IT AGAIN!  It's nice to know that there are still quality films out there that actually feed the mind.  Beautiful and perfect in every way.P.S.  We will forever miss you, Stanley Kubrick.

They present the film's story with  tremendous effect.Therein lies what makes the film horrible.  McDowell  plays Alex, a thug who spends his days raping, robbing, and otherwise  violating the lives of innocent people.  He is arrested and subjected to a  government experiment to make thugs into clockwork oranges - drugs and  hypnosis rob Alex of his aggression and make him repelled by sexuality, and  thus unable to commit any further crimes.  But the experiment blows up in  the face of the government; by robbing Alex of his aggression, they've also  robbed him of his ability to defend himself, so when his victims come  calling, you don't have to imagine the vengeance they exact.  Thus  horrified, the government turns Alex back to his normal degenerate  self.There is supposed to be a moral lesson here, but we're not sure  what it is.  Kubrick establishes Alex as a worthless punk, but we are meant  to be more horrified that he would be made docile and thus unable to defend  himself when his victims get even with him.  Provocative, yes, but such a  theme also insults the viewer's intelligence; why should we sympathize with  a man who deserves to be brutalized?

I saw this film many, many times over the years including it's initial release, which Kubrick controlled.  Each theatre was shipped two new prints of the film and they would run it for a week and then switch to the second print, ship back the first print and be sent another one so that each print would only play for a week.  This was back in the day when movies would only play at a single theatre during their first run.  These films could run for months. No previews before the film during it's initial first run (which Warner respects here once again)  He even insisted that the theatre curtain be open at all times.  What a perfectionest!  Over the years, through VHS tapes, laserdiscs and DVD releases and even a showing on HDNET movies,  this is the best and almost perfect presentation of the film. There isn't a speck on it and the bright and sometimes muted colors are just amazing.  The sound has been mixed into 5.1 surround.  It's a magnificent accomplishment.  I greatly look forward to the high def edition of ""2001: a space odyssey"".

85719,A2M1N8G4W4END8,0790701022,Michael R Gates,"[4, 4]","Stanley Kubrick's 1971 adaptation of the classic Anthony Burgess novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a thriller for thinkers.  That is, it is a frightening but compelling SF-ish flick that, like the novel, is wrapped around deep socio-political and philosophical subtext.  It warns about the dangers of blithe, government-dictated social conformity, yet it also cautions against allowing citizens to indulge in so much freedom that society becomes unsafe and anarchic.  In other words, it forces viewers to ponder the question of just how far citizens of a society can have their free will restricted before they cease to be truly free...or truly human.Set in an England of the &quot;near&quot; future, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE paints a picture of a British dystopia that, in some respects, is more horrific and more depressing--and in retrospect, closer to the reality of the 3+ decades that have passed since its release--than the Oceania of Orwell's 1984.  Malcolm McDowell stars as Alex de Large, a teenage ruffian who nightly roams the streets of his hometown with a gang of other sadistic young hoodlums (his &quot;droogs&quot;) and engages in acts of &quot;ultra-violence&quot; (i.e., robbery, rape, pummelings, murder, etc.).  Other such gangs of thugs also roam the streets at night, so going outside after dark is a dangerous prospect for the average citizen.Following a botched burglary and murder, Alex is temporarily blinded and left behind by his craven droogs.  Young Alex is arrested for the murder when the police arive, and soon after he is found guilty and sentenced to a lengthy prison term.  But he thinks he has secured his quick ticket to freedom when he is accepted into a program that promises to &quot;cure&quot; his violent propensities and, upon successful completion of the program, nullify his prison sentence.  Unbeknownst to Alex, though, is that the procedure is based on Pavlovian conditioning techniques, meaning that Alex won't be &quot;cured&quot; so much as he will be brainwashed into autonomically behaving like a respectable, law-abiding citizen.Due to the nature of the film's subject matter--and, of course, to help drive home its subtextual message--A CLOCKWORK ORANGE contains many disturbing and violent scenes, including the depiction of a beating and rape during which Alex &quot;kicks&quot; out his rendition of &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  Some viewers, especially those not normally inclined towards watching horror or crime dramas, have a difficult time looking past the violence and delving into the film's subtext.  For those folks, it might be easier to emotionally and intellectually grasp the theme of Kubrick's film if they FIRST read Burgess' novel.  (For most viewers, though, enjoyment of the movie does not require familiarity with the novel.)A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is fairly loyal to the source material, though Burgess' complete work includes a final chapter that is not depicted in the film.  Supposedly this is because Kubrick only had access to the American edition of the book--this despite the fact that he was an American expatriate living in England--in which the last chapter had been removed because Burgess' American editors considered it inconsistent with the rest of the novel.  Literary purists, who will often make value judgments about a film based on its adherence to the printed source, will probably be put off by Kubrick's purportedly inadvertent omission.  However, as with any other well-made film, it should be judged solely on its own merits.With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick questions the perceptions of freedom and the concepts of crime and punishment in Western society.  The film is a truculent and thought-provoking socio-political satire that, after more than three decades, still retains its ability to shock viewers into philosophical rumination.  Of course, Kubrick's excellent script and tight direction contribute to the film's success in eliciting such a reaction, but so does Malcolm McDowell's energetic and compelling performance as Alex, that rare protagonist who is equally reprehensible and pitiable.All in all, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is an excellent and still-relevant classic that belongs in the collection of any serious lover of great movies.",4,"Viddy Well, O My Brothers and Sisters.

Alex ( Malcolm McDowell)is a man that loves to fight, rob, rape, and kill. However, his luck finally runs out and he is captured. While imprisoned, he undergoes treatment to render him &quot; safe&quot; to the world around him, which is refered to as a &quot; Clockwork Orange&quot;. While Alex is made to look perfectly normal on the outside, he is crippled by reflex mechanisms beyond his control on the inside. This prevents him from committing any acts of violence whatsoever. After Alex's release, things go from bad to worse however, when his &quot;cure&quot; leaves him defenseless to the revenge of his victims.&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is Stanley Kubrick's best film, and one of my favorite films overall. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still be amazed everytime. I have never been as shocked as I was when I saw this film. The first 20 minutes involves two brutal beatings and an extremely graphic rape scene. It only gets more shocking from there on out. The story also offers a hilarious sense of irony. Alex is supposedly cured of all his afflictions, but is thrust back into a world of violence when forced to deal with his victims. The camera work used in this film is amazing, and the music is wonderful. All of the actors do an outstanding job in this film, but Malcom McDowell gives one of the most memorable performances ever as Alex. I have never experienced such a use of my emotions before when dealing with a fictional character. He will make you hate him and shock you with how he acts before he is captured. But then Alex makes you feel almost sorry for him with what he has to go through afterwards.Stanley Kubrick has made some great movies with &quot;2001: A Space Oddesey&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Strangelove....&quot; In my opinion however, &quot; A Clockwork Orange&quot; is his best film. The overall story, acting, music, camera work, and truly shocking scenes set it apart from the rest. It is definately a must own, because it only gets better with repeated viewings.

It's a very visual piece, with plenty of colourful imagery punctuated by classical music that is used to great effect in some of the most disturbing scenes.  As for the violent scenes, they're mostly tastefully done, with less focus put on the act themselves than on the perpetrators and the victims.  This is particularly impressive in a day where movies measure themselves on body count more than anything else.The story itself though, is absolutely horrible and particularly the clinic scenes are hard to watch.  The worrying conclusion that society is more concerned with curing the problem than looking at the root of the problem is pertinent even today.Even so, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this film is a masterpiece (a word that has been associated with Kubrick an awful lot - remember that John Carpenter's 'Halloween' was also branded this and then he made 'Vampires').  There are plenty of clich&eacute;s such as the weird and wonderful central character and his love for classical music.

As a  typical Kubrick film, the first viewing may leave you feeling alittle  unsure of what to think, but go back and watch again, for as Speilberg put  it 'the more you watch Kubrick's films, the better they become and that is  the mark of a true talent'. Or, perhaps in this case, more appropriately,  as Alex puts it 'Viddy well, thy brother, viddy well'.",5,A near masterpiece,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,786,"['try', 'summarise', 'film', 'few', 'lines', 'not', 'repeat', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'impossible', 'movie', 'true', 'master', 'craftman', 'height', 'powers', 'threading', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'scenes', 'together', 'way', 'whole', 'far', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'use', 'music', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'superb', 'clearly', 'McDowell', 'best', 'performance', 'direction', 'simply', 'peerless', 'typical', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'may', 'leave', 'feeling', 'alittle', 'unsure', 'what', 'think', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'Speilberg', 'put', 'more', 'watch', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'better', 'become', 'mark', 'true', 'talent', 'perhaps', 'case', 'more', 'appropriately', 'Alex', ""'Viddy"", 'well', 'thy', 'brother', 'viddy', 'well']",N/A

Wills ""Vicksykate""","[3, 7]","The primary question which springs to mind when viewing Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" surely has to be: where should our sympathy lie? A literary adaptation from Anthony Burgess' book of the same name, Kubrick intended for the film to question the roles that government play in punishment of convicted criminals and ask ""Does the state portray the same disregard for humanity as the rapists and muderers they punish""? He was condeming the treatment of Alex as well as Alex's actions, allowing us to feel no real empathy for any of the characters in the film. We are positioned to feel, if anything, a sense of understanding and compassion towards Alex himself as narrator and victim of the state, but to me it seems wrong somehow to focus upon the ""wrong doing"" of the ministers and forget the irreperable damage Alex has done to get there.I may be outrageously right wing, but I feel that a lot of the ""treatment"" Alex recieves is small punishment for the torture he inflicted on others in his days as a teenage hoodlum. It would be very easy, as an audience member, to see Alex kicked out of his house, beaten by police officers (his former groupies) and sick at the sound of Beethoven's 9th, to feel sympathy and compassion towards the boy's suffering and anguish, but this would mean expelling all knowledge of his past deeds. Indeed, by the end of the film Alex has come full circle and appears rewarded for his 'troubles', by being returned to normal and given a government position! The prevention of his former violence is no longer 'in session' and so he is free and unpunished, back to normal and seemingly unaffected by what has happened to him. He even has his beloved Ludwig Van back!This film is really expertley made, and sticks to the origional language of it's base text and the morals and values that lie behind it. However, I can't help but think the film shows a destorted ethical picture of criminal punishment in todays society, the condemnation of the state apparent throughout. In my opinion, Alex got everything he deserved, and in the end the government went too far trying to compensate his pain for the media masses.

85739,AB1OA9RKZZD62,0790701022,Namyriah,"[4, 6]","In reviewing any movie, one big factor is: Is is interesting?  Does it hold the audience's attention?  Does the guy in the seat NOT want to make a trip to the restroom for fear he'll miss something?  For Clockwork Orange, the answer to all those is a resounding ""Yes!""  When something is that interesting, I have to give it at least 3 stars.  I don't give it 4 or 5 stars because, frankly, it's trashy and reprehensible.  But it's not boring.  Stanley Kubrick accomplished something that few directors and writers (he was both) manage to pull off: he created images and dialogue that stick with you days after you've seen the movie.  What a shame that the images are so nasty.Looking at this movie 22 years after its release, it's hard to see just what all the controversy was about.  Yes, it's violent, plus lots of sex and nudity, enough that it was initially rated X, but the sex and violence are pretty tame by today's standards.  The artsy types like to discuss the ""message"" or ""meaning"" of the movie, as it if there was something REAL DEEP underneath the yuck.  Well, looking at it as objectively as I can, I think the meaning is pretty clear, and very much in keeping with the youth culture of the late 60s and early 70s: Better to be a promiscuous, screwed-up, thuggish young person than a bored and boring ""square"" over 30.  There is no NICE character in the movie--not one.  But Alex, ""your humble narrator,"" is definitely an INTERESTING character, despite his hobbies of drugs (consumed in milk), gang-rape, street fighting, etc.  Also, he has one thing that sets him apart from his fellow ""droogs""--he's a fan of Beethoven, so he's no ordinary sleazebag but a sleazebag with taste.  And guess what? This scummy anti-hero actually appealed to a lot of people in their late teens and early 20s when this movie was released.  No one could believe in a saint or hero from that demographic, but what they could believe in was an attractive, witty, smart-alecky young guy who gave in to all his primal urges and made no apologies.  The people he victimizes are presented as barely human at all: uptight, blah, rule-fixated, barely alive.  So Kubrick's ""message"" is pretty straightforward: the young people of the world may be a sorry lot, but better to be them than the joyless, hypocritical, vindictive ""Establishment.""Early in the movie, we see Alex and his pals beat a suburban husband, then gang-rape his wife while he lies whimpering on the floor. (Alex croons ""Singin' in the Rain,"" which almost makes the scene comical.)  Later in the movie, we learn the wife died after the ordeal while the husband is confined to a wheelchair.  But when he holds Alex a prisoner in his home, it's clear we're supposed to sympathize with poor Alex, not the husband, who can barely control his rage.  He's depicted as a bad guy--as are all the people connected with the police, courts, and prison, even worse are the sinister-looking psychiatrists who use aversion therapy to cure Alex (or so they hope) of his evil urges.  When Alex and his chums are beating up a homeless man, a husband, or a rival gang, the violence looks unreal, almost cartoonlike, so we don't feel much sympathy for the victims.  But when Alex himself is beaten, kicked, and spit on, it seems all too real.  We're supposed to believe, against all the evidence, that this ultra-violent rapist is somehow a ""victim,"" that his depraved lifestyle is more appealing than being ""nice.""  In other words, looked at from the ethical viewpoint, this is one seriously demented movie.But again, it's not boring.  The sets and costumes conjure up a surreal world where it's no surprise that evil is good and good is evil.  Walter Carlos' creepy electronic music is perfect to evoke atmosphere.  Alex's narration is amusing (and ironic), he really does seem to possess a human soul underneath his depravity, and his various enemies, though one-dimensional characters, provide a lot of humor, and for such a depressing story, there are quite a few laughs to be had.  While in prison, Alex becomes an aide to the prison chaplain (who wears a really bad toupee), and when he tells the chaplain that he is learning to enjoy the Bible, we see inside Alex's fantasies, and the parts of the Bible he enjoys are its stories of war and sleeping with concubines.  He even fantasizes that he is a Roman soldier, lashing Jesus as he carries his cross to Calvary.It is worth watching?  Probably, but I wouldn't watch it with Aunt Edna, or with the kids.  Given the way women are treated in the movie, I wouldn't watch it with a roomful of hard-core feminists either.  It would be a perfect pairing with Five Easy Pieces, another popular (and depressing) movie that celebrates the angry young man revolting against the Establishment. In A Clockwork Orange, families suck, religion sucks, politicians suck, the legal system sucks, even people in the ""helping professions"" suck, everyone sucks - except wild youth like Alex.If you do watch this, you might want to ""cleanse your palate"" with something else - like,",3,"Celebrating Thugs, Drugs, Jugs, and Priests with Rugs",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,5053,"['reviewing', 'movie',

Well, take a look around you.....violence has become the accepted norm, going from fists and clubs to strapped on bombs and wired up cars.We still find the blood lust a fascinating human trait, and celebrate it in literature, art and cinema and practice it in our daily lives.  What I believe is the most pertinent example of the &#34;bully boys&#34; of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE are the school children who bring their weapons to school and decimate their classmates....were they inspired by the uberviolence of Burgess's characters or other horror sharers, or was it a mental abberation that was put into play along with the support of the society that gave them access to weapons of death?There are many caveats presented in the film that would require a wake up call to the viewers, but like the freeway driver who slows down to stare at an accident across the road, we are mesmerized by the violence but rarely connect it with the real world.Kubrick has stepped back from pointing a finger or condemning an action by overemphasizing the inherent madness that plays itself out with these lost &#34;boys&#34; and presents an almost comedic sneer at the stupidity and lack of humanity that has almost become second nature to society today.  Many say that this novel and CATCHER IN THE RYE are the reason that so many of the disenfranchised turn to violence and murder.  I say there has to be a glitch somewhere in the brain of many that points them towards destruction if they are not dealt with by those who have an ability to re-structure certain behaviors.  Our brain is teachable, changeable and capable of creating some of the greatest gifts to humankind.....A CLOCKWORK ORANGE takes it all, mixes it into a dystopian world and leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision.....or lets them skip down the road singing in the rain......this is a thinker of a film!!!!!",5,Everything Old Is New Again,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2200,"['Anthony', 'Burgess', 'fall', 'category', 'peopled', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'Aldous', 'Huxley', 'Nostrodamus', 'George', 'Orwell', 'few', 'others', 'prognostical', 'abilities', 'are', 'often', 'ignored', 'just', 'admired', 'imagination', 'good', 'detective', 'work', '..until', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'very', 'closely', 'how', 'were', 'written', 'about', 'originally', 'Well', 'take', 'look', '..violence', 'become', 'accepted', 'norm', 'going', 'fists', 'clubs', 'strapped', 'bombs', 'wired', 'up', 'cars.We', 'still', 'find', 'blood', 'fascinating', 'human', 'trait', 'celebrate', 'literature', 'art', 'cinema', 'practice', 'daily', 'lives', 'What', 'believe', 'most', 'pertinent', 'example', '34', 'bully', '34', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'are', 'school', 'children', 'who', 'bring', 'weapons', 'school', 'decimate', 'classmates', '.were', 'inspired', 'uberviolence', 'Burgess', 'characters', 'other', 'horror', 'sharers', 'was', 'mental', 'abberation', 'was', 'put', 'play', 'support', 'society', 'gave', 'access', 'weapons', 'death', 'are', 'many', 'caveats', 'presented', 'film', 'would', 'require', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'viewers', 'freeway', 'driver', 'who', 'down', 'stare', 'accident', 'road', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'violence', 'rarely', 'connect', 'real', 'world.Kubrick', 'stepped', 'back', 'pointing', 'finger', 'condemning', 'action', 'overemphasizing', 'inherent', 'madness', 'out', 'lost', '34', 'boys', '34', 'almost', 'comedic', 'sneer', 'stupidity', 'lack', 'humanity', 'almost', 'become', 'second', 'nature', 'society', 'today', 'Many', 'say', 'novel', 'CATCHER', 'IN', 'THE', 'RYE', 'are', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'disenfranchised', 'turn', 'violence', 'murder', 'say', 'there', 'be', 'glitch', 'somewhere', 'brain', 'many', 'towards', 'destruction', 'are', 'not', 'dealt', 'who', 'have', 'ability', 're-structure', 'certain', 'behaviors', 'brain', 'teachable', 'changeable', 'capable', 'creating', 'greatest', 'gifts', 'humankind', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'mixes', 'dystopian', 'world', 'up', 'viewer', 'make', 'own', 'decision', '..or', 'skip', 'down', 'road', 'singing', 'rain', 'thinker', 'film']",N/A

It is not a five star movie by any means but it is a good one all the same. Essentially the story, derived from the inventive book of the same name by Anthony Burgess, is set sometime in the future (looks very dated though and the book's slang dialogue can be a little off-putting), about a young leader of a gang of thugs who spends his free time raping, stealing, joyriding, fighting and eventually murdering. He is sent to prison where he volunteers for an experiment to help cure him of his ultra-violent tendencies. However, even though the experiment works (with a small musical side-effect), it is very little more than just a political gimmick to win votes. While on release he encounters everybody that he did wrong too but can not defend himself because he gets sick whenever he gets angry or is aroused.The acting, score and camerawork are on top form but the film suffers from the confines of its restrictive storyline leaving very little room for character development, except for that of the protagonist. What it does not lack in is violence or plenty of moral proclamations about the world in general. It is more of a philosophical statement about the nature of a corrective society than anything else. Everyone seems just as guilty as the other and Kubrick has no qualms about turning the husband of a rape victim into a sinister materialist who exploits anything to his advantage.There are no ""good"" people in this film and even our horror star of the show has his turn at the innocent victim in the end. The film is a strange play on society in general but does not really merit repetitive viewing. As a side note the film was banned in Great Britain for years. Kubrick pulled the film from distribution himself because he felt that England was not ready for his film. He would also not allow the former Soviet Union or the Eastern Block to watch it either. He certainly was a bit of an odd character and even though critics hold Kubrick as a master director he did make a lot of bunk films too.

Those who say it  glorifies violence and rape clearly don't know what in Hell they're talking  about. The sheer monstrousness of the anti-hero's actions is meant to serve  as a backdrop for his frightful curative treatment. Rape is never, ever  presented as something either desirable or acceptable. Rather, its  monstrousness is such that the offender must be captured and prevented from  ever doing so again. No one would say rape is acceptable, and neither  Burgess nor Kubrick tries to convey this idea. It is all Kafkaesque  melodrama.

It is still as shocking to the senses now as it was when I first viewed it.Story: In brief, the movie tells the tale of a 15-year-old youth (in an English setting) and his perchance for ""ultra violence"". The movie opens with Alex and his droogs (a gang of three other youths) sitting in the local ""milk bar"" and preparing for a night on the town. Upon finishing their laced (druged) milk, the gang heads out in search of adventure and soon meets up with ""Billy-boy's"" gang where they have a violent scuffle.Coming out winners, Alex and his droogs steal a car and drive out into the countryside where they come upon the home of a polical activist. They bluff their way into the home then proceed to brutalize the husband and rape the wife.As the plot unfolds, Alex feels that Georgie (one of his droogs) and the others are getting a little out of line since they speak up about what is to take place the next evening as they sit in the milk bar. He feels his authority is being threatened. Alex pretends to go along, but disciplines his cohorts upon leaving the bar by beating them, tossing them in a canal and cutting the hand of Dim (another of the droogs).Later, acting on the theory that a good general knows when to punish his troops and when to reward them, Alex treats his gang, now sullen and quiet, to refreshments in the milk bar. He formulates the plans for the evening which takes the gang to the home of the ""cat woman"" where they break in. Alex attacks the woman with a phalic statue and accidentally kills her. Running from the house, Alex is met just outside by members of his gang who smash a milk bottle against his head, leaving Alex wounded and unconscious for the arriving police.Now in jail, Alex works on being a model prisoner in order to qualify for an early release through volunteering for a special reconditioning being experimented with for violent criminals. Alex is accepted for the treatments and is conditioned to become extremely ill when he witnesses or has thoughts of committing violent acts. A final test and show is made for an audience of prison officials and community leaders to demonstrate the now ""tamed"" Alex. He will be, so claims the scientist at the demonstration, the model citizen ... incapable of acting against society.Alex is released from prison and runs into several misfortunes; including the osterization by his own family who has now taken a boarder in as a replacement for him; a meeting with a group of vagabounds who remember being assualted by Alex and his gang earlier; and a meeting with two of his former droogs who are now poliemen.Alex winds up (after being beaten and almost drowned by his former friends) in the home of the man whose wife he raped previously. The man is now restricted to a wheelchair and his wife had died as a result of the beating and rape. The activist is aware of the government's experiment with Alex and plans to use this as a weapon against that current government. However, the writer does not immediately recognize Alex personally until he hears him singing in the bathtub. It's the same song (Singing in the Rain) that Alex was vocalizing while beating the man and raping his wife earlier.Our writer friend nearly has a conniption and has Alex drugged (by his male bodyguard, Julius) during dinner and locked in an upstairs room. During his treatment, Alex had inadvertently been conditioned against his favorite music, Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The writer now plays this at top volume in an act of vengence against his former assailant. Alex, unable to stop the music and unable to bear the pain hearing it brings, throws himself out of a window and onto the pavement below.Waking up in the hospital with a broken body and wrapped in casts and bandages, his conditioning has somehow been broken. The former government representative and opponent of the polical writer brings, as a gift, a new sterophonic set playing the fourth movement of Beethoven's ninth (Ode to Joy). The film closes with Alex and the government official being photographed together and smiling ... and Alex slipping into a fantasy of raping a woman while others look on.Opinion: This is a very strong film -- one which will likely upset some people and is certainly not for the eyes of children, nor would I say, teenagers either. There is a great deal of graphic violence in the movie although there is little to no strong language. Still, it has its place in the archives of good films and should not be forgotten. Some will say that it is a work of genius by Stanley Kubrick. Others will condemn it as trash. The starring role of Alex (played by Malcolm McDowel) has been hailed as an exceptional performance. I would certainly have to agree there. Malcolm gives the character of Alex depth and an underlying propensity to aggression. Just looking at Alex's expression at times during the film will bring shivers to your spine as you peer into the eyes of a psychopath. One can't help wonder what Alex is thinking as he looks at you (the audience).The movie has a message contained in all of the scenes, basically saying that while society may try to make a person (a criminal if you will) into a useful member of that society through forced conditioning (a Clockwork Orange so to speak), the true nature of the person will eventually win out and the conditioning broken. I may be missing other messages there as well, but that seems to be the predominant one.This is a unique movie (to say the least) and one I think all mature adults ought to view if only to form an opinion of their own about it. I wouldn't think it would be a good show to play for a real life victim of a rape or assault, though. Probably too much of a traumatic experience would be revitalized. So use some discretion.Technical:  Very little to say here. It is up to today's standards in DVD's and is available in several formats and releases. The old prints from the original have been repaired and an excellent copy of the film is the result. Naturally, sound quality is up to par as well. You'll not be disappointed there.Recommendation:  As I stated before, this is not a movie for all audiences. Many will miss the message the film sends through being shocked at the visual display (though there is no excessive blood or gore). It is certainly not a film for any children below the age of 13 and I would venture to say that it is not something I would want my teenagers to be watching. Minds are too impressionable during the teen years. Those over the age of 18 should be suffiently mature and developed to watch the film and decide for themselves.Recommended with caution.~P~",4,Masterpiece or just a mess?,1304467200,"05 4,

85759,A3E27LSDU7FAQK,0790701022,Peter,"[2, 14]","This movie will most likely attract :1) Those who saw the movie at the time it came out ( the ""real"" fans)2) Those who have never entertained ideas of the type ""what if""3) Those who've never taken a philosophy or psychology class.4) Those for whom this is their first experience with ""strange"" or ""psychological"" movies.If you happen to belong to none of the groups above, It is very likely you will not find this movie  to be so profound as many claim.So what's are some of  the themes found in this movie?Should bad people be transformed into ""good""  people by means of brainwashing them ( or any means really)? Is that morally correct?Does being good depend on your upbringing and the things that have happened to you? ( Like the writer who seemed to be a nice guy but after his wife was killed was more than happy to seek revenge and torture the guy who killed his wife).I mean, I'm sure there are countless of themes you could find here ( or in any newspaper story) but i think the movie is mainly based on whether it should be ok to transform criminals into non violent individuals by any means ( and therefore robbing them of their Free Will).why do I give this movie a 1 star? Because I don't find anything profound or ""new"" to make me like it.I don't see what's so great about it. I think I understand the movie, but I don't think it deserves the attention that has been given. But with the points made above, I can see why some would love this movie. I mean if you have never been exposed to different possibilities, if you have never used conversations as ways of thinking about philosophy and psychology and the many possibilities when it comes to free will, love, hate, revenge, etc etc then this movie might do it for you. I'm still wondering what I'm missing.If I was to explain to a child about the possibility of a Utopia, he might find it so interesting because maybe he had never held that idea in his mind. But If I try to bring that idea into someone who has been exposed to those ideas for a while, he might find it boring and might feel as if everything has been said already.This is the way I feel about this movie. Don't get me wrong, I find the idea of freewill fascinating, but I don't think this movie challenged my mind in any way to see the free will discussions in a different light. Take for example the movie  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. This movie has a philosophical aspect to it. ( please ignore if you are planning to see that movie)  Would you erase someone from your memory if you could? This is probably a question I had been exposed to before I even watched the movie. But the movie added another philosophical twist to it. What if a couple erased each other from their memory, and on top of that, met each other again and fell in love again without realizing they knew each other before? Now this is something mind blowing. This will definitely get you thinking. It will get you excited. Not because I have never thought about this possibility before, but because the movies is put in such a way that it gets your mind thinking about possibilities. It expands your mind.PS: It is very possible I would have enjoyed this movie more if I would have been exposed to it before when I was younger. But hey, that's how life works. It is also very possible my favorite football team would be different if it wasn't for my family. Sometimes we think we choose something but we really don't. In this case, I might think that I have chosen to dislike this movie but maybe the timing for me to see this movie was not the best. In other words, I'm not entirely choosing to dislike it, it's just that my timing and environment have shaped me to dislike it. And in your case, your timing and environment have shaped you to like it.",1,Good if you have never used your mind to entertain ideas,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,3770,"['movie', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'attract', ':1', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'real', 'fans', '2', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'entertained', 'ideas', 'type', 'what', '3', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'taken', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'class.4', 'whom', 'first', 'experience', 'strange', 'psychological', 'movies.If', 'happen', 'belong', 'none', 'groups', 'very', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'profound', 'many', 'claim.So', 'what', 'are', 'themes', 'found', 'movie', 'Should', 'bad', 'people', 'be', 'transformed', 'good', 'people', 'means', 'brainwashing', 'means', 'really', 'morally', 'correct', 'Does', 'being', 'good', 'depend', 'upbringing', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'writer', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'seek', 'revenge', 'torture', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', '.I', 'mean', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'countless', 'themes', 'could', 'find', 'here', 'newspaper', 'story', 'i', 'think', 'movie', 'mainly', 'based', 'should', 'be', 'ok', 'transform', 'criminals', 'non', 'violent', 'individuals', 'means', 'therefore', 'robbing', 'Free', 'Will', '.why', 'do', 'give', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'profound', 'new', 'make', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'think', 'understand', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'attention', 'been', 'given', 'points', 'made', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'mean', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'exposed', 'different', 'possibilities', 'have', 'never', 'used', 'conversations', 'ways', 'thinking', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'many', 'possibilities', 'when', 'free', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'revenge', 'etc', 'etc', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'do', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'what', ""'m"", 'missing.If', 'was', 'explain', 'child', 'possibility', 'Utopia', 'might', 'find', 'so', 'interesting', 'maybe', 'had', 'never', 'held', 'idea', 'mind', 'try', 'bring', 'idea', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'exposed', 'ideas', 'while', 'might', 'find', 'boring', 'might', 'feel', 'everything', 'been', 'said', 'already.This', 'way', 'feel', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'find', 'idea', 'freewill', 'fascinating', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'challenged', 'mind', 'way', 'see', 'free', 'will', 'discussions', 'different', 'light', 'Take', 'example', 'movie', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'movie', 'philosophical', 'aspect', 'please', 'ignore', 'are', 'planning', 'see', 'movie', 'Would', 'erase', 'someone', 'memory', 'could', 'probably', 'question', 'had', 'been', 'exposed', 'even', 'watched', 'movie', 'movie', 'added', 'philosophical', 'twist', 'What', 'couple', 'erased', 'other', 'memory', 'top', 'met', 'other', 'again', 'fell', 'love', 'again', 'realizing', 'knew', 'other', 'Now', 'something', 'mind', 'blowing', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'thinking', 'will', 'get', 'excited', 'Not', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'possibility', 'movies', 'put', 'such', 'way', 'mind', 'thinking', 'possibilities', 'mind.PS', 'very', 'possible', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'hey', 'how', 'life', 'also', 'very', 'possible', 'favorite', 'football', 'team', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'was', ""n't"", 'family', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'choose', 'something', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'case', 'might', 'think', 'have', 'chosen', 'dislike', 'movie', 'maybe', 'timing', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'choosing', 'dislike', 'just', 'timing', 'environment', 'have', 'shaped', 'dislike', 'case', 'timing', 'environment', 'have', 'shaped', 'like']",N/A

My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-ray player or an upconvert DVD player). In this case, the Blu-ray version is MUCH better. The differece is much like the samples used in stores to show the difference betwee regular and high definition--you know, grainy on one side sharp on the other.Although my DVD version is widescreen, it is old enough that it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs.  As a result, it is only as wide as a full screen version and with widescreen aspect ratio it looks like a postage stamp in the middle of the screen. Even worse, the transer is not very good.

Malcolm McDowell stars as Alex, the leader of a bunch of droogs, living in futuristic England.  The droogs are a bunch of vicious, unrepentant hoodlums who take joy in merciless beating people and in living a life of crime and ill repute.  Alex's favorite pastimes are drinking milk laced with drugs and listening to Beethoven.  One of the more disturbing scenes is when Alex and his droogs rape and kill a woman in her own house while her husband watches.  Through it all Alex joyful sings &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot;.  He is eventually arrested and sent to jail for his crimes.  As part of a new governmental program, he is put through a process that will no longer make him a menace to society.  By having him watch gruesome films with his eyes pried open and being shot up with drugs, he is &quot;cured&quot;.  The cure involves anytime that he starts to become violent or has sexual thoughts, he becomes violently ill.  He is released back into society. His parents have rented a room to another person, whom they now treat more like a son. He meets his droogs, who are now cops and they beat him.  One side effect is that during the movies they played his beloved Beethoven and now the sound of his music drives him to pain.  He ironically ends up at the home of his rape victim's and is at first treated nicely as the husband doesn't know who he is.  This all changes when he starts singing &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; in the tub.  He eventually snaps and tries to kill himself.  The film is visually stunning and Mr. McDowell gives the performance of his life as Alex.

It's a bit easier to understand the author's objective -- plus it has a glossary that defines the many invented words, or words that are derived from the Russian language, or words that are a strange mix of English and Russian.  This film was cutting edge when released and remains in that position.  The story unfolds through the acts, feelings, emotions and observations of Alex, the character portrayed by Malcolm McDowell (who is so convincing that he basically could only obtain roles cast for crazed characters thereafter).  This is not material for the faint of heart or those offended by nudity and violence.  Kubrick doesn't throw in nudity and violence for prurient interests but as an integral perspective into Alex's warped vision of the world.  From Rossini's ""The Thieving Magpie,"" to Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" to Beethoven's ""Ninth Symphony"" the viewer/listener is exposed to a great deal of classical music -- much of it synthesized by Wendy Carlos (in a very interesting and creative fashion).  I will never be able to listen to Gene Kelly's ""Singing in the Rain"" and not think of ""A Clockwork Orange.""  The movie outlines the possible success/failure of a government that might attempt any kind of re-programming of the criminal brain.  Like some of Kubrick's other works, the movie somehow successfully intertwines dark drama with hilarity, as well as an uncanny sense of reality, of being ""in the moment"" -- usually during some highly uncomfortable scene.  For those sitting on the fence, I'd say -- the nudity is hardly shocking by today's standards, and the violence is choreographed (thus always distant/farcical).  If you like movies with an intellectual message, try giving this a whirl.  A few (very few) reviewers thought the film was simply ""interesting"" but that they weren't swept away by any of Kubrick's stylistics.  I tend to think such comments are either outright lies or that the men/women who feel this way must have green, Vulcan blood flowing through the veins.

I remember my uncle asking me about ""A Clockwork Orange"" and suggesting that it must be a visual treat.  I realized then that many people may have been expecting the wrong thing when ACO was released.  Nonetheless it IS a visual treat but not in the sense that ""2001: A Space Oddessy"" was.ACO tells the story of a youthful thug named Alex in a not-so-distant future.  The society he lives in has morphed into one of wealth and poverty and plagued by roving gangs of which our anti-hero is one such member.  We are given a series of scenes that underscore his violent brutality.  We are also given a scene or two that tells us this kid isn't beyond hope.  Well, hope, in the eyes of society, rests with a new treatment that recently arrested Alex is going to be the guinea pig for.  The treatment is a paradox in that it turns Alex away from all violence including acting in his own self-defense.  In solving society's problem the fate of the indidual is discounted.""A Clockwork Orange"" does a brilliant job in bringing to life an uncomfortable image of tommorrow and letting us exam an individual such as Alex.  We are filled with anger and disgust with his character but we eventually find ourselves becoming sympathetic.  Alex is excellently protrayed by Malcolm McDowell who has had some excellent roles and some not-so-excellent roles in the past (see ""Caligula"" or, better yet, DON'T see ""Caligula"").  His talent is certainly in focus in ACO.One of the interesting aspects of ACO is the music.  I had the soundtrack for awhile until it mysteriously disappeared.  The classical music was terrific, focussing on Beethoven.  I became enchanted with a little ditty called ""I Want to Marry a Lighthouse Keeper"" which was NOT a work By Beethoven.  This may have been at least one solid connection between ACO and ""2001: A Space Oddessy"" for those looking for one.  Kubrick knows how to make the most out of a musical score.Some years after seeing ACO for the 4th or 5th time, I came across a copy of the book by Anthony Burgess.  After reading it, I saw the movie again.  For some reason I was a bit disappointed with the movie this time.  I can't figure that out because it is one outstanding movie.

85786,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0790701022,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","A Clockwork Orange(released Dec/71)was quite the oddity then(I remember well its premiere)and it still remains so,to me.The film takes place in a dystopian near future world in England and remnants of the 60s are everywhere to be seen.To take on such a novel as Burgess got published in /62,would have been an overwhelming undertaking for most directors,but Kubrick rose to the challenge and it remains one of his better known works.The film stars a myriad of wonderful English actors,but the star of course is McDowell himself,who convincingly portrays the leader/hoodlum of the film.The film is many things,not the least of which would include a pervading darkness,cynicism,perverse sexuality from actual acts to artwork,brutality,humour,pathos and metaphoric story telling.The plot finds McDowell as the leader of a gang.The world he inhabits is filled with such young men who randomly commit unlawful acts of every description.We follow McDowell and his group of misfits from one distasteful incident to another which include beatings,robberies and rapes.They talk in a funny combination of slang,double speak and Yoda-like sentence structure.All is not nirvana in the gang,as slowly but surely two start to rebel against McDowell's leadership.McDowell temporarily puts down the ""uprising"".However one night when he is leaving a home that he had broken into with the help of his boys,they clobber him in the face with a milk bottle.The gang flees and they leave McDowell to the police.McDowell is taken away and imprisoned.His ""rehabilitation"" takes the form of sucking up to the Catholic priest in the jail,but all the time his thoughts are bent towards violence.One day McDowell approaches the priest with the idea of participating in a new program he has heard that can rehabilitate him within two weeks.When a member of Parliament makes a surprise visit to the prison McDowell speaks up and is chosen to enter the program.McDowell thinks this is going to be a lark and his way of drastically reducing his 14 years sentence,two years of which he has already served.The program has McDowell in a theater with his eyes forced wide open,watching unpleasant and violent films on the screen.As he does,his eyes are doused with a chemical.As the program progresses and the more violence he sees the more sick he becomes watching them.To top this off the doctors run the music of Beethoven,which McDowell had previously adored,but after the program it makes him as sick as looking at the films themselves. When the program's two weeks are up McDowell is released.He goes home but his old room in his parents house has been rented out to a stranger.He is forced to leave and his troubles on the street just begin.He first runs into a street drunk his gang had beat at the beginning of the film.He is recognized and McDowell gets a reciprocal beating from him and several other drunks.Two cops then show up which turn out to be two members of his old gang.They take him out to a remote country location and almost drown him in a trough of water.Barely able to walk he makes his way to a house.He is taken in by the resident there,who is in a wheelchair and is looked after by a well built male servant.As McDowell is laying in a warm bathtub he starts to warble""Singing in the Rain"";a big mistake.This is the home he and his gang had entered and crippled its owner and raped his wife,who died shortly after the incident.The owner now recognizes him and decides he will get revenge.He phones two other people and they drug him.He is placed in an upstairs room and when McDowell comes to he is being sonically bombarded with Beethoven's 9th Symphony.This is of course anathema to McDowell who tries to commit suicide by jumping out of the bedroom window.McDowell wakes up in the hospital and is being nursed back to life courtesy of the government.McDowell has become front page news now because of his now""barbaric"" rehabilitation treatment at the hands of the doctors and ultimately the government.The very member of Parliament who put McDowell in the program to begin with in the prison,now visits him.He asks for McDowells ""help"" in getting him out of his jam,in a roundabout way.In return McDowell will get a nice and comfortable job.As McDowell sits there in his bed posing with the politician,the cameras are flashing all around.However in McDowells mind we see his old bent and warped ideas now coming back to the fore,even though he has been considered ""cured"".This film is just chock full of wonderful moments and Kubrick of course was a master of framing and lighting scenes that would remain unforgettable in ones mind.His staging of the drunk being beaten up or the moments leading up to the cat woman's killing are just two that stand out among many.I won't go into the metaphors and possible hidden meanings in this film,as it is full of them,but I think it is best left to film scholars better than I.Suffice it to say Kubrick conveys alot of information but makes it as entertaining as possible,in Kubricks own inimitable style.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:66:1.I found it generally clear and crisp but there were some scenes where colours would fluctuate and film blemishes would appear,so I would recommended a proper remastering of this film be done.Extras include commentary and the trailer.All in all one of Kubricks most memorable and off beat films.It was quite a shocker on its release and it still packs quite the punch today.Between Kubricks great direction and McDowells beautiful portrayal of one heck of a tough and complex role,the movie still shines through.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,"Kubricks ""out there"" film",1362873600,"03 10,

85787,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0790701022,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[15, 16]","A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971)I am probably the last person on Earth who should be watching A Clockwork Orange; I have the combination of having never been a great Stanley Kubrick fan (save Lolita and The Killing) while being a very, very big fan of Anthony Burgess, especially the novel upon which this film is based. That said, it was a much better film that I had ever hoped it would be, though I still think it's quite overrated, in the general scheme of things.The movie turns almost entirely on the performance of Malcolm McDowell. McDowell is, of course, an absolutely brilliant actor when he's in the right role (fantastic in If..., not so much in Cat People, for example), and there are a number of times during this movie that it seems, absurd as the idea may be, that Anthony Burgess originally wrote the character of Alex with McDowell in mind, he's such a perfect fit. McDowell takes what would otherwise be a rather mundane (and hard to understand; the nadsat flows much more easily in the book, and is more understandable) film and lifts it into the realm of the sublime. It's possible to attach the ""virtuoso"" adjective with a straight face, even. McDowell, here anyway, is the brightest of lights.That said, the rest of the film is, in fact, rather mundane. Some of this can be attributed to cuts Kubrick had to make to get the film the R rating it finally ended up with (tales told out of school convey that one particular scene in the film-- you'll recognize it because it's so sped up-- was originally twenty-eight minutes long and reminiscent of the infamous ten-minute shot in Haneke's Funny Games), but-- and I can't believe I'm saying this-- I'm wondering if part of it doesn't have to do with the film's obsessive faithfulness to the book. And, yes, me saying something like this seems the height of folly, but it's the only thing I can come up with to explain why else it might have left me cold.It's impossible to turn a novel, even a slim one, into a two-hour film without making some sacrifices. (Don't believe me? Try it sometime. Adapt your favorite novel into a screenplay, then recruit some friends and give it a read.) Kubrick's screenplay of Burgess' novel is about the most triumphant attempt at sacrificing nothing I've seen, and the movie does play very close to the book's vest. Where the difference lies, as it does in every case where an adaptation is not both written and directed by the author of the original novel (a situation I'm not sure has ever actually occurred), is in the variations, however slight they may be, in the visions of the author, the screenwriter, and the director. There's a level of complexity removed here given that Kubrick both adapted and directed, leaving a consistency of vision in that part of the equation. But it often seemed to me while I was watching the movie that Burgess' subtlety was often undermined by Kubrick's vision. Which is saying something given that sometimes Burgess has all the subtlety of a pile of mouse droppings in the middle of your kitchen table. But he does squash a lot of his social commentary into places where you might not otherwise look for it (and then does something like invent nadsat to give it a nice polish); Kubrick seems to've hunted it all down and brought it to the forefront. Why is Alex's ""Singin' in the Rain"" so memorable? Because it doesn't fit. Why doesn't it fit? Because Kubrick had nothing to do with it, save approve it. McDowell improvised the whole scene. There's no social commentary to be found in Alex's choice of song; it would, in fact, be hard to find a song that can be imbued with less social commentary. And it's that dichotomy that makes the scene so brilliant. When Kubrick is left to his own devices, however, social commentary tends to ooze from the celluloid. Or drop as if from the hind end of a mouse, as it were.None of this, I hasten to add, is to say I don't like the movie. I ended up liking it quite a bit, in spite of myself. It just seems that, as good as it ended up being, it could have been a great deal more, given a director with a somewhat lighter touch at the helm. As it is, however, it's a visual feast with a manic McDowell as your tourguide, and that will do nicely. ***",3,Malcolm McDowell certainly does have acting chops.,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,4243,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1971', 'am', 'probably', 'last', 'person', 'Earth', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'have', 'combination', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'great', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'fan', 'save', 'Lolita', 'Killing', 'being', 'very', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'especially', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'said', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'think', 'quite', 'overrated', 'general', 'scheme', 'things.The', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'performance', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'McDowell', 'course', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'when', 'right', 'role', 'fantastic', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Cat', 'People', 'example', 'are', 'number', 'times', 'movie', 'absurd', 'idea', 'may', 'be', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'originally', 'wrote', 'character', 'Alex', 'McDowell', 'mind', 'such', 'perfect', 'fit', 'McDowell', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'rather', 'mundane', 'hard', 'understand', 'nadsat', 'much', 'more', 'easily', 'book', 'more', 'understandable', 'film', 'lifts', 'realm', 'sublime', 'possible', 'attach', 'virtuoso', 'adjective', 'straight', 'face', 'even', 'McDowell', 'here', 'anyway', 'brightest', 'lights.That', 'said', 'rest', 'film', 'fact', 'rather', 'mundane', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'cuts', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'make', 'get', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'finally', 'ended', 'up', 'tales', 'told', 'school', 'convey', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'film', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'so', 'sped', 'up', 'was', 'originally', 'twenty-eight', 'minutes', 'long', 'reminiscent', 'infamous', 'ten-minute', 'shot', 'Haneke', 'Funny', 'Games', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'part', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'film', 'obsessive', 'faithfulness', 'book', 'yes', 'saying', 'something', 'height', 'folly', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'explain', 'why', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'left', 'cold.It', 'impossible', 'turn', 'novel', 'even', 'slim', 'one', 'two-hour', 'film', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Try', 'sometime', 'Adapt', 'favorite', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'then', 'recruit', 'friends', 'give', 'read', 'Kubrick', 'screenplay', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'most', 'triumphant', 'attempt', 'sacrificing', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'play', 'very', 'close', 'book', 'vest', 'Where', 'difference', 'case', 'where', 'adaptation', 'not', 'written', 'directed', 'author', 'original', 'novel', 'situation', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'actually', 'occurred', 'variations', 'however', 'slight', 'may', 'be', 'visions', 'author', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'level', 'complexity', 'removed', 'here', 'given', 'Kubrick', 'adapted', 'directed', 'leaving', 'consistency', 'vision', 'part', 'equation', 'often', 'seemed', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'Burgess', 'subtlety', 'was', 'often', 'undermined', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'Which', 'saying', 'something', 'given', 'sometimes', 'Burgess', 'subtlety', 'pile', 'mouse', 'droppings', 'middle', 'kitchen', 'table', 'squash', 'lot', 'social', 'commentary', 'places', 'where', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'look', 'then', 'something', 'invent', 'nadsat', 'give', 'nice', 'polish', 'Kubrick', ""'ve"", 'hunted', 'down', 'brought', 'forefront', 'Why', 'Alex', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'so', 'memorable', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Why', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'save', 'approve', 'McDowell', 'improvised', 'whole', 'scene', 'social', 'commentary', 'be', 'found', 'Alex', 'choice', 'song', 'would', 'fact', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'song', 'can', 'be', 'imbued', 'less', 'social', 'commentary', 'dichotomy', 'scene', 'so', 'brilliant', 'When', 'Kubrick', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'however', 'social', 'commentary', 'tends', 'ooze', 'celluloid', 'drop', 'hind', 'end', 'mouse', 'were.None', 'hasten', 'add', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'quite', 'bit', 'spite', 'just', 'that', 'as', 'good', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'given', 'director', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'touch', 'helm', 'however', 'visual', 'feast', 'manic', 'McDowell', 'tourguide', 'will', 'do', 'nicely', '***']",N/A

He is violent, sadistic, ruthless, and cunning.  He and his gang of youths steal, rape, destroy, and generally make war upon anyone they choose - be it rival gangs, people driving on the road, or people living quietly at home.In a master stroke, the movie reveals that this nightmarish individual is not the real evil here.  The real enemy of the people is the oppressive government.  This government wants its citizens to do as they're told, go to work, and live plain, uninteresting lives.  In other words, they want a society of ""clockwork oranges"".  The government will achieve its goal by starting with prisoners - as in the case of our friend Alex and will presumably move on from there to other citizens.What is amazing is we, the audience, find ourselves at this point of the movie pitying poor Alex.

I popped it in my DVD player and was as utterly spellbound by it as I was the first time in I saw it, nearly 30 years ago, but from a new and different point of view (of a middle-aged man).It is simply one of the greatest socio-scifi films ever made, rich in themes and unforgettable images, a language uniquely its own, with first-rate acting and innumerable layers.  There are deliciously unanswered questions in it, like the infiltration of Russian into working class British slang, that stimulate the imagination.  In my humble opinion, this marks it as a work of genius that will survive as a classic of our times, to be compared with the greatest literary accomplishments.  Kubrick is one of the all-time greats and this film is superior to the novel by Burgess.We witness Alex, a twisted and sadistic youth, on his private journey to hell.  While devilishly funny, it is also a frightening portrait of a decadent industrial society, in which politicians and the intelligensia are as brutal as the thugs they hire into the police.  Plus, you have Kubrick's fascination with music and altered states of consciousness, all of which form part of Alex's bizarre character and recondite violence.  The story is so unique!!

Then the camera starts slowly to move back and we see naked female statues and drink machines which purl out the milk through their breasts...McDowell is splendid as the star-child Alex... He is simply a vicious and amazing sadist monster, lethal in his sincerity, taking delight in rape and violence... Never such a vile character has been so charismatic and attractive...His life is perplexing, questionable and terrifying... He doesn't show the slightest regard for other's rights or morality... He doesn't even regard his victims as human beings...His paradoxical character is in nearly every scene... McDowell captures Alex's human and inhuman side with equal skill... Alex is a victim at the mercy of an uncaring society, condemned to the physically unbearable ""dislike therapy"" and preyed upon by his former targets...Set in England in the near future- a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems that society has started to crumble and at night the streets are driven with teenage gangs who run free of parental control...""A Clockwork Orange"" is too strong for some people to accept and is still too powerful today... It is an extremely disturbing meditation on the violent nature of man... Kubrick emphasizes the human element by paradoxically dehumanizing the characters...Viewers see images they may not have wanted to see, but will never be able to forget... He presents violence in a confusing and increasing fashion that makes it alarmingly attractive... He invites us to join Alex in raping and pillaging into London urban jungle to show that violence and power are invariably attractive... He makes good use of the camera, showing, in strange ways, the furious underworld of Alex...Kubrick is the driving force behind ""A Clockwork Orange."" The film is without exception his picture... He took the novel of Anthony Burgess re-shaping it to fit his own vision... Images and sound pull in different directions, stimulating conflicting emotions...In a bizarre juxtaposition of often classical music with violence, we see ourselves manipulated into cheering for Alex, despite his brutal and amoral nature... We are forced to really think about the implications of the events with no answer...The film serves as a battleground for philosophical arguments making comments without forcing an opinion instead preferring that we ourselves decide what to make of the satire... Exposing themes to think about, significant prediction, liberalism of society, sexual acts gaining acceptance, violent films in higher degree, alcohol-currently legal, accounts for many acts of violence, crime out of control, violence in schools, television, illustrating the inconstant nature of public opinion, raising questions, themes and ideas that many people would prefer not to confront...Style has always been one of Kubrick's strong points... He maintained a reputation for an obsessive attention to detail... He was known for getting the most out of his actors... Distinct images often play a significant part in his films...With its dynamic bizarre sets and pulsating classical music score, and with a word of warning on how bad violence is and should be watched very closely, Kubrick's motion picture is unsurpassed with intellectual content... It is a film described often as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously vicious- a film with more violent sex and dangerous thugs than any other I can remember, a film which daringly brought to larger-than-life those areas of the unconscious mind which some people felt were best left hidden...It is also highly dramatic, extremely graphic, compelling and provoking...

Perhaps in these cases it is the reviewer who should be given one star, not the movie. A Clockwork Orange is an allegory, this means that the characters and events are meant to portray something other than what they appear to be on the screen or in the novel.

I had absolutely no idea what I was in for. I was ignorant in every way possible having not even known it was based on a novella.To be honest I got to the part where Alex was in prison library reading the Bible where he's imaging himself flogging Christ as he's dragging the cross on his back. I remembered the loud music it employed and the image so vividly it scared the s**t out of me; I had to turn it off! I did finish it nevertheless, and when I watched it again over time I always either ""fast-forward"" through that part or just closed my eyes.As I got older, I became more and more familiar and interested in Stanley Kubrick's work and really admired the guy as a filmmaker even though many of this films aren't ""enjoyable"" per say. He does (or did), however, have an amazing eye for shots and really encompassed that around everything else.Last year, I decided to read Anthony Burgess' novella of the same title while in college. I really enjoyed it, and I decided that I'd watch the film again (having not seen in some time now). Surprisingly, the film version is truely an excellent adaptation of Burgess' novella (save for the newly added chapter at the end of the novella). Reading the book really made watching it all the better. I caught onto so many things I hadn't noticed initially in the film. I fould it extremely satirical and, well, enjoyable! I even got through the scene I had hang-ups about effortlessly. And after watching the film, I couldn't help but be really impressed.

Kubrick gives us a swirling pool of contradictions; it is both emotionally complex and passionate, yet cold and clinical. Kubrick's camera is an imperious eye, and it is fitting the film should open with a  close up of Alex's optic. It is an eye that never blinks, so obsessed is it with presenting the audience with audacious and challenging images, which decades on have a retained a brilliant luminosity.This is a dark dystopian fable in which the gossamer strands that keep society in place have collapsed. A world in which right and wrong have become ambiguous terms and in which the violent excess of Alex and his gang of misfit ""droogs"" takes on a biblical and spiritual grandeur. Kubrick presents an attack on art and culture, it is no longer part of a critical hierarchy, defended by academic elitism, but is dirtied and rubbished. Modern art becomes a murder weapon and the music of Beethoven is a masturbatory aid to fantasies of whole scale death and destruction. This is an assault not only on hypocritical social institutions; the police, religion, government, family and scientific rationale, but also on the appropriation of art, its promoters and consumers. That Kubrick captures this in a film that uses the artistic capacity of cinema to its greatest extent shows both his ambivalence toward cinema as a means of expression and artistic pretensions in general.",5,Troubling Masterpiece,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1905,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'adaptation', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'fable', 'dystopian', 'delinquency', 'cavalcade', 'colour', 'cartoon', 'caricature', 'multi-faceted', 'multi-layered', 'kaleidoscope', 'artistic', 'filmic', 'endeavour', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'exploration', 'violence', 'uncontrolled', 'sexuality', 'musical', 'overture', 'structured', 'series', 'emotional', 'peaks', 'troughs', 'climax', 'anti-climax', 'reflected', 'schizophrenic', 'soundtrack', 'classical', 'modern', 'electronic', 'synthetic', 'techniques', 'Kubrick', 'swirling', 'pool', 'contradictions', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'passionate', 'cold', 'clinical', 'Kubrick', 'camera', 'imperious', 'eye', 'fitting', 'film', 'should', 'open', 'close', 'Alex', 'optic', 'eye', 'never', 'so', 'obsessed', 'presenting', 'audience', 'audacious', 'challenging', 'images', 'have', 'retained', 'brilliant', 'luminosity.This', 'dark', 'dystopian', 'fable', 'gossamer', 'keep', 'society', 'place', 'have', 'collapsed', 'world', 'right', 'wrong', 'have', 'become', 'ambiguous', 'terms', 'violent', 'excess', 'Alex', 'gang', 'misfit', 'droogs', 'biblical', 'spiritual', 'grandeur', 'Kubrick', 'attack', 'art', 'culture', 'no', 'longer', 'part', 'critical', 'hierarchy', 'defended', 'academic', 'elitism', 'dirtied', 'rubbished', 'Modern', 'art', 'murder', 'weapon', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'masturbatory', 'aid', 'fantasies', 'whole', 'scale', 'death', 'destruction', 'assault', 'not', 'only', 'hypocritical', 'social', 'institutions', 'police', 'religion', 'government', 'family', 'scientific', 'rationale', 'also', 'appropriation', 'art', 'promoters', 'consumers', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'artistic', 'capacity', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'extent', 'ambivalence', 'cinema', 'means', 'expression', 'artistic', 'pretensions', 'general']",N/A

When one of these random crimes results in the death of their victim the droogs run off, leaving Alex to the mercy of a corrupt justice system.  He volunteers for a program designed to ""cure"" incorrigibles of their desire to commit mayhem, and he is subjected to a type of aversion therapy that ultimately leaves him completely defenseless.The language that Alex uses both as our humble narrator and as a participant is also a very vital part of the characters and story.

I was the same age as punk protagonist Alex (Malcolm McDowell in the performance he has never topped) and found something imaginative about the use of music constantly, the set design, the editing, and the circular and ironic film structure.  It somehow did not bother me that I was watching hoodlums beating up and sometimes accidentally killing innocent people after drinking hallucinogenic milk; I just loved the interior of the Korova Milkbar and the writer and his wife being raped to ""Singin' in the Rain"".  And with Gene Kelly's rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain"" over the colorful closing credits, I left the theater feeling elated after 137 minutes.  And it wasn't just me.  Reviews were mostly raves for Christmas Week 1971.  The movie won Best Picture and Director of the Year awards from the New York Film Critics.  And it got four Oscar nominations, including Picture and Director.  One of my film professors at UCLA even offered extra credit to anyone who saw CLOCKWORK in Hollywood and turned in a halfway-intelligent review; I got an A.But we all grow up.  The very same print of CLOCKWORK ORANGE-OK, a few frames of nudity were trimmed in two places to get a ludicrous ""R"" rating-that enthralled me as a college student of 21 now terrifies me as a middle-aged movie scholar of 54.  The copy of the movie I own on VHS tape has only been played three times in the last decade, including once before writing this essay.  The film's near future of 1986 is now the past.  It is admittedly fun to see the kitchen with four colors of wallpaper, Mom with a purple wig and red raincoat, the glass tables with metal bases, and a record shop that still sells videocassettes and LP records.  The high-speed sex scene with two girls and ""The William Tell Overture"" remains a delight for me.But Alex's crimes are horrendous to me now.  I do not enjoy them, even with the creative use of music to distance us.  When the State imprisons Alex and  puts him through the Ludovico mind-altering technique in the movie's middle section, I now root for the State to win, not Alex.  I have been a patient myself in my share of hospitals, including for two heart attacks.  The doctors and nurses seem sympathetic.  And the ironic twist finale troubles me now at age 54.  It leaves me with a queasy feeling, not euphoric.  Same piece of celluloid for 137 minutes, but three decades later in emotional growth.  And then there is Malcolm McDowell doing two different short-lived, but welcome TV series with white hair and smiles to reassure us that he is not Alex anymore.  It was only a role, albeit the role of his career.(CAUTION:  NON-STOP  PLOT SPOILERS!  BEWARE!}  For those who have never experienced CLOCKWORK ORANGE in a theater or on home video, let me brace you for what to expect.  Ghostly music plays on the soundtrack as we track back from Alex and his two pals (droogs) drinking milk laced with hallucinogenic drugs in a milkbar with reclining white nude women sculptures as far as the eye can see; customers gets a refill by pressing a button below each sculpture's purple private parts.  Then a gang rape follows the beating up of a tramp under a night bridge.  A glass house where a writer and his wife live is then invaded by the three hoodlums.  Alex kicks at the writer as he happily sings ""Singin' in the Rain"" and rapes the wife after knocking over bookshelves.  Then the gang goes home.  Alex lives in downtown slum apartments with obscene graffiti on broken elevators.  Climbing the stairs he places a pet snake named Basil on his bed and plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, his favorite, happily on audiocassette.  A visit from his probation officer in the morning is followed by a fight and accidental murder by Alex with a woman who has a lot of cats and a lot of hilariously obscene sculptures, such as a white penis and testicles; that is a murder weapon.  But Alex is arrested outside the house, tricked  by his two droogie friends.  And we are now 45 minutes into a 137 minute movie that falls into three neat parts.  I give out this much plot because of friends who have given up on the movie after 20 minutes of non-stop violence and sex scenes with pubic hair.  Walk out on this movie before it ends, and you will miss the whole troubling and ironic point of it.(MORE DETAILED PLOT SPOILERS:)  The second third of CLOCKWORK ORANGE mostly leaves behind sex and violence.  Arrested for the accidental murder of the catwoman, Alex is now a prisoner of the State.  Scenes throughout are hospital corridors and rooms with sympathetic staff for me.  This is not a traditional prison at all.  And Alex is very sympathetic as he reads the Bible (though he likes the sex and violence parts) and trying to be a model prisoner.  After a couple of years, he volunteers as a guinea pig for something new the State has up its sleeve-the Lodovico Technique, brainwashing to abhor all sex and violence.  We see a few of these sessions-Alex with his eyes propped open being forced to watch a brutal rape film (this got very slightly trimmed to get the ""R"" rating in America) and I think a scene from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1934).  But an Alex supposedly all cured of sex and violence does not really succeed before an auditorium gathering.  Will the program backfire?(STILL SOME MORE PLOT SPOILERS:)  We are now about 90 minutes into the movie, with roughly 45 minutes left to go.  This is where the movie gets mind-bogglingly and dazzlingly ironic.  The program has rough side-effects for Alex, who becomes an abused victim by some of his former tormentors.  Look what has happenedto Alex's two buddies and what they do to him.  The writer shows up again in a stunningly ironic scene with an even more imaginative and ironic payoff, leading us to a controversial final fifteen minutes or so.  I still think it is a happy ending, maybe because it has five minutes of closing credits with colored card name backgrounds and Gene Kelly doing ""Singin' in the Rain""on the soundtrack,Two things are for sure:  The fearless Malcolm McDowell should have won the Oscar he was not even nominated for, and CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a masterpiece of audacious and endlessly creative filmmaking by one of our greatest filmmakers.  This is Stanley Kubrick's greatest film for me in terms of writing and pure filmmaking and provocative ideas, even as it still terrifies me.  I try to watch it on VHS tape in a darkened night bedroom to evoke the grand single-screen Hollywood Pacific Theater in 1972 when I was only 21, but it is hard. We are all older now-and hopefully wiser.  If you think you are up to it, CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a staggering and overwhelming video rental evening-and sells on DVD for only $14.95.[...]",4,A chilling and disturbing midnight movie,1124841600,"08

No issues such as harsh grain, aliasing or any artifacts on the video transfer at all. Very well done.The audio transfer defaults to DD5.1 so going right away to the menu to change it to  lossless PCM 5.1 is necessary. The audio levels are all well balanced, but the front stage is used primarily for the soundtrack which provided a clear separation of instrumentations. However, there is no use of the rear channels for any discreet foley FX and almost nothing from the LFE channel. This film is still as powerful as when it was first release and will probably remain so for many decades to come.The Blu Ray version of A Clockwork Orange'  comes with plenty of supplementary extras and  a large variety of language choices. The extras, I found to be worthwhile and interesting..most dated at 2007.

As a Christian, it's just easy for me to find God in just about anything...even Kubrick films!

That being said, A Clockwork Orange improved on some of this classic Burgess novel and destroyed other aspects of it. Not to be too nitpicky of this fine movie, it truly is one of Kubrick's best.The story is very much about the anti-hero of Alex de Large, a hoodlum for lack of a better word. He and his roaming street gang of droogs rob, rape, and terrorize the people of London nightly with cane in hand and Beethoven in their ears.On one such night, Alex and his droogies attempt a robbery on a health clinic owner's house, with disastrous results. The lady is killed in the attack and Alex is left to take full blame. After a brief stint in prison, he is released to the custody of a doctor with a procedure to eliminate violence from Alex's brain. The torturous treatments leave him totally unequipped to deal with any sort of violent behavior, even in the face of his former droogs seeking revenge.As complex as the story is, it still doesn't go into the full depth of the underlying story of government control of free-will the book focused on. The movie plays more to the shock factor. Not saying this is a bad movie because of that, quite the opposite. Kubrick's use of color, shape, and music gives us such an engrossing film it's hard to take your eyes off of it even during the vilest of ""horrorshows"". This movie should not be placed side by side with the novel it's based on, in fact, I would even say forgo the book until you have seen the movie.Please note: the movie only goes as far as the 21st chapter of the Burgess novel. The 22nd chapter was released later in the newer printings of the book. This should be reason enough to watch the movie first, as the last chapter of the book is important to Burgess' true vision of the characters, but it does make the movie seem a little short of what it could have been, and kills all the speculation of events following the film, and that is an injustice to this remarkable film.This is one of my top 5 movies of all time, but with movies of this shocking nature, you either love it or hate it.",5,"Watch the movie first, then read the book.",1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2134,"['book', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'touched', 'own', 'being', 'said', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'improved', 'classic', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'destroyed', 'other', 'aspects', 'Not', 'be', 'too', 'nitpicky', 'fine', 'movie', 'truly', 'one', 'Kubrick', 'best.The', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'anti-hero', 'Alex', 'de', 'Large', 'hoodlum', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'roaming', 'street', 'gang', 'droogs', 'rob', 'rape', 'terrorize', 'people', 'London', 'nightly', 'cane', 'hand', 'Beethoven', 'ears.On', 'one', 'such', 'night', 'Alex', 'droogies', 'attempt', 'robbery', 'health', 'clinic', 'owner', 'house', 'disastrous', 'results', 'lady', 'killed', 'attack', 'Alex', 'left', 'take', 'full', 'blame', 'brief', 'stint', 'prison', 'released', 'custody', 'doctor', 'procedure', 'eliminate', 'violence', 'Alex', 'brain', 'torturous', 'treatments', 'leave', 'totally', 'unequipped', 'deal', 'sort', 'violent', 'behavior', 'even', 'face', 'former', 'droogs', 'seeking', 'revenge.As', 'complex', 'story', 'still', ""n't"", 'go', 'full', 'depth', 'underlying', 'story', 'government', 'control', 'free-will', 'book', 'focused', 'movie', 'more', 'shock', 'factor', 'Not', 'saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'quite', 'opposite', 'Kubrick', 'use', 'color', 'shape', 'music', 'engrossing', 'film', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'even', 'vilest', 'horrorshows', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'placed', 'side', 'side', 'novel', 'based', 'fact', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'forgo', 'book', 'have', 'seen', 'movie.Please', 'note', 'movie', 'only', 'as', 'far', '21st', 'chapter', 'Burgess', 'novel', '22nd', 'chapter', 'was', 'released', 'later', 'newer', 'printings', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'last', 'chapter', 'book', 'important', 'Burgess', 'true', 'vision', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'little', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'speculation', 'events', 'following', 'film', 'injustice', 'remarkable', 'film.This', 'one', 'top', '5', 'movies', 'time', 'movies', 'shocking', 'nature', 'either', 'love', 'hate']",N/A

85844,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,0790701022,The Cool Guy,"[22, 93]","4-1/2 Stars on Amazon! What are you people smoking??? It must be pot because this movie is definitely a child of the 60's. Tacky psychedelic colors, gaudy sexual artwork, weird music, free love, and a couch shaped like an egg. Yep. We're in the 60's alright.Sorry folks, but this movie is a real STINKER. It is HORRIBLE! I am sure that all you fanboys out there (I'm sure there won't be any girls) will say that I just didn't ""get it."" Pray tell, what is there to ""get""? A guy is extremely violent (so we are told), the government changes him to not be violent but in doing so takes away his free will, and then that same government later ""cures"" him of his lack of free will by making him violent again. And along the way we are treated to a few extremely tame rape scenes, some quite boring and untintillating sex scenes, some horrible artwork, a bunch of weird people including a guy who grabs our protagonist's crotch, some cheesy dialogue that no actual person would ever utter, and a few acts of ""ultraviolence"" that were pretty darn weak. Oh, and I nearly forgot... Some accompanying classical music. Did I miss anything?At least I did get to see some boobs. As a guy I can appreciate such a thing. But that doesn't redeem this movie, or make it worth watching by any means.I am not a fanboy who grew up watching this. I was born a decade after this movie came out. I decided to watch this movie because I had saw that it was one of the most critically-acclaimed and best sci-fi movies of all time. WTF? This movie STINKS!!!The things that I enjoyed most about this movie were not intended by the creator. I enjoyed looking at all the pschedelic 60's crap in the movie. It's always fun to look at all the funky things that people back then envisioned for the future. A couch shaped like a big plastic egg? Sure. Weird porno art on everybody's walls? No problem. A bar with statues of naked women serving as tables? Sounds good to me. Something better than a giant record player as a sound system? Sorry. That's just too difficult to envision.The acting in this movie was really strange. People said and did things that made absolutely no sense whatsoever, for inexplicable reasons. Their facial expressions also did all kinds of weird things that were nothing that any actual human being could ever relate to. It was slightly comedic at times, which almost made the movie worth watching. ALMOST.I liked watching Malcom McDowell's acting. He was very energetic and interesting. The movie would have suffered even more than it already does without him. I didn't recognize him as Dr. Soren from Star Trek: Generations, but he plays a great crazy person in both movies. I did find it quite revolting to watch him eat at the end of the movie, however. Hey Orange boy, stop smacking will ya?But the bottom line is that this movie is the most highly OVERRATED crap I've seen in a long, long time. This movie has got about as much hype, if not more, than that stinker ""Titanic"" did. I honestly do not know why ""A Clockwork Orange"" gets such rave reviews. Maybe you people are just into weirdness. Well if that's the case, then this is definitely your movie.Weird people, weird talking, weird faces, weird places, weird actions, weird backgrounds, weird music, weird sex, weird story, and a weird name that is essentially meaningless until you hear the ""Mechanical Orangutan"" story (given outside of the movie) that is supposed to explain it.Yeah, sounds like cinematic genius to me.Some people might say, ""Well you either love it or hate it."" But it's not that I hate this movie. I just don't understand why so many people seem to like it so much. It has little redeeming value in my opinion, and certainly has nothing in it that I ever care to see again. The sex was lame. The ""ultraviolence"" was tame. The story was dull. Overall, it is a truly uninspiring bit of awfulness.Speaking of the ""ultraviolence"", what exactly, are we talking about here? Here is all the violence you get in this movie:1. 4 Guys beat up a tramp.2. 4 Guys try to rape a woman who gets away.3. 4 Guys beat up 4 other guys.4. 1 Guy knocks another guy in a 2-foot deep stream and then cuts another guy on the hand. (Oooh. Scary!)5. 4 Guys break into one house, tie up the husband to watch, and then apparently (it doesn't show it) rape the wife.6. 1 Guy hits some lady on the head with a statue and kills her.7. 3 Guys beat up the 1 guy.8. Some lady gets raped by a group of guys, or so we are told.9. 4 Guys dunk another guy in a water trough (he survives).That's it. ULTRAVIOLENCE? Give me a flippin' break! I've seen worse in a Saturday morning cartoon. Sure, the rape scenes SOUND pretty bad as I describe them. But they are actually extremely tame and quite weak. A few clothes are ripped, we get the idea that the woman is struggling, and then it is on to the next scene. I would think that a rape scene should be very scary to watch. These were not scary at all, most of the time with whimsy music playing in the background or our protagonist singing ""Singing in the Rain"". It just made it all seem very unrealistic, undramatic, and fake. Not to mention stupid.A Clockwork Orange. This is (maybe) the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I wish this was not even called Science Fiction, because it besmirches the name of Good Sci-Fi. It is not worthy of the title. CO is nothing more than an overrated piece of garbage. The only reason it has won so many awards and been so critically acclaimed is that it is supposed to be ""art"", and somehow if a bad movie qualifies as ""art"", then it is above reproach.

A week or two after finishing the book, I was eager to see the movie made by one of my favorite directors, Stanley Kubrick. I had pretty high expectations, having loved the book and having loved every other Kubrick film I've seen. Well my expectations were fulfilled.A Clockwork Orange is the Story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a young teen with a taste for some of the old ultraviolence, and his cronies, Dim, Georgie, and Pete. While out making trouble one night, Alex is arrested, while the rest of the crew escape.While in prison, Alex is used as a guinea pig for a new method of treatment, which is ultimately supposed to stop someone from comitting violent acts by a sort of sensory overload thing with video and music and stuff. It's sort of hard to explain. Well, he's finally released and, well, lets just say his past catches up with him. What goes around comes around, sort of.This classic, controversial film is one of my favorite movies and, as long as your open-minded enough, I think it could become one of your favorites, too.

Viewers may point to ""2001"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"" as his best film, but for me, ""A Clockwork Orange"" was the movie that had Kubrick at the very top of his game as a filmmaker.  It's visually stunning, profoundly disturbing, exceedingly violent, and, in a warped way, downright hilarious.  Malcolm McDowell is Alex DeLarge, a troubled youth who spends his day blowing off school and his evenings with his ""droogs,"" committing the most despicable of crimes.  Following a botched attempt to burglarize and rape a woman, Alex is arrested, tried, and jailed before he is used as a guinea pig for an experimental rehabilitation program that supposedly ""cures"" criminals.  He goes through the treatment, is released from prison, and the world that once embraced him gives him a very cold shoulder.  But did this treatment really ""cure"" Alex?  I won't reveal more, but I will say that this movie is completely unmissable.  I have been reading reviews from others who complain about the film's nonstop violence.  I think Kubrick pumped up the violence deliberately to properly articulate the horror of Alex's actions.  If that bothers you, then rent ""Harry Potter.""

Stanley Kubrick had heard rumours that the federal government was planning to take violence in it's own hands rather than keeping it operating at a public level , to the point that he decided to make a movie about it and base it on the famous classic novel Clockwork Orange. The result becomes a very sinister prediction of what society would be like under the influence of inactivists - those who believe that human nature can be broken down and that people are not to act against it by any means whatsoever. Because there is no concept of New Age thought throughout the whole book or the whole movie , we often get to hear names like 'Droogs', which is the title of those who rebelled against nature being dishonoured in the film. Led by a fanatical fan of Beethoven's 9th symphony , the Droogs tried to make right wrong by creating as much violence as possible - with almost no chaos , which turns out to be a bitter disappointment for them. Even so they continue until the leader of the Droogs decides to explain his reasons for doing what he did. He is then put off the rehab plan as the federal government decides to put him into a position of authority to judge anything he so desires on the concept of violence. The film also puts the practice of the superstition known once as 'clinical psychiatry'into an existential angst type of perspective which makes total idiots out of the psychiatrists who thought they were helping the main character of the movie. Understandeably , Kubrick got visited by a political figure who warned him of the consequences of attempting to make another movie like A Clockwork Orange again which would attempt to present violence on the screen for what it really is. Not listening , Kubrick made The Shining. When it was the third time , with Eyes Wide Shut , he was appearently killed or to put it in the words of the political figure in Clockwork Orange 'put away'. When the predicted New Age movement finally arrived , it was used as a front to keep people in line with the wishes of imaginary friends at the expense of common sense. The politically incorrect , bad for big government and big bussiness explanation for violence as portrayed in this film , is that it is ineviteable. It is part of every intelligent being's existence no matter where. Thank goodness the New Age movement is now collapsing or at the very least being withdrawn - I was part of it for some time and when I saw it for the crap it was , I thanked goodness that I had not gone further.

Furthermore, what is the real purpose of prison?These deep societal questions barely scratch the philosophical surface of A Clockwork Orange.The questions that arise depends greatly on the viewer.A Clockwork Orange was introduced in 1971. It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.  The screenplay was based on the Anthony Burgess's 1962 book A Clockwork Orange.  To sum it up neatly this movie is excellent. It came out in 1971 and is still relevant and thought provoking. It is the quintessential cult movie. It is science fiction, horror, philosophy, violence and punk rock all rolled up into one.  The film asks many important questions about life and society.  The story revolves around a violent young man named Alex. He goes on a violent crime spree and ends up getting caught. After serving two years in prison he is offered an opportunity for early release.  The early release comes equipped with a pseudo lobotomy called the Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals. Alex participates in the experiment and is left unable to commit violent acts. In other words, he is stripped of his ability to be his criminal self. He is released from prison and the outcome is explored.  Stanley Kubrick was an maverick film creator. A Clockwork Orange could be his best creation. The music, images, scenarios, and concepts are all memorable. If it has been a while, A Clockwork Orange is worth a revisit. The themes presented are human, challenging, and violent. It is a powerful trip that asks questions that will continue to resonate through time.",5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #123,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,1637,"['Can', 'humans', 'be', 'truly', 'rehabilitated', 'Furthermore', 'what', 'real', 'purpose', 'prison', 'deep', 'societal', 'questions', 'barely', 'scratch', 'philosophical', 'surface', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange.The', 'questions', 'arise', 'greatly', 'viewer.A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'was', 'introduced', '1971', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', '1962', 'book', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'sum', 'up', 'neatly', 'movie', 'excellent', 'came', 'out', '1971', 'still', 'relevant', 'thought', 'provoking', 'quintessential', 'cult', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'philosophy', 'violence', 'punk', 'rock', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'important', 'questions', 'life', 'society', 'story', 'around', 'violent', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Alex', 'violent', 'crime', 'spree', 'up', 'getting', 'caught', 'serving', 'two', 'years', 'prison', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'early', 'release', 'early', 'release', 'equipped', 'pseudo', 'lobotomy', 'called', 'Ludovico', 'technique', 'experimental', 'aversion', 'therapy', 'rehabilitating', 'criminals', 'Alex', 'experiment', 'left', 'unable', 'commit', 'violent', 'acts', 'other', 'words', 'stripped', 'ability', 'be', 'criminal', 'self', 'released', 'prison', 'outcome', 'explored', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'maverick', 'film', 'creator', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'creation', 'music', 'images', 'scenarios', 'concepts', 'are', 'memorable', 'been', 'while', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'revisit', 'themes', 'presented', 'are', 'human', 'challenging', 'violent', 'powerful', 'trip', 'questions', 'will', 'continue', 'resonate', 'time']",N/A
85849,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,0790701022,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[8, 9]","One of the most shocking, revolting, outrageous and yet wildly imaginative films ever made, Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange brings to life Anthony Burgess' fevered novel accurately and in such a visually arresting manner that this 1971 classic was nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award, despite its abrasive subject matter and controversial ""X"" rating upon its initial release.It is a nearly indefinable futuristic Britain, where local gangs rule the streets while drinking down vellocet (milk spiked with drugs) and seeking out violent entertainment. Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of his gang of ""droogs"" who wile away the days beating up bums, fighting with other gangs, and breaking into houses to steal and rape, an extracurricular activity known as ""ultraviolence."" When Alex's droogs betray him, he is captured by the police and given the option to undergo a series of tests and a psychological corrective experiment (dubbed the Ludovico Treatment) to try and cure his wicked ways. But what the brainwashing does is effectively prevent him from making choices and using free will. His newly feeble condition leaves them at the mercy of those he wronged during his terrorizing days of ultraviolence.A jarring amount of nudity, violence, and disturbing situations make A Clockwork Orange a difficult yet highly rewarding film to watch. Gratuitous but arguably necessary to paint a vibrant scene of futuristic and satirically current hysteria, the violence and sexual assault is provided in a contrasting context to the tortures Alex must suffer for his misdeeds. Alex chooses violence as a rebellious act against conformism and values its evil above inertia. Almost operatic in nature, a musical accompaniment of blaring Beethoven augments nearly every scene, creating a lighthearted Elizabethan tone to intensify the vulgarity on display. The soundtrack is phenomenal and perfectly matched to each scene to evoke various emotions, and frenetic, time-altered editing oftentimes accompanies these wondrous scenes.The film is filled with breathtaking and uniquely memorable moments including Alex confined to a chair with metal prongs prying his eyes open, a dolly shot toward the group of droogs sipping spiked milk, and the slow-motion scene in which Alex kicks Georgie into a canal and gracefully replaces Dim's outstretched hand with a glistening knife.The most impressive aspect of the film is one of the same critically acclaimed aspects used in Anthony Burgess' chilling novel, and that is the invented language ""Nadsat"" used throughout by all of the droogs. A creative blend of Russian, English, slang and completely made-up verbiage, Alex narrates using this language, and despite the numerous unfamiliar and foreign phrases, audiences still universally understand it. A brilliant mix of double-edged words and humorous adjectives (e.g. ""the old in and out"" equals ""sex"") his speech is more complex in the novel, but perfectly honed and never overused in the film.The designs of Alex and his group were a huge success and have immortalized the bowler hat. Bloody eyeballs adorned the sleeves of their crisp white clothing, and their thick lower false eyelashes are a strikingly bizarre look. The entire artistic design of the film is so outlandish that words don't do it justice.Kubrick's brilliant interpretation of the novel houses multitudes of subliminal messages and commentary on society in a glaringly visual way that couldn't have been achieved by anyone else.A Clockwork Orange is an incredible journey into the fiery genius of Stanley Kubrick and perhaps the best film of his career. Visually stunning and an intense morality play involving the freedom of choice and the state's influence on civilian lives, the film may be science fiction on the outside, but it is pure classic on the inside.- Mike Massie",5,A Clockwork Orange Movie Review,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,3856,"['One', 'most', 'shocking', 'revolting', 'outrageous', 'yet', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'life', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'fevered', 'novel', 'accurately', 'such', 'visually', 'arresting', 'manner', '1971', 'classic', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', 'abrasive', 'subject', 'matter', 'controversial', 'X', 'rating', 'initial', 'release.It', 'nearly', 'indefinable', 'futuristic', 'Britain', 'where', 'local', 'gangs', 'rule', 'streets', 'drinking', 'down', 'vellocet', 'milk', 'spiked', 'drugs', 'seeking', 'out', 'violent', 'entertainment', 'Alex', 'de', 'Large', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'leader', 'gang', 'droogs', 'who', 'wile', 'away', 'days', 'beating', 'up', 'bums', 'fighting', 'other', 'gangs', 'breaking', 'houses', 'steal', 'rape', 'extracurricular', 'activity', 'known', 'ultraviolence', 'When', 'Alex', 'droogs', 'betray', 'captured', 'police', 'given', 'option', 'undergo', 'series', 'tests', 'psychological', 'corrective', 'experiment', 'dubbed', 'Ludovico', 'Treatment', 'try', 'cure', 'wicked', 'ways', 'what', 'brainwashing', 'effectively', 'prevent', 'making', 'choices', 'using', 'free', 'will', 'newly', 'feeble', 'condition', 'mercy', 'wronged', 'terrorizing', 'days', 'ultraviolence.A', 'jarring', 'amount', 'nudity', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'situations', 'make', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'difficult', 'yet', 'highly', 'rewarding', 'film', 'watch', 'Gratuitous', 'arguably', 'necessary', 'paint', 'vibrant', 'scene', 'futuristic', 'satirically', 'current', 'hysteria', 'violence', 'sexual', 'assault', 'provided', 'contrasting', 'context', 'tortures', 'Alex', 'must', 'suffer', 'misdeeds', 'Alex', 'violence', 'rebellious', 'act', 'conformism', 'evil', 'inertia', 'Almost', 'operatic', 'nature', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'blaring', 'Beethoven', 'augments', 'nearly', 'scene', 'creating', 'lighthearted', 'Elizabethan', 'tone', 'intensify', 'vulgarity', 'display', 'soundtrack', 'phenomenal', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'scene', 'evoke', 'various', 'emotions', 'frenetic', 'time-altered', 'editing', 'oftentimes', 'accompanies', 'wondrous', 'scenes.The', 'film', 'filled', 'breathtaking', 'uniquely', 'memorable', 'moments', 'including', 'Alex', 'confined', 'chair', 'metal', 'prongs', 'prying', 'eyes', 'open', 'dolly', 'shot', 'group', 'droogs', 'sipping', 'spiked', 'milk', 'slow-motion', 'scene', 'Alex', 'Georgie', 'canal', 'gracefully', 'Dim', 'outstretched', 'hand', 'glistening', 'knife.The', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'same', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'aspects', 'used', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'chilling', 'novel', 'invented', 'language', 'Nadsat', 'used', 'droogs', 'creative', 'blend', 'Russian', 'English', 'slang', 'completely', 'made-up', 'verbiage', 'Alex', 'using', 'language', 'numerous', 'unfamiliar', 'foreign', 'phrases', 'audiences', 'still', 'universally', 'understand', 'brilliant', 'mix', 'double-edged', 'words', 'humorous', 'adjectives', 'e.g', 'old', 'equals', 'sex', 'speech', 'more', 'complex', 'novel', 'perfectly', 'honed', 'never', 'overused', 'film.The', 'designs', 'Alex', 'group', 'were', 'huge', 'success', 'have', 'immortalized', 'bowler', 'hat', 'Bloody', 'adorned', 'sleeves', 'crisp', 'white', 'clothing', 'thick', 'lower', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'are', 'strikingly', 'bizarre', 'look', 'entire', 'artistic', 'design', 'film', 'so', 'outlandish', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice.Kubrick', 'brilliant', 'interpretation', 'novel', 'houses', 'multitudes', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'commentary', 'society', 'glaringly', 'visual', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'anyone', 'else.A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'incredible', 'journey', 'fiery', 'genius', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'career', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'intense', 'morality', 'play', 'involving', 'freedom', 'choice', 'state', 'influence', 'civilian', 'lives', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'science', 'fiction', 'outside', 'pure', 'classic', 'inside.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
85850,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,0790701022,The Night Falcon,"[0, 0]","I remember reading the script for one of my college classes shortly after this film first came out. It wasn't until I saw the film that I started to understand the language used in the script. A good way to sum up the moral of this film is ""what goes around comes around"" or more correctly, ""what you sow, you reep"".The main character Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell, is more or less a gang leader, by today's terminology; where he and his ""buddies"" go out at night raiding people's homes, kicking around drunks in the street and causing other mayhem with little regard for others to live their life the way they see fit.Finally Alex goes too far one night and kills a woman in her home, is caught by the authorities and goes to prison. He then finds a way to get out of prison, early, by taking on a rehabilitation program that alters the mind of the criminal so the criminal gets sick if they even think of doing wrong again. With the program, Alex even gains a distain for his favorite artist Ludwig Von Beethoven, especially his 9th symphony.Two of his cronies become police officers, while he is in prison, and after Alex is released, beat him within a inch of his life after he treated them badly one night when they were a gang; until finally in the end, Alex tries to take his own life, unable to no longer be himself without getting sick. There is allot of violence in this film, but you learn Alex has a moral base in spite of his violent tendencies.In the end, one has to ask who is the more corrupt, Alex or the system, once you see how the film ends. This film is not for the whole family and should be viewed by ages 17 on up in my book. Regardless of its violent content, it will give you pause to think of society and its ills in a whole new light.",5,"By an alternate title would read; ""What goes around comes around""",1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1765,"['remember', 'reading', 'script', 'one', 'college', 'classes', 'shortly', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'film', 'started', 'understand', 'language', 'used', 'script', 'good', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'moral', 'film', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'more', 'correctly', 'what', 'sow', 'reep', '.The', 'main', 'character', 'Alex', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'more', 'less', 'gang', 'leader', 'today', 'terminology', 'where', 'buddies', 'go', 'out', 'night', 'raiding', 'people', 'homes', 'kicking', 'around', 'drunks', 'street', 'causing', 'other', 'mayhem', 'little', 'regard', 'others', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'see', 'fit.Finally', 'Alex', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'night', 'woman', 'home', 'caught', 'authorities', 'prison', 'then', 'way', 'get', 'prison', 'early', 'taking', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'mind', 'criminal', 'criminal', 'sick', 'even', 'think', 'doing', 'wrong', 'again', 'program', 'Alex', 'even', 'gains', 'distain', 'favorite', 'artist', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Beethoven', 'especially', '9th', 'symphony.Two', 'cronies', 'become', 'police', 'officers', 'prison', 'Alex', 'released', 'beat', 'inch', 'life', 'treated', 'badly', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'were', 'gang', 'finally', 'end', 'Alex', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'unable', 'longer', 'be', 'getting', 'sick', 'allot', 'violence', 'film', 'learn', 'Alex', 'moral', 'base', 'spite', 'violent', 'end', 'one', 'ask', 'who', 'more', 'corrupt', 'Alex', 'system', 'once', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'ages', '17', 'book', 'Regardless', 'violent', 'content', 'will', 'give', 'pause', 'think', 'society', 'ills', 'whole', 'new', 'light']",N/A
85851,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0790701022,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 4]","Director:  Stanley KubrickCast:  Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, John Clive, Adrienne Corri, Carl Duering, Paul Farrell, Clive Francis.Running Time:  136 minutesRated R for violence, nudity, rape, and language.Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb"" violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song ""We'll Meet Again"" lovingly played in the background. In ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.  Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a cheerful young man who enjoys rape, violence, classical music, and just about everything sadistic. With his three droogs, Alex spends the nights terrorizing anyone who he might encounter. One night, after killing a woman with numerous cats, Alex's gang turns on him and leaves him at the hands of the law. Alex next finds himself in prison with the sentence of 14 years for his murder that night. While in prison, he hears about a free ticket out of his sentence. All he has to do is be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment is supposed to make Alex ""better"" and revert him from being bad to good. Alex says yes, jumping at the opportunity to get free faster. After being brainwashed by the scientists, Alex returns to civilization as a free and good man. However, the experiment has some side-effects that were not intended, and Alex is left helpless as his past victims come to gain revenge on him.With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food. As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat inedible. More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color. This as opposed to taste makes for quality food. Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry. ""A Clockwork Orange"" was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two. What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen. He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women. You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies. His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion. There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude. The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies. The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight. The incredible accent makes it all the better.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future. The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement. In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.",4,A Clockwork Orange  (1971),1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,4448,"['Director', 'Stanley', 'KubrickCast', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'John', 'Clive', 'Adrienne', 'Corri', 'Carl', 'Duering', 'Paul', 'Farrell', 'Clive', 'Francis.Running', 'Time', '136', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'nudity', 'rape', 'language.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'way', 'telling', 'stories', 'violence', 'actually', 'exploiting', 'going', 'exaggeration', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'How', 'Stopped', 'Worrying', 'Learned', 'Love', 'Bomb', 'violence', 'war', 'was', 'discussed', 'overheard', 'never', 'truly', 'seen', 'final', 'reel', 'when', 'flurry', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'exploded', 'bright', 'mushrooms', 'song', ""'ll"", 'Meet', 'Again', 'lovingly', 'played', 'background', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Hal-9000', 'entire', 'crew', 'most', 'chilling', 'way', 'see', 'computer', 'screen', 'indicating', 'termination', 'life', 'Now', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Kubrick', 'actually', 'story', 'violence', 'even', 'then', 'art', 'directed', 'inch', 'life', 'Alex', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'cheerful', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'rape', 'violence', 'classical', 'music', 'just', 'everything', 'sadistic', 'three', 'droogs', 'Alex', 'nights', 'terrorizing', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'encounter', 'One', 'night', 'killing', 'woman', 'numerous', 'cats', 'Alex', 'gang', 'hands', 'law', 'Alex', 'next', 'prison', 'sentence', '14', 'years', 'murder', 'night', 'prison', 'free', 'ticket', 'sentence', 'do', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'experiment', 'supposed', 'make', 'Alex', 'better', 'revert', 'being', 'bad', 'good', 'Alex', 'yes', 'jumping', 'opportunity', 'get', 'free', 'faster', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'scientists', 'Alex', 'civilization', 'free', 'good', 'man', 'However', 'experiment', 'side-effects', 'were', 'not', 'intended', 'Alex', 'left', 'helpless', 'past', 'victims', 'come', 'gain', 'revenge', 'him.With', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'feeling', 'eating', 'Turkish', 'food', 'principle', 'Turkish', 'food', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'taste', 'somewhat', 'inedible', 'More', 'importantly', 'idea', 'presentation', 'experience', 'elegance', 'amazing', 'contrast', 'color', 'opposed', 'taste', 'quality', 'food', 'Similarly', 'Kubrick', 'often', 'shied', 'away', 'telling', 'fundamentally', 'coherent', 'plot', 'concerned', 'details', 'visual', 'artistry', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'was', 'best', 'effort', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'able', 'finally', 'incorporate', 'fantastic', 'story', 'elegant', 'presentation', 'color', 'task', 'surely', 'kept', 'night', 'tossed', 'turned', 'searching', 'perfect', 'balance', 'two', 'What', 'truly', 'adaptation', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'success', 'what', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'screen', 'Alex', 'De', 'Large', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'kind', 'adore', 'urgent', 'needs', 'little', 'old', 'ultra', 'violence', 'night', 'unexpectedly', 'house', 'neighborhood', 'pounces', 'innocent', 'women', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'appreciate', 'interaction', 'good', 'old', 'mom', 'dad', 'tiny', 'snicker', 'forms', 'when', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'attend', 'school', 'sad', 'sweet', 'look', 'confusion', 'sadness', 'innocently', 'parents', 'introduce', 'replacement', 'son', 'homeless', 'need', 'droogies', 'interactions', 'droogies', 'are', 'delight', 'singing', 'rain', 'mad', 'villain', 'beating', 'up', 'little', 'groupies', 'slow-motion', 'sense', 'sadness', 'ironically', 'being', 'Beethoven', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'botched', 'suicide', 'broken', 'limbs', 'abounding', 'same', 'clever', 'smile', 'good', 'attitude', 'finale', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'ever', 'cinema', 'sweet', 'Alex', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'little', 'old', 'in-out', 'nurses', 'attempt', 'curtail', 'ultra', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'slow', 'smile', 'innocently', 'despicable', 'face', 'sheer', 'delight', 'incredible', 'accent', 'better', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', '1971', 'Kordova', 'Milk', 'Bar', 'was', 'trendy', 'little', 'place', 'can', 'only', 'picture', 'existing', 'future', 'fascinating', 'way', 'crime', 'was', 'dealt', 'could', 'be', 'wave', 'future', 'should', 'capital', 'punishment', 'issue', 'cause', 'too', 'much', 'disagreement', 'short', 'little', 'old', 'ultra', 'violence', 'what', 'propelled', 'film', 'high', 'rankings', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'allow', 'allow', 'children', 'see', 'once', '18', 'course']",N/A

A woman in a bright red jumper answers the  doorbell cautiously.ALEX Excuse me, Mrs... will you please help, there's  been a terrible accident.She opens the door on the chain and peeps  out.ALEX My friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.  Could I please use your telephone for an ambulance?  Her husband,  overhearing the desperation in his voice insists that she let him in.The  door swings open and the droogs don their phallic masks. They pulverize the  writer, scissor the woman's jumper off, drop their drawers and proceed to  gang bang her in full view of her husband, all to Alex's upbeat rendition  of Singin' in the Rain.Stanley Kubrick's striking imagery of Alex and  his droogs night of ultra violence is one of the most disturbing sequences  ever filmed. Its brilliance, however, is not in the horror of the images  we're shown, but in the point-of-view. Through Alex's eyes, these  despicable acts are perceived simply a night out with the boys.Based on  Anthony Burgess's novel, A CLOCKWORK ORGANGE imagines a future where gangs  have run amok and liberals and conservatives alike leverage the fear of  these uncivilized punks to their political advantage.Malcolm McDowell's  enigmatic hooligan remains one of the most unforgiving performances in  cinema. He has his head held underwater in an uncut shot running over a  minute while his body is bludgeoned with (fake?) billy clubs. A  disappointed social worker (Name) spits in his face while informing him  that his latest victim has died and he's to be charged with murder.  McDowell's uncertain half grin, the cold stare of his mascaraed eye, the  gleeful chomping of food as he's being spoon fed by a high government  official, all performed with such cocksure bravado make his a standout  performance in a must-see film.I first encountered A Clockwork Orange as  a late night show during my college days. Though I still have quibbles  about the film's second act, where Alex serendipitously stumbles upon all  those he has wronged, I was attracted to subsequent viewings by its  prurient appeal.Beyond the shock value, I've come to appreciate the  film's rich and twisted sense of humor, much of which is played out in the  film's score. Walter (now Wendy) Carlos of Switched-On Bach fame, creates  synthesized Henry Purcell to represent the warped future of jolly old  England. Alex masturbates to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony Scherzo while  fantasizing about gloriously violent images and the Ode to Joy is employed  as background music to Alex's violence aversion therapy.As a satirist,  Stanley Kubrick was at the top of his form. Lolita, Dr. Strangelove and A  Clockwork Orange were all drop-dead funny takes on deadly serious  issues.One of the funniest things about A Clockwork Orange isn't in the  film. The British version of Anthony Burgess's novel contained a final  chapter that had been truncated (inadvertently?) from the American version.  Burgess's denouement shows Alex growing up and leaving his rebellious ways  behind. Stanley Kubrick was an American who lived in England but happened  to pick up a copy of the British writer's novel while in the United States.  But for this unusual circumstance, A Clockwork Orange might have been about  coming of age instead of coming of psychosis.",5,Being the adventures of a young man...,961804800,"06 24, 2000",2000,3524,"['Being', 'adventures', 'young', 'man', 'principle', 'interests', 'are', 'rape', 'ultra-violence', 'BeethovenA', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Reviewed', 'Bruce', 'Cantwell', 'a-movie-to-see.comAlex', 'droogs', 'arrive', 'isolated', 'hillside', 'home', 'woman', 'bright', 'red', 'jumper', 'doorbell', 'cautiously.ALEX', 'Excuse', 'Mrs', 'will', 'please', 'help', 'been', 'terrible', 'accident.She', 'door', 'chain', 'peeps', 'out.ALEX', 'My', 'friend', 'lying', 'middle', 'road', 'bleeding', 'death', 'Could', 'please', 'use', 'telephone', 'ambulance', 'husband', 'overhearing', 'desperation', 'voice', 'insists', 'let', 'in.The', 'door', 'swings', 'open', 'droogs', 'don', 'phallic', 'masks', 'pulverize', 'writer', 'scissor', 'woman', 'jumper', 'drop', 'drawers', 'proceed', 'gang', 'bang', 'full', 'view', 'husband', 'Alex', 'upbeat', 'rendition', 'Singin', 'Rain.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'striking', 'imagery', 'Alex', 'droogs', 'night', 'ultra', 'violence', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed', 'brilliance', 'however', 'not', 'horror', 'images', ""'re"", 'shown', 'point-of-view', 'Alex', 'eyes', 'despicable', 'acts', 'are', 'perceived', 'simply', 'night', 'out', 'boys.Based', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORGANGE', 'future', 'where', 'gangs', 'have', 'run', 'amok', 'liberals', 'conservatives', 'alike', 'leverage', 'fear', 'uncivilized', 'punks', 'political', 'advantage.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'enigmatic', 'hooligan', 'one', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'performances', 'cinema', 'head', 'held', 'underwater', 'uncut', 'shot', 'running', 'over', 'minute', 'body', 'bludgeoned', 'fake', 'billy', 'clubs', 'disappointed', 'social', 'worker', 'Name', 'face', 'informing', 'latest', 'victim', 'died', 'be', 'charged', 'murder', 'McDowell', 'uncertain', 'half', 'grin', 'cold', 'stare', 'mascaraed', 'eye', 'gleeful', 'chomping', 'food', 'being', 'spoon', 'fed', 'high', 'government', 'official', 'performed', 'such', 'cocksure', 'bravado', 'make', 'standout', 'performance', 'must-see', 'film.I', 'first', 'encountered', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'late', 'night', 'show', 'college', 'days', 'still', 'have', 'quibbles', 'film', 'second', 'act', 'where', 'Alex', 'serendipitously', 'wronged', 'was', 'attracted', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'prurient', 'shock', 'value', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'film', 'rich', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'much', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'score', 'Walter', 'now', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'Switched-On', 'Bach', 'fame', 'synthesized', 'Henry', 'Purcell', 'represent', 'warped', 'future', 'jolly', 'old', 'England', 'Alex', 'Beethoven', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'Scherzo', 'fantasizing', 'about', 'gloriously', 'violent', 'images', 'Ode', 'Joy', 'employed', 'background', 'music', 'Alex', 'violence', 'aversion', 'satirist', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'Lolita', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'were', 'drop-dead', 'funny', 'deadly', 'serious', 'issues.One', 'funniest', 'things', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', ""n't"", 'film', 'British', 'version', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'contained', 'final', 'chapter', 'had', 'been', 'truncated', 'inadvertently', 'American', 'version', 'Burgess', 'denouement', 'Alex', 'growing', 'up', 'leaving', 'rebellious', 'ways', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'American', 'who', 'lived', 'England', 'happened', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'British', 'writer', 'novel', 'United', 'States', 'unusual', 'circumstance', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'age', 'instead', 'coming', 'psychosis']",N/A

85870,A3OZMHAH1QP1YK,0790701022,VIN,"[2, 12]","Someone mentioned A Clockwork Orange is rather Orwellian and I tend to agree. It's a metaphorical, abstract movie in many ways. (I have not read the book). I can't truly tell if it has much depth in its undertones because they are clouded and inconsistent, unlike Orwell's 1984.What I got from this movie after seeing it, was that violence is bad, you reap what you sow. I don't particularly care for much of the buzz people surround with such films/books as this because in the case of A Clockwork Orange, it's quite over-rated.Stanley Kubrick may be a great director, and while I admit he did a good job of de-glorifying the violence, and that in some (only some) parts music was used well, I do not agree that this is a brilliant movie. It was mostly nonsensical and led nowhere. There wasn't much violence in it really, but if rape fascinates you, then I supposed parts of this movie will tickle your pickle.I did like Malcolm's acting. His commentary is amusing, his narration pulls you into his mind where he is not quite all there. Whether you like him or dislike him is your own opinion, but Malcolm's acting conveyed a sense of malice, cleverness, evil, and humour and blended it all together masterfully. I can't say much for the other 'actors' in the movie, especially the wheel-chair bound man who I found very irritating to watch and spoilt much of the movie.I give it 3 stars mainly for Malcolm's acting, and the fact that the movie explores some niche topics such as rape and social conditioning.

85871,A4YXKE5F62II8,0790701022,Visual Bureau,"[2, 2]","""A very classic case in film censorship, dystopian fiction, and sadism, A Clockwork Orange is the disturbingly ultimate example of what went wrong and why is it so beloved by cult audiences and film aficionados! Like 1984, Brazil, and V for Vendetta (none of these films I consider science fiction but ""speculative fiction"" due to the stereotypes and false pretenses of the genre).It reflects a paranoid future where the government is not trustworthy but in this film, the offender is a complex sorts and that is Malcolm McDowell's breakthrough performance as Alex DeLarge, your ""faithful narrator"" and fellow sadist, protagonist, criminal, psychopath, false do-gooder, and comedian. DeLarge evokes a characteristic in him that makes you cringe and find repulsion in his actions but then celebrate, laugh, and probably feel sympathy for his change before and after he endures psychological treatment and religious tuition in prison. The DeLarge character is surprisingly effective and can approach the viewer with something daring that you cannot take your eyes off the madness.The film, despite its controversial history, is certainly one full of strong ambition, storyline, creativity, innovation, and trauma that no wonder many claim of its success and popularity. What is especially significant and strong about the film is not only the character but how there's a great abundance and context within the storyline and the many themes (especially dealing with juvenile deliquency, government control, psychological testing, and the sinful pleasure of harm, whether it be physical or sexualised) associated in the work bringing a dense, disturbing yet intriguing experience. As a result, the second part of the film (which examines DeLarge's descent to sanity) was better, more provocative, and intriguing to the themes and story it is trying to tell than watching Alex's madness which is still important.Personally, DeLarge in the end was imperfect and insincere from how I see it and his wrongs are a mixed manifestation of his parents being negligent, the kind of friends he hangs around (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), his secret, perverted obsession with classical music, watching destruction, and women, and how at a changing period in Britain's moral standpoint how restricting the means to be a full-bodied citizen and the confused mix of liberalism and conservatism in society.Despite much of the film to be lauded over for, I do feel guilty watching a film that has been scorned, withdrawn by British film censors (not banned, contrary to popular viewpoint), delivered death threats to, and reviled by more conservative, uncertain viewers in its time in the same way guilt can come across watching films like Kick-Ass, 9 Songs, Natural Born Killers, Easy Rider, The Birth of a Nation, Religulous, or a Roman Polanski film. But then again, the film's exploration of violent behaviour and juvenile deliquence is handled in a way where two scenarios are examined with an element of uncertain morality because Alex is first shown as a maniac then a slightly responsible, facetious member of society, and then turning back toward his twisted and more-than-complex moral dilemma around the end not knowing he has caused a panic or surge in public opinion (especially when he sings the Gene Kelly song in Frank Alexander's house, says crude jokes to a nurse and thinks about having sex while wrestling with a woman in a sarcastic way).The 18 certificate (formerly X-rated in USA and UK) was well-deserved for a film with this kind of material but the film feels a little more responsible than Kick-Ass (unfortunately has a BBFC 15 certificate due to comedy), Rambo, or Human Centipede, due to the second part of the film serving some ambiguous justice. But back in 1971, the film understandably would've had to been considered a little more strict than by now but the withdrawal, by today's standards, would seem ineffective given the rise of piracy and access to the Internet, an issue China is trying to combat.By-and-large, it is a very interpretative work and Kubrick and Burgess have a very good job at this classic and surely a new generation of more educated, non-impressionable filmgoers will understand where this novel and adaptation stands.""",5,"One of the most controversial, ambitious, detailed, darkly comic, and morally complex films ever made!

85875,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0790701022,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 3]","Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a dark, brutal satire of the youth culture of the 70's a sort of inversion of the ""peace, love"" generation that preceded it that captures the narcissitic 80's a full decade before the ""Me"" culture of greed and self involvement took center stage.Unfortunately, this is the same transfer as the previous Blu-ray disc and some clips from the new documentary stuff looks better than THIS transfer. This transfer doesn't look horrible BUT WHY Warner didn't include the 4K new transfer they just did for the new theatrical showing is beyond me. They could have very easily because they didn't just throw the old disc from the previous set into new packaging.What's in this edition?This latest 40 anniversary two disc edition features the same transfer as the previous edition so if you are looking for an upgrade the image quality is exactly the same encode (although freeing up some of the disc space may have improved the quality slightly I didn't see it). We also get a lossless DTS 5.1 mix rather than the uncompressed LPCM soundtrack--the only difference is the latter consumes less disc space but they are comparable in quality.  The inclusion of the previous transfer isn't necessarily a bad thing as Warner did an exceptional job and the additional room on the disc allows for a very slight improvement for the film. Keep in mind that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a 40 year old film and, as such, it looks quite good and striking for its age but it's unlikely to look like it was shot yesterday. There's plenty of fine grain on display as well giving the presentation a nice, striking quality.The real reason to upgrade this if you are a fan of the movie and Kubrick is the inclusion of Jan Harlan's documentary on Kubrick (Harlan was Kubrick's brother-in-law and co-producer for many of his films)on disc two. It's an exceptional documentary that was previously only available in the Stanley Kubrick DVD boxed set from a couple of years back. It is, however, presented in standard definition. All of the special features from the previous single disc Blu-ray have been retained.Ported over from the previous edition is the documentary ""O Lucky Malcolm"" (referring to another dark satire that the star Malcolm McDowell was involved in ""O Lucky Man"")but not on disc two. ""O Lucky Malcolm"" is presented in HD.We also get the excellent commentary from Nick Redman and McDowell that is both enlightening and an intelligent take on the meaning of the film now and then.We also get some new special features in high def but including one with McDowell recalling working on the film while flipping through production photos and another where he recites Alex's opening speech as other directors discuss how our world reflects the world of the movie (It does and it doesn't. It's also much more complex than that)and how it influenced other films.Finally there's the ""book""--the Blu-ray discs are housed in a hardcover book with production photos.Kubrick's adaption of Burgess' novel is a sort of  inverted Pygmalion. As brilliant as Burgess' novel, the film brings some of the best sequences in the  novel to life with stunning, brutal clarity and satiric wit. Burgess himself  acknowledged as much stating that Kubrick's film was a ""radical  remaking of my own novel"" that was every bit Kubrick's as the source  material was Burgess.Kubrick's  most controversial film ( perhaps even more so than Lolita), this is a  classic film that is a radical as mainstream cinema gets.The bottom line: Should you buy this again if you have the single disc Blu-ray? I'd say no unless you don't have the Kubrick documentary which is excellent (although it would have been nice to see that upgraded to HD)and the few new featurettes included. The price difference may make a difference in that decision as well since this is a bit more expensive than the original single disc edition. If you don't have it--get it but if you have the previous single disc edition (unless you must have the excellent documentary ""A Life in Pictures"" about Kubrick), I'd skip this edition and spent your money on something new like the forthcoming reissues of ""Lolita"" and ""Barry Lyndon"".If you have the previous edition--wait until they reissue this with the 4K upgrade for the Blu-ray edition.",5,Classic satire but it isn't for everybody-Revised review for 40th Anniversary release of 5/31/11,930787200,"07 1, 1999",1999,4293,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'dark', 'brutal', 'satire', 'youth', 'culture', '70', 'sort', 'inversion', 'peace', 'love', 'generation', 'preceded', 'narcissitic', '80', 'full', 'decade', 'Me', 'culture', 'greed', 'self', 'involvement', 'took', 'center', 'stage.Unfortunately', 'same', 'transfer', 'previous', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'clips', 'new', 'documentary', 'stuff', 'better', 'THIS', 'transfer', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'look', 'horrible', 'BUT', 'WHY', 'Warner', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', '4K', 'new', 'transfer', 'just', 'did', 'new', 'theatrical', 'showing', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'old', 'disc', 'previous', 'set', 'new', 'packaging.What', 'edition', 'latest', '40', 'anniversary', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'same', 'transfer', 'previous', 'edition', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'upgrade', 'image', 'quality', 'exactly', 'same', 'encode', 'freeing', 'up', 'disc', 'space', 'may', 'have', 'improved', 'quality', 'slightly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'also', 'get', 'lossless', 'DTS', '5.1', 'mix', 'rather', 'uncompressed', 'LPCM', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'difference', 'latter', 'consumes', 'less', 'disc', 'space', 'are', 'comparable', 'quality', 'inclusion', 'previous', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Warner', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'additional', 'room', 'disc', 'very', 'slight', 'improvement', 'film', 'Keep', 'mind', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '40', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'such', 'quite', 'good', 'striking', 'age', 'unlikely', 'look', 'was', 'shot', 'yesterday', 'plenty', 'fine', 'grain', 'display', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'presentation', 'nice', 'striking', 'quality.The', 'real', 'reason', 'upgrade', 'are', 'fan', 'movie', 'Kubrick', 'inclusion', 'Jan', 'Harlan', 'documentary', 'Kubrick', 'Harlan', 'was', 'Kubrick', 'brother-in-law', 'co-producer', 'many', 'films', 'disc', 'two', 'exceptional', 'documentary', 'was', 'previously', 'only', 'available', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'however', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition', 'special', 'features', 'previous', 'single', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', 'have', 'been', 'retained.Ported', 'previous', 'edition', 'documentary', 'O', 'Lucky', 'Malcolm', 'referring', 'dark', 'satire', 'star', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'was', 'involved', 'O', 'Lucky', 'Man', 'not', 'disc', 'two', 'O', 'Lucky', 'Malcolm', 'presented', 'HD.We', 'also', 'get', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'Nick', 'Redman', 'McDowell', 'enlightening', 'intelligent', 'take', 'meaning', 'film', 'now', 'then.We', 'also', 'get', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'high', 'def', 'including', 'one', 'McDowell', 'recalling', 'working', 'film', 'flipping', 'production', 'photos', 'where', 'Alex', 'opening', 'speech', 'other', 'directors', 'discuss', 'how', 'world', 'world', 'movie', ""n't"", 'also', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'how', 'influenced', 'other', 'films.Finally', 'book', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'hardcover', 'book', 'production', 'photos.Kubrick', 'adaption', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'sort', 'inverted', 'Pygmalion', 'As', 'brilliant', 'Burgess', 'novel', 'film', 'best', 'sequences', 'novel', 'life', 'stunning', 'brutal', 'clarity', 'satiric', 'wit', 'Burgess', 'acknowledged', 'as', 'much', 'stating', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'was', 'radical', 'remaking', 'own', 'novel', 'was', 'bit', 'Kubrick', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'Burgess.Kubrick', 'most', 'controversial', 'film', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Lolita', 'classic', 'film', 'radical', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'gets.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Should', 'buy', 'again', 'have', 'single', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Kubrick', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'upgraded', 'HD', 'few', 'new', 'featurettes', 'included', 'price', 'difference', 'may', 'make', 'difference', 'decision', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'more', 'expensive', 'original', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'have', 'previous', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'must', 'have', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Life', 'Pictures', 'Kubrick', ""'d"", 'skip', 'edition', 'spent', 'money', 'something', 'new', 'forthcoming', 'reissues', 'Lolita', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', '.If', 'have', 'previous', 'edition', 'wait', 'reissue', '4K', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray', 'edition']",N/A
85876,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,0790701022,"""weirdo_87""","[3, 4]","After watching Clockwork Orange again, I still consider that it is, along with Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's best work. The reason is that both films had a very strong message. Not saying that Kubrick's other works had no point. But the messages at the center of these films were pretty clear: Dr. Strangelove showed that waging Nuclear War would cause the destruction of mankind. Clockwork Orange debated about crime and how it should be dealt with. It also debated about politics, volunteer police and about society's future. Finally, it showed that all of our actions have consequences, both good and bad.It was the way this bleak, cruel future was depicted that made Clockwork Orange controversial and debatable even today. Raping of women, gang wars, and beatings are done to happy, cheerful, classical music. Also, some of the films Alex is showed when he undergoes the Ludovico Treatment, such as footage of Nazi rallies and World War II, is played to parts of Beethoven's 9th symphony. Clockwork Orange also has the same sense of black comedy Dr. Strangelove has. I could not help myself from chuckling during the gang war between Alex's Droogs and another gang of droogs as it plays to another classic music theme.I for one still believe that ACO is Kubrick's best, even despite the violence, nudity, rape and the controversy. Besides if it still is shocking, disgusting and stirs up controversy today, that means Mr. Kubrick did his job. I thanked him after I saw the movie. I know that, up there, he was listening.My Dad on the other hand, who I watched the movie with to change his opinion about a film that he saw 3 decades ago, stated he never wanted to see it again for the rest of his life and that it was against his better judgment to let me watch it.

85877,AAD2DYRK43BYF,0790701022,Weston J. Kathman,"[50, 60]","A lot of people would say that Stanley Kubrick's best work was 2001: A Space Oddyssey or Dr. Strangelove, but Clockwork Orange is his most remarkable film.  Combining the best qualities of both 2001 and Strangelove  -- which are both fantastic films also -- never before has Kubrick given  audiences such a satirically brilliant movie.  For some people, Clockwork  will be hard to stomach; the rape scene at the beginning is pretty explicit  and there's a lot of nudity.  The fighting scenes, though, are for the most  part more comical than brutal.  Whether you hate it or love it -- and there  isn't a lot of room for middle ground to be taken with this film -- you  will certainly remember it because it will most likely have some kind of  impact on you.  In his first film role, Malcolm McDowell gives an  incredible performance as the twisted gang leader Alex, who delights in  rape, ultraviolenece, and Beethoven.  McDowell is amusing and frightening  at the same time and, without a solid, believable performance from the  lead, this film would not have worked.  The rest of the characters are  eccentric, too, although their sole purpose is to reinforce the qualities  of Alex.  There are two major themes in this film, one of which deals with  politicians and the manipulation with which they operate in order to avoid  bad publicity.  When the operation to reform Alex backfires, causing him  terrible trouble as opposed to making him a decent person, the politician  who originally championed the controversial operation does a quick clean-up  job so that the situation won't seem as bad as it is.  He offers Alex a  cushy government job, basically an attempt to bribe the criminal so that he  won't go to the papers with his horrifying experience.  Alex, of course, is  too young and unschooled to realize that he has been taken advantage of --  both by the people who promoted the operation and by those who opposed it  -- and he is just happy to be himself again.  The other main theme of this  film deals with how far we should or shouldn't go in order to reform people  who commit heinous crimes.  If we ever developed the technology to do such  a procedure as was done on Alex, this film gives us a good reason not to go  through with it.  Besides taking away a person's inborn ability to make his  own moral choices, this would also leave the person particularly vulnerable  to the revenge of those he's wronged in the past (which is what happens to  Alex).  The book of the same title, which was authored by Alex Burgess, is  even better than the film and deserves more credit as a literary  masterpiece.  Some people believe that the movie is too soft and doesn't go  as far as the book as far as the sexual scenes are concerned, but this  movie will offend enough people without Alex taking advantage of two naive,  pre-teen girls.  Burgess himself was disappointed by the film (he makes  this obvious in the newer version of the book) because the book was 21  chapters and the movie ended at the conclusion of the 20th chapter;  however, the ending of the movie works better on screen while the ending of  the book works better on paper.  In each context, the endings work.  Besides, the movie was already two and a half hours, and adding the book's  ending would have meant at least 30 more minutes.  Anyway, A Clockwork  Orange is a thrilling experience and should not be missed, whether you like  Kubrick or not.

85881,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,0790701022,Wing J. Flanagan,"[14, 20]","A Clockwork Orange is among Stanley Kubrick's most analyzed films.  In a way, it is a sort of political Rorschach test.  An essay in a major newspaper contemporaneous with its release proclaimed that Liberals should be outraged with the film and make a point of staying away from it.  Other reviews claim to find evidence that it clearly slams right-wing Conservatives.  So which side is correct?After many, many viewings, I would say both.  Stanley Kubrick, although he seemed basically left of center (as are most artists), was, above all, intellectually honest.  He seemed to understand that extremes in political thought, regardless of ideology, end up taking us to the same, unpleasant territory - one where freedom evaporates and a ruling elite controls everything.In the film, a young street punk named Alex (Malcom McDowell) and his &quot;droogs&quot; (friends) systematically victimize a number of people in graphically horrible ways.  He is caught, sent to prison, and &quot;reformed&quot; with a horrific (and plausible) bit of operant conditioning (known as the Ludovico Treatment) that makes him physically sick at even the thought of committing a violent act - even in self-defense.  This, of course, opens an opportunity for those he victimized to get their revenge in the third act, without fear of reprisal by the &quot;reformed&quot; Alex.Conservatives who like the film claim that the Minister of the Interior who champions the Ludovico Treatment must be a flaming Liberal, trying to &quot;turn the bad into good&quot; by &quot;converting&quot; Alex into a model citizen.  He is clearly opposed by more Right-wing &quot;establishment&quot; types - the prison Chaplain, and the prison Governor.  Yet - if this is so, then Mr. Alexander (who exacts near-fatal revenge on Alex while furthering his own political causes) would have to be a conservative, too, and clearly, he is not.Liberals who claim the film as their own point to the Fascistic undercurrents of the Very New Broom - the just-elected government that hires young hoodlums into the police force, practices brainwashing, and then tries to cover it all up by manipulating the press.In truth, Kubrick was very careful not to indicate very clearly what side was being skewered by his satirical rapier at any given time. Both Left and Right have periodically taken up &quot;reform&quot; or &quot;law and order&quot; or &quot;personal liberty&quot; as causes. What I take from the film is that brainless adherence to any particular ideology is foolish at best, no matter how well intentioned.The key to understanding A Clockwork Orange is a speech given by an unlikely character, the prison Chaplain. He is, until this scene in the film, portrayed as a bit of a buffoon, and not someone we should take seriously.  He becomes the moral voice of the story, saying, simply, that when a person can no longer choose between right and wrong, he or she ceases to be a person in any meaningful sense of the word. Robbing someone of moral choice is a grave sin - at least as bad for society to commit against the criminal as whatever sins the criminal may have committed against society.Really, people who call themselves Liberals OR Conservatives could find reason to be offended by A Clockwork Orange.  People who try to think for themselves, regardless of their political leanings, will find something of value in it.The new digital video transfer and remastered Dolby 5.1 audio are welcome improvements over previous video releases.  The film may never have looked or sounded better.

85884,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,0790701022,Zack H.,"[4, 4]","A Clockwork Orange is about a teenager named Alex, who, along with his three ""droogs"", participates in beating and raping helpless victims during the night. After being slapped around by Alex, and a night of the ol' ""ultraviolence"", the droogies decide to knock him out and leave him for the police to find. He agrees to participate in a new, yet controversial treatment that will shorten his jail sentence. When he is eventually let out, he becomes A Clockwork Orange, which is an object (or person in the case of the movie) which appears normal on the outside but is completely artificial or ""mechanical"" on the inside. He loathes violence, and can't defend himself, but his ex-droogs, and his victims are looking for revenge.Stanley Kubrick's direction is top notch as usual, as he was a perfectionist, and in my opinion, got the best from his cast, who were, and still are, excluding Malcolm McDowell, unknowns. Malcolm McDowell's performance is truly oscar worthy, and I'm surprised he didn't win. I really can't imagine any actor playing the part of Alex other than him. Even Kubrick said that if McDowell hadn't been available to play the part, then he probably wouldn't have done the movie. I also read somewhere during the ""Ludivico Treatment"" scene, one of his eyelids was scratched by the glazzy clips, also when they were filming the scene where Dim and Georgie were drowning him while beating him, he almost drowned because the breathing pipe in the water messed up. That's true commitment to a film, if you ask me. McDowell also became immensely afraid of eyedrops after filming the scene. There adds to the commitment - doing something so many times so as to become afraid of eyedrops. McDowell's performance in ACO is, in my opinion, one of the greatest, most underrated performances in movie history.As for the question, ""Is this Kubrick's best?"", well, I'd say 2001 is his best, but as we all know, opinions differ. In terms of greatness, it's definitely one of his best. I think it is a must-see for any film-lover of any kind.- Zack, 16 years old",5,"Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange""",1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2066,"['Clockwork', 'Orange', 'teenager', 'named', 'Alex', 'who', 'three', 'droogs', 'beating', 'raping', 'helpless', 'victims', 'night', 'being', 'slapped', 'Alex', 'night', 'ol', 'ultraviolence', 'droogies', 'decide', 'knock', 'out', 'leave', 'police', 'find', 'participate', 'new', 'yet', 'controversial', 'treatment', 'will', 'shorten', 'jail', 'sentence', 'When', 'eventually', 'let', 'out', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'object', 'person', 'case', 'movie', 'normal', 'outside', 'completely', 'artificial', 'mechanical', 'inside', 'violence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'defend', 'ex-droogs', 'victims', 'are', 'looking', 'revenge.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'usual', 'was', 'perfectionist', 'opinion', 'got', 'best', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'excluding', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'unknowns', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'performance', 'truly', 'oscar', 'worthy', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'Alex', 'other', 'Even', 'Kubrick', 'said', 'McDowell', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'available', 'play', 'part', 'then', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'also', 'read', 'somewhere', 'Ludivico', 'Treatment', 'scene', 'one', 'eyelids', 'was', 'scratched', 'glazzy', 'clips', 'also', 'when', 'were', 'filming', 'scene', 'where', 'Dim', 'Georgie', 'were', 'drowning', 'beating', 'almost', 'drowned', 'breathing', 'pipe', 'water', 'messed', 'up', 'true', 'commitment', 'film', 'ask', 'McDowell', 'also', 'became', 'immensely', 'afraid', 'eyedrops', 'filming', 'scene', 'commitment', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'become', 'afraid', 'eyedrops', 'McDowell', 'performance', 'ACO', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'underrated', 'performances', 'movie', 'history.As', 'question', 'Kubrick', 'best', 'well', ""'d"", 'say', '2001', 'best', 'know', 'opinions', 'differ', 'terms', 'greatness', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'think', 'must-see', 'film-lover', 'kind.-', 'Zack', '16', 'years', 'old']",N/A
