Season two was not released until this past February, just five days shy of a full four years between the releases.  Warner seems to release these weird little collections as a way to test the market before committing to a project.I am not sure if Warner Home Video has some madman at the controls who methodical sifts through all related materials in a quest to create the perfect release or they are just really lazy.
