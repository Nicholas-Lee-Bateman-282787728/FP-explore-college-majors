Aside from that it falls a very flat on itself. It focuses too much on ""Competition games"" where it could use more lore and world development.Then it focuses WAY TOO MUCH on people groping the females breasts and making crude comments. The time spent making crude female sexually objective nonsense could have been used for story  development and world lore. Instead we get somewhat soft core grope porn with a flat story. In the end I certainly wouldn't recommend it for children under 15 nor would I consider watching it a second time.",2,A Little Empty and Bland,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,659,"['are', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'Anime', 'art', 'direction', 'few', 'characters', 'Felli', 'Sharnid', 'music', 'Aside', 'very', 'flat', 'too', 'much', 'Competition', 'games', 'where', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'lore', 'world', 'development.Then', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'people', 'groping', 'females', 'breasts', 'making', 'crude', 'comments', 'time', 'spent', 'making', 'crude', 'female', 'sexually', 'objective', 'nonsense', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'story', 'development', 'world', 'lore', 'Instead', 'get', 'somewhat', 'soft', 'core', 'grope', 'porn', 'flat', 'story', 'end', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'children', '15', 'would', 'consider', 'watching', 'second', 'time']",Chrome Shelled Regios

Aiken ""social observer""","[2, 19]","Leaving most of the many questions unanswered is not that big of a deal as it becomes clear the real purpose of this series is the interpersonal relationships between/among the various players. Why there is a barren landscape and large bugs isn't really important as much too much of anime has mass destruction of civilization/the environment for any number of reasons and it would be a waste of time to come up with still another reason why it happened this time. It was rather interesting watching the sub-titled version and I should have left it alone and not gotten this the dubbed version as I spent so much time reading the subtitles I did not notice just how damn UGLY the characters are,with a possible exception of Felli and only because a portion of her bangs fell across her face.Anime has always had spotty success with noses but this time they look like diseased growths on their faces and,matched with unattractive eyes,it became unbearable to finish rewatching this series. Monica Rial dubbed Felli and did her normal excellent job and,while Collen Clinkenbeard was heavily involved with production,character design was so bad their efforts were wasted. Even if Felli got naked,which she didn't,it cannot be recommended.",2,Chrome Shelled Regios,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,1235,"['Leaving', 'most', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'clear', 'real', 'purpose', 'series', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'various', 'players', 'Why', 'barren', 'landscape', 'large', 'bugs', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'anime', 'mass', 'destruction', 'civilization/the', 'environment', 'number', 'reasons', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'come', 'up', 'still', 'reason', 'why', 'happened', 'time', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'watching', 'sub-titled', 'version', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'alone', 'not', 'gotten', 'dubbed', 'version', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'just', 'how', 'damn', 'UGLY', 'characters', 'are', 'possible', 'exception', 'Felli', 'only', 'portion', 'bangs', 'fell', 'face.Anime', 'always', 'had', 'spotty', 'success', 'noses', 'time', 'look', 'diseased', 'growths', 'matched', 'unattractive', 'eyes', 'became', 'unbearable', 'finish', 'rewatching', 'series', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'dubbed', 'Felli', 'did', 'normal', 'excellent', 'job', 'Collen', 'Clinkenbeard', 'was', 'heavily', 'involved', 'production', 'character', 'design', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'efforts', 'were', 'wasted', 'Even', 'Felli', 'got', 'naked', 'did', ""n't"", 'can', 'not', 'be', 'recommended']",Chrome Shelled Regios

They have special abilities that allow them to do extraordinaire things to combat alien monsters that are bent on devouring them.  The main character chosen his path and is expelled from the legendary brotherhood of heaven's blades and banished from his home.  He moves to a another Regios in order to find a new path for life and gets sucked back into fighting.The character development is very good.

1513724,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0069556YU,RavenRing,"[16, 18]","In the far distant future, people live in large, domed moving cities, because the outside air is poisonous and bug like monsters known as Contaminoids wander the earth. Zuelleni is an academic city where pretty much the entire population is made up of students and everything is run by the student council president. Layfon, a teenage boy with a mysterious past, comes to Zuelleni to escape said past. He wants to start his life anew, as a regular, average student. But too bad for him - upon arriving at school for the first day, he is immediately forced into the military arts program. He is assigned to the 17th Platoon, after leader Nina asks for him to fill a recently vacated spot on the team. The rest of the platoon consists of mechanical ace Harley, sharpshooter and ladies man Sharnid, and ne'in operator Felli. However, it is pretty soon evident that Layfon isn't in any need of military training.....I actually quite enjoyed this series. I'm not really sure why, since there are many weak points and plot holes. But I think a big part of my enjoyment was the fact that Layfon starts out as an extremely strong fighter. It was kind of refreshing to have a character that didn't need to push his limits of endurance in order to master that next powerful technique so he can save... who or whatever. In addition, Layfon's technique is just really cool. He has as sword, which isn't very interesting, but he also wields a multi threaded whip like device. The threads are made of up his 'kei', so there are as many of them as he wants to generate, they are extremely sharp, and he has great control over them. It was just fun to watch any fight where he used that weapon.I gave this series 4 stars, but it is really a 3.5. I enjoyed the world the series was set in, I liked Felli and Layfon, I didn't really hate any of the characters, and the plot was interesting. However! There is no resolution in the end. All those questions raised during the course of the series? 2 are answered. Really. Layfon's reason for coming to Zuelleni and Leerin's relationship to the Queen are the only 2 explained. Out of, I dunno, 10 important questions? Yeah, basically 1/5 of the mystery behind the show is explained. The ending was really pathetic.But despite the (enormous) setbacks, I still like the show and still think it is something worth watching for the random entertainment. I'll probably buy it once a cheap set comes out. But I will forever be disappointed with how the ending was handled (a note here: this show is based on a book series, so I guess the story continues on a lot longer. Still no excuse for how they handled the anime ending though).",4,A Desolate World,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2655,"['far', 'distant', 'future', 'people', 'live', 'large', 'domed', 'moving', 'cities', 'outside', 'air', 'poisonous', 'bug', 'monsters', 'known', 'Contaminoids', 'wander', 'earth', 'Zuelleni', 'academic', 'city', 'where', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'population', 'made', 'students', 'everything', 'run', 'student', 'council', 'president', 'Layfon', 'teenage', 'boy', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Zuelleni', 'escape', 'said', 'past', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'regular', 'average', 'student', 'too', 'bad', 'arriving', 'school', 'first', 'day', 'immediately', 'forced', 'military', 'arts', 'program', 'assigned', '17th', 'Platoon', 'leader', 'Nina', 'fill', 'recently', 'vacated', 'spot', 'team', 'rest', 'platoon', 'mechanical', 'ace', 'Harley', 'sharpshooter', 'ladies', 'man', 'Sharnid', ""ne'in"", 'operator', 'Felli', 'However', 'pretty', 'soon', 'evident', 'Layfon', ""n't"", 'need', 'military', 'training', '..I', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'many', 'weak', 'points', 'plot', 'holes', 'think', 'big', 'part', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'fact', 'Layfon', 'out', 'extremely', 'strong', 'fighter', 'was', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'have', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'push', 'limits', 'endurance', 'order', 'master', 'next', 'powerful', 'technique', 'can', 'save', 'who', 'addition', 'Layfon', 'technique', 'just', 'really', 'cool', 'as', 'sword', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'multi', 'threaded', 'whip', 'device', 'threads', 'are', 'made', ""'kei"", 'are', 'many', 'generate', 'are', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'great', 'control', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'fight', 'where', 'used', 'weapon.I', 'gave', 'series', '4', 'stars', 'really', '3.5', 'enjoyed', 'world', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'liked', 'Felli', 'Layfon', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hate', 'characters', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'However', 'resolution', 'end', 'questions', 'raised', 'course', 'series', '2', 'are', 'answered', 'Really', 'Layfon', 'reason', 'coming', 'Zuelleni', 'Leerin', 'relationship', 'Queen', 'are', 'only', '2', 'explained', 'dunno', '10', 'important', 'questions', 'Yeah', 'basically', '1/5', 'mystery', 'show', 'explained', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'pathetic.But', 'enormous', 'setbacks', 'still', 'show', 'still', 'think', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'random', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'once', 'cheap', 'set', 'out', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'ending', 'was', 'handled', 'note', 'here', 'show', 'based', 'book', 'series', 'guess', 'story', 'lot', 'longer', 'Still', 'excuse', 'how', 'handled', 'anime', 'ending']",Chrome Shelled Regios
