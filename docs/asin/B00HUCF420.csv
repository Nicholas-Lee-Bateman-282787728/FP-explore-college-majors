1692126,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00HUCF420,C. B Collins Jr.,"[5, 6]","This series is excellent. I was impressed with the cunning of the script and the way it kept me off guard throughout the entire series. It is a screenplay that blurs the lines between an investigation of a serial killer and the two detectives that pursue that killer over a 17 year period. The character development was exceptional which has to be attributed not only to the well written and paced script but primarily to the exceptional acting of Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. This may be McConaughey&#8217;s finest role to date as the viewer tries to decipher the mind and motives of this odd character that he creates on the screen. McConaughey plays Russ Cohle, a damaged but brilliant man. He is a fascinating character for his complete pessimism, cynicism, and desire for justice.  I found his complexity to be very appealing for how can a man with such cunning and intelligence, with such a dark view of the world, believe that justice can be won?  This is why he is one of the most unique of heroes for he knows that justice is hard won and a price must be paid. Woody Harrelson plays a bit more mainstream character but as the series develops viewers see the layers peel off, revealing the depths of this character that Harrelson creates. The series revolves around a terrible crime made bizarre by demonic ritualistic overtones but it is the cleverness of actors, writers, and director to ensure that the crime is the glue that holds the character development and character conflicts together. This is not Sherlock Holmes and Mr. Watson and the constant grating of these two strong personalities against each other makes for fascinating entertainment. The unfolding crime and investigation is balanced perfectly with the amazing character development of the two men who have entered this investigation together. Cinematography and art direction are excellent in this series, in fact some of the scenes are so nasty that it makes you want to take a bath.  But make no mistake, it is adult entertainment, and involves serial murders, nude bodies, alcoholism, prostitution, political and police corruption, and drugs.

But what you get is one of the best one off casts you will ever see.The McConaissance A.k.a. the transformation of Matthew McConaughey from an A-list chick flick/Rom-com actor into a serious Oscar worthy actor.

1692131,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,B00HUCF420,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[3, 4]","True Detective is one of those rare TV shows that actually suffers from its extremely high quality. Each episode is better than the last and about six episodes in, it looks to be one of the most dense, mosaic, and brilliant pieces of fiction to grace the mainstream small-screen. Naturally, as the closing episodes near, viewer expectation is insanely high. But in order to satisfy and match the quality of the previous episodes, the ending would have to be almost supernaturally great, something so mind-blowing and glorious that all other TV shows would look like child's play in comparison. Then the last episode hits and the audience realizes that behind all of the mythology and smoke and mirrors and red herrings, Rust Cohle and Marty Hart are living in the real world, one where stories, no matter how big or small, must come to a close. And while the narrative does come to a realistic conclusion, the finale is still suffused with the same oddball existential rants that make True Detective a true classic. The character of Rust is probably too complicated for his own good. His nihilistic outlook on life contradicts his involvement with the justice-driven police force. His pessimistic outlook on religion conflicts with the speech at the end about his daughter. It's hard to say if these are flaws in writing or just conflicting perspectives from a deeply troubled man too smart for his own good. He's someone trapped in the confines of his own genius, but like any human, he can have his frame of mind shattered by life's twisted order. Marty Hart is a perfect foil for Rust. Hart is a man driven by emotion and impulse. He is essentially Rust's only connection to reality and while he is equally flawed, he is the far more sympathetic and relatable of the two. Bravo to Nic Pizzolatto for creating these characters and the cruel world they inhabit. The finest details are fleshed out to the point that it would take multiple viewings to appreciate just how rich and intricately plotted the series is. Really, nothing but praise to Mr. Pizzolatto. Then there is the director, Cary Joji Fukunaga, who brought Nic's vision to life. He succeeds in creating the perfect atmosphere for the world the characters inhabit and he, along with DP Adam Arkapaw, shot it beautifully. While the majority of the show is rather standard fare visually, it does have it's unbelievably high moments, like the 6-minute tracking shot at the end of episode four, ranking as one of the most ambitious shots in television history. T Bone Burnett lends to the gloomy bayou atmosphere with a host of country-fried blues numbers that aren't necessarily as 'grabby' as, say, Breaking Bad's music choice, but fitting nonetheless. And saving the best for last, the performances are truly unforgettable. The Lincoln Lawyer, Killer Joe, Bernie, Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street, and most significantly, Dallas Buyers Club, have all contributed to Matthew McConaughey's unforeseen resurgence, but his work in True Detective is arguably the pinnacle of his career. He takes a character that certainly isn't easy to get a read on and completely embodies him. It's obvious he understood the highly complex role and just made it his own. Woody Harrelson, an always dependable actor with a penchant for lunatic personas, changes pace here with an everyman type character that's developed and engaging enough to keep up with the overpowering Rust. Harrelson pulls off rage better than any other emotion, but he still remains totally believable in scenes requiring more finesse and subtlety.

Things plod along punctuated by gratuitous graphic scenes of nudity, sex and drug use that do little to advance the narrative.  McConaughey plays a real weirdo, the type of character he seems to be gravitating to these days and Harrleson's mysogynistic bozo will make you wish for the days when he was lovable lug Woody on cheers.

Although arguably the greatest series of all time, 'The Wire', could be labelled a 'cop show', and there have been some very good police dramas through the years, why bother? Enough with the cops, already... more Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Rome, Boardwalk Empire, The Walking Dead, The Pacific, American Horror Story-type unexpectedness. Except... the writers of True Detective knew there was still some crazy, unexpected storytelling left in the good old Homicide. It uses a multi-layered narrative technique that weaves together events surrounding a murder investigation in the mid-90's and present-day interviews of the two investigating detectives, played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, conducted by two younger detectives who are interested in these past events for reasons they are unwilling to share. Both Harrelson and McConaughey give absolutely brilliant performances, but McConaughey gets the standout role with 'Rust' Cohle, a former deep-undercover agent with blood on his hands (Looking gaunt and slightly emaciated, likely related to the weight-cut he endured to play an AIDS-sufferer in 'The Dallas Buyers Club', it fits perfectly with Cohle's monk-like psychic self-flagellation, and his hollowed-out features contribute to his haunted, thousand-yard-stare -- through which he communicates the numbness, the emptiness his character has traded for the agony that would consume him if he allowed himself to feel). He also has the death of his young daughter and his failed marriage haunting him, for which he self-prescribes various opiates and benzodiazepines. He feels compelled to bombard his partner and anyone else with his own acidic brand of existential nihilism, when he's compelled to speak at all. This, of course, does not go down well with his brothers in blue, and his partner, Marty Hart (played by Harrelson), finds himself forced to defend a cop he doesn't like. Hart is a family man, with a loving wife and daughter, but keeps a girlfriend on the side, a situation threatening to blow up in his face. As the two men get deeper into their investigation of a young woman murdered in a manner that suggests pagan ritual, with Lovecraftian themes and recurring symbols, Hart begins to appreciate Cohle's gifts as a detective, and an uneasy friendship starts to develop from that, until everything goes straight to hell... It is only when the tale loops back to the present that any kind of resolution can be found. The writing, by Nic Pizzolatto, and direction, by Cary Fukunaga, is brilliant throughout the season. Unlike most shows, both men handled writing and directing duties for every episode, which likely helped make it such a clear and distinctive vision. I can only hope that next season comes close to accomplishing what this one did.",5,"Yes, Another Cop Show, But One Hell Of A Cop Show",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,2993,"['strange', 'new', 'world', 'where', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'high', 'art', 'alongside', 'literature', 'cinema', 'was', 'not', 'immediately', 'thrilled', 'new', 'cop', 'show', 'named', ""'True"", 'Detective', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'series', 'time', 'Wire', 'could', 'be', 'labelled', ""'cop"", 'show', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'police', 'dramas', 'years', 'why', 'bother', 'Enough', 'cops', 'already', 'more', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Rome', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Pacific', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story-type', 'unexpectedness', 'writers', 'True', 'Detective', 'knew', 'was', 'still', 'crazy', 'unexpected', 'storytelling', 'left', 'good', 'old', 'Homicide', 'multi-layered', 'narrative', 'technique', 'together', 'events', 'surrounding', 'murder', 'investigation', 'mid-90', 'present-day', 'interviews', 'two', 'investigating', 'detectives', 'played', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'conducted', 'two', 'younger', 'detectives', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'past', 'events', 'reasons', 'are', 'unwilling', 'share', 'Harrelson', 'McConaughey', 'give', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'McConaughey', 'standout', 'role', ""'Rust"", 'Cohle', 'former', 'deep-undercover', 'agent', 'blood', 'hands', 'Looking', 'gaunt', 'slightly', 'emaciated', 'likely', 'related', 'weight-cut', 'endured', 'play', 'AIDS-sufferer', ""'The"", 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'perfectly', 'Cohle', 'monk-like', 'psychic', 'self-flagellation', 'hollowed-out', 'features', 'contribute', 'haunted', 'thousand-yard-stare', 'numbness', 'emptiness', 'character', 'traded', 'agony', 'would', 'consume', 'allowed', 'feel', 'also', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'failed', 'marriage', 'haunting', 'various', 'opiates', 'benzodiazepines', 'compelled', 'bombard', 'partner', 'anyone', 'else', 'own', 'acidic', 'brand', 'existential', 'nihilism', 'when', 'compelled', 'speak', 'course', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'well', 'brothers', 'blue', 'partner', 'Marty', 'Hart', 'played', 'Harrelson', 'forced', 'defend', 'cop', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hart', 'family', 'man', 'loving', 'wife', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'side', 'situation', 'threatening', 'blow', 'up', 'face', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'deeper', 'investigation', 'young', 'woman', 'murdered', 'manner', 'pagan', 'ritual', 'Lovecraftian', 'themes', 'recurring', 'symbols', 'Hart', 'appreciate', 'Cohle', 'gifts', 'detective', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'develop', 'everything', 'straight', 'hell', 'only', 'when', 'tale', 'back', 'present', 'kind', 'resolution', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'writing', 'Nic', 'Pizzolatto', 'direction', 'Cary', 'Fukunaga', 'brilliant', 'season', 'most', 'shows', 'men', 'handled', 'writing', 'directing', 'duties', 'episode', 'likely', 'helped', 'make', 'clear', 'distinctive', 'vision', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'next', 'season', 'close', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'one', 'did']",True Detective

It was enough to make you want to do him harm!

A girl's body has been found in the Louisiana cane fields, bound, with heavy religious and occult overtones.  The two detectives don't necessarily get along; Cohle is a borderline suicidal nihilist, and Hart is arrogant and a hypocrite.  But the two pair together to hunt their man.  Seventeen years later, another body is found, and Cohle and Hart are forced to relive the case, and the tangled mess that was their partnership.TRUE DETECTIVE is a truly brilliant show.  It starts with the performances: McConaughey is a stunner (this performance is among the highlight reel of his career comeback), and Harrelson slow-burns his way through his characters complexities.  Of the supporting cast, Michelle Monaghan shines as Hart's wife, and it's always nice to see Shea Whigham pop up (here as a revivalist).  But the performances wouldn't mean much if not for the script and directing--both the same for all eight episodes, which helps the story seem complete and unstilted, even as we jump back and forth between through the years.  Through it all, the setting of rural Louisiana comes through like a third leading man, helping this show cement itself in reality, even as the final couple of episodes pile the facts into a vaguely confusing bundle.  This first season of TRUE DETECTIVE (which stands on its own; I like to think of it as an eight-hour movie) may go down as a classic television experience.

1692144,A1ERUWNYZ93NRR,B00HUCF420,"Della Van Hise ""Quantum Shaman, Eye Scry Publ...","[2, 2]","When you've gotten spoiled to exemplary writing such as BREAKING BAD, just about everything else comes as a disappointment.  So I was pleasantly surprised - blown away, actually! - when TRUE DETECTIVE turned out to be such an unrelenting look at the dark side of the human heart - not just with regard to the monsters who commit unspeakable crimes, but with equal regard to the men who investigate those crimes and run the high risk of becoming as lost and damaged as the fiends they are determined to bring to justice.  When the line between the good guys and the bad guys is allowed to blur is when a series goes above and beyond the mundane who-dunnit scripts and takes the viewer on a journey where good and evil become more a matter of perception than comfortable certainty.Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey seemed to actively BECOME the characters they played until TRUE DETECTIVE often felt more like watching an intimate documentary as opposed to a fictional mini-series.  Both the acting and the writing were top-notch, and if this HBO series doesn't win some Emmys, something's wrong.  The story itself involves a complex murder scene, missing women and children spanning at least 2 decades, and potential involvement of high ranking state officials.  All of this takes place in the grim habitat of the Louisiana bayous, where one never knows if the missing were taken by gators or voudon practitioners using the victims as human sacrifices.While there is certainly intrigue and tension surrounding the crimes themselves, some of the most notable conflict is between the two main characters - Rust Cohle and Martin Hart (McConaughey and Harrelson).  Whereas Hart is more savvy and at times even defensive of the beliefs and practices of the bayou people, Cohle is one step short of a devout quantum atheist - and the tension between the two characters as a result of their divergent beliefs and backgrounds in what gives the show some of its best moments.(Spoiler alert) Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes in the show for me was after the two detectives have killed a couple of the bad guys and rescued a young girl who had been brutally abused from the killers' compound.  Cohle says to Hart:  &#34;I don't want to know anything anymore. This is a world where nothing is solved. Someone once told me, 'Time is a flat circle.' Everything we've ever done or will do, we're gonna do over and over and over again. And that little boy and that little girl, they're gonna be in that room again and again and again forever.&#34;(End spoiler alert)From a perspective of quantum mechanics and quantum consciousness, Cohle's horrendously dark statement is true - at least in theory.  If the universe expands and contracts, breathing in and breathing out, the theory is that we live these same lives over and over, even if billions upon billions of years apart.  So to Cohle's way of thinking as he is &#34;mainlining the truth of the universe&#34; (a conclusion he has come to in his own dark evolution), even though he has rescued the little girl in the now, she will be in that room to experience that same fate again... and again... because in another of Cohle's observations, &#34;Death created time to grow the things that it would kill.&#34;Even though the series is only 8 episodes, it felt complete and whole.  The story is concluded at the end, and the viewer isn't left wanting more - except for wanting more television to reflect this depth of writing, directing, production values and acting.  Another thing that bears mention is the music - particularly the opening theme song, performed by Brett & Rennie Sparks (The Handsome Family).  The song is eerie and haunting just through its sound, but when you dig into the lyrics, you'll find it every bit as uncompromising as the show itself.Ultimately, TRUE DETECTIVE isn't for the squeamish or for someone just looking for yet another police procedural.  This show goes where others have TRIED to go and flailed.  The ending is no less profound than some of the unforgettable quotes by Cohle which really define the series as the darker side of darkness.See it!  And be prepared to be haunted by the mood and flavor long after the final credits have rolled.",5,The Darker Side of Darkness,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,4231,"['When', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'spoiled', 'exemplary', 'writing', 'such', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'disappointment', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'blown', 'away', 'actually', 'when', 'TRUE', 'DETECTIVE', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'unrelenting', 'look', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'heart', 'not', 'just', 'regard', 'monsters', 'who', 'commit', 'unspeakable', 'crimes', 'equal', 'regard', 'men', 'who', 'investigate', 'crimes', 'run', 'high', 'risk', 'becoming', 'lost', 'damaged', 'fiends', 'are', 'determined', 'bring', 'justice', 'When', 'line', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'allowed', 'blur', 'when', 'series', 'mundane', 'who-dunnit', 'scripts', 'viewer', 'journey', 'where', 'good', 'evil', 'become', 'more', 'matter', 'perception', 'comfortable', 'certainty.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'seemed', 'actively', 'BECOME', 'characters', 'played', 'TRUE', 'DETECTIVE', 'often', 'felt', 'more', 'watching', 'intimate', 'documentary', 'opposed', 'fictional', 'mini-series', 'acting', 'writing', 'were', 'top-notch', 'HBO', 'series', ""n't"", 'win', 'Emmys', 'something', 'wrong', 'story', 'complex', 'murder', 'scene', 'missing', 'women', 'children', 'spanning', 'least', '2', 'decades', 'potential', 'involvement', 'high', 'ranking', 'state', 'officials', 'place', 'grim', 'habitat', 'Louisiana', 'bayous', 'where', 'one', 'never', 'missing', 'were', 'taken', 'gators', 'voudon', 'practitioners', 'using', 'victims', 'human', 'sacrifices.While', 'certainly', 'intrigue', 'tension', 'surrounding', 'crimes', 'most', 'notable', 'conflict', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Rust', 'Cohle', 'Martin', 'Hart', 'McConaughey', 'Harrelson', 'Whereas', 'Hart', 'more', 'savvy', 'times', 'even', 'defensive', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'bayou', 'people', 'Cohle', 'one', 'step', 'short', 'devout', 'quantum', 'atheist', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'result', 'divergent', 'beliefs', 'backgrounds', 'show', 'best', 'moments', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'show', 'was', 'two', 'detectives', 'have', 'killed', 'couple', 'bad', 'guys', 'rescued', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'brutally', 'abused', 'killers', 'compound', 'Cohle', 'Hart', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'anymore', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', 'solved', 'Someone', 'once', 'told', 'flat', 'circle', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'will', 'do', ""'re"", 'gon', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'little', 'boy', 'little', 'girl', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'room', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'forever.', '34', 'End', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'perspective', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'quantum', 'consciousness', 'Cohle', 'horrendously', 'dark', 'statement', 'true', 'least', 'theory', 'universe', 'expands', 'contracts', 'breathing', 'breathing', 'out', 'theory', 'live', 'same', 'even', 'billions', 'billions', 'years', 'apart', 'So', 'Cohle', 'way', 'thinking', '34', 'mainlining', 'truth', 'universe', '34', 'conclusion', 'come', 'own', 'dark', 'evolution', 'even', 'rescued', 'little', 'girl', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'room', 'experience', 'same', 'fate', 'again', 'again', 'Cohle', 'observations', '34', 'Death', 'created', 'time', 'grow', 'things', 'would', 'kill.', '34', 'Even', 'series', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'felt', 'complete', 'whole', 'story', 'concluded', 'end', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'wanting', 'more', 'television', 'reflect', 'depth', 'writing', 'directing', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'thing', 'mention', 'music', 'particularly', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'performed', 'Brett', 'Rennie', 'Sparks', 'Handsome', 'Family', 'song', 'eerie', 'haunting', 'just', 'sound', 'when', 'dig', 'lyrics', ""'ll"", 'find', 'bit', 'as', 'uncompromising', 'show', 'itself.Ultimately', 'TRUE', 'DETECTIVE', ""n't"", 'squeamish', 'someone', 'just', 'looking', 'yet', 'police', 'procedural', 'show', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'TRIED', 'go', 'flailed', 'ending', 'less', 'profound', 'unforgettable', 'quotes', 'Cohle', 'really', 'series', 'darker', 'side', 'darkness.See', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'haunted', 'mood', 'flavor', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled']",True Detective

I was expecting a deep character study, and we do get that, but the problem is that the characters are too clich&eacute;...two burned out detectives who are damaged goods (one of whom is constantly spouting ridiculous philosophies that eventually become kind of a joke and detract from the show's seriousness).  And a villain I won't describe, to avoid spoilers, except to say that in the last episode, over-the-top suspense movies like ""Seven"" come to mind.  As the plot unfolds and becomes more and more absurd, it loses a little of the magic of its first few episodes.Does all of this mean that I didn't like it?  Nope.  It's massively entertaining.  The last episode was disappointing, only because it's so incredibly unbelievable, but as a thriller, the storytelling is solid and it never failed to keep my attention.  It just wasn't what I expected.  I had hoped for a little more TRUTH from the true detectives, some gritty realism rather than falling back on Hollywood conventions of not-of-this-earth characters and excessive plot-twistery.

I caught the last two episodes on HBO and became fascinated, but couldn't quite put together the storyline. When I saw that Amazon had the whole season, I purchased it right away and settled down for a marathon. McConaughey-such a wonderful actor who has apparently finally reached his prime-plays an intensely introspective, philosophical, darkly sexy detective who is caught up by his own demons--which appear to be connected to the killing(s) he and his partner are investigating. His partner, Woody Harrelson, who has his own demons-of course-but not being as introspective as McConaughey, and being more of a jerk it appears at first&#8230; He therefore manages to plod his way through life ignoring the damage he's doing and blaming others for it. They rub each other the wrong way while working together very well as they search for a serial killer no one believes exists. This causes them both great personal losses along the way. By the end of the series they've bonded over the losses they've both had, etc.. all to find this sick, depraved serial killer.  All the actors, the writing are fantastic.

Instead, all I can say is that I've been waiting years for something like this. This is one part HBO's the Wire, one part David Fincher's Se7en, and one part 48 Hours Investigates. This show is very adult in nature, content and subject matter due to nudity and dead bodies and drug use.McConaughey (Rust Cohle) and Harrleson (Martin Hart) play Louisiana detectives investigating the trail of dead left behind by a serial killer that ends up spanning 17 years. Any fan of great dramas like HBO's The Wire, AMC's Breaking Bad, and fans of slow burn shows with a very gritty and realistic portrayal of character interaction and events will love this. This is easily the best first episode of a show I think I have ever seen. And the show doesn't slow down after that, it snowballs. I didn't go into the final episode expecting all loose ends to be tied up, or for the good guys to win over the bad guys. All I expected was more intensity, edge of your seat suspense and the finale delivered. I'd be surprised to hear if people weren't satisfied with the ending of this season. The finale did a great job of bringing everything full circle, while managing to tie up most loose ends, and ending different than I expected, which is great. Even now, nearly 2 weeks after the finale I still find myself thinking about the case and about the events I witnessed unfold, that's rare.This show is an anthology so each season will have a different cast and a different murder to be investigated. Nic Pizzolatto has written this entire 8 episode first season himself and Cary Joji Fukunaga has directed each of the 8 episodes for this season, which adds to the cohesive feel of the show. I can't recommend this show any higher. This is the kind of show one could watch a few times through and pick up on things they may have missed the first viewing. This is the must watch show of 2014. Although ""time is a flat circle"", this show is not a waste of your time.

1692163,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00HUCF420,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[29, 33]","HBO is no stranger to dark, compelling and beautifully performed television. THE WIRE, DEADWOOD, ROME, THE SOPRANOS, and GAME OF THRONES are the most obvious examples of this. THE WIRE, which I still contend is the best show HBO's ever done, took the procedural cop drama that had permeated network prime-time television and turned it on its head. And that's pretty much the formula for all these great television shows. They all bend their genres from Westerns to Sword-and-Sandal Historical Epics to Mob Stories to Sword-and-Sorcery Fantasy. The latest ""genre"" that has swept television is something I refer to as The Nihilistic Morality Play; basically a show that is so entrenched in thematic and character-based darkness and just barely giving hope to its characters and, by proxy, the viewers only to snatch it away from them and us. Shows like BREAKING BAD, HANNIBAL, THE KILLING, RAY DONOVAN, THE BRIDGE, THE WALKING DEAD, and THE AMERICANS are shows that are excellent examples of this new genre. Don't get me wrong; I love most of these programs, but they are VERY dark. But HBO decided to jump in to the deepest end of this darkness with creator Nic Pizzolato's TRUE DETECTIVE, a rural drama/thriller/philosophical treatise that doesn't just exist in darkness but in most cases, is consumed by it.The plot and the mystery of TRUE DETECTIVE's narrative are almost inconsequential when it comes to the characters the show focuses around, which are Louisiana State Police Detectives Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrleson). We meet them at two different stages of their lives; first in 1995 when the two detectives are paired up to investigate a murder with seeming occultist ties and then in 2012, long after they've parted ways and ""solved"" the murder. While the murder investigation does generate enough suspense and drama to power two longer and more acceptable network procedurals, again, when you look at the characters of Cohle and Hart, you see the generators that power the show. You might think that The Yellow King's identity is incredibly important, but it isn't. You might think the fate of Billy Lee Tuttle is incredibly important, but again, it isn't. The mystery, like the masterful first season of David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS, isn't so much the driving force but rather a catalyzing agent that bonds the characters together.Rust and Marty are incredibly damamged people (and in some ways, incredibly unlikable), and there is an instant and somewhat intense dislike of one another that never goes away in the early parts of their partnership. Rust lost his young daughter which caused his wife to leave as well, which has so deadened his mind to ideas of love and relationships and life in general that he purely focuses on the analytical, no matter the dark places his logic takes him. Marty is damaged also, but in a different way. He believes that his world revolves solely around him so that he can do anything he wants with little to no thought of the consequences, and this not only ruins his own life but that of his wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) as well. But the idea that the show does really explore is that no matter the animosity Rust and Marty share for one another, there is a brotherhood between them that their beliefs, their actions, and their dissonant personalities cannot break. It goes beyond trust, respect and love. It's as if they are two halves of the same person that when together can possibly be made whole, which is punctuated very specifically in the finale.Another thing that breaks clean from the genre it inhabits is its glimpses at these men in two different times. Most programs that deal with time differentials tend to cheat their audience by intercutting the present with the past in order to get to the present more quickly, but Pizzolato is smart enough to know that the audience for a show like this refuses to be cheated. It allows the past and the present to build logically and organically without haste, which is something that very few shows of this type, if any, allow for.If I had a complaint about the show, it's the treatment of the female characters; they don't necessarily seem fully fleshed-out and three dimensional, but instead seem to be more reflective of the id, ego and superego (respectively) of the two leads. They're not there just to give motivation or to be plot points either, but rather exist in the ether between the relationship of these two men. It's not so much a criticism, because the show isn't trying to examine gender roles, but rather to explore the character of who Marty and Rust are.From a technical standpoint, the show is a dreamland of simplistic visual wizardry. Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed all eight episodes, is a master visual storyteller. There isn't a shot or angle that seems decorative or meaningless. Of course, the one scene that still has viewers reeling and examining that displays his know-how and his pacing genius is the single-take scene at the end of Episode 4, which rivals that of the single-shot takes that made Alfonso Cuaron an Oscar winner. From a storytelling standpoint, Pizzolato, who wrote all the episodes, really knows how to pace a scene and his dialogue has a rich flow that also never really seems false. The show also has the added benefit of the legendary T-Bone Burnett being the music supervisor of this show. It adds a necessary rural flavor to the show that makes it that much more excellent.Then, there are the performances. It's extremely likely that both Harrleson and McConaughey will be vying for Best Actor when the Emmys and Golden Globes come around in 2014. Respectively, this is each actor's best work to date. McConaughey has been slowly lifting himself out of the dregs of the rom-com hell he seemed to be consigned to, to becoming one of the great actors of our time, with his work in films like KILLER JOE, MUD, THE LINCOLN LAWYER and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. But his work as Rust Cohle is a punctuation mark on that statement. Harrleson has been defying his initial career definition as the brainless good-ol'-boy from CHEERS since his work in films like NATURAL BORN KILLERS, WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, and more recently in smaller indies like RAMPART and HBO's GAME CHANGE, and while he gave excellent performances in those films, he has never given a performance that's so well-rounded and utterly immersive as his interpretation of Marty. Monaghan is also excellent, even if I personally felt that she was a little underused.One of the things that will keep bringing people back to TRUE DETECTIVE is not necessarily the mystery, although it is a mighty one, or the plots, but the way that this show is so expertly constructed and so compelling. This is a no-brainer as far as the best new show on television, and it deserves every praise that people can heap onto it.",5,"""And like all dreams, there's a monster at the end of

We keep the other bad men from the door.&#34;- Detective Rust Cohle.After the demise of Walt in &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; I really needed a new fix. Nothing could fill the void after that superb series ended.Then I found this.This is an often dark and brooding series. It does not have some of the black humour of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;. Set in the Deep South in Louisiana, the stagnant waters of the bayou hint at a moral decay and long buried crimes. The opening theme music is haunting. It gets under your skin and stays in your head for days.The series co-stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. It is a thoughtful pairing. They play two detectives working on a case that begins in 1995. Both deliver unforgettable performances. Indeed it is really the dynamic interaction between this pair that makes the series so watchable.Detective Rust Cohle, played by McConaughey, is the weird but fiercely intelligent driver of the main investigation. He lives and breathes the case. Detective Marty Hart, a Southern Good ol' Boy, is his partner. Despite appearing the upstanding family man, Hart also has some character flaws of his own to contend with.The two detectives begin with an investigation of what appears to be a ritualistic murder of former prostitute Dora Kelly Lange. The corpse, found in the woods, is crowned with deer antlers. It has a strange spiral symbol painted on its back. Sickos in the woods.Detective Cohle is convinced that there is more to this case than meets the eye. He can never really let it go.Of course Matthew McConaughey gives a great performance as the alcoholic Cohle. That goes without saying. But I enjoyed Harrelson's more measured performance even more. This acting duo complement each other very nicely.This Season One has just 8 episodes. It would have been great to have double that amount.Word is that the writer Nic Pizzolato is already at work on Season Two.

The previous 7 episodes of True Detective are alive and brave, but the finale is used Dentyne (the ""hero"" Marty Hart is saved just in the nick of time, and than the other hero Russ Cohle is saved by the police who inexplicably show up). I can forgive some missteps in the middle of anything, but you can't have a poor ending - it stains everything. If the writers needed to have Rust have this big conversion towards meaning, fine, have him survive and give his soliloquy to Marty's ex-wife. This would serve to comfort her and redeem Rust to himself. There was no need for Marty to live. Marty could have been shown calling the police and therefore saving Rust's life.

That is all I will say of the plot, there have been plenty of revelations and surprises. Mconaughey is a dark and twisted loner with an almost prescient way of reading a crime scene. His acting skills are at the fore playing this man at two extremes, between now and then, he is almost unrecognizable, such is the metamorphosis. Harrelson plays the more conventional of the two, a solid family man, but we soon find out he is battling his own demons. There are plenty of great supporting characters but it is these two actors who make eerie retelling of murder in Southern Louisiana come to life.

1692185,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B00HUCF420,Kurt Russell,"[3, 3]","There are many things to love about this show, but its best quality is its bleak but brainy weirdness. The pair of mismatched cops is a very familiar format for a mystery/action/thriller story, and this show is not immune to using numerous clich&eacute;s throughout its telling. But there is a very unique and special tone for which the story strives and nails. Between one protagonist's sour nihilism to the murders' bizarre and occult fiendishness, this series does a superb job of creating a spectacularly grim and gloomy world for this case, a version of rural Louisiana that is both kooky and spooky.This show is exceptionally intelligent too. Heady mysticism, heavy philosophies, sinister takes on religion and self, even discussions of space-time quantum theory - there are many deep layers which permeate the procedural, and they are all a real joy to engage with and muse over. With its labyrinthine structure of flashbacks within flashbacks, and a story which unfolds across decades, this series certainly aims high with its ambitions to deliver something far more than just good guys vs. bad guys. With so many of the characters' motives and intentions murkily shaded in gray, part of the fun is unraveling for whom to cheer and how.As an HBO program, the show fulfills its requisite amounts of violence, gore, nudity, language and sex. But as an HBO show, all of the acting and production is superb, from its wonderful score and soundtrack, to its sublime cinematography and dark visual effects. Both McConaughey and Harrelson have never been finer in their portrayals of their complex and contentious sleuths.Based on the online reaction to the finale/aftermath of this show, I'd say the ONLY people who didn't enjoy it were the ones who thought they had outsmarted everyone by deciphering the mystery, and were then disappointed when it did not meet their expectations of how the show &#34;should&#34; have ended.

Rust is a solitary nihilist while Marty is a family man and a  believing Christian. Predictably, for Hollywood types,Rust is man of unflinching integrity while Marty is a moral hypocrite with intermittent good guy moments. These two men are assigned to the ritual sex murder of a young girl in Louisiana. The local Christians are depicted as either poor, ignorant and debased or rich, corrupt, and depraved. Much of the dialogue is taken up with Rust's pompous drivel accompanied by his surreal ability to read people and get information.Harrelson's acting in this series is terrible. He was great in comedies such as Cheers and Will and Grace as well as dramas such as The Walker. He can act-but not in this mess.You can almost see him choking back laughter when he is supposedly violently angry. Also his character is supposed to be under age 30 when the story begins and he looks over 50 which is in fact his real age. Mcconaughey is fine as Harrelson's suffering, driven partner but his talent isn't enough to cover the deficiencies of the series.The ending is absurd as well as a philosophical cop-out given everything which has previously occurred.(I won't be more specific in order not to spoil it for those who want to invest in the series.)The plot revolves around an interesting idea: Rust and Marty solve the original murder. Many years later similar crimes occur which leads a new team of detectives to suspect Cohle mislead Marty on the original case and that Cohle, himself, is the perpetrator.

The corruption of the landscape mirrors the corruption that is taking place behind the scenes of  normative life which most people  believe constitutes their reality.A ritual killing with overtones of paganism [voodun and Celtic] sets two detectives on a seventeen year  trajectory which will profoundly alter their lives and shake them to the core of their being. Martin Hart [ Harrelson] is the sort of well liked, affable family man who is grounded in tradition and community, and yet manages to jeopardize everything he values with his penchant for womanizing. Rustin Cohle [ McConaughy ] is a nihilist, divorced from human contact, who finds existence utterly devoid of meaning and believes in nothing. And yet he manages to expound on the human condition  so poetically that one immediately suspects he has suffered a great wound.The action takes place during three different time periods and focuses as much on the men's lives and driving motivations  as the crime&#8212;which develops in scope and involves many persons in the coastal region.Both characters are beautifully developed and each has something profoundly different lurking below the surface of the face they present to themselves and the world, which will come to expression in the course of the series.

This 8-episodes dark-crime/mystery/thriller-drama has something for everyone.It is difficult, really difficult for me to find the right words to describe and in some way even suggest to try to see this series once you get an opportunity, but if you can--I highly advice not to hesitate, because it is totally worth anybody's time.  I was so into it, that after watching the first episode I decided to finish the entire first season in just one morning.  This dark-mystery southern gothic pulls in and it does not let go until the last episode is finished.  Honestly, I did not want this series to end--- it was that good.I guess, the only comparison that comes to my mind is film Zodiac (2007), the trilogy of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), and the TV series Twin Peaks (1990) all mashed together into one.  Furthermore, what makes this series stand out from other TV series nowadays, is that it is about real people with real problems, the two main characters (played by Harrelson and McConaughey) are very real, so real that many of the viewers will probably identify with them.  The music used in this series is just perfect, it has the southern-belt feel to, it can be creepy, uplifting and anything in-between.  Also worth mentioning is the interesting concept of plot which is comprised of two layers, the story is told by both detectives in the current times (year 2012) and it is based on their most important case involving ritualistic murders of young women by a psychotic killer/killers that take place in the mid 1990's.  I do not wish to spoil this series any further, so I will not reveal anything more about the plot...I can not wait to see season two, directed by other film-directors with new cast members.

1692194,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00HUCF420,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Movies have changed over the years. In their earliest form they depicted the hero as a rough and ready customer who was out to save the world or at least some portion of it. When censorship rules eased up we suddenly had the anti-hero, a person who was flawed to a large extent but who did the right thing in the end, sometimes unwillingly for the right reasons. It seems that these days we have a combination of the two making its way into movies. Such is the case with TRUE DETECTIVE.TRUE DETECTIVE is a new series on HBO and has just been released on DVD. Word has it that the series will continue with a different story to tell using new characters each season. That bodes well for viewers since it allows some great actors to make their way into stories that take more than 2 hours to tell and gives them free rein to do their best. That happens here with both Woody Harrelson and Mathew McConaughey.The duo star as Louisiana State Police detectives called in to investigate strange murder. The body of a young woman has been found tied to a tree in the middle of a field, a crown made of antlers on her head, stab wound to her body and strangled. Around the body are tripod type sculptures made of twigs giving it the appearance of a satanic ritual. While the murder forms the center piece of the series, it isn't exactly what the show is about. It's more about the two detectives investigating the murder as well as others that tie into it.The tale unfolds jumping back and forth in time, from the initial investigation in the late 1990s to a new investigation taking place in 2012. Both Det. Marty Hart (Harrelson) and Det. Rusty Cohle are being interrogated by two current State Police detectives but we have no idea why. These two men are far different than the ones who did the initial investigation. Marty now owns a security company and Rusty, well, no one knows where he's been. As the new detectives question them and get their stories, we learn what happened. By episode five all of that changes and suddenly we're caught up and trying to find out just how much was real and why things went the way they did.Marty is a pretty straight forward type detective. He covers the scene, looks for clues and runs the evidence with the hope of catching the killer. We get glimpses of Marty as a stand up family man who in reality has a girlfriend on the side. He loves his family and yet finds himself often arguing with his wife instead of being there for them. This is the flawed hero, a man who wants to do what is right yet continues to make mistakes that affect all around him.Rusty handles things in a more unusual way. Prone to offering philosophic quotes and metaphysical observations on the world, he views things his own way. We get the idea that this stems from his years as an undercover agent investigating drug rings which led to usage of their product. But it's not just that. There is much more to Rusty than drugs or alcohol. His family past is troubled to say the least and the time undercover did take its toll. But Rusty is the one of the pair that truly wants to find the truth. His search for the truth is what pushes them forward in the past and in the present.The film depicts the boys of the south as both sophisticated in some instances and backwoods yokels at other times. Neither one is condescending to the south and appears to represent the various extremes of one end to the other well. There are people that fit both of these types. The thing is discovering which ones are the truly terrible and which are honest. Don't be surprised to find that members of both classes fit both good and bad.The thing that makes this series work though is a combination of elements that blend together to perfection. The work of both leads is fantastic with an unwrapping of layer after layer of their personalities that gives us a glimpse into who they are. Those glimpses give us a depth of character that a 2 hour film would not allow. Both actors are up to the task and turn in great performances.The direction and storytelling are above par as well. The story unfolds in time, moving along at a snails pace but never feeling like it is. Instead it allows the story to percolate to a boil by the end episode. We get a few clues here and there that allow us to perhaps figure out the result, but never so intrusive as to harm the story being told. And in a world where there are not always black and white heroes and villains, this movie offers us a chance to see those grays come into focus to give us those two distinct colors (or lack of) when depicting the detectives and the killer. No poor victim murderer is found here. Instead there is pure evil. The way that is put together here makes for a great series.Not having HBO this makes me look forward to their next season and its release on DVD. Perhaps it's better to watch something like this binge fashion where you get the opportunity to watch from start to finish. If you wondered, yes it does include the usual requirement for a made for pay cable series i.e. gratuitous nudity. But if you can get past that you're in for a treat when watching this, if for nothing else than the performance of both lead actors.

True Detective is like watching a mystery or suspense thriller/movie without having to wait years for the sequel.  For a TV series, I usually wait for reviews to come out to watch a show, because there are just so many nowadays.  This 8-hour TV Show/movie grips you from the first episode and makes you want to spend the whole day just watching it.  It is a story about two detectives who come together to solve a grisly seemingly ritual serial (believed to be) murder in the Bayous of Louisiana.  It spans several different timelines as we see how the particular case affects these two detectives working on the case, and in their lives as well.  So many smart lines about life in general, delivered perfectly and brilliantly by McConaughey and Harrelson.  Monsters at the end of dreams, life being a neverending circle, life not ending after death, the comparisons between lightness and darkness in people and life, family, drug abuse, cycle of family actions and reactions, cause and effect, religion, politics, poverty, etc.  The cinematography also is excellent.  My husband and I are Criminal Minds fans, and this was very reminiscent of that show, only one story is wrapped up in 8 episodes and spans the time sequence of 17 years.  I am going to have to watch it again with him.  When we finally get to see the killer's world, reminiscent of a Stephen King/or his son Joe Hill villain.

A dark, brooding drama that is told from two perspectives, and we don't know who is telling the real truth or if there is, indeed, a real truth.Matthew McConaughey, who is riding a high with his Golden Globes award for best actor and Oscar nomination, plays a man like no other, and Woody Harrelson, an actor who has it made. Their combination is one of the best we have seen since, well, yes, 'Breaking Bad'. True Detective tells the story of two Louisiana State Police detectives: Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey and Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, who are investigating the gruesome murder of a former prostitute.The story moves between 1995 and 2012. Cohle and Hart find themselves being interviewed by new investigators who have a new murder very similar to the 1995 murder. These interviews reveal a great deal about both men. In-between the interviews we go with the detectives on their case in 1995. It is a creepy, awful murder, and we go with them through the bayous of Louisiana. We also meet Hart's family, and begin to learn the unsettling truth of his life, and the lies he tells. Cohle, is a thin man, ex-addict and now an alcoholic with a deeply disturbing background. Both of these men see their own truths, and, we are observing them to glean some hint of the world they inhabit. The ending wax superb, and totally fitting for the series.This is a series that draws us in, once again. The difference in this series is that at the end of this year, it is the finish. Next year, a new story with new actors. How to flow Mc Conaughey and Harrelson, I have no idea.Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-26-14",4,Fascinating and Uncomfortable,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1708,"['Lots', 'kudos', 'are', 'written', 'new', 'series', 'everyone', 'dark', 'brooding', 'drama', 'told', 'two', 'perspectives', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'telling', 'real', 'truth', 'indeed', 'real', 'truth.Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'riding', 'high', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'man', 'other', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'actor', 'who', 'made', 'combination', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'yes', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'True', 'Detective', 'story', 'two', 'Louisiana', 'State', 'Police', 'detectives', 'Rust', 'Cohle', 'played', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Martin', 'Hart', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'former', 'prostitute.The', 'story', 'moves', '1995', '2012', 'Cohle', 'Hart', 'find', 'being', 'interviewed', 'new', 'investigators', 'who', 'have', 'new', 'murder', 'very', 'similar', '1995', 'murder', 'interviews', 'reveal', 'great', 'deal', 'men', 'In-between', 'interviews', 'go', 'detectives', 'case', '1995', 'creepy', 'awful', 'murder', 'go', 'bayous', 'Louisiana', 'also', 'meet', 'Hart', 'family', 'begin', 'learn', 'unsettling', 'truth', 'life', 'lies', 'Cohle', 'thin', 'man', 'ex-addict', 'now', 'alcoholic', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'background', 'men', 'see', 'own', 'truths', 'are', 'observing', 'glean', 'hint', 'world', 'inhabit', 'ending', 'wax', 'superb', 'totally', 'fitting', 'series.This', 'series', 'once', 'again', 'difference', 'series', 'end', 'year', 'finish', 'Next', 'year', 'new', 'story', 'new', 'actors', 'How', 'flow', 'Mc', 'Conaughey', 'Harrelson', 'have', 'idea.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-26-14']",True Detective

Scene reviews, and come on McConaughey and Harrelson are entertaining, so they enhance everything they are involved in.

It starts with two polar opposite cops that are partnered up to solve a high profile case with one being a family man (Marty) and the other a loaner (Rust) that not only struggle with solving the case , but with each others ideals, beliefs, logic and so on.This formula works quite well with these two great actors and when you add the very good writing and direction to the mix you have a winner of a show that will keep people glued to their seats watching and waiting to see what will happen next.If you are looking for fast paced non stop action you would be better served elsewhere because this is more of a controlled or slower  paced story.The show is kind of an experiment in that it was told in only eight episodes (more like an extended mini series) and that next season will be set in California with one or two female leads and be based on a different story that will be occult related. I must confess that when I read that next season would return without Rust and Marty that I wondered &#34;Why did I spend my time getting to know these characters when I wouldn't see them again&#34;???  I fell a little betrayed or mislead.This is a good show, but will season two be as effective/good with a different cast and storyline?  Will people return when they find out they have been duped?

1692228,AGRR05FH945HR,B00HUCF420,Steven Cain,"[2, 3]","Overall, I have to concur with those reviewers who agree with the Hype; this is a modern masterpiece, and if it has a weakness, it is in the relatively shallow female characters.Other than that, everything from the stunning cast (all of 'em) to the direction, cinematography, you name it, is top drawer. This is by far one of the most atmospheric productions of any type I have ever seen. I could easily see this building into the cult status of Blade Runner and the original UK version of The Wicker Man, which may have inspired the ritual animal masks etc.I can understand a certain amount of disappointment with the ending, in that the show did not quite unfold as complex a story as it first appeared it would. Clearly, The Yellow King reference was a tip of the hat to the 1895 pre-Lovecraftian collection of short stories by Robert W.Chambers, called The King In Yellow, with its lost city of Carcosa. There is potentially enormous depth to the background story elements and they are not fully explored by the end. Nor are there any conclusions about the child sacrifice cult.In the Chambers saga, the lost city of Carcosa is on a planet with twin suns, which suggests an influence on Lovecraft's Great Old Ones who came from the stars. If the references were to be taken literally rather than metaphorically, this ET connection and the hinted at child sacrifice cult echoes the theme of David Icke's controversial Children of the Matrix, in which he claims that many powerful figures in the world are involved in ritual child sacrifice as part of secret societies which serve alien shape-shifting rulers. Hey, don't shoot the messenger...Many Conspiracy theorists and even some scientists have suggested that since 98% of our 'human' DNA is non-coding or 'Junk DNA', which appears to serve no biological function, this suggests some kind of genetic engineering of Homo Erectus to produce Homo Sapiens. If any such ET cult connection was actually being hinted at in TD, it was not developed or even acknowledged in the finale. Even if we assume the metaphysical slant on the cryptic lines from certain crazy and/or drug addled freaks, the finale only offers the taking down of a hillbilly who was nailing his sister and some vague reference to the public figures going unpunished.Yes, the story leaves a few avenues unexplored, but Life itself is always going to leave some unanswered questions, and the Mystery is what makes it so compelling.""It began in mystery, and it will end in mystery, but what a savage and beautiful country lies in between.""

1692231,A17639YIJLDS1G,B00HUCF420,still searching,"[10, 11]","Being a fan of both gothic literature and crime fiction and a huge admirer of Tim Willocks' and James Lee Burke's novels, principally featuring the latter's New Iberia detective, Dave Robicheaux and his sidekick, Clete Purcell, I eagerly awaited the appearance of HBO's True Detective. Basically it's a `buddy movie', or more accurately, a buddy anthology, since both its protagonists, spectacularly brought to life in this first installment, by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, play homicide cops for the Louisiana State Police.Of course, since detectives work in pairs, it's hard not to make a buddy movie about cops; (one notable recent exception being `Prisoners' featuring Jake Gyllenhaal's, billy no-mates). From, Bodie and Doyle, Starsky and Hutch and Cagney and Lacey right up to the recent crop of Nordic Noir imports, The Killing and The Bridge, the crime element almost always takes backstage, slightly, to the (developing) relationship between the cops. True Detective is no exception and it is the character arc of predominantly, Woody Harrelson's, Detective Marty Hart, which provides the interest here: both cops are damaged, or at least, troubled `lost souls', more obviously so in the case of McConaughy's `Rust' Cohle, whose eccentricities are explained by the fact that `he's from Texas'. So it is that, at first, Detective Hart appears to be the well-balanced, sane, `feet on the ground' type of guy assigned a new, slightly strange, partner from out of state.  However, initially, at least, this relationship is definitely of the `love hate' variety with the love conspicuous by its absence.They're sent to the scene of, what appears to be, a ritual killing and so begins the investigation of the murder of the unfortunate former prostitute, Dora Kelly Lange. And gradually, as the investigation develops we get the impression that all is not right in Marty's life and, just as there is a very dark undercurrent flowing beneath the seeming respectability of the civic life of Vermilion Parish and the wider state scene of Louisiana, so there are features of Marty's domestic and professional situations that don't bear too close a scrutiny. And, progressively, we begin to detect that the apparently most troubled of the two, Cohle, is, in fact, the one whose integrity remains intact as his partner slowly disintegrates under the pressure of being forced to confront both the unsavoury reality of his working life and the values upon which his domestic `relationships' are founded and the conflict within his soul becomes a raging war between the two sides of his personality.Duality/duplicity is a constant thread running through the story; from, for example, Cohle's four years spent as an undercover narcotics cop among an East Texas biker gang and Hart's reprehensible antics, to those of the odious Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle and his family. Even Maggie, Hart's unfortunate wife; a victim of his `extra-curricular activities', decides to use his own methods against him, defiling herself and Cohle in the process. Added to this is the destabilizing effect on Hart of his oldest daughter's emerging sexuality signaling her eventual departure from the family home representing, once again, a breakdown of the family as a unifying principle in his life. Thus, when she is caught in the back of a car with, not one, but  two teenaged boys his instinctive reaction is to hit out  with unthinking violence because, in doing so, he somehow manages to assuage his own guilt at consorting with much younger women, and re-establish the norms of his `social/domestic order'. This partly explains the extremes of Hart's violence whenever he's confronted by his own `indescretions': it is Cohle who holds up to him a mirror from which he can't avert his gaze and which, therefore, must be smashed into non-existence.Another main character, of course, is the mysterious perpetrator, heard (about) but rarely seen and referred to, variously, as the `Green Spaghetti Monster' and the `Yellow King' who inhabits `Carcosa', which seems to be, in the latter case, a direct reference to the late Nineteenth Century writers of `Lovecraftian' type supernatural tales, Robert W. Chambers and Ambrose Bierce, respectively. Check out the cover art from the recent `CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform' edition of Chamber's `The King in Yellow' to see what I mean.But perhaps the most mysterious character of all is the Louisiana countryside; an often bleak, flat seemingly never-ending terrain of impenetrable bayous, swampy inlets, bald-cypresses and oak forests; a terrain that gives shelter to the monster towards which the action propels our two driven detectives, who, in seeking to end its nefarious reign, look to salvage some kind of personal and joint redemption.The whole thing is brilliantly realized: the writing assured, the narrative multilayered, the plot complex, the dialogue rich and authentic and the acting stunning. We've been spoilt by 24, Homeland, The Killing and The Bridge etc. but this is right up there with the very best and the `icing' on this particular cake is the theme song by the Handsome Family that effortlessly evokes the alien nature of the angel-abandoned country through which, with Cohle and Hart, we fearfully tread!And we hear its echoes still - lingering in our dreams.",5,From Gothic to

Dark and philosophical, this show covers so much ground in it's 8 episodes(#4 is my favorite w/the housing project sequence...); you get a healthy dose of sex, odd characters, and beautiful scenery...all of which is mixed in w/something purely evil. And yes, Woody and Matthew CAN act, and this show is just one more example of how well they work in their craft, esp. when given material this. Even the opening credit sequence is amazing; it is honestly hard to find a flaw here, although I wish the last episode was a little stronger in terms of more explanation and connections to certain events and characters. But still the usual inspired writing and fantastic chemistry across the board, both in front of and in back of the camera. A very nice final confrontation sequence too, and it's done well as you are not sure how it's going to play out.Also, the scene where Rust is interrogating the girl about her killing her baby, and then after listing a variety of reasons, tells her 'if she gets the chance she should kill herself' before walking out of the room, is pretty 'holy s***' writing and unlike anything I have heard said on any show in a long time; It is much like when he tells the 2 uncooperative men who won't give the detectives directions to a local brothel that 'they got off on the wrong foot' before Russ slams a toolbox against one of the men's heads before beating the other one down(and leaving w/very detailed directions...).For a show that is so graphic, disturbing, and covers seemingly almost every 'immoral' activity we as a race participate in, it is equally--and to some surprisingly--rich in thought-provoking ideas and concepts about life that are both surprisingly fresh, but actually make a lot of sense at times; some of the theories actually seem to make the hardships in life a little easier to cope with, as off-kilter as they may seem at times.I also love how the series has a little bit of a  'Bad Lieutenant' movies and a 'The Salton Sea' feel to it here and there; Russ driving while swigging cough syrup, and hallucinating as he does is what good police work is all about(and not unlike anything you would likely see in the aforementioned films...)It make take 3 or 4 viewings to put it all together in your own way, but I suppose one of the great things about this show; There are several ways things can add up, and it's nice to have a show that gives you a little room to put your own brain to use as far as figuring out what you think is the logical or most viable explanation(s)for what you have just been though; And who knows...one of them may be right!**MY FAVORITE WRITING EXAMPLE: When Matthew's character is talking about the death of his daughter in the interrogation room; he makes the comment(after a long and deep explanation...)that her death saved him from 'the sins of being a father'. When I heard his explanation why he feels this way and why he said what he said, it jaws most powerful; it was something i had never even thought of, and one of the most unique perspectives of anything I have seen on film. Writing like that doesn't come along too often, and there are dozens of moments in this show that will throw you for a loop, and in a good way...**Brilliant show!!",5,Resurrecting A Genre,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3593,"['just', 'one', 'shows', 'along', 'less', 'often', 'should', 'cable', 'dramas', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'getting', 'better', 'years', 'are', 'HBO', 'AMC', 'Even', 'NBC', ""'Hannibal"", 'there', 'show', 'something', 'potentially', 'average', 'terms', 'subject', 'matter', 'character', 'traits', 'upside', 'down', 'good', 'way', 'Dark', 'philosophical', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'ground', '8', 'episodes', '4', 'favorite', 'w/the', 'housing', 'project', 'sequence', 'get', 'healthy', 'dose', 'sex', 'odd', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'mixed', 'w/something', 'purely', 'evil', 'yes', 'Woody', 'Matthew', 'CAN', 'act', 'show', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'how', 'well', 'work', 'craft', 'esp', 'when', 'given', 'material', 'Even', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'amazing', 'honestly', 'hard', 'find', 'flaw', 'here', 'wish', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'little', 'stronger', 'terms', 'more', 'explanation', 'connections', 'certain', 'events', 'characters', 'still', 'usual', 'inspired', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'board', 'front', 'back', 'camera', 'very', 'nice', 'final', 'confrontation', 'sequence', 'too', 'done', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out.Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Rust', 'interrogating', 'girl', 'killing', 'baby', 'then', 'listing', 'variety', 'reasons', ""'if"", 'chance', 'should', 'kill', 'walking', 'room', 'pretty', ""'holy"", 's***', 'writing', 'anything', 'have', 'heard', 'said', 'show', 'long', 'time', 'much', 'when', '2', 'uncooperative', 'men', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'detectives', 'directions', 'local', 'brothel', 'got', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'Russ', 'slams', 'toolbox', 'one', 'men', 'heads', 'beating', 'other', 'one', 'down', 'leaving', 'w/very', 'detailed', 'directions', '.For', 'show', 'so', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'covers', 'seemingly', 'almost', ""'immoral"", 'activity', 'race', 'participate', 'equally', 'surprisingly', 'rich', 'thought-provoking', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'life', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'actually', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'times', 'theories', 'actually', 'seem', 'make', 'hardships', 'life', 'little', 'easier', 'cope', 'as', 'off-kilter', 'may', 'seem', 'times.I', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'series', 'little', 'bit', ""'Bad"", 'Lieutenant', 'movies', ""'The"", 'Salton', 'Sea', 'feel', 'here', 'there', 'Russ', 'driving', 'swigging', 'cough', 'syrup', 'hallucinating', 'what', 'good', 'police', 'work', 'not', 'anything', 'would', 'likely', 'see', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'make', 'take', '3', '4', 'viewings', 'put', 'together', 'own', 'way', 'suppose', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'several', 'ways', 'things', 'can', 'add', 'up', 'nice', 'have', 'show', 'little', 'room', 'put', 'own', 'brain', 'use', 'as', 'far', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'think', 'logical', 'most', 'viable', 'explanation', 's', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'though', 'who', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'right', '**MY', 'FAVORITE', 'WRITING', 'EXAMPLE', 'When', 'Matthew', 'character', 'talking', 'death', 'daughter', 'interrogation', 'room', 'comment', 'long', 'deep', 'explanation', 'death', 'saved', 'sins', 'being', 'father', 'When', 'heard', 'explanation', 'why', 'way', 'why', 'said', 'what', 'said', 'most', 'powerful', 'was', 'something', 'i', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'thought', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'perspectives', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Writing', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'dozens', 'moments', 'show', 'will', 'throw', 'loop', 'good', 'way', '**Brilliant', 'show']",True Detective

1692236,A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B00HUCF420,"Terrence A. ""cinemaparker@twitter""","[4, 4]","First off, I'd just like to say that the show itself looks and sounds absolutely amazing on Blu-Ray. I remember watching the first episode when it originally aired and thinking to myself, ""Yeah, I'm going to get this when it releases."" I'm glad I did. The visuals are first class, flawless work. Seriously, the transfer is simply perfect. The DTS-MA track is equally impressive, enveloping you in the sounds of the bayou and the thick atmosphere of rural Louisiana. I have absolutely no complaints about how they handled the audio and video of the show itself in this set. It's literally pitch perfect and I'm so impressed with it that I simply can't help but gush over it repeatedly.With that being said, the extras kind of left me a little disappointed. Most of what's here are fluff pieces that aired on HBO already, tidbits that really just cover the episodes in a way that doesn't add much more to what you've already seen. There are small synopses for each episode, a brief making-of, an interview with T-Bone Burnett and Nic Pizzolato that didn't cover the musical aspect of the show in as much detail as I would have liked, two episode commentaries, two deleted scenes (the deleted scene that comes out of episode 8 is actually my favorite extra on this set and one that I recommend you watch; it's really nothing more than just a moody montage of scenery and music but it's the one extra on the set that captures the heart and soul of True Detective), interviews with stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey and that's really about it.Again, the audio/video portion of True Detective is nothing less than phenomenal. I was hoping for something a little more concise in terms of extras. That's not to say that what's here isn't worth watching but the show was so good that it just deserved a really nice, feature packed edition that delved even deeper into the dangerous world that Nic Pizzolato and Cary Fukunaga had created and bestowed upon its unsuspecting audience.Very much worth picking up so long as you're not expecting a true special edition.",4,Phenomenal show gets a slightly better than average presentation on Blu Ray,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,2066,"['First', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'say', 'show', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Blu-Ray', 'remember', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'when', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'visuals', 'are', 'first', 'class', 'flawless', 'work', 'Seriously', 'transfer', 'simply', 'perfect', 'DTS-MA', 'track', 'equally', 'impressive', 'enveloping', 'sounds', 'bayou', 'thick', 'atmosphere', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'have', 'absolutely', 'complaints', 'how', 'handled', 'audio', 'video', 'show', 'set', 'literally', 'pitch', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'so', 'impressed', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'gush', 'being', 'said', 'extras', 'kind', 'left', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Most', 'what', 'here', 'are', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'aired', 'HBO', 'already', 'tidbits', 'really', 'just', 'cover', 'episodes', 'way', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'are', 'small', 'synopses', 'episode', 'brief', 'making-of', 'interview', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'Nic', 'Pizzolato', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'musical', 'aspect', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'two', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scene', 'episode', '8', 'actually', 'favorite', 'extra', 'set', 'one', 'recommend', 'watch', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'moody', 'montage', 'scenery', 'music', 'one', 'extra', 'set', 'heart', 'soul', 'True', 'Detective', 'interviews', 'stars', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'really', 'about', 'it.Again', 'audio/video', 'portion', 'True', 'Detective', 'nothing', 'less', 'phenomenal', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'concise', 'terms', 'extras', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'here', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'deserved', 'really', 'nice', 'feature', 'packed', 'edition', 'delved', 'even', 'deeper', 'dangerous', 'world', 'Nic', 'Pizzolato', 'Cary', 'Fukunaga', 'had', 'created', 'bestowed', 'unsuspecting', 'audience.Very', 'much', 'picking', 'up', 'so', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'true', 'special', 'edition']",True Detective
