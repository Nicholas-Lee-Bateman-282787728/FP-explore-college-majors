I am not much into Anime, but this one was great. A cross between ""X-men"" and ""The X-Files"" with parts of the old TV show ""The Others"" and CJ Carella's ""Witchcraft"" thrown in for good measure.  A great tale of government conspiracy, occult themes, and witches. What is not to love about all of that?Fifteen year old Robin is the newest hunter to be assigned to Solomon Toukatsu Nin'idantai (Solomon Executive Organization) - Japan, or STN-J.  Robin though  is different. Robin is a craft-user. A witch.Now ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is different than most American fare. It is by it's nature, slower; it takes time to build up to the main plot. We need to see her reactions to the various day-to-day operations of STN-J. Like how she relates to fellow hunter Amon (is she crushing on him? does he want/need to kill her?), or what is the deal with Dojima anyway (great payoff there!). Or why she refuses to use the anti-Witch Orboro guns.It lacks sex, T&A; and some of the things that we have become accustom to on American TV, but the story is first rate.  I don't know much about anime really, but the visual style is fantastic. It is very easy to see this being remade as a live action drama.  The musical score is also reminiscent of ""the X-files"", haunting, dramatic and really just very, very good.I highly recomend it and this complete collection looks fantastic.",5,Best I have seen.,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,1552,"['like', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'themes', 'then', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'fascinating', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'Sunrise', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Gundam', 'Wing', 'fame', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'Anime', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'cross', 'X-men', 'X-Files', 'parts', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'Others', 'CJ', 'Carella', 'Witchcraft', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'great', 'tale', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'occult', 'themes', 'witches', 'What', 'not', 'love', 'Fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'Robin', 'newest', 'hunter', 'be', 'assigned', 'Solomon', 'Toukatsu', ""Nin'idantai"", 'Solomon', 'Executive', 'Organization', 'Japan', 'STN-J', 'Robin', 'different', 'Robin', 'craft-user', 'witch.Now', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'different', 'most', 'American', 'fare', 'nature', 'slower', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'main', 'plot', 'need', 'see', 'reactions', 'various', 'day-to-day', 'operations', 'STN-J', 'how', 'fellow', 'hunter', 'Amon', 'crushing', 'want/need', 'kill', 'what', 'deal', 'Dojima', 'anyway', 'great', 'payoff', 'there', 'why', 'use', 'anti-Witch', 'Orboro', 'guns.It', 'sex', 'T', 'A', 'things', 'have', 'become', 'accustom', 'American', 'TV', 'story', 'first', 'rate', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'anime', 'really', 'visual', 'style', 'fantastic', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'being', 'remade', 'live', 'action', 'drama', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'X-files', 'haunting', 'dramatic', 'really', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'good.I', 'highly', 'recomend', 'complete', 'collection', 'fantastic']",Witch Hunter Robin: Complete Collection
846938,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B0002VEVQG,A. Schneider,"[8, 12]","Witch Hunter Robin is a great series which I enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series. The visuals are first rate, the music (when there is music) is beautiful, and the storyline is intriguing.Silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery... so what's the problem? That same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns.One of the major problems with Witch Hunter Robin is the pace. Many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough... WHR takes itself much too seriously. Surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long, tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be ""meaningful.""They are I suppose in retrospect (one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of WHR), but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character(s). The psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series, and where they are not, the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them.I realize that this exhausted review of WHR seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses, but it's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes (the best episodes in my opinion).A second problem is also the fact that there are a number of ""witch capturing"" which take place during the series that seem... well, silly. The beginning of the series is all about these capturing - surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature witch/enemies that simply don't interest you (which they may not, the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least).In the end the series is about the characters, story, and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series - if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their back-stories when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing.Lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something ""scary,"" most of the shows on Adult Swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on Adult Swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills (needless to say those watching the series probably aren't into it because the name of the series is ""Witch Hunter,"" they are instead - hopefully - looking for a high quality, cohesive action/drama anime). This is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however... it's more of a beautiful drama. Younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all!!!I'd give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it!",4,Not For Everyone,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2992,"['Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'great', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'delivering', 'finer', 'qualities', 'course', 'series', 'visuals', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'music', 'when', 'music', 'beautiful', 'storyline', 'intriguing.Silence', 'extended', 'stares', 'cloak', 'characters', 'mystery', 'so', 'what', 'problem', 'same', 'cloak', 'series', 'what', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'series', 'yawns.One', 'major', 'problems', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'pace', 'Many', 'serious', 'animes', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'not', 'seriously', 'enough', 'WHR', 'much', 'too', 'seriously', 'Surely', 'story', 'visuals', 'are', 'worth', 'reason', 'are', 'long', 'tiring', 'sequences', 'course', 'series', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'meaningful', 'are', 'suppose', 'retrospect', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'once', 'watch', 'final', 'episodes', 'WHR', 'events', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'warrant', 'such', 'extended', 'periods', 'self', 'reflection', 'part', 'main', 'character', 's', 'psychological', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'present', 'are', 'obvious', 'end', 'series', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'them.I', 'realize', 'exhausted', 'review', 'WHR', 'only', 'be', 'tiresome', 'pace', 'series', 'important', 'factor', 'many', 'simply', 'drop', 'series', 'half', 'way', 'ever', 'seeing', 'later', 'episodes', 'best', 'episodes', 'opinion', '.A', 'second', 'problem', 'also', 'fact', 'are', 'number', 'witch', 'capturing', 'take', 'place', 'series', 'seem', 'well', 'silly', 'beginning', 'series', 'capturing', 'surely', 'seeing', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'understand', 'how', 'rounding', 'out', 'characters', 'course', 'series', 'might', 'just', 'bore', 'tears', 'especially', 'number', 'episodes', 'feature', 'witch/enemies', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'interest', 'may', 'not', 'creativity', 'design', 'many', 'poor', 'say', 'least', 'end', 'series', 'characters', 'story', 'visuals', 'not', 'enemies', 'frequently', 'populated', 'much', 'series', 'find', 'hooked', 'main', 'characters', 'back-stories', 'when', 'are', 'introduced', 'beginning', 'series', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'whole', 'thing.Lastly', 'reviewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'scary', 'most', 'shows', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'are', 'adults', 'anime', 'featured', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'are', 'geared', 'typically', 'interested', 'other', 'things', 'quick', 'thrills', 'needless', 'say', 'watching', 'series', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'name', 'series', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'are', 'instead', 'hopefully', 'looking', 'high', 'quality', 'cohesive', 'action/drama', 'anime', 'not', 'individuals', 'wanting', 'watch', 'action', 'anime', 'however', 'more', 'beautiful', 'drama', 'Younger', 'anime', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'like', 'one', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'first', 'renting', 'go', 'out', 'spend', 'money']",Witch Hunter Robin: Complete Collection
846939,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0002VEVQG,A. Trotter,"[12, 48]","Have any of you ever seen La Femme Nikita? Ok, not the movie, the American TV show. Well, maybe I should explain. La Femme Nikita started as a French film about a smack addict who, with her other smack addict friends, knocks over a convienence store and kills the owner. She gets the death penalty. She is killed. She wakes up in a cell, and the secret shadow organization re-makes her from the skinny shaking junkie into the smooth suave killer they want. Jane Bond, in the beginning of her carreer... Why am I telling you this? Patience, grasshopper.It was a terrific movie: ""My Fair Lady"" gone paranoid government killer. Anyways, hollywood thought it would be even better is everyone spoke English and hey, the lead should definitely be a blonde.  This was remade and renamed ... um... I forget.  No, really, I do. Anyways, in the end the main chickie redeems herself and doesn't want to kill anymore and runs away - leaves her friends at the secret org, leaves her lover that the org knows about, and is finally free. This is the sort of ending that cannot be made into a continuing TV series, so when someone decided to make this movie into a TV series they set it between the time she got caught and the time she left. And they turned the name back to La Femme Nikita, because the Hollywood name was not going to work out on a TV show of that sort of budget.  And I'm not talking about a big budget, despite the show being fairly decent.So, now we get to the point of this little trip down memory walk of fame. The show, La Femme Nikita, was all about - get this-a girl in a super-secret organization with a broody good-looking boss who she cared about and who cared about her but they couldn't show it because, at first, he was just too cold; and besides, inter-office relationships are frowned upon; and later there were all sorts of secret agendas and plots twists and the org was very scary, ""If you leave us or betray us we will kill you and we'll only be doing it for your own good"".  And maybe the organization is good, adn maybe it's using evil methods, and ...  Super technology, etc, etc... wait, which show am I talking about again? Oh! I'm talking about Witch Hunter Robin, of course.Anyways. It's very pretty, visually, and some bits -where Robin's playing with her new glasses -are awesome. But overall, it's very hard to understand. Something is lost in translation, I'm guessing. They try so hard to be inscrutable and obscure they obscure the whole dang plot away. Or at least, it moves very.... very.... sloooowly.It could do with some comprehensable dialogue, that leads somewhere. There's such a thing as letting the viewer figure out for themselves what's going on, and then there's not providing enough information for anyone to figure out anything. This leans towards the second of those.But it's a good show. It's got a good soundtrack, lovely visuals, and it's quiet; I appriciate quiet, especially when so many shows rely so much on obnoxious use of explosions and gunfire. It's ... the word is thoughtful. It's a thoughtful show where the characters are introspective and yet powerul. I do like it.",4,Well. It's not Shakespear.

It takes a little while for the plot to actually shift gears and get moving into a progressive storyline and it probably would have been better to move into the storyline a little sooner.  That said, it's still fun watching and once the plot does develop it gets pretty interesting.  Robin is not the most exciting or endearing character - I don't think this is a particularly character-driven anime.  What really moves this series is the story, the circumstance and the world it creates.  I would have enjoyed seeing a more clear exposition of the rules of their world (ie., what is the difference between a ""Witch"" and a ""Craft User"") since even towards the end I felt like I was still piecing some aspects together.The animation is very pretty - if anything the characters and the settings are wonderful to just sit and stare at.  I had some issue with the subtitles - there were moments where I wasn't sure they were the best translation of the Japanese, even though they were not exactly dub-titles either.  The English dub can go from decent in one episode to pretty awful in another.  Despite the issues with the subtitles, I'd still watch in Japanese to get the best understanding of what is happening.The box set doesn't look anything like the main product photo.

Unless things change in the discs to come then each 20 minute episode is a story to itself. No working up to the Boss...nothing leads into the next story for the most part. For instance...50 evil little dolls... they only find 49..but the next episode has nothing to do with the missing doll. One bad guy gets away...but he is not in the next episode. I hope things get better the more I watch. At this point it is not very good.

846965,A1JCNOZPZXHBRV,B0002VEVQG,Pipe_Nerd,"[1, 1]","I distinctly remember watching the first episode of Witch Hunter Robin online, and being quite intrigued by the basic story and the show's industrial neo-gothic aesthetics. Having finally watched the whole series, however, I have to say that I'm sorely disappointed. There's so much potential here, but I can't help feeling that the show makes at best a half-hearted attempt to develop it.Characters? Robin herself is great. She's endearingly shy and sweet, quietly funny, and frequently badass, and is the only reason I gave this series three stars instead of two. Unfortunately, all of the good characterization seems to have been spent on Robin, because pretty much everyone else gets boring fast, particularly Mr. Grimly Brooding Amon. (To paraphrase a KotOR2 line, the whole sardonically cryptic routine isn't impressive; it's just melodramatic and annoying.) There's just not a lot of development here. Everyone but Robin is to a greater or lesser extent forgettable.Plot? Meh. Again, lots of potential, but sadly little development.

Ostensibly, this is to keep them from becoming menaces as they recognize and begin to use their powers.When one of their own is taken away as a witch, a young Italian raised nun, Robin, is sent in as a replacement. She quickly proves adept as a hunter, and takes initiative in hunting, proving herself invaluable to the team.Viewed as an action title, Robin seems episodic, with the ""monster of the week"" feel to it. But in watching this series carefully, you realize that, just as in the storyline, not everything is as it seems.Witch Hunter Robin is an excellent Gothic mystery, full of symbolism, twists, turns, and clues.Characters develop throughout,and not one is the same as when the character was introduced.As Robin grows and changes through the series, she learns many things about the STNJ, her often shady co-workers, and her own mysterious past.This title deals with witchcraft, a subject offensive to many. The initial portrayal is that all witches are evil and should be removed from society. The series deals with its own demons by demonstrating that there are many forms of evil that man visits on his brother, and addresses the paradox of fighting evil with evil. The characters themselves often struggle between what is good and evil when witchcraft is involved, giving the show a vividly realistic feel.For those concerned with violence or nudity, there is violence, but it is not gratuitous, it is used only to advance the story by demonstrating the various witches' powers. There is no nudity.

846980,A1EH9Z0L6DVPJI,B0002VEVQG,William Butler,"[0, 0]","This remains one of my favorite series. It, however, doesn't surprise me that there are negative reviews since it lacks a great deal of action and is slow to build up a head of steam. Rather than tell the viewer about Robin, her past, and her personality, large chunks of the early episodes are spent showing these elements and watching as the character grows from what she was into what she will be. That type of storytelling isn't for everyone. But it suits my taste rather well. I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack and how it was used to set the mood and color of the story. From the moment Robin arrives in the cab and we hear the deep brooding music with chanting voices, I was hooked and ready to sit and watch the entire series in a single outing. I make it a point to watch Japanese audio with subtitles because I've never been satisfied the English language voice actors deliver the same level of emotion as their Japanese counterparts.All-in-all, if you like a slower pace to your storytelling and enjoy watch characters grow as the plot develops, you'll probably enjoy this series.",5,To Each His Own,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,1094,"['one', 'favorite', 'series', 'however', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'are', 'negative', 'reviews', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'slow', 'build', 'up', 'head', 'steam', 'Rather', 'tell', 'viewer', 'Robin', 'past', 'personality', 'large', 'chunks', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'spent', 'showing', 'elements', 'watching', 'character', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'type', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'suits', 'taste', 'rather', 'well', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'how', 'was', 'used', 'set', 'mood', 'color', 'story', 'moment', 'Robin', 'cab', 'hear', 'deep', 'brooding', 'music', 'chanting', 'voices', 'was', 'hooked', 'ready', 'sit', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'single', 'outing', 'make', 'point', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'subtitles', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'satisfied', 'English', 'language', 'voice', 'actors', 'deliver', 'same', 'level', 'emotion', 'Japanese', 'counterparts.All-in-all', 'like', 'slower', 'pace', 'storytelling', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'characters', 'grow', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'series']",Witch Hunter Robin: Complete Collection
