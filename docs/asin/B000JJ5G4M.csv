For this reason the movie peaked my interest enough to watch it.  ""Brooklyn Lobster"" is the story of a family business on the brink of bankruptcy.  The story revolves around the families struggle to save the family business.  The movie is truly a great story with excellent acting and a heart touching ending.  Give this movie a try for something a little different.  I am giving this 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it.",5,"Great, Heart Touching Movie!",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,570,"['Brooklyn', 'childhood', 'home', 'Jordons', 'Lobster', 'Real', 'Name', 'Lobster', 'Store', 'Movie', 'was', 'place', 'frequented', 'family', 'reason', 'movie', 'peaked', 'interest', 'enough', 'watch', 'Brooklyn', 'Lobster', 'story', 'family', 'business', 'brink', 'bankruptcy', 'story', 'families', 'struggle', 'save', 'family', 'business', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'story', 'excellent', 'acting', 'heart', 'touching', 'ending', 'Give', 'movie', 'try', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'am', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed']",Brooklyn Lobster

I really liked the subject matter and the conflict, but it was presented in such a non-climactic way that I was bored out of my mind.  The acting was good, the directing was good in ways of use of color and background, also maybe symbolism.  But like I said, it was just a boring movie.  I'm disappointed I chose it.

Launay,"[26, 28]","During most of the twentieth century, you could go down to Sheepshead Bay (on the waterfront) in Brooklyn and get a terrific lobster or fish dinnerfor a song.  These lobster shacks are disappearing with the onslaught of Trader Joes, Long John Silvers, and other franchises which replace fresh food with fast food.  Danny Aiello plays a hard nosed, hard working businessman whose family has been in the lobster business in Brooklyn for 60 years. He's fighting for his livelihood - looking for a way to escape Big Money. Due to the fact that the local Bank which financed the Lobster House has ""itself"" defaulted with the FDIC, his small-business loan has been called and his business, his family, his workers, and his identity are all up for sale.Throughout the movie we cheer for this American because he represents the human qualities of courage, endurance, and self-reliance that make America great...but this fellow and his business are on the auction block.  We will wait and see if it can be saved.  (As a metaphor, a broken water line that supplies sea water to his crustaceans is fixed at the last minute.)  For a glimpse of American life that we don't want to forget,  I recommend this film...it is definitely worth a trip to the video store.",4,A thoughtful film on a forgotten aspect of Americana.,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,1250,"['most', 'twentieth', 'century', 'could', 'go', 'down', 'Sheepshead', 'Bay', 'waterfront', 'Brooklyn', 'get', 'terrific', 'lobster', 'fish', 'song', 'lobster', 'shacks', 'are', 'disappearing', 'onslaught', 'Trader', 'Joes', 'Long', 'John', 'Silvers', 'other', 'franchises', 'replace', 'fresh', 'food', 'fast', 'food', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'hard', 'nosed', 'hard', 'working', 'businessman', 'family', 'been', 'lobster', 'business', 'Brooklyn', '60', 'years', 'fighting', 'livelihood', 'looking', 'way', 'escape', 'Big', 'Money', 'Due', 'fact', 'local', 'Bank', 'financed', 'Lobster', 'House', 'defaulted', 'FDIC', 'small-business', 'loan', 'been', 'called', 'business', 'family', 'workers', 'identity', 'are', 'up', 'movie', 'cheer', 'American', 'human', 'qualities', 'courage', 'endurance', 'self-reliance', 'make', 'America', 'great', 'fellow', 'business', 'are', 'auction', 'block', 'will', 'wait', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'metaphor', 'broken', 'water', 'line', 'supplies', 'sea', 'water', 'crustaceans', 'fixed', 'last', 'minute', 'glimpse', 'American', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'recommend', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'trip', 'video', 'store']",Brooklyn Lobster
1026790,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JJ5G4M,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","BROOKLYN LOBSTER is a fine little low budget film that boasts a good story (based on fact) written and directed By Kevin Jordan, an excellent low key cast, and enough family love to satisfy just about everybody's need for feel good movies.Giorgio's Lobster Farm has been in the Giorgio family for years and has recently come on hard times: the bank defaulted on the note held by the business and the business faces foreclosure - and even worse, it will be auctioned off, removing it permanently from the family.  Frank Giorgio (Danny Aiello) is trying to keep his business alive, neglecting his wife Maureen (Jane Curtin) who is tired of living with the crustaceans, and depending on his daughter Lauren (Marisa Ryan) to be his computer, and trying to convince his son Michael (Daniel Sauli) to return to New York from his home in Seattle to help run the business.  Michael's steady girlfriend Kerry (Heather Burns) supports the concept of saving the business but when her family gets involved an incident occurs which damages all concerned.  How Frank's close friend Bill Lau (Henry Yuk) and wife Jen (Jo Yang) step into the failing picture builds to a climax that demonstrates how family, love, extended family, friends, and perseverance can heal just about anything!The cast is excellent with Danny Aiello, Jane Curtin and Daniel Sauli especially fine.  But the overwhelming result of this little film is a restoration of faith in the human spirit - with a lot of help from family and friends.

One of Brooklyn's last Lobster Pounds is threatended by a bank failure, andMr. Aiello's character isn't too sure what plan of action to take.  Their son returns for the Holidays with his girlfriend, who is clearly from a more upscale family. The son is very ambivilent about a possible move back home, and he questions his relationship, just as his mother is trying to define hers. This movie also receives kudos for not portraying the family as being dysfunctional.  The dysfunctional family has managed to become as old a movie cliche as they come. Here we have a pretty normal family coming to terms with everything from coming of age, to coming of old age.In this movie we see not only the older generation struggle against a changing society, but the younger ones as well. The best of parents can pass down their values, their businesses and more to their children, but sometimes the world has other plans. The times continue to change, even in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.Ken",5,A Lobster Grows in Brooklyn,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1385,"['First', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'interesting', 'how', 'movies', 'make', 'wide', 'distribution', 'fame', 'even', 'art', 'house', 'flicks', 'yet', 'others', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'exposure', 'deserve.Brooklyn', 'Lobster', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'true', 'gem', 'movie.Danny', 'Aiello', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'expertly', 'play', 'long', 'married', 'couple', 'drifting', 'apart', 'family', 'business', 'hangs', 'balance', 'One', 'Brooklyn', 'last', 'Lobster', 'Pounds', 'threatended', 'bank', 'failure', 'andMr', 'Aiello', 'character', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'what', 'plan', 'action', 'take', 'son', 'returns', 'Holidays', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'clearly', 'more', 'upscale', 'family', 'son', 'very', 'ambivilent', 'possible', 'move', 'back', 'home', 'questions', 'relationship', 'just', 'mother', 'trying', 'define', 'hers', 'movie', 'also', 'kudos', 'not', 'portraying', 'family', 'being', 'dysfunctional', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'managed', 'become', 'old', 'movie', 'cliche', 'come', 'Here', 'have', 'pretty', 'normal', 'family', 'coming', 'terms', 'everything', 'coming', 'age', 'coming', 'old', 'age.In', 'movie', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'older', 'generation', 'struggle', 'changing', 'society', 'younger', 'ones', 'well', 'best', 'parents', 'can', 'pass', 'down', 'values', 'businesses', 'more', 'children', 'sometimes', 'world', 'other', 'plans', 'times', 'continue', 'change', 'even', 'Sheepshead', 'Bay', 'Brooklyn.Ken']",Brooklyn Lobster

Brooklyn Lobster is a fantastic character study of the differences and hardships faced by members of family pushed into financial turmoil. The movie brings to life the conflicting values and personality traits that are ever-present in families today.  Jordan manages to dive deep into each character and give us a better understanding of their relationships with each other, and in the end the overall identity of the family itself.
