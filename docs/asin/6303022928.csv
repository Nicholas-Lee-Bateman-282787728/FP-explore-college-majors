351150,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303022928,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","There is a growing problem with biopics of this nature.  They either feel overly stuffed (since these performers lives were really so rich with color) or they feel a little too airy since everything tends to get glossed over too quickly.  With `What's Love Got to Do with It', the former is most definitely the case.  Instead of feeling as if we really get to know Tina Turner we are left wondering who she really was.  This isn't to say that the film is a failure, but it is to say that the film never really captures the life she led.  We are left feeling as though we got a quick overall glimpse of her life but we are never really brought down into the trenches so-to-speak.  There are so many facets of her life that are merely mentioned instead of fleshed out, so in the end `What's Love Got to Do with It' winds up feeling a little unfinished.The film tells Anna Mae Bulluck's story; a young girl getting swept up in the musical movement of one Ike Turner, her powerful and raw vocals causing a nation to fall in love with her and a jealous husband to resent her.  As a piece of mere entertainment the film works.  It has glorious set pieces and nice musical numbers and it tells her story so that we can understand it.  As an in-depth look at this woman though, it falls short.  It feels as if it is just cutting from one event to another without really tying things in for us.One minute Ike's two sons are dropped off on his doorstep and then next minute they are playing a concert.  There is no explanation made, no serious consideration given to Ike's previous relationship.  One minute Tina is presented with a Buddhist chant, the next she is a full-fledged practicer of the faith without any real weight given to that aspect of her life.This is sad because Tina's life is rich with turmoil as well as accomplishment, but the film seems to lend no real time to anything within her life.  It plainly tells us what is happening and then moves on, never fleshing it out to the full.Another problem that I have with the film is Angela's portrayal of Mrs. Turner.  A lot have raved her but I personally found her performance to be a tad uneven.  She was over-the-top one minute, under the radar the next and then spot on the next.  She managed to pull out some brilliant scenes, but those scenes got lost when she became overtaken by ticks and `attitude' that seemed unnatural and out of place (that whole courtroom scene was a joke).  I understand her Oscar nomination, because this is the type of performance the Academy usually goes for (biopic, abuse, tragic, inspiring) but her hammy performance was not really worthy of too many accolades.  To me it was Laurence Fishburne that actually saved this movie.  I normally find him rather dull and uninspiring, but his portrayal of Ike is rich beyond words with charisma and ferocity.  He is genuinely charming one minute and fear inspiring the next, and he never falls into the Morpheus brand of monotony he seems to have fallen victim to since 1999.  He gives the most colorful and praise worthy performance in the film, and was really much more deserving of the Oscar than the person who actually won.In the end I have to say that while `What's Love Got to Do with It' seems almost empty at times, it is entertaining and it does hold our interest.  I just expected a lot more from this film, since it has been raved about profusely by so many.  See this for the story, and for Fishburne's dynamic performance, but don't expect a whole lot of enlightenment on the subject of the one and only Tina Turner.",3,Feels a little like condensed soup...,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,3563,"['growing', 'problem', 'biopics', 'nature', 'feel', 'overly', 'stuffed', 'performers', 'lives', 'were', 'really', 'so', 'rich', 'color', 'feel', 'little', 'too', 'airy', 'everything', 'tends', 'get', 'glossed', 'too', 'quickly', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'former', 'most', 'definitely', 'case', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'failure', 'say', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'life', 'led', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'got', 'quick', 'overall', 'glimpse', 'life', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'brought', 'down', 'trenches', 'so-to-speak', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'life', 'are', 'merely', 'mentioned', 'instead', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'end', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'up', 'feeling', 'little', 'unfinished.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bulluck', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'getting', 'swept', 'up', 'musical', 'movement', 'one', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'powerful', 'raw', 'vocals', 'causing', 'nation', 'fall', 'love', 'jealous', 'husband', 'resent', 'piece', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'film', 'glorious', 'set', 'pieces', 'nice', 'musical', 'numbers', 'story', 'can', 'understand', 'in-depth', 'look', 'woman', 'short', 'just', 'cutting', 'one', 'event', 'really', 'tying', 'things', 'us.One', 'minute', 'Ike', 'two', 'sons', 'are', 'dropped', 'off', 'doorstep', 'then', 'next', 'minute', 'are', 'playing', 'concert', 'explanation', 'made', 'serious', 'consideration', 'given', 'Ike', 'previous', 'relationship', 'One', 'minute', 'Tina', 'presented', 'Buddhist', 'chant', 'next', 'full-fledged', 'practicer', 'faith', 'real', 'weight', 'given', 'aspect', 'life.This', 'sad', 'Tina', 'life', 'rich', 'turmoil', 'as', 'well', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'lend', 'real', 'time', 'anything', 'life', 'plainly', 'what', 'happening', 'then', 'moves', 'never', 'fleshing', 'full.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'Angela', 'portrayal', 'Mrs.', 'Turner', 'lot', 'have', 'raved', 'personally', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'tad', 'uneven', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'one', 'minute', 'radar', 'next', 'then', 'spot', 'next', 'managed', 'pull', 'out', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'got', 'lost', 'when', 'became', 'overtaken', 'ticks', 'attitude', 'seemed', 'unnatural', 'place', 'whole', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'was', 'joke', 'understand', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'type', 'performance', 'Academy', 'usually', 'biopic', 'abuse', 'tragic', 'inspiring', 'hammy', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'worthy', 'too', 'many', 'accolades', 'was', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'actually', 'saved', 'movie', 'normally', 'find', 'rather', 'dull', 'uninspiring', 'portrayal', 'Ike', 'rich', 'words', 'charisma', 'ferocity', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'one', 'minute', 'fear', 'inspiring', 'next', 'never', 'Morpheus', 'brand', 'monotony', 'have', 'fallen', 'victim', '1999', 'most', 'colorful', 'praise', 'worthy', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'almost', 'empty', 'times', 'entertaining', 'hold', 'interest', 'just', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'been', 'raved', 'profusely', 'so', 'many', 'See', 'story', 'Fishburne', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'enlightenment', 'subject', 'one', 'only', 'Tina', 'Turner']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

If you give me a room I promise you I will pay you back as soon as I can.""And if this powerful scene of a battered and bruised Tina Turner from the hands of Ike Turner, fleeing to a nearby hotel - a star performer known throughout the world - with only change in her pocket, doesn't move you, then you just don't get it.Angela Bassett won Golden Globe and NAACP Image awards for her portrayal of Tina Turner in the 1993 release that was based on the best-selling autobiography, I, Tina. Laurence Fishburne turns in a fantastic performance as Ike Turner.The movie follows the life of Anna Mae Bullock from Nutbush, Tennessee to St. Louis - where she meets Ike Turner - and to what appeared to be a charmed life of international music stars. But success came with a harsh price for Tina Turner.As her popularity grew, Ike Turner became physically and verbally abusive. Fueling this cowardly anger with cocaine, he openly flaunted his affairs while being surrounded by a group of enablers, who said nothing as long as the party never stopped.Tina Turner finally finds the courage to leave the relationship and rebuild her shattered personal & professional life. The final scene brings even more powerful meaning to the song, What's Love Got To Do With It, which streaked to number one in the Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 1, 1984.A man like Ike Turner who physically and mentally abuses a woman is a sick bully and coward. In the divorce proceedings, though Tina Turner agreed to sign away any claim to future record royalties and publishing rights to their music, Ike Turner - who played a bizarre victim card - also wanted her stage name, claiming, ""That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it.""He was so wrong; it wasn't his daddy's blood written all over it. Anna Mae Bullock got to keep the name that she made even more famous as a solo artist, author and - perhaps, most importantly - as a woman who showed the fortitude to leave an abusive relationship and take control of her life.",5,"""My name is Tina Turner and my husband and I have had",1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,2045,"['argument', 'have', '32', 'cents', 'pocket', 'give', 'room', 'promise', 'will', 'pay', 'back', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'powerful', 'scene', 'battered', 'bruised', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'hands', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'fleeing', 'nearby', 'hotel', 'star', 'performer', 'known', 'world', 'only', 'change', 'pocket', ""n't"", 'move', 'then', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Angela', 'Bassett', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'NAACP', 'Image', 'awards', 'portrayal', 'Tina', 'Turner', '1993', 'release', 'was', 'based', 'best-selling', 'autobiography', 'Tina', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Ike', 'Turner.The', 'movie', 'life', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bullock', 'Nutbush', 'Tennessee', 'St.', 'Louis', 'where', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'charmed', 'life', 'international', 'music', 'stars', 'success', 'came', 'harsh', 'price', 'Tina', 'Turner.As', 'popularity', 'grew', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'became', 'physically', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'Fueling', 'cowardly', 'anger', 'cocaine', 'openly', 'flaunted', 'affairs', 'being', 'surrounded', 'group', 'enablers', 'who', 'said', 'nothing', 'as', 'long', 'party', 'never', 'stopped.Tina', 'Turner', 'finally', 'courage', 'leave', 'relationship', 'rebuild', 'shattered', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'final', 'scene', 'brings', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'meaning', 'song', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'streaked', 'number', 'one', 'Billboard', 'Hot', '100', 'chart', 'September', '1', '1984.A', 'man', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'who', 'physically', 'mentally', 'woman', 'sick', 'bully', 'coward', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'agreed', 'sign', 'away', 'claim', 'future', 'record', 'royalties', 'publishing', 'rights', 'music', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'who', 'played', 'bizarre', 'victim', 'card', 'also', 'wanted', 'stage', 'name', 'claiming', 'name', 'got', 'daddy', 'blood', 'written', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'daddy', 'blood', 'written', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bullock', 'got', 'keep', 'name', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'famous', 'solo', 'artist', 'author', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'woman', 'who', 'showed', 'fortitude', 'leave', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'take', 'control', 'life']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

Naturally, the abuse is what is emphasized here and it's not pretty. It's a 'triumph-over-adversity' tale. The music is heard, but not enough.

It take your basic story of the rough climb to the top of he music industry and the hidden anguish endured to get there. What makes this film stand out is the incredible acting, terrific music preformances, it's refusal gloss things over and, most importantly, it's all true.It's based on Tina's autobiography 'I Tina'. From the abuse and downright touture she had to endure at the hands of her monsterous husband Ike Turner (all the while having to go out on stage and preform) it's astounding that she survived let alone thrived. But what I found just as hurtful, and possibly even more so, is the treatment she gets from her own mother. This is a woman who abandons her daughter at a very young age and upon their reuniting pushes her to STAY in the abusive relationship so she can reap the benefits of new homes, nice clothes and such! Tina had a hard life all around. It wasn't just Ike. That's what's so great about this film. It gives you the entire picture. Well almost, the autobiography goes into even more detail. As far as the DVD goes, the only extra included is the original threatrical trailer. The transfer though is prestine showing deep blacks and bright colors. Sound is in 5.1 surround and really showed off in the preformance segments. Speaking of which, they are terrific! They bring much energy and fun to the picture so you never get bogged down with the much more dreary aspects.Angela Basset give a pssionate, energetic and moving preformace as Tina. Only occationally did I feel she was not Tina. Laurance Fishburn is devesatingly brutal, but charming as well. You understand why Tina fell for him in the first place.

351158,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6303022928,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","This was a very dramatic movie, that was overall pretty good, but like Ike Turner, it got a little heavy handed at times. As a biography it ranks up there with Walk the Line, but perhaps a slight notch below Ray.The opening scene with the young Anna Mae Bullock (Rae'ven Kelly) singing in the church choir was priceless. She showed great potential and promise and energy--as a rock and roller, not a holy roller! As the choir director escorted her to the door, pulling her by the ear, you just knew that she was going someplace. Someplace else.Great performances by Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, and all the supporting cast. Angela, who graduated from Yale with a B.A. in African-American studies in 1980 and Yale drama school with a Master of Fine Arts Degree in 1983, sure doesn't show it here, as she becomes a shy but talented teenager named Anna Mae Bullock from Nutbush, Tennessee. She received an Oscar nomination, but lost out to Holly Hunter for The Piano. As an aside, Fishburne turned down the role five times, when he thought that either Halle Berry or Whitney Houston were being cast, but upon hearing that Angela Bassett was going to do it, he finally accepted. As Ike and Tina Turner, they have some very dramatic and harrowing scenes, and they both deliver stellar performances.Great music, and really spectacular concert scenes that captured the excitement of their performances. The title song was used especially well, as a comment on Ike and Tina's relationship, and the fact that she had really moved on. I liked the wild fashions, especially the ones that Ike wore as the 70's raged on. 70's fashion can really make you look like a clown, but it showed how like a chameleon, he changed his look to match his surroundings, and went with the flow of the fashion. Lots of great costumes on Tina, the band, and the back up singers, the Ikettes.But for all the great music, they left out a song and performance that was really special, and I wonder why they left out the Ike & Turner version of the Otis Redding song, ""I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now)"". You can hear it on their 1968 Blue Thumb album entitled ""Outta Season"". Even better, see it in The Rolling Stones concert documentary Gimme Shelter. No, they didn't do it at Altamont, but were on tour with The Stones and their raunchy, sexually charged duet really brought down the house at Madison Square Gardens. Tina and the WLGTDWI? film makers might have thought it too risque, or that it would disrupt the narrative they were fashioning; but I think it would have shed a little light on certain aspects of their relationship, as well as showing what an incendiary act the Ike & Tina Turner Review could be.A very fine film that tells the story from Tina Turner's point of view. She has lived an incredible life, and her story makes for a very dramatic and compelling narrative. She has come such a long way since she was that little girl from Nutbush, Tennessee, Anna Mae Bullock, who was thrown out of the church choir.I, Tinaby Tina Turner and Kurt Loder (Hardcover - Sep 1986)Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turnerby Ike Turner, Nigel Cawthorn, and Little Richard (Hardcover - Sep 15, 1999)Private Dancer(1990) This is the Post Ike record that features the song WLGTDWI? that gave this film its title.Rhythm Rockin' Blues(1951) Rocket 88 (some say it's the first rock 'n roll song ever recorded) along with other Ike Turner music, can be heard on this record.The Color Purple(1985) (as Larry Fishburne) ....

351159,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,6303022928,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 2]","Adapted from pop-rock-blues dynamo Tina Turner's autobiographical ""I, Tina"" and bearing the same title as the solo smash that sent her solo career through the stratosphere, ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" features Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishbourne in astounding performances that garnered both lead acting Oscar nominations. The film takes us from Tina and husband Ike Turner's beginnings as a struggling singing duo in the 1950's and through the disintegration of their marriage to drug and domestic abuse and Tina's ultimate triumph of coming into her own both as a person and astronomical singing talent. Bassett is nothing less than a force of nature as the professionally and physically battered Tina who progressively finds the anger and self-respect to put an end to husband Ike's total domination of her. Fishburne is no less overpowering as bad guy Ike, and Fishburne's convincing portrayal of Ike's gradual decent into drug oblivion and increasing violence against his wife is devastating. Together, he and Bassett manage to make us feel the violence and desperation of two people clearly headed for total ruin. The film's numerous episodes of spousal battery are explicit, and we can't help but wonder how much suffering other couples endure in private. For Ike and Tina, their suffering (especially Tina's) was laid out on the public stage. So convincing are Bassett and Fishburne that we actually pain for the real lady and thirst for revenge against the real man, and their ability to evoke those emotions is a tribute to both Bassett's and Fishburne's talents. When Tina finally delves deeply enough inside herself to raise up and cry enough to the violence, we have both a sense of admiration for the lady's courage and the security of knowning that this lady will be okay. The latter is validated in the final scene when Tina takes to the stage as a solo artist. And, as they say, the rest is history. Director Brian Gibson gives us a riveting production, and Bassett and Fishburne are numbing in their respective roles as victim and victimizer. ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" is a bravado film on two counts: we get to feel the desperation and eventual redemption of someone as a victim of violence, and we get a magnificent sense of respect for the real woman whose life this film is.",4,Bassett and Fishbourne in a riveting tour de force,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,2309,"['Adapted', 'pop-rock-blues', 'dynamo', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'autobiographical', 'Tina', 'bearing', 'same', 'title', 'solo', 'smash', 'sent', 'solo', 'career', 'stratosphere', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Laurence', 'Fishbourne', 'astounding', 'performances', 'garnered', 'lead', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'Tina', 'husband', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'beginnings', 'struggling', 'singing', 'duo', '1950', 'disintegration', 'marriage', 'drug', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Tina', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'coming', 'own', 'person', 'astronomical', 'singing', 'talent', 'Bassett', 'nothing', 'less', 'force', 'nature', 'professionally', 'physically', 'battered', 'Tina', 'who', 'progressively', 'anger', 'self-respect', 'put', 'end', 'husband', 'Ike', 'total', 'domination', 'Fishburne', 'less', 'overpowering', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ike', 'Fishburne', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'Ike', 'gradual', 'decent', 'drug', 'oblivion', 'increasing', 'violence', 'wife', 'devastating', 'Together', 'Bassett', 'manage', 'make', 'feel', 'violence', 'desperation', 'two', 'people', 'clearly', 'headed', 'total', 'ruin', 'film', 'numerous', 'episodes', 'spousal', 'battery', 'are', 'explicit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'suffering', 'other', 'couples', 'endure', 'private', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'suffering', 'especially', 'Tina', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'public', 'stage', 'convincing', 'are', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'actually', 'pain', 'real', 'lady', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'real', 'man', 'ability', 'evoke', 'emotions', 'tribute', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'talents', 'When', 'Tina', 'finally', 'deeply', 'enough', 'raise', 'up', 'cry', 'enough', 'violence', 'have', 'sense', 'admiration', 'lady', 'courage', 'security', 'knowning', 'lady', 'will', 'be', 'okay', 'latter', 'validated', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Tina', 'stage', 'solo', 'artist', 'say', 'rest', 'history', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Gibson', 'riveting', 'production', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'are', 'numbing', 'respective', 'roles', 'victim', 'victimizer', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'bravado', 'film', 'two', 'counts', 'get', 'feel', 'desperation', 'eventual', 'redemption', 'someone', 'victim', 'violence', 'get', 'magnificent', 'sense', 'respect', 'real', 'woman', 'life', 'film']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

This all happens set to the amazing music of Ike and Tina Turner, and then Tina. Each song has a deeper meaning, in the context of Turner's journey toward self love and independence. She was much more than a pretty face, legs for miles and a voice that could smooth the naps out on a shag carpet.

Fisburne and Bassett were great in their roles and acted their faces off.But the movie played up themes that were lies at best slander toward Ike Turner. Tina was no innocent in that marriage, she had a kid from the drummer in his band that the movie ignores and so many lies to play off the fact that he was more abusive than he actually was making him the second coming of Ted Bundy than a fully fleshed person, add to the fact she has only seen him twice in the past 30 years and the scene with the gun at the end and playing her off as a loving mother to her sons when she all but abandoned them to Ike and moved to Europe and got over and became a multi- millionare and married her white saviour. Black folks who gave this movie a five - star review ,Tina is no longer the black female icon you admire but a liar a person who played on your pity, like O.J.

351174,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303022928,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","It was gratifying to see rock legend Tina Turner earn the coveted Kennedy Center honor last month, certainly reason enough to revisit this wonderful biopic based on her 1987 self-affirming autobiography, ""I, Tina"" co-written with Rolling Stone editor Kurt Loder. Directed by the late Brian Gibson in an appropriately feverish manner, the 1993 movie still burns brightly thanks to the electrifying performances of Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne. There have been several fine performances in biopics of late - Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"", Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in ""Walk the Line"" - but I still feel Bassett and Fishburne maintain the high watermark as they seem to inhabit the roles of Ike and Tina completely in this film.Adapting probably the most melodramatic parts of Tina's book, Gibson and screenwriter Kate Lanier built a dramatic framework about the former Anna Mae Bullock that is somewhat standard-issue and probably biased, but it works on a visceral level as a story of personal triumph punctuated by some of the most gut-wrenching scenes of domestic violence captured on film. Playing one of the most recognizable and enduring celebrities in the rock world, Bassett manages to capture the physical mannerisms, vocal patterns, and onstage energy of the real Tina, even though her voice obviously had to be dubbed. With her almost distracting musculature, she convincingly rips into all her musical performances with unabated fire, but it's really in her dramatic scenes, especially when she becomes an increasingly degraded victim of her husband's demons, that she soars. Fishburne has an extremely tough role, as he has to transcend the inherent villainy of Ike by displaying the bravado and talent that brought the pair the spotlight in the early years. He brilliantly manages to imbue a spirit that is at once frightening and pitiable.With a relatively sparse filmography, Gibson provides surprisingly sturdy direction here, often using an effective faux-combination of grainy home movies and TV programs to make the movie feel like a ""Behind the Scenes"" rock documentary. I particularly liked how he edited the inevitable ""Proud Mary"" - complete with gyrating Ikettes and Tina in her classic cavewoman mini - to show the passage of time between the late sixties to the mid-seventies. Unsurprisingly, no one else makes nearly the impression of the two stars, though Jenifer Lewis has a few funny moments as Tina's mother Zelma, and Vanessa Bell Calloway does what she can in her switch from hard-bitten back-up singer to becalming Buddhist. Regardless, see it for two actors - sadly underutilized since this movie was released, the wondrous Bassett in particular - giving all they have into this memorable movie. The DVD has no significant extras other than the original trailer.",5,"Two Red-Hot Blazing Performances Bring Fire, Glory and Nuance to Tina Turner's Story",1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2807,"['was', 'gratifying', 'see', 'rock', 'legend', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'earn', 'coveted', 'Kennedy', 'Center', 'honor', 'last', 'month', 'certainly', 'reason', 'enough', 'revisit', 'wonderful', 'biopic', 'based', '1987', 'self-affirming', 'autobiography', 'Tina', 'co-written', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'editor', 'Kurt', 'Loder', 'Directed', 'late', 'Brian', 'Gibson', 'appropriately', 'feverish', 'manner', '1993', 'movie', 'still', 'brightly', 'thanks', 'electrifying', 'performances', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'fine', 'performances', 'biopics', 'late', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Walk', 'Line', 'still', 'feel', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'maintain', 'high', 'watermark', 'seem', 'inhabit', 'roles', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'completely', 'film.Adapting', 'probably', 'most', 'melodramatic', 'parts', 'Tina', 'book', 'Gibson', 'screenwriter', 'Kate', 'Lanier', 'built', 'dramatic', 'framework', 'former', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bullock', 'somewhat', 'standard-issue', 'probably', 'biased', 'visceral', 'level', 'story', 'personal', 'triumph', 'punctuated', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'scenes', 'domestic', 'violence', 'captured', 'film', 'Playing', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'enduring', 'celebrities', 'rock', 'world', 'Bassett', 'capture', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'vocal', 'patterns', 'onstage', 'energy', 'real', 'Tina', 'even', 'voice', 'obviously', 'had', 'be', 'dubbed', 'almost', 'distracting', 'musculature', 'convincingly', 'musical', 'performances', 'unabated', 'fire', 'really', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'increasingly', 'degraded', 'victim', 'husband', 'demons', 'Fishburne', 'extremely', 'tough', 'role', 'transcend', 'inherent', 'villainy', 'Ike', 'displaying', 'bravado', 'talent', 'brought', 'pair', 'spotlight', 'early', 'years', 'brilliantly', 'imbue', 'spirit', 'once', 'frightening', 'pitiable.With', 'relatively', 'sparse', 'filmography', 'Gibson', 'surprisingly', 'sturdy', 'direction', 'here', 'often', 'using', 'effective', 'faux-combination', 'grainy', 'home', 'movies', 'TV', 'programs', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'Scenes', 'rock', 'documentary', 'particularly', 'liked', 'how', 'edited', 'inevitable', 'Proud', 'Mary', 'complete', 'gyrating', 'Ikettes', 'Tina', 'classic', 'cavewoman', 'mini', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'late', 'sixties', 'mid-seventies', 'Unsurprisingly', 'one', 'else', 'nearly', 'impression', 'two', 'stars', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'Tina', 'mother', 'Zelma', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'Calloway', 'what', 'can', 'switch', 'hard-bitten', 'back-up', 'singer', 'becalming', 'Buddhist', 'Regardless', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'sadly', 'underutilized', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'wondrous', 'Bassett', 'particular', 'giving', 'have', 'memorable', 'movie', 'DVD', 'significant', 'other', 'original', 'trailer']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

Taylor ""GFT""","[17, 19]","Celebrity bio-pics are very hit or miss, but once in a great while a really good one comes along--and WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is one of them.  Based on the autobiography of Tina Turner, the film offers a glossy but intense portrait of her rapid rise to stardom under the sponsorship of husband-manager Ike Turner--a relationship that quickly turned dark and became increasingly abusive as Tina's fame began to outstrip Ike's own.Although the film is a bit on the obvious side, it is well-crafted and the two leads offer powerhouse performances.  Angela Bassett is simply astonishing as Tina Turner; where most other actresses might have simply imitated, Bassett accomplishes the impossible: she makes you believe that she is Tina Turner, capturing both Tina's famous on-stage performing style (the concert scenes are really exciting) and giving a completely believable interpretation of her off-stage personality as well.  The script offers Laurence Fishburne little more than a one-dimensional role, but he plays it brilliantly from start to finish, and both are well supported by the overall cast.There is certainly a great deal more to the lives of both Ike and Tina Turner than this film conveys--but what it does show it presents with considerable power and conviction, and by the time Tina finally hits back at Ike you'll be roaring for her to hit him again--and again--and again--and eager to see her finally triumph entirely on her own.

Even the VHS version offered more than the DVD. It at least included the video of Tina's ""I don't wanna fight"" a smash hit that was the theme of the movie.

This movie focuses on their relationship to the Tina Turner we know today.Tina naturally took the lead musically in their Ike and Tina Turner Revue once the mike was handed to her. This became clear that Tina was the one for which the fans were clamoring, Ike did not take lightly to being second fiddle, and their relationship became disoriented and abuse, with Ike easing into the role of abusive husband with ease.The movie moves on by Tina finally having enough, she divorced Ike, taking nothing from the marriage except her children and her show business name, the name she earned. From there, she went on to rebuild her life and career, becoming the world renowned rock and roll diva she is today. Ike, a substance abuser, ended up in prison for narcotics possession and fell into relative obscurity, little more than a footnote in rock and roll history.

351191,A7IIPRUAEZ2N6,6303022928,Kendrik Lau,"[6, 7]","That is my sentiment. When Angela Bassett exploded on the silver screen as the irrepressible Tina Turner and was nominated for an Oscar....I was certain she would win. However, she didn't. Instead, Halle Berry earned the distinction of the being the first woman of African descent to win the Best Actress Award...and for a performance that doesn't come anywhere close to Bassett's. In fact, many Oscar winner's performances pale to Bassett's and people still remember Bassett's showstopper and didn't even remember whom she lost the award to.Based on Tina Turner's autobiography, it ""chronicled"" Tina's rise to stardom as Ike Turner's partner. The relationship, already tumultous from the start, turned for the worst when Tina's fame pulled ahead of Ike's. Tina finally left the relationship and started from scratch, becoming the successful solo artist that she is today.Ike is very much maligned in this movie, understandable since it is told from Tina's point of view. In any case, Laurence Fishburne delivered a tour-de-force performance that rivals Bassett's.As for Bassett herself, I agree with reviewers that she did not imitated, or even looked much like Tina. To imitate someone only shows you are NOT that person. In any case, Bassett did an incredible job of endearing herself to the audience into believing that she IS Tina Turner. So successful was she that when the real Tina showed up in a concert clip at the end of the movie, it seems a bit of a comedown...because we have already attached to and identified with Angela; and invested a good portion of our emotions toward her.Some reviewers seem to take umbrage with the fact that Tina's Black husband is the villain of the piece while benevolent White men ""saved"" Tina in the end.Got news for you, despite what PC and feminism like to make you believe, heterosexual white men are not the only oppressors of the world.",5,"Angela Bassett Deserved the Oscar, not Halle Berry",1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,1885,"['sentiment', 'When', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'exploded', 'silver', 'screen', 'irrepressible', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '.I', 'was', 'certain', 'would', 'win', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'earned', 'distinction', 'being', 'first', 'woman', 'African', 'descent', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'performance', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', 'Bassett', 'fact', 'many', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'performances', 'pale', 'Bassett', 'people', 'still', 'remember', 'Bassett', 'showstopper', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'whom', 'lost', 'award', 'to.Based', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'autobiography', 'chronicled', 'Tina', 'rise', 'stardom', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'partner', 'relationship', 'already', 'tumultous', 'start', 'turned', 'worst', 'when', 'Tina', 'fame', 'pulled', 'ahead', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'finally', 'left', 'relationship', 'started', 'scratch', 'becoming', 'successful', 'solo', 'artist', 'today.Ike', 'very', 'much', 'maligned', 'movie', 'understandable', 'told', 'Tina', 'point', 'view', 'case', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'delivered', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'rivals', ""Bassett's.As"", 'Bassett', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'imitated', 'even', 'looked', 'much', 'Tina', 'imitate', 'someone', 'only', 'are', 'NOT', 'person', 'case', 'Bassett', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'endearing', 'audience', 'believing', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'So', 'successful', 'was', 'when', 'real', 'Tina', 'showed', 'up', 'concert', 'clip', 'end', 'movie', 'bit', 'comedown', 'have', 'already', 'attached', 'identified', 'Angela', 'invested', 'good', 'portion', 'emotions', 'her.Some', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'take', 'umbrage', 'fact', 'Tina', 'Black', 'husband', 'villain', 'piece', 'benevolent', 'White', 'men', 'saved', 'Tina', 'end.Got', 'news', 'what', 'PC', 'feminism', 'make', 'believe', 'heterosexual', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'oppressors', 'world']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

When we walked out of seeing the movie during its first run in the theater, my husband commented dryly, &quot;Well, that movie didn't paint a  very flattering portrait of Ike.&quot; and we both laughed at the  understatement. If you've read the Tina's book, though, you'll know that  the movie goes VERY easy on him-while merely a typical abusive bully in the  film, Ike treated her much, much worse in real life. I think if they put  even half the abuse and torture he put her through in real life, though,  the movie would have been too much of a downer-you got the idea. Fishburne  does a good job of making Ike so charming when Tina first meets him that  you can see why she falls in love with him, until he turns into a monster.  Angela Bassett is just fantastic, she has Tina down perfect, though her  upper body is so pumped up in some scenes she looks almost masculine. Tina  Turner was (hell, still is at 60) toned and buff, but not a female  bodybuilder. Her performance is dynamic and heartbreaking, and I can't  watch the scene where she finally gets sick of his abuse and starts  fighting back without getting emotional. When she finally hits him back in  the scene in the limo, I heard the loudest cheers and applause in the  audience that I've heard since I saw Thelma and Louise. I've seen the movie  dozens of times and her passion in that scene still gets me emotional every  time.But the real reason I watch the  movie over and over (especially when I'm trying to get motivated to work  out) are the musical numbers. They include among others &quot;A Fool in  Love&quot;, &quot;Rock me Baby&quot; a great montage to &quot;Make me  Over&quot;, but the centerpiece of the film has got to be the perfect  recreation, right down to the choreography, of the Ike and Tina Turner  Revue's &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. It is full of so much energy and rocks so  much that your jaw will just hang open in amazement when Tina and the  Ikettes start going into their dance moves. I never get tired of watching  that scene (almost as good as the real thing). I'm still trying to figure  out how they kept their wigs on when they were whipping their upper bodies  back and forth, they danced so hard. Oh, and the costumes (especially on  the Ikettes and the &quot;Proud Mary&quot; fringe dress) and period detail  are not only accurate but To Die For. I can't recommend this movie enough.

Award calibre performances are turned in by Angela Bassett, as Tina, and Laurence Fishburne, as Ike. They are both absolutely riveting.Ms. Bassett plays Tina with all the earthy charm and sexual magnetism of the real life Tina Turner. Laurence Fishburne gives an amazingly effective performance as Ike, at once both repellent and charismatic. The movie focuses on their relationship, one which sowed the seeds for the Tina Turner we know today.What started out as a match made in heaven, quickly soured as Tina naturally took the lead musically in their Ike and Tina Turner Revue. When it became clear that Tina was the one for which the fans were clamoring, Ike did not take lightly to being second banana, and their relationship became one of domestic discord and abuse, with Ike easing into the role of abusive husband with relative ease.When Tina finally had had enough, she divorced Ike, taking nothing from the marriage except her children and her show business name, the name she earned. From there, she went on to rebuild her life and career, becoming the world reknowned rock and roll diva she is today. Ike, a substance abuser, ended up in prison for narcotics possession and fell into relative obscurity, little more than a footnote in rock and roll history.This is a film well worth watching, with great performances and great music.

351195,A163N66ALZDACR,6303022928,LBloom,"[0, 0]","Great performances by Angela Bassett and Lawrence Fishburne. By now everyone knows the story of Ike and Tina's nighmarish marriage, so the question is how well is it told? The story is told extremely well as Tina even supervised in the production. I have heard that Ike accepted a check for $40,000 rather than sue for damages and that this was the last time Ike and Tina ever spoke. Tina is said to have even avoided Ike's funeral.The only thing I would warn anyone about in this movie is that there are several extremely violent scenes which could be disturbing to some people, most notably a horrifying rape scene.The story is told realistically enough. The beginnings show a nervous and inexperienced Anna Mae anxious to please band leader Ike and to blend in with the other girls in the band who warn rookie Anna Mae about Ike's reputation. His girlfriend's bed isn't even cold before he starts romancing Anna Mae. Ike's ex-girlfriend, Lorraine threatens to shoot Anna Mae, but changes her mind, turning the gun on herself instead, but is so drunk she botches her own suicide attempt. Lorraine goes to the hospital, (she's ok) but Anna Mae is frightened and Ike is upset that Lorraine is just one more person who has turned against him. This sort of becomes a little song and dance that Ike likes to play for people when things don't quite go his way. He tried to help people who have turned on him and each time he tells it, it loses credibility as most of the time it seems to be Ike who turns on others. However, at first, Anna Mae seems to think she is only seeing a more sensitive side of Ike who is still little more than a perfect stranger. Early on in the movie, the band struggles to get gigs and rookie Anna Mae still feels uneasy around the others, but eventually she is accepted into the band, and even becomes Ike's legal wife, a decison she lives to regret as we all know. The band starts to climb the charts, the gigs get better, the money increases, as does the pressure to produce hits. Ike's drug abuse escalates as well as his jealousy at Tina's new found confidence and favor with audiences and producers and fans. While Tina and the others seem to be enjoying the success, Ike spends long hours at the piano and in the studio trying to come up with new hits. Again Ike becomes increasingly difficult to work with and eventhe other band members have a difficult time ignoring the growing tension between Ike and Tina and Ike and themselves, and Ike and the whole human race for that matter. Things seem to come to a screeching halt after a recording session with legendary producer Phil Spector who wants to work with Tina only, an ugly incident in a restaurant and on board an ariline, as well as Tina's unssuccessful attempt to take the kids and go back home, a rape and susequent suicide attempt lead Tina to divorce court. Tina files for divorce and wins easily while Ike is convicted of income tax evasion and possession of narcotics.Tina revives her career solo and the movie ends with 80s Tina making her comeback and winning Grammy Awards in the process.",5,We Don't Like This Ike,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,3087,"['Great', 'performances', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'now', 'everyone', 'story', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'nighmarish', 'marriage', 'question', 'how', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'told', 'extremely', 'well', 'Tina', 'even', 'supervised', 'production', 'have', 'heard', 'Ike', 'accepted', 'check', '40,000', 'rather', 'sue', 'damages', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'ever', 'spoke', 'Tina', 'said', 'have', 'even', 'avoided', 'Ike', 'funeral.The', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'warn', 'anyone', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'extremely', 'violent', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'disturbing', 'people', 'most', 'notably', 'horrifying', 'rape', 'scene.The', 'story', 'told', 'realistically', 'enough', 'beginnings', 'show', 'nervous', 'inexperienced', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'anxious', 'please', 'band', 'leader', 'Ike', 'blend', 'other', 'girls', 'band', 'who', 'warn', 'rookie', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Ike', 'reputation', 'girlfriend', 'bed', ""n't"", 'even', 'cold', 'romancing', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Ike', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lorraine', 'shoot', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'mind', 'turning', 'gun', 'instead', 'so', 'drunk', 'own', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Lorraine', 'hospital', 'ok', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'frightened', 'Ike', 'upset', 'Lorraine', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'person', 'who', 'turned', 'sort', 'becomes', 'little', 'song', 'dance', 'Ike', 'play', 'people', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'way', 'tried', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'time', 'credibility', 'most', 'time', 'be', 'Ike', 'who', 'others', 'However', 'first', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'think', 'only', 'seeing', 'more', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Ike', 'who', 'still', 'little', 'more', 'perfect', 'stranger', 'Early', 'movie', 'band', 'get', 'gigs', 'rookie', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'still', 'uneasy', 'others', 'eventually', 'accepted', 'band', 'even', 'Ike', 'legal', 'wife', 'decison', 'regret', 'know', 'band', 'climb', 'charts', 'gigs', 'get', 'better', 'money', 'increases', 'pressure', 'produce', 'hits', 'Ike', 'drug', 'abuse', 'as', 'well', 'jealousy', 'Tina', 'new', 'found', 'confidence', 'favor', 'audiences', 'producers', 'fans', 'Tina', 'others', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'success', 'Ike', 'long', 'hours', 'piano', 'studio', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'hits', 'Again', 'Ike', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'work', 'eventhe', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'ignoring', 'growing', 'tension', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'Ike', 'whole', 'human', 'race', 'matter', 'Things', 'seem', 'come', 'screeching', 'halt', 'recording', 'session', 'legendary', 'producer', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'who', 'work', 'Tina', 'only', 'ugly', 'incident', 'restaurant', 'board', 'ariline', 'as', 'well', 'Tina', 'unssuccessful', 'attempt', 'take', 'kids', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'rape', 'susequent', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'lead', 'Tina', 'divorce', 'court', 'Tina', 'files', 'divorce', 'wins', 'easily', 'Ike', 'convicted', 'income', 'tax', 'evasion', 'possession', 'narcotics.Tina', 'revives', 'career', 'solo', 'movie', '80s', 'Tina', 'making', 'comeback', 'winning', 'Grammy', 'Awards', 'process']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

351196,A3KSPMD210TJPU,6303022928,Matt Tawesson,"[4, 4]","This is a really fabulous movie with Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne. Based on Tina Turner's life and her book I, Tina (which I have not read), the movie begins with her (formerly known as Anna Mae Bullock) as a little girl singing in a church choir, but out of sync from the rest of the group to where she gets evicted from the church. Years later, as a teen in the late 50s, she moves to St. Louis to live with her mother, who had walked out years before. Soon after that, she meets Ike Turner (played by Laurence Fishburne), the man who would give her his name. He gets her started as a singer and they get married shortly later on. At first, he is really sweet and kind to her, but after a while, the marriage starts going downhill. Ike becomes pressured and stressed out from his own career, abuses narcotics, and is jealous of Tina's success to where he gets very volatile and abusive to her. The scenes where Ike abuses Tina and bullies her are so disturbing. The scene where Ike and Tina are doing their own version of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Proud Mary is so wonderful, but when the crowd starts cheering after the performance, Tina receives all of the cheering, while Ike is pretty much ignored by the crowd. After a while, Tina is abused by Ike again, but it is the last straw for her as she quietly flees away from him to a hotel across the street while he is taking a nap at a hotel they had checked in to. She goes to court and divorces him, and leaving with nothing except for her name. From what is seen in this movie, Tina is very successful in her career, while the ""crucifixion"" of Ike is happening at the same time. He meets her sometime later on, gives her flowers and begs her to give him another chance and promises that he will do well and treat her better than the last time. She does not accept his promise (nobody would disagree with that), and gets out of his new car and slams the car door so hard the glass in the window shatters. What a way for Tina to tell Ike to get lost! She knew that she was determined to make it on her own without Ike. Good for Tina!! Bassett and Fishburne were great in their roles. This movie is worth watching. Jenifer Lewis does a great job playing Tina's mother. This is without any doubt one of the best true story movies ever to come out. I would definitely recommend it to friends. Get the CD soundtrack of this movie, too. You will enjoy that as well. Tina Turner is one of the greatest entertainers in the music industry!! Way to go, Tina!!Additional note: Ike Turner passed away on December 12, 2007 at the age of 76. Even though he passed on, that DOES NOT mean that this movie should be trashed and/or not be liked anymore by the many people who have liked it since its release in 1993 (or anytime after). It's a movie like any other movie--you either like it or you don't like it. And, it will still continue to cultivate new fans while keeping the older ones who have liked or loved it since its original release. Even after his passing, Ike will still be regarded as a controversial person in music history, regardless of how he was portrayed in this film and/or in Tina's autobiography. Just because he's gone doesn't mean that anyone who hasn't liked him in general (or beyond), whether by seeing this movie and/or reading Tina's book, or listening to his music would soften their own opinion (or, if so, maybe just a little bit).",5,The Success of Tina = the Crucifixion of Ike,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,3416,"['really', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Based', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'life', 'book', 'Tina', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'movie', 'formerly', 'known', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bullock', 'little', 'girl', 'singing', 'church', 'choir', 'sync', 'rest', 'group', 'where', 'evicted', 'church', 'Years', 'later', 'teen', 'late', '50s', 'St.', 'Louis', 'live', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'walked', 'out', 'years', 'Soon', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'name', 'her', 'started', 'singer', 'get', 'married', 'shortly', 'later', 'first', 'really', 'sweet', 'kind', 'while', 'marriage', 'going', 'downhill', 'Ike', 'pressured', 'stressed', 'out', 'own', 'career', 'narcotics', 'jealous', 'Tina', 'success', 'where', 'very', 'volatile', 'abusive', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'are', 'so', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'where', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'are', 'doing', 'own', 'version', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'Proud', 'Mary', 'so', 'wonderful', 'when', 'crowd', 'cheering', 'performance', 'Tina', 'cheering', 'Ike', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'crowd', 'while', 'Tina', 'abused', 'Ike', 'again', 'last', 'straw', 'quietly', 'away', 'hotel', 'street', 'taking', 'nap', 'hotel', 'had', 'checked', 'court', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'name', 'what', 'seen', 'movie', 'Tina', 'very', 'successful', 'career', 'crucifixion', 'Ike', 'happening', 'same', 'time', 'sometime', 'later', 'flowers', 'give', 'chance', 'promises', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'treat', 'better', 'last', 'time', 'not', 'accept', 'promise', 'nobody', 'would', 'disagree', 'out', 'new', 'car', 'slams', 'car', 'door', 'so', 'hard', 'glass', 'window', 'shatters', 'What', 'way', 'Tina', 'tell', 'Ike', 'get', 'lost', 'knew', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'own', 'Ike', 'Good', 'Tina', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'were', 'great', 'roles', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Tina', 'mother', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'true', 'story', 'movies', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'friends', 'Get', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'too', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'one', 'greatest', 'entertainers', 'music', 'industry', 'Way', 'go', 'Tina', 'Additional', 'note', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'passed', 'away', 'December', '12', '2007', 'age', '76', 'Even', 'passed', 'NOT', 'mean', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'trashed', 'not', 'be', 'liked', 'anymore', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'liked', 'release', '1993', 'anytime', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'will', 'still', 'continue', 'cultivate', 'new', 'fans', 'keeping', 'older', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'liked', 'loved', 'original', 'release', 'Even', 'passing', 'Ike', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'regarded', 'controversial', 'person', 'music', 'history', 'regardless', 'how', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'and/or', 'Tina', 'autobiography', 'Just', 'gone', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'liked', 'general', 'seeing', 'movie', 'reading', 'Tina', 'book', 'listening', 'music', 'would', 'soften', 'own', 'opinion', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'little', 'bit']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

351198,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,6303022928,M. Fields,"[2, 2]","Most of us agree that this was a great film.  However, it's the acting of Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett that keep me coming back to watch it over and over again.  Although Tina Turner's life proves of interest, it is of more interest to me to see how the actors bring their versions of Ike & Tina to life.  Clearly Bassett had the easier role because Tina's the one everyone is rooting for.  Fishburne on the other hand didn't want this role.  He thought it was too one dimensional.  Isn't the job of every good actor to find the other dimensions of a character though?  Once he found out that Bassett was in he signed on.  Fishburne's performance digs deep and lets us see a few glimpses into the mind of a man that treats women the way Ike treated Tina.  Fishburne's Ike Turner shows us an inner rage, jealousy and insecurity that another actor might not have thought to expose to us.  Just after a performance of Proud Mary the audience begins to scream, applaud and call out Tina, Tina, virtually ignoring Ike.  Fishburne shines as he interprets what Ike's reaction to that might have been (all done by facial expression).  Bewilderment, confusion, anger and jealousy.  The audience pours out love and affection for Tina but Ike stands in the shadows.  He is ignored again.  He's well known but not famous in his own right.  His fame is nonexistent without Tina.  He knows this deep down and it fuels his ever increasing hostility towards her.  Fisburne is particularly brilliant here.  Right after that scene comes the rape scene.  I don't know if that's when it actually happend but for continuity's sake it makes for a great transition from one film scene to the next.  Aside from all of that going on inside of the man, is the drug use which of course, makes everything ten times worse.  Fishburne is also responsible for some comedy relief as well.  Some of his lines are very funny.  Ike to Tina in the ambulance after Tina tries to commit suicide; ""If you don't make it I'll kill you, you hear me b***h, I'll kill you"".Ike to Tina after she comes home from the hospital (by herself) ""Oh hey Ann, feelin alright?  Listen, next time you want to take some time off, give a n****r some notice...""Angela Bassett is divine.  She works hard to give accurate perfomances.  She had Tina's moves down pat.  Although she can sing, her singing was dubbed with Tina's voice for obvious reasons.  Tina's voice is just too distinctive to be copied.  Laurence on the other hand did do his own singing) Bassett and Fishburne work very well together and I hope to see them in film together more in the years to come ( she probably would have been great in The Matrix).  Bassett never gives us anything less than extraordinary.The rape scene in the film is so well done that I can't watch it.  It's too disturbing for me but it's brilliant.  It's full of rage and anger and it had absolutely nothing to do with sexual gratification.  There is another sex scene in the film just so that you're forewarned.  Bassett and Fishburne do not object to sex scenes but neither of them do nude scenes I'm happy to say.  I could do without the sex scenes altogehter but that's just my personal preference.The timeline in the film is not accurate.  You have to read I Tina to realize that though.  And of course, the film takes liberties with things and tends to spin in some things that did not happen the way you see them on screen.  The first child that Tina gave birth to was fathered by a member of the band, not Ike.  Also, Tina states that she thought Ike was kind of ugly when she first saw him but the film turns that around to make a better film I suppose.  The film is acccurate in terms of the fashions as the decades go by.  Fishburne goes from processed hair to Beatle cut to afro and finally a natural style much as you would see him today.  Much attention was paid to the costumes as well.  Bell bottoms, miniskirts and platform shoes,etc.I suppose we must give Ike credit for recognizing Tina's talent even if he did try to parlay that into a career for himself.  In the end though he did not reap the benefits of all that.  You can't gain talent by osmosis.  It has to be inside you to start with.  While it is true that without Ike there wouldn't be a Tina Turner, it is also true that no one would know who Ike Turner is if there had been no Tina!My pet peeve with this film is it's ending.  During the last concert scene, the scene cuts from Bassett to Tina singing What's Love Got to do With It.  This is a diservice to Bassett and I find it insulting for Bassett not to have been allowed to follow through.  In fact, it annoys me so much that I stop the movie right after Fishburne's last scene cuts.I find the flaws in this film forgivable due to the quality of the project as a whole.  All being said and done this film is powerful and I reccomend it to you highly.",5,Rougher!,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,4878,"['Most', 'agree', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'However', 'acting', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'life', 'proves', 'interest', 'more', 'interest', 'see', 'how', 'actors', 'bring', 'versions', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'life', 'Clearly', 'Bassett', 'had', 'easier', 'role', 'Tina', 'one', 'everyone', 'rooting', 'Fishburne', 'other', 'hand', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', ""n't"", 'job', 'good', 'actor', 'find', 'other', 'dimensions', 'character', 'Once', 'found', 'out', 'Bassett', 'was', 'signed', 'Fishburne', 'performance', 'digs', 'deep', 'see', 'few', 'glimpses', 'mind', 'man', 'women', 'way', 'Ike', 'treated', 'Tina', 'Fishburne', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'inner', 'rage', 'jealousy', 'insecurity', 'actor', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'expose', 'Just', 'performance', 'Proud', 'Mary', 'audience', 'scream', 'applaud', 'call', 'out', 'Tina', 'Tina', 'virtually', 'ignoring', 'Ike', 'Fishburne', 'shines', 'what', 'Ike', 'reaction', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'facial', 'expression', 'Bewilderment', 'confusion', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'audience', 'out', 'love', 'affection', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'shadows', 'ignored', 'again', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'famous', 'own', 'right', 'fame', 'nonexistent', 'Tina', 'deep', 'down', 'ever', 'increasing', 'hostility', 'Fisburne', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'here', 'Right', 'scene', 'rape', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'actually', 'happend', 'continuity', 'sake', 'great', 'transition', 'one', 'film', 'scene', 'next', 'Aside', 'going', 'man', 'drug', 'use', 'course', 'everything', 'ten', 'times', 'worse', 'Fishburne', 'also', 'responsible', 'comedy', 'relief', 'as', 'well', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'ambulance', 'Tina', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'hear', ""'ll"", 'kill', '.Ike', 'Tina', 'home', 'hospital', 'Oh', 'hey', 'Ann', 'feelin', 'alright', 'Listen', 'next', 'time', 'want', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'give', 'n****r', 'notice', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'divine', 'hard', 'give', 'accurate', 'perfomances', 'had', 'Tina', 'moves', 'down', 'pat', 'can', 'sing', 'singing', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Tina', 'voice', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Tina', 'voice', 'just', 'too', 'distinctive', 'be', 'copied', 'Laurence', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'hope', 'see', 'film', 'together', 'more', 'years', 'come', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Matrix', 'Bassett', 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'extraordinary.The', 'rape', 'scene', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'too', 'disturbing', 'brilliant', 'full', 'rage', 'anger', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'sex', 'scene', 'film', 'just', 'so', ""'re"", 'forewarned', 'Bassett', 'Fishburne', 'do', 'not', 'object', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'nude', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'could', 'do', 'sex', 'scenes', 'altogehter', 'just', 'personal', 'preference.The', 'timeline', 'film', 'not', 'accurate', 'have', 'read', 'Tina', 'realize', 'though', 'course', 'film', 'liberties', 'things', 'tends', 'spin', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'way', 'see', 'screen', 'first', 'child', 'Tina', 'gave', 'birth', 'was', 'fathered', 'member', 'band', 'not', 'Ike', 'Also', 'Tina', 'thought', 'Ike', 'was', 'kind', 'ugly', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'make', 'better', 'film', 'suppose', 'film', 'acccurate', 'terms', 'fashions', 'decades', 'go', 'Fishburne', 'processed', 'hair', 'Beatle', 'cut', 'afro', 'finally', 'natural', 'style', 'much', 'would', 'see', 'today', 'Much', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'costumes', 'as', 'well', 'Bell', 'bottoms', 'miniskirts', 'platform', 'shoes', 'etc.I', 'suppose', 'must', 'give', 'Ike', 'credit', 'recognizing', 'Tina', 'talent', 'even', 'did', 'try', 'parlay', 'career', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'reap', 'benefits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gain', 'talent', 'osmosis', 'be', 'inside', 'start', 'true', 'Ike', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'also', 'true', 'one', 'would', 'know', 'who', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'Tina', 'pet', 'peeve', 'film', 'ending', 'last', 'concert', 'scene', 'scene', 'cuts', 'Bassett', 'Tina', 'singing', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'do', 'diservice', 'Bassett', 'find', 'insulting', 'Bassett', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'follow', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'stop', 'movie', 'right', 'Fishburne', 'last', 'scene', 'cuts.I', 'find', 'flaws', 'film', 'forgivable', 'due', 'quality', 'project', 'whole', 'being', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'powerful', 'reccomend', 'highly']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

351200,AJK5WHV1GW941,6303022928,Mikeisha Best,"[1, 1]","""What's Love Got to do with It?"" hit movie theatres in 1993.  The movie stars Angela Bassett (the best actress in Hollywood, in my opinion), and Laurence Fishburne.  This movie is a biography of singer Tina Turner.  It shows just how dramatic her life has been.  It also shows how she overcame the triumph that tried to stand in her way.I read all of the reviews on this website for this movie and I totally agree with those who said that Angela's performance is stellar. It's true, she does not look like Tina Turner, but because she played her role so well, one is easily able to see the similarities in the two women.  Laurence did a great job as Ike Turner.  Tina Turner wrote an autobiography entitled ""I, Tina.""  This movie does not go into the detail that the book does, but what movie does?  What movie can?  A movie that attempts to cover everything a book does would be way too long and drawn out.  But this movie definitely covers enough for those who view it to see how much this woman went through. It should also be noted that I have never seen someone perform someone else's music as well as Angela did.  She had the lip syncing down really well, and those dance moves Angela did were just the way Tina does them!  She will have you in awe!The movie begins with Tina Turner as a young girl singing in her church choir.  She is depicted as a defiant child. It also shows that Tina's father left her at an early age.  As the movie progresses, Tina gets older and still has an interest in singing.  She goes to clubs and sees artists and wishes she could sing with them.  One day her sister forces her upon the stage and she sings and Ike Turner is impressed and wants her to sing with his band, The Kings of Rhythm.  She obliges to singing with his band.  From the beginning, Ike is very controlling and works Tina especially hard, wanting her to get every singing note correct.  After spending time together, they become attracted to each other.  They then become a couple, and eventually get married.  At first, Ike is fairly nice to her, but as they begin to tour and things get harder, Ike starts getting involved in drugs and begins to physically abuse Tina.  He even beats their children.  Ike and Tina Turner had much success as a duo.  But after awhile they aren't quite as successful as when they started.  Music producers show an interest in working with Tina and Ike gets jealous.  He becomes even more violent and begins to cheat on her with other women.  In Tina's book, she said that throughout the course of their relationship, Ike had over 100 girlfriends.Tina eventually leaves Ike and he goes to jail for drug abuse.  Tina becomes very successful on her own with hits like ""What's Love Got to do With It?"" , ""Private Dancer"", ""I Don't Wanna Fight No More"" and ""Simply the Best"".  I strongly recommend this movie to someone looking for some true entertainment.  But, someone who does not like violence has no business watching this movie.

It's kind of a story of a woman getting out on top against all odds.  The audience is treated to Tina's modest upbringing, the start of her musical career and her horrific marriage to Ike Turner.  If you're expecting this to be a little overdramatic then you'd be right because some parts of this can seem over-the-top.  Despite this though, you will find yourself engrossed in this true life story.Undoubtedly the best points about this movie are the performances.  Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne as Tina and Ike are just outstanding.  Whilst Fishburne manages to really get across just how terribly resilient and ongoing Ike was, Bassett brings a likeable sense of vulnerability and, in the end, strength in her role.  In particular, when we see her perform all those famous Tina numbers, she gets the movement down to a tee, so much to the extent that when the real Tina comes on stage, there's little difference.Although the formula itself may be a little familiar to anyone who watches TV movies, this is a cut above the usual domestic abuse dramas.",4,Faithful Biopic,1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,1160,"['life', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'big', 'screen', 'story', 'reasonably', 'enthralling', 'biopic', 'kind', 'story', 'woman', 'getting', 'out', 'top', 'odds', 'audience', 'treated', 'Tina', 'modest', 'upbringing', 'start', 'musical', 'career', 'horrific', 'marriage', 'Ike', 'Turner', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'little', 'overdramatic', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'parts', 'can', 'seem', 'over-the-top', 'though', 'will', 'find', 'engrossed', 'true', 'life', 'story.Undoubtedly', 'best', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'performances', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'are', 'just', 'outstanding', 'Whilst', 'Fishburne', 'really', 'get', 'just', 'how', 'terribly', 'resilient', 'ongoing', 'Ike', 'was', 'Bassett', 'likeable', 'sense', 'vulnerability', 'end', 'strength', 'role', 'particular', 'when', 'see', 'perform', 'famous', 'Tina', 'numbers', 'movement', 'down', 'tee', 'so', 'much', 'extent', 'when', 'real', 'Tina', 'stage', 'little', 'formula', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'TV', 'movies', 'cut', 'usual', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'dramas']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

I suppose it is really hard to do justice to a living artist in a biopic, but the people who made RAY and WALK THE LINE did a superb job, in my opinion.  I was bothered by two things: the acting and appearance of Angela Bassett and the one-sidedness of the story.  Angela certainly tried hard and obviously a whole lot of people loved her performance.  I wasn't one of them.  True, she mastered Tina's facial gestures and movements but she missed the essence.  Whenever I see Tina I see joyful exuberance; when I saw Angela-as-Tina, I saw painful frenzy.  Well, maybe back in the days Tina was with Ike, her performances were pained; I only saw her in her latter post-Ike days.  Angela certainly did try hard and I give her credit for that, but, physically and emotionally, she is just not Tina.  She is scrawny and bony and perhaps should have gained weight for the role.  She played the innocent, perky country girl well and the long-suffering victim well, but I didn't find her believable in the strong and victorious parts.  I was relieved to see the real Tina in the final scene--a woman with some meat on her bones and spunk in her singing.  As for the story, as has already been mentioned here, it's one-sided.  Ike must have had something going for him for Tina to have stayed with him for 18 years.  She is portrayed as the complete angel-victim and he is the complete devil.  I don't believe it and others here have filled in the story with some facts that the movie ignored.  I can see why Fishburne originally refused the role, as one-dimensional.  He does very well with what he was given, but a much better picture could have been made out of a more realistic and balanced rendering of both characters.",3,Disappointing and simplistic,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,1772,"['love', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'expected', 'better', 'film', 'suppose', 'really', 'hard', 'do', 'justice', 'living', 'artist', 'biopic', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'RAY', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'opinion', 'was', 'bothered', 'two', 'things', 'acting', 'appearance', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'one-sidedness', 'story', 'Angela', 'certainly', 'tried', 'hard', 'obviously', 'whole', 'lot', 'people', 'loved', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'True', 'mastered', 'Tina', 'facial', 'gestures', 'movements', 'missed', 'essence', 'Whenever', 'see', 'Tina', 'see', 'joyful', 'exuberance', 'when', 'saw', 'Angela-as-Tina', 'saw', 'painful', 'frenzy', 'Well', 'maybe', 'back', 'days', 'Tina', 'was', 'Ike', 'performances', 'were', 'pained', 'only', 'saw', 'latter', 'post-Ike', 'days', 'Angela', 'certainly', 'did', 'try', 'hard', 'give', 'credit', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'just', 'not', 'Tina', 'scrawny', 'bony', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'gained', 'weight', 'role', 'played', 'innocent', 'perky', 'country', 'girl', 'well', 'long-suffering', 'victim', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'believable', 'strong', 'victorious', 'parts', 'was', 'relieved', 'see', 'real', 'Tina', 'final', 'scene', 'woman', 'meat', 'bones', 'spunk', 'singing', 'story', 'already', 'been', 'mentioned', 'here', 'one-sided', 'Ike', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'Tina', 'have', 'stayed', '18', 'years', 'portrayed', 'complete', 'angel-victim', 'complete', 'devil', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'filled', 'story', 'facts', 'movie', 'ignored', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Fishburne', 'originally', 'refused', 'role', 'one-dimensional', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'realistic', 'balanced', 'rendering', 'characters']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

First, it goes without saying that Tina is an icon...these young girls of today can't hold a candle to Ms. Turner!  Angela Bassett shines in her portrayal of this iconic diva/songstress through the years.  We see Anna Mae Bullock's childhood in Nutbush, Tennessee when she belts out hymns in church with her already powerful voice.  We see her as a sweet, shy country girl traveling to the big city where her talent is discovered by the Svengali who becomes her husband/manager...Ike Turner.  We feel the emotional and mental anguish she suffers at his hands with each brutal blow. We cheer for her success.  And finally, we rejoice when she finds the strength to walk away from this toxic relationship and reclaim her life on her own terms.  It remains as moving as it was nearly 20 years ago when it first came out.  Nearly all of Tina's hits (my favorite songs) are featured in this film, especially the title soundtrack ""What's Love Got to Do With It"".I agree with the other reviewers...this movie is definitely a must-see. It is especially important for anyone who has ever been trapped in an abusive situation, to show them that they too can find the strength within to walk away because they deserve better.  I've always been an enormous fan of Tina Turner not only because of her talent, but because her story speaks to me on a human level.  She starts out as a girl unsure of herself, her spirit broken, but in the end she emerges as a self-actualized woman.  Some might view this as a story of feminist empowerment but it is really about love...learning to love yourself and severing ties with destructive people.  It reminds me of Maya Angelou's two poems ""Still I Rise"" and ""Phenomenal Woman"".  These poems remind me of Tina because despite the abuse, she found a way to keep going and she came out on top in the end.Overall, five stars for a riveting performance by Angela Bassett!",5,Still She Rises...,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1950,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'First', 'saying', 'Tina', 'icon', 'young', 'girls', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'shines', 'portrayal', 'iconic', 'diva/songstress', 'years', 'see', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'Bullock', 'childhood', 'Nutbush', 'Tennessee', 'when', 'belts', 'out', 'hymns', 'church', 'already', 'powerful', 'voice', 'see', 'sweet', 'shy', 'country', 'girl', 'traveling', 'big', 'city', 'where', 'talent', 'discovered', 'Svengali', 'who', 'husband/manager', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'feel', 'emotional', 'mental', 'anguish', 'hands', 'brutal', 'blow', 'cheer', 'success', 'finally', 'rejoice', 'when', 'strength', 'walk', 'away', 'toxic', 'relationship', 'reclaim', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'as', 'moving', 'was', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Nearly', 'Tina', 'hits', 'favorite', 'songs', 'are', 'featured', 'film', 'especially', 'title', 'soundtrack', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'especially', 'important', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'trapped', 'abusive', 'situation', 'show', 'too', 'can', 'find', 'strength', 'walk', 'away', 'deserve', 'better', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'enormous', 'fan', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'not', 'only', 'talent', 'story', 'speaks', 'human', 'level', 'out', 'girl', 'unsure', 'herself', 'spirit', 'broken', 'end', 'self-actualized', 'woman', 'might', 'view', 'story', 'feminist', 'empowerment', 'really', 'love', 'learning', 'love', 'severing', 'ties', 'destructive', 'people', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'two', 'poems', 'Still', 'Rise', 'Phenomenal', 'Woman', 'poems', 'remind', 'Tina', 'abuse', 'found', 'way', 'keep', 'going', 'came', 'out', 'top', 'end.Overall', 'five', 'stars', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Bassett']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[4, 5]","The deification of St. Tina and the deserved crucifixion of Ike, starring the magnificent Angela Bassett, is harrowing and crackling with electricity. Perhaps the only movie with more domestic violence than *Mommie Dearest*, this is the movie bio to end all movie bios. From the earliest scenes of a rambunctious Tina (or Anna Mae, as she was known then) acting up during choir practice, we, the audience, belong to her completely, irrevocably winning us through empathy and admirationfor such a feisty, plucky spirit. Showing Ike as a famous R&B; star and suave ladykiller at the time he meets the young Tina, Ike wins her through a combination of persistence and flattery, appealing to her vanity and sense of loyalty (""I make them famous and then they run off,"" Ike tells her). But they team up and, as we know, and make musical history. Their codependency is of the direst sort - he *made* her and feels like he owns her, and she just wants to please him. But pleasing Ike is a tall order, and any success is only temporary. We are taken on a wild ride of spectacular performances in vivid color - both the great achievements of the duo, as well as their darkest hours, but as Ike slides into drugs and domination, the situation is as hopeless as most codependent situations are. We see Tina as she is, once again, beaten to a pulp...but perhaps for the last time. She runs away, and with a wrenching scene in which she appears in the lobby of the neighboring Ramada Inn, begging for shelter, we are begging with her, praying for some nameless act of charity to deliver her from evil. She makes a relatively clean getaway, winding up in the hands of Roger Davies, her manager (and a producer of this film), who engineered one of the greatest comebacks in history. Of course, Ike tries desperately and unsuccessfully to woo her back, telling her how he *made* her, but then becomes ridiculous, uttering to her in 1980, ""You ain't no Donna Summers."" But we know what the outcome of that is - Tina's personal success and lifetime appointment as posterchild for Survivors Anonymous is legendary. Angela Bassett is one of the finest actresses alive, but has yet to produce anything rivaling this performance. She is backed up by a number of extremely strong performances, especially that of Vanessa Bell, in a stand-up performance as her friend Jackie, who not only proves to Tina that she can escape from Ike, but also shows her a way to inner-peace through Buddhism. During the closing credits, we see the real-life Tina perform the title song, but it is a gratuitous, and even negligent performance, that undermines the audience's belief in Basset as Tina. The crime is that this film did not receive Academy attention - for art direction and costuming alone, it is the exquisite evocation of an extremely lively era and lifestyle - as an almost perfect production, it meshes together the cinematography, script, acting and music into a dazzling and sometimes horrifying, but always riveting tour de force.",4,Even More Domestic Violence Than *Mommie Dearest*,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3008,"['deification', 'St.', 'Tina', 'deserved', 'crucifixion', 'Ike', 'starring', 'magnificent', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'harrowing', 'crackling', 'electricity', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'movie', 'more', 'domestic', 'violence', '*Mommie', 'Dearest*', 'movie', 'bio', 'end', 'movie', 'bios', 'earliest', 'scenes', 'rambunctious', 'Tina', 'Anna', 'Mae', 'was', 'known', 'then', 'acting', 'up', 'choir', 'practice', 'audience', 'belong', 'completely', 'irrevocably', 'winning', 'empathy', 'admirationfor', 'such', 'feisty', 'plucky', 'spirit', 'Showing', 'Ike', 'famous', 'R', 'B', 'star', 'suave', 'ladykiller', 'time', 'young', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'combination', 'persistence', 'flattery', 'appealing', 'vanity', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'make', 'famous', 'then', 'run', 'off', 'Ike', 'team', 'up', 'know', 'make', 'musical', 'history', 'codependency', 'direst', 'sort', 'feels', 'just', 'please', 'pleasing', 'Ike', 'tall', 'order', 'success', 'only', 'temporary', 'are', 'taken', 'wild', 'ride', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'vivid', 'color', 'great', 'achievements', 'duo', 'as', 'well', 'darkest', 'hours', 'Ike', 'drugs', 'domination', 'situation', 'as', 'hopeless', 'most', 'codependent', 'situations', 'are', 'see', 'Tina', 'once', 'again', 'beaten', 'pulp', 'perhaps', 'last', 'time', 'away', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'lobby', 'neighboring', 'Ramada', 'Inn', 'begging', 'shelter', 'are', 'begging', 'praying', 'nameless', 'act', 'charity', 'deliver', 'evil', 'relatively', 'clean', 'getaway', 'winding', 'up', 'hands', 'Roger', 'Davies', 'manager', 'producer', 'film', 'who', 'engineered', 'one', 'greatest', 'comebacks', 'history', 'course', 'Ike', 'desperately', 'unsuccessfully', 'woo', 'back', 'telling', 'how', 'then', 'ridiculous', 'uttering', '1980', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Donna', 'Summers', 'know', 'what', 'outcome', 'Tina', 'personal', 'success', 'lifetime', 'appointment', 'posterchild', 'Survivors', 'Anonymous', 'legendary', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'alive', 'yet', 'produce', 'anything', 'rivaling', 'performance', 'backed', 'up', 'number', 'extremely', 'strong', 'performances', 'especially', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'stand-up', 'performance', 'friend', 'Jackie', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Tina', 'can', 'escape', 'Ike', 'also', 'way', 'inner-peace', 'Buddhism', 'closing', 'credits', 'see', 'real-life', 'Tina', 'perform', 'title', 'song', 'gratuitous', 'even', 'negligent', 'performance', 'audience', 'belief', 'Basset', 'Tina', 'crime', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Academy', 'attention', 'art', 'direction', 'costuming', 'alone', 'exquisite', 'evocation', 'extremely', 'lively', 'era', 'lifestyle', 'almost', 'perfect', 'production', 'together', 'cinematography', 'script', 'acting', 'music', 'dazzling', 'sometimes', 'horrifying', 'always', 'riveting', 'tour', 'de', 'force']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

It has been the only movie that I have ever seen where I was very disturbed by the graphic violence and abuse that the film depicts. I knew Tina Turner experienced a very abusive relationship with her husband and mentor Ike Turner, but I had no idea she went through the hell that she did. The movie does contain it's share of violence, but the movie had to be honest in its portrayal of spousal abuse. It is not easy for most of us to watch a man beating his wife, but this is the truth of what Tina lived through. How Tina managed to survive is amazing in itself, as she left Ike Turner in July, 1976 with thirty six cents and a credit card to her name. The message in the film is clear: have faith in yourself and be strong and you will survive anything.The movie is based on Tina's autobiography ""I Tina"" that was released in 1986 to critical and commercial success, and if you think what you see in the film is bad, reading the pages of ""I Tina"" is even more harrowing. There are many incidents that occurred between Tina and Ike that were never dramatized in the film but are in the book. There were times that Ike would beat Tina so bad he would break her ribs, her jaw, and force her to go on stage and sing. The most disturbing part of the book and film are the scene in which Ike would beat Tina, then rape her.The movie is very hard to watch, but this is what the queen of rock and roll went through. She endured 18 years of hell with a monster who cared more about his drug addiction than his own wife. Tina is an example for all of us to look at. She survived to tell her own story.The DVD comes in widescreen with the trailer, and unfortunately no bonuses are included.Both Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburn, who play Tina and Ike, were nominated for Best Actress and Best Actor Oscars. Whitney Houston was chosen for the part of Tina, but had to drop out because of her impending pregnancy. The producers then cast Angela.The title of the film is derived from Tina Turner's #1 pop song ""What's Love Got To Do With It?"" that she released in 1984 in which she won multiple Grammy Awards for.A remarkable story of courage and survival.",5,"""Tina Turner's Life Story On Film""",1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2245,"['first', 'saw', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'theatres', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'June', '1993', 'been', 'only', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'was', 'very', 'disturbed', 'graphic', 'violence', 'abuse', 'film', 'depicts', 'knew', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'experienced', 'very', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'husband', 'mentor', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'had', 'idea', 'went', 'hell', 'did', 'movie', 'contain', 'share', 'violence', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'not', 'easy', 'most', 'watch', 'man', 'beating', 'wife', 'truth', 'what', 'Tina', 'lived', 'How', 'Tina', 'managed', 'survive', 'amazing', 'left', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'July', '1976', 'thirty', 'six', 'cents', 'credit', 'card', 'name', 'message', 'film', 'clear', 'have', 'faith', 'be', 'strong', 'will', 'survive', 'anything.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Tina', 'autobiography', 'Tina', 'was', 'released', '1986', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'think', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'bad', 'reading', 'pages', 'Tina', 'even', 'more', 'harrowing', 'are', 'many', 'incidents', 'occurred', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'were', 'never', 'dramatized', 'film', 'are', 'book', 'were', 'times', 'Ike', 'would', 'beat', 'Tina', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'break', 'ribs', 'jaw', 'force', 'go', 'stage', 'sing', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'scene', 'Ike', 'would', 'beat', 'Tina', 'then', 'rape', 'her.The', 'movie', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'what', 'queen', 'rock', 'roll', 'went', 'endured', '18', 'years', 'hell', 'monster', 'who', 'cared', 'more', 'drug', 'addiction', 'own', 'wife', 'Tina', 'example', 'look', 'survived', 'tell', 'own', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'trailer', 'unfortunately', 'bonuses', 'are', 'included.Both', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Laurence', 'Fishburn', 'who', 'play', 'Tina', 'Ike', 'were', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'was', 'chosen', 'part', 'Tina', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'impending', 'pregnancy', 'producers', 'then', 'cast', 'Angela.The', 'title', 'film', 'derived', 'Tina', 'Turner', '1', 'pop', 'song', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'released', '1984', 'won', 'multiple', 'Grammy', 'Awards', 'for.A', 'remarkable', 'story', 'courage', 'survival']",What's Love Got To Do With It?

351217,A4JHEO7H330AF,6303022928,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","This is a biopic about Anna Mae Bullock (a.k.a. Tina Turner) and Ike Turner.  This is your basic success-in-the-face-of-adversity story.  To start out with, Tina's Turner's beginnings were humble, to say the least.EARLY YEARS.  Tina Turner was born at a farm in Nutbush, a town in Tennessee.  Her parents abandoned her at a young age. She moved to Brownsville to stay with her grandmother.  Her grandmother died when she was 16, and her mother moved her to St. Louis.  The film starts by showing a precocious child (Tina as a 6-year old) singing in the church choir.  This episode is one of the best and most endearing depictions of cute, precocious children that have been committed to film. Then, the film shows the girl holding a singing cricket.  Truly, the use of a cricket as an analogy to Tina Turner's singing demonstrates that this movie is, at least to some extent, a work of art.  Without spending too much time with preliminaries, the film devotes a chunk of time to Tina Turner's audition with Ike Turner's band, and her rocket to success.  The film makes skillful use of faux archival footage from hand-held movie cameras that were available from the era.  The film provides a nice contrast between an auditioning woman, who flings her mouth wide open and screams hysterically (in attempt to please Ike Turner with her singing), and Tina Turner's own singing, which is measured and relatively subdued.  We learn that Ike Turner was an accomplished rhythm and blues composer, musician, and band leader.LATER YEARS.  The film demonstrates that Ike Turner was a fine composer, and that he was fully capable of adapting to the British invasion, and to changing his style from rhythm'n'blues to rock'n'roll.  However, the film also demonstrates that the man was not able to adapt to the fact that Tina Turner was, in a word, a better artist than he.  The result of Mr. Turner's failure was a string of arguments and fights.  The film shows Mr. Turner acting up at a family restaurant, in front of a couple of families.  The film shows Mr. Turner acting up at his recording studio, in front of a dozen guests.  The film shows Mr. Turner threatening Tina Turner with a gun.  Eventually, this film provides excellent footage of Tina Turner leading her own band.  The last minute of the film shows footage of the real Tina Turner, entertaining a real audience in a stadium.LIST OF OBSERVATIONS.  It is interesting that this film stars Angela Bassett and Lawrence Fishburne,who also starred together in AKEELAH AND THE BEE.  In AKEELAH AND THE BEE, Mr. Fishburne was the good guy, and Ms. Bassett was the bad guy.  But in WHAT'S LOVE HAVE TO DO WITH IT, Mr. Fishburne is the bad guy and Ms. Bassett is the good guy.  Surprisingly, this film seems to be totally free of racial issues, unlike the case with two other recent biopics, namely, MEN OF HONOR starring Cuba Gooding and TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, starring Laurence Fishburn and Cuba Gooding).  Although I am not sure that Tina Turner's compositions are as good as, or are as creative as, those of, e.g., THE WHO, CREAM, BEE GEEs, CROSBY STILLS & NASH, or MICHAEL JACKSON, the evidence available to me from other sources indicates that Tina Turner's musical career occupied the same lofty territory as these artists.  If an Amazon.com customer is interested in a biopic sheerly for the entertainment value for the concert performances, then the customer should be assured that, in this regard, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT delivers admirably.  If an Amazon.com customer is more interested in a biopic for its disclosure of human relationships and emotions, in this regard, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT also delivers admirably.  If the Amazon.com customer is interested in a relaxing movie where there are episodes where nothing much happens, then the customer will be disappointed by this film.

The abuse Tina suffers thru her husband Ike Turner was very disturbing, but Laurence Fishburne as Ike was pretty convincing, you hated his guts in this film! Angela Bassett as Tina was also very good. I only knew Tina Turner through her music but I didn't know she'd been abused like this...until I saw this film. When I first heard her song ""better be good to me"" at age 10, I had no idea she's been thru so much. It was a real eye opener for abuse victims/survivors. I just wish when they showed it on regular tv, they'd leave the scene where she runs into the Ramada hotel in the film, even though that scene makes me cry every cry every time I watch it, it's a very powerful scene, the whole movie is come to think of it.

351225,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,6303022928,William,"[3, 8]","Firstly, I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't think that Angela Bassett looked like Tina at all, but her performance was so convincing that this aspect became irrelevant that you could overlook this.The movie is only BASED ON the book ""I, Tina"" so could be why some of the scenes seem far-fetched.  This made me ask ""Was Tina consulted at all?"". The legend herself does make a cameo at the very end of the film.I, like others, would like to know what Tina really thought of the movie.  I do not believe she has ever commented.  Anyone know? Janet Jackson was originally tipped to play Tina.  Don't think that would have worked.DVD REVIEW:Why are film companies still releasing titles in non-anamorphic widescreen in 2003? A big no no! This film is 1:85 non-anamorphic and lacks any real sharpness. Features wise, the DVD comes with the trailer and some other film recommendations. A lost chance to include audio commentary from Tina Turner, or Angela Basset.  What about other extras like a documentary on Tina Turner. No, you dont get that either.
