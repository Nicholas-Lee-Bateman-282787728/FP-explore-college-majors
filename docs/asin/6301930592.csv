272910,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,6301930592,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[3, 7]","Alan Desland is a cultivated English bachelor who has taken over his family's antique porcelain business. On a business trip to Copenhagen, he meets and immediately falls in love with Karin, a stunning German beauty. After only a couple of weeks they marry, honeymoon, and settle into life in Alan's hometown. At first their erotically charged relationship seems like paradise, but this, of course, cannot last. Karin has told Alan virtually nothing of her past, and her dark secret eventually manifests with supernatural trappings and threatens everything.&quot;The Girl in a Swing&quot; is based on the 1980 novel by Richard &quot;Watership Down&quot; Adams. The film has one thing going for it; the script does an admirable job of lining up and hitting a good number of the novel's main plot points and scenes. Otherwise, this overwrought melodrama has little to recommend it.There is so much to criticize--from the passionless direction to the insipid soundtrack, awful costuming, and poor casting. Meg Tilly in the role of Karin is particularly troublesome. While she is a fairly attractive woman, she does not project the sort of unearthly eroticism that the character requires. Worse, her muddled, affected German accent obscures most of her dialogue. When Tilly isn't screeching &quot;Alan!&quot; she is mumbling and slurring her most important lines. Director Gordon Hessler does little to salvage things, as he opts to film most of the important supernatural and erotic sequences in one of two modes--either flat or melodramatic.While very few films adapted from novels can attain the dense subtext of their source material, such a film might at least evoke the essence of the story by establishing a strong mood consistent with the novelist's vision. This film, however, aspires to nothing so worthy. It neither succeeds as an adaptation of Adams' complex novel nor as a worthy cinematic effort in its own right.",2,A poor substitute for the novel.,998870400,"08 27, 2001",2001,1923,"['Alan', 'Desland', 'cultivated', 'English', 'bachelor', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'family', 'antique', 'porcelain', 'business', 'business', 'trip', 'Copenhagen', 'immediately', 'love', 'Karin', 'stunning', 'German', 'beauty', 'only', 'couple', 'weeks', 'marry', 'honeymoon', 'settle', 'life', 'Alan', 'hometown', 'first', 'erotically', 'charged', 'relationship', 'paradise', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'Karin', 'told', 'Alan', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'past', 'dark', 'secret', 'eventually', 'supernatural', 'trappings', 'everything.', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Swing', 'quot', 'based', '1980', 'novel', 'Richard', 'quot', 'Watership', 'Down', 'quot', 'Adams', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'script', 'admirable', 'job', 'lining', 'up', 'hitting', 'good', 'number', 'novel', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'scenes', 'Otherwise', 'overwrought', 'melodrama', 'little', 'recommend', 'it.There', 'so', 'much', 'criticize', 'passionless', 'direction', 'insipid', 'soundtrack', 'awful', 'costuming', 'poor', 'casting', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'role', 'Karin', 'particularly', 'troublesome', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'woman', 'not', 'project', 'sort', 'unearthly', 'eroticism', 'character', 'Worse', 'muddled', 'affected', 'German', 'accent', 'most', 'dialogue', 'When', 'Tilly', ""n't"", 'screeching', 'quot', 'Alan', 'quot', 'mumbling', 'slurring', 'most', 'important', 'lines', 'Director', 'Gordon', 'Hessler', 'little', 'salvage', 'things', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'supernatural', 'erotic', 'sequences', 'one', 'two', 'modes', 'flat', 'melodramatic.While', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'adapted', 'novels', 'can', 'attain', 'dense', 'subtext', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'might', 'least', 'evoke', 'essence', 'story', 'establishing', 'strong', 'mood', 'consistent', 'novelist', 'vision', 'film', 'however', 'aspires', 'nothing', 'so', 'worthy', 'neither', 'adaptation', 'Adams', 'complex', 'novel', 'worthy', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'own', 'right']",Girl in a Swing VHS

I happen to be a Meg Tilly fan, and I rather liked this film and her performance in it.  The film is based on a book by the author of &quot;Watership Down,&quot;  and it is a rather haunting love story.  The film concerns an English  antique collector who meets a young German woman on one of his trips.  They  fall in love, though the young woman has some dark secrets which she is  unwilling to reveal.  The film is at times a little frightening, and there  is a prevalent melancholic, supernatural atmosphere.  I have read the book,  and I think the film is at least equal, if not superior, to the  novel.Meg Tilly is an American actress but she assumes a rather thick  German accent for this film.  There is a dreamy, pensive quality to her  performance that fits in well with the tone of the film.  The film is an  English production, so perhaps it will seem too &quot;European&quot; for  the usual American audience.  Nonetheless, given the current revival of  spooky movies in the last few years, this is a film which certainly  deserves more attention than it received during its initial release in the  late 1980s.

The actors are not what I expected -- Desland is a bit too stiff and dorky, but he was in the book too, so he seems reasonably well cast, but Karen is supposed to be unbelievably beautiful and Meg Tilly doesn't seem so to me.  The film is slow in parts, but then so is the book. I thought it a great supernatural film, understated and creepy, for those that like horror without a lot of slasher nonsense.
