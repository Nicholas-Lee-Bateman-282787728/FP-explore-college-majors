In 2008, I met the actress who plays the class VP (who announces Angus's name in the trailer) and had been looking for it since then. Some stores had VHS copies but nothing else. I got a 48-hour rental and watched it twice.It's a good story and deals with a lot of the same-old issues that similar movies deal with. The ""fat kid"" likes the ""popular girl"" and doesn't have the confidence to go after her. The ending is pretty predictable, too. Acting and production are good, and you will find all the characters sympathetic and understandable (with the exception of the stereotypical jock).",3,good story,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,656,"['First', 'thank', 'Amazon', 'making', 'movie', 'available', '2008', 'met', 'actress', 'who', 'class', 'VP', 'who', 'Angus', 'name', 'trailer', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'then', 'stores', 'had', 'VHS', 'copies', 'nothing', 'else', 'got', '48-hour', 'rental', 'watched', 'twice.It', 'good', 'story', 'deals', 'lot', 'same-old', 'issues', 'similar', 'movies', 'deal', 'fat', 'kid', 'popular', 'girl', ""n't"", 'have', 'confidence', 'go', 'ending', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'too', 'Acting', 'production', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'understandable', 'exception', 'stereotypical', 'jock']",N/A

It has a little bit of everything...its hilarious, its emotional, it has a message that no matter what you look like, you can have your one moment that you've dreamed of. Angus is by no means a popular kid, but he knows what he's good at...science, football,..and breaking the nose of the egotistical, self-rightous jerk (James Van der beek) who is constantly giving him a hard time. Chris Owen plays Angus' nerdy little friend who is dedicated to helping them both look cooler and get the attention of girls. And we can't forget Kathy Bates, Angus' loving, protective trucker mother who is usually arguing with her father, played by George C. Scott. Charlie Talbert, who I had never heard of when I fist saw this movie, was PHENOMENAL as Angus! He's so natural...he pulled off the comedy, embarrassment, anger, frustration, obsession and heart-break that Angus goes through like a well-seasoned actor. Usually if a film has corny acting (which lets face it, there's plenty of THOSE kinds of movies out there) I usually won't sit through it the first time, let alone a second. This is a movie, I am happy to say, that I have been watching for over a decade and never get sick of. If you've never seen it, give it a chance.

1316743,AI7AJG2OS4XG,B003156IIO,Garm Transit,"[1, 2]",I've been against disc on demand since day one. Partly due to the cost. Which is unreasonable for every disc on demand release i've seen. Luckily i picked this up on the marketplace brand new for a really good price. Secondly I hate disc on demand because it's like a slap in the face from the studios to the actors and fans of whatever movie it is. It's like saying this movie isn't good enough to get an offficial release. For angus I made an exception. Again I couldn't pass up the price. Especially for a movie I loved as a kid. Still though I was skeptical on how the picture and sound would be on the DVD-R. I found the picture to be excellent. As good as anything offically released. The sound however at times was a bit quiet so you need to turn it up. Be careful though because when many of the 90s alternative rock songs are featured they tend to be loud. Overall I'm happy because I have this on DVD now. It just burns me that these billion dollar companies can't give some movies proper releases rather than screwing the consumer and making them pay more for less.

1316745,A2VHPR9KSADDIS,B003156IIO,"Kathleen Witt ""Kath""","[0, 0]","For the past 5 or 6 years I have done a literature unit in one of my English classes which includes the short story ""A Brief Moment in the Life of Angus Bethune"" and the novel Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes, both of which are by Chris Crutcher.  It was not until last year did I discover the movie Angus, which is based on ""A Brief Moment in the Life...""  I was really excited to find something that provides such a great opportunity for compare and contrast and general analysis.  This year I asked my students to write their own review of the movie.  Most of them include a comparison to the short story.NOTE: I encourage anyone who has not read the short story to do so.  It is interesting how a short story can be made into a full length movie.WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. These are excepts from the reviews which were written by students in grades 10-12.4/5 stars""I would tell other people to watch it.""4/5 stars""It is a pretty good movie.  Not perfect, but good.  They changed some big parts, and did it in a way that worked out.  It's one of those cheesy high school movies that you're embarrassed to admit made you sob like your mom watching the Hallmark channel.  I give his a four instead of a five because it was a good story, but very predictable.""3/5 stars""I think if they would have kept the movie more like the story, if would have been better, but they did add a few things that I did like.""4/5 stars ""I gave this movie a four star since...it had many things about Angus at home, at school, and at the dance.  I liked it when Angus kept punching Rick in the face.  The thing I didn't like was that his dad died and then his grandfather died on his (the grandfather's) wedding day.""3/5 stars ""In my opinion this movie gets a 3 star because it cuts out Angus' four parents being homosexual.  That was a major part of the story for me because that isn't very common, and I can see people using that to pick on someone.  Having one parent is incredibly common.  I did enjoy the addition of Troy's character.""3/5 stars ""I thought this movie was average because there were some confusing parts, but I would recommend this movie to a friend or family member.""4/5 stars ""All in all I think they did a decent job..."" The movie showed more details in the subjects that were just mentioned in the short story.  The movie showed more aspects in the real world than fiction like the story.""4.5/5 stars ""They kept very true to the story line without changing many major things.  The only thing that really bugged me with this movie was the fact that they made Angus and the others freshmen instead of seniors.  This, in a sense, caused the movie to seem a little bit more like a typical teenage drama when it came to the conflict between Angus and Rick instead of something more serious like if they were older.""4/5 ""I actually got into it and wanted to see what happened to Angus and if he actually got to go to the dance with Melissa.  Even though I knew that the story had them together at the end, the movie made it so I was not sure.""",4,Angus review from students,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,3055,"['past', '5', '6', 'years', 'have', 'done', 'literature', 'unit', 'one', 'English', 'classes', 'short', 'story', 'Brief', 'Moment', 'Life', 'Angus', 'Bethune', 'novel', 'Staying', 'Fat', 'Sarah', 'Byrnes', 'are', 'Chris', 'Crutcher', 'was', 'not', 'last', 'year', 'did', 'discover', 'movie', 'Angus', 'based', 'A', 'Brief', 'Moment', 'Life', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'find', 'something', 'great', 'opportunity', 'compare', 'contrast', 'general', 'analysis', 'year', 'asked', 'students', 'write', 'own', 'review', 'movie', 'Most', 'include', 'comparison', 'short', 'story.NOTE', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'do', 'so', 'interesting', 'how', 'short', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'full', 'length', 'movie.WARNING', 'FOLLOWING', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', 'are', 'excepts', 'reviews', 'were', 'written', 'students', 'grades', '10-12.4/5', 'stars', 'would', 'tell', 'other', 'people', 'watch', '4/5', 'stars', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'perfect', 'good', 'changed', 'big', 'parts', 'did', 'way', 'worked', 'out', 'one', 'cheesy', 'high', 'school', 'movies', ""'re"", 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'made', 'sob', 'mom', 'watching', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'give', 'four', 'instead', 'five', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'predictable', '3/5', 'stars', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'movie', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'did', 'add', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'like', '4/5', 'stars', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'star', 'had', 'many', 'things', 'Angus', 'home', 'school', 'dance', 'liked', 'when', 'Angus', 'kept', 'punching', 'Rick', 'face', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'dad', 'died', 'then', 'grandfather', 'died', 'grandfather', 'wedding', 'day', '3/5', 'stars', 'opinion', 'movie', '3', 'star', 'out', 'Angus', 'four', 'parents', 'being', 'homosexual', 'was', 'major', 'part', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'common', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'using', 'pick', 'someone', 'Having', 'one', 'parent', 'incredibly', 'common', 'did', 'enjoy', 'addition', 'Troy', 'character', '3/5', 'stars', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'average', 'were', 'confusing', 'parts', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'friend', 'family', 'member', '4/5', 'stars', 'think', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'movie', 'showed', 'more', 'details', 'subjects', 'were', 'just', 'mentioned', 'short', 'story', 'movie', 'showed', 'more', 'aspects', 'real', 'world', 'fiction', 'story', '4.5/5', 'stars', 'kept', 'very', 'true', 'story', 'line', 'changing', 'many', 'major', 'things', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'bugged', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'made', 'Angus', 'others', 'freshmen', 'instead', 'seniors', 'sense', 'caused', 'movie', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'typical', 'teenage', 'drama', 'when', 'came', 'conflict', 'Angus', 'Rick', 'instead', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'were', 'older', '4/5', 'actually', 'got', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Angus', 'actually', 'got', 'go', 'dance', 'Melissa', 'Even', 'knew', 'story', 'had', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'was', 'not', 'sure']",N/A
