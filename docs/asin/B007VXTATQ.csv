1538962,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007VXTATQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 12]","Every generation needs its great stoner comedies! Who better than vocal supporters of the smoke, Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa, to usher in a cool and contemporary new vision of high times at high school? Seemed like a great idea and I was actually rooting for ""Mac and Devin Go To High School"" to be a mind altering good time. Aside from a few amusing ideas, though, this Snoop Dogg production harshed my mellow. Painfully unfunny and utterly plotless, this barely even qualifies as a movie. Form start to finish, it runs just over an hour which includes two full musical numbers and a series of unrelated man-on-the-street interviews to serve as filler. Without these elements, it would be more like forty minutes. Even that might be acceptable if the movie offered any entertainment value. Not even half-baked does this qualify as fun. Its humor is almost non-existent, its performances are lifeless, and its graphics are amateurish (seriously, the special effects are done on someone's home computer so don't expect any big fun psychedelic interludes). Heck, it works more as an educational film about chronic than anything else. Even the worst stoner comedies embrace their over-the-top silliness, I just can't believe how dull this is!The movie starts out great. A talking blunt named Slow Burn (voiced by Mystikal) introduces the film and is both amusing and creative. Forget about the ""real"" actors, I'd have preferred the entire story to revolve around Slow Burn! He pops up once or twice more and is the only character that I thought was interesting. Snoop Dogg plays a high school student who's in his fifteenth year as a senior (his actual age would probably put that at closer to 20 or 25). He's the resident bad boy and dealer, a rebel that everyone loves and all women want to be with. Wiz Khalifa, on the other hand, plays an uptight scholar looking to make a success of his life. Of course, being educated, working hard, or being ambitious are all attributes worthy of scorn as the screenplay continually tells us. Snoop takes Khalifa under his wing and the pair spend the rest of the movie smoking. That's about all the plot you get aside from a throw-away side story where Snoop must graduate to get with a hot substitute teacher. Serious drama! I mean what woman in her right mind wouldn't think he was a catch?Again, I wasn't expecting ""Mac and Devin Go To High School"" to be some big epic. I just wanted it to be funny. The soundtrack, which came out seven months ago, has the hit ""Young, Wild, and Free"" which gets a big production number at the graduation ceremony. But trust me, the music doesn't save you from the utter boredom of the rest of the movie. Mike Epps is wasted in a small role and Andy Milonakis (who I generally like) is quite annoying. But as loud and over-the-top as Milonakis is, at least he's trying to breathe some life into the film! Stoned or stone cold sober, this was a big disappointment that felt completely homemade. Should have been stupid fun, but its not even smart enough to reach for that.

1538963,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007VXTATQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Comedies revolving around drug use or drinking have been around for quite a while. The same is true of movie about teenagers and going to high school. So it would seem an easy task to combine these two genres and end up with a decent film right? Wrong!MAC AND DEVIN GO TO HIGH SCHOOL is one of the worst attempts at making a movie that I've ever forced myself to witness. The jokes range from unfunny to stale and the references to marijuana feel forced. It just isn't funny.The plot is minimal at best. Devin (Whiz Khalifa) is an honors student who's working on his valedictorian speech for graduation. Mac (Snoop Dogg) is a 15 year student at N. Hawthorne High School where he's the weed supplier for everyone from the students to the faculty. The two are thrown together for a science project. If Devin can pull this off he becomes the valedictorian. If Mac can assist, he graduates. Failure to do so means expulsion. Where most movies with a story like this have each learn something from the other, here we just have Devin learn the values of loosening up and getting high.All I could think of while watching was how is it possible for someone as old as Snoop to still even be allowed to be in a school. His character is so blatant about his weed usage and distribution it's near impossible to believe he's never been arrested in this town. Worse yet is the jokes told here. Their all sophomoric at best and terrible at worst. The jokes in this film make old stoner Cheech and Chong jokes seem sophisticated.There is nothing about this film that was enjoyable. If you watched it in fast forward mode it wouldn't be enjoyable. This is one movie that is best left untouched. If the topic is what you're looking for pull out a Cheech and Chong CD of movie and enjoy those instead.

It is designed to be cheesy and campy with names like ""N. Hale High School"" and ""Ralph Skinnfloot"". It has an immaturity appeal to it. The plot is immaterial and the film would have been better as a ""Groovetube"" type film than trying to follow a plot about an old pot dealer in HIGH school.The humor was re-hashed (pardon my drug pun) jokes and dialouge that would indeed sound better stoned. The movie suggests that you smoke pot continuously. Even seasoned pot smokers know better than that. The cartoon aspect of the film was good as was the talking joint with the bloodshot eyes. If they had incorporated the joint into the film, rather than someone talking as an aside, I think that would have been more entertaining to a stoned audience.Parental Guide: Over abundance of F-bombs and N-words.
