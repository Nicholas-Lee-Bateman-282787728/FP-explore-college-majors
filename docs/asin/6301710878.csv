With the narration I found myself thinking I might be on the History Channel. It does in fact give a fairly accurate account of the trials of the Nez Perce in trying to find a way to deal with the influx of settlers to their hunting grounds. Since the US Calvary was given the task to round all Native Americans up and put them on a reservation and many European settlers didn't care about their rights, it was often done with a heavy hand. This is not an easy movie to watch as you will see cruelty and killing, but it is a historically educational movie that everyone should see at least once. Parts of it are fascinating as we see Chief Joseph lead the Calvary for a merry chase through several areas of Iowa and adjoining states, but sometimes it drags a little. Good quality DVD with limited replay. I recommend this as a rental first before purchasing.",3,I Will Fight No More Forever,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,922,"['almost', 'more', 'documentary', 'movie', 'narration', 'found', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'History', 'Channel', 'fact', 'give', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'account', 'trials', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'influx', 'settlers', 'hunting', 'grounds', 'US', 'Calvary', 'was', 'given', 'task', 'round', 'Native', 'Americans', 'up', 'put', 'reservation', 'many', 'European', 'settlers', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'rights', 'was', 'often', 'done', 'heavy', 'hand', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'cruelty', 'killing', 'historically', 'educational', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'Parts', 'are', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'lead', 'Calvary', 'merry', 'chase', 'several', 'areas', 'Iowa', 'adjoining', 'states', 'little', 'Good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'limited', 'replay', 'recommend', 'rental', 'first', 'purchasing']",N/A
262876,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6301710878,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","There is of course a long sub-history of warfare in human history, everything from small skirmishes to global wars that ended in nuclear explosions. Although it is not commonly known outside of military circles, what could be the greatest act of hit-and-run warfare was the running fight carried out by the Nez Perce tribe in 1877. Ordered by President Grant and General Sherman to leave their ancestral home of the Wallowa Valley, they refused to voluntarily move to the Lapwai Reservation and took up arms.Under the able leadership of Heinmot Tooyalaket (Chief Joseph), the Nez Perce engaged in an 1100 mile 108 day fighting retreat where they outmaneuvered and outfought ten units of the U. S. Army until they were simply worn and starved out. The Nez Perce band included many women and children as well.A simple computation reveals that they averaged over 10 miles a day, on foot and over mountains, sometimes moving faster than the U. S. cavalry. The commander of the U. S. forces in pursuit was General Oliver O. Howard, a Medal of Honor winner, literally one of the best officers the U. S. Army had. Howard was also instrumental in the founding of Howard University (it was named after him) in 1867 for the education of blacks of both genders. Therefore, Howard demonstrated great sensitivity to the people of other races.  Howard also had the advantage of the telegraph in mobilizing and positioning his forces while Chief Joseph had only mounted messengers.This video is a dramatization of the dramatic and tragic events of the Nez Perce as they did all they could to avoid what even Chief Joseph knew was inevitable. Unlike some dramatic pieces supposedly based on history, this one is accurate enough to be recommended by the National Education Association.  James Whitmore does an excellent job in playing General Howard, while he is a loyal soldier that will follow his orders, he also demonstrates compassion for the Nez Perce and a great deal of respect for his opponent. Ned Romero does the same in the role of Chief Joseph, despite his incredible skills at warfare; Chief Joseph is a reluctant warrior, expressing sadness at the deaths of all of the people in his hopeless battles.Of all the actions of whites against the Native Americans, the battle with the Nez Perce is one of the few where the white American public admired the actions of the Native Americans. They recognized genius when they saw it and all understood that if Chief Joseph could have rallied other tribes under his banner, the war would have gone on far longer.  Joseph appealed to the Crow and Lakota tribes for aid and was refused. His actions are classics in the field of guerilla warfare, although the action against the Nez Perce, from the initial attempt at eviction to their final settlement on worthless land is a blot on the history of the United States. This movie shows the Nez Perce as humans being mistreated and fighting back, not as unprincipled savages to be conquered.",5,One of the few dramatizations that depict the Native Americans as honorable,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2974,"['course', 'long', 'sub-history', 'warfare', 'human', 'history', 'everything', 'small', 'skirmishes', 'global', 'wars', 'ended', 'nuclear', 'explosions', 'not', 'commonly', 'known', 'military', 'circles', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'greatest', 'act', 'hit-and-run', 'warfare', 'was', 'running', 'fight', 'carried', 'out', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'tribe', '1877', 'Ordered', 'President', 'Grant', 'General', 'Sherman', 'leave', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Wallowa', 'Valley', 'refused', 'voluntarily', 'move', 'Lapwai', 'Reservation', 'took', 'up', 'arms.Under', 'able', 'leadership', 'Heinmot', 'Tooyalaket', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'engaged', '1100', 'mile', '108', 'day', 'fighting', 'retreat', 'where', 'outmaneuvered', 'outfought', 'ten', 'units', 'U.', 'S.', 'Army', 'were', 'simply', 'worn', 'starved', 'out', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'band', 'included', 'many', 'women', 'children', 'well.A', 'simple', 'computation', 'reveals', 'averaged', 'over', '10', 'miles', 'day', 'foot', 'mountains', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'faster', 'U.', 'S.', 'cavalry', 'commander', 'U.', 'S.', 'forces', 'pursuit', 'was', 'General', 'Oliver', 'O.', 'Howard', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'winner', 'literally', 'one', 'best', 'officers', 'U.', 'S.', 'Army', 'had', 'Howard', 'was', 'also', 'instrumental', 'founding', 'Howard', 'University', 'was', 'named', '1867', 'education', 'blacks', 'genders', 'Therefore', 'Howard', 'demonstrated', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'people', 'other', 'races', 'Howard', 'also', 'had', 'advantage', 'telegraph', 'mobilizing', 'positioning', 'forces', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'had', 'only', 'mounted', 'messengers.This', 'video', 'dramatization', 'dramatic', 'tragic', 'events', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'did', 'could', 'avoid', 'what', 'even', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'knew', 'was', 'inevitable', 'dramatic', 'pieces', 'supposedly', 'based', 'history', 'one', 'accurate', 'enough', 'be', 'recommended', 'National', 'Education', 'Association', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'General', 'Howard', 'loyal', 'soldier', 'will', 'follow', 'orders', 'also', 'compassion', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'opponent', 'Ned', 'Romero', 'same', 'role', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'incredible', 'skills', 'warfare', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'reluctant', 'warrior', 'expressing', 'sadness', 'deaths', 'people', 'hopeless', 'actions', 'whites', 'Native', 'Americans', 'battle', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'one', 'few', 'where', 'white', 'American', 'public', 'admired', 'actions', 'Native', 'Americans', 'recognized', 'genius', 'when', 'saw', 'understood', 'Chief', 'Joseph', 'could', 'have', 'rallied', 'other', 'tribes', 'banner', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'far', 'longer', 'Joseph', 'appealed', 'Crow', 'Lakota', 'tribes', 'aid', 'was', 'refused', 'actions', 'are', 'classics', 'field', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'action', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'initial', 'attempt', 'eviction', 'final', 'settlement', 'worthless', 'land', 'blot', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'humans', 'being', 'mistreated', 'fighting', 'back', 'not', 'unprincipled', 'savages', 'be', 'conquered']",N/A

262881,A28SOQV8HP1HK3,6301710878,"S. Cartwright ""Bearracing""","[1, 1]","This film should be reviewed in two parts; The first for its subject matter, and the second; for its cinematic qualities. The latter being irrelevant, due to the nature of its historical content.American western films often portrayed the Native American Indians as the enemy or as uncivilized savages, but that all changed in 1970, with the release of ""Little Big Man"" (starring Dustin Hoffman in the title role). In each year previous, dozens and dozens of western movies had been released each year, but after 1970 and the release of Little Big Man, Hollywood decided that either it wasn't economically viable to continue making western films, in its prior traditional format, or it was more trouble than its worth to try and depict the Old West as it really was. The end result was that Hollywood has released few westerns after Little Big Man, but the majority of those that have been released, are often far more sympathetic to the reality of the west, as it actually was, during the 19th century.Those Indian tribes of the Northwest, referred to as the Nez Pearce, was a name coined by the early French trappers (Nez Pearce meaning Pearced Noses), but the tribes, those that followed Chief Joseph and others, called themselves the Wallowa Indians.Chief Joseph the younger (his father was also Chief Joseph), was more than just a tribal Chief, that fought the US Army, but in reality was truly an American Hero that has never really been correctly depicted in our schools and history books.In 1873, Chief Joseph had negotiated a peace with the Army, allowing them (the Wallowas) to stay on their ancestral lands (the Wallowa mountains and Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington), but in the year following the Battle of the Little Big Horn (June 25th, 1876), and the defeat of Colonel Custer and 245 members of the Army's 7th Calvary, many of the US Government's former policies changed. Including those policies regarding ""non-treaty"" Indians of Oregon and Washington.When Joseph made council with General Howard, he reluctly agreed to move his people from the Wallowas and onto the reservation in Idaho, but ended his meeting with the statement: ""It is my disbelief that the Great Spirit Chief gave one kind of men the right to tell another kind of men what they must do.""General Howard took this statement, by Joseph, as a direct afront to his authority and demanded that the Nez Pearce non-treaty Indians vacate the Wallowa Valley, within 30 days, and if they were still there on day 31, this would be considered an act of war!Though Chief Joseph advocated peace over war (sort of an early day pacifist), several young braves had taken it upon themselves to attack and kill 4 white settlers, Chief Joseph then knew that an attack, by General Howard, would happen any moment.Rather than attempt to negotiate further, Chief Joseph gathered the 800 members (almost entirely made of elderly, women, and children) of his tribe and began a 3-month long running battle with the US Army, all in an attempt to escape the US territories and make it into Canada to join up with the Hunkpapa Medicine Chief, Sitting Bull. During their 3-month flight, the Wallowa tribe, under Chief Joseph covered 1,700 miles and the defensive tactics the Wallowas used are still taught today at West Point.Less than 40 miles from the Canadian border, the weather turned on Joseph and the surviving Wallowas, but after only a few days of rest, believing they had several weeks before General Howard would catch up, Chief Joseph and his Wallowa tribe were attacked from the North by General Miles, something unforeseen by Chief Joseph.The actual translation of Chief Joseph's surrender agreement read:""Tell General Howard I know his heart. What he told me before, I have it in my heart. I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed; Looking Glass is dead, Too-hul-hul-sote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led on the young men is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets; the little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are--perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.""After the surrender, the surviving Wallowas, along with Chief Joseph, were eventually returned to the reservation in Idaho.Chief Joseph spent the remaining 25 years of his life, often stating that it was his desire that the injustice of the United States policy toward his people would be corrected and held out the hope that America's promise of freedom and equality might one day be fulfilled for all Native Americans as well. Chief Joseph died in 1904, never having seen the sacred lands of his ancestors again. His attending doctor said that Chief Joseph died ""of a broken heart"".Though this film is over 35 years old, if viewed as a documentary, rather than a hollywood movie, I believe you will enjoy it much more.There is a credible rumor that Steven Speilberg is considering a run of miniseries, chronicling ""Great American Heroes"" and the life of Chief Joseph and Wallowa Indians would be his first release. This series of TV miniseries' would be in the same format as his (Speilberg) ""Into The West"" miniseries of a few years ago.",5,The actuality of history!,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,5492,"['film',
