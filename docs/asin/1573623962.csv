189678,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,1573623962,Mark Baker,"[0, 0]","Calvin Fuller (Thomas Ian Nicholas) thinks his life is back to normal.  His biggest problem is getting noticed by the girl of his dreams.  He has gotten a job as a delivery boy for the local pizza place, where he works every day after school.But that's just how he finds himself in another adventure.  Hundreds of years before, Aladdin (Aharon Ipale) faced a threat to his throne from his brother Luxor (James Faulkner).  Before Luxor curses Aladdin, Aladdin sends the Genie on a quest.  And when the Genie (Taylor Negron) shows up in the pizzeria looking for ""The Deliverer,"" he thinks Calvin is the guy.Before he knows it, Calvin finds himself back in ancient Arabia where he must team up with Ali Baba (Nicholas Irons) and the three thieves as well as Aladdin's beautiful daughter Sheherazad (Rhona Mitra) to retrieve the Genie from the cave of wonders without letting Luxor get his hands on the lamp.  Can they do it?This is one of those mildly amusing movies that is rather harmless but not overly entertaining.  The story started rather slowly and predictably, but once it got into the second half, I was hooked.  The acting is passable, but certainly not praise worthy.  And the special effects are fairly obvious most of the time but they work.I think my biggest complaint is that Calvin seemed to have learned nothing from the first movie.  I was hoping to see a little character growth.  But he started the movie too nervous to do what he really wanted to do again.Don't rush out and get this movie.  But if you are bored, it will certainly help you pass an hour and a half rather painlessly.",3,Three Wishes Could Have Saved This Movie Because It's Not All Bad,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1602,"['Calvin', 'Fuller', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'life', 'back', 'normal', 'biggest', 'problem', 'getting', 'noticed', 'girl', 'dreams', 'gotten', 'job', 'delivery', 'boy', 'local', 'pizza', 'place', 'where', 'day', 'school.But', 'just', 'how', 'adventure', 'Hundreds', 'years', 'Aladdin', 'Aharon', 'Ipale', 'faced', 'threat', 'throne', 'brother', 'Luxor', 'James', 'Faulkner', 'Luxor', 'Aladdin', 'Aladdin', 'Genie', 'quest', 'when', 'Genie', 'Taylor', 'Negron', 'up', 'pizzeria', 'looking', 'Deliverer', 'Calvin', 'guy.Before', 'Calvin', 'back', 'ancient', 'Arabia', 'where', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'Nicholas', 'Irons', 'three', 'thieves', 'as', 'well', 'Aladdin', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Sheherazad', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'retrieve', 'Genie', 'cave', 'wonders', 'letting', 'Luxor', 'get', 'hands', 'lamp', 'Can', 'do', 'one', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'movies', 'rather', 'harmless', 'not', 'overly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'started', 'rather', 'slowly', 'predictably', 'once', 'got', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'hooked', 'acting', 'passable', 'certainly', 'not', 'praise', 'worthy', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'most', 'time', 'work.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Calvin', 'seemed', 'have', 'learned', 'nothing', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'little', 'character', 'growth', 'started', 'movie', 'too', 'nervous', 'do', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'again.Do', ""n't"", 'rush', 'out', 'get', 'movie', 'are', 'bored', 'will', 'certainly', 'help', 'pass', 'hour', 'half', 'rather', 'painlessly']",N/A

This is really a disney ripoff. The lamp looks the same as Disney's aladdin. The part that gets me confused. If the lamp vanished like 80,000 years ago. How would it end up in a pizza place.

Yes, the plot as well as the script are extremely corny and cheesy and the actress who plays the princess loks old enough to be in her thirties, but it is an entertaining movie nonetheless.  It portrays a nice adventure for anyone wishing to get away from the troubles of life for a while and return later.  It's a great modern Aladdin story as was said in another review and I recommend it to anyone, espcially in my generation.",5,Awesome Movie!!,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,482,"[""'m"", '18', 'love', 'movie', 'time', 'watch', 'Yes', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'are', 'extremely', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'actress', 'who', 'princess', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'thirties', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'nice', 'adventure', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'get', 'away', 'troubles', 'life', 'while', 'return', 'later', 'great', 'modern', 'Aladdin', 'story', 'was', 'said', 'review', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'espcially', 'generation']",N/A
