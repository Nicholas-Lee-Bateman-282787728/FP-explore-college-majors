1662135,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B00DW5ILJC,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]","I bought this movie thinking it would be a good slasher. From reading up on it I thought it sounded good. I also bought this because I was a huge Danielle Harris fan and I figured with her in the movie the movie would be at least average. I usually enjoy movies she is in. The main issue with the movie was the writing. The second issue was actors not being used properly. Harris and Shepis didn't get enough screen time. What bothered me is I thought those two should played different parts then they were playing that were bigger roles.The plot is years after a tragic accident leaves a young child scarred for life, the people responsible pay - with their lives. It's a story that had been done before many times. This time due to the writing I had trouble following the movie and guessing who the killer was. The gore was good. There was good action in the story. I thought the acting was very good for a horror movie. I thought Courtney Baxter did a good job as the woman had the scarred face from the accident. I liked her character and felt for her character. Ashley C Williams did good too. The actors all did good but the poorly written script hurt the movie severely. I think had it been better this could have been a really good slasher movie. I think the other as I said before Shepis and Harris having smaller parts was a mistake by the director. It was wasting good talent. If they were in the movie more they may have made it a better movie. They just missed the mark with this one.But in the end I recommend you rent this movie and not buy it unless you get it cheap. I think hardcore horror fans will enjoy it and I think new horror fans might be disappointed.

1662140,A31C6ABNPVGE29,B00DW5ILJC,shane s.,"[1, 1]",The worse thing about this movie is the dialogue from some of the actors. It looks like the director let them freestyle it cuz they couldn't remember their lines or something. The script was weak but worked until the end it seemed rushed like they ran out of time or money. And there was no killing until like 30-40 mminutes in. But the gore was alright for a low budget movie there was some nudity and a couple cute chicks along with danielle harris. If you can get for less than 10 bucks go ahead it's nothing special but it kills 78 minutes,3,i have seen worse,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,543,"['worse', 'thing', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'director', 'let', 'freestyle', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'lines', 'something', 'script', 'was', 'weak', 'worked', 'end', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'ran', 'time', 'money', 'was', 'killing', '30-40', 'mminutes', 'gore', 'was', 'alright', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'nudity', 'couple', 'cute', 'chicks', 'danielle', 'harris', 'can', 'get', 'less', '10', 'bucks', 'go', 'ahead', 'nothing', 'special', '78', 'minutes']",Hallows' Eve

Eve (Courtney Baxter) manages to find a plastic surgeon who doesn't believe in skin grafts...ever. One by one.. oh heck you know the plot. It is a who dunnit, but we watch for the gore and girls.There is some weird pot smoking scene which they either needed to do more of that kind of stuff or leave it alone entirely. The first mutilated dead face was pretty bad and made me laugh. The special effects needed to be taken to a higher plane. The dialouge needed to add to the character.

Really enjoyed this excellent little halloween horror film. somewhat like the earlier released film: the bates haunting, and had alot of the same scenes and location. First of all the filming and scenery were fantastic, and the acting by the cast was top notch. the actresses were very attractive and did a super job with there lines and acting. the film was alright with some very gruesome scenes and could have been better with scary frightening scenes. there were a couple of very provocative (peeping tom) scenes and a scene of a guy witnessing a coven of black dressed witches that were enticing, especially the love making scene of the couple, where the beautiful witch (dressed in some very sheer black undies) makes love to this lucky guy! Really liked watching each of the actresses, they were very pleasing to the eyes. I will definitely add this to my collection.
