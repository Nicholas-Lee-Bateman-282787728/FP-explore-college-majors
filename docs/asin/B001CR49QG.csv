The interviews didn't really entertain me, but the old film footage sure did. I'm sure the movies that Jack Wrangler starred in were respectable back in the day, but today they look hilarious. Jack Wrangler's dialogue in those movies made me laugh out loud. What is disappointing is that for a documentary about a porn star, there are very few sex clips, and not as much nudity as you'd think. All in all, it's a documentary that's worth watching once for gay porn fans.",3,"A Slightly Above Average ""Anatomy""",1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,547,"['Wrangler', 'Anatomy', 'Icon', 'documentary', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'interviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'entertain', 'old', 'film', 'footage', 'sure', 'did', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movies', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'starred', 'were', 'respectable', 'back', 'day', 'today', 'look', 'hilarious', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'dialogue', 'movies', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'What', 'disappointing', 'documentary', 'porn', 'star', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'sex', 'clips', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'nudity', ""'d"", 'think', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'gay', 'porn', 'fans']",Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon
1177446,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001CR49QG,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[3, 3]","I have never seen a Jack Wrangler blue movie, ever. I was way too young when he was in his heyday, but I did come across one of his sex mags when I was a teenager. Nevertheless, I certainly knew who he was. In the gay community, he was legendary. He sort of broke the mold of the gay clone of the 70s, who all had mustaches and wore leather. Jack Wrangler was blond, clean-shaven, and golden.WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON DVD was one of Amazon's recommendations and so I decided to check it out. It was eye opening.First off, Wrangler is really down to earth and didn't seem to take himself too seriously. He was born Jack Stillman in Beverly Hills, CA, and had an upbringing most of us would die for. He wasn't thrown out or disowned by his wealthy parents nor did the bad porn directors exploit him; he got into the adult entertainment business because he wanted to. He enjoyed it, liked showing his face, and branded his name--""Jack Wrangler""--to everything from poppers to sex toys, and he eventually crossed over to straight porn (funny that nowadays it's the straight adult male star who goes gay for more money). Wrangler, though gay, ends up falling in love with singer Margaret Whiting and they ended up getting married.He would go on to become a mainstream director and producer for stage plays and musicals. This doc was done in 2008 and features interviews with Wrangler at that time [Wrangler passed away on April 07, 2009, from lung disease at the age of 62 (LA Times)]. He's funny, warm, and very different from what I expected.The documentary tells Wrangler's story through photos, clips from interviews on talk shows, and some from his adult movies. There is some frontal nudity but there aren't any hardcore porn scenes, so don't worry.Interviews with wife and singer Margaret Whiting, Wrangler's peers other adult actors/actresses and adult film makers, and gay personalities etc., are also peppered throughout the movie, as well as some great old footage of Hollywood in the 70s, including shots of old gay porn theaters in NYC and SF.For special features there's almost 35-minutes of out-take interviews with Wrangler and audio commentary by director Jeffrey Schwarz, editor Jaime Meyers Schlenck, and composer Michael Cudahy.The film was entertaining and interesting. In the film, Wrangler recalls his father's dying wish as wanting him to do something on a grand scale, now that he was on the straight and narrow.I think for a generation of gay men, Jack Wrangler already did something big (no pun intended). He was comfortable being a gay man and made no apology for it. He wasn't embarrassed or ashamed of his sexuality--or the sex itself---being top and/or bottom in his movies, thereby allowing other gay men not to be ashamed of themselves either. Perhaps that's why he was so legendary. Of course, looking like everybody's all American didn't hurt either.Anyway, if you enjoy documentaries and like gay themed movies, especially about gay history, get WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON. I have some catching up to do on my classic gay porn viewing, LOL.;-)",5,"*WRANGLER*-- Beyond Just A Pretty Face, Hard Body & Hot Sex!",1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,3079,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'blue', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'when', 'was', 'heyday', 'did', 'come', 'one', 'sex', 'mags', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'Nevertheless', 'certainly', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'gay', 'community', 'was', 'legendary', 'sort', 'broke', 'mold', 'gay', 'clone', '70s', 'who', 'had', 'mustaches', 'wore', 'leather', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'was', 'blond', 'clean-shaven', 'golden.WRANGLER', 'ANATOMY', 'AN', 'ICON', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'Amazon', 'recommendations', 'so', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'eye', 'opening.First', 'off', 'Wrangler', 'really', 'down', 'earth', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'was', 'born', 'Jack', 'Stillman', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'CA', 'had', 'upbringing', 'most', 'would', 'die', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'out', 'disowned', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'did', 'bad', 'porn', 'directors', 'exploit', 'got', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'business', 'wanted', 'enjoyed', 'liked', 'showing', 'face', 'branded', 'name', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'everything', 'poppers', 'sex', 'toys', 'eventually', 'crossed', 'straight', 'porn', 'funny', 'straight', 'adult', 'male', 'star', 'who', 'gay', 'more', 'money', 'Wrangler', 'gay', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'singer', 'Margaret', 'Whiting', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'married.He', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'mainstream', 'director', 'producer', 'stage', 'plays', 'musicals', 'doc', 'was', 'done', '2008', 'interviews', 'Wrangler', 'time', 'Wrangler', 'passed', 'away', 'April', '07', '2009', 'lung', 'disease', 'age', '62', 'LA', 'Times', ']', 'funny', 'warm', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'expected.The', 'documentary', 'tells', 'Wrangler', 'story', 'photos', 'clips', 'interviews', 'talk', 'shows', 'adult', 'movies', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'are', ""n't"", 'hardcore', 'porn', 'scenes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry.Interviews', 'wife', 'singer', 'Margaret', 'Whiting', 'Wrangler', 'peers', 'other', 'adult', 'actors/actresses', 'adult', 'film', 'makers', 'gay', 'personalities', 'etc.', 'are', 'also', 'peppered', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'old', 'footage', 'Hollywood', '70s', 'including', 'shots', 'old', 'gay', 'porn', 'theaters', 'NYC', 'SF.For', 'special', 'features', 'almost', '35-minutes', 'out-take', 'interviews', 'Wrangler', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jeffrey', 'Schwarz', 'editor', 'Jaime', 'Meyers', 'Schlenck', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Cudahy.The', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'film', 'Wrangler', 'father', 'dying', 'wish', 'wanting', 'do', 'something', 'grand', 'scale', 'now', 'was', 'straight', 'narrow.I', 'think', 'generation', 'gay', 'men', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'already', 'did', 'something', 'big', 'pun', 'intended', 'was', 'comfortable', 'being', 'gay', 'man', 'made', 'apology', 'was', ""n't"", 'embarrassed', 'ashamed', 'sexuality', 'sex', '-being', 'top', 'and/or', 'bottom', 'movies', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'not', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'legendary', 'course', 'looking', 'everybody', 'American', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either.Anyway', 'enjoy', 'documentaries', 'gay', 'themed', 'movies', 'especially', 'gay', 'history', 'get', 'WRANGLER', 'ANATOMY', 'AN', 'ICON', 'have', 'catching', 'up', 'do', 'classic', 'gay', 'porn', 'viewing', 'LOL']",Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon

Madonna may have learned a thing or two from his marketing startegy.  Regardless, he was a very likable, sex icon for the 70's early 80's the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time.  Really a product of the times, he had an impact that still ripples throughout the community.This film is okay - but feels a little lightweight.  It is easy on the drama and tells us a lot of the obvious.  Interesting though is to hear him finally explain his marriage to Margaret Whiting and how that has worked all these years.

1177448,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B001CR49QG,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 8]","In this age of ubiquitous internet pornography it may be difficult to grasp what a major impact Jack Wrangler had on the emerging gay community in the 1970s.  A failed actor and director, he originally drifted into pornography as male model--where his super-masculine image startled both gay and straight men who had been taught to think of homosexuals as limp-wristed and effeminate.  There was an immediate demand for him in gay film pornography and he was a tremendous success, making over eighty films, numerous personal appearances, and endless licensing deals.Wrangler ultimately became a source of controversy for the gay community; although he himself was gay, he eventually moved into straight pornography, which had wider distribution and therefore bigger budgets and bigger salaries.  Many of his gay fans considered him something of a traitor for this--but this flap was nothing when compared to his love relationship with singer Margaret Whiting, a union that dropped jaws and set tongues to wagging in every gossip column from New York to Los Angeles.  Was he gay or straight?  Was he just a porno star on the make for a wealthy and well-regarded recording artist?  Just who the hell IS Jack Wrangler, any way?WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON answers most of the major questions.  Mixing narration, vintage film clips and interviews with friends and family, the bulk of the film is a prolonged interview with Wrangler himself, who does a credible job of describing his Beverly Hills upbringing as John Stillman, his career, and his relationship with the twenty-years-senior Whiting.  Are there unanswered questions?  Of course there are.  But on the whole, Wrangler comes off as intelligent and forthright, and now with hindsight acutely aware of his position as a gay man who made a host of unorthodox decisions for unorthodox reasons.  It is interesting stuff.The DVD includes a handful of bonuses; the only significant one is a director's commentary by Jeffrey Schwartz.  Entertaining for those interested in the ""golden age"" of gay and straight pornography--and those who remember Jack Wrangler fondly.

1177449,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B001CR49QG,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[4, 4]","Hmmmm, how do I write a review about a great documentary coveringone the of most explosive, controversial and pioneering icons of1970's gay porn, and do it without my review getting rejected forbeing inappropriate or lewd? (Cracks knuckles, clears throat!)Okay, I'll give it a go!---Jack Wrangler was a galvanizing as well astantalizing figure to millions of gay men in a time when the gay communitywas coming into it's own on the world stage and searching for icons to identify itself.Here he was, this beautiful, virile, MASCULINE white man with washboard abs,golden hair, the voice, the smile, and of course.. shall we say, THE GOODS!! (-:He forever shattered the stereotype of the weak effeminate sissy who couldn'tdefend himself, wore his mother's clothes, etc., which had been drilled into theminds of mainstream society as well as many an isolated shame-filled gay manwho had been shunned, beaten up, and pushed far back into the closet!Born into a very wealthy Beverly Hills family, he grew up alongside the spawn ofthe old hollywood elite. But Jack Wrangler was a different kind of guy who couldmove between the world's of the Hollywood elite and the low brow world of thegay street life in L.A. during the 1960's. Trying to capitalize on his looks,chiseled physique and Hollywood pedigree, he made a foray into the world of legitmovies in 1968. He did a few roles here and there, but nothing that made a big splashor would've alerted the movie world that a new master thespian was on the horizon!The thing that struck me about Jack in this docu-bio was his complete candorand total lack of guile while telling his story!He was really a decent guy who you could've approached and befreinded.He made a move to NYC in 1969 to try to get into the broadway acting scene to gainsome credibility in his chosen craft, but very soon realized that he was a big fishway out of his native pond in cold, dirty & competitive New York City!He moved back to L.A., and some time during the early 70's, when porn chic had become allthe rage, and both the gay liberation and sexual revolution were in full tilt,he emerged as JACK WRANGLER!!--America's first gay porn icon!He made countless gay porn flicks, many of which have become classics,had legions of male fans, did strip shows and lectures across the country,and was celebrated all over!--And the ladies dug him too! (-:They provide very good video clips and footage throughout this documentary.I was noticing while seeing it, that some of the fictional ""Boogie Nights""character ""Dirk Diggler"" was based partly on John Holmes and partly on Jack Wrangler.Anywayz, ol' Jack was partying hard 70's style, making hit films and havinga gay old time, when he decided to do something that shocked and alienatedmany of his devout gay fans....he decided to make the switch to straight porn!(GASP!!--Oh no, he di-in't!!) Many of the female porn stars of the time linedup to have their chance to work with Jack Wrangler, and to experiencehis GIFTS first hand! (-: He made several well-recieved ""straight-for-pay""films and gained many friends within the straight porn industry for hisprofessionalism and machine-like dependability!As if his gay fans weren't already confused enough, he then ups the antieand gets MARRIED!!--Yes, to a woman!---Yikes!This was quite the dinner party conversation, and many scoffed & made cruel jokes.But Margaret Whiting, a successful singer from the early 50's was convinced shehad found her man, and knew all about his ""shenanigans"" despite the pleas of herthen teenaged daughter and all of her freinds! (Clutch the pearls, honey!!)Jack was ever honest and completely identified himself as a gay man (with bi tendencies).He told her that he didn't think a marriage would work, but Margaret wasn't hearing it!The two were married and went through alot of  ups and downs, but stayed together forover 25 yrs until Jack's death earlier this year. The one thing that his marriage didsave him from was the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic in the early & mid 80's!Both Jack & Margaret lost alot of dear freinds and collegues to the vicious virus!They spent time in AIDS wards and hospices, trying to bring comfort and relief tothe many victims of the disease and also spent a great deal of money as well.Through it all, Jack Wrangler never forgot who he was and remained a decent,funny and very affable person who had led a very very interesting life! (-:Rest In Peace Jack! (1946 - 2009)This DVD was very enjoyable and I purchased it for my collection.(Also see ""Gay Sex In The 70's""...it's another great documentary aboutthis amazing time in America and in gay/bi

1177451,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B001CR49QG,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[1, 1]","The late Jack Wrangler was the lust object for thousands of emerging gay men during the late seventies and eighties. I loved his over-the-top exhibitionism, when closeted men were just beginning to dream of wearing sexy clothes and bathing suits which meant they should get in shape to flaunt it all--like Mr. Wrangler.This is a good summary of what this gay icon was all about although my big complaint about these documentaries on sexual outlaws never show us the good, hot stuff that made them legendary. We're given montages of magazine and tabloid covers and very brief snippets from some of Wrangler's films, with just a brief glimpse of genitalia. But nothing is conveyed about the sizzling scenes that Jack created when he was in the throes of letting it all hang out on movie screens. The part of the documentary showing Warngler and his improbable wife, songstress Margaret Whiting is still surreal to watch.  A little disturbing to me was watching Wrangler in the deleted scenes contained in the ""Bonus"" part.  He often laughs maniacally about some incident he's describing and sometimes just babbles incoherently which makes one wonder if he was taking medication during these deleted observations.In any case, this documentary is definitely worth a look at anyone interested in the wild and glorious days of sexual liberation when one could go to a big city and see a gay pornographic film without fear of being arrested and the film quite often showed Jack Wrangler in all of his naked glory.",3,The Sex Pioneer,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1506,"['late', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'was', 'lust', 'object', 'thousands', 'emerging', 'gay', 'men', 'late', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'loved', 'over-the-top', 'exhibitionism', 'when', 'closeted', 'men', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'dream', 'wearing', 'sexy', 'clothes', 'bathing', 'suits', 'meant', 'should', 'get', 'shape', 'flaunt', 'Mr.', 'Wrangler.This', 'good', 'summary', 'what', 'gay', 'icon', 'was', 'big', 'complaint', 'documentaries', 'sexual', 'outlaws', 'never', 'show', 'good', 'hot', 'stuff', 'made', 'legendary', ""'re"", 'given', 'montages', 'magazine', 'tabloid', 'covers', 'very', 'brief', 'snippets', 'Wrangler', 'films', 'just', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'genitalia', 'nothing', 'conveyed', 'sizzling', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'created', 'when', 'was', 'throes', 'letting', 'hang', 'out', 'movie', 'screens', 'part', 'documentary', 'showing', 'Warngler', 'improbable', 'wife', 'songstress', 'Margaret', 'Whiting', 'still', 'surreal', 'watch', 'little', 'disturbing', 'was', 'watching', 'Wrangler', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'contained', 'Bonus', 'part', 'often', 'maniacally', 'incident', 'describing', 'sometimes', 'just', 'babbles', 'incoherently', 'one', 'wonder', 'was', 'taking', 'medication', 'deleted', 'observations.In', 'case', 'documentary', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'anyone', 'interested', 'wild', 'glorious', 'days', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'when', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'big', 'city', 'see', 'gay', 'pornographic', 'film', 'fear', 'being', 'arrested', 'film', 'quite', 'often', 'showed', 'Jack', 'Wrangler', 'naked', 'glory']",Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon

And so, Jack Wrangler's statement set the tone for this entertaining & fascinating documentary on his life & career, which was colorful & unusual, to say the least.He became the poster boy for gay porn, sort of a ""Robert Redford"" for the genre, with his blond, masculine good looks. During the 70's, when the industry was finding its identity, Wrangler shot to the top.What was even more stunning (which stunned everyone) was his 90-degree turnaround into forging a loving relationship with middle-aged singer Margaret Whiting in the 80's (whom he later married). Come what may, it just proves the point that love takes all forms, and nothing is really impossible...including love between a gay porn star & a songbird. It's obvious they really cared for each other.Also amazing was how he re-invented himself after leaving porn. In an industry in which there is such a strong stigma attached once you perform in adult films, he found a new career as playwright, director & producer of many successful stage plays.A truly remarkable man, every inch an actor (hence, here was an openly gay man who successfully managed to cross over into straight adult films!), Wrangler was one-of-a-kind.

In ""Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon,"" director Jeffrey Schwarz gets Wrangler to open up about his life, both as a show-biz brat and as a man who grew up and out of an industry legend.Using a broad array of personalities, from Rod McKuen to Samantha Fox, Wranger's life and times are entertainingly illustrated. Wranger was both a product of his times and someone who helped to define them: the fact that he was so eager to sell himself as a legitimate entertainer AND as a product line was unheard of before Wrangler did it. There are plenty of images from Wrangler's life and movies, smartly juxtaposed with the timeline. As Wrangler grows older, the life he chooses to lead with pop-diva Margaret Whiting is given a fair explanation; a part of his life that seemed inexplicable to many gay men when it first unfolded.Funny, interesting, bemusing and at times bittersweet, ""Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon"" is both interesting as a portrait of the man and of the times he lived in.
