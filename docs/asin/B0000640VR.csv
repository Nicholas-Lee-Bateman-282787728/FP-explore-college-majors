Stupid!This movie was shelfed for over a year until Disney could find a dumping date to bring this to movie theaters. It should gone straight to DVD and video! This movie was very much a &quot;paint by numbers&quot; film for bad science fiction and movies in general.Not to mention it ripped off several other science fiction movies like &quot;Total Recall&quot;,&quot;The Thing&quot;,&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. and &quot;Blade Runner'.I saw this movie today at the last matinee after I find it out it did not get into the Box Office top ten.Perhaps a bad marketing killed it at the movie theaters. The cast does what little they have in terms of a script. There even a &quot;cat and mouse&quot; game in the movie. I suspect that this movie will be on DVD very fast. Needless to say the audience was laughing out loud at this flop!I find hard to belive that with 2002 being only 6 days old,I'm already writing a review for one the worst films of the year. The cast all has done better work than this pathetic movie.This movie also a very close boardline &quot;R&quot; movie. The amount of swearing ,violence , and nudity almost make it a &quot;R&quot; movie.Maybe the MPAA was asleep when they rated this box office turkey?This film is just as bad as the movie &quot;Supernova&quot;.Wait for this turkey on DVD or better yet wait for it hit the cheap theaters",1,One of 2002 worst movies of the year!,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,1464,"['One', '2002', 'worst', 'movies', 'year', 'Should', 'gone', 'straight', 'DVD', 'amp', 'video', 'Lame', 'Stupid', 'movie', 'was', 'shelfed', 'year', 'Disney', 'could', 'find', 'dumping', 'date', 'bring', 'movie', 'theaters', 'should', 'gone', 'straight', 'DVD', 'video', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'quot', 'paint', 'numbers', 'quot', 'film', 'bad', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'general.Not', 'mention', 'ripped', 'off', 'several', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'quot', 'Total', 'Recall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Thing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Blade', ""Runner'.I"", 'saw', 'movie', 'today', 'last', 'matinee', 'find', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Box', 'Office', 'top', 'bad', 'marketing', 'killed', 'movie', 'theaters', 'cast', 'what', 'little', 'have', 'terms', 'script', 'even', 'quot', 'cat', 'mouse', 'quot', 'game', 'movie', 'suspect', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'very', 'fast', 'Needless', 'say', 'audience', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'flop', 'find', 'hard', 'belive', '2002', 'being', 'only', '6', 'days', 'old', ""'m"", 'already', 'writing', 'review', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'year', 'cast', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'pathetic', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'close', 'boardline', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'movie', 'amount', 'swearing', 'violence', 'nudity', 'almost', 'make', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'MPAA', 'was', 'asleep', 'when', 'rated', 'box', 'office', 'turkey', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', 'quot', 'Supernova', 'quot', '.Wait', 'turkey', 'DVD', 'better', 'yet', 'wait', 'hit', 'cheap', 'theaters']",Impostor
698859,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000640VR,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","If someone were to approach me with money and desperately seek out the actor whose body of work impresses me the most, I think they would be surprised to find that the answer is Vincent D'Onofrio.  Outside of his ""Law and Order"" record, the body of work that he represents is outstanding.  The characters that he chooses to portray in each of his films continue to be more and more obscure and random, creating a body of work that is nearly untouched by any other actor in Hollywood.  For this, I will forever respect this man and his work.  I recently had the pleasure of seeing him in the lower budget science fiction Phillip K. Dick cinematic story ""Impostor"", and must admit, I was impressed.  With little money, a decent budget for visuals, and a cast that from the outside seems impressive, this was a little film that fell well under the radar and never quite saw the light of day.  This is not to say the film isn't perfect, because it is far from it, but it did provide me with nearly two hours of guessing, wondering, questioning, and inevitably (after the film was done), hoping for more.For those that are unwilling to give an unknown film a chance, this was the story of Gary Sinise playing the role of Spencer Olham.  He is a very happy scientist that loves his wife and job working for the government.  It is the future, and a band of violent aliens is trying to destroy the human race, but we have been resilient.  We have built walls over our skies and continually send pilots to attempt to bring down their star ships.  This story takes place somewhere in the middle of this chaotic war, where fear becomes a bigger enemy than ally.  D'Onofrio plays Hathaway, the leader of a government elite unit specializing in locating spies - and he has found a target - Olham.  Hathaway believes that Olham is an android of the human he once was, disguised to allow for easy infiltration and destruction.  Hathaway's mission is to destroy this clone, and while he wasn't successful in the past, he knows the truth now.  Of course, Sinise is Sinise, and for nearly two hours he runs, inspects, and prepares for what should be the truth - but instead we are handed a diabolical twist that will make any childless film buff happy and any anti-Sinise fan jump for joy.  We are left with a vision that is as stunning as it is disturbing, yet for me, I was disappointed.  I loved the ending, but questioned the value of the preceding hour of stock ""running"" footage.  The DVD itself contains the short film that this film was based on, and I must admit, I liked that a bit more because it cut the center ""filler"" out, but also eliminated the illusionist-character element that filled the time slot.  It was a give or take, but as you watch the ending, you question the need for it.I can't give the ending away, so I will divert the conversation elsewhere.  Loved the introduction to this film.  The history lesson coupled with an opening chapter that slowly fed you subliminal clues to the past.  The John Hooker song got my feet bouncing and my juxtaposed mind in gear.  Even in the future they listen to great music.  The relationship between Sinise and Stowe could have been warmer, the introduction was sensual, but not worth 45 minutes of fighting for.  I could not believe they were husband and wife for the brief moments that we saw them together.  The struggle with the situation that occurs to Nelson Gittes (played by Tony Shalhoub) again seemed very underplayed.  I wanted to see a stronger bond, and not just two sentences of dialog that would attempt to bring to the surface a life long relationship.  I loved D'Onofrio, but that has already been said.  Mekhi Phifer was just filler, the typical stranger that finds that warm patch in his heart to help a total stranger.  We have seen that in any other Hollywood puzzler, and for this film it was no different.  So, what I am trying to say is that the acting isn't what stands out with this film, it is the story.We all know that PK Dick can write an amazing story that withstands the vaults of time, and this is no exception.  When you begin watching the film, you may assume you have seen the action before, in other films.  You will be half right, until you witness the surprising ending.  I thought I had it figured out, but what happened continues to keep a smile on my face.  What I missed about this story was the war itself, yet eerily, I liked the internal struggle.  I was very reminiscent of what is occurring in our world today.  The tale of an overprotective government that is too worried about the treat instead of its people.  I wish we could have seen more about the ""big weapon"" that was going to be a turning point to the war, I think that would have explained the choice for Olham to be targeted - but again, with the shabby acting and stronger story, you have a mixed message that gets sent.  The focus becomes blurry and this small review found the short story/film to be stronger than the final verdict.  A smaller scale sometimes paint a bolder picture.Overall, I thought this was a decent film for the small amount of screen time it was given.  It kept my attention, while using techinques that are overused in Hollywood, but with ""Impostor"" it didn't feel used.  Something felt fresh about this film, and while I know it wasn't the small actors giving less than 100%, or the overly sweaty Sinise, I think it was the voice and power behind D'Onofrio's character.  Honestly, I am not drooling here, but he was great in this film.  He was fun, angry, poised, and yet seemingly disturbed all at the right moments.  ""Impostor"" is not a film that I think is a staple of the genre in any way, but it is a sinful delight that surprised me through the end.  I would recommend this to friends, but only good friends.  Alas, it won't be making my collection, but wouldn't mind catching it on network television one late night.  Could I be any more vague?Oh well, I am reopening ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?""Grade: ***  out of *****",3,Does the android Sinise dream of electric sheep?

Unfortunately for those involved(viewers and actors), that interest doesn't translate to screen, at least not in this version.  Admittedly, I was holding out hope for more, especially considering the acting talent involved--Gary Sinise, Madeleine Stowe, Vincent D'Onofrio,etc.--but it appears as though they were far less involved, at least emotionally, than is required to deliver on  a plot full of holes.  The plot kicks into low-gear(and stays there) when Sinise's character is accused of being an alien with a bomb planted in his chest that would cause the end of their world as they know it.  D'Onofrio(again going waaayy over-the-top)is the guy on his trail, and the always superb Stowe is Sinise's physician wife(and highly wasted in an ultimately thankless role).  Sinise gives an atypically cardboard perfomance(he seems to be coasting throughout)--in fact, only Tony Shalhoub(as Sinise's best friend)and Mekhi Phifer show any signs of life onscreen.  Admittedly, the twist ending is almost worth wading through the film for--I said almost.  If the rest of the film sustained even a fraction of the surprise that the ending contained, it would have been a far better view.

698872,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0000640VR,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 10]","Inspired by a short story written by Phillip K. Dick, the author who inspired one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time in Blade Runner (1982), Impostor (2002), directed by Gary Felder (Kiss the Girls, Don't Say a Word), stars a pretty impressive cast in Gary Sinise, Madeleine Stowe, and Vincent D'Onofrio.  It's odd that I hadn't even really heard of this film other than on here, but it could be it wasn't promoted enough to garner a larger audience or it may have gotten lost among the other releases that year...either way, I enjoyed it despite a number of perceived flaws.The film takes place sometime in the not so distance future, as the Earth is involved in a galactic battle with a mysterious alien force (All your base bewrong to us!) for the last ten years.  Seems these aliens want our planet in a bad way, even if it means destroying most of it in order to wipe the humans from the surface.  Dr. Spencer Olham (Sinise), a patriot and a scientist working for the global government, is in charge of research developing a super sophisticated new weapon to battle the hostile inter-planetary creeps, but soon finds himself as public enemy number one as he is accused of being a cybernetic construct, a living/mechanical thing created by aliens, replacing the real Dr. Olham, with the intent of carrying out a terrorist attack on an unknown target.  You see the method of the attack involves a highly explosive, yet virtually undetectable device implanted within Dr. Olham, one that activates when the carrier comes in proximity of its' target...at least this is what Major D.H. Hathaway (D'Onofrio), officer of the ESA (Earth Security Agency) claims, based on sketchy evidence collected through intercepted alien transmissions.  Oh yeah, the only way to distinguish a human from an impostor is by vivisection, something which Dr. Olham isn't too keen on for obvious reasons, so he manages to escape custody for the purpose of not only clearing his name, but staying alive.While I did enjoy the film, which is touted as a futuristic Fugitive, it does have a number of negatives working against it...but I will talk about those later.  As far as the positive aspects, the production values are really good throughout, even though I noticed things used in other films like scenes and props from other films like Starship Troopers (1997), Gattaca (1997), and Armageddon (1998).  I really did feel like I transported to a future environment, as the level of quality and detail was maintained throughout the film.  I thought the special effects were quite good and fairly realistic, even though some of the more grand scenes like ships flying through the air were painfully obvious as CGI work.  Gary Sinise, who always seems to put forth an exception effort even despite the film (okay, Reindeer Games was a pretty lame flick, but he was still pretty fun to watch), and I could feel the elements of Phillip K. Dick's story come through, although it was pretty obvious, since the film was based on a short story, that the plot had been stretched out rather than fleshed out.  The level of tension within the story was kept pretty tight, as the pacing rarely slowed down.  Madeleine Stowe, who plays the character of Dr. Maya Olham, Spencer's wife, is very good, but she seemed under used as her character suffered form lack of screen time and character development.  I did enjoy the twist at the end, as it really screws with your mind, and you may not pick up on it until moments before it is revealed, as I did, providing a memorable finish.The negatives...the camera work suffered at many points.  The use of angular shots was over used, and gave me flashbacks of the John Travolta travesty/vanity project Battlefield Earth (2003).  It wasn't as bad here as it was there, and it's a technique used to heighten tension within a film, but too much can cause a form of motion sickness in viewers, and this film just barely crossed the line in that aspect with one too many of those shots.  The worst thing for me was the very regular use of slow motion.  Used properly, it can be effective, but here, it seemed like every third scene involved some sort of slow motion shot, and it felt like the director was padding out the running time rather than using it to effectively present a particular shot.  And throughout the film locations and military time appeared at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  I can see why the location was given in some instances (it was wholly unnecessary at some points...hey, I can tell we're in a hospital, as all the doctors, nurses and medical equipment conveys that fact), to relay specific locations to the audience, but why was the time displayed regularly?  There really wasn't any time-based factor within the story, no countdown of any kind, as in Escape from New York (1981), so it was utterly pointless and annoying.  Tony Shaloub makes an appearance, but his role is basically pointless, and adds little to the story, effectively wasting his talents.  As far as Mekhi Phifer's character, well, it was just so very shallow it's hardly worth mentioning.  And Vincent D'Onofrio's character...I normally enjoy his work, especially on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, but here I felt the character was a bit overdone, like when John Travolta plays villains on the screen (if you've seen Swordfish (2001), you'll know what I mean).The wide screen anamorphic picture looks good here, and special features include a lame 12-minute featurette titled The Impostor Files, the original Impostor short film, and theatrical trailers for this film along with a number of others.  My recommendation is to rent this film first, as once the twist ending is revealed, there isn't much replay value.Cookieman108",3,"In the Future, not everyone is who they seem to be.",1089158400,"07

When he returns to work on Monday morning, he is arrested and accused of being a synthetic replicant, a Centauri cyborg replacement for the real Spencer Olham, allegedly murdered (without his wife's knowledge) during the camping trip though nobody has a dead body to prove it.  While being held he is shown a &quot;Centauri Hit List&quot; that has been partially decrypted... his surname is among the names on the list.  He maintains his innocence to no avail, and must ultimately escape so that he can prove his own innocence.It takes over 90 minutes to resolve this &quot;is-he-or-isn't-he&quot; question, while Spencer continually runs away or fights when cornered, and is thwarted every time he attempts to find evidence to prove his innocence.The problem with this film is that, given what Hollywood is today, there are only three or four possible endings.  These endings are immediately imaginable and given Hollywood's love of a twist ending, the choices are reduced further.Most intelligent people I've discussed this film with guessed the ending before I even finished describing the premise.So since you basically know how the film is going to end, there is absolutely ZERO suspense.  Instead you are just waiting around for the &quot;shocking revelation&quot; that you guessed an hour ago.*yawn* What a lead balloon.Gary Sinise as Spencer Olham, Vincent D'Onofrio as the vicious anti-infiltration agent pursuing Olham, and Madeline Stowe as Olham's wife Mia are all great actors, and the lovely Ms. Stowe offers the added bonus of being fun to look at.  But good acting and good looks cannot save this wretched movie.  &quot;Impostor&quot; was a bad idea that should never have been made.If you want to watch a film where the nature of the protagonist takes turns you *don't* expect, try Kevin Costner's 1987 film &quot;No Way Out&quot;.

698876,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B0000640VR,D. Litton,"[3, 3]","&quot;Here was my first story on the topic of: Am I a human? Or am I just programmed to believe I am human? When you consider that I wrote this back in 1953, it was, if I may say so, a pretty damn good new idea in sf. Of course, by now I've done it to death. But the theme still preoccupies me. It's an important theme because it forces us to ask: What is a human? And -- what isn't.&quot; -- Philip K. DickWhen Philip K. Dick wrote &quot;The Impostor&quot; in 1953, the United States was at the height of McCarthyism, when communism was a great threat to our government, who, in turn, sought to weed out those in favor of the communist ideals. His short story is very much like that dark period in our nation's history, employing the same premise with a science fiction twist. His many works have made their way to the silver screen in the past decades, with such futuristic extravaganzas as &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and even still keep popping up here and there as time moves on.And now we have &quot;Impostor,&quot; a movie which seems to capture the essence of the above quote by Dick with its all-too-familiar territory. At the time of its publication, the story could be looked at as fresh and inviting; as a movie in the new millennium, when the science fiction genre has become one of the most repetitive and redundant of all movie types, it seems like another run-of-the-mill futuristic thriller with lots of running that treads on the notion of whether or not its main character is who he says he is.And yet, the film's plot is still just as intriguing as the story on which it is based. Set in 2079, where Earth is in constant battle with the alien race Centauri, the planet is little more than a war zone, where dome-protected cities are surrounded by endless vistas of devastated wastelands. Living in one of these cold, metallic communities is Spencer John Olham (Gary Sinise), a weapons specialist who is hunted down by the Earth Security Agency and accused of being a member of the Centauri. Despite his reassurance that he is being falsely targeted, the E.S.A. continues with their plan to extract the bomb supposedly hidden within Spencer's heart, at which point he breaks free and becomes a fugitive out to prove his innocence.Had &quot;The Impostor&quot; been made into a film in earlier years, it may have been a bigger success. I think the failure of this movie to generate much interest in audiences stems from the well-worn paths that thrillers and the sci-fi genre have trodden even before the publication of Dick's story. The accusations made against Spencer, as well as his plight to prove himself to authorities, can de linked directly to &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; while aliens who infiltrate Earth by posing as humans was done years ago in &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot; Those not well acquainted with the short story or the author's works will find themselves at a loss.But, for those of us who have experienced &quot;Impostor&quot; with a knowledge of the author's themes and tactics, the film takes on a much bigger challenge of effectively creating the sense of paranoia and intensity so lovingly bestowed in the source material. For the most part, the film succeeds in doing just that, its futuristic appearance evoking a cold, stony dread that adds to the sense of claustrophobia as Spencer desperately searches for proof of his innocence. Settings such as the labyrinthine hospital, the underground tunnels, the &quot;Star War&quot;-like city structures, all add to the unease one feels as the story unfolds its mystery.Director Gary Fleder, who spun an intricate web in &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; and served up serviceable thrills in last year's &quot;Don't Say A Word,&quot; directs the material with a certain degree of energy needed to keep us involved in the story, while also giving the central mystery just enough appeal to intrigue us. Gary Sinise portrays Spencer just as he should be: as a human being that we come to care about and understand, his performance enriching the film's question of whether or not he is who he says, or rather believes, he is.The film's supporting cast is first-rate, and though much of the film is spent with Sinise, the performances are worth mentioning. The vastly-underrated Madeleine Stowe makes an appearance as Spencer's wife, Maya, convincing us of her grief over being torn between her husband and the law. Vincent D'Onofrio plays an E.S.A. agent out to retrieve Spencer with an earnestness and hardcore approach that is stellar, while Mekhi Phifer's performance as an outsider who aides Spencer back into the city is short-lived but commendable.As a result of the familiar plot devices that are no fault of its own, &quot;Impostor&quot; doesn't have the edge needed to make it a perfect movie. But I'd be lying if I said that it weren't an interesting adaptation of a wonderfully mystifying short story; in truth, the movie manages to capture the essence of what Dick hoped to deliver, and does so in a manner that deserves more praise than it has received.",4,Commendable adaptation with ups and downs.,1010880000,"01 13, 2002",2002,5084,"['quot', 'Here', 'was', 'first', 'story', 'topic',

Gary Sinise, Vincent D'Onofrio, Mekhi Pfifer, & Madeleine Stowe all turn in top-notch performances, & Gary Fleder's direction is absolutely sublime.One of the intriguing things about the Director's Cut DVD is that it features the original 38-minute short film (essentially the first 25 & last 13 minutes of the theatrical version), which was originally to be the linchpin in a trilogy of sci-fi short movies (and was, I believe, released as such in Japan). The higher-ups at Dimension were so pleased with the results that they gave the go-ahead to make it a full blown feature (kind of a shame for the other two movies), & rightly so.

Not surprisingly, the critics were harsh on this one, and while many of the complaints are valid, Impostor is still a bit better than its reputation.Impostor is set sometime in the future, a time where humans are at war with a powerful alien race.  Gary Sinise stars as Spence Olham, a dedicated husband (wife played by the lovely Madeleine Stowe) and scientist who has crafted the ultimate superweapon to battle the aliens, but upon its completion, is accused of being a synthetically created alien cyborg with a bomb in his chest that's set to go off when he reaches his prime target.  Now on the run, Olham struggles to prove his innocence before it's too late.Impostor's concept, that of a seemingly normal man accused of being a replicant, is a fascinating one, but it's unfortunately drowned by director Gary Fleder's obsession with shaky camera movements and quick cuts.  The screenplay can also take partial blame for the lack of genuine theme, since it spends more time placing Olham on the run that exploring the possibilities of his predicament (be it from an action or thematic standpoint).  The question of identity and what it means to be human is never fully addressed and only touched upon briefly.Given the back story behind the film's production, it's not surprising to see the film struggle for more plot around the half-hour mark.  It's basically just one long chase, and for a supporting cast, we're introduced to an underground homeless group fighting for survival in the ruins outside the cities (the similarities to Johnny Mneumonic in this respect are bothersome).  Compelling, this material is not.But heavily flawed as the film is, the cast is solid, with Sinise delivering yet again another terrific performance.  If there's any reason to care about Olham's situation, it's entirely because of Sinise.  Decent support from the likes of Vincent D'onofrio, Madeleine Stowe, and Mekhi Phifer (looking like a young Keith David, might I add) keep things afloat and just interesting enough to hold my attention.With a relatively modest budget (40M), there are some rather convincing special effects (barring the opening sequence, which actually borrows footage from Armageddon and Starship Troopers), as well as some genuinely awe-inspiring cityscapes.  Fleder's quick-cuts keep Impostor from attaining the first-rate thrills it aspires for, but the film's fast pace ensures it's never dull and there are even a few exciting action sequences (most notably the hospital fight/chase).  But best of all is the climactic plot twist, a no-holds barred surprise that boosts the film up a notch, even if it's resolved in somewhat head-scratching fashion.  As a whole, the movie is middling, but there are enough inspired moments to make for a decent timewaster.** 1/2 out of *****",3,"Never dull, but never a thrill ride, either.",1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,3038,"['Impostor', 'was', 'first', '2002', 'futuristic', 'thrillers', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Equilibrium', 'also', 'easily', 'weakest', 'surprise', 'when', 'consider', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'more', 'blown-up', 'short', 'film', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'critics', 'were', 'harsh', 'one', 'many', 'complaints', 'are', 'valid', 'Impostor', 'still', 'bit', 'better', 'reputation.Impostor', 'set', 'sometime', 'future', 'time', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'war', 'powerful', 'alien', 'race', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Spence', 'Olham', 'dedicated', 'husband', 'wife', 'played', 'lovely', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'scientist', 'who', 'crafted', 'ultimate', 'superweapon', 'battle', 'aliens', 'completion', 'accused', 'being', 'synthetically', 'created', 'alien', 'cyborg', 'bomb', 'chest', 'set', 'go', 'off', 'when', 'prime', 'target', 'Now', 'run', 'Olham', 'prove', 'innocence', 'too', 'late.Impostor', 'concept', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'man', 'accused', 'being', 'replicant', 'fascinating', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'drowned', 'director', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'obsession', 'shaky', 'camera', 'movements', 'quick', 'cuts', 'screenplay', 'can', 'also', 'take', 'partial', 'blame', 'lack', 'genuine', 'theme', 'more', 'time', 'placing', 'Olham', 'run', 'exploring', 'possibilities', 'predicament', 'be', 'action', 'thematic', 'standpoint', 'question', 'identity', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'never', 'fully', 'addressed', 'only', 'touched', 'back', 'story', 'film', 'production', 'not', 'surprising', 'see', 'film', 'struggle', 'more', 'plot', 'half-hour', 'mark', 'basically', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'chase', 'supporting', 'cast', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'underground', 'homeless', 'group', 'fighting', 'survival', 'ruins', 'cities', 'similarities', 'Johnny', 'Mneumonic', 'respect', 'are', 'bothersome', 'Compelling', 'material', 'not.But', 'heavily', 'flawed', 'film', 'cast', 'solid', 'Sinise', 'delivering', 'yet', 'again', 'terrific', 'performance', 'reason', 'care', 'Olham', 'situation', 'entirely', 'Sinise', 'Decent', 'support', 'likes', 'Vincent', ""D'onofrio"", 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'looking', 'young', 'Keith', 'David', 'might', 'add', 'keep', 'things', 'afloat', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention.With', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', '40M', 'are', 'rather', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'barring', 'opening', 'sequence', 'actually', 'footage', 'Armageddon', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'as', 'well', 'genuinely', 'awe-inspiring', 'cityscapes', 'Fleder', 'quick-cuts', 'keep', 'Impostor', 'attaining', 'first-rate', 'thrills', 'film', 'fast', 'pace', 'never', 'dull', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'most', 'notably', 'hospital', 'fight/chase', 'best', 'climactic', 'plot', 'twist', 'no-holds', 'barred', 'surprise', 'film', 'up', 'notch', 'even', 'resolved', 'somewhat', 'head-scratching', 'fashion', 'whole', 'movie', 'middling', 'are', 'enough', 'inspired', 'moments', 'make', 'decent', 'timewaster', '**', '1/2', '*****']",Impostor

698891,A2L5IDS334C1GL,B0000640VR,Hexanova,"[3, 7]","Impostor is another offering from Hollywood leveraging the science fiction works of the classic Philip K. Dick. In my opinion, only one of P.K.D.'s have translated well to the screen...Blade Runner. Most of P.K.D.'s works deal with confusion of identity or the replacement of real humans with artificial ones...sometimes both. Total Recall deals with a man who has his identity changed to fight a Mars resistance. Blad Runner deals with the elimination of artificial humans (replicants) who aren't allowed to have a permanent human identity. Impostor is the story of a brilliant weapons scientist named Spencer John Olham (Gary Sinise) that has been fighting the war with the Centauris by creating weapons of mass destruction. Spencer quickly finds out that he's not who he thinks he his. The government thinks he's an artificial human that has been planted in his place to assassinate the president. Vincent D'Onofrio plays the government agent who is trying to hunt Spencer down, and Madeleine Stowe plays Spencer's wife. The formula is pretty much the same as Total Recall...loving husband finds out he's not who he is, evil government agent chases him through futuristic cities, and he gets help from people on the other side of the tracks. The ending is very different, but it's all a familiar story. I'm not sure if this is P.K.D.'s fault for using the same premise in another work, or the screenplay writer's fault.The effects are very hit and miss, which is strange for a movie done by Industrial Light and Magic. This movie was supposedly in post production sometime in 2000, yet kept getting pushed. This gave ILM plenty of time to polish it up. Despite this, the opening shots showing the start of the Earth-Centauri war were pretty bad...comparable to a decent computer game cutscene. The effects do get progressively better as the film moves along.The acting is pretty run of the mill and the story moves along at a fair pace with a short running time of about 95 minutes. Impostor is not as bad as many of its reviews are saying, nor is it a good movie by any stretch. It's a story that we've seen before. I recommend that only hardcore sci-fi fan go check out a discount showing...everyone else just stay away until it comes out on video.Note that the upcoming flick Minority Report is also based on a Philip K. Dick work. This time it deals with invasion of identity/privacy when the government can tell who commits crimes and nabs the people before they commit said crime. Where Impostor looked completely average before I saw it, Minority Report looks very good. I expect to see more and more of P.K.D.'s works make it to the screen...with both success and disaster.",2,Philip K.

698892,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B0000640VR,H. Jin,"[0, 0]","To be honest, this wasn't that great a movie. The set-up was very original, though; during a long-standing war, enemy aliens devise human replicants for use as weapons. These replicants kill human beings and adopt their likeness, knowledge, and memories. The narrative hook is that these ""impostors"" genuinely believe they are human, so when Dr Olham (Gary Sinise) is accused of being such a replicant, neither he nor the audience knows whether or not it is really true.It's a great introduction, but the film quickly descends into a fairly predictable lone-hero-on-the-run scenario that we've seen in sci-fi many times before. You know the story: through a combination of extraordinary good fortune and coincidence, the hero is able to outrun and outsmart a whole army of ruthless law enforcers with their futuristic weaponry.....all while attempting to prove his innocence and contact his loved ones. In fact, the bulk of the film is basically one long chase scene. This is based on a short story by sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick, and I read somewhere that this was originally designed as a short film instead of a full-length movie.  Perhaps it might have been better to stick with the original idea, because the padding certainly shows in the second act here.While I really liked Vincent D'Onofrio (a criminally under-rated character actor) as the antagonist Hathaway, I felt Madeline Stowe was largely wasted as Olham's wife, and thought Gary Sinise was unsuited to the lead role. It's not that Sinise gave a bad performance, I just didn't find him that convincing as either a brilliant scientist or desperate man on the run. There are a couple of weaknesses in the plot development as well; Hathaway mentions that the woods have been searched for the dead body....but they didn't stumble across the spaceship that Olham and his wife found inside two minutes? And if you can fool the high-tech face recognition security with only a pair of sunglasses, it kind of defeats the point, doesn't it?So by about the halfway mark, I was pretty bored with this, and thought I knew exactly how it would play out. But I was wrong. `Impostor' is saved by a very clever and genuinely unexpected ending. Such a twist was even more of a shock since the bulk of the movie had been so predictable. Like all good twist endings, it cast some doubt on what you've seen before, giving several earlier scenes added weight and meaning. I was really impressed that they went with something like this rather than the big action shootout or contrived ending I was expecting.It's not quite enough to make this a really ""good"" film, but it does redeem what until that point had been fairly ordinary. With a stronger male lead and a tighter script, this could have been a real sci-fi classic that did justice to Dick's work.

We remember fondly those simple set ups that let us sit back and enjoy an edge-of-your-seat main body of the movie, culminating in a definitive ending. This more contemporary thriller is about an assassin sent from another solar system to kill a major world political leader on Earth. The way this assassin operates is to take over someone else's body and sneak in undetected under that person's identity. Things get really complicated when it becomes darned near impossible to tell if someone is his or her real self or an imposter assassin. It seems that all but the last minute or less of this film is setup. Then by the time the short climax comes, things are so contorted and ambiguous that the movie leaves us quite confused. Sometimes endings are ambiguous and that can be effective as a plot device. But when it's ambiguous as to whether things are even ambiguous or not, that leaves me longing a bit for the good old days. What does make this movie more satisfying that many another modern convoluted thriller is Gary Sinise's strong performance. Given the material he had to work with, he handles it at least as well as in some of his previous impressive roles, as in APOLLO 13 and FORREST GUMP.

There are real inconsistencies in the story--for example, why don't androids dopplegangers have any memory of killing their real counterparts? Disorienting the audience, in the hands of a great director, can create powerful empathy with a character. This director merely achieved confusion and ambivalence. What makes this a particularly frustrating movie is that so much potential was wasted. If you watch the first 10 and the last 10 minutes of this, you will have seen the highlights. The vast body of the film is a particularly uninteresting chase. The ending could have had terrific power, but was wasted by the middle 80% of the film.

698897,AK81WLVD5KGUX,B0000640VR,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[4, 8]","I like this movie better than I probably should, just because it's one of the more faithful screen adaptations of a Philip K. Dick story. (It's also -- and not very importantly -- the first to retain the _name_ of the story on which it's based; _Blade Runner, _Total Recall_, and _Screamers_ didn't. _Minority Report_ and _Paycheck_ are more recent -- and even _Minority Report_ dropped the original title's initial 'the'.)I also like it because it's got Gary Sinise in it. He's one of those reliable actors (like Ed Harris) who just makes any role watchable and interesting. There's also Madeleine Stowe, and the wonderfully frenetic Vincent D'Onofrio.But it's got troubles.There are lots of little ones: overuse of slo-mo, hard-to-follow exposition, distracting camera work. But these are just minor annoyances.There's really one big problem: there's about twenty minutes of plot in a ninety-minute movie. The middle third of the film consists of one big long (and highly unlikely) chase scene that ultimately takes us exactly nowhere in terms of the storyline. (Sure, it shows us some of the sociopolitical backdrop -- like the poor people left outside the domes the gubmint built to protect the rich folks from the Centaurian invasion. But it doesn't move the _story_ along.)In a way, that's _because_ the film tries not to mess too much with the short story on which it's based (although it does change some things, of course). That'd be okay for a half-hour TV show, but it's not a great idea for a feature-length motion picture.It's one thing to turn _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ into a movie; that's a full-length novel. But (as the other Dick screen adaptations illustrate) there just isn't any effective way to translate a Dick short story to the screen without expanding the storyline a heckuva lot more than this film does. The _ineffective_ way -- and the way unfortunately adopted by this film -- is to add a bunch of filler and s-t-r-e-t-c-h the thing out.To its credit, though, _Impostor_ is very effective in posing one of Dick's trademark issues -- namely, whether genetic 'replicants' might not be _more_ human than human beings. It also gives a little screen time (but not enough) to the usual Dickian questions about the nature of personal identity.So I'm going to go ahead and like it. But I'm still going to wish there were some more _story_ in it.",3,"Good idea, but there are problems",1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,2381,"['like', 'movie', 'better', 'probably', 'should', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'faithful', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'importantly', 'first', 'retain', '_name_', 'story', 'based', '_Blade', 'Runner', '_Total', 'Recall_', '_Screamers_', 'did', ""n't"", '_Minority', 'Report_', '_Paycheck_', 'are', 'more', 'recent', 'even', '_Minority', 'Report_', 'dropped', 'original', 'title', 'initial', ""'the"", 'also', 'got', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'one', 'reliable', 'actors', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'just', 'role', 'watchable', 'interesting', 'also', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'wonderfully', 'frenetic', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio.But"", 'got', 'are', 'lots', 'little', 'ones', 'overuse', 'slo-mo', 'hard-to-follow', 'exposition', 'distracting', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'just', 'minor', 'annoyances.There', 'really', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'plot', 'ninety-minute', 'movie', 'middle', 'third', 'film', 'one', 'big', 'long', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'chase', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'exactly', 'nowhere', 'terms', 'storyline', 'Sure', 'sociopolitical', 'backdrop', 'poor', 'people', 'left', 'domes', 'gubmint', 'built', 'protect', 'rich', 'folks', 'Centaurian', 'invasion', ""n't"", 'move', '_story_', 'way', 'film', 'not', 'mess', 'too', 'much', 'short', 'story', 'based', 'change', 'things', 'course', ""'d"", 'be', 'okay', 'half-hour', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'great', 'idea', 'feature-length', 'motion', 'picture.It', 'one', 'thing', 'turn', '_Do', 'Androids', 'Dream', 'Electric', 'Sheep', '_', 'movie', 'full-length', 'novel', 'other', 'Dick', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'illustrate', 'just', ""n't"", 'effective', 'way', 'translate', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'screen', 'expanding', 'storyline', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'more', 'film', '_ineffective_', 'way', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'adopted', 'film', 'add', 'bunch', 'filler', 's-t-r-e-t-c-h', 'thing', 'credit', 'very', 'effective', 'posing', 'one', 'Dick', 'trademark', 'issues', 'namely', 'genetic', ""'replicants"", 'might', 'not', 'be', '_more_', 'human', 'human', 'beings', 'also', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'usual', 'Dickian', 'questions', 'nature', 'personal', 'identity.So', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'ahead', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'wish', 'were', 'more', '_story_']",Impostor

Gary knows he is not an alien but everyone around him is convinced otherwise.  How can Gary prove his innocence when no one is interested in it?  He manages to escape custody and goes into hiding.  He hatches a desperate plan to show that he really is human.  All he has to do is break into a heavily-guarded hospital and gain access to his recent physical records.Gary manages to enlist the aid of others living under the radar of the authorities and puts his plan in motion.  It becomes a race against time and Gary is forced into one last desperate act to prove he is himself.  All he has to do is find the alien craft and duplicate that never replaced him.  Will he get there before the authorities catch up to him?  What will he find?  Will it clear him or will there still be doubt?  You will have to watch to find out.What is reality?  That is a question that kept Philip K. Dick writing great story after great story.  There are two versions of the film on this disk.  There is the longer theatrical release and the original shorter version.  The difference is the hospital plot.  Personally I feel the shorter version works better.

698904,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B0000640VR,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","IMPOSTOR is supposed to be a science fiction movie, but the elements of traditional science fiction are so diluted that this film was actually closer to a MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE type thriller.  We are told that by the next century Earth has fought a losing battle with the aggressive Centauri, a race that looks much like our own. The Centauri possess superior technology so they seem to have gained the upper hand by chasing Earthmen from colonized planets and in effect quarrantining them on Earth. Now this premise could have been the start of a much more interesting picture that could have made better use of all this.  However, the movie would have us believe that with the Centauri ruling the heavens, they would still find it necessary to finish off humanity by assassinating key Earth officials.  As soon as weapons designer Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise) is accused of being a cloned replicant of the now deceased original, we are manipulated into believing that he is still human.  If this sounds a little like the premise of TOTAL RECALL, the reason is that Philip K. Dick wrote the stories for both. What follows this accusation is a standard 'Fugitive' type chase film, in which Vincent D'Onofrio stands in for the Tommy Lee Jones marshall.  The chase itself is set against a future society which is highly regimented, each citizen carrying within himself a microchip identity implanted in the spine.  The problem with the glitzy futuristic extrapolation of current technology is that it was not needed to advance the plot.  Do you remember the original television series THE INVADERS?  That series had a similar plot to this, but the society of architect David Vincent formed an integral part of the plot.  With IMPOSTOR, any society of today could have served as well.  On the plus side, Sinise does his usual credible job of playing the confused or angry outsider.  Madeline Stowe is convincing as his wife, whose function it is to be the catalyst for a surprise ending that truly caught me off guard.  IMPOSTOR is a big money special effects movie that zips along fast enough so that some of the objections just noted may get overlooked.

698909,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0000640VR,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","Philip K. Dick practically crafted the modern science fiction movie, many of them important foundational works: Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Next, and the upcoming Adjustment Bureau. If you're a sci-fi fan, chances are you've seen at least one of the movies inspired by his stories.  There's still plenty of material to be mined that hasn't yet been brought to the screen, often because the technology wasn't up to snuff to portray it faithfully.  With the advent of cheap CGI, that all changed.  And that's how we ended up with the film adaptation of Dick's 1953 short story, Impostor.In 2079 the world is at war. Aliens from Alpha Centauri regularly strafe the Earth with missiles, necessitating electromagnetic shielding and a military new world order.  Frustrated by the failure of their direct approach, the aliens begin sending replicants that look just like human beings but are actually living bombs.  Spencer Olham (a bulked up Gary Sinise) goes from prominent weapon designer to wanted criminal, hunted by ESA chief Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio). The story is largely about his dislocation and self-doubt as he questions his own humanity.Dick was fond of exploring how technology affects our perceptions of self.  From Blade Runner to Minority Report, Dick repeatedly took themes of how we define identity (our flesh, our minds, our future) and asked: if you remove a piece, are you still human?  Impostor continues that inquiry with a contemporary theme we can relate to.  In a world where a human can be mimicked down to their memories, does an unwitting suicide bomber have any rights?  On the one hand, someone who doesn't know they're a terrorist pawn is just as human as anyone else - Impostor makes the point of reinforcing that, with the exception of the bomb in their chest, the replicants are human down to their DNA - and they have all the hopes, fear, dreams, and emotions of a ""real"" human being.  On the other hand, a terrorist who can blow up thousands is still a terrorist, which excuses every brutal method necessary to stop him, including torture and murder.  Sound familiar?Impostor is intent on showing Olham's humanity but does so with jittery flashbacks, odd camera angles, and frequent scenes of Olham's beautiful wife (Madeleine Stowe). Director Gary Fleder's specialty is television, not movies, and the original version of Impostor was meant to be much shorter.  As a result, the many scenes feel like padding, which is a shame - much of Impostor is about the cat-and-mouse game between Olham and Hathaway, but the movie feels top heavy with an additional subplot involving bounty hunter Cale (Mekhi Phifer).Impostor has lots of plot holes, not the least of which being the double-twist ending that raises more questions than answers.  But if you're willing to go along for the admittedly shaky ride, Impostor proves that age old questions about ethics, government, and identity were as relevant in 1953 as they are today.",3,Torture and terrorism -- sound familiar?,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,3002,"['Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'practically', 'crafted', 'modern', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'many', 'important', 'foundational', 'works', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Screamers', 'Minority', 'Report', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Next', 'upcoming', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', ""'re"", 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'movies', 'inspired', 'stories', 'still', 'plenty', 'material', 'be', 'mined', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'brought', 'screen', 'often', 'technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'snuff', 'portray', 'faithfully', 'advent', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'changed', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Dick', '1953', 'short', 'story', 'Impostor.In', '2079', 'world', 'war', 'Aliens', 'Alpha', 'Centauri', 'regularly', 'strafe', 'Earth', 'missiles', 'necessitating', 'electromagnetic', 'shielding', 'military', 'new', 'world', 'order', 'Frustrated', 'failure', 'direct', 'approach', 'aliens', 'begin', 'sending', 'replicants', 'look', 'just', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'actually', 'living', 'bombs', 'Spencer', 'Olham', 'bulked', 'up', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'prominent', 'weapon', 'designer', 'wanted', 'criminal', 'hunted', 'ESA', 'chief', 'Hathaway', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'story', 'largely', 'dislocation', 'self-doubt', 'questions', 'own', 'humanity.Dick', 'was', 'fond', 'exploring', 'how', 'technology', 'perceptions', 'self', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Dick', 'repeatedly', 'took', 'themes', 'how', 'define', 'identity', 'flesh', 'minds', 'future', 'asked', 'remove', 'piece', 'are', 'still', 'human', 'Impostor', 'inquiry', 'contemporary', 'theme', 'can', 'relate', 'world', 'where', 'human', 'can', 'be', 'mimicked', 'memories', 'unwitting', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'have', 'rights', 'one', 'hand', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', ""'re"", 'terrorist', 'pawn', 'just', 'as', 'human', 'anyone', 'else', 'Impostor', 'point', 'reinforcing', 'exception', 'bomb', 'chest', 'replicants', 'are', 'human', 'DNA', 'have', 'hopes', 'fear', 'dreams', 'emotions', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'other', 'hand', 'terrorist', 'who', 'can', 'blow', 'up', 'thousands', 'still', 'terrorist', 'brutal', 'method', 'necessary', 'stop', 'including', 'torture', 'murder', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Impostor', 'intent', 'showing', 'Olham', 'humanity', 'so', 'jittery', 'flashbacks', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'Olham', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'specialty', 'television', 'not', 'movies', 'original', 'version', 'Impostor', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'much', 'shorter', 'result', 'many', 'scenes', 'feel', 'padding', 'shame', 'much', 'Impostor', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Olham', 'Hathaway', 'movie', 'top', 'heavy', 'additional', 'subplot', 'involving', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Cale', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', '.Impostor', 'lots', 'plot', 'holes', 'not', 'least', 'being', 'double-twist', 'ending', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'admittedly', 'shaky', 'ride', 'Impostor', 'age', 'old', 'questions', 'ethics', 'government', 'identity', 'were', 'relevant', '1953', 'are', 'today']",Impostor

It's a wild ride, troubling, involving.  The story is simple in a way, but not simplistic.All of the key characters' performances are good, and some are extraordinary.  Gary Sinise is spot-on as the protaganist, Spencer Olham, accused of being an inhuman duplicate of himself.  Madeleine Stowe gives a genuinely moving performance in the role of Maya, Olham's wife.I saw the original on HBO years ago, and liked it enough that I recently bought the DVD with the director's cut.  I'm not sure what the differences are, but the director's cut does feel leaner and tighter.The effects are uneven, which I expect is due to the movie's origin:  it was originally conceived as a short for television, then the producers switched gears in midstream and retooled it into a full length feature.  Some of the visuals are borderline, by today's standards, reminiscent of some bad moments on the Sci Fi channel.  Others are excellent, so don't let that stop you from seeing the movie.Looking past the uneven SFX, the movie is well worth seeing.

We have been at war with Centauri for years and nothing seems to be capable of stopping the invaders.Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise) used to build rockets as a kid til his father died on the front against the Centauri.  Now, he builds weapons and he's darn good at it.Problem is, the ESA (Earth Security Agency) thinks Olham is an impostor cyborg and he's carrying a Centauri bomb in his heart. He's arrested and manages to escape, desperately trying to prove with a PET scan that he is himself and not a weapon.""Impostor"" is basically a breathless chase through a dystopic Earth. Gary Sinise does a great job playing the inventor on the run.  Kudos also to Madeline Stowe, who is his physician wife, Maya.

I thought that the cast had a lot of talent, the performances were all solid, and the script was paced well.  The directing was a little muddy.

We go eighty years into the future, a time when the earth is under attack by the alien race of Centaurians.  All humans now live under large domes to protect themselves from open air attacks.A prominent young scientist is accused of being an andriod carrying a bomb in his rib cage, programmed to go off within a certain proximity to am important public figure.  What ensues is a 'fugitive' style race, during which the formerly prominent professor is forced to confront questions about his own reality (am I who I think I am), the suspicions of his own wife, and the desperate situation of a group of people, called the Zonelanders, living outside of the dome and government control.While all of this is entertaining enough, and indeed the movie provides a couple of excellent surprises in its culmination, there isn't much that is fully developed.  While the movie is billed as sci-fi and holds up an expensive background to support that arguement, there isn't much sci-fi about it.  We never learn much about the Centaurians, or even get to see them during the movie.  There are strong elements of the macabre which really don't belong at all.  For example, a medical machine designed to scan the body should normally operate in a methodical pattern.  Instead the movie goer is shown a spider like contraption made of steel, which moves in a frighteningly uncontrolled manner.  The Zonelanders provide another possiblity for very interesting story development that never comes through.  It is hinted at that there is much there, but unfortunately we only get to see them for a few moments as part of the chase.Overall, The Imposter was fairly entertaining, but certainly could have been better.  On the DVD it is stated that the movie was originally concieved as a trilogy, but that during development it was decided to create a single movie.  I suspect that this is where things might have gone south.  We end up with neither a strong sci-fi flick, sci-horror flick, personal drama, or even fugitive chase.

698932,A40CCH74MOWE2,B0000640VR,T. D. Welsh,"[3, 3]","There is something insidious about a PKD plot. Many of them lend themselves to movie adaptation - for instance Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Blade Runner), We can remember it for you wholesale (Total Recall) and of course Minority Report. It's been 30 years since I read the story, but it was still pretty fresh in my mind. The script seems to stick pretty close to what PKD wrote, and that may be the problem. It distresses me to admit that a movie can go wrong by being too faithful to the story on which it is based, but that seems to have happened here. The lack of insight into the protagonist's feelings and thought processes limits the empathy you can feel for him, so the plot ends up as a kind of telescoped futuristic ""The Fugitive"". Gary Sinise does what he can with the lead role, with Madeleine Stowe even more muted as his wife. The two most colourful characters are Vincent D'Onofrio as the ambivalent Major Hathaway of Security, and Mekhi Phifer as the streetwise Cale.Bottom line - this is a story set in 2075 but written in about 1960, and that harms its credibility.

The Blu-ray transfer is poor.The budget of this low-rent P.K. Dick adaptation looks to have all gone into it's grimy, dystopian futuristic sets.  You'd expect more out of actor Gary Sinise who winces and squints his way through this movie as a doctor who is identified as essentially an alien clone who has replaced the actual doctor and is going to blow up some important person.  Sinise's Spencer Olham, a government scientist, just knows that the hack government team is wrong about him and that he has to prove them wrong somehow...or are they right?  Olham comes to doubt his psyche, but only minimally, and still is out to prove that he's the man that his wife (played by Madeline Stowe) believes him to be as well.  On his trail is the Hathaway (Vincent D'onofrio, a very capable actor who overexudes deliberate intensity that ends up coming off as almost comical).""Impostor"" is essentially a chase movie and the chase is enjoyable but not worthy of the suspense.  The ending, of course meant to overturn the viewer's world and leave us with a ""oh, snap!"" factor, comes off as predictable but ultimately generates some very nagging questions (a big one for me was, if the spacepod that crashed and caused the fire was so easy for Sinise to find as he runs along and practically stumbles on it after two minutes and it's also easy to get into and Hathaway seems to know what's inside then how come he doesn't know about what else is inside?

698936,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000640VR,Tsuyoshi,"[68, 74]","Facts first.  &quot;Impostor&quot; is based on P.K. Dick's short story and its cast include familiar faces in this sci-fi genre; Gary Sinise appeared in &quot;Mission to Mars&quot;: Vincent D'Onofrio in &quot;Men in Black&quot;: Madeleine Stowe in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; and Tony Shalhoub in &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; and &quot;Men in Black&quot; again.  Typecast?  You may think.  Forget it, and watch the names of director and writers.Gary Fleder is famous for the gripping thriller &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; but more impressive names are Ehren Kruger and David Twohy.  Kruger is responsible for &quot;Scream 3&quot; &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; and that shocker &quot;Arlington Road,&quot; and of course Twohy is a guy behind the camera of &quot;Pitch Black.&quot;  Now you know what I am going to say.  &quot;Impostor&quot; is very an unsettling movie, to say the least.And the original short story was written by P.K. Dick, master of creating an authentic view on the future world.  The film version respects that merit, and in the first three minutes throws you into the world at a devastating war with aliens in the shortest way.  After that, the film follows the protagonist, a scientist Spencer (Sinise), who, without his knowing, got involved in a plot whose nature should remain secret here.  As a result, Spencer runs away in a &quot;Fugitive&quot; fashion to prove the truth, hiding from the government agent (D'Onofrio) who is obsessed with hunting down every suspect in an uncompromising way.  Here the director Fleder keeps a good, fast pace from the surprising opening to the end, grabbing your attention throughout the movie.  The producion designs that realize the bleak future world (including a hospital where Stowe's character works, or ID system that recongize you anywhere you go) are, if familiar, very impressive visually.  Though the idea itself is not particularly new, the director guides you skillfully through the maze of the future world.This film has already been released theatrically in Japan with the title &quot;Clone&quot; in the autumn of 2001, and is originally based on a short film Fleder is said to have made.  Dimention Films first commissioned omnibus short sci-fi films from three directors, and one of them was Fleder's.  The company was so happy about his segment that they made it a feature film, which turned out to be &quot;Impostor.&quot;  As this production history suggests, &quot;Impostor&quot; suffers a little from the prolonged middle-section.  The episodes about stealing medicines, or unlikely friendship between a bounty hunter (Mekhi Phifer) and Spencer seems a bit contrived though still engaging in their ways.  And you may think that underrated Shalhoub is wasted again in a relatively minor role.However, as a whole I am satisfied with this adaptation of the sci-fi master P.K. Dick, and if you are interested in his name (or anyone involved in the film), have a look.  It is worth that.  But beware: this is not a film for everybody's taste.",4,It's P.K.Dick: Fugitive in the Future to Unsettle Your Heart,1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,3006,"['Facts', 'first', 'quot', 'Impostor', 'quot', 'based', 'P.K', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'cast', 'include', 'familiar', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'appeared', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Mars', 'quot', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'quot', 'Men', 'Black', 'quot', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'quot', '12', 'Monkeys', 'quot', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'quot', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'quot', 'quot', 'Men', 'Black', 'quot', 'again', 'Typecast', 'may', 'think', 'Forget', 'watch', 'names', 'director', 'writers.Gary', 'Fleder', 'famous', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'quot', 'more', 'impressive', 'names', 'are', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'David', 'Twohy', 'Kruger', 'responsible', 'quot', 'Scream', '3', 'quot', 'quot', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'quot', 'shocker', 'quot', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'quot', 'course', 'Twohy', 'guy', 'camera', 'quot', 'Pitch', 'Black.', 'quot', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'quot', 'Impostor', 'quot', 'very', 'unsettling', 'movie', 'say', 'least.And', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'P.K', 'Dick', 'master', 'creating', 'authentic', 'view', 'future', 'world', 'film', 'version', 'merit', 'first', 'three', 'minutes', 'world', 'devastating', 'war', 'aliens', 'shortest', 'way', 'film', 'protagonist', 'scientist', 'Spencer', 'Sinise', 'who', 'knowing', 'got', 'involved', 'plot', 'nature', 'should', 'remain', 'secret', 'here', 'result', 'Spencer', 'away', 'quot', 'Fugitive', 'quot', 'fashion', 'prove', 'truth', 'hiding', 'government', 'agent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'obsessed', 'hunting', 'down', 'suspect', 'uncompromising', 'way', 'Here', 'director', 'Fleder', 'good', 'fast', 'pace', 'surprising', 'opening', 'end', 'grabbing', 'attention', 'movie', 'producion', 'realize', 'bleak', 'future', 'world', 'including', 'hospital', 'where', 'Stowe', 'character', 'ID', 'system', 'recongize', 'anywhere', 'go', 'are', 'familiar', 'very', 'impressive', 'visually', 'idea', 'not', 'particularly', 'new', 'director', 'skillfully', 'maze', 'future', 'world.This', 'film', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Japan', 'title', 'quot', 'Clone', 'quot', 'autumn', '2001', 'originally', 'based', 'short', 'film', 'Fleder', 'said', 'have', 'made', 'Dimention', 'Films', 'first', 'commissioned', 'omnibus', 'short', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'three', 'directors', 'one', 'was', 'Fleder', 'company', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'segment', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quot', 'Impostor.', 'quot', 'production', 'history', 'quot', 'Impostor', 'quot', 'little', 'prolonged', 'middle-section', 'episodes', 'stealing', 'medicines', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Spencer', 'bit', 'contrived', 'still', 'engaging', 'ways', 'may', 'think', 'underrated', 'Shalhoub', 'wasted', 'again', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role.However', 'whole', 'am', 'satisfied', 'adaptation', 'sci-fi', 'master', 'P.K', 'Dick', 'are', 'interested', 'name', 'anyone', 'involved', 'film', 'have', 'look', 'worth', 'beware', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'taste']",Impostor

Imposter works best when Sinise, D'Onfrio and Stowe are on screen. Sinise gives one of his most sincere, powerful performances since Of Mice and Men (nearly a decade ago) and Truman. D'Onfrtio acts as the perfect foil to Sinise's brilliant scientist. The plot essentially boils down to this: Sinise plays a weapons designer who has come up with a device that could obliterate the alien enemy (much like the atomic bomb with the Japanese during WWII). He's the ultimate insider with his doubts about the ethical and moral decision to develop and use the device.D'Onfrio plays a the future equivelent of an FBI agent. He believes that Sinise's character has been murdered and replaced by a Cyborg with a mission to kill the leader of Earth. If the Fugitive like plot plays out like something you've seen before, keep in mind that there are enough plot twists and turns ahead to keep it interesting. Remember, there are, after all, only 36 dramatic situations and variations on these themes. Imposter just happens to use one that's very familiar and invert many of the expectations.If the film plays a little too long given its plot, keep in mind that this was originally developed as 1/3 of a triology of short films (the original short is included with the feature version). That and the fact that the script passed through at least 6 different writers' hands (four of whom are credited) might explain some of the minor plot holes. On the whole when Imposter works it works very well. Director Gary Fedler (Kiss The Girls) keeps the pace brisk and scenes short and to the point. Most of the optical effects are outstanding (although it's clear during the narrative set up at the beginning that the budget was quite thin at that point. The opticals don't quite measure up to some of the later visual effects.Imposter is a faithful adaption of Dick's short story (right down to the ending played with a slight variation that Dick would have loved). Although not as visually stunning or groundbreaking as Blade Runner, the narrative flow of Imposter is stronger than that classic film (although there are a few plot contrivances that are distracting). None of the adaptions of Dick's stories have been flawless (much like Dick's work itself). Dick's themes are intact: What makes us who we are; how do we define our reality and what qualities separate us from our machines?I belive over time that Imposter will turn out much like Blade Runner: that classic film was blasted by critics and disliked by much of the audience. Its reputation has grown with time and the advantage that video provides with reviewing a film. Imposter may lack much of the groundbreaking visual style of Blade Runner but it more than makes up for it with a strong narrative flow. Sure, the film is flawed but then so it Steve Spielberg's very good (if overpraised) adaption of Dick's Minority Report.What's most important about Imposter is the fact that it's a serious look at Dick's existential themes in a formula film. The twists and turns of Dick's original plot have been kept (or embellished) making the film entertaining. Between the outstanding cast, taunt direction, a well written (if padded) script and very good visual effects, Imposter manages to make a powerful statement about the nature of who we are in an entertaining sf format. 3 1/2 stars.",4,Solid and entertaining adaption of Dick's story,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,3426,"['pretty', 'common', 'theme', 'Dick', 'work', 'inversion', 'Hitchcock', 'wrong', 'man', 'theme', 'Imposter', 'best', 'when', 'Sinise', ""D'Onfrio"", 'Stowe', 'are', 'screen', 'Sinise', 'one', 'most', 'sincere', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Mice', 'Men', 'nearly', 'decade', 'ago', 'Truman', ""D'Onfrtio"", 'perfect', 'foil', 'Sinise', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'plot', 'essentially', 'down', 'Sinise', 'weapons', 'designer', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'device', 'could', 'obliterate', 'alien', 'enemy', 'much', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'Japanese', 'WWII', 'ultimate', 'insider', 'doubts', 'ethical', 'moral', 'decision', 'develop', 'use', ""device.D'Onfrio"", 'future', 'equivelent', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sinise', 'character', 'been', 'murdered', 'replaced', 'Cyborg', 'mission', 'kill', 'leader', 'Earth', 'Fugitive', 'plot', 'out', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'ahead', 'keep', 'interesting', 'Remember', 'are', 'only', '36', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'variations', 'themes', 'Imposter', 'just', 'use', 'one', 'very', 'familiar', 'invert', 'many', 'expectations.If', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'given', 'plot', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'originally', 'developed', '1/3', 'triology', 'short', 'films', 'original', 'short', 'included', 'feature', 'version', 'fact', 'script', 'passed', 'least', '6', 'different', 'writers', 'hands', 'four', 'whom', 'are', 'credited', 'might', 'explain', 'minor', 'plot', 'holes', 'whole', 'when', 'Imposter', 'very', 'well', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Fedler', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'pace', 'brisk', 'scenes', 'short', 'point', 'Most', 'optical', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'clear', 'narrative', 'set', 'up', 'beginning', 'budget', 'was', 'quite', 'thin', 'point', 'opticals', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'later', 'visual', 'effects.Imposter', 'faithful', 'adaption', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'right', 'down', 'ending', 'played', 'slight', 'variation', 'Dick', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'not', 'visually', 'stunning', 'groundbreaking', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'narrative', 'flow', 'Imposter', 'stronger', 'classic', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'are', 'distracting', 'None', 'adaptions', 'Dick', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'flawless', 'much', 'Dick', 'work', 'Dick', 'themes', 'are', 'intact', 'What', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'do', 'define', 'reality', 'what', 'qualities', 'separate', 'machines', 'belive', 'time', 'Imposter', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'much', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'blasted', 'critics', 'disliked', 'much', 'audience', 'reputation', 'grown', 'time', 'advantage', 'reviewing', 'film', 'Imposter', 'may', 'lack', 'much', 'groundbreaking', 'visual', 'style', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'more', 'up', 'strong', 'narrative', 'flow', 'Sure', 'film', 'flawed', 'then', 'Steve', 'Spielberg', 'very', 'good', 'overpraised', 'adaption', 'Dick', 'Minority', 'Report.What', 'most', 'important', 'Imposter', 'fact', 'serious', 'look', 'Dick', 'existential', 'themes', 'formula', 'film', 'twists', 'turns', 'Dick', 'original', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'embellished', 'making', 'film', 'entertaining', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'taunt', 'direction', 'well', 'written', 'padded', 'script', 'very', 'good', 'visual', 'effects', 'Imposter', 'make', 'powerful', 'statement', 'nature', 'who', 'are', 'entertaining', 'sf', 'format', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",Impostor

From the days of the spitting- smoking- cigar- trailing -off -into- the- universe-to the movie that changed all of that fake photography, (Kubricks) 2001: A Space Odyessey. Sci. Fi., began after that date in 1967. And most Directors who use space travel, have got to be weighed against that standard. So I tend to judge on how much tech. the movie puts out and how well they do it.P. K. Dick wrote this short story in 1953. And it relates to a short story in the movie.Earth is at war with the Alpha Centaurians and have been for 40,some years. Cities or under dome shields and the bombardment from the Centaurians is almost daily. There are those who inhabit the outer-areas, and they live by the code of the wild. Most are sick from radiation.Dr. Olham (Gary Sinise) &quot;Truman&quot;,&quot;Apppolo 13&quot;, has developed a weapon so strong that if deployed would alter the outcome of the war.Hathaway, (Vinvent D'Onofrio) &quot;The Velocity of Gary&quot;, &quot;The Cell&quot;, is head of the secret service in charge of capturing centaurians'- human replicants', they send to sabotage Earths leaders. Olham shows up on an intercepted message from the Alpha Cent. as a designated replicant. He is arrested and then escapes and the hunt is on. Mrs. Olham( Madeline stowe) &quot;12 Monkey's&quot;,'Last of The Mohigans', is a Dr. at the vet hospital. And in the end tries to help her husband prove his innocence! Wild cinematography, and solid acting. The end u can fill in from ur own Sci. FI., past.
