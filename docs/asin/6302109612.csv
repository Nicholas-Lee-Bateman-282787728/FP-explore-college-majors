SUDDENLY, CARS, GUNS DANGER, ADVENTURE, and WOMEN everywhere are all thrust into his lap, and things quickly begin getting a liiittle bit out of control.  So much so in fact that the fate of all of Europe, nay, perhaps the fate of the ENTIRE CONTINENT OR WORSE lies in this hapless teenager's hands.  Fortunately, he's not alone.  He's been lined up with a great deal of out-of-this-world secret agent gadgets, not to mention a car souped enough to make a Campbells CEO drool and certain X-trordinarily gargantuan technology thieves drool as well.

296211,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302109612,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 9/03, 5/08Rate: 65/08: If Looks Could Kill intends to be a cult film that works well for the first hour and then goes downhill in final thirty minutes. I liked the premise, and much of the first hour was quite funny. Although Richard Grieco has the looks, his acting is minimal, and he can be annoying as a know-nothing idiot. His one-liners sometimes stink and are corny. No surprise to me, his career never took off, but it is a good thing that Johnny Depp's did. Robin Bartlett, who plays The French Teacher, was fine and natural in her role for time being, and then she gradually got worse to the point where I screamed, ""Cut her out!"" I question Roger Daltrey's cameo as Blade as he appears extremely stiff, even more so than a 2 by 4 wood. The story of If Looks Could Kill is not bad, but it needs work. I wanted to see more development in the mystery department and more subplots as well as obstacles. In other words, I would say that there is an execution problem because the last half hour seemed to be threadbare due to sporadic effort. Michael Corben just seems to be transported to where he should be rather too easily. Strange, whoever wore X-Ray glasses, there is no nudity shown in the film. I think that part is what was hurting the film: not enough going-over-the-line. Although XXX is not a unique picture of the genre, it did improve greatly in certain areas where If Looks Could Kill failed in. The ending of If Looks Could Kill is anticlimactic at best as Steranko went down far without much struggle. Overall, I find If Looks Could Kill fun, enjoyable, and wacky, but how about If Stupidity Could Kill? Lucky for Richard Grieco, I am pushing the rating of the movie from `3' to `6'.",3,Good Fun Despite Problems with Execution.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1712,"['Viewed', '9/03', '5/08Rate', '65/08', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'be', 'cult', 'film', 'well', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'downhill', 'final', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'liked', 'premise', 'much', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'Richard', 'Grieco', 'looks', 'acting', 'minimal', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'know-nothing', 'idiot', 'one-liners', 'sometimes', 'stink', 'are', 'corny', 'surprise', 'career', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'good', 'thing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'Robin', 'Bartlett', 'who', 'French', 'Teacher', 'was', 'fine', 'natural', 'role', 'time', 'being', 'then', 'gradually', 'got', 'worse', 'point', 'where', 'screamed', 'Cut', 'out', 'question', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'cameo', 'as', 'Blade', 'extremely', 'stiff', 'even', 'more', 'so', '2', '4', 'wood', 'story', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'not', 'bad', 'work', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'development', 'mystery', 'department', 'more', 'subplots', 'as', 'well', 'obstacles', 'other', 'words', 'would', 'say', 'execution', 'problem', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'seemed', 'be', 'threadbare', 'due', 'sporadic', 'effort', 'Michael', 'Corben', 'just', 'be', 'transported', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'rather', 'too', 'easily', 'Strange', 'whoever', 'wore', 'X-Ray', 'glasses', 'nudity', 'shown', 'film', 'think', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'hurting', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'going-over-the-line', 'XXX', 'not', 'unique', 'picture', 'genre', 'did', 'improve', 'greatly', 'certain', 'areas', 'where', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'failed', 'ending', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'anticlimactic', 'best', 'Steranko', 'went', 'down', 'far', 'much', 'struggle', 'Overall', 'find', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'wacky', 'how', 'about', 'Stupidity', 'Could', 'Kill', 'Lucky', 'Richard', 'Grieco', 'am', 'pushing', 'rating', 'movie', '3', '6']",If Looks Could Kill VHS

296216,AIO247KHD2O40,6302109612,James N Simpson,"[2, 3]","This is one of the greatest movies of all time!  Although this was released in cinemas in 1991, poor marketing by Warner Bros meant it never achieved the success it should have on the big screen or even once released to video for that matter.  Word of mouth however in subsequent years turned this film into a cult classic. I know my copy certainly did the rounds of the houses of pretty much every other kid I knew in the early 90s. Unfortunately for the film none of the actors in it have gone on to become megastars, although you will certainly see a fair few of them in a vast number of films and supporting roles on TV shows.So what's this great film about?  Well basically it is a very well done teen parody of secret agent type films such as James Bond. Basically the CIA's top secret agent is killed by the minion Ilsa Grunt (played by Linda Hunt most famous as the principal in Kindergarten Cop) of the evil want to be ruler of Europe, supervillain Augustus Steranko (played by Roger Rees).  With his plans about to come into fruition, and a fear he may know all their current agents identities, there's no time for a new CIA agent to be trained.  Luckily there has been an agent deep undercover in the USA under the code name, Michael Corben.  Unfortunately for the CIA, Steranko knows about him and Grunt is sent to dispose of him before he gets on the plane.  Fortunately for the world though, Michael Corben (played by Richard Grienco best known for his former role as Officer Dennis Booker on 21 Jump Street) is also the name of a high school student who is failing French and needs to go to France with the French class to get extra credit to pass high school. He is also booked on the exact same flight. Since the British secret service don't know what the CIA agent looks like and Michael answers a phone call he thinks is from his mum before departure placed under the code name mother, it is naturally assumed he is Michael Corben, deep cover agent for the CIA.Separated on the flight from the rest of the French class, Michael takes advantage of what he assumes is a mistake by the airline of a seat in first class. He tells the flight attendants to make sure he isn't bothered by some crazy woman who thinks she knows him but in reality is his angry teacher Mrs Grober (played by Robin Bartlett). Unbeknownst to Michael he is also protected by an armed CIA agent who unwittingly alerts Isla Grunt that she has not in fact killed her man as he places a gun against the head of the French teacher with what has now become the classic line - Stay Away From Michael Corben!Whisked away at the airport by British Intelligence, Michael assumes they are busting him for sitting in first class and learns who they think he is.  He's not going to play along until they show him his million dollar sports car, so he tells them, yes he is Michael Corben deep cover agent for the CIA.  What follows is the funniest movie you'll ever see complete with spy gadgets such as X-ray sunglasses, a villain knocking out BO blast tuxedo and many others, all of which Michael of course has no idea how to use properly. His secret is only known by a beautiful girl called Mariska (played by Gabrielle Anwar) who pretty much keeps Michael on track of her murdered father's mission. Throw in the fact that his French class is mistaken by both sides to be enemy agents and his French teacher mistaken to be a deadly operative who must have got her name through teaching the French a lesson or two, and you've got the funniest action movie ever made.Note this movie was also released in the UK under the title Teen Agent so those searching may well want to look under that title on UK retailers sites under that name as well.",5,"Stay Away from Michael Corben!

296222,A1MUN0M965UR4O,6302109612,Kooshmeister,"[0, 1]","In the European nation of Orenbourg, the wealthy Augustus Steranko is in the middle of a shady deal with France's finance minister to acquire gold. When the Frenchman attempts to back out, Steranko promptly has him killed. Suddenly Britain's top secret agent Blade assaults Steranko's mansion, fighting his way through his guards, only to be felled by Steranko's diminutive right-hand woman Ilsa Grunt and her deadly whip.With Blade dead, the bigwigs over at MI6 need a replacement agent and fast. To this end, they enlist the aid of the CIA, who agree to loan them their best agent, one Michael Corben. A traitor in MI6 informs Ilsa of Agent Corben's impending arrival, and she leaves for America.In America, a different Michael Corben, a high school student, has a problem. Graduation has come up, but since he cut his French classes to go partying all year long, he doesn't have enough credits to pass; and at Edsel High, if you don't pass your foreign language class, you don't graduate. Fortunately, though, French teacher Mrs. Grober is going to give him one last chance. The French class is going on a field trip to France in the summer, and is Michael accompanies them, he'll be allowed to pass.So it is that a mixup occurs at the airport. Ilsa waylays and murders Michael Corben the CIA agent, whilst the identically-named Michael Corben the high school student unwittingly takes the dead spy's place on board the plane bound for France. He gets to sit in first class, much to Mrs. Grober's annoyance. Upon arriving in France, Michael is shanghaied by a British agent named Richardson and whisked away to a top-secret lab, despite his protests that he isn't the Michael Corben the British think he is. His protests end abruptly when he's shown the cool, gadget-laden red Lotus sports car he'll get to drive, and he decides he'll play along with the spy gig for a while if it means he gets to play with gadgets and avoid his fussy teacher.Meanwhile, Ilsa, thinking she murdered a decoy, assigns Zigesfeld, an assassin with a golden robotic hand, to follow and kill the ""real"" Agent Corben. Also tailing Michael is a mysterious woman with some connection to the murdered Blade. Additionally, Mrs. Grober's noisy search for her missing student has MI6 thinking she is an assassin out to kill Michael; likewise, Steranko thinks she's working for MI6. Both groups set out to have her and her class eliminated, and when they end up captured by Zigesfeld and taken to Steranko's mansion, it's up to Michael and the mysterious woman to rescue them and stop Steranko's evil plans.Written by The Monster Squad director Fred Dekker, If Looks Could Kill is a love letter to the over-the-top action films of the 60's and 70's. Unfortunately, it's a disjointed movie, tonally. On the one hand, it's too simplistic and juvenile for adults... but at the same time it's too complicated and violent for kids. It's definitely a film that failed to find an audience. Also, despite supposedly being a spoof (it tends to get categorized as a comedy), its content is played dead serious a lot of the time, especially towards the end.This was supposed to be Richard Grieco's big break, but, alas, the movie underperformed and he never quite made it. The really great performances, though, are the villains. Roger Rees is a bit hard to swallow as the hammy Steranko, while Linda Hunt, who projects subtle, quiet menace as Ilsa, and Canadian actor Tom Rack, who has only one line in the entire film, and acts primarily with his eyes and mannerisms, and in so doing conveys barely-suppressed homicidal mania. He's definitely one of cinema's scarier henchmen characters.The action sequences are hit and miss. Blade's assault on Steranko's mansion at the beginning is neat, but is over too quickly and poorly edited. The car chase in France is slow-moving and kind of uninteresting despite the soundtrack trying to convince us otherwise. This leaves the climax, involving a shootout with hordes of henchmen who can't aim (of course), a fistfight with Zigesfeld, and finally an attempted escape by Steranko which ends in one of the most hilariously awful helicopter crashes ever put to film. If the first half disappoints when it comes to action, then the finale definitely delivers.",4,A decent enough action flick.,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,4262,"['European', 'nation', 'Orenbourg', 'wealthy', 'Augustus', 'Steranko', 'middle', 'shady', 'deal', 'France', 'finance', 'minister', 'acquire', 'gold', 'When', 'Frenchman', 'back', 'out', 'Steranko', 'promptly', 'killed', 'Suddenly', 'Britain', 'top', 'secret', 'agent', 'Blade', 'Steranko', 'mansion', 'fighting', 'way', 'guards', 'only', 'be', 'felled', 'Steranko', 'diminutive', 'right-hand', 'woman', 'Ilsa', 'Grunt', 'deadly', 'whip.With', 'Blade', 'dead', 'bigwigs', 'MI6', 'need', 'replacement', 'agent', 'fast', 'end', 'enlist', 'aid', 'CIA', 'who', 'agree', 'loan', 'best', 'agent', 'one', 'Michael', 'Corben', 'traitor', 'MI6', 'informs', 'Ilsa', 'Agent', 'Corben', 'impending', 'arrival', 'America.In', 'America', 'different', 'Michael', 'Corben', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'problem', 'Graduation', 'come', 'up', 'cut', 'French', 'classes', 'go', 'partying', 'year', 'long', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'credits', 'pass', 'Edsel', 'High', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'foreign', 'language', 'class', 'do', ""n't"", 'graduate', 'Fortunately', 'though', 'French', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Grober', 'going', 'give', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'French', 'class', 'going', 'field', 'trip', 'France', 'summer', 'Michael', ""'ll"", 'be', 'allowed', 'pass.So', 'mixup', 'airport', 'Ilsa', 'waylays', 'murders', 'Michael', 'Corben', 'CIA', 'agent', 'whilst', 'identically-named', 'Michael', 'Corben', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'unwittingly', 'dead', 'spy', 'place', 'board', 'plane', 'bound', 'France', 'sit', 'first', 'class', 'much', 'Mrs.', 'Grober', 'annoyance', 'arriving', 'France', 'Michael', 'shanghaied', 'British', 'agent', 'named', 'Richardson', 'whisked', 'away', 'top-secret', 'lab', 'protests', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'Corben', 'British', 'think', 'protests', 'end', 'abruptly', 'when', 'shown', 'cool', 'gadget-laden', 'red', 'Lotus', 'sports', 'car', ""'ll"", 'get', 'drive', ""'ll"", 'play', 'along', 'spy', 'gig', 'while', 'play', 'gadgets', 'avoid', 'fussy', 'teacher.Meanwhile', 'Ilsa', 'thinking', 'murdered', 'decoy', 'assigns', 'Zigesfeld', 'assassin', 'golden', 'robotic', 'hand', 'follow', 'kill', 'real', 'Agent', 'Corben', 'Also', 'tailing', 'Michael', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'connection', 'murdered', 'Blade', 'Additionally', 'Mrs.', 'Grober', 'noisy', 'search', 'missing', 'student', 'MI6', 'thinking', 'assassin', 'kill', 'Michael', 'likewise', 'Steranko', 'working', 'MI6', 'groups', 'set', 'out', 'have', 'class', 'eliminated', 'when', 'end', 'up', 'captured', 'Zigesfeld', 'taken', 'Steranko', 'mansion', 'up', 'Michael', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'rescue', 'stop', 'Steranko', 'evil', 'plans.Written', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'director', 'Fred', 'Dekker', 'Looks', 'Could', 'Kill', 'love', 'letter', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'films', '60', '70', 'Unfortunately', 'disjointed', 'movie', 'tonally', 'one', 'hand', 'too', 'simplistic', 'juvenile', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'too', 'complicated', 'violent', 'kids', 'definitely', 'film', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'Also', 'supposedly', 'being', 'spoof', 'get', 'categorized', 'comedy', 'content', 'played', 'dead', 'serious', 'lot', 'time', 'especially', 'end.This', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Richard', 'Grieco', 'big', 'break', 'alas', 'movie', 'underperformed', 'never', 'quite', 'made', 'really', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'villains', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'hammy', 'Steranko', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'who', 'projects', 'subtle', 'quiet', 'menace', 'Ilsa', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Rack', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'line', 'entire', 'film', 'primarily', 'eyes', 'mannerisms', 'so', 'doing', 'conveys', 'barely-suppressed', 'homicidal', 'mania', 'definitely', 'one', 'cinema', 'scarier', 'henchmen', 'characters.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Blade', 'assault', 'Steranko', 'mansion', 'beginning', 'neat', 'over', 'too', 'quickly', 'poorly', 'edited', 'car', 'chase', 'France', 'slow-moving', 'kind', 'uninteresting', 'soundtrack', 'trying', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'climax', 'involving', 'shootout', 'hordes', 'henchmen', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'aim', 'course', 'fistfight', 'Zigesfeld', 'finally', 'attempted', 'escape', 'Steranko', 'one', 'most', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'helicopter', 'crashes', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'disappoints', 'when', 'action', 'then', 'finale', 'definitely', 'delivers']",If Looks Could Kill VHS
