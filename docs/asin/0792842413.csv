Later we see a man laying on the beach, as if washed ashore. He later jumps off a bridge into the water. [Symbolism?] At the church pagers start beeping to recall the group. At an eastern Mediterranean port there is a reaction to the shooting down of that helicopter. The SEAL team rescues the survivors and neutralizes the enemy. Two men form a rear guard. There is plenty of action and gunfire; it is well orchestrated. Back in Washington top officials worry about those Stinger missiles. [Did the Reagan Administration give them away without forethought?] Back home the team relaxes at a golf course. You shouldn't park in a `No Parking' zone.SEAL Command has a plan to retrieve those missiles. This time they take the boat to their destination. Someone sees them. An explosion awakes the passengers. The team takes over the ship on the high seas, but find nothing. One man approaches a reporter to ask questions. We see their realistic training; only 10% pass the course. Will that journalist provide information? A Stinger in Spain shoots down an airplane. Washington picks a target, but he has been a source of information. They plan to ""extract"" him. The team jumps from an airplane into the sea, and goes ashore. Will things go as planned? Will Hawkins make a rash decision? There is sad news and a funeral. ""A training accident?"" They mourn at a bar. Hawkins acknowledges his mistake. Later they learn where those missiles are stored, and plan to destroy them in Beirut. A man will guide them to the site.They are armed with AK-47 rifles so their shots will not sound different. They find the Stingers and prepare an explosion to destroy them. The dawn brings activity and more shooting. The explosion causes the destruction of the building, it ""pancakes"" upon itself. [Was this an inspiration for others?] There is a car hijacking too. The team escapes to the seashore. Can they rendezvous with the submarine in time? Can they survive an attack? Then the submarine picks them from the sea for a happy ending. This is an interesting story. I think it runs on a little too long. Was this movie meant as advertising for Navy SEALS? Is there a subtle criticism about their actions in invading a foreign country?Why did those missiles get into the possession of terrorists?

This is an action film that definitely fits the 1980s style of Hollywood action movies. In that respect, it's pretty good. A large portion of the film is actually dedicated to action scenes and operations. However, that's also part of the downside of the movie. There is very little character development or even plot development for that matter. The movie seems to be little more than a series of scenes in which the SEAL team flips between the US and missions in the Middle East, with no mention of the travel time between. Since the debut of this movie there have been so many movies, documentaries and books about these kinds of units and others that the movie seems kind of quaint and out-of-touch with reality. The supposedly Arabic venues don't seem too bad, but the Arabic actors are a bit cheesy compared to those in more current films, and as mentioned before, the SEAL aspect seems a bit contrived and unrealistic. However, if you can put those concerns aside, this is a fairly watchable film. The characters that make up the SEAL team are interesting and even quirky in some cases without going over the top and the Middle Eastern situations are just realistic enough to make that part of the movie seem plausible.

Based on the (1) the subject matter and (2) the cast, it looks well-positioned to make a great, semi-serious, action bonanza.  However, based on (1) terrible direction, (2) flat, self-contradicting characters and (3) bad writing, it turns into a big boring slog.  It tries to jump between overly serious and awkwardly attempting humor at all the wrong times.  It's hard to put my finger on what is so dull about it, but here's one example:  At one point, a key character is wounded badly in the heat of battle.  It seems like if there was ever a time to create tension and excitement, this would be it, right?  The jokes and humor are for back at the barracks, right?  Wrong.  The barracks feature cheesy &#34;serious&#34; acting, and when a hero is badly shot in the heat of battle, the movie attempts strange humor by making a joke of how he gets &#34;high&#34; on morphine.  So as his teammates carry his bloody carcass, he's smiling and laughing.  This would be okay, but this movie feels like half the scene are from &#34;Hot Shot&#34; and the other half are from some really violent intense drama.  Just weird.  I wish they had chosen to either make it serious and dramatic or a big fun action romp.

It is also topical as Islamic terrorists are the current primary public exterior enemy. This story opens with a Navy SEAL team on the ground freeing a group of hostages. During the extrication they discover several crates of powerful Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. An attempt to destroy the missiles fails and the commander of the team makes the decision to leave rather than commit a heroic suicide.Some of their superiors object to this action and the pressure increases when a Stinger is used to shoot down a civilian aircraft. In an intense effort to discover the location of the missiles, Lt. Curran, the SEAL team leader, begins a relationship with a female reporter with contacts in the Middle East. After learning of the location, the team goes into Beirut and must fight its way in and out of the city.There is a lot of intense action, some humorous moments and some incredible stupidity committed by the Charlie Sheen character.

Yes, boredum the movie's biggest problem.  This is by far the dullest action movie I've seen in years, maybe even of all-time.What's the plot?  Who cares?  It's just bare bones enough to string up some action sequences, but unfortunately, the action scenes smell of made-for-TV quality.  Heck, some of the stuff that's made-for-TV these days features better action (i.e. Band of Brothers).  Director Lewis Teague obviously doesn't know much more than the good old point-and-shoot method, meaning he's got no style or, for that matter, a sense of direction.  People shoot, get shot, and it's a basic, routine pattern that continues for all the gunfights.  There are no cool stunts, outrageous situations, or edgy tension during all these scenes.The way it is for me is that movies involving commando teams are rarely ever exciting, mainly because it's a bunch of tough guys who seem invincible, even when a couple of them get killed.  Oh, don't get me wrong, there are notable exceptions (such as the nail-biter Executive Decision), but Navy Seals sure isn't one of them.  The film never builds up any suspense because the villains never seem like a threat.  None of the bad guys are even the slightest bit menacing.  Already, at least half the movie's effectiveness is gone.But the ""heroes"" are just as lame and uninteresting.  For these parts, acting's what you'd expect.  Charlie Sheen plays himself, annoying and idiotic as usual.  Michael Biehn is the tough-as-nails commander, a role he can do in his sleep, though he plays the part so straight he might just induce some sleep in the viewers.  Nobody else makes an impression, not even the usually funny Bill Paxton.I don't have much more to say about Navy Seals, other than its third-rate, silly crap that fails on every intended level.  It's dull plot and premise won't make this an enjoyable movie to trash in a crowd, and its boring execution will put a lot of viewers to sleep.

I believe i saw parts or the whole filmmany years ago on tv. I didn`t expect it to be so good, so i was suprised. I like this kind of film.Picture Quality: 4/5I think it looked good. I see it hashas only a MPEG-2 encode on a 25 GB disc, but i still think it`s good.Yes, it would have looked better using a encode like MPEG-4 and 50 GB disc, but i don`t expect them to usethat and re-release it again. I think the colours and details looks pretty sharp and detailed. It was goodenough for me.Audio Quality: 4/5I think the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 had mixed results. I think the first action scene in the film, where they usethose MP5`s(i believe), sounded best. The gunfire effects had good bass. In the end shootout where they usedAK-47`s, i think the gunfire effects lacked bass. They should had more bass. The explosions coming out of mysubwoofer in this film, impressed me. The music and dialog was good coming from the Center speaker.The Surround speakers was used for some music and of course used in the action scenes. I heard bullets andemptied shells, and such in the surround speakers. That Sniper rifle that is used perhaps 2 times in this film,was very impressive. I think it had pretty deep bass.

Seeing it back then you'd probably tell your guys, ""Oh, we HAVE to rent this! It's with that guy from the Terminator and that guy from Platoon!"" That not having to be a good thing escaped you back in the day.This movie now feels quite dated, not to mention perverse. It reminds you of how Sheen a little later would make Hot Shots and realise this was a joke on Top Gun, and with Part Deux, a joke on Rambo. NAVY SEALS can be forgiven not getting the joke, it can't be forgiven smelling like Reagans big boy diapers. The other day I saw a short documentary on the excellent Dirty Harry box set (blu-ray), discussing wether or not Dirty Harry is fascist. That reminded me of how the fascist word (which is thrown around too much these days), was thrown at Starship Troopers a few years back. But that was a film with tongue in cheek, and was done so intentionally. So, most people with a fleeting knowledge should have got it. This film NAVY SEALS, is NOT tongue in cheek. If a tongue came near a cheek here, it would be to demonstrate some latent male homophobia, or perhaps to demonstrate something lude to women.That leads me to my main critizism of this this film now. It feels constructed for our benefit, like a fascist society NAVY recruitment film. All the jokes, all the action are done with robotic presission, with no room for afterthought, or gut feeling.Made in an era where muslim arabs were still mostly something that got beat up by Israelis, and had to be watched closely so the didn't ally themselves with the evil Soviets, much have changed.
