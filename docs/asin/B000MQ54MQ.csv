1048919,A31N1LSANGQ3UB,B000MQ54MQ,Dave K,"[11, 11]","I guess I am one of the few Flashman readers who liked this film. I agree that Royal Flash is one of Fraser's weaker novels (probably my least favorite of the series), but I think Lester, with Fraser doing the screenplay did a good job. The two had collaborated to even greater effect with their classic adaptation of The Three Musketeers a few years earlier, and must have jumped at the chance to work again. It is too bad they did not start with the first novel, but I imagine it would have required a huge budget, whereas Royal Flash is mainly about personalities.I thought Malcolm McDowell made a splendid Flashman. I think he looked the right proper Victorian gentleman/soldier, and he excelled at depicting Flashy as the craven poltroon he was. His opening monologue, as he tells the students to do their duty, while flashbacks show what a coward he was, perfectly depicts the character. I think McDowell even resembles some of the original cover illustrations for some of the paperbacks, and I sort of imagine his voice when I read the novels. I know Fraser imagined Errol Flynn in the role, but Flynn died in 1959, and his like has really not been seen in films since his death. Malcolm McDowell in his youth really specialized in playing smirking anti-heroes who seemed to have some depth underneath but really, they didn't.I also liked the use of the Wagner music. The film is set (more or less) during the time Wagner composed in Bavaria, and I thought his heroic music was a good counterpoint to Flashy's cowardice. The supporting cast is a dream, with Oliver Reed (as Bismarck), Florinda Bolkan (as Lola Montes), Britt Eklund and Alan Bates. It is beautifully shot in Bavaria with authentic castles making it a sumptuous production.What is wrong with the film? As many said, the plot is scarcely more than a rewrite of the classic novel The Prisoner of Zenda. So, there are few surprises here (though this treatment is decidedly bawdier). Also, Lester cannot resist""one joke too many"" in all the scenes, putting in as many sight gags and sotto voce mutterings as he can. What worked in A Hard Day's Night and The Three Musketeers seems like overkill in this film. The material was already witty and clever enough and did not need so much ""help"" from Lester.As to the DVD itself: there is nice little feature that gives an overview of the character of Flashman, and how Fraser researched and wrote the novels, etc. There is a feature on adapting Flashman to the screen, and you can listen to the music score on an isolated track. I thought the picture looked a bit ""soft"", but that could be the way it was shot in the 70's, or else, they could not find better print material.

Wedekind ""Mr. Weekend""","[11, 14]","Simply put, this was not a very good film adaptation of the novel, even though author George MacDonald Fraser wrote the screenplay. Too, casting Malcolm McDowell (light colored hair/blue-eyes, 5' 8"" tall, and weighing 140lbs dripping wet) as the bluff rogue Flashman (black hair and black moustache/dark brown-eyes, 6' tall, and weighing in at 13 stone = 180lbs) was totally wrong.

So many good actors gone to waste, except for Oliver Reed's performance as Otto von Bismark which was super. Perhaps I expected too much, especially after viewing GMF's splendid screenplay adaptations of THE THREE MUSKETEERS/THE FOUR MUSKETEERS.I understand that the folks who filmed the SHARPE TV series are interested in doing a FLASHMAN series for British TV.

1048929,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000MQ54MQ,Utah Blaine,"[7, 11]","This film is an adaptation of the second novel (of the same name) of George Macdonald Fraser's Flashman series.  This film has some moments, but not enough to move this above a middlin' work.  There are just too many serious flaws.  First, and most importantly, the director and screenwriter tried to portray some of the bawdy, un-PC humor of Flashman with a campy, lighthearted style.  If you've ever read any of the  Flashman novels, particularly the early ones, you know what I mean when I say it would take a brave director in today's PC world to faithfully reproduce Flashy on the big screen.  The management team of this film took the easy way out and made Flashy into a comic book character.  Fraser himself was the screenwriter!  Second, the choice of Wagner to score the movie was horrible.  I think that this was an attempt to give the film a heavy German feel, but the effect of using music from the Ring cycle was totally misguided.  I would say laughably ridiculous.  Third, the Bismarck character came off as a quasi-Nazi `obsessed with his destiny' to unify Germany.  Fundamentally, the writer/director/produced failed to recreate the atmosphere and the `feel' of the Flashman novels.  There are several positives to this film. Malcolm McDowell, for all his other achievements (and this is far from his best film), was put on this earth to play Flashman.  He has the Flashy smirk, and can carry himself with the craven arrogance of old Harry Paget.  There are also several great scenes.  Flashy engineering a boxing lesson between Bismarck and the boxing champ simply to see Bismarck get pounded is particularly well done and hilarious (and true to Flashy!).  Florinda Bolkin does a superb job with the role of Lola Montez.  Bottom line is that this is a decent film, but it doesn't remotely do justice to Flashman.  If you think the Flashman novels are brilliant (as I do), you're going to be disappointed in this film.",3,Flat adaptation of George Macdonald Fraser's terrific novel,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1935,"['film', 'adaptation', 'second', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'George', 'Macdonald', 'Fraser', 'Flashman', 'series', 'film', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'move', 'middlin', 'work', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'serious', 'flaws', 'First', 'most', 'importantly', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'tried', 'portray', 'bawdy', 'un-PC', 'humor', 'Flashman', 'campy', 'lighthearted', 'style', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'Flashman', 'novels', 'particularly', 'early', 'ones', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'would', 'take', 'brave', 'director', 'today', 'PC', 'world', 'faithfully', 'reproduce', 'Flashy', 'big', 'screen', 'management', 'team', 'film', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'made', 'Flashy', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Fraser', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'Second', 'choice', 'Wagner', 'score', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'think', 'was', 'attempt', 'give', 'film', 'heavy', 'German', 'feel', 'effect', 'using', 'music', 'Ring', 'cycle', 'was', 'totally', 'misguided', 'would', 'say', 'laughably', 'ridiculous', 'Third', 'Bismarck', 'character', 'came', 'off', 'quasi-Nazi', 'obsessed', 'destiny', 'unify', 'Germany', 'Fundamentally', 'writer/director/produced', 'failed', 'recreate', 'atmosphere', 'feel', 'Flashman', 'novels', 'are', 'several', 'positives', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'other', 'achievements', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'earth', 'play', 'Flashman', 'Flashy', 'smirk', 'can', 'carry', 'craven', 'arrogance', 'old', 'Harry', 'Paget', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'great', 'scenes', 'Flashy', 'engineering', 'boxing', 'lesson', 'Bismarck', 'boxing', 'champ', 'simply', 'see', 'Bismarck', 'get', 'pounded', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'hilarious', 'true', 'Flashy', 'Florinda', 'Bolkin', 'superb', 'job', 'role', 'Lola', 'Montez', 'Bottom', 'line', 'decent', 'film', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'do', 'justice', 'Flashman', 'think', 'Flashman', 'novels', 'are', 'brilliant', 'do', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film']",Royal Flash
