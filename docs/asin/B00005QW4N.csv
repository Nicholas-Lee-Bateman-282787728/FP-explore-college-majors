Little did I know that I would fall in love with all the characters.I came to this series originally after watching ""The Mating Game"" starring Debbie Reynolds, Tony Randall, Paul Douglas, and Fred Clark, which is more of a PG comedy based on the same characters based on  first book of ""The Darling buds of May"" written by  H.E.

675738,A2ZCXIZHS191TG,B00005QW4N,Fred Anonymous Smith,"[30, 87]","I cannot believe how some here are describing this television series. Life affirming? The best thing on TV? English charm? It's like we watched entirely different shows. In truth, the father, ""Pop"" Larkin (played by David Jason), is a rogue in every sense of the word - an unmarried unemployed alcoholic with seven children, an irresponsible parent, con artist, and outright criminal. Pop claims he cannot afford to pay taxes, but he does ""find"" many thousands to spend on property, houses, businesses, expensive vacations, and a Roman-style swimming pool. He allows his house to be roofed with stolen materials, enjoying the savings from that, while also using that knowledge to blackmail the roofers into doing his daughter's school as well (most likely also with stolen materials). Similar content goes on throughout the entire series. Pop's live-in girlfriend, ""Ma"" (played by Pam Ferris), isn't much better. She has a similar problem with alcohol and often goes along with, and even occasionally participates in, many of Pop's shenanigans. In other words, neither of these characters could seriously be described as wholesome or even appealing - especially if one were on the receiving end of their con games or similar mischief (like most around them would be).The oldest daughter, Mariette (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), is overly flirtatious and a bit of a tramp. She starts off the series believing she is pregnant, with not a clue, according to the mother, who the father might be. During the rest of the series, when she isn't eyeballing, smiling at, playing with, or paying excessive attention to, guys are the beach, male visitors at the house, or just guys she meets, she's kissing others in their apartments or wherever is convenient. Mariette clearly has no respect for her husband, Charlie (played by Philip Franks). When she isn't rolling her eyes and snickering at him behind his back, she is often addressing him as ""Charley"" in a manner almost reeking of contempt. To get an idea how she often says that name, try saying it as you would to the most lowest, pitiful, contemptible, person you can think of.Of course, Charlie does have one or two moments in the series. In one episode, a woman (a local teacher) is attracted to him. When she throws herself at him, Mariette sees this and runs off to be with her current boyfriend (and the show makes it clear we're supposed to feel sorry or empathy for her). By the way, Charley isn't even the character's real name. Mariettte and the family thought his ""real"" name was too comical, so they simply renamed him (after they finished laughing at him, of course). Anyway, this unemployed couple, with the help of Pop's shenanigans and a few of their own, are rather unbelieveably able to mortgage a home, buy a hops garden, and eventually gain an entire brewery (all in a single year according to the show).Ma and Pop Larkin don't seem particularily troubled by their second oldest daughter's (Primrose, played in later eposides by Abigail Rokison) utter abandon around boys (grossly exaggerated compared to the typical teenager, especially in the 50's). In the meantime, this daughter throws herself, sometimes literally, at every young male that comes along - Charley (her sister's husband), the church vicar, a roofer, a construction laborer, and so on. Towards the end of the series, the then sixteen year old runs away to Liverpool to be with an obviously much older young man met only a few days earlier. When she finally calls, Ma and Pop Larkin, ever the concerned parents (sarcasm), simply give her permission to stay.The remaining characters in the series range from fairly normal to grossly stereotyped, with performances by the various actors ranging from very poor to just average. None really stand out in any particular way.The show itself (costumes, liberal attitudes, and so on) is not at all accurate for the time period it is based (again, the early 50's). For example, in the beach scenes mentioned above, Mariette, and the guys she flirts with, are absurdly wearing very skimpy bikini-style bathing suits. Indeed, Mariette, supposedly a country girl growing up on a farm, is far too often seen in elaborate fashions, hair-styles, and excessive makeup, inappropriate or inaccurate for the period. As for the liberal attitudes, the locals in one episide are heavily criticised (described as ""racist"" and ""intolerant"") for having negative feelings towards a German visiting the area. While that might be true today, those feelings would have been entirely reasonable and appropriate at that time considering the country had lost a few million in a bitter war with Germany just a few years earlier - and the German initially claiming to be from Denmark certainly did little to foster trust or more positive feelings.I was originally drawn into this series by the nice scenery and the then seemingly innocuous, even humorous, behavor of the family. However, the characters and storyline become increasingly more negative as the series goes along (more alcohol, more con games, more unseemly behavior, and so on), with the characters growing less appealing and the series less humorious in tandem with that. Pop Larkin, for example, almost immediately goes from a poor farmer who can't afford taxes to a man throwing money around while avoiding taxes. His con games and collaborators also get more sleazy as the series goes along. Much of the rest of the family (and the show itself) go through a similar progression.Regardless, this comedy/drama series does at least have a few entertaining moments, humorous moments, and even one or two heart-warming family-like moments. One just has to sit through a whole lot of negative content to get to those few moments.",2,Too much negative content,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,5744,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'here', 'are',

Later a young, weak, & skinny tax collector came to the farm for back taxes, while the older farmer tried constantly to change the subject.What did we buy? Did we waste our money? No, once the characters came into focus, ""Darling Buds of May"" became ""Perfik"" (this is how Pa Larkin, the farmer, constantly says Perfect through out the series). This is a 1991 to 1993 British TV series adaptation from H.E. Bates books about the Larkins, a large growing family going through the fast social changes after World War 2 in the Kent farming area of England. At least in the TV series Pa Larkin (David Jason) is a lighthearted, woman chancing, hard drinking, con artist that never really means to hurt anyone. Ma Larkin (Pam Ferris) is his well-rounded laughable mistress (comes close to being his wife after 6 children) that holds down the farm. The oldest daughter Mariette (Catherine Zeta Jones), from a corruption of Marie Antoinette, the town beauty & flirt, marries the young & timid tax collector turned amateur egg farmer to beer brewer owner Charley (Philip Franks), who joins Pa Larkin to live under the socialist radar. Learn how to make money while not paying the government, make breakfast with katsup for every meal, drink fancy hard drinks & get over hang overs, & kiss the girls & tell. Travel to France in an old Yellow Rolls Royce & get mistaken for a Lord, or take a ""Magic Mystery Tour"" to a beat up Chateau.

675747,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00005QW4N,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[35, 35]","Set in idyllic Kent (the Garden of England) in the 1950s, The Darling Buds of May is truly one of the sweetest, most relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable British comedy-dramas on the market.  Indeed, if you enjoy classic shows like All Creatures Great and Small or The Irish R.M. for example, I really think you'll enjoy this lovely series that's perfect for the whole family to curl up and watch time and time again.The series revolves around the ever-growing Larkin family.  David Jason (A Touch of Frost, Only Fools and Horses, Open All Hours) stars as patriarch Sydney ""Pop"" Larkin.  Jason is a wonderful actor (one of my favourites), and if you're familiar with (and enjoy) his other roles, you'll enjoy him here, for he embues Pop with his distinctive touch of comedy.  Pop is a bit of a character, to say the least.  He pays no income tax, he's not above a little wheeling and dealing, he often rides a little too close to the line, and his farm is somewhat ramshackle.  But he's got a heart of gold, and he's kind and generous to a fault.  What's more, he's a man with a strong sense of personal integrity who knows what is important in life--friends, family, and their idyllic way of life--and he's not above running a little scam of his own if it's to even the score with someone who's taking advantage of one less fortunate.Then there is Ma Larkin, a very rotund, jolly woman who, for all the children she's got, is not actually married to Pop.  Somehow, though, it just doesn't seem to matter--at least not to them nor to us.  As for Ma's weight, it just isn't an issue either (which, I might add, is a refreshing change!); in fact, if anything, it`s evidence of health and heartiness.  Ma and Pop are a somewhat eccentric couple, however.  Ma's a fantastic cook and she and Pop aren't ashamed to eat--even in the bathtub or in bed.  Then there's Pop's penchant for the odd ""extramarital"" kiss, which is done with Ma's full knowledge and consent.  Odd as his actions may be, they really aren't as immoral as they may sound; rather, they provide further evidence of his caring nature, for as often as not, Pa's attentions serve to bring a little joy to a few otherwise very lonely and neglected wallflowers.Other family members include the beautiful eldest daughter, Mariette (played by a 22-year-old Catherine Zeta Jones), the pretty but boy-crazy Primrose, son Montgomery, the twins Zinnia and Petunia, the youngest daughter Victoria (who does enjoy playing the odd prank on her older siblings), and Oscar (the newest addition).The series was filmed in 1992 and consists of nine 100-minute episodes (each of which is split into two 50-minute parts), one 50-minute Christmas Special, and one concluding 50-minute episode.  The Christmas Special (which is the first episode on the last tape) should be watched after the third episode entitled ""A Breath of French Air,"" as that is where it fits in chronologically.  As a point of interest, fans of David Jason may be interested to know that his real-life elder brother (Arthur White) plays Pop's brother in the episode entitled ""When the Green Woods Laugh.""In conclusion, this is a lovely, warm-hearted series which celebrates life in a simpler time--a time one wishes one could hold onto forever.  And it reminds us of what really matters in life.  It's perfect for unwinding at the end of a long day--or as Pop would say, it's ""perfick""!  Extremely highly recommended.  (And if you enjoy the series (and I'm sure you will), I strongly recommend the novels by H.E. Bates upon which the first few episodes are based--they're simply wonderful!)",5,One of the Best British Comedy-Dramas Ever!,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,3600,"['Set', 'idyllic', 'Kent', 'Garden', 'England', '1950s', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', 'truly', 'one', 'sweetest', 'most', 'relaxing', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'British', 'comedy-dramas', 'market', 'Indeed', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'shows', 'Creatures', 'Great', 'Small', 'Irish', 'R.M', 'example', 'really', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'lovely', 'series', 'perfect', 'whole', 'family', 'curl', 'up', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again.The', 'series', 'ever-growing', 'Larkin', 'family', 'David', 'Jason', 'A', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', 'Open', 'All', 'Hours', 'patriarch', 'Sydney', 'Pop', 'Larkin', 'Jason', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'one', 'favourites', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'enjoy', 'other', 'roles', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'here', 'Pop', 'distinctive', 'touch', 'comedy', 'Pop', 'bit', 'character', 'say', 'least', 'income', 'tax', 'not', 'little', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'often', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'line', 'farm', 'somewhat', 'ramshackle', 'got', 'heart', 'gold', 'kind', 'generous', 'fault', 'What', 'more', 'man', 'strong', 'sense', 'personal', 'integrity', 'who', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'friends', 'family', 'idyllic', 'way', 'life', 'not', 'running', 'little', 'scam', 'own', 'even', 'score', 'someone', 'who', 'taking', 'advantage', 'one', 'less', 'fortunate.Then', 'Ma', 'Larkin', 'very', 'rotund', 'jolly', 'woman', 'who', 'children', 'got', 'not', 'actually', 'married', 'Pop', 'Somehow', 'though', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'least', 'not', 'Ma', 'weight', 'just', ""n't"", 'issue', 'might', 'add', 'refreshing', 'change', 'fact', 'anything', 's', 'evidence', 'health', 'heartiness', 'Ma', 'Pop', 'are', 'somewhat', 'eccentric', 'couple', 'however', 'Ma', 'fantastic', 'cook', 'Pop', 'are', ""n't"", 'ashamed', 'eat', 'even', 'bathtub', 'bed', 'Then', 'Pop', 'penchant', 'odd', 'extramarital', 'kiss', 'done', 'Ma', 'full', 'knowledge', 'consent', 'actions', 'may', 'be', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'immoral', 'may', 'sound', 'rather', 'provide', 'further', 'evidence', 'caring', 'nature', 'as', 'often', 'not', 'Pa', 'attentions', 'serve', 'bring', 'little', 'joy', 'few', 'otherwise', 'very', 'lonely', 'neglected', 'wallflowers.Other', 'family', 'members', 'include', 'beautiful', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Mariette', 'played', '22-year-old', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'pretty', 'boy-crazy', 'Primrose', 'son', 'Montgomery', 'twins', 'Zinnia', 'Petunia', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Victoria', 'who', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'odd', 'prank', 'older', 'siblings', 'Oscar', 'newest', 'addition', '.The', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', '1992', 'nine', '100-minute', 'episodes', 'split', 'two', '50-minute', 'parts', 'one', '50-minute', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'one', 'concluding', '50-minute', 'episode', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'tape', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'third', 'episode', 'entitled', 'A', 'Breath', 'French', 'Air', 'where', 'chronologically', 'point', 'interest', 'fans', 'David', 'Jason', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'real-life', 'elder', 'brother', 'Arthur', 'White', 'Pop', 'brother', 'episode', 'entitled', 'When', 'Green', 'Woods', 'Laugh', 'conclusion', 'lovely', 'warm-hearted', 'series', 'life', 'simpler', 'time', 'time', 'one', 'one', 'could', 'hold', 'onto', 'forever', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'perfect', 'unwinding', 'end', 'long', 'day', 'Pop', 'would', 'say', 'perfick', 'Extremely', 'highly', 'recommended', 'enjoy', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'novels', 'H.E', 'Bates', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', ""'re"", 'simply', 'wonderful']",N/A
