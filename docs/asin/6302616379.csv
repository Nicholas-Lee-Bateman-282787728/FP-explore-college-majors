323435,A3MFGOKZO3CH63,6302616379,Andrea Gidusko,"[7, 7]","It's a shame that Hillary Wolf gave up acting for Judo because she is such a spectacular actress, but Hollywood can be rough and I can't help but understand.This movie hit's close to home for those with or without a step family. You can relate to Laura Chartoff (Hillary) on some level in any part of the movie. Whether it's after her step sister Corrine (Jenny Lewis) states that she is &quot;So drab&quot; and she looks in the mirror and says &quot;My body just hangs there like a boy, not even a good-looking boy. I wouldn't go out with a boy that looked like me that's the sad thing.&quot; or the way her step father Keith (David Strathairn) blames her for everything that goes wrong. There is also her father (The great actor and director Griffin Dunne) who has been married more times then he can soberly remember, his last wife (Patricia Kalember from &quot;Sisters&quot;) left him with his three year old daughter Jessie (Jessica Seely) because he had an affair where the girl(Adrienne Shelley) became pregnant with twins or her mother (Margaret Whitton) who now treats Corrine like her real daughter in effect neglecting her REAL daughter in the process. Laura also has a half brother brainiac Sam (Ben Savage way before &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;)After being blamed for her stepbrothers breaking of her mothers China Laura runs away with her other stepbrother, whom she thinks of as her real brother and who has left the family he despises, Josh (Dan Futterman)to the mountains the day before the rest of the family is scheduled to go to Hawaii. This causes the entire family, stepmothers brothers and all to come together in the mountains to search for the run away who eventually runs away from Josh after he called her mother and stepfather on her.Laura finds herself on her own forcing the rest of her family to stay together in one small cabin while the police look for the missing girl, which in effect causes the estranged family members to grow closer and learn to love one another again. Being on her own Laura discovers who she is and that she really does need all whacky members of her family.This movie is good for families and more and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks their family is dysfunctional; which is practically every family on the planet.",5,Insist Upon Yourself,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,2282,"['shame', 'Hillary', 'Wolf', 'gave', 'up', 'acting', 'Judo', 'such', 'spectacular', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'rough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'understand.This', 'movie', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'step', 'family', 'can', 'relate', 'Laura', 'Chartoff', 'Hillary', 'level', 'part', 'movie', 'step', 'sister', 'Corrine', 'Jenny', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'So', 'drab', 'quot', 'mirror', 'quot', 'My', 'body', 'just', 'hangs', 'boy', 'not', 'even', 'good-looking', 'boy', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'boy', 'looked', 'sad', 'thing.', 'quot', 'way', 'step', 'father', 'Keith', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'everything', 'wrong', 'also', 'father', 'great', 'actor', 'director', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'can', 'soberly', 'remember', 'last', 'wife', 'Patricia', 'Kalember', 'quot', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'left', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'Jessica', 'Seely', 'had', 'affair', 'where', 'girl', 'Adrienne', 'Shelley', 'became', 'pregnant', 'twins', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'Whitton', 'who', 'now', 'Corrine', 'real', 'daughter', 'effect', 'neglecting', 'REAL', 'daughter', 'process', 'Laura', 'also', 'half', 'brother', 'brainiac', 'Sam', 'Ben', 'Savage', 'way', 'quot', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'quot', 'being', 'blamed', 'stepbrothers', 'breaking', 'mothers', 'China', 'Laura', 'away', 'other', 'stepbrother', 'whom', 'real', 'brother', 'who', 'left', 'family', 'Josh', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'mountains', 'day', 'rest', 'family', 'scheduled', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'entire', 'family', 'stepmothers', 'brothers', 'come', 'together', 'mountains', 'search', 'run', 'away', 'who', 'eventually', 'away', 'Josh', 'called', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'her.Laura', 'finds', 'own', 'forcing', 'rest', 'family', 'stay', 'together', 'one', 'small', 'cabin', 'police', 'look', 'missing', 'girl', 'effect', 'estranged', 'family', 'members', 'grow', 'closer', 'learn', 'love', 'one', 'again', 'Being', 'own', 'Laura', 'discovers', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'whacky', 'members', 'family.This', 'movie', 'good', 'families', 'more', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'practically', 'family', 'planet']",Big Girls Don't Cry They Get Even VHS
323436,A2582KMXLK2P06,6302616379,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is quite the surprise.Not only do I not remember this film back in the early 90's, but I can't believe how *well* it holds up these days.  Perhaps due to the fact it takes full advantage of the storyline.It's about a young teenage girl (the main character) who absolutely despises the fact her family is so screwed up in the head and refuses to ever change.  In the beginning she sorts through her entire large family and picks them apart one by one, haha.Some of these decorative personalities are her younger brother who's smart enough to be a scientist, her sassy and spoiled redheaded sister, her overweight brother who misbehaves only to end up humiliating himself, and then... THEN!!!  Then we have the neverending cycle of confusion that is her father, mother, stepmom, stepdad, etc.  WOW, haha and more.  Talk about an assortment of very creative and confusing characters!  At the end of the movie I was honestly STILL quite confused who exactly was related to who.Anyway, one day the teenage girl finally has enough of her family, so she attempts to run away from home.  She runs away with her oldest brother (unbeknownst to him- she hides in the back of his truck for at least half of the ride).  He owns a log cabin in the woods near a lake.I commend the writers for devoting a good chunk of the storyline to character development during the first 45 minutes of film instead of just tossing all these kids in the picture without doing anything remotely interesting with them like so many OTHER similar type of family comedies frequently do.  That gets on my nerves.Eventually the entire family finds out where she is, and goes there.  However as soon as the girl notices her family pulling up in the driveway, yup you guessed it- she takes off again!  The adventure continues.Well what's kind of peculiar about the entire thing is that her family never seems to get especially upset over the fact their daughter ran away from home and is missing.  We're talking about a huge woods with lots of danger here, folks.  They SHOULD show some concern.  Perhaps there's a potentially cruel and realistic message here that because their family is so big anyway, it's just one less mouth to feed.  I'd like to think it's just bad writing instead. :)I like the soundtrack too.  It captures that period in time when the music scene was changing from 80's hair metal to more alternative music.  It's odd and fascinating to hear both styles of music included in the same movie.Big Girls Don't Cry... They Get Even is a perfect family movie.  It's fairly long compared to similar types, but that's a good thing because as I mention above, a quality amount of time was devoted to building and telling a great story.",5,"big girls shouldn't cry, neither should guys",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,2716,"['quite', 'surprise.Not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'film', 'back', 'early', '90', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', '*well*', 'days', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'full', 'advantage', 'storyline.It', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'absolutely', 'fact', 'family', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'head', 'ever', 'change', 'beginning', 'entire', 'large', 'family', 'apart', 'one', 'one', 'haha.Some', 'decorative', 'personalities', 'are', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'scientist', 'sassy', 'spoiled', 'redheaded', 'sister', 'overweight', 'brother', 'who', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'humiliating', 'then', 'Then', 'have', 'neverending', 'cycle', 'confusion', 'father', 'mother', 'stepmom', 'stepdad', 'etc', 'WOW', 'haha', 'more', 'Talk', 'assortment', 'very', 'creative', 'confusing', 'characters', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'honestly', 'STILL', 'quite', 'confused', 'who', 'exactly', 'was', 'related', 'who.Anyway', 'one', 'day', 'teenage', 'girl', 'finally', 'enough', 'family', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'away', 'oldest', 'brother', 'unbeknownst', 'him-', 'back', 'truck', 'least', 'half', 'ride', 'log', 'cabin', 'woods', 'lake.I', 'commend', 'writers', 'devoting', 'good', 'chunk', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'instead', 'just', 'tossing', 'kids', 'picture', 'doing', 'anything', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'like', 'so', 'many', 'OTHER', 'similar', 'type', 'family', 'comedies', 'frequently', 'do', 'nerves.Eventually', 'entire', 'family', 'out', 'where', 'there', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'girl', 'family', 'pulling', 'up', 'driveway', 'yup', 'guessed', 'it-', 'off', 'again', 'adventure', 'continues.Well', 'what', 'kind', 'peculiar', 'entire', 'thing', 'family', 'never', 'get', 'especially', 'upset', 'fact', 'daughter', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'missing', ""'re"", 'talking', 'huge', 'woods', 'lots', 'danger', 'here', 'folks', 'SHOULD', 'show', 'concern', 'Perhaps', 'potentially', 'cruel', 'realistic', 'message', 'here', 'family', 'so', 'big', 'anyway', 'just', 'one', 'less', 'mouth', 'feed', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'just', 'bad', 'writing', 'instead', 'like', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'period', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'scene', 'was', 'changing', '80', 'hair', 'metal', 'more', 'alternative', 'music', 'odd', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'styles', 'music', 'included', 'same', 'movie.Big', 'Girls', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Get', 'Even', 'perfect', 'family', 'movie', 'fairly', 'long', 'compared', 'similar', 'types', 'good', 'thing', 'mention', 'quality', 'amount', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'building', 'telling', 'great', 'story']",Big Girls Don't Cry They Get Even VHS

323438,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302616379,Deborah Earle,"[4, 4]","In this engaging serio-comedy, an intelligent-looking Hillary Wolf plays 13-year-old Laura Chartoff, the frustrated daughter of two self-absorbed much-married parents (Griffin Dunne and Margaret Whitton) who currently resides with her mother, stepfather(David Straithairn), and half-siblings,the military school student, Kurt, child prodigy Sam, and the overindulged beauty queen, Corrine (Trenton Tigen, Ben Savage, and Jenny Lewis) in a Beverly Hills mansion.The story begins with Laura introducing her family situation via home video and narration of the events depicted in the video, and then deals with Laura's daily home situation, in which she laments the loss of her father's companionship. Currently, her artist father lives with his spacey girlfriend(Adrienne Shelley)who is pregnant with his twins, after being kicked out of the house for his affair by his schoolteacher wife, Barbara (Patrica Kalember) with whom he has a beautiful redhaired three-year-old(Jessica Seeley) who, like Laura, has also learned not to rely on him.While Laura's mother and stepfather are out one evening, she gets a welcome respite from her lonely situation by the return  of her estranged stepbrother Josh (Dan Futterman), with whom she'd had a good relationship. A series of incidents resulting from  Josh's return leads to the breakage of Mrs. Powers' good china, and Laura's being blamed for it.Hurt and sent over the edge, Laura decides to run off with Josh, who finds her in the back of his pick-up truck the next day.The action then moves to the beautiful Yosemite Valley where  Josh works at a camp resort. When the Powers family, who are  irritated by Laura's waylaying their trip to Hawaii by her behavior,arrive at the camp to bring her home, Laura feels that Josh has reneged on his promise not to call her stepfather, and runs away again. Summoned by young Sam, David Chartoff and Shelley, arrive as well, as do Barbara and little Jessie.The decision to stay and find Laura is made only because the boy-crazy and shallow Corrine sees a hunk emerging from the lake and is prompted to make a phony speech about not abandoning her in her hour of need.As the family gradually learn to put aside their differences for the sake of finding Laura, and seek the help of a seen-it-all before Sherriff and his ditzy assistant, Laura encounters a large conventional family, led by Josh Mostel. She spends time with them, but I found her glib attitude towards them to be a realistic one, taken by many children of divorced parents, and was glad to see a movie that dealt with that.The trip to Yosemite turns out to be more meaningful than any planned trip to Hawaii would have been because the adults learn to resolve their long-held grievances, and decisions about whether or not to end certain relationships are made. As they wait for Laura, who encounters a group of hoodlums and displays her own tough side as a result of that encounter, relationships between the parents and children strenghthen. Along the way the snotty Corrine is humbled as well.After an incident that finally brings her to tears, Laura returns to Josh's cabin to find something very special and priceless waiting for her, and she is finally given the answers about her family history that she had yearned for.In running away, she has brought her estranged family together, and she learns to value them as much as they do her.",5,A Meaningful Sojourn,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3391,"['engaging', 'serio-comedy', 'intelligent-looking', 'Hillary', 'Wolf', '13-year-old', 'Laura', 'Chartoff', 'frustrated', 'daughter', 'two', 'self-absorbed', 'much-married', 'parents', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'Margaret', 'Whitton', 'who', 'currently', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'half-siblings', 'military', 'school', 'student', 'Kurt', 'child', 'prodigy', 'Sam', 'overindulged', 'beauty', 'queen', 'Corrine', 'Trenton', 'Tigen', 'Ben', 'Savage', 'Jenny', 'Lewis', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'story', 'Laura', 'introducing', 'family', 'situation', 'home', 'video', 'narration', 'events', 'depicted', 'video', 'then', 'deals', 'Laura', 'daily', 'home', 'situation', 'loss', 'father', 'companionship', 'Currently', 'artist', 'father', 'lives', 'spacey', 'girlfriend', 'Adrienne', 'Shelley', 'who', 'pregnant', 'twins', 'being', 'kicked', 'house', 'affair', 'schoolteacher', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Patrica', 'Kalember', 'whom', 'beautiful', 'redhaired', 'three-year-old', 'Jessica', 'Seeley', 'who', 'Laura', 'also', 'learned', 'not', 'rely', 'him.While', 'Laura', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'are', 'one', 'evening', 'welcome', 'respite', 'lonely', 'situation', 'return', 'estranged', 'stepbrother', 'Josh', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'whom', ""'d"", 'had', 'good', 'relationship', 'series', 'incidents', 'resulting', 'Josh', 'return', 'breakage', 'Mrs', 'Powers', 'good', 'china', 'Laura', 'being', 'blamed', 'it.Hurt', 'sent', 'edge', 'Laura', 'run', 'off', 'Josh', 'who', 'back', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'next', 'day.The', 'action', 'then', 'beautiful', 'Yosemite', 'Valley', 'where', 'Josh', 'camp', 'resort', 'When', 'Powers', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'irritated', 'Laura', 'waylaying', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'behavior', 'arrive', 'camp', 'bring', 'home', 'Laura', 'Josh', 'reneged', 'promise', 'not', 'call', 'stepfather', 'away', 'again', 'Summoned', 'young', 'Sam', 'David', 'Chartoff', 'Shelley', 'arrive', 'well', 'do', 'Barbara', 'little', 'Jessie.The', 'decision', 'stay', 'find', 'Laura', 'made', 'only', 'boy-crazy', 'shallow', 'Corrine', 'hunk', 'emerging', 'lake', 'prompted', 'make', 'phony', 'speech', 'not', 'abandoning', 'hour', 'need.As', 'family', 'gradually', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'sake', 'finding', 'Laura', 'seek', 'help', 'seen-it-all', 'Sherriff', 'ditzy', 'assistant', 'Laura', 'large', 'conventional', 'family', 'led', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'time', 'found', 'glib', 'attitude', 'towards', 'be', 'realistic', 'one', 'taken', 'many', 'children', 'divorced', 'parents', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'movie', 'that.The', 'trip', 'Yosemite', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'meaningful', 'planned', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'adults', 'learn', 'resolve', 'long-held', 'grievances', 'decisions', 'not', 'end', 'certain', 'relationships', 'are', 'made', 'wait', 'Laura', 'who', 'group', 'hoodlums', 'own', 'tough', 'side', 'result', 'encounter', 'relationships', 'parents', 'children', 'strenghthen', 'way', 'snotty', 'Corrine', 'humbled', 'well.After', 'incident', 'finally', 'tears', 'Laura', 'Josh', 'cabin', 'find', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'priceless', 'waiting', 'finally', 'given', 'answers', 'family', 'history', 'had', 'yearned', 'for.In', 'running', 'away', 'brought', 'estranged', 'family', 'together', 'value', 'as', 'much', 'do']",Big Girls Don't Cry They Get Even VHS
