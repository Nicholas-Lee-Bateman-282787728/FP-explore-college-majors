While Streep's acting was great, the storyline was somewhat flat. It didn't illicit excitement, compassion nor admiration and to make the story more interesting they used that confusing camera movement that so many contemporary flimmakers use.

1451328,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0059XTUVI,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","The Iron Lady, 2011 filmA woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. ""They grow up so fast."" She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). ""Welcome to the madhouse."" She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miner's strike over lowered wages circa 1972.Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called ""The Iron Lady"". She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she ""change the face of history""? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makes it difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas (as far as I know). This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the ""Alliance for Progress""). It led to the oppression of the people. The attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was not mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?",1,"""This is quite tiresome.""",1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,3029,"['Iron', 'Lady', '2011', 'filmA', 'woman', 'pint', 'milk', 'grocery', '[', 'story', 'proceeds', 'slowly', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', ']', 'flashback', 'bombing', 'WW', 'II', 'Margaret', 'father', 'store', 'good', 'daughter', 'should', 'TV', 'tells', 'explosion', 'Brighton', 'hotel', 'Next', 'Miss', 'Roberts', 'chosen', 'Conservative', 'candidate', 'Parliament', 'viewpoints', '[', 'film', 'skipping', 'present', 'past', 'confusing', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'history', ']', 'Margaret', 'will', 'marry', 'Dennis', 'be', 'more', 'housewife', 'retirement', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'so', 'fast', 'seat', 'Parliament', '1959', 'divided', 'opposition', 'Welcome', 'madhouse', 'speech', 'strike', 'garbage', 'collection', 'other', 'services', 'was', 'coal', 'miner', 'strike', 'lowered', 'wages', 'circa', '1972.Margaret', 'decides', 'run', 'leader', 'party', 'principle', 'man', 'appearance', 'attract', 'voters', 'voice', 'lessons', 'project', 'image', 'friend', 'killed', 'bomb', '1979', 'became', 'first', 'woman', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Western', 'World', '[', 'film', 'jumps', 'ahead', 'again', ']', 'Baroness', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'called', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'cut', 'budget', 'privatized', 'services', '[', 'how', 'did', 'work', 'out', 'British', ']', 'Did', 'change', 'face', 'history', 'Did', 'policies', 'cause', 'drop', 'industrial', 'production', 'Were', 'people', 'becoming', 'impoverished', 'was', 'growing', 'unemployment', 'Bombs', 'are', 'set', 'off', 'Argentinians', 'invaded', 'Falkland', 'Islands', 'Maggie', 'said', 'sink', 'Belgrano', 'was', 'returning', 'home', 'Exocet', 'missile', 'hits', 'British', 'frigate', 'British', 'retake', 'Falkland', 'Islands', 'victory', 'popular', 'standing', 'new', 'taxes', 'everyone', 'accuses', 'who', 'disagree', 'cowardice', '[', 'grown', 'proud', 'arrogant', ']', 'are', 'disturbances', 'streets.The', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'difficult', 'follow', 'know', 'little', 'details', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'followed', 'historical', 'sequence', 'see', 'actors', 'who', 'represent', 'actual', 'politicians', 'are', 'unknown', 'who', 'know', 'details', 'British', 'politics', 'Thatcher', 'destroyed', 'national', 'coal', 'industry', 'make', 'country', 'dependent', 'imported', 'oil', 'gas', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'benefitted', 'special', 'interests', 'future', 'will', 'decide', 'was', 'correct', 'decision.There', 'was', 'military', 'coup', 'Argentina', 'mid-1960s', 'part', 'Alliance', 'Progress', 'led', 'oppression', 'people', 'attempt', 'reclaim', 'Falkland', 'Islands', 'invasion', 'failure', 'led', 'overthrow', 'more', 'democratic', 'government', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Greece', 'decade', 'earlier', 'there', 'lesson', 'here', 'wonder', 'powers', 'first', 'backed', 'Maggie', 'Thatcher', 'then', 'switched', 'new', 'leader', 'was', 'rejected', 'own', 'party', 'was', 'not', 'mention', 'movie', 'Was', 'Great', 'Britain', 'better', 'shape', 'reign', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'What', 'corporations', 'promoted']",N/A

In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards.

1451333,A96C98SCPMWLH,B0059XTUVI,Almost Sixty!,"[7, 17]","I did not expect to see anyone portray so thoroughly Margaret Thatcher as an elderly woman, right down to the walking gait and facial expressions that so clearly revealed her conflicting emotions as she looked back on her life and missed the loves of her life who got lost in the demands upon her as a political figure, still mixed with the fervor of a strong self forged in the fire. From the father who inspired her politically strong convictions and educational aspirations, to the warm-hearted husband who believed in her leadership and whose support gave her the courage to take ever bolder steps in leadership, this poignant story is profoundly acted by Meryl Streep. It touched me on so many levels--as an idealist, as a mother, as a woman whose career took her away from her family, as the daughter of a woman who is dealing with the onset of dementia and difficulty separating the past from the present. Margaret Thatcher's inner resoluteness matched the crises she had to face so bravely for so long, propelling her into history and onto the world stage, increasingly taking a toll on her till she mistakenly assumed those loyal to her party would always be loyal to her. The flashbacks are a realisitic experience of world history at the time, with actual news footage in the mix. This is not a biography.

It traces her roots- small grocer's family, her entry into politics and finally her act as the British PM. We simply get a glimpse of her rise but only superficially.

She regarded it as a compliment.""The Iron Lady"" provides a biography of Margaret Thatcher's adult life.  The highlight of this life, of course, was her more than a decade a Britain's first female prime minister.  The film covers this as a series of flash backs as seen the through the eyes of a very aged former prime minister.  The technique works.  Her life has certainly been quite extraordinary although there is little focus on her weaknesses.  In this sense, the film almost becomes hagiography.Notwithstanding the apparent lack of blemishes in the character of the former prime minister, Meryl Streep, in playing the older Margaret Thatcher, is spell binding.  Moreover, Streep is simply magnificent. Her performance is my early call for an Oscar. She really does become Margaret Thatcher.  There are no apparent flaws.  The accent, in particular, is right on the money.Streep is supported by Jim Broadbent as Dennis.  Unfortunately, his role tends to fall almost to caricature at times.  This is a shame as there are a number of other cameo roles and most of these are played excellently.  Michael Foot, Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine, et al are played in absolutely convincing style by a great supporting cast.  The various sets and the manner in which the era of the 1980s is re-created is also first class.In sum, apart from the danger of hagiography, this is a great film led by an actress at the top of her form.

1451339,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0059XTUVI,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The idea of a film portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is an interesting one.  I just really wish that this film were more interesting.  Instead of giving us anything of substantial depth, director Phyllida Lloyd serves up a series of scenes that serve no purpose other than to prove that Meryl Streep can do anything.  Sadly, her performance is hindered so drastically by the horrific pacing and emotional emptiness that I feel her Oscar win will be largely considered one of the most undeserved in recent years.I'm not going to sit here and bash the film.  It isn't...terrible.  Some critics were relentless and some of my friends said it was the worst film of 2011.  It wasn't.  At least this film isn't insulting.  I would watch this again before watching something like `The Descendants'.  That being said, this film is far from good.  It is actually pretty bad, especially for what it attempts to do.  Lloyd is a very inept director (as was proven by her botched job with `Mamma Mia') and trying to tackle something of considerable depth left her coming up VERY short.  She manages to take a woman who had so many stories to tell and reducing her to a montage a scenes with zero complexity.  The shoddy editing takes us in and out of Thatcher's life, at times in nonsensical order, as a way of weaving her past into her present, but this only serves as a way to take us out of the story and place us elsewhere.  If it weren't for Streep's obvious handle of the material I would have turned the film off a quarter of the way through.  It lags too often, and the unintentional camp that comes in with the constant regurgitation of events (the handling of Thatcher's hallucinations is clich&eacute;d and overused) made my eyes hurt from all the rolling they were doing.It feels weird to say that Lloyd should have called up Ron Howard for tips on how to build a coherent and engaging portrayal of mental illness, but she should have.The lack of emotional connect makes this a really shallow portrait of an important woman.  By film's end, we really don't learn anything about her.  Lloyd is so bent on portraying Thatcher's inability to let go of her late husband that she fails to build anything else, and she forgets to really color in WHY Thatcher can't let go.  The scenes with Streep and Broadbent don't paint Denis Thatcher as anything special or really allow them to build a relationship.  In fact, Thatcher is basically painted as a solitary entity the entire length of the film with no real emotional ties to anyone.  Her ambition drives her, but that is never truly explored, and I wouldn't have even took to that concept had Broadbent not shouted it at the camera in one particular scene.  Lloyd doesn't layer anything here.  She tries to pass off segues as complete thoughts (let's zoom in on a photograph and then show scene that has no tie to the last and then zoom out at an old woman staring blankly at a wall and call that depth) and it just doesn't work.Streep is a wonderful actress.

I don't count myself as a fan of Thatcher's politics, but I do admire her as a person.  She had an important role in the fall of the Soviet states and in transforming the American political role in the world.  Therefore, I hoped to enjoy a biographical movie that of course would include much of the usual literary license that is part of the Hollywood operation.What I got, though, left me empty.  The role of Thatcher was certainly well performed by Streep and there is nothing for me to add from what others have stated and will state.  I'm sure she will obtain another Oscar nomination.  If that is all that interests you in movie going, then enjoy!  But for those of you with more of an intellectual side, I would suggest waiting for the DVD to rent.The central problem I believe is that the makers wanted to portray the strong, independent woman, but I have to believe that they dislike her politics and they could not allow a movie viewer the opportunity to agree with the conservatism of Thatcher-especially in a presidential election year.  They missed no chance to attach a failure (implied or factual) for any Thatcher success and if that wasn't enough, they portrayed her as a lonely, dementia suffering, old woman for whom time has left behind and for whom the political world has completely forgotten.  Here is what troubled me the most; this is a movie about an important political ally for whom one would be ashamed to show the movie to that person.  Well, one Should be ashamed anyways.What also troubles me is that Streep has too much say so in her movies at this stage of her career.  She should have stepped in and said, ""Enough with these hallucinations, let's show more of this woman's actual career!""

Was it so that Meryl Streep could be up for another Oscar, or perhaps so that the Hollywood left could take a swipe -- OK, way more than one -- at somebody on the right?I have to admit, I'm not completely knowledgeable about the life of Margaret Thatcher, not even after watching this jumbled sorry mess of a film.  The narrative is told through a series of flashbacks, where those flashbacks involve the aged Ms. Thatcher reminiscing about her life, at least as well as she's able.  Evidently, she has Alzheimers -- I'm not sure of this and I won't even research it -- because that's at least how they portray her here.  But I have to ask the following:  if Ms. Thatcher was a liberal, wouldn't the filmmakers have been much more kind to her legacy?  Was it OK to treat her so poorly because she was a conservative?  And most importantly, what does her family think of this film?  (My guess:  they detest it.)But the bigger issue:  why didn't they just stick with a standard linear narrative here, perhaps modified by starting at the end of her life -- briefly -- then going back to the beginning when she was a child and working their way forward?  It would then surely have been easier to follow, as I became confused myself at points who was even real and who was imagined.  I feel that, in order to watch this film at all, one nearly needs to be a near-expert on the former prime minister's life.I am a big Meryl Streep fan, but she had no chance of saving this disaster.

1451375,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B0059XTUVI,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 8]","In recent years, the English movie industry has been producing little movies about important persons or significant moments in the history of the empire, and two of them were recently nominated for Academy Awards, due to memorable performances by the main actresses in their respective films: Michelle Williams for ""My Week with Marilyn"" and Meryl Streep for ""The Iron Lady.""  But, cinematically speaking, it was the majestic ""The Iron Lady"" which received better praise due to the complexity and significance of the story, as it magnificently captures the rise and fall of England's first female Prime Minister.Meryl Streep, who won the Best Actress Academy Award, plays Margaret Thatcher, and we first meet her in her later years, when she is showing the first signs of senility. She is aging and is constantly disturbed by the imaginary presence of her late husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). She spends the time - screen time, that is - remembering her younger years during World War II, when she used to work at her father's grocery store; how her father taught her how to be strong; and her years attending Oxford University. She is shown as a young woman with strong convictions, trying to accomplish something meaningful in life, saying at one time, ""I can not die washing up a tea cup!"" Margaret Roberts marries Denis Thatcher and soon they become parents. She goes into politics and becomes a Member of Parliament, eventually reaching the post of Prime Minister, being the first woman in holding that position. From then on, of course, we witness Thatcher dealing with a myriad of issues, including economic crises, clashes with the IRA, the Falklands war, and the end of the cold war. In every case, her motto was ""We will stand on principle, or we will not stand at all.""  This stance caused her some enemies inside and outside England.""The Iron-Lady"" is a well-documented and to-the-point film, and Meryl Streep shines in the main role, taking into consideration that she had to speak the Queen's English. I have to say, however, that there is something about Margaret Thatcher that I never liked. I am not sure what it is, but I believe that it may be the fact that, ""standing on principle,"" and perhaps to show character and determination, she chose to go to war for possession of an island far away from England, and with no apparent strategic significance, just to make a point. As I write this, there is another movement in Argentina claiming that the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) belong to them. At times, too, watching Streep with all the impressive make-up, as well as some of her facial movements, reminded me of Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest.""

Her domination of her cabinet ministers is so amusing a person is glad he's not one of them.The slow going is due to all the time spent reminiscing (this is the frame of the movie) in old age as she sinks into dementia. Sad but true that Margaret Thatcher's rise to power and her years as prime minister are fascinating. Margaret Thatcher as wife, mother and in old age isn't.For a pungent view of life with Thatcher, you won't do better than to read Alan Clarke's three-volume diary. He was one of her ministers.

Schneider,"[0, 2]","I watched Iron Lady more because because I enjoy watching Meryl Streep than because I had an overwhelming urge to watch a movie about Margaret Thatcher, but somehow anything that Ms. Streep does usually perks my interest.  Once again, she totally embodies the character and you really believe her in the role.  My issue was that I didn't feel it was a very fleshed-out portrayal of Thatcher.The movie is set up as flashbacks.  She is now an old woman, who has lost her husband and seems to suffer from some kind of dementia.  You see flashbacks of her as a young woman, a mother of twins and in her role as Englands first and only Prime Minister.  The movie just didn't really delve very deep and it was very sad to watch her as an old woman, just a shadow of the strong ""iron"" woman she once was.  What I felt was the best part of the movie was the overwhelming love that she and her husband shared and through her time as the prime minister she could come across tough as nails and then sit at a desk writing personal letters to families that had lost loved ones in the Falklands, showing her vulnerable and maternal side.I didn't love it or hate it.  She did a fantastic job but I would have liked to have learned more about her from a younger age through her time as Prime Minister. A fuller story line was really what Streep deserved for her stellar performance.So, for fans of Streep, you might want to check out her Oscar winning performance, but for those looking for a great movie about Thatcher, you can probably take a pass.",3,"Streep gives a great performance, but......",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,1535,"['watched', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'more', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'had', 'overwhelming', 'urge', 'watch', 'movie', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'somehow', 'anything', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'usually', 'perks', 'interest', 'Once', 'again', 'totally', 'character', 'really', 'believe', 'role', 'issue', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'fleshed-out', 'portrayal', 'Thatcher.The', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'flashbacks', 'now', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'suffer', 'kind', 'dementia', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'woman', 'mother', 'twins', 'role', 'Englands', 'first', 'only', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'delve', 'very', 'deep', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'watch', 'old', 'woman', 'just', 'shadow', 'strong', 'iron', 'woman', 'once', 'was', 'What', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'husband', 'shared', 'time', 'prime', 'minister', 'could', 'come', 'across', 'tough', 'nails', 'then', 'sit', 'desk', 'writing', 'personal', 'letters', 'families', 'had', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'Falklands', 'showing', 'vulnerable', 'maternal', 'side.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'hate', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'younger', 'age', 'time', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'A', 'fuller', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'Streep', 'deserved', 'stellar', 'performance.So', 'fans', 'Streep', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'looking', 'great', 'movie', 'Thatcher', 'can', 'probably', 'take', 'pass']",N/A

I remembered seeing her on the news quite a bit during the 80's but beyond that she seemed to vanish from the media in the years after her tenure as Prime Minister.  So, I went into this movie open-minded and without any bias towards her actual life versus this film.  I can say that Meryl Streep is amazing and brings to life many of the memories I do have of Thatcher and her mannerisms.  Streep plays the hard-nosed conservative tough but with the tender delicacies of a proper and ladylike woman as well.  But, do not overlook the performance of Alexandra Roach.  I found her role of the young Margaret at times to be equally sympathetic, even as much as Streep's.  Her surefooted tone of defiance in the face of status quo womanhood are among the best scenes in the film.The movie relies heavily upon not only Thatcher's background in politics, but also her unspoken thoughts of her family - which could be among the highest of conjecture - but still was quite moving.  Her relationship with her husband is among the keys to how this film decided to disect the motives of Thatcher.I found the historical references during her times as PM to be among the most grounded, yet those parts move by quite quickly and lead us back to her internal struggles.  Though the external nature of such a high political position is usually shown equal to the internal, here it seems more dilluted.  I would've preferred to see more of the head of state to state sit downs, international political maneuvering.In the end the film does strike a good balance of showing her as a triumphant giant among men, yet also the humanistic reflection of everyday people.  This film would be very interesting for those that enjoy biographical films, historical time pieces, and political dramas.

1451398,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0059XTUVI,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 1]","The Iron Lady is more a love story and a person spiraling into dementia than an historical documentary of Margaret Thatcher. This was a movie that I didn't think I would like, but it turned out to be something very special.The film was constructed around a series of flashbacks, the director, Phyllida Lloyd, did an incredible job telling this story. The film opens with an old lady buying a pint of milk at a convenience store. Eventually it becomes clear this is present day Margaret Thatcher. The wonderful twist in this film is how her late husband appears and disappears during present day. The film takes her point of view and his appearances are as real in her mind as they look on the screen. The dementia feels reel and it is easy to understand how this might happen to somebody.The second layer of the film is the wonderful love story between Margaret Roberts and Denis Thatcher. The young Margaret and Denis are played beautifully and it is convincing that they will become these two older characters. The third layer of the film is broad brushstrokes of Margaret Thatcher's rise and fall in England. I am no historian, but there is probably a lot of poetic license taken around that history. In the end, none of this really matters, the film is not meant to be historically precise.I am not a fan of Meryl Streep; I enjoyed her in It's Complicated and the mayor of crazytown in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. But really dislike her early work, especially her horrible moving in and out of accents in Sophie's Choice. In The Iron Lady, she has accomplished a remarkable presence. She is absolutely believable as Margaret Thatcher, playing an amazingly wide age range. She deserved this Oscar. Jim Broadbent as Denis Thatcher is remarkable. He brings humor and subtlety to a largely unknown person. He is the perfect counterpart to Streep. The remaining supporting cast is perfect.This movie is a beautifully filmed. At an hour and thirty five minutes, it is exactly the right length. The first three quarters of the film develop a pace and grace cutting between the present day and flashbacks. I was intrigued and could not get enough of this part of the movie. The last quarter kind of unravels a bit. This is a really tough part of a film built on flashback, when present time and the flashback get very close to each other. If there is one criticism of the film, the director lost her way during the closing quarter of the film. This is a small criticism; the film is still well worth watching. This is Phylida Lloyd's second feature length film, and second working with Meryl Streep. Thankfully the stinker Momma Mia did not invade this film.The DVD includes a making of featurette that is remarkable. There is just enough behind the scenes footage and intelligent interviews with the actors and director that it enhances the film. I highly recommend watching this short piece after the film. Sadly Anchor Bay ruined that featurette by trying to rehash it into four more two minute pieces. All four are copy and pastes from the original featurette with some minor embellishments. I really hate it when a production company does something like this - those extra four have no reason to exist. Thankfully there are no deleted scenes or humorous moments of people fluffing their lines.This was an enjoyable film to watch.

Much of the film makes little sense, with characters slipping into and out of Thatcher's consciousness, particularly her dead husband Denis.  The surreal elements work quite well, in my opinion.  What doesn't is everything else, including Meryl Streep's Academy Award-winning performance.Yes, I know this is sacrilege.  We must love everything that Streep does because she is Streep.  But to me she takes a two-note approach: she's either befuddled (old Maggie) or bitchy (middle-aged Maggie), there's no in between.  (Alexandra Roach, playing the young Thatcher, is one of the few actors here who finds any kind of nuance in what's they're doing.)  Streep provides a pitch perfect impersonation of Thatcher, and it's fun to watch.  But as for presenting a fully rounded human being with flaws and insecurities?  Not here, I'm afraid.  And maybe Thatcher had none...but I doubt it.Ultimately, though, Streep can only do what the filmmaker and writer ask of her, and she's sorely let down.  The best that can be said about Lloyd's direction is that she shows greater skills than she did on ""Mamma Mia.""  The film has no point of view and seems particularly unclear about how we, as an audience, are supposed to feel about Thatcher.  Watching anyone go through Alzheimer's is sad and difficult, of course, but it's not enough.  What made Thatcher tick, why was she who she was?  The film never even asks those questions, let alone tries to answer them.  It's an exercise in biography that's more about show than substance.",3,"Cold ""Iron""",1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2131,"['hard', 'put', 'words', 'how', 'feel', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'Phyllida', 'Lloyd', 'non-tradional', 'biopic', 'English', 'prime', 'minister', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'one', 'hand', 'think', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'one', 'assets', 'certainly', 'get', 'sense', 'Thatcher', 'career', 'rise', 'fall', 'defining', 'moments', 'will', ""'re"", 'presented', 'almost', 'flashbacks', 'pr', 'eacute', 'cis', 'form', 'dementia-addled', 'Thatcher', 'looking', 'back', 'life', 'jumble', 'almost', 'blur', 'how', 'memory', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Lloyd', 'screen', 'writer', 'Abi', 'Morgan', 'played', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Much', 'film', 'little', 'sense', 'characters', 'slipping', 'Thatcher', 'consciousness', 'particularly', 'dead', 'husband', 'Denis', 'surreal', 'elements', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'opinion', 'What', ""n't"", 'everything', 'else', 'including', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'performance.Yes', 'know', 'sacrilege', 'must', 'love', 'everything', 'Streep', 'Streep', 'two-note', 'approach', 'befuddled', 'old', 'Maggie', 'bitchy', 'middle-aged', 'Maggie', 'Alexandra', 'Roach', 'playing', 'young', 'Thatcher', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'here', 'who', 'kind', 'nuance', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Streep', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'impersonation', 'Thatcher', 'fun', 'watch', 'presenting', 'fully', 'rounded', 'human', 'being', 'flaws', 'insecurities', 'Not', 'here', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'maybe', 'Thatcher', 'had', 'none', 'doubt', 'it.Ultimately', 'Streep', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'writer', 'ask', 'her', 'sorely', 'let', 'down', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Lloyd', 'direction', 'greater', 'skills', 'did', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'particularly', 'unclear', 'how', 'audience', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'Thatcher', 'Watching', 'anyone', 'go', 'Alzheimer', 'sad', 'difficult', 'course', 'not', 'enough', 'What', 'made', 'Thatcher', 'tick', 'why', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'film', 'never', 'even', 'questions', 'let', 'alone', 'tries', 'answer', 'exercise', 'biography', 'more', 'show', 'substance']",N/A

I came away from the movie disliking her, her family and the people that she was elected to serve, while at the same time feeling compassion for the hopes and disappointments that they all experienced.  This is also a movie that has stayed with me, if for no other reason than to try to understand why anyone thought that it would humanize someone by focusing so heavily on their mental decline. Maybe if I had personally experienced the woman and her policies, it would make more sense.

1451412,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0059XTUVI,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 3]","In Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 film, ""The Iron Lady,"" the ever-accomplished Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep adds another accent to her repertoire of outstanding characters with distinctive speech patterns that mark their identity.  However, it is not the duplication of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's voice cadence that wins her her third Oscar, it is her ability to play a woman in angst with multi-faceted nuance.  As Thatcher, Streep ripples and reels with the passing of time--for most of the film we see her as an aged oldster missing her now deceased husband with not much to check off on the daily to-do list other than seeing doctors, packing off her hubby's clothing and battling hallucinations.  Why Phyllida Lloyd decides to use Thatcher as a case-in-point for the ephemeral nature of success and the poster child for a modern-day Ozymandias lesson in the inevitable decline of any human, great or small, along with whatever empires they build, seems understandable on the surface, but results in a dreary portrait of ""The Iron Lady"" and her myriad of accomplishments within the United Kingdom.Of course, Streep portrays Thatcher in her dotage with a befuddled excellence that entitles her to be thought of as one of today's most brilliant actresses.  As the older Thatcher, she becomes visually disturbing as her mind meanders, chasing after dreams of yesterday as epitomized by the appearance of her deceased husband (played with panache by Jim Broadbent) who reminds and coaxes her to maintain control of whatever is left of her life.  Seeing Thatcher depicted in this way is almost embarrassing and decidedly irreverent.  Should not the woman who was prime minister of the UK longer than anyone else in its history be allowed the perseverance of her private dignity?If writer Abi Morgan's motivation for depicting Thatcher from this vantage point is to garner support for dementia-awareness with unsolicited cooperation from the former prime minister in order to show that it can happen to anyone despite one's former glory, this reviewer supposes that both Morgan and director Lloyd accomplish in projecting this theme.  However, the life of any woman would have done just as well to make this point.  Sadly, anyone expecting to understand the climate and politics of her time at the helm of the British nation will see montages of events like the IRA bombings, her battle with the unions and her mission to reclaim the Falkland Islands but will be ultimately disappointed when attempting to discern her contribution with regard to advancements for women and the British world.Instead of a strong woman who leads an important world nation for over 15 years, the audience sees a woman struggling for her sanity because her physical body is failing.  But what of Thatcher's quick mind?  What of her accomplishments?  Should she not be applauded for her tenacity and ability to stand up to others?  The filmmakers give us a glimpse of this, but focus on Thatcher's deterioration instead of her crested glory.  The resultant film wears thin in the mind of the viewer--the lows are underscored too brutally while the highs are barely explained.Even though Alexandra Roach bristles as the young Margaret Thatcher--she is all about quenching her thirst for change and getting done what she thinks must get done--this reviewer does not get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher really is.  Instead, the image of Streep as the old woman in a world that has passed her by remains steadfast--a cautionary tale almost Buddhist in its leanings towards the insignificance of the world of politics and materialism.  Why bother to strive when what awaits you is forgetfulness, a body that betrays and death?Bottom line?  Phyllida Lloyd's depiction of Margaret Thatcher does not contain enough data about this longest serving British prime minister to consider it a biopic.  Instead, the film, sadly, depicts the trials and tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.  This ""make hay when the sun shines"" mentality depresses rather than instills ambition or rallies motivation towards world progress in any positive manner.  Streep excels as the aging Maggie, missing her husband, her son and underling the importance of having some purpose to even the longest days.  Recommended only for those who want to see Streep's award-winning performance and realize this is not an upbeat biographic film bullet-pointing Thatcher's actions during her ministry.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Ozymandias Treatment for Maggie,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,4538,"['Phyllida', 'Lloyd', '2011', 'film', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'ever-accomplished', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'accent', 'repertoire', 'outstanding', 'characters', 'distinctive', 'speech', 'patterns', 'mark', 'identity', 'However', 'not', 'duplication', 'former', 'British', 'prime', 'minister', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'voice', 'cadence', 'third', 'Oscar', 'ability', 'play', 'woman', 'angst', 'multi-faceted', 'nuance', 'Thatcher', 'Streep', 'ripples', 'reels', 'passing', 'time', 'most', 'film', 'see', 'aged', 'oldster', 'missing', 'now', 'deceased', 'husband', 'not', 'much', 'check', 'off', 'daily', 'to-do', 'list', 'other', 'seeing', 'doctors', 'packing', 'off', 'hubby', 'clothing', 'battling', 'hallucinations', 'Why', 'Phyllida', 'Lloyd', 'use', 'Thatcher', 'case-in-point', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'success', 'poster', 'child', 'modern-day', 'Ozymandias', 'lesson', 'inevitable', 'decline', 'human', 'great', 'small', 'empires', 'build', 'understandable', 'surface', 'results', 'dreary', 'portrait', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'myriad', 'accomplishments', 'United', 'Kingdom.Of', 'course', 'Streep', 'Thatcher', 'dotage', 'befuddled', 'excellence', 'be', 'thought', 'one', 'today', 'most', 'brilliant', 'actresses', 'older', 'Thatcher', 'visually', 'disturbing', 'mind', 'meanders', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'yesterday', 'epitomized', 'appearance', 'deceased', 'husband', 'played', 'panache', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'coaxes', 'maintain', 'control', 'left', 'life', 'Seeing', 'Thatcher', 'depicted', 'way', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'decidedly', 'irreverent', 'Should', 'not', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'prime', 'minister', 'UK', 'longer', 'anyone', 'else', 'history', 'be', 'allowed', 'perseverance', 'private', 'dignity', 'writer', 'Abi', 'Morgan', 'motivation', 'depicting', 'Thatcher', 'vantage', 'point', 'garner', 'support', 'dementia-awareness', 'unsolicited', 'cooperation', 'former', 'prime', 'minister', 'order', 'show', 'can', 'happen', 'anyone', 'one', 'former', 'glory', 'reviewer', 'Morgan', 'director', 'Lloyd', 'accomplish', 'projecting', 'theme', 'However', 'life', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'point', 'Sadly', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'understand', 'climate', 'politics', 'time', 'helm', 'British', 'nation', 'will', 'see', 'montages', 'events', 'IRA', 'bombings', 'battle', 'unions', 'mission', 'reclaim', 'Falkland', 'Islands', 'will', 'be', 'ultimately', 'disappointed', 'when', 'attempting', 'discern', 'contribution', 'regard', 'advancements', 'women', 'British', 'world.Instead', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'important', 'world', 'nation', '15', 'years', 'audience', 'woman', 'struggling', 'sanity', 'physical', 'body', 'failing', 'what', 'Thatcher', 'quick', 'mind', 'What', 'accomplishments', 'Should', 'not', 'be', 'applauded', 'tenacity', 'ability', 'stand', 'up', 'others', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'glimpse', 'focus', 'Thatcher', 'deterioration', 'instead', 'crested', 'glory', 'resultant', 'film', 'wears', 'thin', 'mind', 'viewer', 'lows', 'are', 'underscored', 'too', 'brutally', 'highs', 'are', 'barely', 'explained.Even', 'Alexandra', 'Roach', 'young', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'quenching', 'thirst', 'change', 'getting', 'done', 'what', 'must', 'get', 'done', 'reviewer', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'really', 'Instead', 'image', 'Streep', 'old', 'woman', 'world', 'passed', 'remains', 'steadfast', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'almost', 'Buddhist', 'leanings', 'insignificance', 'world', 'politics', 'materialism', 'Why', 'bother', 'strive', 'when', 'what', 'forgetfulness', 'body', 'death', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Phyllida', 'Lloyd', 'depiction', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'not', 'contain', 'enough', 'data', 'longest', 'serving', 'British', 'prime', 'minister', 'consider', 'biopic', 'Instead', 'film', 'sadly', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'aged', 'dementia', 'other', 'dehabilitating', 'diseases', 'set', 'make', 'hay', 'when', 'sun', 'shines', 'mentality', 'rather', 'instills', 'ambition', 'rallies', 'motivation', 'world', 'progress', 'positive', 'manner', 'Streep', 'excels', 'aging', 'Maggie', 'missing', 'husband', 'son', 'underling', 'importance', 'having', 'purpose', 'even', 'longest', 'days', 'Recommended', 'only', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'Streep', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'realize', 'not', 'upbeat', 'biographic', 'film', 'bullet-pointing', 'Thatcher', 'actions', 'ministry.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",N/A

The most interesting aspect of Phyllida Lloyd's film is the way it portrays Mrs. Thatcher as driven by hubris - despite her humble origins, she remained convinced of the rightness of her cause, even when she was manifestly wrong.  This was especially the case in 1990, when she was forced to resign as leader of the Conservative Party over her support for the Poll Tax.  The film shows how she rode roughshod over any objections raised by her Cabinet, even when they were probably right to object.  With this knowledge in mind, we do not feel much sympathy for her when she is shown as a lonely elderly lady, without the support of her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent), and trying and failing to fend for herself.  The supporting performances in this film are colorless, sometimes veering towards the grotesque (Richard E. Grant's Michael Heseltine is particularly guilty in this respect).

1451426,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B0059XTUVI,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[88, 118]","Some reviewers have panned ""The Iron Lady,"" directed by Phyllida Lloyd from a screenplay by Abi Morgan.  They resent the filmmakers' portrayal of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of the most controversial political figures of the twentieth century, as an elderly woman in decline.  Lloyd shows Thatcher having hallucinations, during which she converses with her departed husband, Denis.  She is forgetful, distracted, and lives more in the past than in the present.  Other critics have suggested that ""The Iron Lady"" gives short shrift to Thatcher's political career, placing too much emphasis on her personality and her relationship with family and colleagues.It is unfair to condemn the movie that Lloyd and Morgan should have made.  ""The Iron Lady"" is not meant to be a conventional biopic that focuses solely on how Thatcher's conservative policies affected Great Britain between 1979 and 1990.  Lloyd and Morgan have a different purpose in mind--to examine what drove Margaret Roberts to embark on a political career; the difficulties she faced juggling marriage, parenthood, and her busy work schedule; and the price that she (and some might say her country) paid for her stubborn adherence to what she considered to be non-negotiable principles. We observe Thatcher's life through the prism of her memories, as she recalls events from her girlhood, courtship with Denis, and turbulent years in office.Meryl Streep is exceptional as Margaret Thatcher.  Her facial expressions, carriage, and voice perfectly convey Thatcher's ambition, single-mindedness, and determination.  Streep also reveals her subject's flaws:  Thatcher could be petty, unfeeling, and domineering.  The most poignant and memorable scenes depict Mrs. Thatcher more than two decades after she retired as frightened, confused, lonely, and preoccupied with bygone events.  Jim Broadbent is superb as Denis, who applauded his wife's triumphs but resented her bossiness and obstinacy. There are wonderfully humorous moments and some scenes that may reduce the audience to tears.  The movie is not perfect.  At times the script and the score are heavy-handed and manipulative. However, most viewers will understand if not empathize with the grocer's daughter who attended Oxford and went on to govern Great Britain for over a decade.

1451427,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0059XTUVI,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","That Meryl Streep would be brilliant in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is a given and should be enough to justify a film's existence, but this sympathetic 2011 historical biopic does not give the actress enough to work with in what amounts to a charitable and cursory view of a controversial figure. Director Phyllida Lloyd had directed Streep in one of her lighter recent efforts, 2008'sMamma Mia!, where caricature and fleet footing worked together to keep the bouncy ABBA-penned score from touching ground. This time, however, a more definitive grounding would have been beneficial to provide Thatcher's story with much-needed perspective. Unfortunately, screenwriter Abi Morgan's (Shame) episodic patchwork of a script takes no sides in presenting the life and career of one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century. Instead, amid moments of genuine poignancy, her story is tethered to the ravages of old age and the onset of dementia, presenting the still-living Thatcher as an almost Dickensian character dependent on the ghost of her eccentric late husband Denis for personal support.In fact, the film opens circa 2008 with Thatcher in a semi-senile state venturing out to buy milk at a local convenience store. Even though she is immersed in imaginary conversations with Denis, she is preparing to dispose of his clothes eight years after his death at the behest of her daughter Carol. After this lengthy introductory sequence, the story starts to traverse back and forth between extended flashbacks and her present-day solitude. We see her as the devoted daughter of a Grantham grocer, worshipful of her father but distant from her mother as Thatcher takes an interest in national politics starting at the lowest rungs of the Conservative party. From these early-day scenes, it's difficult to tell how or why she climbed to the top of the party because there is barely a glimmer of the ruthless ambition and savvy positioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead. Instead, we get the Cliff's Notes version that cuts to the high points of her career, so significant turning points come across as little more than a dramatic checklist.Running a blessedly brief 105 minutes, the film tackles in quick succession her Conservative stand at Parliament, her pointed challenge to Edward Heath for leadership of the party, her unfettered decision to send troops to defend the Falkland Islands, and her forced resignation in the face of hubris and waning popularity. Interspersed throughout is archival footage of the real Thatcher (with her face hidden, of course) during her twelve years as Prime Minister, the longest of any in the last century. Had Lloyd and Morgan reined in the breadth of Thatcher's life and zeroed in on a defining moment like the Falkland Islands war, the film would have been more dramatically effective in revealing the true figure. There is, however, no faulting Streep (with seamless assistance from her long-time make-up assistant J. Roy Helland) whose uncanny resemblance and authoritative performance commands attention most willingly.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE IRON LADY (2012, 100 minutes) Meryl Streep has been one admirably busy ""iron lady"" herself - giving us a deliciously wicked portrayal of Julia Child (Julie & Julia) and as the rosary-crushing hate-filled nun (Doubt, see my review). Now comes Meryl in her most successful portrayal yet, as Margaret Thatcher, the much-hated former Prime Minister of Great Britain.Set sometime long after her forced retirement (I really could not tell what year), Thatcher battles the onslaught of dementia while watching her memories play out before her eyes. Bothered sometimes to the point of evil irritation by the ""ghost"" of her husband Dennis (Jim Broadbent in yet another eerily goofy, sidelined part), Thatcher simply copes with the visual smear that is her memory.There is no denying the artistry here, the acting is stellar, the cinematography spot-on, and even more shocking is the beginning when we see a little old lady at the local grocery. Turns out to be a nearly unrecognizable Thatcher, with people rudely pushing her out of the way, unknowing. How the mighty fall.A huge problem with this film is cohesion: watching it closely, I noted that you must be British and politically savvy to get a fraction of this thing. Though many of us recall certain things such as the Falklands and the bombings, most of this stuff is unheard-of in America. As for Thatcher's flashbacks, they bored me to tears and then some. I can understand the cinematic convention - but that is all it is, and it's trite.Lots is missing here. Though I knew very well what an insufferable, presumptuous woman Thatcher was, treating her cabinet like slaves, the film neatly sidesteps almost everything of importance from her time. There was one weird shot lasting a half second, with a lady I presume was supposed to be the queen at Thatcher's side. A film about Thatcher neglecting the issue of the queen is simply not a film about Thatcher.It is a mighty showboat performance for Streep - but beyond a certain point that ceases to mean anything for me.When commenting about her beautiful performance inThe Queen(see my review), Dame Helen Mirren remarked that whenever an actor portrays a real person, the actor will ""get"" only about 75% of that person. That was a stunningly marvelous and accurate remark by Mirren, but here I think Streep ""got"" roughly 85% of Thatcher.It's a shame it got wasted on an arthouse production like this.",3,Do you have the stomach for it?,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2408,"['IRON', 'LADY', '2012', '100', 'minutes', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'been', 'one', 'admirably', 'busy', 'iron', 'lady', 'giving', 'deliciously', 'wicked', 'portrayal', 'Julia', 'Child', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'rosary-crushing', 'hate-filled', 'nun', 'Doubt', 'see', 'review', 'Now', 'Meryl', 'most', 'successful', 'portrayal', 'yet', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'much-hated', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Great', 'Britain.Set', 'sometime', 'long', 'forced', 'retirement', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'year', 'Thatcher', 'onslaught', 'dementia', 'watching', 'memories', 'play', 'out', 'eyes', 'Bothered', 'sometimes', 'point', 'evil', 'irritation', 'ghost', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'yet', 'eerily', 'goofy', 'sidelined', 'part', 'Thatcher', 'simply', 'visual', 'smear', 'memory.There', 'denying', 'artistry', 'here', 'acting', 'stellar', 'cinematography', 'spot-on', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'beginning', 'when', 'see', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'local', 'grocery', 'out', 'be', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Thatcher', 'people', 'rudely', 'pushing', 'way', 'unknowing', 'How', 'mighty', 'fall.A', 'huge', 'problem', 'film', 'cohesion', 'watching', 'closely', 'noted', 'must', 'be', 'British', 'politically', 'savvy', 'get', 'fraction', 'thing', 'many', 'recall', 'certain', 'things', 'such', 'Falklands', 'bombings', 'most', 'stuff', 'unheard-of', 'America', 'Thatcher', 'flashbacks', 'bored', 'tears', 'then', 'can', 'understand', 'cinematic', 'convention', 'trite.Lots', 'missing', 'here', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'insufferable', 'presumptuous', 'woman', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'treating', 'cabinet', 'slaves', 'film', 'neatly', 'almost', 'everything', 'importance', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'weird', 'shot', 'lasting', 'half', 'second', 'lady', 'presume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'queen', 'Thatcher', 'side', 'film', 'Thatcher', 'neglecting', 'issue', 'queen', 'simply', 'not', 'film', 'Thatcher.It', 'mighty', 'showboat', 'performance', 'Streep', 'certain', 'point', 'mean', 'anything', 'me.When', 'commenting', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'inThe', 'Queen', 'see', 'review', 'Dame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'remarked', 'whenever', 'actor', 'real', 'person', 'actor', 'will', 'get', 'only', '75', '%', 'person', 'was', 'stunningly', 'marvelous', 'accurate', 'remark', 'Mirren', 'here', 'think', 'Streep', 'got', 'roughly', '85', '%', 'Thatcher.It', 'shame', 'got', 'wasted', 'arthouse', 'production']",N/A

The movie portrays her as an addled old lady who hallucinates that she's talking to her dead husband and remembering her time as Prime Minister by flashbacks. (Now it is a real-life fact that her daughter Carol says that Maggie is going through dementia and has to be constantly reminded that her husband died almost 10 years ago) but they could've focused more on her time as Prime Minister in the prime of her life and her brilliant speeches, etc and what she was and not how she's declined in recent years.

1451453,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0059XTUVI,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","That THE IRON LADY ultimately fails as a great movie is puzzling.  Despite the great performance by Meryl Streep portraying the larger than life Margaret Thatcher, one of the most important political players of the 20th century, the story remains spotty and unsatisfying despite evidence that it is trying so very hard. Abi Morgan is responsible for the screenplay that does indeed offer individual scenes with touch moments but lets the overall sweep of the film in tatters.  Phyllida Law directs.For reference, `Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS, n&eacute;e Roberts (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician and the longest-serving (1979-1990) British prime minister of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A Soviet journalist nicknamed her the ""Iron Lady"", which later became associated with her uncompromising policies. As prime minister, she implemented conservative policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.'  Where the film take us is to view Thatcher (Meryl Streep) as elderly and a virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). She looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's (Jim Broadbent) clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premeireship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.Streep's ability to convey the mental deterioration of this lady is a triumph of moderation: she never imitates Alzheimer's disease but instead allows us to view senility in a new way. The cast is large and there are some good performances by some of England's finest actors.  But somehow the events during Thatcher's rise to the role as England's first woman Prime Minister and all the events (Falkland war, fall of the Berlin wall, etc) just seem like addenda.  Even the usual fine music composer Thomas Newman fails in his task to create a memorable score (except for the inclusion of Maria Callas singing `Casta diva' from Bellini's `Norma' and excerpts of Bach from the Well Tempered Clavier). It is a showcase for Meryl Streep and she handles her end of the project well indeed.  Grady Harp, April 12",4,'It used to be about trying to do something.

Though at times she reminded me of the character she played in The Devil Wears Prada, this performance was astonishing, as so many have already said.Streep is surrounded by superb actors in a storyline that avoids clich&eacute; by using ""dead"" characters for the Thatcher character to chat with, eliminating countless flashbacks and exposition.

Heavily-laden phrases like ""You must be crazy to suggest spending cuts during a recession"" seem such an obvious political statement on today's politics. When the film portrays Thatcher as an agressive, mean-spirited woman who willingly abandons her family for her career (the scene when her kids run after her down the street as she leaves for parliment is quite ridiculous),it becomes obvious that the filmmakers want to cast a negative light on her achievements. I was really surprised to see that the film implies that Thatcher ""heard voices"" well before she resigned as the prime minister, implying that all of her political decisions were influenced by the voices in her head. Possible message: anyone who doesn't think like a liberal must be hearing crazy voices in their heads. It's ironic that liberal filmmakers who pretend to be rabid feminists so willingly undermine achievements made by women who don't represent their own agendas. You can't help but notice this selective feminism while watching the film, despite the great acting. The film comes across as an unbalanced and mean-spirited portrayal of Thatcher, which cannot be the whole truth of her story.",3,"Great performances, one-sided story telling",1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1524,"['***possible', 'spoilers***It', 'hard', 'argue', 'when', 'someone', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'world', 'greatest', 'living', 'actress', 'why', 'portrayal', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'However', 'honest', 'look', 'film', 'severe', 'political', 'bent', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'fine', 'acting', 'place', 'Heavily-laden', 'phrases', 'must', 'be', 'crazy', 'suggest', 'spending', 'cuts', 'recession', 'seem', 'obvious', 'political', 'statement', 'today', 'politics', 'When', 'film', 'Thatcher', 'agressive', 'mean-spirited', 'woman', 'who', 'willingly', 'family', 'career', 'scene', 'when', 'kids', 'run', 'street', 'parliment', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'obvious', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'cast', 'negative', 'light', 'achievements', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'implies', 'Thatcher', 'heard', 'voices', 'well', 'resigned', 'prime', 'minister', 'implying', 'political', 'decisions', 'were', 'influenced', 'voices', 'head', 'Possible', 'message', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'think', 'liberal', 'must', 'be', 'hearing', 'crazy', 'voices', 'heads', 'ironic', 'liberal', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'pretend', 'be', 'rabid', 'feminists', 'so', 'willingly', 'undermine', 'achievements', 'made', 'women', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'own', 'agendas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'selective', 'feminism', 'watching', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'film', 'across', 'unbalanced', 'mean-spirited', 'portrayal', 'Thatcher', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'whole', 'truth', 'story']",N/A

The cast was great, the provenance hallowed...... but - the movie was alternately confusing, dull and baffling. The idea of presenting the life of Margaret Thatcher through the use of flashbacks from an old, and dementia afflicted Mrs. Thatcher must have been an exciting concept. However, the reality was confusing, boring and difficult to follow.There is a far better version of the life of Margaret Thatcher, another unique approach to the life of Margaret Thatcher, but one that works: ""The Rise and Fall of Margaret Thatcher"". This is a sterling BBC production, using 3 actresses ( Andrea Riseborough, Patricia Hodge, Lindsay Duncan) to portray a very accurate representation of Mrs.Thatcher's life. I would highly recommend this 2 disc set to anyone wishing to learn more about Mrs. Thatcher and her times.Meryl Streep tried her best, all of the actors gave it their best, but -""The Iron Lady"" just did not pull it off. The flashback sequences representing the life of an aged Mrs. Thatcher and a young Mrs. Thatcher, at the height of her power, just did not work. Denis Thatcher was presented as more of a clown and buffoon in his many appearances in the hallucinations of the old Mrs. Thatcher. I felt cheated by the lack of an accurate historical representation of the ""Thatcher Era"". The movie seemed to demean Mrs. Thatcher, love her or hate her... she was a very interesting politician. She served during some very historic times in Britain, none of that is accurately presented in this film. I am not and was not a fan of Mrs. Thatcher, but she was a very interesting person. This film does not reflect the complexities of the life of Mrs. Thatcher.

Surely there is an interesting story yet to be told (by a better set of screenwriters) about a commoner who ascended the British class ladder to take on Parliament's exclusive ""old boys club,"" and in the process attained the vaunted position of British Prime Minister. But the moviegoer will find no such story in this mishmash of a movie. For, despite Meryl Streep's above average performance, what the moviegoer will see is bits and pieces of a self-important personality strung together by a script moving back and forth across time willy-nilly seemingly without much rhyme or reason. I have no doubt that anyone shuffling the events of Margaret Thatcher's life randomly could have come up with a better more coherent screenplay than the one seen here.What we get here instead of a robust coherent biographical story is a loose cinematic collage of a thinly drawn cardboard cutout of a personality devoid of a personal life, one that should have been interesting but in the end was anything but. Like Mr. Obama in the U.S. Mrs. Thatcher may have been a trail-blazing British first, but that alone does not guarantee that her life and times will make for an interesting historical or cinematic story.What we have here at most is an interesting outline full of randomly placed historical events, loosely attached to a professional life that is devoid of any meaningful non-public human content.My wife and I debated why this might have been the case? Maybe the screenwriters adhered too closely to a bland autobiography? Or, maybe their deadlines for completing the script were just too tight and what fell out was this monstrosity of a movie?

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 13]","Besides portraying dozens of fictional women-- and one rabbi-- Meryl Streep became Ethel Rosenberg, Julia Child and now Margaret Thatcher. Surely if there is any justice left in Hollywood,  she, just having won the Golden  Globe,  will get an Oscar for her splendid performance as Britain's first and only female prime minister. This movie is not to be missed. While the supporting cast  is superb, particularly Jim  Broadbent as Denis Thatcher in old age, this film  belongs to Streep and Streep alone.  She is in most of the scenes; when she is on screen, it is all about her. There is obviously  no role she cannot play.The film opens with Mrs. Thatcher debilitated with dementia and flashes back to her days as a young woman-- played by another actress-- and then as prime minister of course. In practically one-half of the movie, we see her in the present when she cannot remember that her husband Denis is dead. There is a particularly poignant scene where she is signing books and mistakenly writes ""Margaret Roberts, "" her maiden name instead of  ""Thatcher."" For those of us who have had family members with dementia, we recognize immediately that Ms. Streep, sad to say, is perfect as this character-- her gait, her vacant stare, her confusion.  And she has all the fire and steel that we associate with Thatcher in her days as prime minister.While I suspect that Ms. Streep does not share the prime minister's political views, it is easy to see why she chose this role since Mrs. Thatcher, whether you like her or not, had an uphill battle as a woman surrounded by men in government.The riot and protest scenes are riveting as the prime minister often is driven through them.

What it took from her to enter the men's world, how much better she had to be than her fellow male party members, how strong her beliefs were and that all these qualities became her nemesis in the end.And the man who believed the most in her and always supportive - her husband - brilliantly performed by Jim Broadbent.

If ever an Academy Award was given to the right person, this was the time - Streep absolutely clones her mannerisms, speech inflections and style in a way I've never seen anyone else come close. But besides the outstanding performance, the script is somewhat lackluster, deciding to take the career of one of the most iconic people of the century and focus on the least interesting parts.It's not that the script itself is terrible - it's better than many films I've seen in the last 12 months. It's more that it feels like a missed opportunity since there are dozens of events that could have been drawn upon to make a more interesting film. In making a movie that's essentially about isolation and loneliness, it fails to capture the sheer passion and depth of feeling - both positive and negative - that the average Briton had for Mrs Thatcher.Overall, I'd still recommend the film to people who are interested in the former Prime Minister but be prepared for watching something that's very small scale given the grandness of the times when she was in power.",3,A pedestrian script that's incredibly well acted,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1227,"['combination', 'excellent', 'makeup', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'uncannily', 'close', 'impersonation', 'almost', 'going', 'back', '25', 'years', 'seeing', 'lady', 'perform', 'ever', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'given', 'right', 'person', 'was', 'time', 'Streep', 'absolutely', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'inflections', 'style', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'else', 'come', 'close', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'script', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'deciding', 'take', 'career', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'people', 'century', 'focus', 'least', 'interesting', 'parts.It', 'not', 'script', 'terrible', 'better', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', '12', 'months', 'more', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'are', 'dozens', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'essentially', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'capture', 'sheer', 'passion', 'depth', 'feeling', 'positive', 'negative', 'average', 'Briton', 'had', 'Mrs', 'Thatcher.Overall', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'be', 'prepared', 'watching', 'something', 'very', 'small', 'scale', 'given', 'grandness', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'power']",N/A

Jim Broadbent, as her husband Dennis, is a performance to match and enhance Streep's own.  The blending of the roles of Alexandra Roach and Harry Loyd as the young Margaret and Dennis with the later manifestations is seamless.The story itself recalls memories, even to Americans, of the Falklands War and introduces us to some of the controversies Thatcher's policies engendered in Britain.  I am sure that British memories would be stimulated much more than Americans.I found the focus on Thatcher's presumed dementia to be a distraction from the film.  It is the milieu in which the life-long love story between Maggie and Dennis is presented, but I still find that detracts from the power of the film.  The real story of Margaret Thatcher is the story of her active life, her life of struggle for the British people and the Free World, not the story of an elderly woman in decline.  If a movie of Ronald Reagan purported to present his life but focused on his final years I would find it offensive.  I feel the same about Lady Thatcher.

At home, she speaks with her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) during breakfast, however, her husband passed away in 2003. She misses her husband so much, it gives her comfort to believe he is still there in her home. It's a way of trying to keep memories. The staff sees her talking to herself.That night, she dresses up beautiful and entertains guests for dinner keeping up her character and staying in good spirits.Her daughter reminds her at bedtime that she is no longer the Prime Minister, Mark is in South Africa and her husband is dead.

Streep's majestic performance is yet another example of her uncanny ability to inhabit a role so completely and so profoundly that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish between actor and character. Streep nails Thatcher's voice, her tone, her mannerisms, her deportment, every nuance of her identity. Her performance is so remarkable that she actually manages to make Thatcher likeable in a number of scenes. Jim Broadbent is equally impressive as Thatcher's loyal and supportive husband Denis, and the rest of the cast is solid as well.

However a film is a sum of all its parts, not just one player in it.  If more care had been taken with the story to make it more riveting, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.  Also, the fact that the film is told from the perspective of flashbacks from a senile Margaret Thatcher was almost, in my opinion, unflattering to her.  The film is called The Iron Lady yet they chose to show her at her weakest moments: having hallucinations about her dead husband, Denis.  Denis was charmingly portrayed by Jim Broadbent.

That would have been more representative of this movie!!!In summary, new generation of young people may ask,  'Who is the 'Iron Lady'?  Why is she call that?'.

Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and she gives, as you would expect, a great performance.Now the bad points of the movie - everything else.  This movie was not at all what I was expecting.  If you're going into the theater looking for a movie on the history, life and career of Margaret Thatcher, you are going to be as bitterly disappointed as I was.The movie focuses on an elderly Thatcher, retired in her home and apparently losing her mind, as she spends a good deal of the movie conversing with the hallucination of her dead husband.  We get disjointed spurts of Thatcher's history thru a series of short flashbacks.  But these flashbacks offer no real insight into her career, certainly not any kind of cohesive history.  The flashbacks seem to be there only to highlight the regrets of an elderly Thatcher, tottering around her apartment alone, relegated to the sidelines by both family and friends alike.The movie is tedious and slow and before it was halfway over, I was bored.  I was also a little mad.Margaret Thatcher was the preeminent female figure for the better part of the 20th century: a political powerhouse.  She was the first modern woman to rise to a position of real power and influence.  Her career opened up a path for other women in politics and her decisions helped shaped the course of Europe.  The title of the movie is The Iron Lady and Thatcher, with all her good points and all her flaws, was powerful and strong and determined.  So it puzzled me why the movie seemed determined to turn her into a parody of female flaws and weaknesses.  She is portrayed as a selfish mother who chose career over family;  a distant wife, who takes her husband for granted until after he is dead; and a catty, overbearing woman who nags and bullies her constituents.It is a completely skewed portrayal of Thatcher - unflattering and I suspect for the most part, untrue.  This movie does not even come close to doing justice to the story of Margaret Thatcher.  It actually has a very anti-Thatcher, anti-woman vibe to it.  The writers have presented us with a morality play with a clear ""lesson"" woven in:  ""See!"", the movie seems to be saying, ""This is what happens to upstart women who abandon their families and their rightful place in pursuit of their career.

And to do it while Ms. Thatcher was still alive must have added a tension and pressure to get it absolutely perfect.In spite of this excellent casting decision, as well as Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis, the screen play focuses more on the decay and old age of a once powerful woman rather than her impressive accomplishments. The story is told via flashbacks from the perspective of the elderly, widowed Thatcher who has developed dementia, and hallucinates that Denis is still with her. This narrative structure diminishes the historic significance of the career of a renowned political leader who steered Britain through some very challenging times.

She suffers from dementia and often carries on conversations with her husband who has been dead for 8 years. She has many flashbacks to her younger years when she went to Oxford University and had a desire to go into politics. She was the daughter of a grocer who was also the mayor in the town in which they lived.She had a hard and focused personality but she has declined to the point where she needs constant care, supervision and protection. Her political successes came as she won three elections for Prime Minister of England and the leader of the Conservative Party for over 11 years......This movie has a major asset, the acting of Meryl Streep, who once again proves that she is possibly the best character actor of all time. Beyond her amazing performance this movie suffers for many reasons. Hollywood likes to take pot shots at leaders and this is no different. Margret Thatcher hated Socialism and Communism and fought to keep England a democratic and market driven country thriving on the intellect and inventiveness of its people. In the movie she is vilified (as she was during her career) but unfortunately this movie only seems to focus on vilifying her and illustrating her Alzheimer's and dementia.The most powerful women in political history also had as many admirers as those who hated her policies. She broke the unions and fought the government from printing money just to be more socialistic. The unions wanted a 30% pay increase. England was going into debt and high inflation was rampant. She helped lead them back to stability and financial security. She believed in taking action and fighting for what was right. She wanted to do something to make the world better rather than just trying to be someone.This movie was focused on belittling Margret Thatcher and depicting her as an old lady severely ill and as a bully when she was Prime Minister. Over 50% of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world. She was one of the leaders who helped stop the cold war with Russia but this topic was hardly even touched!The acting of Meryl Streep was superb but the script and story line was shameful.

1451501,AEGYKCHYY809X,B0059XTUVI,John Chandler,"[9, 13]","Thatcher was one of the most significant political figures of the 20th century and a film about her life is very much needed. This is not it. What we get is essentially two stories linked by a single unique and brilliant actress. Meryl Streep's acting skills are not in dispute but they are wasted in this quite dreadful film. Love or hate her, Margaret Thatcher was one powerful Lady and her life will always be controversial. Rather than concentrating on these issues, some two thirds of this film is about a frail old lady, who looks like Margaret Thatcher, experiencing the problems of advancing senility. To depict anyone in such a light is potentially deeply offensive and distressing to the individual as well as her family and her many friends and admirers. It has no bearing on her political life which was during a time when she was in her prime. This part of the film is quite despicable in my view and uncalled for at this stage of her life. Her husband gets little better treatment being shown mostly as a fool.The second part dealing with some selected scenes from her political life is very much better and shows what might have been achieved with a decent script and a competent director. What disappoints me the most is that Meryl Streep took on such a role. I doubt her intention was to humiliate Thatcher but whatever it was the final result is a lost opportunity as she will never now make the film that she should and could have made. This is really a terrible film and should only be viewed to admire Meryl Streep's consumate acting, it has little or nothing to do with the Iron lady.",1,What a lost opportunity,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,1606,"['Thatcher', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'political', 'figures', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'life', 'very', 'much', 'needed', 'not', 'What', 'get', 'essentially', 'two', 'stories', 'linked', 'single', 'unique', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'dispute', 'are', 'wasted', 'quite', 'dreadful', 'film', 'Love', 'hate', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'one', 'powerful', 'Lady', 'life', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'controversial', 'Rather', 'concentrating', 'issues', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'frail', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'experiencing', 'problems', 'advancing', 'senility', 'depict', 'anyone', 'such', 'light', 'potentially', 'deeply', 'offensive', 'distressing', 'individual', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'many', 'friends', 'admirers', 'bearing', 'political', 'life', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'part', 'film', 'quite', 'despicable', 'view', 'uncalled', 'stage', 'life', 'husband', 'little', 'better', 'treatment', 'being', 'shown', 'mostly', 'fool.The', 'second', 'part', 'dealing', 'selected', 'scenes', 'political', 'life', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'decent', 'script', 'competent', 'director', 'What', 'most', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'took', 'such', 'role', 'doubt', 'intention', 'was', 'humiliate', 'Thatcher', 'whatever', 'was', 'final', 'result', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'will', 'never', 'now', 'make', 'film', 'should', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'terrible', 'film', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'admire', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'consumate', 'acting', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'Iron', 'lady']",N/A
1451502,A168VXSISJWQN9,B0059XTUVI,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[1, 1]",".... what you're left with is this movie.Margaret Thatcher had a profound effect on British politics. Not only the first woman prime minister, but also one of the most committed to her viewpoint, she took Britain by the scruff of the neck and shook it up. The changes Thatcher made were enormous, including destroying the coal-mining industry, increasing home ownership by selling off subsidised housing to the tenants, mobilising the country for a war in the Falkland Islands, slashing government spending and many more. Some people were helped by the changes, some hurt, some, such as the union leaders of the mining industry, destroyed. She was intensely, and deliberately, divisive. Her impact was such that the British Labour party completely reinvented itself as 'New Labour', a party unrecognizable from the old Labour party of the 1970s. Thatcher won 3 elections, became the UK's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century and was ultimately thrown out by her own party. Whatever your feelings towards her, she has to be regarded as the single most important political figure in the UK in the second half of the 20th century.The problem is that this film misses almost all of her impact on society, both positive and negative. Over half the film is given over to an imagined portrait of her in her later years, having conversations with her dead husband. The earlier part of her life is covered in flash-backs, so it lacks continuity and, often, context. In trying to present a portrait of the individual, the film-makers have diminished her actions to a side-issue which is, in her case, entirely inappropriate. Thatcher rarely spoke about her personal feelings and did not let others into her personal life. If ever a person were defined by what she did rather than who she was, it was Margaret Thatcher. The perspective of this movie is all wrong and what should have been a gripping tale of one of the most influential political figures of recent times becomes a rather dreary portrayal of a person in decline.Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 Oscars and won 3 times. In my view, pretty well all of the 14 performances which did not win were better than this one. That's not a criticism of Streep, who is the most brilliant female actor of our time and turns in an immaculate performance as always. It's just that the part is so poorly drawn that Streep is hardly able to utilise her magnificent skills to make it come alive. Instead, I was left with the uneasy feeling that her Academy Award was not for acting but for impersonation. Streep has so often made characters compelling and unforgettable that to see her win for what was basically a female version of Rich Little was somewhat galling. I suspect in later years she will not look on this award as her finest achievement by a very long way.There is scope for an important film to be made about the life and impact of Margaret Thatcher.

Anyone ever see ""Death Becomes Her""? 'Nuff said. However, this could be her best acting role to date. Streep's performance and portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is amazing. It took me several minutes to be certain that who I was seeing on screen was Streep. A good part of that credit goes to the fantastic makeup artists, but it is Streep who pulls off the character perfectly.The film overall is very good, yet not what I expected. I admit that I don't know a great deal about Margaret Thatcher, aside from what most Americans saw on the news when she was Prime Minister. For this reason, I can't really comment on the historical accuracy in any great detail, though the major events of her terms of office were well portrayed.I found that the film is less about Margaret Thatcher the Prime Minister and politician, and more about the person. The film shows how she was influenced greatly by her father's politics and philosophy, how being a woman in a man's world shaped her, and how her children and husband grounded her. Jim Broadbent puts on a brilliant performance of Denis, her husband.Most of the film takes place in the ""present day"" period of Margaret's old age and retirement. Elements of the past are usually presented as vignettes of memory, brought on by some object, topic, or emotion that pulls her into the past.The film is not a historic narrative really, so if you are looking for a 'biography of the prime minister' type movie, this might not be what you're looking for. It is really more a character study of Margaret herself, with relevant periods of her life and career presented throughout.  A very good film. I withheld one star, only because I thought that the presentation of key world events wasn't given the presentation deserved, almost glanced over at times. A bit more study of the times, the politics, and world events might have added 20 minutes, but would have made it a better film.

A film can't capture every nuance of a life, every pivotal moment that shapes a person, so we're left with the high and lows, a highlights reel of a life and ""The Iron Lady"" tries to capture pivotal moments in Margaret Thatcher's rise from grocers daughter to British Prime Minister.Told from the point of view of Thatcher (Meryl Streep) in her dotage carrying on conversations with her now deceased husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent), as she remembers an abbreviated youth, meeting Thatcher at a dinner where she is being vetted to run for a local office, and her quick rise during the 60's and 70's from a member of Parliament to Prime Minister. After she becomes Prime Minister the film really does seem to become a highlights clip of her political career, it does linger on the Falkland Islands war and her analogy to it being a British Pearl Harbor, but after that her tenure as Prime Minister seems to be on fast forward.Streep as Thatcher is almost invisible, some of it is the make-up to make her look in her 80's, but most of it is Streep's performance, as with any of the characters she's created from Sophie to Julia Child, Meryl Streep has the uncanny ability to channel and have the character inhabit her, and while some of those characters may resemble Streep, her characterization carries us away from recognition of the star and to recognition of the character.Special Features on the DVD include: Making of the Iron Lady, Recreating the Young Margaret Thatcher, Denis Thatcher the Man Behind the Woman, Battle in the House of Commons, Costume Design Pearls and Power Suits.

The line about the pearls is there but that fierce "". . .tone we want to strike"" is gone.  Too bad, because when I saw that last August, I knew Streep would win the Academy Award for that role.  Every now and then you'd recognize Streep, but for the most part you really believe she's Thatcher.  Just a superlative job by probably the greatest actress alive.Beyond that the story is totally made up.  It isn't based on any book, or biography or autobiography.  It's just the imaginings of the writer, imagining what Mrs. Thatcher is doing all day at her house in Mayfair.  It's a really quite mean and negative view of her.

Margaret Thatcher's younger self alternates with a portrait of her as dementia sets in (this is no spoiler but clear nearly from the outset of the film).This contrast of past and present can be effective - but not in this film. Streep musters on gamely and evokes Thatcher's character as much as possible within the limits of the script. I was frankly puzzled by how much of the film focused on Thatcher's decline and confusion rather than her most powerful moments in history. It seemed a waste.This isn't an absolute wreck of a film. Certain moments ring true. When Thatcher becomes prime minister  and walks through a sea of men, one feels for Thatcher. Streep conveys Thatcher's resolute nature and presence and her uncertainty about her chances of becoming prime minister. She has to be convinced this is actually possible when her stated goal is only to shake up things. .The movie is unfortunately quite slow and feels like a dull documentary instead of the riveting historical account it could have been.

She is a one-of-a-kind historical figure and her story is both epic and controversial. Hearing that one of the screen's living legends, Meryl Streep, was going to take on this complicated and powerful woman: it was like a dream pairing! So much story to tell! And yet, in a bizarre choice, the screenplay of ""The Iron Lady"" tells us almost nothing. At best, I thought the film had the potential to really dig into the heart of what made Thatcher tick. At worst, I thought the film might be a Cliff's Notes journey through the highs and lows of Thatcher's reign. And yet, for me, there is so little actual content that I'm absolutely speechless. Nothing is put into context. This gives you almost no idea of Thatcher's career, her family life, her politics, or England's history. Instead, the movie focuses on a retired Thatcher speaking to her deceased husband (an always welcome Jim Broadbent) and reflecting back at random moments in her life. I have NEVER seen a biographical movie that has left me so unconnected with ANYTHING having to do with its subject matter! I know that's a big statement, but absolutely how I feel.I remember all the previews of ""The Iron Lady"" with Streep really burning up the screen. When Streep faces down her adversaries in those previews and proclaims that she's had to fight every day of her life, it's a sweepingly dramatic moment. When that scene finally appears in the movie, I literally laughed out loud. Why? Because up to that point, the film had shown us nothing to make me believe it was true. We never know how Thatcher started in politics, how or why she achieved early success, how she was even considered for higher positioning, or anything at all that made her noteworthy as an up-and-coming political figure. Instead, the most background we get is that she's a shopkeeper's daughter. Then how did she get involved in politics? At one point, many years into her reign as Prime Minister, her closest advisors (and they are all interchangeable without one second's thought to developing them as characters) sneer that she's just the aforementioned ""shopkeeper's daughter"" in her presence. Really? It's patently absurd. She's one of the most powerful women in the world at this point with decades of leadership under her. Years fly by, sometimes people like Thatcher, sometimes they don't. You can't really care, because the screenplay is so thin. The only historical moment that gets the least bit of explanation or screen time is the Falkland Islands.Streep, though, does an uncanny impersonation. Oh, the movie that could have been made! She picked up her third Oscar (the first since 1982's Sophie's Choice, WOW!) and her make-up man received a golden statuette as well. But rarely has such greatness been expended for so little pay-off. I feel like I am exactly the target audience for ""The Iron Lady"" and I was so frustrated by its presentation. In all truth, I'd give this picture only one star for missing everything that made Thatcher such a noteworthy historical leader. But for Streep and Broadbent, I'll add one. An enormous missed opportunity!

She warned me that many viewers did not enjoy the viewpoint the director took. After reading the premise and finding it available in the Vine newsletter, I grabbed it.I agree with the other viewers who commented that Margaret Thatcher's politics were glossed over, almost like the filmmakers were detached from the subject. This was disappointing. Yes, they show how she smashed down gender barriers, which was wonderful. But there are other facets to her story which were not realized.I did like a few things: the cinematography is well done. Meryl Streep gives a performance which others have raved about, and with good reason. She's beautiful and bold; she is not afraid to explore different roles. She portrays Thatcher with quiet grace and strength. Her performance is not enough to lift this film back up though.

Meryl Streep gives another outstanding performance, but if you are looking for any insight into Margaret Thatcher, politician or Margaret Thatcher female conservative [ politician], you will be wasting your time, since the rest of the movie reads as Margaret Thatcher's Greatest Hits.Thatcher's formative years are quickly dispatched with a scene or two from the family grocery store and local politician dad giving some libertarian style speeches about one's own bootstraps. Thatcher's Oxford career [ she took a second in chemistry] is missing, and her courtship with her husband is whittled into a few flashbacks -we never learn that he was already a millionaire when they met and financed her law studies [ also missing].Onward to the House of Commons we rush until Thatcher ascends to the position of Prime Minister. Her cabinet is most often filmed standing around her while the viewer gazes at them from her perspective, somewhat like the shots taken of the devil worshiping neighbors in Rosemary's Baby. A few news reels of the miners' strike later, a few explosions courtesy of the IRA and we are in the war room over the Falklands where Meryl Thatcher does her best impersonation of Churchill. The Cold War then is dispatched with a state function, and in the interim Thatcher dresses down her cabinet like a crazed school mistress.There is no insight whatsoever into deep politics, no suggestion that the Falklands may have been strategically important because of their estimated offshore oil reserves, no insight into neo-liberalism or that Thatcher in all her can do earnestness might have been used by the Tories to take the economy from a manufacturing base to one in which deregulated finance rules, no mention that heavily taxed North Sea Oil revenue might have saved her administration rather than any policy she may have implemented and so on.Pretty shallow stuff, though the human story and interaction between Thatcher and the spirit of her late husband is touching.",3,The stars are for Meryl's performance,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2098,"['study', 'incipient', 'dementia', 'movie', 'well', 'old', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'seen', 'final', 'days', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'are', 'looking', 'insight', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'politician', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'female', 'conservative', '[', 'politician', ']', 'will', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'rest', 'movie', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Greatest', 'Hits.Thatcher', 'formative', 'years', 'are', 'quickly', 'dispatched', 'scene', 'two', 'family', 'grocery', 'store', 'local', 'politician', 'dad', 'giving', 'libertarian', 'style', 'speeches', 'one', 'own', 'bootstraps', 'Thatcher', 'Oxford', 'career', '[', 'took', 'second', 'chemistry', ']', 'missing', 'courtship', 'husband', 'whittled', 'few', 'flashbacks', '-we', 'never', 'learn', 'was', 'already', 'millionaire', 'when', 'met', 'financed', 'law', 'studies', '[', 'also', 'missing', ']', '.Onward', 'House', 'Commons', 'rush', 'Thatcher', 'position', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'cabinet', 'most', 'often', 'filmed', 'standing', 'viewer', 'gazes', 'perspective', 'somewhat', 'shots', 'taken', 'devil', 'worshiping', 'neighbors', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'A', 'few', 'news', 'reels', 'miners', 'strike', 'later', 'few', 'explosions', 'courtesy', 'IRA', 'are', 'war', 'room', 'Falklands', 'where', 'Meryl', 'Thatcher', 'best', 'impersonation', 'Churchill', 'Cold', 'War', 'then', 'dispatched', 'state', 'function', 'interim', 'Thatcher', 'down', 'cabinet', 'crazed', 'school', 'insight', 'whatsoever', 'deep', 'politics', 'suggestion', 'Falklands', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'strategically', 'important', 'estimated', 'oil', 'reserves', 'insight', 'neo-liberalism', 'Thatcher', 'can', 'do', 'earnestness', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'Tories', 'take', 'economy', 'manufacturing', 'base', 'one', 'deregulated', 'finance', 'rules', 'mention', 'heavily', 'taxed', 'North', 'Sea', 'Oil', 'revenue', 'might', 'have', 'saved', 'administration', 'rather', 'policy', 'may', 'have', 'implemented', 'so', 'on.Pretty', 'shallow', 'stuff', 'human', 'story', 'interaction', 'Thatcher', 'spirit', 'late', 'husband', 'touching']",N/A

She was a great lady and I do hope that her strength, integrity and huge contributions to history will be remembered truthfully and fairly.I so agree with what Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said regarding the senate resolution honoring Lady Thatcher, ""Let me just say that Margaret was one of the most influential and revolutionary figures of the 20th century, and failing to name her achievements would do her memory and her legacy a great disservice. It would be unheard of to commemorate Churchill for example and ignore his heroic role in steering his countrymen through the battle of Britain, nor would we think of honoring Lincoln without mentioning the Civil War,"" McConnell said. He added: ""Let's acknowledge the enormity of what she accomplished. Let's mention her achievements by name and the resolution does that because we owe her a tribute equal to her legacy.""Truer words were never spoken, and this sentiment very aptly applies to the movie THE IRON LADY. May she Rest In Peace.  ~Linda~ORIGINAL REVIEW - April 15, 2012:  I cannot understand what they were thinking!  An opportunity to make a movie about one of the MOST FASCINATING AND INFLUENTIAL WOMEN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.  The greatest actress of our generation playing the lead.  And this opportunity is squandered on a ditzy, artsy-fartsy script that examines the whole thing through the fictional fantasy lens of and elderly Margaret Thatcher's demented flashbacks - as if anyone actually knows what is really going on in the mind of a person with dementia.  What a waste.It started out OK.  A lot of movies detailing the lives of great people start out in the first 10 minutes showing the main character in advanced old age and the main story is told in a long flashback.  This kind of plot device was done very well in the movie ""Chariots of Fire"".  I don't mind knowing that Margaret Thatcher is suffering from dementia - it is a fact and is not out of place in a story about her life.  But the problem with ""The Iron Lady"" is that the story got stuck in the advanced old age segment and about 45 minutes into the movie, I realized that the makers of this bomb had no intention of examining the MAIN STORY at all.  The WHOLE thing was about a lonely, demented old woman whose glory days have passed her by and now she is of no importance.  I found myself heaving an involuntary sigh of exasperation when I was subjected to yet another imaginary conversation held in the ""fictional"" Mrs. Thatcher's hallucination world.  What little factual and historically relevant information they included was hazy and spotty. The flow of the script is so disjointed that no sensible understanding of Margaret Thatcher's incredible life, accomplishments, family, or career can be gleaned from this self indulgent mess.  The people involved in making this boring, pointless movie should be ashamed.  I was expecting so much because it could have been great but was sorely disappointed.A flick about an elderly woman suffering from dementia should have been saved for an arthouse fiction about dementia, not imposed on a life story of someone of this magnitude.  Really, what could have been the motive for obsuring Margaret Thatcher's enormous contributions to the twentieth century?  Could it be that the makers of this flick hated her and her politics and wanted to diminish and marginalize her but didn't have the courage to do it in an honest and up front fashion?  That is the only thing I can figure out because this movie makes absolutely no sense at all.  At best, it is a tawdry invasion of Mrs. Thatcher's and her family's privacy as she faces a slow and difficult death.  Perhaps it is a fact that she is struggling with dementia, but the writers of this script are not privy to the details of how that is being played out and have been forced to fictionalize it to an absurd degree in order to have a story that leaves out who she really is.  To magnify this small aspect of her life while brushing aside the bulk of her life's work is almost criminal.There are only three good things that I have to say about this movie.  First, the make up artist did an exceptional job of making Meryl Streep look extremely elderly.  Most of the time, old age make up is sloppy and not believable, but I have to say that Ms. Streep really did look realisticly old in this movie.  The second thing is that Meryl Streep did a great job of acting, as usual.  It is a pity that she has no better judgement than to lend her great talent to a substandard production like this one.  I have always had some respect for Ms. Streep, but after watching this movie, I have lost some of my former good opinion of her. The third thing was that the movie finally ended and I never have to see it again.I will never get back the time and money I wasted watching this stupid show, but I can spare just a few extra minutes to warn you that this is a waste of time for anyone who wishes to actually know anything about Margaret Thatcher and her real life.  Those facts are documented for anyone to see and no story teller needs to descend into outrageous liscence to make a movie with something worthwhile to say.  If you want to make a moive about dementia, then make a movie about dementia.  If you want to make a movie about Margaret Thatcher, then please, PLEASE make a true one.",1,"Big, Big Disappointment",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,5451,"['UPDATE', 'April', '8', '2013', 'just',

Her performance is amazing. It's detailed and extremely subtle. Broadly gentle and very honest in what ends up being the end of her life. I understand why she was nominated and why she won! With the make-up, movements and emotion...she was Margaret Thatcher.However, Director Phyllidia Lloyd may not have the chops this type of drama film. It was slow to start and has the style of seeing the legendary English leader going through her daily routine as an elderly, dementia stricken woman - by going back and forth with flashbacks brought on by her old pics, memorabilia, news clippings and even clothing. Director Lloyd did a much better job directing Mama Mia.  The fast paced, toe-tapping, gotta-sing-along, movie musical with the ABBA soundtrack!What makes this movie passable and worth waiting for is the performances; once you get to them! Thatcher's husband Denis, played humorously by the brilliant Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, Indiana Jones) makes their partnership - both in life and death extremely heartfelt.Other amazing performances included those by Anthony Head (Merlin, Buffy The vampire Slayer) who was the Parliament President and that of Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Corpse Bride) who played Parliament's lead man. The two against Meryl were engaging to say the least.Overall the screenplay, written by Abi Morgan (from British TV) like the film, is a little slow handed. The pieces of controversy over English issues with her people and the Falkland Islands became great dialogue scenes with anger, frustration and why Thatcher was coined `The Iron Lady' by the Russians. If anything the performances and inside view of history that Margaret Thatcher made, make this film worth watching. I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall. Meryl is definitely worth it as is the rest of the cast.

I watched for the first 20 minutes, maybe less, and came to the computer to read the reviews.  Was it me?  At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film. After reading the reviews, I realized that many other reviews were not good, and though it's Meryl Streep, and she's a great actress, it didn't help. I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.  Why didn't they make a film about the high points of her life and career? That's what I thought it would be.  Who knows?  Good advice.

1451528,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B0059XTUVI,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[21, 25]","When I think about this movie I am filled with a sense of inner conflict.On the one hand I am highly impressed with Meryl Streep's performance, for which she has at long last and deservedly won her third Academy Award after a 30 year gap, and after being nominated for the Academy Award a record seventeen times.Once every two years she is nominated for an Academy Award. Only Katharine Hepburn has more with four.Other directors have made movies about our leading political figures. Often these movies are not flattering portraits. Oliver Stone made a satirical comedy about G W Bush, which I found highly entertaining, somewhat of a caricature. Michael Moore made a far more scathing movie Fahrenheit 911. Then we have Primary Colors where where John Travolta played a played a Presidential candidate much like president Clinton. Stone also directed Nixon, a somewhat sympathetic picture of a character many regarded as villainous. Even though these portratits were not flattering you could detect some love or least amusement for the subject.Now with Iron Lady, we have a movie which defines its subject through the lens of disease, presumably Alzheimer's, although it never states the exact disease. The movie starts out promisingly enough with Thatcher, the grocers daughter, buying a bottle of milk, unrecognised and confused at a local grocery store.Streep conveys every nuance of Thatcher extremely well. The actor truly becomes the character, capturing, the tone, the accent, the gestures, the body language impeccably.What happens though, as you continue to watch, too much of the story is frittered away on depicting Thatcher as she is now, her disease, imaginary conversations with her long dead husband, living in the past, with occasional flashbacks, to the significant events of her political life, the romance with Denis, her rise to power, the various crises while she was in office, terrorist attacks, the Falklands War, the H Block protest, which escalated the tensions in Northern Irealnd, and so forth, and ultimately her fall from grace.I found this focus on defining the character by her disease extremely annoying and tiresome, and a huge mistake by the screenwriters to spend almost 50% of the time focusing on the disease while while forwarding through the significant events. The Faklands war is compressed to about five minutes. The H Block protests last about thirty seconds.I lived in the UK for the latter part of her leadership. Her insistence on an unpopular tax was the beginning of her downfall, and the cause of her being deposed as leader through the usual shenanigans. Here again we have very short treatment of what could have been great drama in favor of promoting the disease.When this movie was released several months ago in Argentina, it reportedly escalated tensions in Argentina. A journalist in the Falklands made an unflattering comment about the current female president. There were threats of invasion, and death threats against the journalist. It appears that she knows how to work the situation. Thankfully, this movie did not start a war.Iron Lady could have been a much better movie with a shift in focus away from the disease.Recently, I listened to an interview Streep did on the (NPR Fresh Air program), shortly before the Oscars. It was fascinating to learn how she puts together a character, and how she captured all those aspects of Thatcher's voice and rhetoric, the vocal coaching Thatcher underwent to moderate the strident early vocal style. How Thatcher had enormous lung power. People would wait for a break in breath to interrupt, but she would just keep going, much to their frustration. It discussed Streep's entire career. It was extremely well researched. Catch it if you can.I think most people will appreciate Streep's performance, but probably will not like the movie overall. I will not watch this movie again. I hope that future screenwriters and directors will have more sympathy and sensitivity for their subject than this.If not for Streeps performance this would be a one star review. Her longtime hairstylist also won an Oscar for this movie.Hope this was helpful.",3,The movie that nearly started a war,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,4145,"['When', 'think', 'movie', 'am', 'filled', 'sense', 'inner', 'conflict.On', 'one', 'hand', 'am', 'highly', 'impressed', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'long', 'last', 'deservedly', 'won', 'third', 'Academy', 'Award', '30', 'year', 'gap', 'being', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'record', 'seventeen', 'times.Once', 'two', 'years', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Only', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'more', 'four.Other', 'directors', 'have', 'made', 'movies', 'leading', 'political', 'figures', 'Often', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'flattering', 'portraits', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'G', 'W', 'Bush', 'found', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'caricature', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'scathing', 'movie', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'Then', 'have', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'where', 'where', 'John', 'Travolta', 'played', 'played', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'much', 'president', 'Clinton', 'Stone', 'also', 'directed', 'Nixon', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'picture', 'character', 'many', 'regarded', 'as', 'villainous', 'Even', 'portratits', 'were', 'not', 'flattering', 'could', 'detect', 'love', 'least', 'amusement', 'subject.Now', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'have', 'movie', 'subject', 'lens', 'disease', 'presumably', 'Alzheimer', 'never', 'exact', 'disease', 'movie', 'out', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Thatcher', 'grocers', 'daughter', 'buying', 'bottle', 'milk', 'unrecognised', 'confused', 'local', 'grocery', 'store.Streep', 'conveys', 'nuance', 'Thatcher', 'extremely', 'well', 'actor', 'truly', 'character', 'capturing', 'tone', 'accent', 'gestures', 'body', 'language', 'impeccably.What', 'though', 'continue', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'frittered', 'away', 'depicting', 'Thatcher', 'now', 'disease', 'imaginary', 'conversations', 'long', 'dead', 'husband', 'living', 'past', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'significant', 'events', 'political', 'life', 'romance', 'Denis', 'rise', 'power', 'various', 'crises', 'was', 'office', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'Falklands', 'War', 'H', 'Block', 'protest', 'escalated', 'tensions', 'Northern', 'Irealnd', 'so', 'forth', 'ultimately', 'fall', 'grace.I', 'found', 'focus', 'defining', 'character', 'disease', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'tiresome', 'huge', 'mistake', 'screenwriters', 'spend', 'almost', '50', '%', 'time', 'focusing', 'disease', 'forwarding', 'significant', 'events', 'Faklands', 'war', 'compressed', 'five', 'minutes', 'H', 'Block', 'protests', 'last', 'thirty', 'seconds.I', 'lived', 'UK', 'latter', 'part', 'leadership', 'insistence', 'unpopular', 'tax', 'was', 'beginning', 'downfall', 'cause', 'being', 'deposed', 'leader', 'usual', 'shenanigans', 'Here', 'again', 'have', 'very', 'short', 'treatment', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'drama', 'favor', 'promoting', 'disease.When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'Argentina', 'reportedly', 'escalated', 'tensions', 'Argentina', 'journalist', 'Falklands', 'made', 'unflattering', 'comment', 'current', 'female', 'president', 'were', 'threats', 'invasion', 'death', 'threats', 'journalist', 'how', 'work', 'situation', 'Thankfully', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'war.Iron', 'Lady', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'shift', 'focus', 'away', 'disease.Recently', 'listened', 'interview', 'Streep', 'did', 'NPR', 'Fresh', 'Air', 'program', 'shortly', 'Oscars', 'was', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'how', 'together', 'character', 'how', 'captured', 'aspects', 'Thatcher', 'voice', 'rhetoric', 'vocal', 'coaching', 'Thatcher', 'underwent', 'moderate', 'strident', 'early', 'vocal', 'style', 'How', 'Thatcher', 'had', 'enormous', 'lung', 'power', 'People', 'would', 'wait', 'break', 'breath', 'interrupt', 'would', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'much', 'frustration', 'discussed', 'Streep', 'entire', 'career', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'researched', 'Catch', 'can.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Streep', 'performance', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'overall', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'hope', 'future', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'sympathy', 'sensitivity', 'subject', 'this.If', 'not', 'Streeps', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'longtime', 'hairstylist', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'movie.Hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

This is precisely the reason I'm not going to. Why? Firstly such things should not be a factor when judging a film and, secondly, if you're less than the age of 40 (as ironically most people who debate the subject are), then your views probably have more to do with where you grew up, rather than firsthand experience.So, what is `The Iron Lady' like? As you may know from other reviews, Meryl Streep's performance is first rate and this is not just hyperbole as most of the post-cinema conversations I heard were of people saying the same thing.There is also credit due to the rest of the cast and the director as almost everything about the film comes off as eerily similar to the real thing (although Denis Thatcher seemed a bit more `wild' in real life than he is portrayed here, and many of the Conservative figures (except Richard E. Grant) are not as identifiable as they should be).The plot too is cleverly worked out, showing Thatcher's political life through the lens of a dementia patient. It struck me that even if all `Margaret Thatcher' had ever done was being a fiercely competitive flower arranger; the portrayal would still have the same - i.e. neutral and mostly fair.And this same strength - a fresh perspective - may also be its greatest weakness. In exploring Lady T's dementia, the politics are rather left aside. You almost feel like you want them to say something to offend you, rather than by mild inference, and the film may be seen as too much of a whitewash of the significant events of her premiership.That said, striking the right balance with films on controversial subjects is always tricky, as inevitably the bias of the director comes through. The fact that Lady Thatcher has refused to see the film may be a sign that the author hasn't pandered to her too much, just as the fact that the film is being boycotted on Tyneside shows that it is clearly too close to the truth for comfort.In my humble opinion, then, a good film, if a little light on politics. Although the film seems to have sparked a revival in Thatcher-bashing, it's good to see that someone has finally taken much of the venom out of the subject and given it a breath of fresh air.",4,Finally a film that breaks with the past,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,2386,"['traditional', 'reviews', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'such', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'books', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'declare', 'position', 'reader', 'can', 'make', 'snap', 'judgment', 'wont', 'precisely', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'Why', 'Firstly', 'such', 'things', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'factor', 'when', 'judging', 'film', 'secondly', ""'re"", 'less', 'age', '40', 'ironically', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'debate', 'subject', 'are', 'then', 'views', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'rather', 'firsthand', 'experience.So', 'what', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'like', 'may', 'know', 'other', 'reviews', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'first', 'rate', 'not', 'just', 'hyperbole', 'most', 'post-cinema', 'conversations', 'heard', 'were', 'people', 'saying', 'same', 'thing.There', 'also', 'credit', 'due', 'rest', 'cast', 'director', 'almost', 'everything', 'film', 'off', 'eerily', 'similar', 'real', 'thing', 'Denis', 'Thatcher', 'seemed', 'bit', 'more', 'wild', 'real', 'life', 'portrayed', 'here', 'many', 'Conservative', 'figures', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'identifiable', 'should', 'be', '.The', 'plot', 'too', 'cleverly', 'worked', 'out', 'showing', 'Thatcher', 'political', 'life', 'lens', 'dementia', 'patient', 'struck', 'even', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'was', 'being', 'fiercely', 'competitive', 'flower', 'arranger', 'portrayal', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'i.e', 'neutral', 'mostly', 'fair.And', 'same', 'strength', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'exploring', 'Lady', 'T', 'dementia', 'politics', 'are', 'rather', 'left', 'aside', 'almost', 'feel', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'offend', 'rather', 'mild', 'inference', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'whitewash', 'significant', 'events', 'premiership.That', 'said', 'striking', 'right', 'balance', 'films', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'always', 'tricky', 'inevitably', 'bias', 'director', 'fact', 'Lady', 'Thatcher', 'refused', 'see', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'sign', 'author', ""n't"", 'pandered', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'fact', 'film', 'being', 'boycotted', 'Tyneside', 'clearly', 'too', 'close', 'truth', 'comfort.In', 'humble', 'opinion', 'then', 'good', 'film', 'little', 'light', 'politics', 'film', 'have', 'sparked', 'revival', 'Thatcher-bashing', 'good', 'see', 'someone', 'finally', 'taken', 'much', 'venom', 'subject', 'given', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air']",N/A

It ends up being rootless and impressionistic. Somewhat like a short TV clip show biography shown when someone has died. All the right notes are struck but nothing of the slightest importance is communicated. The script is superficial, empty and ultimately meaningless.Its difficult to comment on the acting of Meryl Streep given that the role and the script give her nothing of any particular greatness to do. Rather than acting, what seemed to be required in the part was the skills of a mimic and for an older woman (she IS 62) to play an older woman. To be fair, thats what most people want in this sort of thing. They are far less interested in acting than in simply re-creating. I guess I can praise her for giving the masses what they wanted.She is doing what became somewhat of a staple for older male actors on broadway for a while. A famous person is mimiced over a superficial coverage of their life and everyone wallows in a fit of nostalgia for both the person and the actor playing the person.The two most dramatically interesting parts of her life are her improbable rise & transformation into(or creation of) the ""Iron Lady"" between 1974 and 1979.

1451539,A3PLM7HS3SVXLL,B0059XTUVI,Mark Dyer,"[1, 1]","This is a sub-standard film about a lady who appeared to have dementia and who loved/loves her late husband. Along the way it was interrupted by news archives of some of the most important events in the UK in the second half of the 20th century as the country's economic and social situation was changed almost beyond recognition. Perhaps the film-makers had a little too much funding because in some places reconstructions replaced the archive footage.I finished watching this with mild feelings of anger towards those who made this film. Like her or loath her, Margaret Thatcher was one of the major forces in not only UK politics but the world scene as well. This was an attempt to portray `the woman' so it was long on pathos and the love story between her and Dennis yet almost completely lacking in analysis and chronicling of her achievements. The final scene where she washed up a teacup was particularly unnecessary.Jim Broadbent was excellent, as he often is; Meryl Streep did a fine job; Olivia Colman did well as Carole Thatcher and Anthony Head was good as Geoffrey Howe.I wasn't looking for a documentary but I did hope for some dramatisation and explanation of some of the seminal moments of the late 20th century. Where, for example, were any of the following, or perhaps I blinked and missed them:* Standing up to the naysayers (even in her own party) as the economy worsened before it got better following her formulation then implementation of a monetarist economic policy.* Any sort of scene with Ronald Reagan apart from a few seconds of dance.* Any coverage of her dealings with Gorbachev - whom she had described as `a man we can do business with' whilst disagreeing fundamentally with his politics.* Anything to do with her arguments with the European Union.* The miners' strike - pretty much a civil war. What about the preparations made by the Government, the tactics, her feelings regarding the destruction of several communities.* Northern Ireland and terrorism in general.* The Falklands War got more than a few seconds of screen time but the scenes were so disjointed as to be barely worthwhile.By simply showing clips of what had happened the film implies that she merely dealt well with events as they unfolded. Margaret Thatcher had strategies and principals and we should have seen more about how she made plans and put them into effect. I got no impression of her analysis of the country she started with nor her strategy to change it for the better (by her definition).The opening scenes may have been fine to set the tone and use of flashbacks was perhaps a useful idea. However, the dementia scenes went on far too much and all we got in the end was some form of luvvie/arty self indulgence rather than a serious film charting her personality and life of achievement.",2,Such a waste,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2805,"['sub-standard', 'film', 'lady', 'who', 'appeared', 'have', 'dementia', 'who', 'late', 'husband', 'way', 'was', 'interrupted', 'news', 'archives', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'UK', 'second', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'country', 'economic', 'social', 'situation', 'was', 'changed', 'almost', 'recognition', 'Perhaps', 'film-makers', 'had', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'funding', 'places', 'reconstructions', 'replaced', 'archive', 'footage.I', 'finished', 'watching', 'mild', 'feelings', 'anger', 'towards', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'loath', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'forces', 'not', 'only', 'UK', 'politics', 'world', 'scene', 'well', 'was', 'attempt', 'portray', 'woman', 'was', 'long', 'pathos', 'love', 'story', 'Dennis', 'yet', 'almost', 'completely', 'lacking', 'analysis', 'chronicling', 'achievements', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'washed', 'up', 'teacup', 'was', 'particularly', 'unnecessary.Jim', 'Broadbent', 'was', 'excellent', 'often', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'did', 'well', 'Carole', 'Thatcher', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'was', 'good', 'Geoffrey', 'Howe.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'documentary', 'did', 'hope', 'dramatisation', 'explanation', 'seminal', 'moments', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'Where', 'example', 'were', 'following', 'perhaps', 'blinked', 'missed', '*', 'Standing', 'up', 'naysayers', 'even', 'own', 'party', 'economy', 'worsened', 'got', 'better', 'following', 'formulation', 'then', 'implementation', 'monetarist', 'economic', 'policy', '*', 'sort', 'scene', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'apart', 'few', 'seconds', 'dance', '*', 'coverage', 'dealings', 'Gorbachev', 'whom', 'had', 'described', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'business', 'whilst', 'disagreeing', 'fundamentally', 'politics', '*', 'Anything', 'do', 'arguments', 'European', 'Union', '*', 'miners', 'strike', 'pretty', 'much', 'civil', 'war', 'What', 'preparations', 'made', 'Government', 'tactics', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'destruction', 'several', 'communities', '*', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'terrorism', 'general', '*', 'Falklands', 'War', 'got', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'disjointed', 'be', 'barely', 'worthwhile.By', 'simply', 'showing', 'clips', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'film', 'implies', 'merely', 'dealt', 'well', 'events', 'unfolded', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'had', 'strategies', 'principals', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'how', 'made', 'plans', 'put', 'effect', 'got', 'impression', 'analysis', 'country', 'started', 'strategy', 'change', 'better', 'definition', '.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'set', 'tone', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'perhaps', 'useful', 'idea', 'However', 'dementia', 'scenes', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'got', 'end', 'was', 'form', 'luvvie/arty', 'self', 'indulgence', 'rather', 'serious', 'film', 'charting', 'personality', 'life', 'achievement']",N/A
1451540,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0059XTUVI,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[96, 119]","Let me begin by saying that I think Meryl Streep is perhaps the most talented actress to EVER appear in films.  It is no coincidence that she has been nominated for Academy Awards and Golden Globes more often than any other person.That being said, ""The Iron Lady"" is neither a ""crown jewel"" nor a ""feather in her cap.""There must have been a powerful draw to portray Dame Margaret Thatcher, the first (and so far, only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain. But when I think of recent ""real-life"" biopics like ""Ray"" or ""The King's Speech"" (or even ""Julie & Julia"", which featured Streep as famed Chef Julia Child), ""The Iron Lady"" falls short.  Far short.The film is anchored in a recent time - with Mrs. Thatcher an old widow, at least a little demented and frequented by hallucinations of her dead husband, played by Jim Broadbent in maybe the film's best performance.  The rest of the film is told in clumsy flashbacks, but always returns to doddering old Maggie - Ms. Streep under an often distractingly bad pile of makeup.  Old Margaret shuffles around the house, looks confused, stares out the window, and absolutely sucks any life from the narrative.  (Here the fault lies not with Ms. Streep, but with the screenplay and direction.  And perhaps editor.  Was there no one putting the final product together who looked at ""the forest"" and noticed ""hey... we've got about half of the running time devoted to old Margaret shuffling around, getting in and out of bed, etc.?"")In REALLY brief don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them flashbacks we see the Margaret who grows up the daughter of a grocer with a political bent, marries a young earnest man who sees that Margaret is determined to become the powerful half of a couple, has twins, runs for office, and is finally thrust forward as Leader of the Conservative Party and elected Prime Minister.In a good biopic (like last year's King's Speech) you get a good feel for not only the central figure, but also those surrounding.  In ""The Iron Lady"" I never felt any connection to anyone.  Other players, such as daughters, other members of Parliament or American Secretaries of State, show up long enough to be cast aside by the ambitious ""Iron Lady"".How I wish that this film had reached the scope of ""Gandhi"" or the emotional depth of ""The Queen."" The Mrs. and I agreed that it is likely that both Ms. Streep and Dame Thatcher herself are not pleased with the result.  We know we weren't - and it isn't OUR movie.Addendum: Last Sunday Meryl Streep and her make-up team both won Academy Awards for this film.  Neither of these facts change my opinion.  I read a post-Oscar article that suggested that the Make-up Award was given BECAUSE of Streep's performance.  Perhaps, but that being said, the Mrs. and I saw ""J.Edgar"" since I wrote my original review here - and the ""old age makeup"" for Leonardo DiCaprio was substantially more believable than what we saw in ""The Iron Lady.""  Again - my major beef for this film is not at all related to Ms. Streep's performance or to the makeup, but rather to the overall movie and the amount of time it devoted to depicting a very old and very demented Margaret Thatcher.  Because of the award, someone unfamiliar with Street's total body of work could be tempted to think this performance and film superior to The Deer Hunter, Out of Africa, Bridges of Madison County, Doubt, etc.  IMHO - this would be incorrect.",2,What's the opposite of a Crown Jewel?,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,3403,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'think', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perhaps', 'most', 'talented', 'actress', 'EVER', 'appear', 'films', 'coincidence', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'more', 'often', 'other', 'person.That', 'being', 'said', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'crown', 'jewel', 'feather', 'cap', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'draw', 'portray', 'Dame', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'first', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'female', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Great', 'Britain', 'when', 'think', 'recent', 'real-life', 'biopics', 'Ray', 'King', 'Speech', 'even', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'featured', 'Streep', 'famed', 'Chef', 'Julia', 'Child', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'short', 'Far', 'short.The', 'film', 'anchored', 'recent', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Thatcher', 'old', 'widow', 'least', 'little', 'demented', 'frequented', 'hallucinations', 'dead', 'husband', 'played', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'maybe', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'rest', 'film', 'told', 'clumsy', 'flashbacks', 'always', 'returns', 'doddering', 'old', 'Maggie', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'often', 'distractingly', 'bad', 'pile', 'makeup', 'Old', 'Margaret', 'house', 'confused', 'out', 'window', 'absolutely', 'life', 'narrative', 'Here', 'fault', 'not', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'perhaps', 'editor', 'Was', 'one', 'putting', 'final', 'product', 'together', 'who', 'looked', 'forest', 'noticed', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'got', 'half', 'running', 'time', 'devoted', 'old', 'Margaret', 'shuffling', 'around', 'getting', 'bed', 'etc.', 'REALLY', 'brief', ""don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them"", 'flashbacks', 'see', 'Margaret', 'who', 'up', 'daughter', 'grocer', 'political', 'bent', 'young', 'earnest', 'man', 'who', 'Margaret', 'determined', 'become', 'powerful', 'half', 'couple', 'twins', 'runs', 'office', 'finally', 'thrust', 'forward', 'Leader', 'Conservative', 'Party', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister.In', 'good', 'biopic', 'last', 'year', 'King', 'Speech', 'get', 'good', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'central', 'figure', 'also', 'surrounding', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'never', 'felt', 'connection', 'anyone', 'Other', 'players', 'such', 'daughters', 'other', 'members', 'Parliament', 'American', 'Secretaries', 'State', 'show', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'cast', 'aside', 'ambitious', 'Iron', 'Lady', '.How', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'reached', 'scope', 'Gandhi', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Queen', 'Mrs.', 'agreed', 'likely', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'Dame', 'Thatcher', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'result', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'OUR', 'movie.Addendum', 'Last', 'Sunday', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'make-up', 'team', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'film', 'facts', 'change', 'opinion', 'read', 'post-Oscar', 'article', 'suggested', 'Make-up', 'Award', 'was', 'given', 'BECAUSE', 'Streep', 'performance', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'said', 'Mrs.', 'saw', 'J.Edgar', 'wrote', 'original', 'review', 'here', 'old', 'age', 'makeup', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'substantially', 'more', 'believable', 'what', 'saw', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'Again', 'major', 'beef', 'film', 'not', 'all', 'related', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'performance', 'makeup', 'rather', 'overall', 'movie', 'amount', 'time', 'devoted', 'depicting', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'demented', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'award', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'Street', 'total', 'body', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'tempted', 'think', 'performance', 'film', 'superior', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Doubt', 'etc', 'IMHO', 'would', 'be', 'incorrect']",N/A
1451541,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0059XTUVI,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","For a film called THE IRON LADY this movie was felt more like it was formed from Reynold's wrap. But what else would you expect in a movie made about a Conservative woman by a group of Liberal die hards? Its difficult not to bring politics into a film of this nature since the centerpiece is a politician. But when all that's offered is a one sided description how can you not?For those who are confused while watching a film that jumps back and forth in time then stop reading and forget this movie. It does that from start to finish and not very well. The object of the movie, the Iron Lady in question, is ex-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, portrayed here by Meryl Streep in an Oscar winning performance. Just another example of why the Oscars mean so little these days.The film opens with Thatcher in her later years post PM status and after the death of her beloved husband Dennis (Jim Broadbent). At this time Thatcher was dealing with the impending onset of Alzheimer's as well as the loss of the man she so desperately cared for. We watch as she attempts to force herself to part with those things left behind, clothes and the like. And while she does, so various items and things around her home lead her to remember her past.We get glimpses of young Margaret as she works in her father's store while the other girls walk past. We she her listening and being influenced by her father's speeches to the locals touting the value of a solid business front not willing to cower to the Nazis as they attempt to bomb the country and force the people into hiding. These are the ideas that formed the basis for her beliefs but they are given short time here.Flash forward as Margaret deals with her daughter or perhaps the other way round. We see her getting ready for a dinner with friends where her opinions are asked but she seems buried in the past and her guests seem more embarrassed than pleased to hear her views. Her daughter acts the same.Back in time we see how Margaret meets Dennis but not how they fell in love. Margaret decides to take on the establishment and become a female member of Parliament. Her struggles in the face of chauvinism can be seen here with a touch of the problems she faced but more in focus as to the differences in clothing choices, a bright blue dress among a sea of black suits.  Then back to her slow slide into dementia.The important historic moments in Thatcher's life are touched on but very lightly. Incidents like the Falkland War and the miner's strike feel like they are mentioned without any depth to them. Other items like the Iran hostage situation are ignored completely. With the amount of story involved in Thatcher's life I was left wondering why the film makers here decided that her illness seemed the most interesting part of her life instead of those more interesting historical moments. Then again when thinking about Hollywood's depiction of Conservative figures I recalled the attempt to make Ronald Reagan look senile and mentally ill as well. The friendship between Reagan and Thatcher is barely touched on in this film.Streep won the Oscar for best actress for her performance here. I am at a loss as to understand why with the exception of the fact that she is Hollywood royalty and is nominated for anything she does these days. I saw little acting here and more impersonation. If that's all it takes to win an Oscar then Rich Little should have had an entire shelf lined with the trophies. I will admit that I've never been a Streep fan up front but this movie did little to change my mind.It would be nice if folks in Hollywood would take a historical topic and present the facts untarnished by their own viewpoints when making the film. I have little doubt that there were bad things about Thatcher but there were good as well. A movie that would choose to present both sides and let the viewer decide would have been interesting. This movie did little but make you wonder how she stayed PM for 11 years. Then again the movie also made you wonder about her sanity the longer you watched.To capture an entire life in 105 minutes is difficult at best. To present it accurately and fairly even more so. Some may watch this film and think they've learned about Margaret Thatcher. It only made me want to look deeper into her life as this felt more like fluff than biographical film. The only good thing this movie presented was the love and adoration Thatcher felt for her husband. Even a story revolving solely around that would have made a better film.",1,TIN FOIL FLICK,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,4531,"['film', 'called', 'THE', 'IRON', 'LADY', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'formed', 'Reynold', 'wrap', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'made', 'Conservative', 'woman', 'group', 'Liberal', 'die', 'hards', 'difficult', 'not', 'bring', 'politics', 'film', 'nature', 'centerpiece', 'politician', 'when', 'offered', 'one', 'sided', 'description', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'confused', 'watching', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'then', 'stop', 'reading', 'forget', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'object', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'question', 'ex-British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Just', 'example', 'why', 'Oscars', 'mean', 'so', 'little', 'days.The', 'film', 'Thatcher', 'later', 'years', 'post', 'PM', 'status', 'death', 'beloved', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'time', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'dealing', 'impending', 'onset', 'Alzheimer', 'as', 'well', 'loss', 'man', 'so', 'desperately', 'cared', 'watch', 'force', 'part', 'things', 'left', 'behind', 'clothes', 'like', 'so', 'various', 'items', 'things', 'home', 'lead', 'remember', 'past.We', 'get', 'glimpses', 'young', 'Margaret', 'father', 'store', 'other', 'girls', 'walk', 'past', 'listening', 'being', 'influenced', 'father', 'speeches', 'locals', 'touting', 'value', 'solid', 'business', 'front', 'not', 'willing', 'cower', 'Nazis', 'attempt', 'bomb', 'country', 'force', 'people', 'hiding', 'are', 'ideas', 'formed', 'basis', 'beliefs', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'time', 'here.Flash', 'forward', 'Margaret', 'deals', 'daughter', 'perhaps', 'other', 'way', 'round', 'see', 'getting', 'ready', 'dinner', 'friends', 'where', 'opinions', 'are', 'asked', 'buried', 'past', 'guests', 'seem', 'more', 'embarrassed', 'pleased', 'hear', 'views', 'daughter', 'same.Back', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'Margaret', 'Dennis', 'not', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'Margaret', 'take', 'establishment', 'become', 'female', 'member', 'Parliament', 'struggles', 'face', 'chauvinism', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'here', 'touch', 'problems', 'faced', 'more', 'focus', 'differences', 'clothing', 'choices', 'bright', 'blue', 'dress', 'sea', 'black', 'suits', 'Then', 'back', 'slow', 'slide', 'dementia.The', 'important', 'historic', 'moments', 'Thatcher', 'life', 'are', 'touched', 'very', 'lightly', 'Incidents', 'Falkland', 'War', 'miner', 'strike', 'feel', 'are', 'mentioned', 'depth', 'Other', 'items', 'Iran', 'hostage', 'situation', 'are', 'ignored', 'completely', 'amount', 'story', 'involved', 'Thatcher', 'life', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'film', 'makers', 'here', 'decided', 'illness', 'seemed', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'life', 'instead', 'more', 'interesting', 'historical', 'moments', 'Then', 'again', 'when', 'thinking', 'Hollywood', 'depiction', 'Conservative', 'figures', 'recalled', 'attempt', 'make', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'look', 'senile', 'mentally', 'ill', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'Reagan', 'Thatcher', 'barely', 'touched', 'film.Streep', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', 'performance', 'here', 'am', 'loss', 'understand', 'why', 'exception', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'nominated', 'anything', 'days', 'saw', 'little', 'acting', 'here', 'more', 'impersonation', 'win', 'Oscar', 'then', 'Rich', 'Little', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'entire', 'shelf', 'lined', 'trophies', 'will', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Streep', 'fan', 'up', 'front', 'movie', 'did', 'little', 'change', 'mind.It', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'folks', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'take', 'historical', 'topic', 'present', 'facts', 'untarnished', 'own', 'viewpoints', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'were', 'bad', 'things', 'Thatcher', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'would', 'choose', 'present', 'sides', 'let', 'viewer', 'decide', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'movie', 'did', 'little', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'stayed', 'PM', '11', 'years', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'wonder', 'sanity', 'longer', 'watched.To', 'capture', 'entire', 'life', '105', 'minutes', 'difficult', 'best', 'present', 'accurately', 'fairly', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'may', 'watch', 'film', 'think', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'only', 'made', 'want', 'look', 'deeper', 'life', 'felt', 'more', 'fluff', 'biographical', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'presented', 'was', 'love', 'adoration', 'Thatcher', 'felt', 'husband', 'Even', 'story', 'revolving', 'solely', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 3]","Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production.  Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.The problem lies in its approach to the material.  The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher ,  having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

1451556,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B0059XTUVI,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[61, 81]","Margaret Thatcher is one of the towering historical figures of the 20th Century.  Despite humble origins, she rose to be the United Kingdom's first  female prime minister, and the longest serving prime minister of the 20th century. She took the reins of power in London at a time when the British economy had been decimated by decades of extremist Labor Party policies (anyone remember when Britain nationalized just about every possible industry driving the British automotive and motorcycle industries into the ground?).  Her policies brought the English economy from the depths of recession to dynamic growth. Arguably, she did as much as Ronald Reagan in leading the West to a bloodless victory in the Cold War. As a historical figure of such importance Margaret Thatcher deserves to be the subject of a great biographical film. The Iron Lady is not that film. In fact...Not only is The Iron Lady not a great movie, it's not even a particularly good movie.The Iron Lady seems to be very poorly structured. Not having read the book on which it's based I can't tell if the fault lies with the writing, the directing, or the source material. Here were have a movie about one of the most important historical movies of the 20th Century and at least 40 minutes of the movie seems to concentrate on Thatcher the elderly woman in the grips of dementia. We get to see her buying milk, going to the doctor, and hallucinating that her husband Dennis Thatcher is still alive. We get to see her finally clean out his closet and send all his clothes to Goodwill (or the British equivalent).  We get to see her daughter and staff worry about her and fuss over her. And this goes on and on.Watching this movie was an exercise in patience. I wanted to see a biopic that told the story of Margaret Roberts, the daughter of a humble shopkeeper who rose to be the most powerful female leader in the world. I wanted to see how she developed her political philosophy. I wanted to see how she dealt with crisis. But all these parts of her life were no more than touched on, and only then in flashbacks. Alexandra Roach did a great job playing the young Margaret Roberts, a shopkeeper's daughter who got accepted to Oxford University. I wanted to see a lot more of her. But every time that (or any) part of the story seemed to be getting interesting the flashback ended and the audience is taken back to modern day to watch a senile old woman argue with her dead husband. At another point one of her close friend is murdered by an IRA bomb, but do we get to see how she deals with this? No. Immediately the flashback ends and we're back to watching a senile old woman again. Every important moment depicted in the movies is presented the same way, as a short flashback, and totally out of context, that ends just as it's about to get interesting.The complete and utter failure of this movie may have a lot to do with the choice of Meryl Streep to play Thatcher. With such an A-list character actress as a leading lady, the director and writers structured the movie to highlight Streep's acting, not to highlight the life of the person Streep was portraying. That seems to be the only explanation for why we only got a see a couple moments of Alexandra Roach's wonderful portrayal of the young Margaret Roberts, and a tedious 40 plus minutes of Streep splaying a Thatcher as a senile old woman.All in all, The Iron Lady is a disappointing mediocre movie that fails as a biopic and fails as historical fiction. If you go in expecting a movie anywhere near as good as The King's Speech, you will be sorely disappointed.

Without them, it would deserve two at the most. Streep as usual is impeccable; her appearance, voice and mannerisms are so perfect that for long stretches of the movie you forget you're not watching the real Margaret Thatcher. Broadbent as Denis is playful and charmingly dotty; together, he and Streep make the most delightful British Odd Couple since Horace ahd Hilda Rumpole.Unfortunately, Abi Morgan's screenplay is misshapen and wrongheaded, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction lackadaisical. Under their guidance, ""The Iron Lady"" becomes mostly the story of the elderly, demented Margaret, living in a fantasy world with the image of her long-dead husband. The story of Margaret's political rise and triumph, in which she once again made Britain--for better or worse--a haven for imperialism and laissez-faire capitalism, is tacked on almost as an afterthought. Of course the political story is the only reason the life of Margaret Thatcher is of any interest, but ironically it's the pitiful story of the elderly, fading Thatcher that holds our interest, strictly because of Streep and Broadbent.

It starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.  I'd seen the movie before but watched several minutes out of comparative curiosity.

The woman is remarkable which is also the correct adjective for her role as British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  If not for her performance this film can easily be overlooked and would feel right at home on basic cable.While Thatcher's rise to power as the first woman prime minister is quite an accomplishment, it doesn't seem to be terribly interesting.  One of the problems is that the meat of her career doesn't begin until she's in her 20's.  There isn't much about her childhood.  All of this comes as the aging, depressed woman teeters on the edge of dementia.  It is those uncomfortable moments we get too much of.

I well remember Mrs. Thatcher's inner strength and backbone. She was the only politician in the Conservative Party that could have carried it at that time. Whatever one thought of her politics, she was the right person for the job. This was the upwardly mobile yuppy generation. She built these concepts. Everyone was out for themselves, and didn't care about anyone else.Now I come to the acting. Meryl Streep is nothing short of brilliant in this role.  To all the so called actresses out there that are more concerned with being celebrities, this is what true acting is about. Ms. Streep makes us forget that she is Meryl Streep. We only see Mrs. Thatcher on the screen. She completely becomes Mrs. Thatcher in everything, including the very convincing British accent (and I am British).Now to the weaknesses of the film. I understand that Mrs. Thatcher is now suffering from dementia. I felt that the film played the dementia angle far too much.  I would have been comfortable with one or two references to Dennis showing up in her bedroom or living room, but he was constantly there, and that became tedious after a while. Regardless of one's politics, a film like this should be about the things that she achieved and did, and not focus so much on her current illness. I understand what the director was trying to do. It is difficult to do well in a short time and that produces areas of weakness in an otherwise wonderful film.Well done Mrs. Streep.

As for Meryl Streep, she gives a fine perfomance that is hampered by the final cut.  Did she deserve an Oscar nomination, maybe.  Did she deserve to win, definitely not.  As for the make-up, as young Margaret, Meryl looks nothing like her.  She is too beautiful.  I guess vanity would not let her be made down to look like an average woman.  But the old age make-up is fantastic.  Unfortunately, between the two, the old age is easier to accomplish and therefore less important.The worst part of the film, is that it never trusts itself.

1451583,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0059XTUVI,Paul Allaer,"[8, 11]","Movie: 1.5 stars; Meryl Streep performance: 5 stars""The Iron Lady"" (105 min.) could've/should've been the definitive bio-pic of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's Prime Minister between 1979 and 1991. Instead what we have here is a terrible mess with some great acting. Where to begin? For one, far too much of the movie is devoted to the latter-day's frail Thatcher, in which she believes her husband Dennis is somehow still alive and she cannot get in her mind that her son Mark now lives in South Africa. Why screenwriter Abi Morgan felt compelled to go into this direction, I simply cannot understand. As to the true historical parts of the movie, they are way too fragmented and, crucially, fail to set the proper context so that the viewers can truly grasp their proper historical importance. It felt like watching a reel of highlights, instead of watching a bio-pic of Thatcher's political career. Most damagingly, the plot simply skips on providing insights how certainly key moments came about. As just an example, at a certain point Thatcher decides that she's going to throw her name in the ring to become the next Tories party leader, while all the while we are reminded that it would be highly unlikely for her to succeed. Next thing we watch are the 1979 election results and Thatcher is now PM. Whoa!?! What happened in the party leader challenge? How did Thatcher pull that off? We are left guessing.Against this background it is truly sad to see the grandiose performance give by Meryl Streep go completely to waste. I don't know that Streep has given a better performance than this one, and surely she will win her third Best Actress Oscar for this. Can you imagine what a stellar movie this could've been had the screenplay made more sense? Instead we are left with this beautifull mess. What a missed opportunity. As a complete aside, I saw 2 movies this weekend and they were both written by Abi Morgan--the other movie being ""Shame"" of course.

She has visions of and converses with her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).  Her past life is shown through a series of flashbacks.  The film spends too much time in the present showing her as a frail old woman fighting the demons in her mind then focusing on the potential powerful situations of her being the first woman to lead a country in the Western world. Mr. Broadbent plays his character like a complete loon and you can't understand why someone like that would haunt her mind. That being said, Ms. Streep inhabits the character and transforms herself into Margaret Thatcher completely.

Having seen her in many roles, this was not surprising--she's widely regarded as one of the greatest living actresses--but her transformation here into an elderly woman, including the accent, the makeup, the attitudes and personality, is nothing short of astonishing.  Thatcher's very conservative politics and abrasive manner are of course very controversial--and this portrayal of them is very timely.  To be sure, if you're very sympathetic to Thatcher's politics, you may find this portrayal of her unsympathetic or even offensive; some clearly have. But regardless of the viewer's politics, I can't imagine anyone watching this and not feeling he or she has seen something remarkable.The story of Thatcher's life is told through a series of flashbacks experienced by the woman long after she left office as the British prime minister with the longest tenure of the 20th century, and its first woman PM.  We see how she entered politics, met her husband, rose to power, earned the Iron Lady nickname, and was pushed from office by her own party.  For those unfamiliar with her life and politics, it's educational, at least superficially.  An attempt is made to deviate from the straightforward biopic format by having Thatcher's mind failing during her old age, resulting in hallucinations about her deceased husband punctuating the film.  This device is effective, but still, this is not a great film. It's a not-quite-conventional movie about the life of one historical figure, made interesting primarily by Streep's stunning ability to inhabit her subject, and thereby not only cause us to appreciate Streep's art, but also feel at least a little compassion for an aging woman no longer in power.",4,Astonishing Performance,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,1862,"['saw', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'right', 'was', 'widely', 'released', 'felt', 'expectations', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'incredible', 'were', 'fully', 'justified', 'Having', 'seen', 'many', 'roles', 'was', 'not', 'surprising', 'widely', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'living', 'actresses', 'transformation', 'here', 'elderly', 'woman', 'including', 'accent', 'makeup', 'attitudes', 'personality', 'nothing', 'short', 'astonishing', 'Thatcher', 'very', 'conservative', 'politics', 'abrasive', 'manner', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'controversial', 'portrayal', 'very', 'timely', 'be', 'sure', ""'re"", 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Thatcher', 'politics', 'may', 'find', 'portrayal', 'unsympathetic', 'even', 'offensive', 'clearly', 'have', 'regardless', 'viewer', 'politics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'watching', 'not', 'feeling', 'seen', 'something', 'remarkable.The', 'story', 'Thatcher', 'life', 'told', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'experienced', 'woman', 'long', 'left', 'office', 'British', 'prime', 'minister', 'longest', 'tenure', '20th', 'century', 'first', 'woman', 'PM', 'see', 'how', 'entered', 'politics', 'met', 'husband', 'rose', 'power', 'earned', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'nickname', 'was', 'pushed', 'office', 'own', 'party', 'unfamiliar', 'life', 'politics', 'educational', 'least', 'superficially', 'attempt', 'made', 'deviate', 'straightforward', 'biopic', 'format', 'having', 'Thatcher', 'mind', 'failing', 'old', 'age', 'resulting', 'hallucinations', 'deceased', 'husband', 'punctuating', 'film', 'device', 'effective', 'still', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'not-quite-conventional', 'movie', 'life', 'one', 'historical', 'figure', 'made', 'interesting', 'primarily', 'Streep', 'stunning', 'ability', 'inhabit', 'subject', 'thereby', 'not', 'only', 'cause', 'appreciate', 'Streep', 'art', 'also', 'feel', 'least', 'little', 'compassion', 'aging', 'woman', 'no', 'longer', 'power']",N/A

The story is told in flashbacks and as we are told in terms of a demented, Margaret Thatcher. Not the best way to portray a woman of such substance. It is intimated that her son, Mark, was not and has not been a big part of her life. It was also intimated that Margaret Thatcher was not a big part of her children's lives. Not much was explained, it is all a perception. Much of what Margaret Thatcher went through as part of the House of Commons was also our perception.

I hadn't read any reviews first because I didn't want to taint the experience and well, it does star Meryl Streep and she is playing Margaret Thatcher so enough said!What I can say without reservation is that Meryl Streep gave an outstanding performance. She played Margaret Thatcher in her prime and also in her declining years. In both cases, she had Thatcher's voice and mannerisms down pat. I believed she was Thatcher.What I regretted about this movie was the script which centered around Thatcher in declining health, at times hallucinating and reflecting on her life and career at which point we relive them as well. We saw the influence her early family life had on her future in conservative politics. Also shown were her early forays into politics and then on toward being Prime Minister. What was annoying to me was that the film had us all too frequently go back to Thatcher in old age, rather than spend more time on Thatcher as Prime Minister.  Granted the film did depict some of the strife with the IRA, the effects in England of not negotiating with the labour unions and the Falklands War but they seemed all too fleeting.During Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister, countries were economically and politically repositioning themselves re globalization and the end of the Cold War. Thatcher was also continuing England's special relationship with the United States via Ronald Reagan with whom she was politically in synch. In the film, if old-age Thatcher were to reflect, we should have gone back and relived those times and stayed there until she reached the old age Thatcher as she was reading the headlines of today or something along those lines.This movie must be seen for Meryl Streep's performance for which there are not enough superlatives.

She is like a chameleon; she total disappears into each role she plays, leaving none of her own personality. Just as she vanished into Julia Child and a severe nun, etc, she completely vanishes into Margret Thatcher. So much so that after the movie, I went to the web to remind myself what the real Maggie Thatcher looked like. She looks, sounds and affects the same attitudes even the same hair styles as Maggie! Even her voice has Thatcher sound to it, gestures mannerisms. So astounding you will forget who you are watching.""The Iron Lady"" is surrounded by ghosts. Streep plays her in snapshots from various parts of her life, but mostly the current Maggie, who, if we believe the plot, suffers from dementia. Current Maggie has long conversations with her husband, Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), husband who died in 2003, or his ghost, who she sees but no one else does. She is reluctant to clean out his closet and throw away his clothes even though he has been dead for nearly a decade. He might need them.We are also shown the Maggie who lead England to war to get back the stolen Falkland Islands, facing striking labour unions, the Maggie who cut government services to lower taxes (mostly to help the rich, critics say). Maggie says ""in the past, people in the country used to `do' things, now they just want to talk about their `feelings'"", or words to that effect. She later repeats this.This movie not only shows Maggie as terrifying with little sympathy for the people her policies might hurt, but also a great warrior and ultimately pitiable old figure.The best actress of 2011. the only reason Streep might not win is she has won so many other times.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[0, 0]","Meryl Streep portrays the leading role of one of the most well known politicians of the most pivotal periods in history, the Cold War.  ""Iron Lady"" is a moving picture of England's most influential and at times controversial leaders Margaret Thatcher who fittingly inherits the name of being an ""iron lady"" with a domineering female presence amidst an environment of male counterparts.  The film depicts her rise as a young politician that weaves within a collage of memories of her personal and professional life.The movie is somewhat of a love play of Thatcher's career but most of all her love for her husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent) and family, especially her daughter Carole (Olivia Colman) and though not shown within the film except in flashbacks her absent son Matthew.  During the opening scenes of the film, one must orient one's self with what exactly is happening in the kitchen between Thatcher and her husband.  This is a moment in Thatcher's life as well as one of the focal points of the storyline of the film depicting her twilight years.  Director Phylla Lord and Writer Abi Morgan do a good job interplaying the film's storylines of the life of Margaret Thatcher.  There are moments in the film that may take time to understand amidst the history that most know of Thatcher during the Reagan Years and her personal life that only now, unless one has followed every point of her life, the film sheds a light upon.  While watching the film, viewers may think of other biopics that take an extremely intimate approach towards showing the humanistic aspects of almost larger than life figures.  There are qualities of the film that bears similarities to the film ""Iris"" or ""The King's Speech,"" each depicting notable figures in English history.But what one may come out of watching the film despite parallels with other biopics, it is an interesting movie that takes an unpredictable approach to delving into the life of a woman that made an enormous impact to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.

She deserved the Oscar she won for the performance; but I still believe Viola Davis deserved it more; mainly because of the impact and the quality of the two films...&#34;The Help&#34; is an outstanding film...this one sadly is not. Margaret Thatcher was truly a great British statesman; the first and only female Prime Minister and the longest reigning. She took Great Britain from the depths of socialism and near bankruptcy to once more being an economic power. She took the country from mediocrity as a world power to a power to be reckoned with...along with Ronald Reagan, she brokered a bloodless end to the Cold War. Bottom line, she is probably the greatest woman of the 20th Century. This biopic does not portray that greatness, spending entirely too much time and too many scenes depicting the long retired, sickly, old lady w/dementia. Perhaps the producers and writers were reluctant to show a conservative statesman in a good light; but for whatever reason, the real Margaret Thatcher does not receive the treatment she deserves in this film. The four stars are for Streep's performance and to a lesser degree Jim Broadbent, who plays Thatcher's husband, Denis...seen only as a hallucination by the demented Thatcher.

1451604,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,B0059XTUVI,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[0, 0]","Meryl Streep certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her characterization of PM Thatcher.  I certainly feel as if I am watching the real Maggie herself from youth to death.  Some found the film's dwelling on her decline distateful; but I thought it a fine approach in summing the peaks and twists of her career into its final descent.  Alexandra Roach as young Margaret Roberts/Thatcher also gave a strong performance which has gone unappreciated - as to be expected - under all the Streep hype.Aesthetics aside, the film is a meandering snapshot of a woman you either loved or hated.  The writers and producer are thus caught in this ambivalence: to respect the woman, and her commitment to her ideals, while apparently not caring for the specifics of said ideals.  However, in my view there really wasn't much appeal in the woman herself.  An envying, ambitious ""upstart"" who predictably aged into a bitter harridan as she settled into power, the real Maggie seemed haunted by her common past as she envied the ""successful""; bitterly resenting the fellow commoners who ""held her back"" from her (and therefore Britain's) ""greatness.""  Smashing the British trade unions so Brit Yuppies could squander millions in drunken partying was her lasting and quite unenviable legacy.Laying waste to British democracy was, in the end, not enough to bring her downfall.  Only when she turned on her own Tory Politburo did the British Establishment finally, at long last, cry Enough.  The lesson of Thatcher's career is to beware the ambitious politicians who are compared - or compare themselves - to ferrous matter: A Man of Steel (Stalin) or an Iron Lady do not create structures of state and society without much waste and carnage in their wake.  The film makers are ambivalent about her legacy because she did, after all, ""stand for the West.""

But over the course of the movie I began to empathizes with her. I am glad I stuck with it.Great leadership points here. She was never one to form a coalition. It is interesting to see her stick to her guns in all situations. She was very black and white. My theory with women in power is that they are more principled and more likely to be a hard liner because they have a safety net. Married women can always return home. In her case she had a supportive husband at home. Men dont have that option. Chauvinist sure but true.

Critics and amateur reviewers alike seem to agree that the execution of the material is decidedly lukewarm. The comments of the major critics such as Roger Ebert and A O Scott of the New York Times seem to agree quite well with amateur reviewers on Amazon where the reviews are almost evenly split between ratings of one through five.The film depicts Ms Thatcher's life and career from the time before her marriage through the middle of the last decade after her husband's death and after she had developed what appears to be Alzheimer's disease.  Much of the film depicts imaginary moments and conversations with her late husband. She is attempting to discard his clothing and genuinely seems to want to let him go at times; but at times he is still living to her even though she is reminded constantly by her daughter that he is not.The story is told through a series of flashbacks. Since the film chronicles such a long period of time, the viewer is often left wishing he or she had learned more about many of the pivotal events of Ms Thatcher's life and career ... things that may have better explained her extreme and often controversial conservatism. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the film does indeed illuminate much of what I personally did not know about Ms Thatcher.The bright spot of the film is, of course, the performance by Meryl Streep . She delivers another stellar portrayal of a character not at all like herself. As in most of Ms Streep's films, you stop seeing Ms Streep early on and see the character that she is playing. This is particularly true of this film since as an older Margaret, Ms Streep looks nothing like herself. What a grand actress she is! For me she is the epitome.As I post my review on Amazon, I will give this film a rating of three stars; but that is only because it's the middle point of the rating scale.

But I think the way it was done, it worked, and I don't think too much was made of it. It was a unique way to tell the story of her life both internally, in terms of her deep love for her husband, and externally, where she didn't show her feelings.  I don't know if the ""iron"" lady is an appropriate analogy for Thatcher. Iron tends to mean strength to me, and I don't see strength in someone who is rigid, unyielding, and convinced she is right about everything.  Thatcher considered those who disagreed with her politics ""too cowardly"" to do what she believed must be done, and that is just massive invalidation of the opinions and expertise of others.  The movie is timely in that it shows the results of following the kind of political philosophy Thatcher shared with her friend Ronald Reagan and that is being advocated, though in more extreme form, by Romney and the Tea Party GOP these days. It shows what happens when you impose such politics on a country - the people rebel and Thatcher became the most hated prime minister of all time.  She would have been thrown out of office had she not had the sense to resign, although she was never able to be open to the positions of others. As offensive and poor-equipped to lead as she turned out to be, the sequences that show her hallucinating her husband's presence serve to bring out the vulnerable humanity in her, and far from being too much of an excursion into her mental instability, are what makes this a really great movie to watch.  The only thing that was missing, and a very big omission in my opinion, was to see what the response of the Royal Family was to Thatcher and her politics and to have some response from them.

Let's make a movie about Margaret Thatcher.SE 2:  You know, considering she was the first woman Prime Minister and all that, personally I find her kind of dull.SE1:  Maybe Meryl Streep would be up to the challenge of making her interesting.SE2:  OK.I really don't have any separate knowledge of Margaret Thatcher's personality, but this movie does not cast her in a flattering light.  She is driven to serve. She faces the obstacle of being a woman in a man's world.  In the process she has a couple of kids who seem to live their lives quite independently of Mummy's presence, and she doesn't make a lot of friends.  She has a fulfilling marriage.  Her husband dies.  She descends into dementia.The movie is basically told through the filter of Thatcher's elderly confusion, as she remembers the major events in her life.  Jim Broadbent as Denis Thatcher does a very good job of drifting in and out of scenes, since he is essentially a ghost for most of the movie.  He plays Denis as quirky, funny, supportive, an excellent counterpoint to Margaret's stiff upper lip.  He was really the only appealing character in the film, to my mind.I love how Meryl Streep transforms herself in her movies.  In this one, I barely recognized her.  Perhaps she was so consumed by this character that she lost the spark that makes her performances so fascinating.  She has a marvelous subtlety but there is usually a fire underneath.  Maybe the stoic British reserve put out the fire in this case.  Clearly the Academy voters saw something in her performance that I did not, or maybe it was just time to give Meryl another Oscar.  Personally, I can think of several recent performances that were more deserving.The choice of perspective in this film puzzles me.

This is not because the film is overall bad per se, but because the good parts (which shined) are so intermittent. There's no structure, no through-line, just an older MT hallucinating, stumbling around, listening to old records, then quick cuts to too-short sequences of her growing up, having a family, waltzing her way to positions of enormous power, bullying around her cabinet and foreign heads of state, and dealing with the risks of her economic policies. With a bit less present and a ton more past, the movie would be a formidable work of art, for these sequences are nuanced (if underwritten), and, if gone into in more detail, could have been fascnating explorations of how Thatcher the person reconciled being Thatcher the leader.Meryl Streep, however, is flawless, easily giving the year's best performance and fully deserving of her Oscar. She goes from wide-eyed optimist to strong-jawed leader to querolous octegenarian with consistent skill. About an hour and a half in the movie she gives her cabinet a power-drunk string of rebukes before realizing the consequences of her outbursts, and the sequence is a master class of emotion and subtlety. She is also wholly believable in the film's older scenes, and does not rely on the (excellent) makeup to transmit MT's loneliness and fading grasp on reality. I really cannot praise her enough.But too much potential is squandered here. Her achievements, and the enormity of her successes, aren't explored. The scene's during Thatcher's rule are too myopic to develop greater themes about how she feels about the changes in her power, and are instead only about how she felt at that moment. By the film's end, the only new thing you learn about her is that her husband was kind of goofy.

Since the real Denis went out of his way to stay in the background and is no longer among the living, no one, including Broadbent, knows how close, if at all, his version matches the original. The pair of young actors in the roles of young Margaret and young Denis are entirely believable as younger versions of Streep & Broadbent. The powerful all-male power broker roles were powerfully well played by actors whose names may escape you but whose faces you know well...possibly from Masterpiece Theater.How about this for a double feature:  Pair ""The Iron Lady""  with ""Brassed Off,"" the Pete Posthelwaite/Ewan McGregor movie about the impact of Thatcher's coal mine closures on a mining town, its miners and their marvelous brass band.",4,"I'm far from a Thatcher fan.

That in it's self is not necessarily a bad thing, the reason that this is a bad movie is because what it is isn't very good. This is perhaps the least focused, least interesting biopic in a great many years. Considering it's fascinating subject, weather you agree politically or not, you've got to admit Marget Thatcher is an interesting woman and historical figure. What we get instead is a banal Lifetimeish movie of the week, a tear jerker, if you will, that no one cries over.""The Iron Lady"" gives no insight into Mrs. Thatcher, little or no historical references, little in way of her personal life. Instead, the film seems focused on her weening years as she enters dementia and caries on conversations with her deceased husband. The unfocused script barely touched on issues of politics, how her gender affected her place in parliament or much of her personal sacrifices, that she must have made when ascending to the highest office in the land. This is the kind of vague biography where the subject is kept continuously at arms length. I have read that those who support this movie claim that it is well made, I disagree, it may look professionally made, but the film is undermined by flashbacks, edits and montages that keep the viewer disorientated.Much has been said of Meryl Streep's performance as Mrs. Thatcher, well it is interesting and it is good, but not in the way most think it is. There is so little insight into Thatcher's personality and no emotional depth, that Streep is left to do little more than mimic her voice, her mannerisams, and thanks to a fine make-up specialist, her appearance. This isn't a performance so much, as an impersonation, a good one indeed, but an impersonation no less. Was Streep worth of the Best Actress Oscar? I don't really think so, an Academy Award should be seen as a standard of excellence, but in all facets of life mistakes are made, and the academy has made more than their fair share over the years.""The Iron Lady"" was directed by Phyllida Lloyd, from a screenplay by Abi Morgan, who is a highly respected theatre director, her previous film was ""Mama Mia!"". I have read that miss Lloyd believes Thatcher to have been the most important woman in politics since Elizabeth 1.

Unless the point of the movie was to show the ravages of Alzheimer's or dementia - and it wasn't - there's little excuse for such a cold blooded production, regardless of how you feel about her and her political record. For God's sake, I've seen Hitler given more compassionate treatment.I kept waiting for it to settle into a continual story of her rise and career, but just when it got going; we were back to her home and her stumbling incoherence.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 4]","Read all the reviews of this film (there are 127 here already on Amazon - focusing on the film as shown in theaters. ALL of them focus on Meryl Streep and here Oscar-winning performance. I have to agree that she is an amazing actress and really inhabits the character of Margaret Thatcher in this film. But the production as a whole seems to last for three hours when, in fact, it is only 105 minutes. The reason is the concept used by Director Phyllidia Lloyd that has the time frame jumping back and forth (AND back and forth, and...) between Thatcher in her final days and at various points in her career. There is the conceit that has her late husband (and childhood sweetheart) Denis, appearing in her mind (and on screen) to converse with her, long after he has died. Personally I was getting a headache with all this time shifting. So, as a film, this only gets three stars from me.The Blu-Ray DVD - and I think the standard DVD - has a large group of special features, though many are short and one is really odd. They consist of:Making the Iron Lady - 12 minutes - the standard ""making of"" featurette with the cast and crew making comments among scenes repeated from the film.Recreating the young Margaret Thatcher - 3 minutesDenis, The Man Behind the woman - 2  minutes - focusing on Jim Broadbent's characterBattle in the House of Commons -2  minutes - mostly comments by the Director (and some repeats section from the ""Making of"" oneCostume Design: Pearls and Power Suits - 2  minutes - comments from the costume designer and DirectorAnd the odd one: an 18-minute ""featurette"" on Historical film bios, that - while interesting - is a promo piece for other recent DVDs of Weinstein Company produced films. We learn about Marilyn Monroe (from film historian Drew Casper and actress Michelle Williams), Wallis Simpson (the film W.E. where we hear from a professor and the film's director Madonna) , The Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget. It seems to have been edited from a longer piece because there is a narrator but no title or credit.So, if you want to see a great actress inhabit a role, this is the film. But if you want to learn a lot about British history during Thatcher's career, I'm afraid this is not the best place to find that.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,It's all about Meryl!

Astounding liberties are taken with the ordering of the historical record, and despite some fine moments (the first meeting with the public image consultant stands out, and the final scene) the script's dialogue consistently fails to rise to the challenge of convincingly conveying the ideological texture and trajectory of the times. I don't think any 16 year-old could watch this and leave the cinema feeling truly enlightened about the achievements brought about in the 1980s by Mrs Thatcher's ideas and personality, other than a vague memory that Thatcher was a strong woman. Because of this key failure in the script, the movie has to fall back on confusing jumbles of over-strident music and aggressive TV news footage to try to convey the mood. It simply fails in this, often painfully so. Having recently re-read Mrs Thatcher's two autobiographies, I felt the film failed very badly in conveying her core philosophy. The scene where she challenges Al Haig is a good example in this - it comes across as very weak tea, if you've heard the powerful and convincing way it's dealt with in _The Falklands Play_. At other times the film becomes, frankly, a little boring. It's perhaps visually that the film is most excellent, with very strong costuming and hair, set off with excellent lighting. But that's just not enough to make a great film. Despite all the polish and the fine performance from Streep, and workmanlike performance from Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, _The Iron Lady_ really can't compare to other depictions. I'm thinking here of the excellence of the radio version of _The Falklands Play_ (in terms of the power of the dialogue to fuse ideas and drama), or _The Long Walk to Finchley_ (in terms of conveying the complex combination of human personality and political ideals).

1451646,ANUUF3N6B9NTA,B0059XTUVI,Tabitha,"[0, 0]","This was an extremely well directed and well done film.  It wasn't your typical boring cinema-bio.  Meryl nails the accent in a subtle, gentle, classy, and dignified manner. Loved the historical references and historic events that shaped Great Britain.Initially, Thatcher's husband, Dennis, was obviously an extremely confident man who certainly didn't feel threatened by his wife's brilliance and spunk. He appeared to revel in it.Love these lines from the movie--Margaret Thatcher:  ""Ones life must matter.  Ones life must mean more than that.  People don't think anymore.  They only have feelings.  What we think we become.""For all her errors, this woman was awesome.  The longest serving Priminister (president) in history.  She made history.  Just shows how history can be tainted by the phallic political agenda.  Thatcher's legacy should be studied in American history classes and universities.Thatcher certainly held her own and stood firm in a career inflated by much testosterone driven ego--parliament.  She appeared to speak for the common woman and man, i.e., jobs, unions, IRA bombings, unemployment, economic health, industrialism, economics, assassination attempts.  Her country appeared to be at war with itself.What an awesome speech, ""It's time to put the great back in Great Britain.""I loved the scene when her assistant drapes her in a classic set of double strand 8-9 mm white pearls--what a lady.  I have always hated those Texas-size and country Barbara Bush pearls.  We may have won the war but it took us centuries to catch up with the Brits...a female president (priminister).Love this line--Margaret Thatcher:  ""It used to be about doing something.  Now it's about being something.""  This reminds me of a proverb written by Solomon, ""Everything is vanity...""This was a fascinating portrayal of Thatcher's life.Who said a woman cannot be a warrior.

The flashback style is done for the purpose of showing us how events in someone's past effected their later decisions. Seeing the retired senile Margaret Thatcher was really unnecessary to this film. Can you imagine a Reagan biography starting out with a senile Reagan not knowing he is no longer president and talking to dead people? Unfortunately the senility scenes are needed so we can get to know the character of Marget Thatcher because the main biography part is poorly done with an over abundance of ""red meat"" sound bites.To make matters worse, the film then employs this technique during the flashback so there is a flashback within the flashback.I liked the young Margaret Roberts (Alexandra Roach) growing up in a man's world where the expectations of women were to stay out of business and politics. Her bucking the system was inspirational and it would have been a better film had we seen more of this and less of Margaret thinking her husband was still alive.The meat of the film picks up when she is the Education Secretary of the conservative party. England is facing a union strike crippling the nation. Marget doesn't like her party's leadership and decides to run for the leader of the Conservative Party. She correctly places herself in the hands of professions who tweak her for national appeal, including working on her shrill voice...but she keeps the pearls.The movie relates to today. England was in a recession and people couldn't pay their mortgage. Margret wanted to cut government spending in the midst of a recession contrary to everyone else, including her own party who worries about re-election. I expected to see a ""Paid for by Ron Paul"" after that speech.For me, the film becomes watchable when Thatcher has to weigh her decision to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Streep gives us some wonderful performances. But when I see Matthew Marsh miscast as Alexander Haig, I have to ask, ""What were they thinking?""I went into this film thinking ""5 stars"" but reality set in as they killed this film on the editing floor. Horrifically edited and badly written. Whose idea was it really to have Streep walk around in an old house coat with messed up hair looking acting like Edith Bunker? The scenes of Streep moving through a crowd of faces, speaking her thoughts was another idea that failed. The soundtrack during the file footage scenes was terrible.

1451654,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0059XTUVI,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 3]","""The Iron Lady""  is the story of the political rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) from her modest early years as a clerk in her parents' grocery shop to prime minister of Great Britain.  As with many screen biographies, the movie touches on career high points and, in the interest of maintaining a reasonable running time, either encapsulates or sidesteps the rest.The story unfolds from the present day as Thatcher recalls episodes from her past, with Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, and her often tempestuous tenure as prime minister, the film's most interesting.  We see Thatcher's rise to prominence in Parliament even as she is ridiculed as both a woman and a newcomer who dares to challenge seasoned members of that body.  She seeks the advice of image shapers who suggest ways to command the respect of her peers and their serious attention.  These include a new hairdo, a deeper speaking voice, and the abandonment of hats.Traditional make-up, hair styling, prosthetics, and contact lenses contribute to an often uncanny likeness between star and real-life stateswoman.Streep's performance is extraordinary and won her her third Oscar.  However, the film itself is kind of old-fashioned in its depiction of Thatcher as stalwart world leader.  We see her triumphs and her modest beginnings, yet there is a sense that we've never really gotten insight into the woman.Blu-ray extras include a making-of documentary and featurettes on Thatcher's husband, Denis; the film's costume design; Thatcher's battle in the House of Commons; and transforming Streep into Margaret Thatcher.

1451656,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0059XTUVI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 8]","This first paragraph will be filled with statements you either already know or should already know. Meryl Streep is a great actress. The plethora and diversity of the roles she has done is testament to this. And she has an uncanny, chameleon-like ability to adopt, use and make accents work for her character. Because of her ability to create such believable, indelible, interesting characters, she frequently appears in films that are not as memorable as her performance. None of this should come as news to you. And all of this is applicable to ""The Iron Lady"", the new biopic about Margaret Thatcher.Beginning in ""Current Day"", Thatcher (Streep) ambles down the street, oblivious to most, and wanders into a shop to buy a pint of milk. She is unrecognized, ignored and shocked by the behavior of the people in the shop. Returning home, Denis (Jim Broadbent), her husband, spreads too much butter on his toast earning a chiding remark from his wife. Then, he realizes her assistants are in a tizzy, speaking in whispered tones. Why and how did Lady Thatcher get out and wander around alone? Denis playfully chastises her. An assistant asks her is she is ready to begin sorting through Denis' old clothes, to decide what to donate to charity, which pieces to pass on, which pieces of clothing should just be thrown away. Yes, Denis is gone. She realizes she is a little confused and remembers back to World War II and the Blitz.Written by Abi Morgan (""Shame"") and directed by Phyllida Lloyd (""Mamma Mia!""),  ""The Iron Lady"" suffers from the same narrative problems as the previous collaboration between the star and the director.Frankly, I was surprised by how much of ""Lady"" is set in present day. It is interesting to watch Thatcher as she deals with old age, memories haunting and confusing her. Her daughter, Carol (Olivia Colman) shows up and helps her prepare for a dinner party. As she helps her mother get dressed, the television shows a news story about a bombing in Afghanistan. This prompts a memory flash to a similar event early in her political career and helps to set-up the narrative style of the film.It is fascinating to watch Streep play Thatcher, especially at this stage in her life. In the first scene, as she ambles down the street, it isn't immediately obvious we are watching the former Prime Minister. She looks like any typical old woman, scarf covering her hair, stoop in her back. When we realize it is Thatcher, we immediately feel some regret, some pity. How did one of the most powerful women in history come to this?Streep makes Thatcher's age, mental fragility, confusion and dread a palpable thing. As she watches the story about the bombing on television, she immediately slips into Prime Minister mode and begins addressing the public. Her daughter and assistant watch with concern on their faces.Because the film concentrates so much time on Thatcher in her later life, the filmmakers use memories as jumping points to illustrate other parts of her life. This is hardly a modern, innovative or even an engaging method of depicting a person's life story - it's been done thousands, millions of times before - but the simplicity does allow us to concentrate on the characters and story.But ""Lady"" has two things working against it: The overdone narrative device and director Phyllida Law.While the narrative device is simplistic and allows us to concentrate on the characters, it is not modern in any way and makes the film seem old-fashioned. Old-fashioned is not an adjective most filmmakers would want used to describe their film. And because the subject matter is basically a senior citizen, the old-fashioned nature of the narrative only seems amplified.Law comes from a background of theater, opera and music videos. Her first big film ""Mamma Mia!"" an adaptation of the popular musical is good, but the cheap production values and penchant to use music video techniques to illustrate narrative, really bring the overall quality down. I get it. Law has experience with music videos and feels comfortable using this technique. But it doesn't mesh with the ""musical"" narrative of the rest of the film.In ""Lady"", Thatcher remembering back to key moments in her life and career almost creates a narrative ""promise"" that these flashbacks will provide us with the backstory, the narrative we need and desire to get a more complete picture of the politician's life. A flashback leads to how Margaret and Denis meet. Another flashes back to when they decide to marry. But there is nothing between the two and their marriage is portrayed as a transaction. She loses her first campaign for Parliament and Denis convinces her that a married woman would stand a better chance. If this is in fact true, it doesn't paint a very romantic picture. If it isn't, what are we supposed to pick up from this? We don't get enough details or information to fill in the gaps or make other connections. Only when we watch Margaret and Denis late in their life do we realize that they are now very much in love.Later, flashbacks lead to a scene of Margaret trying to make an impact in Parliament. Then, another scene shows two of her fellow Conservative Party members giving her coaching, grooming her (somewhat literally) to become the party leader and the PM. A flashback triggers a memory of an IRA attack that kills one of her advisors. Then, she is Prime Minister. Then, things aren't go going especially well. Then, she goes to war in the Falkland Islands. The war goes poorly until the British are victorious and everything turns around for Margaret and the Conservatives and they ride a wave of popularity.These moments seem almost secondary. If my description of the narrative seems a bit choppy, a bit like an outline, this is an accurate reflection of the film. As Thatcher becomes extremely popular, she is shown dancing with Reagan and Nelson Mandela. This is virtually the only mention of Reagan and does nothing to illustrate their relationship. In fact, the entire sequence, as Thatcher and her party enjoy their power and popularity is basically a montage, a music video, which fails to illustrate anything of value.At one point, Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) begins to appear constantly at Thatcher's side. Later, she berates him and he turns in his resignation. We don't learn what their relationship is or why this is an important development.The same problem plagues the character played by Richard E. Grant. At one point, someone makes a comment about Thatcher losing support and she turns and spots Michael Heseltine (Grant) looking at her suspiciously. Why are people jockeying to replace her? Who is Heseltine? Why does he want to replace the popular PM? Is she even still popular? Unfortunately, the film doesn't help us with these questions.Broadbent and Streep work well together and they paint a portrait of a couple who have been together a long time, remembering and laughing at all of the silly memories they share. It is a good portrait of an older couple.But we don't really learn how they get to this point. There is one brief scene showing Denis and Carol's amazement when Thatcher announces she is running to be Prime Minister. Initially, he seems very upset, but just as quickly seems fully supportive.There also seems to be a lot of animosity between Carol and her mother, but we don't really learn why this exists.Law seems convinced that we must know these things and this is a dangerous conceit to adopt when making a biopic. Most successful biopics concentrate on a specific period of the subject's life. By doing this, they are able to illuminate these moments and build what we hope is a memorable portrait. And most biopics are more than two hours long. ""Iron Lady"" runs 105 minutes and presents snippets from throughout the Prime Minister's life. Because of this, it feels like we are watching a study cheat sheet come to life. Key moments, important facts and interesting details are missing throughout.""The Iron Lady"" features another great performance from Streep, which is not served well by a haphazard screenplay, incomplete ideas and choppy filmmaking.",3,"Streep's Performance Is Great, But...",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,8121,"['first', 'paragraph', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'statements', 'either', 'already',

Growing up in the 80's I remember quite a bit about Thatcher and was hoping to see stuff that I knew already and events to help me fill in the gaps of things I didn't. While this is a good movie overall I was very disappointed. The movie pretty much deals with how she handles her husbands death with bits of flashbacks thrown in. It does cover a fair amount of her time as leader but really only covers how she decided to run, trying to get back the Faulking Islands and her resignation. I was surprised there wasn't more Cold War events as well as her dealings with Reagan. I will admit that Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie and did deserve the Oscar, but I am glad the movie wasn't up for best picture. Even for a history buff like me this was a little boring.

1451665,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0059XTUVI,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***No matter how good an actor's performance is (and in this case, Meryl Streep's performance is excellent), if the script is weak, the movie as a whole, cannot work. And that's what's happened with 'The Iron Lady'. Director Phyllida Lloyd and Screenwriter Abi Morgan want it both ways. On one hand, they have a great reverence for Margaret Thatcher as a feminist pioneer who became Britian's first female prime minister. On the other hand, being liberals, they've got to be uncomfortable with Thatcher's conservative political stance (to many liberals, in her heyday, Thatcher was viewed as a modern day 'Marie Antoinette').On the surface, Lloyd and Morgan have produced a fairly standard biopic--a hagiography of sorts, touching on Thatcher's storied political career. But I would argue that because of their unease with Thatcher's belief system, they unconsciously attempt to disparage her. Lloyd and Morgan end up focusing on Thatcher in her old age, ravaged by Alzheimer's, and a shell of her former self. Thatcher is now transformed into a tragic figure, and whatever Lloyd and Morgan's underlying intentions, the net effect is to constantly remind us that a woman who once was a firebrand, has now been taken down quite a few pegs.It's one thing to deal with the reality of Thatcher's dementia, but to focus on it, as the main focus of the film, that's a big mistake. Why do we have to be constantly reminded of Thatcher's fall from grace? This could be a story about ANYONE with Alzheimer's! The Weinstein Brothers already covered the subject matter with their 2001 film, 'Iris' starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent (note Broadbent shows up here in virtually the same kind of role--the understanding husband who must cope with a wife in sad decline!) . And yes we know that Alzheimer's is a terrible thing but to knock us over the head scene after scene (with Thatcher experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband), that takes away from the material we're really interested in: Thatcher's rise to power and subsequent political career.Granted, it is a tall order to turn the story of Thatcher's political career into compelling drama; but Abi Morgan is clearly not up to the task. What the script lacks is basic conflict, with a recognizable external arc, culminating in a resolution to the protagonist's dark moment. 'The Iron Lady' works best when Thatcher battles her allies in the Conservative party, but those moments are fleeting. Her opponents are underdeveloped--on for such a short time that the film feels more like a History Channel biography than full fledged drama. Instead, we're treated to archival footage, chronicling the frenzied opposition to Thatcher's policies through the years, as well as realistic (but again, short) scenes in Parliament, where we never get to know any of the Labor opponents as fleshed out characters.Individual scenes do occasionally work. When a bespectacled Harry Lloyd (the young Denis Thatcher) proposes to Alexandra Roach (the young Margaret), the young actors capture the unbridled innocence of the young couple about to embark on their life's journey. The two scenes involving violence also work, which include Thatcher witnessing the assassination of a political mentor and surviving an IRA bombing with her husband, while staying a hotel for a political conference. The Falklands War is covered in the style of a standard biopic but we do learn interesting details as to Thatcher's reaction to the conflict (she writes personal letters to the families of each soldier killed). Finally, there's a powerful scene (albeit somewhat clich&eacute;d), as Thatcher witnesses her husband's death, as he disappears into white light.Despite Streep's bravura performance, one feels that she acts in isolation. Undoubtedly, Thatcher's rise was dependent on a myriad of relationships, which are only touched on briefly here. What's more, the film's scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall. She ended up alienating her very own conservative party members, who couldn't stand her lack of flexibility and harsh, demanding work habits.Somewhere, there's a story here but not in the confused recollections of a sad woman, plagued with dementia.

1451666,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0059XTUVI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 12]","When I first heard about THE IRON LADY, I was eager to see the movie.  I am a child of the 1980s and because of that I will always respect and admire Margaret Thatcher. As a kid, I remember seeing her on tv and listening to some of her speeches. I liked what I heard. She was the only current foreign leader I knew anything about until around fifth grade. As the first (and so far only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain, it wasn't until years later that I realized how extraordinary Thatcher's rise was. Her rise to the Prime Ministership is an incredible story that illustrates how freedom and determination can allow a person to rise above the position they were born into. It's a story that resonates particularly with women. Unfortunately, THE IRON LADY doesn't focus on that. Instead, it chooses to tell a story about Thatcher that revolves more around the spirit of the woman than the actual woman herself.THE IRON LADY opens with a present-day Thatcher (circa 2009) patiently waiting in line at a grocery store to buy a pint of milk. This moment seems bizarre and almost absurd. Yet, its significance is revealed as the film unfolds. This trip to the grocery store reinforces to Thatcher's staff that she is slowly losing her mind; they see her as a poor elderly grandparent who can no longer be trusted to make her own decisions and live by herself. However, to Thatcher the simple act of buying a pint of milk is extremely important; it is one of the ways she has stayed connected to and in touch with the people she has served her whole life.After that opening sequence, THE IRON LADY flashbacks to an earlier time in Thatcher's life. For me, this was one of the most disconcerting parts of the entire movie. Flashbacks serve a purpose, but they should be used sparingly. In THE IRON LADY, they are used on a regular basis throughout. I suppose one of the reasons for this is that the flashbacks echo memories Thatcher is recalling in the present at particular moments. This constant rewinding into the past and fastforwarding into the present augments the sensation in the audience that Thatcher is, perhaps, losing her mental faculties. This particular framing mechanism would be fine if it worked, but it doesn't. So, instead of empathizing with Thatcher, the audience is just left feeling nauseous and not really knowing why.Amidst this constant flux and flow of memories, is Denis Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher's husband. In the film's present day, Denis has been deceased for several years. However, Thatcher sees him and sometimes has conversations with him. She tries to ignore him or drown his voice out, but no matter what she does, she can't get rid of him. Denis Thatcher is the catalyst for much of what happens in the THE IRON LADY. For instance, Thatcher's staff and daughter keep trying to get her to let go of her dead husband's belongings, but for most of the movie she is unable to do so. In her mind, getting rid of Denis's clothes and other belongs is like completely erasing Denis from her life. It's rather touching and quite romantic; a love between two people that is so strong that even in death it cannot be broken. However, this love story between a woman and her dead husband is also the greatest drawback of the movie.Instead of being a story about the incredible life of Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a love story about two regular people that revolves around the struggle of one of those people to keep their mental faculties. I can somewhat understand why the filmmaker chose to make THE IRON LADY this way because it seems to humanize Thatcher. But, in delineating Thatcher's story to the realm of romance and framing the story within the context of a woman struggling with her own sanity, THE IRON LADY turns Thatcher's life into just a movie about aging and mental health and not about Margaret Thatcher. I don't want to see ordinary Margaret Thatcher as a woman in love struggling with dementia. I watched THE IRON LADY because I wanted to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher, the impressive and formidable woman who became the first female Prime Minister of England, an inspiration for woman everywhere. I wanted to see the fiery Margaret Thatcher who helped tear down the Iron Curtain, took back the Falkland Islands, stopped England from becoming a debtor nation, and what made her tick. Instead, what I got was a love story between a dead husband and his wife and her struggle against dementia.Despite the storytelling flaws, I did enjoy parts of THE IRON LADY because of the acting. Meryl Streep is uncanny as Thatcher; the mannerism and vocal inflections are nearly perfect. The resemblance between the actress and the Baroness is at times surreal. Jim Broadbent portrays Denis Thatcher and he makes a great foil to Streep's Thatcher. Also impressive are Alexandra Roach as the younger Thatcher and Harry Lloyd as the younger Denis Thatcher.Overall, THE IRON LADY is an unremarkable movie about one extraordinary remarkable real-life woman. The movie is worth watching for the acting, but average filmgoers might be so turned off by the storytelling that they'll sleep through the fine performances. The film also offers something to those who like romances and to those with an interest in mental health.",3,This IRON LADY Is a Tad Rusty,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,5268,"['When', 'first',

1451667,A16GAIJJE39T1S,B0059XTUVI,Ulfilas,"[1, 3]","This film is plotted from a retrospective point of view--from that of Margaret Thatcher as an elderly widow suffering from dementia.  Photographs, music, and TV programs serve to remind the declining old woman of her younger years and her glory days of Prime Minister.  Unfortunately this plotting device devotes too much time to her hallucinations--going through the same sort of imaginings again and again--especially those in which she conjures up the presence of her late husband.  This time would have been better spent on detailing her personal life and work in Parliament and as Prime Minister--or even her younger days as a shopkeepers daughter.  They also would have done well to show her interacting with her friend ""Ronny"" Reagan--an aspect of her tenure as PM that seems to have been all but forgotten here.Despite this awkward and tedious retrospective framework, this movie has moments that shine--for which we can thank consummate actress Meryl Streep.  I especially enjoyed the part where she acts on the advice of her political advisers and works to remake herself into someone who the voters can better respond to, and who they could imagine as Prime Minister.

I got a fairly good movie, an excellent leading actress, but I felt a sense of being ""let-down"". I do not feel that I got what I expected.  The movie seems to center around an elderly lady with dimentia who is remembering her life in flashbacks. I think there is too much of the film devoted to her old age. I would have liked to see more on the other aspects of her life. Particularly her interactions with Ronald Regan.Still, there are parts of the filim that are excellent. The make-up people did a wonderful job of making Meryl Streep look like Margaret Thatcher. I liked the portrayal of her marriage and the happiness she appeared to have with her husband. I liked the daughter who had the sole caregiver of her mother (her brother was away). It reminded me a lot of my own problems dealing with an aging mother who is imagining things.Thatcher was a pioneer in that she was the first woman to become prime minister of Britian, a great accomplishment for a woman in our day and age. She proved that a woman can hold a high government office and do the job well. I admire her for that, though I don't totally agree with her politics.

Many reviews are calling this work ""Masterful by Streep, but where is the film, the plot?"" I think the film is depicting truth; as difficult as some scenes are to watch one of the main tenets of a film is to tell the truth. This tenet has been caputured in MThatcher's idiosyncracies, philosophy, values, presence and aging process by Streep.The title of the film is symbolic of her time in office and is appropriate.  It can also be attributed to her life and struggle before entering parliament and when leaving as it does take strength to go it alone in the face of obvious ailments. I loved Streep's dialogue, accent, mannerisms as MT. That alone was worth the ticket.

This film takes the opposite tack toward the oxymoron. Rather than the lady's unexpectedly turning out to be made of metal, MT turns out to be made not of iron at all but of mortal and poignantly weak flesh (as are we all)--ultimately dependent on her daughter Carol, without close friends, even without the support and attention of her son (the father of her only grandchildren), who cannot be bothered to visit her. The film is structured as a series of flashbacks experienced by Margaret in old age after her husband Dennis's death. The victories of her past are entirely overbalanced by the compromises she suffers in the film's present. All her triumphs are qualified by the viewer's knowledge that, in her later years, she has become the victim of hallucinations that Dennis is still alive, that she fears for her sanity, and that she cannot be allowed out of her flat to buy a pint of milk (the first scene).One can see how it might have appealed to the makers of this film to exploit the gap between Thatcher's almost super-human strength and her all-too-human weakness. And yet this irony is more than a local effect in the movie, but the repeated and central conceit. Further, the title links the contradiction to her sex, and so it's hard for me not to feel that the film thus exploits the fact of her being a woman. Consider that her dependency is presented as having required her only daughter Carol to serve as her caretaker; the world of the present in which Margaret lives is sterile and constrained. Strong men are not thus portrayed in biopics about their lives, and the title ""The Iron Man"" would surely suggest a different implication.While Meryl Streep is brilliant in the role, one cannot help but be disappointed that she did not use her considerable stature as an actress to press for a more balanced view of Thatcher's accomplishments. Thatcher was one of the most influential and admired women of the twentieth century. To see her legacy so diminished--to remember her chiefly as a tormented and prattling dowager should be dispiriting to all women, regardless of the viewer's political persuasion.",3,Iron (wo)man,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,2254,"['When', 'Soviets', 'coined', 'title', 'iron', 'lady', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'slur', 'British', 'embraced', 'compliment', 'film', 'opposite', 'tack', 'oxymoron', 'Rather', 'lady', 'unexpectedly', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'made', 'metal', 'MT', 'out', 'be', 'made', 'not', 'iron', 'mortal', 'poignantly', 'weak', 'flesh', 'are', 'ultimately', 'dependent', 'daughter', 'Carol', 'close', 'friends', 'even', 'support', 'attention', 'son', 'father', 'only', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'visit', 'film', 'structured', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'experienced', 'Margaret', 'old', 'age', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'death', 'victories', 'past', 'are', 'entirely', 'overbalanced', 'compromises', 'film', 'present', 'triumphs', 'are', 'qualified', 'viewer', 'knowledge', 'later', 'years', 'become', 'victim', 'hallucinations', 'Dennis', 'still', 'alive', 'sanity', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'flat', 'buy', 'pint', 'milk', 'first', 'scene', '.One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'appealed', 'makers', 'film', 'exploit', 'gap', 'Thatcher', 'almost', 'super-human', 'strength', 'all-too-human', 'weakness', 'yet', 'irony', 'more', 'local', 'effect', 'movie', 'repeated', 'central', 'conceit', 'Further', 'title', 'contradiction', 'sex', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'film', 'thus', 'fact', 'being', 'woman', 'Consider', 'dependency', 'presented', 'having', 'required', 'only', 'daughter', 'Carol', 'serve', 'caretaker', 'world', 'present', 'Margaret', 'sterile', 'constrained', 'Strong', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'thus', 'portrayed', 'biopics', 'lives', 'title', 'Iron', 'Man', 'would', 'surely', 'suggest', 'different', 'implication.While', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'brilliant', 'role', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'considerable', 'stature', 'actress', 'press', 'more', 'balanced', 'view', 'Thatcher', 'accomplishments', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'admired', 'women', 'twentieth', 'century', 'see', 'legacy', 'so', 'diminished', 'remember', 'chiefly', 'tormented', 'prattling', 'dowager', 'should', 'be', 'dispiriting', 'women', 'regardless', 'viewer', 'political', 'persuasion']",N/A

1451678,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0059XTUVI,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[4, 6]","The Iron Lady, directed by Phyllida Lloyd with a screenplay by Abi Morgan, is something of a mixed bag. On the plus side - and it's a considerable plus - it has bravura performances by Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher and by Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis. The best parts of the film are when they are on screen together, for those are the times when Streep best brings out Thatcher as something more than her political persona, an image which the film, to its credit, does show as something Thatcher consciously groomed and developed.  And as she so often does, Streep has managed a performance in which she has so deeply immersed herself into the person she's portraying, taking on her accent, her facial expressions, her way of speaking, the actress is nowhere in evidence - it's Thatcher you see and hear on the screen.That said, however, the film itself is unfortunately something of an incoherent jumble, at least to an American viewer. Much too much of it consists of snapshot episodes and scenes presented with no framing context, a problem made more complicated by the way in which it jumps back and forth in time. It will be interesting to see what British viewers, who are far more likely to have the intimate familiarity with the historical periods and events covered, think of the film. For anyone else however, Thatcher's speeches and actions exist largely in a vacuum, with little to show or explain what she was doing, why she was doing it, and how it fit into the political narrative of the time.  We're shown piles of garbage being left outside 10 Downing Street but nothing about the garbagemen's strike or any of the other strikes going on at the time.  We're shown crowds of protestors shouting at Thatcher but nothing about the closing of plants and coal mines or cuts in services behind the protests, let alone _why_ they were taking place.  We're shown her as Prime Minister during the Falkland Islands War (for about ten minutes) but nothing about what the war was about.  We're shown Thatcher facing being deposed as Prime Minister but nothing about why she'd fallen out of favor in her own party beyond being bullying and abrasive.  One gets the feeling of being rushed through a museum of Thatcher's life but not being allowed enough time to learn anything about any of the exhibits: ""Just time for a quick look"" and then it's ""Move along, move along"".This lack of context is also felt in the way that most of the other characters in the film, particularly Thatcher's political cohorts and opponents, are never really developed individually, largely serving as a kind of harumphing background chorus and leaving Streep's Thatcher to exist in even more of a vacuum. A few exceptions are worth mentioning however. Harry Lloyd is quite engaging as the young Denis Thatcher who wins a young Margaret (Alexandra Roach) by alternately being supportive and doing little comic turns to make her laugh when he knows she's in need of one. And Anthony Head (yes, the one from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) does a sympathetic job as Thatcher's long time (and eventually long suffering) political ally, Geoffrey Howe. But beyond these limited contributions, it's really left to Streep and Broadbent to carry things along. And when they're on screen together, it works. When they're not, things feel stilted and set-pieced.Another problem is that Lloyd and Morgan don't seem to have had a clear idea as to just what kind of film they were wanting to make. One gets the feeling that they bit off far more than could be reasonably digested but were unwilling or unable to pare it all down, with the result of reducing Thatcher's life to a series of disjointed snippets, far too many of which were set pieces. No individual part is really bad, and one could see that there were easily three or four different films that they could have made that would have been far more engaging and given a clearer picture of the subject and the period. They could have made an entire film about Thatcher in her declining years, her mind fading, talking to her dead husband, Denis.  These scenes, between Streep and Broadbent, were by far the best and most touching parts of the film they did make.  They could have made a film devoted to her rise to power, or of her transformative years as Prime Minister, or of the period of the Falkland Islands War by itself. But in trying to jam it all into a single film, they have created a film of much flash but little substance.  This could be a result of both the director and writer's relative inexperience in the medium:  Lloyd as director (mostly a stage director, her only credit as a director of a feature film was Mama Mia!, in which Streep also appeared) and Morgan as writer (mostly a writer for television, though she did also write the screenplay for Shame, her only other feature film work).  But whatever the reason, The Iron Lady as a film neither flows nor does it paint a coherent picture, not of its subject and not of the times she lived in.One particular annoyance I had with the film is that it implies that Thatcher was virtually the only female member of parliament when she was first elected in 1959. In fact, you never, ever, see any other female MP's at any point in the film, in spite of the fact that by 1959 there had been female MP's for forty years and that in the 1959 election there were 25 female MP's elected, 12 for Thatcher's Conservative party and 13 for the Labor party. Granted, in 1959 women still only made up 4 percent of the House of Commons in total, but nonetheless Thatcher was far from being the only one.Another annoyance was in their ignoring the ""Iron Lady""'s other nickname - ""Snatcher Thatcher"" - and why she was given that particular sobriquet.  They attempt to show Thatcher as being controversial but without any real background as to why - rather a large omission to swallow given that Thatcher was as deeply hated by one half of the UK as she was admired by the other.Recommended for Streep and Broadbent's sterling performances, but as a film, less breadth would definitely have been more depth. -- Whitt Pond",3,Bravura performances by Meryl

One of her best movies if not THE BEST! She is quite unbelievable. Forget Deer Hunter, and the Devil wears Prada. She is probably the only actrice alive today that can put together such a performance.I understand that some people didn't like the back and forth between now as a sick individual and the past as a powerful LEADER. I also understand that some people thought that this movie is an insult to a great leader. However, while at the beginning I was frustrated too, by the end of the movie you get the message. This movie unlike many people try to make you think is homage to Margaret Thatcher's life, character and will. She is winning against the disease too.Never compromise. This is absolutely true for Maggie. She is fighting a terrible incurable disease now the same way she fought the other diseases that were taking over her country at the time she was Prime Minister. She is not confused at all as many people try to make you believe. The very end of the movie shows you what Maggie is all about. She is packing all of her husband's stuff, and she tells him: if I don't hear you don't exist; you are dead.The movie shows briefly her confrontations with the unions as a secretary of Education. The things that she said then can be applied to today's society easily.This movie is very actual, and there are so many similarities with the current political situation in the world that it will be very difficult for me to summarize them. You must watch the movie! And learn. Try to find leaders and try to convince them to run for office and let them try to change the world for the better. Do not let the politicians run for office. Find the leaders!When Maggie first decided to run, she was convinced she is not going to win, but she wanted to make a point. Airey Neave then told her the famous quote that is in the title of my review. When there were riots in the streets, the politicians came and told her to slow down. When Maggie asked them why, they replied because we are going to lose the next elections. And Maggie goes: ""aha, we worry about job security!"" Look around you. How many politicians you know that will really run for their ideas regardless of their popularity. That is a leader. There were only three leaders in the second half of the last century: Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. This movie depicts the life of one of them who like Churchill after saving Great Britain from misery, was immediately dismissed by the people who like and prefer instant gratification. (Churchill was good enough to lead Britain to victory during World War II, but was not good enough to lead Great Britain in time of peace according to the British voters at that time. Go figure!)There is a great scene in the movie when Maggie as a patient goes to the doctor and the doctor says: How do you feel Maggie? And then she starts with a great monologue about society that worries more about feelings than people's thoughts. Could that be applied to today's society? Absolutely!Great movie, five stars all around because of the acting, the script, and the director. It shows what a person with real character is. Keep the movie handy and watch it many times. Each time you will find a point of interest that you missed in the previous viewing. Need to find somebody like her and Reagan these days to help deal with the very difficult times.",5,"If you want to change a party lead it, if you want to change a country lead it!",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,3491,"['want', 'change', 'party', 'lead', 'want', 'change', 'country', 'lead', 'What', 'performance', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'One', 'best', 'movies', 'not', 'THE', 'BEST', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'Forget', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Devil', 'Prada', 'probably', 'only', 'actrice', 'alive', 'today', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'performance.I', 'understand', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'back', 'forth', 'now', 'sick', 'individual', 'past', 'powerful', 'LEADER', 'also', 'understand', 'people', 'thought', 'movie', 'insult', 'great', 'leader', 'However', 'beginning', 'was', 'frustrated', 'too', 'end', 'movie', 'get', 'message', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'think', 'homage', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'life', 'character', 'will', 'winning', 'disease', 'too.Never', 'compromise', 'absolutely', 'true', 'Maggie', 'fighting', 'terrible', 'incurable', 'disease', 'now', 'same', 'way', 'fought', 'other', 'diseases', 'were', 'taking', 'country', 'time', 'was', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'not', 'confused', 'many', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'believe', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'Maggie', 'packing', 'husband', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'are', 'dead.The', 'movie', 'shows', 'briefly', 'confrontations', 'unions', 'secretary', 'Education', 'things', 'said', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'today', 'society', 'easily.This', 'movie', 'very', 'actual', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'similarities', 'current', 'political', 'situation', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'learn', 'Try', 'find', 'leaders', 'try', 'convince', 'run', 'office', 'let', 'try', 'change', 'world', 'better', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'politicians', 'run', 'office', 'leaders', 'When', 'Maggie', 'first', 'decided', 'run', 'was', 'convinced', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'wanted', 'make', 'point', 'Airey', 'Neave', 'then', 'told', 'famous', 'quote', 'title', 'review', 'When', 'were', 'riots', 'streets', 'politicians', 'came', 'told', 'slow', 'down', 'When', 'Maggie', 'asked', 'why', 'replied', 'are', 'going', 'lose', 'next', 'elections', 'Maggie', 'aha', 'worry', 'job', 'security', 'Look', 'How', 'many', 'politicians', 'know', 'will', 'really', 'run', 'ideas', 'regardless', 'popularity', 'leader', 'were', 'only', 'three', 'leaders', 'second', 'half', 'last', 'century', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'movie', 'life', 'one', 'who', 'Churchill', 'saving', 'Great', 'Britain', 'misery', 'was', 'immediately', 'dismissed', 'people', 'who', 'prefer', 'instant', 'gratification', 'Churchill', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'lead', 'Britain', 'victory', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'lead', 'Great', 'Britain', 'time', 'peace', 'according', 'British', 'voters', 'time', 'Go', 'figure', 'great', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Maggie', 'patient', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'How', 'do', 'feel', 'Maggie', 'then', 'great', 'monologue', 'society', 'more', 'feelings', 'people', 'thoughts', 'Could', 'be', 'applied', 'today', 'society', 'Absolutely', 'Great', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'around', 'acting', 'script', 'director', 'what', 'person', 'real', 'character', 'Keep', 'movie', 'handy', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'point', 'interest', 'missed', 'previous', 'viewing', 'Need', 'find', 'somebody', 'Reagan', 'days', 'help', 'deal', 'very', 'difficult', 'times']",N/A

I found it extremely confusing to be constantly whipsawing back and forth in time, in & out of reality & hallucinations.I did find about 5 or 6 brief moments in the film that were VERY good.HOWEVER, this was not a portrait of Ms Thatcher that I expected, and I'm guessing that it is more or less accurate.. . IF THAT IS THE CASE, then the film did us a service.BTW- I loved the King's Speech, The Queen, (I'm not a Brit), there was a PBS/BBC thing about 2 years back about one of the royal kids who had down syndrome or something that was great too.***FOR MUCH BETTER, ABOUT MS THATCHER:START WITHDocumentary- Margaret Thatcher - Long Walk to Finchley (BBC) - UTube (90min)This is about young Ms Thatcher up to the point of getting elected to Parliament, at that time she was the first and only female. This was a long, difficult ordeal for her with MANY defeats, in a Brit-version of the Good-ole-boys club.NEXT GOTO the Documentary-style:Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Downing Street Years - also on UTube (4hours)This series shows pretty clearly why she is a Conservative's Dream PoliticianShe had utter, and unshakable confidence and belief in herself, and like Reagan, GWB, Cheney, didn't believe in ever questioning her assumptions.AND her only interest was in being effectively a dictator.NOTE= In Britain, the PM isn't elected directly by the voters.
