While I do like the original a bit more, this one is not bad at all.  I don't understand everyone hating this one so much.  Bean makes a good bad guy although he lacks the subtle undercurrent of menace and lunacy that Hauer was able to convey.  Beard is more up front in his deviancy. This one features two protagonists instead of one and the ending is changed a bit.  The other classic scenes are intact such as the first pick up, the stationwagon family, and the diner, with some variations from the original in most of these scenes.

1058076,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000NO3DLG,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company had great success at the box office when they re-made ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" a few years ago. Since that worked with the green, they must of figured that it would every time. More re-makes came, and now there are at least three more in the pipeline(Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Rosemary's Baby). When will this ""real"" horror be over?. And now we have this. The original film, starring Rutger Hauer, C. Thomas Howell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, was a fun and suspenseful little film from 1986. Maybe not phenomenal cinema, but a good movie. No real need to give it an update. No need to update any of these movies(well, maybe 'The Amityville Horror').The plot and movie have some different twists, but basically, it's the same thing. Two young twenty-somethings(Zachary Knighton, Sophia Bush)get in a near accident on the road. They later run into the man they almost hit, John Ryder(played by the always good Sean Bean), who they give a ride. Baaaaaaad mistake. 'Ol John is a raging psycho who stalks and torments the two, leaving a bloody path in his wake.There are no real surprises here, or anything new. The movie is what it is and it's probably what you expect. It's not bad as a cliche road thriller, but it is absolutely nothing else. Since it's 20 some years later, the bar is much higher in terms of violence, blood, and action. The female becomes the hero, while the boyfriend pretty much becomes the damsel in distress. Otherwise, it pretty much stays the course not only to the original film, but to other modern/young adult type movies of it's kind. However, the movie looks really good and has a nice feel and tone to it. It was a nice looking movie from start to finish.Cast-wise, not a whole lot to praise. Sean Bean has been a James Bond baddie(""GoldenEye""), to a good guy(""FlightPlan""), and he excells at both. He is pretty good here with a pretty strong presence. He is no Rutger Hauer, but he does what he can with the role. Neal McDonough, as the sheriff, basically has the simple task of figuring out what's going on. His role is pretty minimal, but likeable. As for our two young leads, there is nothing spectacular here other than Sophia Bush's amazing beauty.""The Hitcher"" re-make is by the book. There's nothing beneath the surface, but it is what it is. If you absolutely have to re-make something, then don't make the same movie. At least try something a little different, like Rob Zombie's recent 'Halloween' film. Otherwise, what's the point?.

Every time someone dies, it's because the maniac has killed them, and when the young man and his girlfriend arrive to the scene, everyone (cops mostly) suspect THEY were the ones responsible for the murders.  This means the man and his girlfriend are spending most of the time running and hiding.Eventually, it all leads up to a big car chase involving the man and his girlfriend and about three cop vehicles and a helicopter.  The cops are convinced the man and the girlfriend are murderers, however, the man who was actually responsible for the murders enters the picture right at this moment, and he totally destroys all the cop vehicles and the helicopter.  This is when the cops realize what's going on.Soon after this point, the action scenes turn into extremely violent and bloody horror scenes, and some surprises can be found along the way.

Zachary Knighton pulled off his character well enough and Sophia Bush didn't do badly either but both of them were brushed aside by the mere presence of Sean Bean. He was brilliant! There really aren't too many more words to describe his work.His role as John Ryder was played perfectly, so deep and so real.

The entire set and scenery was well placed and very well shot.The horror was as horror should be, suspensful and gory but the blood was tastefully placed and not needlessly splattered all over the screen.

1058079,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000NO3DLG,Boss Fan,"[0, 1]","There's nothing original or very scary about this, yet another remake of a far superior original, but this ""Hitcher"" seems to want to be more of an action flick than the slasher movie is marketed to be and based upon.  And as an action flick it holds together fairly well.  It's not technically what you would call a good film per se, but its briskly paced, has a slick - sometimes gorgeous - look and style and two rock `em, sock `em car chases. It is unrelentingly violent at points in an effort to shock. That it does, but not necessarily in a good way. For a movie that is more of an action pic, scenes that play like something out of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel out of place here.  But the movie is far from perfect in a lot of ways.  It is pretty much generic of its type and, thereby, mostly predictable, the killer is typically invisible and uncatchable, always one step ahead, and the characters fail to make logical choices quite a bit.  But this ""Hitcher"" is not nearly as head-slappingly bad as many of these types of flicks and at least the two leads aren't as stupid, obnoxious and unpleasant as those in say the recent crop of ""Chainsaw Massacre"" flicks, or something like the dreadful ""Turistas"" or ""Wolf Creek"" (comparatively, they are actually quite likeable). Ditto this film.  It may be simple genre junk, but it's better than much of its ilk.

A chance encounter with a murderous hitchhiker leaves them running for their lives in a sadistic game of cat and mouse. Sean Bean steps in for Rutger Hauer in this recent remake of the classic film, whose chiseled features and razorblade smile make him appear trustworthy until he shifts gears in to his chilling true self. Bean is an excellent choice for John Ryder, and manages a strong performance that is worthy of the role. The addition of a second character from the start allows for some much needed dialog (though be it filler) throughout the earlier scenes. The most apparent problem that exists with this version is that it shares a near-identical plot progression to the 1986 film, capitalizing on all of the most memorable moments with minimal changes. This makes it unnecessary at best, and a plagiaristic reshoot at worst. Despite the similarities, Meyers remake does recreate much of the same action and suspense with much success, giving it a clean look with decent acting even if it fails to produce anything original.

Sophia Bush is beautiful and convincing as a unwitting sorority girl turned gun toting rebel. So, why just 2 stars?SCREENPLAY!!!!Eric Red co-wrote the screenplay. The funny thing is, he also wrote the original Rutger Hauer & C. Thomas Howell version which was much better.For some reason, this seemed to run from scene to scene with an empty, flowless feeling. Which is most likely the director's fault, but all the scenes from the original... seem to pop up and aren't anywhere near as shocking as the original. The psycho in the back of the car with the kid. The girl tied between the semi and its trailer (different in the remake).The cast was flat and forgettable. They were plain and one dimensional.The original had a mood to it that flowed and you felt the fear that Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) was going through. Not to mention, Jennifer Jason Leigh was exceptional as Nash. She isn't as hot as Sophia Bush, but wow was she believable.Bottom line, although Sophia Bush is a beautiful girl, Rutger Hauer, C. Thomas Howell & Jennifer Jason Leigh were a better cast. The original was a better movie. So, on a final note... STOP WITH THE REMAKES!!! Doesn't anybody in HOLLYWOOD have any original ideas???

1058085,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000NO3DLG,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 8]","You remember the 1986 version of ""The Hitcher,"" don't you? It pitted C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh against Rutger Hauer, who gave his John Ryder character a demented edge that was effectively unnerving. I remember watching it and admiring the way screenwriter Eric Red gave legitimacy to a completely unrealistic story; he exposed the dark side of human nature without being exploitive or trashy, something that can't be said for gory teen slasher films. I was pleased to discover that this new version works in much the same way, which is good considering all the ways it could have gone wrong. The Ryder character, now played by Sean Bean, could have been warped into a campy horror stereotype. He could have been a supernatural killing machine that can't be stopped, even after being shot, stabbed, burned, beaten, or any combination thereof.This remake goes in the right direction by keeping him firmly planted in humanity. Despite his psychopathic tendencies, he's just as susceptible to death as anyone else. For both versions of the film, that forced me to redefine what a horror movie maniac can be. When watching the shameless exploits of Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers, or Jason Voorhees, it was intended for senseless murdering to be entertaining. They may be evil characters, but we don't want them to die; they're too much fun to watch. John Ryder, on the other hand, is a frightening, loathsome man who deserves no praise. He murders innocent people for no apparent reason. He destroys any possibility of hope or happiness. He ruins all that is decent in this world. He's a horror movie villain we do want dead.For this remake, Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush replace C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh. They play Jim Halsey and Grace Andrews, a college age couple on a Spring Break road trip. They cross paths with Ryder upon entering New Mexico, where the obligatory rainstorm sets the proper mood for the impending terror. Ryder inexplicably singles them out after they nearly run him over. They initially think they're doing something nice for a man who needs a lift. But then he begins asking some inappropriate questions, all of which lead up to him saying, ""It makes me look trustworthy."" ""Aren't you?"" Halsey timidly asks. ""No,"" Ryder replies in a simple yet suspicious tone. All suspicions are confirmed when he crushes Halsey's cell phone and pulls a knife on Grace.And so begins a downhill journey into a living nightmare--we all know it isn't enough to simply push the perpetrator out of the vehicle and speed away. They're now firmly planted in Ryder's mind, and he will stop at nothing to make them suffer. First, he makes sure they witness the murder of a devoutly religious family riding in their station wagon (special attention is given to a bumper sticker proclaiming Jesus' love and a blood spattered pamphlet asking who will get into Heaven). This is one of his many attempts to frame them; it isn't long before the police are involved, and for a significant period of time, they believe that Halsey and Grace are the evildoers. It gets worse after the arresting officers are murdered; the young couple escapes from the jailhouse armed with weapons, covered in dirt and blood, looking as guilty as sin.I found Ryder's ability to twist every scenario fascinating. Just when Halsey and Grace think they've found a way to get help, Ryder turns the tide in his favor, which makes them seem responsible for everything that's happened. At the same time, his actions are also puzzling. I say this because Ryder is a well-crafted character stuck in an implausible story. I never believed for a second that any of this could actually happen in real life; Ryder's blatantly insane and sloppy methods would have caught up with him a long time ago. How interesting that I still enjoyed this movie.Maybe one of the reasons is because of the final major sequence involving Halsey chained to a truck, his wrists attached to the engine, his ankles attached to the carriage. Ryder is in the driver's seat, his foot easing on the accelerator, signaling to Grace his intention of tearing poor Halsey in two. I loved the tension in this scene, made stronger by the fact that Grace is aiming a gun at Ryder's head. Will he do it or won't he? Will she do it or won't she? This scene was also the highlight of the 1986 film, which put Jennifer Jason Leigh in the same position. I obviously can't say how the events unfold in either version; let's just say that those of you who have seen the original will not be surprised by what the remake has to offer.Yes, I did like this 2007 remake of ""The Hitcher,"" despite an unrealistic plot. I think the most likely reason is because it's consistently terrifying, going from one startling sequence to the next seamlessly. It's also terrifying in terms of John Ryder; a silhouetted figure standing in the middle of the road is enough to make anyone afraid, especially when it's pouring rain. Thirdly, it's terrifying because it reinforces a guideline we were all taught; the film's tagline is, ""Never pick up strangers,"" and common sense should tell you that this is very good advice.",4,Take a Ride on the Dark Side,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,5156,"['remember', '1986', 'version', 'Hitcher', 'do', ""n't"", 'pitted', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh',

1058086,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000NO3DLG,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 2]","I got a confession to make: I never saw the original. I've heard about it of course; thanks to the press from this film but I've just never bothered to check it out. What propelled me to check out this one is that there's just simply nothing else out (until next week with the double whammy of Pan's Labyrinth and the Fountain). It's a familiar story this film's telling but it's also a pretty thin story and you can tell it's just basically padding. The Hitcher is one of those remakes that if they never remade it, no one would even ask for it, that's how unnecessary it feels.Grace and Jim are a young couple heading out on the road for spring break. During an incredibly raining night, they narrowly hit a man standing on the road. They take off but end up meeting up with him at a gas station later and they offer him a ride. Little do they know (but we know better) that this man, John Ryder, is quite the psychopath and hunts them down all over the highway. Playing cat and mouse with law enforcement believing they're the ones committing the acts John's doing, they have to outrun not only a murderous psycho but disbelieving officers.This isn't exactly the best paced thriller film I've seen. Even when tension picks up, it just feels lazy; like the scenes are tense but they're just not getting through. Some scenes are kind of tense such as their initial encounter with John in the car but other than that, they just go from scene to scene without much of a care of what'll happen to them, we're just waiting for it. Not to mention these aren't exactly the most consistent characters such as one officer who believes it's the couple that's killing travellers yet at a dime he changes his tone and wants to bring them in with a ""these kids did it"" tone. Constantly Jim and Grace make the most dumbest decisions and you'll find herself basically imagining what they should be doing the whole movie.As for the acting, it's basically horror standards, which means not good. Sean Bean playing John is of course menacing like he always is when he plays a villain but some might miss a more crazier looking actor like Rutger Hauer (or even Dennis Hopper). The 2 young leads, the one that comes across as the most sympathetic is Sophia Bush. She's not necessarily great but it's easy to start caring and hoping she lives (fact she's cute too helps). Ultimately, all the leads are fine; not exceptional, not terrible, just...""fine"".Should you buy?

1058087,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000NO3DLG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","Never having seen the original 1986 version of The Hitcher, I probably enjoyed this film more than I might have otherwise.  Even still, this film suffers from what has been a noticeable saturation of recent horror movies with a ""killer on the highways"" motif (think Joyride, Jeepers Creepers, etc.).  Basically, this 2007 film doesn't really offer viewers anything new or different, but I think it succeeds pretty darn well at what it does in fact deliver, due in large part to Sean Bean's menacing performance as the heavy in the story.  You'll never hear me complain about the casting of Sophia Bush, either; she's particularly sexy when she gets mad.  I can't say I was all too impressed by Zachary Knighton, but that had a lot to do with his character, who was something less than the kind of knight in shining armor a character played by Sophia Bush deserved.  I must say I loved what they did with the lead male character in the end, though.  For once, I saw a ""don't you wish"" moment come true before my delighted eyes.So, Jim (Knighton) picks up Grace (Bush) at college to head off for some spring break shenanigans.  Driving through a New Mexico rainstorm that night, the unobservant Jim all but runs over some weird dude just standing there in the middle of the road.  Grace convinces her boyfriend to high-tail it out of there, but the weird dude turns up again when Jim stops for gas.  Jim can hardly refuse to give the guy a ride up the road (thereby completing disregarding Grace's wise counsel), but it doesn't take long for ""John Ryder"" (Bean) to reveal his true nature, which is far more mad and dangerous than even Grace could have imagined.  Jim and Grace don't know why this stranger is tormenting them, but they find themselves reluctant pawns in whatever dangerous game he is playing.  The guy just keeps turning up everywhere they go, murdering many a person along the way.  The kids can't even go to the cops because they would seem to be implicated in every crime he commits.  All they know to do is to keep running, desperately trying to shake this stranger who seems intent on destroying them utterly.The story is solid enough and the acting is pretty decent (especially from Bean and Bush), but the special effects probably stand out the most among the different aspects of the film.  There are some thrilling car wrecks, the blood and gore is realistic (even though, unfortunately, we see few of the actual kills directly), and the pacing is good.  It's a little on the short side, though, running a grand total of eight-four minutes.  Still, in the end, I have to say that The Hitcher is not a bad movie by any means - I don't think it will scare the vast majority of viewers or grip them in quite the same fashion as similar films such as Joyride, but it's still very much worth watching.",4,"Not exactly original or unique, but a pretty suspenseful little horror story",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2819,"['Never', 'having', 'seen', 'original', '1986', 'version', 'Hitcher', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'Even', 'still', 'film', 'suffers', 'been', 'noticeable', 'saturation', 'recent', 'horror', 'movies', 'killer', 'highways', 'motif', 'think', 'Joyride', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'etc.', 'Basically', '2007', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'viewers', 'anything', 'new', 'different', 'think', 'pretty', 'darn', 'well', 'what', 'fact', 'deliver', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'menacing', 'performance', 'heavy', 'story', ""'ll"", 'never', 'hear', 'complain', 'casting', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'either', 'particularly', 'sexy', 'when', 'mad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'too', 'impressed', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'something', 'less', 'kind', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'character', 'played', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'deserved', 'must', 'say', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'end', 'though', 'once', 'saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'moment', 'come', 'true', 'delighted', 'eyes.So', 'Jim', 'Knighton', 'up', 'Grace', 'Bush', 'college', 'head', 'off', 'spring', 'break', 'shenanigans', 'Driving', 'New', 'Mexico', 'rainstorm', 'night', 'unobservant', 'Jim', 'over', 'weird', 'dude', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'middle', 'road', 'Grace', 'boyfriend', 'high-tail', 'weird', 'dude', 'up', 'again', 'when', 'Jim', 'gas', 'Jim', 'can', 'hardly', 'refuse', 'give', 'guy', 'ride', 'road', 'thereby', 'completing', 'disregarding', 'Grace', 'wise', 'counsel', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'John', 'Ryder', 'Bean', 'reveal', 'true', 'nature', 'far', 'more', 'mad', 'dangerous', 'even', 'Grace', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'Jim', 'Grace', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'stranger', 'tormenting', 'find', 'reluctant', 'pawns', 'dangerous', 'game', 'playing', 'guy', 'just', 'turning', 'up', 'everywhere', 'go', 'murdering', 'many', 'person', 'way', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'cops', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'implicated', 'crime', 'know', 'do', 'keep', 'running', 'desperately', 'trying', 'shake', 'stranger', 'who', 'intent', 'destroying', 'utterly.The', 'story', 'solid', 'enough', 'acting', 'pretty', 'decent', 'especially', 'Bean', 'Bush', 'special', 'effects', 'probably', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'different', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'thrilling', 'car', 'wrecks', 'blood', 'gore', 'realistic', 'even', 'unfortunately', 'see', 'few', 'actual', 'kills', 'directly', 'pacing', 'good', 'little', 'short', 'side', 'though', 'running', 'grand', 'total', 'eight-four', 'minutes', 'Still', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'Hitcher', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'scare', 'vast', 'majority', 'viewers', 'grip', 'quite', 'same', 'fashion', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'Joyride', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Since then, every classic horror movie has been fair game for new producers, directors and writers to have their way with. And thats where the pointless remake of The Hitcher comes in. As has been mentioned by countless other reviewers, Sean Bean in the place of Rutger Hauer is a noted loss, however the real issue with the remake is the changed storyline which is more of a blending of the original Hitcher and its direct to DVD sequel than anything new. The problem is that by making it a duo of good against a single evil, the tension is all but gone.

1058094,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B000NO3DLG,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[1, 2]","In many years to come people will think of ""The Hitcher"" remake"",(the original 1986 version) as a person terrorizing people in the beautiful countryside landscapes of New Mexico. Who tells his victims to say, ""I want to die."" Or, a movie that depicts the story of beautiful cumulus clouds and their epic journey with various diners, police cars--including the entire state of New Mexico law enforcement--gas stations, two college kids, and a maniac ""over the hill"" killer.Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton), a collegiate couple, decide to take a trip through New Mexico for spring break--not Florida. However, while traveling they avoid a horrific accident with a stranger on the roadside. Grace decides that it might not be such a good idea to pick up this hitcher (John Ryder, [a.k.a. The Hitcher, Sean Bean]). They quickly leave the scene, and drive to a nearby gas station. Upon arriving, Grace has to go to the bathroom and within a few moments, John Ryder appears from another vehicle. Jim apologies, offers him a ride and John accepts. Soon afterwards, there is a violent struggle but Jim prevails when he kicks him out of his car. They soon fine themselves in a world of trouble when they are responsible for the death of a family. Even though, they are in the safe confinements of the law, the hitcher aids them in their escape--by killing the police--and now they fine themselves as fugitives. What do Grace and Jim fear the most, the law or, the hitcher?We really cannot blame the movie's director David Meyers (American music video director) nor can we blame the cinematographer James Hawkinson. However, we sure can blame Michael Bay who owns Platinum Dunes--this company produces horror remakes from the 70's and the 80's--for another poor attempt of producing the remake of the 1986 film.The movie's strengths relies in the great cinematography of the scenic surroundings--which reminded us of the 2006 animated film ""Cars""--of the New Mexico countryside and the often and over the top action sequences like the ""Dukes of Hazard"".What are the weaknesses of this movie? The director--with the influence of Michael Bay--never gives us any background information of the plot as well as the character development. This is why the movie lacks in suspense and drama. However, poor editing of the action sequences is what really gets our attention. We believe that the film's editing was actually happening as we were watching certain parts of the film. For example, there is a scene where our two victims (Grace and Jim), are standing near a formation of rocks that formed a hill. When suddenly, a truck comes crashing down and almost hits them. Therefore, it gives us the impression of watching a ""Loony Tune"" Road Runner cartoon and you might ask how this relates? It gives us the impression of an artist drawing something into the scene, like the Road Runner.We recommend that you do not see this film unless you are a big fan of unnecessary violence, and if you like TV based, cop reality shows. However, we do recommend that you go to your local video store and pick up a copy of the original 1986 film ""The Hitcher"" staring (Rutger Hauer.)",3,"PLease proceed with with caution, when hitching a ride to the video  store for this movie.",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,3181,"['many', 'years', 'come', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'Hitcher', 'remake', 'original', '1986', 'version', 'person', 'terrorizing', 'people', 'beautiful', 'countryside', 'landscapes', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Who', 'victims', 'say', 'want', 'die', 'movie', 'story', 'beautiful', 'cumulus', 'clouds', 'epic', 'journey', 'various', 'diners', 'police', 'cars', 'including', 'entire', 'state', 'New', 'Mexico', 'law', 'enforcement', 'gas', 'stations', 'two', 'college', 'kids', 'maniac', 'hill', 'killer.Grace', 'Andrews', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'Jim', 'Halsey', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'collegiate', 'couple', 'decide', 'take', 'trip', 'New', 'Mexico', 'spring', 'break', 'not', 'Florida', 'However', 'traveling', 'avoid', 'horrific', 'accident', 'stranger', 'roadside', 'Grace', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'pick', 'up', 'hitcher', 'John', 'Ryder', '[', 'a.k.a', 'Hitcher', 'Sean', 'Bean', ']', 'quickly', 'leave', 'scene', 'drive', 'nearby', 'gas', 'station', 'arriving', 'Grace', 'go', 'bathroom', 'few', 'moments', 'John', 'Ryder', 'vehicle', 'Jim', 'apologies', 'ride', 'John', 'accepts', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'violent', 'struggle', 'Jim', 'when', 'car', 'soon', 'fine', 'world', 'trouble', 'when', 'are', 'responsible', 'death', 'family', 'Even', 'are', 'safe', 'confinements', 'law', 'hitcher', 'escape', 'killing', 'police', 'now', 'fine', 'fugitives', 'What', 'do', 'Grace', 'Jim', 'fear', 'most', 'law', 'hitcher', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'movie', 'director', 'David', 'Meyers', 'American', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'can', 'blame', 'cinematographer', 'James', 'Hawkinson', 'However', 'sure', 'can', 'blame', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'who', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'company', 'horror', 'remakes', '70', '80', 'poor', 'attempt', 'producing', 'remake', '1986', 'film.The', 'movie', 'strengths', 'relies', 'great', 'cinematography', 'scenic', 'surroundings', 'reminded', '2006', 'animated', 'film', 'Cars', 'New', 'Mexico', 'countryside', 'often', 'top', 'action', 'sequences', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'movie', 'director', 'influence', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'never', 'background', 'information', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'development', 'why', 'movie', 'suspense', 'drama', 'However', 'poor', 'editing', 'action', 'sequences', 'what', 'really', 'attention', 'believe', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'were', 'watching', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'victims', 'Grace', 'Jim', 'are', 'standing', 'formation', 'rocks', 'formed', 'hill', 'When', 'suddenly', 'truck', 'crashing', 'down', 'almost', 'hits', 'Therefore', 'impression', 'watching', 'Loony', 'Tune', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoon', 'might', 'ask', 'how', 'impression', 'artist', 'drawing', 'something', 'scene', 'Road', 'Runner.We', 'recommend', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'like', 'TV', 'based', 'cop', 'reality', 'shows', 'However', 'do', 'recommend', 'go', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'original', '1986', 'film', 'Hitcher', 'staring', 'Rutger', 'Hauer']",N/A

The new version, ""The HItcher"" looks good visually and the production values are higher than usual for this genre. But a truly terrible script sabotages any hopes of this film becoming a classic of its kind. For one thing, the male and female couple do so many incredibly stupid things that you quickly lose any interest in their fates. At the beginning, the poor bleeding heart hero wants to stop his car and pick up a hithhiker in the pouring rain. His girlfriend wisely persuades him not to. But then the hitchhiker appears at the service station where the couple have stopped. When he asks the couple for a ride, the poor hero agrees to. Quickly, the hitcher proves to be a psychotic killer. Somehow the couple get rid of him but they never report this incident to the state troopers. They stop overnight and sleep in their car as if nothing had happened. When they find a family in their car who have been butchered, the couple get into the car and drive to a service station. The girl runs in but heads straight to the bathroom. The boy remains in the car, working to revive an obviously dead man. Do they call the law? Oh, no. Somehow, police finally stop the couple and put them in jail. But the hitcher kills all the officers in the jail and the couple escape, although they're aware that backup troops are racing to the scene. And then the crazy couple actually hop into a car and race away from the fresh troops, instead of being taken into protective custody where they could at least be safe from the killer. On the highway, the hitcher kills all pursuing cops and even one in a helicopter by simply aiming and firing his pistol. The movies deteriorates even worse from here on and if you're like me, you've already fast-forwarded to the end. This movie reminded me a lot of ""Rest Stop"" which is another abomination because the heroine acts in a way that is so stupid and incredible that you really hope the killer will off her to stop her non-stop crying and carrying on. If ""Hitcher"" had had a better script, it would have saved it.

Having seen my fair share of crappy ""thrillers"" I wasn't expect a whole lot.The basic premise of this movie is dependent on 2 main facts to the plot; the hitcher is this crazed psychopath who will pounce like a tiger (and who can apparently be in multiple places at once) and the cops are these dimwitted fools that couldn't save a person's life if their own depended on it (by the way, I'd like to see just 1 movie with a smart cop made).The overall movie was alright and the performances were fine. Although the couple, Grace and Jim (Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton) just acted very under whelmed. They're being chases by this one-man kamikaze and the best they can do is run around like they're on a camping trip.I don't want to give too much away but the ending was extremely anticlimactic. I was expecting a lot more, I suppose.

1058108,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000NO3DLG,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 2]","In the horror film genre you can always count on the fact that these types of movies will undoubtedly follow the trends of the time. In the early days of cinema monster films were the way to go. In the 70's, John Carpenter set a new trend of the unkillable killer with his classic ""Halloween"". With the 80's came the era of the overly repetitive sequel with series' such as 'Friday the 13th' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Then, director Wes Craven introduced the hip, smart-talking, mystery filled horror film with his mega hit ""Scream"". But the most recent trend began in 2003 with the remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", thus the trend of the remake had begun and is still going strong. The most recent addition to this trend is the 2007 release of ""The Hitcher"" starring Sean Bean, a remake of a 1986 film of the same name starring Rutger Hauer.""The Hitcher"" is set during spring break when a young couple is taking a road trip to see some friends. But what started out as a peaceful, fun trip quickly turned deadly when the couple decides to pick-up a hitchhiker (Sean Bean), and this kind gesture is now a fight for survival against a psychotic killer that will never give up.With many of these recent remakes I find myself wondering, ""Why? What's the point with these movies?"" And for the most part I can't come up with much of an answer for myself. I see to some extent that you may want to make the story a little more solid, or at least attempt to, maybe give some more background to some of these villains that have become cult icons. But for the most part, the biggest point to making one of these remakes is to up the blood and gore quotient of the original film. Generally the originals were made with far less emphasis on gore, and for some reason today's directors feel the need to dump as many buckets of fake blood over the course of the movie as possible. And of course plenty of horror film enthusiasts will go out and see these films. Now I will admit that I watch horror films, and some of them I actually think are good (the 'Scream' trilogy, for instance), but I don't watch these movies just to see blood and guts, in fact I'm fine with the more Hitchkockian approach of making the audience imagine what's happening rather than showing them. What gets me to want to see one of these movies is if the movie appears to have a story, looks intriguing, and the possibility of a couple of thrills, and maybe even a jump scene or two. But with these recent remakes that Hollywood has been churning out, I've got to say, I'm not impressed. I haven't seen a single one that was really worth anything. Most are simply the same story but with much more gore, not too much more depth is added to any other aspect of the original film, they all just seem like an excuse to splash some more blood on the screen.With all that being said, and my rant on this most recent trend complete, I will move on to what I thought of ""The Hitcher"". So, did ""The Hitcher"" manage to succeed where all the other horror remakes have failed or did it succumb to the same sad ending? In my opinion, ""The Hitcher"" succumbed. The movie started out with some promise, but quickly began to crumble due to not enough story and too many plot holes. I don't know what the writers were thinking, perhaps they felt the audience was smart enough to just interpret the rest of the story for themselves so that they wouldn't have to write it out. I don't know, but for the most part there was too much left unexplained and too many 'How did that happen?' type of scenarios that caused this movie to fall apart in a hurry.The actors all did well with what they were given to work with, Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton as the young couple were very capable as the victims, and Neal McDonough's (""Walking Tall"") brief appearance as a police lieutenant was a bright spot for the movie. But the biggest kudos go to Sean Bean for his menacing turn as the villain John Ryder (originally played by Rutger Hauer in the 1986 version). Sean does very well in the villainous role, but what I don't get though, is as good of an actor as Sean Bean is, why would he choose to sign on to a movie like this? I understand that maybe he wanted to play a character that is well known and try to put his own spin on it, but he surely read the script first. I mean when your character's entire motivation for why he's doing this is summed up with the words ""You're a smart boy, you'll figure it out."", you know you're in trouble, because it's obvious the writers couldn't come up with a reason for why he's a killer. My guess is that Sean was bored and just wanted a paycheck, otherwise there's not much more reason for him taking the role in this lame remake.""The Hitcher"" is one of those movies that looked good, had what appeared to be a decent story, a solid actor as the villain, but somewhere along the way managed to fall completely apart. And clearly, I'm not alone in my thinking because the movie did not do well at the box office, staying only a brief time in theaters before being sent on it's way to DVD shelves where it should have premiered in the first place.""The Hitcher"" is rated R for violence and language.",2,"Never Pick Up Strangers, or This Movie...",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,5193,"['horror', 'film', 'genre', 'can',

Luckily for the man Jim and Grace stopped at a gas station up a bit further and he catches up with them. He asks for a ride and off they go on one of the most regrettable trips in their lives.First the story has no type of buildup or suspense; it just throws you right into the plot as soon as possible. No wait I forgot that it does have a 10-minute song to show credits as if the movie is something special. Then the movie throws a good cast in the trash with a bad script. I don't understand how you're given this movie that will need the attention of a great writer to slow it down and make it scary. Because there on open road there really isn't that much for ""Bean"" to do so you find things to make it suspenseful. They couldn't even do that they just turned it into a gigantic shootout with Bean doing most of the shooting and his bullets were the only ones hitting.Ok so the Hitcher is a remake and I've never seen the original but this one is very bad. It's too fake and even people that saw it and liked have to admit how unbelievable the film is. How can the hitcher do these crazy things and even take out helicopters.

1058116,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B000NO3DLG,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[1, 1]","Who didn't love to hate Sean Bean when the English actor first came onto the US radar in 1992's Patriot Games? Following with another villainous turn in the initial Pierce Brosnan Bond flick Goldeneye (1995), it is no wonder American audiences didn't begin to appreciate the versatile actor until Bean's understated performance as the ill-fated Boromir in The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Always popular overseas as Napoleonic hero Richard Sharpe in the British television series of the same name, Sean Bean's most recent high profile American picture was this winter's The Hitcher, a remake of the 1986 Rutger Hauer yarn about a psychotic hitchhiker who trails innocents and frames them for his crimes. Directed by famed music video helmsman Dave Meyers, The Hitcher boasts production support from mega action chairman Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) and Matthew Cohan-who also fronted the edgy and popular remakes of The Amityville Horror and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (as well as the sci-fi flick The Island-also starring Bean).Unfortunately, The Hitcher failed to further shiver mid January movie going audiences. Incredibly short at under 1 hour 25 minutes, The Hitcher might have been over priced for theaters. Do however, look for the recent DVD release in your video store's sale bin.Now back to Sean Bean. Despite being a horror enthusiast, I wouldn't have picked up The Hitcher for rising stars Sophia Bush or Zachary Knighton. Even cult favorite Neal McDonough (Star Trek: First Contact) was a pleasant surprise, but I won't kid you-I bought The Hitcher for the 48 year old Bean. Once considered by fans as the most beloved Hauer film, The Hitcher now belongs to Sean Bean.The Hitcher's story begins when college cuties Grace Andrews (Bush) and Jim Halsey (Knighton) take off across the American Southwest for Spring Break-in a classic 442 no less. Unfortunately, after encountering seemingly pedestrian hitchhiker John Ryder (Bean), their lives quickly turn to carnage, terror, and high speed pursuit. Ryder initially attacks the couple, but they manage to escape him- only to find he has killed others and is framing them for his rampage. New Mexico State Police Lieutenant Eldridge (McDonough) pursues Grace and Jim-who look more and more like the killers with every turn.I have to admit, I first though Sophia Bush to be one of President Bush's daughters! Young starlets are so interchangeable in Hollywood today, and the B horror flick is often where new names perfect their death scene antics. The One Tree Hill star does hold her own here in the otherwise all male cast. Of course she looks the pretty for the part, but Bush carries an untraditional edge and non-blonde bimbo look that fits the ballsy chick here. Nothing against TV guester Zachary Knighton, but his performance was a dime a dozen. Screenwriter Eric Red was smart to turn this version's focus on Grace-as opposed to the original's hold on C. Thomas Howell's Halsey. It's 2007, yet Knighton's look harkens back to the nineties grunge and skater style. I didn't find it attractive then, and I certainly don't believe this Jim will be the star of Spring Break any time soon. Whether it's poor skill or by design, here Jim is a limp fish next to Bean's Ryder.While not exactly a sex symbol in the US in his day, Bean's psycho turn here is nonetheless the most attractive thing in The Hitcher. Yes he's older now, and well, he does have a big nose, but Bean's command of these college kids is evident from the moment they almost hit him on the road. The complexity of Ryder-who is he? Where does he come from? What does he want?- is more interesting than seeing if Grace and Jim make it. It's a horror flick-we know someone isn't going to survive-but in some part of the back of your mind, you want that tawdry ending where Ryder walks off into the sunset to nab another wayward couple.Although I expected the film to be billed as `And Sean Bean as The Hitcher', he is rightfully given top billing, followed by Sophia Bush. He's twice her age-old enough to be her father-yet Bean and Bush (hee) have some interesting chemistry onscreen. Maybe as a woman it's the fear of rape, or perhaps its my one to many viewings of Bean in the steamy Lady Chatterley, but I was routing for physical action between these two for the duration. You can't have a rugged, mean Bean and a short skirted Bush without some rough potential. Meyer does give the audience a fine balance of hints and foreplay and lots of f-bombed dialogue. Kudos also to whoever decided to give Sheffield born and bred Sean an American accent. Knowing his true and definitely British accent is being hidden here adds to Ryder's creepiness. If even that isn't true about Ryder, what else is there lying there, waiting?While I haven't seen the Rutger Hauer version of The Hitcher in some time, the 2007 version reminds me more of Stephen Spielberg's early road rage classic Duel. Bean's performance is akin to Duel's crazy and dubious tractor trailer more so than Hauer. For myself, Blade Runner is the creepy Hauer flick and Ladyhawke is my favorite of his films. Hauer's most iconic moment in The Hitcher, however, now belongs to Sean Bean. The `late model black thunderbird' car chase and shoot `em up has even my honey rooting for villainous Bean.I'm a bit tired of remakes and sequels, and it's a double edged sword to know The Hitcher is in Matthew Cohan's line of horror revisits. On one hand, the story is very familiar, but then again, Cohan and his team have seemed to perfect the art of maintaining the best of the original and infusing it with modern filmmaking. The visuals and creative deaths in this Hitcher could not have been done in the eighties. Lighting, however, seems to suffer for Meyer's fast paced music video style. Sometimes The Hitcher is almost too dark to see anything. Sure maybe it adds to atmosphere or mood, but we want to watch the action in the creepy desert jailhouse. Equally jarring is Meyer's cuts to outside action. Beautiful open desert shots have even the actors noticeably squinting.Another place The Hitcher misses more than hits is its somewhat low body count. Indeed perhaps it is even too short for its own horror/car chase genre. Near the end of the film, I found myself missing ensemble horror road trip films- where one by one the nobodys and bimbos are picked off. It might have been interesting to see Grace and Jim with a buddy couple who meets their end courtesy of John Ryder-or perhaps that scenario could have put the film beyond believability. The Hitcher is also partially undone with its over simple dialogue. Some of it is really great-Eldridge's hick cop banter and Ryder's ambiguous one liners bring humor and food for thought, but our couple utters too many cries along the lines of `What does he want? Why is he doing this?'. Even the bullseye gem `I'll be back in 15 minutes' makes a cameo.Although The Hitcher came and went in theaters, I expected the DVD release to have more features than it does. There's an up close segment on Knighton and his definitive bloodfest scene, plus a detailed behind the scenes look with the complete cast and crew. For fans who want to know the ins and outs of all the car stunts-here it is. I was, however, disappointed with the deleted scenes and alternate ending. Outtakes would have been a real treat, but instead we get four different versions of how one hotel room scene could have gone down. Indeed deleted scenes are usually deleted for a reason, and the way that hotel room scene is finalized in the film is the superior outcome.The alternate ending was a little over the top for theaters-as the cover promised-but not nearly as extreme as it could have been. The highlight of the features for me was Sophia Bush confessing she was really afraid of Sean Bean!If you don't like spooks, cars, and gore, then The Hitcher is not for you. Are there scarier and more gory horror films out there? More serious and hard core action, high speed thrillers? Of course, but you can't find solid acting and character complexity in Jason X.Perhaps what is the creepiest thing about The Hitcher is that this kind of road rage can happen and does happen. This film is a must see for Sean Bean fans or Sophia Bush lovers. Perhaps the question is not to purchase this DVD, but rather what would you do if one of the S.B.s was thumbing for a ride on your street?",3,Bean steals it,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,8412,"['Who',

Lots and lots and lots of gore and blood, but not very scary.  Sean Bean does a good job at every evil character I've seen him in, including this one.  But the gore doesn't seem to have a purpose, and in fact when Sean's character is asked why he kills, he answers ""Why not?""  'Why not' is the theme of the movie: why not have some more blood? why not have some extra gore?  why not have a shorter skirt?  There isn't really a plot or a mystery, just lots of killing.

1058125,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000NO3DLG,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[16, 19]","""The Hitcher"" is a so-so film that desperately wants to be a killer music video.  Starring Sophia Bush (thatOne Tree Hillgirl who is so pretty it makes my eyes water) and Zachary Knighton (I'd never heard of him before, but he looks like the type who'd date Sophia Bush), the film wastes no time with pleasantries.  The two lovers hit the road, and then the road hits back.The road in my oh-so-clever analogy turns out to be John Ryder, the hitcher, a man with a grudge against life.  Literally.  In one of his first lines of the film, Ryder admits that the reason he tortures, maims, and kills people is because he wants someone to stop him.  This sort of Swiftean take on nihilism is often used by scriptwriters to give a character license to indulge in flat-eyed melodrama (emotive beef jerky, I call it), but Sean Bean -- as the unflagging madman -- lets his desperation and his senseless rage simmer without boiling over into false theatrics.  Bean is really the reason to watch this film.It's too bad he's not in it more than he is.  Most of the time we are forced to watch Bush and Knighton wander around making typically bad decisions and then griping or whining about it to each other when there's a break in the action.I don't blame the actors.  These sorts of brash bonanzas of violence and destruction don't really need much in the way of plotting to do their job, but they do need some kind of decent writing.  I mean, take a look at Spielberg'sDuel.  For a movie with such a minimal plot and perhaps two pages of dialogue, this film works macabre magic.  ""The Hitcher,"" in lieu of compelling characters and a solid build-up of tension has, instead, the rat-a-tat-tat subtlety (and pace) of a semi-automatic.  Short bursts of loud chaos, interspersed with brief moments of silence.  You don't want that barrel to melt.I give the film a thumbs up for its dervishes, for the car chases (set to blaringNine Inch Nails), the near-misses, and the bold direct hits (I'll admit that I was shocked and surprised by the scene with the semi-truck and the chains).  But, just like the (lack of) beliefs of the title character, the movie doesn't seem to care about much of anything, making it easy for the viewer to feel likewise.",3,Road-Killer,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2231,"['Hitcher', 'so-so', 'film', 'desperately', 'be', 'killer', 'music', 'video', 'Starring', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'thatOne', 'Tree', 'Hillgirl', 'who', 'so', 'pretty', 'eyes', 'water', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'type', 'who', ""'d"", 'date', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'film', 'time', 'pleasantries', 'two', 'lovers', 'hit', 'road', 'then', 'road', 'back.The', 'road', 'oh-so-clever', 'analogy', 'out', 'be', 'John', 'Ryder', 'hitcher', 'man', 'grudge', 'life', 'Literally', 'one', 'first', 'lines', 'film', 'Ryder', 'reason', 'maims', 'kills', 'people', 'someone', 'stop', 'sort', 'Swiftean', 'take', 'nihilism', 'often', 'used', 'scriptwriters', 'give', 'character', 'license', 'indulge', 'flat-eyed', 'melodrama', 'emotive', 'beef', 'jerky', 'call', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'unflagging', 'madman', 'desperation', 'senseless', 'rage', 'simmer', 'boiling', 'over', 'false', 'theatrics', 'Bean', 'really', 'reason', 'watch', 'film.It', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'more', 'Most', 'time', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'Bush', 'Knighton', 'wander', 'making', 'typically', 'bad', 'decisions', 'then', 'griping', 'whining', 'other', 'when', 'break', 'action.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'sorts', 'brash', 'bonanzas', 'violence', 'destruction', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'much', 'way', 'plotting', 'do', 'job', 'do', 'need', 'kind', 'decent', 'writing', 'mean', 'take', 'look', ""Spielberg'sDuel"", 'movie', 'minimal', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'two', 'pages', 'dialogue', 'film', 'macabre', 'magic', 'Hitcher', 'lieu', 'compelling', 'characters', 'solid', 'build-up', 'tension', 'instead', 'rat-a-tat-tat', 'subtlety', 'pace', 'semi-automatic', 'Short', 'bursts', 'loud', 'chaos', 'interspersed', 'brief', 'moments', 'silence', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'barrel', 'melt.I', 'give', 'film', 'thumbs', 'up', 'dervishes', 'car', 'chases', 'set', 'blaringNine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'near-misses', 'bold', 'direct', 'hits', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'scene', 'semi-truck', 'chains', 'just', 'lack', 'beliefs', 'title', 'character', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'about', 'much', 'anything', 'making', 'easy', 'viewer', 'feel', 'likewise']",N/A

Whaaaa?  Yu wan exampoo?  Well, first off the movie starts with the male character allegedly picking up the female character at her... dorm?  Sorority?  The exterior shot is of what is clearly a lecture hall.  So we, the movie-going public are supposed to just not get too critical.  Hey, howz about Romeo picks Juliette up at a Greyhound bus station and then asks her about her flight?  That be swell?  Anyhoo, so Romeo and Juliette hit the road so that Romeo can dramatically, cathartically, all-importantly ""meet the girls"" -- that is, meet Juliette's friends during... spring break at Lake Havasu.  (no, I'm not making this up.  Apparently we are supposed to be on board with the idea of Romeo ""meeting the girls"" while swilling down beers and going, ""Whooooooooo!""  This, apparently is the younger generations' idea of quality social interaction.) Seemingly, we are not supposed to find this vulgar and aggravatedly shallow.  We are supposed to... want them not to die?  Anyway, so then they pick up the Hitcher, who begins to terrorize them mucho, and rightly so.  Romeo, when the Hitcher pulls a blade on him in the car, begins to cry.  So much for role-modeling.  The Hitcher then puts said blade to the eye of Juliette and says something to the effect of, ""If you don't want me to do it, say 'I want to die'"" at which point Juliette blurts out, ""Don't say it!""  This is where I stopped watching and put on Shall We Dance in order to heal.  Ginger Rogers, toward the end of her life, said she refused to go to movies anymore.  She said, ""They're not going to get my money to see the junk that's made today.""  Comparing The Hitcher with Shall We Dance both saddened and enraged me.

to admit, some remakes are actually good  (Amityville Horror, Dark Knight), & of course this one...I never intended to see this one, having spent my teen years watching the original 1986 film with Rutger Hauer as the menacing ""Hitcher""..I just felt his performance could never be topped, boy was I wrong, Sean Bean (Goldeneye, Flightplan, Troy) is just as menacing if not worse as the vengeful ""Hitcher""...I caught this one on T.V. awhile back expecting to hate it, & to my surprise I liked it a little better than the original 1986 film, below are  the things I like better with this one compared to the originalSean Bean's evil performance...yes even outdoes Rutger Hauer just a bit, hate to say it, but he doesSophia Bush is just downright gorgeous...she alone is reason enough to like this one, but her eventual takedown of Bean at the very end is satisfying..I like the idea of a couple being terrorized rather than a lone guy like in the original film....you really didn't fear for C.Thomas Howell in the original as much, simply because he was alone, however this Jim Halsey has a girlfriend (Bush) & you feel a sense of fear in this guy, not only for himself but for her as well, much like the Kurt Russell film ""Breakdown""Neal McDonough is more convincing as a angry Captain Esteridge when Bean is caught, unlike Jeffery DeMunn's character in the original who displayed almost no emotion for his men who had been killed early onThe pursuit sequence where Halsey & Bush are under fire by state police is very reminisent of the original film with Howell & Jennifer Jason Leigh under fire, Bean like Hauer kills the pursuing police..but in this one the song ""Closer"" by Nine Inch Nails plays in the background as Bean dispatches the cops..the song does fit the scene believe it or not...& the car pile ups are upped a bit hereThe motel sequence where Halsey & Bush seek refuge is a bit more erotic as Halsey & Bush comfort each other in the shower, Halsey is dispatched in pretty much the same way Leigh was in the original....I am so glad it wasn't Bush who was killed, however this death scene is one scene I wish they hadn't done again, but the scene where Bean sneaks into her bed & tries to rape her is scary & funny at the same time as you realize he just might be toying with her instead, it is never clear if raping her was his intention...what is clear is that he just as deranged as Hauer's original ""Hitcher""...in some ways this one could more or less be considered a sequel if not for the original film's repeated moments...however I tend to like this one a bit better...but the original is just as good too, Rutger Huaer will always be the original ""Hitcher"", but Sean Bean more than outdoes his performance.",4,If anyone can match Rutger Hauer's

A few years ago there was a terrible, direct to DVD sequel, but it was nowhere as bad as this pointless remake.  Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Goldeneye, Silent Hill) is John Ryder; a psychotic hitchiker who is picked up by a young couple (Sophia Bush, Zach Knighton) who he soon terrorizes to escalating heights.  The biggest difference between this remake and the original?  Bean is not frightening in the very least.  He's quite a good actor in his own right to be sure, but his hammy performance here is is nowhere near anything we've seen in the past from him.  Not to mention that the film has no sense of tension, and the most infamous and memorable part of the original film is re-worked here to zero effect; the impact of which is laughable here to boot.  Bush is nothing more than a pretty face with little acting chops and is unconvincing to say the least, while the rest of the film itself is just sloppy in nearly every department.

I mean, the basics are here: creepy hitchhiker, young Samaritan, etc. But this version of the movie is nowhere near as subtle as it probably should be.There are some significant changes - the eponymous hitcher is now terrorizing a young woman along with the young man. There is a lot more blood and gore (which really is just a sign of the times, as far as I'm concerned). And sadly enough, there almost seems to be less purpose. As if we are simply supposed to take at face value the fact that there is this crazy man and he's terrorizing these kids and blahblahblah.One big problem I have is that the hitcher - ""John Ryder"" (LOTR trilogy's Sean Bean) - is about two steps away from being a freakin' supervillain. There is a body count of at least 20 or so people here....all tagged by Ryder, seemingly without much in the way of effort. He does away with these folks like he's simply swatting flies or kicking puppies. And the reasoning? Who knows? There isn't enough given in the manner of reasoning.The kids aren't bad. Of course they do tons of stuff that the standard person outside of a horror movie would NEVER do, but that's par for the course. By the way, how come no one ever takes a quick, hassle-free plane ride anymore? They all wanna drive across the most remote regions of the country.My other major problem is that the most memorable  (at least to me) moment of the original film is recreated here...and then some. It's one thing to include the most notable scene in the movie...but couldn't we have had a bit more in the way of subtlety? Yeah, I know we all like things to be amazingly realistic and gruesome nowadays, but I really think the moment could have benefited from a touch more discretion. The way it was done, I kind of just sat there and though ""Oh wow. Look at that.""There were good things about the movie. I really liked the lighting.

It duplicates the action of the 1999 Rutger Hauer version fairly closely, right down to the loping, bloody-jawed dogs in the police station. However this Hitcher attempts one crucial, modernizing twist. I'm not sure that the twist gives enough of a new slant on the action though to justify this re-make.Sean Bean inherits Hauer's mantle as the inexorable killer here. He has a suitably chilling, chiseled look for the role. But the rest of the cast doesn't inspire the kind of sympathy that put us on the edge of our seats, fearing for their fate, in the earlier movie. The young man whom Bean singles out to bring his killing spree to endgame isn't given sufficient depth of vulnerable goodness this time around.Perhaps what most diminishes this movie though is the amount of road-rage swearing that goes on. As in most movies that play for youthful appeal this way, the language just ends up trivializing the movie's characters and their tragic encounters. When faced with such diabolical evil as the Hitcher, it seems almost silly to respond with four-letter indignation. Stunned silence would be more appropriate and more moving.However getting this DVD wouldn't be a complete waste. If you can't easily get hold of the original, this will deliver some scares and some gruesome visuals.

But it's very well done. There are some over-the-top stunts that would have killed any ordinary serial killer. But that was part of the mystique of John Ryder. Was he human? Was he a monster? Was he the Devil?The Hitcher's director in 1986 was Robert Harmon, who pretty much tuned to TV after The Hitcher, which is probably a good thing because the ""TV camp"" definitely came through in a lot of his original version of The Hitcher, but overall it was exciting and unforgettable.Fast Forward 21 years and music video Director Dave Meyers re-does 1986's The Hitcher with an all new cast and a few minor story changes. Yes...I said ""re-does"" as opposed to ""re-makes"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2007 version of The Hitcher is a re-do.While the 2007 version definitely does take the 80s feel out of the original, it also takes a lot out of the fiendish, classic villain that was created by Rutger Hauer. Sean Bean is in the role of John Ryder in the 2007 version. Yes, Bean has played his share of villains, so he had no problem as a bad guy in The Hitcher 2007, but it was like taking Robert Englund out of Freddy Krueger...it just wasn't the same.Look, I'm not a big preservationist that thinks remaking good original movies should be taboo.

No remorse, apparantly no fear of death or pain, disturbingly with no apparant motivation, indisputably evil, and yet retaining an undeniable charismatic edge, as well as a huge air of mystery (his background, and even his real name, are never revealed) the character slashes and shotgun-blasts his way into the upper tier as one of the most instantly memorable killers to rampage across the screen in recent years. Zachary Knighton and the smolderingly gorgeous and cute-as-a-button Sophia Bush are likable and believable as the main couple of the film.  Strong performances are turned in by the rest of the cast as well, and the tight flow of the movie encompasses psychological terror and suspense, up-close visceral carnage, and some of the most intense and high-octane highway chase/battle action ever seen, way above that seen in many higher profile action blockbusters with five times the budget.

While the 2007 remake reverses a few roles and certainly updates the gore, it still manages to maintain the unnerving mood of its predecessor and stays surprisingly entertaining throughout its tightly paced 83 minutes.The Hitcher wastes no time with introductions and jumps right into the typical ""college students on a road trip to nowhere"" slasher film requisite. The difference this time out is that there are only two young protagonists, Jim (Zachary Knighton) and Grace (Sophia Bush). Not more than ten minutes in, the weather has gone from cheerful sun to foreboding rainstorm and the couple barely miss running over a hitchhiker standing in the middle of the road. Shortly after deciding to leave the mysterious figure stranded, Jim encounters him in a gas station and against Grace's objections, agrees to take him to the nearest motel. A casual conversation with their newly acquired passenger suddenly turns sour and the hitcher, John Ryder (Sean Bean) reveals himself to be a psychotic madman determined to draw some blood. After a narrow escape, the stunned couple begin a treacherous trek across the desolate New Mexico highway where they attempt to put as much ground between themselves and their tormentor as possible.

1058162,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000NO3DLG,trebe,"[0, 0]","The remake of the 1986 cult favorite The Hitcher (2007), is fast paced, violent, and skews towards a younger demo.  The story features a couple of new twists, but sticks pretty close to the original, though it doesn't have quite the same dark edge.  Sean Bean is not bad as the menacing hitchhiker John Ryder, but he just doesn't bring the same kind of evil menace to the role that Rutger Hauer did.Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) and his girlfriend Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) are at a service station in New Mexico, when they agree to give John Ryder a lift.  Travelling at night in a rainstorm, the stranger pulls a knife, but fortunately the couple manage to eject him from the car.  The next day, the couple spot Ryder in the back seat of a station wagon, but when they try and warn the travelers, they end up crashing their car.  Later they find the family massacred, and under arrest suspected of murder.The Hitcher dogs the couple's every move, forcing them into more desperate situations.  He butchers the officers in the police station, leaving the couple suspected of additional murders.  When the cops are about to recapture them, the Hitcher strikes again, taking out three police cars and a chopper.  This sets the stage for the movie's biggest twist, as Grace assumes the lead role.  The finish bears some similarities to The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting (2003) the sequel to the original film, where Hasley's girlfriend played by Kari Wurher, uses a shotgun to dispatch the Hitcher.With the original movies as guides, the remake is a very solid and grisly retelling, with the focus more on the couple's plight, rather than one man's torment.  There is plenty of mayhem and well executed destruction, as Sophia Bush does a good job of standing up to a madman.",3,still the wrong guy to give a ride...,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1773,"['remake', '1986', 'cult', 'favorite', 'Hitcher', '2007', 'fast', 'paced', 'violent', 'towards', 'younger', 'demo', 'story', 'couple', 'new', 'twists', 'sticks', 'pretty', 'close', 'original', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'dark', 'edge', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'not', 'bad', 'menacing', 'hitchhiker', 'John', 'Ryder', 'just', ""n't"", 'bring', 'same', 'kind', 'evil', 'menace', 'role', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'did.Jim', 'Halsey', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Andrews', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'are', 'service', 'station', 'New', 'Mexico', 'when', 'agree', 'give', 'John', 'Ryder', 'lift', 'Travelling', 'night', 'rainstorm', 'stranger', 'knife', 'fortunately', 'couple', 'manage', 'eject', 'car', 'next', 'day', 'couple', 'spot', 'Ryder', 'back', 'seat', 'station', 'wagon', 'when', 'try', 'warn', 'travelers', 'end', 'up', 'crashing', 'car', 'Later', 'find', 'family', 'massacred', 'arrest', 'suspected', 'murder.The', 'Hitcher', 'couple', 'move', 'forcing', 'more', 'desperate', 'situations', 'officers', 'police', 'station', 'leaving', 'couple', 'suspected', 'additional', 'murders', 'When', 'cops', 'are', 'recapture', 'Hitcher', 'strikes', 'again', 'taking', 'out', 'three', 'police', 'cars', 'chopper', 'stage', 'movie', 'biggest', 'twist', 'Grace', 'lead', 'role', 'finish', 'similarities', 'Hitcher', 'II', ""'ve"", 'Been', 'Waiting', '2003', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'where', 'Hasley', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Kari', 'Wurher', 'shotgun', 'dispatch', 'Hitcher.With', 'original', 'movies', 'guides', 'remake', 'very', 'solid', 'grisly', 'retelling', 'focus', 'more', 'couple', 'plight', 'rather', 'one', 'man', 'torment', 'plenty', 'mayhem', 'well', 'executed', 'destruction', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'good', 'job', 'standing', 'up', 'madman']",N/A
1058163,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NO3DLG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","You know you just cannot expect anything subtle from this Michael Bay-produced remake of ""The Hitcher."" What this violent thriller (even more violent and gory than the original) says is very simple; don't you ever pick up a stranger, especially when that stranger is a psychopathic serial killer.The original's setting has been slightly changed for the remake (though most of the episodes remain). This time a female lead played by Sophia Bush is given a more substantial role than the male counterpart by Zachary Knighton. The newer version also has more actions like car chases that seem to have come directly from ""Bad Boys II."" Technically all these stunts are more than satisfactory, but what about the story, or scares?It depends. Sean Bean is the titular ""Hitcher"" or a John Ryder, a role once played by Rutger Hauer. Blue-eyed Hauer gave a creepy performance as Ryder, who sometimes looked like a supernatural presence, but Sean Bean's chilling performance here is not bad although I believe Hollywood is guilty of typecasting him again and again.What is really disappointing is the script. I don't usually care if there are plot holes in this kind of thriller, but here when you think these young heroine and hero often act stupidly, the local police enter and they turn out to be more stupid and inefficient. I cannot tell you much about it, but how many times should we see someone hiding in a toilet? OK, I know some people do unreasonable things in real life, but when their actions start to look like clich&eacute;, perhaps we should suspect that something is wrong with the story.Without the original's metaphorical approach to the villain, Sean Bean's John Ryder is more like a cross between The Terminator and Martin Riggs, the suicidal hero of ""The Lethal Weapon."" The film is shot beautifully and the director narrates the story slickly, but without the atmosphere of the first one, the remake is more like a mindless B horror action film, entertaining in its own way.",3,(2.5 STARS) Yet Another Unnecessary Remake -- Entertaining in Its Gory Way Though,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1987,"['know', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'subtle', 'Michael', 'Bay-produced', 'remake', 'Hitcher', 'What', 'violent', 'thriller', 'even', 'more', 'violent', 'gory', 'original', 'very', 'simple', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'stranger', 'especially', 'when', 'stranger', 'psychopathic', 'serial', 'killer.The', 'original', 'setting', 'been', 'slightly', 'changed', 'remake', 'most', 'episodes', 'remain', 'time', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'given', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Zachary', 'Knighton', 'newer', 'version', 'also', 'more', 'actions', 'car', 'chases', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'directly', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'Technically', 'stunts', 'are', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'what', 'story', 'scares', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'titular', 'Hitcher', 'John', 'Ryder', 'role', 'once', 'played', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Blue-eyed', 'Hauer', 'gave', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Ryder', 'who', 'sometimes', 'looked', 'supernatural', 'presence', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'chilling', 'performance', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'believe', 'Hollywood', 'guilty', 'typecasting', 'again', 'again.What', 'really', 'disappointing', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'kind', 'thriller', 'here', 'when', 'think', 'young', 'heroine', 'hero', 'often', 'act', 'stupidly', 'local', 'police', 'enter', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'stupid', 'inefficient', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'much', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'should', 'see', 'someone', 'hiding', 'toilet', 'OK', 'know', 'people', 'do', 'unreasonable', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'actions', 'start', 'look', 'clich', 'eacute', 'perhaps', 'should', 'suspect', 'something', 'wrong', 'story.Without', 'original', 'metaphorical', 'approach', 'villain', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'John', 'Ryder', 'more', 'cross', 'Terminator', 'Martin', 'Riggs', 'suicidal', 'hero', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'director', 'story', 'slickly', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'one', 'remake', 'more', 'mindless', 'B', 'horror', 'action', 'film', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way']",N/A

1058165,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000NO3DLG,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 2]","When it comes to horror remakes, I tend to immediately write them off. Typically, if the writer, director, and producers of a horror remake had enough skill to pull off a powerful film like whatever the original they're remaking is, you'd think they'd be writing an original... that being said, The Hitcher remake was a pretty decent horror thriller. There's no point comparing it to the original too extensively because the original is a classic.The new story has a young couple (two talented Unkowns) travelling from Texas to California for him to meet her friends. As they're driving through the rain the first night he manages to barely miss a hitchhiker standing on the side of the road. He makes them nervous and luckily they speed away before he can get into the car. Thus we are introduced to John Ryder (Sean Bean).The plot unfolds in the way you'd expect with them meeting up later with said Hitcher and violence and mayhem ensuing. Although the acting is great, the cinematography is gorgeous, the stunts are phenomenal, and the surprises are real, there's just a bit of an edge that's missing to keep the plot driving. The audience finds themselves questioning why our heroes are running from the police when they've got each other to back their stories up.The film really loses steam in the last quarter of the film, when things go from surprising and interesting to typical horror schlock and gore. There's an awkwardly unnessecary shower scene (with no nudity) and then the recreation of the infamous semi scene, that just doesn't work out as well as it could have.Overall, The Hitcher is definitely enjoyable and not a let down for anyone who enjoys a good popcorn horror flick, but it's no classic and it doesn't posess any lasting qualities to it.The special features are extensive and include several ""making ofs"", including stunts, gore, and directing. It's all pretty interesting but you'd have to like the movie quite a bit to watch it all.",3,Pretty decent horror thriller,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1962,"['When', 'horror', 'remakes', 'tend', 'immediately', 'write', 'off', 'Typically', 'writer', 'director', 'producers', 'horror', 'remake', 'had', 'enough', 'skill', 'pull', 'off', 'powerful', 'film', 'whatever', 'original', ""'re"", 'remaking', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'writing', 'original', 'being', 'said', 'Hitcher', 'remake', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'thriller', 'point', 'comparing', 'original', 'too', 'extensively', 'original', 'classic.The', 'new', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'two', 'talented', 'Unkowns', 'travelling', 'Texas', 'California', 'meet', 'friends', ""'re"", 'driving', 'rain', 'first', 'night', 'barely', 'miss', 'hitchhiker', 'standing', 'side', 'road', 'nervous', 'luckily', 'speed', 'away', 'can', 'get', 'car', 'are', 'introduced', 'John', 'Ryder', 'Sean', 'Bean', '.The', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'meeting', 'up', 'later', 'said', 'Hitcher', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'ensuing', 'acting', 'great', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'stunts', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'surprises', 'are', 'real', 'just', 'bit', 'edge', 'missing', 'keep', 'plot', 'driving', 'audience', 'questioning', 'why', 'heroes', 'are', 'running', 'police', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'other', 'back', 'stories', 'film', 'really', 'steam', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'typical', 'horror', 'schlock', 'gore', 'awkwardly', 'unnessecary', 'shower', 'scene', 'nudity', 'then', 'recreation', 'infamous', 'semi', 'scene', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have.Overall', 'Hitcher', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'popcorn', 'horror', 'flick', 'classic', ""n't"", 'posess', 'lasting', 'qualities', 'it.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'extensive', 'include', 'several', 'making', 'ofs', 'including', 'stunts', 'gore', 'directing', 'pretty', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'have', 'like', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'watch']",N/A
