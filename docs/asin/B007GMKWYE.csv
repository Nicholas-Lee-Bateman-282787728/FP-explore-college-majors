I really liked the classic show & knew this one would be better animated, more realistic but just as fun.Well, I was partially right.I'm not sure what the problem with the series is exactly.  Is it the bland animation? Is it the lack of the classic designs?  Is it the fact that these bland characters are nothing like their classic (and charismatic) counterparts (Zartan & the Dreadnok being the worst examples)?  All those things contribute to the problem but the simple fact is...this series is just boring, uninspired.I'll tune-in to Season 2 to see if this show starts to feel like the G.I. Joe I grew to love but I won't be holding my breath.",2,Boring & kinda stupid.,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,712,"['When', 'heard', 'new', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'series', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'thrilled', 'really', 'liked', 'classic', 'show', 'knew', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'animated', 'more', 'realistic', 'just', 'as', 'fun.Well', 'was', 'partially', 'right.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'problem', 'series', 'exactly', 'bland', 'animation', 'lack', 'classic', 'designs', 'fact', 'bland', 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'classic', 'charismatic', 'counterparts', 'Zartan', 'Dreadnok', 'being', 'worst', 'examples', 'things', 'contribute', 'problem', 'simple', 'fact', 'series', 'just', 'boring', 'uninspired.I', ""'ll"", 'tune-in', 'Season', '2', 'see', 'show', 'feel', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'grew', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'holding', 'breath']","G.I.

This DVD brought back memories and it was so cute to watch my boys enjoy this series.  The characters are traditional G.I. Joe characters and they are trying to expose the COBRA bad guys.  My boys are only 3 and 5 years old and didn't really understand the dialogue but a 7 year old or so would probably love this DVD.  This set includes two discs and a total of 13 episodes.  My boys wanted to watch one after another and I admit I followed the storyline.,5,Brought back memories!,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,525,"['have', 'younger', 'brothers', 'remember', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'back', 'day', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'was', 'so', 'cute', 'watch', 'boys', 'enjoy', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'traditional', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'expose', 'COBRA', 'bad', 'guys', 'boys', 'are', 'only', '3', '5', 'years', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'dialogue', '7', 'year', 'old', 'so', 'would', 'probably', 'love', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'discs', 'total', '13', 'episodes', 'boys', 'wanted', 'watch', 'one', 'admit', 'followed', 'storyline']","G.I.

This new series brought a whole new dynamic to the G.I Joe franchise which was great!

1530677,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B007GMKWYE,Grimluke,"[0, 0]","I have been a fan of G.I. Joe for a long time, but even I must admit that alternate versions of this popular franchise have been hit-or-miss. The DIC show was awful, Sigma 6 was awkward, and the live-action movies are good, but could be better. Anyways, this is the first animated series of G.I. Joe in a while, and despite some questionable character designs before the show's release, I still anticipated the new arrival in the G.I. Joe lore. (by now it's not exactly &#34;new&#34;, but I was watching it when it WAS new. It just took me a while to write this review) I am happy to say that wait was completely worth it!Animation: Like I said: the character designs are unusual, but they're pretty easy to get used to. And considering that most shows are either CGI or poor 2D animated, this show is pretty refreshing.Story: The Joes are accused of blowing up a Cobra Factory in Springfield, when in truth, Cobra is the true enemy (not a real shocker to long-time Joe fans) and the Joes need to expose them for what they REALLY are. It's very A-Team-esque, but as the plot thickens, things begin to become more interesting. Plus, it's very character-driven, which is not a bad thing when you have such great characters.Voice acting: The voice acting is the best since the Sunbow animated series of the 1980s. I never saw Jason Marsden as Duke material, but his talent is second only to Michael Bell.  Other notable roles include Charlie Adler as Cobra Commander, Kevin Michael Richardson as Roadblock, and Clancy Brown as Destro. The other voices are also very good at their roles and are nearly perfectly casted.In the end this IS my favorite version of the Joes (right above Larry Hama's comic versions which are very similar in some cases). Everything is just right, and it exceeds both live-action (and the disappointing animated) films. And this doesn't just go for volume 1! Volume 2 is just as good! I still hope that they continue this series (despite how unlikely it is). Final Score: 9.1.",5,Yo Joe!

Nearly all of the characters have been reworked, and actually I think the serious would have been better had it not been a Gi Joe series at all (however it would have been odd to have a silent ninja around). That said, once I started watching I was able to disconnect the comics from this alternate GI Joe universe it was quite fun. It is clearly influenced by the Ateam premise of a group of innocent soldiers wanted ""for a crime they didn't commit"", and my son even thought Roadblock was Mr T. But we like the Ateam, so that wasn't an issue. It is a little bland, though. Im not exactly sure how to put it, but it just seems a bit gray emotionally.

1530680,ANVHI0F1WI1X7,B007GMKWYE,"Onyx ""whitemale""","[1, 1]","While the premise is pretty much stolen from the A-Team, the plot is still true to the hearty spirit of GI Joe. The Joe cast is small consisting primarily of Scarlett, Snake-eyes, Roadblock, Duke and Tunnelrat. Main villains are Cobra Commander, Destro, Dr. Mindbender and the Baroness, with the Baroness really shining. There is no Pitt with legions of Joes running around. There is also no Cobra island (as far as we know) Cobra is a respected corporation. Flint fills the role of ""Decker"" with Lady Jaye as his aid. There are cameos by other Joes during the series. The downside: The series draws somewhat from the lousy live action movie - hence the lame appearances of Cobra Commander (no hood) and Storm Shadow ( worst Storm Shadow costume ever) The upside: The series also draws somewhat from the comic history eg the Ashikage backstory. The whole series is very atmospheric and character driven. All characters are in character and recognisable to old school fans. Action scenes are fast and dynamic most especially the ""ninja sequences"" fearturing Snake-eyes. Snake-eyes alone makes this worth the purchase.

I really loved their reinterpretation of the Joe mythology and how all the characters were introduced.It was great to see Zartan looking like Zartan again and the exploration of some real struggles soldiers deal with in terms of losing close friends. The live-action movie was clearly made by a director / producers too old to grasp that GI Joe became so popular not just because it was a bunch of fun characters blowing stuff up but because of their unique personalities and dynamics with one another. This series captured that spirit in an interesting new way.***SPOILER SPOILER***My only real gripe is how it ended. I thought all the Joe characters we had met in various episodes throughout the series would be called upon for an epic final showdown with Cobra and then Flint would come around and bring them all on board. Instead, the sci-fi took over too much (some is fine) and everyone was just standing there in a big group next to Flint.
