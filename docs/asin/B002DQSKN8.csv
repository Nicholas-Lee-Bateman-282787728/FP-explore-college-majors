They used to much footage from Stingray (80s TV Series) and did not realy come up with the Action it says on the box. It is sometimes boring.

1263963,A3H74UM0GHP12H,B002DQSKN8,"Lita Fan ""clamdandys""","[6, 15]",It appears these people never saw the Stingray series in the 80s That's where most of the vehicles were taken from. I also noticed Nick Mancuso Driving the vehicles the editing is really lousy especially some scenes are blurred to try to make the footage from Stingray look new. Also there was a helicopter explosion taken from wiseguy as well. If they are going to make a series use real vehicles not recycled footage from old shows.,1,What a Complete RipOff!,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,434,"['people', 'never', 'saw', 'Stingray', 'series', '80s', 'where', 'most', 'vehicles', 'were', 'taken', 'also', 'noticed', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'Driving', 'vehicles', 'editing', 'really', 'lousy', 'especially', 'scenes', 'are', 'blurred', 'try', 'make', 'footage', 'Stingray', 'look', 'new', 'Also', 'was', 'helicopter', 'explosion', 'taken', 'wiseguy', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'series', 'use', 'real', 'vehicles', 'not', 'recycled', 'footage', 'old', 'shows']",Cobra - The Complete Series

1263965,A202FL2VAJS6AM,B002DQSKN8,"Nadia ""Nadia""","[22, 22]","This series is about a crime fighting organization called COBRA founded by the father of Danielle LaPoint, the lady portrayed by Allison Hossack.  Michael Dudikoff (""Scandal"" Jackson) stars as an ex-navy SEAL, and James Tolkan (Dallas Cassel) stars as Head of Cobra (an ex-FBI agent).  I got hooked on this series from the beginning.  Unfortunately it didn't last long.  Casting was absolutely perfect--especially James Tolkan as the head of Cobra and Michael Dudikoff.  The writing was absolutely super, all was absolutely great--fabulous & mesmerising episodes.  The only thing wrong was the audience that didn't appreciate this series.There was humor, there was wisdom, there was intensity, mystery, action, suspense--everything--PLUS an AWESOME car, cute guy & pretty girl--I have no idea what cheesy dialogue some people are talking about--this series has great humor, wisdom and everything else that goes with a great series--there is no crudity, nothing that your teenager could not watch.  It is great writing, great television, and as I said, the only thing that didn't work was the audience unable to appreciate a work of television art.This series is intense & mysterious without crudity as many of the popular shows today--it's decent--perfect for anyone.Perfect for a gift to just about anyone, especially to oneself--this purchase and gift to me coming soon.  I remember being enthusiastic about this series, but I had to check it out from a library loan first because I didn't remember all the episodes.  I am thrilled with this series all over again.",5,GREAT SERIES,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1566,"['series', 'crime', 'fighting', 'organization', 'called', 'COBRA', 'founded', 'father', 'Danielle', 'LaPoint', 'lady', 'portrayed', 'Allison', 'Hossack', 'Michael', 'Dudikoff', 'Scandal', 'Jackson', 'ex-navy', 'SEAL', 'James', 'Tolkan', 'Dallas', 'Cassel', 'Head', 'Cobra', 'ex-FBI', 'agent', 'got', 'hooked', 'series', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Casting', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'especially', 'James', 'Tolkan', 'head', 'Cobra', 'Michael', 'Dudikoff', 'writing', 'was', 'absolutely', 'super', 'was', 'absolutely', 'great', 'fabulous', 'mesmerising', 'episodes', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'was', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'series.There', 'was', 'humor', 'was', 'wisdom', 'was', 'intensity', 'mystery', 'action', 'suspense', 'everything', 'AWESOME', 'car', 'cute', 'guy', 'pretty', 'girl', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'dialogue', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'series', 'great', 'humor', 'wisdom', 'everything', 'else', 'great', 'series', 'crudity', 'nothing', 'teenager', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'television', 'said', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'audience', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'work', 'television', 'art.This', 'series', 'intense', 'mysterious', 'crudity', 'many', 'popular', 'shows', 'today', 'decent', 'perfect', 'anyone.Perfect', 'gift', 'just', 'anyone', 'especially', 'oneself', 'purchase', 'gift', 'coming', 'soon', 'remember', 'being', 'enthusiastic', 'series', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'library', 'loan', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'episodes', 'am', 'thrilled', 'series', 'again']",Cobra - The Complete Series
