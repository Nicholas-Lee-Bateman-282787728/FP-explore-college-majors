If any of that is true, one would not be convinced of this based on this portrayal of Christian Dior.  Aside from a short period of illness, it would appear that he faced no obstacles.  Not sure he came from money, but it does sound like he had considerable privilege and got pretty much whatever he wanted.  There is also little discussion of his personal life.  On weekends, he retreated to his vacation home and drew there.  He then headed back into the city weekdays to work.  Exciting, right?  (I kind of wish I had never watched it -- because I was better off thinking of him as the struggling and angst-ridden artist.  That, . . . he was not.)",2,I really hope Dior wasn't this boring,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,740,"['like', 'think', 'life', 'fashion', 'designer', 'sexy', 'full', 'excitement', 'true', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'convinced', 'based', 'portrayal', 'Christian', 'Dior', 'Aside', 'short', 'period', 'illness', 'would', 'appear', 'faced', 'obstacles', 'Not', 'sure', 'came', 'money', 'sound', 'had', 'considerable', 'privilege', 'got', 'pretty', 'much', 'wanted', 'also', 'little', 'discussion', 'personal', 'life', 'weekends', 'retreated', 'vacation', 'home', 'drew', 'there', 'then', 'headed', 'back', 'city', 'work', 'Exciting', 'right', 'kind', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'was', 'better', 'off', 'thinking', 'struggling', 'angst-ridden', 'artist', 'was', 'not']","Christian Dior, the Man behind the Myth"
