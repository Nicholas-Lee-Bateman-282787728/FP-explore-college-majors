Alan Batesportrays a shell shocked soldier during World War I.  His familyfears that if he gets his memory back his life will never be thesame.  Glenda Jackson portrays Margaret, his first love, and theonly person Bates remembers.  She gives one of her finestperformances.  In an ugly raincoat and an even uglier hat she stillmanages to be more attractive than the beautifully coifed anddressed Julie Christie who stars as Bates wife who wants him toget his memory back.. Ann-Margret also turns in another fineperformance.  Many thanks to Trinity for putting this out onDVD.",5,Glenda Jackson at her finest,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,687,"['film', 'had', 'limited', 'distribution', 'when', 'released', 'HBOvideo', 'was', 'not', 'around', 'long', 'dvd', 'most', 'welcome', 'Alan', 'shell', 'shocked', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'familyfears', 'memory', 'back', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'thesame', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Margaret', 'first', 'love', 'theonly', 'person', 'Bates', 'remembers', 'one', 'finestperformances', 'ugly', 'raincoat', 'even', 'uglier', 'hat', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'beautifully', 'coifed', 'anddressed', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'who', 'Bates', 'wife', 'who', 'toget', 'memory', 'back..', 'Ann-Margret', 'also', 'fineperformance', 'Many', 'thanks', 'Trinity', 'putting', 'out', 'onDVD']",The Return of the Soldier

Julie Christie's character is too haughty and conceited (snarl, snarl, snarl, who would want to be around her for a minute, let alone be married to her?), and Glenda Jackson is quaintly dowdy but amazingly we are told this ordinary lower middle-class woman has a romantic history with our rich, shell-shocked hero.  In a nutshell, the story wasn't believable, and the script seemed to lack subtlety.  The sets, costumes, filming, and cast should have resulted in something fantastic, like a Merchant/Ivory film, but it didn't come off well, and the stilted dialog and uncomfortable acting were the kiss-off.  It's strange how so many terrific components would not add up.",2,"Excellent cast, what happened?",1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,804,"['several', 'first', 'rate', 'actors', 'excellent', 'filming', 'was', 'dismayed', 'weak', 'story', 'dialog', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'character', 'too', 'haughty', 'conceited', 'snarl', 'snarl', 'snarl', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'minute', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'married', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'quaintly', 'dowdy', 'amazingly', 'are', 'told', 'ordinary', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'woman', 'romantic', 'history', 'rich', 'shell-shocked', 'hero', 'nutshell', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'script', 'seemed', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'sets', 'costumes', 'filming', 'cast', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'something', 'fantastic', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'well', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'uncomfortable', 'acting', 'were', 'kiss-off', 'strange', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'terrific', 'components', 'would', 'not', 'add', 'up']",The Return of the Soldier
