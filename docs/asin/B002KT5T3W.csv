1275485,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002KT5T3W,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Hurt is one of those horror films that takes a while to get going but once it does, it's worth your time.  It's worth sitting through the generic character interactions that take place in the beginning.  Though truth be told, it's not as generic as other films.This is because the storyline is about a demented foster girl that this family adopted, and they live in the middle of the desert with nobody else around.  When the storyline finally gets going, the movie leaves viewers guessing whether the girl is causing the assortment of problems or maybe there's a lunatic out there on the loose.  It's actually fairly well-written in the ""Who's causing the problems?"" department.  My only grip is that there was one line where the demented girl was sitting in her bedroom and gave it ALL away.  That line should have been removed.At first the problems are minor and insignificant- a bird is lying dead on the kitchen table and the family points the blame at each other.  Then eventually, people begin to die.Because so much storyline is devoted to the build-up between the family and the foster girl, you will definitely learn more about the story as it unfolds.  Actually a key piece to the storyline is executed brilliantly by the movies conclusion involving how the foster girls parents were killed, and it's surprising how well-written and compelling it is.What I find totally makes this movie a winner is the final 30 minutes.  Not only are the deaths interesting and creative, but the foster girl totally nails her role and actually improves her acting skills by quite a bit once we get closer to the end.Overall, worth watching.",4,quality horror,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,1635,"['Hurt', 'one', 'horror', 'films', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'once', 'time', 'worth', 'sitting', 'generic', 'character', 'interactions', 'take', 'place', 'beginning', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'as', 'generic', 'other', 'films.This', 'storyline', 'demented', 'foster', 'girl', 'family', 'adopted', 'live', 'middle', 'desert', 'nobody', 'else', 'around', 'When', 'storyline', 'finally', 'going', 'movie', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'girl', 'causing', 'assortment', 'problems', 'maybe', 'lunatic', 'out', 'there', 'loose', 'actually', 'fairly', 'well-written', 'Who', 'causing', 'problems', 'department', 'My', 'only', 'grip', 'was', 'one', 'line', 'where', 'demented', 'girl', 'was', 'sitting', 'bedroom', 'gave', 'ALL', 'away', 'line', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'removed.At', 'first', 'problems', 'are', 'minor', 'insignificant-', 'bird', 'lying', 'dead', 'kitchen', 'table', 'family', 'blame', 'other', 'Then', 'eventually', 'people', 'begin', 'die.Because', 'so', 'much', 'storyline', 'devoted', 'build-up', 'family', 'foster', 'girl', 'will', 'definitely', 'learn', 'more', 'story', 'Actually', 'key', 'piece', 'storyline', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'movies', 'conclusion', 'involving', 'how', 'foster', 'girls', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'surprising', 'how', 'well-written', 'compelling', 'find', 'totally', 'movie', 'winner', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'deaths', 'interesting', 'creative', 'foster', 'girl', 'totally', 'role', 'actually', 'acting', 'skills', 'quite', 'bit', 'once', 'get', 'closer', 'end.Overall', 'worth', 'watching']",Hurt

So the family tries to pull itself together without the father who had died earlier they also bring in an adoptee who acts as a provocateur in exposing each individual's issues.

Well...It certainly wasn't the worst movie ever, but I'd definitely say it isn't worth purchasing.  The acting was superb, however, save one...the little girl ended up getting a bit hammy toward the end.The film wasn't very original and had little to no plot-twists, or at least none that I didn't see coming about 3 scenes ahead of their actual revelation.  The scene that disturbed me the most was when the brother (played by Jackson Rathbone) gets smashed by a large metal sculpture thingie...his sister comes to discover him still alive underneath the hulking thing and doesn't even make one attempt to free him but instead runs off to find her mom and battle it out with the weird little girl first, leaving poor Conrad to suffer with his crushed pelvis or whatever injury he might've had...that definitely disturbed me more than anything else in the movie.  I would've at least TRIED to free my brother, whether it be in vain or not.

1275496,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002KT5T3W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Hurt (Barbara Stepansky, 2009)I will start this review off on a positive note, since it is likely the only positive thing I will say until I have finished this review: I liked William Mapother (The Bedroom) better here than I ever have. Mapother, a cousin of Tom Cruise, is one of the reheaded-stepchild brigade of famous-guy relatives (think Clint Howard and Joe Estevez here, among others) who often get roped into crappy movies as name stars. Mapother has always struck me as the most talented of the bunch, though he rarely has both a role with enough meat on it and a script with enough bones to allow that talent to come out. He gets the former here, and enough of the latter&#8212;Mapother's role, as socially-challenged Darryl Coltrane, the reclusive king of an auto graveyard who offers to take in his recently-deceased brother's family while they get his estate in order&#8212;is the male lead here, and he gives it far more TLC, and gravity, than it deserves, having ended up in this ridiculous mess of a movie that may even be too predictable for a Lifetime Movie Channel thriller. (Actually, for all I know, it is and I missed that bit.)Here's the bits that matter: Coltrane's sister-in-law Helen (Magnolia's Melora Walters), her son Conrad (Jackson Rathbone from the Twilight franchise), and her daughter Lenore (Easy A's Johanna E. Braddy) find themselves at a loss when Helen's husband is killed in a car accident. Darryl offers them a place to stay, but then a lawyer pops up with a curveball: said dead husband was in the process of getting the paperwork through to foster a youngster by the name of Sarah Parsons (My Sister's Keeper's Sofia Vassilieva). News to the entire family, and Helen is about to tell the lawyer to go soak his head, but she meets Sarah and takes a shine to the girl, so despite her better judgment&#8212;she's barely able to provide for her own family until the estate is settled&#8212;she takes Sarah in. Cue the usual lots-of-teens-in-one-house tension, but there's something else going on here. Creepy stuff starts happening, but is it Darryl&#8212;who is not all that great at masking the fact that he's been carrying a torch for Helen for a lot of years&#8212;or Sarah, who may be even more of a social misfit than Darryl?The movie's ugly, glaring, eight-hundred-pound elephant of a weakness is all too obvious within the first five minutes of the movie: by that time, you will have probably figured out every twist in the tale, assuming you've seen any half-dozen random thrillers of this stripe. It doesn't help that the much-superior Orphan was released the same year, and the two share more than a possibly-malevolent foster child. But one of the reasons Mapother stands out in this movie is that its cast, none of whom are normally slouches, all seem to be phoning it in. Much of this can probably be put down to the woeful script turned in by Alison Lea Bingeman, a longtime TV screenwriter turning in her first feature. It shows; this is far more an episode of a bad Lifetime TV series than it is a serviceable thriller. Skip it; you're not missing anything save a good William Mapother performance, one I hope he duplicates in the future in a much more deserving film. *",1,Crown of dirt.,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,3226,"['Hurt', 'Barbara', 'Stepansky', '2009', 'will', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'positive', 'note', 'likely', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'finished', 'review', 'liked', 'William', 'Mapother', 'Bedroom', 'better', 'here', 'ever', 'have', 'Mapother', 'cousin', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'one', 'reheaded-stepchild', 'brigade', 'famous-guy', 'relatives', 'think', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'Joe', 'Estevez', 'here', 'others', 'who', 'often', 'get', 'roped', 'crappy', 'movies', 'name', 'stars', 'Mapother', 'always', 'struck', 'most', 'talented', 'bunch', 'rarely', 'role', 'enough', 'meat', 'script', 'enough', 'bones', 'allow', 'talent', 'come', 'out', 'former', 'here', 'enough', 'latter', '8212', 'Mapother', 'role', 'socially-challenged', 'Darryl', 'Coltrane', 'reclusive', 'king', 'auto', 'graveyard', 'who', 'take', 'recently-deceased', 'brother', 'family', 'get', 'estate', 'order', '8212', 'male', 'lead', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'TLC', 'gravity', 'having', 'ended', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'mess', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'too', 'predictable', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'thriller', 'Actually', 'know', 'missed', 'bit', 'Here', 'bits', 'matter', 'Coltrane', 'sister-in-law', 'Helen', 'Magnolia', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'son', 'Conrad', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'Twilight', 'franchise', 'daughter', 'Lenore', 'Easy', 'A', 'Johanna', 'E.', 'Braddy', 'find', 'loss', 'when', 'Helen', 'husband', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Darryl', 'place', 'stay', 'then', 'lawyer', 'up', 'curveball', 'said', 'dead', 'husband', 'was', 'process', 'getting', 'paperwork', 'foster', 'youngster', 'name', 'Sarah', 'Parsons', 'My', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'News', 'entire', 'family', 'Helen', 'tell', 'lawyer', 'go', 'soak', 'head', 'Sarah', 'shine', 'girl', 'better', 'judgment', '8212', 'barely', 'able', 'provide', 'own', 'family', 'estate', 'settled', '8212', 'Sarah', 'Cue', 'usual', 'lots-of-teens-in-one-house', 'tension', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'Creepy', 'stuff', 'happening', 'Darryl', '8212', 'who', 'not', 'great', 'masking', 'fact', 'been', 'carrying', 'torch', 'Helen', 'lot', 'years', '8212', 'Sarah', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'social', 'misfit', 'Darryl', 'movie', 'ugly', 'glaring', 'eight-hundred-pound', 'elephant', 'weakness', 'too', 'obvious', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'twist', 'tale', 'assuming', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'half-dozen', 'random', 'thrillers', 'stripe', ""n't"", 'help', 'much-superior', 'Orphan', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'two', 'share', 'more', 'possibly-malevolent', 'foster', 'child', 'one', 'reasons', 'Mapother', 'out', 'movie', 'cast', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'normally', 'slouches', 'seem', 'be', 'phoning', 'Much', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'woeful', 'script', 'turned', 'Alison', 'Lea', 'Bingeman', 'longtime', 'TV', 'screenwriter', 'turning', 'first', 'feature', 'far', 'more', 'episode', 'bad', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'series', 'serviceable', 'thriller', 'Skip', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'anything', 'save', 'good', 'William', 'Mapother', 'performance', 'one', 'hope', 'future', 'much', 'more', 'deserving', 'film', '*']",Hurt

While most psychological thrillers set their struggling young families either in impossibly luxurious, spacious homes - or else in old isolated farmhouses that the family moves to in order to ""get a new start"" - ""Hurt"" takes a different tack. Here a newly widowed mother and her children go back and join her brother-in-law in his ramshackle auto salvage business out on the desert.This makes for a complex, realistic setting with lots of sharp edges and shadows. There is also a pack of wolves prowling the property, adding an extra fillip of menace.It becomes clear that not all the gears in this reconstructed family are meshing quite right.  The brother-in-law broodingly takes refuge in restoring a Ford Fairlane in one of the sheds on the property. The young son takes refuge in welding old car parts together into works of modern art. The mother adds to this already unwieldy assemblage when she abides by her dead husband's wishes and brings home a young foster child, well-played by Sofia Vassilieva (who is known for her role as a daughter in the TV series ""Medium""). While an undertow of tension swells in the family at large, Vassilieva blithely jumps rope across the dusty yard, a picture of eerie innocence.Anyone who likes searching through junkyards for parts - anyone who's into old car restoration - anyone who likes family dramas set in atmospheres of moodiness that devolve into murder - will probably find this movie worthwhile.",4,Above Average Psychological Thriller,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1551,"['suspense', 'drama', 'immediately', 'cut', 'average', 'being', 'set', 'auto', 'junkyard', 'most', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'set', 'struggling', 'young', 'families', 'impossibly', 'luxurious', 'spacious', 'homes', 'else', 'old', 'isolated', 'farmhouses', 'family', 'order', 'get', 'new', 'start', 'Hurt', 'different', 'tack', 'Here', 'newly', 'widowed', 'mother', 'children', 'go', 'back', 'join', 'brother-in-law', 'ramshackle', 'auto', 'salvage', 'business', 'desert.This', 'complex', 'realistic', 'setting', 'lots', 'sharp', 'edges', 'shadows', 'also', 'pack', 'wolves', 'prowling', 'property', 'adding', 'extra', 'fillip', 'menace.It', 'becomes', 'clear', 'not', 'gears', 'reconstructed', 'family', 'are', 'meshing', 'quite', 'right', 'brother-in-law', 'broodingly', 'refuge', 'restoring', 'Ford', 'Fairlane', 'one', 'sheds', 'property', 'young', 'son', 'refuge', 'welding', 'old', 'car', 'parts', 'together', 'works', 'modern', 'art', 'mother', 'already', 'unwieldy', 'assemblage', 'when', 'dead', 'husband', 'wishes', 'home', 'young', 'foster', 'child', 'well-played', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'who', 'known', 'role', 'daughter', 'TV', 'series', 'Medium', 'undertow', 'tension', 'swells', 'family', 'large', 'Vassilieva', 'blithely', 'rope', 'dusty', 'yard', 'picture', 'eerie', 'innocence.Anyone', 'who', 'searching', 'junkyards', 'parts', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'car', 'restoration', 'anyone', 'who', 'family', 'dramas', 'set', 'atmospheres', 'moodiness', 'murder', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'worthwhile']",Hurt

It is not as good as ""Shutter Island"" or even ""The Uninvited"", but is still worth a look if you are into thrillers. A man dies in an automobile accident. His wife, son and daughter go and live with dad's brother, in a desert ""auto recycling facility"" known as a junk yard. This is just temporary until the settlement check comes through... Mom is diabetic and has issues with her husband's death. The brother-in-law is a bit creepy and is in love with his dead brother's wife. The kids are somewhat normal, whatever that is for teenagers. Before he died, dad made arrangements to take in a child from an abused home. Mom, after meeting the child, agrees to continue with the foster care. The teenage girl has an instant dislike for the new girl, Sara, and Sara has an instant liking for the brother. There is the expected twist to the story, in fact it is hard to call it a twist, and there is also an unexpected twist, for which there were clues laid out.The acting was good, plot and dialogue were also sound.

1275500,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002KT5T3W,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","""Hurt"" reminds me of the Lifetime Movie Network's movies with its predictable plot twists, less than credible acting, and melodramatic scenes. It stars Melora Walters (Wanda in Big Love) as a widow who finds herself facing financial difficulties after the untimely death of her husband. With two teenagers to support, she is forced to rely on the charity of her brother-in-law, a reclusive character who reluctantly takes the family in. Despite living on someone else's charity, the widow decides to abide by her dead husband's wishes to take in a foster child, an orphan (Sofia Vassilieva of Medium)who seems harmless enough, yet also harbors a dark secret. The widow's teenage daughter who is finding it hard to deal with their diminished circumstances, takes an instant dislike to the young orphan, and when things start to rapidly deteriorate, she begins to suspect all is not well with the youngster.There are some aspects in this movie that don't make much sense - the widow is annoying in her helplessness. Yes, she has type 1 diabetes, but that doesn't mean she can't be productive - there appears to be no real sense of purpose in her life, wallowing in self-pity, and her efforts to find a job appear half-hearted at most. The same goes for the two teenage kids - they keep whining about not having money and having to put up with their creepy uncle, but neither of them (it being summer) attempt to find a job. The only creepy factor in this movie is the character of the orphan who after a while, appears to harbor a dark agenda of her own (in a twist which I actually figured out quite early on). ""Hurt"" is a been-there done that sort of psychological thriller (not horror) and worth a rental at best.",2,"Has its moments, but uninspired in general",1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1714,"['Hurt', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'movies', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twists', 'less', 'credible', 'acting', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'Wanda', 'Big', 'Love', 'widow', 'who', 'facing', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'untimely', 'death', 'husband', 'two', 'teenagers', 'support', 'forced', 'rely', 'charity', 'brother-in-law', 'reclusive', 'character', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'family', 'living', 'someone', 'else', 'charity', 'widow', 'abide', 'dead', 'husband', 'wishes', 'take', 'foster', 'child', 'orphan', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'Medium', 'who', 'harmless', 'enough', 'yet', 'also', 'dark', 'secret', 'widow', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'finding', 'hard', 'deal', 'diminished', 'circumstances', 'instant', 'dislike', 'young', 'orphan', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'rapidly', 'deteriorate', 'suspect', 'not', 'well', 'are', 'aspects', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'widow', 'annoying', 'helplessness', 'Yes', 'type', '1', 'diabetes', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'productive', 'be', 'real', 'sense', 'purpose', 'life', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'efforts', 'find', 'job', 'appear', 'half-hearted', 'most', 'same', 'two', 'teenage', 'kids', 'keep', 'whining', 'not', 'having', 'money', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'creepy', 'uncle', 'being', 'summer', 'attempt', 'find', 'job', 'only', 'creepy', 'factor', 'movie', 'character', 'orphan', 'who', 'while', 'harbor', 'dark', 'agenda', 'own', 'twist', 'actually', 'figured', 'out', 'quite', 'early', 'Hurt', 'been-there', 'done', 'sort', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'not', 'horror', 'rental', 'best']",Hurt
