1366769,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003V8BE12,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 12]","DAD'S IN HEAVEN WITH NIXON (2010) is a film by Tom Murray, great-grandson of inventor, Edison-collaborator and record patent-holder Thomas E. Murray. (You may read about this great worthy by doing a simple internet search.)Tom Murray, whose entire family seems to have been raised in front of a camera of some kind or other, lays out the story of his family with (I would call it) lethal precision. He speaks of his great-grandfather the famous inventor Thomas Murray; speaks of his grandfather, a failed politician who severely berated one of his children; and guess who that one child was? Tom Murray's father, that's who.While fascinating and almost somewhat nostalgic for me, I found Tom's struggle to fit his autistic brother Chris into the film a bit sad. We watched this because it was supposedly about Chris Murray and Tom's efforts to make Chris accessible through the film. Instead, it is almost 100% Murray Family History Class. As I say, it was great, skillfully shot and directed--but it wasn't really about Chris or his autism.Yes, there was at the very end a section about Chris, his autism, his family's dealing with it, and Chris' success (especially as an artist). It is very good and reminded me of Dr. Oliver Sacks' autistic artist friend Jesse. However, it was pretty scarce and then the film was over, leaving us wanting more information. It almost feels as if the advertizing used Chris' autism to get the film out, but was never really going to be about Chris or his autism.Lots of attention was focused on Tom's father, his horrid temper, a tentative decades-late diagnosis of manic depression, and the sad drowning accident that many claimed was suicide (not Chris--he says ""Dad swam out too far."").At the end of the day, I'd say the film does contribute to our understanding of autism a little. It treats Chris beautifully, as I see his family loved him so much they helped him become more normalized. This is what happened to me, also. It was nice seeing another family that went through the same mill. But do not expect a load of autism information, as there really is none, and don't expect any preaching about autism here either (a welcome relief--Murray could give lessons about this).By the way, the title is Chris' assessment of his father's present situation, and a reference to his father's hatred of President Nixon. That is actually very funny. Chris sees his father in heaven, ""hanging out"" with Nixon and playing poker. They are friends there, as all heaven's inhabitants are--a great vision.Sit back and marvel at the downward spiral of a once-great New York family, one that might have been...ah, it makes no matter because look at the great people they are now.",4,Thomas E.

The scenes of the family over the decades will draw you in, and the story of how Chris overcame his overwhelming difficulties to speak, live independently, and create really important art is nothing short of miraculous.At times, I felt that Chris was not so much limited as severely misunderstood.  At the end, when he is asked what artist in the world he would most like to see in a museum, he's slow to answer, and reflective.  After all, he has worked hard on his own pieces and knows how they look already, but this is a concept that may be difficult and time-consuming to convey, so he finally relents and gives the expected answer:  himself.  There are several little vignettes like this throughout the film where it seems as if people are being patient with his limitations when, actually, it may be Chris who has resigned himself to be agreeable (downright saintly, in fact) and just go with the flow.  The understated but dead-on impression of Nixon saying, ""Good, Chris!"" betrays extreme wit, and some of his meanderings during conversation are not really so far off the mark as they are relevant when you take the time to think about it.

1366778,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B003V8BE12,Sheryl Fechter,"[0, 0]","Truly, this documentary is a labor of love from one brother, filmmaker Tom Murray, to another, Chris.  Tom collected old film footage, newspaper clippings, but mainly explanations of his grandfather where this family discord begins in the documentary.  He was a famous inventor, but with a mean streak towards their own father, by not giving love and concern for his son.  We then observe plenty of family footage of their once successful father who turned around and singled out one of his own children and began treating him poorly by not accepting that Chris was ""different"".Tom, (endeared ""Tommy"" by Chris), is gentle while talking about the history of their family with his autistic brother Chris Murray, the famous New York City artist.  He was cast aside by his own father and things get a bit complicated in Chris' emotional mindset as his own father did this to him although his recollections are those of love.  According to his mother, Janice, Tom was the apple of his father's eye, even through the unprovoked rages that came along with presumed undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder. Losing jobs, making terrible decisions with money, refusing any psychiatric help, the family believes he finally took his own life, but Chris does not.  He will still say that he simply swam out too far into the water; hence the title, as his father despised President Nixon with a passion and has now joined him to play poker in Heaven.The film begins with a lengthy portion of how far back Tom would go to help tell a family story that does not start out flourishing; instead it is full of despair.  I can say the end result of this docudrama ends with tears and smiles.  Chris went his own way about 30 years ago with his life but went through several emotions while respectfully and lovingly being filmed by Tommy.  He is interviewed about his happy life living in New Haven while working two jobs.  His main job with recognition is his unbelievable artistry.  Chris designs highly precise artwork that is in demand, although Chris would rather keep his two jobs, a janitor and a dairy stocking person for a grocery store.  When you are able to see his art, it will take your breath away, huge architectural landscapes with the buildings of New York City including each and every intricate window.  His art is highly prized.  When he does do one, it is mostly more of a hobby; they are on a waiting list and already sold.Chris is phenomenal from the newborn that was advised for his mother to put into a ""home"" for the permanently disabled.  He has lived perfectly well for about thirty years in his own apartment and is a busy and functioning person in society.  Chris inspired me to greater heights, to be happy with what I am able to do myself and to recognize that people are not pressed from cookie cutters.
