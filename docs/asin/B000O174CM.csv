1061721,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000O174CM,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 3]","Truth is stranger than fiction.  Or at least it's very familiar in 'Dream Girls, a triumphant survey of modern black music interspersed with behind the scenes drama of backbiting, drugs, egos, and deception.  The thinly veiled look at Motown (Rainbow Records) and the debacle between key members of Diana Ross and The Supremes almost makes this whole musical historical fiction--or, I should say, non-fiction.It all starts, of course, with earnest talent like a James Brown-like performer (Eddie Murphy) who wows audiences and a girl group who tries to break through the fixed Detroit talent contest.  (They groom a B.B. King-like performer to win.)  Once they lose, they must depend on managers to see them through (Curtis, a very Berry Gordy-like figure played by Jamie Foxx, and an older entreprenuer (Danny Glover) who depends on his old-hand skills for catapulting stars.)  They all seek the top, but only Curtis sees what's necessary to get a black act there.  For all their talent, their records are stolen and sanitized by white singers (more than a little reminiscent of Pat Boone) and brought to the top of the charts.  Using gambling and mob money, Curtis bribes the D.J.'s to play his own music.  More galling is his maneuvering to unseat Effie White (played with spunk by Jennifer Hudson), the talented but overweight lead singer, to the backdrop and put Deana Jones (Beyonce') to the head of the group.  Even though her own mother is even perplexed by the venue change, Curtis, to his conniving credit has, cynically, the winning formula.  Everyone is at his mercy until they all either become washed up or leave his productive but overly possessive nest.  (And how many parallels can be made when Deanna and Effie  are nearly dead ringers for Diana Ross and Mary Wells?)  If that doesn't convince you that this musical movie is hardly fiction, then the near replicas for The Jackson Five surely will.'Dream Girls' is a glorious display of modern black music since the advent of the girl group in the early sixties.  It also intersperses well events like the riots and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's presence.  But one objection remains:  The backstage bickering is necessary, but also burdening.  When they expose the politics of alliances and talented people burned, they do it well.  That is until they sing about it; then it becomes awkward and maudlin.  Numbers like ""When I Saw You"" and ""We Are the Family"" seem sappy next to the splendor of the numbers they perform on stage.  See 'Dream Girls' by all means, but realize that it has limitations.  It is sometimes overly sentimental and embarrassing when they sing about their troubles--not as well integrated as, say, 'Chicago' in this regard.  Despite its flaws, 'Dream Girls' has a likable ensemble, a good story, and, most of all, glorious music.",4,Truth Is Stranger Than 'Dream Girls',1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2819,"['Truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'least', 'very', 'familiar', ""'Dream"", 'Girls', 'triumphant', 'survey', 'modern', 'black', 'music', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'drama', 'backbiting', 'drugs', 'egos', 'deception', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'look', 'Motown', 'Rainbow', 'Records', 'debacle', 'key', 'members', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Supremes', 'almost', 'whole', 'musical', 'historical', 'fiction', 'should', 'say', 'non-fiction.It', 'starts', 'course', 'earnest', 'talent', 'James', 'Brown-like', 'performer', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'audiences', 'girl', 'group', 'who', 'break', 'fixed', 'Detroit', 'talent', 'contest', 'groom', 'B.B', 'King-like', 'performer', 'win', 'lose', 'must', 'depend', 'managers', 'see', 'Curtis', 'very', 'Berry', 'Gordy-like', 'figure', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'older', 'entreprenuer', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'old-hand', 'skills', 'catapulting', 'stars', 'seek', 'top', 'only', 'Curtis', 'what', 'necessary', 'get', 'black', 'act', 'there', 'talent', 'records', 'are', 'stolen', 'sanitized', 'white', 'singers', 'more', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'brought', 'top', 'charts', 'Using', 'gambling', 'mob', 'money', 'Curtis', 'D.J', 'play', 'own', 'music', 'More', 'galling', 'maneuvering', 'unseat', 'Effie', 'White', 'played', 'spunk', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'talented', 'overweight', 'lead', 'singer', 'backdrop', 'put', 'Deana', 'Jones', 'Beyonce', 'head', 'group', 'Even', 'own', 'mother', 'even', 'perplexed', 'venue', 'change', 'Curtis', 'conniving', 'credit', 'cynically', 'winning', 'formula', 'Everyone', 'mercy', 'become', 'washed', 'up', 'leave', 'productive', 'overly', 'possessive', 'nest', 'how', 'many', 'parallels', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'when', 'Deanna', 'Effie', 'are', 'nearly', 'dead', 'ringers', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Mary', 'Wells', ""n't"", 'convince', 'musical', 'movie', 'hardly', 'fiction', 'then', 'near', 'replicas', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'surely', 'will', ""'Dream"", 'Girls', 'glorious', 'display', 'modern', 'black', 'music', 'advent', 'girl', 'group', 'early', 'sixties', 'also', 'well', 'events', 'riots', 'Rev', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'presence', 'one', 'objection', 'backstage', 'bickering', 'necessary', 'also', 'burdening', 'When', 'expose', 'politics', 'alliances', 'talented', 'people', 'burned', 'do', 'well', 'sing', 'then', 'awkward', 'maudlin', 'Numbers', 'When', 'Saw', 'Are', 'Family', 'seem', 'sappy', 'next', 'splendor', 'numbers', 'perform', 'stage', 'See', ""'Dream"", 'Girls', 'means', 'realize', 'limitations', 'sometimes', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'embarrassing', 'when', 'sing', 'troubles', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'integrated', 'say', 'regard', 'flaws', 'Girls', 'likable', 'ensemble', 'good', 'story', 'most', 'glorious', 'music']",N/A

A film-e-clef, the movie captured, in essence, the blueprint on how most of the musical acts we know got famous and the aftermath of that fame. I've read that certain people loosely or vaguely portrayed in the film may have not been pleased, but this wasn't a biography, it was a film (and based on a play at that). Murphy rightly won high acclaim for his role; when his conscious single isn't picked up, his non-verbal disdain cut me pretty deep. Beyonce was perfect for the role, and it was because of what her character was told by Foxx's toward the end of the film about why she was chosen to be the lead. If we don't watch out, Beyonce' will be the next Cher (is it already happening?). Foxx's character was somewhat disappointing. I really could've used more depth. He was just vicious just because according to the script, so they should have should've taken greater risks with him. Although Murphy was my favorite thing about this movie, Hudson stole the show. She had no weak points in the movie, and though she's...well, Effie....you end up rooting for her by the end. Glover played a very underappreciated role in the film, and reminded me of older gentlemen that I know in real life. Rose had a surprisingly enjoyable role that purposely stayed in the background, though she shot life into the limited screen time she had.

1061724,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000O174CM,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[7, 19]","If anything proves the old adage ""They don't make `em like they used to"" it's the recent (and I can't write this word without an industrial-scale vat of sarcasm) `musical' called `Dreamgirls'.Starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles and Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is adapted from the highly successful stage musical which is loosely based on the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes and the rise and fall of the Motown record label. The mettle of any musical is tested by the quality of its soundtrack so on that basis Dreamgirls is probably the worst musical I've seen since Moulin Rouge. It's only about half way though the film when, on the way to a fight in an alleyway that one of the characters suddenly burst into song and we realise that we're watching a musical at all. Up until then it's merely a bad film about the music industry with badder songs (badder in the `not good sense' as opposed to the James Brown sense) The `I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' sequence is more than aptly named - I thought I was going to die of old age before it ended. In fact it's probably still going on somewhere. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson, who apparently won herself in an American television contest, steals a show which really isn't worth having. Beyonc&eacute; does little more than give `gorgeous lessons' to all and sundry while Eddie Murphy's much lauded performance is merely adequate. The only oasis in this cinematic desert is the Op-art sets and Beyonc&eacute;'s 60's/70's Ross-esque costumes.Dreamgirls is further evidence that the idiom of the musical appears to be a creature of the past. Unlike the last great film musical Grease (1978), Dreamgirls' editing suggests that none of the dancers are capable of a complete uninterrupted routine and if the songs here were truly of the standard that Motown were putting out they would never have been heard beyond the confines of Berry Gordy's bedroom. Surely Motown, arguably the most important record label in the history of recorded sound, deserves a better tribute that this. No siree-bop, they don't make `em like they used to. Next time you're in the mood for a truly great musical, with great songs and brilliantly choreographed dance spectacle and you're all Gene Kelly'd out - see James Cagney's little known 1933 classic Footlight Parade' you'll be singing `Shanghai Lil' for days.",1,Stop!

And although it took almost 25 years to make, the movie version is spectacular.Following the meteoric rise of the fictitious ""Dreams,"" the story takes place in Detroit in 1962 and ends in Los Angeles in 1975. In between you witness the joy, sorrow and bitterness--as some dreams die, while others live. And being a period movie, DREAMGIRLS doesn't feel dated or unrealistic. It captures the excitement and turbulence of the 60s or at least the romanticized ideal of it...perfectly.Anyway enough about the movie and on to the DVD.This dvd set contains two dvds:***DVD #1 FEATURE FILM; 12 EXTENDED/ADDITIONAL MUSICAL NUMBERSI won't list the 12 songs but the title track ""Dreamgirls"" and the show stopper ""And I Am Telling You..."" are not part of this 12. With the exception of the song ""Effie, Sing My Song,"" at least from what I could tell, most of these musical numbers are just different edits/film cuts than those that made it into the film. For instance, you'll see more of the performance rather than the cutaways to other scenes, which you see in the movie...so they're not sung differently.What's good about this is that you get to see the entire performance of the opening acts(The Stepp Sisters, L'il Albert and The Tru-Tones, Tiny Joe Dixon) without the cutaway shots that show what's going on behind the stage. No additional lyrics: the songs are exactly as they are on the deluxe edition music cd ofDreamgirls: Music From The Motion Picture [2-CD Deluxe Edition].One alternative musical number that's very different is the song ""Effie, Sing My Song."" In the movie, the lines are spoken. However they did film the song version where C.C. and Effie share a duet. And that's included here.***DVD #2 DOCUMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF DREAMGIRLS; ORIGINAL AUDITION AND SCREEN TEST VIDEOS; FEATURETTES ABOUT THE FASHION, FILM EDITING, THEATRICAL LIGHTING; PRE-VISUALIZATION SEQUENCES; IMAGE GALLERYIn all fairness, I haven't seen the entire second dvd. The reason being is that the documentary on the making of DREAMGIRLS is nearly TWO-HOURS long! Running at one-hour and fifty-five minutes, the documentary called ""Building the Dream"" chronicles the journey that started as an idea from Broadway creators Tom Eyen, Henry Krieger, and Michael Bennett to finally becoming the most hyped and anticipated film of 2006. But don't worry, that's not the beef of the documentary. Most of it takes you behind the scenes of what it took to put this huge movie together from the set design to the casting; from the choreography to staying true to the original score.It's a fascinating look at the challenges director Bill Condon faced when deciding to take on this project. I always thought that ""Dreamgirls"" would've been easy to make into a film because you already started with everything in place. How wrong I was! Not only are you competing in a genre not too popular today, but you have to compete with the beloved original. Well, I must pay homage to Condon. He pulled it off.Anyway, the documentary is told through home video of the recording sessions, casting calls, set design, rehearsals etc., as well as  principal cast member interviews and of course the main people working behind the scenes like director Condon, executive producers, choreographers, music producers etc.If nothing else, this documentary alone is worth the extra price for the two-set dvd of DREAMGIRLS.And for those of you die hard fans of the original Broadway show or soundtrack, who liked this movie version, will be happy to know that the song ""A'int No Party"" is supposed to be included in the ""audition tapes"" section of the special features. There is a snippet of it in the documentary and Anika Noni Rose was working that song. So I'm sure it has to be included in the screen tests.

1061733,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000O174CM,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[3, 6]","I saw this with my sister in February her birthday. The two of us-and the audience as a whole-were simply moved and enthralled by this wonderful piece of cinematic magic.Simply put, even if you are not familiar with the backstory that this film was based on (the Motown records backstage drama between Berry Gordy and the Supremes), the greatness of this movie is that it speaks for anyone who has been rejected for unfair reasons and who wishes to triumph against a world that seems set against them. Even though its a story about black women in the 60s and 70s, most people regardless of race, class, gender, or era can identify with this film. Like al truly good art, its universal. The songs, story, and acting all speak to this human condition in a most powerful and beautiful fashion.Hardcore R&B; fans will get some extra joy in this film by picking out who the main characters are based on. The Supremes (the DGs) and Jamie Foxx (Berry Gordy) have been discussed, but Eddie Murphy is electrifying as the James Brown/Marvin Gaye prototype James Thunder Early (those familiar with his Saturday Night Live takeoffs of JB will find extra amusement in this) and the Jackson Five sendup is quite a hoot! There are some others but I'll leave that for the viewer to see.And of course this would not be complete without discussing Jennifer Hudson. Sistergirl had audiences giving standing-o's across the country in movie theaters. She is acclaimed (deservedly) for her perfomance of ""And I Am Telling You"" in this film, but the buildup that leads to this scene with the other Dreamgirls is also outstanding  and leaves you limp after Jennifer's tour de force. Beyonce is no Cicely Tyson or Diana Ross, but she makes the best of her talents in her performance of the song ""Listen."" (She does clearly channel Diana during the reprise of ""Family"").It is all so good and wonderful that after seeing this you'll run to church/mosque/synagogue and thank GOD for allowing Thomas Edison to invent motion pictures.OKAY-REVIEW REMIX NOW THAT DG IS ON DVD:All you hardcore DG junkies can THROW AWAY those bootlegs you bought from ""Sweet Lenny"" on the street corner with people getting up and clapping during Jenny Hudson's tour-de-force as the methodone for your DG addiction. The REAL, UNCUT STUFF is here to get your fix and here's some added comments about this product-The 12 deleted scenes are not that revealing. Mostly added angles to what's already here. The hilarious Jackson Five takeoff is shown in its entirety. There is an amusing segment where Eddie Murphy gets into a barroom brawl with a jealous boyfriend of a female admirer. Murphy fans will note the similarity to his ""street fight"" routine from RAW (1987). ""Effie Sing My Song"" with JH and Keith Robinson is quite touching, but one can see why the producers felt it was a bit much and dropped it from the theatrical release (glad it found a place here). But its good for DG fans to see what we were missing in the theaters.The documentary on disc II is strictly for the folks who would camp out at the store overnight to buy this on the first day. But there is some interesting stuff here. It is a bit jarring to see the DG's sans makeup au natural (and a bespectacled Anika Rose) going through rehearsals. Speaking of Anika, she appears far more mature than her screen character doing ""Ain't No Party"" (a song that was in the play, but not the final film).This is my new favorite film of all time and it is of many other people too.

1061735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000O174CM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","While the Oscar snub was certainly shocking I can't say that it wasn't justified (not that the lineup for 2006 impressed me in the least).  `Dreamgirls', while probably one of the most entertaining films of the year, was far from the best.It delivers in many ways.  It's visually stunning, from the set pieces to the beautiful cast.  It's very easy on the ears.  The musical numbers (for the most part) are all brilliantly structured and add layers to the film.  In fact, the films biggest and key emotional scenes are in fact musical numbers.  Both `And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' and `Listen' are the most emotionally connected scenes in the film for through music they convey the very feelings of the singer.  It also delivers, to an extent, in the acting department as well.  Eddie Murphy is fantastic as James ""Thunder"" Early and delivers a career best performance.  Beyonce Knowles shocked me with her delivery of Deena Jones and Anika Noni Rose beautifully captured the immaturity and naivety of Lorrel Robinson.  In fact everyone delivers decently here except for Jamie Foxx who was, without a doubt, miscast.Sadly, with all this delivery the film fails to deliver in the one area that matters the most; substance.  By the time the credits begin to roll `Dreamgirls' is nothing more than a fun time.  The characters, while superbly acted, lack any real depth and the film fails to evoke any real emotion in the audience.  With all the hype surrounding this film you'd expect to be really moved, really taken-a-back by it's magnitude but in the end it doesn't really do any of that.  One may be blinded by the glitz and glam upon a first viewing, as I was, but upon second and third viewings it becomes apparent that the film feels kind of empty, especially when the music has stopped.The film tells the story of aspiring musical act `The Dreamettes' who finally get their big break after aspiring music manager Curtis Taylor Jr. sees them perform in a talent show.  He persuades them to sing backup for R&B; sensation James ""Thunder"" Early and thus their showbiz life begins.  The group suffers from internal struggles when lead singer Effie is pushed aside so the slimmer, more socially termed `pretty girl' Deena can sing lead vocals.  This seemingly small gesture drives a wedge in friendships and relationships, working and social, and creates a whirlwind of tragedy and in the end justice.Now, I left off one key element to the film for a reason...and that is the fact that arguably there was no bigger star in 2006 than the beautiful and talented Jennifer Hudson.  I don't necessarily agree with her Oscar win, but I was so happy for her because she delivered on all fronts and was so gracious with all the accolades she was receiving.  She handled herself like a true star, and that is commendable.  As Effie White she truly breathed life into this film and serves as one of the only actors here to actually flesh out her character.  With all the `lack of depth' found in `Dreamgirls' it is refreshing to see Jennifer grab a hold of Effie and make her real and relatable to the audience.  So I am here to tell you that Jennifer ain't goin nowhere, and that is a fact!So, the film is, like I said, extremely entertaining and a truly fun filled time.  Parts are corny (that whole ""Steppin' to the Bad Side"" part was dreadfully painful to watch) but as a whole it is just good ol' fun.  But that is it.  It is a fun film, but not a deep one and not one that deserved to win Oscars (aside from some technical, musical and acting recognition).  So, do I feel that the Oscar snub was truly a `snub'?  No, but I don't feel that that really takes away from the appeal and the good time that a film like `Dreamgirls' brings to the table.",3,It's light on substance but heavy on entertainment...,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,3748,"['Oscar', 'snub', 'was', 'certainly', 'shocking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'justified', 'not', 'lineup', '2006', 'impressed', 'least', 'Dreamgirls', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'year', 'was', 'far', 'best.It', 'delivers', 'many', 'ways', 'visually', 'stunning', 'set', 'pieces', 'beautiful', 'cast', 'very', 'easy', 'ears', 'musical', 'numbers', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'structured', 'add', 'layers', 'film', 'fact', 'films', 'biggest', 'key', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'fact', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Am', 'Telling', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Going', 'Listen', 'are', 'most', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'scenes', 'film', 'music', 'convey', 'very', 'feelings', 'singer', 'also', 'extent', 'acting', 'department', 'as', 'well', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'fantastic', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'career', 'best', 'performance', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'shocked', 'delivery', 'Deena', 'Jones', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'immaturity', 'naivety', 'Lorrel', 'Robinson', 'fact', 'everyone', 'delivers', 'decently', 'here', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'was', 'doubt', 'miscast.Sadly', 'delivery', 'film', 'deliver', 'one', 'area', 'most', 'substance', 'time', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'Dreamgirls', 'nothing', 'more', 'fun', 'time', 'characters', 'superbly', 'acted', 'lack', 'real', 'depth', 'film', 'evoke', 'real', 'emotion', 'audience', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'really', 'moved', 'really', 'taken-a-back', 'magnitude', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'blinded', 'glitz', 'glam', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'second', 'third', 'viewings', 'apparent', 'film', 'feels', 'kind', 'empty', 'especially', 'when', 'music', 'stopped.The', 'film', 'story', 'aspiring', 'musical', 'act', 'Dreamettes', 'who', 'finally', 'get', 'big', 'break', 'aspiring', 'music', 'manager', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'Jr.', 'perform', 'talent', 'show', 'sing', 'backup', 'R', 'B', 'sensation', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'thus', 'showbiz', 'life', 'group', 'suffers', 'internal', 'struggles', 'when', 'lead', 'singer', 'Effie', 'pushed', 'aside', 'slimmer', 'more', 'socially', 'termed', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Deena', 'can', 'sing', 'lead', 'vocals', 'seemingly', 'small', 'gesture', 'wedge', 'friendships', 'relationships', 'working', 'social', 'whirlwind', 'tragedy', 'end', 'justice.Now', 'left', 'off', 'one', 'key', 'element', 'film', 'reason', 'fact', 'arguably', 'was', 'bigger', 'star', '2006', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'delivered', 'fronts', 'was', 'so', 'gracious', 'accolades', 'was', 'receiving', 'handled', 'true', 'star', 'commendable', 'Effie', 'White', 'truly', 'breathed', 'life', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'actors', 'here', 'actually', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'lack', 'depth', 'found', 'Dreamgirls', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'grab', 'hold', 'Effie', 'make', 'real', 'relatable', 'audience', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'Jennifer', 'ai', ""n't"", 'goin', 'nowhere', 'fact', 'So', 'film', 'said', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'truly', 'fun', 'filled', 'time', 'Parts', 'are', 'corny', 'Steppin', 'Bad', 'Side', 'part', 'was', 'dreadfully', 'painful', 'watch', 'whole', 'just', 'good', 'ol', 'fun', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'deep', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'deserved', 'win', 'Oscars', 'aside', 'technical', 'musical', 'acting', 'recognition', 'So', 'do', 'feel', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'was', 'truly', 'snub', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'away', 'appeal', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'Dreamgirls', 'table']",N/A

From the first second she opens her mouth, it's evident she's light-years beyond the other singing talents assembled here.  That includes Beyonc&eacute;.  Not Beyonc&eacute;'s character, Deena Jones, but Beyonc&eacute; herself.That said, the real story here is Eddie Murphy.  I thought he deserved an Oscar nomination for 'Bowfinger' (don't laugh - go back and watch).  And, here, you don't think ""that's Eddie Murphy.""  You see James 'Thunder' Early up there.  He brings such amazing energy to the movie.To the contrary, you have Jamie Foxx.  I realize he's supposed to be playing an ill-tempered, Machiavellian character, but he seems to be seriously teed-off that he's in this movie.  Maybe it's because he  worked for well under his post-'Ray' $20M asking price, but he just doesn't seem to be happy sharing screen time with Knowles, Murphy, et al.Director Bill Condon is 3 for 3 now - 'Gods and Monsters,' 'Kinsey: Let's Talk Abount Sex,' and now 'Dreamgirls.'  What a track record.For those interested in the movie's sinuous trail to the big screen and how Condon came to be tabbed as director, get a hold of Vanity Fair's recent outstanding piece on the making of the film.  It's tremendously enthralling reporting.  Of special note is rights holder David Geffen's efforts to protect creator Michael Bennett's legacy.  If you stay through the movie's credits, you'll see that the movie-makers dedicate the movie to the memory of Bennett.",5,"Hudson, Murphy and Condon shine; read the VF article for backstory",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,1543,"[""'ll"", 'read', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'jawdropping', 'performance', 'incredible', 'first', 'second', 'mouth', 'evident', 'light-years', 'other', 'singing', 'talents', 'assembled', 'here', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Not', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'character', 'Deena', 'Jones', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'said', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'thought', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'Bowfinger"", 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'see', 'James', ""'Thunder"", 'Early', 'there', 'such', 'amazing', 'energy', 'movie.To', 'contrary', 'have', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'realize', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'ill-tempered', 'Machiavellian', 'character', 'be', 'seriously', 'teed-off', 'movie', 'worked', 'well', ""post-'Ray"", '20M', 'asking', 'price', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'happy', 'sharing', 'screen', 'time', 'Knowles', 'Murphy', 'et', 'al.Director', 'Bill', 'Condon', '3', '3', 'now', ""'Gods"", 'Monsters', 'Let', 'Talk', 'Abount', 'Sex', 'now', ""'Dreamgirls"", 'What', 'track', 'record.For', 'interested', 'movie', 'sinuous', 'trail', 'big', 'screen', 'how', 'Condon', 'came', 'be', 'tabbed', 'director', 'get', 'hold', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'recent', 'outstanding', 'piece', 'making', 'film', 'tremendously', 'enthralling', 'reporting', 'special', 'note', 'rights', 'holder', 'David', 'Geffen', 'efforts', 'protect', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Bennett', 'legacy', 'stay', 'movie', 'credits', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie-makers', 'dedicate', 'movie', 'memory', 'Bennett']",N/A

Struggling musical group gets their big break and then money, egos, and relationships start to mess everything up. Life long friends become bitter enemies and all that fame and money starts to feel real hollow. What makes ""Dreamgirls"" more than just another typical musical drama is the amazing combination of a stellar cast, an outstanding score, and a genius of a director. The sets, the costumes, the choreography, the editing: this movie just reeks of high quality and the kind of dedication that breeds Oscar worthy movies. Of course, the greatest treat is seeing some knockout performances, most notably from newcomer Jennifer Hudson and veteran Eddie Murphy. This movie just moves my soul. I really felt for the characters and what they were going through. It seems like the movie musical is a thing of the past but Bill Condon and Company prove that it can still be done and done well.I bought the ""Showstopper Edition"" and it's definitely a must for the fans. The first disc has extended and deleted musical numbers. To see some of the numbers in their less edited form was exciting for me because I loved the music. Disc 2 has some featurettes and a more comprehensive look at the making of the film. Plus some screen tests for Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. The best part of the ""Building A Dream"" documentary is the section ""Gonna Take A Mean Ride Side A & B"" which shows you a day to day look at the production from rehearsals, to recording the songs, and to the actual filming of scenes. The special features were worth the extra change BUT I was very dissapointed that there was no commentary by the director or the stars. I feel like there are more stories to be told about this incredible production. I guess there's a ""Razzle Dazzle"" edition in the works.

There are some good performances, most notably Jennifer Hudson (omigod she's so cute!) and Eddie Murphy (wow, I'm impressed) but the script and the libretto are disjointed and artlessly blunt.  The earlier musical numbers suffer from the adaptation to screen, with too many montage sequences and not enough full performances.  The musical numbers in the second half of the film get better treatment, but by then it's hard to care.  Stylistically, the music is packed with anachronisms (particularly in the early, R&B years) and the plot just jumps around, counting on viewers to either play catch-up or ignore the fact that the entire film is dramatically flat and is a stitched-together patchwork of poorly scripted, poorly directed scenes... Indeed, the whole production seems to rely on the good will of the audience, but having given that good will for the full two hours, I feel entitled to point out that the emperor ain't got no clothes.

Well, it didn't deserve it.I saw the original Broadway cast and it was an amazing experience - so much more than had been managed on Broadway before.  It was excellent even without the showstopper song.  The music told the story more than the acting.In the movie, the music lost all the intensity it had on stage.  They wanted names - Beyonce, Jamie Foxx - fine, but their acting and vocals didn't bring the emotional impact of the originals.The only character that did was Effie.  Ms. Jennifer Hudson didn't try to copy Jennifer Holliday - who could.  She made it her own.  Her acting was the most believable in the film and when she sang - she SANG.  That girl spoke more emotion through the songs than all the other actors did throughout the entire film.  Her Oscar was mor than deserved and not only for AND I AM TELLING YOU.Otherwise, the adaption was a mess.  When thet sang the song FAMILY and then Jennifer and Jamie went outside arguing they were in the middle of the riots complete with gunshots.  How unrealistic.  if all this was happening outside would they have all just been sitting in the theatre.And on the stage, when the song DREAMGIRLS was performed, as the group transitioned, it was magical. You were lost in it.  It was such a let down in the film.  The vocals didn't make it soar and even the shooting, editing of it certainly lost an opportunity to shine.For me, this movie made me wish the stage magic could have been brought to film.  It was e reminder of a memory.  Beyonce was stiff and some of the worst acting by Jamie so far.I would give this film 3 stars as an ill fated attempt but Jennifer Hudson made the material shine and anyone who had a scene with her looked better.  When she sang you wanted to stand, clap and shout as if you were seeing it live.  Jennifer Hudson - for you - I AM TELLING YOU - I have to give the film 4 stars.

My hate for musicals is probably even greater than my love for Beyonce, but Dreamgirls isn't a typical musical and because of that it's become one of my favorite films.Since it's fiction loosely based on actual events, think of this film as sort of a Motown version of 8 Mile (Detroit plays a central role coincidentally, too). It was originally a 1980s Broadway musical which won six Tony Awards, as other reviewers have noted.Honestly, I was probably a half hour or more into the movie before I even realized it's a ""musical."" Because musical performances are a central part of this story about a pseudo-Supremes, you just enjoy the music rather than being subjected to somebody walking down the street dancing around light poles and such like you're apt to find in a typical musical.This is the last good dramatic role Eddie Murphy's done (he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar) and his performance is stellar. The film's awards speak for themselves: Golden Globe winner for best picture and Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Dreamgirls also won the Oscar for best sound mix and was the first live-action movie to receive THREE nominations for best song (eat it, Lion King).The film is also historically significant because at $80 million it's the most expensive movie ever produced with an all-black starring cast.Jamie Foxx is terrific as the fake Berry Gordy Jr. As good as or better than his performances in Ali and Ray.Beyonce Knowles was nominated for a Golden Globe as the fake Diana Ross. Since the fake Supremes in the movie are a trio, there are also some subtle parallels with the real-life Destiny's Child breakup which undoubtedly helped Knowles' performance.Danny Glover is outstanding as always. Even in minor roles he still has a major presence.The always delightful Loretta Devine (Dr. Webber's wife on Grey's Anatomy) does one number in a club and John Lithgow even has a minor role in one scene.Jaleel ""Urkel"" White also has a cameo as a talent booker near the start of the film which I didn't originally notice and a very Jackson 5-like group also makes a few fun appearances.David Geffen spent 20+ years trying to make this film and originally wanted Whitney Houston (pre-Bodyguard) to star as Deena Jones, but talks fell apart. Lauryn Hill almost got the role at one point, too, but Beyonce Knowles actively fought for it and when she finally won over the producers it really paid off for all involved.Even if you don't enjoy musicals (or hate them with a fiery passion), give this film a try and you might just be surprised.(Worth noting: My review is based on watching the single-disc widescreen DVD version of Dreamgirls.

1061749,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000O174CM,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[21, 25]","Musicals aren't really my thing. Many feel forced as the cast breaks out into song at the most bizarre of times. Cheesy is perhaps the best descriptor, but occasionally I enjoy a good toe-tapping flick if it's done right. And DREAMGIRLS is definitely done right. It certainly ranks up there with MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO as one of the more recently successful musical films, it too being a period piece (covering the late 50s through the early 70s).Acting in these style of films tends to lend itself more to dance moves than actual roleplaying of characters, but there are two highly mentionable performances in Dreamgirls: first time actress Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame, and a major comeback role for Eddie Murphy. Hudson took home Best Actress trophies from The Golden Globes, The BAFTAs, The Screen Actors Guild and The Oscars for her portrayal of Effie White, the powerful and ultimately embittered lead singer for The Dreamettes. Eddie Murphy as James ""Thunder"" Early is surprisingly excellent, perhaps helping wash away the stains of DADDY DAYCARE and THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH from his more recent, acting, downward spiral. Murphy can sing alongside Hudson and Beyonce and hold his own, too.The added entertaining fact about Dreamgirls is that there's an actual story behind the music, making this film much more watchable than many musicals which rely solely on their high notes rather than acting skill. This story is firmly entrenched in the early music industry as a ""white-washed"" form of entertainment, separating it from ""black music""...until Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx, JARHEAD), a car salesman in search of more, jumps into the music biz and launches his own record label (Rainbow Records). Foxx's Taylor character is another smashing success for him in that he makes this man both lovable and despised as he turns from caring manager to control freak.Likewise, Murphy's Early character is someone who's moral ground we're never quite sure of. He's a married man with womanizing tendencies, but he's also a musical purist, trying to create sounds that are true to him while at the same time dismantling what he once was (a great, yet small, singing sensation). His fall from grace hits the viewer hard as heroin, time, and his own industry begin taking their toll.But veterans Murphy and Foxx can't hold a candle to newcomer Hudson's performance. She is the crux that holds the entire production together, and she does so with power, grace and a great emotional range. The ending is sure to choke-up many viewers.The only complaint I can lodge against the entire film was within one small section where Effie (Hudson) breaks out into a long chorus about being wronged by Foxx and the other Dreamettes. This seemed rather awkward and I would've liked to have seen this acted out in dialogue rather than burst into song.Still, this is a powerful musical film that deserves much praise ...and has rightfully gotten it.",5,Eddie Can Sing!,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2944,"['Musicals', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'thing', 'Many', 'feel', 'forced', 'cast', 'out', 'song', 'most', 'bizarre', 'times', 'Cheesy', 'perhaps', 'best', 'descriptor', 'occasionally', 'enjoy', 'good', 'toe-tapping', 'flick', 'done', 'right', 'DREAMGIRLS', 'definitely', 'done', 'right', 'certainly', 'up', 'there', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'CHICAGO', 'one', 'more', 'recently', 'successful', 'musical', 'films', 'too', 'being', 'period', 'piece', 'covering', 'late', '50s', 'early', '70s', '.Acting', 'style', 'films', 'tends', 'lend', 'more', 'dance', 'moves', 'actual', 'roleplaying', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'highly', 'mentionable', 'performances', 'Dreamgirls', 'first', 'time', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'American', 'Idol', 'fame', 'major', 'comeback', 'role', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Hudson', 'took', 'home', 'Best', 'Actress', 'trophies', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'BAFTAs', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'Oscars', 'portrayal', 'Effie', 'White', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'embittered', 'lead', 'singer', 'Dreamettes', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'perhaps', 'helping', 'wash', 'away', 'stains', 'DADDY', 'DAYCARE', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'PLUTO', 'NASH', 'more', 'recent', 'acting', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Murphy', 'can', 'sing', 'alongside', 'Hudson', 'Beyonce', 'hold', 'own', 'too.The', 'added', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'Dreamgirls', 'actual', 'story', 'music', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'watchable', 'many', 'musicals', 'rely', 'solely', 'high', 'notes', 'rather', 'acting', 'skill', 'story', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'early', 'music', 'industry', 'white-washed', 'form', 'entertainment', 'separating', 'black', 'music', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'JARHEAD', 'car', 'salesman', 'search', 'more', 'music', 'biz', 'own', 'record', 'label', 'Rainbow', 'Records', 'Foxx', 'Taylor', 'character', 'smashing', 'success', 'man', 'lovable', 'despised', 'caring', 'manager', 'control', 'freak.Likewise', 'Murphy', 'Early', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'moral', 'ground', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'married', 'man', 'womanizing', 'tendencies', 'also', 'musical', 'purist', 'trying', 'create', 'sounds', 'are', 'true', 'same', 'time', 'dismantling', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'great', 'yet', 'small', 'singing', 'sensation', 'fall', 'grace', 'viewer', 'hard', 'heroin', 'time', 'own', 'industry', 'begin', 'taking', 'toll.But', 'veterans', 'Murphy', 'Foxx', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'newcomer', 'Hudson', 'performance', 'crux', 'entire', 'production', 'together', 'so', 'power', 'grace', 'great', 'emotional', 'range', 'ending', 'sure', 'choke-up', 'many', 'viewers.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'lodge', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'small', 'section', 'where', 'Effie', 'Hudson', 'out', 'long', 'chorus', 'being', 'wronged', 'Foxx', 'other', 'Dreamettes', 'seemed', 'rather', 'awkward', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'acted', 'out', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'burst', 'song.Still', 'powerful', 'musical', 'film', 'much', 'praise', 'rightfully', 'gotten']",N/A

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 4]","I was very entertained by the movie, and loved the music, the production, and the acting--especially the Oscar nominated supporting actor performance of Eddie Murphy, and most of all the Oscar winning supporting actress nomination for Jennifer Hudson. What a dream for her to go from losing on American Idol to winning an Oscar! The film was dazzling--like a dream--but when I woke up, I had some qualms and questions about it.When you create a fictional narrative, you must create a universe to contain that story. You have awesome power, but also you have awesome responsibility. The risk is that you will create a straw man argument, or engage in historical revisionism. Fiction has been defined as a way of lying to tell the truth, but here I thought that there was too much baggage, too much hidden agenda, and I lost faith in it.Jennifer Hudson was really great and deserved her Oscar, though a friend said she wasn't acting so much as singing. She sang supremely, though. The movie was kind of skewed to be more about her, a lead singer forced to become a background singer, and then fired just as the group was poised for enormous success. Everything was viewed through that distorted prism, and the success of the group with Deena Jones (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) at the helm was discounted, as if the group had sold out, had gone commercial. It seemed strange that in a musical where they sang about everything from brushing their teeth to riding the bus, after Hudson is jettisoned, their string of hits is not even heard, but just seen in montage as a series of sheet music covers, and an announcer voice-over describing their amazing success. There is absolutely nothing about the life or feelings of Deena Jones, a thinly veiled Diana Ross, and finally the group is shown retiring, and calling back Effie (Hudson) for their farewell performance swan song. Beyonc&eacute; really doesn't get a chance to act, just really looks great. The movie is framed to suggest that she doesn't really have musical talent, but is just a pretty face. At one point their manager, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) even says that he chose her to front the group because she was so bland that anyone could project their own feelings onto her. Effie sang more like Aretha Franklin, but I don't recall that she began her career as a back up singer for The Supremes.I also had problems with the character played by Eddie Murphy, James ""Thunder"" Early. Though I enjoyed his performance immensely, his character was given short shrift, because it was all about Effie. He was supposed to be an amalgamation of James Brown, Little Richard, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Wilson Pickett, which took him in too many directions, being all things to all people. The story, being all about Effie, dictated that he was on the way down. A Star is Born, while another star falls. I enjoyed one scene a lot when he suddenly stopped singing the ballad he was supposed to do, and went into a very funky James Brown style number, dropping his pants on the coda. But, I don't think that ever actually happened. In spite of my problems with the story, Eddie Murphy did some great acting, and also showed that he has a very musical side as well.Jamie Foxx is another actor who is also very musical. His character, Curtis Taylor Jr., is a thinly veiled Berry Gordy Jr., but he was not served well by the story, either. He doesn't get much chance to show his musical side, and is shown as being more of a car salesman who only enters the music business to make money. Without him, they probably wouldn't have achieved their phenomenal success, but once they have it made, the script and the other characters turn against him.The film started out with regular dialogue, and music performed where appropriate, such as on stage at a talent show. But then midway, the characters start singing instead of talking. It is kind of jarring. If you would like to see an entire film with singing instead of dialogue, I recommend seeing The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a French film from 1964. The music is by Michel Legrand, and one of the songs, ""Watch What Happens,"" is now considered a jazz standard. ""I Will Wait For You"" was a recurring theme, and is a very haunting and romantic theme, indeed. It is a very romantic movie, starring a 20 year-old Catherine Deneuve. Ooh la la.Another film I can endorse, if you want to know the REAL story of Motown, is Standing in the Shadows of Motown. Instead of focusing on a back up singer from an ersatz Supremes, it tells the story of The Funk Brothers, who were the back up group recording for all the Motown roster. James Jamerson, the bass player, never got song writing credit, but what a contribution he made to the Motown Sound. Here we learn that while on the road, he annoyed the other Funk Brothers by smoking cigars and eating pickled pig's feet. None of the musicians got writing credit, but they played on more hit songs than The Beatles. There were three guitars in the rhythm section, and one of the guitarists was White. I mention that because he is interviewed about how he got along with everyone, and he says he never had any problems with the other musicians, but during a race riot in Detroit, he was trapped in the studio. There is a scene like that in Dreamgirls, but Effie is pretty oblivious to the riot, it is only a backdrop to her own drama.",4,Burrito Supremes,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,5367,"['was', 'very',

1061763,A278AF56R7J86,B000O174CM,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[3, 10]","This film was widely acclaimed for it's powerful music, and it's awe-inspiring Oscar nominated performances by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. While I agree the music was nice, and the performances overall were fairly solid...I just didn't feel awed or inspired.""Dreamgirls"" chronicles the trials and tribulations of an African American girl group called the 'Dreamettes' as they struggle to top the pop charts in a hostile 1960's social environment. Effie (Jennifer Hudson) is the lead singer of the group, with power-house vocals, and star quality. After Effie is pushed aside in the group to allow the skinnier, prettier Deena (Beyonce Knowles) to take the lead, resentment builds within Effie as the group starts to take-off into stardom.Musicals can be a tricky thing to bring to life on film. How does one address the issue of at least semi-believabley explaining why the main characters are periodically bursting into song? The 2002 Best Picture winnerChicago (Widescreen Edition)solved this dilemma by depicting the music and dance numbers as taking place within the confines of Roxy Hart's imagination. Unfortunately, ""Dreamgirls"" seemed like it couldn't make up it's mind as far as the logistics of the music numbers. At first all the songs are performed onstage by the various music groups, which is a perfectly real and believable occurence. Then, however, the film suddenly switches gears and has the actors begin to burst out into song in the middle of a scene. This change of cinematography is a little disorienting, and kind of off-putting. As if thats not enough, the movie begins drifting back and forth between the two versions. I think it would have been better, and far more enjoyable, if the film had simply chosen one format and stuck with it.The story is obviously loosely based on the popular girl group ""The Supremes"", who featured Diana Ross as it's lead singer. As it is, Diana Ross became very upset with the portrayal of the 'Dreamettes' in this film -- not because she took offense to the portrayal in reference to her roots singing with 'The Supremes', but because she claimed the story portrayed in ""Dreamgirls"" was altered only just enough to avoid paying her royalties for use of her story. Either way, the music in the film was incredible at first, and then slowly began to grow tiresome. After awhile, all the songs sounded the same! There wasn't much variety at all, which made me grow bored with it enough to start fast-forwarding through some of them.As far as the acting goes, I think that all the actors did a great job. This was truly an all-star cast, with the new-comer Jennifer Hudson snagging the only Academy Award for her performance. I have a feeling I might upset some fans with this next comment but...after watching this film I kind of felt like Jennifer Hudson, while her performance was great (especially for it being her first film ever) wasn't entirely deserving of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She's a phenomenal singer, as many will witness in this film, but I'm just not sure her acting was worth an Academy Award.The only special features available on this single-disc edition are alternate/extended scenes, and a music video ""Listen"" by Beyonce Knowles. If you enjoy having a wide variety of special features, it would be better to purchase the 2-disc special edition.Bottom line, this film is a bit of a mixed bag. Nice music, good acting, and absolutely gorgeous costume design. Fans of musicals will enjoy it more than the rest of the population, but it's certainly worth at least one viewing.",3,"Nice music, beautiful costumes, but overall a little disappointing...",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3566,"['film', 'was', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'powerful', 'music', 'awe-inspiring', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'agree', 'music', 'was', 'nice', 'performances', 'overall', 'were', 'fairly', 'solid', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'awed', 'inspired', 'Dreamgirls', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'African', 'American', 'girl', 'group', 'called', ""'Dreamettes"", 'struggle', 'top', 'pop', 'charts', 'hostile', '1960', 'social', 'environment', 'Effie', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'lead', 'singer', 'group', 'power-house', 'vocals', 'star', 'quality', 'Effie', 'pushed', 'aside', 'group', 'allow', 'skinnier', 'prettier', 'Deena', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'take', 'lead', 'resentment', 'builds', 'Effie', 'group', 'take-off', 'stardom.Musicals', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'thing', 'bring', 'life', 'film', 'How', 'one', 'address', 'issue', 'least', 'semi-believabley', 'explaining', 'why', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'periodically', 'bursting', 'song', '2002', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winnerChicago', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'solved', 'dilemma', 'depicting', 'music', 'dance', 'numbers', 'taking', 'place', 'confines', 'Roxy', 'Hart', 'imagination', 'Unfortunately', 'Dreamgirls', 'seemed', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'as', 'far', 'logistics', 'music', 'numbers', 'first', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'onstage', 'various', 'music', 'groups', 'perfectly', 'real', 'believable', 'occurence', 'Then', 'however', 'film', 'suddenly', 'gears', 'actors', 'begin', 'burst', 'out', 'song', 'middle', 'scene', 'change', 'cinematography', 'little', 'disorienting', 'kind', 'off-putting', 'thats', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'drifting', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'versions', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'had', 'simply', 'chosen', 'one', 'format', 'stuck', 'it.The', 'story', 'obviously', 'loosely', 'based', 'popular', 'girl', 'group', 'Supremes', 'who', 'featured', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'lead', 'singer', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'became', 'very', 'upset', 'portrayal', ""'Dreamettes"", 'film', 'not', 'took', 'offense', 'portrayal', 'reference', 'roots', 'singing', ""'The"", 'Supremes', 'claimed', 'story', 'portrayed', 'Dreamgirls', 'was', 'altered', 'only', 'just', 'enough', 'avoid', 'paying', 'royalties', 'use', 'story', 'way', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'incredible', 'first', 'then', 'slowly', 'began', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'awhile', 'songs', 'sounded', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'variety', 'made', 'grow', 'bored', 'enough', 'start', 'fast-forwarding', 'them.As', 'far', 'acting', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'truly', 'all-star', 'cast', 'new-comer', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'snagging', 'only', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'have', 'feeling', 'might', 'upset', 'fans', 'next', 'comment', 'watching', 'film', 'kind', 'felt', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'performance', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'deserving', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'phenomenal', 'singer', 'many', 'will', 'witness', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'acting', 'was', 'worth', 'Academy', 'Award.The', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'available', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'are', 'alternate/extended', 'scenes', 'music', 'video', 'Listen', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'enjoy', 'having', 'wide', 'variety', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'purchase', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Nice', 'music', 'good', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'costume', 'design', 'Fans', 'musicals', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'rest', 'population', 'certainly', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

1061765,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000O174CM,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 8]","I'm sure that ""Dreamgirls"" will rank with some of the more famous musical play adaptations, and rightfully so; not only is it a thoroughly entertaining film, it's also incredibly well made, from the performances to the costumes to the overall look. We have writer/director Bill Condon--who penned the screenplay to 2002's ""Chicago""--to thank for this adaptation of the original Broadway musical. Here's a film that's truly alive, with vibrant colors, energetic, soulful music, and singing voices that definitely do justice to the material. I can't say whether or not these qualities will result in a successful movie; over the past a couple of years, a number of well-made musical films were overlooked or flatly rejected (""The Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Rent,"" and ""The Producers"" come to mind). Here's hoping for some recognition.I say this because, within the scope of the narrative, ""Dreamgirls"" is a winner, from the very first frame to the last. Never once did it seem as if something was lacking or improperly handled; everything felt absolutely right. There are a number of possible factors: good casting; decent script; a simple yet significant story; a gathering of exciting, show stopping musical numbers. This film has it all, and it's sure to completely satisfy those in need of Broadway experience outside of Broadway. I'm afraid I can't say how faithful this film adaptation is to the original play, nor can I speculate on how accurately it portrays the real life story of The Supremes. What I can say is that this film is able to stand on its own, and making comparisons to different material is unnecessary.The basic plot is about three singers and their whirlwind journey through music superstardom. Beginning in mid-1960s Detroit, Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and Effie Melody White (Jennifer Hudson) are part of a struggling girl band called The Dreamettes. They're about ready to give up because they've been together a number of years without having gotten a break. But then they meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a smooth talking music producer/used car salesman (which already should be indicative of an interesting journey). He offers them the chance to sing backup for James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy), both locally and while he's on tour. Naturally, the girls accept (although Effie needed a little more convincing than the other two).Meeting Early is like hitting a brick wall, for both the girls and the audience. He's not charming, but he sure is magnetic, a trait that barely surpasses his wild onstage persona and offstage arrogance. Even his manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), isn't in a position of control; Early will only do what he wants to do. I got the sense that Murphy put everything he had into this role, which is good because it resulted in one of his best, most memorable performances. The same can be said for Knowles, who at last has been given the chance to show some acting talent (which couldn't have been said for films like ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" or ""The Pink Panther""). She gives Deena a sweet yet determined demeanor, fueled by the desire to sing. Her desire only gets stronger as the national tour becomes successful and recording offers are made.Deena and Lorrell begin the film as backup singers for Effie, who clearly has the more dominant voice (and Jennifer Hudson certainly lets us know this; just try to keep your hands apart after her renditions of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" and ""Love You I Do""). But as the three drift apart from Early and begin their own act, Taylor insists that Deena become the lead singer. Understandably, Effie isn't happy about this. Thus begins the first of many ups and downs the girls will have to endure, not helped by the fact that Effie and Taylor are romantically involved. Everyone begins to feel as if Effie is too demanding, too outspoken, and too inflexible for the good of the group. After much offstage squabbling, she's unceremoniously replaced by Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal).The story then stretches out for about eight years, bringing the story into the 1970s. Many things happen during that time, both good and bad: Deena and Taylor get married; Lorrell and Early continue a love affair; many new albums are recorded; Deena is signed on to play Cleopatra; and Effie struggles to revive her career, a situation made worse by the fact that she's now a single mother. We also witness the growing tension between Taylor and songwriter Clarence Conrad ""C.C."" White (Keith Robinson), Effie's brother. For years, C.C.'s songs--sung by Early and The Dreams--were subject to heavy revisions, both in terms of the music and lyrics. From Taylor's point of view, it's strictly a matter of business; songs have to be a certain way if they're to make an album sell. But from C.C.'s point of view, the integrity of his work is suffering. None of this is helped by the fact that he and Effie haven't spoken in a couple of years (C.C. supported the rest of the group instead of her).All the human drama prevents the film from losing itself; it's not too bright and bubbly, but it's not too melodramatic, either. This very easily could have turned into a hollow story, something that was all glitz but no substance. A real story is being told here, one that would work even if it weren't told in the language of song. I also appreciated how it plausibly portrays the roller coaster ride that fame is; we're not spared the reality that celebrities can crash and burn much more easily than they can climb to the top. Such ingredients made for one of the year's most entertaining films, one that ends just as strongly as it begins. I can't say whether or not everything turns out okay for The Dreams (assuming you've never seen the play), but I guarantee you that finding out will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",5,Life Would

I respect and admired the cast but the best were from Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, and Eddie Murphy.  Jamie Foxx was good but not exactly his cup of tea compared to his Oscar-winning role as Ray Charles in Ray.  Beyonce was great I confess, she earned herself a Golden Globe Nomination for her acting but I guess the Academy did not consider her to be better.  Either way Hudson and Murphy really stole the show.  Murphy when it comes to conversing himself to his role, he really did well.  Comparing Murphy to his role, they could not be a better combination especially when their egos are just the same.  James Thunder Earrly was a singer in his own time so was Eddie Murphy as a comedian and just like Earrly he loses.  Not alot of people know this, but Murphy was going through a divorce with his wife at the time and he was spending time with his fiance who is now not.  Either way Murphy lost his Oscar to the old guy from Little Miss Sunshine.  Hudson on the other hand plays a woman who had her ups and downs in her singing career and in the end she wins back what she lost and ironically Hudson wins the Oscar and that is where her singing career started.  Either way very entertaining and mostly musical to a point where you are cheering for the cast like crazy.",4,Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,1319,"['anyone', 'who', 'musicals', 'keeper', 'respect', 'admired', 'cast', 'best', 'were', 'Beyonce', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'exactly', 'cup', 'tea', 'compared', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Ray', 'Beyonce', 'was', 'great', 'confess', 'earned', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Nomination', 'acting', 'guess', 'Academy', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'Hudson', 'Murphy', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'Murphy', 'when', 'conversing', 'role', 'really', 'did', 'well', 'Comparing', 'Murphy', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'combination', 'especially', 'when', 'egos', 'are', 'just', 'same', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Earrly', 'was', 'singer', 'own', 'time', 'so', 'was', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'comedian', 'just', 'Earrly', 'Not', 'people', 'know', 'Murphy', 'was', 'going', 'divorce', 'wife', 'time', 'was', 'spending', 'time', 'fiance', 'who', 'now', 'not', 'way', 'Murphy', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'old', 'guy', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Hudson', 'other', 'hand', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'singing', 'career', 'end', 'back', 'what', 'lost', 'ironically', 'Hudson', 'Oscar', 'where', 'singing', 'career', 'started', 'way', 'very', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'musical', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'cheering', 'cast', 'crazy']",N/A
1061767,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B000O174CM,Christie W.,"[3, 4]","I rented this movie mostly to see Jennifer Hudson.  Had been a fan of hers from American Idol and have only heard wonderful things about her performance in Dreamgirls.  I'd say America got it VERY wrong that she was booted; but who's laughing now, with a Golden Globe, an Oscar,etc, etc...WOW!! The moment ""Effie"" stepped on screen, Jennifer put herself above the rest, in a league of her own.  And the minute she started singing... Words can't describe.  The power and strength of emotion that she was able to show, in just her eyes, when she sang ""I'm Not Going""... I sat there speechless.  It was unbelievable.  In that moment alone, she was worthy of all the accolades.  I haven't seen an experienced actress, let alone an actress in her DEBUT performance, put that much emotion into a character EVER!!I am in total awe of her talent- she has amazing strength and range in her voice.  I agree wholeheartedly with my fellow reviewer who said ""Beyonce who??"" (Though, I was surprised at her performance.  I didn't hate it.  The last couple of films she ""acted"" in, she was pretty horrible- Foxy Cleopatra...  But here, she was much better.  That said, she still couldn't steal the show from Jennifer.)After about an hour and a half, the film started to drag for me.  The singing instead of talking out the lines was annoying, but that's a musical for you.  The soundtrack is amazing.  There are MANY many strong, amazing vocals.Overall, a powerful story about beating the odds, rising into stardom, the importance of true family and true friends, and not selling out your self along the way.  The real story is Effie White.  If for no other reason, watch this for Jennifer Hudson's performance.  Watch and be in awe of her amazing voice.  Kudos, Jennifer!!P.S.  Just a fun tidbit.  In the very beginning, Jaleel White (better known as Steve Urkel from Family Matters) has an itty-bitty part.  Boy, it's weird seeing him period, but without the glasses or suspenders- it's hard to recognize him. lol =D",4,Wow!

She exudes the emotional depth and subtleties of the well-written character Effie White. I could not help admire how the numbers were cleverly arranged with no dialogue needed. The singing itself and the shots spoke it all, as ""Family"" demonstrated when all tried to persuade Effie to cede singing lead. Jennifer Hudson's powerful, rich, brassy voice is unforgettable - a desperate voice to be heard. Whether she was protesting being replaced by Sharon Leal in the trio - they sang ""It's all over"" and she sang ""And I'm telling you I'm not going"", or fighting for a living in ""I'm changing"", her performances were marvelous and unparalleled. When the Dreamgirls bade farewell in the end, she was exuberant and sang her heart out to her little darling. It is simply a delight to watch the ups and downs (or rather the downs and ups) of Effie White.Other characters are also very watchable and their voices most creditable - Jamie Fox, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson (as C.C. White), Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, Queen Lativah. Needless to say, Beyonce Knowles paled in comparison because of her difficult role. Maybe she was too beautiful, maybe her character, Deena Jones, was too perfect and thus appeared unreal and weak when compared with the struggles of those around her. Jennifer Hudson's role as Effie White, by contrast, was all flesh and blood.This could easily have been a movie more on Effie White and less on Deena Jones. The movie could have been more like All about Eve, placing equal emphasis on Bette Davis and Anne Baxter.

1061772,A21Q5TN3BJKIC2,B000O174CM,"Cole M ""Cole M""","[1, 4]","Dreamgirls embodies the late 60's and 70's, the story of an all girl trio that overcomes diversity to become one of the biggest groups of it's time.  The story revolves around the  charachter of Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) and her rise and fall from the ""Dreams"".What was initially a star Vehicle for Beyonce, the fims true standout was the performance by Jennifer Hudson.  Hudson's performance, to be compared with Barbera Streisands Debut in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in the Rose, was spiritual and truly transending.  A star is truly born in this performance.  Jamie Fox's role as Curtis is strong and Eddie Murphey's portrayel of a troubled drug abusing singer is the best of his film career.  Beyonce holds her own as Deena the lead singer of ""The Dreams"".  Beyonce's voice suits the simplicity of the era's music. The film is written and acted in a way that you connect with the struggles of the charachters.Musically the film is strong.  Jennifer Hudson tackles the classics of Jennifer Holiday including a great new song ""Love you I do"".  Hudson outdoes herself on her rendition of ""And I""m telling you I'm not going"" and her soulful, heartwrenching ""One Night Only"" is trandsending.  Hudson's songs are the most powerful, the songs that actually portray the storys of the film.  Beyonce stands out with her voice embodying the simplicity of 60's music.  Knowles disco version of ""One Night Only"" is infectious with it's powerful bass line and effortless vocals.  ""Listen"" is indeed her crowning moment.  The song brings closure and redemption for her charachter.Dreamgirls is one of the best films I have seen in recent years, and by far the best musical. To describe this film as a truly spiritual experience, is not an understatment.  Hudsons in particular was destined to play this part.

I'm the type of guy that likes to watch my movies in silence, so I can get everything the first time and not have to watch it again because I missed a whole scene because the idiot in front of me decided to get out his lighter (serious, that happened).  THAT aside, `Dreamgirls' was a great experience.  While not as great as the hype would suggest, I've learned that to almost always be true and thus forgo the hype when walking through the cinema doors.`Dreamgirls' chronicles the careers of Supremes knockoffs `The Dreams', Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Effie (Jennifer Hudson).  Singing together for years they have strived to make it to the top, and one night after singing in a competition and catching the ear of aspiring producer Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) they get their big break singing backup for superstar James `Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy).  Effie immediately stands out as the backbone and spokesperson of the group, giving Curtis a hard time about the mere fact they are singing backup.  Her persistence both pays off and in a way breaks her down as Curtis decides to make them stars, moving Deena to the front of the band and in a way moving Effie out completely.The movie succeeds to sheer brilliance when its female costars are acting through song, Hudson earning her soon to be Oscar with her gut wrenching `And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' while Beyonce blew me away with her equally powerful `Listen' which gave me Goosebumps.  The film has everything going for it, and while it's not perfect, it's not too far off either.  I still feel that some past musicals (`Chicago' & `Moulin Rouge' come to mind) are better films, but what makes `Dreamgirls' so outstanding is that they got the feeling, the singing and the actins spot on.  Unlike say `Chicago', `Dreamgirls' doesn't have ONE bad note in the singing department.This film is one of the better cast films I've ever seen, every acting playing their role to perfection.  Eddie Murphy gave a career best here, Beyonce underplayed splendidly (it was nice to see her not try to be the center of attention, and so for me in a lot of ways she stood out), Anika Noni Rose does wonderfully as the nave member of the group, Danny Glover is great here as is Keith Robinson, and while I'm not a Foxx fan I will admit that he fit nicly here.  The real star though was newcomer Jennifer Hudson who can not only sing circles around the rest of the cast but is such a talented actress, and for her first role, I mean come on.

1061776,A15G4HQNY9TDOM,B000O174CM,"Daniel Middleton ""Publisher, 711 Press""","[4, 13]","I absolutely hated this film! But let me explain. The film was supposed to be a period drama or musical of some sort (it was based on a play), but instead of evoking the '60s with its musical renditions, the female trio that forms the movie's singing group sounds more like a recent R&B; act. This shatters any nostalgia one can hope to have, and it makes the movie seem unbelievable in spots. The only song that sounds remotely '60s-era is the one sung by James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy), ""Steppin' to the Bad Side.""Beyond that, the movie goes all over the place, not really establishing a solid, focused storyline. The film is loosely based on The Supremes, but since it isn't a full-blown biopic, in the vein of Ray or Walk the Line, the film heads out in every direction it can without settling on a good one. The performances are okay, if you can stomach the awkward scenes where dialogue is sung--beginning about a third of the way in--and I say awkward because Dreamgirls, unlike Chicago, or any popular film based on a musical, does not start out like a musical at all, but it eventually ends up being one (we can probably blame that on the play it is borrowed from).Eddie Murphy, though in rare form, couldn't save this film, and Jamie Foxx is wasted here--he even seems bored with the role.

(If you ever lived in the City of Baltimore - The Senator, with probably the single largest movie screen in Maryland, is in danger of closing it's doors forever.) However, I did enter the theater with hope, no matter how slight, that I would leave feeling entertained!Call me old-fashioned, but I like to care about at least one of the characters in a story. Even in a godforsaken, awful movie I will sit through the whole tedious thing, if I can empathize with at least a single character. In Dreamgirls, I literally felt like I was watching an obnoxious soap opera with very shallow two-dimensional characters. Who cares about a bunch of  rich & famous show business losers?For example, after hearing one character say: "" I spent half a million dollars (in 1960's dollars) on drinking.""  I practically groaned and said to myself, ""as a young adult, you had nothing better to do with your money during the height of the Vietnam War & the Civil Rights movement then spend it on booze? How inspiring!Granted the cinematography and costumes are absolutely magnificent - the reason for  giving this film two stars, instead of one. But that's icing on the cake.  After a while it wears thin and it certainly does not carry a story to its conclusion.This movie is all flash and no substance. While there is certainly nothing offensive in this overblown production, having a wry sense of humor, like the very clever Chicago, would have done this film wonders. Also having fewer characters, and better editing, would not have hurt either.I found it quite ironic that one of the songs performed in Dreamgirls was along the lines of  ""I've got soul,"" something this shallow film sorely lacked!",2,Tedious Soap Opera Musical!

But this brilliant musical doesn't belong to either of these two.  It belongs, instead, to Eddie Murphy and newcomer, Jennifer Hudson, who both deserve the stacks of awards that are being awarded them.The story follows the rise of three friends and aspiring singers played by Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, and Jennifer Hudson.  Found by Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jaime Foxx), the girls start out as a backup singer for James ""Thunder"" Early (Murphy).  Effie, the curvy and opinionated lead singer uneasily gives up the lead so that the group can get the big break they need.  Along the climb to the top, she begins a romance with Curtis but slowly looses her promised chance for fame to the lesser talented but beautiful and thin, Deena (Knowles). Eventually, betrayed even by her brother, Effie is ousted from the group (branded too troublesome) as it begins its meteoric rise to super stardom.After seeing this movie, I was stunned to see it left out of the best picture category of the Academy Awards.  That said, the members of the academy can still right this wrong by giving the best supporting nods (and deservedly so) to Murphy and Hudson.  Hudson, especially, shines as the shunned Effie White, giving a goosebump producing show stopper singing ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"".  Being ousted from American Idol was the best thing ever to happen to the powerhoused voiced Hudson.  Murphy, whose career has been spent entertaining the masses with low brow comedy should finally get the chance to win an Oscar that he might never have thought been possible for him to win.And the soundtrack is perfect, befitting the decades that the group grows through and compliments the film perfectly.

1061780,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000O174CM,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","I feel it incumbent to weigh in on the Oscar controversy surrounding ""Dreamgirls"".  Not having seen the film at the time the nominations were announced, I was taken aback nonetheless by it's shutout in the Best Picture category because of it's win at the Golden Globes and the pre-nomination forecasts.  Having now seen the film my feeling is it wouldn't have been out of place in the Best Picture category but 2006 was a strong year for pictures.  I can think off the top of my head three films that also could very well have been nominated(""Blood Diamond"", ""Children of Men"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"").  As far as Alan Arkin's upset of Eddie Murphy in the Supporting Actor category, well, the Academy got it right in my humble opinion.  For sure Murphy's account of James ""Thunder"" Early was an impressive piece of acting it brought to my mind Murphy's send-up of James Brown on ""Saturday Night Live"" 25 years ago.  I was more impressed with Murphy's work in ""The Nutty Professor"" in 1996 which he won a New York Film Critics Circle award for.  As for Jennifer Hudson, there should have been an inquest if she were denied the Best Supporting Actress award.  It's been years since an actress has come on the scene and dominated a picture like Hudson does here.  When she's not on screen, the energy level of the picture goes down slightly.  Her showstopper, ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" should be listed as one of the classic moments of American film.  I remember when Hudson was on ""American Idol"" and she was criminally voted off early in the competition.  I think alot of it had to do with the unseemly harsh criticism directed at her by Simon Cowell.  Hudson maintained her dignity but was no shrinking violet in the face of these barbs.  My gut tells me that Hudson chanelled that experience into her performance here.  Jennifer got her revenge on Simon.  As for the film itself it's a better-than-average fictionalized account of the Supremes story.  Hudson's song aside, the music is good but not indelible.  What distinguishes the film is the superb ensemble acting.  Oddly enough, the underrated Danny Glover got scant mention in the film's reviews.  My guess is that he is so consistent that he tends to be overlooked.  If the film has a weakness I would have to say it's the film's ostensible star, Beyonce Knowles.  Knowles is extremely attractive and a very good singer but she leaves a little to be desired in the acting category.  The makers of the film, cognizant of this, cleverly tailored the film around Knowles' acting deficiencies.",4,And The Winner Is...,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",2007,2549,"['feel', 'incumbent', 'weigh', 'Oscar', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'Dreamgirls', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'time', 'nominations', 'were', 'announced', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'nonetheless', 'shutout', 'Best', 'Picture', 'category', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'pre-nomination', 'forecasts', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'feeling', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'place', 'Best', 'Picture', 'category', '2006', 'was', 'strong', 'year', 'pictures', 'can', 'think', 'off', 'top', 'head', 'three', 'films', 'also', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'Children', 'Men', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'As', 'far', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'upset', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'category', 'well', 'Academy', 'got', 'right', 'humble', 'opinion', 'sure', 'Murphy', 'account', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'was', 'impressive', 'piece', 'acting', 'brought', 'mind', 'Murphy', 'send-up', 'James', 'Brown', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'Murphy', 'work', 'Nutty', 'Professor', '1996', 'won', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Circle', 'award', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'inquest', 'were', 'denied', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'award', 'been', 'years', 'actress', 'come', 'scene', 'dominated', 'picture', 'Hudson', 'here', 'When', 'not', 'screen', 'energy', 'level', 'picture', 'down', 'slightly', 'Her', 'showstopper', ""'m"", 'Telling', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Going', 'should', 'be', 'listed', 'one', 'classic', 'moments', 'American', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'Hudson', 'was', 'American', 'Idol', 'was', 'criminally', 'voted', 'off', 'early', 'competition', 'think', 'had', 'do', 'unseemly', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'directed', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'Hudson', 'maintained', 'dignity', 'was', 'shrinking', 'violet', 'face', 'barbs', 'gut', 'tells', 'Hudson', 'chanelled', 'experience', 'performance', 'here', 'Jennifer', 'got', 'revenge', 'Simon', 'film', 'better-than-average', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Supremes', 'story', 'Hudson', 'song', 'aside', 'music', 'good', 'not', 'indelible', 'What', 'film', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'underrated', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'got', 'scant', 'mention', 'film', 'reviews', 'guess', 'so', 'consistent', 'be', 'overlooked', 'film', 'weakness', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'ostensible', 'star', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Knowles', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'acting', 'category', 'makers', 'film', 'cognizant', 'cleverly', 'tailored', 'film', 'Knowles', 'acting', 'deficiencies']",N/A

It's safe to say, ""A star was born."" And apparently, there was a since of reciprocity attached to this role because Jennifer Hudson thumped Fantasia to win the role of Effie and the rest as they is history. She became the first African American woman to win an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actress) in her debut appearance (not that race is an issue). Eddie Murphy also turns in the best performance of his career as Jimmy Thunder. It was refreshing to finally see him in something besides an Urkel-like character. Although I did love this film, I have to give it three very strong stars because I think both Beyonce Knowles (although it was a passable performance) and Jamie Foxx were poor choices for their respective characters. I'm not sure Knowles has enough acting experience to pull off poignant performances yet, and Foxx (except for his Ray performance) simply always looks like he's on the verge of telling a joke or making a funny face.

Much to my surprise, I was not.  Don't get me wrong:  the movie does have its flaws.  I found that when there wasn't any music, the movie tended to drag.  But, thankfully, there's enough of music and the viewer can fill in the rest however he/she pleases!""Dreamgirls"" is the movie adaptation of the Broadway hit that originally starred Jennifer Holiday in the role of Effie (played here TO THE MAX by Jennifer Hudson).  It was loosely based on the rise (and downfall) of the 1960s-70s meteoric hit group ""The Supremes.""  Set in Detroit in the early 1960s, Beyonce Knowles is cast as Deena Jones (loosely derived from Diana Ross); Jennifer Hudson is cast as Effie White, and Anika Noni Rose plays (very effetively) the third Dreamgirl, Lorrell Robinson).  Jamie Foxx plays agent/manager Curtis Taylor, Jr. and Eddie Murphy plays Jamess ""Thunder"" Early.  Both Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy logged Oscar nominations; Hudson won for best supporting actress; Murphy lost in the best supporting actor category.Beyonce does a very good service to Deena Jones; Anika Rose is fabulous as Lorrell Robinson.  As stated above, however, it was Jennifer Hudson whose performance blew me out of the water.  Effie is the true talent of the three songstresses.  She can belt out a tune like nobody's business; however, Jamie Foxx decides in order for his group to become a mainstay, he must pander to the white audience and make his group sound ""less black.""  Therefore, he switches lead singers in mid-stream:  Effie now plays second fiddle to Deena.  When everyone finally reaches their breaking point, Jennifer Hudson sings ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" and, honey, if you are not moved by that song, you're dead.  I got up from my chair and screamed after it was over--that's how moving it is.I was disappointed in Jamie Foxx's playing of his character, Curtis Taylor, Jr.  He was supposed to be mean (he tried to be), but he just did not pull it off.  There was some controversy about Eddie Murphy not winning an Oscar for his portrayl of James ""Thunder"" Early, but after viewing this movie, I can understand why he didn't win.  If you are nominated for an Oscar in a supporting category, then you HAVE to do something memorable in your role.  I'm sorry but to me all he was doing was an overblown rendition of his James Brown schtick from Saturday Night Live.  It just wasn't enough.The movie is directed by Bill Condon, who I believe wrote the screenplay for ""Chicago.""  He needs to stick to writing.  The movie's pacing and shooting were done haphazardly; little or no continuity.  The staging of some of the songs were downright boring.

1061791,A30J7WQV0ZNRXG,B000O174CM,"D. Reinstein ""marindavid""","[4, 7]","Historically, many of the films called 'musicals' suffer from one of two basic tragic flaws. They tend to either miss the boat on either 1) good dramatic satisfaction - emphasizing the score and lyrics that make use of a flimsy 'story line' to create a venue for the songs to be performed, or 2) mundane, unmemorable music overlaying a really solid dramatic story. The most famous classical American Broadway shows of the 40's and 50's are some prime examples of the first situation (Guys and Dolls, Oklahoma, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, The King and I, etc.) and - understanding that many will disagree with me - Les Miserables (Les Miz) is a great example of the second. It is, in my experience, unusual to find a musical that delivers both solid drama where the music is a part of the developing story itself - not just a musically scored way of telling the story. In the new film of Dreamgirls I found myself experiencing what I always hoped a great musical could be. I haven't felt myself so genuinely engaged in and emotionally involved with a musical since the live Broadway revival of ""Showboat"" - another important exception to the two basic flaws mentioned above. There have been, of course, other musicals that I found both dramatically satisfying and musically inspired (West Side Story is another that comes to mind), but they have been few and far between.In fact, it was a half-hour or so into the movie before any dramatic lines were sung - before that, the music was the music - performed as performances. The film transitioned itself, nearly seamlessly, from then on, into a musical drama. The music - either as stage-performance numbers or as dramatically delivered musical dialog is absolutely riveting! I expect the CD will sell quite well.I had seen a live stage production of this show in San Francisco nearly 20 years ago and, frankly, I found this film a lot more satisfying! I don't believe I have ever had cause to say that about a stage-to-screen transition before. I'm glad to be able to say it about Dreamgirls.Based. more-or-less, on the story of the Supremes, Dreamgirls , with Bill Condon's screen play and absolutely superlative performances by Eddie Murphy as the R&B; superstar blend of maybe James Brown, Little Richard and others of that performance type and Beyonce as Deena Jones (the Dianna Ross type character/performer), Jennifer Hudson as the REAL musical talent who is replaced because she doesn't look right (too heavy) and is too 'black' and dramatically emphatic in her singing style to appeal to the broader audience - at least according to the character played with restraint and believability bt Jamie Fox as the producer, Curtis Taylor. Danny Glover also adds his own brand of reality to the story - and, thank goodness, he does not sing. IN many older musicals, film stars 'sang' - terribly. (Give a listen to Marlon Brando 'singing' in Guys and Dolls, for example.) This is yet another example of the good judgments that reflect beautifully in nearly each and every scene of this film.As other reviewers have or will probably note, the audience actually applauded when the film ended - to no one! Kind of odd - except if understood as an expression of appreciation to everyone - and yet, to no one on particular for providing a wonderful couple of hours in a theater.The story is set during one of the most compelling change-eras in American history - when just about everything seemed to be in a state of flux and change at the same time. The tension and excitement of that era is successfully captured - often without having to be directly alluded to in the film. Ah.... even some subtlety - again, an infrequent quality in 'musicals.'In my opinion, the very best of a genre that had nearly destroyed itself over time.

Siegfried,"[1, 2]","I think that most people are familiar with the story even before seeing the movie - about a singing group similar to the Supremes, with enough fiction to keep the writers and producers from getting sued by Diana Ross or Berry Gordy.  Also, Jennifer Hudson's loss on American Idol and subsequent Oscar got tons of press.The movie lives up to most (although not all) of its publicity. There are one or two scenes that run a little long, most notably, the scene where Effie finds out that she is being cut. My wife thought that the singing was too shrill, but I don't agree - but the scene is VERY intense and gets a little unpleasant to watch because Effie's pain is that intense and that raw.  And Jennifer Hudson is THAT good.The truth is that it's a very good story, carried out by a cast that is extraordinarily talented.  Eddie Murphy hasn't been this good in years (except for the Shrek movies) and he shows why he was able to sell so many years ago.

1061793,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000O174CM,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","Like many others, I vividly recall how Jennifer Holliday sent shivers down my neck when she ripped through her defiant anthem, ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"", in the original Broadway production nearly a quarter century ago. It is the kind of transcendent moment in the theater that had exponentially raised my anticipation of the much-delayed 2006 screen adaptation. The great news is that director/screenwriter Bill Condon has pulled together a top-notch entertainment piece full of ceaseless energy and eye-filling dazzle. Even if the narrative deficiencies of Tom Eyen's original musical have not been resolved here, Condon compensates by bringing more historical context to the story and making even more pointed references to the characters' real-life counterparts. More importantly, he recognizes that the episodic human drama really takes a back seat to the early Motown-to-disco musical pastiche brought forth by Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Eyen's constantly engaging lyrics.The time-spanning plot focuses on a girl group in Detroit, three childhood friends - vocal powerhouse Effie backed up by good-girl Deena and chatty Lorrell - who are together known as the Dreamettes. Showing promise but failing to win a local amateur contest, they are corralled by smooth-talking Cadillac huckster Curtis Taylor to sing back-up for local R&B; star James Thunder Early. They become a hit on the chitlin' circuit, but Taylor wants broader fame. Along with Effie's ambitious, soft-spoken songwriting brother C.C., Taylor launches a new label, Rainbow Records, right out of his car dealership. They record a song that starts to move on the charts but not before it is lifted by a white group in an antiseptic cover version. Taylor turns to payola to ensure Early and the Dreamettes achieve pop success on their own. He also tries to tone down Early for white audiences and makeover the girls into the Dreams. The latter strategy means pushing Effie into the background and Deena upfront, a move that causes friction and resentment in spite of the group's burgeoning success. Eventually, Effie's diva behavior gets her kicked out of the Dreams, and Early's star fades into addiction and irrelevance. Meanwhile, Taylor has built a media empire with plans to make Deena a movie star. His Svengali-level of control reaches a breaking point when he takes back a song C.C. wrote for Effie's resuscitating solo career in order to make it a disco hit for the Dreams.It's most fortunate that casting is exemplary here because that could have easily been the film's downfall. Even though it is an ensemble piece, the lion's share of the press has been going to Jennifer Hudson's blazing debut performance as Effie. Standing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, but with her zaftig figure and huge voice, Hudson effortlessly captures the character's sassy self-confidence and eventual emotional deconstruction. Musically, she clearly has the vocal chops and technique to nail all of Effie's numbers, especially ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"", the film's crowning moment. As Early, Eddie Murphy finally has a role that takes advantage of his gift for mimicry (this time an amalgam of Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson and James Brown - who sadly just died this morning), adds darker colors and textures to his established screen persona and dares him to try singing again. The result is nothing short of a revelation.As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles manages to hold her own, even though her character has not been sharpened into a stronger personality. A stunning woman by anyone's measure, she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky singing style, while lending a naturalistic quality to her portrayal. She has one shining musical moment, a new song called ""Listen"", though ironically, her powerful vocal delivery seems at odds with Deena's supposedly limited talents. With the unenviable task of playing Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like figure of Machiavellian villainy, Jaime Foxx begins solid even as the character becomes more cardboard as the story progresses. With a beautifully soulful voice of her own, Anika Noni Rose shines as Lorrell moving fluidly from ditzy back-up singer to resigned mistress. Keith Robinson also displays a fine voice and brings gravitas to his subtle performance as C.C, while Danny Glover provides his welcome seasoned presence as Early's manager, Marty.There are several moments that are plain wonderful. One in particular is when Early starts to rehearse the Dreamettes on ""Fake Your Way to the Top"", and as he gyrates, it turns into the actual stage show. Another is the near-operatic histrionics on ""It's All Over"" when most of the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. I like some of the movie's more overt send-ups like Early wearing Marvin Gaye's knit cap as he sings his civil rights-themed ballad, ""Patience"", or when Deena comes floating down the theater aisles blowing air kisses just like Diana Ross at the Motown reunion concert. All the production values are first-class from Tobias A. Schliessler's dazzling, color-saturated cinematography to Sharen Davis' va-va-voom costumes to Virginia Katz's kinetic film editing to John Myhre's evocative production design which includes recreations of the 1967 Detroit riots. Despite a smattering of weakly contrived dramatic moments in the second half, this is knockout entertainment for anyone who enjoys the musical genre.",5,Dazzling Broadway Hit Becomes Top-Notch

Mostly I wanted to see it because it had won an Oscar, or should I say Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. What a performance!  To think she came from American Idol(and not the winner) and is such an amazing performer and actress.  The movie seemed like the perfect vehicle for her rev up her movie career.""Dreamgirls"" reminded me a bit of the story of The Supremes.  It is the 50's when it starts.  Three back up singers for Eddie Murphy's Jimmy ""Thunder"" Early, dance and sing their way up to the front of the stage.  Eventually they have their own girl group, The Dreams.  Curtis Taylor, Jr. played by Jamie Foxx, is the manager of the group.Beyonce Knowles plays the main singer, Deena Jones, who gets all the attention that I felt Effie White, Jennifer Hudson's character, deserved.  I felt she got the shaft because she wasn't the imagine that they wanted for the group.  She was the most talented.  She knows it too, and eventually takes a bad turn away from the group.""Dreamgirls"" was a musical/play before it was a film and it transitioned well to onto the big screen.

I knew nothing about this film until four years or so after it was produced.  When I did get a look at it, I was bowled over by the story and how it was executed.  At the core, it's a paraphrasal of the story of Diana Ross during the all-powerful pop reign of the Supremes.  Beyance Knowles delivers an unswerving portrayal of Deena Jones (based directly upon Diana Ross), as she's thrust into the spotlight by a domineering boss, Curtis Taylor Jr. (portrayed by Jamie Foxx and based on Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr.), then breaks out on her own while coming to the aide of her lead-singing predecessor, Effie White (delivered by Jennifer Hudson and based on Etta James, Aretha Franklin and the Supremes' Florence Ballard).  The presentation is incredibly believaable and hard to tear away from, once you're there.There is one historical reference not noted by other viewers and reviewers, but one I noticed almost from the first time I watched this film.  Towards the end of this picture, the Curtis Taylor character begins to hover over the Deena character appears to be a paraphrasal of the relationship between Ike and Tina Turner.  Despite being devoid of actual physical altercations, that doesn't stop Curtis from ruling Deena's life with a proverbial iron fist.  She records every record he wants her to, and he forces her to star in a film about Cleopatra, even though she wants to appear in a different film.  Then when she leaves him, Deena makes references to letting him have everything she's got, as long as she can start over.  That's precisely what happened with Miss Turner.Edit 1-11-11: One of the conclusions I came to after I first watched this movie is that both its production and its popularity are an indication of the very thing I've been trying to convey to people since I myself began learning to play music in 1994.  The American music industry (especially rock music) is ripe for a reversion to the standards of quality and virtuosity from which the music of this film and its story sprang.  Industry insiders need to be searching for artists and performers harkening back to the popular music of the 60's, 70's and 80's, as opposed to the 90's and afterword.",5,Brillient Paraphrasal of Classic R&B History,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2286,"['Instead', 'going', 'synopsis', ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'few', 'remarks', 'knew', 'nothing', 'film', 'four', 'years', 'so', 'was', 'produced', 'When', 'did', 'get', 'look', 'was', 'bowled', 'over', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'executed', 'core', 'paraphrasal', 'story', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'all-powerful', 'pop', 'reign', 'Supremes', 'Beyance', 'Knowles', 'unswerving', 'portrayal', 'Deena', 'Jones', 'based', 'directly', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'domineering', 'boss', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'Jr.', 'portrayed', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'based', 'Motown', 'founder', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'Jr.', 'then', 'out', 'own', 'while', 'coming', 'aide', 'lead-singing', 'predecessor', 'Effie', 'White', 'delivered', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'based', 'Etta', 'James', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'Supremes', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'presentation', 'incredibly', 'believaable', 'hard', 'tear', 'away', 'once', ""'re"", 'one', 'historical', 'reference', 'not', 'noted', 'other', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'one', 'noticed', 'almost', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'end', 'picture', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'character', 'hover', 'Deena', 'character', 'be', 'paraphrasal', 'relationship', 'Ike', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'being', 'devoid', 'actual', 'physical', 'altercations', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Curtis', 'ruling', 'Deena', 'life', 'proverbial', 'iron', 'fist', 'record', 'star', 'film', 'Cleopatra', 'even', 'appear', 'different', 'film', 'Then', 'when', 'Deena', 'references', 'letting', 'have', 'everything', 'got', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'start', 'precisely', 'what', 'happened', 'Miss', 'Turner.Edit', '1-11-11', 'One', 'conclusions', 'came', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'production', 'popularity', 'are', 'indication', 'very', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'convey', 'people', 'began', 'learning', 'play', 'music', '1994', 'American', 'music', 'industry', 'especially', 'rock', 'music', 'ripe', 'reversion', 'standards', 'quality', 'virtuosity', 'music', 'film', 'story', 'sprang', 'Industry', 'insiders', 'need', 'be', 'searching', 'artists', 'performers', 'harkening', 'back', 'popular', 'music', '60', '70', '80', 'opposed', '90', 'afterword']",N/A

Three young women - Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles),  Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) - desire to become pop stars and get their wish when they're picked to be backup singers for the legendary James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy). Then they're set free for leads, but Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) and Effie's brother C.C. (Keith Robinson) decide for Deena to be lead which upsets Effie. Spanning the rock `n' roll sounds of the late `50's, pop sounds of the 1960's, and the disco spin of the 1970's- ""Dreamgirls"" is a mix of a rock `n' show, a Broadway musical (they sing a lot of their dialogue), and an urban city drama- rarely do we see any Caucasian actors unless they're being portrayed as ""the bad guy"" (example: the ""white"" audience at the Vegas night club).  ""Dreamgirls"" is entertaining in the story which could just as well be called ""Diana Ross and the Supremes- Road to Motown,"" in it's similarities- check out the scene with the `70's group that is a carbon copy of ""The Jackson 5"" with the little boy singing and dancing like Michael!I enjoyed the movie, however, the soundtrack is lacking any ""stand out"" songs, that we haven't heard before.  Jennifer gives a powerful performance singing ""And I Tell You I'm Not Going"" which brings to mind an early Aretha Franklin.  The other songs are pretty much forgettable and the  only song that has some real stage performance presence, is ""Only One Night""- which goes from a soulful ballad to a disco dance hit.  Jennifer and Beyonce both do a great job singing this one.  The entire cast does a great job bringing ""Dreamgirls"" from the stage to the screen and took home several coveted awards for their efforts.2-disc version is the way to go if you REALLY loved the movie or 1-disc version if you only enjoyed it somewhat.I purchased the 2-disc version mainly to add it to my DVD library of musicals- and it was on a really good sale! Kudos to Jennifer Hudson's award winning performance and to Beyonce Knowles for her stellar performance as Deena (another name for Diana Ross- the Diana likeness really shows in the numerous photo sessions) and Jamie Foxx's ""grab-for-power Quincey Jones"" role as Curtis Taylor Jr is also notable. Jennifer Hudson's award winning performance is a knock-out! It's just too bad there's a short supply of attractive leading men (except for Keith Robinson) for these beautiful ladies to co-star with- Jamie Foxx (Ugg!), Eddie Murphy (Ugg!)- but then again the movie is called ""Dreamgirls,"" not ""Dreamboys,"" and it shows!",4,"""DREAMGIRLS"" A.K.A.

1061802,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000O174CM,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 and was in the running for a film version long, long before it closed in 1985.  Very loosely based on the lives and career of The Supremes, it told the story of a black girl group whose cross-over from ""race records"" to the pop charts fuel the success of an increasingly cut-throat recording mogul--and find the price of fame and fortune in the recording industry too high for their liking.While it borrows a great deal from numerous music personalities and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, DREAMGIRLS is essentially a riff on the career of The Supremes and the group's relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy.The Supremes were originally created by Florence Ballard, a powerhouse vocalist who worked with Diana Ross and Mary Wilson as back up singers.  Berry sought a group that could cross over into the pop charts and reformulated the line-up, moving the prettier Diana Ross to lead--and ultimately dismissing Ballard from the group entirely, replacing her with Cindy Birdsong.  After the music industry turned its back on Ballard, she declined in alcoholism and poverty and died at age 32.  She is widely regarded as one of the great tragic figures on the long list of American rock and roll casualties.When DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 critics praised its powerhouse performances and its dazzling staging--but were somewhat less favorable toward its script and score, noting that the characters were one-note and with one or two exceptions that the score was neither memorable nor able to capture the sharply crafted pop hooks of the Motown style it tried to mimic.  Even so, the play ran five years, and over the years numerous studios, producers, directors, and stars have took a crack at bringing it to the screen--something that didn't happen until 2006.  And once more critics praised its powerhouse performances and dazzling staging--and were considerably less enthusiastic about its script and score.The great flaw in DREAMGIRLS is that, while it centers on the story of Florence Ballard, neither the stage nor screen version actually has the nerve to play it out: it, the rivalry between Ballard and Ross, and the brutalities of the music business are actually somewhat underplayed in an effort to place every character in a softer light.  As for the music, the score does include the stunning ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" but the original criticism stands: although pleasant enough, the songs are not particularly memorable and they do indeed lack the sharp, slick edges of the Motown sound that inspired them.Like many another period film, the look is not really accurate: instead of accurately depicting the 1960s and 1970s it is that era as seen through a modern filter, the 1960s and 1970s as we tend to recall them rather than as they actually were.  Even so, there is plenty of visual splash; the costumes, the concert stagings, and the overall art design is quite fine, and you never actually question accuracy while it unfolds before.  And then there are the performances.With the exception Jamie Foxx, who seems slightly miscast in the role of music manager and producer Curtis Taylor, DREAMGIRLS is filled with memorable performances.  Although she does not imitate Diana Ross per se, Beyonce Knowles captures Ross' look and sense of style remarkably well;  Danny Glover offers a memorable turn as agent Marty Madison; and overall the supporting cast is quite fine.  But the big noises her are Eddie Murphy as James Early, a role based on several singers of the era but most particularly on James Brown, and Jennifer Hudson as Effy White, the role based on Florence Ballard.Murphy's film career has been very up and down over the years, ranging from the popular 48 HOURS to the diastrous HARLEM NIGHTS, and he is at present best known for such mild comedies as DR. DOOLITTLE and NORBIT.  He typically plays himself--but DREAMGIRLS puts him on the acting map in a serious way.  Not only does he does he offer an extraordinary bit of work as the flamboyant but self-destructive R&B; singer, he tears strips off his musical numbers.  Prior to her appearance in DREAMGIRLS, Jennifer Hudson was best know as an also-ran on television's American Idol, which entirely failed to anticipate the depths of her vocal talents and acting skill.  DREAMGIRLS, however, exploited what television missed--and while it is technically a supporting role, Hudson's Effie White is the glue that holds the whole thing together.  It is easily the most remarkable screen debut since Barbra Striesand's 1968 FUNNY GIRL.DREAMGIRLS is not a ""perfect"" film, much less a ""great"" musical.  As previously noted, the script is a bit weak and the music slightly below expectations, and when all is said and done it's a bit too glossy for its own good.  But it is easy on the eyes, the cast is solid, and you'll never be less than amazed by Murphy and Hudson.  The one-disk DVD offers extended scenes but little else; if you are a hardcore fan you'll no doubt want to go with the double disk special edition.

I thought Beyonce was trying a little to hard to ""NOT"" be seen as Beyonce and Eddie Murphy was just plain silly.  I never really cared for J Foxx but I did love his performance in Ray, just not this movie.  J Hudson was superb as ""Effie"".  I was plesantly surprised by her overall performance. Anika Noni rose who played one of the dreamgirls has been so unfairly underrated, you would almost forget she was in the movie had you not seen it.  She was great!I usually enjoy musicals, especially anything to do with Motown, because I grew up listening to the likes of James Brown, Aretha, Temptations, everyday from my parents to my aunts and uncles.  It was everywhere.  That being said, I really enjoyed J Hudson's performance in this movie. I was a little worried when I heard her sing the song on the radio, because I actually did not like it at first, but when I saw the movie it changed everything.  Many people are trying to compare her version to J Holiday (the original singer of the song) ""and i am telling you"" but you can't compare the two at all.  There is absolutely no comparison.  Two totally different performances.  Before I wrote this review, I watched J Holiday sing it on stage at Youtube, and I must say she was amazing!! Its very rare that I tear up listening to songs but that performance was tearfully painful!!!!! Incredible!!  however, so was J Hudson's performance but in a different way!

Having grown up listening to the original voices (Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Loretta Devine -- who makes a guest appearance in this 2006 movie), it was a leap for me to appreciate the update without bias. With each song, I wanted to experience the original, to see actresses who weren't self-aware in an industry that hadn't yet bought into its own hype. Still, the movie has its merits. The story leaves a lot out as concerns racism, industry, and artist struggle during the 1960s and 70s. We also missed out on character enrichment to, for example, explain why Effie needed so many people to love her. No need for psychoanalysis, but something to make her not look like a desperate, raging egomanic and set us up for the show's #1 song &#34;And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.&#34; Visually, the film was fun! Eddie Murphy is fantastic with major kudos for Jennifer Hudson and Keith Robinson. We've seen better from Jamie Foxx, although it was different to see him in this villainous role.

1061811,AOSIEAVE18JCA,B000O174CM,Hoyt Harris,"[12, 40]","DREAMGIRLS has individual parts and pieces that, when film production was announced, sounded delicious, like a surefire winner. But the parts, as good as they are, do not gel into the knockout whole that this movie could have been. Writer Bill Condon (CHICAGO), who also directed DREAMGIRLS, perhaps was spread too thin to pull this one off.The legendary Broadway musical of 1981 was directed by the late Michael Bennett (the stage version of A CHORUS LINE) who was lauded for his ""cinematic"" staging of the original. He managed, with pivoting onstage towers and with lighting, to achieve before the eyes of a live audience what amounted to the stage version of cinematic wipes, dissolves, cross-cutting, and fades. His vision made for thrilling stage work, as he had done in A CHORUS LINE.Twenty-five years after the original Broadway show, DREAMGIRLS seemed like a guaranteed screen hit. With CHICAGO, Condon had already shown in his adaptation that Broadway musicals still had legs for the medium of film.Not only would the movie version of DREAMGIRLS feature mega-star Beyonce Knowles, Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx, veteran film star Eddie Murphy and ""American Idol"" reject Jennifer Hudson (""everybody loves to root for an underdog"", etc.); DREAMGIRLS would be shepherded to the screen by DREAMWORKS and David Geffen.But despite what sounds like a 24-carat pedigree, the movie simply falls short of expectations. The script talks about how white performers in the 50's and 60's repackaged black performers' songs and style. But the execution of this point is weak. (Was Hollywood afraid to alienate the white audience it needed to make the film version a bona fide box office hit?) Montages of archival footage of the Civil Rights era are on screen, but they seem to exist in another world from the action of the main storyline.Despite her Golden Globe win as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy or Musical, Jennifer Hudson is a weak substitute for the great Jennifer Holiday, who originated the role of Effie White. We want Hudson to be good. But she simply does not have the voice that Holiday used to burrow Effie's rejection and pain into the very bone marrow of those privileged to see her perform the role onstage. Holiday's live version of Effie's powerful lament, ""And I am Telling You I'm Not Going,"" is one of the most powerful performances that will ever close a first act--or any act--on the stage or screen. Whereas Holiday's version contains in every breath soul-ravaging pain, Hudson, on certain notes, goes nasal, thin and strained.Let's face it: this song was the jewel in the original stage musical--the first-act closing number that threatened to blow the theater apart. (DREAMGIRLS' music was never one of the great Broadway scores. The show's success was largely due to its staging technique.) Without a knock-out rendition of that climactic song here, the movie sags--and suffers. Hudson's version gets something of a boost through the showcasing delivered by cinematography and editing. But Holiday in her live, three dimensions, didn't need any help. She knocked the song out of the theater night after night--just her, the orchestra and that once-in-a-lifetime voice. If for no other reason than to capture Holiday's performance on film, DREAMGIRLS should have been filmed twenty years before it was. If they had to use a ""loser"" from ""American Idol"", too bad they couldn't wait for Mandisa from the 2006 season. That girl can sing.All the Eddie Murphys and Beyonces in the world cannot make up for this fact. Because DREAMGIRLS was always really ""about"" Effie and what happens to her, Jennifer Hudson in this pivotal role is like a fifth or sixth carbon copy of the original--similar, but weak, pale.Those unfamiliar with Jennifer Holiday might find Hudson more than adequate. But if anyone wants to see--and to hear--""Effie White"", simply go to youtube, type in ""Jennifer Holiday"" and watch the clip of her performance from the 1982 Tony Awards show. If her performance, even on a small computer screen, with less than perfect audio, with video glitches and all, doesn't shake you to your very core and leave you knowing you've seen greatness, then call the undertaker, because you are probably dead.On balance, the performers in the film do  passably adequate jobs with their roles. The problem is that DREAMGIRLS, while ""about"" Effie White, has so many characters and so many ""stars""--each of whom it appears was contractually promised to get their ""big moment""--that the movie comes off choppy, not unlike a mass ""American Idol"" audition. Just as we're trying to learn about this character or that plot line, we're whooshed off to the next star's ""big number."" The movie, in essence, lacks cohesive flow.Condon's DREAMGIRLS is an admirable attempt at turning a legendary stage musical into screen gold. Perhaps the movie could never have been made without the wattage of today's established black stars. But the treatment given to these stars--in the form of new songs written for the screen--dilutes the ""punch"", the through-line of the original. This version--while the best you're going to get of this legendary show--is something ""other"" than what, in 1981, had audiences swept up in the backstage story of a girl group and the bumpy road they traveled to pop stardom.The best acting job is turned in by Eddie Murphy, whose James ""Thunder"" Early seems an hommage to Wilson Pickett, Little Richard, et al. Murphy shows a level of depth here we haven't seen before. While some might not ""get"" the comic mixed with the tragic within his performance, anyone familiar with show business knows that the onstage persona performers project can be diametrically opposed to the character's real self once the concerts end and real life resumes.Hudson, in her first film, brought marquee power via the fans she garnered before she was booted from ""American Idol."" Her acting is as good as most everyone else in the cast. (Actually, who can really tell? The dialogue scenes are so miniscule.) But--and this is a big ""but""--if she had the vocal chops of a Jennifer Holiday--which is perhaps asking for more than Heaven would ever allow--Hudson could have made as auspicious a debut as Barbra Streisand did in FUNNY GIRL. That, however, did not happen. If David O. Selznick in 1939 could scour the planet before finding British actress Vivien Leigh to play Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND, why couldn't DREAMWORKS have done the same in search of the perfect Effie, instead of taking the easy way out and grabbing an ""American Idol"" cast-off? This was nothing more than a cynical move to grab the built-in television audience that follows the hugely popular show. Smart? Yes. But cynical nonetheless. If Broadway could find a Jennifer Holiday in 1981, Hollywood could surely have found an unknown--with acting skills AND vocal strength--a quarter-century later. Shame on the moviemakers for skipping out on a golden opportunity that will never come again. The movie is made. The Oscars will be won. But DREAMGIRLS is not the movie musical it coulda, woulda--but most importantly--shoulda been.Hoyt Harris, KATC TV3 Lafayette",2,And I am telling you this movie doesn't go anywhere close to where it

The one unbelievable appearance is that of Jennifer Hudson.  How can a first movie and acting performance be considered, in my opinion, for a best supporting actor award?  The other surprise was Eddie Murphy.  The theater audience burst out in laughter when he appeared on screen.  In expectation of a joking and laughing Murphy this allusion was soon put on the back burner.  Eddie Murphy showed a new side.  His singing, dancing and earthy demeanor will shock you.  This is Eddie Murphy, with an amazing posture as a struggling singer. Moving on, the weaving in and out of music and plot is done with perfection.Now back to Jennifer Hudson.  When she is on camera you receive the vibes of the person who is the true ""Diva"" of this movie.  What a performance and voice.  When she sang ""And I am Telling You I'm Not Going"" the movie audience applauded.  If she is not nominated for an Oscar, Hollywood has missed an opportunity to give a just reward.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","I deliberately waited until all the hype was done; all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to view ""Dreamgirls."" It is indeed an excellent presentation.This film is a roman &agrave; clef about the onset and heyday of Motown and in particular one of the most popular R&B; groups, The Supremes. We witness their ascent to fame, the divisions between the manager's wants and public tastes and their struggle to remain in vogue in a changing world of popular music.Director of Chicago, another fantastic musical, wheels in a star cast fully showcasing the razzle-dazzle and enchantment of the songs and glittery costumes and wigs by bringing in ""Dreamgirls"" to the screen. This excellent Broadway production of the 80s put Jennifer Holiday on the map. Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, ""Dreamgirls"" is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture.After watching this I didn't think it was much of a musical so I don't feel its right to compare this to `Chicago' excluding one major scene on stage. I thought all performances were equally fascinating. It's a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life. Jamie Foxx gave an understated performance which I found believable. Eddie Murphy also gave a great performance whose impact and appreciation may have been lost due to Eddie's past comedic roles where he basically did the same kind of voice and facial expressions he used here for the Character of Jimmy and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs. I felt this was a strong performance by Eddie especially the scenes where he didn't say a word and his face said it all. It would have been nice to see him win the Academy Award. But there is no denying that Jennifer Hudson overshadows all these Hollywood heavies in this movie with her knockout performance as Effie White. She owns every scene she is in. The part given more meaning for those of us who saw her through the ""Idol"" drama where she was accused of not having the ""Depth"" to compete. Well, after I first heard her sing on Idol I too believed she did not belong there....She belonged in a higher place....her voice was a force of nature. Her talent was bigger than IDOL. The dream has really come true for this dreamgirl and I certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theaters and friends of mine who went to see it in theaters I attest to that.",4,Great adaptation but it's no Chicago,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2510,"['deliberately', 'waited', 'hype', 'was', 'done', 'awards', 'were', 'won', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'tired', 'Beyonce', 'view', 'Dreamgirls', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'presentation.This', 'film', 'roman', 'agrave', 'clef', 'onset', 'heyday', 'Motown', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'R', 'B', 'groups', 'Supremes', 'witness', 'ascent', 'fame', 'divisions', 'manager', 'public', 'tastes', 'struggle', 'remain', 'vogue', 'changing', 'world', 'popular', 'music.Director', 'Chicago', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'wheels', 'star', 'cast', 'fully', 'showcasing', 'razzle-dazzle', 'enchantment', 'songs', 'glittery', 'costumes', 'wigs', 'bringing', 'Dreamgirls', 'screen', 'excellent', 'Broadway', 'production', '80s', 'put', 'Jennifer', 'Holiday', 'map', 'Apart', 'top-notch', 'production', 'standards', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'fantastic', 'music', 'excellent', 'performances', 'around', 'Dreamgirls', 'indeed', 'wonderful', 'presentation', 'slice', 'African-American', 'life/culture.After', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'musical', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'compare', 'Chicago', 'excluding', 'one', 'major', 'scene', 'stage', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'equally', 'fascinating', 'shame', 'Florence', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Effie', 'did', 'such', 'life', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'gave', 'understated', 'performance', 'found', 'believable', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'also', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'impact', 'appreciation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'due', 'Eddie', 'past', 'comedic', 'roles', 'where', 'basically', 'did', 'same', 'kind', 'voice', 'facial', 'expressions', 'used', 'here', 'Character', 'Jimmy', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'got', 'chance', 'sing', 'few', 'songs', 'felt', 'was', 'strong', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'face', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'denying', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Hollywood', 'heavies', 'movie', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Effie', 'White', 'scene', 'part', 'given', 'more', 'meaning', 'who', 'saw', 'Idol', 'drama', 'where', 'was', 'accused', 'not', 'having', 'Depth', 'compete', 'Well', 'first', 'heard', 'sing', 'Idol', 'too', 'believed', 'did', 'not', 'belong', 'there', '.She', 'belonged', 'higher', 'place', 'voice', 'was', 'force', 'nature', 'talent', 'was', 'bigger', 'IDOL', 'dream', 'really', 'come', 'true', 'dreamgirl', 'certainly', 'understand', 'standing', 'ovations', 'got', 'theaters', 'friends', 'mine', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'theaters', 'attest']",N/A

""Dreamgirls"" is a musical turned movie that tells the story about how black music reached mainsteam popularity in the 60's Motown, and it also reveals some not so pleasant ""truths"" about lies, betrayal, jealousy empty promises and theft in the music industry. The plot follows a promising girl group of the early 60's called The Dreamettes with Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) and their exposure to struggling and ambitious record producer Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx) who'll do absolutely anything to promote them (including bribing Dj's and later song theft) and create a sound that will break them into mainstream radio. First they became backround singers for a decent R&B; star James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy), but eventually they'll go solo and Curtis starts his won record company where Effie's brother CC becomes the first songwriter. Curtis is first romantically involved with Effie, who's a fantastic singer and the group's leadsinger initially too. When they go solo he turns his back on Effie for Deena who's isn't as good singer but she's absolutely gorgeous and is a better choise for lead then Effie who's is both big and not so pretty. Effie get's depressed after getting demoted to backround singer and after a outburst she's fired from the band and replaced by Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal). Effie becomes an alcoholic and she's also becomes pregnant with Curtis. Instead of being the star she should, she's living on welfare far away from the glamour of the Dreamettes now The Dreams, that eventually became one of the most popular groups on earth and she's abandonded by everybody including her own Brother. Deena Marries Curtis but thinks his manipulative and control based persona is getting too much of a hold on her and the groups music which sound more like Disco at the end. The same thing happens with Jimmy who's forced to sing the Pop-friendly music that Curtis wants him to sing. After alot of diffrent scenarios and happenings, Deena and other will have to chose which way they want to go, Curtis or their own and there will be plenty of surprises.All of the charachters in ""Dreamgirls"" are loosly based on real personalities, Dreams are the Supremes and Deena Jones is Diana Ross while Effie is the unsung star Florence Ballard who was kicked out of Supremes. Curtis is undoubtly Motown founder Berry Gordy and Eddie Murphy is a hybrid of diffrent charaters like Jackie Wilson, James Brown and Marvin Gaye. Even if they don't use the real names nor the real songs in most occasions, it's evident what they wanted to show.""Dreamgirls"" reveals the brutal truth of the musical industry but it also shows alot of Music history from the 60's when Motown and others helped black music reaching a mainstream audience. This is a musical and there is ALOT of singing, sometimes even too much. However, there are some fantastic performances from Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles and especially Jennifer Hudson who's an extra-ordinary singer! and actress aswell, hence she won an Oscar in her debut role!. The film starts slow, but grows on you and eventually it becames a very rewarding experience. Sometimes there will be singing instead of acting and it becomes evident that this is a broadway show turning movie. However, if you love good music from the 60's, great singers and a fascinating plot that is partly based on real stories, This is a film for you!. Bottom line. Don't give up the dream of archiving what you want in life, just look at Jennifer Hudson. Rejected at American Idol and now a Academy Award winning actress with an upcoming solo album.

SOUTH,"[9, 21]","Since I never saw the Broadway show that this film is based on, I have no idea if the things I disliked so much about it are from its restructuring as a movie, or from the original stage version.  But here are the reasons I thought it was a mess:1. It was extremely jarring, more than a half-hour into the film, to see characters suddenly burst to song within their real-life situations, as opposed to just in performance. The concept should have started out either as a standard musical, where people sing in character as well as performers, OR they should have done the modern take, where the musical numbers are confined to stage and studio.2. This blah-blah-blah about it is The Supremes, but it's not The Supremes, is nonsense.  It obviously IS intended to be about the real group, but some of their facts are wrong, to the point of being downright nasty toward Diana Ross. If you listen to their early recordings, it is only Diana's voice that stands out uniquely, and that talent, ALONG with her looks, personality, and style propelled her to the front. There was no other gift to the extent of ""Effie's"" among the other Supremes. To insinuate that ""Deena Jones"" rode to stardom solely as a ""product"" based on her looks is truly a fantasy.3. Beyonce Knowles is terrible!4. Yes, Jennifer Hudson is good, but her character is dreadfully one-dimensional, annoying, and over-written. Isn't the script called ""Dreamgirls""?  It could have been a take-off on ""Funny Girl"": call it ""Effie Girl"".  Way too much screen time devoted to her storyline made the focus lop-sided.5. In yet another inconsistancy, more than three-quarters into the film, James Thunder Early (Eddie Murphy) gets a song rejected and instantly becomes a drug addict, dying from an overdose within the next few minutes!  There was absolutely no build-up to this, but that's kind of OK with me, since Murphy's character was also already blown-up beyond the subject of the movie.  Speaking of no bulid-up, who was the woman who instantly popped up to sing at Thunder's wake?6. The songs are awful, nothing but hook-lines. I ask people who love the music from this show to sing even ONE song half-way thru, but all they can remember are the chorus tags: ""We're your dreamgirls!""...""One night only!""...""And I'm telling you I'm not going!""...""I've got a Cadillac!""  No melody lines or meaningful lyrics beyond that.I'm now going to go enjoy my Diana Ross and The Supremes box set.

1061832,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000O174CM,Kevin Killian,"[3, 7]","Some great performances animate a beautifully directed musical.  Jamie Foxx perhaps wasn't up to the part, but the part was itself underwritten, to the point that Curtis has to play evil personified, more and more controlling, like James Mason in CAUGHT, and his gradual ownership of Deena is presented with the looming shadows Gregg Toland gave to Orson Welles in CITIZEN KANE.  It's a one dimensional role; at first we get an idea that Curtis is an activist with Marxist ideas on liberating black music by seizing the means of production (""We're black owned,"" he shouts out to rioting Detroit troublemakers, who veer away, appeased), but we later find out he doesn't really care about ""blackness"" per se, only his own vision of blackness as something that sells to white people.  At first his redeeming virtue seems to be his love for Deena, later we find out the real reason he focussed on her--a crass one to be sure.  Foxx didn't really have much to play with here, and his only great moments are being the straight man for Jennifer Hudson in her big show stopper (for it's harder to react to every impassioned cry another makes than to be the one acting) and his discovery, at the final curtain, of the real parentage of Magic.  His attraction to Effie at the beginning is never dramatized; we don't know if he loves her, or only enjoys her company sexually, or was it just part of his Machiavellian master plan?  This is a case where we will have to wait for the DVD commentary to let us know what Foxx himself was thinking when making all those smirky faces.In contrast Eddie Murphy just runs away with the whole show.  He plays the part with echoes of his own impersonation of James Brown, and watching James Early collapse on stage, fanned back to life by the Dreamettes, was painfully eerie in the days that followed that real-life death of Brown; but there are more and more Marvin Gaye shadings thrown into the mix, right down to that colorful knitted workingman's cap he wears when CC writes him a ""political"" number called ""Patience"" (which isn't up to the level of a real Marvin Gaye tune, but it's different enough from the rest of CC's glitz to stand out.  Beyonce is also convincing, except when aging, for you never feel that somehow she's too old to play Cleopatra the way Curtis wants her to.  Loved seeing John Lithgow playing some sort of insider Hollywood Joel Schumacher director, with the fellow from TV's THE OFFICE as his screenwriter boy-toy.But most of all the picture gets handed over to Jennifer Hudson, as the hard luck kid Effie White.  Condon coaches Hudson to a pretty amazing dramatic turn, it's hard to believe she hasn't always been an actress, and only in a few minor scenes does his control slip, and she turns vacant or panicky.  Can she really act?  Hard to say, but she's enormously powerful at times, and her big number is really the knockout everyone says it is.  (Beyonce gets her own big number later on, a more contemporary MOR track called ""Listen,"" filmed in one big closeup, couldn't have taken one twentieth of the rehearsal time of ""Not Going,"" but it's almost as interesting filmically.)  The movie is designed like a perfectly polished machine to break you down, then I suppose to build you back to a partial reassembly of yourself in Act Two, but something in the machinery crumbles and we never really do get that resolution we've been longing for.Like, all through the movie, CC's been just as venal as Curtis, and all of a sudden he snaps and joins the opposition?

1061835,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000O174CM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Dreamgirls"" has finally arrived on the screen. After being touted all of 2006 as the film to beat come award season, the expectations within the industry seemed impossibly high. After unveiling a sequence at Cannes, the Oscar talk began in earnest--months and months before its release (or anyone actually seeing the final product). Can any film really sustain this type of hype? Does ""Dreamgirls"" live up to it? The answer is a qualified ""No."" But that doesn't mean that ""Dreamgirls"" isn't a worthy film, for it is. It is an extremely well made and beautifully performed movie musical. It isn't breaking any new ground, however--but very few, if any, films that year could have been the wondrous creation that insiders were expecting of ""Dreamgirls.""""Dreamgirls"" tells the story of a girls' group (based loosely on the Supremes). The Dreamettes get their break singing backup to a legendary soul performer (played with gusto by Eddie Murphy). Guided by their manager (Jamie Foxx), the trio take the gig hoping to break out on their own. Effie, played by Jennifer Hudson, is ostensibly the group's leader as she is its frontwoman with an incredible singing voice. Also in the group is Deena, played by Beyonce. As Foxx positions the girls to be an act of their own, he asks Deena to step to the forefront as the most beautiful, and therefore commercially viable, asset of the group. This betrayal sets the stage for Effie's departure as she is relegated to singing backup for someone with less talent.The movie follows fairly conventional standards, the more successful the group gets--the more relationships suffer in the name of business. Foxx becomes the villain of the piece, and one by one, those who have been his allies fall by the wayside. The dramatics, especially in the second half, plod along at a predictable pace. It's here where the musical numbers rescue the picture. Where they are incorporated more effectively in the first hour, they become the whole movie near the end. So it's a good thing we have such a talented and engaging cast to keep us connected. Jennifer Hudson is a marvel, the movie (as the stage musical) clearly belongs to Effie. Eddie Murphy gamely triumphs. And Beyonce acquits herself well. Writing and incorporating her original song ""Listen"" into the musical's score gives Deena a soaring highpoint that she doesn't get on stage. Everyone in the cast is uniformly excellent.Of course, anyone familiar with music or musicals undoubtedly knows the signature anthem ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going."" Performed by Hudson as Effie is left behind, the song conveys so much emotion--pain and rage--that it is an instantly recognizable Broadway standard. Having won Jennifer Holliday a Tony Award as Effie, it is garnering many film awards for Hudson. If anything, though, the moment is so BIG--the number is actually a bit overproduced. With so many shifting camera angles, and a swirling crescendo of symphonic music--we threaten to lose the heart and soul of the song, its simple power. Credit Hudson, though, for keeping us grounded.I liked ""Dreamgirls"" a lot. Obviously it sounds great, but all the production values are topnotch. But for all that is good, we have lost some of the intimacy of the stage show. There are a number of moments that might have been scaled back. By showing restraint in the orchestrations and film technique--the voices, the lyrics and the acting could have more effectively conveyed genuine emotion--raw and powerful as the show should be. Bonus points for Loretta Devine (Broadway's Deena) popping up to sing a nightclub number near the end. Definitely recommended!

Those 2 made this movie. Let me just start by saying that Beyonce' who plays ""Deena Jones"" may as well have played her real life story. A story about a woman with less talent and better looks being placed as lead singer in a group where the talent is in the back where the looks aren't as important. Not to say that Beyonce' isn't talented, but Destiny's Child fans know what I mean. Anyways, that's another review though. Really, this movie is really about achieving your dreams no matter the cost. It chronicles the rise and fall of a female group of friends from stardom to their downfall when appearances seem to matter much more than real talent does. My girl Jennifer Hudson proves that she not only has the vocal talent, but the girl can act too. An Oscar for her would be well deserved, as well as Eddie Murphy who makes you laugh one minute, and feel incredibly sorry for him the next.

The previews show the movie as being a movie musical drama of a fictional pop girl-group from the 60's, done in a biography style. That was what made me want to see it.  I never saw this film until I bought the HD/DVD version.Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson are enough reason to watch this movie. Beyonce's cruves, beauty, and sweet voice are prefect as always.  And Hudson's attitude, and gospel like voice belted out with perfect pitch.  She proved beyond any doubt that she can sing and act like a pro. The story is a great tribute to the music and lives of the pioneers who revolutionized the music industry of the times.Jamie Fox wore his role like a glove.  But Eddie Murphy disappointed me. I am a big fan of Eddie Murphy movies and comedy routines.  But his character did not fit the role is this story.  He can not sing very well, and he is not the type to play a ""Ladies man"" role.  He was not convincing.  I kept waiting for him to break out into a comedy routine with his signature laugh.The only other part that did not fit into this fim was the singing of the story lines. Every time they got into a good dramatic part, they would break out into a musical singing the words. This reduced the dramatic feel of the moment to something kind of phony. This wasn't the movie musical ""Oklahoma"" or ""Funny Girl"". It was a story of a fictional singing group. It would have been much better as a good dramatic bio type movie instead of a musical.Still, I enjoyed the story, and the Dreams musical numbers were fantastic. The poetice justic in favor of Hudson's character was a very sweet ending. I cheered.  It is worth it just to see and hear Beyonce and Jennifer.

Jennifer was nearly 25 years ahead of her time when she starred in the Broadway version of ""Dreamgirls"" as Effie. Today, she's seen the show come to film and make another Jennifer, Jennifer Hudson, a star. Timing is everything. Hudson was poised like no other entertainer, to pick up the strings and threads left by the amazing Aretha Franklin as a queen of the soul sound.Amazing that she is propelled into the role by a movie, and not by a record. ""Dreamgirls"" is loosely based on actual Motown events, on promoter/producer Berry Gordy (Curtis Taylor, played by Jamie Foxx),an amalgam of a black male singer that is a combination of James Brown-Marvin Gay (James ""Thunder"" Early, played by Eddie Murphy) and a trio of female singers sketched after the Supremes. Like the Supremes, the trio starts with three girls who have been singing together forever (Effie, played by Hudson, Deena, played by Beyonce, and Lorrell, played by Anika Noni Rose) and who finally break into the Motown scene as backup singers. Involved in the success of the group is Effie's brother, who writes their songs (C.C. White, played by Keith Robinson).The movie takes the players through love and hardship, from gaining respect to being a multi-platinum success, with the downside issues that come with fame. Characters betray each other, love each other, find redemption.The music is spectacular, so much that I purchased the soundtrack. The world talks about Hudson's incredible solo of ""And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)."" I equally enjoyed her solo takes on ""I Am Changing"" and ""One Night Only"". She's incomparable. The group performance (with Eddie Murphy as lead) of the anti-war anthem, ""Patience"", was a highlight for me. And there is a sweet, sweet moment at the memorial service for Thunder, when Loretta Devine (from the Broadway production and the TV show Boston Public) sings ""I Miss You, Old Friend"".The costumes are equally well done, and the screenplay works hard to make the production flow (although it doesn't succeed nearly as well as ""Chicago"" did). It takes Dreamgirls from the tough times of the black music circuit in the 60's, to actual footage of the race riots and Martin Luther King, to the glitz of Miami and the disco scene, and the ennui that was Hollywood in those days.

Beyonce Knowles : Obviously modelled on Diana Ross, Beyonce flits in and out of this movie, holding us only with her beauty. This woman has no acting ability, lets face it, and her singing is only barely tolerable.2. Jennifer Hudson : A very overrated performance, in my opinion. She sings her heart out, but to me it seemed like a whole lot of nothing. At the most, it seemed like a young woman who wanted people to notice her performance and therefore went over-the-top. I didn't like this performance.3. Eddie Murphy : Adequate, but badly scripted. This role could have been done by any black actor of that age group, and Eddie does not add anything special to the role.THE DIRECTION & FEELI loved the direction, the sets and the orchestrated choreographed dance and song numbers. It all felt a bit overblown and HEARTLESS but hey thats just me. You'd probably love it more than I did.THE MUSICWe all know this was the weakest aspect of this movie. Even Hudsons' showstopper number (am I the only one waiting for her to shut up?) had no melody really. And other than ""Listen"" by Beyonce, I don't see anything here worth humming.FINAL THOUGHTSMy only sensation after watching this was ""What Happened to the Great American Musical?"". What happened to classics like ""The Sound of Music"", ""Carousel"" and ""State Fair""? Those were real musicals. ""Dreamgirls"" felt like a gigantic ornamental pom-pom stuffed in my face, and I just couldn't bring myself to like it.If you are a fan of this movie, sorry. I just have to say that I love musicals, and this was NOT a musical. It disrespects what a musical ought to be.Note to directors : Please do not cast Beyonce in the lead role in films anymore.

Probabbly because I like the whole musical thing. Bill Condon, who directed the film did a tremendous job. The lighting and the scenes with the dancing were incredible to watch. It was like we were at an actual Brodway show. Casting wise I will get into next.The cast on the other hand were OUTSTANDING! Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose and Eddie Murphy were perfect for these roles. Beyonce was great too. However, I think she needs a little work on her acting but her singing is phenomenal! I loved her as Denna Jones, It was a perfect first role for her. Anika Noni Rose as good too! She not that well known but she is another wonderful Dream! And of course the extraordinary Jennifer Hudson. She is my absoulte favorite character! When she sings ""And I'm Tell You"" I am blown away. She does that song so well that I like her better than Jennifer Holiday sorry to say.Some great dance numbers include ""Move, Stepin To The Bad Side, One Night Only, Dreamgirls, Love You I Do, Heavy, Fake Your Way To The Top.

""Dream Girls"" is certainly one of the most entertaining films that I've seen in 2006.  The film depicts the life of three highly talented women in search of a break in the music industry.  With a star studded cast representing a collage of the experiences of many African American performers of old, ""Dream Girls"" is a musical that rocks, pops and rolls.  Yet, for all the originality in song writing and costume, the film lacks originality in nearly everything else.  It's often said that there are no new stories, the talent lies in being able to tell it originally.  There has been great buzz about the Oscar potential of this film but I simply don't see it.  There were no extraordinary performances by the cast.  Although the cast delivered good performances they weren't stretched much do so.  Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles sang exceptionally, but they are singer so there's no real stretch to do that.  When in an acting role, reciting lines and establishing presence on stage in character, Beyonce is simply average.  Although Eddie Murphy was highly entertaining as James Early, he is also a singer and entertainer and wasn't stretched much in the role (actually, I couldn't see him as anyone other than Eddie Murphy).  Jennifer Hudson, the neophyte of the troupe was by far the most convincing performance in the film although Tony award winning Anika Noni Rose did a superb job.I'm recommending this film for its entertainment value.  You'll snap your fingers, bob your head and pat your feet throughout the film.  Jennifer Hudson's soulfully gut wrenching rendition of ""  . . . I'm Not Going"", moved the audience to applauds and cheers and the neatly wrapped way in which the film ends will leave you heart happy but this is not an Oscar winning film in my opinion, unless Hudson get the award for her supporting role.

But no, there's no backing track at the some point, and it's simply stupid for them to start singing their lines.Basically, there's no story. It's trying to work a story around the songs, basing the story around the story of the Supremes, and also possibly Destiny's Child if you look closely enough. There's absolutely no point to Eddie Murphy's character, he has become a paraody of himself, and was pretty much playing Donkey the entire role.Beyonce lost approximately 20lbs to play this role, which was absolutely unnecessary since she had a gorgeous figure as it was.

Yet  it is possible to count on one hand the so-called classic, successful musicals and even these are wide open to discussion. The musical most often mentioned as the ""best"" as in the most cogent blending of music, comedy and performance is ""Singing in the Rain"" already some 50 years old. ""An American in Paris, ""42nd Street,"" ""Funny Girl"" (whose success owes more to Barbra Streisand then to the film surrounding it) are also mentioned as the ""best.""On the stage, being a more synthetic art form than the more naturalistic movies, bursting into song somehow seems more appropriate though even in the theater it's a stretch. Whether we accept it in movies or the theater has to do with whether we are willing to suspend our disbelief: are we being romanced and convinced by what we see and hear though what we hear and see might be pure fantasy? And though it is fantasy do we really care?So now we have Bill Condon's (screenwriter of ""Chicago"" and director of the sublime ""Gods and Monsters"" and ""Kinsey"") ""Dreamgirls"" and the dynamic, electric performance of Jennifer Hudson as Effie: one of the Dreams a girl singing group that also includes Deena (a subdued yet magnificently-voiced Beyonce' Knowles) and child-like Lorrell (Noni Rose).In a nutshell, ""Dreamgirls"" is best when it is singing: Effie's 10 minute ""And I'm Telling You I'm not going"": a tour-de-force full of rage, passion and heartbreaking candor,  Deena's ""Listen"" which Beyonce' delivers with conviction and dignity in her trademark velvet tones.Director Condon is after more  here than a fluid blending of movie and music which he definitely delivers. But he also shows us the inevitable dumbing down of formidable talent as a prerequisite to making it in Pop Music: i.e. the decline and decimation of Eddie Murphy's James Brown/Sam Cooke-like Jimmy and of course of the Dreams themselves: both of whom have their roots firmly entrenched in the gospel tradition who are convinced/forced into changing their styles by the svengali-like Curtis Taylor of Jamie Foxx  so as to take advantage of the more lucrative anglo pop market. Taylor is right of course and the Dreams become superstars while Jimmy's career takes a nose-dive.One of the best things about ""Dreamgirls"" is the fluid manner in which Condon directs this film: scenes flow seamlessly and naturally from one to another giving you the feeling of a stage performance as hydraulics change scenery effortlessly and quietly.Some of the scenes between the musical numbers are lifeless but others are not. Where ""Dreamgirls"" shines though is in the mostly breathtaking musical numbers: Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce', Eddie Murphy ( a brilliant performance in which he displays a heretofore untapped vein of desperation he has never exhibited before) and of course, the songs and lyrics of Harry Krieger and Tom Eyen.This film is not perfect but when it is good it definitely packs a whallop. ""Dreamgirls"" is many things but ultimately it is a serious musical film made with exquisite taste, an extraordinary sense of character and motivation and a reverence for the source material.

I love music, especially that the 60s and 70s R&B; flavor. Some say they thought there was too much singing. Well, it was based on a musical. This was a Moviecal, and much singing should have been expected, considering most of the actors/actresses were singers, including Jamie Foxx.I give the movie 4 stars because of it's spirited plot, but I think there should have been more to Deena and Curtis's relationship. They seemed more like they worked together than husband and wife. And I lost respect for Deena when she stole her girlfriend's man. Well, at least the cast the right person (Beyonce) into that role. She does strike one as such. She's okay but her role could have had more fire. I well know that Beyonce could have pulled off a more interesting character than the low-keyed one they put her into. That's why I feel there should have been more substance to her relationship with Curtis (Jamie Foxx). When they finally broke up, she did nothing except packed her suitcase. Married people who are breaking up don't just do that. And they don't make up a song, nine to ten. No fanfare (other than the song ""Listen"") to their breaking up. Good Movie.

1061868,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000O174CM,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Dreamgirls"" is a cinematic version of the Tony award-winning musical that had a 4-year run on Broadway in the 1980s. Inspired by 1960s R&B; girl groups and the rise of Motown Records, the musical follows the personal trials and career triumphs of a trio called ""The Dreams"". By making subtle changes in the characters' circumstances, the movie associates The Dreams more closely with The Supremes than the stage musical did. Although it's easy to identify the movie's inspirations in the history of The Supremes, this is clearly a fictionalized account that has just enough real life to tantalize the audience. The film introduces some new songs but has less music than the stage production, as it's shorter.Three hopeful young women sing their way into the audience's hearts at a Detroit talent show, where they are spotted by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), an ambitious manager who thinks the ladies are just what aging R&B; star Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy) needs to revitalize his act. Curtis signs ""The Dreamettes"" as back up singers and sends them on tour. Determined to achieve success on the pop charts, Curtis makes them a stand-alone act, moving willful, talented Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) to backup role and replacing her with the pretty, slighter chanteuse Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), who, along with backup singer Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), become ""The Dreams"". The act is a hit, but Effie's resentment and Curtis' stifling control breed behind-the-scenes strife.""Dreamgirls"" is a slick, competent, thoroughly conventional musical that doesn't find its footing until about halfway through. The first hour is frankly dull. But the story becomes more compelling as it progresses and tensions between the characters heighten. I wasn't impressed by the singing. I would expect better on Broadway. But The Supremes were never strong singers, and the lovely Beyonce Knowles, who rose to stardom helming girl group Destiny's Child, is the perfect choice for Diana Ross-inspired Deena. Jennifer Hudson won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her Florence Ballard-inspired role. There is no subtlety in the performances, but if I had to choose a stand-out, it would be Eddie Murphy. In any case, there are enough showmanship and intriguing insinuations in ""Dreamgirls"" to satisfy.The DVD (Paramount 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc include 12 Extended and Alternate Scenes, and a Music Video (4 min) for the song ""Listen"" performed by Beyonce Knowles.

Every scene flowed into the next, no blackouts.  Add to that a brilliant book and score with sets, costumes and lighting to match, you have an incredible experience.When I heard that Bill Condon (who adapted the screenplay of Chicago)was writing and directing, I was happy.  Too many musical transfers have been ruined by putting them in the hands of directors who have never had any musical experience (John Huston & Annie and Richard Attenburough & A Chrous Line). But unfortunately, it just proves how great a director Rob Marshall is.Dreamgirls is about family, fame and how the American public rewards beauty over talent.  The film forgets this and trys to be about the Motown experience and doesn't accomplish this.The Dreamette are three friends that dream of fame as a girl group.  Effie is the lead singer of the group and her brother CC writes the songs.  The girls go to a local talent competition and meet promoter Curtis Taylor. He immediately sees the girl's potential.  To get them started he makes them the back up singer for fading star James ""Thunder"" Early.When it is time for the Dreamettes to breakaway to become The Dreams, Curtis moves the beautiful Deena to be the lead and makes the more talented Effie step to backup.  This creates an on going conflict between the two divas.Eventually, Effie is replaced and the Dreams becomes supertars.  Effie eventually rebuilds her career with the help of her old manager. (To me the best moment is Jennifer singing ""I'm Changing"")  CC eventually realizes that Curtis only concern is the bottom line and goes back to Effie to help her comeback.This sets up a final battle between Effie and Curtis when Curtis wants CC's new song for The Dreams to lauch Disco.  This leads to the great scene where CC puts it all on the line.  In the end, everyone sees Curtis for what he is and all the Dreams reunite for one last time.Add to this basic storyline, riots, assinations, and drugs and you have the movie.Part of the problem is that Condon wanted to make this an issue film instead a of a slice of entertainment history.  The other problem is that he does not trust the musical forum.There are a number of occasions where he omitted the intro of a song (sometimes he would use the lyrics spoken!) and other times use the intro??  The best example is in Cadillac Car.  In  the musical, the intro to the song talks about how different groups of used ownership of Cadillac Cars to prove that they were equal to the White upper class.People say that musicals are impractical because people don't break out in song in real life. Well 90% of all films have characters doing improbable things. But most people will see a film if it is done well, people don't care!One final thing is that Condon reduced all characters to supporting roles there were really no leading performaces, this is a ensemble movie.  (I don't really know if this is a positive or negative.)When Ann Reinking revived Chicago, I told people that if they never saw Bob Fosse's original production with Chita, Gwen and Jerry, then see the new show and you will love it. But if you had, don't expect the new production to be as good.  That is what I say of this film.  You will still like the film but the stage production was definitely superior.",4,"If you haven't seen Michael Bennet's production you will love this film.

I loved the story and music then and, with a few reservations, love it nearly just as much now.  I won't spend time reviewing the content of the movie beyond saying that Dreamgirls has some truly great musical setpieces, mired in a fragmeted, episodic presentation that I do not remember being so prevalent in the stage production.As far as this blu-ray release goes, this is 5-star demo material through and through.  The source is literally flawless, with colors, contrast and black levels all rock solid.  Images are crystal clear with stunning texture detail and depth of field.  Like Hairspray, this film appears somehow more colorful than real life.  This appears to be the intent of the filmakers and is not a knock against the excellent transfer at all.Regarding the audio, there is NO HI-RES AUDIO on this disc!  This is inexplicable given that it is a musical.  However, the included 640kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is among the best non-hi-res soundtracks I've ever heard.  It just makes me wonder how much better it could have sounded in a lossless format (sigh).In summary, I have some issues with the film overall but would own it anyway for the great music and setpieces.

1061879,AMXRE0V10VO1J,B000O174CM,Music Man,"[2, 6]","""Dreamgirls"" is far and away the best movie musical since the latest wave began with the enemic ""Evita"" several years back.  Pure entertainment, this is not a film for the deep thinking film afficianado.  However, for those who believe that a movie's first priority is to entertain, this is the real thing.  The two hours fly by with one spectacular song after another.  The story, supposedly based on the Supremes and Motown, is somewhat hackneyed at times as it covers classic ""trials-and-tribulations"" of ""Show Business"", but the performances are so uniformly astounding that they overcome this minor obstacle and make this a stirring experience.  From the first quadruple punch of four Motown-type performerances, energized to the max, you know you're in for a flashy ride.This is the most complete rendition of the original Broadway score in existence and is vocally better in every way.  Jamie Foxx is the insidious promotor and he does not compromise his performance for likability.  But he's the slime who helps the ""Dreams"" reach their pinnacle, a needed fulcrum to the story.  Still, his cruelty is something to behold and, like Eddie Murphy, he surprises with a vocal expertise heretofore unexposed.  Murphy is the true surprise of the film, although Jennifer Hudson seems to be getting most of the press.  He's astounding, and he hits all of the right notes, dramatically, emotionally, and certainly vocally, where he sounds like the real thing.  Oscar should be paying close attention.Then there is the classic triumvirate of Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose.  Knowles has received both kudos and slaps for her understated performance, but that's exactly how the character of Deena should be played.  She is the one character who truly grows in subtle shadings to the strong woman she has become in the film's energetic finale.  Knowles' charisma is undeniable throughout, and she reigns in her powerhouse voice for her Motown-like stylings, only to let loose in the astonishing ""Listen"".  When she is onscreen, you can't take your eyes off of her.  Her acting / singing talent demands attention.Jennifer Hudson is a vocal delight throughout, though her tough characterization of Effie in the first half of the film comes off as a one-note, sassy and stubborn ""broad"" and it gets a bit tiresome.  However, by ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"", she hits her stride, displays Effie's vulnerability, and from that point on, she imbues her character not only with stubborness, but strength and dignity as well.  And the additional vocals, ""I Am Changing"", the ""Dreamgirls"" finale and ""One Night Only"" are some of the films many highlights.Anika Noni Rose has a voice for the ages, and most of the back-up vocals benefit greatly from her range and expressiveness.  Her duet with Murphy on ""Patience"" is a truly exciting moment and the two performers connect emotionally in a stunning manner.  While not given the screen time of the other two ""divas"", she holds her own and proves that great things are in her future.But everyone is at their best here, including director Bill Condon, who does a much better job here than in the massively overrated ""Chicago"".  He doesn't overdo the MTV style of quick cuts and allows his camera to hold on his actors to enable them to express their range of emotions.  And boy, does he make this film move.  ""Dreamgirls"" is top-knotch in every way.  Easily one of the best and most entertaining films of 2006.  And in some ways, a total surprise and a testament to the ongoing excellence of so many talented and underused African-American performers in the American film industry.",5,Dreams Do Come True!,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,3643,"['Dreamgirls', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'movie', 'musical', 'latest', 'wave', 'began', 'enemic', 'Evita', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'Pure', 'entertainment', 'not', 'film', 'deep', 'thinking', 'film', 'afficianado', 'However', 'who', 'believe', 'movie', 'first', 'priority', 'entertain', 'real', 'thing', 'two', 'hours', 'fly', 'one', 'spectacular', 'song', 'story', 'supposedly', 'based', 'Supremes', 'Motown', 'somewhat', 'hackneyed', 'times', 'classic', 'trials-and-tribulations', 'Show', 'Business', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'uniformly', 'astounding', 'overcome', 'minor', 'obstacle', 'make', 'stirring', 'experience', 'first', 'quadruple', 'punch', 'four', 'Motown-type', 'performerances', 'energized', 'max', 'know', ""'re"", 'flashy', 'ride.This', 'most', 'complete', 'rendition', 'original', 'Broadway', 'score', 'existence', 'vocally', 'better', 'way', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'insidious', 'promotor', 'not', 'compromise', 'performance', 'likability', 'slime', 'who', 'Dreams', 'reach', 'pinnacle', 'needed', 'fulcrum', 'story', 'Still', 'cruelty', 'something', 'behold', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'vocal', 'expertise', 'heretofore', 'unexposed', 'Murphy', 'true', 'surprise', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'be', 'getting', 'most', 'press', 'astounding', 'right', 'notes', 'dramatically', 'emotionally', 'certainly', 'vocally', 'where', 'real', 'thing', 'Oscar', 'should', 'be', 'paying', 'close', 'attention.Then', 'classic', 'triumvirate', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'Knowles', 'received', 'kudos', 'slaps', 'understated', 'performance', 'exactly', 'how', 'character', 'Deena', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'truly', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'strong', 'woman', 'become', 'film', 'energetic', 'finale', 'Knowles', 'charisma', 'undeniable', 'powerhouse', 'voice', 'Motown-like', 'stylings', 'only', 'let', 'loose', 'astonishing', 'Listen', 'When', 'onscreen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'her', 'acting', '/', 'singing', 'talent', 'demands', 'attention.Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'vocal', 'delight', 'tough', 'characterization', 'Effie', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'off', 'one-note', 'sassy', 'stubborn', 'broad', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'However', ""'m"", 'Telling', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Going', 'stride', 'Effie', 'vulnerability', 'point', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'stubborness', 'strength', 'dignity', 'as', 'well', 'additional', 'vocals', 'Am', 'Changing', 'Dreamgirls', 'finale', 'One', 'Night', 'Only', 'are', 'films', 'many', 'highlights.Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'voice', 'ages', 'most', 'back-up', 'vocals', 'benefit', 'greatly', 'range', 'expressiveness', 'duet', 'Murphy', 'Patience', 'truly', 'exciting', 'moment', 'two', 'performers', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'stunning', 'manner', 'not', 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'two', 'divas', 'own', 'great', 'things', 'are', 'future.But', 'everyone', 'best', 'here', 'including', 'director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'here', 'massively', 'overrated', 'Chicago', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'MTV', 'style', 'quick', 'cuts', 'camera', 'hold', 'actors', 'enable', 'express', 'range', 'emotions', 'boy', 'make', 'film', 'move', 'Dreamgirls', 'top-knotch', 'way', 'Easily', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', '2006', 'ways', 'total', 'surprise', 'testament', 'ongoing', 'excellence', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'underused', 'African-American', 'performers', 'American', 'film', 'industry']",N/A

Then came Queen Latifah's role in Chicago in 2002, followed by the hit Ray in 2005.  But whereas Latifah had only a supporting role in Chicago, and Ray was more a drama with great music, this movie is truly a musical in every sense of the word, with all the major roles played by African-Americans.  The story is of three women in Detroit who grow up as childhood friends and become international pop stars.  Along the way, they meet men, become rich, break up, and finally reunite at the end of the movie.  The casting is great, and includes both older (Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover) and younger (Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx) stars.  Many of them turn in great musical performances, and my personal favorite is Eddie Murphy, who puts in one dazzling stage show after another.  The movie portrays multiple facets of the celebrity life such as betrayal, substance abuse, sexual rivalries, money-grubbing, contractual disputes, and the ever present dumbing down of content to increase sales.  The movie makes occasional references to race issues.As a musical, the music pieces ranged from good to great.  Their placement in the movie however, was not the best.  The movie broke out in music during proper music scenes, like during the scenes of performances.  But the movie also had songs during ""non-music"" scenes.  For example, many conversations became singing scenes.  Unfortunately, the most heartfult songs; those with the most emotion, fell into the latter category, whereas the the stage performance songs sounded like generic pop hits.  This might have been done on purpose, as a reflection of the character Curtis's belief that the music has to be superficial and shallow enough to please all crowds.  But it detracted from the movie as half the songs had little heart but too much glitz.  This, and the constant replacement of dialogue with music was probably why this movie did not receive the Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.  My belief is that it is a better musical than Ray (also starring Jamie Foxx), but had nowhere near the heart or emotional punch to it.This DVD is fairly straightforward; movie plus extra scenes.

For this is a film steeped in the tradition of those fabulous M-G-M musicals of days gone by.  Executive Producer Patricia Whitcher pushed all of the right buttons in assembling an incredibly talented ensemble that makes ""Dreamgirls"" one of the finest musicals of the past quarter century.As most people know, ""Dreamgirls"" is loosely based on the story of Berry Gordy's Motown records and the popular 1960's girl group The Supremes.  The star-studded cast includes Eddie Murphy in what just might be the finest performance of his career, the multi-talented Jamie Fox,  Beyonce Knowles and Jennifer Hudson who earned herself an Acadamy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Effie White.  Those of you who are not familiar with the meteoric rise of Gordy's Motown empire in the early 1960's will get yourself a pretty good history lesson here.  The rest of us can focus on the splendid acting performances by just about everyone involved.  What can you say about the musical score for this film?  SImply outstanding!  Among the tunes I enjoyed the most were ""Patience"", ""I Miss You Old Friend""  and Jennifer Hudson's remarkable performance on a pair of tunes ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" and most of all  ""One Night Only"".  Add to this mix the terrific choreography throughout ""Dreamgirls"" and what you have is one thoroughly enjoyable motion picture experience.  Frankly, I thought that the first 30 minutes or so of ""Dreamgirls"" was rather ordinary. Perhaps this is a consequence of the film losing something in the translation from the original stage show.  But the film rapidly gains momentum after that and ends in a flourish. I must admit that I am disappointed that I missed seeing ""Dreamgirls"" on the big screen but this is a flick that I am definitely going to want to see again.  Kudos to everyone involved!

Garrard ""the G-man""","[3, 5]","2006's ""Dreamgirls"" shares much in common with 1985's ""The Color Purple"": a film with a mostly-black cast helmed by a white director (the latter guided by Bill Condon and the former by Steven Spielberg), a story adapted from another medium (""Purple"" from Alice Walker's bestseller and ""Dreamgirls"" from the Broadway hit), a running time of over two hours (""The Color Purple"" at 154 minutes while ""Dreamgirls"" runs at only 131), and multiple Oscar nominations but with few or no wins (eleven for ""Purple"" with no wins, eight for ""Dreamgirls"" with only two wins).It is the latter reason that is the greatest injustice.  Though he was nominated for best supporting actor, Eddie Murphy lost to Alan Arkin in the category and that loss was one of Oscar's greatest blunders.  Murphy is spectacular as the over-the-top-soul-man James ""Thunder"" Early in what could truly be described as that proverbial ""role of a lifetime.""  It's as though he was destined to play that part and he should have received an Oscar for his efforts.However, his is not the only ouststanding acting job in the film.  Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, and, in a lesser yet pivotal role, Danny Glover, all deliver brilliant performances and, for that, the film presents one of the best ensembles of the year.This multi-disc compilation is a packaging wonder.

1061899,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B000O174CM,Regina McMenamin,"[2, 5]","Based on the Broadway musical of the same name - and recommended to anyone with a pulse - DREAMGIRLS tells the story of a 60s-era girl group that rises to national fame after losing an amateur talent contest. Boasting a superstar cast, the film features Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles and Anika Noni Rose and introduces Jennifer Hudson, a shoo-in for the best supporting actress Oscar.When the film begins we meet three teenaged girls as they arrive late for the competition. Wearing drug store wigs and matching sherbet-colored gowns, the Dreamettes are played by pop star Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, American Idol-contestant Jennifer Hudson and Tony Award-winner Anika Noni Rose.Beyonc&eacute; is Deena Jones, a thinly veiled Diana Ross-like character. Slim with a silky voice, Deena perfectly contrasts with Effie White (played by Jennifer Hudson), the big-boned, big-personality lead singer who knows she has the superior, big-time voice. Anika Noni Rose perfectly portrays Lorrell Robinson, the third fiddle. Starstruck, Lorrell is thrilled to be on stage, happy to sing back up and all too willing to accept the role of mistress to James ""Thunder"" Early, masterfully played by Eddie Murphy.Backstage the girls meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., a Berry Gordy-like character and wannabe record producer, slickly played by Jamie Foxx. Taylor hires the Dreamettes to sing back up to Early, a performer who is one part James Brown, one part Little Richard and one part Marvin Gaye.After months on the road, Taylor launches the girls as the Dreams, a teenaged trio much like the Supremes. Though the girls are initially thrilled to have an act of their own, their happiness is shattered when Taylor demotes Effie to back up and announces that the more photogenic Deena will be the lead singer.I am surprised that the Effie role is considered a supporting one. The emotional center of the story, Effie is a fascinating character who dominates the film. Not only is her voice truly spectacular, but also her painful struggle drives the plot from start to finish. By contrast the alleged lead role of Deena is nothing more than that of a coat hanger. Gorgeous with the perfect body and face to launch a thousand fashion trends, Deena is also vapid. An easily-manipulated pawn in Taylor's plan to dominate the music industry, she becomes the headlining face of the Rainbow Records look and sound.Worth noting here is the star-power of this truly spectacular cast. I cannot recall seeing this much talent in any film since the Godfather. Not only are these world-class actors, but also all are surprisingly great singers. Even comedic great Eddie Murphy more than holds his own musically as the campy, troubled R&B; singer. Denying him an Academy Award for this performance would be criminal.Highly recommended, DREAMGIRLS proves that with a great story, a film featuring an almost exclusively African-American cast can easily capture the hearts of a multicultural audience. I saw this film at a matinee filled with blue-haired white retirees who cheered as the credits rolled.- Regina McMenamin",5,Believe the Hype,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,3095,"['Based', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'pulse', 'DREAMGIRLS', 'story', '60s-era', 'girl', 'group', 'national', 'fame', 'losing', 'amateur', 'talent', 'contest', 'Boasting', 'superstar', 'cast', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'introduces', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'shoo-in', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Oscar.When', 'film', 'meet', 'three', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'arrive', 'late', 'competition', 'Wearing', 'drug', 'store', 'wigs', 'matching', 'sherbet-colored', 'gowns', 'Dreamettes', 'are', 'played', 'pop', 'star', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'American', 'Idol-contestant', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Tony', 'Award-winner', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose.Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Deena', 'Jones', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'Diana', 'Ross-like', 'character', 'Slim', 'silky', 'voice', 'Deena', 'perfectly', 'Effie', 'White', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'big-boned', 'big-personality', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'superior', 'big-time', 'voice', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'perfectly', 'Lorrell', 'Robinson', 'third', 'fiddle', 'Starstruck', 'Lorrell', 'thrilled', 'be', 'stage', 'happy', 'sing', 'back', 'up', 'too', 'willing', 'accept', 'role', 'mistress', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Murphy.Backstage', 'girls', 'meet', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'Jr.', 'Berry', 'Gordy-like', 'character', 'wannabe', 'record', 'producer', 'slickly', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Taylor', 'Dreamettes', 'sing', 'back', 'Early', 'performer', 'who', 'one', 'part', 'James', 'Brown', 'one', 'part', 'Little', 'Richard', 'one', 'part', 'Marvin', 'Gaye.After', 'months', 'road', 'Taylor', 'girls', 'Dreams', 'teenaged', 'trio', 'much', 'Supremes', 'girls', 'are', 'initially', 'thrilled', 'have', 'act', 'own', 'happiness', 'shattered', 'when', 'Taylor', 'Effie', 'back', 'up', 'announces', 'more', 'photogenic', 'Deena', 'will', 'be', 'lead', 'singer.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'Effie', 'role', 'considered', 'supporting', 'one', 'emotional', 'center', 'story', 'Effie', 'fascinating', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'voice', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'also', 'painful', 'struggle', 'plot', 'start', 'finish', 'contrast', 'alleged', 'lead', 'role', 'Deena', 'nothing', 'more', 'coat', 'hanger', 'Gorgeous', 'perfect', 'body', 'face', 'launch', 'thousand', 'fashion', 'trends', 'Deena', 'also', 'vapid', 'easily-manipulated', 'pawn', 'Taylor', 'plan', 'dominate', 'music', 'industry', 'headlining', 'face', 'Rainbow', 'Records', 'look', 'sound.Worth', 'noting', 'here', 'star-power', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'cast', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'seeing', 'much', 'talent', 'film', 'Godfather', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'world-class', 'actors', 'also', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'singers', 'Even', 'comedic', 'great', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'more', 'own', 'musically', 'campy', 'troubled', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'Denying', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'criminal.Highly', 'recommended', 'DREAMGIRLS', 'great', 'story', 'film', 'featuring', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'African-American', 'cast', 'can', 'easily', 'capture', 'hearts', 'multicultural', 'audience', 'saw', 'film', 'matinee', 'filled', 'blue-haired', 'white', 'retirees', 'who', 'cheered', 'credits', 'rolled.-', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",N/A

After watching the film, I think it would be interesting to see the 2nd disc. ""Dreamgirls"" is a good film, with very good characters and character development. Bill Condon kept the essence of the goings-on, and the editing of Virginia Katz kept a good flow of events. The cast is outstanding, with Jennifer Hudson centering the film in an auspicious award-winning performance; it is a many-layered performance, and she shines brightest of all. Jamie Foxx & Danny Glover are fine, as are Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. One of the best performances in the film is by Keith Robinson, who is usually relegated somewhat to the background, but is really a catalyst in the plot as Hudson's brother. There is also some of the best choreography I've seen in a long time (by Fatima Robinson), but not enough. The surprise cameos of John Lithgow & John Krasinski were also a treat. One thing that bothered me about previous reviewers was that it was too ""white"", whatever that means. Indeed, as a period piece, where Black musicians weren't allowed on shows like American Bandstand, and had to make due with their own localized record labels, those performers had to break through insurmountable barriers. These performers were intelligent people, and I'm glad they didn't resort to ebonic stereotypes. Eddie Murphy may have deserved the Oscar, if only for his long and illustrious career. But so did Alan Arkin, for the same reason; both actors were killed off early in the film. Eddie certainly gave it energy! But, in the end, it's Hudson you'll remember. Her strength and determination really commands, and she sings well, too. I never found it boring.

So after a while that I hadn't watched a musical (it goes back as far as 2002's ""Chicago""), I was quite enthralled. After all, a critically acclaimed film boasting Hollywood luminaries such as Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and Beyonce Knowles can not go wrong, right? wrong. The first thing that popped into my mind half way through the film, is why the hell Hudson has to burst into song every time she tells someone off. We got the idea that it's a musical but her sudden shrieking was totally out of place and detracted rather than added. Secondly, Eddie Murphy is a brilliant actor, and though I understand he only had a supporting role, I felt his part was a bit underplayed. His moments on the screen were the highlights of the movie and his role could have been upped just a bit. And last but not least, have you noticed how everything turns OK all at once, just before the movie ends? (Effie gets Curtis off her back, Deena leaves Curtis, Curtis learns he has a daughter). That said, the movie does have its share of good drama (Effie's told she's being relegated to sing back up for Deena - come on, you can't be that cold-hearted not to feel sorry for her), fine acting (again, Murphy delivers great acting as usual and Hudson as well; that is, up until she starts trilling) and (the film) is a feast for the eyes. As for Miss Knowles, I couldn't help but giggle when I remembered how she used her real-life group members to model her clothing-line on the Oprah Winfrey show. I couldn't decide what's worse. All in all, though the film is not without its flaws, it's worth watching and is enjoyable throughout. Just don't expect too much and don't be fooled by the hype.

The women in the film sparkle with both talent, grace and beauty.  The men, both entertainers and agents, are sleazy enough to want to make you take a good both after watching them.  They are acquisitive, double-dealing and sleazy.  Eddie Murphy as a James Brown surrogate does an especially great job.  Consumed by intemperance and drugs he crashes out before the end of the movie.  It is a little difficult to understand why the female ""Dreams"" love these creeps but...hey...it's Hollywood.""The Dreams"" are fairly clearly styled on the ""Supremes"" and their music and back up verges on the spectacular.  The choreography is every bit as good as the original 'Supremes"", maybe better.  Effie, as the not quite so pretty and a little overweight member of the developing group that will become the ""Dreams"", is especially good.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[6, 12]","So many people I know were flying out the door to see this movie, and I'd read a bunch of articles in Ebony, JET, and Essence about it, but for some reason, the previews didn't get me and I'm a big fan of musicals.  Although I like Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson is cool, I was more interested in seeing Eddie Murphy again and hoping that Jamie Foxx sang.  The movie was your basic story about a girl group that blew up from a manager, and then the manager gave them problems.  One member left the group because of the media's superficiality and ended up with major issues.  Another member became a star and got more attention than anybody else.Cons: None of the songs really intrigued me and I was disappointed that Foxx didn't get to sing in his more powerful voice, but I do understand that his role did not call for it.  It wasn't a bad movie at all, but nothing about it got me excited.  I wouldn't want to see it again, but it was all right.  I think if I would've been into the songs enough to rewind them, then that would've made the movie for me, and usually in every musical, I find at least ONE really great song, but in this movie, I did not.Pros: I had heard that Jennifer Hudson killed that one solo and made the movie.  Sometimes I think she's in the habit of oversinging songs (it's the church background...a LOT of singers who grew up in churches have that singing style), but I was impressed by her voice on every last song; not enough to rewind but enough to make me rethink the idea of finally becoming a fan.  It threw me off because I wasn't a big fan of her on Idol, but I liked her in this movie.  I also liked how they showed how so many black R&B; artists were getting their songs stolen right under their noses from white R&B; groups.

1061911,A1MIWY5P4X6M4,B000O174CM,S. J. Koblentz,"[6, 10]","Simply stated - this movie, this musical, bowled me over and completely enveloped me in its acting, its production value and its music.  In my opinion, Dreamgirls creators have done the impossible - they have taken an award winning Broadway musical and made it better than the Broadway show that it was based upon.The production on screen allowed for a more complete telling of the story behind these women, their successes and their fears.  Success in this movie is directly associated with sacrifice - what will these women surrounder to in order to get the dream they want and what will it take for them to claim control over their lives in order to fulfill their destinies.There are however three production issues that could have been done differently that would have more firmly knitted the music to the storyline:* First, Beyonce's ""Listen"" number was misplaced in a recording studio; its should have played out that evening when she told Curtis she was leaving.* Secondly, Effie should have received another number - and expansion of ""Effie White is Going to Win"" in Curtis' office.* Finally, the producers should have addressed the most blatant oversight - a musical number for Lorelle.  It appeared in the stage version and was cut from th script or the film.  Anika Noni Rose did an outstanding job in her role, and the lack of a solo hurt her chances at the recognition that she should have received.Finally, after you see this movie you need to listen to the soundtrack and see how well the songs express the drama.  ""And I'm Telling You"" is NOT the best song in the movie.  That honor belongs to ""I am Changing""  The unsettling ""We Are Family"" is meant to stop the story, send a double message, and set the stage for Effie's impending removal from the group.  It works if you understand it, otherwise it feels misplaced.The message of the movie is that everyone has dreams, and that those dreams can come true if you seize your destiny and make those dreams come true for yourself.",5,A powerful fable on power and empowerment,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1995,"['Simply', 'stated', 'movie', 'musical', 'bowled', 'completely', 'enveloped', 'acting', 'production', 'value', 'music', 'opinion', 'Dreamgirls', 'creators', 'have', 'done', 'impossible', 'have', 'taken', 'award', 'winning', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'made', 'better', 'Broadway', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'upon.The', 'production', 'screen', 'allowed', 'more', 'complete', 'telling', 'story', 'women', 'successes', 'fears', 'Success', 'movie', 'directly', 'associated', 'sacrifice', 'what', 'will', 'women', 'surrounder', 'order', 'get', 'dream', 'want', 'what', 'will', 'take', 'claim', 'control', 'lives', 'order', 'fulfill', 'destinies.There', 'are', 'however', 'three', 'production', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'firmly', 'knitted', 'music', 'storyline', '*', 'First', 'Beyonce', 'Listen', 'number', 'was', 'misplaced', 'recording', 'studio', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'evening', 'when', 'told', 'Curtis', 'was', 'leaving', '*', 'Secondly', 'Effie', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'number', 'expansion', 'Effie', 'White', 'Going', 'Win', 'Curtis', 'office', 'Finally', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'addressed', 'most', 'blatant', 'oversight', 'musical', 'number', 'Lorelle', 'appeared', 'stage', 'version', 'was', 'cut', 'th', 'script', 'film', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'role', 'lack', 'solo', 'hurt', 'chances', 'recognition', 'should', 'have', 'received.Finally', 'see', 'movie', 'need', 'listen', 'soundtrack', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'songs', 'express', 'drama', ""'m"", 'Telling', 'NOT', 'best', 'song', 'movie', 'honor', 'belongs', 'am', 'Changing', 'unsettling', 'Are', 'Family', 'meant', 'stop', 'story', 'send', 'double', 'message', 'set', 'stage', 'Effie', 'impending', 'removal', 'group', 'understand', 'misplaced.The', 'message', 'movie', 'everyone', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'can', 'come', 'true', 'seize', 'destiny', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true']",N/A
1061912,A3GSUZ8S3Z988U,B000O174CM,Spencer,"[1, 1]","Dreamgirls was killed by its own hype. Going into the 2006 awards season, this film had been predicted as the frontrunner for Best Picture of the Year. However, upon its release, most found the film to lack in all the goods it was supposed to offer. That is not to say that the film was completely dead in the water. With Dreamgirls came the stardom that is now Jennifer Hudson, an ex-American Idol contestant. But overall, the Best Picture nomination was not in the stars for Dreamgirls (despite it taking home the honor for Best Picture: Musical/Comedy at the Golden Globes), and it seems to have slowly been forgotten over time, minus Hudson's star-making performance as Effie White.After some years, I finally decided to give Dreamgirls another watch, after reading someone gushing over it in their blog. Now, I have always been a huge fan of Dreamgirls, from the first time I saw it. I was lucky enough to witness it in theaters twice, and each time, I was slapped in the face with brilliance. I could hardly take it all in; it was sleek and quick (despite its 130 minute runtime), and I loved every minute of it. But much like everyone else, I almost forgot about it entirely. So it was with an almost gleeful anticipation that I rewatched it, and I have no idea why on earth I had forgotten about it in the first place.I mean, let's discuss the one slightly... not great quality about it: Jamie Foxx. He wasn't awful and he didn't make the movie suffer overall for it, but ultimately, furrowing your brow doesn't make you a sleaze. However, the case could be made that this was all intentional, he gave his character of Curtis no soul because he was a simply superficial man, claiming that music is supposed to merely sell... not to make a message and evoke emotion from its listeners. Maybe another rewatch is in order to fully understand his performance.But with that, we can get on to the good. Where to begin? This time, going into the film, there was no hype, there was nothing to be disappointed by. I just sat back and enjoyed the movie, and what an experience it was this time. And a large part of this is due to Bill Condon's fabulous direction. The film instantly starts in the fast paced world that all the characters are witnessing. We are there with them, and we watch as they go on through this journey. I sometimes thought it to be a fault that it was almost SO fast paced that we could hardly breathe and let the while movie sink in, but now I realize that is what makes it so brilliant in its own right: we are experiencing just as much as Effie, Deena and Lorrell are. We are just along for the ride. Along with that is the screenplay, which is subtly captivating, keeping us on course. This also walks hand-in-hand with the editing that never lets us look away from the story we are seeing, whether it be for the first time or after many viewings. The art direction is dazzling and the costume design is delicious, soulful to the period without detracting too much from the story. You notice the evolution of the costumes throughout the film, starting from frumpy, homely ensembles, to sophisticated and stylish dresses. It is all so splendid on the eyes.And finally, the ensemble is one to watch out for. Every part in the film has some significance to the story. That said, Anika Noni Rose steals her scenes with as much gusto as she possibly can with the limited screentime she is given against her co-stars. Beyonc&eacute; Knowles has always ilicited mixed responses for her performance as Deena, but this time around, I noticed the subtle mannerisms that help make Deena tic and why all of her actions unfold the way they do. It's not a performance that deserved Oscar consideration, but Knowles proves why she was cast as the ""lead"" aside from her star power and vocal ability. Despite what Curtis says to her in the film, she DOES have a voice with so much distinction and heart, her song ""Listen"" goes down as one of the films most heartfelt and raw scenes, thanks to Beyonc&eacute;'s gut wrenching vocals and delivery. And of course there is Eddie Murphy as Jimmy Early, the fading star who tries desperately to keep his image as an enteratiner. We slowly watch his descent from grace and Murphy delivers his best performance ever here. He's hilarious, but that exterior is slowly and slowly deteriorated with madness and drug addiction. His spiral is heartbreaking and honest, making his motives and storyline all the more upsetting and poignant.And that leaves the last performance to discuss: La Hudson. Taking home almost every award possible, Hudson sinks her teeth into the role of Effie White, and it is almost hard to imagine anyone else playing this role (even Jennifer Holliday who originated the role on Broadway). Some have criticized her acting (while still heralding her singing), but I just cannot see cracks in this performance. Effie is a diva through and through, and as we continue this journey with the Dreams, we see Effie emerge as a human being. We are just as much on this journey as she is. We see her blatantly snubbed and kicked to the curb, and through it all, she perserveres and comes back with so much fire and passion, it is almost incredible to watch. Hudson blows the roof off all of her performances, ""And I Am Telling You"" will go down in musical history from the heart and desperation Hudson displays here. From her phenomenal voice to her stage prescense, you cannot take your eyes off of her. My mouth was gaping open during her whole scene, I might've shed a tear during her scene... I really did. I felt every single emotion coming from her, not just in this scene, but in every scene we see Effie. Hudson just has this power of captivating her audience and she takes on this role with no inhibitions and crafts one of the past decade's finest performances.I know, I'm gushing. And I know I am definitely not the best at writing reviews, but these are just scattered thoughts on my latest viewing of Dreamgirls. It's a film gays will always worship, and a lot of it could... actually be seen as camp, and that makes me appreciate even that much more. But I hope it makes you all consider just watching it again. For me, it was an experience I won't soon forget.",4,Dreamgirls.

This movie is a crash-and-burn failure from the moment it begins to when the end credits roll.The music never sounds authentic to the time frame of the movie.  Even if somehow this crud had been released by Motown back in the day, it would've killed their reputation because none of them would have been hits.  Worst of the bunch is the kidnergarden joke of a song, ""Cadillac Car"".There was no need for it to be a true musical.  This could've been the phoney biopic that it is without having any of the actors singing their dialogue.What Jennifer Hudson does in this movie is merely an approximation of singing.  It's more commonly known as histrionics.  Her big moment of ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" (or whatever it's called) is painful and grating.Eddie Murphy is the only participant who hints at something better (even if his singing hasn't improved beyond his old James Brown routines and inane recordings in the '80s) - but on a dramatic level he is given nearly nothing to do.  His performance is comprised almost entirely of onstage songs, which are delivered with much energy but do not result in a well-crafted character.Not one single music biopic cliche is left unturned - and this is of course an entirely fictitous movie which COULD have resulted in some imagination.  Why not just watch a made-for-TV biopic likeThe TemptationsorThe Jacksons - An American Dream (The Complete Miniseries)because those are at the very least based on true stories.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[5, 8]","As a drama major in college, I bemoan the fact that roadshow versions of Broadway musicals are too damned expensive nowadays, especially when souvenir booklets and sweatshirts are factored in.  So I am grateful when an Oscar-winning writer/director like Bill Condon (GODS AND MONSTERS, CHICAGO) decides to lavishly film a Tony winner, like 1981's DREAMGIRLS.  It's a fabulous, glittering three-ring circus of a movie, with a strong script, stunning performances by three extraordinary African-American singers (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as Effie, Beyonce Knowles as Deena, and Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell), and dazzling theatrical lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (Tobias Schliesser is cinematographer).  It's a gem of a musical that, at a running time of 130 minutes and with twelve almost non-stop songs, has to be pretty close to the stage original.  And if some songs have been shortened, I did not notice.With lyrics by Tom Eyen, music by Henry Krieger, and choreography inspired by  Michael Bennett, DREAMGIRLS is loosely based on the rise and fall of the Supremes.  Effie, Deena, and Lorrell are here called The Dreams, and Jamie Foxx as Curtis Taylor is their arrogant manager.  He is not afraid to walk all over people in mid-1960's Detroit when the more talented Effie is put in the rear of the trio because Deena is more beautiful.  And Eddie Murphy (deservedly Oscar-nominated as James ""Thunder"" Early) never attracts a white crossover audience as a drug-addicted R&B; lounge singer; he eventually dies of a heroin overdose.  We follow The Dreams all the way to Los Angeles around 1975 as they try to make it as black singers in mostly white middle America over fifteen years or so.  The finale is a stupendous and dazzling, ten-star, rock-the-house affair that leads in to ten minutes of closing credits to let us know that literally hundreds of talented people on both sides of the camera helped bring this beloved stage musical to the screen as a razzle-dazzle affair.The version of DREAMGIRLS that I bought is the ""2-disk Showstopper Edition"", and they aren't kidding.  Disk one with the movie includes extended versions of all twelve musical numbers, a special cutting room floor Jennifer Hudson number, and a Beyonce music video.  And a mammoth disk 2 includes a full 2 hour documentary on creating both the stage musical and the movie step by step 25 years apart; auditions and screen tests; and individual featurettes on the dazzling lighting, creating the costumes, doing the editing, and many more technical shorts.  It should keep you out of trouble and humming happily for days on end.For once, new Hollywood has improved on old Hollywood by showing how to transfer an award-winning stage musical to the screen brilliantly and successfully.  DREAMGIRLS is a giddy and exhilarating knockout.  And, yes, it should have been an Oscar nominee for Picture and Director, though it got plenty of other nominations.  Like the brilliant LITTLE CHILDREN, also shut-out for Picture and Director, it will be fun to see what movies from 2006 people are still raving about in ten or twenty years.  By the way, do see DREAMGIRLS in wide-screen format for its Panavision images.

1061916,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000O174CM,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 8]","This film belongs to Hudson and Murphy who are both far more talented than most ever expected.I knew Jennifer Hudson could sing from her stint on American Ido, but I had no idea that was an actress too and I mean a top quality actress capable of pulling off an Academy Award in her very first film.  It's my sincere hope that we will see much more of her in the future even if the roles don't include music.  Hudson is simply an acting find and a visual delight to behold on the screen.  She is a charming as she is talented.Eddie Murphy's performance is as much high energy, flamboyant, and satrical as it is subtle, emotional and insightful.  I was floored by his flawless performance in this film and found it a terrible shame that he followed this dynamic performance with the totally distastefulNorbitwhich was released just prior to the Academy Awards and in which some believe cost him the Oscar.Members of the Academy are well-known for voting out an actor or actress based upon his or her personality as was the case with Madonna who gave an Oscar-caliber performance inEvita, but was shunned because she was . . . well . . . Madonna, and for voting out an actor or actress based upon a poor follow-up film released the same year and don't want to reward what they may consider a ""fluke"" performance as with Whoppie Goldberg inThe Color Purple(thankfully she finally got her well-deserved Oscar forGhost) years later.I believe Murphy really blew his Oscar chances for this film because of ""Norbit"" and that isn't fair, but it was predictable based on past Academy voting tendencies.  I generally believe in not holding things against a performer or a specific performance, but I have to admit that even I have moments of extreme bias, like anyone else, so I can understand how that happens.  This may have been Murphy's only real good shot at an Oscar, but we can always hope that he will be given another juicy role like this one to strut his considerable talents.Beyonce Knowles is no great actress, but she has terrific stage/screen presence that more than compensates for anything that she is lacking in genuine acting talent.  To her credit, I actually had trouble recognizing her early in the film.  I even asked my wife, ""Where the hell is Beyonce?  I thought she had a big role in this film.""  My wife then pointed her out and I was rather surprised at how well she disappeared into her role.  However, the more I thought about it the more I thought she didn't just ""disappear"" in what started out as a supporting role, but was simply more out shined and out-acted by Jennifer Hudson.  I don't mean that as an insult to Beyonce or her acting talent as she does have acting talent, but when surrounded by more genuine talent her limitations are clear no matter how beautiful she is, or how gifted she is as a singer, or how engaging she is generally as a stage performer.Moving on to Jamie Foxx I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with his performance in the film.  I can't pinpoint the problem, but I just feel that he felt somewhat out of his league amongst these great female performers.  His performance was simply below what he is capable of delivering, but that doesn't mean he was awful or miscast; he just wasn't at his best.Now, one might question that with all this talent in the film why so many on here haven't given it 5 stars.  I think the problem with this film is with the director.  The film seems disjointed somehow.  The editing isn't very smooth, transitions are weak, and the lack of focus on just who the ""stars"" are in the film creates an uneven film that works better in clips.  In other words, the sum of the parts don't equal the whole.  That may explain why so many ""liked"" the film, but didn't ""love"" it.  It goes down smooth enough, but it never became what it could have become and that feeling is usually the fault of the director.Overall, this is a fun and entertaining musical with some strong, dynamic performances, but still somewhat weak for this genre.",3,3.5 Stars:  Pleasing but a bit disappointing too.,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,4016,"['film', 'Hudson', 'Murphy', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'most', 'ever', 'expected.I', 'knew', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'could', 'sing', 'stint', 'American', 'Ido', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'actress', 'too', 'mean', 'top', 'quality', 'actress', 'capable', 'pulling', 'off', 'Academy', 'Award', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'sincere', 'hope', 'will', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'future', 'even', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'music', 'Hudson', 'simply', 'acting', 'find', 'visual', 'delight', 'behold', 'screen', 'charming', 'talented.Eddie', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'high', 'energy', 'flamboyant', 'satrical', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'insightful', 'was', 'floored', 'flawless', 'performance', 'film', 'found', 'terrible', 'shame', 'followed', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'totally', 'distastefulNorbitwhich', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'prior', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'believe', 'cost', 'Oscar.Members', 'Academy', 'are', 'well-known', 'voting', 'out', 'actor', 'actress', 'based', 'personality', 'was', 'case', 'Madonna', 'who', 'gave', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'inEvita', 'was', 'shunned', 'was', 'well', 'Madonna', 'voting', 'out', 'actor', 'actress', 'based', 'poor', 'follow-up', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reward', 'what', 'may', 'consider', 'fluke', 'performance', 'Whoppie', 'Goldberg', 'inThe', 'Color', 'Purple', 'thankfully', 'finally', 'got', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'forGhost', 'years', 'later.I', 'believe', 'Murphy', 'really', 'blew', 'Oscar', 'chances', 'film', 'Norbit', ""n't"", 'fair', 'was', 'predictable', 'based', 'past', 'Academy', 'voting', 'tendencies', 'generally', 'believe', 'not', 'holding', 'things', 'performer', 'specific', 'performance', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'have', 'moments', 'extreme', 'bias', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Murphy', 'only', 'real', 'good', 'shot', 'Oscar', 'can', 'always', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'juicy', 'role', 'one', 'strut', 'considerable', 'talents.Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'great', 'actress', 'terrific', 'stage/screen', 'presence', 'more', 'compensates', 'anything', 'lacking', 'genuine', 'acting', 'talent', 'credit', 'actually', 'had', 'trouble', 'recognizing', 'early', 'film', 'even', 'asked', 'wife', 'Where', 'hell', 'Beyonce', 'thought', 'had', 'big', 'role', 'film', 'wife', 'then', 'pointed', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'disappeared', 'role', 'However', 'more', 'thought', 'more', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'disappear', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'supporting', 'role', 'was', 'simply', 'more', 'out', 'shined', 'out-acted', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'insult', 'Beyonce', 'acting', 'talent', 'have', 'acting', 'talent', 'when', 'surrounded', 'more', 'genuine', 'talent', 'limitations', 'are', 'clear', 'matter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'how', 'gifted', 'singer', 'how', 'engaging', 'generally', 'stage', 'performer.Moving', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'problem', 'just', 'feel', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'league', 'great', 'female', 'performers', 'performance', 'was', 'simply', 'what', 'capable', 'delivering', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'awful', 'miscast', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'best.Now', 'one', 'might', 'question', 'talent', 'film', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', '5', 'stars', 'think', 'problem', 'film', 'director', 'film', 'disjointed', 'somehow', 'editing', ""n't"", 'very', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'are', 'weak', 'lack', 'focus', 'just', 'who', 'stars', 'are', 'film', 'uneven', 'film', 'better', 'clips', 'other', 'words', 'sum', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'equal', 'whole', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'liked', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'down', 'smooth', 'enough', 'never', 'became', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'feeling', 'usually', 'fault', 'director.Overall', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'musical', 'strong', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'still', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'genre']",N/A
1061917,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000O174CM,Steven Mason,"[0, 1]","I understand that this movie was ""based"" on groups like The Supremes and it was not intended to be a bio, but still I was disappointed at how little The Dreams resembled their inspiration. Yes, the glamour was there, but the music, which was fine, did not evoke The Supremes or even Motown.Beyonce, as Deena, plays the role of lead singer Diana Ross, but her role, both as a character and as a singer, is surprisingly weak in this film. Jennifer Hudson, as Effie, is supposed to represent Florence Ballard, and it is her character and singing that drive the movie. Effie's brother C.C. is the songwriter for the group, cranking out one hit after another.I didn't see the stage version of Dreamgirls. In the movie I felt confused about the firing and subsequent alienation of Effie. Deena began sleeping with Effie's fiance, Curtis (Jamie Foxx), the group's manager. Effie was missing rehearsals, arriving late, and ""making trouble"" due to ""medical problems"" (we find out later that she was pregnant by Curtis), so the entire group, who called themselves a ""family,"" fires Effie and pretty much tell her to get lost. For the next five years or so, while The Dreams go on to great success, Effie is a single mom on welfare, and not even Effie's brother knows that she has a kid. Then, when Effie suddenly comes back into the music scene, her brother tells her that he has written a sure-fire hit song for her that only she can sing, as if the last five cruel years hadn't happened! And suddenly all the bad things that happened to Effie were the fault of Curtis, not anyone else. What? During the final song, with Effie joining The Dreams once again, there is an odd scene with Curtis standing in the aisle staring, perplexed, at the daughter he didn't know he had. Likewise I felt confused about the character of Curtis. I know that larger-than-life people can be complex and both good and bad, but in this movie it was hard to figure out which was which. Near the end of the movie Curtis steals a song that he has no reason to steal, and then he is blackmailed into giving it back. Very strange!The nicest surprise of this film, and the character who most evoked Motown, was Eddie Murphy as the irrepressible soul singer Jimmy Early. I felt another brief and funny nostalgic moment during a glimpse of a Jackson Five-like group. Sometimes this film went into operatic mode, with sung dialogue and arguments, which I enjoyed.",3,Not a Supreme movie,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,2424,"['understand', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'groups', 'Supremes', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'bio', 'still', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'Dreams', 'resembled', 'inspiration', 'Yes', 'glamour', 'was', 'there', 'music', 'was', 'fine', 'did', 'not', 'evoke', 'Supremes', 'even', 'Motown.Beyonce', 'Deena', 'role', 'lead', 'singer', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'role', 'character', 'singer', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Effie', 'supposed', 'represent', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'character', 'singing', 'drive', 'movie', 'Effie', 'brother', 'C.C', 'songwriter', 'group', 'cranking', 'out', 'one', 'hit', 'another.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'stage', 'version', 'Dreamgirls', 'movie', 'felt', 'confused', 'firing', 'subsequent', 'alienation', 'Effie', 'Deena', 'began', 'sleeping', 'Effie', 'fiance', 'Curtis', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'group', 'manager', 'Effie', 'was', 'missing', 'rehearsals', 'arriving', 'late', 'making', 'trouble', 'due', 'medical', 'problems', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Curtis', 'entire', 'group', 'who', 'called', 'family', 'Effie', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'get', 'lost', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'Dreams', 'go', 'great', 'success', 'Effie', 'single', 'mom', 'welfare', 'not', 'even', 'Effie', 'brother', 'kid', 'Then', 'when', 'Effie', 'suddenly', 'back', 'music', 'scene', 'brother', 'written', 'sure-fire', 'hit', 'song', 'only', 'can', 'sing', 'last', 'five', 'cruel', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'suddenly', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'Effie', 'were', 'fault', 'Curtis', 'not', 'anyone', 'else', 'What', 'final', 'song', 'Effie', 'joining', 'Dreams', 'once', 'again', 'odd', 'scene', 'Curtis', 'standing', 'aisle', 'staring', 'perplexed', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Likewise', 'felt', 'confused', 'character', 'Curtis', 'know', 'larger-than-life', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'complex', 'good', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'Curtis', 'song', 'reason', 'steal', 'then', 'blackmailed', 'giving', 'back', 'Very', 'strange', 'nicest', 'surprise', 'film', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'evoked', 'Motown', 'was', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'irrepressible', 'soul', 'singer', 'Jimmy', 'Early', 'felt', 'brief', 'funny', 'nostalgic', 'moment', 'glimpse', 'Jackson', 'Five-like', 'group', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'went', 'operatic', 'mode', 'sung', 'dialogue', 'arguments', 'enjoyed']",N/A

I say finally because ever since ""Dreamgirls"" debut on Broadway in 1981, starring Jennifer Holiday, there has been talk that this fine show would make it to the big screen. In 2006 ""Dreamgirls"" premiered at the boxoffice to audience and critical acclaim.I first saw most of the cast of ""Dreamgirls"" when they promoted the film on ""Oprah"" and I knew it was going to be a huge hit. Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx star in this film based on the lives of 1960's girl group The Supremes. However, it is Jennifer Hudson's searing performance of Ellfie that steals the film with Oprah telling her that watching Hudson's performance is like ""a religious experience"".  She plays the role based on the life of Florence ballard, the Supreme who became an alcoholic and died broke. Beyonce is also great in the Diana Ross role. Everything from the beautiful music to the costumes is excellent, and you do not have to be a fan of Broadway musicals to enjoy this film. ""Dreamgirls"" is an entertaining movie for everyone who has ever had a dream of making it big in show business.

1061925,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000O174CM,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[3, 4]","I'm sick and tired of hearing people babble on about how the ""Dreamgirls"" movie is a ""blatant ripoff"" about Motown and the Supremes. If anyone who had the slightest bit of knowledge of the history of this Broadway musical, then they already KNEW what it was all about. Just what were you expecting when it was made into a film? If you were aware of the subject matter already, then you SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO SEE IT - PERIOD.The late Michael Bennett, who created the original Broadway production, said himself in 1981 that the musical was BASED on the Supremes story, but it was not necessarily the SAME story. I was fortunate enough to see the original stage production back in the day and being a fan of Motown music, I KEPT THAT FACT IN MIND. If you had allowed yourself to do the same, whether or not you had seen the Broadway musical, then you might have enjoyed the film a little bit more. The screenplay very much plays on the similarities between what really happened with Motown, and I admit it annoyed me to a small degree (especially the knockoff Jackson 5 group and the Beyonce-as-Deena montage - felt like I was watching ""Mahogany""), because the Broadway production didn't do this.Deena's character was rewritten from being the bitchy Diana Ross-like lead singing diva in the Broadway production to being another innocent, sympathetic victim of Curtis' power plays - perhaps to not make Beyonce (who tried hard to channel Ross here) look like the bad guy to her fans. But I can't see how anyone could discount the outstanding performances of Eddie Murphy as a fading, womanizing, drug-using R&B; star, Jimmy ""Thunder"" Early (who seems to be a composite character of James Brown, Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson) and Jennifer Hudson as the strongwilled and talented but wronged diva Effie White (whose character was based on original Supreme Florence Ballard) - they deserved every accolade they've received for their roles.This is clearly Eddie Murphy's finest role, and shows that he can also excel in drama as well as he does in comedy. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson came to the public's attention through the TV talent show, ""American Idol"" a couple of years back and she is excellent as Effie. Her rendition of ""Dreamgirls'"" signature song, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" is certain to make her as famous as the original Effie in the Broadway production, powerhouse vocalist Jennifer Holliday, made her.Anika Noni Rose was also a highlight, and I just loved her bubbly enthusiasm in the role of Lorrell. It was good to see Danny Glover on screen again, and Keith Robinson as C.C. White was a delight. Jamie Foxx (playing the villain in the role of Curtis Taylor, Jr.), and Beyonce (who really can't act - just because she's been cast in movies doesn't mean she has the skills) are just there - nothing really special in their performances and in all honesty, anyone else could have played their parts and we would not have been deprived of anything.I did enjoy this movie, and yes, it has its flaws. But I personally don't give two hoots in hell what Berry Gordy, Jr., Smokey Robinson, and Diana Ross say. If they are so concerned with accuracy and really want folks to know the TRUE story of Motown, warts and all, perhaps they should all work on something that will set the record straight, once and for all, to counter what was presented in ""Dreamgirls"" - instead of whining ""That's not how it was"" and writing tired books that sugarcoat the whole experience. But it's a sure bet that a tell-all will never come to pass, because among other things, it means Gordy and his greediness would have to be revealed as the primary reasons why so many acts from Motown's golden years died in poverty.",4,Enjoy it for what it is,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,3716,"[""'m"", 'sick', 'tired', 'hearing', 'people', 'babble', 'how', 'Dreamgirls', 'movie', 'blatant', 'ripoff', 'Motown', 'Supremes', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'slightest', 'bit', 'knowledge', 'history', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'then', 'already', 'KNEW', 'what', 'was', 'Just', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'were', 'aware', 'subject', 'matter', 'already', 'then', 'SHOULD', 'NOT', 'HAVE', 'BOTHERED', 'TO', 'SEE', 'IT', 'PERIOD.The', 'late', 'Michael', 'Bennett', 'who', 'created', 'original', 'Broadway', 'production', 'said', '1981', 'musical', 'was', 'BASED', 'Supremes', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'SAME', 'story', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'back', 'day', 'being', 'fan', 'Motown', 'music', 'KEPT', 'FACT', 'IN', 'MIND', 'had', 'allowed', 'do', 'same', 'not', 'had', 'seen', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'screenplay', 'very', 'much', 'plays', 'similarities', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Motown', 'admit', 'annoyed', 'small', 'degree', 'especially', 'knockoff', 'Jackson', '5', 'group', 'Beyonce-as-Deena', 'montage', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Mahogany', 'Broadway', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'this.Deena', 'character', 'was', 'rewritten', 'being', 'bitchy', 'Diana', 'Ross-like', 'lead', 'singing', 'diva', 'Broadway', 'production', 'being', 'innocent', 'sympathetic', 'victim', 'Curtis', 'power', 'plays', 'perhaps', 'not', 'make', 'Beyonce', 'who', 'tried', 'hard', 'channel', 'Ross', 'here', 'look', 'bad', 'guy', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'discount', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'fading', 'womanizing', 'drug-using', 'R', 'B', 'star', 'Jimmy', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'who', 'be', 'composite', 'character', 'James', 'Brown', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'strongwilled', 'talented', 'wronged', 'diva', 'Effie', 'White', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'Supreme', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'deserved', 'accolade', ""'ve"", 'received', 'roles.This', 'clearly', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'finest', 'role', 'can', 'also', 'excel', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'Newcomer', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'came', 'public', 'attention', 'TV', 'talent', 'show', 'American', 'Idol', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'excellent', 'Effie', 'rendition', 'Dreamgirls', 'signature', 'song', 'Am', 'Telling', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Going', 'certain', 'make', 'as', 'famous', 'original', 'Effie', 'Broadway', 'production', 'powerhouse', 'vocalist', 'Jennifer', 'Holliday', 'made', 'her.Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'was', 'also', 'highlight', 'just', 'loved', 'bubbly', 'enthusiasm', 'role', 'Lorrell', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'screen', 'again', 'Keith', 'Robinson', 'C.C', 'White', 'was', 'delight', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'playing', 'villain', 'role', 'Curtis', 'Taylor', 'Jr.', 'Beyonce', 'who', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'just', 'been', 'cast', 'movies', ""n't"", 'mean', 'skills', 'are', 'just', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'performances', 'honesty', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'parts', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'deprived', 'anything.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'yes', 'flaws', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'two', 'hoots', 'hell', 'what', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'Jr.', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'concerned', 'accuracy', 'really', 'want', 'folks', 'know', 'TRUE', 'story', 'Motown', 'warts', 'perhaps', 'should', 'work', 'something', 'will', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'once', 'counter', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'Dreamgirls', 'instead', 'whining', 'not', 'how', 'was', 'writing', 'tired', 'books', 'sugarcoat', 'whole', 'experience', 'sure', 'bet', 'tell-all', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'pass', 'other', 'things', 'Gordy', 'greediness', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'revealed', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'acts', 'Motown', 'golden', 'years', 'died', 'poverty']",N/A

1061930,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000O174CM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","Two things came to mind immediately after viewing ""Dreamgirls"", the new film based on the Broadway play starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce' Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson.1. This is a good film getting too much hype.2. Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination.Don't get me wrong. ""Dreamgirls"" is a good film. It moves fast, entertains, is filled with good music and a couple of good performances. But it is not a great film. Because of all of the hype, people will go to see this film expecting to be blown away. When what they actually experience is only a `good' film, they will feel let down. If people went in with lower expectations, they would probably enjoy the film more.Eddie Murphy plays James ""Thunder"" Early, a `James Brown'-esque singer. Now, you may think, as I did ""Wow, he's just going to use the impersonation he did so well during his years on `Saturday Night Live'."" But the role is so much more than that and Murphy is able to show the true range of his acting ability.In case you have been living in a cave: ""Dreamgirls"" is a fictionalized look at the early career of Diana Ross and the Supremes. The Dreamettes, a local girl group from Detroit, enters a talent contest and catches the eye of Curtis (Jamie Foxx), a used car salesman desperate to become a music producer. He watches the group led by Effie (Jennifer Hudson), backed by Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), sing up a storm and bring the crowd to their feet. Some quick negotiations with Early's manager (Danny Glover) lead to a gig singing backup for the famous musician. Now, Curtis needs to introduce himself to the Dreamettes. After helping Early become a bigger, breakout star, Curtis decides to let the Dreams tour on their own. But he wants Deena to front the group, shocking everyone including Effie, Curtis' girlfriend. Everyone agrees, for the good of the group. As the Dreams become more famous, Effie becomes more resentful and eventually parts ways with the group. Curtis has no trouble finding a replacement and the group soon becomes `Deena and the Dreams'. Curtis has even bigger dreams; a record label, movies, television. And he will do anything to get there. Deena begins to notice some of these bad things and starts to look for a way out.Written and directed by Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"", ""Kinsey"") and adapted from the play by Michael Bennett, ""Dreamgirls"" is an old-fashioned Hollywood musical. It is nice to see this and see a good example of the genre. But this film would never have happened without the success of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"".Condon, who helped adopt ""Chicago"" for the big screen, has done a good job of integrating musical numbers into the story. This is the type of musical where the characters spontaneously burst into song, which become extensions of the character's dialogue, making the transition virtually seamless. I have never seen the play, but I was surprised by the lack of choreographed dancers. There are only two points when songs are accompanied by old fashioned production numbers including choreographed dancers, and these are fun to watch. But the majority of the songs are performed by one person or a small group.I was also surprised by how much of the story of the Supremes is ""borrowed"" for the film. From what I know, they follow the story pretty faithfully, changing names and places, until the end. The ending is significantly changed and I am not sure why as it robs the film of a lot of dramatic potential.Condon does a great job of bringing together all of the production elements to successfully evoke the periods of the film. As the Dreams rise through the ranks, they play the fancy nightclubs of the 50s up through the discos of the 70s. As their fortunes rise, the d&eacute;cor of their personal surroundings becomes more and more elaborate and help evoke the taste of the era.Jamie Foxx plays Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like Svengali who attaches himself to Deena and the Dreams and strives to help them achieve fame. Foxx's performance is one note and lackluster. The character's obsession is aided by this same one note nature, showing another example of his drive, but Foxx delivers practically every line in the same voice, showing little, if any emotion. A couple of times Curtis is seen staring at Deena and Effie, looking through them, in an effort to show his feelings towards them. Even towards the end, when things start to crumble, he shows little emotion.Beyonce Knowles can sing, but she is a weak actress. She is better suited to small roles in films like ""Austin Powers"" and ""The Pink Panther"", films that allow her to speak as little dialogue as possible and use her required music video to provide promotion on MTV. She simply isn't a good enough actress to make Deena a real person. It also doesn't help that Deena is made such an understanding and nice person. She supports Effie and doesn't want to lead the group, she has to be persuaded. Because the film makes her so saintly, she never has an opportunity to show any dramatic force.Eddie Murphy's performance as James ""Thunder"" Early is the best and most interesting in the film. As a well-known singer, he is also a well-known womanizer and agrees to let the Dreams do backup because he is interested in Lorrell (Leal), the youngest member of the group. Murphy brilliantly brings this character trait to life. As soon as they hit the road, he begins the seduction and quickly realizes it will take a little longer than planned. Over the course of the film, Early changes, grows and regresses along with the rest of the industry. Murphy makes all of these character changes, good and bad, believable and real.This is something I never thought I would say but Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination for the role.Jennifer Hudson plays Effie, the discarded member of the group, the fourth Dream. Her character is the best singer and her story is the most dramatic, so she naturally comes across as more interesting than Deena. Hudson does a very good job of showing Effie's talent, struggles and triumphs. Her show stopper number ""I Will Tell You I Am Not Going"" is also the most powerful and memorable song in the film. Because her performance is so good, it makes Beyonce's performance seem all the more weak. If you are a well-known performer and play the weaker member of the group, you need to be able to make the role resonate. Beyonce doesn't do that and every time Hudson appears on screen, we are reminded of that.Think about it. Beyonce is playing the self-acknowledged weaker singer of the group and the best song is performed by the best singer in the group. How does this help Beyonce exactly? Hudson wipes up the floor with her.""Dreamgirls"", despite the problems, is a fun film to watch.",4,"3 1/2 - Fun to watch, but mixed performances mar the film",1167782400,"01 3,

1061932,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000O174CM,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 2]","This is a great big blast of glitter and glitz, fun and entertaining. For those who haven't heard the plot a million times already, I'll recap. The Dreamettes, fronted by belter Effie (Jenifer Hudson, totally earning that Oscar) catch a lucky break and start working as singers for a fading James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy, a revelation as a mash-up of sixties soul singers from Wilson Picket to James Brown to Marvin Gaye). The ersatz Berry Gordy character Curtis Taylor Jr (a lackluster Jamie Foxx) decides to move the less powerful but prettier Deena Jones (Beyonce, giving an eerie Diana Ross impersonation) to the front of the newly christened Dreams. As the sixties and seventies cascade about them, the conflict between these four drives the movie and the music.Fortunately for ""Dreamgirls,"" the musical performances carry the day. I don't find many of the songs here to be all that memorable - other than ""One Night Only"" and ""Cadillac Car,"" I have a hard time humming any of these once the DVD is over. But to see Hudson bring the house down with her version of the original centerpiece ""And I'm Telling You Now I'm Not Going"" is an astonishing career-maker of a scene, and Murphy steals the show just about every number he does. (As for all the Theatre Snobs decrying Hudson Vs Holliday, did you ever stop to think about how few people actually SAW the play with Holliday in it? Like, over 20 years ago? It's like saying the current stage play of ""Mary Poppins"" will never be right because Julie Andrews isn't in it.)THAT grouse aside, ""Dreamgirls"" is not without its flaws. As previously stated, Jamie Foxx seems miscast here. While Murphy is brilliant, the wide range of styles he's run through (from James Brown bark to Marvin Gaye 'message song' croon) seems unwieldy for the character. Anika Noni Rose is bubbly and fun, but gets little by way of memorable scenes. With those out of the way, I still enjoyed this. Watch for the cameos from John Lithgow and Loretta Devine (Lorrell Robinson in the original Broadway production) as the jazz singer in the wake scene.I am happy to see ""Dreamgirls"" as the success it's become. It gives me hope that the Movie Musical genre that has been given shots in the arm via ""Moulin Rouge!

This award-winning film featured a cast that pulled out all the stops to out on a great cinematic classic. I saw this film twice and the music just stuck with me for ever and I still have the tunes playing wherever I go. Beyonce Knowles who played Deena Jones was great, especially towards the end of the film where she tires of being controlled by Curtis Taylro, played by Oscar Winner, Jaime Foxx. Eddie Murphy was fantastic as James ""Thunder"" Early, who reminded me a lot of the late James Brown. Akina Rose electrifies as Lorell Robinson,. But, without a doubt, Jennifer Hudson really shines as Effie White and deserved her Golden Globe/Oscar victories for her role, especially when belting out the show's signature song, ""And I Am Telling You, I'm Not Going.""  It is remeniscent to Barbra Streisand's performances of ""I'm The Greatest Star"" from FUNNY GIRL and ""How Lucky Can You Get"" from FUNNY LADY.I urge all of you to pick up a copy of DREAMGIRLS to see this gem. It is indeed a show stopping event and one of the best films to come from Broadway to Hollywood. It joins the many movie musical classics such as FUNNY GIRL, MY FAIR LADY, GREASE, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, WEST SIDE STORY, THE WIZ, ANNIE, HELLO DOLLY, EVITA, and many other hits.

Like the songs in ""Grace of My Heart"" which is clearly based on the career of Carole King, the soundtrack music of ""Dreamgirls,"" good as it is, can't match the power of the real Motown sound. Actually the film's musical numbers hardly sound like Motown Sound, but still some of them are real showstoppers thanks to the film's gifted stars, especially the dynamic singing voice of Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson.In ""Dreamgirls"" you should not expect much from the story, which runs a familiar course of superstars or celebrities, with the meteoric rise of three R&B; singers (played by Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose) to the fame and their subsequent troubles and ego-clashing within the members and their shrewd, business-minded producer/manager (Jamie Foxx). It is a same old story you have heard somewhere else in gossip magazines. .Once the three girls' dreams come true with the glitter of showbiz, it takes the center of their lives, and once it does, none of the characters are allowed to breathe much. Anika Noni Rose and Danny Glover are not given enough time for their characters, and even the role of Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is not fleshed out satisfactorily. Eddie Murphy is outstanding as a popular singer and ladies' man named James ""Thunder"" Early (with a haircut like Little Richard's), but there is nothing new in Thunder's story about his love affair and fading stardom.Still I enjoyed watching ""Dreamgirls"". I know it has lots of shortcomings, and I hear the complaints from the fans of the original stage (which I haven't seen). Yes, I know. Perhaps the number of the film's shortcomings depends on each viewer's taste or expectations, and I liked the filmed version of ""Dreamgirls"" for what it is. I like it for its entertainment values such as gorgeous costumes, beautifully staged live scenes and cinematography, plus the powerful, emotionally-charged songs by Jennifer Hudson, all of which compensate for the lack of a better story.",4,It's Wonderful Entertainment,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,2134,"['Dreamgirls', 'originally', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'production', '1980s', 'lavish', 'musical', 'inspired', 'history', 'Motown', 'super', 'group', 'Supremes', 'songs', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'clearly', 'based', 'career', 'Carole', 'King', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Dreamgirls', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'power', 'real', 'Motown', 'sound', 'Actually', 'film', 'musical', 'numbers', 'hardly', 'sound', 'Motown', 'Sound', 'still', 'are', 'real', 'showstoppers', 'thanks', 'film', 'gifted', 'stars', 'especially', 'dynamic', 'singing', 'voice', 'Oscar-winner', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson.In', 'Dreamgirls', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'story', 'familiar', 'course', 'superstars', 'celebrities', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'three', 'R', 'B', 'singers', 'played', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'fame', 'subsequent', 'troubles', 'ego-clashing', 'members', 'shrewd', 'business-minded', 'producer/manager', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'have', 'heard', 'somewhere', 'else', 'gossip', 'magazines', '.Once', 'three', 'girls', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'glitter', 'showbiz', 'center', 'lives', 'once', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'breathe', 'much', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'characters', 'even', 'role', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'satisfactorily', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'outstanding', 'popular', 'singer', 'ladies', 'man', 'named', 'James', 'Thunder', 'Early', 'haircut', 'Little', 'Richard', 'nothing', 'new', 'Thunder', 'story', 'love', 'affair', 'fading', 'stardom.Still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Dreamgirls', 'know', 'lots', 'shortcomings', 'hear', 'complaints', 'fans', 'original', 'stage', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Yes', 'know', 'Perhaps', 'number', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'viewer', 'taste', 'expectations', 'liked', 'filmed', 'version', 'Dreamgirls', 'what', 'like', 'entertainment', 'values', 'such', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'live', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'powerful', 'emotionally-charged', 'songs', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'compensate', 'lack', 'better', 'story']",N/A

What made me decide to actually see this movie at the spur of the moment was the knowtion of seeing Eddie Murphy play a dramatic role.  I had heard so much about his performance in the movie, which does deserve Oscar attention.  I also heard about Jennifer Hudson's performance as well and had already downloaded her spine-chilling version of ""And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)"".  She practically made that song her's.I was thoroughly impressed with all aspects of this film.  Some people have actually complained about the film's length.  To me, the film's length was a necessary asset to the story.  Also, the acting was top-notch.  It's been a long time since I've seen a musical that not only shines in the music but, also shine in the acting as well.I recommend everyone to see this film.  I will definitely see it again before it goes to DVD.

It's a fast-paced ala biopic of The Supremes. It's a good story about friendship, trust, and faith between the three/four dream girls through the years. I personally like Eddie Murphy the most because his performance is simply sassy and funny, and at the same time there was emotion to the more dramatic moments at his character's downfall. Jamie Foxx is very convincing as a no-good all manipulative manager. I find that while there is plenty of singing photo shoots scenes for Beyonce to work with and she was fabulous in them, I was craving for more dramatic scenes for her character. Considered that she's not a singer turned actress, and it's her first starring role, she did struck gold. However it's Jennifer Hudson the less attractive of the dream girls who had the juiciest and scene-stealing part to work with. As a newcomer, she was best when she gets to sing her emotions out. A very strong moment was when she gets to do that number called I am Telling You I am Not Going. I have a feeling either Murphy or her will get an Oscar nod in the supporting category.

Toia,"[11, 16]","I think that anyone who believes this movie to be ""hilarious"" or Hudson's performance ""overrated"" and ""over-the-top"" in her singing just doesn't like musicals.  Or perhaps doesn't like an all black cast (I am not black) or is too young to understand the 60's world of music and payola and backstabbing.While touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by The Supremes with Diana Ross as its lead singer, it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others.  The key words here are ""loosely based"" on the story of the Supremes.  Why people, including Ross herself don't get that is beyond me!Over the top? If anyone saw the original play with Jennifer Holliday (I did see it) then you don't know the meaning of over the top.  That character was supposed to be that way and Hudson did a wonderful job of that.  Her performance overrated?  Hogwash!  She deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress. Murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever! Beyonce's performance was good but not great.  This was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play. This was Beyonce's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the ""right"" role.  This was not the right role for her in my opinion.  Hudson's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the ""supporting actress"" win.  Though as lead actress she probably would have lost.You people out there, don't take my word for this movie's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was ""white-washed,"" no pun intended.  Or don't think its a bad movie like some other critics here.  YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.  I hope and think  that you won't be disappointed. There are some more than subtle references to The Supremes and Diana Ross especially in some of the costumes, Beyonce's images and album covers (CD covers for you youngsters)BUT only die hard fans of the Supremes and people who were there at that time would know that.

A film which is loosely based on the Motown Story and particularly the group The Supremes. This reviewer enjoyed the film, however, it is one of those films where one viewing is enough and would not want to see again. The production values and direction are excellent along with the music and their set pieces are first rate.  However, the story is predictable following a template of a typical rock'n'roll rags to riches to break-up plotline.  The audience can predict what is going to happen after each scene in the film and what characters are going to do what. Eddie Murphy should have won the Best Supporting actor in the film instead of Alan Arkin's performance in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. However, perhaps the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was in a way gave it to Alan Arkin because of his past work (and he is getting on in his years).  Also, Eddie Murphy released NORBIT during the voting period of the Academy Awards and everyone forgot about his performance in this film.

It's just your typical been-done-before Hollywood film, only this time it's done with a big famous soundtrack and storyline. That only partly makes the film a success.The first hour or so of the film is dedicated to slowly revealing all the characters that we will be watching for the next 2+ hours. Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, and even Steve Urkle is in there for a second at the beginning (that's when you know they're pulling all the stops).Although there are some dazzling shots and some amazing singing performances, most of the acting is lackluster, except for Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy occasionally, though he's just playing the Eddie Murphy we've always seen. For some reason when he plays the same character in a dramatic film, it earns him an Oscar nomination. That speaks more to the low amount of respect given to comedic actors in comedies than to Eddie Murphy's acting. Jennifer Hudson is not an actress, except when she's singing. Maybe they should have invented a new category for her called ""Best Supporting Singer"" because during straight acting scenes she was stunningly blank and disappointing.The film itself drags quite a bit, even with the four or five montages used to show the singers' rise to the top. It all gets a bit repetitive and boring, although the second hour is much more exciting and entertaining than the first.Overall, like I said, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one. And it's definitely not a Best Picture contender... I don't know how that idea got sold to Academy Award nominators. Check it out if you love musicals or if you love watching pop-singers pretend to act in between singing and dancing.
