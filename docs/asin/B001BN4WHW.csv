The rep's response was largely that he charges so little because he sells seconds. He was very difficult!I then bought a roughly $30 copy from Amazon, which made up the $20 difference.

Duryea ""Justin Kipper""","[77, 80]","With so many recent releases being comprised of incomplete and altered versions of our beloved classic TV shows, it's smart to wait and decide to purchase (or not) well after the release date. It seems that the firestorms of complaint following releases such as THE FUGITIVE SEASON TWO VOL. ONE have been noticed, at least for the time being. I must say that THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES OFFICIAL SECOND SEASON set is of far higher quality than I expected. Yes, this is the complete second season, with excellent picture (a bit grainy at times, but overall superb) and sound transfers of every episode...but most important, the episodes are complete and with the original music as far as I can tell. It's nice to see a good bit of bonus material here too; the original sponsor opening and closings are great segments that have been lost to time over the years. Some of the closing segments are continuations of the episodes themselves and extend the episodes by several minutes; for example, the third episode, ""Granny's Garden"", runs 29 minutes with the sponsor segments added back in. This is nice stuff, and really adds to the value!Don't hesitate to order this fine DVD set. Just as companies should be boycotted when they mangle releases, they should also be praised and supported when they make the effort to do things right.

Schoonover,"[1, 1]","The Beverly Hillbillies Official Second Season DVD is another wonderful set of these classic episodes of the CBS TV series that ran for nine seasons from 1962-1971. This set features the complete 36 episodes of the second season with all the sponsorships and cast commercials that were a part of this phenomenal TV series. Not only that, those sponsorships and cast commercials are very much historic and for those discovering these episodes for the first time in their original way, like myself, they will get a very unique experience.Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD both do a wonderful job on this set of 36 episodes from the 1963-1964 TV season. The episodes of the series look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown. They are all here in their original glory.Each and every episode has been digitally remastered from original negatives and from other sources that both Paramount and CBS DVD had obtained to give us a superb and superior quality set that also makes mincemeat out of any of those public domain DVD sets that came out after the DVD boom took off. Each and everything about this classic show is all there the way that they were originally shown and had been rerun in syndication over the many years.The original theme song, The Ballad Of Jed Clampett, is included on the episodes of this series. As stated, you also have the sponsorships and the cast commercials that were originally with the show when first run. You do have the option to watch the episodes with or without the sponsorships or cast commercials, but I have been watching these episodes with the sponsorships and cast commercials for nostalgic and historic purposes. This is one of the best sets of this classic TV show that has been released on DVD with the Official Third Season and MPI's Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2 and it's companion DVD MPI's Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Christmas Collection alongside this.Overall, this is one of the finest collections of The Beverly Hillbillies TV series that nobody who loves this show should be without.

The ""fish out of water"" clan included easy going matriarch JED CLAMPETT (BUDDY EBSON), excitable, vittles rustling GRANNY (scene stealer IRENE RYAN), critter lovin' tomboy ELLY MAE (DONNA DOUGLAS), and sixth grade educated bo-hunk JETHRO (MAX BAER); collectively, they misunderstood virtually everything from doorbells and pool tables to scuba diving and health clubs. Money mad banker MILBURN DRYSDALE (RAYMOND BAILEY) stopped at nothing to keep the Clampett fortune secure in his vault, assisted by his long suffering secretary JANE HATHAWAY (NANCY KULP), a prim and proper OLIVE OYL who held an unrequited torch for JETHRO.

1172555,ARTJT8SZV2CQJ,B001BN4WHW,KS62,"[33, 37]","The second season set from Paramount is sooooo much improved over the MPI Volumes 1 & 2. I can't believe i had something nice to say regarding Paramount.I never thought i would see it this clear and that is viewing it on my large screen LCD tv which sometimes makes older shows seem a little more off or grainey.  I also tested a disc in my player hooked up to my 36 inch glass screen tv and it seems nice and clear without any real noticeable grainey quality.This is such an improvement over MPI and those horrible other sets that were out there prior. This was one of my very favorite shows growing up. I was so sad to think all we'd ever see are episodes in the previous quality of the MPI sets.While the episodes are remastered the opening and closing credits are not. One feature is the option to view each episode with or without the original sponsor opening and closing. The sponsor opening extends the scene with all four driving in the truck while passing a truck or billboard with the Winston cigarettes or Kelloggs cereals logo on it. It also has extended theme lyrics mentioning one of the two sponsors. The closing is actually a short scene wrapping up the episode while having the Clampetts using one of the products in the scene. Unfortunately the sponsor closings are not remastered.As far as the music, it plays the original theme song (with original vocalist) exactly as how we remembered it. Also i noticed that the regular intro music you would hear in the beginning of a scene is also the original music. So maybe the music that is altered pertains to performances of songs on the show or something along that line.Seven of the episodes in season 2 have Sharon Tate wearing a black wig playing the part of Janet Trego, a bank secretary. In one episode ""The Garden Party"" she plays a guest at the party who dances with Jethro with her own blonde hair. She also appears in the ""Elly Starts To School"" episode as a ""blink and you'll miss her"" character named Mary.

1172568,A3OIH43KWWBNUP,B001BN4WHW,smuthdude,"[21, 25]","Here's the deal on the ""official"" second season release.  Paramount owns the distribution rights to the entire ""Beverly Hillbillies"" series. It holds control over the 35mm network prints of the series that were used in the 1960's.  Hillbillies creator Paul Henning also legally owned the rights to the first 55 episodes of the series.  That's all of season one and most of season two.  About two years ago, his estate released those 55 episodes in two volumes. Unfortunately, because Paramount owns the negatives and master prints, MPI video(which distributed the Henning sets) only had access to film prints which were struck decades ago. These episodes contained original network sponsor sketches, etc, but they were grainy and barely watchable. Paramount apparently figured that most fans who purchased volume one of the Henning series, wouldn't be motivated to purchase it again.  So they began with the ""official"" second season, with intentions of re-releasing season one at a later date (like they did with I Love Lucy). So, what are you getting by purchasing this ""official"" season?  First, you'll get *all* the season two episodes, remastered from the original film prints. That means no scratches, lines, debris or picture shifting.  Paramount is excellent in restoring picture quality.  However, it remains to be seen whether Paramount will use all the original music.  Much of it was composed by Paul Henning, & there may have been some royalty issues. Paramount has been hesitant to use incidental music that it doesn't hold legal right to in its DVD releases.  Also, the artwork on season two is horrendous.Season two spanned 1963-64. The cover photo is from a 1969 episode (Jethro has sideburns for cying out loud!).

1172570,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001BN4WHW,trebe,"[3, 5]","Like Jed Clampett, writer Paul Henning unexpectedly struck it rich, when he created The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-71), a program that was a ratings winner for nearly a decade, and spawned Henning's rural based spinoffs Petticoat Junction (1963-70), and Green Acres (1965-1971).The Beverly Hillbillies took an interesting premise, and executed it brilliantly, transporting a family of hillbillies from their mountain cabin, to a mansion in Beverly Hills.  The resulting culture clash produced high hilarity for many years, and the series was still going strong when CBS cancelled it in 1971.After being around in the first season, Cousin Pearl (Bea Benaderet) and her daughter Jethrine have gone back home.  Season Two finds the Clampetts on their own and doing well in their spacious mansion, that is also home to pet hound dog Duke, and Elly May's (Donna Douglas) many critters.  Pearl's son Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) has remained with his uncle, and is busy with school, chores, and trying to pick up girls (literally).  While still planning to become a brain surgeon, Jethro is often drawn to other vocations.  Levelheaded Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen) is unphased by almost anything that happens in the modern world.  His sage wisdom and steady hand keeps the clan together.  Jed may be a ""grizzled old mountain goat"", but he still has an interest in courting the ladies.  Granny (Irene Ryan) remains as volatile and cantankerous as ever, railing against the wanton ways of city folk, and whatever else she finds offensive.  Her pastimes include cooking, making tonic, and doctoring.The buffer between the Clampett's bucolic bliss and modern everyday life is often banker Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey), and his studious secretary Jane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp).  Drysdale, the president of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills, will do almost anything to keep Jed's millions in his bank, including having his biggest depositor as his next door neighbor, much to the consternation of his society conscious wife Margaret (Harriet MacGibbon).  In the second season the focus is on the four hillbillies, the Drysdales, and Miss Jane.  Once the personalities of these core characters was firmly established, they remained essentially the same throughout the series.Image quality and sound quality is quite good, but abrupt or messy edits make is clear that material has been cut from various episodes.  It's regrettable, but something that has unfortunately become all too common.  Television in those days was something of a grind, as season two contains 36 episodes on five discs.  To help ""fill out"" the season, the stories often featured guest stars that appear in a couple of episodes, leisurely stretching things out.  Lafe Crick (Peter Whitney), a visitor from back home is featured in multiple episodes, always scheming to get Jed's money.The season contains some memorable stories and funny gags.  One episode involves an escaped kangaroo that Granny believes is a giant jackrabbit.  She even has a boxing match with the marsupial, in an attempt to capture it.  In ""The Clampetts Go Hollywood"", Jethro emulates Marlon Brando, and Granny and Elly also have dreams of getting into the movies, until Jed shows up in a glitter suit and a double neck guitar, to show them how foolish they look.  In another episode, Granny takes a wild ride in the family truck, trying to learn how to drive, as the Clampett mansion is mistaken for a mental asylum.  The mysterious crustaceans known as crawdads create a stir on Wall Street and also among some of the bank's investors.  Jed becomes the owner of a boutique, and later sends Elly May there to learn more about being a lady.  Granny gets hooked on watching TV, and predicts the weather using a ladybug, while Jethro finds academic success, managing to complete the sixth grade in just twelve years.Perhaps the most ruckus is stirred up when Mr. Drysdale has a cabin installed in the Clampett's backyard as a birthday present for Granny.  The Clampetts are mistaken for servants working in serfdom, in an example of pure comic madness.  The appearance of the cabin is a stroke of pure genius, creating a whole new set of comedic opportunities, as the season winds down with banker Drysdale chained to the shack to keep it from being torn down.One of the true strengths of the series is a rock solid creative team that soon became masters at this particular brand of humor.  Paul Henning and Mark Tuttle wrote almost of the episodes in season two, with Richard Whorf doing most of the directing.  The humor is almost never crude, and if fact was often quite sophisticated, often turning on a word with a dual meaning, or perhaps a name or a phrase that is misunderstood.  It goes without saying that the show's fantastic cast was also a major contributor to the success of the series.  Everyone is outstanding, but Irene Ryan, Raymond Bailey, Nancy Kulp, and Buddy Ebsen (Barnaby Jones), are particularly outstanding.In an interesting but very sad note, Sharon Tate (The Wrecking Crew) appears as Janet Trego, a secretary at the Commerce Bank who assists Jane Hathaway.  Tate, who would later marry director Roman Polanski, was tragically murdered while pregnant, by the Manson family in 1969.  Janet is one of Jethro's early love interests, and most of her appearances in the series, occur during this season.Although many critics panned the series, The Beverly Hillbillies became one of the most popular TV comedies ever, cleverly poking fun at various facets of modern culture.  For those unfamiliar with the 60's rural comedy genre, this is a fine place to start.  Unfortunately most of the cast and creative team have passed on, but this set serves as a warm remembrance of that very special period in time.",4,the Clampetts get cozy in the 90210...,1297468800,"02

1172571,A1LW8UBZIZHSAH,B001BN4WHW,vikingfuneral,"[19, 23]","Despite one serious flaw (discussed below), this set is well worth buying and should be supported wholeheartedly by all BH fans.  We vote for a product (whether good or bad) by purchasing it, which we hope encourages the bigwigs to continue to produce it.  There are nine seasons of this show, all of which deserve to be released on DVD, so we have a long way to go.  We don't want this show to suffer the fate of ""Green Acres"" (which the bigwigs stopped releasing after three of six seasons, presumably due to lack of sales).  So buy it not only for its own sake and the enjoyment you will surely derive from owning it, but also as an investment in the future release of the other seasons in the series.This show is a true classic, one of the all time greats.  It holds the world's record for the most highly rated single episode of a sitcom ever broadcast (the episode entitled, ""The Giant Jackrabbit"", which is contained in this set).  The scripts are well written with witty and hilarious dialog and loveable characters.  This show is also genuinely FUNNY, with no hidden agenda to convert the viewer to leftist ideology like today's TV shows.  Also unlike today's TV, no attempt is made here to defile the innocence of any defenseless children who may be in the room, so you may safely allow your kids to view this show (and they will love it!).Even if you already own both volumes of the BH Ultimate Collection (which you should), this set is still worth having since it includes 17 episodes from season two not previously released.  The sound and picture quality of the episodes on this set is quite good.  The length of the episodes varies, the shortest being 25:07 and the longest coming in at 25:36.  Average length overall is 25:22, thus they can reasonably be thought to be free of edits.Extras include an Irene Ryan screen test/comparison with an excerpt from the pilot episode (1:16), ""The Stars Address is CBS"" 1963 fall preview spot (2:33, but you can tell it is edited, they cut out the Twilight Zone segment), a CBS network promo spot from 1963 (0:46), and an excerpt from a 1969 Paul Henning interview (2:39, also edited.  Part, though not all, of this interview is included in the BH Ultimate Collection Vol. II).But the greatest extra of all, and the one that makes this set so much worth buying, is the inclusion of some of the CAST COMMERCIALS!!  While the previously released BH Ultimate Collections also (fortunately) contained the cast commercials (some of which are duplicated here), this set also contains a few not found on the previous BHUC releases.  Also very convenient here is that the menu provides an option to watch each episode in it's entirety with the CC's integrated into the episode as they were intended to be seen, instead of just lumping them altogether at the end of disc 4 as with the previously released Ultimate Collection sets.On a brand new DVD release we already expect full, complete, unedited episodes (and factually speaking they are not truly complete unless they include the cast commercials), with good sound and picture quality.  That much is a given; anything less and the bigwigs can take a flying leap and forget about getting my hard earned money.  But the inclusion of the cast commercials takes any DVD set to a whole new level.  We've all seen these episodes before (in edited form) on network/cable TV, and we know how enjoyable they are.  But what you will never see on TV are these awesome Cast Commercials, which feature the characters from the show hawking the sponsor's products in very clever and witty spots which often continue the story line of the episodes.  These things are great!!  It really is all about the cast commercials, the inclusion of which here is the single best of many good reasons to buy this set.Which brings me to its one shameful flaw.  There are 36 episodes (the complete 2nd season) on this set, so there should have also been 36 cast commercials on it.  Instead, there are 11 missing, NINE of which (and here we come to the shameful part) are the Winston cigarette commercials (the commercials alternate each week between the show's two sponsors, Winston and Kelloggs).  Specifically, the ONLY Winston commercials present on this set are the SAME ONES that were already released on the BHUC sets (the fact that they are to be found on a competitor's set is doubtless the only reason they were included on this set).  So the powers that be deliberately cut out the remaining Winston commercials, apparently afraid that if they let us watch 40 year old Winston cigarette commercials we all will take up smoking (I don't smoke, never have, and no amount of persuasion is going to make me start.  I'm not nearly as weak minded as the bigwigs think I am).  Or more likely they just lack the moral courage to stand up and do the right thing for their customers and for posterity, it being easier to just cave in and sell out to the political correctness thought police (doesn't it make you feel good to know there are people out there smarter and better than we are, who care so much about our safety and welfare that they are willing to protect us from ourselves and make our decisions for us since we are all just a bunch of ignorant hicks and simplistic little children?).  They even went so far in their cowardice as to put little mandatory blurbs at the beginning of the Winston episodes (even the ones which have had the commercials cut out) warning about the dangerous evils of smoking (I agree that smoking is not the smartest way to spend your time or money, but that is still something adults have the right to decide for themselves, without holier-than-thou paternalistic busybodies attempting to dictate and force their personal preferences on the rest of us).Indeed a shame that what could have been a great release is marred by moral cowardice and lack of principle.  Even so, to have some cast commercials is better than to have none.  Hopefully future releases of BH will be at least as good as this one, if not better (i.e., they will include ALL the cast commercials, not just the ones that the political correctness stormtroopers deem ""acceptable"").  So buy it for yourself, for your friends and relatives, for anyone who needs a good laugh, or for anyone who could benefit from having their cultural horizons expanded.",5,A Great Show That Almost Had
