Sid Caesar was the pre-eminent genius of television. Those of us who have worked live shows understand the pressure and how television as an industry has developed ways of managing it and still creating an acceptable product. When Caesar was working nobody knew anything - not when it came to live tv, and how to produce the equivalent of a Broadway Show every week, but Sid sure did. He deeply understood what the audience of his era wanted - and drew around him the best writing staff, since the medium began and all the years since. If a show can be reduced to two words, then writing and performance were the key to Your Show of Shows. It was a magic time, which I fear we'll never see the like again. That's too bad. Once again we're wasting generational opportunities to learn from best of their time - but we just seem to let them slip away. We're so over concerned with the pop culture of that we forget before there was pop, there was real culture.",5,"How Do You Describe ""The Best""",1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1182,"['Having', 'lived', 'television', 'network', 'era', 'began', 'having', 'worked', 'medium', '38', 'years', 'would', 'hope', 'readers', 'will', 'simply', 'accept', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'forgive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'offer', 'proof', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'was', 'pre-eminent', 'genius', 'television', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'live', 'shows', 'understand', 'pressure', 'how', 'television', 'industry', 'developed', 'ways', 'managing', 'still', 'creating', 'acceptable', 'product', 'When', 'Caesar', 'was', 'working', 'nobody', 'knew', 'anything', 'not', 'when', 'came', 'live', 'tv', 'how', 'produce', 'equivalent', 'Broadway', 'Show', 'week', 'Sid', 'sure', 'did', 'deeply', 'understood', 'what', 'audience', 'era', 'wanted', 'drew', 'best', 'writing', 'staff', 'medium', 'began', 'years', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'two', 'words', 'then', 'writing', 'performance', 'were', 'key', 'Show', 'Shows', 'was', 'magic', 'time', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'like', 'again', 'too', 'bad', 'Once', 'again', ""'re"", 'wasting', 'generational', 'opportunities', 'learn', 'best', 'time', 'just', 'seem', 'let', 'slip', 'away', ""'re"", 'so', 'concerned', 'pop', 'culture', 'forget', 'was', 'pop', 'was', 'real', 'culture']",N/A

Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[3, 3]","The Sid Caeser show was one of the early sketch comedy programs and it paved the way for a lot of the movie and television comedy. Sid Caeser, a great comedian in his own right, was backed up by a talented cast who made the sketches come to life. He had a real ""dream team"" of writers which included Woody Allen and Mel Brooks and without them the humor wouldn't have taken off the way that it did.The sketches in this collection are not some of the ones you normally see in Sid's collections but they are good ones nonetheless.
