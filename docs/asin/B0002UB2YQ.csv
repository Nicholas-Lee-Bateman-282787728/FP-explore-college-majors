Very good start but falls to pieces by the end. On the positive side the effects are amazing. Blows away anything you'll see in any Matrix film. The cinematography is also top notch! With a strong enough plot this would have made an amazing movie.,2,Huh???? what happened!!!,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,381,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'interesting', 'story', 'apart', 'girl', 'introduced', 'stated', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Very', 'good', 'start', 'pieces', 'end', 'positive', 'side', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'Blows', 'away', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Matrix', 'film', 'cinematography', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'strong', 'enough', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'amazing', 'movie']",Alive - Director's Cut Edition

Tenshu Yashiro, after having been condemned to the electric chair, is given a second chance to live. He's locked in a room with another prisoner and their reactions are observed by scientists. Although the first 15 minutes are interesting because we don't know what the movie is really about, ALIVE disappoints very quickly. The director mixes an alien entity, weird flashbacks that don't bring anything to the storyline, mean politicians who don't hesitate to slaughter nice scientists and so on.

845291,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B0002UB2YQ,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[6, 7]","After watching the brilliance that was director Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus, my first move was to instantly seek out and watch all of his other films released here in the states.  Enter Alive, the next feature length film that Kitamura released.  Much like Versus, it features the similarly bizarre plot elements, ultra slick and stylish direction, moments of brash violence, and even Tak Sakaguchi in a minor role.  Unfortunately though, where Versus featured a near unrelenting amount of violence that gave way to a few moments of exposition and plotting, Alive plays it completely the opposite way, with a near unrelenting amount of exposition and buildup with very few moments of actual action.  The film follows two prisoners, who after surviving their death sentence by electrocution, are given the choice to live but only as part of a government experiment... that's when things get really strange.  Turns out there is an ""entity"" that inhabits a person with the greatest urge to kill and gives them almost limitless powers, of course the military wants to harness this power through the surviving inmate.  Sounds pretty cool right?  Don't be fooled like I was, this is anything but cool.  Instead it's a slow-moving mess of a movie that isn't helped at all by it's 2 hour runtime (where in Versus you never wanted it to end, you'll find yourself watching the timer on the DVD player more than the actual movie here)and anyone who enjoyed (or loved like myself)Versus would be better served skipping this and seeking out either Aragami or Azumi for more familiar stylized and violent entertainment.  For fans of the film (both of you), Tokyo Shock has delivered a very nice 2 disc special director's cut of the film with some decent bonus features (Making Of Alive featurette, cast and director interviews, and trailers galore).  With Versus, it seemed like director Kitamura had found a cure for Narcolepsy (the condition of falling asleep spontaneously and unwillingly)with his kinetic, ""don't blink or you'll miss something"" delivery... well with Alive he's cured another sleep condition, Insomnia.",2,Alive?

A man murders the gang that raped his girlfriend and is placed in the electric chair.  When the voltage fails to kill him, he is given the option to live or to be fried again.  He chooses life.  Enter storyline #2.  He is put into what seems to be a ""Cube"" type experiment: locked in a metal room with a psychotic man who claims to have also escaped The Chair.  It appears some government scientists are testing how long it will take these two to kill each other.  But that's not it.  Enter storyline #3.  A beautiful woman appears to the men.  It seems she is the host for an alien entity that her father contracted from eating a baboon that visited a spaceship in the jungle (Oh, how I wish I were making that up!).

The goal of the experiment is to have one of the guys kill the other for a reason that is later exposed at about the same time as that alien thing called the &#34;Isomer.&#34;The film is way too long.
