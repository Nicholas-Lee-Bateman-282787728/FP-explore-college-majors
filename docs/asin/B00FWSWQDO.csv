1673558,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00FWSWQDO,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","Michael Phillips, movie critic for the Chicago Tribune, noted of the movie ""Battle L.A."" that, though it is riddled with cliches, it still triumphed. He feels cliches can be efficient, and it's what you do with them that counts. In ""Underdog"" it's loaded with cliches and they're handled clumsily to the point of being painful.Here's the scoop. Set in Ohio, the St. Thomas Aquinas High School football team gets a new football coach (D.B. Sweeney) to make winners of them. The star quarterback's dad works in the factory (and does assorted dog work) for the local rich factory owner. Dad invents a really great, but expensive, space heater. Can the team triumph? Can dad sell his idea and beat a lawsuit by his boss? I thought I would care.This was just awful. You've seen this movie any number of times, and every version was probably better than this. And it fails on a few levels. First is the script. The set-up is common. ""Hoosiers,"" Remember the Titans"" et al all walked the same road with greater success. Here, the set ups are lame. The dialogue is simple-minded and you can see the end coming from the first act. Then there's the acting. The quarterback, Bobby Burkett, (Logan Huffman) is Okay but relies too much on his looks. His dad (William Maypother) is a stick of wood. He's a doormat for his boss and we're supposed to have sympathy for him because he stutters. Yes. I feel bad for him but he's spineless milqetoast. Thank God he had a good invention. He'd be totally useless otherwise. Much of the acting is fair to poor.I simply could not believe how every aspect of this was mishandled. This might be a good family movie as long as the kids involved aren't old enough to see how awful this is. Other than that, see one of the better versions of this story.",2,Fraught With Cliches,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,1775,"['Michael', 'Phillips', 'movie', 'critic', 'Chicago', 'Tribune', 'noted', 'movie', 'Battle', 'L.A.', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'still', 'triumphed', 'cliches', 'can', 'be', 'efficient', 'what', 'do', 'Underdog', 'loaded', 'cliches', ""'re"", 'handled', 'clumsily', 'point', 'being', 'scoop', 'Set', 'Ohio', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'High', 'School', 'football', 'team', 'new', 'football', 'coach', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'make', 'winners', 'star', 'quarterback', 'dad', 'factory', 'assorted', 'dog', 'work', 'local', 'rich', 'factory', 'owner', 'Dad', 'really', 'great', 'expensive', 'space', 'heater', 'Can', 'team', 'triumph', 'Can', 'dad', 'sell', 'idea', 'beat', 'lawsuit', 'boss', 'thought', 'would', 'care.This', 'was', 'just', 'awful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'number', 'times', 'version', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'few', 'levels', 'First', 'script', 'set-up', 'common', 'Hoosiers', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'walked', 'same', 'road', 'greater', 'success', 'Here', 'set', 'ups', 'are', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'simple-minded', 'can', 'see', 'end', 'coming', 'first', 'act', 'Then', 'acting', 'quarterback', 'Bobby', 'Burkett', 'Logan', 'Huffman', 'Okay', 'too', 'much', 'looks', 'dad', 'William', 'Maypother', 'stick', 'wood', 'doormat', 'boss', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Yes', 'feel', 'bad', 'spineless', 'milqetoast', 'Thank', 'God', 'had', 'good', 'invention', ""'d"", 'be', 'totally', 'useless', 'otherwise', 'Much', 'acting', 'fair', 'poor.I', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'aspect', 'was', 'mishandled', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'kids', 'involved', 'are', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'see', 'how', 'awful', 'Other', 'see', 'one', 'better', 'versions', 'story']",Underdogs

1673561,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00FWSWQDO,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Sports films are a dime a dozen. While the names, locations, and even the sport changes, the story rarely does, so what makes one film better than the rest? An eager young cast, a compelling back story, and a setting rarely seen before, all help Underdogs become that rare sports film that does more than just pump you up, it sticks with you and really makes you appreciate things that most people overlook. In Ohio, football is life, from the pros right down to the High School level and in the suburbs of Canton, Hoover is the name on everyone's bumper sticker, but they're not the only team in town. Across town is a division four team, the St. Thomas Aquinas Knights, a catholic school team that has never received any attention of any kind. Being a D4 team, even if they won all their games, they won't be going anywhere. The players, while talented are uninspired, until a new coach comes to town and makes them believe in themselves. The film is based on a true story and stars V's Logan Huffman as Quarterback, Bill Burkett. Huffman is always one of these guys you see in the background of a film and never really take notice of. In Underdogs, much like his character, Huffman steps up and really puts on a performance that I never would have expected. On and off the field the character being portrayed is so profound, that anyone would have a hard time making him believable. Not only does Logan Huffman do the impossible, but he does so in such a compelling way, that I added everything he's ever been in to my queue, once the film was over. Even though there is a lot more here than in your typical sports film, Huffman ties all the elements together, in a very special way, you seldom see anymore. To say his performance was legendary, truly does it a disservice. Even if you hate football, as a fan of movies, you should see this film just to witness the unbelievable performance of Logan Huffman, because he really was that good. As for the rest of the film, Underdogs was centered on football, but wasn't entirely about the team, it was also about the town, and how different one side can be from the other. The story of this town is almost as interesting as what's happening on the gridiron. Underdogs is a small budget, direct-to-video film, but much like the Knights, it packs a punch and really gives the big boys a run for their money.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2356,"['Sports', 'films', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'names', 'locations', 'even', 'sport', 'changes', 'story', 'rarely', 'what', 'one', 'film', 'better', 'rest', 'eager', 'young', 'cast', 'compelling', 'back', 'story', 'setting', 'rarely', 'seen', 'help', 'Underdogs', 'become', 'rare', 'sports', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'pump', 'up', 'really', 'appreciate', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'overlook', 'Ohio', 'football', 'life', 'pros', 'right', 'down', 'High', 'School', 'level', 'suburbs', 'Canton', 'Hoover', 'name', 'everyone', 'bumper', 'sticker', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'team', 'town', 'town', 'division', 'four', 'team', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'Knights', 'catholic', 'school', 'team', 'never', 'received', 'attention', 'kind', 'Being', 'D4', 'team', 'even', 'won', 'games', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'going', 'anywhere', 'players', 'talented', 'are', 'uninspired', 'new', 'coach', 'town', 'believe', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'V', 'Logan', 'Huffman', 'Quarterback', 'Bill', 'Burkett', 'Huffman', 'always', 'one', 'guys', 'see', 'background', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'take', 'notice', 'Underdogs', 'much', 'character', 'Huffman', 'up', 'really', 'performance', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'field', 'character', 'being', 'portrayed', 'so', 'profound', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'believable', 'Not', 'only', 'Logan', 'Huffman', 'do', 'impossible', 'so', 'such', 'compelling', 'way', 'added', 'everything', 'ever', 'been', 'queue', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'Even', 'lot', 'more', 'here', 'typical', 'sports', 'film', 'Huffman', 'elements', 'together', 'very', 'special', 'way', 'seldom', 'see', 'anymore', 'say', 'performance', 'was', 'legendary', 'truly', 'disservice', 'Even', 'hate', 'football', 'fan', 'movies', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'witness', 'unbelievable', 'performance', 'Logan', 'Huffman', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'rest', 'film', 'Underdogs', 'was', 'centered', 'football', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'team', 'was', 'also', 'town', 'how', 'different', 'one', 'side', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'story', 'town', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'what', 'happening', 'gridiron', 'Underdogs', 'small', 'budget', 'direct-to-video', 'film', 'much', 'Knights', 'punch', 'really', 'big', 'run', 'money']",Underdogs
