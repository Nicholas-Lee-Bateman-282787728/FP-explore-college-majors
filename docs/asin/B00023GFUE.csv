The film can be a little too saccharine at times, which is why I gave it only 4 stars, but it also has a lot of heart to it.  In addition, it has something you don't see in movies these days, a strong sense of faith that doesn't beat you over the head or condescend.  My hat goes off to Tyler Perry for writing such a wonderful faith-based (if I can use that term) story without getting too preachy.  Perry also deserves kudos for creating two very wonderful, though over the top, characters in Madea and Joe.  The real breakout of this film has to be Kimberly Elise who has starred in two very good films in the last year:  first with ""Woman Thou Art Loosed"" and now with ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman.""

Pretty much what you'd expect, though I was surprised that Perry's Medea was so foul mouthed and gangsterish, weed-smoking and gun-toting (as this is supposed to be a ""religious"" movie).However, I'm not as hard-nosed as I used to be about such things.

Anyone ever think about that? Most 'white' films about Christianity are Roman Catholic influenced. Rarely will you ever see or hear any 'white' preachers, in a 'white' film, even use the name of Jesus. But black films can get away with it. Well, i applaud the intention and motives of Mr.Tyler Perry...but i have to say, he sent the wrong message with this farce.The film revolves around the character of Helen McCarter, and her abusive marriage to a one time drug dealer-turned lawyer. He gets a girlfriend and kicks her out of the house...after 20 years of marriage. Thru her cousin (played by Tyler Perry), she befriends a handsome young man that sweeps her off her feet. Before the film ends, her husband gets confined to a wheelchair. His girlfriend leaves him and he needs his wife to take care of him...which she does, unwillingly. She wants revenge and gets malicious on him (He's paralyzed from the neck down). She then learns from her mother and grandmother (also played by Tyler Perry), that she needs to forgive him. She does. All seems well, especially after they all attend church together, and seemingly start anew. After church they're all at the grandmother's house having a nice soul-food meal, and she get's up and tells her husband she's in love with another man, and walks out the door. The film ends with her in her new lover's arms. Now, if this is what Tyler Perry thinks is a Christian message of a movie, then I've got news for him!? The Bible says that a Christian woman that has an unbelieving husband, should stay with him and be submissive. Her Godly and Loving character may just save him. Nowhere does it say that we should leave to go find a 'better' lover. It does say a man can put away his wife, but it's not taught as the best thing to do.I just feel that Tyler Perry is sending the wrong message with this film. Her husband cried and repented in church. She hugs him and cries with him and they worship God together. Then she runs out the door and into the arms of another man??? Excuse me, but that's just wrong.Not only that, but parts of this film were very vulgar and distasteful. It's not really what you'd want your children to watch. Drug usage, shooting, sexual innuendos...not really a family film. There were some very funny scenes, and much of it was entertaining ( i don't know which came first, this or the Nutty Professor films, but one of them is a rip-off of the other...at least Eddy Murphy didn't use Christianity as a crutch).

822936,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00023GFUE,David E. Levine,"[4, 6]","I expected this movie to be a sort of raucus comedy about an angry woman going on some wild rampage. To a small extent I was right. After Helen, played by Kimberly Elise, is dumped by Charles, her wealthy lawyer husband, played by Steve Harris, she is totally crushed. Her cruel husband, in the presence of his shallow new love interest, literally drags Helen out of the house and tosses her into a UHaul, loaded with her stuff, driven by a guy he hired to drive her away. The physically violent manner in which he tosses her out borders on domestic violence. Helen ends up at her grandmother's, played by male actor Tyler Perry, and this is where the cartoonish part of the movie comes in as this gun carrying senior citizen initially helps Helen get a small measure of revenge.However, the movie takes a more serious turn and is actually a very religious movie which speaks of redemption on many levels. Helen finds a new love interest and begins to get her life back together through him. Meanwhile, Charles' life takes an unexpected turn and Helen uses the opportunity to extract sweet revenge as she almost literally kicks him when he is down. She treats him sadistically when he is most vulnerable. Ultimately, though, she forgives him and obtains a sort of redemption through this forgiveness. Charles also undergoes a rehabilitation. Another character in the movie undergoes drug rehab. There is a climatic scene in a church, where to gospel music, these redemptions are celebrated.Helen's new romance is portrayed in a refreshing way. It is very clear that they share genuine intamacy but do not have sex. It is something that is being saved for if and when they get married. Obtaining love through this type of intimacy is another form of redemption. I must say, however, that the romance at times becomes too syrupy and schmaltzy for my taste. It takes on an ultra ""chick flick"" level of nausea. Nonetheless, this surprising movie contains many good, positive messages. Futhermore, it explores religious themes. Accordingly, I rate it 5 stars.",5,Surprisingly good on several levels,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,2054,"['expected', 'movie', 'be', 'sort', 'raucus', 'comedy', 'angry', 'woman', 'going', 'wild', 'rampage', 'small', 'extent', 'was', 'right', 'Helen', 'played', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'dumped', 'Charles', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'played', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'totally', 'crushed', 'cruel', 'husband', 'presence', 'shallow', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'literally', 'Helen', 'house', 'UHaul', 'loaded', 'stuff', 'driven', 'guy', 'hired', 'drive', 'away', 'physically', 'violent', 'manner', 'out', 'borders', 'domestic', 'violence', 'Helen', 'up', 'grandmother', 'played', 'male', 'actor', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'where', 'cartoonish', 'part', 'movie', 'gun', 'carrying', 'senior', 'citizen', 'initially', 'Helen', 'get', 'small', 'measure', 'revenge.However', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'turn', 'actually', 'very', 'religious', 'movie', 'redemption', 'many', 'levels', 'Helen', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'Meanwhile', 'Charles', 'life', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'Helen', 'opportunity', 'extract', 'sweet', 'revenge', 'almost', 'literally', 'when', 'down', 'treats', 'sadistically', 'when', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'Ultimately', 'sort', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'Charles', 'also', 'rehabilitation', 'character', 'movie', 'undergoes', 'drug', 'rehab', 'climatic', 'scene', 'church', 'where', 'gospel', 'music', 'redemptions', 'are', 'celebrated.Helen', 'new', 'romance', 'portrayed', 'refreshing', 'way', 'very', 'clear', 'share', 'genuine', 'intamacy', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'something', 'being', 'saved', 'when', 'get', 'married', 'Obtaining', 'love', 'type', 'intimacy', 'form', 'redemption', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'romance', 'times', 'becomes', 'too', 'syrupy', 'schmaltzy', 'taste', 'ultra', 'chick', 'flick', 'level', 'nausea', 'Nonetheless', 'surprising', 'movie', 'many', 'good', 'positive', 'messages', 'Futhermore', 'religious', 'themes', 'Accordingly', 'rate', '5', 'stars']",N/A

822942,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00023GFUE,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","This 2005 film version of Tyler Perry's stage play, directed by Darren Grant gives viewers a complex look at the African American demographic in modern-day Atlanta through the eyes of a woman named Helen McCarter,played with skillful range by Kimberly Elise, with Perry himself in three roles as the sassy Madea, her brother, Joe, and Helen's cousin, Brian.We meet Helen and her attorney husband Charles(Steve Harris) on a grand night in Atlanta society where Charles receives an honor for his work. Despite the evening of toasts, tributes, compliments, and an evening on the ballroom floor, by the time Helen's husband drops her off at their mansion to return purportedly to his office, we know, as Helen ascends the porch stair case looking like a queen, that there are serious cracks in the facade.In the course of this film, we see Helen's attempt to salvage her troubled 18-year marriage met with spite and contempt from her husband, who has a new woman in his life named Brenda(Lisa Marcos), whom,as it happens, has already given him two children--a fact upon which Helen literally stumbles when she tries to have lunch with Charles at his office.Shortly thereafter, U-Haul worker Orlando,(played with great intelligence and sensitivity by Shemar Moore) witnesses the devastating scene of Helen being thrown out of her own house by Charles after a bitter confrontation with Charles and his mistress there. The U-Haul trailer is packed with Helen's things and Orlando is instructed to drop Helen off whereever she wants to go. After driving around for sometime, a still reeling and devastated Helen is asked to decide where to go by Orlando, who must get to his second job.She decides to go to her grandmother Madea's house, and this is where the comedy and the drama of the story will combine.When Helen arrives, she is also reunited with her cousin Bryan's estranged wife Debrah(Tamara Taylor), an addict to whom Madea is giving some food before sending her back on the street.Madea is naturally outraged by what has happened to her granddaughter, and the following day, goes with her to the mansion while Charles is out, and leads Helen in ripping up the mistresses' high fashion wardrobe.Charles and Brenda confront the two of them, and there is dramatic license taken in an outrageous scene with a chain saw, which lands both Helen and Madea in the slammer until they are bailed out by Brian.Placed under house arrest, Madea entertains family and friends at a gathering at her home where a woman named Mildred(Carol Mitchell-Leon) joins Uncle Joe in smoking reefer during a card game, and both see rabbits in a hallucination.Soon this is overshadowed as the guests line-dance to music, and Helen, wondering how to get her life back together, is reunited with Orlando and taking her bitterness out on him because he knows her shameful situation.Helen also visits her mother(Cecily Tyson), relegated to a nursing home, especially since Charles did not want any relatives around him. The religious elderly lady gives her daughter a gentle pep talk, encouraging her to tap into her own strength in the wake of her reversal of fortune. Amid hilarious moments of antagonism from Joe and Madea's sharp and riotous retorts, Helen takes a job as a waitress, and gradually finds some personal happiness.She sees Orlando again when he is a customer at the restaraunt where she works, and they gradually begin dating.In the meantime, a shady deal Charles made with a client slowly comes back to haunt him. In due time, his estranged wife's observation about how ""God has the power to show you that He is God!"" will be vindicated in a way in which he will never forget.We also follow Brian's family situation, having to raise two kids(Tiffany Evans, Avery Knight) by himself due to their mother's substance abuse, and Madea's urging him to let his daughter join their church choir, advising him that just because his wife's singing career led her to drug abuse does not mean the same will happen to his daughter.A dramatic turn of events sends Helen back to Charles just as Orlando was about to propose to her, and Charles will find that within those 30 days in which their divorce is to become  final, Helen is all he really has left. But for Helen, this is the occassion where 18 years of pent-up rage come to the foreground and her own personal version of what was referred to as ""Operation Hell's Fury"" in ""The First Wives Club"" is fully enacted.Madea's reflections on revenge are another high point of hilarity in the story. In the finale there is some reconciliation where there needed to be. But, ironically after a church service, the once mad black woman whose journalistic recordings are the staple of this story makes a dramatic decision with her life for which no one could honestly blame her.While many have complained about the sterotypical characters involved, this piece is one that depicts certain realities of life that take us through the whole gamut of human emotions with humor and style.",5,"Review of a  Hysterically Funny, Touching, and Complex Story",1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,5006,"['2005', 'film', 'version', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'stage', 'play', 'directed',

Tyler Perry had long been an icon in the African-American community with his popular stage plays. The film version of Diary of a Mad Black Woman is one of the greatest African-American ""dramedy's"" ever released.First of all, Madea does steal the show in her handful of scenes, but she is not the star of the movie. Kimberly Elise stars as a woman who has been married for 18 years. She loves her lawyer husband Charles who is impressively portrayed by Steve Harris. On the outside it looks like they have the perfect life, but their marriage is horrible. They have money and a huge estate but he abuses his wife Helen emotionally, verbally-and physically. The scene in which he drags her out of the house on their 18th wedding anniversary is heartbreaking.When Charles leaves Helen with nothing she finds herself at her grandmother Madea's house. Madea is so hilarious. She makes Helen realize that she is entitled to money and property. When Madea and Helen go back to Helen's house the adventures ensue.Shemar Moore stars in the movie a different kind of role. He normally plays the ""pretty boy"" type but in this movie he is an unshaven, corn row and doo rag wearing blue collar worker named Orlando. He and Helen get off on the wrong foot but they eventually warm to each other. Tyler Perry who stars as Madea, also appears in the movie as Helen's cousin Brian. Brian is a lawyer and he is having marital problems. His estranged wife and the mother of his two children is strung out on drugs. Tyler Perry also appears in the film as the outspoken brother of Madea, Joe.  Those two are hilarious on screen together as they trade barbs back and forth.  Madea is always one step from pulling out her pistol on him. Cicely Tyson appears in the movie as Helen's mother. Cicely and Kimberly actually look like they could be related.  With help from her family and her new friend Orlando, Helen comes out of her shell and starts to enjoy life.  When she suffers a set back in her self discovery it appears she might return to the abusive relationship that almost destroyed her.This is such a great movie. You will laugh and you might cry.

(Perry's first movie, in which he directed, is Madea's Family Reunion). This is a solid movie which wonderfully portrays a naive black woman who is heartlessly taken advantage of by her husband of 18 years.  Suddenly a veil is lifted in a wonderfully acted scene, which plays much like a play, where the woman's naivety and innocence are brought to her own attention and she loses all control of her reality.  We watch as the woman, scarred from her ex-man, sheds her stereotypes of black men and begins to trust them (in her case a potential love interest) for who they are, not what they are ""supposed"" to be.Perry knows woman well.  He also knows men: the good and the bad (who he is proud to write, are still worthy of forgiveness). Perry is also a wonderful character actor as both Madea and Uncle Joe are very funny.

Didn't we already have a little too much of Eddie Murphy in his second Nutty Professor flick? And Martin Lawrence working the fat suit too? A couple of women friends of mine saw this movie, and I ended up going to see Madea's Family Reunion in the theatre and being very pleasantly surprised. I finally got around to seeing this on DVD and I have to give props to Tyler for having enough vision to take his ""chitlin circuit"" musicals to the big screen.The hooks draw you in. You immediately care for the black woman wronged. Madea's get mad and get even message from Tyler Perry in his fat suit. Tyler Perry as Joe cracking about Madea's ""refrigerator in her behind"". There's always a laugh around the corner.What makes this film a little stronger than I expected was that it successfully draws on messages of black family without being aimed at a purely churchgoing audience. Sinners will smile a little bit more at some of their churched relatives. Saints will be moved by the struggles for salvation and forgiveness in the movie.The plot is not always tight. There's a bit of heavyhanded foreshadowing at times and there's a sideplot with the lawyer's crack addict wife that probably adds some unnecessary running time. Still, I give Tyler credit. This is first time out of the box and I think that he learned a lot from this movie in making an even stronger Madea.Tyler's an amazing entrepreneur and a caring playwright who makes a bold move in this movie.

822969,A2TAJ7OQD1P5I8,B00023GFUE,Jenks,"[3, 4]","...at times this film made me want to. Of course I found problems with this film--namely the Madea caricature. Oftentimes, I felt as if I were watching two different films at once. And while Madea was only in a few scenes it was sometimes distracting from the seriousness of the plot. Another problem I had with the film was some of the dialogue. There is a line where the character Helen (played by Kimberly Elise) talks about her new beau Orlando (played by Shemar Moore) in a diary entry and mentions that not only is he beautiful and sensitive, but he's a Christian too! Quite frankly, it just sounded somewhat childish and ridiculous to me.  Oftentimes, I felt like I was watching a soap opera because some of the dialogue and scenes were so melodramatic and over the top (especially the overblown ending church scene, which left much to be desired) that I was wondering when they were going to bring in the violins--and in fact I think they actually did.  At times I felt that parts of the film were too contrived and maybe a little unrealistic.  I found it hard to believe that a man as drop dead gorgeous as Orlando (Shemar Moore) would be lured by or even be remotely interested in Helen (Kimberly Elise), or that a man SO good looking would be celibate, thoughtful, considerate, sensitive, understanding, or as insightful as he was.But..on the other hand...The film's cinematography was stunning--and the acting was top notch.  Kimberly Elise is not a favorite of mine but she is very talented and always delivers.  Steve Harris (The Practice) is highly convincing and does well with what he has to work with.  He is a VERY good actor and I hope he gets more opportunities in film.  Tyler Perry's no slouch and displays his acting chops (when he's not in drag or portraying some other caricature) very effectively and with ease.  And Tamara Taylor does her best with the material. But most astonishing, was Shemar Moore of all people, who actually CAN act (a little bit anyway..though I attribute some of his effectiveness to director Darren Grant). I remember when he was on the soap opera The Young and the Restless and my roommates in college would just swoon over him.  I on the other hand, just saw him as another pretty boy with no acting ability whatsoever getting by solely on good looks.  Times change.  And while I personally still find him highly annoying, his performance as the sensitive and understanding blue collar worker who falls for Helen IS believable.  He made me want to believe in fairy tales (well...at least where he was concerned anyway). I hope in the future he (Shemar Moore) becomes more mature and chooses more challenging roles where he can rely on his talent and not on his good looks.Overall I thought this film had some serious limitations, but when I got the film I wasn't expecting a masterpiece--if I wanted that I would have gotten Gone With the Wind.  But for better or worse, this film kind of had a magic to it and for some inexplicable reason...I like it.",4,"""I know you don't believe in fairy tales but...""",1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,3007,"['times', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'course', 'found', 'problems', 'film', 'namely', 'Madea', 'caricature', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'two', 'different', 'films', 'once', 'Madea', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'sometimes', 'distracting', 'seriousness', 'plot', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'dialogue', 'line', 'where', 'character', 'Helen', 'played', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'talks', 'new', 'beau', 'Orlando', 'played', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'diary', 'entry', 'mentions', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'Christian', 'too', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'just', 'sounded', 'somewhat', 'childish', 'ridiculous', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'soap', 'opera', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'melodramatic', 'top', 'especially', 'overblown', 'ending', 'church', 'scene', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'wondering', 'when', 'were', 'going', 'bring', 'violins', 'fact', 'think', 'actually', 'did', 'times', 'felt', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'too', 'contrived', 'maybe', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'Orlando', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'would', 'be', 'lured', 'even', 'be', 'remotely', 'interested', 'Helen', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'man', 'SO', 'good', 'looking', 'would', 'be', 'celibate', 'thoughtful', 'considerate', 'sensitive', 'understanding', 'as', 'insightful', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'stunning', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'not', 'favorite', 'mine', 'very', 'talented', 'always', 'delivers', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'Practice', 'highly', 'convincing', 'well', 'what', 'work', 'VERY', 'good', 'actor', 'hope', 'more', 'opportunities', 'film', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'slouch', 'acting', 'chops', 'when', 'not', 'drag', 'portraying', 'other', 'caricature', 'very', 'effectively', 'ease', 'Tamara', 'Taylor', 'best', 'material', 'most', 'astonishing', 'was', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'CAN', 'act', 'little', 'bit', 'attribute', 'effectiveness', 'director', 'Darren', 'Grant', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'soap', 'Young', 'Restless', 'roommates', 'college', 'would', 'just', 'swoon', 'over', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'saw', 'pretty', 'boy', 'acting', 'ability', 'whatsoever', 'getting', 'solely', 'good', 'looks', 'Times', 'change', 'personally', 'still', 'find', 'highly', 'annoying', 'performance', 'sensitive', 'understanding', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'who', 'Helen', 'IS', 'believable', 'made', 'want', 'believe', 'fairy', 'tales', 'well', 'least', 'where', 'was', 'concerned', 'anyway', 'hope', 'future', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'more', 'mature', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'where', 'can', 'rely', 'talent', 'not', 'good', 'looks.Overall', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'serious', 'limitations', 'when', 'got', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'wanted', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'better', 'worse', 'film', 'kind', 'had', 'magic', 'inexplicable', 'reason']",N/A

They've never been an angry black woman. Tyler Perry did a superb job at pulling out all of the emotions of the barely acknowledged abused black woman. I think that even with all the humor, the movie right on the money in portraying shades of black people that the mast majority of people don't get to see.Shemar's character may have seemed over the top - but it's a romance movie! I mean how perfect is Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail? In my experience, black men are incredible smooth - the poetry, the way they walk and talk, the way the romance. Listen to the music of Heather Headly, Jill Scott, Dwele, Kem, Eric Benet... It's all passionate, deep, moving, very compelling. And in all honesty, not only does it work in this movie, it rings true with black people. That's what we dream of - that's what every woman dreams of regardless of color.Helen"" was the abused woman (again regardless of color)... we will never understand it but they stay. That's not act like that was out of the ordinary! There are a lot of women who are emotionally abused and live in denial. As for her vengeance... again, it rings very true. I challenge you to find a black woman who, after going through all of that and trying to go back and do what she's always done - taking care of the man who broke her, in the house that shoved painful memories right back in her face - would not do or dream of doing what she did. She snapped and she had to assert herselfTyler Perry was careful to say that ""yeah, while vengeance feels good, you're still giving him the power if you don't forgive... and you turn into someone else if you don't let that anger go."" I thought that was obvious. But I suppose if you're already annoyed with the movie you wouldn't catch that. The added drama of the shady past of Charles - adds to his horrible character, shows his wife wasn't the only one who was snubbed by him, it was the seeds he had sown coming back to get him in the end. It was merely a set up for the change in the movie where he would be helpless. That's all. Listen to Tyler Perry's Commentary.Each character had their motivation. It was clear, it was their own personal character builder, they all interacted well, and nothing took away from the main story line - which was well developed. Not over obvious. Not confusing.

822977,AEM0E9A4XGYFH,B00023GFUE,K. Reynolds,"[8, 15]","Tyler Perry, an above average playwright, found his niche in black theatrical plays. Cashing in the millions from predominately black audiences. Diary is Perry's first jump from the stage to the big-screen. I'll try to keep my review as realistic and honest as possible here.The Positives.1. Diary as well as the rest of Perry's plays has always preached the positives of having strength in family, community, and in self.2. All of the ultimate messages displayed are great morals all grafted or inspired from the Holy Bible. The film is loaded with plenty of biblical/Christian undertones.3. Shemar Moore refrains from taking off his shirt for once.The Negatives.Despite the positive qualities of this film. The negatives send this one spiraling down like an albatross. This film is overloaded with countless and redundant stereotypes that plague many of today's ""black"" films and television shows. At times I felt like I was watching an old Minstrel Show minus the blackface paint. The comedy unveiled in Diary is extremely poor and one dimensional. For Media to be the inspirational/spiritual grandmother, she contradicts her elegance by overly pulling out hand guns on relatives, friends, and innocent bystanders. Don't get me wrong, I chuckled at the gun scenes...but it wasn't that funny. It's just sad when you have to get a roar out of your audience by adding on gun play to a bland/unoriginal joke. The scenes with her brother smoking weed with the other relatives could have been left out as well. For this to be a Christian oriented film, the protagonists often contradict themselves and their ""holiness"". None of the actors and actresses convinced me. Kimberley Elise was gaining a lot of momentum as an upcoming black actress on the scene, and kills that momentum here. She simply doesn't add flavor to this bad exploitation movie. At times Diary makes you feel like your watching a cheesy soap opera on UPN. It saddens me that many of our people (yes I'm a brotha) buy into this mess in the 21st century. It's like these Madia plays are sending us back 30 years. You can respond with the oh so common ""it's just a film lighten up"" stuff. But how much longer are we going to keep tolerating this nonsense. Diary is supposed to be uplifting but it brings us right back down time after time. The acting was horrific. Note, if Shamar Moore is casted in a film, chances are you're watching a bad movie.It seems as if a majority of our (black/African-American) films are illustrated on these unrealistic canvases. Always a struggle between the filthy rich and the filthy poor in unrealistic settings. And in the midst of these films the people in the middle are never highlighted. ""Black"" films need more avant-garde substance in today's cinema. The clich&eacute;' black church ending pretty much did it for me, which was stolen right from the Color Purple. Remember when Shug Avery marched to the church and tore the house down with her daughter leading the choir??? Well you're about to see it again, but with a terrible lipsynching voice over. When Elise takes Madia's advice to forgive,,, she does and nurses her paraplegic low-down husband back to full strength...to where he admits his wrongs and he is ultimately saved. She dumps him at the family Sunday dinner table (Wow, you picked the right time and place to do this!!!) for Shemar Moore because she's in love! I'm sorry but this is just unbelievable. Oh yeah the final sequence rips off An Officer and a Gentleman. You're a genius Tyler!Ultimately, I think in time... Perry's scripts, humor, intelligence, and originality will come into fruition. Perry's is an amazing entrepreneur who restored some life to the art of being a black thespian on stage. It's just unfortunate that he's always dumbing down and exploiting our culture and audience with these mama plays, while hiding the sheer ignorance of the material with a Christian cloak. The Christian cloak keeps the negative critics at bay (kind of like how we can't boo the terrible singer at the Apollo, who chooses to sing a gospel hymn). The whole Christian superiority complex exists way too much in this film also.Perry should have taken notes from Robert Townsend, Spike Lee, and F Gary Gray to carry a much swifter point across.",2,"3 Words.

Is that a big deal? No. It becomes a non-factor because you are enthralled by the growth that is made by the near real-life characters in this production: A hateful, mean-spirited husband treats his wife of 18 years like dirt  eventually kicking her out and moving in his girlfriend and his children;  That same man nearly dies and through his illness he finds the Lord and becomes a kind, good man; A drug addict mother goes from being an addict living on the streets away from her family to going to rehab and re-entering the church and reuniting with her family; And, an angry black women forgives the man that stole her life away from her for 18 years and finds true love.

822999,AJK5WHV1GW941,B00023GFUE,Mikeisha Best,"[0, 0]","""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" is a flick about a couple who have been married for many years (played by Steve Harris and Kimberly Elise.)  On their wedding anniversary, the husband decides to tell his wife that he doesn't wish to be married to her any longer and that he found someone else.  In doing this, he is very curt, succinct and blatantly rude to her, even going as far as dragging her out of their home since she refused to leave.  Throughout the movie, the wife has a very difficult time copping with her husband's cruelty.  She is forced to move in with a family member, the always wild Mable ""Madea"" Simmons.  The wife pretty much remains composed, even after the breakup, but of course, with the help of Madea, she gives her husband a piece of her mind a few times, something he deserved.  She eventually finds someone else who is interested in her, but she is having a very difficult time with losing her husband.  Many of the scenes in this movie are quite emotional and heartfelt.  Some scenes aren't easy to watch.The husband is shot in the movie and is temporarily paralyzed.  His new girlfriend no longer wants to be involved with him but his wife opts to take care of him, but she gives him quite a hard time in the process.  Near the end of the movie, she leads her husband to believe that she wants to reconcile and get back together, but in the end, she chooses the man who she was dating after her husband left her.Kimberly Elise is a good actress but for some of the scenes in this movie, she was too reserved.  She should have been more explosive during certain scenes.  Steve Harris did a fantastic job with his role.  Shemar Moore also did well, as did Tyler Perry.I recommend this movie for those who want to see a bittersweet movie with quite a few laughs.

Nowhere does it mention this is a film with a direct message intended to proselytize. If it had, I would have saved my money. I feel cheated and robbed. My money has been usurped from my wallet and under false pretense as well.If I want a religious oriented film, I would buy religious oriented films. If they sell religious oriented films, it should be made clear they are religious oriented films. They aren't making that point clear because the intent is to snooker you into watching the damn thing so as to endure the message! It should be noted that I bought ""The Passion of the Christ"" and knew fully what it was before I bought it. I bought it on purpose. I bought it knowing the subject matter. It was my free will decision to buy it with full knowledge that it was religious in nature.What I object to is the sneaky, underhanded approach used to market this film. It does not convey that it is a religious film, sneaks the DVD into your living room under the guise of entertainment, then unfolds as a gospel message covertly packaged to conceal that fact from the buyer.One thing this film makes abundantly clear, the right religion (in the view of the film) is that Jesus is Lord. What a treat for Jews, Muslims, Hindus or folks of other religions. The message seems to be that their religion is the right one, and somebody else's is not.Who comes seeking to kill, steal and destroy? My money was stolen when I spent it on this malarky, which stumps for a religion that has been responsible for more wars than any other cause, more death and destruction that any other mechanism, in all of human experience.And I am damn mad about it.How can I redeeem my money?It was purloined, so far as I am concerned.I give this film one star, not because the acting isnt great, or the various performers lacking talent.

823014,A2B8G7W3JXKMZA,B00023GFUE,"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ""","[8, 10]","I feel you have to be Christian or a Good Samaritan to really get this movie.  In life, you have Realists or Romantics.  Christianity is a Romantic theme.  You need faith and imagination to even begin to understand Christ--and to love him.  In fact, the Marriage Feast of the Lamb is a very ""syrupy-sweet concept"" and complete joy, if you can persevere past the cross and such, to have the right to receive such undeserved love.Anyway, this movie is a comedy about a cross section of African Americans and their traditional values.  I find many ""New Generation"" people who are ignorant of and/or despise the truth about blacks and just want it all to go away.  These ""realists"" believe that they can take education and make everything better with whitewash.  The truth is that privileges don't erase who or what a person is in their hearts.  Moreover, some people never could or would deny their culture or who they really are for any amount of money or prestige.  But then again, there are those who would gladly sell their souls for success.I am African American. I was born in 1954, and I graduated from USC in Los Angeles.  I feel I have a fairly firm grasp on reality.  My father was a career soldier when I was born, and we live a Middle Class/working class lifestyle.  My neighborhoods were predominately white since I was born.  In the 60s, this was a privilege for blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities.  We were the first groups to have ""governmental protection,"" and had more choices than being Uncle Tom or Aunt Jemima.  I remember well the difference between acting black or acting white.  I guess I acted white.  To me it was just a communication tool.  But it was well accepted wherever I was.  I did not betray my race.  I was just who I was.  And I know of many African Americans (some in my parent's families) who REALLY acted black, like Madea (Tyler Perry's cross-dressing character).  And I LOVE them.  Church, aggressive behavior, strong family ties, all this is black culture, without the whitewash.  I applaud Mr. Perry for an entertaining/informative take on African-American culture that includes everyone you are likely to find in the ""black community,"" (which continually widens and deepens) and gives credibility to both old school and new school black America.I think many of the people who hated this movie are 1) ""oreo"" blacks, who feel shame because of unsophisticated black culture, 2) pseudo-intellectual whites who are uncomfortable with cultural differences in others . . . that totally rejects white assimilation,  and 3) people uncomfortable with Christian themes that plumb the depths of human sins and prevails by Faith, Hope, and Charity. The scorned wife was only human in her abuse of the evil husband while he was disabled.  He deserved it. But she pulled out of that mire of hatred and proved that God is Love and, if you love God, you will begin (in time) to show love for even your worst enemy.  Agape is vehicular in the natural progression of Christian growth and is the power of Redemption.  You have to forgive to be forgiven.Last of all, the love she shared with the working-class cute guy (who really loved and needed her) is realistic in the same sense of Christianity being realistic.  Think about it???  So many still find Jesus and His way ridiculous.  The love that Christ has for His people is sooooo unreal!  But people . . . it is real.  I'm still amazed that God could love the world and me so much, as to save us from damnation.  What did we do to deserve all this?  Hmmm.  Maybe, sometimes, good things just happen to people.  Just like the scorned wife in this story.  She hit bottom, but prevailed in the end.This is such a feel good love story.  The scorned wife stood by her evil but redeemable husband.  She was fortunate to comprehend the love the cute guy held for her.  She made closure with her husband and was free to live and love the man that really wanted her, for herself.  They both deserved that love.  And the evil husband (now born again?) was able to understand his errors and forgive too.Now, eat your hearts out all you that can't comprehend this kind of love and NEVER will deserve it.

823028,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00023GFUE,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 3]","Diary of a Mad Black Woman is one of the best movies of 2005. Director Darren Grant does a wonderful job of adapting Tyler Perry's popular stage play to the screen. Don't listen to the ""professional"" movie critics; this film is worth seeing at least three or four times.Diary is the story of Helen, a woman faithfully married to her husband Charles for 18 years. Dumped on her anniversary she's forced to return home to the family she abandoned. Moving in with her Grandmother Madea she begins her journey towards starting her life over. I'd love to get into the story but I love this movie so much I don't want to give anymore away, this movie is just TOO GOOD TO SPOIL for those who haven't seen it.Kimberly Elise gives an incredible performance as Helen. I felt every emotion Helen had and was involved in her characters' story Watch out Halle, Angela, Gabrielle and Viveca, Kimberly Elise is an up and comer. In a couple of years she's going to be the next black female superstar.  Shemar Moore takes his acting to another level as Orlando. He shows us how much potential he truly has when given a quality script to work with. Tamara Taylor steals the scenes she's in as the drug addicted wife. I wish she had more screen time. Cicely Tyson is great as the Helen's mother. Tyler Perry does a tremendous job in his memorable three roles. Joe and Madea will have you cracking up with their one-liners!Director Darren Grant does a wonderful job with the limited resources he has. With only $5 million dollars he makes a film that looks like it cost $100 million. The beautiful cinematography makes the city of Atlanta itself a character. I felt like I was right there in some of those locations. Looking at the extra features section on the making of, Diary of a Mad Black Woman I was surprised to find out there are special effects in this film. All the frames where Tyler Perry plays different characters blend so seamlessly all you see are the characters in the story.A Shawn James Essential Five star video.

823029,A15MLF38WROSWU,B00023GFUE,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[1, 4]","This movie will make you mad, it will make you laugh and then it will make you cry.  This is a movie you have to own because there will be scenes you miss due to the laughter and wiping the tears from your eyes.  I especially appreciate that Tyler is filming his movies in Atlanta (ATLwood).  Charles Husband of 18 years decides he no longer wants to be with his wife Helen, and just like that tosses her out of the home.  Literally he drags her kicking and screaming out of the home she shared with her husband!!!  He tells her ""The Marriage has run its course."" Then has the nerve to move the mistress in.  Seems everyone knew about the affair except Helen.  To add insult to injury when she first got home and saw the U-Haul truck packing her belonging, she thought Charles was buying her new things.  Now he was hoping to move her before she realized what was going on.  The new clothing was not for her, but for the mistress.Of course my first question was how could a woman watch a man throw his wife out of the home, and not expect him to do the same to her eventually?  Am I the only who wished Helen had straight slapped Brenda when she asked ""You ain't one of those begging sistas?""  I wanted Helen to straight beat her down.I loved hearing lines like ""Kunta Kinte put his foot down and it got chopped off."" Or ""Too busy shopping when you should be checking the deed.""Madea reminds you of someone you know or are related to.  Madea is a mixture of crazy Auntie, or Grandmother.  Full of wisdom, but has that wild side to her.  Feels Helen should be well compensated for Cooking, Cleaning, abuse, and deductions for bad sex.  Madea drags Helen into the home, and they start making a mess out of Brenda's clothing.  Madea calls Brenda a label ho.  When Madea breaks out the power tools and starts chopping furniture in half I'm done for.  I still laugh wilding at that scene everytime I see it.Helen attempts to move on with her life, but ends up with an unexpected situation.  Orlando, the man that was helping her ends up wanting to get to know her, and they start liking each other.  Of course that's after she throws lemonade in his face, and very leery of his intentions.  When Charles is shot by a thug and paralyzed he has no one left but Helen to tend to him and she gets to finally unleash all her anger on him.  Not feeding him, tossing him into the tub and almost drowning him, leaving him to sit in his own waste for hours on end.  Oh yeah, sister was mad, and she let him know how ungrateful he really was.  ""I came here to help now I want to get even.""Brenda not only cleaned him out money wise, but she also did not want him resuscitated.  I still wanted Helen to slap Brenda.  I really did.  When Charles cries, I feel Helen is vindicated.There is another story plot where Brian does not want his daughter to sing, fearing she will end up like her mother who is hooked on crack.  The scene towards the end of the movie when Deborah comes into the church singing her heart out, I usually have to rewind that scene a lot.  It's such a moving scene, and leaves me sniffling yet again.  I'm such a sap.When Orlando tells Helen he loves her is so sweet and so moving.  I just love it. He really bared his soul and let his guard down.  But when Helen breaks his heart, so I'm so upset with her, but I also understand why she did what she had to do.I see so many people complain that Charles was trying to change for the better and if Helen forgave him why didn't she stay with him.  Yes she forgave him, for her peace of mind.  But what people fail to understand is Helen changed, and she was not the same person Charles once knew.  So while she forgave Charles, her heart was not in the same place to be with Charles, and she was ready to be with Orlando.  In fact I'm reaching for tissue all over again when she tells Charles ""I'm in love"", and leaves him sitting at the table, and goes looking for Orlando.I like how the movie ends differently then the play did.  This is simply a fantastic movie and had a wonderful cast of actors.  Now the only thing I thought the braid wig Shemar had to wear was a bit much.  I also like the fact the movie has very little bad language, and there was no sex.  There was intimacy, but no sex.  I will admit that is refreshing.  I also like how spirituality is used n the film, but done in such a way you don't realize it.  It's not in your face; it's done in a subtle way.  The braid wig that Shemar had to wear was a bit much to me, but I guess they wanted to give him a different look.  I thought the movie was phenomenal, I own it and watch it at least one to two times a month and laugh and cry all over again.Tyler Perry is simply the man.  Talented, funny, and just such a blessing to the entertainment industry.  Him playing three roles, Brian, Madea, and Uncle Joe was simply awesome.The message the film conveys is the importance of family, forgiveness, moving on, the willingness to help yourself, fighting addiction, and it's a love story.  A wonderful, wonderful love story.",5,"Spiritual, Entertaining, Engaging, Funny and simply Wonderful",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,5043,"['movie', 'will', 'make', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'then',

A real chainsaw, not a metaphorical one. The Grandma is not merely wrong for the movie, but fatal to it -- a writing and casting disaster.""Ebert was right about that!However, I found the movie to be a huge disappointment for me because of the fact that the storyline didn't stay truthfull to what the movie was all about, the character's narration from the diary.  About 30 minutes to the end of the movie, we don't hear anymore about what the female lead character is thinking.  If the narration would have stayed truthful to the premise of the film (a la ""Goodfellas"" or ""Taxi Driver"" ), it would have been much better film.Instead, this film focused on the wrong characters.  The Grandma played in drag by Tyler Perry was horribly acted.  Perry should be taken to the back and shot for micro-managing this potentially great film into a total mess.  Perry wants this film very badly to be like Richard Pryor in ""Which Way is Up?"" or ""Soul Food"".

It's a great lesson that the easy road is not necessarily the road you should take; in fact, it's probably the road you should run from.I do agree with some other reveiwers that there are a few things that did not need to be in the movie - like the weed smoking scene, or the porn magazine, or really that guy's entire character.But the positive's more than make up for it.  I don't really understand why all the reviewers keep saying that the Christians in this movie are being hypocritical - Madea and the old guy, Tom, I think, are not Christians, and never claim to be.

From this beginning, Diary of a Mad Black Woman goes on a wild tale that goes through many different sub genres of comedy.  There's some slapstick, low brow comedy, witty dialogue and even a touch of dark comedy toward the end.Writer Tyler Perry creates a terrific vehicle to play three roles by himself.  By far the best role in here for him is Madea, Helen's semi-crazy aunt (I think?).  Madea's parts are the funniest portions of the movie, using everything from her gun to a chainsaw to prove a point.  Her over the top behaviour is perfect in setting the tone of the movie.  And considering Madea is a big character in Tyler's plays, I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of her.Sometimes, though, Tyler's roles have an Eddie Murphy Klumps feel to them, especially Joe, an elderly man who is still infatuated with younger women.  His suggestions that he has viagra etc are directly in line with the Klumps style humor.  I wish he would have not created a character similar to those in that movie so he could stand on his own.  But, overall, it was all very funny.Toward the end, the movie started reaching for cliches and melodrama.  The final scene in the church is a bit over the top for me.  That said, it's a great date movie.  There's enough laughs and tears for everyone that those who want to just laugh will laugh and those that like to cry at the end of a happy/sappy movie will also enjoy it.I don't normally enjoy romantic films, I'm the first to admit it.  The genre has been filled with too many cliches and over the top moments that I can't usually get into them.  And yet I enjoyed this film for the most part.  With some of the exceptions above (especially the final church scene), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Sure, sometimes it gets a little heavy handed and cliched but it still is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long while.",4,What a funny movie,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2033,"['When', 'Helen', 'husband', '18', 'years', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'Helen', 'must', 'overcome', 'not', 'only', 'anger', 'rage', 'must', 'learn', 'what', 'truly', 'love', 'beginning', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'wild', 'tale', 'many', 'different', 'sub', 'genres', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'low', 'brow', 'comedy', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'even', 'touch', 'dark', 'comedy', 'end.Writer', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'terrific', 'vehicle', 'play', 'three', 'roles', 'far', 'best', 'role', 'here', 'Madea', 'Helen', 'semi-crazy', 'aunt', 'think', 'Madea', 'parts', 'are', 'funniest', 'portions', 'movie', 'using', 'everything', 'gun', 'chainsaw', 'prove', 'point', 'top', 'behaviour', 'perfect', 'setting', 'tone', 'movie', 'considering', 'Madea', 'big', 'character', 'Tyler', 'plays', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'her.Sometimes', 'though', 'Tyler', 'roles', 'have', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Klumps', 'feel', 'especially', 'Joe', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'infatuated', 'younger', 'women', 'suggestions', 'viagra', 'etc', 'are', 'directly', 'line', 'Klumps', 'style', 'humor', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'created', 'character', 'similar', 'movie', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'overall', 'was', 'very', 'funny.Toward', 'end', 'movie', 'started', 'reaching', 'cliches', 'melodrama', 'final', 'scene', 'church', 'bit', 'top', 'said', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'enough', 'laughs', 'tears', 'everyone', 'who', 'want', 'just', 'laugh', 'will', 'laugh', 'like', 'cry', 'end', 'happy/sappy', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'films', ""'m"", 'first', 'admit', 'genre', 'been', 'filled', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'top', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'usually', 'get', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'exceptions', 'especially', 'final', 'church', 'scene', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Sure', 'sometimes', 'little', 'heavy', 'handed', 'cliched', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while']",N/A

And now Helen who is homeless and no choice but to go to her grandmothers house who's name is Madea(Tyler Perry) and now she tries to pick up the pieces of her life and try to handle her problems in a christian way but it turns out that helen is a very mad black women who is very close to the edge.Then While suffering her eviction from her house and her husband being a total jerk she meets a man that she finds very attractive and she starts to fall for him.But while this is happening her big shot lawyer husband is defending a corrupt man and if he doesnt get this corrupt man off from his charges, well let's just say it's not going to be good for him.As for Madea she is a gangsta grandma who smokes and keeps a handgun in her purse and she makes this movie a very pleasant experience.This Movie has So many twists and so many stories from within helen's family(you also follow her brothers story as his wife is a recovering drug addict)that when the movie is finished you will feel so emotionally exhausted.At times the acting in this movie can be a bit dramatic and some parts may be a bit cliche' or tired by movie terms these days but it does not mess up this movie.I highly suggest that you atleast rent this movie to see if you like it and then purchase if you do.Just come into this movie very clear-minded because this movie is a emotional rollercoaster.But do not forget that its still part comedy so you will get a few good laughs in.Overall i give 4.5 stars so i will round it up to 5!Go now!

The opening scenes of the movie are quite terrible and soap-operish. Kimberly Elise is really weak as the female protagonist. Instead of coming across as the sympathetic victim she comes across as almost inviting the ill treatment. If I were her husband, I probably would have treated her the way he did too. She's pathetic and a completely one dimensional character. I wasn't convinced by her sudden bursts of anger and rage later on in the movie either- the acting wasn't great. The same applies to the man who plays her husband. He gives a very flat and one dimensional portrayal of his character. I felt bored just watching him.That said, the saving grace of the movie is Madea (she's a scene-stealer) and the other characters- including Shemar Moore, who unlike Kimberly Elise is convincing as his character. I LOVE the romance between these two. Tyler Perry really knows how to get into a woman's head and create a feel-good movie.

823051,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00023GFUE,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[3, 3]","Recently, I saw Kimberly Elise' Woman Thou Art Loose, and I was so taken by her performance. Diary of a Mad Black Woman is the perfect star showcase vehicle for Elise to demonstrate her dramatic range with a performance that requires her to shed a bucket of tears, get mad and get even with her nasty husband, forgive and let go, and fall in love again. This film instantly reminded me of Angela Bassette's Waiting To Exhale, but it's funnier, because Tyler Perry was totally funny. His portrayal of Madea is the comic relief to this touching dramedy.Kimberly Elise(Helen), a loving housewife gets humiliated and kicked out by her self-center and successful lawyer husband(Charles/Steve Harris) whom she had been married to for 18 years. He had been secretly having a relationship with a white woman who had two kids with him. Helen had been mistreated by him a great deal, and she even had two miscarriages. She was devastated and had to go and stay with her tough and fierce grandmother Madea(Tyler Perry). Madea took her back to her husband's mansion and did some serious damage to the place, and they got arrested.Orlando(Shemar Moore), a friend of Brian(Tyler Perry), who is Helen's cousin eventually become romantically involved with her. He had been on a rebound from a bad breakup and instantly related to the pain she was going through, and they bonded intimately. She was so happy for the first time that she was gradually falling in love again. All of a sudden, Charles gets shot by his vengeful client in the courtroom, and he was bed ridden for days. His money greedy mistress took all his money and abandoned him, leaving him in the care of Helen. She came back to get even with him, and she tortured him for days before forgiving him. He then realized that he must change and redemn himself.Tyler Perry also played Grand Daddy Joe, the least striking role out of the three that he played. Tamara Taylor gave a scene-stealing performance as Brian's drug addict wife on the road to recovery. The sexy hunk Shemar Moore had some touching and romantic moments with Elise, and he's come a long way since The Young and The Rest. The gospel singing scene was very spiritually empowering. This film really delivered the message of only through the power of God can help you forgive sometimes.",4,Kimberly Elise is Good When She's Mad.,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2299,"['Recently', 'saw', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Woman', 'Thou', 'Art', 'Loose', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'performance', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'perfect', 'star', 'showcase', 'vehicle', 'Elise', 'demonstrate', 'dramatic', 'range', 'performance', 'shed', 'bucket', 'tears', 'get', 'mad', 'get', 'even', 'nasty', 'husband', 'forgive', 'let', 'go', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'film', 'instantly', 'reminded', 'Angela', 'Bassette', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'funnier', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'was', 'totally', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'Madea', 'comic', 'relief', 'touching', 'dramedy.Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Helen', 'loving', 'housewife', 'humiliated', 'kicked', 'out', 'self-center', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'Charles/Steve', 'Harris', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'married', '18', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'secretly', 'having', 'relationship', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'two', 'kids', 'Helen', 'had', 'been', 'mistreated', 'great', 'deal', 'even', 'had', 'two', 'miscarriages', 'was', 'devastated', 'had', 'go', 'stay', 'tough', 'fierce', 'grandmother', 'Madea', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'took', 'back', 'husband', 'mansion', 'did', 'serious', 'damage', 'place', 'got', 'arrested.Orlando', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'friend', 'Brian', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'who', 'Helen', 'cousin', 'eventually', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'had', 'been', 'rebound', 'bad', 'breakup', 'instantly', 'related', 'pain', 'was', 'going', 'bonded', 'intimately', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'gradually', 'falling', 'love', 'again', 'sudden', 'Charles', 'shot', 'vengeful', 'client', 'courtroom', 'was', 'bed', 'ridden', 'days', 'money', 'greedy', 'mistress', 'took', 'money', 'abandoned', 'leaving', 'care', 'Helen', 'came', 'back', 'get', 'even', 'tortured', 'days', 'forgiving', 'then', 'realized', 'must', 'change', 'redemn', 'himself.Tyler', 'Perry', 'also', 'played', 'Grand', 'Daddy', 'Joe', 'least', 'striking', 'role', 'three', 'played', 'Tamara', 'Taylor', 'gave', 'scene-stealing', 'performance', 'Brian', 'drug', 'wife', 'road', 'recovery', 'sexy', 'hunk', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'had', 'touching', 'romantic', 'moments', 'Elise', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Young', 'Rest', 'gospel', 'singing', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'spiritually', 'empowering', 'film', 'really', 'delivered', 'message', 'only', 'power', 'God', 'can', 'help', 'forgive', 'sometimes']",N/A

You will love the script that is very well written by Tyler Perry.You have this woman (Helen) who is abused physically and mentally by a Black Attorney of the Year in Atlanta. He is rich. You will love the mansion. What a mansion! Helen is kicked out for a white woman who he is secretly courting with his kids. In the process, the Uhaul driver is Shemar Moore's character who also works at a steel mill.Ironically, Helen is very forgiving and lets him have his way in the divorce proceedings. But she really has not moved on. Shemar Moore loves her, woos her, and proposes to her. He like her has been left by another person in a marriage (a NFL football star). You will like how she finds out she is engaged. I can't spoil it, so you must watch and find out: Very unconventional but sweet.And then the un-expected happens to the Attorney character. His demons catches up with him in the form of an old Afro-American male friend. And the Attorney is left in a coma.Christine, his new love of his life, wants him to be allowed to die for obvious reasons. But Helen comes to the hospital as the wife to fight for his life, after being interrupted in the midst of a proposal by a news report of the attorney on tv. This leaves the proposal in limbo because she decides to be a good christian and help his get back on his feet. And comes a lot of anger and it is psycho-tic like, scary, but he asked for it from Helen.In the midst, he changes his life 360 degrees and see who his real friends are and who really loves him, beyond just the marriage/affair situation. He gives his life to Christ. Repents for all the things he has done. Helen repents also for her mini-rage. So at the end you cannot really tell who Helen will marry. Trust me, unless someone has already told you the ending, you will not know who she will be with. And so I leave you with this clift hanger to watch the film!",5,"The Best Black Film since ""Waiting to Exhale""",1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,1981,"[""'Diary"", 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'African-American', 'film', ""'Waiting"", 'Exhale', 'will', 'love', 'script', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Tyler', 'Perry.You', 'have', 'woman', 'Helen', 'who', 'abused', 'physically', 'mentally', 'Black', 'Attorney', 'Year', 'Atlanta', 'rich', 'will', 'love', 'mansion', 'What', 'mansion', 'Helen', 'kicked', 'out', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'secretly', 'courting', 'kids', 'process', 'Uhaul', 'driver', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'steel', 'mill.Ironically', 'Helen', 'very', 'forgiving', 'have', 'way', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'really', 'not', 'moved', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'been', 'left', 'person', 'marriage', 'NFL', 'football', 'star', 'will', 'like', 'how', 'engaged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'must', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'Very', 'unconventional', 'sweet.And', 'then', 'un-expected', 'happens', 'Attorney', 'character', 'demons', 'up', 'form', 'old', 'Afro-American', 'male', 'friend', 'Attorney', 'left', 'coma.Christine', 'new', 'love', 'life', 'be', 'allowed', 'die', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Helen', 'hospital', 'wife', 'fight', 'life', 'being', 'interrupted', 'midst', 'proposal', 'news', 'report', 'attorney', 'tv', 'proposal', 'limbo', 'be', 'good', 'christian', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'lot', 'anger', 'psycho-tic', 'scary', 'asked', 'Helen.In', 'midst', 'life', '360', 'degrees', 'see', 'who', 'real', 'friends', 'are', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'marriage/affair', 'situation', 'life', 'Christ', 'Repents', 'things', 'done', 'Helen', 'repents', 'also', 'mini-rage', 'So', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'tell', 'who', 'Helen', 'will', 'marry', 'Trust', 'someone', 'already', 'told', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'leave', 'clift', 'hanger', 'watch', 'film']",N/A
