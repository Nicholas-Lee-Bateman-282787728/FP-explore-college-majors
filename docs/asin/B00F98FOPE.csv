Testament of Love is a low-budget film, and it shows. It continues 5 years after RJ and Chris were caught being intimate while they were supposed to convert people to the Mormon faith. It begins with RJ talking about his love for Chris and what happened before Chris cut him off. There are some nice scenes as well as some not-so-nice ones. I especially love the romantic- and humorous scenes. One of my favourite scenes is when RJ travelled from Seattle to Salt Lake City to see Chris. They had an interesting conversation. It was funny to watch Chris walk so confidently from the motel to his car after he'd just been discovered by his wife without knowing. I laughed when RJ said he didn't know what he was doing in Chris's house, that his coming out was a a family affair. Look for the scene where they were celebrating Chris's dad's anniversary 'cause it is special. I love what happens after RJ arrives. I just think the director didn't end the movie well.",3,The things RJ did for love,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1076,"['watched', 'first', 'part', 'Falls', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'So', 'as', 'soon', 'could', 'watch', 'second', 'part', 'did', 'Testament', 'Love', 'low-budget', 'film', '5', 'years', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'were', 'caught', 'being', 'intimate', 'were', 'supposed', 'convert', 'people', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'RJ', 'talking', 'love', 'Chris', 'what', 'happened', 'Chris', 'cut', 'off', 'are', 'nice', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'not-so-nice', 'ones', 'especially', 'love', 'romantic-', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'One', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'when', 'RJ', 'travelled', 'Seattle', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'see', 'Chris', 'had', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'was', 'funny', 'watch', 'Chris', 'walk', 'so', 'confidently', 'motel', 'car', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'discovered', 'wife', 'knowing', 'laughed', 'when', 'RJ', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Chris', 'house', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'family', 'affair', 'Look', 'scene', 'where', 'were', 'celebrating', 'Chris', 'dad', 'anniversary', 'special', 'love', 'what', 'RJ', 'just', 'think', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'movie', 'well']",The Falls: Testament of Love

Life does not end at the end of a movie.Ferruci is the best of the lot; I was entirely shocked to find that his supposedly &#34;straight Mormon&#34; boyfriend had shaved his genitals for the only brief frontal nudity scene!

Needless to say, I ordered it immediately and I was not disappointed.  As in the first movie, this one is excellently acted by supreme artists and it is powerfully written and directed by Jon Garcia, who just got it better the second time around.  Sequels rarely live up to the original but this is the exception here.  It was absolutely superb and surpassed my expectations.  There were many tears shed watching this film because it speaks to so many people, not just gay people, but to everyone on so many different levels.  One can identify with all of the major characters to some degree or another.  The acting is truly superb which is so rare for a low budget gay film.  The sound is a lot better this time around than the first.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The whole film is riveting because one is rooting for everyone....all the characters make one feel love, betrayal, pain, denial, sorrow, hope.  Kudos to Mr. Garcia, Mr. Ferrucci, and Mr. Farmer for not disappointing this viewer who fell in love with the first movie and is even more in love with the second movie.  If there is a third, I will be indeed be buying it...and sharing it.

1670789,A3JYAX8BP7W3D2,B00F98FOPE,Drew Odom,"[14, 15]","The Falls is an affecting, touching film despite its flaws.  The script at times is creaky.  Some of the acting, especially the part of R.J.'s father, is unconvincing.  Certain scenes, even important ones, don't work because they are under realized, not carefully enough thought through.  Yet enough does work in it that it succeeds in being a better movie than many low budget gay films have been.  It has an emotional conviction running through it, a seriousness, that sustains it.  And some moments in it, even what might seem to be relatively unimportant ones, like that of the two guys riding the bus, looking at each other, being affectionate, glow with feeling.The sequel, The Falls:  Testament of Love, is a better movie.  Though it is also marred, it is more emotionally complex, the script is tighter and more purposeful, and, perhaps in part because of the larger cast, it is better acted.  R.J. Smith, in a sense the movie's &#34;frame,&#34; or at least the character who begins and ends the film and upon occasion serves as its narrator, is still stolidly, monochromatically acted.  Most of the time, he appears stonily glum.  His boyfriend Paul is so much more animated and emotionally alive and responsive, that one might wonder what he sees in R.J. who responds to him often so coldly.R.J. is the film's biggest problem.  His love for Chris appears almost obsessional, troubled and troubling.  His trip to Salt Lake City, what he does there, are disturbing, just a few steps away from his turning into a stalker.  It is unclear, at least to me, whether the film itself sees how excessively, and obsessionally, he is behaving, though by the end, in Chris's statement that &#34;he forgives him,&#34; one gains a clarity that might have been shown earlier if R.J. had been acted with more subtlety.  I am not judging R.J.  He does what he does.  I am just wondering if his character, the troubling side of it, is sufficiently portrayed, if he couldn't have been made less stiff and more emotionally conflicted, more self aware.  He doesn't seem to know how bizarrely he is behaving, as when, just to offer one instance, he insinuates himself into staying overnight at Chris's and his wife's home.One can say, of course, that he does what he does out of his love for Chris, to free him from his internal crisis by forcing him to admit that he is gay both to himself and to others.  Yet his way of doing so at times borders on craziness, the lover in pursuit of his beloved no matter what, the selfish lover in short.  Does the film see this?  Or is it just me?  I don't know.The complexity I miss in R.J. is, however, much more fully present in Chris.  Benjamin Farmer's performance of the character in the sequel is far more interesting than it was in the earlier film.  His inner struggle, his suffering, his anger, the ways in which his closetedness endangers his life and lives of others, all these and other emotions are visible at times merely in his eyes.  It is sensitive work that carries the film over its rougher moments.Much of the supporting cast is also good, Chris's wife in particular, and some of the minor characters, like Aaron, another closeted and married former missionary, have scenes that are more convincing and resonant than any moments in the earlier movie.  A few of the actors are still weak.  R.J.'s father remains insufficiently depicted, for instance.  But, since this is largely Chris's movie, it succeeds much more consistently than The Falls.Of course, this is still a low budget movie, and moments in it betray that fact.  The anniversary party looks to have been attended by about ten people, even though it means to fill a large hall.  It is clear that much of it was filmed in the same location.  There are gaps in the plot's logic that I can't elaborate upon here without giving away too much.  The ending feels to me too tacked on, its openness less a gesture toward a more generous future than uncertain about who these two main characters, said to love each other, might be and become.  Such uncertainty, one might say, is true to life.  Fine.  But the ending nonetheless strikes me as abrupt.Still, like its predecessor, the movie carries with it real conviction.  The best of Testament of Love is far better than the earlier film, better acted, much better written, and better shot.  It is a stronger movie, serious in ways that far too many low budget gay movies don't aspire to be.  Though it is flawed as well, it is even more moving, and what it is concerned with goes much deeper.  The movie's religious themes, if often still superficial, nonetheless give it a resonance it would lack without them.  But the heart of it doesn't lie in them.  That is fortunate, I think.  This is not Bresson we are watching, after all.  It lies in the relationship between the two men.At least one person in that relationship must dig deep inside himself to endure, to save himself and to love others, in particular to love a man openly and freely.  One might wish at the end, perhaps, that the man he has loved and apparently loves still, R.J., had reached as deeply inside himself as Chris must do, to find himself as clearly (however differently) as Chris has begun to.  It's an uneven film, then, yet, despite its small and not so small failures, moving and worth seeing.",4,Better than The Falls,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,5321,"['Falls', 'affecting', 'touching',

This is a sequel, and you need to have seen The Falls first. Therefore, I won't waste time telling who RJ and Chris are and what happened between them in the past.I suspect that most fans of The Falls are going to love this one too, so you may want to stop reading now and just see the movie. It continues the gay Mormon theme of the original in a different setting.It's five years later. Chris is back in Salt Lake, has been reabsorbed into Mormonism, has turned hetero through therapy and self-control, is making oodles of moolah as a pharma rep, is happily married and has a daughter.RJ has not returned to Mormonism (although he still wears the underwear and believes most of the teachings), has a dreamboat lover named Paul who adores him, and is making ends meet writing for a magazine in Seattle.RJ and Chris meet again for the first time at Rodney the stoner's funeral. RJ dumps Paul (a real catch and played by the best actor in either movie) and goes to Salt Lake to get Chris back. Much drama ensues. I'll stop there.I LOVED The Falls - it was SO much better than the highly overrated Latter Days. But I have three problems with the sequel.First, it adds nothing significant to the original, just recycles the same angst in a new town. Maybe gay Mormons need an endless series of Star Wars-like sequels and prequels, but this non-Mormon gay has had enough of it already.Second, there's no believable attraction between RJ and Chris this time. It's compulsive, not erotic at all. Not one spark. Totally unbelievable, unless both guys are so neurotic now that they will do anything to be miserable. (Besides, the guy who plays Chris has gotten creepy looking - really weird eyes like a lizard).Third, this sequel has the gall to set up for yet ANOTHER sequel, just as The Empire Strikes Back did.

Or perhaps its better to say that RJ and Chris have not treated themselves or others very well in the five years since they returned from a road trip that was inspired by tales from a friend they meet while seeking converts on their mission.At the end of the road trip, Chris decides he needs treatment to become and &#34;ex-gay&#34; mormon and live a &#34;normal&#34; life which includes marriage and starting a family.RJ now writes for a magazine and has a boy friend who has met his parents.Everything goes down hill for both RJ and Chris when they are tenatively reunited at a friend's funeral.RJ becomes a man driven by a need to know why Chris abandoned him five years ago without even saying goodbye. Chris doesn't want to provide any answers; so RJ breaks up with his boyfriend - wanting some time apart to resolve some &#34;issues.&#34; At least RJ's boyfriend has enough common sense to tell him &#34;I'm not waiting for you.&#34;RJ and Chris eventually reunite in the bedroom; forcing Chris to make some hard choices and attempt to straighten out the sheer mess he made not only of his life, but his wife's, daughter's, and family's lives as well.Are RJ and Chris reunited by the end of this movie? Now, now gentle readers, that would be telling. I will say that director and writer John Garcia has done an excellent job and has done something that is rare, a sequel that outshines the original.I suspect that there is a third movie waiting to tell the further story of RJ's and Chris' lives. Hopefully John Garcia will tell it.Highly Recommended!Five Stars!Postscript: I received some inquries about whether or not I remained in contact with Elders Dalahanse and Butler. Sadly no. While my goal was to learn more about the Mormon faith since I enjoy studying religions, their joint goal was to convert me; though I do hope they enjoyed our weekly conversations. I will say - and hopefully this won't get them in trouble - that Elders Dalahanse and Butler once shocked me by ordering a hot chocolate at the Barnes and Noble cafe. Something that I thought was one of the forbidden foods for the Mormon Faith. I also suspect that President Green probably discouraged them from remaining in contact with me. It's very rare that the President of a Mormon Temple feels the need to personally interact with the individual who has been discussing the faith with two of his Elders. I don't think I was what President Green was expecting...a Jew who was comfortable discussing various world religions...LOL...[And I doubt that President Green would approve of me having watched these two outstanding movies.]",5,"A Riveting, Outstanding Sequel",1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,2983,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', '34', 'Falls', 'Testament', 'Love', '34', 'released', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'Pictures.', '34', 'Falls', 'Testament', 'Love', '34', 'unexpected', 'sequel', '34', 'Falls', '34', 'semi-tragic', 'romance', 'former', 'Mormon', 'missionaries', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'five', 'years', 'interrupted', 'mission', 'love', 'affair.Life', 'not', 'treated', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'very', 'well', 'perhaps', 'better', 'say', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'have', 'not', 'treated', 'others', 'very', 'well', 'five', 'years', 'returned', 'road', 'trip', 'was', 'inspired', 'tales', 'friend', 'meet', 'seeking', 'converts', 'mission.At', 'end', 'road', 'trip', 'Chris', 'treatment', 'become', '34', 'ex-gay', '34', 'mormon', 'live', '34', 'normal', '34', 'life', 'marriage', 'starting', 'family.RJ', 'now', 'magazine', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'met', 'parents.Everything', 'down', 'hill', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'when', 'are', 'tenatively', 'reunited', 'friend', 'funeral.RJ', 'man', 'driven', 'need', 'know', 'why', 'Chris', 'abandoned', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'want', 'provide', 'answers', 'so', 'RJ', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'wanting', 'time', 'apart', 'resolve', '34', 'issues.', '34', 'least', 'RJ', 'boyfriend', 'enough', 'common', 'sense', 'tell', '34', ""'m"", 'not', 'waiting', 'you.', '34', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'eventually', 'bedroom', 'forcing', 'Chris', 'make', 'hard', 'choices', 'attempt', 'straighten', 'out', 'sheer', 'mess', 'made', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'family', 'lives', 'well.Are', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'reunited', 'end', 'movie', 'Now', 'now', 'gentle', 'readers', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'will', 'say', 'director', 'writer', 'John', 'Garcia', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'done', 'something', 'rare', 'sequel', 'original.I', 'suspect', 'third', 'movie', 'waiting', 'tell', 'further', 'story', 'RJ', 'Chris', 'lives', 'Hopefully', 'John', 'Garcia', 'will', 'tell', 'it.Highly', 'Recommended', 'Five', 'Stars', 'Postscript', 'received', 'inquries', 'not', 'remained', 'contact', 'Elders', 'Dalahanse', 'Butler', 'Sadly', 'goal', 'was', 'learn', 'more', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'enjoy', 'studying', 'religions', 'joint', 'goal', 'was', 'convert', 'do', 'hope', 'enjoyed', 'weekly', 'conversations', 'will', 'say', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'trouble', 'Elders', 'Dalahanse', 'Butler', 'once', 'shocked', 'ordering', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'cafe', 'Something', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'forbidden', 'foods', 'Mormon', 'Faith', 'also', 'suspect', 'President', 'Green', 'probably', 'discouraged', 'remaining', 'contact', 'very', 'rare', 'President', 'Mormon', 'Temple', 'need', 'personally', 'interact', 'individual', 'who', 'been', 'discussing', 'faith', 'two', 'Elders', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'what', 'President', 'Green', 'was', 'expecting', 'Jew', 'who', 'was', 'comfortable', 'discussing', 'various', 'world', 'religions', 'LOL', '[', 'doubt', 'President', 'Green', 'would', 'approve', 'having', 'watched', 'two', 'outstanding', 'movies', ']']",The Falls: Testament of Love

I really cared for the struggles that these two men go through. They hurt, they deal with heavy questions and they resolve their issues. I was impressed with the beauty of this movie.

1670800,A20R44GC750MIO,B00F98FOPE,"Michael Soros ""bronzebus34""","[0, 0]","In the first film The Falls, the producer made no bones of the fact that it was made on a shoestring. Despite that admission it was remarkably well made and proved that low-budget does not equal low quality. Another point is that sequels in Hollywood land generally mean another chance to rehash the first film and make even more money at it. In this case that was obviously not the motivation. Anyone who has seen Yossi (as the sequel to Yossi and Jagger) will know that sequels can stand on their own merits. This film builds on the first one. The scenery is a lot plusher and the dialogue a lot more polished.Dialogue however has to be coupled with a sincere competent actor or it is just reading (I refer the reader to Leather). In this film we have competent actors able to convey the emotional turmoil that the situation demands. Because the same actors are used from the first film the director may not have had an opportunity to bring in some more authentic heavy weight actors - I'm thinking of RJ's father in this case and Chris's mother gives a fairly run of the mill performance. Thankfully they are only in supporting roles and don't have to carry a scene.In the original film, The Falls, Chris played the tense, perfect son. He also wanted to be one of the `righteous of God'. This took a back door when he discovered the pleasures of the flesh however and the two young men decide to tour for six months before returning to their new lives. Or so RJ thought. As soon as they separated, despite the closeness, Chris just disappeared. Never answered his letters, returned calls or made any attempt to contact him. They just separated. RJ decided to live as an openly gay man with a nice but rather uninspiring personal trainer. Chris rebelled in a different way and gave free reign to his internalised homophobia, married and had a child and became `one of the righteous of God'. This was after completing a course (at his father's insistence) on reparative therapy to cure him of his gayness. Unsurprisingly it was a success and the perfect life of a well paid pharmaceutical salesman followed. His life ticked all the boxes. As far as Mormon society was concerned he was on the right path to glory.Until Rodney, the pot smoking Iraqi veteran died and they were both invited to attend the funeral. They had both kept in touch with him in varying degrees. Both attend but Chris presents a wall of stone and, apart from the bare minimum civilities that the situation calls for, he says nothing and reveals nothing - apart from the fact that he is `cured' , married with a child and hopes RJ follows likewise. They part awkwardly. On his return to Seattle, RJ asks his partner to separate for a while as he has things to sort out. He decides to return to Salt Lake City to confront Chris. And that is where the journey for Chris begins. Because it is really about Chris's journey both psychologically, spiritually and emotionally.It is at this point too that some issues are raised:Does RJ have the right to barge like a bowling ball back into the life of someone he last saw 5 years ago? Does he have the right to break up a family? Who gave him that right? Is he being emotionally torn apart? You don't get that impression. The trauma seems all one sided as RJ has nothing to lose. His life and job are safe back in Seattle -it is Chris who is forcefully presented with a fait accompli. It is his family which is drawn into the unfolding drama. The film presents these issues - and not in black and white terms. There are a lot of grey borders and the characters reflect these ambiguities. The emotional state of Chris's wife at her situation is very well played. She doesn't care if he is gay but does not want to be abandoned.To go on would need a spoiler alert before every line. Suffice to say that this film is well worth watching if you are interested in these issues. For me the issues are largely academic as I was never in such a situation but it is well known that most gay men are in fact married and either internalise that homophobia and join the extreme right wing politically or a fundamentalist religion. Many Muslim men enforce the rules of their religion strictly to keep the wife as far from them as possible all in the name of being `one of the Righteous of the Lord' - so it is a burning issue for some.",5,Excellent follow up to The Falls and much improved production,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,4337,"['first', 'film', 'Falls', 'producer', 'made', 'bones', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'admission', 'was', 'remarkably', 'well', 'made', 'proved', 'low-budget', 'not', 'equal', 'low', 'quality', 'point', 'sequels', 'Hollywood', 'land', 'generally', 'chance', 'rehash', 'first', 'film', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'case', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'motivation', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Yossi', 'sequel', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', 'will', 'know', 'sequels', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'scenery', 'lot', 'plusher', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'more', 'polished.Dialogue', 'however', 'be', 'coupled', 'sincere', 'competent', 'actor', 'just', 'reading', 'refer', 'reader', 'Leather', 'film', 'have', 'competent', 'actors', 'able', 'convey', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'situation', 'same', 'actors', 'are', 'used', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'more', 'authentic', 'heavy', 'weight', 'actors', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'RJ', 'father', 'case', 'Chris', 'mother', 'fairly', 'run', 'mill', 'performance', 'Thankfully', 'are', 'only', 'supporting', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'carry', 'scene.In', 'original', 'film', 'Falls', 'Chris', 'played', 'tense', 'perfect', 'son', 'also', 'wanted', 'be', 'one', 'righteous', 'God', 'took', 'back', 'door', 'when', 'discovered', 'pleasures', 'flesh', 'however', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'decide', 'tour', 'six', 'months', 'returning', 'new', 'lives', 'so', 'RJ', 'thought', 'As', 'soon', 'separated', 'closeness', 'Chris', 'just', 'disappeared', 'Never', 'answered', 'letters', 'returned', 'calls', 'made', 'attempt', 'contact', 'just', 'separated', 'RJ', 'decided', 'live', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'nice', 'rather', 'uninspiring', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Chris', 'rebelled', 'different', 'way', 'gave', 'free', 'reign', 'internalised', 'homophobia', 'married', 'had', 'child', 'became', 'one', 'righteous', 'God', 'was', 'completing', 'course', 'father', 'insistence', 'reparative', 'therapy', 'cure', 'gayness', 'was', 'success', 'perfect', 'life', 'well', 'paid', 'pharmaceutical', 'salesman', 'followed', 'life', 'ticked', 'boxes', 'As', 'far', 'Mormon', 'society', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'right', 'path', 'glory.Until', 'Rodney', 'pot', 'smoking', 'Iraqi', 'veteran', 'died', 'were', 'invited', 'attend', 'funeral', 'had', 'kept', 'touch', 'varying', 'degrees', 'attend', 'Chris', 'wall', 'stone', 'apart', 'bare', 'minimum', 'civilities', 'situation', 'nothing', 'reveals', 'nothing', 'apart', 'fact', 'cured', 'married', 'child', 'RJ', 'likewise', 'part', 'awkwardly', 'return', 'Seattle', 'RJ', 'partner', 'separate', 'while', 'things', 'sort', 'out', 'return', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'confront', 'Chris', 'where', 'journey', 'Chris', 'begins', 'really', 'Chris', 'journey', 'psychologically', 'spiritually', 'emotionally.It', 'point', 'too', 'issues', 'are', 'raised', 'Does', 'RJ', 'have', 'right', 'barge', 'bowling', 'ball', 'back', 'life', 'someone', 'last', 'saw', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'right', 'break', 'up', 'family', 'Who', 'gave', 'right', 'being', 'emotionally', 'torn', 'apart', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'trauma', 'one', 'sided', 'RJ', 'nothing', 'lose', 'life', 'job', 'are', 'safe', 'back', 'Seattle', '-it', 'Chris', 'who', 'forcefully', 'presented', 'fait', 'accompli', 'family', 'drawn', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'film', 'issues', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'terms', 'are', 'lot', 'grey', 'borders', 'characters', 'reflect', 'ambiguities', 'emotional', 'state', 'Chris', 'wife', 'situation', 'very', 'well', 'played', ""n't"", 'care', 'gay', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'abandoned.To', 'go', 'would', 'need', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'line', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'interested', 'issues', 'issues', 'are', 'largely', 'academic', 'was', 'never', 'such', 'situation', 'well', 'known', 'most', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'fact', 'married', 'internalise', 'homophobia', 'join', 'extreme', 'right', 'wing', 'politically', 'fundamentalist', 'religion', 'Many', 'Muslim', 'men', 'enforce', 'rules', 'religion', 'strictly', 'keep', 'wife', 'far', 'possible', 'name', 'being', 'one', 'Righteous', 'Lord', 'burning', 'issue']",The Falls: Testament of Love

I tried watching this in a rather bad mood, in this case, very bad move! The outcome was bittersweet and heartbreaking, my question is, will there be a third chapter? In the start  I was kinda angry with Chris, esp. with how he treated RJ. Even though I haven't given it a 2nd viewing...yet, I've analyzed Chris' behavior more carefully and can empathize with him and his issues easier. The church, his family and society shoved him back in his closet, forcing him to reject his true sexuality, and attempt to be ""normal"". After a reviewing, I will elaborate more.Update:3-29-14)For those who read my initial review, I won't erase it, this update is also a revision. Yes, Chris made me angry at the start, but his tune quickly changed after his feelings for Rj were rekindled. Chris' family, with little exception made me angrier, refusing to accept the truth, but I liked how Rj's father put Chris' father in his place, trying to be tactful, but bluntly honest. This time, the ending made me cry, because in some ways, been there, done that: my first girlfriend/fiancee, was not my attempt at converting from gay to straight, but actually proved what I've pretty much known my whole life, I'm actually bisexual. I didn't expect to fall in love with her, and neither did she, but it happened, but two many things went wrong, and we had to break up, but what tears me up is why it couldn't have been more civilized and respectful. That I do regret. I wasn't co-erced or pushed into starting a relationship with her, but we discovered we were better matched as friends. I understood why the ending happened that way, but it reminded me a little of my recent situation, without all the strings.

The movie reinforces my belief that independent cinema comes from a place that more commercial ventures have abandoned, that place being &#34;reality.&#34; I was surprised, watching the director and cast interviews on the DVD extras, that Mormons (or ex-Mormons, perhaps) were not a part of the script or cast: the result of a perfect screenplay.

That I had to be informed of this fact by the Q&A; feature is a credit to Jon Garcia and the cast.  When a film is this great--with a truly gripping story and excellent performers--time just flies effortlessly.The danger of doing a sequel is more about not living up to the viewers' imagined continuation of the story than it is about just making a poor film.  At the end of The Falls, I was left wanting more and I created my own plausible story.  Testament of Love far surpassed what I ever would have imaged. This sequel can also stand on its own as a film if the viewer did not see the original.  Enough of the backstory is woven into Testament of Love so that no viewer will feel lost.The original film was about forbidden romance and coming of age within the structure of religion.  The sequel is about the truth. An important loose end--the question:  what happened with Rodney?-- is resolved early in the film and drives all that is to come, is the death of Rodney.  Rodney's funeral brings Chris and RJ back together after 5 long years without contact.  Also Rodney's message from The Falls--to live a little--is the inspiration for all that happens.The truth is front and center when RJ returns from Rodney's funeral and will not say ""I love you"" back to Paul, his current boyfriend.  RJ later breaks up with Paul as an act of honesty.  The actor portraying Paul gives an especially fine and nuanced performance.  Paul's facial expressions say so much.Much of the rest of the film follows Chris as he works to catch up to his own truth.  With RJ's provocation, Chris is forced to think about the lies he is living.  RJ arrives in Salt Lake City and lands on Chris's doorstep.  This sets up a chain of events that finally leads to resolution for everyone, including Chris's parents.After repeated viewings, I have to say Testament of Love is one of my all time favorite films.  Everything is better about the sequel then the original.  Acting and production values are far better in this sequel, but it is still the story that grabs me and won't let go.So even after two hours I was left wanting more.  Hopefully, that means another sequel in which Chris uses that plane ticket to Seattle.  I think a wedding is in order and maybe adoption...and maybe both Chris and RJ can dedicate their lives to working to make sure young gay people never contemplate suicide.",5,One of the best gay love stories ever made,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,2456,"['Only', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'did', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'had', 'be', 'informed', 'fact', 'Q', 'A', 'feature', 'credit', 'Jon', 'Garcia', 'cast', 'When', 'film', 'great', 'truly', 'gripping', 'story', 'excellent', 'performers', 'time', 'just', 'effortlessly.The', 'danger', 'doing', 'sequel', 'more', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'viewers', 'imagined', 'continuation', 'story', 'about', 'just', 'making', 'poor', 'film', 'end', 'Falls', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'created', 'own', 'plausible', 'story', 'Testament', 'Love', 'far', 'surpassed', 'what', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'imaged', 'sequel', 'can', 'also', 'stand', 'own', 'film', 'viewer', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'Enough', 'backstory', 'woven', 'Testament', 'Love', 'viewer', 'will', 'feel', 'lost.The', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'coming', 'age', 'structure', 'religion', 'sequel', 'truth', 'important', 'loose', 'end', 'question', 'what', 'happened', 'Rodney', 'resolved', 'early', 'film', 'come', 'death', 'Rodney', 'Rodney', 'funeral', 'brings', 'Chris', 'RJ', 'back', 'together', '5', 'long', 'years', 'contact', 'Also', 'Rodney', 'message', 'Falls', 'live', 'little', 'inspiration', 'happens.The', 'truth', 'front', 'center', 'when', 'RJ', 'Rodney', 'funeral', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'love', 'back', 'Paul', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'RJ', 'later', 'up', 'Paul', 'act', 'honesty', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Paul', 'especially', 'fine', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Paul', 'facial', 'expressions', 'say', 'so', 'much.Much', 'rest', 'film', 'Chris', 'catch', 'up', 'own', 'truth', 'RJ', 'provocation', 'Chris', 'forced', 'think', 'lies', 'living', 'RJ', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Chris', 'doorstep', 'up', 'chain', 'events', 'finally', 'resolution', 'everyone', 'including', 'Chris', 'parents.After', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'have', 'say', 'Testament', 'Love', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'Everything', 'better', 'sequel', 'then', 'original', 'Acting', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'sequel', 'still', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.So', 'even', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'Hopefully', 'sequel', 'Chris', 'plane', 'ticket', 'Seattle', 'think', 'wedding', 'order', 'maybe', 'adoption', 'maybe', 'Chris', 'RJ', 'can', 'dedicate', 'lives', 'working', 'make', 'sure', 'young', 'gay', 'people', 'never', 'contemplate', 'suicide']",The Falls: Testament of Love
