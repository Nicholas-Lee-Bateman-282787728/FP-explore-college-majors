1640742,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BXRVQO8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[32, 33]","While I have an undeniable soft spot in my heart for the flesh eating undead, the zombie genre has been a bit overworked lately with projects (whether in film, TV, or books) of varying degrees of quality. Let's face it, the walking dead are everywhere! I'm certainly not complaining, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to find entertainment that still feels fresh and vital.  So if you're looking for something a little different, look no further than ""In The Flesh.""  This three part miniseries for the BBC takes a familiar concept and completely reworks the genre.  Less a horror thriller than a social commentary, this domestic drama examines a world in which zombies return to a cognitive state and attempt to return to society.  But is the world ready to cohabitate with this perceived threat?The premise behind ""In The Flesh"" is pretty dazzling in its audacity.  Forgiveness, retribution, prejudice, and loyalty are all concepts that face a small Lancashire village still haunted by the zombie apocalypse.  Set several years after a devastating outbreak, internment camps have been set up where zombies are being treated and rehabilitated by modern medicine and psychology.  Brilliantly, they are said to be suffering from PDS (Partially Deceased Syndrome)!  At the start of the show, we meet Kieren (an understated and effective Luke Newberry).  Keiren is plagued by remembrances of his zombie past and is reticent about rejoining his family.  There are still plenty of bad feelings in this tiny town and the civilian militia refuses to disband in this area.  To them, the only good zombie is a dead one!""In The Flesh,"" thus, poses a moral question that serves as a parable for our troubled past.  When hate trumps compassion, what does that say about the future of our society?  There are plenty of parallels to be drawn in the film's screenplay between the intolerance shown to the zombies and to other groups who have been victimized by prejudice.  The message becomes a bit heavy handed at times and the militia (who were heroes at one time) are painted in fairly broad and unsympathetic strokes, but this is a show with a heart and a brain.  There is also the presence of rebellion, zombies who don't want to be relegated to second hand status.  But don't worry.  It's not a sweeping political allegory or condemnation, it succeeds as a very personal story sold by a very capable cast.  By the end, I was swept up in Kieren's story and found the resolution to have power and punch that really made me feel something.I was so fascinated by ""In The Flesh"" that I watched it straight through from beginning to end.  Fans of gore, carnage, and non-stop action may not be entirely captivated if they expect a conventional zombie tale.  The action set pieces are well orchestrated, however.  ""In The Flesh"" aspires to and achieves so much more as searing personal drama.  It's not perfect, as I mentioned, but it is different and ambitious.  Dealing with a town gripped by fear and uncertainty, the film plays like an existential debate about life, death and everything in between.  Past loyalties are tested, and characters must come to grips with the brave new world.  But the road to redemption and understanding is never easy, and plenty of unexpected tragedy will unfold before the final scenes.  In only three episodes, this could have benefited from even more time.  But I really appreciated this different take on a well-worn concept.  4 1/2 stars.

Oh, I love zombies, but we have seen more zombie flicks and works of fiction since The Walking Dead hit screens in 2010. And you know something, if I was 13 when that show premiered, I probably would have loved it, but I was a grumpy 19 year old and I hated it. And now four years later, I've finally cut my teeth on BBC Three's brilliant new sleeper hit and a show that is on its way to becoming a huge phenomenon, In the Flesh. And man, a lot of the zombies here are (understandably) grumpy too, but that's besides the point. I'll admit that having heard about the whole concept and having caught the last ten minutes of a recent episode on the Space Channel here in Canada, that's when I finally gave in.In the Flesh is an absolutely brilliant zombie series that is something so much more. The show doesn't think you're stupid, it's very rich in character and has absolutely brilliant performances, the story is compelling and it doesn't throw unnecessary gore at the screen to keep you awake. It's a drama, first and foremost, and a compelling one at that. It's also sadly very relevant to today's society and explores issues that are going in in the world right now with zombies as the allegory- be it for homosexuals, people of different colour, religion, etc. But most importantly is that Dominic Mitchell shifts his sole focus to the characters and he is so good at making us care about these characters. Add to that one of the best lead actors in years, Luke Newberry, and you have a show that deserves to be a major hit.The story revolves around 24 year old Kieren Walker. He is a zombie, one of the many who rose from the dead in an apocalyptic event called &#34;the rising&#34;. He's a handsome, soft-spoken and conservative individual who took his own life 5 years back when his best friend (or was it more?) died in Afghanistan. He, and many of the other zombies are referred to as sufferers of &#34;Partially Deceased Syndrome&#34; (the politically correct version of the word &#34;zombie&#34;) and is reminded that what happened in their untreated state is not their fault. He returns to his family, and almost immediately is faced with the task of trying to make peace with them after all those years ago, when he killed himself. Adjusting to home life isn't hard at first, but it soon gets tough when he has to put up with discrimination from the townsfolk on a regular basis and is commonly referred to as a &#34;rotter&#34; (basically a fantastical n-word for zombies)... and must deal with his extreme,y zombie-phobic sister, who helped kill zombies during the rising. He meets a new friend named Amy, who herself is a PDS sufferer and begins to immerse himself into society again, but he has a lot of confronting of his own demons to do before he can allow himself to live a normal life again.This show is fantastic because it makes you think, it challenges you to consider what you would do if you were in Kieren's situation, and you can't help but feel bad for poor Kieren and want to give him a hug. So many shows nowadays try too hard by forcing cliched issues in to make you care for the characters, but Mitchell shows these characters as people who aren't exactly perfect, but are interesting in their own right. The absolutely fantastic cast helps it too- Newberry's performance is absolutely fantastic and never once over-acts or under-acts, you believe every word out of his mouth. Bevan's performance as Amy Dyer is equally charming and you can't help but love her. And even the bleak and depressing atmosphere of the show presented enhances the real sense of hopelessness and despair present throughout the show- in addition to the absolutely stellar writing from Dom Mitchell.In short, this is a new show that deserves to be a hit. As I type this, I'm all caught up and am anticipating Sunday's series 2 finale.
