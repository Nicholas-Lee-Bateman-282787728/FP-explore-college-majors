1570452,AY12DBB0U420B,B008MMONA6,Gary Peterson,"[7, 10]","I've been interested in electronica music  and the Amazon computer suggests a lot of things that it thinks I might like. About five years ago it suggested a CD by LCD Soundsystem titled ""Sound of Silver."" I took the suggestion seriously because I'd read a review in ""Rolling Stone"" and I'd already decided that this would probably be a disc I'd enjoy. I bought and I indeed liked it very much and followed up later by also purchasing (and reviewing) ""This is Happening"" and ""London Sessions."" This was just a very good band and I loved their music and  James Murphy was a terrific singer! Excellent recordings!Well, LCD Soundsystem quickly and easily worked it's way into my list of a half-dozen favorite musical acts (including deadmau5, Daft Punk and Matthew Dear) that were the highest on my playlist. Then the notice came out that they were shutting the band down. Quitting? How can this be? This is one of the freshest and best bands around and they're quitting right as they reach their peak? Say it isn't so! Well, unfortunately, it was so and they gave a final concert at Madison Square Garden (a very large boxing arena) to a near-capacity crowd last April in New York City. The 3 1/2-hour concert is now available on DVD. Well, if you're a LCD fan this package is a must-have! They call it ""Shut Up And Play The Hits"" and it makes for an outstanding three-disc DVD package. The first DVD presents selections (highlights) from the concert together with assorted scenes and interviews with James Murphy and other band members. It's quite an interesting and well-done DVD. Be sure to look over all the extras. The second and third DVDs present the entire concert. The total package is just overwhelming and is probably the best concert DVD set I own (out of about 25). It's a wonderful addition to my collection.It's a terrific concert presentation, both the short version (disc one) and the long version (discs two and three). The boxing venue turned out to be a surprisingly good setting. The concert was staged toward the center and the cameras were set both to record the activity on the stage and look out over the large audience in all directions. Well Done! The acoustics and sound quality of the recording were rather good for a live concert. I was surprised at the size of the band. There might have been about 15-20 people on stage, including the singers. I was also surprised that an emphasis was placed on actual musical instruments, in that I had the idea from the LCD CDs that the reliance was more on electronic music.The band was disbursed all over the stage, seemingly almost at random, rather than a set facing the audience as in a more normal concert-hall setting. Most of te band members had a specific setting, particularly those playing large instruments, but James Murphy wandered about the stage and the scattered musicians carrying his microphone, playing with a few instruments now and then and interacting with the audience. In his wanderings, he was then able to face most of the audience from time to time. Nice arrangement.  Murphy put on a terrific performance and demonstrated that he was an excellent multi-instrument musician. He really stood out as a percussionist! Murphy left no doubt that he was the heart and core of the LCD organization. And what a terrific singer he was. Previously, I'd only listened to him on CDs and this guy really put his everything into this concert. All of the other band members were great too and were fun to watch. Evidently there was no dress code at all. Band members were each doing their own thing and you had everything on stage from tank-top undershirts to shorts to some rather formal looking outfits. One fellow looked as if he was in audition for those Sasquatch Jerky commercials you see on TV. Murphy, himself, looked as if his haircut was about a month too old and that, somehow, he had forgotten to shave in the last week, although he was wearing a rather formal jacket (sans tie). No matter. It seemed as if everyone was relaxed and just having a really good time, and the audience responded warmly to it.The concert was both a joyous and sad experience to watch. The band was obviously having a lot of fun, but as the long concert came down to the final songs you could feel the sadness gradually set in. Very late in the concert, they played New York, I Love You, But You're Getting Me Down. It fit. Most of the songs were newly updated versions of the songs on the ""Sound of Silver"" and ""This Is Happening"" CDs, but there were a few new ones (to me, at least), including one 23-minute-long extravagenza. Then it was over.What's going to happen here? Murphy and his motley collection of musicians (but quite excellent, I would hasten to add) aren't just going to go away, Will Murphy be reincarnated in some other form? Will the other members of the band regroup and form new bands? Stay tuned.Gary Peterson",5,"A Wonderful And Joyous Concert, With a Sad Ending.",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,4898,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'interested', 'electronica', 'music', 'Amazon', 'computer',

You know it'd only be a matter of time before the entire experience would be released in DVD and/or CD format. Turns out that it's in the DVD format only (without a CD co-release).""Shut Up and Play the Hits: The Loud Ending of LCD Soundsystem"" (3 DVDs; 290 min.) brings a whole lotta music, and then some. Let me comment on what I know: I saw the movie when it was screened at selected theatres in the country a few months ago (July, 2012), here in Cincinnati at the Contemporary Arts Center, and what a great evening that turned out to be. We get to relive and spend the last 48 hrs. of James Murphy, brainchild behind and singer/songwriter of LCD, leading up to the actual MSG show itself. You may recall that in early, 2011, LCD released a live album called ""London Sessions"", which in all-but-name served as a Greatest Hits Live set. Now that we have this new release, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" should carry a tag screaming ""the really, truly, all-inclusive greatest and not-so-greatest hits live"" as the movie has all of the songs of ""London Sessions"" and then some! Beware: if you are concerned that the editing would be too ""MTV-like"" (if MTV would actually play music videos anymore), I had feared the worst, and while there certainly is plenty of angle-changing editing, it is not as bad as I suppose it could've been. As to the sound quality, it is nothing short of pristine. It sounded fantastic at the CAC screening, and yes it was LOUD.As to the extras (which I have not yet seen), there apparently are a ton of them including a documentary and a bunch of other goodies. I doubt that I will spend much time with them. Amazon is selling this set at a very fan-friendly price, so there is a great bang-for-the-buck from that side as well. I had the good fortune of seeing LCD Soundsystem in concert a number of times over the years, including a memorable set at the 2010 Coachella music fest where the massive crowd was begging the band to just keep playing at the end of their set. As memorable that was, the farewell show at the MSG is something a lil' more special. Last but not least, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" is one of the great album titles of all times, dripping with irony (since of course the band didn't have a single ""hit"" ever in the Billboard Hot 100) and reminding me of Roxette's equally memorable greatest hits album, titled ""Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus"", ha! This set of course includes ""You Wanted a Hit"", James Murphy's cry against the music industry that LCD doesn't do ""hits"". All that aside, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and a must-have for any and all LCD fans!",4,4.5 stars...
