Gammill,"[18, 23]","In the long-standing tradition of direct-to-video sequels, ARIEL'S BEGINNING continues the story of a beloved character without really adding anything new.  The music is OK, but doesn't come close to the brilliant exuberance of the original (it's telling that the most inspired musical number, ""Jump in the Line,"" was NOT written for the movie).  Likewise, the animation is well-done, but pales in comparison to the theatrically-released original.Still, young children may find enough to like about the antics of Ariel and her sisters.  As sequels go, it nowhere near as awful asThe Hunchback of Notre Dame II, but falls short of even the studio's less-celebrated theatrical releases likeHome on the Range.A brief behind-the-scenes peak at Broadway's ""The Little Mermaid"", a couple of deleted scenes, a profile of the film's director, and the requisite DVD game round out the bonus features.If you're a completist, or have young children who love The Little Mermaid, this is not a bad addition to your Disney DVD collection.",3,Pleasing but really pretty average,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,1024,"['long-standing', 'tradition', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'ARIEL', 'BEGINNING', 'story', 'beloved', 'character', 'really', 'adding', 'anything', 'new', 'music', 'OK', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'brilliant', 'exuberance', 'original', 'telling', 'most', 'inspired', 'musical', 'number', 'Jump', 'Line', 'was', 'NOT', 'written', 'movie', 'Likewise', 'animation', 'well-done', 'pales', 'comparison', 'theatrically-released', 'original.Still', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'enough', 'like', 'antics', 'Ariel', 'sisters', 'sequels', 'go', 'nowhere', 'awful', 'asThe', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'II', 'short', 'even', 'studio', 'less-celebrated', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'likeHome', 'Range.A', 'brief', 'behind-the-scenes', 'peak', 'Broadway', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'profile', 'film', 'director', 'requisite', 'DVD', 'game', 'round', 'bonus', 'features.If', ""'re"", 'completist', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'not', 'bad', 'addition', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'collection']",The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning

I truly enjoyed this movie, yes it wasnt like the original but look at all the Cinderellas they have made, they werent like the original either. Ariel's beginning was in a way like the movie Footloose, no music or dancing is allowed in the city of Atlantis because King Tritain is heartbroken. But as always, the movie has a happy ending that leaves you feeling satisfyed that all is well. As well as being introduced to Ariel's mother you also learn and see more of Ariel's sisters.

Looking at the reviews from others and based on what I viewed, we must have seen completely different films because ""The Little Mermaid- Ariel's Beginning"" was outright dull, boring and horrific. I know, I'm probably not the target audience but even my younger sister said this movie wasn't anything like the first one and even the dreadful second movie which was, like this, a direct-to-dvd release.Basically, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is The Little Mermaid mixed with ""Footloose"". It's forbidden to sing or make music in Atlantis, the kingdom ruled by Ariel's father. But alas, Ariel and company decide to take on the crown and dare to dance and spread the love of music throughout the kingdom! Yet, here's the problem- for a movie about embracing music, the actual music in the film was absolutely horrendous. This franchise, to me, is founded upon music and good songs. Even the second film had a spread of musical numbers but this? No. The few musical numbers are simply horrible and uninspired if even listenable. They even perform one song, best known from being the song featured in the final scene of 'Beetlejuice' a whopping THREE times in the film! Talk about unoriginal.What a butchering of a great franchise. So what, it's animated. Big whoop, there's nothing groundbreaking about it. Even my younger sister said this, when stacked against the other films, was by far the worse. I wouldn't waste my money on this boring, dull, uninspired drivel.

1115270,AU852OCTFL67U,B000XUOIQO,"Cam T. ""&#34;Reclusive Writer&#34;""","[0, 0]","After recently seeing the original film and its rushed-looking, mediocre-written sequel, I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.I was blown away - this is one of the best Disney Direct-to-Video sequel/prequels I've ever seen!The story starts with Ariel's childhood, and the sad death of her mother which drove King Triton into emotional trauma, unable to deal with his daughters as they grew up, banning music from Atlantica because the reminders of his wife were too painful. The story then jumps ahead to Ariel at 14 years old (two years before the original movie), and the now-silently miserable kingdom of Atlantica, with sharks working as anti-music security guards, arresting anyone who so much as dares to whistle.The daughters of Triton are being mostly raised by their nasty governess Marina Del Rey, who covets Sebastian's position in the Royal Court, and is looking for any opportunity to seize it from him. She is helped by a soft-spoken and kind-hearted narwhal (I think he's a narwhal) named Benjamin.While being punished for breaking the rules, Ariel meets a fish named Flounder, and later at night follows him to an underground club where inhabitants of Atlantica play music and dance until all hours - including a performance by Sebastian of Harry Belafonte's ""Jump in the Line"" (which some moviegoers will remember from ""Beetlejuice""), which is so lively that you can't help wanting to sing and dance along!But secrets have a way of being exposed, leading to a quest by Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian to find a special item that once belonged to her mother, in hopes of bringing change to Atlantica.The animation is well done, shaded with depth in a similar style to the first movie, and makes this a worthy entry in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" saga. (By comparison, the animation in LM2 is well drawn, but the rest of it is poorly colored and looks rushed).  I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it surpassed my expectations!

Is it worthy of a big screen release? Not necessarily; it is a low-key story, but nonetheless, a VAST improvement over some of Disney's previous direct-to-dvd movies. The story is a prequel to ""The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition),"" and explains how King Triton banned music in his kingdom when his wife was killed. We learn how Sebastian became the music conductor for King Triton, and how Ariel & Flounder met. Naturally, it is the full-of-life Ariel who helps bring music back to her father's life. Although the villain is not as fun and nasty as the legendary Ursula, Marina Del Rey (ably voiced by Sally Field) is plenty of fun as the evil governess for King Triton's daughter. Not content to be a governess, she plots to usurp Sebastian's position, even if it means getting rid of Ariel. The one odd character in the movie is Marina's sidekick, Benjamin. His style of animation looks like something out of Barney. It is particularly jarring since the animation on this film is SOOOO good! It does not look like your typical straight-to-dvd release; in fact, I would go so far as to say that it is on par with the original feature. Jodi Benson returns as the voice of Ariel. In both singing and acting, she is fantastic and totally believeable as the songstress under the sea. As Sebastian, Samuel E. Wright returns...who else could voice this classic animated character? There are seven musical numbers in the film, and the fact that it was directed by a choreographer (Peggy Holmes) is a plus. The movement of the characters in the film AND the dance numbers is fantastic.Extras are also great. 2 backstage Disney featurettes: ""Splashdance"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, hosted by director Peggy Holmes. ""The Little Mermaid: Under the Sea and Behind The Scenes On Broadway"" gives a backstage look at the Broadway musical production, featuring interviews with the cast.

Jodi Benson and Samuel Wright return as the voices of Ariel and Sebastian and Oscar-winner Sally Field in her Disney animated debut as Marina Del Rey, a villainess who is more diabolical than Ursula and Morgana put together. In this film, which takes place about 15 years before the events in the original Little Mermaid and Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea, Ariel and her six sisters are living a life of no music after her father, King Triton, made music against the law. Ariel soon learn why her dad banned music after she found a music box that was belong to her late mother, Queen Athena, and the tragic outcomes that led Ariel's dad to make such a disappointing decision. So Ariel, Sebastian, and the rest of the sea creatures set off on an adventure to restore music to Atlantica, however, Marina Del Rey, the one-time nanny to Triton's daughters, is planning to overthrow the kingdom and make it her own. The special features includes a featurette on the movie's behind-the-scenes look, deleted scenes, a Sing-A-Long feature with lyrics to clips of the film and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like Sleeping Beauty, Tinker Bell, Bolt, and Space Buddies.

I just finished watching this new Little Mermaid and I am sad to say it just wasnt as good as I had hoped for. This movie is suppoused to be all about music in Atlantic and Ariels mother so I had hoped there would be some really great songs on here but there just wasnt. The song that her Mother Athena sings she only sung for like 4-5 lines long it wasnt even a whole song which was disappointing cause it just sounded like it would have been a very good one had it been alot longer. Also Triton and Ariels song they dont even really sing its more some words of the song was said then anything and a little music. The song Ariel sings in the underground club ""I Remember"" was Good but it of course wouldnt be a favorite like ""Part of Your World"" For a review I read previously on how someone hoped for a song with the sisters, sorry to disappoint but they dont sing at all although they talk and are involved so much more in this one which was a plus for me. I guess I just expected too much for this movie it just seemed so good from the trailers which they showed about all the good parts there are anyway. There was an excellent time I thought in there for Ariel to sing a great song when she finds the music box and remembers more of her mother but to a great disappointment to me there wasnt. So to narrow it all down I loved that the sisters were more involved and talking but my biggest disappoint me was there just wasnt any Great Songs on there except the ones you dont even hear much of so that makes it pointless to listen to. Maybe they will come out with a soundtrack and it will have the whole song on there it would be great if they did but the movie just disappointed me.

Belle ""lizzabelle, English major nerd""","[1, 1]","I was extremely skeptical when I first heard about this movie, but was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended. The story is quite charming and it seems like this is one of the first sequels Disney writers gave some thought to.The basic plot summary actually is that King Triton's kingdom is alive with music until his wife, Athena is killed in an accident. He is overwhelmed by grief and music only exacerbates his pain so he bans music forever. Ariel is still the headstrong girl from the original Little Mermaid movie and is unahppy with the status quo. She meets Flounder and winds up following him to an underground club, who is run by Triton's righthand crab, Sebastian. Ariel's emotions are stirred as she is moved by the music and she begins to remember what it was like before her mother died. She brings her sisters and they are all happy again, until Triton finds out.What is nice about this movie is that instead of the usual hostile takeover theme to overthrow the king, the villian is actually after Sebastian's job. Marina Del Ray, who is a bit like Ursula without the sorcery, wants to climb the corporate ladder but has little desire to be royalty, an odd departure from the usual fairy tale faire. Her sidekick, Benjamin, who I think is a manatee, is not evil, which is also different.

It was gorgeous, it was catchy, it was imaginative...it was everything I hoped it would be and more! I loved seeing Ariel and her sisters as children with their mother and father, and I loved how the story gave them more screen time. When I was little I always wondered what the individual sisters were like. Flounder is cute and funny in this movie. I also really liked Benjamin, he's just so cute and matter-of-fact. This movie also has several scenes that pay homage to the original, such as Flounder getting stuck in a hole and Ariel pushing him out. The only thing I could complain about is that the story was so direct and simple, like a 30 minute cartoon that got extended. I'm not really sure how to put it, I don't mean it in a bad way.

This movie shows a time where the mermaid princesses' mother, Queen Athena (funny name for a mermaid) is still alive. Out of the seven daughters Triton and Athena have, Ariel looks the most like her, with just a bit of difference in hair and eye color - Athena's hair is lighter and more orange while her eyes are more green than teal.The sisters are given a bit more dimension here - they were barely given any notice in the first Little Mermaid. Their personalities become a bit more distinct - the eldest is bossy, one is a bit of a ditz, one is very friendly, etc. This made them a little more real.I was not sure how to take Athena's death. No blood or gore is shown here, all violence and pain is implied so you don't actually see Athena dying, but it is clear what happened. Apparently being hit by ships are a common danger to mermaids - just look at what happened to Ursula in the first movie. So Triton places a prohibition on music - and just like the real Prohibition of the 1920's, music is hidden, performed in private speakeasies and bars.The antagonist is not given any real depth. I would have liked to learn more of her past and motivations. Ursula or her sister are given NO mention here.I can't really recommend this film to keep as part of a collection.

1115297,A32AXWSNFE1T3H,B000XUOIQO,"mom, wife, chick","[0, 1]","My daughter absolutely LOVES Ariel and both Little Mermaid 1 & 2 so I figured this movie would be, at the very least, entertaining for her.  While she did sit through it the 1st time, when I offered to let her watch it again, she agreed but it didn't hold her interest enough for her to watch it all again (and she has seen the other 2 movies many times each!)  It just didn't hold her (or my) attention very well.  The annimation, as others have said, IS very good - nothing close to the crappy TV show so no worries about that.  The background we get about Ariel's mother is nice, albeit VERY brief...the whole movie is based on the premise that her mother was so into music that her tragic death upsets Triton so much he can't bear to have music in Atlantica anymore.  But all we get is ONE very short scene of her singing to her 7 daughters as the are put to bed.  And then yeah, we get to see Ariel's look-alike mother making out w/Triton, which IS a little creepy.  Still, you get that they really loved each other but seeing as the whole storyline is based on her love of music, I just wish we had seen more.  More scenes of the mother w/Ariel.  Maybe some mention of the fact that Ariel and her mother look exactly alike - what does that do to Triton...is this what keeps him so protective of her?  The background on the other characters is cute (Sebastian and Flounder) and the scenes at the secret nightclub are cute too but overall, the music is pretty terrible.  Most notably, the 1st song by Sally Field is pretty unbearable.  It's mainly spoken, and not musically.  Even a Jodie Benson song (can't recall the exact name) is pretty bad, which is saying a lot.  I was pretty excited about the music when I saw the short preview (which is the 1st scene in the movie, w/her mother singing her to sleep) but after this, it pretty much disappoints - sometimes badly.  The sidekick to the villianess IS out of place, although I found him to at least provide some comic relief.  As for the extras, we really only enjoyed the behind the scenes look at the Broadway show.  The pencil drawing ""deleted scenes"" were not interesting (especially to a 4 year old!) and we couldn't get through the behind the scenes look w/the director - just didn't hold our interest.  I liked that they provided the songs in their own feature, until we listened to them again and only found ourselves liking the 1st (mothers's lullaby).  To rewatch that Sally Field song was torture!  I would have so much preferred a movie where maybe Ariel relays her childhood to her daughter, or maybe even grandaughter.  Or possibly has more intimate memories of her mother.  Or even just a movie w/her CHILDhood, not necessarily her teen years.  I'd say I was most pleased with the fact that the villian doesn't actually get slayed in the end, which is a bit of a switch (although for that song, she should have been!)  So, while it will certainly do for little fans of Ariel (can they ever get enough of her?) it just doesn't make the grade.",3,Was expecting more but it just didn't deliver,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3014,"['daughter', 'absolutely', 'LOVES', 'Ariel', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '1', '2', 'so', 'figured', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'entertaining', 'did', 'sit', '1st', 'time', 'when', 'offered', 'let', 'watch', 'again', 'agreed', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'seen', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'annimation', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'IS', 'very', 'good', 'nothing', 'close', 'crappy', 'TV', 'show', 'worries', 'background', 'get', 'Ariel', 'mother', 'nice', 'albeit', 'VERY', 'brief', 'whole', 'movie', 'based', 'premise', 'mother', 'was', 'so', 'music', 'tragic', 'death', 'upsets', 'Triton', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'have', 'music', 'Atlantica', 'anymore', 'get', 'ONE', 'very', 'short', 'scene', 'singing', '7', 'daughters', 'are', 'put', 'bed', 'then', 'yeah', 'get', 'see', 'Ariel', 'look-alike', 'mother', 'making', 'out', 'w/Triton', 'little', 'creepy', 'Still', 'get', 'really', 'loved', 'other', 'seeing', 'whole', 'storyline', 'based', 'love', 'music', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'more', 'More', 'scenes', 'mother', 'w/Ariel', 'Maybe', 'mention', 'fact', 'Ariel', 'mother', 'look', 'exactly', 'alike', 'what', 'do', 'Triton', 'what', 'so', 'protective', 'background', 'other', 'characters', 'cute', 'Sebastian', 'Flounder', 'scenes', 'secret', 'nightclub', 'are', 'cute', 'too', 'overall', 'music', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Most', 'notably', '1st', 'song', 'Sally', 'Field', 'pretty', 'unbearable', 'mainly', 'spoken', 'not', 'musically', 'Even', 'Jodie', 'Benson', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'exact', 'name', 'pretty', 'bad', 'saying', 'lot', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'music', 'when', 'saw', 'short', 'preview', '1st', 'scene', 'movie', 'w/her', 'mother', 'singing', 'sleep', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappoints', 'sometimes', 'badly', 'sidekick', 'villianess', 'place', 'found', 'least', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'extras', 'really', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'look', 'Broadway', 'show', 'pencil', 'drawing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'interesting', 'especially', '4', 'year', 'old', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'scenes', 'look', 'w/the', 'director', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'liked', 'provided', 'songs', 'own', 'feature', 'listened', 'again', 'only', 'found', 'liking', '1st', 'mothers', 'lullaby', 'rewatch', 'Sally', 'Field', 'song', 'was', 'torture', 'would', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'preferred', 'movie', 'where', 'maybe', 'Ariel', 'childhood', 'daughter', 'maybe', 'even', 'grandaughter', 'possibly', 'more', 'intimate', 'memories', 'mother', 'even', 'just', 'movie', 'w/her', 'CHILDhood', 'not', 'necessarily', 'teen', 'years', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'most', 'pleased', 'fact', 'villian', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'slayed', 'end', 'bit', 'switch', 'song', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'So', 'will', 'certainly', 'do', 'little', 'fans', 'Ariel', 'can', 'ever', 'get', 'enough', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'grade']",The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning

1115299,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000XUOIQO,Monty Moonlight,"[5, 6]","This is a big summer for me, because my two tippy-top favorite Disney girls, Ariel and Tink (despite the fact that I really go for the Alice and Wendy performers the most at the theme parks), are getting very special DVD releases; direct-to-video prequels, to be specific. The first is out now, sometimes referred to as The Little Mermaid 3, but released as ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"".The plot of this all new, thankfully traditionally animated feature (unlike the upcoming Tinker Bell CGI movie, though that one still looks good), involves King Triton's tragic loss of Ariel's mother, Queen Athena (And yes, we do see Athena in the film, and she looks more like Ariel than one would probably have imagined), and the way the entire kingdom is soon forced to suffer as he does. King Triton places a ban on all music in the kingdom of Atlantica, because music reminds him of his lost beloved, and this results in ten years of boredom and misery for Triton's subjects and his own seven lovely daughters. After that flashback, narrated by Sebastian the crab, we catch up with Triton and his family sometime during Ariel's fifteenth year, when an encounter with a new fish friend named Flounder leads her to discover a secret, underground club in which music is played and celebrated nightly. Ariel's curious and excitable sisters soon join her on her visits to the secret club, and this is their undoing. For their governess, the scheming Marina Del Ray, is out to get Sebastian's job, and that means she's out to get Sebastian, who just happens to be the illegal, musical nightclub proprietor and head entertainer. It's a rather simple plot about how music was brought back to the kingdom of Atlantica, which isn't a spoiler if you've seen the original film at all, with a mild villain thrown in for a little danger. Marina does turn out to be a threat, but the real hurdle for the heroes in the film is Triton and his anti-music agenda.""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" is definitely a film that walks the line of great and disappointing probably more than any Disney sequel. It's beautifully animated for the most part, with my only real complaint being a few scenes of some significant music box figures done in CGI that looks unfinished in close-ups. The plot is not too shabby, but probably too simple to meet most adult viewers' hopes and expectations (yes, there are tons of adult Disney fanatics out there, like myself). Disney tends to aim its direct-to-video films more squarely at kids than its usually MUCH better bigscreen outings or even its animated TV shows. I consider this to be part of the problem with Disney's line of direct to video releases. Also, the villain of a Disney film is often the best aspect for most folks, and in this case, Sally Field's Marina Del Ray is a good character played beautifully, but not all that important as a villain and certainly not very imposing. She has a creepy pack of electric eels to increase her danger quotient though. Of course, she also has a comedic sidekick, a manatee named Benjamin (who seems to not require much oxygen), who I found a bit annoying really but others seem to enjoy.The biggest problem with the story and the film itself though, for hardcore Little Mermaid fans anyway, is probably that it is hard to buy as a precursor to the original, classic Disney masterpiece. And don't get me started on how annoying it is that the direct-to-video prequel and sequel present Ariel's life as having 10 years of misery and deprivation in her childhood years and ten years of misery and deprivation at the start of her marriage. I know Anderson's mermaid was a tragic character, but this is the most internationally beloved Disney princess of them all! That's beside the point though. As I was saying, it is a bit hard to buy these events as having led up to the original film, and I consider the Disney animated TV series, which I suppose is no longer considered canon (though it is to me), to be a much better prequelization. Something that increases that feeling is the problem ""Ariel's Beginning"" had with character continuity. First, there's the issue of voices, most noticeably, King Triton's (though Ariel's sisters sound totally different from in the theatrical film too). Jim Cummings has taken over as the voice of King Triton after years of Kenneth Mars playing the role. Now, Jim Cummings is a Disney treasure, but he doesn't sound like Triton much at all, and it just doesn't work for me. In fact, of the two biggest complaints I've read about the characterizations in ""Ariel's Beginning"", that's one of them. The other is the character of Flounder. He is a completely different character in this film. Flounder, the cowardly ""guppy"" of the classic film and TV series, is presented here as a Baloo/King Louie wannabe with a rebellious streak. The saddest part is that the one scene in which he really acts just like the original Flounder can be found in the deleted scenes section.But let's talk about chicks, man. Specifically, Ariel, the girl of my dreams, and her six hottie sisters. Ariel is voiced perfectly here by her original voice actress, Jodi Benson, whose voice is still straight from Heaven. And, thankfully, Ariel is totally in character in this movie. Her sisters finally get some decent screen time too, and I gotta tell ya, the exposure we get to Ariel's sisters here is one of the biggest strong points of ""Ariel's Beginning"". I came away from it absolutely adoring Arista.Not a hot female, but also reprising his role perfectly here is the great Samuel E. Wright, who voices Sebastian the crab. Mr. Wright actually performs the most memorable song in the film, which unfortunately is not one of the new, original songs written for the film, but instead is the well-known ""Jump in the Line"". This song is performed twice in the film in two different ways, and it's the best musical aspect aside from Ariel singing ""I Remember"". Sadly, the original songs here are not very memorable. This is usually a problem with direct-to-video animated films that attempt to be musicals, and a prime example of a mistake frequently made is the villain's song here, ""Just One Mistake"", which attempts to emulate the song sang by Ursula in the first film but instead is just all over the place and fails to establish a catchy tune.So, when all is said and done, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is a visually impressive, mildly entertaining new story about Ariel and her friends that unfortunately holds to very little character/story continuity and feels more like it takes place in a parallel universe rather than in the same one as the original film (and totally, disappointingly disregards the TV series; I hate it when they do that!). Honestly, though I still need to rewatch and review it (haven't seen it in a while), I'd be just as comfortable tossing ""The Little Mermaid 2"" into that parallel universe too. I don't care to see Ariel having another 10 years of sadness, nor do I care to see her married to anyone other than me, or with a kid I didn't sire. *ahem*Folks who simply don't feel we need new stories about the Disney princesses shouldn't bother to watch or review this film, but for those of us who do, we would love to see more if they had this level of visual quality but were just written better. Of course, it is said that this is to be the last of the Disney direct-to-video prequels and sequels (we'll see about that), the Tink movie being more of a Fairy franchise thing like the Barbie DVDs, but the real problem was never the concept of making such films, it was just how much work, heart, talent, and of course money was put into them. ""Bambi 2"", despite the uninspired title, remains the best of the Disney animated sequels (aside from ""Rescuers Down Under"", of course) and is really an outstanding film with only the flaw of some all-too-modern sounding songs. ""Ariel's Beginning"" was one of the ones that came close to that level. Visually, it is beautiful. As a stand alone film, it's pretty good/enjoyable. Good enough for me to give it four stars. It just disregards too much of what has already been established as part of Ariel's universe, and writing down for a younger audience is never really a good thing. If they didn't have to do it for the bigscreen films, why do it for the direct-to-video ones? Is it worth a purchase though? Yes, unless you just hate Disney sequels. It's a good film that looks gorgeous on DVD (it's anamorphic widescreen, by the way). The continuity issues may make you mad, they may not, but it's a good film, and truly the real highlight is getting to know Ariel's sisters better. The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, song selections, a short behind-the-scenes featurette with the director, Peggy Holmes, a personality match game (I got Ariel, no cheating!) that is part of a bigger interactive experience that teaches you more about Ariel and her sisters by letting you explore their individual vanities, and the best extra is a behind the scenes look at the new ""The Little Mermaid"" Broadway musical, which I'm DYING to see. A couple of the sisters in that one are cuties too. If you're a fan of Ariel the Little Mermaid, yeah, it's a must purchase. I just so badly wish that Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" TV series would get a complete DVD release too.",4,"Gorgeous Visuals, Mild Story, Continuity Give and Take",1220140800,"08 31,

1115303,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B000XUOIQO,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[2, 2]","When you watch this movie, you will release something is terribly wrong. Well, not right from the start.This movie opens with a wonderful scene featuring Ariel's mother, a younger King Trident (with a brown beard!), and all of their young children hanging out on rocks on the surface. Since we all know what happened to Ariel's mother, we know something sad is about to happen. This takes over about the first seven minutes of the film.Being a prequel, this is before 1. King Trident is noticeably far more angry and withdrawn, so much that he doesn't want to hear any music. His time spent with his daughters consists of a short walk in the morning. This gives the movie an interesting tone.But what happens next goes downhill. We get introduced to the girl's caretaker, ""Marina Del Rey,"" and ""Benjamin."" To start, Benjamin is so lazily animated that he doesn't even fit in the rest of the movie, which is above normal quality for direct-to-dvd Disney films. ""Marina Del Rey"" is a very typical female villian; all about the glamour, ready to decieve and steal, etc. In fact, all she really is comes off to be the poor man's (or women's) Ursula, who was very unique and down-right great. In fact, Morgana from Little Mermaid II was a thousands times better.The movie moves into more trouble. Does anyone remember little Flounder, scared and terrified of everything? Apparently in this so-called ""prequel,"" he dances to music and acts obnoxious. Um, what? This makes no sense.Not a whole lot happens at this point-they do some traveling, being a club dancing to ""Shake Senora""(can't even come up with an original song), and have more trouble with the evil Marina Del Rey. Her song on her own pails terribly to anything done by Ursula or Morgana. In fact, it's terrible.So the ""big conclusion"" has ""Marina Del Rey"" unleashing electric eels on the characters, and them ultimately winning, with Marina and Benjamin being put in jail. Right there, it is so obvious that the movie had a chance to be far more than it was. With a female character who uses magic, uses electric eels as weapons, doesn't she seem to have some connection to Ursula? Why not turn her into a pre-Ursula, have her be cursed to be an octopus, or change, or anything? It is ultimately the uninspired, boring villian that brings down the movie from it's little mistakes.This movie is far from terrible. The beginning is actually very good. However, if you are looking for a good sequel to the original Little Mermaid, the 2nd one with her daughter and Morgana was far better, darker, more detailed, and never ""out-of-character.""Overall the high ratings of this movie are not deserved, though it is better than many Disney direct-to-dvd sequels.",3,The most ovverrated Disney sequel...,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2711,"['When', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'release', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Well', 'not', 'right', 'start.This', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Ariel', 'mother', 'younger', 'King', 'Trident', 'brown', 'beard', 'young', 'children', 'hanging', 'out', 'rocks', 'surface', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Ariel', 'mother', 'know', 'something', 'sad', 'happen', 'over', 'first', 'seven', 'minutes', 'film.Being', 'prequel', '1', 'King', 'Trident', 'noticeably', 'far', 'more', 'angry', 'withdrawn', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'music', 'time', 'spent', 'daughters', 'short', 'walk', 'morning', 'movie', 'interesting', 'tone.But', 'what', 'next', 'downhill', 'get', 'introduced', 'girl', 'caretaker', 'Marina', 'Del', 'Rey', 'Benjamin', 'start', 'Benjamin', 'so', 'lazily', 'animated', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie', 'normal', 'quality', 'direct-to-dvd', 'Disney', 'films', 'Marina', 'Del', 'Rey', 'very', 'typical', 'female', 'villian', 'glamour', 'ready', 'decieve', 'steal', 'etc', 'fact', 'really', 'be', 'poor', 'man', 'women', 'Ursula', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'down-right', 'great', 'fact', 'Morgana', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'II', 'was', 'thousands', 'better.The', 'movie', 'more', 'trouble', 'Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'little', 'Flounder', 'scared', 'terrified', 'everything', 'Apparently', 'so-called', 'prequel', 'music', 'obnoxious', 'Um', 'what', 'sense.Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'point-they', 'do', 'traveling', 'being', 'club', 'dancing', 'Shake', 'Senora', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'up', 'original', 'song', 'have', 'more', 'trouble', 'evil', 'Marina', 'Del', 'Rey', 'song', 'own', 'pails', 'terribly', 'anything', 'done', 'Ursula', 'Morgana', 'fact', 'big', 'conclusion', 'Marina', 'Del', 'Rey', 'unleashing', 'electric', 'eels', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'Marina', 'Benjamin', 'being', 'put', 'jail', 'Right', 'there', 'so', 'obvious', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'was', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'magic', 'electric', 'eels', 'weapons', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'connection', 'Ursula', 'Why', 'not', 'turn', 'pre-Ursula', 'have', 'be', 'cursed', 'be', 'octopus', 'change', 'anything', 'ultimately', 'uninspired', 'boring', 'villian', 'down', 'movie', 'little', 'mistakes.This', 'movie', 'far', 'terrible', 'beginning', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'sequel', 'original', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '2nd', 'one', 'daughter', 'Morgana', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'darker', 'more', 'detailed', 'never', 'out-of-character', 'high', 'ratings', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'deserved', 'better', 'many', 'Disney', 'direct-to-dvd', 'sequels']",The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning

I guess that means The Lion King, Bambi, and Snow White where intended and plotted murder transpires, aren't for kids either then!My now 4 year old is satisfied that she understands the story better and how Flounder became her best friend as well.  She's watched it 3 x times in two days since we got it, so I call it a kiddie hit.Also the movie features the obedient but vainly shallow other 6 sisters; one can understand how curious and intelligent Ariel, the last daughter and more resembling her mother than the other children, just doesn't really fit in to their sorority.  They tell her she ""just doesn't know when to stop"".  It's no wonder she sought a better life on land.The only out of place character is Benjamin (what is he a manatee?) the sidekick to Marina, the Ursula-lookalike governess to the 7 mermaid princesses.

I have not seen this movie but I have heard plenty enough. It's a disgrace to The Little Mermaid francise, especially the really good television series! The way Ariel and Flounder met in the series when they were cute kids was so good, yet they substitute it in a movie of absolutely nothing. The only thing I can compliment is the animation looking much more modern than the other direct to video films. But that doesn't change the bad choices they made for this story. King Triton is at his worst; he's a total jerk! There's the fact that they've put King Triton and Ariel through another major conflict when they've already had enough in the original movie, there's the fact that bringing music to Atlantica has no point to the original film, it's-I-er-IT'S SO TERRIBLE!!!!",1,Disgracing and Pointless!,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,905,"['Oh', 'god', 'do', 'hate', 'movie', 'absolute', 'worst', 'Disney', 'direct', 'video', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'midquel', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'have', 'heard', 'plenty', 'enough', 'disgrace', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'francise', 'especially', 'really', 'good', 'television', 'series', 'way', 'Ariel', 'Flounder', 'met', 'series', 'when', 'were', 'cute', 'kids', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'yet', 'substitute', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'compliment', 'animation', 'looking', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'other', 'direct', 'video', 'films', ""n't"", 'change', 'bad', 'choices', 'made', 'story', 'King', 'Triton', 'worst', 'total', 'jerk', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'put', 'King', 'Triton', 'Ariel', 'major', 'conflict', 'when', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'enough', 'original', 'movie', 'fact', 'bringing', 'music', 'Atlantica', 'point', 'original', 'film', ""it's-I-er-IT"", 'SO', 'TERRIBLE']",The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning

You see more of Ariel and her sisters and you also see them living a normal life geting up out of their beds and going walking with their father. We see Ariel's mother and she is the spiting image of Ariel but gets crushed by a ship and King Triton turns into an underwater Scrooge banning music from the kingdom. What is sad though is King Triton making his daughters do chores and the worst one of all is cleaning Barnicles which poor Ariel has been made do because she tickles her sister with seeweed.

1115322,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000XUOIQO,Z Hayes,"[14, 16]","""Ariel's Beginning"" is a fun animated feature that had my 3.5 year old daughter asking for more. The story is the prequel to The Little Mermaid - it tells the story of how King Triton lost his beloved wife Athena in an accident [back when Ariel and her sisters were little] and thus banned music and all forms of gaiety in his kingdom, living in seclusion and with darkness within his heart. When the pirncesses grow up, they all chafe against the restrictions imposed by King Triton, especially Ariel who, like her mother, loves music and singing. Ariel starts to dabble in music secretly, much to her father's anger and finally runs away with Sebastian in tow, until Triton realises his folly.It is in this movie that we find out how Ariel meets and befriends Flounder, and how Sebastian becomes the music conductor in Triton's court. There is also a villain in the form of nanny, Marina del Rey, though she is not as scary or menacing as Ursula, the sea witch in The Little Mermaid.Ok, it is not as enchanting as The Little Mermaid, but all in all, I thought it was a decent effort by Disney, considering some of the other animated features out there.The songs in this feature are not as catchy as in The Little Mermaid, but they are still pleasing and fun. The songs here are: I Remember, I Will Sing, Athena's Song,Just One Mistake,Jump In The Line [Shake, Senora], and  Man Smart, Woman Smarter.The extras include Deleted Scenes, Music and More [the Disney Song Selection option allows the words of the songs to appear on screen, making it easy for sing-alongs], Games and Activities [Mermaid Discovery Vanity Game- allows viewers to unearth secrets about the princesses by clicking on their personal scrapbooks, or compare which of King Triton's daughters you are most like with the Personality Profile Game]. There is also a Backstage Disney feature [a behind the scenes featurette centring on  animation director Peggy Holmes].I watched this with my little one, and we were both entertained - so much so that we watched it again! Having been long-time Little Mermaid fans [me longer than my little one of course:)], this was a delightful addition to our collection of Disney features.",5,A fun prequel to The Little Mermaid!,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2193,"['Ariel', 'Beginning', 'fun', 'animated', 'feature', 'had', '3.5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'asking', 'more', 'story', 'prequel', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'story', 'how', 'King', 'Triton', 'lost', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Athena', 'accident', '[', 'back', 'when', 'Ariel', 'sisters', 'were', 'little', ']', 'thus', 'banned', 'music', 'forms', 'gaiety', 'kingdom', 'living', 'seclusion', 'darkness', 'heart', 'When', 'pirncesses', 'grow', 'up', 'chafe', 'restrictions', 'imposed', 'King', 'Triton', 'especially', 'Ariel', 'who', 'mother', 'music', 'singing', 'Ariel', 'dabble', 'music', 'secretly', 'much', 'father', 'anger', 'finally', 'away', 'Sebastian', 'tow', 'Triton', 'folly.It', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Ariel', 'meets', 'befriends', 'Flounder', 'how', 'Sebastian', 'music', 'conductor', 'Triton', 'court', 'also', 'villain', 'form', 'nanny', 'Marina', 'del', 'Rey', 'not', 'scary', 'menacing', 'Ursula', 'sea', 'witch', 'Little', 'Mermaid.Ok', 'not', 'as', 'enchanting', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'Disney', 'considering', 'other', 'animated', 'features', 'out', 'there.The', 'songs', 'feature', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'catchy', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'are', 'still', 'pleasing', 'fun', 'songs', 'here', 'are', 'Remember', 'Will', 'Sing', 'Athena', 'Song', 'Just', 'One', 'Mistake', 'Jump', 'Line', '[', 'Shake', 'Senora', ']', 'Man', 'Smart', 'Woman', 'Smarter.The', 'extras', 'include', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Music', 'More', '[', 'Disney', 'Song', 'Selection', 'option', 'words', 'songs', 'appear', 'screen', 'making', 'easy', 'sing-alongs', ']', 'Games', 'Activities', '[', 'Mermaid', 'Discovery', 'Vanity', 'Game-', 'viewers', 'unearth', 'secrets', 'princesses', 'clicking', 'personal', 'scrapbooks', 'compare', 'King', 'Triton', 'daughters', 'are', 'most', 'Personality', 'Profile', 'Game', ']', 'also', 'Backstage', 'Disney', 'feature', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'centring', 'animation', 'director', 'Peggy', 'Holmes', ']', '.I', 'watched', 'little', 'one', 'were', 'entertained', 'so', 'much', 'watched', 'again', 'Having', 'been', 'long-time', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'fans', '[', 'longer', 'little', 'one', 'course', ']', 'was', 'delightful', 'addition', 'collection', 'Disney', 'features']",The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning
