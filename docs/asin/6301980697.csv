Pair Peter O'Toole of Lawrence of Arabia fame with Petula ""Downtown"" Clark,and use a ludicrous script loosely based on the Robert Donat classic. Add music and stir.In this version,Mr.Chips is an uptight,prudish,dowdy schoolteacher who encounters a dancehall girl when vacationing in the Mediterranean. The dancehall girl is pretty desperate,since she hits on the dowdy teacher,saying,""Let's make whoopee!"" One can understand her American Pie-style desperation to lose her virginity,but to him??? As a dancehall girl,didn't she have her pick of guys? Or maybe she's a gold-digger. It has the steaminess of the first encounter between the late Anna Nicole Smith and her late elderly billionaire husband-to-be in the strip club. The paternal Mr.Chips obliges. He gets a trophy wife&becomes; a happy,easygoing person. In the original,Mr.Chips' young wife dies in childbirth. This movie throws in WWII and the young wife dies during the Blitz.""Goodbye Mr.Chips"" has some good acting (Sian Philips is a hammy vamp),but it fails as a remake,a musical,and a WWII movie.This musical is blitzed by a bad script,and cheesy songs.",2,"Goodbye,great plot",1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,1220,"['musical', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'termed', 'Great', 'Actor', 'Meets', 'Famous', 'Singer', 'Help', 'Disastrous', 'Script', 'Pair', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'fame', 'Petula', 'Downtown', 'Clark', 'use', 'ludicrous', 'script', 'loosely', 'based', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'classic', 'Add', 'music', 'stir.In', 'version', 'Mr.Chips', 'uptight', 'prudish', 'dowdy', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'dancehall', 'girl', 'when', 'vacationing', 'Mediterranean', 'dancehall', 'girl', 'pretty', 'desperate', 'dowdy', 'teacher', 'saying', 'Let', 'make', 'whoopee', 'One', 'can', 'understand', 'American', 'Pie-style', 'desperation', 'lose', 'virginity', 'dancehall', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pick', 'guys', 'maybe', 'gold-digger', 'steaminess', 'first', 'encounter', 'late', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith', 'late', 'elderly', 'billionaire', 'husband-to-be', 'strip', 'club', 'paternal', 'Mr.Chips', 'obliges', 'trophy', 'wife', 'happy', 'easygoing', 'person', 'original', 'Mr.Chips', 'young', 'wife', 'dies', 'childbirth', 'movie', 'WWII', 'young', 'wife', 'dies', 'Blitz', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.Chips', 'good', 'acting', 'Sian', 'Philips', 'hammy', 'vamp', 'remake', 'musical', 'WWII', 'movie.This', 'musical', 'blitzed', 'bad', 'script', 'cheesy', 'songs']",N/A

He's respected, but not particularly liked. He's seen as dull, hence his nickname: Ditchy, as in ditchwater, dull as. The one person who seems to see beyond Chipping's exterior is his friend Max Staefel, the German master. One of his ex pupils takes him to a musical show which features the singer Katherine Bridges, and he meets this young lady again on holiday in Pompeii. Against all odds, they achieve a rapport, and thanks to Max, who memorises the address for him, they meet up in London and fall in love. They marry and the effect on Chipping is remarkable - his buried humanity is unlocked and the boys begin to love as well as respect the man they now affectionately call Chips.Chips and Kathy have a blissful 20 years together until tragedy strikes in the form of World War 2.Often dismissed as inferior to the classic 1939 version with Robert Donat, this musical from 1969 with Peter O'Toole as Chips and Petula Clarke as Kathy, will always be THE version for me. I first saw it at the cinema on original release and although at the age of 8 I was vaguely aware that it was a film for adults, and some of it was above my ability to comprehend, I fell in love with it. I haven't fallen out of love since.Peter O'Toole is brilliant as Chips, his awkwardness, embarassment and growing self confidence and his all consuming love for Kathy and his care for the boys he teaches is enchantingly portrayed. The scene in which he reacts to the tragedy that WW2 brings is incredibly powerful and moving. He really does look like a man who's whole life has crumbled around him.True, it does make a number of radical changes to the original novel, but this doesn't matter - it works on it's own merits.

But even Pauline Kael thought Peter O' Toole's performance was the best of the year, even though she didn't like the score either. (Could you imagine Rex Harrison in the role?  He was all set to do it, but pulled out, which explains the &quot;talk-singing&quot; of Chip's songs!) The pacing is just right, the leads have real chemistry, and the score sounds better every year.  A must in any form!

Too often, the outcome is a bastard hybrid whose very cheapness of imagination dishonors the original.  Hilton's original story (and Donat's film) will not be damaged by this travesty.

This is not a classic. But it is a truly wonderful viewing experience.Well scripted and superbly acted - it goes without saying that O Toole is astounding (another role that he was robbed of an Oscar; it went to the academy's emotional favorite, the dying John Wayne in 1970 for True Grit). More surprising is the lively on-screen presence of Petula Clark, who displays genuine, bona-fide screen chemistry with her screen counterpart.Putting the film in context, it is easy to see why I had overlooked it all of this time (despite my own love and involvement in musical theater). Goodbye, Mr Chips is a decidedly backwards looking film - produced at a time when America had no interest in looking backwards - especially to Britain's past. While the content is timeless and universal, 1969/70 was the year of Midnight Cowboy - a film whose gritty, urban decay realism and mainstream X rating changed Hollywood, and audience expectations, as well as Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid (which won best song for Bacharach/David with RKFOMH). Poor Mr. Chips - what seems charming and timeless now, seemed hopelessly dated and even antiquated back then.Matters were now helped by the serviceable, uninspired, and unmemorable score. There's is not a memorable or hummable song in the film (although Petula makes a valient effort in some music hall review numbers) Leslie Bricusse could not compete with other musical released that year, including Paint Your Wagon, Sweet Charity, and god help us all - Hello Dolly!Like the tortoise and the hare, those film musicals have aged poorly, and are now viewed as inferior incarnations of their staged counterparts. Mr. Chips - chippy - keeps calm and carries on, in keeping with its eponymous character - slowly, stoically, respectfully and gallantly.Perhaps its my own age. Perhaps its self-recognition in its portrayal of the vicissitudes of life, the unpredictability of love, and the preciousness of each moment. Perhaps its my love of teaching, and the films allowing me to pause and reflect on the hundreds whose lives I've touched - in some ways that I will never know.Regardless -  it is not contradictory to say that Goodbye, Mr Chips - a large, old fashioned road-show feature film musical - is, in its own way, a small, humble film about a small, humble life - whose majesty is reflected by those who were illuminated, however briefly, by his light.",4,How did I miss Mr Chips for 40+ years?,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2545,"['was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'let', 'face', 'not', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'even', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'not', 'classic', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'viewing', 'experience.Well', 'scripted', 'superbly', 'acted', 'saying', 'O', 'Toole', 'astounding', 'role', 'was', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'went', 'academy', 'emotional', 'favorite', 'dying', 'John', 'Wayne', '1970', 'True', 'Grit', 'More', 'surprising', 'lively', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'who', 'genuine', 'bona-fide', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'counterpart.Putting', 'film', 'context', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'had', 'overlooked', 'time', 'own', 'love', 'involvement', 'musical', 'theater', 'Goodbye', 'Mr', 'Chips', 'decidedly', 'backwards', 'looking', 'film', 'produced', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'had', 'interest', 'looking', 'backwards', 'especially', 'Britain', 'past', 'content', 'timeless', 'universal', '1969/70', 'was', 'year', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'film', 'gritty', 'urban', 'decay', 'realism', 'mainstream', 'X', 'rating', 'changed', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'expectations', 'as', 'well', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'won', 'best', 'song', 'Bacharach/David', 'RKFOMH', 'Poor', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'what', 'charming', 'timeless', 'now', 'seemed', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'even', 'antiquated', 'back', 'then.Matters', 'were', 'now', 'helped', 'serviceable', 'uninspired', 'unmemorable', 'score', 'not', 'memorable', 'hummable', 'song', 'film', 'Petula', 'valient', 'effort', 'music', 'hall', 'review', 'numbers', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'other', 'musical', 'released', 'year', 'including', 'Paint', 'Your', 'Wagon', 'Sweet', 'Charity', 'god', 'help', 'Hello', 'Dolly', 'tortoise', 'hare', 'film', 'musicals', 'have', 'aged', 'poorly', 'are', 'now', 'viewed', 'inferior', 'incarnations', 'staged', 'counterparts', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'chippy', 'keeps', 'calm', 'keeping', 'eponymous', 'character', 'slowly', 'stoically', 'respectfully', 'gallantly.Perhaps', 'own', 'age', 'Perhaps', 'self-recognition', 'portrayal', 'vicissitudes', 'life', 'unpredictability', 'love', 'preciousness', 'moment', 'Perhaps', 'love', 'teaching', 'films', 'allowing', 'pause', 'reflect', 'hundreds', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'touched', 'ways', 'will', 'never', 'know.Regardless', 'not', 'contradictory', 'say', 'Goodbye', 'Mr', 'Chips', 'large', 'old', 'fashioned', 'road-show', 'feature', 'film', 'musical', 'own', 'way', 'small', 'humble', 'film', 'small', 'humble', 'life', 'majesty', 'reflected', 'who', 'were', 'illuminated', 'however', 'briefly', 'light']",N/A

Consequently, we were in a vulnerable state of mind.  We hated the way the Greer Garson character, Mrs. Chips, had been killed off and were looking for a happier ending.  What we found in the 1969 version was a totally mis-cast, Petula Clark, as Mrs. Chips.  Too bad it took so long into the story for her to be eliminated.  Yikes!Aside from running an hour too long, having mis-cast actors, and insipid music, this film has nothing to recommend it.

However, the entire rest of the movie falls down around this.  Petula Clark is a rather bland leading lady, the songs are sappy and quite forgettable (in fact by the latter half of the movie I was muting the songs), and the story didn't flow properly.  I don't know the book or the Donat version of the film, though.What characteristics did Katherine's character have, that caused Chips to fall in love with her?  Katherine wasn't a BAD character, just a boring one.  Perhaps since she was the only young single woman he'd met, he convinced himself he loved her?I also did not see what exactly it was that made Chips so likeable at the end.  There are no scenes shown of the boys growing to like him, or of anything he's doing that changes his dull image to them, yet suddenly when he becomes headmaster every boy likes him, laughs at his jokes.  There are a few minor bits where Katherine interacts with the boys but these are fleetingly minor and wouldn't really redeem Chips in the boys' eyes.I'd give this movie a 1 or 2 if it didn't have such a great O'Toole performance in it.  Yeah, his singing is weak, very Rex-Harrison-ish, but the rest of his performance is very moving, especially from the point where he becomes headmaster.

He knew what lonely people are all about, you can see that everywhere in his screen work from THE BROWNING VERSION to THE WAY TO THE STARS to THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE, and he has written a wonderful part for Peter O'Toole, based of course on the Hilton novel and the 1939 film script which starred Robert Donat as ""Chips.""Here O'Toole is cold, icy, hateful at the beginning of the film, a Latin teacher at ""Brookfield Academy,"" not the warmest environment anyway, but we quickly see that no one likes O'Toole for himself, and few give him a chance to show the warm personality that lies frozen underneath.  Rattigan helps us understand that even the least approachable and apparently self-satisfied person may secretly be suffering agonies of self-consciousness, particularly in the class-ridden society that was England before WWII.  When Chips meets Katherine, the dance hall soubrette played by Petula Clark here, it's an unlikely pairing, but Rattigan makes it work.  She's curious, and she takes the time to get to know him.  She manages to make him forget all about his precious boys for a little while and to fall in love with her.  She's wise enough to understand that he is a teacher first and foremost and he's addicted to those boys.  Perhaps they could remake this musical today and cast Michael Jackson as Chips and Lisa Marie Presley as Katherine.  They would each be great in the part.  I would love to hear Lisa Marie sing ""You And I,"" Petula Clark's great signature tune from this film.Herbert Ross made many memorable films during his career.  He was a choreographer first, not an especially good one, and he soon gravitated towards direction.  GOODBYE MR CHIPS remains one of his very finest projects, but for me, the distinction of the film is all to the credit of the two stars (and of Michael Redgrave, who plays the headmaster of ""Brookfield"" with a strange and almost desperate gallantry) and of course Terence Rattigan, who had to re-imagine the whole thing for a post war audience.",5,A Pageant of English History,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,2169,"['Terence', 'Rattigan', 'wrote', 'wonderful', 'screenplay', 'perhaps', 'best', 'saying', 'lot', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'playwrights', 'screenwriters', 'knew', 'what', 'lonely', 'people', 'are', 'can', 'see', 'everywhere', 'screen', 'work', 'THE', 'BROWNING', 'VERSION', 'THE', 'WAY', 'TO', 'THE', 'STARS', 'THE', 'YELLOW', 'ROLLS', 'ROYCE', 'written', 'wonderful', 'part', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'based', 'course', 'Hilton', 'novel', '1939', 'film', 'script', 'starred', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'Chips', 'Here', ""O'Toole"", 'cold', 'icy', 'hateful', 'beginning', 'film', 'Latin', 'teacher', 'Brookfield', 'Academy', 'not', 'warmest', 'environment', 'anyway', 'quickly', 'see', 'one', ""O'Toole"", 'few', 'give', 'chance', 'show', 'warm', 'personality', 'frozen', 'underneath', 'Rattigan', 'understand', 'even', 'least', 'approachable', 'apparently', 'self-satisfied', 'person', 'may', 'secretly', 'be', 'suffering', 'agonies', 'self-consciousness', 'particularly', 'class-ridden', 'society', 'was', 'England', 'WWII', 'When', 'Chips', 'Katherine', 'dance', 'hall', 'soubrette', 'played', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'here', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'Rattigan', 'work', 'curious', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'make', 'forget', 'precious', 'boys', 'little', 'while', 'fall', 'love', 'wise', 'enough', 'understand', 'teacher', 'first', 'foremost', 'addicted', 'boys', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'remake', 'musical', 'today', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Chips', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'Presley', 'Katherine', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'part', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'sing', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'great', 'signature', 'tune', 'film.Herbert', 'Ross', 'made', 'many', 'memorable', 'films', 'career', 'was', 'choreographer', 'first', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'one', 'soon', 'gravitated', 'towards', 'direction', 'GOODBYE', 'MR', 'CHIPS', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'projects', 'distinction', 'film', 'credit', 'two', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'headmaster', 'Brookfield', 'strange', 'almost', 'desperate', 'gallantry', 'course', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'who', 'had', 're-imagine', 'whole', 'thing', 'post', 'war', 'audience']",N/A

I think it is my favourite movie of all time, it has stood the test of 40 years and remains fresh, charming and full of wit and genuine humanity.Terrence Rattigan script positively rattles with great one liners and unlike the good but very dated 1939 version, it is not overtly sentimental or overplays the tragedies of the story. A great CD was released of the movie a few years ago, in that much is illustrated as to missing material cut from the film, some superb interviews with the stars and great unseen stills. It is such a shame that now when the movie finally comes, long overdue to DVD,  that it is so short on any extras (as someone pointed out O Toole and Clarke would have jumped at the chance to discuss the film). I do not agree with the writer who said that unless you had seen the reserved seat roadshow version of the movie you had not seen this complete version until now. !!! This is exactly the same version available on laser disc and Video, albeit on video it was pan and scan. All the cuts and edits made in the early stages of the film's release remain here, ie the edited version of ""Schooldays"" and Peter O Toole's heartbreaking ""When I Was Younger' which was recorded for the Cd, shot for the film (there are stills in the CD) but was cut , early in the release process.Please dont get me wrong, all the latter cuts of the movie have been restored, so this is as full a length version of the film as has been seen by most of the public and is not that abominable 130 minute version which used to be shown on Tv quite a lot, but its still not the entirely complete version, sure there are overtures and intermission medlies and exit music etc(all of which were on the video ) but a 2 disc version that would have included some of the deleted scenes and interviews past and present with the still living stars would have brought it in line with the remarkable CD version still available.What remains is a fine if not brilliant print of the film, that is darker and less washed out than the earlier Video release, beautiful sound and of course the marvellous marvellous movie itself, but, oh, what could have been done with this still very popular movie.

He's no singer, but his songs don't really require a Howard Keel to put them across.

There has never been a more sensitive, completely vulnerable performance than that of Peter O'Toole--with a devastating long close-up shot as he says goodbye to his school as he retires. And, I'm sorry, but Petula Clark has just the right theatricality for her role as a West End musical comedy star. Her performance rings much truer than Julie Andrews pale rendering of Gertrude Lawrence in ""Star."" Finally there's the score which is the epitome of a movie musical score, with ""Walk Through the World With Me"", ""You and I"", ""What a Bunch of Flowers"" and ""London"" as great examples of cinematic musical numbers.

288820,A1YU3JQIT9421C,6301980697,Richard Brennan,"[5, 6]","The DVDHooray!  Warner has delivered the original widescreen restored road show version of the film. The extras, unfortunately, are just trailers and, sadly there is no commentary (especially as Petula Clark, Peter O'Toole and Leslie Bricusse are all still around and have a well-known fondness for this project).  The visuals  look a bit soft  -but they were shot that way, mostly with long lenses on a fast film stock.The Movie""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" is a lovely, sentimental story of a quiet, some might say even ordinary, man.Producer Arthur P. Jacobs put the production in the hands of first time directory Herbert Ross (later to direct ""The Goodbye Girl "" and just about every Neil Simon movie in the 70's and 80's).  Ross wanted to incorporate  the way songs were used in films like ""The Graduate"" and"" Easy Rider""; as counterpoint and commentary on the action, rather than being sung on screen.  As with most first time directors the end results are mixed - but what's good is very good indeed.The rock solid core of the movie is Peter O'Toole's portrayal of schoolmaster Arthur Chipping.  Just watch his final speech as headmaster at the end of the movie: a man slowed by advanced age (in his 70's?) but mentally facile; characteristically stoic but capable of deep emotion.  Then remind yourself: this part is being played by a 36-year-old Irishman, who a year earlier was the rowdy, forceful King Henry II in ""Lion in Winter"" .  The proper, introverted Mr. Chipping is a world away from that lusty king - but always vividly real.Petula Clark contributes an earthy  emotional counterpoint to Chips stuffiness.  She's in great voice and completely convincing as the stage star who's sampled the good life and found it wanting.  The script doesn't do her any favors in slathering on the whole ""a real woman gives up her career and finds fulfillment in the love of her man"" theme .  But Pet makes me believe that the choices are on her terms.And what can you say about Sian Phillips scenery-chewing cameo as a 1920's stage vamp, Ursula Mossbank?  At their last leave taking, she calls out over her shoulder as she heads out the door, ""Well I'll see you tomorrow, or next week, or in heaven or somewhere..."".  Chips replies,  ""In heaven, certainly"", smiling at Kathrine.The music:  I love ""Walk Through the World"", ""Schooldays"", ""Fill the World With Love"" and the moody ""Where Did My Childhood Go"".  And I can't step off a plane at Heathrow without the catchy lyrics to ""London is London"" spinning in my head.  On the other hand, I can definitely live  without ""The Sky Smiled"". To make matters worse, Ross zooms in and out throughout this number like a first-time father with a new camcorder.  Even so, John Williams orchestrates and scores the film with the dramatic style he would later bring to his own scores in the next decade.Backstage note: Some have asked, ""Why make a musical of Goodby, Mr. Chips?""  Arthur P. Jacobs' answer in 1964 was this: Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews directed by Vincent Minnelli with a score by Andre Previn.  But  finding the right format and score was difficult, with Previn writing and discarding songs.  Jacobs had to go forward with other projects  (""Dr. Doolittle"" and ""Planet of the Apes"") and as a result he lost both his stars.  Richard Burton stepped in, then Leslie Bricusse replaced Previn as composer.  Petula Clark signed on. Burton out; Peter O'Toole in.  And I, for one, couldn't be happier that he took up the part.Fan note: Did you know that there is a 3 CD set of the entire score (songs and background music) PLUS the contents of the original soundtrack LP PLUS outtakes, alternate versions, and interviews with Leslie Bricusse and the cast:Goodbye, Mr. ChipsIf Amazon doesn't have it then Google for it.",4,Sentimental Musical Chips is Made Whole Again,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,3761,"['DVDHooray', 'Warner', 'delivered', 'original', 'widescreen', 'restored', 'road', 'show', 'version', 'film', 'extras', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'just', 'trailers', 'sadly', 'commentary', 'especially', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'are', 'still', 'have', 'well-known', 'fondness', 'project', 'visuals', 'look', 'bit', 'soft', '-but', 'were', 'shot', 'way', 'mostly', 'long', 'lenses', 'fast', 'film', 'stock.The', 'Movie', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'lovely', 'sentimental', 'story', 'quiet', 'might', 'say', 'even', 'ordinary', 'man.Producer', 'Arthur', 'P.', 'Jacobs', 'put', 'production', 'hands', 'first', 'time', 'directory', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'later', 'direct', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'just', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'movie', '70', '80', 'Ross', 'wanted', 'incorporate', 'way', 'songs', 'were', 'used', 'films', 'Graduate', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'counterpoint', 'commentary', 'action', 'rather', 'being', 'sung', 'screen', 'most', 'first', 'time', 'directors', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'what', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'indeed.The', 'rock', 'solid', 'core', 'movie', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'portrayal', 'schoolmaster', 'Arthur', 'Chipping', 'Just', 'watch', 'final', 'speech', 'headmaster', 'end', 'movie', 'man', 'slowed', 'advanced', 'age', '70', 'mentally', 'facile', 'characteristically', 'stoic', 'capable', 'deep', 'emotion', 'Then', 'remind', 'part', 'being', 'played', '36-year-old', 'Irishman', 'who', 'year', 'earlier', 'was', 'rowdy', 'forceful', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'proper', 'introverted', 'Mr.', 'Chipping', 'world', 'away', 'lusty', 'king', 'always', 'vividly', 'real.Petula', 'Clark', 'earthy', 'emotional', 'counterpoint', 'Chips', 'stuffiness', 'great', 'voice', 'completely', 'convincing', 'stage', 'star', 'who', 'sampled', 'good', 'life', 'found', 'wanting', 'script', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'slathering', 'whole', 'real', 'woman', 'up', 'career', 'fulfillment', 'love', 'man', 'theme', 'Pet', 'believe', 'choices', 'are', 'terms.And', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Sian', 'Phillips', 'scenery-chewing', 'cameo', '1920', 'stage', 'vamp', 'Ursula', 'Mossbank', 'last', 'leave', 'taking', 'out', 'shoulder', 'out', 'door', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'see', 'tomorrow', 'next', 'week', 'heaven', 'somewhere', 'Chips', 'replies', 'heaven', 'certainly', 'smiling', 'Kathrine.The', 'music', 'love', 'Walk', 'World', 'Schooldays', 'World', 'Love', 'moody', 'Where', 'Did', 'My', 'Childhood', 'Go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'step', 'off', 'plane', 'Heathrow', 'catchy', 'lyrics', 'London', 'London', 'spinning', 'head', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'definitely', 'live', 'Sky', 'Smiled', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Ross', 'number', 'first-time', 'father', 'new', 'camcorder', 'Even', 'so', 'John', 'Williams', 'orchestrates', 'film', 'dramatic', 'style', 'would', 'later', 'bring', 'own', 'scores', 'next', 'decade.Backstage', 'note', 'have', 'asked', 'Why', 'make', 'musical', 'Goodby', 'Mr', 'Chips', 'Arthur', 'P.', 'Jacobs', 'answer', '1964', 'was', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'directed', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'score', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'finding', 'right', 'format', 'score', 'was', 'difficult', 'Previn', 'writing', 'discarding', 'songs', 'Jacobs', 'had', 'go', 'forward', 'other', 'projects', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'result', 'lost', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'stepped', 'then', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'replaced', 'Previn', 'composer', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'signed', 'Burton', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'took', 'up', 'part.Fan', 'note', 'Did', 'know', '3', 'CD', 'set', 'entire', 'score', 'songs', 'background', 'music', 'contents', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'LP', 'PLUS', 'outtakes', 'alternate', 'versions', 'interviews', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'cast', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'ChipsIf', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'then', 'Google']",N/A

I had read the reviews (but most critics panned musicals no matter how much they really enjoyed them). I hadn't read anything that credited the tremendous quality lavished on every component of the film.  Peter O'Toole, whose performance was singled out by most critics, is startlingly wonderful as the shy, yet intensely interesting Mr. Chippings.  Petula Clark is totally luminous as Katherine. It was a wonderful follow-up role to her stunning debut in ""Finian's Rainbow"".  We are most unfortunate that we never got more of her musical talents on film.The music is stunning. You just don't hear music arranged/orchestrated like this any more.  Most of the lyrics are simplistic, and often quite funny, but I think they all are endearing and enduring.  I have friends who love this film as much as I.  Whenever one of us is ready for another look (via the widescreen MGM laserdisc...not YET available on DVD, drat it!) we usually let the others know by quoting the lyrics to ""London is London"" (can there be any doubt about it?).This film stands up much better than most film musicals of the era.  For sheer entertainment value and an emotional wallop, it's nearly in a class by itself.  O'Toole's then-wife, Sian Phillips, has one of the most delicious turns in film musical history as a man-mad (and man-eating) vamp.Anyone who loves musicals will find this among the best they've ever seen.John Williams adapted and conducted the score.  Songs were written by Leslie Bricusse.  Williams' adaptation efforts were to take Bricusse's songs and create an underscore that seamlessly blended with the songs and action on the film.  He accomplished this with a brilliance we have since become accustomed to.  For his magnificent efforts, Williams was nominated for the 1969 Best Scoring (adaptation) Oscar but did NOT win (Lennie Hayton and Lionel Newman won for ""Hello, Dolly!""",5,"""Chips"" is glorious!",1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1953,"['Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'was', 'huge', 'surprise', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1969', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'most', 'critics', 'panned', 'musicals', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'credited', 'tremendous', 'quality', 'lavished', 'component', 'film', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'performance', 'was', 'singled', 'out', 'most', 'critics', 'startlingly', 'wonderful', 'shy', 'yet', 'intensely', 'interesting', 'Mr.', 'Chippings', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'totally', 'luminous', 'Katherine', 'was', 'wonderful', 'follow-up', 'role', 'stunning', 'debut', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'are', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'never', 'got', 'more', 'musical', 'talents', 'film.The', 'music', 'stunning', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'music', 'arranged/orchestrated', 'more', 'Most', 'lyrics', 'are', 'simplistic', 'often', 'quite', 'funny', 'think', 'are', 'endearing', 'enduring', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'love', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Whenever', 'one', 'ready', 'look', 'widescreen', 'MGM', 'laserdisc', 'not', 'YET', 'available', 'DVD', 'usually', 'let', 'others', 'know', 'quoting', 'lyrics', 'London', 'London', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'doubt', '.This', 'film', 'up', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'film', 'musicals', 'era', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'value', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'nearly', 'class', ""O'Toole"", 'then-wife', 'Sian', 'Phillips', 'one', 'most', 'delicious', 'turns', 'film', 'musical', 'history', 'man-mad', 'man-eating', 'vamp.Anyone', 'who', 'musicals', 'will', 'find', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.John', 'Williams', 'adapted', 'conducted', 'score', 'Songs', 'were', 'written', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'Williams', 'adaptation', 'efforts', 'were', 'take', 'Bricusse', 'songs', 'create', 'underscore', 'seamlessly', 'blended', 'songs', 'action', 'film', 'accomplished', 'brilliance', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'magnificent', 'efforts', 'Williams', 'was', 'nominated', '1969', 'Best', 'Scoring', 'adaptation', 'Oscar', 'did', 'NOT', 'win', 'Lennie', 'Hayton', 'Lionel', 'Newman', 'won', 'Hello', 'Dolly']",N/A

288829,A3HAIQAPJCTOSH,6301980697,Steve R.,"[12, 14]","&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; is a classic, sentimental tale about a reserved British schoolmaster (Peter O'Toole) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful show girl (Petula Clark).  The dour school teacher and the  flamboyant show girl stand in stark contrast to one another, yet they share  a love and devotion that only deepens through the years.  Slowly, the  classics teacher emerges from his shell to become a much beloved figure to  generations of young boys who profit from his teaching and guidance at the  mythical Brookfield School in England.Peter O'Toole is a versatile  actor whose range has been exhibited in his role as the driven scholar,  warrior, and Messiah in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; as the comic and  cunning art thief in &quot;How to Steal a Million,&quot; and here, in his  touching and affecting performance as Arthur Chipping, schoolmaster.

288832,ANGOCQKP4EARN,6301980697,"S. W. Best ""Avid Reader""","[0, 6]","Let's begin by saying that movie musicals are a breed apart.  The very artifice of musicals removes them from the mainstream realism of other film genres.  That's why we love musicals: they are romanticised interpretations of a story that is conceptually and inherently sentimental.The late 60's and early 70's saw the musical interpretation of classic novels such as ""A Christmas Carol"", ""Oliver Twist"", ""Don Quixote"", ""Lost Horizon"" and this re-make of ""Goodbye Mr. Chips.""  Historically, film musicals had seen better days by the late 60's and Hollywood attempted to revitalize the medium by creating less romanticized versions of these highly romanticized tales.  In other words, make the stories relevant to the times (the 1960's).""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", while well-produced, fails on all levels to meet the romanticised sentimentality inherent in musicals.  It also misinterpreted the simplicity of James Hilton's original novella, so beautifully (and non-musically) created by MGM in 1939 with Robert Donat and Greer Garson.The device of Chipping's wife having a lurid past that leads to political on-campus blackmail is so far off the mark from Hilton's original to be laughable at best.  And most remarkably, Peter O'Toole's interpetation of the title character shows no emotional growth out of his crusty persona.  He is just as cranky after his marriage as he was before.  The most poignant aspect of the story is the softening of his heart through marriage.  O'Toole's performance just doesn't seem to show the audience any such growth.  And thereby hangs the problem.  The film erases all sentimentality from the story in order to make it more palatable to then-modern tastes.  As for his singing?  Rex Harrison may have gotten away with ""speak-singing"" in ""My Fair Lady"", but Peter O'Toole has neither the charm nor the charisma to pull it off.Then there is Petula Clark's character: a successful musical comedy star with very sophisticated London friends would much prefer to live in the country as a schoolmaster's wife?  Highly unlikely.  It seems obvious that MGM wanted to cash in on Petula Clark's success as a pop singer and reinterpreted this role to suit that need.  That being said, her portrayal is quite good.Then, there is the problem of Leslie Bricusse's horrendous score.  No song is memorable, let alone singable, and the use of sung-over soliloquies is annoying.  Outside of ""London is London"", the film should have been left non-musical.  And shortened by 45 minutes.  Actually, if it had never been made at all, we wouldn't have missed much.I give it 3 stars exclusively for its production values.  Beautiful cinematography, excellent costuming and passable acting.  If you want to enjoy the beauty of Hilton's original, watch Robert Donat's masterful 1939 performance instead.",3,A Disappointing Retelling of the Classic Tale,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,2808,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'movie', 'musicals', 'are', 'breed', 'apart', 'very', 'artifice', 'musicals', 'removes', 'mainstream', 'realism', 'other', 'film', 'genres', 'why', 'love', 'musicals', 'are', 'romanticised', 'interpretations', 'story', 'conceptually', 'inherently', 'sentimental.The', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'saw', 'musical', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'novels', 'such', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Lost', 'Horizon', 're-make', 'Goodbye', 'Mr', 'Chips', 'Historically', 'film', 'musicals', 'had', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'late', '60', 'Hollywood', 'attempted', 'revitalize', 'medium', 'creating', 'less', 'romanticized', 'versions', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'tales', 'other', 'words', 'make', 'stories', 'relevant', 'times', '1960', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'well-produced', 'fails', 'levels', 'meet', 'romanticised', 'sentimentality', 'inherent', 'musicals', 'also', 'misinterpreted', 'simplicity', 'James', 'Hilton', 'original', 'novella', 'so', 'beautifully', 'non-musically', 'created', 'MGM', '1939', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'Greer', 'Garson.The', 'device', 'Chipping', 'wife', 'having', 'lurid', 'past', 'political', 'on-campus', 'blackmail', 'so', 'far', 'mark', 'Hilton', 'original', 'be', 'laughable', 'best', 'most', 'remarkably', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'interpetation', 'title', 'character', 'emotional', 'growth', 'crusty', 'persona', 'just', 'cranky', 'marriage', 'was', 'before', 'most', 'poignant', 'aspect', 'story', 'softening', 'heart', 'marriage', ""O'Toole"", 'performance', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'show', 'audience', 'such', 'growth', 'thereby', 'problem', 'film', 'sentimentality', 'story', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'then-modern', 'tastes', 'singing', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'speak-singing', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'charm', 'charisma', 'pull', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'character', 'successful', 'musical', 'comedy', 'star', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'London', 'friends', 'would', 'much', 'prefer', 'live', 'country', 'schoolmaster', 'wife', 'Highly', 'unlikely', 'obvious', 'MGM', 'wanted', 'cash', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'success', 'pop', 'singer', 'reinterpreted', 'role', 'suit', 'need', 'being', 'said', 'portrayal', 'quite', 'good.Then', 'problem', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'horrendous', 'score', 'song', 'memorable', 'let', 'alone', 'singable', 'use', 'sung-over', 'soliloquies', 'annoying', 'London', 'London', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'non-musical', 'shortened', '45', 'minutes', 'Actually', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'much.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'exclusively', 'production', 'values', 'Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'costuming', 'passable', 'acting', 'want', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'Hilton', 'original', 'watch', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'masterful', '1939', 'performance', 'instead']",N/A
288833,A1103Y2G3Y7TEO,6301980697,"Thomas C. Rizzo, Jr.","[13, 14]","Thirty years after the 1939 classic film won Robert Donat an Oscar and made Greer Garson a star, ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version. Original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn were given the heave-ho in favor of - thankfully - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one eventually used was composed by - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. First-time director Herbert Ross was handed the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for both his wife and students - into a big-budget extravaganza. That it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars.Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boys' school in suburban England where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially inept, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Prior to summer holiday, a former student takes him to a London music hall to see an entertainment starring Katharine Bridges, the young lady he hopes to wed. The post-performance meeting is awkward for all, and Chips - as he is commonly known - sets off to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. Unexpectedly, he runs into Katharine, who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and ponder the direction of her career. In the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior, and upon returning to London pursues him in earnest. When the fall term begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past surface, and again when World War II intrudes in their lives, but Chips is bolstered by his wife's support, and his new-found confidence makes him a favorite among the students.Aside from three of the musical interludes - the delightful music hall production number ""London is London,"" Katharine's marriage proposal of sorts, ""Walk Through the World,"" and her declaration of love, ""You and I"" - most of Bricusse's songs, some of them performed in voice-over as the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film. Eliminate the score entirely, and ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" works exceedingly well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original while expanding upon it and updating it by a couple of decades. He has crafted several scenes between Chips and Katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other, and infused a few with comic relief courtesy of Katharine's friend and cohort, over-the-top actress Ursula Mossbank (delightfully played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's real-life wife at the time). He also captures life at a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the States - with unerring perfection.Ross does well as a first-time director, liberally sprinkling the film with breathtakingly photographed moments - the opening credits sequence, during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone hallways of the school, perfectly sets the tone for the film. Costumes and sets are true to the period. The students, portrayed by non-professionals who were enrolled at the school used as Brookfield, handle their various small supporting roles well.Highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. O'Toole was long-established as a first-class dramatic actor, so his Academy Award-nominated performance here comes as no surprise. Clark, a veteran of some two dozen B-movies in the UK and the previous year's ""Finian's Rainbow,"" is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who forsakes a theatrical career in favor of life as a schoolmaster's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are, and she more than matches O'Toole in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love.This version of ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" is hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released. Ignore the score, concentrate on the performances, and revel in the atmosphere Ross has put on the screen.

The title credits reveal such names as Oswald Morris (photography), John Williams (musical direction), Terence Rattigan (screenplay) and Herbert Ross (director). Such an impressive line-up leaves us in no doubt that the producers were pitching for a smash-hit to rival My Fair Lady or The Sound of Music . Why, then, Leslie Bricusse? The presence of his name virtually guarantees dullness. As expected, only one or two numbers (the School Song, perhaps, and London is London) come close to the target, and the rest are almost unbelievably banal. Only John Williams's lively orchestrations save the musical numbers from total failure.O'Toole is bereft of Robert Donat's charm, and even seems heartless at times, rather than merely shy and inept. Indeed, in the first few scenes he appears to be a rescusitation of Andrew Crocker-Harris, the cold schoolmaster from ""The Browning Version"", which is no coincidence, since they share the same writer, Terence Rattigan. Otherwise, the screenplay is one of the most satisfying aspects of the production. In fact, as a drama it is reasonably successful; unfortunately, Bricusse's songs are only sporadically hummable (the lyrics are atrocious), as usual, and weaken what could have been a much better film. The makers of Goodbye, Mr Chips had a lot to live up to, the story having been memorably filmed some thirty years earlier, so it is no surprise that they miss the mark.
