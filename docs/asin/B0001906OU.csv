796181,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B0001906OU,Deborah P,"[1, 1]","Sections: 1) Warm up--admittedly short 2) Technique 3)The combinations of different steps--with four repeats 4)Choreography done in numbered sets, with a full run through the choreography at the end. 5) The dance done in a club setting.The combinations leading to a real dance make you feel like you're really accomplishing something--like you're a real dancer! I love her videos for the choreography. So long as you have most of your technique down (some of it from other beginnner videos) you'll love learning her dance.The number of repetitions (four) when she teaches the combinations might have been fine IF she had put a chapter separatation at the beginning of each one. I mean, if you want to repeat combination number six more than four times, you have to rewind to the correct time because she only has the five large sections separated by chapter--which is absolutely maddening at times. I'd have given this DVD 4.5 stars for the chapter problem and the too-short technique section if I could.",5,This girl is all about the choreography,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,1004,"['Sections', '1', 'Warm', 'up', 'admittedly', 'short', '2', 'Technique', '3', 'combinations', 'different', 'steps', 'four', 'repeats', '4', 'Choreography', 'done', 'numbered', 'sets', 'full', 'run', 'choreography', 'end', '5', 'dance', 'done', 'club', 'setting.The', 'combinations', 'leading', 'real', 'dance', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'really', 'accomplishing', 'something', ""'re"", 'real', 'dancer', 'love', 'videos', 'choreography', 'So', 'long', 'have', 'most', 'technique', 'down', 'other', 'beginnner', 'videos', ""'ll"", 'love', 'learning', 'dance.The', 'number', 'repetitions', 'four', 'when', 'combinations', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'IF', 'had', 'put', 'chapter', 'separatation', 'beginning', 'one', 'mean', 'want', 'repeat', 'combination', 'number', 'six', 'more', 'four', 'times', 'have', 'rewind', 'correct', 'time', 'only', 'five', 'large', 'sections', 'separated', 'chapter', 'absolutely', 'maddening', 'times', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'DVD', '4.5', 'stars', 'chapter', 'problem', 'too-short', 'technique', 'section', 'could']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 2

796183,A17O6HJ97XZTDV,B0001906OU,dreamkitaro,"[0, 0]",Jillina strong point is her choreographies and it shows in this DVD.  Very well produced dvd.  It starts off with a sample performance in costume of the choreography she will teach.  She then does a quick warm-up.  She goes into teaching some movements.  From there she shows combinations 1st without music then practicing with music.  She then proceeds to teach the choreography which is the combinations previously taught just slightly varied.  She keeps patiently building onto the choreography.  In the end she performs in the end in costume.  From her she injects her great sense of showmanship.Jillina's outfit is beautiful yet functional while she is teaching.  You can see her clearly from the background.I would recommend this for intermediate and advanced dancers.  I don't think she goes into enough detail for a beginner.,4,Great choreography dvd for intermediate/advance dancers,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,833,"['Jillina', 'strong', 'point', 'choreographies', 'DVD', 'Very', 'well', 'produced', 'dvd', 'sample', 'performance', 'costume', 'choreography', 'will', 'teach', 'then', 'quick', 'warm-up', 'teaching', 'movements', 'combinations', '1st', 'music', 'then', 'practicing', 'music', 'then', 'teach', 'choreography', 'combinations', 'previously', 'taught', 'just', 'slightly', 'varied', 'patiently', 'building', 'choreography', 'end', 'end', 'costume', 'great', 'sense', 'showmanship.Jillina', 'outfit', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'functional', 'teaching', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'background.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'dancers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'detail', 'beginner']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 2

796185,A2BGA1OOONP7MJ,B0001906OU,"S. Pernsley ""Ameretat""","[10, 12]","I took a workshop with her about three years ago.  She was great.  I was excited when I ordered her DVDs this past Friday.  Kudoos to Amazon with thier fast shipping(ordered on Friday got it on a Tuesday).  Well to the DVD.  I am not a professional but a student first off.  I am not sure what the person was talking about in regards to the camera.  During the lesson, the camera *always* showed her body or the part she was working on.  None of that on the face or breasts while she demostrated.  I loved the fact that she broke the movements down and then slowly went faster.  I loved the way she broke up how you get the dance all together.  A comb at a time and then adding more as she goes along.  This was really great.  I would recommend for a person to buy this series as well as go to see her live at a show or workshop.  And Jillina if you are reading this. . .You are really great!  Thanks for teaching your skills.  Oh, and being a bellydancer doesn't mean doing ""cookie cutter moves"".

796186,AHO459WLOGSKZ,B0001906OU,Tamara,"[3, 9]","This is a VERY superficial instruction. Most importantly, where is drilling?! Jillina just dances at high speed, and expects not-so-advanced students to follow along.That could still have some value if her dancing was truly beautiful. But I find it boring. She doesn't come across as enjoying herself. During instruction she looks bored, and her occasional fake smiling doesn't help. During dancing she perked up, but her perky counting only killed my already weak desire to follow her. I need to learn how to dance; I already know how to count, thanks!This just looks like a home video made by Jillina's friend (apparently after a good number of drinks) at their leisure. There is nothing professional about it.",1,Jillina cannot teach nor can she inspire,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,712,"['VERY', 'superficial', 'instruction', 'Most', 'importantly', 'where', 'drilling', 'Jillina', 'just', 'dances', 'high', 'speed', 'not-so-advanced', 'students', 'follow', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'value', 'dancing', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'find', 'boring', ""n't"", 'come', 'enjoying', 'instruction', 'bored', 'occasional', 'fake', 'smiling', ""n't"", 'help', 'dancing', 'perked', 'up', 'perky', 'counting', 'only', 'killed', 'already', 'weak', 'desire', 'follow', 'need', 'learn', 'how', 'dance', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'count', 'thanks', 'just', 'home', 'video', 'made', 'Jillina', 'friend', 'apparently', 'good', 'number', 'drinks', 'leisure', 'nothing', 'professional']",Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 2
796187,A29V9Z89OH03YR,B0001906OU,Tamii,"[14, 14]","This tape consists 5 sections:1. Stretching2. Technique3. Combinations4. Choreography5. PerformanceIn the stretching section, there is a brief warm-up routine to get your muscles warmed up and stretched.  Some people may need to do more stretching, but I'm glad this is a short part of the tape as I like the way it focuses more on learning the combinations and choreography.In the technique section, the moves that will be used in the choreography are explained and shown with preciness.  Jillina is very good at explaining how your body should move when doing a movement.  The camera is very good at showing the foot work and belly movements.The combinations section goes over the combos that will be used in the choreography.  In my review of Jillina's first tape, I was not a fan of this section, but now I am because it helps learning the final choreography, which has some slight variations from the combinations. This tape may seem difficult at first, but if you follow the combinations and learn them, the choreography will be so much easier to learn!The choreography section is where practice is given to learning the dance.  It is broken down into 8 combinations and the dance is repeated from the beginning at each new combination. The dance is dramatic, sexy and playful.  It begins with slow movements, then speeds up a bit and incorporates one floor movement with head swings.The performance part of this tape is where we get to see Jillina perform a version of the dance.  It's a full belly dance performance and the audience gets to see her incorporate the dance taught in the tape into her performance.  No, it's not the dance taught exactly like it is on the tape as Jillina is a professional dancer and not a beginner so you'll see her put her professional stamp on the choreography.  Just enjoy!It's a wonderful performance by a true belly dance professional!I'd recommend this tape for intermediate dancers who have had some instruction from real instructors.
