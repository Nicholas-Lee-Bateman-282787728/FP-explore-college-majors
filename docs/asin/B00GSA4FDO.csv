It's bad entertainment  not a capturing or captivating flick and it's easy to predict close to every move and action made.

1680365,A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ,B00GSA4FDO,Daniel W. Kelly,"[1, 3]","This little indie flick proves that you can deliver intense scares with a minuscule budget and minimal CGI. I knew as the movie progressed that this was going to be one of my all-time favorite found footage films, a generally hit or miss horror subgenre. The plot is just what you&#8217;d expect; a group of friends gets together and messes with a board while one friend films it. Right off the bat, anyone who has used a Ouija board will appreciate the authenticity of the movement of the planchette: the way it begins to take on a life of its own, the frantic patterns it seems to follow, and the moments when it&#8217;s going so fast it kind of jumps out from under your fingers.We meet a refreshingly diverse and likable group. After their characters and relationships are set up through some lighthearted, funny exchanges, we get right into the Ouija action. And that&#8217;s where the slow burn begins. There&#8217;s a natural buildup to the eventual unleashing of a malevolent spirit. When the evil finally escapes, the tension and terror totally spikes. This is some of the best use of camera POV to deliver jump scares and ghost appearances that I&#8217;ve seen yet in a found footage film. It really rivals most of the visual shocks in the Paranormal Activity franchise.And speaking of, director Israel Luna is well aware of his inspirations for the film and makes sure the characters reference them: The Entity, Paranormal Activity, Witchboard (including a funny reference to the Whitesnake connection). There&#8217;s even what seems to be a wink to The Blair Witch Project involving someone standing in a corner. Creepy.As with most found footage films, you can expect a few instances of questionable continuity. Why, for instance, does one chick seem doubtful of one of the guys having seen ghosts after she had a major ghost confrontation herself&#8230;which she doesn&#8217;t even mention? And there&#8217;s the usual pondering of why they never put down the camera&#8212;but here, they are pretty much intent on documenting what&#8217;s happening and don&#8217;t particularly believe the ghosts mean them harm because they think they&#8217;ve befriended them through the Ouija board.The series of ghost sequences in the second half of the movie are brilliantly handled. I nearly peed myself a few times. And eventually, we get a flashback segment showing the malevolent ghost&#8217;s motivation, which is like a short horror film in itself, complete with a great little twist. And the surprises don&#8217;t stop coming until the very end of the movie.Sure, it&#8217;s a found footage flick and a Ouija board flick, but the exclamation point at the conclusion of The Ouija Experiment reminds us that it is also one hell of a ghost story.",5,Ouija board horror done found footage style!,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2752,"['little', 'indie', 'flick', 'can', 'deliver', 'intense', 'scares', 'minuscule', 'budget', 'minimal', 'CGI', 'knew', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'generally', 'hit', 'miss', 'horror', 'subgenre', 'plot', 'just', 'what', '8217', 'd', 'expect', 'group', 'friends', 'together', 'board', 'one', 'friend', 'Right', 'bat', 'anyone', 'who', 'used', 'Ouija', 'board', 'will', 'appreciate', 'authenticity', 'movement', 'planchette', 'way', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'frantic', 'patterns', 'follow', 'moments', 'when', '8217', 'going', 'so', 'fast', 'kind', 'jumps', 'fingers.We', 'meet', 'refreshingly', 'diverse', 'likable', 'group', 'characters', 'relationships', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'lighthearted', 'funny', 'exchanges', 'get', 'right', 'Ouija', 'action', '8217', 'where', 'slow', 'burn', '8217', 's', 'natural', 'buildup', 'eventual', 'unleashing', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'When', 'evil', 'finally', 'tension', 'terror', 'totally', 'best', 'use', 'camera', 'POV', 'deliver', 'jump', 'scares', 'ghost', 'appearances', '8217', 'seen', 'yet', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'really', 'most', 'visual', 'shocks', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'franchise.And', 'speaking', 'director', 'Israel', 'Luna', 'well', 'aware', 'inspirations', 'film', 'sure', 'characters', 'reference', 'Entity', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Witchboard', 'including', 'funny', 'reference', 'Whitesnake', 'connection', '8217', 's', 'even', 'what', 'be', 'wink', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'involving', 'someone', 'standing', 'corner', 'Creepy.As', 'most', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'can', 'expect', 'few', 'instances', 'questionable', 'continuity', 'Why', 'instance', 'one', 'chick', 'seem', 'doubtful', 'one', 'guys', 'having', 'seen', 'ghosts', 'had', 'major', 'ghost', 'confrontation', '8230', 'doesn', '8217', 'even', 'mention', '8217', 's', 'usual', 'pondering', 'why', 'never', 'put', 'down', 'camera', '8212', 'here', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'intent', 'documenting', 'what', '8217', 'happening', 'don', '8217', 'particularly', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'mean', 'harm', 'think', '8217', 've', 'befriended', 'Ouija', 'board.The', 'series', 'ghost', 'sequences', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'handled', 'nearly', 'peed', 'few', 'times', 'eventually', 'get', 'flashback', 'segment', 'showing', 'malevolent', 'ghost', '8217', 'motivation', 'short', 'horror', 'film', 'complete', 'great', 'little', 'twist', 'surprises', 'don', '8217', 'stop', 'coming', 'very', 'end', 'movie.Sure', '8217', 's', 'found', 'footage', 'flick', 'Ouija', 'board', 'flick', 'exclamation', 'point', 'conclusion', 'Ouija', 'Experiment', 'also', 'one', 'hell', 'ghost', 'story']",The Ouija Experiment

1680369,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00GSA4FDO,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[7, 9]","This is a hand held camera film about a group of people filming themselves &#34;playing&#34; with a Ouija board. Michael (Justin Armstrong) owns the board. He is joined by his friend Calvin, a player (Eric Window), Cal's latest girlfriend Shay (Belmarie Huynh) and Calvin's sister L'nette (Swisyzinna  Moore). This is all being filmed by Brandon (Carson Underwood) for his web site, although it appears everyone owns a camera.The board of course contacts spirits. Shay asks the board questions about Calvin and his other girlfriends and gets an answer only Michael, who has his finger on the pointer, would know. Meanwhile Brandon looks up the names of the people mentioned by the board.The film is based on the idea that the Ouija board can act as a portal between the two worlds if you don't hang up, or in this case say &#34;good-bye.&#34; According to my occult knowledge, that is not exactly true. However black mirrors if uncovered are supposed to supply a portal for spirits.I liked the idea of the film, maybe because it is a common theme done so many times before. In this particular production, it was not done well. The dialouge was fairly bad. There was wasted footage of people playing around. Seeing a Ouija board pointer move is a let down after we have seen a pool crawler get out of the water. Yes, we do see ghosts and there is a flashback to their lives.I don't recommend this film unless you are really really into the hand held filming.Parental Guide: No F-bombs that I recall.
