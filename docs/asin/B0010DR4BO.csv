1125123,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0010DR4BO,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[42, 53]","Jesse James is a legend, but an outlaw for which I knew little.  In the opening scene about a dozen men are stretched out in front of a campfire, eating vittles and talking.  Self-proclaimed as ""gregarious,"" Jesse (Brad Pitt) enjoys speculating on the love lives of both Presidents,  proclaiming that Jefferson Davis is virile enough for his wife; while Lincoln is more than a little languid.  It is here that we get his personality and the component of his post Civil War motives.  It is also in this scene the film establishes the centrality of Jesse in the hierarchy of things, and it is through Hugh Ross's narration that Jesse is understood to be both skillful and fortunate, a cat with nine lives who has used up all but three.On the outskirts of the parleying is greenhorn, Bob Ford (Casey Affleck), a James' Gang wannabe.  Yet from the hideaway at his sister's place in Kansas City, it is clear from a box found underneath his bed that his notions of Jesse are from books and pamphlets with romanticized notions of train robberies and banditry.  Swirling around this nave figure are all Jesse's cousins.  There's the ladies' man, Dick Liddell (played playfully and intently by Paul Schneider) and his brother, Andrew James, whose treason winds him like a ticking clock.  There's also a close reading of Charlie and Wood who each keep us guessing as to what will happen next.  Once the governor of Missouri (James Carville whose laudable performance shows his intensity for acting can be channeled just as strongly as for politics) gets a hold of them, we are really kept on our toes.Once Ford's in, all the components of treachery and fate hang around each man's head.  As he becomes privy to all, his education, understandably, has him liking his direction far less.  As the noose tightens on all the key players, the suspense grows as to which member will be done in by Jesse, which ones by the law, and which by the conspiring traitors.  Each man has to take sides, but the choices get grimmer with each passing day.Jesse, having a nose for treachery, is always on the look-out.  Getting each suspect alone, he fishes them out through questioning, while the fidgeting figure hems and haws his way out of the cross-examination whether guilty or innocent.  This is the movie's real magic.  Between the quiet, cocky confidence of Pitt's performance and the unsettling portrayals of the supporting players, insecurity has a tangible mood throughout the film.`The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Bob Ford' sure takes its time.  They could have carved their film down by about twenty minutes, but that is mainly nitpicking. At times the film seems as long as its title.  However, the languorous scenes where Jesse is talking to his compatriots have the effect of a poker table.  Everyone is waiting nervously for either a big payoff or to get shot or both. The tense behavior by all the designated players is so intense we feel we're a part of their table.And when you're watching a Western that's as close as you wanna be.(Based on a novel by Ron Hansen)",4,"""Don't Let Him Get Behind You""",1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,3071,"['Jesse', 'James', 'legend', 'outlaw', 'knew', 'little', 'opening', 'scene', 'dozen', 'men', 'are', 'stretched', 'out', 'front', 'campfire', 'eating', 'vittles', 'talking', 'Self-proclaimed', 'gregarious', 'Jesse', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'speculating', 'love', 'Presidents', 'proclaiming', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'virile', 'enough', 'wife', 'Lincoln', 'more', 'little', 'languid', 'here', 'get', 'personality', 'component', 'post', 'Civil', 'War', 'motives', 'also', 'scene', 'film', 'centrality', 'Jesse', 'hierarchy', 'things', 'Hugh', 'Ross', 'narration', 'Jesse', 'understood', 'be', 'skillful', 'fortunate', 'cat', 'nine', 'lives', 'who', 'used', 'up', 'three.On', 'outskirts', 'parleying', 'greenhorn', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'James', 'Gang', 'wannabe', 'hideaway', 'sister', 'place', 'Kansas', 'City', 'clear', 'box', 'found', 'bed', 'notions', 'Jesse', 'are', 'books', 'pamphlets', 'romanticized', 'notions', 'train', 'robberies', 'banditry', 'Swirling', 'nave', 'figure', 'are', 'Jesse', 'cousins', 'ladies', 'man', 'Dick', 'Liddell', 'played', 'playfully', 'intently', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'brother', 'Andrew', 'James', 'treason', 'ticking', 'clock', 'also', 'close', 'reading', 'Charlie', 'Wood', 'who', 'keep', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'governor', 'Missouri', 'James', 'Carville', 'laudable', 'performance', 'intensity', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'channeled', 'just', 'as', 'strongly', 'politics', 'hold', 'are', 'really', 'kept', 'toes.Once', 'Ford', 'components', 'treachery', 'fate', 'hang', 'man', 'head', 'privy', 'education', 'understandably', 'liking', 'direction', 'far', 'less', 'noose', 'tightens', 'key', 'players', 'suspense', 'member', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'Jesse', 'ones', 'law', 'conspiring', 'traitors', 'man', 'take', 'sides', 'choices', 'get', 'grimmer', 'passing', 'day.Jesse', 'having', 'nose', 'treachery', 'always', 'look-out', 'Getting', 'suspect', 'alone', 'out', 'questioning', 'fidgeting', 'figure', 'hems', 'haws', 'way', 'cross-examination', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'movie', 'real', 'magic', 'quiet', 'cocky', 'confidence', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'unsettling', 'portrayals', 'supporting', 'players', 'insecurity', 'tangible', 'mood', 'film.', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'sure', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'carved', 'film', 'down', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'mainly', 'nitpicking', 'times', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'title', 'However', 'languorous', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jesse', 'talking', 'compatriots', 'have', 'effect', 'poker', 'table', 'Everyone', 'waiting', 'nervously', 'big', 'payoff', 'get', 'shot', 'tense', 'behavior', 'designated', 'players', 'so', 'intense', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'table.And', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Western', 'as', 'close', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'Based', 'novel', 'Ron', 'Hansen']",N/A

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 5]","Beautiful photography and haunting music enhance this dreamy evocation of brutal life in Missouri in the years following the Civil War. It is also enhanced by fine performances by Pitt as the sociopath and paranoid Jesse James and by Affleck as the childish boy-man who hero worships him.Affleck's Robert Ford is an archetype of the modern fan who takes his admiration for the celebrity a little too far, like the man who stalked Jodie Foster and several similar cases. But I never quite got an angle on his changeable character. He shows flashes of courage as well his own lust for celebrity. The movie suggests Ford kills James because it is his only way to achieve fame for himself.Having said all this, the movie is very long and moves very slowly. It leaves many questions unanswered. Jesse's wife and family are unexplored characters and we never really know why a man who sleeps with a gun in his hand turns his back on his killer and allows himself to be killed. The final 20 minutes after the assassination may be the most interesting. Ford achieves fame but is labeled a coward and is himself stalked by a jealous ""fan.""

1125131,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B0010DR4BO,Alric the Red,"[2, 3]","The first time I saw this on DVD, I was transfixed by the sheer majesty of it, thinking how THIS would be one to savor on Blu-ray.  For starters, the story is told with such a clear voice, it establishes a proximity to the events that feels almost like a documentary.  The narrative languors in the superb cinematography by Roger Deakins, who turned the landscapes into portraiture, suffusing every scene in a Wyeth-like beauty.  It's a perfect backdrop for contemplating the American myth, stripping the national character down to its harshest tones, requiring everything to the horizon as the stage to fully reveal it.  Left with a rustic palette, a flavor of early photography is alluded to in some shots with a very shallow depth of field, so that the edges are blurry.  The costumes were practically monochromatic, completing the film's simple authenticity, reminding me of the daguerreotypes of flinty-eyed anonymous ancestors etched by their hardscrabble ways.  I think it's one of the most beautiful westerns I've ever seen.  And not just in the way it looked, but in the way the story unfolds through an economy of dialogue and action, the actors subsuming themselves to the portrait-like tone of the film.  Some people complained it moved too slowly, but, to me, it was a rich character study, and as such, there was always something happening, not necessarily as pivotal chronological events, but as tense exchanges between personalities.  The pacing isn't slow as much as it is gradual and deliberate.  This isn't just cinema; it's a meditation on American character, on myth and celebrity.  It's hypnotic.As for the acting, Brad Pitt had just the right amount of star power to inhabit the personality of the charismatic and mercurial Jesse James.  In response, Casey Affleck had a way of averting his eyes that was brilliant in its simplicity in depicting Robert Ford's obsequious sidling-up to Jesse while assessing every word for signs of acceptance.  But it wasn't just these two.  Sam Rockwell turned in an excellent low-keyed performance as Robert's cautious, more experienced older brother Charley, who as an affable bumpkin always feared Jesse's penetrating gaze as if the gang leader might be omniscient.  The rest of the cast was filled with top-notch character actors, some famous, some not so famous, but forming an ensemble of solid players.  And of course, all of this fine photography and acting was arranged into perfect pace by director Andrew Dominik.  I can't even imagine how he thought it up.  This is a film so close to perfect, it's unquestionably a modern masterpiece.  I'm frustrated that this movie wasn't greeted with more fanfare.Of course I was excited about the Blu-ray, and it was gorgeous, one I'll watch again and again.  The disappointment was the extra features.  The only bonus on the disc was a single 30-minute documentary about the real Jesse James.  It was certainly interesting enough, but I wanted to know more about the aesthetics of the creative minds behind this masterpiece.  A few words about the film itself from director Dominik would have been appreciated, along with some comments about the cinematography, which was a key feature to this enriching experience.  In the aforementioned documentary you can see that scenes were shot for the film that didn't make it to the final cut.  What happened there?  I'd like to know more about those decisions, as it's a fact that something longer had been planned.  One of the film festivals screened a four-hour version (and Brad Pitt won the award for Best Actor).  I've read somewhere that there was a behind-the-scenes tug-of-war, with Pitt and the director on one side, the studio on the other.  The studio won with the shorter cut.  I think it was a mistake.  However, that leaves hope there's a Director's Cut in the future, that truer vision, in a special edition with loads of extras, at which point all will be revealed.  It's been done for lesser films.For now, there's not even a director commentary.___________________________",5,A Most Beautiful Western Resplendent in Blu-ray,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,4041,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'transfixed', 'sheer', 'majesty', 'thinking', 'how', 'THIS', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'savor', 'Blu-ray', 'starters', 'story', 'told', 'clear', 'voice', 'proximity', 'events', 'almost', 'documentary', 'narrative', 'languors', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'who', 'turned', 'landscapes', 'portraiture', 'suffusing', 'scene', 'Wyeth-like', 'beauty', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'contemplating', 'American', 'myth', 'stripping', 'national', 'character', 'down', 'harshest', 'tones', 'requiring', 'everything', 'horizon', 'stage', 'fully', 'reveal', 'Left', 'rustic', 'palette', 'flavor', 'early', 'photography', 'alluded', 'shots', 'very', 'shallow', 'depth', 'field', 'edges', 'are', 'blurry', 'costumes', 'were', 'practically', 'monochromatic', 'completing', 'film', 'simple', 'authenticity', 'reminding', 'daguerreotypes', 'flinty-eyed', 'anonymous', 'ancestors', 'etched', 'hardscrabble', 'ways', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'westerns', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'just', 'way', 'looked', 'way', 'story', 'economy', 'dialogue', 'action', 'actors', 'subsuming', 'portrait-like', 'tone', 'film', 'people', 'complained', 'moved', 'too', 'slowly', 'was', 'rich', 'character', 'study', 'such', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'happening', 'not', 'necessarily', 'pivotal', 'chronological', 'events', 'tense', 'exchanges', 'personalities', 'pacing', ""n't"", 'slow', 'as', 'much', 'gradual', 'deliberate', ""n't"", 'just', 'cinema', 'meditation', 'American', 'character', 'myth', 'celebrity', 'hypnotic.As', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'star', 'power', 'inhabit', 'personality', 'charismatic', 'mercurial', 'Jesse', 'James', 'response', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'had', 'way', 'averting', 'eyes', 'was', 'brilliant', 'simplicity', 'depicting', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'obsequious', 'sidling-up', 'Jesse', 'assessing', 'word', 'signs', 'acceptance', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'two', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'turned', 'excellent', 'low-keyed', 'performance', 'Robert', 'cautious', 'more', 'experienced', 'older', 'brother', 'Charley', 'who', 'affable', 'bumpkin', 'always', 'feared', 'Jesse', 'penetrating', 'gaze', 'gang', 'leader', 'might', 'be', 'omniscient', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'filled', 'top-notch', 'character', 'actors', 'famous', 'not', 'so', 'famous', 'forming', 'ensemble', 'solid', 'players', 'course', 'fine', 'photography', 'acting', 'was', 'arranged', 'perfect', 'pace', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'how', 'thought', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'close', 'perfect', 'unquestionably', 'modern', 'masterpiece', ""'m"", 'frustrated', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'greeted', 'more', 'fanfare.Of', 'course', 'was', 'excited', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'one', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'disappointment', 'was', 'extra', 'features', 'only', 'bonus', 'disc', 'was', 'single', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'real', 'Jesse', 'James', 'was', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'aesthetics', 'creative', 'minds', 'masterpiece', 'few', 'words', 'film', 'director', 'Dominik', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'comments', 'cinematography', 'was', 'key', 'feature', 'enriching', 'experience', 'aforementioned', 'documentary', 'can', 'see', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'What', 'happened', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'more', 'decisions', 'fact', 'something', 'longer', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'One', 'film', 'festivals', 'screened', 'four-hour', 'version', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'won', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', ""'ve"", 'read', 'somewhere', 'was', 'behind-the-scenes', 'tug-of-war', 'Pitt', 'director', 'one', 'side', 'studio', 'other', 'studio', 'won', 'shorter', 'cut', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'However', 'hope', 'Director', 'Cut', 'future', 'truer', 'vision', 'special', 'edition', 'loads', 'extras', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'been', 'done', 'lesser', 'films.For', 'now', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'commentary.___________________________']",N/A

1125133,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0010DR4BO,Andrew Ellington,"[13, 17]","There are a few elements that make a great movie; those elements, when exemplified, create a phenomenal movie.  `...Jesse James...' is just that; a phenomenal movie.  It embraces each and every quality at its disposal and personifies true artistic creation creating a film that is unlike any other and one you soon won't forget.  Everything, from the script to the acting, the direction, light, music, mood and especially the cinematography work in perfect unison to hand deliver a masterpiece of modern cinema.The script is the most essential piece of cinema for without a tightly woven one you can place you finest actors on the screen and you still will find yourself dumbfounded.  The great thing about `...Jesse James...' is that it takes its time and slowly unravels itself.  This year was filled with films that took their time; that slowed down and gave the audience a chance to really soak in the atmosphere of the film.  If you're looking for fast paced action flick with lots of blood-soaked sequences then you should look elsewhere.  `...Jesse James...' is not that type of film.  The violence, while brutal, is subtle and calming almost.  The film is much deeper than gunslingers and salon girls.  This is a movie about the heart of man, the inner workings of a killer and the man who idolized him.  At times it's almost spiritual.  There are scenes where you can hear conversations taking place off screen, conversations that are just within earshot that really don't pertain to the scene you're watching yet add so many layers to the depth of the film for they give you an almost personal look at the men involved here.  It's these small details within the script that make it all the more impressive.Much has been said about the cinematography for this film, and rightfully so.  Roger Deakin's had a great year this year with both `...Jesse James...' and `No Country for Old Men', this being, in my humble opinion, the greater of the two.  Each screen shot is gorgeous.  I remember looking at my wife about halfway through the film and whispering ""this is such a pretty movie"" and it truly is.  The way the camera captures the tall grass swaying in the breeze; the way the camera pans over the snow covered terrain; the way the camera speaks volumes during patches of silence.One major advantage to this film is director Andrew Dominik.  He maneuvers this film masterfully, creating such a reassuring sense of beauty and grace with tinges of unnerving savagery.  Dominik thankfully realized that depth of substance is much more important than a flashy display of talent; but what makes this all the more brilliant is that that flashy display is here full throttle wrapped up tightly within that depth.  Dominik has it all.  One scene in particular, where Robert saves Liddil's life, displays both of these qualities masterfully.  There is a calm and aching feeling throughout the scene, especially when you read between the lines in Casey Affleck's face, that breathe so much life into the scene but then there is that spot of blood that stains the top corner of the screen that screams visual flare.  It's probably in a nutshell the best scene in the film; flawless.There are many details that go into creating the perfect mood and they are all here on grand display.  The first thing I noticed was the musical score.  It's gentle and graceful yet it immediately gave me a tense feeling of dread.  This is also aided by the amazing use of colors and lighting.  The contrast of bright sceneries and cold dusty backdrops help elevate each scene by assigning it a specific feeling and emotion.  I remember feeling that way when watching 2005's `Capote', the details within each scene implanting an emotion deep within me, and `...Jesse James...' works in quite the same way.  One major compliment to the mood setting is the narration by High Ross.  It gives the film an almost documentary feel and helps establish the depth of character here.  It lets you know right away that this movie is about the men, about the persons that are these intricate creatures and that we are about to get an inside look at what made them who they are.And then there is the acting, and what an impressive cast there is here.  Brad Pitt steps into the title role of Jesse James while Casey Affleck (little brother to megastar Ben) steps into that `other' title role of Robert Ford, and both of them are amazing.  Brad Pitt has always been a talented actor, one that I enjoy immensely, and here as the famed Jesse James he delivers one of his finest and most complex performances.  He says so much with the movements of his face, with his penetrating stare alone and brilliantly captures the madness within this man.  There are scenes that really elevate his performance for me, scenes of an almost serene madness that is festering beneath the surface.  Casey Affleck though is by far the standout here.  His portrayal of Robert Ford is dynamic to put it bluntly.  He truly grasps the idolization in his eyes, the admiration in his gaze but subtly and realistically captures the shift in perspective, the disgust and resentment that forms in his soul for the very man he once held on such a pedestal.  It's a magnificent performance; truly mesmerizing.The entire cast is wonderful though, not just the two leads (yes I said `two leads' because Casey Affleck is inarguably the co-lead actor here).  Each and every supporting player adds layers to the film, most notably Paul Schneider who plays outlaw Liddil.  His performance is absorbing and intricate.  I love the little movements in his facial features that elicit shivers down my spine.  Sam Rockwell delivers too as Robert's simpler brother Charley, giving him a personal attachment to the audience.  Jeremy Renner is effective as Jesse's cousin Wood and Garret Dillahunt is memorable as the simpleton Ed Miller.  Sam Shepard has a very small yet pivotal role as Frank, Jesse's brother.  His opening scene with Casey Affleck sent chills down my spine.  Then we have Mary-Louise Parker who plays Jesse's wife Zee.  I thought she would have had a much larger role but her screen time is very limited; what she does with it though is anything but.This film tackles the consequences of idolization in such a breathtaking way you almost forget your studying someone's character.  You become a part of these people and you begin to feel their fears and admirations.  There is so much more to this film than meets the eye that you must really set yourself to understanding this film and deciphering its deeper meaning in order to find the utmost enjoyment here.`... Jesse James...' (I just LOVE the full title but this site won't let me post it!) is seriously one of the best films I've seen in recent years.

1125135,AY5ALNAA118ZL,B0010DR4BO,"A. Shane ""dresh""","[4, 6]","First off, from a commercial standpoint, the title sucks! Even the acronym is awkward. Artistically though, the unwieldy moniker perfectly captures the mood of the film: it's long, ironic, and full of subtle humor. Andrew Dominik, an Aussie freshman, scores an amazing directorial debut with a tale of the final months in the life of the world-famous Missouri outlaw (Brad Pitt) at the hands of an ambitious but lovable killer (Casey Affleck). Slow, yet never dull, long but tense, Jesse James completely fell through the cracks when it was released in the late Fall of '07. Nobody I know bothered to see it. What a shame, because this is a picture that is so superior to both of the year's top contenders, that it barely belongs in the same category!I'm not going to speculate about why Jesse James so utterly failed to find an audience, even among the film geeks. Maybe it was the fact that it's nearly 3 hours long, or that it's a Western (always a tough sell), or the fact that Brad Pitt looks so bad in it. Or maybe it's because the most common adjective used by critics when describing it was: ""slow-paced"". It doesn't rally matter. What does matter is how great this film is: with it's gorgeous cinematography, clean structure, and great performances. Jesse James is pure cinematic poetry, and to use a great line from the movie itself: ""poetry doesn't work on whores"". While critics were virtually ejaculating over an imperfect mess like There Will Be Blood, or a clever but off-putting experiment like No Country For Old Men; they completely missed a masterpiece.And here is another annoying aspect of film criticism. It's easy to write about bad or flawed films, but much harder to write about good ones. And if you sense a film is actually great before the mass culture catches up, you risk damning it with too much praise. So let me just say this much: Jesse James is the kind of film you have to allow to work its magic. You have to overcome its long running time and luxurious pacing. But if you do, you'll find some amazing rewards. This is less a Western and more a rumination on the nature of celebrity, a meditation on themes of adulation, loyalty, and betrayal. And, yes, it's a smart film, maybe even a deep one. But it's also an extremely entertaining one, full of great scenes, original characters and memorable dialogue.There's also some more obvious treasures here, like Roger Deakins' idiosyncratic cinematography and great-yet-stylized performances by the entire cast - Brad Pitt, Sam Rockwell, Garrett Dillahunt, Mary-Louise Parker - all doing outstanding work. Casey Affleck is nothing short of brilliant; alternately sweet, weasel-like, admirable and pathetic: able somehow to be both subtle and emotive at the same time. This is a star-making performance that was actually recognized and will undoubtedly put Affleck at the top of the ""young hotshot actor"" heap. But it's Andrew Dominik who deserves most of the credit here. This is a beautifully realized picture that hits every target it aims at. Simultaneously lyrical, funny, tense, scary, and eventually tragic; Jesse James succeeds on so many levels, I believe it'll be regarded as a great film long after anyone remembers what ""I'll drink your milkshake"" means.",5,The Assasination Of Jesse James - Best film of 2007,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3248,"['First', 'off', 'commercial', 'standpoint', 'title', 'Even', 'acronym', 'awkward', 'Artistically', 'unwieldy', 'moniker', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'film', 'long', 'ironic', 'full', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'Aussie', 'freshman', 'amazing', 'directorial', 'debut', 'tale', 'final', 'months', 'life', 'world-famous', 'Missouri', 'outlaw', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'hands', 'ambitious', 'lovable', 'killer', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Slow', 'yet', 'never', 'dull', 'long', 'tense', 'Jesse', 'James', 'completely', 'fell', 'cracks', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'late', 'Fall', ""'07"", 'Nobody', 'know', 'bothered', 'see', 'What', 'shame', 'picture', 'so', 'superior', 'year', 'top', 'contenders', 'barely', 'same', 'category', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'speculate', 'why', 'Jesse', 'James', 'so', 'utterly', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'even', 'film', 'geeks', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'Western', 'always', 'tough', 'sell', 'fact', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'so', 'bad', 'most', 'common', 'adjective', 'used', 'critics', 'when', 'describing', 'was', 'slow-paced', ""n't"", 'rally', 'matter', 'What', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'clean', 'structure', 'great', 'performances', 'Jesse', 'James', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'poetry', 'use', 'great', 'line', 'movie', 'poetry', ""n't"", 'work', 'whores', 'critics', 'were', 'virtually', 'ejaculating', 'imperfect', 'mess', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'clever', 'off-putting', 'experiment', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'completely', 'missed', 'masterpiece.And', 'here', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'film', 'criticism', 'easy', 'write', 'bad', 'flawed', 'films', 'much', 'harder', 'write', 'about', 'good', 'ones', 'sense', 'film', 'actually', 'great', 'mass', 'culture', 'up', 'risk', 'damning', 'too', 'much', 'praise', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'much', 'Jesse', 'James', 'kind', 'film', 'have', 'allow', 'work', 'magic', 'have', 'overcome', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'luxurious', 'pacing', 'do', ""'ll"", 'find', 'amazing', 'rewards', 'less', 'Western', 'more', 'rumination', 'nature', 'celebrity', 'meditation', 'themes', 'adulation', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'yes', 'smart', 'film', 'maybe', 'even', 'deep', 'one', 'also', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'one', 'full', 'great', 'scenes', 'original', 'characters', 'memorable', 'dialogue.There', 'also', 'more', 'obvious', 'treasures', 'here', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'idiosyncratic', 'cinematography', 'great-yet-stylized', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'doing', 'outstanding', 'work', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'alternately', 'sweet', 'weasel-like', 'admirable', 'pathetic', 'able', 'somehow', 'be', 'subtle', 'emotive', 'same', 'time', 'star-making', 'performance', 'was', 'actually', 'recognized', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'put', 'Affleck', 'top', 'young', 'hotshot', 'actor', 'heap', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'who', 'most', 'credit', 'here', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'picture', 'target', 'Simultaneously', 'lyrical', 'funny', 'tense', 'scary', 'eventually', 'tragic', 'Jesse', 'James', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'regarded', 'great', 'film', 'long', 'anyone', 'what', ""'ll"", 'drink', 'milkshake', 'means']",N/A

1125141,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B0010DR4BO,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[0, 0]","Anybody who thought that `3:10 to Yuma` is this year`s answer to `Unforgiven,` should reconsider.  Leave it to the lads down under to retell one of America`s most revered stories, the demise of Jesse James at the hands of one of his own men. New Zealander Andrew Dominik has created a profoundly moving masterpiece in `The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.`  Far surpassing any Western made over the last ten years, this film holds its own as a brilliant psychological drama as well.The year is 1881 and the glory days of Frank and Jesse James are on the wane.  Blue Cut, Missouri is where the brothers and their newly conscripted gang of derelicts and ex-Confederates conspire one last time to hold up the local mail and money train.  Frank (Sam Shephard) looks old and burdened with serious misgivings, while his gregarious and ever-unpredictable younger brother, Jesse (Brad Pitt), appears confident that this will be yet another Northfield, Minnesota, only smoother, cleaner.As they board and rough-up the terrified passengers, the gang, ghost-like with their primitive pillow-case hoods, file towards their prize, the mail car and its safe. But this time, the mail guards are ready.  Jesse and Frank burst in and threaten the guards as to the whereabouts of the money.  The guards remain mute and uncooperative.  The grinning and charming Jesse of a few hours earlier has suddenly become somebody quite different.  Jesse savagely pistols whips the guard into a unconscious mass of blood.  About to finish him off, one of the pillow-sack headed ghosts cries out for him to stop. `Ed, don`t tell me what I can`t do! replies a disgusted Jesse with an ominous glance towards the merciful one.And through it all, one Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), younger brother to one of Jesse`s veterans, basks in his hero`s cool and icy demeanor, all the while hungering for his acceptance, approval, and possibly, love.  The baby of his family, the one passed over, laughed at and taken for a failure, Bob longs to be somebody.  A somebody like his childhood Robin Hood, the infamous Jesse James.  And here is where Dominik shows his brilliance.  For the next 130 minutes, we follow the convoluted trail of hero-worship, of denied self-affirmation to its twisted, yet logical conclusion.  Few films of recent have so captured the way of the Judas personality with such precision and power.  The nobody who attaches himself/herself to a fuller, more defined, more realized persona in hopes of gleaning some of its magical power.  All to fail magnificently, tragically, and ever so pathetically.The power of the this film comes from the brilliance of the performances within.  Brad Pitt`s Jesse is without question one of his finest performances.  Those who felt cheated at his recent background roles (Babel) will be swept away by his consummate ability to become his character.  With the same eerie cracker drawl of his fellow Missourian and a terrifying and malevolent complexity, Pitt has created the ultimate Jesse James.  So impossible to pin down, categorize with the easy labels of good and evil, Pitt`s Jesse becomes the closest thing that history claims him to be, an enigma.  In heart warming scenes with his devoted and unquestioning wife (Mary Louise Parker) and his two children, Jesse shows a side of rare humanity, chasing the kids around their Kansas City house and even taking them to church.  A man in search of some desperate sense of normalcy, who yet can`t hide from his umpteen murders and hundreds of robberies.  A cold-blooded and paranoid killer who decimates his gang on the slightest pretense of betrayal.  Pitt is pitch perfect as Jesse.But the real star in this sky of magnificent performances is Casey Affleck.  His aw shucks portrayal of insignificance in search of glory is nothing short of masterful.  With his ruffled hair and goofy smile, Casey`s Bob is the ultimate man-child who never quite makes it to adulthood.  As Jesse becomes more strident in his hunt for betrayers, Bob Ford`s hero-worship starts to weaken.  With the roughing up of a younger cousin by Jesse, Bob begins to sees another side to his Robin Hood.  But Dominik never gives us the straight answer as to when, how, and why Bob ultimately turns on his messiah.  Was it the masked contempt Jesse often showed towards Bob, the chance to gain a glory greater than his master`s or was it some sort of twisted love?  Dominik keeps you guessing until the final, climatic moment.  A moment that will rip your heart out in its dramatic intensity.  The stunning cinematography and heart-wrenching soundtrack all converge on that final showdown to make a scene that will remain eternal in the grand library of movie climaxes.  So poignant is that final scene between Bob and his Christ, that I found myself in tears, tears shed for the doting family man and murdering mystery known as Jesse James.This film deserves all the accolades thrown at it and more.  Everything in this movie works at a near-perfect level.  The soundtrack is every bit  as good as the warm and fuzzy colors of Reakin`s amazing camera work.  The mesmerizing landscape and skyscape shots bring to mind the brilliant camera work of Vilmos Zsigmond.  In addition, the use of the narrator, often a great mistake in many a film, works wondrously here to help create the myth-like backdrop of the film. And finally, every actor/actress in the film brings the necesssary ingredients, and in the right proportions, to make this the delectable feast it is.  Mary Louise Parker`s Zee (Jesse`s ever-loyal wife) hardly says more than two lines the whole film.  Yet, her carriage, glances, and even silences convey the complete picture of a woman who stood by her man in the truest sense.  James Carville and Nick Cave also make for pleasant surprise appearances in the film.  Brief as their interludes are---Carville as the Missouri governor out to get revenge on Jesse and Cave as a bar-room banjo player---they both show amazing acting talent.  Again, perfect for their parts.Andrew Dominik has not only made a gripping psychological thriller and one of the best Westerns of recent years, but he has created a grand piece of art with a most timely message.  With our celebrity-obsessed culture dominating the papers and TV channels,  we see the gap ever-widening between those `stars` of mythical proportion and the everyday `nobodies` like the cowardly

1125143,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0010DR4BO,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a perplexing film in scope, subject, and style.The first thing that hits most people is the title. I mean, how long does a film's title have to be? Although I understand WHY they settled on it, I still feel that alternatives must've been out there.The next is the length of the movie itself. At over 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a behemoth in terms of size. I understand, too, that the original uncut version was a bit over 4 hours. Four hours! Thank goodness they cut it down. But I feel more cuts were needed and a better direction taken with the movie as a whole.The biggest issue I have is that the entire production seemed to have difficulties deciding on who the main character was. Was it Robert Ford (Casey Affleck,Gone Baby Gone)? Or was it Jesse James (Brad Pitt,Babel)? You can, on occasion, have multiple main characters, but with this film the muddling of who was doing what to who and why got seriously confusing. I attributed this to the fact that half the time we were focused on Jesse and the other half on Robert. The problems this caused was a lack of consistent story flow and a lengthy film that could've easily held more interest if it would've focused on either one character or the other. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the film start near Jesse James' assassination and then lead us off on the life of Robert Ford afterward. But that portion of Ford's life is quickly skimmed over and we never get the true feeling for what he went through after being labeled ""the coward who shot Jesse James in the back.""I also have to comment on the repetitive use of time-lapse photography during scenes meant to show the passage of time. The constant showing of clouds skidding rapidly across the sky got a bit tiring; time after time after time after time.Regardless of title and movie length, and the lack of a consistent character, the acting was pretty much perfect. Brad Pitt played the confused, dangerous, paranoid, and nearly psychotic Jesse James exceptionally well. And Casey Affleck as the disenchanted Jesse James fan-boy came across as creepy and not-just-a-bit pathetic.Although this film received plenty of praise (including two Oscar nominations), I found it to be slow and the first hour confusing with regards to understanding which character was doing what and why.But the acting saved it for me. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this flick for those who are ready to head off to bed (as this might put them to sleep before bedtime), I would suggest it as a good character study of the times surrounding the life of Jesse James and the poor sap who shot him.",3,"Too Long And Too Muddled, But Great Characters",1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,2672,"['ASSASSINATION', 'OF', 'JESSE', 'JAMES', 'BY', 'THE', 'COWARD', 'ROBERT', 'FORD', 'perplexing', 'film', 'scope', 'subject', 'style.The', 'first', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'title', 'mean', 'how', 'long', 'film', 'title', 'have', 'be', 'understand', 'WHY', 'settled', 'still', 'feel', 'alternatives', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there.The', 'next', 'length', 'movie', '2', 'hours', '40', 'minutes', 'behemoth', 'terms', 'size', 'understand', 'too', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'was', 'bit', '4', 'hours', 'Four', 'hours', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'cut', 'down', 'feel', 'more', 'cuts', 'were', 'needed', 'better', 'direction', 'taken', 'movie', 'whole.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'entire', 'production', 'seemed', 'have', 'difficulties', 'deciding', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'was', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Babel', 'can', 'occasion', 'have', 'multiple', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'muddling', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'who', 'why', 'got', 'seriously', 'confusing', 'attributed', 'fact', 'time', 'were', 'focused', 'Jesse', 'other', 'half', 'Robert', 'problems', 'caused', 'was', 'lack', 'consistent', 'story', 'flow', 'lengthy', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'held', 'more', 'interest', 'would', ""'ve"", 'focused', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'Personally', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'start', 'Jesse', 'James', 'assassination', 'then', 'lead', 'off', 'life', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'afterward', 'portion', 'Ford', 'life', 'quickly', 'skimmed', 'never', 'get', 'true', 'feeling', 'what', 'went', 'being', 'labeled', 'coward', 'who', 'shot', 'Jesse', 'James', 'back', 'also', 'have', 'comment', 'repetitive', 'use', 'time-lapse', 'photography', 'scenes', 'meant', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'constant', 'showing', 'clouds', 'skidding', 'rapidly', 'sky', 'got', 'bit', 'tiring', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'time.Regardless', 'title', 'movie', 'length', 'lack', 'consistent', 'character', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'played', 'confused', 'dangerous', 'paranoid', 'nearly', 'psychotic', 'Jesse', 'James', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'disenchanted', 'Jesse', 'James', 'fan-boy', 'came', 'creepy', 'not-just-a-bit', 'pathetic.Although', 'film', 'received', 'plenty', 'praise', 'including', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'found', 'be', 'slow', 'first', 'hour', 'confusing', 'regards', 'understanding', 'character', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'why.But', 'acting', 'saved', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'flick', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'head', 'off', 'bed', 'might', 'put', 'sleep', 'bedtime', 'would', 'suggest', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'times', 'surrounding', 'life', 'Jesse', 'James', 'poor', 'sap', 'who', 'shot']",N/A

Lets not just examine Robert Ford here, but Jesse James as well.  This movie shows us a man who has murdered 17 people and committed numerous robberies.  This is still a man who is loved and respected...but also feared.  Jesse's paranoia and anxiety can resemble Bipolar II.  His hypomania is evident as sometimes he is incapable of sitting still and holding meaningful conversations.  He also seems to enter serious bouts of severe depression.  Its almost as if he realized that he has peaked, and the only thing left is for a younger lion to kill him and take over the pride.Bob Ford is another story.  Casey Affleck is brilliant here and he displays disorganized speech, thought process, and mannerisms.  What someone would call ""strange"" or ""odd"".  What initially begins as praise and admiration qickly turn sour as he feels disenchanted and fearful.  After killing Jesse James, he is initially elated, but this soon turns into depression and moodiness.  At the conclusion of the film, when he accepts his own fate, he does so without surprise...but rather relief.This is a well done portrayal of human emotion.  The acting is top notch.  Many will approach this film expecting action, but instead find a movie which is a discussion into the psychological processes experienced by two of the most infamous characters in American history.  The cinematography is some of the best out there.  The movie is beautifully shot and the director uses blurry lenses to bring an increased focus to the characters and thier turmoil.  Affleck's performance is bolstered by brilliant showings by Brad Pitt, Sam Rockwell, and Mary Louise Parker (Only a handful of lines, but she steals the show).

This is not Silverado or 3:10 to Yuma, it is a completely different type of movie. This is a movie that you will not appreciate if you are watching it in your living room with a group of rowdy friends, or the kids running around and the phone ringing and the wife wanting you to take out the garbage. You really have to sit and watch this movie and let it draw you in....it will. And remember, the 2nd half of the movie is better than the 1st half, so hang in there.I strongly disagree with anyone panning this movie or Brad Pitt's performance. I am not sure where they are coming from. Brad Pitt was very good and Casey Affleck was great, not that he was better than Brad Pitt but his character was more versatile in the movie. I have never been any huge fan of Brad Pitt, but his more recent movies and performances have been much better than his early career. (I am not including Ocean's 11 and the sequels because these were obviously not meant to be serious movies.)If you need alot of Jean Claude Van Damme in your westerns, pass this one up. I am sure that many of the ""boring"" reviews are from people who want alot of ""shoot'em up"" action.This is a very unique and satisfying film and I highly recommend it. Obviously they have romanticized and dramatized and made a few leaps in this movie, but you could also say that about 99.9% of the all the movies ever made.",4,Fine western.  4 & 1/2 stars,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2274,"['have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'music', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'use', 'music', 'even', 'better', 'fact', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'lesser', 'movie', 'have', 'already', 'downloaded', 'soundtrack', '..outstanding', 'would', 'add', 'narration', 'also', 'outstanding', 'require', 'duels', 'shootouts', 'blazin', 'horses', 'kicking', 'up', 'dust..skip', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'hard', 'describe', 'film', 'part', 'western', 'little', 'documentary', 'melancholy', 'little', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'stirring', 'slow', 'times', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'tension', 'again', 'great', 'music', 'movie', 'slow', 'parts', 'always', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'movie', 'better', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'typical', 'western', 'not', 'Silverado', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'appreciate', 'are', 'watching', 'living', 'room', 'group', 'rowdy', 'friends', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'phone', 'ringing', 'wife', 'wanting', 'take', 'out', 'garbage', 'really', 'have', 'sit', 'watch', 'movie', 'let', 'draw', '.it', 'will', 'remember', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'better', '1st', 'half', 'so', 'hang', 'there.I', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'anyone', 'panning', 'movie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'great', 'not', 'was', 'better', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'versatile', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'early', 'career', 'am', 'not', 'including', 'Ocean', '11', 'sequels', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'movies', 'need', 'alot', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'westerns', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'boring', 'reviews', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'alot', ""shoot'em"", 'up', 'action.This', 'very', 'unique', 'satisfying', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Obviously', 'have', 'romanticized', 'dramatized', 'made', 'few', 'leaps', 'movie', 'could', 'also', 'say', 'about', '99.9', '%', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
1125150,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0010DR4BO,Caleb Williams,"[3, 4]","I've been thinking of a good way to start my review, I've been pondering many opening sentences, but none of them are close enough to the point, so I've decided to just say that this film is perfect in all aspects. When the credits started to roll I didn't move at all, I sat staring at the screen just thinking about what I just watched. I was trying to understand if what I just saw was really that good, or if I was just thinking it was. The film runs at almost three hours, but never looses your attention for one second. It moves forward through dialog that is poetic, but increasingly haunting at times.First off, the performances. Brad Pitt as Jesse Jame makes you feel that he is a vulnerable person, and then at the next second he'll make you completely change all your feelings for him. He doesn't talk much in the film, but is none the less flawless. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is in his best performance ever, makes you hate him. His character is very shaky, very nervous at times, but always seems confident of what he's doing, whether it's right of wrong. He steals most of the scenes he's in. The biggest surprise however for me was Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Robert's brother and Jesse's right hand man. At the beginning of the film, you think that Charley is the stupid brother and that Robert is intelligent beyond any standard Charley could reach. At the end of the film though, the roles switch. You realize that Robert has been making all the dumb decisions, and Charley has been trying to save him by covering them up and usually taking all the crap for it. His last scene was intense and beautiful. One other performance to talk about is Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, an outlaw womanizer. His performance is somewhat comedic, but in some scenes he can be the backbone for the drama. I can easily see Pitt getting a Best Actor nomination while Affleck pulls in the Supporting Actor for the win.The musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is on par with Clint Mansell's classic Requiem for a Dream score, if not better. In the films most horrific scenes, the music turns them into something beautiful. You'll want to sit through the end credits just to hear it one more time. The music will draw you back to the film to see it again. The score also fits the tone for the most of the scenes.Andrew Dominik's direction is perfect. He uses the camera in such a unique way that you never miss anything that happens. In one of the film's best scenes, he places the camera so that you can only see Pitt's silhouette become meshed into a train's smoke and then reappear seconds later as it pops out. Dominik also wrote the entire script by himself, which really shows how versatile he is. He originally wrote the film into a 3hr and 50min cut that the studio made him trash. I can't wait to see that cut.The best thing in the film though, is Roger Deakins' cinematography. That is what you gives the feel for the film. The blurry landscapes, the wheat fields that Pitt gracefully moves through, and the greatest train robbery scene ever on film. It perfectly portrays the landscapes of the old 1800's and everything that took place there. The film is consistent with providing one memorable scene after the other. When the assassination finally happens, you'll be sitting in your chair gawking at the screen in amazement of how sudden it happens.I am very proud to say that this is now my favorite film of all time, and my definite choice for Best Picture of the year. It brings new flavor to the art-house scene and never lets you down. I recommend this film to everyone. It truly is a beautiful film.I give it a 5 out of 5",5,The Most Beautiful Film Ever Made,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,3648,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'good', 'way', 'start', 'review', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pondering', 'many', 'opening', 'sentences', 'none', 'are', 'close', 'enough', 'point', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', 'aspects', 'When', 'credits', 'started', 'roll', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'sat', 'staring', 'screen', 'just', 'thinking', 'what', 'just', 'watched', 'was', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'was', 'really', 'that', 'good', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', 'was', 'film', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'never', 'attention', 'one', 'second', 'forward', 'dialog', 'poetic', 'increasingly', 'haunting', 'times.First', 'off', 'performances', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jesse', 'Jame', 'feel', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'then', 'next', 'second', ""'ll"", 'make', 'completely', 'change', 'feelings', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'film', 'none', 'less', 'flawless', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'hate', 'character', 'very', 'shaky', 'very', 'nervous', 'times', 'always', 'confident', 'what', 'doing', 'right', 'wrong', 'most', 'scenes', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'however', 'was', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Charley', 'Ford', 'Robert', 'brother', 'Jesse', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'beginning', 'film', 'think', 'Charley', 'stupid', 'brother', 'Robert', 'intelligent', 'standard', 'Charley', 'could', 'reach', 'end', 'film', 'roles', 'switch', 'realize', 'Robert', 'been', 'making', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'Charley', 'been', 'trying', 'save', 'covering', 'up', 'usually', 'taking', 'crap', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'intense', 'beautiful', 'One', 'other', 'performance', 'talk', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Dick', 'Liddil', 'outlaw', 'womanizer', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'backbone', 'drama', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'Pitt', 'getting', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'Affleck', 'pulls', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'win.The', 'musical', 'score', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'par', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'classic', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'score', 'not', 'better', 'films', 'most', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'music', 'something', 'beautiful', ""'ll"", 'want', 'sit', 'end', 'just', 'hear', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'music', 'will', 'draw', 'back', 'film', 'see', 'again', 'score', 'also', 'tone', 'most', 'scenes.Andrew', 'Dominik', 'direction', 'perfect', 'camera', 'such', 'unique', 'way', 'never', 'miss', 'anything', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'camera', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'Pitt', 'silhouette', 'become', 'meshed', 'train', 'smoke', 'then', 'reappear', 'seconds', 'later', 'out', 'Dominik', 'also', 'wrote', 'entire', 'script', 'really', 'how', 'versatile', 'originally', 'wrote', 'film', '3hr', '50min', 'cut', 'studio', 'made', 'trash', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'cut.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'cinematography', 'what', 'feel', 'film', 'blurry', 'wheat', 'fields', 'Pitt', 'gracefully', 'greatest', 'train', 'robbery', 'scene', 'ever', 'film', 'perfectly', 'landscapes', 'old', '1800', 'everything', 'took', 'place', 'there', 'film', 'consistent', 'providing', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'other', 'When', 'assassination', 'finally', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sitting', 'chair', 'gawking', 'screen', 'amazement', 'how', 'sudden', 'am', 'very', 'proud', 'say', 'now', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'definite', 'choice', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'new', 'flavor', 'art-house', 'scene', 'never', 'down', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'film.I', 'give', '5', '5']",N/A
1125151,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B0010DR4BO,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[3, 7]","While not entirely perfect this film does creep close. Since this country does not have the luxury of having been around for thousands of years we have but only our short history with which to work our myths and legends. Jesse James may have been many things in his actual life but this film deals with the legendary myth  and the reality meeting head on.Here in this film is the reality, the legend, the myth, the anti-hero, the hero, and them each mirrored back on one another as well as the general populace of the American landscape mesh together to form a semi-cohesive whole. The film is complex and deals with the many points of view this story surly has. In the end though, the film does live up to it's namesake and take sides proclaiming Robert Ford as the coward he was and is in our minds. Darth Vader himself would not have killed Obi-Wan from behind and under the guise of friendship. It's almost as if jesse James knew what was coming and just allowed it to happen then, rather than live on his life in the constant state of paranoia he surly must have been in. Kind of like when Obi-Wan lowers his light saber and allows himself to be killed, hence forth becoming even more powerful. It's a simple analogy but it works here well.Regardless of the facts, the film squarely props up the myth the people felt and uses it as fodder for the semi-motivation behind Robert Ford's twisted admiration/assassination of Jesse James. Killing what one admires so as to play a small and pitiful part in the life's story of Jesse James reminds me of all the numskull school killers in the news today who kill for fame and glory, but who are also, ultimately, cowards in their own right as well. Jesse James was a killer for sure. Still, although lost now to us modern Americans, he did seem to have hit some sort of Robin Hood type nerve back in his day. The film ends on this note and the facts revealed show just how different a country this was back then. The last time I can recall such a similar situation was when Jack Ruby shot and Killed Oswald for Killing Kennedy. I am not comparing jesse James to JFK, but rather just the situation where a American is so stirred by events and  a perceived wrongdoing that they take it upon ones self to right that wrong.The film lags a bit here and there and this needs to be mentioned. A better editor could have cut a good 20, perhaps 40 minutes, out of this film and still presented the same overall essence. In a great film the passage of time should evaporate. Even the urge to relieve ones self should come as an annoyance while a wholly engaging film is playing. Like I said this film comes close.

Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[2, 2]","Just rented the DVD and watched this for the first time last night- missed seeing it in the theatres (which was released in Tulsa, OK, strangely only for a brief time, and then only at an ""arts"" film theatre).I'm sure seeing it on a small screen detracts from the cinematography, which looks beautiful even on a TV screen.Many other reviews on this site already aptly summarize the well-known story, and I agree the acting all around is first rate.But at 140 minutes in length, I suspect that it will appeal mostly to students of the James gang history, and film-as-art officionados particularly- but perhaps not to most Western movie fans. The action in the movie is done well enough, perhaps even more realistically than most ""shoot-em up"" Westerns, but unfortunately these brief, violent moments are separated by long stretches of character-development. Don't get me wrong, I liked this film very much, but I'd have to say that you have to be in the mood, so to speak, to really appreciate this film. I'd liken it very much to Terrence Mallick's ""The Thin Red Line"", about the Guadalcanal struggle of 1942. History, yes, but only loosely so- more of an allegory, and a visual feast, than edge-of-your-seat action.I suspect the intentional slow pace of this film will lose a considerable number of viewers, but for those who have 3 hours to spare, and are in a pensive mood, this is Western movie-making worth vieiwing.

THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD was the real movie that deserved that praise. For once, Hollywood actually did their homework and didn't decide before release that the movie needed something extra for the popcorn viewing audience.

Without a word, he portrays the emotional tormoil errupting inside Ford's head. With just the slightest of quirks, or the shift of his face, Affleck delivers the obsession that drives Robert Ford to BE Jesse James, and then to be driven to fire the fatal shot that left the hole in Jesse James' living room wall.This movie is not to be missed by any true Western fan or any fan of movies or great acting for that matter.

1125158,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010DR4BO,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","Nowadays, it's kind of hard to pinpoint why a film succeeded despite a general consensus that the movie was awful while a film that gets unanimous praise barely found an audience. Whether studio indifference, little hype and promotion or a ""wait till DVD"" attitude, some great films disappear from theaters and people only start praising the film after viewing it at home. With a rather unwieldy title, an unfriendly length and lack of mass appeal, ""Jesse James"" didn't get much attention though the ones that did see it praised it, although some had criticisms. While I will admit there is some flaws, it's also very much worth the watch.Like Apollo 13, the narrative works despite the audience's knowledge of the outcome. Jesse James, a late 19th century robber/murderer has invited a couple of people into his gang, including brothers Robert and Charley. Robert, a huge fan of James since childhood, very much wants to be around Jesse and learn from him or at the very least be like him. But with Jesse quieting down and seemingly murdering his old robber gang members, Robert and Charley try to be in Jesse's gang long enough to stay alive and deal with his strange behaviors, which might have to be dealt with strongly.Most westerns fall into 2 categories: the more quieter films like Unforgiven and this deal with the Wild West more like quiet trips through the countryside, reflecting on their past and actions. Then there's the shoot-em-ups a la Tombstone and 3:10 to Yuma which deal with gun battles, horse chases and excitement. Jesse James is the former since it primarily deals with character and soul-searching then it does bank robberies. Because of this, the film might not appeal to everyone since I will admit, the film doesn't really have a length issue so much as a pace issue. Some scenes could've been trimmed or gotten rid of altogether and film would've still had the same feel but then again films like Lawrence of Arabia and Gone With the Wind also had long lengths with dragging paces so maybe it's just changing preferences. The other nag is the narrator who is unnecessary in various scenes but the biggest offender is the voice which just doesn't give the film the right tone.One of the things that bugged me about Terrance Malick's films such as The New World was he seemed to be too in love with his camera, focusing on ""purty shots"" and not having the heart to cut them since they were so beautiful that they all had to stay in. While this film does have such images, they're used sparingly and don't detract and go into ""showoff mode"". For example, the wait during the opening train robbery is lit almost entirely with lanterns and the bright light of the train itself. They're stunning shots (especially Brad Pitt directly in front of the train in silhouette) but we go right into the robbery soon after. It's too bad it didn't win for cinematography since it's a great movie to look at.The performances are excellent as well such as Pitt and Casey Affleck. While Pitt was always more interesting in more eccentric roles (Fight Club, 12 Monkeys) then the serious ones (Legends of the Fall and possibly Babel comes to mind) but here it allows him to be unpredictable and almost crazy while also giving some pathos and quieter moments. But the big star is Affleck who wants to carve out his own identity and be part of bigger things but also knows heroes aren't always as they should be. We also get ""Weeds"" star Mary-Louise Parker who doesn't do much but is notable though Zooey Deschanel seems vastly underutilized...though let's face it, anything with Zooey's good enough.What is criminal is the special features or rather the lack of them since we get nothing on here; no commentary from director, stars or very least cinematographer, no featurettes into the real-life story or the making of the film. Either the studio didn't bother or we'll get a more impressive (read: a bare minimum of featurettes and no commentary) but the film is one of last year's best.",4,"4.5; reflective, hypnotic and quite underrated",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3997,"['Nowadays', 'kind', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'film', 'succeeded', 'general', 'consensus', 'movie', 'was', 'awful', 'film', 'unanimous', 'praise', 'barely', 'found', 'audience', 'studio', 'indifference', 'little', 'hype', 'promotion', 'wait', 'till', 'DVD', 'attitude', 'great', 'films', 'disappear', 'theaters', 'people', 'only', 'start', 'praising', 'film', 'viewing', 'home', 'rather', 'unwieldy', 'title', 'unfriendly', 'length', 'lack', 'mass', 'appeal', 'Jesse', 'James', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'ones', 'did', 'see', 'praised', 'had', 'criticisms', 'will', 'admit', 'flaws', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'watch.Like', 'Apollo', '13', 'narrative', 'works', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'outcome', 'Jesse', 'James', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'robber/murderer', 'invited', 'couple', 'people', 'gang', 'including', 'brothers', 'Robert', 'Charley', 'Robert', 'huge', 'fan', 'James', 'childhood', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'Jesse', 'learn', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'Jesse', 'quieting', 'down', 'seemingly', 'murdering', 'old', 'robber', 'gang', 'members', 'Robert', 'Charley', 'try', 'be', 'Jesse', 'gang', 'long', 'enough', 'stay', 'alive', 'deal', 'strange', 'behaviors', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'dealt', 'strongly.Most', 'westerns', 'fall', '2', 'categories', 'more', 'quieter', 'films', 'Unforgiven', 'deal', 'Wild', 'West', 'more', 'quiet', 'trips', 'countryside', 'reflecting', 'past', 'actions', 'Then', 'shoot-em-ups', 'la', 'Tombstone', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'deal', 'gun', 'battles', 'horse', 'chases', 'excitement', 'Jesse', 'James', 'former', 'primarily', 'character', 'soul-searching', 'then', 'bank', 'robberies', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'will', 'admit', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'length', 'issue', 'so', 'much', 'pace', 'issue', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trimmed', 'gotten', 'rid', 'altogether', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'still', 'had', 'same', 'feel', 'then', 'again', 'films', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'also', 'had', 'long', 'lengths', 'dragging', 'paces', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'changing', 'preferences', 'other', 'nag', 'narrator', 'who', 'unnecessary', 'various', 'scenes', 'biggest', 'offender', 'voice', 'just', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'right', 'tone.One', 'things', 'bugged', 'Terrance', 'Malick', 'films', 'such', 'New', 'World', 'was', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'love', 'camera', 'focusing', 'purty', 'shots', 'not', 'having', 'heart', 'cut', 'were', 'so', 'beautiful', 'had', 'stay', 'film', 'have', 'such', 'images', ""'re"", 'used', 'sparingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'go', 'showoff', 'mode', 'example', 'wait', 'opening', 'train', 'robbery', 'lit', 'almost', 'entirely', 'lanterns', 'bright', 'light', 'train', ""'re"", 'stunning', 'shots', 'especially', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'directly', 'front', 'train', 'silhouette', 'go', 'right', 'robbery', 'soon', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'cinematography', 'great', 'movie', 'look', 'at.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Pitt', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'eccentric', 'roles', 'Fight', 'Club', '12', 'Monkeys', 'then', 'serious', 'ones', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'possibly', 'Babel', 'mind', 'here', 'be', 'unpredictable', 'almost', 'crazy', 'also', 'giving', 'pathos', 'quieter', 'moments', 'big', 'star', 'Affleck', 'who', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'identity', 'be', 'part', 'bigger', 'things', 'also', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'should', 'be', 'also', 'get', 'Weeds', 'star', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'notable', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'vastly', 'underutilized', 'let', 'face', 'anything', 'Zooey', 'good', 'enough.What', 'criminal', 'special', 'features', 'rather', 'lack', 'get', 'nothing', 'here', 'commentary', 'director', 'very', 'least', 'cinematographer', 'featurettes', 'real-life', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'impressive', 'read', 'bare', 'minimum', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'film', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'best']",N/A

Wow, this is beautiful! It's so stunning to look at in so many spots that there were many times I was more involved in the visuals than the story. In that sense, it reminded me of the marvelously-photographed films of Terrence Malick. Kudos to Andrew Dominik for a similar style directorial performance here.Regarding the story, here's a warning to those who are expecting the normal western fare and want to see the usual amount of gun battles and related action scenes. This film is 2 hour and 40 minutes and there are not many ""action"" scenes. If you are hoping to see another ""3:10 To Yuma"" re-make, you will be very disappointed. This story is slow. It's a character study of Jesse James and the man who killed him, Robert Ford.That said, I still found it a memorable film. The photography, the great acting and the uniqueness of the story were all good enough to keep me interested throughout. For once, I was glad to see James portrayed more realistically. Despite what you've seen on film in the past, this man was not a hero, folks. Sure he was a likable guy at times, and a nice father at times, too, but he was a thief and, much worse, a cold-blooded killer. You see that in this film.I have to say I can't remember a film I've seen in recent years in which the two lead characters (James and R. Ford) were so strange and unpredictable. For that, I have to really compliment the work of Pitt and Affleck. They were amazing and kept me guessing throughout the movie. They played very complex people.Overall, once I realized this wasn't a ""shoot-em-up"" western, and just sat back and appreciated the storytelling, wonderful visuals, low-key narration, fabulous sets, scenery and acting....I ended up being very impressed.",5,Stunning Photography & Great Acting,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,1939,"['unusual', 'movie', 'especially', 'modern-day-filmed', 'western.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'are', 'stars', 'movie', 'biggest', 'star', 'was', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'man', 'who', 'photographed', 'film', 'Wow', 'beautiful', 'so', 'stunning', 'look', 'so', 'many', 'spots', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'more', 'involved', 'visuals', 'story', 'sense', 'reminded', 'marvelously-photographed', 'films', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Kudos', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'similar', 'style', 'directorial', 'performance', 'here.Regarding', 'story', 'here', 'warning', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'normal', 'western', 'fare', 'want', 'see', 'usual', 'amount', 'gun', 'battles', 'related', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', '2', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'hoping', 'see', '3:10', 'Yuma', 're-make', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'story', 'slow', 'character', 'study', 'Jesse', 'James', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Robert', 'Ford.That', 'said', 'still', 'found', 'memorable', 'film', 'photography', 'great', 'acting', 'uniqueness', 'story', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'once', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'James', 'portrayed', 'more', 'realistically', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'past', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'hero', 'folks', 'Sure', 'was', 'likable', 'guy', 'times', 'nice', 'father', 'times', 'too', 'was', 'thief', 'much', 'worse', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'see', 'film.I', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'James', 'R.', 'Ford', 'were', 'so', 'strange', 'unpredictable', 'have', 'really', 'compliment', 'work', 'Pitt', 'Affleck', 'were', 'amazing', 'kept', 'guessing', 'movie', 'played', 'very', 'complex', 'people.Overall', 'once', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'shoot-em-up', 'western', 'just', 'sat', 'back', 'appreciated', 'storytelling', 'wonderful', 'visuals', 'low-key', 'narration', 'fabulous', 'sets', 'scenery', 'acting', '.I', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'impressed']",N/A

The youngest of five kids, Bob has been picked on all his life, which maybe explains is fascination--okay, idol worship--of Jesse James.  But the real Jesse is nothing like the one told about in cheap novels; the real Jesse is a cunning murderer, a robber with dark secrets and a tendency toward paranoia.  And it isn't long before Bob's unwavering admiration changes to something bordering on resentment...and resentment becomes hate...The story of Jesse James's assassination has been fodder for countless songs, poems, and movies (one of my favorites of the latter features Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson, but that's a story for another time).  ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is nothing like any of its predecessors.  It is a spine-tingling, mind-boggling good time, a slow-burning drama that builds towards its inevitable climax.  We all know what happens--look at the cover of the damn DVD--but we all ache when it happens.  We are all, on some level, surprised.  Such is the caliber of acting, especially from leads Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt.  Both actors manage to suck you into their characters, to lure you into their world.  It's hard to picture them doing anything else.  The cinemetography is brilliant; the directing and writing are of a caliber seldom seen in mainstream Hollywood.  Even the steady stream of surprising cameos--my favorites being Michael Parks, Zooey Deschanel, and the film's composer and folk/blues rocker Nick Cave--is delightful, if only for the novelty it brings (that, and Cave's fans get an impromptu, engaging performance of the classic ballad ""Jesse James,"" but I digress).My only beef with the movie is that the DVD contains no--repeat, no--bonus features.

Director/writer Andrew Dominik has skillfully crafted a wonderful masterpiece with his stunning, haunting movie, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD.  This is grand, absorbing cinema at its finest, complete with remarkable vistas, a moving musical score, terrific acting, and compelling story.  If not hypnotizing, this film is certainly mesmerizing.Based on Ron Hansen's exceptional novel, the film depicts the final months of the infamous--yet wildly popular--train robber, Jesse James.  The film follows the novel closely (only condensing the story in the end); accordingly, the movie runs exceptionally long.  I can see where this would be a problem with viewers unfamiliar with the book, but for those of us fortunate enough to have read (and appreciated) Hansen's grand tale, the film is a most suitable adaptation.  I'm not a Brad Pitt fan, but very much enjoyed the actor's portrayal of the moody, pensive, paranoid, often brutal outlaw.  With a $25,000 bounty on his head, James becomes increasingly unstable--often such instability proved fatal to members of his gang.  Pitt, of course, excels in depicting unstable characters; his portrayal is vividly believable.As immature, brooding, envious, often creepy Robert Ford, Casey Affleck is exceptional.  He very much carries the freight when he's the central emphasis of any scene.  Sam Shephard is effective as Frank James, the quiet, more common sense leader of the James Gang; and I was very pleasantly surprised to see political hack James Carville make a cameo as Missouri Governor Crittenden.  Carville's not bad. . .not bad at all.  Yet I was most impressed with Sam Rockwell, who plays Robert's older brother, Charley.  Torn between his loyalty to James and his growing fear that kid brother Bob's cooperation with law enforcement could ultimately prove fatal, Rockwell is spellbinding.  Following the death of James, Charley Ford's descent into madness and despair is swift, and Rockwell depicts it flawlessly.Again, this is a film skillfully crafted, augmented by Warren Ellis's and Nick Cave's haunting musical score, and Hugh Ross's masterful narration. Yet the MVP of this movie is director of cinematography Roger Deakins.  Wow, can this guy bring us beauty and artistry and period and drama--all through the lens of a camera.  Soft focus, time lapse, even recreation of a 19th Century daguerreotype--Deakins's craftmanship is superb.

1125175,A1M8LQWS4WKLM7,B0010DR4BO,"Don G. Schley ""doktor don""","[4, 6]","""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is one of only three period pieces about this brief window of American history. The other two are ""The Long Riders"" (1980) and ""Ride with the Devil"" (Ang Lee's under-released 1999 classic). All three films have in common a real effort to recapture on film this historical period, its manners, dress, ways of speaking, and the real substance of the events portrayed. In this sense, ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" departs from the standard, stale, and overplayed traditional Western elements, and attempts to recreate the bleak and dismal setting of post-Civil War Missouri, burned out by years of hard fighting between federal and Kansan militias on the one hand, and the Southern-affiliated Missouri riders on the other. Just as in Ang Lee's classic, and in ""The Long Riders"", the filmaker succeeds in this respect.More importantly, perhaps, the film focuses on one unexplored facet of this piece of American experience, the decline of the James' brothers once well-oiled machine of militarily trained partisans turned outlaws. The opening scene, which features Robert Ford seeking an audience with the James brothers, and getting a brutal response from the older Frank, presents the post-Northfield raid gang as a collection of rubes and hicks, without either the discipline or capabilities of their forerunners. The crass and vulgar dialogue of this opening scene sets the stage for the rest of the film. The hardened, professional, and almost courtly James brothers are contrasted to their low-class bumpkin recruits. Thankfully, Jesse and Frank disband this group after one last and nearly botched train robbery (the ""Blue Cut"" robbery), and Frank rides off to the East Coast.Jesse, meanwhile, lives in a paranoiac state, worrying about whether these former gang members will betray him, and occasionally killing a suspect himself. One by one, these churlish and low-class thugs wound and kill one another, leaving Jesse increasingly isolated. It is in this context that he finally and fatefully takes the Ford brothers--Bob and Charley--into his confidence.Much of the depiction here is absolutely historically accurate. The final scene of the assassination is scripted directly from Bob Ford's letter to Gov. Crittenden, in which he described the event, and Ford's end is taken directly from contemporary accounts as well. As one who has followed Western history for almost two decades, the realism of this film provides a startling departure from the typical Hollywood treatment of the Western. In this sense, ""the Assassination of Jesse James"" stands on its own as a period piece, and not strictly a Western (especially as most of it is shot in settings that no one would identify today as ""Western""--e.g., the Tetons, Monument Valley, and the like--but rather, the bleak and barren hills of the Western Missouri farm country, with its stark and isolated clapboard farmhouses.).The acting is superb, and Brad Pitt does an excellent job representing the mercurial Jesse James. Crticisms of Pitt in this role have been vastly overstated. My impression was that Pitt continues to grow beyond his pretty-boy persona as an actor. The only criticism of his acting in any way is that he did not seem to be able to really integrate his own persona with that of Jesse James--in other words, there was no overarching modern leitmotif to allow him to convey exactly who Jesse James was. After all, this is a period of American social history about which almost no one has any more real memory or awareness, so every portrayal has to be reconstructed speculatively, as it were. Still, Pitt gets as close to the enigmatic and contradictory character of Jesse James as any actor in recent memory has. Certainly, Pitt outstrips every classic Western portrayal of Jesse James. I was frankly impressed.For his part, Casey Affleck as Bob Ford had the easier task, as he actually was given a modern psychological interpretation on Ford's character as that of a boy consumed by hero-worship, emulation and fascination leading to frustration with his non-acceptance into Jesse's gang, leading ultimately to betrayal. I have no idea how accurately this interpretation represents the historical reality of who Bob Ford was. No one does. Still, Affleck's (and the film's) interpretation of Robert Ford is completely believable in terms of modern psychology and draws the viewer into both the sympathy and pathology of this young, would-be Missouri outlaw turned traitor. Affleck was justly nominated for an academy award for his performance.I recommend this film to anyone interested in quality historical depictions of classic Western themes. It treats its subject from the standpoint of strict periodicity, with intense attention to the details of that era. It rises above the traditional Western's typical reduction of historical personages such as Jesse James to type figures in a morality play. The shame is that this fine film, despite the attractiveness of Brad Pitt as the main star, was barely in the theaters, and was completely under-released, just as was the case with Ang Lee's ""Ride with the Devil"", which treats the earlier period of the same kinds of people that made up the James-Younger Gang. What a shame, for such a well-done and gripping treatment of a long-neglected topic!",5,A memorable treatment of a mis-treated Western Tale,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,5344,"['Assassination',

1125176,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0010DR4BO,Doug Anderson,"[15, 17]","If you are looking for a shoot 'em up cowboy film then keep looking, but if you are looking for a mesmerizing look at the post civil war American psyche then this is your masterpiece. Every shot is a masterpiece of composition; not since Days of Heaven has a cinematographer so expressively captured the forlorn beauty of the American landscape and the American psyche and the intimate bond between the two. Through the magnificent expressionist lens of cinematographer Roger Deakins, every slant of light and shade seem constructed/designed to evoke the immense mystery, and the immense emptiness at the heart of all physical things. The more sensitive the onlooker the more intimate will be the bond between landscape and psyche. This is the poetry, this is the mythos not just of the American western but of American literature. From Hawthorne to Poe to Melville to Emily Dickinson to Ambrose Bierce to William Faulkner to Robert Frost, the stories that take place within the American landscape are inevitably stories of biblical proportions, of men and women struggling to forge something out of the light and the shade.This is a film about American poetry and mythos. Specifically about the transitional poetry and mythos of America c. 1880, a time when the individual and the nation itself were still suffering the devastating psychic effects of the war; a time when both were desperately in need of a new poetry, a new mythos, a new way to behold the world.This film is about looking at the way we craft mythos. One way nations have done this is to craft heroes. But its not always the poets that have given us our heroes, sometimes our most effective mythos come from the most unexpected sources. In the 1880's the spinners of far-fetched dime store yarns crafted a hero out of Jesse James. Perhaps because their fictions were more accessible and their heroes more easily understood than were the fictions and the heroes of Melville or Twain, these home-spun yarns were immensely popular. These wildly inventive  tall tales captured & shaped young boys imaginations and provided them with someone to emulate because the Jesse James of the dime store novels always knew what to do in every situation, knew how to use his guns but only used them when he had to, and, most of all, he never doubted himself. Jesse James, the fiction, was a new kind of American hero: independent, adventurous, and egalitarian (he robbed from the rich and gave to the poor).Brad Pitt as outlaw Jesse James is none of these things. This Jesse James is a selfish tyrant who lords it over the other gang members who he treats as servants lucky to be in his company. He is a loner, isolated even from his own brother. He seems to have a deep connection with his wife and children, but perhaps only because they are the only people he knows that do not carry guns. As iconically handsome and ideally suited to play Jesse James as Brad Pitt is, though, the real star here is Casey Affleck who is absolutely fascinating as the forsaken dreamer Robert Ford, a young man who Jesse James reluctantly recruits and even more reluctantly befriends. Ford is also a loner and his understanding/connection with Jesse is predicated on the fact that they each seem utterly alienated from the rest of humanity and singularly suited to provide the other with a discomfitting kind of companionship. Never was a young man more conflicted about his hero than was Ford about James. From the moment that he meets him, Ford is both completely enamoured with and completely disillusioned with his boyhood hero. And Affleck makes Ford's internal conflict absolutely palpable every minute he is onscreen. In James company Ford is boyish and insecure and starstruck and yet capable of unexpected insight and shrewd critique. But, there is a driving motive behind everything that Ford does for he wants nothing more than to step out of the shade to which he feels condemned and into the light that James occupies; though things will not unfold in the way he imagined they would, his wish will eventually come true, but to accomplish this he must do something truly extraordinary himself, and, ironically, the only extraordinary thing he can think to do is to kill his hero Jesse James.This is ultimately a fascinating film about the constructive and destructive power and effects of the myths we tell and live by.  And about how weak a thing is truth next to the overwhelming appeal of a good narrative, especially one sanctioned by public opinion.",5,"Think  Bresson, Altman, Malick: Cinema with a Capital C",1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,4503,"['are', 'looking', 'shoot', 'up', 'cowboy', 'film', 'then', 'keep', 'looking', 'are', 'looking', 'mesmerizing', 'look', 'post', 'civil', 'war', 'American', 'psyche', 'then', 'masterpiece', 'shot', 'masterpiece', 'composition', 'not', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'cinematographer', 'so', 'expressively', 'captured', 'forlorn', 'beauty', 'American', 'landscape', 'American', 'psyche', 'intimate', 'bond', 'two', 'magnificent', 'expressionist', 'lens', 'cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'slant', 'light', 'shade', 'seem', 'constructed/designed', 'evoke', 'immense', 'mystery', 'immense', 'emptiness', 'heart', 'physical', 'things', 'more', 'sensitive', 'onlooker', 'more', 'intimate', 'will', 'be', 'bond', 'landscape', 'psyche', 'poetry', 'mythos', 'not', 'just', 'American', 'western', 'American', 'literature', 'Hawthorne', 'Poe', 'Melville', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Robert', 'Frost', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'American', 'landscape', 'are', 'inevitably', 'stories', 'biblical', 'proportions', 'men', 'women', 'struggling', 'forge', 'something', 'light', 'shade.This', 'film', 'American', 'poetry', 'mythos', 'Specifically', 'transitional', 'poetry', 'mythos', 'America', 'c.', '1880', 'time', 'when', 'individual', 'nation', 'were', 'still', 'suffering', 'devastating', 'psychic', 'effects', 'war', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'desperately', 'need', 'new', 'poetry', 'new', 'mythos', 'new', 'way', 'behold', 'world.This', 'film', 'looking', 'way', 'craft', 'mythos', 'One', 'way', 'nations', 'have', 'done', 'craft', 'heroes', 'not', 'always', 'poets', 'have', 'given', 'heroes', 'sometimes', 'most', 'effective', 'mythos', 'come', 'most', 'unexpected', 'sources', '1880', 'spinners', 'far-fetched', 'dime', 'store', 'yarns', 'crafted', 'hero', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Perhaps', 'fictions', 'were', 'more', 'accessible', 'heroes', 'more', 'easily', 'understood', 'were', 'fictions', 'heroes', 'Melville', 'Twain', 'home-spun', 'yarns', 'were', 'immensely', 'popular', 'wildly', 'inventive', 'tall', 'tales', 'captured', 'shaped', 'young', 'boys', 'imaginations', 'provided', 'someone', 'emulate', 'Jesse', 'James', 'dime', 'store', 'novels', 'always', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'situation', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'guns', 'only', 'used', 'when', 'had', 'most', 'never', 'doubted', 'Jesse', 'James', 'fiction', 'was', 'new', 'kind', 'American', 'hero', 'independent', 'adventurous', 'egalitarian', 'robbed', 'rich', 'gave', 'poor', '.Brad', 'Pitt', 'outlaw', 'Jesse', 'James', 'none', 'things', 'Jesse', 'James', 'selfish', 'tyrant', 'who', 'other', 'gang', 'members', 'who', 'servants', 'lucky', 'be', 'company', 'loner', 'isolated', 'even', 'own', 'brother', 'have', 'deep', 'connection', 'wife', 'children', 'perhaps', 'only', 'are', 'only', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'carry', 'guns', 'iconically', 'handsome', 'ideally', 'suited', 'play', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'though', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'who', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'forsaken', 'dreamer', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Jesse', 'James', 'reluctantly', 'even', 'more', 'reluctantly', 'Ford', 'also', 'loner', 'understanding/connection', 'Jesse', 'predicated', 'fact', 'seem', 'utterly', 'alienated', 'rest', 'humanity', 'singularly', 'suited', 'provide', 'other', 'discomfitting', 'kind', 'companionship', 'Never', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'more', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'was', 'Ford', 'James', 'moment', 'Ford', 'completely', 'enamoured', 'completely', 'disillusioned', 'boyhood', 'hero', 'Affleck', 'Ford', 'internal', 'conflict', 'absolutely', 'palpable', 'minute', 'onscreen', 'James', 'company', 'Ford', 'boyish', 'insecure', 'starstruck', 'yet', 'capable', 'unexpected', 'insight', 'shrewd', 'critique', 'driving', 'motive', 'everything', 'Ford', 'nothing', 'more', 'step', 'out', 'shade', 'condemned', 'light', 'James', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'unfold', 'way', 'imagined', 'would', 'wish', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'true', 'accomplish', 'must', 'do', 'something', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'ironically', 'only', 'extraordinary', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'do', 'kill', 'hero', 'Jesse', 'James.This', 'ultimately', 'fascinating', 'film', 'constructive', 'destructive', 'power', 'effects', 'myths', 'tell', 'live', 'how', 'weak', 'thing', 'truth', 'next', 'overwhelming', 'appeal', 'good', 'narrative', 'especially', 'one', 'sanctioned', 'public', 'opinion']",N/A

It portrays James as the highly charismatic yet deeply disturbed person he truly was. I think Pitt's portrayal of James was worthy of an Academy Award as was Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford. Having studied Missouri history and the James brothers in particular, I think this is the closest we will ever see on film to how Jesse James was in real life. It was wonderful.This movie is very dark, figuratively and literally, and it does not move at a fast pace. It is methodical. If you want an action movie, you'd best look to another film. It has scenes with fierce action, but they are scattered through a slow build to the climax. It only covers the last few months of James's life, so it is the slow period at the end. It does a masterful job of showing his deterioration mentally in the last few months of his life, and I thought showing what happened to the Ford brothers afterward was a great touch.I recommend this movie highly to anyone that enjoys history of the period.

Right away the first thing I noticed was teh remarkable direction/cinematography.  Next was the costumes and precise period attention to detail in the set design.  Thank goodness I was watching this movie on Blu-ray because it was absolutely beautiful and flawless.  it actually reminded me a lot of another recent film, ""There will be Blood.""

They share many qualities especially plodding along at their own damn pace.  If you are impatient or have a hunger for action this movie will not satisfy you.  But, on the other hand, if you enjoy US period pieces as well as severe character study and 1 very superb acting jobs, this might be for you.  Brad Pitt is more than adequate as the infamous Jesse James.  You can detect his mania just bellow the surface at all times.

I almost don't want to say very much, I'd rather you see for yourself and make your own determination.  But I simply hung on every half-cocked smirk and minute nervous twitch or stutter Affleck presented.Now if you're looking for a modern western with, let's say, more action, then I'd recommend you watch the remake of 3:10 to Yuma instead.

1125184,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B0010DR4BO,Eric S. Kim,"[5, 6]","I think we can all agree that there were some truly excellent films that have been released in the year 2007. No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Hot Fuzz, and Sicko are fine examples. And granted, there were some really awful films released that year as well (such as Disturbia and Bee Movie), but I won't go into that. Now, there have been three marvelous Western dramas of '07 that I have seen: No Country for Old Men (more of a contemporary Western), There Will Be Blood, and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. These are not your typical shoot-`em-up Westerns; they are psychological thrillers/dramas that can really give you a bad case of chills down the spine. No Country for Old Men is already one of my favorite films of all time. There Will Be Blood, although not one of my personal favorites, is still a masterpiece, and Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. As for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.....it is officially on my top favorites list. I mean it, as soon as I finished watching this movie, I began to admire it as much as I did for No Country. And while these two films are greatly different from each other, I think I love this one even more.The title of this movie does tell you what happens in the movie, but it's so much more than just the notorious assassination. In this film, we see the apparent degradation of Jesse James, while forming an eccentric friendship with Robert Ford and his brother Charley Ford. I won't go into much detail, but both Robert and Charley start to see the silent madness that is inside Jesse. And when both of their lives are in danger, they must make a crucial decision.....As I said before, this is not your typical Hollywood-style Western. You don't have massive gun battles or chariot chase scenes. What you get here is more of a psychological experience that is beautifully handled. Robert Ford was always looked down upon by people. Many people have seen him as dirt in his entire life, and that's what propels him to become somebody of great talent and inspiration. He looks up to Jesse James, and when the two slowly begin to bond as friends, Robert's respect for the man soon fades later on as he discovers something cynical about the outlaw. Jesse James himself becomes an important part of the story. Once the famous ""James"" gang is no more, Jesse is now on his own with none other than the Fords. He is still being hunted down by lawmen, and he starts to question his place on this earth (or at least that's how I see it). Judging by his appearance, he can look calm and well-mannered, especially with his own family. But other times, he can look silently psychotic. He can give you an icy stare, and at that moment, you have no idea what is going to happen next. Will he let you go or will he shoot you in the head? I found myself emotionally drenched because of all the emotional chaos that occurs from beginning to end.This film by Andrew Dominick reminds me of the directing style of Terrence Malick, one of my top favorite directors of all time. Dominick gives us some beautiful shots of natural scenery and trivial objects. The pacing is also familiar: anyone who has seen The Thin Red Line and The New World will know what I'm talking about. It lacks quick cut shots and mind-numbingly loud sound effects, and it's perfect for this film. I wouldn't think this character-driven story would work if it were an ADD-induced action spectacle. Speaking of action, there is very little of it. Most of it occurs in the beginning of the film (the famous train robbery scene), and the film relies heavily on characters and dialogue. This might put some people off who are expecting to see at least a bit of gunplay. If you're looking for some gunplay, then I would highly recommend the recent remake of 3:10 to Yuma, which is also a great Western film.But, of course, we shouldn't leave out Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. These are two of the most captivating performances I've ever seen on film. Pitt and Affleck play Jesse James and Robert Ford almost perfectly. The appearances, mannerisms, and communications are really spot-on (especially Affleck). I don't know much about the real James and Ford, but these are still solid performances. Affleck should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but then again, Javier Bardem (from No Country for Old Men) deserved it as well.This isn't a perfect film, but it's still a beautiful, well-made film that's emotionally gut-wrenching. Of all the Western films that have been made in the 20th Century and the new millennium, this might be my all-time favorite.Grade: A",5,Beautiful and emotionally gut-wrenching,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,4655,"['think', 'can', 'agree', 'were', 'truly', 'excellent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'year', '2007', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Sicko', 'are', 'fine', 'examples', 'granted', 'were', 'really', 'awful', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Disturbia', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'Now', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'marvelous', 'Western', 'dramas', ""'07"", 'have', 'seen', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'more', 'contemporary', 'Western', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'Westerns', 'are', 'psychological', 'can', 'really', 'give', 'bad', 'case', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'already', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'not', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'still', 'masterpiece', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', '..it', 'officially', 'top', 'favorites', 'list', 'mean', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'began', 'admire', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Country', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'greatly', 'different', 'other', 'think', 'love', 'one', 'even', 'title', 'movie', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'notorious', 'assassination', 'film', 'see', 'apparent', 'degradation', 'Jesse', 'James', 'forming', 'eccentric', 'friendship', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'brother', 'Charley', 'Ford', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'Robert', 'Charley', 'start', 'see', 'silent', 'madness', 'inside', 'Jesse', 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'danger', 'must', 'make', 'crucial', 'decision', '..As', 'said', 'before', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood-style', 'Western', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'massive', 'gun', 'battles', 'chariot', 'chase', 'scenes', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'more', 'psychological', 'experience', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'was', 'always', 'looked', 'upon', 'people', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'dirt', 'entire', 'life', 'what', 'become', 'somebody', 'great', 'talent', 'inspiration', 'up', 'Jesse', 'James', 'when', 'two', 'slowly', 'begin', 'bond', 'friends', 'Robert', 'respect', 'man', 'soon', 'later', 'something', 'cynical', 'outlaw', 'Jesse', 'James', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'famous', 'James', 'gang', 'more', 'Jesse', 'now', 'own', 'none', 'other', 'Fords', 'still', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'lawmen', 'question', 'place', 'earth', 'least', 'how', 'see', 'Judging', 'appearance', 'can', 'look', 'calm', 'well-mannered', 'especially', 'own', 'family', 'other', 'times', 'can', 'look', 'silently', 'psychotic', 'can', 'give', 'icy', 'stare', 'moment', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Will', 'let', 'go', 'will', 'shoot', 'head', 'found', 'emotionally', 'drenched', 'emotional', 'chaos', 'beginning', 'end.This', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Dominick', 'directing', 'style', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'directors', 'time', 'Dominick', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'natural', 'scenery', 'trivial', 'objects', 'pacing', 'also', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'New', 'World', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'quick', 'cut', 'shots', 'mind-numbingly', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'perfect', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'character-driven', 'story', 'would', 'work', 'were', 'ADD-induced', 'action', 'spectacle', 'Speaking', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'Most', 'beginning', 'film', 'famous', 'train', 'robbery', 'scene', 'film', 'heavily', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'might', 'put', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'least', 'bit', 'gunplay', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gunplay', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'recent', 'remake', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'also', 'great', 'Western', 'film.But', 'course', 'should', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'captivating', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Pitt', 'Affleck', 'play', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'appearances', 'mannerisms', 'communications', 'are', 'really', 'spot-on', 'especially', 'Affleck', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'real', 'James', 'Ford', 'are', 'still', 'solid', 'performances', 'Affleck', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'then', 'again', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'deserved', 'well.This', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'still', 'beautiful', 'well-made', 'film', 'emotionally', 'gut-wrenching', 'Western', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', '20th', 'Century', 'new', 'millennium', 'might', 'be', 'all-time', 'favorite.Grade']",N/A

The running time was even longer than the inflated title:160 minutes. What can I say? The movie was just way too long. It was really not much of a story and the pace was glacial. I began to wonder when it would ever end. Fortunately, the photography was quite beautiful and well done, although the landscape didn't fit the locale. Trust me. I'm a geologist. Well, no matter. it's just that I had plenty of time to view the beautiful photography and I appreciated it. In general, the movie was well directed, but Director Andrew Dominik should have exerted some control on the length of the film. I might add that the sound on this film was exceptionally good. Nice job! It's a film that had considerable merit, but it was weakened by being strung out way, way too long.In general, the acting on this film was rather good. Brad Pitt was, well, Brad Pitt and he was not particularly convincing as Jesse James, nor was Casey Affleck particularly convincing as Robert Ford. I just wasn't impressed. It seems a poor casting for these two dominant roles. The rest of the cast performed admirably at their glacial pacing.The story depicted the demise of the James Gang and other hoodlum groups of the late 1800s. One by one, they all dropped out. Jesse James and his gang were even down to a few loyal members and most of those were suspected of wanting the reward money for the head of Jesse James. As such, jesse became a bit paranoid, as depicted weakly by Pitt, and the other gang members were always in danger of being shot as a suspect. It was not a happy camp. Finally, Jesse was done in and I breathed a sigh of relief, but the film lingered on for another 20 minutes just tying the loose ends together. Well, it must be difficult to present a historical story of a legendary character. I guess it has to be grandiose to be considered worthwhile.Gary Peterson",3,Fine Production.

This film is different.Jesse James emerged from the guerilla bushwacking version of the Civil War in Missouri to become a notorious bank and train robber after the Confederate defeat. But despite a romantic image as the last rebel fighter, a Robin Hood who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, Jesse James was actually just a violent outlaw, in it for himself.This film opens with the final robbery by the James gang in 1879, followed by the departure of Jesse's older brother Frank. The camera work, especially at the beginning and towards the end, is sometimes outstanding, film as art. The story is very slow moving, a lot of conversation, with occasional bursts of violence, in a way that feels very real. It takes a while to work out exactly who the gang hangers-on are, and how some of them are related to each other.Rather than a Robin Hood, Jesse James is brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt as an increasingly paranoid killer. His murder of former gang members he believes plan to turn him in for the reward, and a falling out between two of the outlaws over one sleeping with the stepmother of the other, ultimately leads to Bob Ford and his brother Charlie planning to kill Jesse, as they stay with him while he hides out under the name of Thomas Howard. The scene is played as if Jesse knew what was coming and let it happen on purpose, turning his back on an armed Bob Ford. There's a feeling of Jesus and Judas in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", but there's little indication why the unpredictable Jesse has chosen this course.The Ford brothers get little satisfaction in the end, with Robert Ford going down in history as ""The dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard"".

1125192,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0010DR4BO,Grady Harp,"[117, 136]","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of the finer films about the history of the Old West 'heroes' such as Jesse James.  It is difficult to describe the degree of high quality of the way in which this film has been created: the script (adapted by Andrew Dominick from Ron Hansen's novel) is as poetic as it is gritty and flows like a Shakespearean tragedy both in narration and in dialog; the exceptionally fine cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the flavor of the times, shot in subtle lighting whether in darkly intimate interiors or on the vast plains at times heightened by snowlight, but always in the feeling of the quality of daguerreotypes; the musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is strangely apropos without seeming to borrow from any previous source; and the cast of fine actors play the film as a true ensemble work.  Director Andrew Dominik has accomplished a masterpiece.The story begins subtly in the last year of the James gang at the final train robbery in 1881. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) have gathered remnant criminals to bolster their decimated gang - Dick Liddel (Paul Schneider), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt), and Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) among them.  The Ford brothers want to ride with Jesse: 19-year old Robert (Casey Affleck) idolizes Jesse and his older brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) enjoys the attention of the gang's fame.  Jesse James, at only age 34, is at the end of his career, content to be at home with his wife Zee (Mary Louise Parker) and children.  But Robert's adoration results in a chain of events that slowly dissembles the gang and results in Robert's obsessive revenge for Jesse's  murder of one of the members fired by the promise of reward for the capture of Jesse James, dead or alive. History and the title of the film tell the plot so there are no surprises here.  It is the inevitable unfolding of the drama and the tension of the interplay of the actors that drives the mood of the story.  The film does not stop with the killing of Jesse James but instead follows the descent of the lives of Robert (now wealthy and in love a stripper - Zooey Deschanel) and the progressing insanity of Charley to an end that fades like the proverbial sunset on a time in our history we will never forget.Each of the actors is exceptional, and despite the glory of having big name stars associated with the cast, the effect is one of pure ensemble work.  The 160 minute running time of the film never seems too long, so well timed is the pacing of the story and the pauses for understanding the interior aspects of each character's mind.  This is a haunting film, unusually fine in every detail.  It deserves, and demands, attention.

Up until this role i always thought him to be a nothing actor but this really goes to show how sometimes even the most unlikely people can surprise you.  Director Andrew Dominik who made the fantastic ""Chopper"" which launched the career of Eric Bana onto the international stage, gives us his second long awaited film.  Reminiscent of the works of Terrence Malick, we are treated here to a slow, moody and intelligent insight into the life of Jesse James as seen through the brooding eyes of Robert Ford, a James Gang member whom would later turn against his mentor and take his life.  Brad Pitt captures the essence of Jesse, filling him with callousness, anger, pity and sadness, a performance quite different then previous cinematic attempts to portray this character.  All the supporting cast are great and the music simply and movingly scored by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis whom previously lended their terrific talents to the brilliant ""The Proposition"".  This film is slow and requires patience but is quite hypnotic and engrossing and well worth the journey for those who can appreciate intelligent, non action driven cinema.

A long movie, at 160 minutes, it breathes, as opposed to moves, at an unhurried pace, like a slow steam train forever halting to a stop, as it rides a paranoid and lonely trail, treats character conversations with cinematic patience, reveals dusty 19th Century American towns and cities as if bringing life to vintage photographs, and riles things up with a frightful night-time train hold-up, shot in shadowy sequences, that features a splendid and nightmarish scene of outlaws in ragged masks awaiting the beaming white light of the approaching doomed train. Director Andrew Domink has a handle on the gun draw, (and American western history in general), with two dynamic scenes of characters, poised on adrenalin, shooting another through the head, as if deciding at the most oppurtune moment to swat a fly off the wall. And like that train halting at it's destination with a steely screech and last steam cloud blowing, the film winds down, most unusual for a western, with a denouement, that follows the assassin for a considerable time after the murder to his own western justified fate.

I rather enjoyed the bleak yet realistically portrayed conditions of frontier town life and the typical period style shameless sideshow staged events that this movie profiles. While the title gives away the culminating event, by the end of the film, you find yourself sympathizing with the fabled outlaw, despite his horrific deeds.

Those of you who expect a blow by blow rundown of thelife of Jesse James will be either disappointed or find it refreshing (Like I did!)the way that this film was approached. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) is nearing the end ofhis infamous career of robbery & murder and is now 34 yrs old, but with theworld-weariness of a man in his 60's. The years are 1881 & '82.He has become very reflective at this point in his life, and is kind of justcoasting on his legend. Pitt plays this role with a chilling aloofness,a diabolical cunning, underscored by a calculated viciousness.You just never know where you stand with his rendition of Jesse James...friend one minute and foe the next!You would imagine Jesse James as being someone who couldn't allow himselfto trust anyone or make himself seem vulnerable in the least, for fear oftreachery & betrayal..which is just what wound up happening in the end.I also liked the way Brad played his Jesse James as a co-lead to Casey Affleck'sequally brilliant portrayal of Robert Ford!Affleck can play these slightly off-beat, detached, flawed, seemingly foggy,but fiendishly clever kind of roles. (See ""Gone Baby Gone"" and others.)His Robert Ford is played as a muddled, unsure-of-himself kid who occassionally getsto be a part of the new gang of rag-tag outlaws that Jesse and his brother Frank haveput together do their last ""jobs"" before they retire from their lives of crime.He (Ford) absolutely adores Jesse, and has since he was a child who read the nicklecomic books which spread the legend of Jesse James and other outlaws of the wild west!Frank James sees Ford as a creepy fame-hungry nut early on and almost kills himin one of the earlier scenes in the film.But Jesse only sees him as an empty-headed kid with delusions of grandeur whohe can exploit to do his bidding and discard.Jesse inadvertently snubs him and hurts his feelings, which sets about awhole chain of events that lead to him betraying his hero by murderinghim, thinking that it will finally win him the respect he feels he so richly deserves.Of course, that all backfires in the end too!Very brilliantly done by Pitt and Affleck, as well as a great supporting cast.Excellent cinematography and screenplay as well.Brad adorns his native Missouri accent to bring this fellow Missourian to life.He also acts as a producer for this film.I enjoyed it and purchased it as well.",5,Brilliantly Done!!---Not Your Average Jesse James Flick!,1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,2543,"['Being', 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'had', 'check', 'film', 'out.It', 'was', 'released', 'primarily', 'secondary', 'markets', 'arthouse', 'theatresin', 'limited', 'release', 'who', 'expect', 'blow', 'blow', 'rundown', 'thelife', 'Jesse', 'James', 'will', 'be', 'either', 'disappointed', 'find', 'refreshing', 'did', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'approached', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'nearing', 'end', 'ofhis', 'infamous', 'career', 'robbery', 'murder', 'now', '34', 'yrs', 'old', 'theworld-weariness', 'man', '60', 'years', 'are', '1881', 'become', 'very', 'reflective', 'point', 'life', 'kind', 'justcoasting', 'legend', 'Pitt', 'role', 'chilling', 'aloofness', 'diabolical', 'cunning', 'underscored', 'calculated', 'viciousness.You', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'stand', 'rendition', 'Jesse', 'James', 'friend', 'one', 'minute', 'foe', 'next', 'would', 'imagine', 'Jesse', 'James', 'being', 'someone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'allow', 'himselfto', 'trust', 'anyone', 'make', 'seem', 'vulnerable', 'least', 'fear', 'oftreachery', 'betrayal..which', 'just', 'what', 'wound', 'up', 'happening', 'end.I', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Brad', 'played', 'Jesse', 'James', 'co-lead', 'Casey', ""Affleck'sequally"", 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Affleck', 'can', 'play', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'detached', 'flawed', 'seemingly', 'foggy', 'fiendishly', 'clever', 'kind', 'roles', 'See', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'others', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'played', 'muddled', 'unsure-of-himself', 'kid', 'who', 'occassionally', 'getsto', 'be', 'part', 'new', 'gang', 'rag-tag', 'outlaws', 'Jesse', 'brother', 'Frank', 'haveput', 'together', 'do', 'last', 'jobs', 'retire', 'lives', 'crime.He', 'Ford', 'absolutely', 'Jesse', 'was', 'child', 'who', 'read', 'nicklecomic', 'books', 'spread', 'legend', 'Jesse', 'James', 'other', 'outlaws', 'wild', 'west', 'Frank', 'James', 'Ford', 'creepy', 'fame-hungry', 'nut', 'early', 'almost', 'kills', 'himin', 'one', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'film.But', 'Jesse', 'only', 'empty-headed', 'kid', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'whohe', 'can', 'exploit', 'do', 'bidding', 'discard.Jesse', 'inadvertently', 'feelings', 'awhole', 'chain', 'events', 'lead', 'betraying', 'hero', 'murderinghim', 'thinking', 'will', 'finally', 'win', 'respect', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves.Of', 'course', 'backfires', 'end', 'too', 'Very', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'Pitt', 'Affleck', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast.Excellent', 'cinematography', 'screenplay', 'well.Brad', 'native', 'Missouri', 'accent', 'bring', 'fellow', 'Missourian', 'life.He', 'also', 'producer', 'film.I', 'enjoyed', 'purchased', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The most notorious criminal around the nation, hunted by the law in 10 states.But as all we know, the betrayal walks with velvet shoes, silent, prudent and fearful thinks over and over the moment when Jesse be sent out of this world. And so on, it begins a slow paced portrait, an inner exploration about the way an illustrious unknown Robert Ford (Cassey Afleck) befriends with Jesse thanks his brother is part of the gang. Jesse (34) is tired of killing, stealing and getting away along the country. Mountains of dead bodies and assaulted banks and stagecoachs become dark and sinister nightmares. On the other hand, his body shows evidences of weakening and his familiar affections permeate his future plans.Andrew Dominik's personal perspective builds a story following the traces of a Shakesperian tragedy. He is aware the end is near, and that's what impulses him to spend the last days before the great heist under the intimacy of his home.The psychological profiles of both supposed hunters (who are really more fearful than his prey) are poetically suggested. For instance, watch carefully the moment in which Bob Ford washes his hands and face over and over (a visible allusion to Macbeth's wife when she washes her hands of Duncan's blood). Finally notice how Jesse and his cousin are murdered on backs to his assassins.Perhaps, the film moves a bit overlong but with fruitful results.

Sure, some films that bust the mold on originality and excellence and are recognized by the academy.  There are also some films that are unjustly lost in the mix.  THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of those flicks.  Should've won every statue in 2007.  A dreary masterpiece, every aspect of this western that doesn't look like a western is dead, solid perfect.This movie clocks in somewhere around 205 minutes, and never outstays its welcome whilst fascinating the viewer.  CASEY AFFLECK, nominated for best supporting actor, was robbed.  His ROBERT FORD was one of the most complex celluloid characters fleshed out in a long, long time.  Some of the best movie characters are those who can be sympathetic one moment and utterly despicable the next.  MR. AFFLECK had nailed it.  BRAD PITT was robbed.  His JESSE JAMES was played with such brutal unpredictability it made me realize that, aside from the pushed media hullabaloo regarding his personal life, what a damn fine actor he is.  Writer/director ANDREW DOMINIK was robbed.  A great story told with tangible passion by an overly able filmmaker.  ROGER DEAKINS, nominated for best cinematography, was robbed and hit over the head with a brick.  The beauty of this motion picture is unparalleled.  The vistas, the locations, and the vision (especially the photography through distorted glass) are watermarks that many of other established movie makers should study.  It's simply breathtaking.The remainder of the cast and crew are equally superb, especially SAM ROCKWELL as CHARLIE FORD, who has been great in most of the roles I've seen him portray.The themes presented in the proceedings are totally relevant in today's society.

I assume the Brad Pitt connection made that inevitable, perhaps with my subconscious seeing Pitt's Paul Maclean as the type boy who under the same circumstances could become a Jesse James.Those who know the James family saga and do not judge it by the standards of post-Civil War/Reconstruction cliches, and perhaps especially those who also know the story of Australia's Iron Outlaw Ned Kelly, will understand.Because of the era and west of the Mississippi setting, most viewers will come to this film expecting a Western. The vast majority of those will also expect more action than this film delivers. But to its great merit, The Assasination of Jesse James is not what most would label a 'typical' Western. It is finely etched character study of three men: Jesse, Bob Ford, and his older brother Charlie. Each of the three actors is stunning in his portrayal, with Pitt so disciplined that his performace will strike most viewers as almost innocuous. I easily can make a case for Affleck as having deserved an Oscar and another for Rockwell having deserved a nomination.Like Unforgiven, this film shows us the problems that come from media created and endlessly vomited celebrity by making the nickel/dime novels central to the action. Those products of mass produced reading material utterly falsifying the West, romanticizing both outlaws and the lawmen and privately hired killers sent after bank and train robbers, have forged the young Bob Ford into a hero worshiper who, somewhat like the later Mark David Chapman, will kill the object of his romanticized adoration.The Assasination of Jesse James fails to genuflect before any cliches or political platitudes. Jesse is ruthless to protect himself and his identity, and he is shown being needlessly violent in the train robbery. But he also appears to be a man who would shuck it all to become something of a homebody (riding off on real cattle buying trips with Frank) if he were not caught in the trap of his own past and celebrity. Jesse, like a Greek tragic hero, seem to welcome, enen encourage, his death from behind.Bob is the ridiculously worshipful boy, teased by the older men, who comes to resent the object of his adoration, perhaps when he realizes that Jesse is indeed just a man, a complex, flawed man. Then the threats and rewards from the powers of government and big business are snares he will not evade. Bob then becomes the celebrity, playing himself onstage kiling Jesse James: the absurd world of the dime Western brought to life for monied city folk back east. Bob Ford, who had become the dancing bear for the rich folks who paid for Jesse's death, dies much as did Jesse: essentially a tragic figure, that which made him great inevitably marring his final days and striking him down.",5,Beautifully Haunting,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,2930,"['Oddly', 'enough', 'movie', 'line', 'came', 'watched', 'closing', 'Assasination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'am', 'haunted', 'waters', 'assume', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'connection', 'made', 'inevitable', 'perhaps', 'subconscious', 'seeing', 'Pitt', 'Paul', 'Maclean', 'type', 'boy', 'who', 'same', 'circumstances', 'could', 'become', 'Jesse', 'James.Those', 'who', 'know', 'James', 'family', 'saga', 'do', 'not', 'judge', 'standards', 'post-Civil', 'War/Reconstruction', 'cliches', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'who', 'also', 'know', 'story', 'Australia', 'Iron', 'Outlaw', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'will', 'understand.Because', 'era', 'west', 'Mississippi', 'setting', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'film', 'expecting', 'Western', 'vast', 'majority', 'will', 'also', 'expect', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'delivers', 'great', 'merit', 'Assasination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'label', ""'typical"", 'Western', 'finely', 'etched', 'character', 'study', 'three', 'men', 'Jesse', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'older', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'three', 'actors', 'stunning', 'portrayal', 'Pitt', 'so', 'disciplined', 'performace', 'will', 'strike', 'most', 'viewers', 'almost', 'innocuous', 'easily', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'Affleck', 'having', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Rockwell', 'having', 'deserved', 'nomination.Like', 'Unforgiven', 'film', 'problems', 'come', 'media', 'created', 'endlessly', 'vomited', 'celebrity', 'making', 'nickel/dime', 'novels', 'central', 'action', 'products', 'mass', 'produced', 'reading', 'material', 'utterly', 'falsifying', 'West', 'romanticizing', 'outlaws', 'lawmen', 'privately', 'hired', 'killers', 'sent', 'bank', 'train', 'robbers', 'have', 'forged', 'young', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'hero', 'worshiper', 'who', 'somewhat', 'later', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'will', 'kill', 'object', 'romanticized', 'adoration.The', 'Assasination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'genuflect', 'cliches', 'political', 'platitudes', 'Jesse', 'ruthless', 'protect', 'identity', 'shown', 'being', 'needlessly', 'violent', 'train', 'robbery', 'also', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'shuck', 'become', 'something', 'homebody', 'riding', 'off', 'real', 'cattle', 'buying', 'trips', 'Frank', 'were', 'not', 'caught', 'trap', 'own', 'past', 'celebrity', 'Jesse', 'Greek', 'tragic', 'hero', 'seem', 'welcome', 'enen', 'encourage', 'death', 'behind.Bob', 'ridiculously', 'worshipful', 'boy', 'teased', 'older', 'men', 'who', 'resent', 'object', 'adoration', 'perhaps', 'when', 'Jesse', 'indeed', 'just', 'man', 'complex', 'flawed', 'man', 'Then', 'threats', 'rewards', 'powers', 'government', 'big', 'business', 'are', 'will', 'not', 'evade', 'Bob', 'then', 'celebrity', 'playing', 'onstage', 'kiling', 'Jesse', 'James', 'absurd', 'world', 'dime', 'Western', 'brought', 'life', 'monied', 'city', 'folk', 'back', 'east', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'dancing', 'bear', 'rich', 'folks', 'who', 'paid', 'Jesse', 'death', 'much', 'did', 'Jesse', 'essentially', 'tragic', 'figure', 'made', 'great', 'inevitably', 'marring', 'final', 'days', 'striking', 'down']",N/A

Now before you say that I can't appreciate a good drama, let me counter by saying that Deadwood is my favorite television show. It's (Deadwood) filled with tension that build characters and story. This film is, in contrast, filled with scene after scene that (a majority of the time) does NOTHING.The product description describes the plot best without giving anything away: ""Everyone in 1880s America knows Jesse James. He's the nation's most notorious criminal, hunted by the law in 10 states. He's also the land's greatest hero, lauded as a Robin Hood by the public. Robert Ford? No one knows him. Not yet. But the ambitious 19-year-old aims to change that. He'll befriend Jesse, ride with his gang. And if that doesn't bring Ford fame, he'll find a deadlier way. Friendship becomes rivalry and the quest for fame becomes obsession in this virile epic produced in part by Ridley Scott and featuring gripping portrayals by Brad Pitt (winner of the Venice Film Festival Best Actor Award) as Jesse and Casey Affleck as the youth drawn closer to his goal...and farther from his own humanity.""Yep, Robert Ford has one heck of a man crush on Jesse James. His obsession is pretty freaky to say the least. One of the major problems with this film is its pacing. Perhaps this was in part because of the script but I'd blame the studio for not making the call to tighten things up in editing. There's something to be said for extended editions and deleted scenes on home video releases and that would be great for fans who want to see that type of thing. However, so many scenes in this film are pointless, drawn-out garbage. There is also something to be said for character development and there are terrific ways to do that but this film never really seems to get around to that.The Blu-ray doesn't fair too much better I'm afraid. The film lacks color and in some way, I'm sure this was intentional. But it doesn't make for anything too pleasing to the eyes. There is also some artifacts that are found throughout the transfer. Audio on the other hand is crisp, clean and clear making nice use of 5.1 sound.When Hollywood wonders why so many people would rather just pirate their films instead of buying a DVD or blu-ray, one of the primary reasons is because modern Blu-ray and DVDs don't come with the amount of extras they used to. When DVD was a new format, even niche titles were loaded down with bonus material. Sadly, despite the evolution of video quality, extras have somehow devolved in the process and this is a prime example. There's not even a directors commentary. That's pretty sad.Conclusion:The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is not a good film nor is it a good Blu-ray. I do believe it's the worst Western I've ever seen and honestly, one of the most boring films I've ever seen.

1125207,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B0010DR4BO,Jason Horsley,"[4, 5]","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an elegy of futility, an exquisite scorched earth of a movie. Its themes creep up on you and seep into your bones. A tale of friendship and betrayal, it's also a portrait of rootlessness, of violent men who kill because they don't know what else men are supposed to do, and it has some of the grizzled, melancholic grandeur of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns. Yet there's nothing generic about this film, and nothing melodramatic either; it's closer to lyric realism. Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (Chopper) from a novel by Ron Hansen, the film is an epic poem, a primordial vision. With its dreamlike landscapes and its delicate piano and violin score, The Assassination of Jesse James owes a clear debt to the early films of Terence Malick (Badlands, Days of Heaven), and there are images here that are among the most beautiful and haunting I have ever seen in a movie. Yet the visuals are never made to compensate for a lack of story (as with Malick's later films), and they aren't hypnotic for their own sake. Dominik uses them sparingly, poetically, like a master painter. The film is almost three hours long, but it doesn't meander and it never seems indulgent. Dominik shows a loving attention to detail, a sense of the ebb and flow of his scenes, that is reminiscent of Coppola's first two Godfather films. Assassination isn't quite on that level (its characters aren't that rich or alive, and the story, though poignant, isn't full-blown tragedy), but how many films can be compared to The Godfather? I think it's the finest Western film since McCabe and Mrs. Miller (it has a similar delicate pathos and poetic intensity), and never mind the Oscars: it's easily the best film of 2007.At first, Brad Pitt might seem somewhat lacking in the central role. Pitt is a problematic actor: when he has a role that allows him to get out of himself and let rip (such as Twelve Monkeys or Fight Club), he can be a riveting, electrifying presence; but like Jack Nicholson, he can also be lazy and coast on star appeal. He does a little of that here: his Jesse seems only partly rendered, a sketch, and as a result the film at times lacks for a stronger center. But Pitt's Jesse grows on you. This is an extremely tricky performance and in the end I think he pulls it off and does some of his best work. Pitt makes Jesse both menacing and oddly affecting, lost and almost childlike, a figure of pathos. And although we never really come to know him, there are moments when Pitt suggests that Jesse is an enigma even to himself. (When he talks about counting the stars, for example: a confederate says he isn't even sure what stars are, and Jesse replies, ""Your body knows; your mind just forgot, that's all."")There are plenty of performances to watch here: Jeremy Renner as Wood, Sam Shepard as Frank James, and especially Paul Schneider (from All the Real Girls), as Dick Liddil. Kailin See, as a sexually frustrated house-wife Dick allows to seduce him, gives the only outstanding female performance. (Despite her high billing, Mary-Louise Parker, as Jesse's loving wife Zee, barely appears in the film except to look loving and to bemoan Jesse's death). And although he has a major role as Charlie Ford, the usually mesmerizing Sam Rockwell isn't given enough to do here. You'd never guess how talented he is from this role, but he's a welcome presence anyway.The outstanding performance comes from Casey Affleck (Ben's younger brother), whose creepy Bob Ford is one of the most original characters ever created for the screen. From his first moments, Affleck puts us on guard: there's something not quite right about Bob, yet we can't put our finger on it. (By the end of the film we still don't know; Shepard's Frank states it for us, however, in the very first scene: ""I don't know what it is about you, but the more you talk, the more you give me the willies."") Bob's worship of Jesse prefigures the slavish, faintly psychotic devotion of modern-day celebrity hounds like King of Comedy's Rupert Pupkin; when Bob smiles, he sets his small teeth on edge and we can feel the hostility lurking inside him, waiting to come out. (It may be buried so deep even he is unaware of it.) In the end, the film is as much about Bob as it is about Jesse (who is never quite real to us), and maybe more so. The amorphous spell of melancholy which the film casts upon us comes as much from our feelings for Bob as for Jesse. Creepy as he is, we never hate Bob; by the end, we may feel almost unbearable pity for him.It may be facile to say that The Assassination of Jesse James is about lost souls and false heroes; the film is so deftly, instinctively made, so light of touch, that it never pushes its meanings. But they are there, and the exquisite beauty of the film, the ghostlike images, the long silences, the open spaces it allows to exist both inside and between the scenes, combine to create a haunted, otherworldly quality, and a sense of unglimpsed depths. There's a moment, towards the end of the film, when the Ford brothers leave the James house where they are staying (and where Bob will assassinate Jesse), and we are allowed to see the surrounding countryside, and the skeletal town that is growing up in it. The image comes as a shock, because until now the intimacy of the film has kept our focus closely bound to the characters; despite its epic scope, there seemed no need to recreate the greater world in which they exist (or for the film's budget to include such elaborate sets). The image is all the more breathtaking for coming so unexpected, and we may be struck by how much care has gone into creating this world, seemingly for its own sake, independent of the story. At such a late stage, letting us see the fruit of this work seems almost an afterthought. Dominik may be so intensely inside his vision that he is indifferent to whether or not we experience it--the process of creation is enough. He has the focus and immersion of a true alchemist.This is an almost perfect film (the ungainly title and the absence of women characters notwithstanding; even Nick Cave's improbable cameo is forgivable--he co-wrote the gorgeous score with Warren Ellis). Yet it's an elusive work, and definitely not for everyone. A lot of people will miss its ineffable, alchemical grace, and mistake it for a rather long, lugubrious Western. Like Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Dominik is not interested in genre conventions, not even enough to subvert them. He's inventing a whole new genre in order for this one work to be exactly what it needs to be. (There's very little action in the film, yet it's full of suspense; and the occasional violence is never what we expect, it's never not disturbing.) At times, the effects Dominik gets are so unique, so inspired, that they seem faintly mysterious. He's a major, major talent. The Assassination of Jesse James is both an epic about the process by which legends are made and a tender, intimate love story between two antagonists so utterly dissimilar they might come from two different worlds. Yet they do have one thing in common: both men are so lost to themselves that at times the film seems almost like a ghost story. In a way, that's what it is.",5,Ghost of a Legend,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,7266,"['Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'elegy', 'futility', 'exquisite', 'scorched',

The sets and evocation of the times are sterling. Pitt makes us feel like he really nailed Jesse. Powerful, charismatic, a liitle bit(?) loco. The narration is poetical. Makes me want to read the novel. Affleck was perfectly cast as Ford who at first worshipped Jesse, then betrayed him and had to shoot him when his betrayal was discovered.  James Carville's turn as the governor of Missouri worked surprisingly well. The film is a study of characthers. It's not for old fashioned ""shoot 'em up"" fans. Nothing like ""Long Riders,"" which is one of my favorites.The one good gunfight in the film was surprising and very realistic. There is no illusory presentation of 19th century outlaws as people who would, if given a choice, chance a face to face gunfight with even odds. The preference for ambush is totally realistic and historically accurate.The movie is very long, I watched it in three sittings. Like reading a novel, and it was very enjoyable.

1125219,A61RNXZ3HWKGB,B0010DR4BO,"John Murphy ""O, for a Muse of Fire""","[2, 4]","Adapted from Ron Hansen's book of the same name, ""Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a snail-paced psychological drama -- heavy on the psychology, light on the drama. The elements are all in place for a good, possibly great, movie: spare, poetic dialogue delivered by well-cast actors (always nice to see Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepard, and the especially excellent Garret Dillahunt); lyrical, atmospheric cinematography by Oscar-nominated Roger Deakins; evocative soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis; and an interesting story featuring larger-than-life characters and melancholic themes.So why do the elements not combine to make a great movie? There's probably a long way of answering that question and a short way. Unlike the movie, I'll opt for the shorter route. At two hours and forty minutes, ""Assassination"" is as slow as molasses in January. (And this from a guy whose favorite directors include Andrei Tarkovsky, Terrence Malick, and David Lean.) Here's the problem, I think. Though meditatively paced, it is never clear what exactly the filmmakers are meditating on. America's unhealthy obsession with outlaws? The exacting price of fame and notoriety? The disillusionment of hero-worship? The nature of betrayal? The complicated motivations and meanings behind an apparent act of cowardice? To get its jumbled ideas across, the movie relies on voice-over narration lifted whole cloth from Hansen's book -- a concession, in a way, to the fact that the film never solves the problem of how to make its characters' interior struggles visually dramatic. Instead, the narrator informs us what the characters are thinking as we watch them stare pensively out a window or across a windswept plain.Pitt is an interesting choice for the part of Jesse James. Casting a world-famous celebrity as the world-famous celebrity outlaw is a clever bit of meta-commentary. But the idea is more effective in the abstract than in the execution. Pitt lacks the intensity that makes you believe Jesse James murdered seventeen people. The movie as a whole would have benefited from the fierceness and unpredictability of an actor like Daniel Craig, whose piercing blue eyes can seem challenging, ruthless, and devoid of pity, including self-pity. Pitt should be commended for tackling interesting, offbeat material, however.Casey Affleck, unlike Pitt, is able to manifest his character's pained, insecure interior life through a performance eloquent with nervous mannerisms, unconvincing affectations, empty smiles, and crippling social awkwardness. Ford's story is a sad one, worth telling, and no doubt when Hansen came across it in the history books he felt that he couldn't improve on the truth. Perhaps the director, Andrew Dominik felt like he couldn't improve on his source material -- you can just about read the book in the same amount of time it takes to watch the movie.",3,Almost as Long as the Title...,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2894,"['Adapted', 'Ron', 'Hansen', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'snail-paced', 'psychological', 'drama', 'heavy', 'psychology', 'light', 'drama', 'elements', 'are', 'place', 'good', 'possibly', 'great', 'movie', 'spare', 'poetic', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'well-cast', 'actors', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'especially', 'excellent', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'lyrical', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'evocative', 'soundtrack', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'interesting', 'story', 'featuring', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'melancholic', 'themes.So', 'why', 'do', 'elements', 'not', 'combine', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'probably', 'long', 'way', 'answering', 'question', 'short', 'way', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'opt', 'shorter', 'route', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'minutes', 'Assassination', 'as', 'slow', 'molasses', 'January', 'guy', 'favorite', 'directors', 'include', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'David', 'Lean', 'Here', 'problem', 'think', 'Though', 'meditatively', 'paced', 'never', 'clear', 'what', 'exactly', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'meditating', 'America', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'outlaws', 'exacting', 'price', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'disillusionment', 'hero-worship', 'nature', 'betrayal', 'complicated', 'motivations', 'meanings', 'apparent', 'act', 'cowardice', 'get', 'jumbled', 'ideas', 'movie', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'lifted', 'whole', 'cloth', 'Hansen', 'book', 'concession', 'way', 'fact', 'film', 'never', 'problem', 'how', 'make', 'characters', 'interior', 'struggles', 'visually', 'dramatic', 'Instead', 'narrator', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'thinking', 'watch', 'stare', 'pensively', 'out', 'window', 'windswept', 'plain.Pitt', 'interesting', 'choice', 'part', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Casting', 'world-famous', 'celebrity', 'world-famous', 'celebrity', 'outlaw', 'clever', 'bit', 'meta-commentary', 'idea', 'more', 'effective', 'abstract', 'execution', 'Pitt', 'intensity', 'believe', 'Jesse', 'James', 'murdered', 'seventeen', 'people', 'movie', 'whole', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'fierceness', 'unpredictability', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'can', 'seem', 'challenging', 'ruthless', 'devoid', 'pity', 'including', 'self-pity', 'Pitt', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'tackling', 'interesting', 'offbeat', 'material', 'however.Casey', 'Affleck', 'Pitt', 'able', 'manifest', 'character', 'pained', 'insecure', 'interior', 'life', 'performance', 'eloquent', 'nervous', 'mannerisms', 'unconvincing', 'affectations', 'empty', 'smiles', 'crippling', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'Ford', 'story', 'sad', 'one', 'worth', 'telling', 'doubt', 'when', 'Hansen', 'came', 'history', 'books', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'improve', 'truth', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'improve', 'source', 'material', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

1125225,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0010DR4BO,Kaya Savas,"[196, 224]","As a fan of the western genre I look forward to pretty much every western I hear is in the works since they come so few and far between nowadays. I am also a huge fan of Sergio Leone and Terrence Malick; two directors who use extremely long takes with exquisite deep focus photography. I had never heard of Andrew Dominik until I researched this film, and when I checked his history and saw that he had only done one other film called Chopper I felt skeptical as to what he would do with The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. Then I saw the trailer which sent chills up my spine and even made my eyes water, and this film became my top priority for the fall.The film follows Robert Ford and two of his brothers as they join the James brothers for one final robbery. Robert Ford played brilliantly by Casey Affleck sees Jesse James as his idol. He followed his stories throughout his childhood and he wants nothing more than to be accepted by this man. Affleck portrays Ford as a very insecure and quiet man who almost feels ashamed for being himself. Being the youngest of five brothers one can assume he is tired of being at the bottom and one day wants the fame and attention that someone like Jesse James gets. Brad Pitt plays the complex Jesse James brilliantly with a performance that will send chills up your spine. His character is pretty hard to analyze. One can infer that James is a man who enjoys his reputation but sometimes longs for a life without the attention so that he can be happy with his wife and family. Another important character in this film is that of Charley Ford who is played by the great Sam Rockwell. With this film Rockwell proves he is capable of amazing things as an actor. He adds many dimensions to the character that otherwise would be meaningless to the overall plot. Charley Ford is just as complex as his brother Robert Ford or Jesse James. The cast is overall amazing and each person involved with this film puts on the performance of their career.As the story progresses things become more and more tense. It's important to note how Dominik handles a film where the ending is given away in the title. The movie isn't for everyone. The 2 hour and 40 minute running time may ward of some movie goers, but it's nothing to be intimidated by. I did see a few people walk out of the screening I went to, which always strikes me as rude no matter what you think of the film. Dominik handled this project very much in a way that Terrence Malick handled The Thin Red Line. The characters are more focused than in a Malick film, but the structure is very similar. This film is all about the characters, which is why we almost forget that Jesse James dies at the hand of Robert Ford in the end. Everything leads up to that moment, which as a scene by itself is breathtaking. I don't think I have trembled in my seat as much as I did with that scene; truly crafted by a masterful filmmaker.Creatively speaking the most important thing to note is Roger Deakins' absolutely stunning cinematography. I have never seen a more beautifully shot film in my entire life of watching movies. The colors and the lighting are just so phenomenal. The use of soft focus while contrasted with incredible deep focus shots blew me away. The most amazingly shot scene is definitely the train robbery at the beginning where everything is lit by lanterns and every light source glows with radiance. I am calling it now that this film will win Deakins an Oscar, because if it doesn't then I will lose considerable respect for the Academy. No one can deny the brilliance of the cinematography in this film and how it paints a deep layer of emotion for the story.Another creative marvel of the film is the haunting score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. The duo caught my attention with their gritty score to the Australian made western, The Proposition. Once I heard that they were doing this film it became even higher priority for me to see. The score is very interesting in that there isn't that much score in the nearly 3 hour film. There were three central themes they played throughout to basically create atmosphere and create transition points in the narrative; although their score during the assassination scene is the real reason why it's as brilliant as it is. It's a score that truly deserves people's attention and is worth owning when it's released.I was shaken by this film; it really got to me. The raw power of the visuals and the performances take the audience on a haunting character exploration of idolization and self dignity. This isn't a typical western of the genre and it really isn't a revisionist western either. It's unique and original and you will not forget this film. Casey Affleck, Brad Pitt and Sam Rockwell give the performances of their careers. Andrew Dominik's meticulous attention to detail and craftsmanship proves his capability of being a great filmmaker. Top it off with the genius photographic talents of Roger Deakins and the musical brilliance of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and you have one of the greatest films I have seen in my life. This is a masterpiece.",5,A Haunting Character Exploration Of Idolization And Self Diginity.

It does not in any way meander, and is not enslaved to the book, because the true theme of both is the passing of an era. Thus, the moody and nostalgic cinematography, thus the mournful and provocative music, and thus, especially, allowing us to see J. James and Bob Ford as more complex than legend has previously allowed. Jesse himself cracks before the pressures of his sins and fame even as he seeks revenge against his former saddle mates. Bob Ford just wants some acknowledgement from his idol, even as he is coming to realize the horrors that the recognition might mean. Truly, it is well said that this is not a ""typical"" western, but as with all great ""westerns,"" the story could be transplanted to a different setting and yet remain intact. I have not seen this thorough an exploration of a legendary act before. I believe the title is ironic. I felt this when reading the book, and I was sure of it after seeing the film. Watching the final reel again repeatedly, I find myself more profoundly moved than in other such ""tragic"" period pieces....""Song for Bob"" plays on the soundtrack, the voice-over narrator tells us before we see it of Bob's fate, and then the concluding lines, summarizing what Bob did NOT achieve in death compared to what Jesse did! A powerful summation of the price of fame (infamy?) and the seeking of it. It is possibly Brad Pitt's best performance ever, and Casey Affleck was simply born to play this role.

1125231,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0010DR4BO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","There is a point following the titular event in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" where Ford has to listen to somebody singing about the event and ""the dirty little Coward, who short down Mr. Howard.""  That James lived under the name of Thomas Howard during his retirement from being a robber compels history to use the appellation ""coward"" for Ford as much as the epitaph on his tomb, selected by his mother, which reads: ""In Loving Memory of my Beloved Son, Murdered by a Traitor and Coward Whose Name is not Worthy to Appear Here.""  After enduring several verses of disparagement, Ford fires off his gun, declares his identity and pointedly tells the troubadour that James had two children and not three.  In other words, get the story straight, buddy.Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (""Chopper""), based on the novel byRon Hansen, this 2007 western purports to set the story straight, but in the end I do not think this film means what it thinks it means.  In part because Brad Pitt is playing Jesse James, the outlaw comes across in this film as an iconic celebrity.  There are no rock stars in the 19th century, but there were the heroes of dime novels and the portrayal of James as a Robin Hood like figure has made him just a celebrity.  We know that from the train robbery that is the highlight of the film's opening act, that James is a vicious thug.  Ironically, it is the last robbery for the James gang, and Jesse and Frank (Sam Shepard) are going their separate ways.  Everybody else from their original gang is now dead or in prison, and that is why they are saddled with such third-rate men as the brothers Ford.It is easy to see Casey Affleck's Robert Ford as a wannabee.  That is clear to both Jesse, who wonders if this kid wants to be like him or actually be him, and Frank, who pointedly tells Robert that he lacks the ingredients.  But Robert has a catalogue of similarities that he sees between himself and Jesse, as one blue-eyed son of a preacher standing 5 feet 8 inches tall is just like another.  So this is a strong current through the film that Ford is basically the Mark David Chapman of the late 19th century, stalking his idol and killing him. However, the long middle part of this lengthy film, serves to develop a different thesis.  After the fact Ford's explanation for his dirty deed was that he killed Jesse James because Jesse was going to kill him, and that is the inevitable conclusion of the events laid out for us.  After all, Robert has killed Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Jesse's cousin, and as much as he promises to kill Jesse to get off for that crime, the murder also serves as motive for Jesse to kill Bob.  Besides, for even the barest whiff of potential betrayal, we see Jesse gun down somebody (shooting them in the back in an ironic foreshadowing of his own death).However, if Ford's motives for pulling the trigger are clearly motivated by what we see in this film, the same cannot be said for Jesse's actions in his final moments.  Jesse might be taking off his guns so that nobody sees him walking around the house fully armed or because he wants to put the Fords at ease, but when he takes the fateful steps to fix the picture on the wall he seems to be asking for Ford to shoot him.  Is Dominik suggesting James had a death wish?  Or is this just an eerie foreshadowing of the future, where the Fords act out the assignation on the stage, with Charlie (Sam Rockwell) playing Jesse?  This film, narrated by Hugh Ross, begins knowing the ending because the audience hardly needs the title to know what happened on April 3, 1882, and there is a profound sense of inevitability if not outright destiny to the events we see being played out here.  If not for Javier Bardem, Affleck would be looking forward to winning the Oscar for his performance, which is only technically a supporting role because he is the main character here.  The other Oscar nomination is for the cinematography of Robert Deakins, who is also nominated for similar fine work on ""No Country for Old Men"" (with ""In the Valley of Elah"" sandwiched in between those two films on his resume for last year).",4,Reconsidering why the dirty little coward shot down Mr. Howard,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,4159,"['point', 'following', 'titular', 'event', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'where', 'Ford', 'listen', 'somebody', 'singing', 'event', 'dirty', 'little', 'Coward', 'who', 'short', 'down', 'Mr', 'Howard', 'James', 'lived', 'name', 'Thomas', 'Howard', 'retirement', 'being', 'robber', 'compels', 'history', 'use', 'appellation', 'coward', 'Ford', 'as', 'much', 'epitaph', 'tomb', 'selected', 'mother', 'Loving', 'Memory', 'Beloved', 'Son', 'Murdered', 'Traitor', 'Coward', 'Whose', 'Name', 'not', 'Worthy', 'Appear', 'Here', 'enduring', 'several', 'verses', 'disparagement', 'Ford', 'gun', 'identity', 'pointedly', 'troubadour', 'James', 'had', 'two', 'children', 'not', 'three', 'other', 'words', 'get', 'story', 'straight', 'buddy.Written', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'Chopper', 'based', 'novel', 'byRon', 'Hansen', '2007', 'western', 'purports', 'set', 'story', 'straight', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'what', 'part', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'James', 'outlaw', 'film', 'iconic', 'celebrity', 'are', 'rock', 'stars', '19th', 'century', 'were', 'heroes', 'dime', 'novels', 'portrayal', 'James', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'figure', 'made', 'just', 'celebrity', 'know', 'train', 'robbery', 'highlight', 'film', 'opening', 'act', 'James', 'vicious', 'thug', 'Ironically', 'last', 'robbery', 'James', 'gang', 'Jesse', 'Frank', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'are', 'going', 'separate', 'ways', 'Everybody', 'else', 'original', 'gang', 'now', 'dead', 'prison', 'why', 'are', 'saddled', 'such', 'third-rate', 'men', 'brothers', 'Ford.It', 'easy', 'see', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'wannabee', 'clear', 'Jesse', 'who', 'kid', 'be', 'actually', 'be', 'Frank', 'who', 'pointedly', 'Robert', 'ingredients', 'Robert', 'catalogue', 'similarities', 'Jesse', 'one', 'blue-eyed', 'son', 'preacher', 'standing', '5', 'feet', '8', 'inches', 'tall', 'just', 'strong', 'current', 'film', 'Ford', 'basically', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'stalking', 'idol', 'killing', 'However', 'long', 'middle', 'part', 'lengthy', 'film', 'develop', 'different', 'thesis', 'fact', 'Ford', 'explanation', 'dirty', 'deed', 'was', 'killed', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Jesse', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'events', 'laid', 'out', 'Robert', 'killed', 'Wood', 'Hite', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Jesse', 'cousin', 'as', 'much', 'kill', 'Jesse', 'get', 'off', 'crime', 'murder', 'also', 'motive', 'Jesse', 'kill', 'Bob', 'Besides', 'even', 'barest', 'whiff', 'potential', 'betrayal', 'see', 'Jesse', 'gun', 'down', 'somebody', 'shooting', 'back', 'ironic', 'foreshadowing', 'own', 'death', '.However', 'Ford', 'motives', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'are', 'clearly', 'motivated', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Jesse', 'actions', 'final', 'moments', 'Jesse', 'might', 'be', 'taking', 'off', 'guns', 'so', 'nobody', 'walking', 'house', 'fully', 'armed', 'put', 'Fords', 'ease', 'when', 'fateful', 'steps', 'fix', 'picture', 'wall', 'be', 'asking', 'Ford', 'shoot', 'Dominik', 'suggesting', 'James', 'had', 'death', 'wish', 'just', 'eerie', 'foreshadowing', 'future', 'where', 'Fords', 'act', 'assignation', 'stage', 'Charlie', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'film', 'narrated', 'Hugh', 'Ross', 'knowing', 'ending', 'audience', 'hardly', 'title', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'April', '3', '1882', 'profound', 'sense', 'inevitability', 'not', 'outright', 'destiny', 'events', 'see', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'not', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Affleck', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'only', 'technically', 'supporting', 'role', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'other', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Deakins', 'who', 'also', 'nominated', 'similar', 'fine', 'work', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Valley', 'Elah', 'sandwiched', 'two', 'films', 'resume', 'last', 'year']",N/A
1125232,A163N66ALZDACR,B0010DR4BO,LBloom,"[3, 4]","This enjoyable movie chronicles the last days of the famous outlaw and the of his assassin, Robert Ford. There are great performances here from everyone but especially Brad Pitt. The movie is narrated in some places filling us in on Jesse's frame of mind and other details as we get to the final scene of the ""dirty little coward that shot Mr Howard"". We are given some background on the Bob and Charley Ford as well as events that happened to them after killing of Jesse James. The Ford brothers reenact the assassination in a stage production that has Bob Ford finding out the hard way that many regarded him as a coward rather than hero. Eventually, Charley Ford in bout of guilt shot himself and Bob himself would be assassinated by someone wanting to avenge Jesse James.This is a rather moddy piece, beginning after most of the original gang were dead or in prison. While other movies on the same subject were more action this is more dramatic than some biographies of the James Gang but still contains a few action sequences. Mostly this is concentrating, as the title implies on Bob Ford growing desire to be a hero and finding the courage to do the deed and Jesse's growing suspicions that someone in his camp might be disloyal.If you're looking for a biography or action-packed western then look elsewhere.

1125233,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0010DR4BO,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","The movie has a very long title.  Interestingly enough, the screenplay's copyright is held by Warner Bros.  This corporate screenplay was directed by New Zealander Andrew Dominik.  The Australian Film Institute gave him a Best Achievement in Directing award forChopper.  If you read the title, you know what happens in the film; so Domink tries to make it interesting to watch HOW it unfolds.  We get some of the flashback of the last James Gang robbery in Blue Cut, Missouri.  The film comments on how powerful a figure Jesse James was -- just in case Brad Pitt wasn't able to communicate that.  Pitt actually won a Golden Globe in 1995 for12 Monkeys (Special Edition).  He does a good job showing the instability & charisma of James.  However, the hints and lack of explanation of the seeming attraction that James held for Robert Ford gave much of the movie its tension.Casey Affleck's breakthrough performance as Ford earned him nominations for an Oscar, SAG award, Golden Globe, and from film societies in Chicago, Detroit, Toronto & Utah.  He won awards from the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics, the San Francisco Film Critics Circle & St. Louis Gateway Film Critics.  His quick smile and darting eyes bounced uncertainly from seeking approval to chronic worry.Supporting performances are also of note.  Sam Shepard was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar forThe Right Stuffin 1983.  As Frank James, his one note is a strong one, the silent thoughtful brother.  Mary Louise Parker won an Emmy in 2004 for ""Angels in America"" and two Golden Globes for cable TV's ""Weeds.""  As Jesse's wife Zee, she gives presence to a role that only takes the camera by storm during the bloody climax.  Sam Rockwell won a Best Actor award from the Montreal World Film Festival for one of my favorite films,Lawn Dogs, as well as a strong role in ""The Green Mile.""  As Robert Ford's brother Charley, he plays the slow-witted but likeable guy who decides blood commands the greatest loyalty.  Jeremy Renner who was inNorth Country (Widescreen Edition)does an excellent job as Wood Hite whose bare body gets dumped in a snow bank after itchy trigger fingers splinter the gang.  Paul Schneider who had an excellent role inLars and the Real Girldoes a good job as the unstable silver-tongued gang member Dick Liddle who winds up hiding in a storage space.  Garret Dillahunt whose good looks were trashed for this film plays the frightened liar Ed Miller who goes on a midnight ride with Jesse, never to return.  Dillahunt had previously worked on cable TV's ""The 4400"" & inNo Country for Old Men.While the pacing is slow, I suppose it's expected when we already know the climax.  The San Francisco Film Critic gave this a Best Picture Award.  Roger Deakins won cinematography awards from the Chicago Film Critics & the Dallas/Fort Worth Film Critics.  The film is visually stunning.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  I did watch about a third of it in French after watching the English, which was interesting.  There are no extra features here; so it is a minimalist package on DVD worth an evening's viewing.

They rely on fast-paced action and taut suspense to weave a compelling tale.""The Assassination of Jesse James"" is more along the lines of ""There Will Be Blood"" in that it's a lengthy, intellectual film with electrifying performances by Brad Pitt and Daniel Day-Lewis, respectively.My point is that to compare any of the previous films to ""Jesse James"" or ""Blood"" would be akin to (excuse the cliche) comparing apples and oranges.With that in mind, I'll personally take ""Jesse James"" over ""Blood"" anyday. It's beautifully shot, wonderfully scripted, and takes a more realistic approach to the last days of the outlaw's life.Judging from a good deal of the negative reviews here, it appears the majority of audiences would prefer a testosterone-fueled mad-cap action romp in the style ofThe Long Ridersrather than a thoughtful, deeper interpretation of Jesse James.That's not surprising, considering audiences can't get enough of Michael Bay films or uninspired Johnny Depp star vehicles - yet ask anyone on the streets about Robert Bresson or Ingmar Bergman and they are likely to ask ""Who??""Still, the one misconception I'd like to dispell about ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" is that it is ""slow paced"" or ""too long"". Though the film is right at three hours, I found the film to be resolutely paced and I wouldn't have deleted a single scene.

Ford also is known as a coward who is easily antsy compared to James' psychopathic charismatic coolness.

Ross,"[1, 2]","Others have already written in-depth reviews so it's not only been done but I'm not interested in doing that as much as I just want to say that this film proves {again} what a BRILLIANT FREAKING ACTOR Brad Pitt is.  Actually the entire cast was well-chosen, extremely well-chosen. Brad totally owned the movie though, of course. He truly became someone else here, and that was Jesse James.  One of my favorite parts was the extremely tense and very finely tuned scene where he arrives at a friend's house and the guy is sure Jesse is there to kill him. When things start to get really paranoid is a truly amazing bit of acting {I have rewound that part over and over}. What the two actors do is create the absolute scariest tension between themselves with only their facial expressions and their voices/attitudes. It is all very subtle. It is a sort of ""what is not being said"" paranoia. Brad acts like a carnivore sniffing out it's prey and it's truly riveting. The guy he was zoning in on was excellent too.I thought the entire film was beautifully done, except the scene in the barn when they rough up that kid. In reality that scene was part of the real history of Jesse James except they changed it around...in real life Jesse James was beaten up by some militia as a boy. But in the film he is the one who gets carried away and then gets upset with it afterward {was he supposed to be re-living that memory of his own attack ?}. The movie doesn't make it clear why he first goes overboard and beats up on a kid,then gets upset but it must have been put in the film to refer to what actually happened to Jesse when he was a youth. I just wish they'd stuck more to reality, it would have given people more insight into what probably contributed to make Jesse such a tough person because I read that the assault he received affected him a lot.

Watching this with near-zero expectations, I was at first intrigued and then blown away by the sheer mastery the director had over his subjects. And the cinematography! Rarely has a Western won so much universal acclaim, and the only downside to this gem is that it takes a while to get into things, and the slow pace may not win it any new viewers. Still, if you persevere, you will be rewarded with a rich and darkly textured real-life story that is gripping, and most importantly, rewatchable.When I buy a DVD, I need to know that I will watch it again. This is perhaps my first criterion when I choose something to purchase. How many discs do you have in your collection that you paid full retail for, but then never cared to watch again? Exactly. I bought this with the same `impulse purchase' mentality that fuels so many of our ridiculous shopping decisions, but at least I had based it on some really good reviews I'd read (Roger Ebert's was the one that swayed me the most). What a great investment. This film has zoomed to my list of Top 10 Greatest Films of all Time, and I can't think of a single film since ""Mulholland Drive"" this decade that I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored.Bradley Pitt turns in a career-defining performance, but it is difficult again here to separate the man from the character. Jesse James is supposed to be 34 years old (the film chronicles his final year of life before being shot in the back by Bob Ford). If you do your research, you'll find that the real Jesse James was, like Pitt, a rare specimen of human beauty (which also no doubt helped him become an ever bigger legend), but its impossible for a second to buy Pitt as a man in his early thirties (he looks his age in this film, which is about 45). Casey Affleck, who in real life is around 33, plays a 19 year old. The discrepancy in the age of the characters versus the actual actors really shows - but if you can get past this minor quibble, it all works.The greatest thing about this film is the cinematography. Never has a Western looked this gorgeous. Forget the brilliance of ""Unforgiven"" or even those bleak shots in ""Brokeback Mountain"". This film soars far above those classics and rewrites the rules for the way a Western should look. Take it from me. I am no fan of the genre, but this film turned me around. In part its because it doesn't work as a straight-out Western, and is more character driven, and the dialog is certainly `set in the times'.It's a pity that this perfect example of superb film-making will never get a huge audience. At the very least it deserves to be a cult classic (which I believe it is). Its also a film to OWN and not rent. If at all you are reading this review to make a purchasing decision, then I urge you to order this right away. Finally a film worth the hype.Five Stars.

Nothing interesting, just brad pitt in a rocking chair, no guns blazing, nothing that you typically find entertaining in a western.So recently I came across this movie again and decided to finish watching it.  Boy what a mistakeI thought possibly this movie was worth watching, but I dare anyone to go back and watch this movie pass the half hour mark.In terms of &#34;film&#34; criticism, I would say this movie is at best an exercise in minimalist directing, acting and movement.  There are themes of heroism vs cowardice, living on the plains and violence as a means of power and to gain in life.  But to often, the rhythm of the movie is brought to standstill as the camera will pay attention to a character, let their a emotions play out and then keep going on and on.After about an hour you can see how the movie is going to be, basic dialogue while we see how characters would have &#34;fealt&#34; or &#34;reacted&#34; in 1850s-1860s america.  There are many wide shots of the landscape, but you never see anything outside the day to day lives of jesse and his few close accomplices.  The fact that it is labeled a &#34;western&#34; doesn't help because that still that does not describe this vague and abstract movie.  Audience goers will assume there will be an entertaining draw to this movie, if not the guns and shootings of 3:10 to yuma, then at least they assumed there would be a quicker, more entertaining story revolving around brad pitt and showing the audience why jesse james who he was or why we remember him.The movie is more about the the relationship and admiration of robert ford towards jesse james and the eventual shooting.  Its 2 hours and 39 minutes long, but it felt like 6 hours spread out over 5 years(I watched this movie in two different sittings, I suggest you do something similar if you intend to watch it).I suggest the best way to watch this movie is to get some food, rent this movie, rent some other movies you like that might be more entertaining, start watching this movie and then after 20 minutes, you have some other movies to watch when you get tired of it and then you'll really appreciate more entertaining movies.",2,If you've ever wanted to know what being sucked into a blackhole feels like...,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,2568,"['have', 'never', 'ever', 'been', 'compelled', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'amazon', 'movie', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'life', 'such', 'way', 'needed', 'get', 'here', 'share', 'experience.When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'remember', 'being', 'friends', 'house', 'starting', 'watch', 'friend', 'turning', 'off', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'boring', 'Nothing', 'interesting', 'just', 'brad', 'pitt', 'rocking', 'chair', 'guns', 'blazing', 'nothing', 'typically', 'find', 'entertaining', 'western.So', 'recently', 'came', 'movie', 'again', 'decided', 'finish', 'watching', 'Boy', 'what', 'mistakeI', 'thought', 'possibly', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'dare', 'anyone', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'half', 'hour', 'mark.In', 'terms', '34', 'film', '34', 'criticism', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'best', 'exercise', 'minimalist', 'directing', 'acting', 'movement', 'are', 'themes', 'heroism', 'vs', 'cowardice', 'living', 'plains', 'violence', 'means', 'power', 'gain', 'life', 'often', 'rhythm', 'movie', 'brought', 'standstill', 'camera', 'will', 'pay', 'attention', 'character', 'let', 'emotions', 'play', 'out', 'then', 'keep', 'going', 'on.After', 'hour', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'basic', 'dialogue', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'would', 'have', '34', 'fealt', '34', '34', 'reacted', '34', '1850s-1860s', 'america', 'are', 'many', 'wide', 'shots', 'landscape', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'day', 'day', 'lives', 'jesse', 'few', 'close', 'accomplices', 'fact', 'labeled', '34', 'western', '34', ""n't"", 'help', 'still', 'not', 'describe', 'vague', 'abstract', 'movie', 'Audience', 'goers', 'will', 'assume', 'will', 'be', 'entertaining', 'draw', 'movie', 'not', 'guns', 'shootings', '3:10', 'yuma', 'then', 'least', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'quicker', 'more', 'entertaining', 'story', 'revolving', 'brad', 'pitt', 'showing', 'audience', 'why', 'jesse', 'james', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'remember', 'him.The', 'movie', 'more', 'relationship', 'admiration', 'robert', 'ford', 'towards', 'jesse', 'james', 'eventual', 'shooting', '2', 'hours', '39', 'minutes', 'long', 'felt', '6', 'hours', 'spread', 'out', '5', 'years', 'watched', 'movie', 'two', 'different', 'sittings', 'suggest', 'do', 'something', 'similar', 'intend', 'watch', 'suggest', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'food', 'rent', 'movie', 'rent', 'other', 'movies', 'like', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'then', '20', 'minutes', 'have', 'other', 'movies', 'watch', 'when', 'get', 'tired', 'then', ""'ll"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movies']",N/A

It makes me wish they'd offer a ""director's cut"" with most of the narration removed, though.

As Jesse James (Brad Pitt) turns 34 years old, there is little left of the infamous James-Younger Gang, but Jesse still has an appetite for guns and larceny. He welcomes ambitious young gunslinger Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) into his gang, keeping him and older brother Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell) close as his fear of capture intensifies. But Jesse has misunderstood Bob, whose desire for fame and fortune has found other means.This is interesting material, but director/screenwriter Andrew Dominik has made such a self-conscious and long production of it that credibility and the audience's attention fall by the wayside. The film plods along for 2  hours comprised largely of awkward conversations and pregnant pauses, as if the characters interact in slow motion. An oddly affected omniscient narrator fills us in on the story. The narration is literary, obviously taken from the book, but ill-suited to cinema. Although the major events of this film are factual, none of Jesse's behavior is believable as presented. Granted, the western is a classic allegorical form, not historical, but this dialogue is absurd, and actions seem arbitrary.The film's focus meanders, but its thrust is a character study of ""the coward Robert Ford"". The questions of why Bob murdered his boyhood hero and how it shaped his public and self-image are good ones. But Bob's character is drowned in neuroses, and the reasons his feelings toward Jesse changed are unclear. Casey Affleck may deserve his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Bob Ford, but his creation, however remarkable, is out of place and time in this scenario.

Is it a masterpiece for being slow and long winded. Is it well acted for being underplayed and underscored.Im not sure anymore. All I know is that this film never caught my attention, and I had little motivation for involving myself in the experience. Jesse James was an important man, or so the narrator insists. People around him were terrified of him, or so the script would imply. There is simply too much self worth.An exploration of characters is just that. But I feel this very long winded exploration yielded very little. A man is dead and the killer has his regrets...The acting is sound, but I dont let myself be fooled by the manipulation of the musical score (or more so its lack of it) during tense moments that help underplay the dialogue between characters... and hence materialize dense moments.

Brad Pitt turns in a stellar performance as legendary outlaw Jesse James that makes us remember the guy is a great actor who, more often than not, gets labeled as tabloid fodder.  The film follows his road to retirement with his gang in tow, including Bob Ford (Casey Affleck in a star making, Oscar nominated turn) who idolizes James beyond belief.  Directed by Andrew Dominick (Chopper), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a long, slow moving, and often beautiful take on an important part in the history of the west, but let it be known that there are times when the film borderlines on the pretentious, and it is definitely not for all tastes.  It's not a crowd pleaser like 3:10 to Yuma, and at times can be even hard to watch, but make no mistake that the film stays with you after the credits roll.

If you ask me to name my 100 favorite movies, Silverado and Dances with Wolves might come in somewhere around 95.  I thought Eastwood's Unforgiven (released in 1992) was a dark, and crappy rehash of Pretty Woman (released in 1990), and I laughed out loud whenever listening to the contrived dialogues of Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns.So watching this movie was a pleasant surprise.  Brad Pitt has a hobby of picking doomed characters to play; but he always does an incredible job, as exemplified in this movie.  Pitt plays Jesse James, the passive-aggressive anti-hero who wants to trust those around him, but whose actions only create distrust.  Casey Affleck plays Robert Ford, the youngest of a large brood who never amounts to much in his life until he joins the James gang.  About half the screentime revolves around their relationship, with the rest of the time playing out the tragedy that is the life of crime, vengeance and violence.For a Western movie, there is very little violence, maybe about 10 minutes in all out of over 2.5 hours of running time.  The rest is in dialogue, showing the audience what goes thru the minds of men who cannot really trust each other with their most important possesions - their lives.  So in a way, this is not really a Western movie, it is more of a crime drama; an 19th century American midwest version of the Godfather.

You couldn't even understand what they were saying as they all mumbled on and on.The music...well...there was no music (except for the noise of someone trying in desperation to tune a cello).The camera work was even ridiculous (blurring the left and right of the screen to give the appearance of an old photograph out of focus).And as if all that were not bad enough...no story...no character definition, let alone development...no plot...no explanation about anything (whatever happened to Frank James?)...if ALL that wasn't enough...they stuck that seething sociopathic commie James Carville in as governor.

Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[16, 19]","'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is about the last few months in the life of the infamous American outlaw, and how it is intertwined with his eventual assassin, Robert Ford. This is one of those films where you know exactly how it's going to end, and yet are drawn in and compelled anyway. Firstly, the film IS long. It's two hours and forty minutes, and it's slow, drawn out pace makes you feel it. I'm not sure if a healthy edit would have benefitted the film, but I'm quite sure it would have made it more appealing to some would-be movie-goers. As it stands, I would not recommend it those who are very impatient.That being said, I thought it was an overall good film. Some of the dialogue is a bit peculiar, but it does well as a good drama and character study, and it is even quite hilarious at times. Visually, the film is beautiful, and the haunting, poignant score is phenomenal. Pitt does well as the personable, complex, and brutal Jesse James. I can't speak on how accurate this rendition is, but Pitt's James is portrayed as a man who acts viciously in the heat of the moment, only to break down in tears (after one incident) in regret. He is at once a loving family man, and someone who wouldn't hesitate to gun you down if he even thought you were thinking about crossing him. This is also a Jesse James toward the end of his career, who is increasingly paranoid, depressed, and regretful, and this makes his actions toward the end of the film that much more tragic and compelling.I thought the real star of the show was Casey Affleck as Bob Ford though. He brilliantly conveys the complex, emotional personality of the 19 year old idolizer of Jesse James. The way he portrays the gushing and blushing kid in the presence of his idol felt so real, and reminded me of how a contemporary teenager might act with his favorite athelete or movie star. The labeling of Ford as a ""coward"" is a bit of a misnomer though. He was naive, sensitive, and anxious, but he did not lack courage. In the end, he did betray Jesse James, so traitorous might be an accurate description, but he was only labeled as a coward long after the fact because of a resurgence in Jesse James hysteria. Well that, and he did shoot James in the back, but the fact is, he was lauded as a hero for some time, for killing the man who caused so much terror. In any case, Bob Ford is a truly tragic figure, and I also appreciated how the film showed his life after the assassination. I also think one of the more subtle themes is that of the perverseness of American society. There is a certain tragic irony about the idolization of Jesse James, and the demonization of his killer, Bob Ford. So overall, I would say this is a good, intelligent film about a compelling piece of American history.

i wasn't familiar with his writing before i saw this movie, but i dragged a friend of mine, kind of quietly kicking and screaming, to watch the DVD with me (She was dreading it because it's about Jesse James), and She became a good bit more optimistic when She saw it was based on his book (she's a literary critic for numerous newspapers and websites and a great admirer of Ron Hansen's work), and she wound up thoroughly impressed with every aspect of the film (as i knew she would). i said i'd like to read the book; she told me i should and bought me a copy, and i found that almost every line uttered in the film was taken directly, lovingly, word-for-word, from Hansen's remarkable prose - to the point that lines i didn't quite catch in the movie - despite my having watched it about ten times - were made clear to me. clearly this movie was made by devoted admirers of Ron Hansen's work, and it was made painstakingly and with unfathomable love. everything - *everything* - is perfect: the cinematography (in which Ridley Scott had a hand), the gorgeous, moody music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and the masterful delivery of every single line by each magnificent actor (Casey Affleck not least of all).i saw somebody calling this movie ""muddled"" and saying they couldn't follow it;

1125272,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B0010DR4BO,Poor Napoleon,"[4, 7]","Those who have said this film is too slow were probably expecting an action packed western about that much fabled life of Jesse James.  Those who are willing to stick it out and in the mood to watch actors seep gently into the skin of the characters are in for a ride.  And while this film does have a good share of action and tension, don't expect it to fill up 160 minute running time.This is a film about the hero worship of Jesse James by Robert Ford.  He is a young man who kind of worships Jesse James from afar, but proably behaves more like a rock n' roll groupie.  As Jesse James may have been seen as a rebel rock star in his day, the role is fitting.  Casey Affleck plays a nervous Ford.  When he approaches James and his gang, he has such a timid demeanor, like a child meeting his hero for the first time.  Affleck proves himself a promising actor as he talks to James for the first time, from his nervous expressions and gestures to his uneasy speech, he captures the very essence of Robert Ford.As Jesse James, Brad Pitt doesn't say much.  He doesn't need to.  This is Jesse James late in his career, when he's probably said most of what he's needed to say.  That doesn't mean he doesn't create tension on screen.  As we build up to James' inevitable death, James starts staking out people he doesn't trust.  Each of these scenes is cinematic gold, with Pitt in fine form.The film also makes a fine statement about how history views these figures.  In James, the film remarks about how much of James' Robin Hood-like antics are fabled, but doesn't spend any time exposing him either.  The focus is more on Ford, and how people viewed his, well, ""cowardly"" act.  It's neither judgemental or sympathetic towards Robert.  Rather, it presents a historical snapshot of him.The production on this film is fantastic.  From the brilliant cinematography Roger Deakens to the subtle score from Nick Cave, there is hardly a misstep in the film.  My one complaint is that there is an unneccesary narration sporadically placed throughout the film, as if we, the viewers, can't figure out what's happening.  It's not in the film too much, but is a minor annoyance.As for the DVD release, there are absolutely no extras on the DVD.

1125273,AIRHRV3D8X4J1,B0010DR4BO,"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina""","[3, 6]","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a haunting movie about the famous outlaw Jesse James. Robert Ford (aka Bob) and his two brothers join Jesse for his final robbery.  Robert (aka Bob) seems to be infatuated with Jesse James beyond the point of just idolizing him. Seeing how obsessed he is with Jesse by the memorabilia he has collected on Jesse throughout the years just gives you the creeps on how crazy this guy really is.  He wants to do everything he can to be accepted by Jesse James, but Jesse is not one to easily trust anyone. The film does start out a bit slow, but as the story unfolds and I learned more about the characters I actually started to enjoy the film. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances since Fight Club, however it is Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's little brother) who steals the movie with his portrayal of Robert Ford. It is no surprise that Casey Affleck's has now been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination at this years Academy Awards. His portrayal of Robert Ford as an insecure man that wants to live vicariously through Jesse James leaves you absolutely amazed at the talent this guy has. This is not your typical western, and not a film everyone will enjoy but it really is a good movie. What really made this movie shine was the incredible acting from Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck which more than made up for the movie being a little on the lackluster side. This is one of those movies that I actually appreciated more after I saw the whole thing then while I was watching it. The cathartic journey it takes you on can not really be appreciated until the film is over. The cinematography is also very beautiful and goes very well with the haunting undertones of the film.  I do have to admit for this movie being a high def blu-ray I did expect a better picture, along with better sound options and more bonus material. Because of the less than stellar blu-ray picture and sound I will have to give this a 4 star review based mostly on the amazing talent and great story of this film.",4,"Great movie thanks to the acting, but a less than stellar blu-ray release",1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2063,"['Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'haunting', 'movie', 'famous', 'outlaw', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Bob', 'two', 'brothers', 'join', 'Jesse', 'final', 'robbery', 'Robert', 'Bob', 'be', 'infatuated', 'Jesse', 'James', 'point', 'just', 'idolizing', 'Seeing', 'how', 'obsessed', 'Jesse', 'memorabilia', 'collected', 'Jesse', 'years', 'just', 'creeps', 'how', 'crazy', 'guy', 'really', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'accepted', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Jesse', 'not', 'one', 'easily', 'trust', 'anyone', 'film', 'start', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'story', 'unfolds', 'learned', 'more', 'characters', 'actually', 'started', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Fight', 'Club', 'however', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'surprise', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'now', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'years', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'insecure', 'man', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Jesse', 'James', 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'talent', 'guy', 'not', 'typical', 'western', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'shine', 'was', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'movie', 'being', 'little', 'lackluster', 'side', 'one', 'movies', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'more', 'saw', 'whole', 'thing', 'then', 'was', 'watching', 'cathartic', 'journey', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'appreciated', 'film', 'cinematography', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'very', 'well', 'haunting', 'undertones', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'being', 'high', 'def', 'blu-ray', 'did', 'expect', 'better', 'picture', 'better', 'sound', 'options', 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'less', 'stellar', 'blu-ray', 'picture', 'sound', 'will', 'have', 'give', '4', 'star', 'review', 'based', 'mostly', 'amazing', 'talent', 'great', 'story', 'film']",N/A

Artfully exciting and compulsively watchable even at a butt-numbing 152 minutes, the film makes good on the promise.&#34; Peter TraversAfter viewing this film, I sat for minutes, mind numb, recalling what I had just seen. A remarkable film, too remarkable to call a western, its genre is one I can't quite find a name for. From the title of the film we understand the story and the score. But halfway in we are so admiring of Brad Pitt as Jesse James, aka Tom Howard, that we want to believe that the title is a misnomer. Brad Pitt plays this role as it was meant to be focused, ruthless, intelligent, psycopathic and brilliant. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford has won my admiration. He is a true thespian. No acting was evident here, it was the real man. Sam Shepard plays Jesse's brother, Frank as imaginatively as possible. Mary Louise Parker as Jesse's wife leaves us with a haunting feel for her man. And James Carville, in his 1800's white tie and tuxedo, as the Governor is quite remarkable. Each and every role should be praised.In 1881, Jesse and Frank James career of crime comes to a parting of the ways. As the film progresses the entire gang falls apart one way or another. As the filmn unfolds we know what the ending will be, but I was not prepared at all for the scene as it came to be. The scenes following were so profound and deadly that as I said I sat stunned for a few minutes recalling what I had just seen. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The stark, white cold winter of Missouri blends in with the stark and sparseness of the film and the characters. I could not find one item that I disagreed with in this film- remarkable, just remarkable.&#34;Jesse James wasn't just a good shot -- he was a skilled strategist who merged greed and talent to become one of the most notorious gunmen in history. People looking for a traditional Western and exciting gunplay will be sorely disappointed, but those with patience and an eye for character study will be enthralled by the results. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is a remarkable film, one that I'll revisit again and again.&#34; Kenneth BrownWith the addition of Nick Cave's melancholy music that is at once profound and moving this is a film for everyone. Nick Cave shows up in the film singing 'The Ballad of Jesse James' and it is the right touch at the right time.

1125276,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B0010DR4BO,Publius,"[3, 5]","As John Wilkes Booth was being hunted down after shooting Lincoln, he wrote in his diary: ""And yet I, for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew, am looked upon as a common cutthroat.""  Such is the fate of assassins from Brutus to Mark David Chapman.  This fate also befell Robert Ford, the killer of Jesse James, and is the subject of this incredible film.  As for James himself, who better then Brad Pitt, who seems to play some of the most impenetrable roles in recent memory to portray one of America's most unknowable outlaws.  And Ford, who expecting to be greeted as a hero, became instead the `dirty little coward' of countless ballads and folklore.This film covers the travails of the James gang, and how Robert Ford parasitically weaseled his way into the group, eventually resulting in the betrayal.  Like a washed out, has-been entertainer, Pitt's Jesse James knows that him and his gang has seen better days.  Frank and Jesse both know that the era of train and bank robberies, like the Old West are coming to a close, but nevertheless in 1879, when the movie opens, the James gang has still attracted a motley collection of rag-tag `sidekicks' and common thieves who idolize Jesse.  Eventually, as civilization, the Pinkertons and the authorities close in around him, James is forced to move his family again and again to avoid detection.  Ford eventually kills James, after having to confront Jesse's ever more dangerous paranoia and for the hope of an eventual reward.  Even after Ford does the deed, therefore achieving the sort of notoriety that he covets, he is still maligned, mocked and laughed at wherever he wanders.  As Ford sees himself becoming one of the greatest villains in American history right before his very eyes, he thinks of assuaging his guilt by visiting the victims of Jesse's depredations.  He cannot bring himself to do this. At the end of the film when Ford is asked `why' he can only unconvincingly say that Jesse was going to kill him.  Perhaps Ford gets closer to the truth of the culmination of his celebrity worship by saying ""I expected some applause"" as if what he was doing was not real, but only a fantasy that he had been dreaming of from the time he met Jesse.  Affleck brings this psychosis to the screen with probably the best role of his career to date.That the murder happened during Holy Week, as mentioned in the film, only serves to emphasize the religious overtones of our collective American consciousness as told through our folklore.  What this film gets right is that our unique American individuality is thus seen in the character Jesse James, and his murder marked an ending point in our history.  Robert Ford then became the essence of the new corporate, capitalist, and  back-stabbing America of the sweatshops, factories, offices and mills that has defined America since then.  Many scenes in the film are seen through blurry edgy frames as if the viewer was looking into a stereoscopic image at Barnum's museum of a lost age.  A viewer should not expect a traditional western, but instead an artistic and brooding film that does not concern itself with gun fights or action, but rather with incredible cinematography, visuals and character acting.",5,I Expected Applause,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,3230,"['John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'was', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'shooting', 'Lincoln', 'wrote', 'diary', 'yet', 'striking', 'down', 'greater', 'tyrant', 'ever', 'knew', 'am', 'looked', 'common', 'cutthroat', 'Such', 'fate', 'assassins', 'Brutus', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'fate', 'also', 'befell', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'killer', 'Jesse', 'James', 'subject', 'incredible', 'film', 'James', 'who', 'better', 'then', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'play', 'most', 'impenetrable', 'roles', 'recent', 'memory', 'portray', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'unknowable', 'outlaws', 'Ford', 'who', 'expecting', 'be', 'greeted', 'hero', 'became', 'instead', 'dirty', 'little', 'coward', 'countless', 'ballads', 'folklore.This', 'film', 'travails', 'James', 'gang', 'how', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'parasitically', 'weaseled', 'way', 'group', 'eventually', 'resulting', 'betrayal', 'washed', 'out', 'has-been', 'entertainer', 'Pitt', 'Jesse', 'James', 'gang', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'know', 'era', 'train', 'bank', 'robberies', 'Old', 'West', 'are', 'coming', 'close', 'nevertheless', '1879', 'when', 'movie', 'James', 'gang', 'still', 'attracted', 'motley', 'collection', 'rag-tag', 'sidekicks', 'common', 'thieves', 'who', 'idolize', 'Jesse', 'Eventually', 'civilization', 'Pinkertons', 'authorities', 'close', 'James', 'forced', 'move', 'family', 'again', 'again', 'avoid', 'detection', 'Ford', 'eventually', 'James', 'having', 'confront', 'Jesse', 'ever', 'more', 'dangerous', 'paranoia', 'hope', 'eventual', 'reward', 'Even', 'Ford', 'deed', 'therefore', 'achieving', 'sort', 'notoriety', 'still', 'maligned', 'mocked', 'laughed', 'wherever', 'Ford', 'becoming', 'one', 'greatest', 'villains', 'American', 'history', 'right', 'very', 'eyes', 'assuaging', 'guilt', 'visiting', 'victims', 'Jesse', 'depredations', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'do', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Ford', 'asked', 'why', 'can', 'only', 'unconvincingly', 'say', 'Jesse', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'Perhaps', 'Ford', 'closer', 'truth', 'culmination', 'celebrity', 'worship', 'saying', 'expected', 'applause', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'only', 'fantasy', 'had', 'been', 'dreaming', 'time', 'met', 'Jesse', 'Affleck', 'psychosis', 'screen', 'probably', 'best', 'role', 'career', 'date.That', 'murder', 'happened', 'Holy', 'Week', 'mentioned', 'film', 'only', 'emphasize', 'religious', 'overtones', 'collective', 'American', 'consciousness', 'told', 'folklore', 'What', 'film', 'right', 'unique', 'American', 'individuality', 'thus', 'seen', 'character', 'Jesse', 'James', 'murder', 'marked', 'ending', 'point', 'history', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'then', 'became', 'essence', 'new', 'corporate', 'capitalist', 'back-stabbing', 'America', 'sweatshops', 'factories', 'offices', 'mills', 'defined', 'America', 'then', 'Many', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'seen', 'blurry', 'edgy', 'frames', 'viewer', 'was', 'looking', 'stereoscopic', 'image', 'Barnum', 'museum', 'lost', 'age', 'viewer', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'traditional', 'western', 'instead', 'artistic', 'brooding', 'film', 'not', 'concern', 'gun', 'fights', 'action', 'rather', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'visuals', 'character', 'acting']",N/A
1125277,A2C3P362BXV4XM,B0010DR4BO,Raiden777,"[3, 6]","Seeing the preview for this film, i had a hunch it was going to be more so a  deep drama than a ""root'n toot'n"" gun slinger. The films trailer evokes a sense of magic to this story.Anyone in hopes of watching an action pack cowboy hollywood style block-buster, will be disappointed; but that person only has themselves to blame. This film never was marketed , advertised , introduced , or presented as an action film. Sure, breaking the law and killing was part of Mr. James's life, but thats not all it consisted of, 24/7. In between such things, he reflected, and spoke and thought and got older.And this film portrays the time of Jesse Jame's life that few have shown, if any, in a movie. If you have any sort of an attention span at all, or if you can reflect upon anything at all without needing to being exposed to seisure inducing strobe light camera tricks and trendy brain-numbing  special fx to stay interested for 5 minutes....then i think you can appreciate the genuine performances and rich visual scope found in The Assassination Of Jessie James By The Coward robert ford.I wont get into this all too deeply, ill try to get to the point and say that the acting is well done, especially by Casey Affleck's character, ""Robert Ford"", who is very believable as a slightly obsessed wanna-be that gets to meet his childhood idol. He is genuinely weird at some parts, and you forget this guys an actor in a motion picture. When one man admits to Robert that '... just listening to you gives me the willies...', i began to know what he meant as the film progressed.Its not that Robert is some super creepy guy that we cant stand to see on the screen cuz we cant stomach his character traits and it stops being  entertaining...No. Casey Affleck brings some very genuinely portrayed nieveity  , immaturity , fear , inadequience , embarrassment , and cowardice. Peppered with a character that is a bit unintentionally humorous, which makes his character even more believable and involving.And hes not even the big star of the film.Speaking of the devil, Jessie James is played by 'Brad Pitt'. And ive never been especially that impressed with Pitt, as some superb actor, but he is a decent actor and i think it could be that his acting style isnt really my taste, and i overlooked that prejudice more and more as i tryed to see him for who he potrayed in the film. Dont be mistaken, i dont dislike Pitt. I just think hes more so a good looking actor to some people, than a highly skilled performer.  But the fact that he had me wanting more of Jessie James's character, and becoming a bit emotionally invested in his character, speaks for itself. As the film unfolded with an accompanying narrative like a fine novel...i didnt want Jesse to die. I wanted him to live on.Brad Pitt gains better respect from me, now that ive witnessed this performance. He isnt just some self conscious pretty boy. He has decent taste in choosing scripts and quality films, and i think this film puts a feather in his hat. He too performs authenticly as a nearly detached criminal that has some complexity, emotionally and mentally. He has poise, and is all at once, wild. Matured and yet still unabashed.He is aware that people within his own circle, dread him.The scope of the film is rich and as brisk as winter. You can feel the ice cold gusts of air blowing against and through you. I just wish there was more time taken to show off the scenery, i wanted to breathe it all in  more. I wished this film was of some epic proportions.The score of music behind this film is magical at times, and really suits the film. it helps this film , giving it that special mood of wonder i think. Just view the films trailer, and it will give a good dose of what im saying. Im even planning on purchasing the film's soundtrack. It has a sense of wonder and sadness and innocent wonder, in places, to me. And is one of the movie's strengths, aside from the performances found here.The film was a decent effort, and though i wish they would of left out some needless content, like sexual references that just kind of cheapened the experience for a moment or two, for me, i think its worthy and very welcome addition to modern western films. I enjoyed this way more than ""3:10 To Yuma, with Christian Bale and Russel Crowe"", and im definitely  one that likes a good dose of action in westerns, like ""Open Range"" for instance, and Clint Eastwood westerns, but this film ""The Assassination Of Jessie James..."" takes a deeper route in the expression of atmosphere and psychology within the western genre. Its nothing too sophisticated, its still entertaining, and thats important.And dont be mistaken. There is some rough violence in the film, but it isnt the main focus of the thing, thats all, but we certainly see bad things carried out to people.I just wished it showed more of Jesse James past, , cuz it would of been a truly great film if they had taken a more epic approach, i think. But they do a good job and deliver a quality film, both in terms of acting and in visual presentation. It all left me wanting more. And i think that says a lot.",4,After thoughts on an outlaw's latter days...,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,5120,"['Seeing', 'preview', 'film', 'i', 'had', 'hunch', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'so',

These are ruthless men who will do anything to get what they are looking for.  They are not shy of being brutal or killing.  Soon enough, the gang goes their separate ways but charismatic Jesse James manages to track them (and kill them) all.  He knows that his brothers are all killed, or in a prison and being that Jesse is married, has wife and two children and enough money for the comfortable life for the rest of his life; he is trying to hang onto his freedom and dear life for as long as possible.  Inside that brutal man with mood swings and anger eating him up, he is still a father and a husband who wants to take care of his own.  Jesse is followed by two brothers: Robert and Charlie Ford who for the short period of time are living with his family.  Jesse is keeping them around more out of fear for being betrayed to authorities than for the sake of showing kindness.  He senses that young Bob Ford, who is only 19 years old, is trying to mimic him in every way.  Jesse uses that so that one day it is Bob Ford who kills Jesse inside his own home. Watching this film is almost like watching Brad Pitt's movie ""Seven"" in reverse. This time it is Brad who plays a villain and young Casey Afflect an innocenet who gets sucked into a game of murder.  Actress Mary-Louise Parker who plays Zee, Jesse's wife, is fantastic in her supporting role of a wife who knows how to keep distance from the world her husband hates so much, bears him children and manages to stay on his good side.  But it is in his death that we see her full range of emotions for him.  She is tormented by the fact that her husband is being taken pictures of and his body is displayed on ice for public viewing for days at the time, before he is finally put to rest.  Her eyes show expression that is rarely seen on screen.  I wish script was better for this film, although cast is at its best.

The novel this film is based upon, written by Ron Hansen, gives the Devil his due.Bob Ford (Afleck) was a wannabe, the youngest recruit of a gang whose time was close to running out. Frank James (Shepard) had already settled down and was starting a quiet life.The film depicts Ford as having a 'fatal attraction' type of relationship with James in various ways, including showing a boxful of dime novels tucked under Ford's bed. He and his brother Charlie ingratiated themselves with the James Gang by offering the family home as a hideout.Jesse (Pitt) had settled down enough to wed Zee (Parker) and sire three children, but the family moved frequently and often in the night.  Jesse portrayed himself as a 'moneyed man who still had a common touch' to the townfolk of Anywhere, USA that they were residing in at that time.  He was a mercurial leader to his gang, convivial and threatening in turns.In the film, Ford killed James because he believed James was going to kill him. Ford knew of gang-member Dick Liddil's (Paul Schneider) surrender and James himself only found out three weeks later in a newspaper article. The act--depicted in near slow motion in the film--gives viewers time to make up their own minds about Ford's 'heroism' or not.""Assassination"" takes us beyond James' death to Ford's own from an assassin's bullet at his saloon in Creede, Colorado.

The film is 45 minutes too long and moves very slowly - It is also sometimes confusing due to the multitude of interchangeable actors playing the ""rubes"" and country bumpkins. Ultimately I felt I learned nothing about the inner workings of any of the people in the film (other then they were all thieving murderes, sad and pitiful) but instead I felt I got a long somewhat interesting, drawn out history lesson.  The photography, costumes and locations were all tops notch.

Pitt's real life fame informs the celebrity of James who robs from whomever he wishes but has a reputation of revenge against Unionists and Republicans.  A kind of Robin Hood in the public mind of the time.And Casey Affleck is chillingly perfect as Robert Ford, an obsessive fan and stalker of James who announces at one point that he has always ""been a nobody, but since he was born, James has been as big as a tree.""  Of the two men and their weird almost parasitic relationship, it is Affleck's Ford that is the more demented.But the thing that stands out in this hypnotic film is the cinematography by the brilliant Roger Deakins.  This is as beautiful a film as I have ever seen. Reminds me of ""Days of Heaven.""  The feeling of time and place and the passing of seasons is as evocative as a lucid dream.  Hypnotic and almost surreal in it's sometimes fragile beauty.  The landscape is as much a character as the humans in conflict.  But what is so memorable, is the way the characters weave their lives through the light and shadows of their world.The music by Nick Cave (and Warren Ellis) is an extension of the images.  Elegiac is a description that comes to mind.  The subtle layers of natural sounds and ambient rich ""silences"" add immeasurably to the evocative feel of being in 1880s heartland America.Andrew Dominik's second film deserves to be seen by a wider audience.  I look forward to a longer director's cut with commentary by Pitt, Affleck and Dominik.This beautiful movie that examines a dark heart is so superior to the over-hyped and dreadful ""There Will Be Blood"" it is hard to understand how it slipped between the cracks.  What has been mostly over-looked by theatrical audience can be (re)discovered on DVD.  Don't miss it.

1125291,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0010DR4BO,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2If ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is to be believed, then surely hell hath no fury like an idol worshipper scorned.  And if it isn't, well heck, a little yarn-spinning might not be entirely out of order in a movie that is, by its very nature, a lyrical, haunting and visually stunning elegy to the fabled Old West and the larger-than-life figures who inhabited it.The ""idol,"" in this case, is Jesse James, the notorious outlaw who, even before his death in 1882 at the age of 34, had become a legend in his own time, famous the world over for the many highly publicized robberies and killings he committed all across the American heartland.  Indeed, an entire cottage industry of highly romanticized literature (a sensationalized mixture of fact and fiction) had already sprung up around him and the other members of his gang (including his nearly-as-famous brother, Frank).  One of those who not only gobbled up the mythology but absorbed it into his soul was a young, self-described ""nobody"" by the name of Robert Ford, who, at the age of nineteen, finally got the chance to not only meet his childhood hero in person, but to join up with him in what would turn out to be the bandit's final great train robbery.  However, disillusionment can come mighty quickly when an idol is revealed to have feet of clay, and when Jesse didn't accord Robert the respect he felt he was entitled to, the one-time sycophant became the gunman's most dangerous nemesis - and the man who would eventually take his life.""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is not a traditional shoot-`em-up action picture, but rather a long, deliberative and contemplative mood piece focused on the burdens of ""celebrity"" and on the need to be a ""somebody"" in the eyes of the public.  In a beautifully understated performance, Brad Pitt portrays James as part ruthless killer and part raving paranoiac, a mentally unbalanced sadist who spends much of his time waging physical as well as psychological warfare on the men he feels have betrayed him (with good reason in some cases).  Yet, Pitt allows moments of humanity and tenderness to seep through his otherwise buttoned-down, stoic demeanor.  As Ford, Casey Affleck is the true revelation in this film, finding the root of this pipsqueak's incessant need for braggadocio in his low self-esteem and obsessive need for recognition from others.  The irony is that Ford's version of ""celebrity,"" when he finally achieves it, is quite different from that of Mr. James - even if their fates take eerily similar paths in the end.  These two superb actors are matched in performance by Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Sam Sheperd, all of whom are excellent in their roles.Using Ron Hansen's novel as his source, writer/director Andrew Dominik has crafted a work that, aesthetically speaking, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, a film in which virtually every shot can stand as its own work of art.  Roger Deakins' brilliantly lit, softly filtered cinematography (reminiscent of the work in the similarly themed ""The Grey Fox"") lends an otherworldly quality to the film, perfect for bringing out the legendary nature of the material.  And Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful and haunting score goes a long ways towards achieving that end as well.From first frame to last, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Brown"" draws the audience into its beautifully lit world of history and legend - and makes us a part of that world.",4,a visual masterpiece,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,3525,"['****1/2If', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'be', 'believed', 'then', 'surely', 'hell', 'hath', 'fury', 'idol', 'worshipper', 'scorned', ""n't"", 'well', 'heck', 'little', 'yarn-spinning', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'order', 'movie', 'very', 'nature', 'lyrical', 'haunting', 'visually', 'stunning', 'elegy', 'fabled', 'Old', 'West', 'larger-than-life', 'figures', 'who', 'inhabited', 'it.The', 'idol', 'case', 'Jesse', 'James', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'who', 'even', 'death', '1882', 'age', '34', 'had', 'become', 'legend', 'own', 'time', 'famous', 'world', 'many', 'highly', 'publicized', 'robberies', 'killings', 'committed', 'American', 'heartland', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'cottage', 'industry', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'literature', 'sensationalized', 'mixture', 'fact', 'fiction', 'had', 'already', 'sprung', 'up', 'other', 'members', 'gang', 'including', 'nearly-as-famous', 'brother', 'Frank', 'One', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'gobbled', 'up', 'mythology', 'absorbed', 'soul', 'was', 'young', 'self-described', 'nobody', 'name', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'who', 'age', 'nineteen', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'not', 'only', 'meet', 'childhood', 'hero', 'person', 'join', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bandit', 'final', 'great', 'train', 'robbery', 'However', 'disillusionment', 'can', 'come', 'mighty', 'quickly', 'when', 'idol', 'revealed', 'have', 'feet', 'clay', 'when', 'Jesse', 'did', ""n't"", 'accord', 'Robert', 'respect', 'felt', 'was', 'entitled', 'one-time', 'sycophant', 'became', 'gunman', 'most', 'dangerous', 'nemesis', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'take', 'life', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'not', 'traditional', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'action', 'picture', 'rather', 'long', 'deliberative', 'contemplative', 'mood', 'piece', 'focused', 'burdens', 'celebrity', 'need', 'be', 'somebody', 'eyes', 'public', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'James', 'part', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'part', 'raving', 'paranoiac', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'sadist', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'waging', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'men', 'have', 'betrayed', 'good', 'reason', 'cases', 'Pitt', 'moments', 'humanity', 'tenderness', 'seep', 'otherwise', 'buttoned-down', 'stoic', 'demeanor', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'true', 'revelation', 'film', 'finding', 'root', 'pipsqueak', 'incessant', 'need', 'braggadocio', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'obsessive', 'need', 'recognition', 'others', 'irony', 'Ford', 'version', 'celebrity', 'when', 'finally', 'quite', 'different', 'Mr.', 'James', 'even', 'fates', 'take', 'eerily', 'similar', 'paths', 'end', 'two', 'superb', 'actors', 'are', 'matched', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Sam', 'Sheperd', 'whom', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles.Using', 'Ron', 'Hansen', 'novel', 'source', 'writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'crafted', 'work', 'aesthetically', 'speaking', 'nothing', 'short', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'virtually', 'shot', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'work', 'art', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'brilliantly', 'lit', 'softly', 'filtered', 'cinematography', 'reminiscent', 'work', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Grey', 'Fox', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'film', 'perfect', 'bringing', 'out', 'legendary', 'nature', 'material', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'score', 'long', 'ways', 'towards', 'achieving', 'end', 'well.From', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Brown', 'audience', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'world', 'history', 'legend', 'part', 'world']",N/A

Rasband,"[3, 4]","""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" is an unexpected masterpiece, a great throwback to those wonderful existential Westerns of the 1960's and 1970's likeThe Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Outlaw Josey Wales.  The film approaches its subject deliberately and lulls you into its thoughtful rhythms, all the more to shock you when its explosions come.  The film also recallsUnforgiven [HD DVD] in its examination of violence and the darker impulses of human psychology.  Brad Pitt plays another one of his charismatic madmen, but very few actors are able to contain both the charm and the psychosis as well as Pitt.  The author of the novelThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Fordwhich this film was based on, Ron Hansen, is a serious Catholic.  So this film is a painfully honest portrait of a damned soul, one that is rotting from the inside out because of the bad choices he has made.As great as Pitt is, the real revelation here is Casey Affleck as the coward Robert Ford (who is destined to always be known by that adjective.)  You see Ford's scheming, his resemblance to latter day creeps like those that killed John Lennon and tried to kill Reagan.  But we're reminded that he was a very young and immature man, and sometimes the greatest curse is to be rewarded with the kind of fame you seek at that age.  I suppose you could also compare this movie to those by the great Terrence Malick.  If you will adjust your expectations from the frantic pace of today's other movies, and give yourself to the almost literary storytelling, you will have a great movie experience.  It does kill me that there is such a lack of special features on this disc.  Supposedly there is an even longer version out there.  Something has to explain why the terrific Mary-Louise Parker appears in so few scenes.

The film does go at a slow pace and may lose people who are looking for the western with action every 10 minutes.What I did find kind of interesting is the fact that Robert Ford is labeled a coward. However, I found that Jesse James did a couple of cowardly acts in the film. One is during the train robbery, Jesse James hits an unarmed railroad employee over the head with his revolver. As the man laid semiconscious on the floor, Jesse James is about to shoot him in the head before another member of the James gang talks him out of it. Another incident involves shooting another gang member late at night as they are riding. Jesse James holds his horse back and lets the other man ride ahead. At a distance, James then proceeds to shoot the man in the back and head.When Robert Ford kills Jesse James by shooting him in the back, he is called a coward. However, Jesse James is not a coward. Interesting. It also shows that Jesse James was not a Robin Hood by taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The film also portrays Jesse James as someone who was mentally unhinged in several aspects.Interesting film. I give it 4 stars. It is worth seeing once.

You saw the real jessie james, the real RF as a human beings and not what Robert Ford read in his books. *maybe the books are better* Like the RF you begin to think less highly of JJ as you would the movie. The down side is the obvious, long and boring in some parts, and it had allot of sky scenes that could of just been left out. True thats the only downside. Still its the way the characters were portrayed as nothing but humanbeings and not gunhoe trigger happy cowboys. Still what if it was? would it be a disater like Brads last movie troy?

1125309,A17QWJEEELWETQ,B0010DR4BO,spiders-n-vinegaroons,"[0, 0]","Where this movie differs from your typical Westerns is that there is a bountiful amount of character development. To keep comparisons fresh, Assassination is nothing like Tombstone, Wyatt Earp, or even Unforgiven. Where those films focused more on brawling, gunfighting, and action, Assassination goes in depth into the character of Jesse James, Robert Ford, and some of the other members of the James gang. Of course this will seem dragged out when you're watching the movie, but there's special ways to make character development appealing to the audience. It depends on the look, the speech, and the emotion displayed by the actor. In a movie like this where there are several shots of Jesse just sitting or standing still, the story keeps going on because we're learning more about the character as we look at facial expressions, the way he breathes, the look in his eyes. We're subject to their raw emotion. We can feel the weight on their shoulders, minds. Movies are meant to be engaging to the audience. You have that here when you're either sympathizing with Robert Ford, or outraged by James' ruthlessness and vice versa. These are the movies that tense you up when you're wondering what's going to happen next, and when you care about characters and how they play throughout the rest of the film. This movie should have been considered for Best Film simply because it's an unbelievable performance on all counts by all characters involved regardless of the genre.

If you don't get him now he'll get you tonight.' Without further thought or a moment's delay I pulled my revolver and leveled it as I sat. He heard the hammer click as I cocked it with my thumb and started to turn as I pulled the trigger. The ball struck him just behind the ear and he fell like a log, dead.""In a letter to Missouri Governor Thomas Crittenden, Robert Ford uses the above excerpt to describe the fashion in which he murdered the infamous Jesse James, an act which is laboriously but nevertheless fantastically depicted in fledgling writer-director Andrew Dominik's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"".""Assassination..."" is a slow draw, literally and figuratively.  The movie illustrates Robert Ford's childish admiration of the outlaw Jesse James and his desire to become a part of his now disintegrating gang, James looking to retire from a life of crime in the interest of raising his children with an honest living.  Worming his way into their last big heist, Robert (Affleck) and his brother Charley (Rockwell) become enticed by a $10,000 bounty placed on James's head and decide to cash in.  What they don't count on is mutiny on the bound in the form of Wood Hite, James's cousin and a cocky gunslinger whom is wary of Robert from the moment he appears.  Robert is viewed as a stain on the small band and when he and Wood begin to butt heads, a shoot out ensues, leaving Wood in need of a coffin.  Now out on the lam for a murder, Robert makes a deal with Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden to be pardoned in exchange for the death of Jesse James.  Robert is only happy to do so, his reward not only monetary but his role as executioner of a well-known criminal paving the way for self-generated celebrity.  Oddly enough, once the deed is done, a reversal of roles takes place and Jesse, despite his nefarious reputation, is revered while Robert is scorned for his ultimate betrayal of a legendary figure.The film's lengthy title appropriately serves to represent its extensive duration.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes (the original cut was almost four hours - YIKES), half of who sit down to view it will be squirming in their seats and repeatedly checking their watches (or the counter on their DVD player).  Things do not happen quickly in this film and if it weren't for the performances from Affleck, Pitt and Rockwell and an excellent screenplay from director Andrew Dominik, it would be lost on most people (not to mention the inevitable incomplete viewings because someone fell asleep or just flat out turned it off because they became wearied by it all).  I am of the opinion that it could've used some serious offerings for the cutting room floor; as it is, some scenes are inexplicably long and there are so many pregnant pauses between bits of dialogue that you wish the producer(s) and/or editor(s) would've just cut to the chase instead of letting their actors linger, staring off into space as if they needed a cue.  This is by far the most bothersome feature when one views ""Assassination..."" and should be considered a warning to anyone who prefers movies that roll along at a productive pace.Other than the above complaints, there is a lot to be enjoyed and appreciated about ""Assassination..."", starting with Casey Affleck.  Affleck has found another interesting role this year, the first of which was a commendable performance in ""Gone Baby Gone"".  His portrayal of Robert's fear as well as inferiority to those around him are palpable; when confronted with the moment his ruse has been exposed to Jesse, his body literally sinks into a chair, face glistening from sweat and fighting off tears as he waits with a blanched face and his heart in his throat for his imminent execution.  It's that palpability that had him nearly winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (he lost to Javier Bardem for ""No Country For Old Men"", indisputably deserved).  If he keeps playing his cards right, he'll become a better actor than his brother Ben will ever be (personally, I think he has already surpassed Ben in that department).  Perhaps it was meant to be that the elder of the Afflecks made the transition to the director's chair whilst Casey remains burned in the effigy of film, ergo the minds of audiences nationwide.Pitt has always been an iffy actor but the role of Jesse James seems to suit him and he plays the part well of a man torn by his conviction to protect his own best interests and a man whom is trying to make amends with the past.  There is also the implication that James is mentally disquieted, the victim of what could appear to some people to be frightening episodes of bipolar disorder.  James even so much as admits this to himself when he says, ""I haven't been acting correctly. I can't hardly recognize myself sometimes when I'm greased. I go on journeys out of my body and look at my red hands and my mean face and I wonder about that man who's gone so wrong. I've been becoming a problem to myself."" One minute he is maniacally laughing, the next he is staring off into the distance with glazed and melancholy eyes.  Pitt is spell-binding in a scene where James goes off the deep end, cackling wildly whilst quietly ruminating his inability to trust Ford - when he suddenly whips out a blade in a blind rage ready to slit Ford's throat, we see just how unpredictable and unstable James has become.  This scene only serves to validate his gang's growing fear and/or uncertainty of him and sheds light on the reason why his brother Frank (Shepard) parted ways with him.  In a time when mental disorders were little understood, this only serves to explain why James may have been the way he was and why he had become so dangerous to those who knew him.Sam Rockwell is a memorable supporting role as Charley Ford and despite his happy-go-lucky demeanor he is well aware of Jesse's savage temperament.  In the end, out of guilt and self-loathing, he spares himself of the disdain to which his brother Robert is subjected in the only manner he thinks is dignified and just.Shot largely in different parts of Canada, ""Assassination..."" was also well deserved of its Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography (cinematographer Robert Elswit won this for ""There Will Be Blood""), Roger Deakins capturing the simplistic beauty of Alberta's sprawling hills, fields and forests as well as its brutal but spellbinding winters.Bottom line: ""Assassination..."" really requires some patience on a viewer's part.  This virtue of virtues will be well rewarded by rich, complex performances by the film's leads and the whole of its supporting cast.",3,Slow Draw (3.5 stars),1214092800,"06 22,

My advice is to watch this when you have nothing pressing and can devote yourself to a slow unwinding tale.Initially I thought the title was long and unwieldy. Now I see that it's perfect. &#34;Assassination&#34; is a word reserved for the furtive, treacherous murder of a prominent person. This is indeed a story about how Jesse James was killed. The &#34;By the Coward Robert Ford&#34; part was also quite necessary because THAT is an even greater part of the story than Jesse's death.The movie is long and slow. I think that was done to show the pace of the times they lived in and also to make the events more true to life. In movies it's &#34;WHAM, BAM&#34; and then you're on to the next thing. If you spend minutes watching a conversation unfold, you get more of a fly-on-the-wall feeling. In this case, it's effective.The film takes its time getting to the murder. From the murder to the end, you get the big pay-off. It's not a happy tale. It's quite dark in fact. It's probably not a movie I will be watching again in a hurry (in fact I had bad dreams about it when it was all over), but it was one that left an impression on me.

Casey Affleck (younger brother of Ben), plays Ford, a teenager who latches on to the James gang for their last heist, a train robbery that adds to the legend, but not the bank account of the gang's leader, Jesse.The story is told at a lazy pace that borders on falling asleep in the theater. Writer and director Andrew Dominik uses multiple techniques to tell the story, from blurred lens for scenes from the past, to slow nature shots to denote the passage of time. The problem is, if you keep showing clouds moving in the sky to tell us months have passed, after a while, it becomes superfluous, because months have actually passed.At just over two hours and forty minutes, the film is about 2 hours too long, and while the pensive approach is a fascinating throwback to westerns from 30 years ago, it doesn't actually serve any greater storyline purpose, and ends up a stylistic choice that makes the film difficult to drag through.Pitt is actually quite excellent as James, perfectly conveying the charm and evil that made him Jesse. Casey Affleck has more trouble portraying Ford's combination of acolyte and traitor, and ends up just being weak and pathetic as an actor.It's beautifully shot, turning the Alberta countryside (my hometown) into a mythic landscape.",4,"Good movie, much too long..................................",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,1382,"['Brad', 'Pitt', 'James', 'who', '34', 'start', 'movie', 'already', 'legend', '17', 'murders', 'committed', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Ford', 'teenager', 'who', 'James', 'gang', 'last', 'heist', 'train', 'robbery', 'legend', 'not', 'bank', 'account', 'gang', 'leader', 'Jesse.The', 'story', 'told', 'lazy', 'pace', 'borders', 'falling', 'asleep', 'theater', 'Writer', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'multiple', 'techniques', 'tell', 'story', 'blurred', 'lens', 'scenes', 'past', 'slow', 'nature', 'shots', 'denote', 'passage', 'time', 'problem', 'keep', 'showing', 'clouds', 'moving', 'sky', 'tell', 'months', 'have', 'passed', 'while', 'superfluous', 'months', 'have', 'actually', 'passed.At', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'minutes', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'too', 'long', 'pensive', 'approach', 'fascinating', 'throwback', 'westerns', '30', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'actually', 'serve', 'greater', 'storyline', 'purpose', 'up', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'film', 'difficult', 'drag', 'through.Pitt', 'actually', 'quite', 'excellent', 'James', 'perfectly', 'conveying', 'charm', 'evil', 'made', 'Jesse', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'more', 'trouble', 'portraying', 'Ford', 'combination', 'acolyte', 'traitor', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'weak', 'pathetic', 'actor.It', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'turning', 'Alberta', 'countryside', 'hometown', 'mythic', 'landscape']",N/A

An employee enters the theater and introduces the film you are about to see.""Hello, Ladies and gentlemen. You are about to watch ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"". It has a running time of two hours and fifty minutes...""""Oh, God. It's a Kevin Costner film,"" interrupted an audience member.""I hope it's better than ""Waterworld"","" interrupted another audience member.""Wyatt Earp"" would have been a better analogy for the mouthy individual in the audience - western, famous subject, long running time. And ""The Assassination..."" is better than ""Wyatt Earp"". A lot better. But that isn't saying much. I'm sure ""Good Luck Chuck"" is better than ""Wyatt Earp"".""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a good film. At times, it has moments of real beauty. At times, it makes no sense. At times, it is way, way, way too long. Did I mention it runs about two hours and forty minutes?Jesse James (Brad Pitt) lives with his wife (Mary Louise Parker) and two children in a small house in a small town in Missouri. He enjoys the relative anonymity he has, but this comes at a price; he uses an assumed name and the family moves frequently. Occasionally, his lone living brother, Frank (Sam Shephard) will round up a gang and they rob a train or a bank. One such event brings the Ford brothers into their lives. Bob Ford (Casey Affleck), the younger of the two, is the more eager, and irritating sibling. The older, Charley (Sam Rockwell) has worked with the James' brothers before. But Bob is eager to become a permanent member of the crew and both James' brothers regard him as someone who could make a lot of trouble for them, so they keep him at arm's length. They rob a train and this seems to be the last straw for a lot of law enforcement. Jesse realizes there are a lot of loose ends out there, which could threaten his family and his retirement, so he tries to round up the members of the gang. Most act suspiciously, so Jesse decides to protect himself. When Bob realizes what is happening, he also decides to protect himself and sets out with a plan of his own.Written and directed by Andrew Dominik, there is a lot to like about ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and there is a lot of time to appreciate these things. Did I mention the film is about two hours and forty minutes long? It's very long and would have benefited greatly from a two hour running time. When the first frame of film is a shot of the sky with the clouds rolling by, and then a few shots later, the same thing, you quickly realize Dominik is a filmmaker who is going for something more artistic. And he achieves some shots of real beauty. Dominik spends a lot of time showing passing clouds, shots that make the film seem all that much longer. Did I mention it runs about two hours and forty minutes?The train robbery, which opens the film, is particularly impressive. The gang gathers in the woods very early, have lunch, talk amongst the bare trees and wait. As evening falls, Jesse approaches the tracks and determines the train is approaching. Everyone dons their masks and the light of the train starts to shine through the barren trees, casting moveable shadows across the nervous robbers. The light and smoke from the locomotive combine as the beast thunders along the tracks, approaching the blockade they have created. The smoke and light envelopes the robbers as they wait for the train to stop. The scene is shot beautifully and is one of the few moments I have ever seen in a film adequately portraying the power of a train. We get the feeling this machine could do a lot of good and a lot of damage; it is a powerful beast so as much as they want to rob the train, they have to make sure it stops, and that it doesn't harm any of them.There are other moments similar to this throughout the film. Many of the homes we see appear fairly new, yet are still dusty and rustic. It is a nice evocation of the new nature of many of these homesteads. As Robert Ford starts a new life in a Colorado camp, we see many of the buildings are little more than a canvas shell.But there is a lot of film to get through to get to these moments. Have I mentioned the film runs about two hours and forty minutes?The acting is good.Brad Pitt plays the famous outlaw Jesse James.That's pretty much all I can say about Pitt. He doesn't really play a character he is simply Brad Pitt. He doesn't do a bad job, but I never once felt I was watching anyone other than Brad Pitt. It is also a little unclear why he suddenly starts `visiting' all of the members of the gang who assisted with the train robbery. This isn't all his fault, much of this is Dominik's problem as well, but it doesn't help that we are never able to see beyond the actor's persona.Pitt's best moments happen during the opening moments. A narrator provides a little history of James' retirement, as we watch Pitt and his wife and children in various tableaus. These moments help to build his character and are very effective. But when he starts to speak, we hear Pitt's stock western accent and the image is ruined. We are now watching Brad Pitt.Casey Affleck plays Bob Ford, an eager, over anxious, annoying suck up who really wants to be part of the James' gang. He clearly relishes the fame and Frank James is right to brush him off. But this only seems to make Bob more determined to be a part of their lives. After the train robbery, he and his brother and friends try to live, and make due, and then learn Jesse is coming after them.Bob seems to realize he can be both a hero to his brother and friends, and also a hero to the public at large. He must simply kill Jesse James. But can anyone kill Jesse James, who has seventeen murders to his credit? It is a scary proposition and it takes a while for him to work up the courage.Did I mention the film runs about two hours and forty minutes long?After Bob Ford assassinates Jesse James, he receives an unexpected kind of attention and has to deal with this, to learn how to deal with this. These moments are interesting and effective.A lot of what we learn about the characters throughout the film comes from the aforementioned narration. This is an interesting technique, but in a way, it also makes the film seem even longer. We aren't really an active participant in the story, we are being told what people are thinking, what their motivations are. When we learn this through the actions of characters, we feel like a part of the story.""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a good film, but it misses the mark of greatness by about forty minutes.Have I mentioned the film runs about two hours and forty minutes?",4,You Can Hide Things In Vocabulary,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,6837,"['Landmark', 'Theater',

Even with Brad Pitt and Ridley Scott producing, Warner Brothers hated this film and dumped it in a limited release theatrical run. Now on dvd, it's literally selling out at many major chains. I am not a big fan of westerns, but there are a few that captivate me. The Assassination Of Jesse James is the kind of film that the masses just won't get. It is slow paced, deep and full of little details that truly immerse you in the late 1800's. It doesn't have horse chases and lots of gunfights, so the general public should just stick with 3:10 To Yuma (a fine film itself). This movie is so detailed and rich that it requires several viewings just to take it all in. I watched it twice in 2 days. The music, the acting, the locations...all perfect. I really appreciated the ""Gothic"" look of the film as well. Instead of wearing tan dusters, big hats and other such standard ""cowboy"" apparel, the characters are mostly seen in black, Victorian era coats and hats. Very interesting and visually stunning.

1125329,A96JD9312DHWC,B0010DR4BO,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[5, 5]","Ford - a name associated with the last days of Jesse James and the stuff of many a hateful ballad. Why? Because Ford was once hailed as a hero when he pushed a bullet into the skull of Jesse James, only to be later labelled a coward because of many an aspect. First there was the way that Jesse died - a bullet to the back of the head - and the way the media sought to portray the outlaw. Much like many of the people in his day, the outlaw had become bigger than life and, though a killer amongst other things, he was - as the film points out - looked at with the same wonder that one would show the wonders of the world. Second, Jesse still had a following in the states that felt that they should have fought on in the Civil War. Added to that was the fact that Pinkertons raided the family farmhouse and cost his mother an arm, that he was constantly hounded and the price seemed to go skyward as he slipped noose after noose, and that he had a proclivity for killing ""old friends"" that he saw as threats and you had a legend. When this legend died at the hands of robert Ford, a seeming piece of backdrop on Jesse Jame's stage, and you had yourself a tale rife with villiany. Never ind the deeds of his past - he was an icon. so much so, in fact, that Ford's killer was - as the movie again pointed out - pardoned for the crime after serving only a dose of his lifelong sentence.It seemed like someone like Robert Ford was not good enough to kill someone like Jesse in the eyes of the public.The movie picks up in the brittle places where Jesse and death are closing in on one another, and it seems as though Jesse knows what is coming. It takes us through the struggles that Jesse has in maintaining the mask of sanity that barely fit him to begin with, showing us the actions of a person who almost seemed to have a deathwish. It also throws in the players in this dance that sets around the man, with Jesse finding himself listening to rumors and fearing even those closest to him. enter the deaths of many of the people he rode with, and the two Fords that would ultimately bring about his demise.What i liked about this movie was the fact that Robert ford was not ignored in this movie (although the portrayal of Jesse was hard to stop watching), and that he wasn't classified as a simpleton or some sort of screw-up. He was simply a person doing what he thought was right, and that was emulating the person he looked up to most in the world. The problem was that this person, Jesse, wronged him in ways both subtle and in crowds, and he and Charlie Ford began noticing what was happening all around them. Robert wanted to be as big as Jesse, but he also wanted to live long enough to see past his 21st birthday. On that death day, the things played out in a way that made me wonder if Jesse didn't want to have a gunfight in a house filled with his family, or if he was just tired and he kind of liked the kid that he picked on. Granted, this was a movie and answers seldom come from movies, but this thing was something I liked when I watched it.If you are loking for gunfighting and a lot of action, then look for another Jesse James movie. This is the last days of Jesse and is focused on Robert Ford, not the James Gang. This means that you have a lot of thought and wonderment, a lot of disappointment and fear, and a lot of disillusionment when the world didn't applaud his last move.

It starts out slowly, builds up slowly, and ends slowly but still manages to become an incredible peace of work. It is a very well-developed, methodically paced character study of two men--Jesse James and Robert Ford. This is not a busy story with lots of things happening. Robert Ford (played by Cassey Affleck) is entering adulthood (he is 19 but tells everyone he is 20). He is the youngest of five brothers, and seems like the one who was always teased mercilessly, never taken seriously, and never given any responsibility or respect. In contrast, Jesse James (played by Brad Pitt) is coming to the end of his infamous legendary career (he is 34). He always seems in control, does not show his emotions outwardly and is feared and respected wherever he goes.The majority of the film is Robert attempting to get in the ""in"" group of Jesse's gang. He wants to be the close one to Jesse. He examines and imitates Jesse's every move and gesture with an intense obsession, like a crazed fan of a certain celebrity. His methodical, relentless observations of Jesse border on obsession and are laced with sexual longing overtones.I never was hugely impressed with Brad Pitt's acting abilities until I saw Bable and now he produces another very real, stirring performance brining out more of his talent. Cassey Affleck delivers the best performance of the film as he is able to convey so much emotion, longing, and desire just with expressions and tones of voice. I am curious to see what he does next.I love long films, but I think this should have been shorter because some of the length of the film (2hrs.40mins. to be exact) comes from extended still shots of various people and scenes which, due to the simplicity of the story, bogged the film down and seemed unnecessary.

This is a slow paced, arty character study of Jesse James and his killer, Robert Ford. Brad Pitt's performance is excellent. He portrays Jesse as a charismatic, violent, obtuse man. It is a complex and subtle performance. Casey Affleck turns in a compelling performance as Robert Ford, the young man obsessed with the Jesse James legend. Unfortunately, although the acting is superb, the film is very poorly edited. There are long, boring sequences where secondary characters sit around and talk that distract from the coherence of the film's focus. This film should have lost 45 minutes and it would have been a masterpiece. The cinematography is superb. The music is haunting. But Affleck and Pitt were cheated. Their thunder was stolen by a director so in love with what he filmed that he wouldn't edit appropriately. One of the best performances -- Sam Shepard as Frank James -- is just a cameo. His character disappears with no explanation less than halfway through the film. Ridley Scott produced this film; he knows better and would have been wise to share his expertise with the director.

Each scene, each shot, and each frame are canvases for the artists of direction and cinematography, as they fill the film with natural light, shadows, and Monet-like sunsets.  Adding to the visceral appeal of the presentation is a voiceover narrative that rivals anything found in The Shawshank Redemption, A River Runs Through It or Stand by Me.  Yes, the story is flawed, but the packaging more than makes up for any errors in plot.  Critics who point to the grueling 2:40 runtime are justified in their concerns;  the film is a bit bloated and about an hour in the middle could have been cut without real harm to the story, but the opening 45 minutes and the closing chapter after James' death are as close to cinematic perfection as you'll see this year.Like Training Day or Silence of the Lambs, the film is falsely marketed as being about the more famous actor in the more charismatic role.  This movie is Robert Ford's story, with a performance by Casey Affleck better than anything from 2007 by mortals not named Daniel Day Lewis. Ford is somewhere between the wide-eyed William Miller from Almost Famous getting to hang with the people who visited his dreams during his youth and The Kid from Unforgiven who rides North with the man he'd heard about his entire life. Robert Ford is everything good about having a hero, but he's everything wrong about that fine line crosses when celebrity attraction becomes and obsession.But again, as much as I like the central character and find his story fascinating, the jewel of this film is the its artful presentation.

But they were shaped by the era in which they grew up, and then they shaped the next era themselves, from Minnesota to Kentucky to Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri, and, legend would have it, even to points farther away from their home ground. I've seen all the movies, most of which are bad, but this new production was one of the biggest disappointments in my James' memorabilia career. It takes real talent to make the life and death of Jesse monotonous, mumbling, rambling, confusing, and cold. The cinematography is the star of this film, and when that is true, you know you have a failed movie (just like Robert Redford's terrible ""Horse Whisperer"" which will be remembered only for bringing us a teenage Scarlett Johannson.) The script is disjointed, the characters shallow except for Bob and Jesse, and the first 90 minutes seems to take four hours. The final hour is much, much better, but not enough better to make buying this DVD a good investment. Rent it once, if you are a western lore fan, but don't expect to be riveted by this version of 1882's most famous American murder. In May, 2007, through the kindness of my great and good friend Jim Clark of Overland Park, Kansas, who is no fan of bank robbers, I got to spend 2.5 hours at Jesse and Frank's birthplace farm in Kearney, Missouri. That experience was more powerful than all the James celluoid ever shot, including this effort. If you live anywhere near Kansas City, go see the James Farm and the bank in Liberty instead of buying this DVD. You won't be sorry.",2,It took real effort to make Jesse James boring...,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2218,"['can', 'just', 'imagine', 'negative', 'votes', 'roll', 'piece', 'can', 'stand', 'ground', 'have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'James', 'saga', 'more', '50', 'years', 'read', 'non-fiction', 'accounts', 'boys', 'careers', 'corresponded', 'teen', 'Homer', 'Croy', 'author', 'Jesse', 'James', 'was', 'Neighbor', 'bought', 'copy', 'infamous', '1950', 'publication', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Alive', 'Lawton', 'editors', 'Lawton', 'OK', 'Constitution', 'promoted', 'J.', 'Frank', 'Dalton', 'spurious', 'claims', 'have', 'staged', 'murder', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'say', 'am', 'admirer', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'were', 'indeed', 'robbers', 'killers', 'not', 'folks', 'would', 'welcome', 'own', 'clan', 'were', 'shaped', 'era', 'grew', 'up', 'then', 'shaped', 'next', 'era', 'Minnesota', 'Kentucky', 'Nebraska', 'Kansas', 'Missouri', 'legend', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'points', 'farther', 'away', 'home', 'ground', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'most', 'are', 'bad', 'new', 'production', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'James', 'memorabilia', 'career', 'real', 'talent', 'make', 'life', 'death', 'Jesse', 'monotonous', 'mumbling', 'rambling', 'confusing', 'cold', 'cinematography', 'star', 'film', 'when', 'true', 'know', 'have', 'failed', 'movie', 'just', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'terrible', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'only', 'bringing', 'teenage', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'script', 'disjointed', 'characters', 'shallow', 'Bob', 'Jesse', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'take', 'four', 'hours', 'final', 'hour', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'enough', 'better', 'make', 'buying', 'good', 'investment', 'Rent', 'once', 'are', 'western', 'lore', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'riveted', 'version', '1882', 'most', 'famous', 'American', 'murder', 'May', '2007', 'kindness', 'great', 'good', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Clark', 'Overland', 'Park', 'Kansas', 'who', 'fan', 'bank', 'robbers', 'got', 'spend', '2.5', 'hours', 'Jesse', 'Frank', 'birthplace', 'farm', 'Kearney', 'Missouri', 'experience', 'was', 'more', 'powerful', 'James', 'celluoid', 'ever', 'shot', 'including', 'effort', 'live', 'anywhere', 'Kansas', 'City', 'go', 'see', 'James', 'Farm', 'bank', 'Liberty', 'instead', 'buying', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",N/A

After an hour and a half of yawning occasionally .. the movie got alot more interresting and in conclusion .... I agree on the coward part.Brad and Casey were both incredible in this movie, it makes you feel that it's different from the westerns you're used to, everything is different..the pace, the directing, the editing, the acting, I mean this is truely one of a kind.",5,Confused!,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,869,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'history', 'jesse', 'james', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'outlaw', 'legend', 'somekind', 'bought', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'one', 'latest', 'HD', 'DVD', 'i', 'was', 'interrested', 'seeing', 'it.It', 'out', 'slowly', 'talking', 'jesse', 'then', 'robert', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'wanted', 'know', 'why', 'did', 'call', 'coward', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brave', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'passed', 'was', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'guy', 'then', 'started', 'clear', 'up', 'hour', 'half', 'yawning', 'occasionally', '..', 'movie', 'got', 'alot', 'more', 'interresting', 'conclusion', 'agree', 'coward', 'part.Brad', 'Casey', 'were', 'incredible', 'movie', 'feel', 'different', 'westerns', ""'re"", 'used', 'everything', 'different..the', 'pace', 'directing', 'editing', 'acting', 'mean', 'truely', 'one', 'kind']",N/A
