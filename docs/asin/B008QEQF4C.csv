1574292,A3J1ZCC4JH7O2C,B008QEQF4C,Blessed  in Indiana,"[2, 2]","I cannot say enough about David Phelp's voice!  One of the most outstanding tenors I have ever listened to! His vocal range is not to be believed.  I must say that this DVD brings all of his talent to bear. I have played it over and over and every time I hear something that I missed before.The DVD has so much more on it than the CD. The dialog between David and Bill before each piece is very interesting. The history of the theater,was great to hear.David's arrangement of 'The Angel Band' is the best I have ever heard. I loved it! His original music is not to be believed.  'The Dream' will keep you spellbound.I could go on and on, but, you need to listen to this for yourself and then you will see what I am speaking of.Blessings to David and his family and to the Gaithers for presenting him to us.",5,"Wonderful, Wonderful Voice!!",1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,806,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'David', 'Phelp', 'voice', 'One', 'most', 'outstanding', 'tenors', 'have', 'ever', 'listened', 'vocal', 'range', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'must', 'say', 'DVD', 'talent', 'bear', 'have', 'played', 'over', 'time', 'hear', 'something', 'missed', 'before.The', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'CD', 'dialog', 'David', 'Bill', 'piece', 'very', 'interesting', 'history', 'theater', 'was', 'great', 'hear.David', 'arrangement', ""'The"", 'Angel', 'Band', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'loved', 'original', 'music', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'Dream', 'will', 'keep', 'spellbound.I', 'could', 'go', 'need', 'listen', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'am', 'speaking', 'of.Blessings', 'David', 'family', 'Gaithers', 'presenting']",N/A

He is funny, personable and, who in the world has a better voice than his?  You will enjoy not only his amazing musical talent, but also his creativity in production, such as the unusual presentation of ""Angel Band.""  In addition, you will meet his very talented children and his two sisters.  This is a long DVD - about 2 1/2 hours, but it flies by  because it touches your heart, your spirit and your emotions.
