1494577,A345E16MOW2XCB,B005MXQCV6,Ginny,"[2, 2]","This does seem to be an all around workout and is fairly well done. In addition to cardio, Denise takes viewers through movements that are designed to stretch, work, and sculpt various parts of the body.  Some moves also work on balance.  I only have three issues with the routine.  I believe that every cardio DVD should pause maybe midway and right before the cool down to allow participants to take their pulses in order to make sure they are not overworking or underworking.  The DVD also includes a few sections that incorporate hops in which both feet leave the ground.  A low impact routine keeps one foot on the floor at all times.  Both feet never leave the floor at the same time. This makes the DVD partially high impact, which may be problematic for some participants, especially if you must exercise on cement. I was able to do my own low impact moves in these sections, but it would have been more beneficial I did not have to adapt and if the entire routine could have been authentically low impact. The last issue I have likely won't impact many people. Denise does incorporate quite a few dance moves.  I never took dance lessons, even as a child.  And I was a wall flower much of the time. So I was lost and felt inadequate trying to mimic these moves.  Other than that, this is a decent DVD.I do have three favorite low impact workout that I prefer. Listed in the order of preference, they are:Shape Up with Mary HartBasic Training with Ada: Low Impact & Strength Training WorkoutGilad: The 60 & 30 Minute Low Impact Workouts (The 60 minute gives you about 22 minutes of cardio)My only deep wish with the Mary Hart VHS is that the producers would create a DVD version.

Denise does not have you stay at a move very long, just 2-4 repetitions. She changed moves right when I was finally catching on. Also, it is more dance oriented than I like. I found myself having to leave out some moves because I either could not do them fast enough or they were awkward for me as a person who struggles with coordination. For example, she does these side steps with stomach twists that I could not do at all, so I just stuck to the side steps.She also did turns that I found hard to do in this workout with the other moves. I had to change some moves to be more user friendly for me. If you like dance and like short bursts of activity you may like this workout.
