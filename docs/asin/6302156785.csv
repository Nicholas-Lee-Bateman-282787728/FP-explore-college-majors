298365,A5CWLYXR7HOVJ,6302156785,Duane,"[4, 4]","The movie came out the same year as HBO's ""Josephine Baker"".  Lynn Whitfield gives an amazing performance as La Baker and won the Emmy that year, but I think Suzanne Plushette was more deserving.  She is great!  The role of Leona Helmsley is a very flamboyant one, but she never goes over-the-top (as Joan Collins--who was rumored to have been one of the actresses who wanted the role--would have likely played it).  You believe every emotion that she puts into the role.  The scenes with Lloyd Bridges as Harry are tender and poignant, and one gets the sense of the true love she had for him (yes, the love was based on her husband's wealth and power, but it was love).  However, the scenes of Leona being, well, mean Leona are the standouts.  I love the scene when she scolds her son after his embezzlement is discovered:  ""I will hang you out to dry"".  The scene when the young woman asks Leona if she can dance with Harry--and Leona's reply--is hilarious!  When she inspects one of the hotels before its opening, you actually feel the tension of the employees.  And who can forget the ""wet lettuce"" tirade?I only have my EP recording of this movie (complete with some commercials when I forgot to hit 'pause' while recording it!), and would love to get the VHS or DVD.  It's not yet released on DVD (I hope it will be one day), and the $54 price for the VHS is too steep.",5,Awesome performance,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,1375,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'HBO', 'Josephine', 'Baker', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'amazing', 'performance', 'La', 'Baker', 'won', 'Emmy', 'year', 'think', 'Suzanne', 'Plushette', 'was', 'more', 'deserving', 'great', 'role', 'Leona', 'Helmsley', 'very', 'flamboyant', 'one', 'never', 'over-the-top', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'who', 'was', 'rumored', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'actresses', 'who', 'wanted', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'played', 'believe', 'emotion', 'role', 'scenes', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Harry', 'are', 'tender', 'poignant', 'one', 'sense', 'true', 'love', 'had', 'yes', 'love', 'was', 'based', 'husband', 'wealth', 'power', 'was', 'love', 'However', 'scenes', 'Leona', 'being', 'well', 'mean', 'Leona', 'are', 'standouts', 'love', 'scene', 'when', 'scolds', 'son', 'embezzlement', 'discovered', 'will', 'hang', 'dry', 'scene', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'Leona', 'can', 'dance', 'Harry', 'Leona', 'reply', 'hilarious', 'When', 'one', 'hotels', 'opening', 'actually', 'feel', 'tension', 'employees', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'wet', 'lettuce', 'tirade', 'only', 'have', 'EP', 'recording', 'movie', 'complete', 'commercials', 'when', 'forgot', 'hit', ""'pause"", 'recording', 'would', 'love', 'get', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'DVD', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'day', '54', 'price', 'VHS', 'too', 'steep']",N/A

Suzanne Pleshette (may she rest in peace) did an extraordinary job. First of all it was a stroke of genius by the producers to cast America's sweetheart as the most despicable and loathsome person in recent memory. Ms. Pleshette was nominated for an Emmy or a Golden Globe for this, and after watching it I can certainly see why because she gave such a dead-on performance.The movie is based on the exceptional book by Ransdell Pierson. Ransdell Pierson was the first journalist who exposed Leona and dubbed her the ""Queen of Mean"" for The Post. Sure there were rumors about her utter contempt for all of humanity for years, but not one single journalist had the balls to expose this money-hungry barracuda until Ransdell Pierson. A person who burned as many innocent victims as Leona had no friends; only enemies. So it's no coincidence that once Mr. Pierson opened the floodgates it all came pouring out like a grand tsunami. As a result of her own debauchery, Leona collectively helped keep Cindy Adams, Liz Smith, Howard Stern, SNL and A Current Affair in business during the late '80s.The TV movie tells the life-story of Leona Helmsley from the time she left her first husband (she was married 4 times) until she was convicted of tax fraud. Besides a brief clip as a child, the movie covers Leona's life from 1953 until 1989. There really aren't any other co-stars. There's other people in the story but they disappear rather quickly (after all, wouldn't you too?). The only constant in Leona's life was herself. And that made her entire aura appear chilling because she was like an evil entity that chased everyone away.It's a shame ""Queen of Mean"" is so difficult to find. None of the women's channels will show it. Not one of the 15 different women's networks that show telepics about murderers and violent abusers! And I don't know about you but I'll be damned if I'm going to spend seventy bucks for a used video-cassette. Anyway I just got lucky because it was shown on Movieplex the other day. I checked their upcoming schedule and it's not coming on again in the near future, but I wouldn't be surprised if ""Queen of Mean"" was broadcast again (Movieplex isn't Showtime or Home Box).When I watch movies like this I always try to find something in the protagonist that is human and real. Because I want to believe that there is something good in everyone; that we are all better than our worst sin. What was most surprising about this film was that behind that vicious, hateful, wild and corrupt exterior Leona Helmsley possessed some type of tangible humanness. In this film it was very difficult to see because Mrs. Helmsley was such a pitiful creature. But if you look very closely it is revealed. And this is when Suzanne Pleshette is especially enigmatic. The scene with Leona and her mother in the hospital was surprising because it showed a certain sensitivity that was otherwise lacking and not seen elsewhere. I also liked the brief parts of Leona with her son because she briefly showed herself without being insecure or afraid of what the rest of the world would say or do.The movie displayed Leona with such an ambitious streak because money, success and status were like a drug to her. It was all that mattered. (She was also an incredible cheapskate who thought nothing of snatching a set of salt and paper shakers on her wedding day.) Perhaps the reason why Leona was so miserable and contemptuous was because she was nothing more than a glorified hooker. What else do you call a woman who sucks and swallows any pulse with a gold card? It's no surprise that the more she bled the beast the more hostile she became. The movie showed the progression steadily and rapidly which was rather intriguing and sad at the same time because the transformation was almost startling. I don't know how all the money in the world could buy someone's integrity but Leona gladly sold her's to the highest bidder.Once Leona sank her fangs into her hubby she was out for blood. Like a rabid animal she wouldn't stop until she got some meat. The more money and the more power she attained, the more she mowed people down. One of the extremely tragic parts in the movie was when Leona ordered her daughter-in-law locked out of her home and had her and her children thrown out on the streets. Why? Because her son had just passed away from a heart attack (go figure!) while he was busy having an affair with another woman. In the words of Leona ""if she had been a better wife she wouldn't have drove him away."" Suzanne Pleshette was incredible during this scene because IMO it was probably the most disturbing in the entire movie and she played it to the hilt. But it wasn't theatrical or melodramatic. I could actually see her face contort and change as she became more and more furious. It really felt like watching a home-movie of what went on in Leona's home.The movie also has a ton of over-the-top scenes that you'll love. It was like watching Freddy Krueger with a Herm&egrave;s handbag. I especially like the part when some young blonde asks Leona if she could steal a dance with her hubby (Lloyd Bridges) and she says without blinking, ""not a chance in hell."" That's right, you snared him, now you stand by your man! There's other funny and dramatic parts, too. Like when Leona sends herself flowers in an attempt to get Harry Helmsley jealous enough to divorce his first-wife and marry her. (Incidentally the movie explained all of this step-by-step; however it wasn't necessary because anyone could tell that she did this purely for attention.) Of course Suzanne Pleshette utters Mrs. Helmsley's famous catchphrase, ""only the little people pay taxes."" Mrs. Helmsley went to her grave denying that she ever said it, though. Maybe she didn't really say it. Maybe she did. But it was a perfect line for the movie and it totally fit the type of despotic character that she was (greedy, greedy, greedy). (It's also important to note that the maid who claimed to overhear the statement testified under oath that it was accurate.)The movie also depicts Leona's tyrannical reign of terror on her staff, associates, colleagues and anyone and everyone who had the terrible misfortune of coming into contact with her. She'd snap her fingers and fire someone on a whim. She'd scream for her PA to get down on his hands and knees and clean her shoes if they got dirty, while she was still wearing them! OMG!!! I loved the part when she fired the security guard who had the nerve to take a phone call in her presence as her assistant told her that he had 5 babies. What was Leona's reply? ""He should've kept his pants on."" (I dunno why but all of a sudden I am reminded of the classic line from ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""let the joyous news be spread, the wicked old witch at last is dead!"")Leona's extreme narcissistic level of control is also articulated. She goes crazy when some lettuce presented to her has a few droplets of water on it. She also goes berserk and throws a promotional deck of cards (made especially for her to celebrate her new hotel) at her staff because it wasn't designed to her specification. It was almost unbelievable to think that all of these violent acts were done by Suzanne Pleshette because she looked and sounded exactly like Leona Helmsley during these unsettling scenes. Like soldiers, Leona also ordered her entire staff to wake up in the middle of the night (no matter what time it was) and put on their uniforms to go outside and wait her to come home from wherever she was off gallivanting at. I know that when Leona was the Queen of The Palace she would personally call back any guest who had a displeasing stay and then profusely promise to fire any of her workers who didn't meet her never-reachable standards. (The ad campaign ""not just perfect, but Helmsley-Perfect"" comes to mind.)Pretty soon it all came thundering down. Like a subway making a rough turn, the movie ends with a rather quick jolt. You know she's coming in for a landing and you know it's going to happen, but when it actually does it never quit lives up to the expectation. I would've loved to have seen Leona in cuffs or in stripes (btw, I put a pic of her real mug shot on this page, if you feel the same way too). Up until the very end the movie displays Leona as this hard-as-steel, acid-tongue lady who is so incredibly out-of-touch with reality and everything else going on around her. In a way I did feel sorry for her. Not because she had to go to prison (because heaven knows she deserved it), but, because she never learned to love herself. I suppose no one else ever could, either.The story of Leona Helmsley is important because it shows what can happen when avarice corrupts a person's level of judgement. Her story is also notable because as a businesswoman she was accomplished but never even had a high school education. Leona was intelligent in so many ways. But as intelligent as she was, that is also how nonsensical she must have been when it came to being a human being. This story is also essential because it depicts a woman with more money than anyone will ever see (billions of dollars) and she was never happy. Never. Nothing made her happy. Not all the money in the world. I hope wherever she is now she is at peace and has found happiness.",5,"if you see your brother standing by the road just stop and say you're going the wrong way, You got to try a little

298369,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,6302156785,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[17, 18]","This made-for-TV movie was based on the novel of the same name, by Piers Randsdell, and follows Randsdell's expose quite well.  While the movie shows determination to show some compassion for Leona Helmsley, more so than the book, the hard, cold fact is that she is a very unlikable person.From her childhood competition against her sisters for her mother's affections, through her first and second marriages, and forward into her opulent life as Mrs. Harry Helmsley, Leona showed admirable determination to better herself.  Unfortunately, what might have been a commendable trait turned into a greed so self-focused that it became a shroud of ugliness rather than a cape of courage.It's hard to believe that an intelligent businessman was so manipulated by this shark in woman's clothing, but only sharks swim with sharks, and Harry Helmsley was no innocent victim to this diabolical schemer.  Leona could have written a book called `How to manipulate stupid rich men', highlighting the parts of inane flattery and a fake engagement to drive Helmsley into a decision.Sharks also only give birth to sharks, and Leona's son Jay follows in his mother's footsteps by embezzling money from the Helmsley's themselves when appointed a cushy position in one of Harry's hotel chains.  Leona did seem to be quite upset when Jay dies of a heart attack at a young age, but the Mean overrules the Queen when she disowns Jay's widow and her own grandchildren, cutting them off completely from any contact or inheritance.From making her assistant wipe her shoes, to firing decorators so that she can take the credit, going off over wet lettuce, furnishing her private home through business purchases, and most of all believing that money allowed her to treat ""little people"" like Dirt, Leona Helmsley is truly the Queen Of Mean.Especially for a made-for-TV movie, The Queen Of Mean is a definite jewel if you can find a copy.  The VHS is hard to find, and it's too much to hope for this well adapted movie to come out on DVD (though my fingers are crossed).  Look for an absolutely spectacular performances from Suzanne Pleshette as Leona Helmsley, and Lloyd Bridges as Harry Helmsley.  Special mention to Raymond Singer as Jay, and a well fleshed out supporting cast.Pleshette and Bridges really make the movie happen, I doubt it would have been as good with any other leads.  I'm lucky enough to have an older VHS copy, so if dramatized biographies are your cup of tea, you may want to seek out a copy of this excellent film.
