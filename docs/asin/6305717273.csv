Unlike some reviewers, I don't mind that the segments are a hodge-podge of other Kathy Smith videos, because I don't have any others by her. This was my introduction. I really like the mix-and-match ability you get with this DVD. It's really using the format to its fullest.Overall, the workouts are pretty good. Kathy indeed is one of those perky, whooping women, which is grating. I'm used to Minna, Karen Voigt, Tamilee ... much more subdued instructors. Once I got past that, though, I couldn't deny that the workouts themselves are pretty effective.The cardio ticked me off at first because it's quite dancy, and I'm not very coordinated. By the second try, though, I had most of the moves down and got a good workout in 20 minutes. The upper-body workout was pretty intense. I really like how this one lets you do higher reps with lighter weights, or do fewer reps with heavier weights. That option alone will keep me coming back to that segment. The lower-body workout is NOT 20 minutes, like the Amazon description and the catalogue on the DVD says. It's 10 minutes. Luckily, it's a very effective 10 minutes. I can feel it today from yesterday's workout. The yoga's good, too, though it stops pretty abruptly as it's pulled off another, longer video. The warm-up and cool downs are OK. I usually don't use them, though; I usually start with another tape (maybe TotalMix's Quick Fix) and cool down with Tamilee's Stretch for Beginners. But it's nice to have them as an option on the same DVD. That way, you don't HAVE to go from one workout tape to another if you don't want to.It would have been nice to have another cardio segment on this tape. I'm sure Kathy knows that variety is key, and we're supposed to do cardio more often than the other exercises. But, all in all, this was a good introduction to Kathy Smith's cheerleader brand of instruction, and it's definitely a good workout.",4,Great idea,1038009600,"11 23, 2002",2002,1950,"['DVD', 'one', 'best', 'formats', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'segments', 'are', 'hodge-podge', 'other', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'others', 'was', 'introduction', 'really', 'mix-and-match', 'ability', 'get', 'DVD', 'really', 'using', 'format', 'fullest.Overall', 'workouts', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Kathy', 'indeed', 'one', 'perky', 'whooping', 'women', 'grating', ""'m"", 'used', 'Minna', 'Karen', 'Voigt', 'Tamilee', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'instructors', 'Once', 'got', 'past', 'could', ""n't"", 'deny', 'workouts', 'are', 'pretty', 'effective.The', 'cardio', 'ticked', 'off', 'first', 'quite', 'dancy', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'coordinated', 'second', 'try', 'had', 'most', 'moves', 'down', 'got', 'good', 'workout', '20', 'minutes', 'upper-body', 'workout', 'was', 'pretty', 'intense', 'really', 'how', 'one', 'do', 'higher', 'reps', 'lighter', 'weights', 'do', 'fewer', 'reps', 'heavier', 'weights', 'option', 'alone', 'will', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'segment', 'lower-body', 'workout', 'NOT', '20', 'minutes', 'Amazon', 'description', 'catalogue', 'DVD', '10', 'minutes', 'Luckily', 'very', 'effective', '10', 'minutes', 'can', 'feel', 'today', 'yesterday', 'workout', 'yoga', 'good', 'too', 'pretty', 'abruptly', 'pulled', 'off', 'longer', 'video', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'downs', 'are', 'OK', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'usually', 'start', 'tape', 'maybe', 'TotalMix', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'cool', 'down', 'Tamilee', 'Stretch', 'Beginners', 'nice', 'have', 'option', 'same', 'DVD', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'HAVE', 'go', 'one', 'workout', 'tape', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'to.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'cardio', 'segment', 'tape', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Kathy', 'variety', 'key', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'cardio', 'more', 'often', 'other', 'exercises', 'was', 'good', 'introduction', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'cheerleader', 'brand', 'instruction', 'definitely', 'good', 'workout']",Kathy Smith's Personal Trainer

474103,A1SWMOHC2S4HB5,6305717273,"Raina Singh ""Mmmarshmallow""","[6, 6]","I ordered this DVD as well as 'The Rules of Fat Burning' when deciding on trying out a Kathy Smith DVD - she's released a lot of content, and truth be told I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin despite reading a lot of reviews.When I saw this DVD and how it combines a lot of material from other workouts onto one disc, I thought, ""Hey what a great idea!"" and got it.  Having no experience with Kathy Smith, and having only done exercise with Denise Austin and Billy Blanks who both couldn't cue to save their lives, exercising with Kathy Smith was very refreshing.On this DVD, she has divided up the program into three sections, and recommended a training schedule to follow to achieve results.  She has a cardio program, a sculpting program and a stretching program.  Here's what they're built like.CARDIO PROGRAM- Warm up; 5mins taken from Functionally Fit: Peak Fat Burning- Workout; 20mins taken from Cardio Fat Burner- Cool down; 7mins taken from Cardio Fat BurnerKathy Smith in the warmup has you doing knee lifts, demi squats, hamstring curls and short walks before stretching out the lower body.  In the cardio segment from Cardio Fat Burner, she does an 'add-on' routine, where moves are taught one by one and added-on in sequence to build an overall routine which is 'taken from the top' several times.  This is different to what I have been used to from Billy Blanks and Denise Austin, where the focus is on short combos, and the change is refreshing and good for a bit of variety.  It is on the dancy side, and while I can do it rather hap-hazardly (the 'box' and 'scissors' moves are on the difficult side, especially at the high tempo that she is going at), I am sure that my mother would trip over herself if she attempted it, so I won't encourage her to have a go at it. The cooldown felt a bit disjointed, since one moment you're finishing off a vigorous cardio routine, and the very next frame you're sitting cross legged on the floor in a zen like state; but I guess thats what is bound to happen when you have a piece-meal DVD like this one.SCULTPING PROGRAM- Warm up; 5mins taken from Functionally Fit: Peak Fat Burning- Upper Body workout; 20mins taken from Lift Weights to Lose Weight- Lower Body workout; 10mins taken from Functionally Fit: Lower Body Firming- Abs & Back workout; 7mins taken from  Lift Weights to Lose Weight- Cool down; 7mins taken from Cardio Fat BurnerFor a bit more variety, I do wish that the warmup and cooldown segments for this sculpting section were different from the cardio section, but this is just a minor thing.  The 20mins of Upper Body strength exercises are taken from the first DVD of Lift Weights to Lose weights, and uses a dual track system to allow viewers the choice between lighter weights with more repititons and heavier weights with fewer repititions.  Kathy takes a moment to explain this after the warmup; I always march in place while she does this to keep my heart rate up.  A bench is used in this workout for one-arm rows, chest presses, and so on and so forth.  I do not have a bench, but I substitute for a chair or a stability ball and it does the job just as well.  The 10mins of Lower Body strength training relies heavily on squats - but she tweaks the exercise enough to keep things interesting; how does one-legged squats sound?  The 7min abs section is effective, and fantastic for someone like me who runs away screaming from long ab workouts even though it is the area of my body that I definitely need to work on.RELAXATION PROGRAM- 30mins taken from New Yoga BasicsI was a bit skeptical about this, and was worried that Kathy Smith might do a Denise Austin take on Yoga - what has subsequently been referred to as 'yogarobics', but was pleased to see that she actually took on the advice of a genuine yoga instructor and pieced together a very gentle practice.  While I think it is no substitute to my Yoga workouts by Sara Ivanhoe and Rainbeau Mars, it is good enough to recover,  rest and relax.This DVD also gives you the ability to build your own routine, something that is used in Denise Austin's 'Personal Training System', and this programming ability is something that I very much like.I shall keep on using this DVD until I can buy the individual DVDs of 'Lift weights to lose weight, 'Cardio Fat Burner' and the Functionally Fit workouts.

It was only a matter of time before Kathy Smith and I crossed paths, so to speak.  *G* I admit to being somewhat disappointed by this DVD at first.  I was sort of expecting something like you can find in Sharon Mann's &quot;The Works&quot; series.  I had also read that Smith is a great fitness trainer with some challenging workouts.  The cardio section, which has a lot of dance/hilo moves, was not very long (30 or so minutes, I think) and not challenging for me, but that is because I've done too much tae bo and boot camp workouts.  I think it might be alright if you have been out of the loop for a while.  The yoga section was okay, but again it's like the cardio section... It will do the job if you've been out of that loop for a while and it is only 30 minutes long.  That leaves me with the body sculpting section.  Now THAT part did make it worth my money!  *G*  I had a set of free weights that had gone unused for too long, and Smith made them feel happy and needed again.  The body sculpting section for the upper body is 20 minutes and for the lower body is only 10 minutes, but that one IS more than what I can handle right now and I am already feeling and seeing results.  These exercises are good if you have been out of the loop a while and/or if you are pressured for time and need a quick workout just to keep it all toned for the other, bigger routines.  I also will add that Smith has a very high-pitched voice and her style very cheerleaderish which does annoy me from time to time depending on my mood.  I'd rather not try to smile while I am doing my pushups.  But I understand about the positive attitude and all.  I just do that part different, focusing on the inside towards my heart.  It works better for me that way.",3,"It's not Ben Hur, just a workout DVD",1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,1825,"['past', 'year', 'half', 'have', 'been', 'quirky', 'sort', 'workout', 'junkie', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'crossed', 'paths', 'so', 'speak', '*G*', 'admit', 'being', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'first', 'was', 'sort', 'expecting', 'something', 'can', 'find', 'Sharon', 'Mann', 'quot', 'Works', 'quot', 'series', 'had', 'also', 'read', 'Smith', 'great', 'fitness', 'trainer', 'challenging', 'workouts', 'cardio', 'section', 'lot', 'dance/hilo', 'moves', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'long', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'think', 'not', 'challenging', ""'ve"", 'done', 'too', 'much', 'tae', 'bo', 'boot', 'camp', 'workouts', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'alright', 'have', 'been', 'loop', 'while', 'yoga', 'section', 'was', 'okay', 'again', 'cardio', 'section', 'will', 'do', 'job', ""'ve"", 'been', 'loop', 'while', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'body', 'sculpting', 'section', 'Now', 'part', 'did', 'make', 'worth', 'money', '*G*', 'had', 'set', 'free', 'weights', 'had', 'gone', 'unused', 'too', 'long', 'Smith', 'made', 'feel', 'happy', 'needed', 'again', 'body', 'sculpting', 'section', 'upper', 'body', '20', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'one', 'more', 'what', 'can', 'handle', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'already', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'results', 'exercises', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'loop', 'while', 'and/or', 'are', 'pressured', 'time', 'need', 'quick', 'workout', 'just', 'keep', 'toned', 'other', 'bigger', 'routines', 'also', 'will', 'add', 'Smith', 'very', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'style', 'very', 'cheerleaderish', 'annoy', 'time', 'time', 'depending', 'mood', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'try', 'smile', 'am', 'doing', 'pushups', 'understand', 'positive', 'attitude', 'just', 'do', 'part', 'different', 'focusing', 'inside', 'heart', 'better', 'way']",Kathy Smith's Personal Trainer
