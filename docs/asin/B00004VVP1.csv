553051,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004VVP1,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[50, 52]","A romanticized but quite accurate account of what is written in I Kings and II Chronicles, this made-for-television film is exceptional and boasts a brilliant international cast and fabulous settings.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, the landscapes are wonderful, and the buildings and set decoration, in warm amber shades, are a visual delight, enhanced by the cinematography of Raffaele Mertes. The terrific score by Patrick Williams also adds much to the atmosphere.The section devoted to the Queen of Sheba has been embelished, but Viveca A. Fox is ravishing as the queen, and it makes for great drama.The emphasis on this part is to show Solomon's destructive tendencies; women were his weakness, and the rationalizations for his behavior his undoing. From Adam to modern history, it's a common story, but in the case of Solomon, what he gave up for his weakness was God's mighty blessing, and the inheritance he would leave his heirs.Ben Cross (&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;) as this complex character is marvelous, and he is surrounded by a superb supporting cast. Though it's hard to take the nordic air from Max von Sydow (who in 1965 played Jesus in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;), he is nevertheless an aging giant of a man as King David, and France's great Anouk Aimee plays Solomon's mother Bathsheba with vigor, as she holds on to the reins of power with tenacity.Other notable performances come from David Suchet (who was so good in the 1998 &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot;) as Joab, Ivan Kaye as Solomon's half-brother Adonijah, and Richard Dillane as the laborer who ultimately rules ten of the twelve tribes, Jeroboam. Even the smallest parts are believable, which reflects on the excellent direction by Roger Young.This is a Bible epic well worth owning for repeated viewing; some of it is poetic, some of it action-packed, often inspiring and thought provoking, and always fascinating.",5,"God made him strong, women made him weak",1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,1911,"['romanticized', 'quite', 'accurate', 'account', 'what', 'written', 'Kings', 'II', 'Chronicles', 'made-for-television', 'film', 'exceptional', 'brilliant', 'international', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'settings.Filmed', 'Quarzazate', 'Morocco', 'landscapes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'buildings', 'set', 'decoration', 'warm', 'amber', 'shades', 'are', 'visual', 'delight', 'enhanced', 'cinematography', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'terrific', 'score', 'Patrick', 'Williams', 'also', 'much', 'atmosphere.The', 'section', 'devoted', 'Queen', 'Sheba', 'been', 'embelished', 'Viveca', 'A', 'Fox', 'ravishing', 'queen', 'great', 'drama.The', 'emphasis', 'part', 'show', 'Solomon', 'destructive', 'tendencies', 'women', 'were', 'weakness', 'rationalizations', 'behavior', 'undoing', 'Adam', 'modern', 'history', 'common', 'story', 'case', 'Solomon', 'what', 'gave', 'up', 'weakness', 'was', 'God', 'mighty', 'blessing', 'inheritance', 'would', 'leave', 'heirs.Ben', 'Cross', 'quot', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'quot', 'complex', 'character', 'marvelous', 'surrounded', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'hard', 'take', 'nordic', 'air', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', '1965', 'played', 'Jesus', 'quot', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'quot', 'nevertheless', 'aging', 'giant', 'man', 'King', 'David', 'France', 'great', 'Anouk', 'Aimee', 'Solomon', 'mother', 'Bathsheba', 'vigor', 'reins', 'power', 'tenacity.Other', 'notable', 'performances', 'come', 'David', 'Suchet', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', '1998', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'quot', 'Joab', 'Ivan', 'Kaye', 'Solomon', 'half-brother', 'Adonijah', 'Richard', 'Dillane', 'laborer', 'who', 'ultimately', 'rules', 'ten', 'twelve', 'tribes', 'Jeroboam', 'Even', 'smallest', 'parts', 'are', 'believable', 'excellent', 'direction', 'Roger', 'Young.This', 'Bible', 'epic', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'poetic', 'action-packed', 'often', 'inspiring', 'thought', 'provoking', 'always', 'fascinating']",N/A

Well, it is playable! All modern VCR's sold in Australia can play (and some can record) NTSC tapes. I have found this very useful as 'Solomon' and the other movies in this series have never been released in Australia.'Solomon' is a solid, well acted drama (what do you expect, with Ben Cross taking the leading part). I found the first part of the movie quite entertaining, with plenty of action, as old King David's reign comes to an end and two brothers compete for the throne.With the sequences dealing with the building of the Temple, I felt that little respect was paid to the holiness of the dwelling place of God, or of the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon treated the Holy of Holies with triviality. The inside of the temple walls were covered with gold, so the makers of the set should have paid more attention to detail.Overall, the movie is well done, with a bit of laid back humour, especially when Solomon greets all his children after a hard day at the 'office'.

The settings were gorgeous. The actors were well chosen.As far as accuracy, I suspect there's a broad range, with some scriptural and some right out of someone's creative mind. It did put things in better perspective for me and I'll enjoy reading those stories in the Bible much more after watching it.EDITED to say that I had to go to the Bible and read I Kings and the Song of Songs, just to see what was actually there and what wasn't.I was amazed that so many things I had just skimmed over in the past when I read were so much more interesting now. They were real people and their relationships are a little easier for me to understand (and care about) now.One amusing thing that I DIDN'T find in the Bible was elephants in the caravan of the Queen of Sheba. It mentioned camels, but no elephants. That makes sense to me because they were crossing the desert, which camels are equipped to do, but I don't think elephants could handle it. I may be wrong, of course.I'm reading ""Wisdom's Daughter"" at the same time, a book that tells the story from first one character, then another.

This is probably the nicest series of Bible stories available. The photography is beautiful, as well as the costumes, props and sets; the acting of the main characters is superb, likeable and believable; and the scripts usually stay very close to the actual Bible verses.Genesis is the only stinker in this set. It is nothing like the other 3. The Genesis DVD has nice photography, but it does NOT act out the Bible scenes like the other three movies do! Genesis just narrates a reading of the book of Genesis, while showing contemporary desert people going about their daily lives.If you are undecided about buying the whole set, then I would suggest buying at least one of these separately. &quot;Jeremiah&quot; is my favorite, and it really captures the attitude of a humble prophet being persecuted by the wayward Israelites. &quot;Esther&quot; is probably the most accurately told of these three good movies. It is a pretty clear storytelling, where the other movies sometimes change the order of events (but still portray the overall message accurately). &quot;Solomon&quot; covers the biggest chunk of Scripture, retelling many scenes of the life of Solomon and what Solomon wrote in the Bible.I would rate the Genesis movie with 1 star, for being so misleading as to its content.

553065,A2RV78U1G3MGLH,B00004VVP1,Fredrick L. Murphy,"[9, 9]","As with several of the other movies in the Bible Collection/The Bible series done by these folks, you will mostly enjoy this one.  There's a pretty accurate Biblical following here, and no hiding the errors (nor the grandeur) of Solomon's life.  Sometimes (of course, it's Hollywood and not from Bible scholars eh?) Solomon's words in the Bible are used in questionable ways/scenarious, but alas, it's not completely pathetic or anything.Sexuality is borderline at 2 points in the long film (completely bare back shot of Solomon going to a towel from the tub, & Solomon kissing down the navel of what is basically ""hidden"" of the naked Queen from Sheba).This film focuses heavily on King Solomon's weakness towards the women (which is not something to be hidden, but we don't think BIBLICAL movies need to show the sensuality in a modern ""nudity-type"" way).  The Queen of Sheba is used for a little romance tossed in for the ladies out there &lt;grin>.  You are reminded in this film that Solomon started out fairly well, and worthy of being a faithful son unto King David & unto the God of Israel, but who then falls rapidly and loses MUCH character & faithfulness until the end of his reign on his death bed.  The setting for his son and the House of Israel's rebellion also are understood thru this film.You'll enjoy the many lessons therein.  However, we recommend fast forwarding thru the 10 seconds or less of Solomon going for his towel and of him kissing down the Queen's front side.  We would like to recommend adding this one too, to anybody's Biblical movie shelf.  But we have one exception which we'll address last herein.It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but....The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will ever approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

The segment regarding Queen Sheba. I have researched my scriptures and I find nothing either in the Book of Kings or Chronicles that gives truth to the interpretation of the story in the movie. Queen Sheba came to Solomon to question his great knowledge. She brought gifts and observed all he did with his people. Solomon in turn gave gifts to the Queen and she returned to her own land. There is no love affair or marriage or child mentioned in the scriptures between Solomon and Queen Sheba. She is not mentioned in the Bible as one of Solomons wives nor is a child mentioned.

In this 3 hour historical epic Ben Cross(Dark Shadows Revival Series, First Knight) plays Solomon. His mother Bathsheba is old and King David played by Max Von Sydow is dying. Bathsheba played by Anouk Aimee tells her son that he was chosen by God to be king.The only problem is that Solomon's brother Adonijah stands in his way as next in line to the throne of Israel. Adonijah was David's fourth son by a minor wife. Bathsheba and Nathan want Solomon to be King while the people and General Joab want Adonijah to be the next king. Nathan and Bathsheba convince the dying David to proclaim Solomon king. Adonijah flees, then later asks for the hand of a beautiful maiden called Abishag the Shunammite. She is also David's nurse. Joab goes against David's wishes and plans to proclaim Adonijah king. When this reaches the ear of David he gives orders to have Joab taken. Joab has had General's Abner and Amasa killed which displeases David. Joab is brought before David and he declares that Joab will live as long as he lives. Upon his death Joab's life will be in the hands of Solomon. After Solomon is declared king Bathsheba convinces Solomon to have Adonijah and Joab killed! Adonijah and Joab both die at the end of the rebellion. Then Solomon is declared king.  Solomon being a lover of women as it says in the Bible takes many, many foreign wives as well as Hebrew wives. Then the beautiful Queen of Sheba played by Vivicia A. Fox comes to Israel to hear of the wisdom of Solomon. Sheba was called Saba a nation spanning the Red Sea. She was the Queen of Egypt and Ethiopia according to some sources. Saba was on the coasts of what is Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen in Arabia Felix. The people of Saba in southern Arabia(Yemen) called the Sabeans settled in Ethiopia and Somalia and intermarried with the Africans. The people of Sheba were Cushites. Solomon receives this great Queen and falls madly in love with her. It is  against the priests wishes that he marry her and make her Queen of Israel. So she goes back to her country. According to Ethiopian accounts they were lovers and the Queen of Sheba had a son by Solomon. His name was Menelik I king of Axum. He founded a dynasty that would reign as the Christian Empire of Ethiopia for 2900 years. Then in the movie as in the Biblical account all of Solomon's wives turn his heart. Solomon turns to the Ashtoreth goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. Soon Solomon is told by a prophet that the kingdom will be ripped from him and given to his servant Jeroboam. When Solomon is told this he orders Jeroboam's death. Soon Solomon dies naming Rehoboam his successor. The ten tribes of Israel refuse to follow Rehoboam.  So there is  a split. Rehoboam  rules the southern kingdom of Judah and Jeroboam rules the kingdom of Israel. This is a sweeping epic about the wisest king on earth.

Overall, it is quite faithful to the Scriptures except for the Queen of Sheba. In this movie, she becomes his wife. In any case, the movie does a terrific job showing Solomon's faithfulness transitioning to his turning away from God.The producers also take some license in small areas where they integrate concepts from Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes into the movie. However, the point they're trying to highlight in those scenes comes through quite clear (and accurately). If you're like me, someone who doesn't like a lot of license in dealing with Scriptural truth, you will be able to enjoy the movie without a lot of distractions from the non-Scriptural parts.This movie isn't for small children due to some violence in it.
