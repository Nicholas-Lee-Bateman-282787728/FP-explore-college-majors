447780,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305081832,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Consider me a gigantic fan of this story, period.  The short story (very short) by Steinbeck is phenomenal, and both adaptations (that I've seen) are great.For me though, this 1939 film version trumps the 1992 version by maintaining a smooth naturalism and emotional resonance that transcends mere depression but actually capitalizes on hope.  Mainly, this is due to the way George is portrayed.  For me, Gary Sinise was the weak link in the 1992 version, playing George with too much agitation to make his emotional connection with Lenny feel genuine.  Sure, that final scene still made me ball like a baby, but with this splendid version, Burgess Meredith delivers such an outstanding portrayal of earnest and humble love that I was really moved by him.The story is simple yet very profound.  During the depression, George and Lennie struggle to find work.  They have dreams of owning a place of their own yet they lack the financial ability to make those dreams come true, yet they still hold to them.Firmly.Lennie, having been kicked in the head by a horse, is slower than the average man.  He is a big man, too big, for his childlike behavior gets him into trouble when his manlike physic comes into play.  Finally with work, Lennie and George find themselves closer to realizing their dream, but when tragedy strikes, in the form of a beautiful woman and a horrible accident, their dreams are shattered almost instantly.I went on a pretty long explanation a few years back when reviewing the novel, so I won't really harp on it too much here.  The story is a universal story of loneliness, hopelessness and humanity.  Every character is longing for something, and every character is being held back and thus sharing in the holding back of those around them.  There are your central characters (Lennie and George) and their obvious trials and aspirations, but there are also the lives of Mae, Curley, Candy and Crooks.  They all are lacking basic essentials to human happiness, and in their attempt to find it they alienate and even jeopardize the happiness of those around them.But, what this film adaptation does that the 1992 version doesn't is add a layer of hopefulness.  I don't mean that in an absolute sense, because the film is a downer and very depressing, but the way the characters are played shows that they haven't completely lost their hope, becoming cynical and pessimistic.  In the '92 version there is a lot of distilled agitation that bleeds through in the delivery of all the characters except Lennie (both Malkovich and Chaney Jr. are equally outstanding in their portrayals of Lennie Smalls).  Here though, there is an almost cheeryness, like optimism is still at their fingertips.That is why Burgess Meredith should have been nominated for the Oscar.  Sure, Jimmy Stewart should have won, but Meredith should have been a close runner-up.  His beautifully composed portrayal of George (caretaker, friend, worker, dreamer) is so complete and so moving.  Just the way he shows mutual excitement when discussing his future plans with Lennie (an aspect of the '92 version I really didn't like, for George's frustration with Lennie's constant badgering about the rabbits gave George an air of destitute irritation) gives me a soft smile and a warm soul.I won't say that the films conclusion is less heartbreaking than the '92 version, but it carries with it a sense of purity that dampens the pain.The film is a knockout.  I prefer this to the '40 adaptation of Steinbeck's `The Grapes of Wrath'.  For me, `Of Mice and Men' really captures not just the authenticity of the situation and the reality of the desperation, but it captures the human spirit in all of its forms, showing us the harsh as well as the soft realities of what it is that makes us human in the first place.",5,"Poignant, even today!",1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,3799,"['Consider', 'gigantic', 'fan', 'story', 'period', 'short', 'story', 'very', 'short', 'Steinbeck', 'phenomenal', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'great.For', '1939', 'film', 'version', '1992', 'version', 'maintaining', 'smooth', 'naturalism', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'mere', 'depression', 'actually', 'hope', 'Mainly', 'due', 'way', 'George', 'portrayed', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'was', 'weak', 'link', '1992', 'version', 'playing', 'George', 'too', 'much', 'agitation', 'make', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Lenny', 'feel', 'genuine', 'Sure', 'final', 'scene', 'still', 'made', 'ball', 'baby', 'splendid', 'version', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'delivers', 'such', 'outstanding', 'portrayal', 'earnest', 'humble', 'love', 'was', 'really', 'moved', 'him.The', 'story', 'simple', 'yet', 'very', 'profound', 'depression', 'George', 'Lennie', 'struggle', 'find', 'work', 'have', 'dreams', 'owning', 'place', 'own', 'yet', 'lack', 'financial', 'ability', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'yet', 'still', 'hold', 'them.Firmly.Lennie', 'having', 'been', 'kicked', 'head', 'horse', 'slower', 'average', 'man', 'big', 'man', 'too', 'big', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'trouble', 'when', 'manlike', 'physic', 'play', 'Finally', 'work', 'Lennie', 'George', 'find', 'closer', 'realizing', 'dream', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'form', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'horrible', 'accident', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'almost', 'instantly.I', 'went', 'pretty', 'long', 'explanation', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'reviewing', 'novel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'harp', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'story', 'universal', 'story', 'loneliness', 'hopelessness', 'humanity', 'character', 'longing', 'something', 'character', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'thus', 'sharing', 'holding', 'back', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'Lennie', 'George', 'obvious', 'trials', 'aspirations', 'are', 'also', 'lives', 'Mae', 'Curley', 'Candy', 'Crooks', 'are', 'lacking', 'basic', 'essentials', 'human', 'happiness', 'attempt', 'find', 'alienate', 'even', 'jeopardize', 'happiness', 'them.But', 'what', 'film', 'adaptation', '1992', 'version', ""n't"", 'add', 'layer', 'hopefulness', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'absolute', 'sense', 'film', 'downer', 'very', 'depressing', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'completely', 'lost', 'hope', 'becoming', 'cynical', 'pessimistic', ""'92"", 'version', 'lot', 'distilled', 'agitation', 'delivery', 'characters', 'Lennie', 'Malkovich', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'are', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'portrayals', 'Lennie', 'Smalls', 'Here', 'almost', 'cheeryness', 'optimism', 'still', 'fingertips.That', 'why', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Sure', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Meredith', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'close', 'runner-up', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'portrayal', 'George', 'caretaker', 'friend', 'worker', 'dreamer', 'so', 'complete', 'so', 'moving', 'Just', 'way', 'mutual', 'excitement', 'when', 'discussing', 'future', 'plans', 'Lennie', 'aspect', ""'92"", 'version', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'George', 'frustration', 'Lennie', 'constant', 'badgering', 'rabbits', 'gave', 'George', 'air', 'destitute', 'irritation', 'soft', 'smile', 'warm', 'soul.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'films', 'conclusion', 'less', 'heartbreaking', ""'92"", 'version', 'sense', 'purity', 'pain.The', 'film', 'knockout', 'prefer', ""'40"", 'adaptation', 'Steinbeck', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'Mice', 'Men', 'really', 'not', 'just', 'authenticity', 'situation', 'reality', 'desperation', 'human', 'spirit', 'forms', 'showing', 'harsh', 'as', 'well', 'soft', 'realities', 'what', 'human', 'first', 'place']",Of Mice and Men

447784,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6305081832,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","I know I'm going way against the curve here. This movie is filled with fine actors, and faithfully tells a Steinbeck story that English/Literature teachers love for some reason.However, I think that Chaney's performance as the dim-witted Lenny is really just adequate. To me it seems forced and overplayed. Charles Bickford probably has the most balanced performance in the film. Most of the others are pretty one dimensional. In fact, Lenny's character isn't the only dim-witted one. The son of the boss and the son's wife are none too sharp, and neither is the one-handed man. Burgess Meredith is OK, but doesn't hit a home run.Now, I like good dramas more than the next guy, but I like to be at least entertained or educated in some way by a serious drama. I found nothing entertaining or educational about Steinbeck's story. His cruelty to virtually every character just turned me off. If you can get a life lesson out of ""Don't let someone shoot your dog because they think its a good idea"", then maybe you learn something here. Lenny's problems are not something that are going to be encountered by many in their lives. The look at the problems in the marriage are shallow, and marriage problems have been much more meaningfully and skillfully portrayed in at least hundreds of films.But what about the emotional wringer this movie unleashes?!? ""I'm so sad when the dog is shot"", gush some reviewers. I'm sorry, that's just one of the oldest and cheapest tricks in the business. Kill a dog in a movie, and many people will cry.

447785,A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,6305081832,"brewster22 ""brewster22""","[5, 6]","This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh,fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing. Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event. The men in this film are quite literally living day to day, and the comparison of mento dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device. Like dogs, these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use, and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came. Being shot like a dog put out of its misery by its owner really was preferable to the alternatives awaiting them.I was surprised about how candid this film was, and how bravely it tackled some of the thornier issues of Steinbeck's novel. The incident between Lenny and Mae is divested of some of its sexual overtones, but much is implied anyway. And a scene between Crooks, a black work hand, and some of the other workers, in which Crooks explains in blunt language what it means to be black, tackles race relations as honestly as many films today.Moments of this film are almost unbearably sad and poignant, but never in that over-sentimental way common to Hollywood films of this time period. Burgess Meredith is terrific in the role of George; he expertly conveys--without ever directly addressing it--the bond he has with Lenny and the degree to which Lenny is as much George's savior as he is Lenny's. Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-wearyworker. The cast's weak links are Betty Field--hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten--and Lon Chaney as Lenny, though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale.John Ford's adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" from the following year gets all of the attention today, and one hardly ever hears of ""Of Mice and Men."" But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's, and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for bringing Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen.Grade: A",5,Hits You Like a Gut Punch,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2306,"['screen', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'classic', 'novel', 'harsh', 'fantastic', 'film', 'took', 'wind', 'frank', 'brutal', 'depiction', 'desperation', 'longing', 'Movies', 'Depression', 'were', 'actually', 'made', 'time', 'Depression', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'spoke', 'necessity', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'later', 'movies', 'treat', 'Depression', 'historical', 'event', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'literally', 'living', 'day', 'day', 'comparison', 'mento', 'dogs', 'running', 'motif', 'film', 'feels', 'more', 'just', 'poetic', 'device', 'dogs', 'men', 'were', 'faced', 'scary', 'prospect', 'day', 'being', 'more', 'use', 'was', 'system', 'place', 'take', 'care', 'when', 'day', 'came', 'Being', 'shot', 'dog', 'put', 'misery', 'owner', 'really', 'was', 'preferable', 'alternatives', 'awaiting', 'them.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'candid', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'bravely', 'tackled', 'thornier', 'issues', 'Steinbeck', 'novel', 'incident', 'Lenny', 'Mae', 'divested', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'much', 'implied', 'anyway', 'scene', 'Crooks', 'black', 'work', 'hand', 'other', 'workers', 'Crooks', 'blunt', 'language', 'what', 'be', 'black', 'tackles', 'race', 'relations', 'as', 'honestly', 'many', 'films', 'today.Moments', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'sad', 'poignant', 'never', 'over-sentimental', 'way', 'common', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'time', 'period', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'terrific', 'role', 'George', 'expertly', 'conveys', 'ever', 'directly', 'addressing', 'bond', 'Lenny', 'degree', 'Lenny', 'as', 'much', 'George', 'savior', 'Lenny', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'also', 'excellent', 'rough', 'world-wearyworker', 'cast', 'weak', 'links', 'are', 'Betty', 'Field', 'hopelessly', 'overplaying', 'bored', 'sex', 'kitten', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Lenny', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'action', 'film', 'finale.John', 'Ford', 'adaptation', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'following', 'year', 'attention', 'today', 'one', 'hardly', 'ever', 'Mice', 'Men', 'much', 'what', 'great', 'Ford', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'credit', 'laying', 'fine', 'blueprint', 'bringing', 'Steinbeck', 'beautiful', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'screen.Grade']",Of Mice and Men

Burgess Meredith (best known as The Penguin in the 1960s BATMAN and Mickey from the ROCKY franchise) and Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of silent film super star Lon Chaney and is best known as Larry Talbot in the classic film, THE WOLFMAN) star as George and Lennie. Burgess Meredith was the best actor as George, he was happy at the right time in the film and he was angry at the right time on film. Robert Blake was too kind as George in the 1981 remake and Gary Sinise was to much of an [...] as George in the 1992 remake.

447802,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6305081832,Martin Asiner,"[14, 19]","The America of the 1930s was a hodgepodge of geography, but the terrain that most movie audiences could relate to was either Tara from GONE WITH THE WIND or the bitter dust bowls of the parched west. Director Lewis Milestone perfectly caught this sense of dry dust mingled with human walls of self-constructed isolation in the filmed version of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. America was still caught in the tail end of a decade long depression that seemed quite capable of extending itself for yet another. Since America was not yet involved in Europe's troubles, it was natural for Hollywood to focus on internal matters that reflected the dust that seemed to settle everywhere. Lenny Small (Lon Chaney, Jr) and George Milton (Burgess Meredith) symbolized the alienation between man and an uncaring society. Bindlestiffs like them existed only as punching bags for anyone with a grudge to settle. The only solution for forced isolation was to painfully build an enduring relation with someone who cared. As Lenny tells George incessantly about how 'I got you and you got me,' the viewers could see that maybe he was right.Lenny and George are two tramps who seek only a place to call their own. To George, land is physical; it will provide security against the uncertainties of a dust bowl existence. To Lenny, land is internal; it is more of a time than a place. It represents a time to pet rabbits and feel the closeness engendered by the proximity of those rabbits to George. Both are fleeing from the rape charges shouted out by a woman in the previous town against the hulking, dim-witted Lenny. All Lenny wanted was to pet a pretty thing. Both escape to find work on a ranch, but the loneliness that plagued them as a pair on the road they learn afflicts others too. Nearly everyone on the ranch is isolated in one way or another. The most tragic loneliness is the one belonging to Mae, the neglected wife of Curly, whose own loneliness forces him to seek meaningful contact with his fists. Mae is a sexy flirt who might have been happy with a man who could have torn down the high walls of her own isolation, but Curly simply builds them higher as he makes sure that his jealousy keeps her increasingly deprived of human contact. Mae reaches out to the uncomprehending Lenny, and in her words to him of her need to impact on others, the audience can see that a twin set of monologues does not add up to a dialogue. Each is talking at not to one another. Lenny touches her hair and becomes excited enough not to hear her protests. He breaks her neck, and all he knows is that George will know that he 'done a bad thing.' The climax occurs when George finds Lenny hiding but is aware that a vigilante posse is just minutes away. George understands that the only service that one friend can do for the other is to kill Lenny. The scene that George kills Lenny is one of the most heart-rending in film. George again conjures up the mystery time and place that will let Lenny find a cure for his isolation. As George speaks, Lenny responds and for a brief moment actually is transported to the rabbit warren. The gunshot, like the reverberations of the horns that tumbled the walls of Jericho, similarly restore the isolation that had always been the status quo of all concerned.OF MICE AND MEN is noteworthy for many reasons, but an often unappreciated factor is the movie's point of view. Lenny, rather than George, is seen as the protagonist. He is in nearly every scene, and he is the focus of discussion when he is not. The audience tends to see the action from his perspective, even if George is the one who performs as a chorus, interpreting it. The movie seems to suggest that while the walls of isolation are high indeed, the need to break them down is one that lies in the souls of all concerned. Just ask Mae or Lenny.",5,Of Mice and Men: Of Lenny and Loneliness,1024531200,"06 20, 2002",2002,3836,"['America', '1930s', 'was', 'hodgepodge', 'geography', 'terrain', 'most', 'movie', 'audiences', 'could', 'relate', 'was', 'either', 'Tara', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'bitter', 'dust', 'bowls', 'parched', 'west', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'perfectly', 'caught', 'sense', 'dry', 'dust', 'mingled', 'human', 'walls', 'self-constructed', 'isolation', 'filmed', 'version', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN', 'America', 'was', 'still', 'caught', 'tail', 'end', 'decade', 'long', 'depression', 'seemed', 'quite', 'capable', 'extending', 'yet', 'America', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'involved', 'Europe', 'troubles', 'was', 'natural', 'Hollywood', 'focus', 'internal', 'matters', 'reflected', 'dust', 'seemed', 'settle', 'everywhere', 'Lenny', 'Small', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr', 'George', 'Milton', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'symbolized', 'alienation', 'man', 'uncaring', 'society', 'Bindlestiffs', 'existed', 'only', 'punching', 'bags', 'anyone', 'grudge', 'settle', 'only', 'solution', 'forced', 'isolation', 'was', 'painfully', 'build', 'enduring', 'relation', 'someone', 'who', 'cared', 'Lenny', 'George', 'incessantly', 'how', 'got', 'got', 'viewers', 'could', 'see', 'maybe', 'was', 'right.Lenny', 'George', 'are', 'two', 'tramps', 'who', 'seek', 'only', 'place', 'call', 'own', 'George', 'land', 'physical', 'will', 'provide', 'security', 'uncertainties', 'dust', 'bowl', 'existence', 'Lenny', 'land', 'internal', 'more', 'time', 'place', 'time', 'pet', 'rabbits', 'feel', 'closeness', 'engendered', 'proximity', 'rabbits', 'George', 'are', 'fleeing', 'rape', 'charges', 'shouted', 'out', 'woman', 'previous', 'town', 'hulking', 'dim-witted', 'Lenny', 'Lenny', 'wanted', 'was', 'pet', 'pretty', 'thing', 'escape', 'find', 'work', 'ranch', 'loneliness', 'plagued', 'pair', 'road', 'learn', 'others', 'too', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'ranch', 'isolated', 'one', 'way', 'most', 'tragic', 'loneliness', 'one', 'belonging', 'Mae', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Curly', 'own', 'loneliness', 'forces', 'seek', 'meaningful', 'contact', 'fists', 'Mae', 'sexy', 'flirt', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'torn', 'down', 'high', 'walls', 'own', 'isolation', 'Curly', 'simply', 'higher', 'sure', 'jealousy', 'increasingly', 'deprived', 'human', 'contact', 'Mae', 'out', 'uncomprehending', 'Lenny', 'words', 'need', 'impact', 'others', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'twin', 'set', 'monologues', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'dialogue', 'talking', 'not', 'one', 'Lenny', 'touches', 'hair', 'becomes', 'excited', 'enough', 'not', 'hear', 'protests', 'neck', 'George', 'will', 'know', 'bad', 'thing', 'climax', 'when', 'George', 'Lenny', 'hiding', 'aware', 'vigilante', 'posse', 'just', 'minutes', 'away', 'George', 'only', 'service', 'one', 'friend', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'kill', 'Lenny', 'scene', 'George', 'Lenny', 'one', 'most', 'heart-rending', 'film', 'George', 'again', 'up', 'mystery', 'time', 'place', 'will', 'let', 'Lenny', 'find', 'cure', 'isolation', 'George', 'speaks', 'Lenny', 'brief', 'moment', 'actually', 'transported', 'rabbit', 'warren', 'gunshot', 'reverberations', 'horns', 'tumbled', 'walls', 'Jericho', 'similarly', 'restore', 'isolation', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'status', 'quo', 'concerned.OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN', 'noteworthy', 'many', 'reasons', 'often', 'unappreciated', 'factor', 'movie', 'point', 'view', 'Lenny', 'rather', 'George', 'seen', 'protagonist', 'nearly', 'scene', 'focus', 'discussion', 'when', 'not', 'audience', 'see', 'action', 'perspective', 'even', 'George', 'one', 'who', 'chorus', 'interpreting', 'movie', 'suggest', 'walls', 'isolation', 'are', 'high', 'indeed', 'need', 'break', 'down', 'one', 'souls', 'concerned', 'Just', 'ask', 'Mae', 'Lenny']",Of Mice and Men
447803,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,6305081832,Mr Peter G George,"[31, 31]","The greatest year ever for the movies was undoubtedly 1939. Of Mice and Men was a member of the class of '39 and was also one of the ten films to be nominated for best picture that year. Competing against Gone With the Wind it had little chance of winning, but merely to be nominated that year was an achievement. Of Mice and Men is one of the great films and one of the best adaptations of a novel. Only The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden can compete with it as an adaptation of Steinbeck. The film is not as well known as it ought to be, which is a pity as it has a deeply felt story and some superb performances. It really shows the hardships of being a poor farmhand in depression era America and includes many details which give the setting authenticity. Burgess Meredith is wonderful as George while Lon Chaney Junior is a revelation as Lennie. Chaney is probably best known for his horror roles as The Wolf Man, but these roles don't really show his acting ability. Only in his brief role in High Noon does he show the acting ability that is so clearly evident from his performance in Of Mice and Men. George and Lennie's friendship and interdependence forms the heart of the film, but the film is also about loneliness. This is especially shown with regard to two characters, Crooks played by Leigh Whipper, who is excluded from the rest of the workers because of the colour of his skin, and Mae played by Betty Field, whose jealous husband wont allow her to talk to anyone. Field had a great acting talent and her film roles are very distinctive. Here she shows the loneliness and desperation for human contact of a woman who has married the wrong man. It is her search for some warmth that leads her to Lennie and this has unforeseen consequences for everyone. Both Lennie and Mae are unconscious of their actions, they can't see ahead and thus both are like children. What makes the film so great is that it does not judge them. The characters in the film are just people with various strengths and weaknesses. The story is thus very true to life and believable.The print used for the Image DVD is superb. The picture quality could hardly be better with clear, sharp and detailed images. The black and white photography is truly beautiful. Unfortunately the sound quality is less good.

447805,A31QEAZMJWBF28,6305081832,NMdesapio,"[2, 3]","John Steinbeck's classic novella OF MICE AND MEN has also been a 1939 movie, a stage play, and an opera; it was remade as a movie in 1992, with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.  I haven't seen the remake, but I can say that the 1939 version, under review here, is a near-perfect movie.  Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr. are George and Lennie, the eternal, wandering pair whose only sense of home, of security, is found in each other.  The tiny Meredith (later of TWILIGHT ZONE and ROCKY fame) is perfect as quick-witted George.  I might add that while the novella's dialogue contains much swearing, this movie has none - yet one still gets a sense of George's acerbity from Meredith's exceptional performance.  The hulking Chaney is also ideal as slow-witted Lennie; as much as I admire Malkovich, I find it hard to imagine the role of Lennie played with more conviction, wonder, and unaffected pathos than it is here.  The film, with its Depression-era California setting, is beautifully photographed.  Like the novella, it is brief; no scene is longer than it needs to be, yet each scene makes an impact.  The musical score by Aaron Copland is not mentioned enough:  the composer's jagged, western-inspired style could not be more apt for Steinbeck; like Steinbeck's writing, its true genius is in its brevity.  The one and only ""wrong note"" in the movie is Betty Field as ""Curly's wife,"" Mae, who brings about her own and Lennie and George's destruction.  Lennie is supposed to be fascinated by Mae's soft hair, but there is nothing soft about Field's performance, and this lonely, victimized woman comes across as a none-too-bright tramp.  I can't help thinking that the role must certainly be played with more sympathy in the remake, but I still give five stars to the original OF MICE AND MEN.",5,Near Perfection,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,1802,"['John', 'Steinbeck', 'classic', 'novella', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN', 'also', 'been', '1939', 'movie', 'stage', 'play', 'opera', 'was', 'remade', 'movie', '1992', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'remake', 'can', 'say', '1939', 'version', 'review', 'here', 'near-perfect', 'movie', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'are', 'George', 'Lennie', 'eternal', 'wandering', 'pair', 'only', 'sense', 'home', 'security', 'found', 'other', 'tiny', 'Meredith', 'later', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'ROCKY', 'fame', 'perfect', 'quick-witted', 'George', 'might', 'add', 'novella', 'dialogue', 'much', 'swearing', 'movie', 'none', 'yet', 'one', 'still', 'sense', 'George', 'acerbity', 'Meredith', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'hulking', 'Chaney', 'also', 'ideal', 'slow-witted', 'Lennie', 'as', 'much', 'admire', 'Malkovich', 'find', 'hard', 'imagine', 'role', 'Lennie', 'played', 'more', 'conviction', 'wonder', 'unaffected', 'pathos', 'here', 'film', 'Depression-era', 'California', 'setting', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'novella', 'brief', 'scene', 'longer', 'be', 'yet', 'scene', 'impact', 'musical', 'score', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'not', 'mentioned', 'enough', 'composer', 'jagged', 'western-inspired', 'style', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'Steinbeck', 'Steinbeck', 'writing', 'true', 'genius', 'brevity', 'one', 'only', 'wrong', 'note', 'movie', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Curly', 'wife', 'Mae', 'who', 'own', 'Lennie', 'George', 'destruction', 'Lennie', 'supposed', 'be', 'fascinated', 'Mae', 'soft', 'hair', 'nothing', 'soft', 'Field', 'performance', 'lonely', 'victimized', 'woman', 'across', 'none-too-bright', 'tramp', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'role', 'must', 'certainly', 'be', 'played', 'more', 'sympathy', 'remake', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'original', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN']",Of Mice and Men

I first saw it when I was 11 years old, and it shocked and saddened me the same way the Zapruder film did when I first saw it. (In other words, I burst quite unexpectedly into tears. I hadn't read the Steinbeck short novel yet.) I became a lifelong fan of Aaron Copland, the composer of the film's score, and I already liked Lon Chaney because of the Wolfman and Mummy movies, and also Burgess Meredith, pre-Batman and pre-Rocky. All I can say is, in addition to the very moving Candy's dog sequence, the end of the film in which the music softly swells up while the squirrel runs up the tree and the leaves fall has to be one of the most affecting scenes ever made. Also I found that as I grew older, the plight of Curley's wife Mae touches me profoundly. Just thinking of Slim saying ""poor kid, I shoulda let her talk"" makes me kinda sorta a little bit weepy. *sigh* a real gem. (And it's not really in B&W, but sepia.)

Lon Chaney gives his most memorable performance (apart from his portrayal's as tormented wolf man, Lawrence Talbot) as the immensely strong, but simple-minded Lennie. Burgess Meredith, in a fine performance too, plays his jaded travelling companion, George Milton. The two men seek work on a farm bucking barley, but their situation quickly darkens due to the aggressive, bullying attitudes of the owners son, Curley (well acted by serial cowboy, Bob Steele) and his bored and lonely wife, Mae (Betty Field)In addition to this masterly casting, there is marvellous support lent by Charles Bickford as the straightforward head ranch hand, Slim.....Noah Beery Jr. as the kind hearted and easy going cowpoke, Whit....and noted stage actor Roman Bohen is simply unforgettable as the crippled old timer, Candy.

Director Lewis Milestone, in making this film, broke that almost inevitable mold, rehandled the material and made it move in the flow-eddy-flow style of the screen and yet kept the essentials of events and characters true to their author's conception, which was, in itself the director's triumph.  The story about two unfortunate men who dreamed a dream of having a home of their own, with a garden to eat from, working for themselves with no boss to rout them out of bed in the morning, the privilege of loafing or going to the circus without anyone's permission......Just ""bindle stiffs"", migratory farm workers tramping from job to job, this dream meant heaven-on-earth to them, but things happened, those fatal things that can't be called anyone's fault, and their plans went astray.  As the painfully pathetic Lennie, Lon Chaney, Jr. had the role of his career (his WOLFMAN is decidedly a close second).  Milestone soft-peddled Lennie to a considerable degree, and toned down a lot of Steinbeck's violence, to say nothing of his profanity.  The unique Burgess Merideth is fine as George while the underrated Betty Field does commendable work as the flirtatious Mae.  Steinbeck's tragedy was theatrical but Milestone and Eugene Solow's script gave it dignity, inevitability and an unusual strain of excitement.",5,A CLASSIC FROM 1939,1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,1458,"['MICE', 'AND', 'MEN', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'stage', 'naturally', 'scene', 'divisions', 'lot', 'drama', 'presented', 'dialogue', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'making', 'film', 'broke', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'mold', 'rehandled', 'material', 'made', 'move', 'flow-eddy-flow', 'style', 'screen', 'yet', 'kept', 'essentials', 'events', 'characters', 'true', 'author', 'conception', 'was', 'director', 'triumph', 'story', 'two', 'unfortunate', 'men', 'who', 'dreamed', 'dream', 'having', 'home', 'own', 'garden', 'eat', 'working', 'boss', 'rout', 'bed', 'morning', 'privilege', 'loafing', 'going', 'circus', 'anyone', 'permission', 'Just', 'bindle', 'stiffs', 'migratory', 'farm', 'workers', 'tramping', 'job', 'job', 'dream', 'meant', 'heaven-on-earth', 'things', 'happened', 'fatal', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'called', 'anyone', 'fault', 'plans', 'went', 'astray', 'painfully', 'pathetic', 'Lennie', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'had', 'role', 'career', 'WOLFMAN', 'decidedly', 'close', 'second', 'Milestone', 'soft-peddled', 'Lennie', 'considerable', 'degree', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'Steinbeck', 'violence', 'say', 'nothing', 'profanity', 'unique', 'Burgess', 'Merideth', 'fine', 'George', 'underrated', 'Betty', 'Field', 'commendable', 'work', 'flirtatious', 'Mae', 'Steinbeck', 'tragedy', 'was', 'theatrical', 'Milestone', 'Eugene', 'Solow', 'script', 'gave', 'dignity', 'inevitability', 'unusual', 'strain', 'excitement']",Of Mice and Men
447813,AK61LQI92GTCH,6305081832,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[52, 53]","John Steinbeck's masterful story of friendship is definitively brought to screen in Lewis Milestone's 1939 OF MICE AND MEN. This is a terrific movie, essential viewing for anyone with a tolerance for black and white.  The story is so universal and cleanly told this one is hard not to become deeply engrossed in.Lon Chaney Jr., rightfully, is the chief reason we remember this movie.  He nails the role of the feeble-minded Lennie, who wants nothing more than to tend his rabbits.  I've never seen this movie before, and I was surprised at how effective Burgess Meredith was as Lennie's friend and protector, George.  If Chaney steals most of the scenes he's in, Meredith is the reliable engine, grounded in humanity, that draws us in.OF MICE AND MEN has been remade once, in 1992, in a production starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.  For all of Malkovich's talents, I still prefer Chaney's performance.  More importantly, the 1939 production was contemporaneous with Steinbeck's novel.  If the latter movie is a period piece, the 1939 version is current events, and that does make a difference.Get out the hankies and get ready to be deeply moved.

447814,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,6305081832,Susan,"[11, 14]","I have watched over 600 classic films in my study and enjoyment of classic film. I have watched many films made from a novel--Anna Karenina, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, A Farewell to Arms, etc. It seems there is always something missing in movies adapted from a novel...a film cannot always grasp the depth and ""mind thoughts"" of a book, for a book is more for the mind and the reader's own inner vision and imagination, and a film must deal with the outwardly visual, and so being, much can be lost in the film story. However, was I surprised when I found this DVD at the library and brought it home to watch. It was amazing! I read ""Of Mice and Men"" as a required novel in high school back in the late 70's. I remember liking the story, and I bought my own copy of the book (just as I did with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn) and I read it over and over as the years went by. I haven't read it in several years, but when watching this film, I remembered everything that happened. I wasn't sure I was going to like Burgess Meredith as George, but he was very good. And the same with Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie, and Betty Field as Curley's wife. Once the movie began, I felt these actors did a very good job portraying the characters as Steinbeck had them in his book. I was surprised with the realism of the film...quite gritty for 1939. Usually films really watered down issues and emotions back then, but this one was surprisingly quite open about them. I rarely cry watching a film, and this film had me crying...you felt so sorry for Lennie, for Candy losing his dog, for the 3 of them losing their ""dream"", and the ending...that was just an incredible ending for a 30's film. At our house we do not have TV and we carefully screen movies the children watch, and we stick to the classic years (1950's and prior) 98% of the time. I know some precodes, etc. are not for children, but I didn't think this film would be too strong for a child. Yes, because of the code, nothing was shown outright, but my 8 yr. old son really cried and was very sad when the gunshot sounded and Candy rolls over in his bunk. My son knew his dog was shot, and it was a strongly emotional scene without seeing anything! And my son cried when Lennie was in the barn with his little puppy who was dead from him being a bit too rough with him. Again, we don't see the dead puppy, but the implied idea is so strong, again my son burst into tears. I felt really bad for not being more careful for my son and his feelings; had I known this film was going to be so strongly emotional, I would have watched it when my son was in bed. I then knew I could not let him see the end; I figured if these 2 scenes of the dogs dying were so hard for him because of the implied realism and strong emotions, then the ending was going to be too. I was right, it was. And the final scene with George and Lennie is so well done, you felt what they were feeling. I was really crying...like I said, not many movies do this to me!  I think the direction and filming was well done; some interesting camera work caught my eye. I can't believe this movie is so ""forgotten""; it is just as great or even better than some of the other 1939 films- Gone With the Wind, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and MUCH better than The Wizard of Oz! I found I understand the story much better as an adult than I did in my youth. It is funny that schools make teens read these novels; because teens have not experienced life fully enough, they cannot fully grasp the truths of life such novels are presenting. Maybe some can, but I never did! Always, it was when I was older, got married, had children, experienced the routine and sorrows of life, that I could relate to such books; for I now have ""been there"" too. As an adult I could see the parallel of Candy's dog and Lennie. I never understood that when I was a teen in school. Anyway, this is an excellent film that no person who appreciates classic film should miss. I am glad I discovered it, and will definitely watch it again. I hear there are ""film as literature"" classes in schools now, and I would highly recommend this 1939 version of ""Of Mice and Men"" for such a class. Do please heed my warning though: if you watch this at home and have young children do not let them watch it with you; children are not ready to handle the strong emotions presented in this film. I would say wait until your child is at least 12 yrs. old.",5,"THE BEST ""Novel adaption"" film I have ever seen!",1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,4405,"['have', 'watched', '600', 'classic', 'films', 'study', 'enjoyment', 'classic', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'made', 'novel', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'A', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'etc', 'always', 'something', 'missing', 'movies', 'adapted', 'novel', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'grasp', 'depth', 'mind', 'thoughts', 'book', 'book', 'more', 'mind', 'reader', 'own', 'inner', 'vision', 'imagination', 'film', 'must', 'deal', 'outwardly', 'visual', 'so', 'being', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'film', 'story', 'However', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'found', 'DVD', 'library', 'brought', 'home', 'watch', 'was', 'amazing', 'read', 'Mice', 'Men', 'required', 'novel', 'high', 'school', 'back', 'late', '70', 'remember', 'liking', 'story', 'bought', 'own', 'copy', 'book', 'just', 'did', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'read', 'years', 'went', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'several', 'years', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'remembered', 'everything', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'George', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'same', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'Lennie', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Curley', 'wife', 'movie', 'began', 'felt', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Steinbeck', 'had', 'book', 'was', 'surprised', 'realism', 'film', 'quite', 'gritty', '1939', 'Usually', 'films', 'really', 'watered', 'down', 'issues', 'emotions', 'back', 'then', 'one', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'quite', 'open', 'rarely', 'cry', 'watching', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'crying', 'felt', 'so', 'sorry', 'Lennie', 'Candy', 'losing', 'dog', '3', 'losing', 'dream', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'incredible', 'ending', '30', 'film', 'house', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'TV', 'carefully', 'screen', 'movies', 'children', 'watch', 'stick', 'classic', 'years', '1950', 'prior', '98', '%', 'time', 'know', 'precodes', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'child', 'Yes', 'code', 'nothing', 'was', 'shown', 'outright', '8', 'yr.', 'old', 'son', 'really', 'cried', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'gunshot', 'sounded', 'Candy', 'rolls', 'bunk', 'son', 'knew', 'dog', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'strongly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'seeing', 'anything', 'son', 'cried', 'when', 'Lennie', 'was', 'barn', 'little', 'puppy', 'who', 'was', 'dead', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'rough', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dead', 'puppy', 'implied', 'idea', 'so', 'strong', 'again', 'son', 'burst', 'tears', 'felt', 'really', 'bad', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'careful', 'son', 'feelings', 'had', 'known', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'strongly', 'emotional', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'bed', 'then', 'knew', 'could', 'not', 'let', 'see', 'end', 'figured', '2', 'scenes', 'dogs', 'dying', 'were', 'so', 'hard', 'implied', 'realism', 'strong', 'emotions', 'then', 'ending', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'too', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'final', 'scene', 'George', 'Lennie', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'felt', 'what', 'were', 'feeling', 'was', 'really', 'crying', 'said', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'think', 'direction', 'filming', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'camera', 'work', 'caught', 'eye', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'so', 'forgotten', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'even', 'better', 'other', '1939', 'films-', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'found', 'understand', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'adult', 'did', 'youth', 'funny', 'schools', 'make', 'teens', 'read', 'novels', 'teens', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'life', 'fully', 'enough', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'grasp', 'truths', 'life', 'such', 'novels', 'are', 'presenting', 'Maybe', 'can', 'never', 'did', 'Always', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'got', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'experienced', 'routine', 'sorrows', 'life', 'could', 'relate', 'such', 'books', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'adult', 'could', 'see', 'parallel', 'Candy', 'dog', 'Lennie', 'never', 'understood', 'when', 'was', 'teen', 'school', 'Anyway', 'excellent', 'film', 'person', 'who', 'classic', 'film', 'should', 'miss', 'am', 'glad', 'discovered', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'hear', 'are', 'film', 'literature', 'classes', 'schools', 'now', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', '1939', 'version', 'Mice', 'Men', 'class', 'Do', 'please', 'heed', 'warning', 'watch', 'home', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'watch', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'ready', 'handle', 'strong', 'emotions', 'presented', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'wait', 'child', 'least', '12', 'yrs', 'old']",Of Mice and Men
