At first, scaring kids and living a life without rules seems great, but soon, Brian realizes that he has been lured into becoming a monster, himself! LITTLE MONSTERS is better left to fond remembrances, since the film does not play nearly as well to the older crowds as it does for its intended younger audiences. Howie Mandel performs his third-rate 'Beetlejuice' impersonation as the monster, Maurice, whose wackiness is way more annoying than entertaining. While the story here certainly has potential, the limited budget and shabby production quality take away from the overall enjoyment of the film, although elements of the plot can be seen in Disney's wildly successful animated feature, MONSTERS, INC.

Two critically acclaimed critics did a scathing review of the movie but the movie still had its fan base. Besides who cares about the wayward opinions of the same high brow Beavis and Butthead critics that gave Speed 2: Booze Control two thumbs up? Exactly, now lets move on.Story: Eric Stevenson(Fred Savage) moves into a different state and has a hard time adjusting there. He later on befriends a mischievous monster named Maurice(Howie Mandell) that is easily harmed by bright lights. Eric and Maurice become friends and they visit Maurice underworld home. Later on Eric's brother is kidnapped by the same creature that bullies Maurice as well as the ruler of that underworld and now has to rely on the help of Maurice as well as a friend and a former bully to help him retrieve his brother.This movie brings back a lot of memories and after seeing it recently it still holds well after all these years. Howie Mandell is hilarious as the wise-cracking but fun-loving Maurice. Fred Savage as well as the rest of the cast is good also. I love the imagination of the writers also. Sure the movie has some dark undertones but as I kid I loved it and as an adult I still love it. The sets are creative down to the monsters. Now for the people that are comparing Maurice to Beetlejuice, there is a stark contrast there: Maurice is a likable doofus with a heart that sometimes takes his antics to far(like using hands to chew up an unlucky person's homework). Beetlejuice, on the other hand is an unlikable creep that put his ulterior motives before anything else. There is a very big difference in character there.Little Monsters is one of those movies that defined childhood memories of the 80s. You cant mention great movies that defined the 80s without mentioning Little Monsters. That's like talking about movies that defined the 90s without mentioning T2: Judgment Day. Its impossible.Plus Little Monsters is not only creative and unique but its also fun to watch something that is absent from a lot of movies nowadays. You remember the word ""fun"" right? Its what movies used to be before they became mundane and extremely repetitive. I recommend this movie to anybody that is a fan of 80s movies and I also dare you to not get choked up in the final scene where Maurice says goodbye to Eric. You look at me and tell me that scene doesnt move you to tears. Ahh, the memories. Movie like this are the reason why people always go back to the 80s and after the recent crop of garbage out now who can blame them?",5,"""You're the ugliest friend I've ever had""",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2612,"['remember', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Snooty', 'critics', 'ripped', 'shreds', 'kids', 'loved', 'Two', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'critics', 'did', 'scathing', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'fan', 'base', 'who', 'wayward', 'opinions', 'same', 'high', 'brow', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'critics', 'gave', 'Speed', '2', 'Booze', 'Control', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Exactly', 'now', 'move', 'on.Story', 'Eric', 'Stevenson', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'different', 'state', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'there', 'later', 'befriends', 'mischievous', 'monster', 'named', 'Maurice', 'Howie', 'Mandell', 'easily', 'harmed', 'bright', 'lights', 'Eric', 'Maurice', 'become', 'friends', 'visit', 'Maurice', 'underworld', 'home', 'Later', 'Eric', 'brother', 'kidnapped', 'same', 'creature', 'Maurice', 'as', 'well', 'ruler', 'underworld', 'now', 'rely', 'help', 'Maurice', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'former', 'bully', 'help', 'retrieve', 'brother.This', 'movie', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'seeing', 'recently', 'still', 'well', 'years', 'Howie', 'Mandell', 'hilarious', 'wise-cracking', 'fun-loving', 'Maurice', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'also', 'love', 'imagination', 'writers', 'also', 'Sure', 'movie', 'dark', 'undertones', 'kid', 'loved', 'adult', 'still', 'love', 'sets', 'are', 'creative', 'monsters', 'Now', 'people', 'are', 'comparing', 'Maurice', 'Beetlejuice', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Maurice', 'likable', 'doofus', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'antics', 'far', 'using', 'hands', 'chew', 'up', 'unlucky', 'person', 'homework', 'Beetlejuice', 'other', 'hand', 'unlikable', 'creep', 'put', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'anything', 'else', 'very', 'big', 'difference', 'character', 'there.Little', 'Monsters', 'one', 'movies', 'defined', 'childhood', 'memories', '80s', 'cant', 'mention', 'great', 'movies', 'defined', '80s', 'mentioning', 'Little', 'Monsters', 'talking', 'movies', 'defined', '90s', 'mentioning', 'T2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'impossible.Plus', 'Little', 'Monsters', 'not', 'only', 'creative', 'unique', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'something', 'absent', 'lot', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'remember', 'word', 'fun', 'right', 'what', 'movies', 'used', 'be', 'became', 'mundane', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anybody', 'fan', '80s', 'movies', 'also', 'dare', 'not', 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Maurice', 'goodbye', 'Eric', 'look', 'tell', 'scene', 'doesnt', 'move', 'tears', 'Ahh', 'memories', 'Movie', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'always', 'go', 'back', '80s', 'recent', 'crop', 'garbage', 'out', 'now', 'who', 'can', 'blame']",N/A
