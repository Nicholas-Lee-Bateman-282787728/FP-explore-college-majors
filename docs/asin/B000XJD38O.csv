1114426,A1KZSONTO7854P,B000XJD38O,"J. Allison ""Uncle Joe""","[4, 4]","The movie COMMANDER HAMILTON was not all that bad. The movie had some problems in that it was obviously dubbed and hard to understand at times and the plot was formulaic but the action was good in some scenes and at times reached the level of a James Bond movie. Also, Mark Hamill makes a pretty good villain, sort of like Luke Skywalker gone to the dark side. There's a gross scene at the beginning of the movie involving chain saws and body parts but I didn't think it was that bad. This movie was made in the late '90s and is somewhat dated now so you can get it cheap. I bought my copy for three bucks. I spent an evening watching it and enjoyed it far more than the usual stuff on TV. I think I got my money's worth out of it, so while it isn't a great movie it was entertaining enough to earn three stars.",3,Not that bad,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,811,"['movie', 'COMMANDER', 'HAMILTON', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'problems', 'was', 'obviously', 'dubbed', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'plot', 'was', 'formulaic', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'scenes', 'times', 'reached', 'level', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Also', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'pretty', 'good', 'villain', 'sort', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'gone', 'dark', 'side', 'gross', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'involving', 'chain', 'saws', 'body', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'late', ""'90s"", 'somewhat', 'dated', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'bought', 'copy', 'three', 'bucks', 'spent', 'evening', 'watching', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'more', 'usual', 'stuff', 'TV', 'think', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'so', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'earn', 'three', 'stars']",Commander Hamilton
