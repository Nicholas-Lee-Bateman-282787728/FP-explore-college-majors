855074,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B0004Z33DM,Amanda Pike,"[1, 1]","For a very long time I was on a quest to find a faithful film adaptation of Frankenstein that followed the plot and physical appearance of the creature from the novel. Just last week a friend suggested I check out the 2004 version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss as the creature. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised to find that it would be Hallmark that finally made a version of Frankenstein that actually followed the novel.The film from 1994 actually called ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" was not as faithful as the title would imply. It had the creature bald with a distorted eye and speaking like a stroke victim. It also had Elizabeth's heart torn out of her chest and then brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature.For years after that I had searched for a version of Frankenstein that had a creature portrayed the way he is described in the novel.First let us begin with the popular idea of the Frankenstein monster. Everyone imagines the creature as a simple minded, green skinned creature with a flat topped head, and bolts in his neck.I don't understand the popularity of the ""simple minded"" Frankenstein creature. I know it was popularized over eighty years ago now thanks to Boris Karloff but think about it. In the actual novel the creature figured out how to dress himself (and that he'd need clothes!) in a matter of moments after his ""birth"". He learned to read and write (or remembered it) in a matter of months. That's equatable to an eleven-month-old baby with an adult reading level. He could read, write, was as articulate as his creator, if not even more so. He even had a favorite work of literature (Paradise lost). That's not a simple minded creature. That's a super genius in the making. I'd like to see more intelligent incarnations of the Frankenstein creature but not pretentious (as he was pretentious in the film Van Helsing). For good intelligent incarnations of the creature check out the 2004 Hallmark version of Frankenstein staring Luke Goss, Ultrasylvania (web comic / graphic novel), and perhaps to a lesser extent (because he still moves and talks like a stroke victim) the Robert de Niro version.Not only did this version (The Hallmark version from 2004 starring Luke Goss as the creature) have the creature physically look like, talk like, and move like the literary version of the creature but it also restored one of the novel's secondary morals. Everyone remembers that Frankenstein teaches you not to tamper with nature but that was not really the main moral of the novel at all.  In fact the ""going too far with science"" thing isn't quite accurate either as the creature was created (in the novel) with science AND alchemy.  Most people forget that Victor ran from his responsibilities and had to learn to take responsibility, particularly paternal responsibility.  Some of his tragedy also came from not keeping promises.  He broke his promise to the creature which lead to the creature's second quest for revenge. The original story, and this film, also had the creature learn (a bit too late) that revenge was not the answer and that revenge would bring him no peace. In my opinion this was important. So why do so many film versions leave this aspect of the story out all together?  Why are only the inaccurate or incomplete versions remembered? It's not fair that this version of Frankenstein is almost entirely obscure.Here's where I am going to get a little nitpicky.  It's a very good adaptation.  The biggest changes deal with Victor's mother's death (in the novel she dies before he sees lightning strike a tree, not after).  Also later in the story another body (after Elizabeth's death) is blamed on the creature in a village but it could be that someone died by coincidence that the creature (happening to be there) got blamed for it. Oh, and the creature's eyes. They're blue in this and yellow in the book. And Victor's father lives but seems to be going crazy.  In the novel I thought he committed suicide.  But these are petty details.  This version is probably the most faithful I've seen.  And the creature is VERY accurate.The creature is the best thing about this film.  If you want to see the creature the way Mary Shelley intended him to be, watch this version of Frankenstein.  Admittedly there are a few dull parts and some parts that felt unnecessary as filler and dragged on a bit but this was the most faithful adaptation of the book and is unfortunately highly under-rated.  Luke Goss is simply the best portrayal of the creature I have ever seen.",5,The most faithful portrayal of the creature!,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,4546,"['very', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'quest', 'find', 'faithful', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Frankenstein', 'followed', 'plot', 'physical', 'appearance', 'creature', 'novel', 'Just', 'last', 'week', 'friend', 'suggested', 'check', '2004', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'starring', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'creature', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'would', 'be', 'Hallmark', 'finally', 'made', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'actually', 'followed', 'novel.The', 'film', '1994', 'actually', 'called', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'Frankenstein', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'title', 'would', 'imply', 'had', 'creature', 'bald', 'distorted', 'eye', 'speaking', 'stroke', 'victim', 'also', 'had', 'Elizabeth', 'heart', 'chest', 'then', 'brought', 'back', 'style', 'Frankenstein', 'creature.For', 'years', 'had', 'searched', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'had', 'creature', 'portrayed', 'way', 'described', 'novel.First', 'let', 'begin', 'popular', 'idea', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'Everyone', 'creature', 'simple', 'minded', 'green', 'skinned', 'creature', 'flat', 'topped', 'head', 'bolts', 'neck.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'popularity', 'simple', 'minded', 'Frankenstein', 'creature', 'know', 'was', 'popularized', 'eighty', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'think', 'actual', 'novel', 'creature', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'dress', ""'d"", 'need', 'clothes', 'matter', 'moments', 'birth', 'learned', 'read', 'write', 'remembered', 'matter', 'months', 'equatable', 'eleven-month-old', 'baby', 'adult', 'reading', 'level', 'could', 'read', 'write', 'was', 'as', 'articulate', 'creator', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'had', 'favorite', 'work', 'literature', 'Paradise', 'lost', 'not', 'simple', 'minded', 'creature', 'super', 'genius', 'making', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'intelligent', 'incarnations', 'Frankenstein', 'creature', 'not', 'pretentious', 'was', 'pretentious', 'film', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'good', 'intelligent', 'incarnations', 'creature', 'check', '2004', 'Hallmark', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'staring', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Ultrasylvania', 'web', 'comic', '/', 'graphic', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'lesser', 'extent', 'still', 'talks', 'stroke', 'victim', 'Robert', 'de', 'Niro', 'only', 'did', 'version', 'Hallmark', 'version', '2004', 'starring', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'creature', 'have', 'creature', 'physically', 'look', 'talk', 'move', 'literary', 'version', 'creature', 'also', 'restored', 'one', 'novel', 'secondary', 'morals', 'Everyone', 'remembers', 'Frankenstein', 'not', 'tamper', 'nature', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'main', 'moral', 'novel', 'fact', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'science', 'thing', ""n't"", 'quite', 'accurate', 'creature', 'was', 'created', 'novel', 'science', 'AND', 'alchemy', 'Most', 'people', 'forget', 'Victor', 'ran', 'responsibilities', 'had', 'learn', 'take', 'responsibility', 'particularly', 'paternal', 'responsibility', 'tragedy', 'also', 'came', 'not', 'keeping', 'promises', 'broke', 'promise', 'creature', 'lead', 'creature', 'second', 'quest', 'revenge', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'creature', 'learn', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'revenge', 'was', 'not', 'answer', 'revenge', 'would', 'bring', 'peace', 'opinion', 'was', 'important', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'versions', 'leave', 'aspect', 'story', 'together', 'Why', 'are', 'only', 'inaccurate', 'incomplete', 'versions', 'remembered', 'not', 'fair', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'almost', 'entirely', 'where', 'am', 'going', 'get', 'little', 'nitpicky', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'biggest', 'changes', 'deal', 'Victor', 'mother', 'death', 'novel', 'lightning', 'strike', 'tree', 'not', 'Also', 'later', 'story', 'body', 'Elizabeth', 'death', 'blamed', 'creature', 'village', 'could', 'be', 'someone', 'died', 'coincidence', 'creature', 'happening', 'be', 'there', 'got', 'blamed', 'Oh', 'creature', 'eyes', ""'re"", 'blue', 'yellow', 'book', 'Victor', 'father', 'be', 'going', 'crazy', 'novel', 'thought', 'committed', 'suicide', 'are', 'petty', 'details', 'version', 'probably', 'most', 'faithful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'creature', 'VERY', 'accurate.The', 'creature', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'creature', 'way', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'intended', 'be', 'watch', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'Admittedly', 'are', 'few', 'dull', 'parts', 'parts', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'filler', 'dragged', 'bit', 'was', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'unfortunately', 'highly', 'under-rated', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'simply', 'best', 'portrayal', 'creature', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Frankenstein artisan
855075,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0004Z33DM,Andrew Raker,"[5, 6]","This is my favorite ""Frankenstein"" production because it is the most faithful adaptation to Shelley's novel. Some people might argue that the creature is too beautiful. There may be some truth to this. However, the creature appears relatively comparable to the earliest mid-19th century sketches of Frankenstein's creature. Therefore, the beauty of the creature is not an issue for me.The film is DEFINITELY much more accurate that ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh. THAT adaptation should have been entitled ""Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein.""Positives of this 2004 adaptation:-  Film is 204 minutes, which allows the plot to progress less rapidly than in many previous adaptations.-  Film clearly shows how obsessed Victor was with his creature as well as the impact that the death of his mother brought to Victor's desire to creature life where there was once death.- The creature has the ability to talk proficiently. Therefore, the creature is able to express its loneliness and is longing for acceptance.- The creature does not seem inherently evil but rather a being that grows bitter (and hateful) over time because of the way he is treated by people, especially by his `father' (i.e. Victor).- The creature definitely considers Victor to be his father in this film adaptation.Significant Changes:- Robert Walton (Donald Sutherland in 2004) is an elderly man.- Frequently there are short flashback scenes to the arctic. [My Note: This can become annoying after a while.]- Victor suffers hallucinations where he sees people who are already dead.- Victor's relationship with Dr. Waldman is developed considerably further than in the novel.Other Changes for those absolute loyalists [essentially, the minor changes that really do not matter very much]:Film adds a dog named Bruno who is run over by a carriage.Victor's mother (Caroline) dies of scarlet fever just before Victor leaves for the university of Ingolstadt. [Her illness was sudden and unexpected. In other words, she did not catch the illness from attending anyone who was ill.]Henry joins Victor in the carriage on the way to the university. Henry plans to receive a liberal education in ancient history.Dr. Waldman becomes Victor's adviser.While studying at university, Victor sees another dog run over by another speeding carriage. Victor experiments on the dog, bringing it back to life for a short time.One night while Victor is in the graveyard, gravediggers beat him up for apparently no reason except that he was in the graveyard late at night. [My Note: This scene does not make much sense, unless the scriptwriter is trying to imply that this assault is a warning from God for Victor to stop his desire to create life from death.]Victor shares his success with Dr. Waldman. However, Dr. Waldman tells Victor that trying to bring humans back to life is wrong.Elizabeth helps nurse Victor back to health.The DeLacey family consists only of grandfather DeLacey, his son and his son's wife, and their approximately 7-year-old daughter, Eva.The creature forms a relationship with grandfather DeLacey and Eva, both of which appear to accept the creature. [My Note: It appears as if the scriptwriter is trying to communicate that the blind and little children would accept the creature when adults who can see would not.] Therefore, Eva's father drives the creature away in a similar manner to that described in the novel.Creature does not burn down the DeLacey cabin. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the DeLacey family ever leaves the cabin.No townspeople ever shoot at the creature nor does the creature ever try to rescue a drowning girl.Film conveys that the creature accidentally strangles William.Victor tells the judge that he believes a large creature murdered William. The judge refuses to listen to Victor believing Victor is just making up a story to save Justine. [Note: This is a contrast to the novel, where Victor does nothing to try to save Justine.]The creature observes Justine's hanging. Victor sees the creature in the back of the crowd. Later, the creature takes Justine's dead body from the scaffolds and tells her corpse: ""Forgive me. Forgive me.""The creature sneaks up into Victor's room when Victor is sleeping and leaves him a map. The map apparently tells Victor where the creature wants Victor to meet himVictor has an opportunity to shoot his creature with a revolver yet does not during the time when the two are conversing on the top of the mountain. It appears as though Victor's guilt is the reason for his refusal to murder his creature.Note: The film does appear to also imply that the creature is born a heterosexual. Therefore, the film goes against the idea that the creature developed heterosexual tendencies. Because of this, it would be more difficult for Victor to consent to create a second male creature for companionship to the first male creature because the first male creature clearly wants a female creature and children. [My Note: It is still unclear to me why the children of this creature would need to be hideously deformed unless we assume that Victor has created a new species from the bodies of deceased humans.]Victor returns to Ingolstadt to create his female being. While there, Professor Waldman visits Victor in the hope of preventing Victor from making a second terrible mistake.Later, Henry also visits Victor. The film implies that Victor tells Henry everything about his past experiments. Henry tries to dissuade Victor from creating a female creature.Victor burns his nearly finished female creature in front of his male creature's eyes. One can absolutely tell how upset this makes Victor's male creature.Victor and Henry take the body of the female creature to a river. Victor disposes the body in the middle of the river. During this time, the creature strangles Henry. Victor is accused of Henry's murder.Elizabeth and Victor's father take Victor home. Victor tells neither his father nor Elizabeth about his experiments or the creature.Just before their marriage, Victor wishes to tell Elizabeth about his creature, but Elizabeth says that she does not want to hear anything bad about Victor or Victor's past until after they are married.After the marriage, while in a country hotel, Victor is again about to tell Elizabeth when he hear someone at the window. Victor looks out the window and sees a hooded man running away. Victor thinks this being is his creature. He ells Elizabeth to stay put and chases after the man with his revolver drawn. When Victor catches up with this man, he discovers that the creature made the man run away as a deco. Victor returns to his hotel room to discover that his creature has strangled Elizabeth.While holding Elizabeth's dead body, Victor observes the creature through the window. Victor fires at the creature through the glass window and then chases the creature from the hotel into a nearly lake. During this time, Victor is continuously firing at his creature. It is assumed that Victor probably has wounded his creature. However, eventually Victor loses sight of his creature.Victor returns to Ingolstadt to see Dr. Waldman.While in Ingolstadt, Victor reads in a newspaper about a monster terrorizing villages. Victor travels to the village on horseback where he finds the entire village attending a funeral service for the people killed by the creature. At this point, it appears that the creature has declared a war, of sorts, on humanity. [Note: This is different that in the novel, where the creature does not harm innocent people, but rather limits his vengeance on those Victor loves.]As Victor dies, he hallucinates that he sees Elizabeth.Final scene of the film shows the creature carrying Victor's body into the Arctic wilderness during a blizzard. [Note: The assumption is that the creature dies.]FINAL THOUGHTS:While some potential viewers might find (1) this production to drag on a bit, and (2) some of the minor actors to play their roles poorly, I believe that adaptation is worthy enough to purchase, especially if you can purchase it used for five to seven dollars. The adaptation is 4:3 aspect ratio, which also might disappoint some viewers. However, even with these potential negatives, I found the film worthy of my time. It certainly is the best choice currently available and really focuses on the scientific consequences of Victor's creating life.",5,My Favorite Frankenstein Production (4.5 stars),1281657600,"08 13,

855077,A1RQPU98Q7EG0J,B0004Z33DM,Bradley Beard,"[32, 33]","I just finished watching this 4 hour epic masterpiece and have to say this is the most accurate portrayal of Mary Shelley's novel yet. We have all seen Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee portray the Creature and although these are extremely classic in filmgoers minds eyes (mine included), there has never been an adaptation that has followed the events in the book so closely. When Kenneth Brannaugh originally announced he was filming ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", I was very happy that someone was going to film the novel. Well, this turned out to be my biggest movie going disappointment ever. The reality is that I don't think anyone could ever film a worse version than that on such an overblown budget. Hollywood has always had a history of butchering probably the one of the most intellegent horror novel ever written...UNTIL NOW!I had no expectations for this film due to the fact it is a made for TV movie. Considering it was also a production of the USA network, I had my hesitations. I just decided to watch it by chance only because of the name and was completely won over. From the very first scenes with Donald Sutherland as the captain of the Prometheus when he finds Frankenstein in the arctic to the amazing scenes of the creature's first breath. WOW!! This is incredibly powerful stuff. Not only are the portrayals and sequence of events true to the book but the laboratory equipment (which has always exceded the technology of the times in past movies) is what you would expect without being overdone. In my opinion, the creation scene is one of the most powerful ever filmed. I do NOT diminish the Clive/Karloff version in any way because that is truly the MOST classic but this is what you envision when you read the book. The only element that wasn't really played upon that Mary Shelley explained in great depth in the novel was Frankenstein's involvement in Alchemy. But with the detail to which every other element of the novel has been recreated, this can be overlooked. In the novel, the creation sequence is extremely vague, to say the least. This adaptation gives a very understated yet compelling portrayal.On to the creature. Again, no disrespect to the classics, but the boxed heads, green complexions, bolts, and overly scarred interpretations are gone. The creature also has a very understated makeup that is fittingly perfect. Mary Shelley describes a being with long, black hair, yellow complexion, and sunken eyes. This is what we get!! Perfect!! Truly beautiful in it's  horror. The creature is portrayed with amazing pathos and intelligence. The scene of realization after he is chased from the house by the blind man's son and he looks at his reflection in the water is absolutely brilliant. When he beckons to God in regards to his appearance...I am at a loss for words.Every portrayal in this adaptation is played perfectly and with great understanding of the novel. I love to watch movies with Donald Sutherland so enough has been said right there. William Hurt as Dr. Waldman is (do I dare say it?) brilliant.

I own about 12 versions of the novel on DVD, and this one is the best by far.  It's the closest to Shelley's original novel; the few additions made don't detract from the spirit of the novel and don't distort (as Branagh's version does) her themes or characterizations.  What I love most about is that the creature is quite young and, while still horrifying, not so monstrous as to make us forget that Victor intended to create a beautiful being (i.e., you can see the potential handsomeness despite his sickly hue and a few visible scars).  His youth makes it easier to understand that the creature is initially an infant, despite his stature--one abandoned by his ""father"" and left to learn from the random persons and experiences he comes across.  All this makes it easier to empathize with him and to ask the question: Was it his inate nature or the lack of nurture that made him into a ""monster""?  My only real quibble is that while Donald Sutherland gives a fine performance, the difference between his and Walton's age and Victor's takes away from the doubling Shelley intended.OK, a lot of this review sounds pretty academic.

855079,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B0004Z33DM,Cowboy Buddha,"[5, 5]","I am not ordinarily a fan of horror-type films but my wife is so, when we saw that this version of Frankenstein was a Hallmark production, we decided to give it a try. For the most part, we were impressed - particularly with the depiction (and performance) of the Creature and with the apparent fidelity to Mary Shelley's book. Much more of a melodrama with occasional horror touches, interspersed with bits of philosophy. The production looked good with the Slovakian locations especially impressive. Some of the first part did seem to drag a bit but Kevin Connor's direction was his usual reliable stuff. The acting, as often happens on these big productions, was rather uneven. I'm not convinced Alec Newman is a strong enough actor to carry a three hour-plus film. But Luke Goss as the very gothic Creature certainly got the viewers' emotions involved.Overall, quite a good production. I'm glad we sat and watched it (in a single sitting) but there are a few irritating aspects about the production that would make me hesitate to sit through it again. The non-stop background music is frequently unnecessary, intrusive, and not very good. And Nicole Lewis's whiny little girly voice grew progressively annoying - so much so that we actually welcomed her demise. Other bits simply made me wonder: such as what was the great French actor Jean Rocheforte doing in this and why did William Hurt have a German accent when no one else did?Still, it's probably the best, or at least most faithful, film version of Frankenstein so far. Entertaining without being scary.

855080,A3HN4OZBYVDTU6,B0004Z33DM,"Crypt ""thecrypt777""","[128, 129]","Ever since I experienced the mild disappointment of Kenneth Branagh's film ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"", I had dreamed that someone somewhere would finally do a truly faithful film version of the greatest horror story ever told. I think I may have found what I was looking for in this three and a half hour long gothic melodrama. Most of Shelly's story is left completely intact with only some minor changes and additions. One significant addition is Victor's close bond with his teacher Professor Waldman (brilliantly played by William Hurt with a delightful German accent). This friendship is never fully explored in the novel. Another is Victor's ongoing hallucinations brought on by shock and brain fever. The novel mentions nightmares, but not hallucinations. Victor's childhood is explored deeper than it was in the book and presents us with a genesis of his morbid obsessions with life and death. It also fleshes out his relationship with Elizabeth. Another change is Victor and Henry's trip to Ireland, instead they return to Ingolstadt. Lastly, the part in the novel where the creature is shot after trying to save a drowning girl is left out. There are some other minor additions, but nothing significant enough to mention. So what we have here is something much, much closer to Shelly than even Branagh's version from 1993. It contains all of the questions asked in the novel, all of the dynamics of Shelly's vision, and all of the tragedy without being as over-the-top and bombastic as a Hollywood produced film. Now, is it a good movie? I admit I'm not a fan of Hallmark. Their films are far to warm, fuzzy and unrealistically optimistic for me, and I find many of them to be rather revolting. This is why I was amazed when I saw Frankenstein. Hallmark producing a depress-fest like this?! As a film, although it doesn't have the ""cinematic element"" of theatrical releases, I felt it is a far superior film version of Frankenstein than anything done since 1931. The acting is solid-to superb, the emotional element is there (I defy anyone who thinks they can get away without at least a lump in their throat after seeing this), the sets and costumes are excellent, and we have the best looking Monster since Karloff. Hats off to the makeup designers! By the way, Luke Goss steals the show as the Monster who only desires to love and be loved, but is driven to murder. Another thing they got RIGHT this time is that each time the Monster kills; he feels overwhelming remorse and is often driven to tears. Shelly's original vision of the Monster was a creature that was inhuman outwardly, but within, the epitome of Humanity. The Monster was never supposed to be soulless. He's portrayed by Goss as a noble and highly intelligent (if physically unattractive) Gothic Anti-Hero. Just as he was in the book. He even quotes Milton's Paradise Lost. A far cry from the lumbering, brutish, child-like killer we're used to. This film is highly recommended to anyone even remotely interested in the Frankenstein myth. And if you're like me, a major fan of the original novel, you'll find this movie to be absolutely wonderful. It's a shame that it received virtually no promotion and was limited to being aired on the Hallmark channel.

Most reveiws here have covered much of it's plot and fine actors, but I simply wanted to give this fine film one of my personal aprovals. The creature's pathos ~ crossed with Victor Frankenstein's misguided obsessions ~ make for a splendid and intriguing tale. Frankenstein is so focused on carrying out his experiment to bring life from the dead that he doesn't even see the horror of his actions. Nor does he realize it's ramifications until it is all tragically too late. As a last side note I do want to mention the young actress who played the role of Elizabeth; Julie Delpy. Of all the many screen versions of Frankenstein I found Miss Dlepy to be the most charming and inocent of all the actresses who have been involved with that role.

855085,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0004Z33DM,Grady Harp,"[48, 49]","FRANKENSTEIN is a three and a half hour epic that recreates Mary Shelley's classic tale of the dichotomy of science vs humanities in a keenly wrought script by Mark Kruger.  For all its length and emphasis on special effects, sets, costumes, flashbacks etc, this film produced by Hallmark for television proves its mettle when viewed non-stop on the recently released DVD.Director Kevin Connor wisely emphasizes the morality issues in Shelley's novel and does not opt for the usual so-weird-that-it-becomes-comical focus on the manmade monster (a sensitive Luke Goss) of Dr. Frankenstein (Alec Newman). Through a series of flashbacks (the tale opens with on an ice-stranded ship captained by a man (Donald Sutherland) in search of his own scientific truths.  Enter Dr. Victor Frankenstein, ill from his pursuit of the monster he created in his German laboratory under the tutelage of Professor Waldman (William Hurt).  The film flashbacks to Victor's childhood and the impact of the death of his mother (Julie Delphy) that drives Victor to understand 'death' in hopes of being able to reverse it.  We meet his adopted sister Elizabeth (Nicole Levin) who is later to become his love and his wife, and his childhood friend Henry (Dan Stevens) who will follow Victor through the trials of his life.With tremendous veracity we see Victor's motivation to overcome death in a laboratory that is not eerie but wonderfully life-affirming, a place where he restores life to frogs and dogs killed by accidents.  Victor becomes obsessed with his work and eventually creates a 'man' from the body parts of the dead laying in open graves in the paupers' graveyard.  Using the electrical current from lightning he brings his creature to life - and from this point on the error of his creation pursues him.The 'monster' is not the freak usually displayed, but a tender soul, hungry for love, for family, for tenderness.  His outward appearance creates the 'bad monster' in the eyes of the public and the monster begins a course of killings, all in response to his need to have his 'father' (Dr Frankenstein) provide a love object/source for him.Yes, the story and its conclusion are known to everyone. The difference here is the view that man must take responsibility for all his actions and that ignoring the emotional needs of anyone is committing a crime.  All of the actors are excellent, the period evocation is elegant, and the special effects are subtly handled.

855103,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0004Z33DM,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","This film captures the spirit of Mary SHelly's masterpiece better than almost any film version I have seen, and it is a good bet I have seen most of them.  In many ways, this is my favorite of the classic monsters, the superhuman constructed by a scientist of genius, only to have his creation slip from his control.  Not only is it a warning (so typical of the Romantics) against placing too much faith in science, but it is also a deep enquiry into human nature.This version of Frankenstein begins with a desolated man (Newman) lost in the arctic, unburdening himself to the captain (Sutherland) of a ship of exploration.  He was on a quest to resurrect a being from death, which had come to fascinate the young aristocratic scientist.  Though obsessed, he came from the happiest home, a perfect childhood cut short by the sudden death of his mother.  Once he creates the monster - here the film fudges the vagueness in the book by positing it is electricity that is the secret - he is repelled by it.  As in the book, the monster escapes in the coat of the doctor, which included his lab notebook so that he can re-find him.The formation of the monster closely follows the book:  he retreats to the forest in extreme loneliness, rejected by his ""father"" and anyone who sees him.  For a long period, he watches a happy family, learning to speak and teaching himself to read; obviously he is highly intelligent, even sensitive.  When at last he approaches the blind father of the family, he weeps at the first kindness he has ever known, only to be violently ejected by the son upon his return.  This makes him murderously angry, forcing him to search out his creator (to gain a mate like himself) and giving up on man.  Similar to the Karloff character, it is clear that, had he been treated better, he would have developed in a completely different direction.  There is also accident, which further alienates him from humans and in particular from his creator, who sees him as irredeemably evil.  Once he refuses to create a mate, the monster declares war on him and the consequences are utterly horrific.  All the time, Frankenstein reflects on what he has done, how he erred into a god-like arrogance, which ruined him and all those he loved.  The monster is perhaps the best actor, who is at once evil yet full of remorse, full of blood rage yet capable of tenderness, brutish yet patient and cunning.The only flaw in this is the weakness of some of the acting.  Newman, whom I loved in Dune, simply is not up to the task in my view - he is good but not great.  In particular, he fails to project a very complex relationship with the monster.  Hurt, as a German professor, delivers an unconvincing cameo performance, there only for the draw of his name in my viewing.  Sutherland is better, but again the character appears only occasionally, though his final confrontation with the monster - expressed as a moral argument - is quite moving.  I will never forget the image of the monster as he walks into the arctic mist carrying the body of his creator, to disappear together in the ice.Recommended.

855107,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B0004Z33DM,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[4, 4]","**** SPOILER ALERT *****This review reveals much of the plot of the film, If you don't want to know don't read further!Pros:The scenery, the acting, the costumes, the music are all very good.The characters are believable. The creature (monster) is especially eloquent.There are some unexpected surprises that make you watch a scene a few times before you quite catch on.There is little gore, and the violence mostly takes place off camera.The movie follows the book very closely in plot and spirit.The movie has tremendous pathos. It is more tragedy than horror story.The movie avoids gratuitous violence - remarkable considering the subject matter.Cons:The creature (monster) design and makeup - while following Shelly's description - is not sufficiently horrific to explain his rejection by humanity.The movie is a bit long and somewhat tedious as it goes into very minute detail while unraveling a very difficult plot.For horror fans, the movie isn't very horrific or suspenseful.Luke Goss, while a fine actor, has a voice that is too high for the role of the  creature (monster), so he never sounds particularly menacing. But at least he doesn't grunt and growl.----------------------------Funny Things:In spite of the tragic nature of the story, the movie does have some funny moments.The scene between the creature and the little girl Eva is a funny homage to the Universal Frankenstein with a happier result.In the movie: ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"" starring Kenneth Brannaugh and Robert DeNiro, during the creation scene, Victor Frankenstein (Brannaugh) takes off his shirt to show off his manly, hairy chest. Presumably, it is because the lab was hot (he is boiling water to keep his creature warm).In the Hallmark movie, for some unexplained reason, Victor Frankenstein takes off his PANTS! Now what is that all about? He also wears some rubber boots (presumably to protect him from lightning since rubber is an insulator). But why does he have no pants? It is unintentionally funny to see him running around like this.After the creature escapes Victor's lab, he runs through the streets - sans pants - and asks the local constables if they have seen a monster running about the town.--------------------------------------Review:People who are used to the 1930's James Whale directed movie ""Frankenstein"", starring Boris Karloff as the Monster, may find this TV mini-series movie version by Hallmark terribly confusing or even disappointing. That's because the Whale movie, while a classic in its own right, did not follow Shelly's novel very well, in fact it wasn't even close. But, thanks to Boris Karloff's amazing performance (and makeup) as the Monster, we can forgive the pretty bad script in favor of cinematic fun. Karloff made the Monster into an icon, no question there. But that movie was nothing likes Shelly's vision and lacked her finesse and moral lesson in favor of shock and sensationalism. Still fun though.This movie, put out by Hallmark, goes back to the source novel (written in 1818) and tries to do it justice. While it doesn't have anything particularly iconic about it, for fans of the novel and what Mary Shelly actually intended, it is a top notch winner. It tries to stay as close to the novel as possible while being cinematically interesting.The photography and scenery are excellent, as are the costumes and sets, and the film approaches Frankenstein's creation of the creature/monster, not with the electric gizmo's and flashing lights we have come to expect in horror cinema, but rather more sedately with less flash, befitting the way the author originally imagined the scene to have transpired. For some, this may be a disappointment, but it is true to the historical period and also underscores the remarkably primitive conditions under which Frankenstein made his creation, and the subsequent pain it suffered as a result.And suffering is what this film tries to show - as tastefully as possible - suffering of the poor rejected creature (who looks very much as Shelly described him in the book) as he literally limps out of the laboratory shortly after being born, and the suffering of Victor Frankenstein as he learns too late the responsibility he must face for bringing the creature to life and then abandoning him.The film is at times, like the book, heartbreaking. And so, this film replaces shock and awe with pathos. In this, it is absolutely true to Shelly's amazing book. While Frankenstein is a horror story, it is also a tragedy. That is the take used in this film.The Plot - (Contains spoilers):Suffice it to say that the movie follows the plot of the book, opening in the arctic wilderness with Captain Walton picking up the nearly dead Victor Frankenstein and learning his history. Donald Sutherland plays Walton beautifully, being sympathetic and incredulous at the same time, just like the character in the book.As Victor reveals his history, the film goes into something of an extended flashback of his childhood and growing up in Geneva to become the student of ""the unhallowed arts"" (as Shelly says). The film spends quite a bit of time here, which those anxious to meet the creature may find tedious. But it is important to the motivations of the character of Victor Frankenstein.Alec Newman, as Victor Frankenstein, does a fine job in the role. He looks the part of a young aristocrat in the late 18th century, and he gives his Victor credibility, while remaining somewhat reserved. But this is what the character in the book was, a representative of the Age of Reason, not much on emotion, but deeply committed to his principles, while being at times just a little bit crazy.Nicole Lewis does a fine job as his fiance, Elizabeth. Her role, while somewhat diminished, is the reflection of the character in the book, which was written in a time when women were more eye candy than people to be taken seriously. This was a pet peeve of Mary Shelly (her mother was the famous feminist, Mary Wollstonecraft), and I think she created Elizabeth to show how women were actually treated at the time. Elizabeth loves Victor and he loves her, establishing a relationship early on that is reserved, but believable given the sentiments and social manners of the time period.Eventually we get to follow Victor and his education at the University of Ingostalt where he meets his mentor, Prof Waldman, played by William Hurt. The film takes some liberties with the novel in the relationship between Frankenstein and Waldman, but does so to establish a more solid moral base - from the Professor - because by now, Victor is succumbing to ambition and a fanatical desire to complete his bizarre experiment.This was probably done for our benefit since the making of monsters is pretty common stuff to a 21st century audience. At the time of the novel, it was a horrific idea. What is a bit comical is that Hurt speaks with a pseudo German accent, while the rest of the cast speaks in UK English. No one knows why, and some have complained, but I am a Hurt fan and I found it kind of fun.Needless to say, Victor soon begins working on making his creature. The film handles the construction with remarkable reserve, avoiding the blood and gore fest that could so easily have been done, for a more anatomically accurate (up to a point) display of body parts, including a severed head awaiting attachment to the the patchwork body.The film follows the book very closely here and there is none of the nonsense about a damaged or even criminal brain. Everything Victor uses seems to come from ""standard"" stock. This is essential for the scenes that follow.Of course, Victor finally brings his creature to life. The creation scene, like so much of the film, is rather reserved, but does contain the obligatory bolt of lightning to set things off. They do establish some tension as Victor leans over his unmoving creation and manages to ""jump start"" it by punching it repeatedly in the chest. One expects it to suddenly burst into life, but instead, with an eeriness, it does exactly what Shelly describes in the book. He slowly opens his eyes and looks Victor in the face. Not shocking, but there is a type of intimacy in this scene that is really, really creepy!Victor immediately runs away in horror, just like in the book and the creature stumbles out of the lab to follow him. It was very moving to see the poor creature, played brilliantly by Luke Goss, obviously confused and in considerable pain, limping down the stairs from the attic laboratory out into the street, with no idea what he is doing, where he is going, or why.A word about the creature's makeup is due here.The filmmakers chose to go with Shelly's description rather than a makeup artist's nightmare. I think that was a good choice because the whole point of Frankenstein is the sympathy the audience must feel for the creature. And Shelly herself is rather contradictory in her descriptions. She says he is a towering 8 feet tall (something no movie version of the novel has ever pulled off effectively) and hideous, like a mummy brought back to life, yet he has flowing black hair and straight white teeth but black lips and dull yellow eyes.Hallmark's creature is considerably shorter than 8 feet tall (although some clever camera work does give him some much needed height), has the elegant hair and teeth but grey blue eyes, not yellow. And his skin, well, it just looks like he needs a good dab of moisturizer to set things right. So he is actually a rather handsome creature, instead of the required hideous. Of course, he does have a few ragged stitches -- gotta have those stitches!This choice in make up actually does hurt the film because it makes no sense to the audience when the creature encounters real people and they attack him in disgust and horror. Why? Perhaps he is too pretty? Can beauty be as shocking as ugliness? Nevertheless the attacks and abuse are close enough to what happens in the book and well enough done to make us begin to feel pity for the creature. And it is important that we do, for what is to come later, and what makes the story such a work of genius. Again, Hallmark chose to be reserved in these scenes, whereas a more shock flick would have shown serious wounding and bone breaking going on, with copious amounts of blood. This is not the case in this movie though and the creature escapes to the woods relatively unharmed as far as we can see.The movie continues to follow the book as the creature seeks refuge by hiding near the cottage of the DeLacy family. For people unfamiliar with the novel, this is where that famous blind man comes in. But here, as in the novel, he is not a hermit, but the gentle father of a family of refugees of the French Revolution.As in the book, the creature learns to speak, read, and write by spying on the family, and as in the book, he discovers that he has Victor Frankenstein's journal. In those days, keeping a journal was as important as telling-all on Facebook is to us today, so of course, the creature learns of his origins.Now, of course, something HAS to go wrong, and it does, as it did in the book, but Hallmark adds a touch of whimsy to the pathos.The DeLacy family have a little girl named Eva (she is new and not part of the book) and we see the creature come up behind her as she is counting ducks swimming in a pond. This is a real tension builder and a bit of a joke at the same time. It harkens back to the famous Universal Frankenstein film where the monster meets the little girl Maria, and eventually drowns her.The tension builds as our creature approaches, but then is relieved when Eva sees the creature's reflection in the water and turns to ask him if he likes ducks.Here is where the movie becomes touching. He speaks, and says, yes, he likes ducks. Of course, having been trained by the Universal movie, we expect his next move will be to toss Eva into the pond. Instead, she takes his hand and leads him into the cottage to meet grandfather! What a relief! This scene was so well done and touching, I had to rewind and watch it a few times.The grandfather welcomes him and the creature cries in gratitude of being given food and kindness. This is again very touching. He even does a little waltz with Eva while grandfather plays the violin (in the book, he played a guitar), but the party is broken up by the return of Eva's parents. Her father, Peter, is horrified by the goings on and attacks the creature, who avoids his blows and runs away, hiding in the woods in tears, begging God to explain why he was created as such a monster. Then he remembers that Frankenstein and not God is responsible, and he starts off for Geneva, to confront Victor. It is a turning point for the creature, and soon to be a shocker for Victor.Eventually, the creature does confront Victor, and now, he's not the gentle soul we had come to admire and pity. He's had enough abuse and is out for revenge. We learn that he killed Victor's younger brother and arranged it so that the family maid, Justine, gets blamed and executed for the deed. (in the book, this section goes into great detail about a corrupt justice system, but no Hollywood movie has ever dared approach this issue.)The creature demands that Victor make him a mate to end his loneliness. Victor is of course confused that A) the creature is still alive and B) that he can speak and is actually quite intelligent, if a bit homicidal at this point.They have a long argument over everything that has happened and about who is responsible for what, and it ends with a shaky deal that Victor will get his creature ""a date"" if the two will quit the ""society of man"" and live a harmless existence, at Victor's insistence -  in some remote desolate and uninhabited area. All compassion is that Victor. But the creature, desperate for companionship agrees and Victor sets to work.At this point, we see what the creature, who is rapidly deteriorating into a monster, has in mind. He wants Victor to suffer as he has suffered. The first blow for Victor comes as he has to leave his family to make the creature's girlfriend, and he can't exactly explain why he is leaving. This causes quite the family argument and puts his own engagement in jeopardy. But a promise is a promise and Victor is a rational, if somewhat dense character.So he returns to Ingostalt and starts work again. He is almost ready to bring his female creature to life when he talks himself out of the deal, after a conversation with his friend Henry Clerval. The once creature, now monster, (who never has a name) has been following his progress and enters the ""lab"" to see his new girl friend. He has so many hopes for her and the life they may share together. He talks to the dead thing as a lover might... it's very touching. But not to Victor who destroys the un-reborn female in front of the monster.BAD idea!The monster vows revenge and warns, ""I will be with you on your wedding night!"" and rushes off. It's important to remember that line, as it will come back to haunt Victor - and us - in a while.Meanwhile, Victor has to get rid of the female body and takes it out on a lake to dump it. When he returns, he is confronted by the local police and the obligatory villagers and charged with murder. He is totally confused until they show him the freshly dredged up body of - not his female creation - but his best friend Henry Clerval. Victor then realizes what he's up against, and now has to deal with the rejection of humanity, just as his creation has. Clever monster!Fortunately, Victor's father -  and insufficient evidence - gets him off the hook. His ravings about a monster make no sense, so he is remanded to his father's care, as he is mentally unwell.Eventually he gets better, Elizabeth forgives him for leaving her and they decide to get married! This all happens in the book as well as the movie, and by now one has to believe that Victor is dumber than dirt, considering the monster's threat. This guy just cannot see the writing on the wall. He couldn't in the the book, and the movie is true to the book.Victor and Elizabeth marry and go off on their honeymoon. He does know that the monster has something dastardly in mind, but can't figure out exactly what. He hears a noise in the inn where they are staying and locks Elizabeth in their room, presumably to keep her safe, and goes to investigate. He has inconveniently forgotten that the room has a balcony. Of course, the monster uses that to get in and kills Elizabeth. Victor hears her screams and comes to the rescue, too late of course.Victor returns home in grief, and his father now rejects him because ""death follows you wherever you go"". In the book, the father dies of a heart attack. But in the film, I think they did this to complete the circle.The monster has had his revenge. Victor is a social outcast, lost the love of his life, has no friends and his own family (what is left of it) has rejected him. The score is even.There's only one thing left for Victor to do. Fight it out with the monster until one or the other of them, or both are dead. The monster leaves Victor a note taunting him to follow him and catch him for the final battle. Even though Victor has been laid low by all his losses, the monster is not satisfied that he has suffered enough.He gets Victor to chase him across Europe up into the arctic circle, starving and suffering hardships and pain from the elements all along the way. They eventually wind up near Walton's ship where Victor is picked up.But it is too late. The chase has taken its toll, as well as his telling of his story, and Victor dies from exposure and exhaustion in spite of Walton's care.Walton can't believe the story but is soon convinced when he discovers the monster in the cabin crying over Victor's death. There is the obligatory final monologue as the creature explains his side of the story and his remorse and how none of this needed to have happened. Walton is not terribly sympathetic and the creature doesn't care. He takes Victor's body and carries it off the ship into the snow and ice, never to be seen again. But... does he die? We'll never know!------------------------------Conclusion:In spite of its length and the complex plot, the Hallmark Frankenstein movie is a very fine adaptation of Shelly's classic novel. For fans of literature come-to-life on the screen, this movie is a must have. It is well made and deeply sincere.The violence is handled as tastefully as possible, considering the subject matter, and it avoids the temptation to turn into a gore fest.It does require some
