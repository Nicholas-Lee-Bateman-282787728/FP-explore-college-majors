Christain Bale gave this wonderful performance. I was bored and decided to rent a dvd. I saw American Psycho 2 the cover art alone had me sold. But it was very misleading this movie wasn't anything in any that the first one was. It's preditable with a weak plot. The dvd's extra aren't anything much either. The only thing I like about this movie were the few and far in between witty comments that Mila Kunis character (can't even remember her name) said. Other then that this movie was a big bust.

701471,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000066C76,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[21, 27]","A debate is raging between myself and a bank teller from across the street about the validity of watching sequels in either the sequential order of release date or in the way that they were semi-intended of viewing (i.e. the prequel to the ""Exorcist"" prior to the original version of the film ... and that sort of logic).  I am a believer of watching the films as they are released, due to the possibility of missing an element that may be voiced or uncovered in future films, he feels differently due to true logic - meaning that there may be no continuity at all, so why put myself through the torture.  An interesting thought, but one that I don't quite agree with due to the ""American Psycho"" theory.  This argumentative other believes that you could watch ""American Psycho 2"" without seeing the original and consider it a viewable film, because you have to disassociate yourself from the original.  I disagree for the exact reason that when you attach the title to another film, even if it has nothing to do with the original - you must associate the two.  The two must match, gel, or even co-exist AND for me, it is an utter disgrace when the two just fight against each other.  This is the battle known as ""American Psycho II: All American Girl"", and alas, I was caught in the trenches.For those that are huge fans of the Christian Bale masterpiece should whole heartily avoid this film at all costs.  There is nothing, I repeat, nothing connecting these two films together outside of a title and a slight beginning reference to a man that never should have existed in the first place - one elusive Patrick Bateman.  From the beginning the story makes no sense, supposed serial killer Patrick Bateman kills again, leaving a small girl to finish what he started.  From that point forward, she decides to do whatever it takes to kill/capture all the serial killers of the world - thus becoming one in the process.  Again, what should have just been in Bateman's mind destroys the concept that this film is balanced on - so, all we are left with are views, images, goofy music, and acting that honestly came from a Cracker Jack box.  Our lead this time is Mila Kunis, of ""That 70s Show fame"", jumping or should I say ""bubbling"" right out of her character on FOX to a nearly identical character for this film.  Her goal for the film, become William Shatner's teaching assistant so that she can get into Quantico and thus fulfilling her dreams to capture serial killers.  What actually happens in the film is that she kills everyone in her way (everyone else is oblivious to the pile of bodies) to get that respected position.  Nobody is safe, and as we prepare for the ending, a twist so predictable is thrown our way that we could care less about her, the story, or the semi-terrifying ending.  Our only hope is that they decide to end the series with this film.  What could the story be next?  Patrick Bateman's ghost returns for more non-existent killing?From every angle of this film, I was disgraced.  I was such an enormous fan of the original film (the insanity, the characters, the violence), that to be handed a stick of bubble gum after eating veal just felt insulting.  There are those that actually enjoyed this film, which just boggles my mind.  How could anyone, either a fan of the original or not, enjoy this cookie-cutter film?  In the commentary, director Morgan J. Freeman even admits to being a ""director-for-hire"", which means the story was already in place all he needed to do was put that ""direct-to-video"" feel to it, and it was ready for packaging, sealing, and delivery to those unsuspecting viewers who were tied into just the title.  Nothing worked in this film.  The music took me away from the horrors that were happening, and made me feel that I was camping at a carnival.  The selection made me want to shake my hips and chew some bubble gum (odd, this is transforming into a theme to this film).  The cinematography was juvenile at best.  Errors erupted with leaps and bounds, and again, during the commentary the director wasn't afraid to point them out.  From these low points, the only place to go was further down with acting that somehow connected well to the carnival music.  Shatner tried his best, but just couldn't pull off the womanizing teacher with connections to Quantico.  The chemistry between him and the other ladies felt scripted and old.  In just a short twenty days, one probably doesn't have the chance to get to know the rest of your cast, so just read your lines and pray for the best.  For those wondering how Kunis did with this role, just listen to her in the commentary.  Pathetic would be a good word, amateur would be another, and just to give you that third scoop, she was unbelievable at best.  Freeman attempted to make her this convincing detail oriented killer, with a killer body, but the result was anything but scary - in fact - one could go so far to say that it was ""killer funny"".  Can I say it one more time?  Nothing in this film worked.  I don't mean to be lacking detail, but from the initial scene it was obvious that we were on a downward path - did Morgan J. Freeman even see the original?I have no sympathy for this film.  ""American Psycho II: All American Girl"" was a debauchery to the series, to the words that Bret Easton Ellis put on the page, and to cinema itself.  I have no respect for those that say that this should not be paired with the original, but instead should just be watched on its own.  The original ""American Psycho"" was well acted, nail-bitingly genre bending, and continually asks me to question the value of a male dominated workplace on Wall Street.  In the original, the question became what happens to a man that has everything - in the sequel, the question transforms into ""What would a girl do to get everything?""  The themes are even the same.  This film is a prime example of Hollywood looking to capitalize on a cult film by merely selling the title.  Oh, what a horrid experiment gone wrong.If you wanted a cheap version of the original, I suggest this one.  It contains no artistic value, no moral thought-provoking moments, and definitely nothing that could be called unique or creative.  The word original was never in Morgan J. Freeman's dialog.  Listen to the audio commentary if you don't believe me, these Freeman and Kunis give hope to the aspiring director (who doesn't mind selling out for a paycheck) as well as a disgraceful taste to the human race.This was cheap - with a capital C.Grade: * out of *****",1,This is the film that made Patrick Bateman snap.,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,6532,"['debate', 'raging', 'bank', 'teller',

701472,A3PHUMOFCIFUGF,B000066C76,Alexander Liu,"[2, 3]","I should start off by saying that I was greatly disappointed by this sequel. Two words: It [stunk].Now let me retread and explain.While this movie does have some great twists and surprises, the only connection that it has with American Psycho is the opening scene featuring Patrick. Even then, it ruins the magic of the original. Many people theorized that Bateman never committed the murders, and AP was quite open ended in that sense, as one could draw his or her own conclusions. This movie simply chucks that out the window, and simply says ""Patrick killed them."" Little surprise here that Christian Bale chose not to reprise his role.I was extremely disappointed in that sense, as I was expecting more of the head trip of ol' Bateman. That is not to say that it is a bad movie though. As I said, it has great twists, and does not go for the traditional cheap thrills expected in teen slasher flicks. It instead substitutes that for intelligent suspense, and a feeling of an itch the viewer just cant scratch until the end. Though there are plenty of goofs in the movie, it is still worth a shot as long as you ignore the American Psycho in the title. This movie would have done great as a stand-alone movie, but as it bears the AP title, my high expectations were crushed.Don't expect any social satire or yuppie jokes, as this film centers around a bunch of college kids. The main character is Rachael Newman, the successor of Patrick Bateman, who as a child of 12, killed Patrick with little remorse (By the way, neither Bateman's apartment, nor Bateman himself look like the ones present in the original AP). She wants to become teaching assistant to William Shatners character, so that she'll get a job in career and stop psychos. She accomplishes this by killing off her assistants. (Go figure)The tone of the film is quite 'cutesy', an odd accomplishment given the nature of the film. While the movie occasionally relies on slow, stacatto tracking shots, much of the film looks quite professionally done, with the exception of a few fake blood stains, and bad audio synching.Oh and don't expect much on the DVD itself either. The only features are the trailer, and scene selection. The trailer is quite cool, with the original AP music playing in the background.All things considered. American Psycho fans, I can't stop you from buying it... heck, I bought it. But take my advice... it [stinks]. Don't expect a movie anything like AP. Why, even Beneath the Planet of the Apes was a better sequel compared to this, and believe me, that sequel [stinks]!",2,American Psycho 2?

Freeman- I'm not sure if he's a relation) made to try &amp; cash in on that movie's success. Obviously, they failed.Mila Kunis plays Rachael Newman, a student of Behavioural Sciences at Quantico who happened to witness the brutal murder of her babysitter as a girl at the hands of Patrick Bateman, the original AMERICAN PSYCHO, so in retaliation she kills him. The police never link her to the crime so as a result of this Rachael has discovered she enjoys killing &amp; decides to devote the rest of her life to killing other psychos as a form of retribution in order to better understand how they think &amp; advance her career prospects in the FBI. She thinks of herself as &quot;the Robin Hood of serial killers&quot;.Ironically, her college professor is none other than James T. Kirk... woops, I mean Robert Starkman (William Shatner) the FBI profiler who caught Bateman.This movie (almost) recreates the &quot;microwaved cat&quot; scene from Bret Easton Ellis's original novel. But that's about it. One of those &quot;Why did they bother?&quot; sequels, loosely &amp; clumsily tied to the original (a la THE RAGE: CARRIE 2). Add to this some of the stupidest gore scenes ever put on film &amp; the notion that we're supposed to believe that cute college girls are attracted to pudgy old Bill Shatner!

A much-repeated phrase is ""this would be a good movie with a different title"". Huh? I never quite understood that way of thinking. It reminds me of the opinions I got from people who were fans of the rock band the Doors. After the singer Jim Morrison died the Doors continued for two more albums that hardly anyone wants to listen to. Why? ""the Doors without Morrison? forget it"". As if the only records in the universe worth listening to are ones with that particular singer. Once I made that point the illogic of their argument was revealed and they listened to the two albums and really liked them. Good music is good music.Same here. This movie wouldn't be any better or worse with a different title. I feel ""American Psycho 2"" (not all prints carry the subtitle ""All American Girl"") is almost the equal of it's predecessor. And not only for actually confirming that Bateman did indeed kill at least *some* people, but for the film's point of view. While the first movie was a stunning and biting satire of self-obsessed yuppies, ""2"" is aiming at the college crowd, the vapid kids with a frightening sense of entitlement and sum-zero convictions. The psycho Rachel here is somehow even more bizarrely sympathetic than Patrick, to a point, even with there being no true ambiguity as to the sequence of events. After the murder of a billionaire's son we know it's Rachel behind the killing, yet it doesn't take away from the narrative. Two unexpected and satisfying twists aside, there's no mystery here; the brilliance is entirely in it's own universe and following it's own catharsis. To condemn ""American Psycho 2"" for it's somewhat stilted commercial construction and gaps in logic is missing the point entirely. This is a great film. It's not pretentious in presenting itself as a sequel because it really does fit- Bateman would be proud.Or not. If the idea of a sequel nags at you, call it something else. If the revelation that Bateman was a serial killer is worrisome, then I guess the premise of ""American Psycho 2"" is just insurmountable. Skip it.

As a sequel to the incredibly awesome & tense American Psycho it fails miserably. In fact, don't even think of it as a sequel- you'll just be disappointed horribly. Go into this with the same zest you would for a cheesy 80s horror flick, which is what this movie mostly closely resembles. If you aren't a fan of those types of movies then you won't like this flick.The plotline follows overachiever Rachael Newman as she first starts out as a would-be victim of the infamous Patrick Bateman. (For you AP fans, just pretend that this is another character & that this has nothing to do with the original film.) After escaping & ending his murder spree she decides that she'll spend the rest of her life trying to enter Quantico, where she can put away the bad guys like him. Years later she's in a prestigious university where the US's best criminologist Starkman (who is played to perfection by Shatner) teaches. He announces that he's getting ready to have a new TA, which is a coveted role because it almost guarantees acceptance into Quantico. Rachael decides that she wants this position enough to kill for it.This is not a good movie. It's downright awful. But then, there's an art to bad movies where they become amazingly fun to watch & this movie has that down to a T. Like I said earlier, don't expect anything from this as far as the original movie goes. (Luckily I wasn't expecting anything so I was able to enjoy it.) Mila Kunis does the best job that she can with the role given to her & Shatner does what he does best in the role of a sleazy college professor. (What, like anyone expects him to actually play a nice guy? This *is* Shatner, you know.) Kunis really steals the show, so fans of her will be sure to be pleased.As long as you don't take it seriously & are in the mood to watch a good cheesy flick, this will be sure to please. If you're looking for something that's a real follow up to the original film then you're better off reading the phone book or staring at the wall- you'll be more likely to find it there than in this film. I really feel like this film was done a disservice by attaching the American Psycho name to it, otherwise I think it would have done much better on it's own & developed more of a cult following.4/5 for the guilty pleasure of watching it1/5 for the actual quality of the film- it is what it is, a flick that really isn't very good.

All I know of the first film is that it was about a serial killer, but filmed in a tongue-in-cheek feminist style, and got mixed reviews.  The only connection we see to the first film is that the heroine as a roughly ten-year old  ""meets"" the killer of the first movie.What happens there I won't reveal, but that meeting does form her personality for this movie.  Which jumps to her as a college student.  Or, more specifically, a college to train future FBI agents.  Unlike the FBI training in ""Silence of the Lambs"", where the students actually learn how to catch criminals, this school seems to consist only of classes that teach about serial killers.  The teacher is William Shatner, who is a rotting corpse of an actor in anything he does, so am I giving anything away to ask you to guess his fate?The movie is done in a tongue-in-cheek manner, which takes awhile to get used to.  In fact, it takes so long to get into the right frame of mind that it does deserve a second viewing.  It's got to be hard to treat this material where it has to handle both gruesome and comedic themes, but to it's credit it does do it with a lot of style.  The heroine is self-assured about her role, and handles tight spots with no more emotion than if she had broken a nail.The only problem I had with it was that I wish it could have been somewhat ""edgier"".  We have an R-rated movie with a bunch of college coeds in the cast, yet there is nothing close to nudity.  You do get a lot of murders, but there is a surprising lack of blood and gore.

It is just what some call a slasher, others would call a thriller. But what is it really? First it is a phenomenal picture of the American society at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century. A society that considers achieving an aim, a purpose as being the most important fact in anyone's own life. It is the cult of the winner as opposed to the curse of the loser. If you don't want to be a loser, you have to be a winner, at all cost. This is an illusion if we don't understand that winning or losing has to be a social fact: one can only win within the own winning of his full society. One cannot be a winner if one is surrounded with losers. And one cannot be a winner if one is surrounded with winners, lest that first one will have to eliminate all the other potential winners. That is schizophrenia based on a megalomaniac paranoid psychosis. The second element we learn is that a woman serial killer is possible, though we must admit they are rare, though we do not know why. The third element we learn is that the best serial killer is someone who is absolutely unknown because that serial killer assumed the identity of someone else and eliminated that someone else. Hence the serial killer is past history, and yet alive and kicking somewhere in New York or Washington. The trickiest element of this film is that this insane killer only aimed at being accepted in the FBI Academy in Quantico and has actually been selected and is bound to be an FBI serial killer hunter. But this does not qualify this film as a sequence in any way of ""American Psycho"". One thing is missing: the particular obsession Bateman had about male fashion and beauty products, financial business and amplified music. The second thing that is missing is the ambiguity of the book and the ambiguity of the unrated version of the film as for knowing if this serial killing is only a fantasized nightmare or a real thing, if Bateman is a real serial killer or just a mental case of a serial killer. But one thing is identical: the ""killer"" is un-prosecutable, will always be unknown and untouchable, because society has classified the murders with some reassuring explanation: the killer herself is dead.

American Psycho 1 is NOT a slasher or horror film or book whatsoever..it's a social satire on the depravity and decadence of the rich. It pokes fun at the idea that these born to wealth are somehow better than us, Ellis (the actual writer of the book for the illiterate 12 year olds that like American Psycho 2) informs us that their position and wealth have caused such alienation in them that they are actually our moral inferiors, not the other way around. American Psycho 2 doesn't get this or doesn't care and tries to commercially bank on all the dumbasses that THOUGHT American Psycho 1 was a slasher film.Thirdly, for anyone that READ the book we know that he DID actually kill those people, but that of course isn't the point, at least not literally.  It's a metaphor...like when he says ""Murders and Executions"" instead of ""Mergers and Aquisitions""...it's what it really is behind the flashy clothes and authoritative legal speak.American Psycho 2 lacks any subtext whatsoever and panders to the lowest common denominator...a false charge brought against the first movie.

Schneider,"[3, 5]","Having not yet seen the original AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000) that starred British actor Christian Bale as the titular character, Patrick Bateman, as made infamous in the ultraviolent novel of the same name by Brett Easton Ellis (unread by me as of yet), I could only imagine how much better that film must be than this piece of utter garbage. AMERICAN PSYCHO II: ALL AMERICAN GIRL (2002) was obviously made (tellingly, by none of those involved with the original) as a quick cash-in; unsuccessfully, I may add. I happened upon it on one fateful late-night on some cable station. I was just reminded of it in my writing of STAR TREK reviews. Why, you may ask? Well, because this unbelievable movie just happens to co-star none other than Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner!Playing a middle-aged, sleazy college professor, Shatner gives his all in a completely broad-stroked role. He doesn't fare any better than Mila Kunis does in playing the titular character of this film; an &quot;all-American girl&quot; who (unbelievably) kills Patrick Bateman as a 12-year-old girl, who grows up---if you can call it that---to yearn to be a criminologist, who turns to serial murder as a way to achieve her goals. Well, I'm sorry, but Rachel Newman, as a combination of wisecracking one-liners and a modern-day Jason Voorhees, just doesn't cut it (so to speak). Narrated by Kunis, famous for playing Jackie on the hilarious and well-written &quot;That '70's Show,&quot; this film makes her and Shatner each drop the F-bomb (in his case, twice) which does something for shock value but does nothing for those of us searching for a good film with characters that we can care about in the slightest way. Come to think of it, it was Alicia Silverstone in the 1995 comedy smash CLUELESS who famously said, &quot;Searching for good grades in high school is like searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.&quot; I'm positively sure that even good ol' Pauly Shore couldn't find a whit of meaning in this witless, brain-dead slasher-comedy-flick wannabe.AVOID",1,Unbelievably Awful,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,2039,"['Having', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'original', 'AMERICAN', 'PSYCHO', '2000', 'starred', 'British', 'actor', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'titular', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'made', 'infamous', 'ultraviolent', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Brett', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'unread', 'yet', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'piece', 'utter', 'garbage', 'AMERICAN', 'PSYCHO', 'II', 'AMERICAN', 'GIRL', '2002', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'tellingly', 'none', 'involved', 'original', 'quick', 'cash-in', 'unsuccessfully', 'may', 'add', 'happened', 'one', 'fateful', 'late-night', 'cable', 'station', 'was', 'just', 'reminded', 'writing', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'reviews', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'Well', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'just', 'co-star', 'none', 'other', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Playing', 'middle-aged', 'sleazy', 'college', 'professor', 'Shatner', 'completely', 'broad-stroked', 'role', ""n't"", 'fare', 'better', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'playing', 'titular', 'character', 'film', 'quot', 'all-American', 'girl', 'quot', 'who', 'unbelievably', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'can', 'call', '-to', 'yearn', 'be', 'criminologist', 'who', 'serial', 'murder', 'way', 'achieve', 'goals', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Rachel', 'Newman', 'combination', 'wisecracking', 'one-liners', 'modern-day', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'so', 'speak', 'Narrated', 'Kunis', 'famous', 'playing', 'Jackie', 'hilarious', 'well-written', 'quot', ""'70"", 'Show', 'quot', 'film', 'Shatner', 'drop', 'F-bomb', 'case', 'twice', 'something', 'shock', 'value', 'nothing', 'searching', 'good', 'film', 'characters', 'can', 'care', 'slightest', 'way', 'Come', 'think', 'was', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', '1995', 'comedy', 'smash', 'CLUELESS', 'who', 'famously', 'said', 'quot', 'Searching', 'good', 'grades', 'high', 'school', 'searching', 'meaning', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'movie.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'positively', 'sure', 'even', 'good', 'ol', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'whit', 'meaning', 'witless', 'brain-dead', 'slasher-comedy-flick', 'wannabe.AVOID']",N/A

From this point she goes on to college, kills a girl and steals her name, in an attempt to eventually get into the FBI so she can kill more bad guys one day. After a couple more killings on her way to her dreams she decides she might be nuts and goes to the worlds most intelligent shrink, who has figured out she is insane in one session with barely any dialogue (and not a single word that would give that strong of an impression).

It turns out thatwhen she was a young girl her baby sitter dated Bteman and he tied them both up in hopes to kill, but things did'nt really turn out that way. Living out most of the details, she somehow makes it free and does'nt give it a second thought. Fast foward some years and now she would kill to get a job as the professor's assistant just to get into the FBI, and soon enough, she does. I thought this movie was very predictable and cliched,and to top it off, it had many plot-holes. Whta I found annoying about this film was the fact she killed a lot of people and it took a while before anyone noticed. Things just seemed too unbelievable and the climax at the end of the film was very silly. You'll see how limited the budget is at that point. Though, despite all the bad this film has, I still somewhat enjoyed watching it, but that had to be mainly based on that Milla Kunis is hot. The killings were decent, especially the onewhere Milla's character uses a condom as a weapon. There really no gore or much for blood in here and the plot was nothing special. I still don't quite understand it fully since the events that happen inthe first film were all supposeldy in Bateman's head.

Well, actually, I didn't pay a dime for the rental, because ever since I got a job at the local Movie Gallery in my neighborhood, I can watch the movies weeks before they hit the shelves. Now that I have seen it before the shelving, I can persuade others not to see it. Beg for them not to pay their beloved money to rent it. To actually pay money to rent this film would be a sin.This is basically a low budget film that trys to be as good as the original. It has none of the sophistication of the first installment, nor the wit or comic touch. The first ""American Psycho"", although a bit sick and barely recommendable, was a good but flawed satire on 80's materialism. It had its freaky moments, and most certainly its hilarious ones. The writing was clever, the humor was biting. This second installment can't really be called this films sequel. It's not worthy to be called that. ""American Psycho 2"" lacks all of the qualities that made the first film so effective, and replaces all of that with horrible dialogue, weak attempts at humor, and most of all...terrible, terrible performances all around. What is it with actor Robin Dunne? He's been in every straight to video sequel from 2000-2002 that I can think of. ""Cruel Intentions 2"", ""The Skulls 2"", and now ""American Psycho 2"". He's cursed. He's in Horrible Straight to Video Sequel Hell. Also, we must express our sadness for poor William Shatner. Here he is, totally mis-cast as a horny middle-aged man, involved in an adulterous affair with a girl young enough to be his daughter. He also spews GD and the F-word frequently. Wow.

Of course, the chances of that were very high since American Psycho was possibly the worst serial killer movie EVER. Social satire? Materialism? Yuppie culure? Newsflash: no one cares! That can't save a movie like American Psycho from being what it is: boring. Period. This movie, however, is what the first American Psycho should have been. Throw out all that... business card fonts and 1980s music bands because they don't belong in a serial killer movie. Granted, I appreciate the attempt at creativity, but come on. Anyways, this movie has a very hot girl serial killer (gotta love that) doing away with the classmates that stand between her and her life goal: Quantico's FBI training academy. This means death to all other contenders for her professor's TA position. I love the fact that she wants to get into the FBI and stop serial killers so badly that she becomes one herself. Way better than the explanation Patrick Bateman had for killing people. At least this girl has a goal. And a personality. Something Bateman lacks. This movie has great twists and has you guessing the whole way. And by the way, the acting -- terrific! The actress playing Rachael, the killer, here is a lot more interesting than Bateman, and in this case, even a better actor. Full of black humor and plenty of murders, this movie puts American Psycho to shame because it actually manages to be somewhat interesting. This girl [does not care] about her culture. This is the way a serial killer is supposed to be. If this weren't the sequel to American Psycho, it probably wouldn't be as fun though. Because it has the chance to take all those fans of the first installment and make them sick. And they deserve it for making that film so popular and making me thinking it was good so I would rent it. American Psycho was a waste of money. American Psycho 2 is not. At least bad movies can produce [good] sequels. It doesn't happen often. While this is not the best movie out there, it's way ahead of the first movie in storytelling and enjoyment. It really shouldn't have been a direct-to-video. This is high quality for a direct-to-video movie. If it would have been released theatrically, like it should have been, then fans of the first movie would have gone to see it and hated it. That would teach them a lesson for making me waste my money by giving it good reviews. If you liked the first, you'll hate this. If you had taste and hated the first, this is a breath of fresh air. There's been talk of an American Psycho franchise. I'm certainly looking forward to it.",5,"A bad movie?

Rachael will get rid of anyone who threatens her chances of becoming teaching assistant to the infamous Dr. Daniels, a professor and former FBI profiler. In a world where the stakes are higher and sex can kill, terror lurks in the new American Psycho.Rather than trying to pick up where American Psycho left off, this sequel goes a different route by focusing on a whole new cast of characters. If you didn't already know, the first movie was based on the controversial book of the same name by author Bret Easton Ellis, who had no involvment what-so-ever in the making of this movie (he never wrote a sequel). Sadly, the movie is terrible, trite, and overall, a failure. Where the book (and, to a certain degree, the first movie) take a satirical view of the yuppie-laden 80s, this movie simply tries to be a violence-driven psycho-thriller, and loses all the ambience Ellis created for the original story. It's headlining star, Mila Kunis (better known for her role as Jackie in That 70s Show) does her best to deliver her role as a college student fascinated by serial killers, and determined to make her way into the FBI's training academy.But her flat, un-emotional performance really only contributes to the movie's overall shortcomings, rather than attaining it's probable goal of setting her up as a student driven to succeed, even at the cost of becoming exactly what she intends to stop as a future FBI agent. This movie is a good waste of time, and may be worth renting if you really can't find anything else to watch. But be forwarned, fans of the original movie, and especially of Ellis' book will be especially dissapointed. There are certainly far worse movies from the same year than this, but that doesn't make this one any more capable of standing out. Sadly, Ellis' books simply don't translate well to film, they lose to much in the transer. But this flick goes a step beyond that by trying to make a sequel to an Ellis book, without actually having one of Ellis' writings to draw from",1,Worse movie ever.
