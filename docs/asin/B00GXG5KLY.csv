1682716,A1IZ5TJ1SKOT8Y,B00GXG5KLY,Cannucklehead Film Addict,"[0, 1]","The original Korean title for this one is something like ""The Alumnus,"" which refers to the hero's double status, as both a teenager in a South Korean high school, and as a graduate of North Korean spy training. So the film is a bit of an odd hybrid, partly a teen high-school K-drama, and partly a crime-cum-spy thriller. The surprise is that it works reasonably well, except for the last act, where the principals act according the harsh rules of romantic melodrama, rather than as they would in the real world. Only in the movies, after all, will someone who's been shot be transported in a private car, with the girlfriend hanging on to him and weeping, rather than in an ambulance, with paramedics. And only in the movies will a detective, acting on a tip, arrive at a gun-filled showdown alone rather than having called the location in to the local gumshoes to get some backup. But, what the heck, it's the movies.That said, this is a well-made thriller, with some good acting from its newly minted star (K-pop idol T.O.P., Choi Seung Hyun), a crackling pace, and some decent action set-pieces. Going into the film you should know, however, that the girl on the cover is his sister, and she has only a tiny tiny role in the proceedings. You also need to know that, according to the film anyway, North and South have meetings (in Beijing naturally, neutral territory for both) at which information is sometimes exchanged. Is this true? I have no idea, but suspect that it might be, as they say, based on truth. It certainly is true that the North runs drugs and other illegal products in order to benefit its elites, and that is reflected to a degree in the film, which shows the North's  spy appartus in the South as basically a criminal gang, rather than politically motivated. A not bad film, overall, so long as you don't expect anything more than a fairly decent crime film; good for what it is, but it isn't anything more.",4,Not about commitment at all (some spoilers),1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1933,"['original', 'Korean', 'title', 'one', 'something', 'Alumnus', 'hero', 'double', 'status', 'teenager', 'South', 'Korean', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'North', 'Korean', 'spy', 'training', 'film', 'bit', 'odd', 'hybrid', 'partly', 'teen', 'high-school', 'K-drama', 'partly', 'crime-cum-spy', 'thriller', 'surprise', 'reasonably', 'well', 'last', 'act', 'where', 'principals', 'act', 'according', 'harsh', 'rules', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'rather', 'would', 'real', 'world', 'Only', 'movies', 'will', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'shot', 'be', 'transported', 'private', 'car', 'girlfriend', 'hanging', 'weeping', 'rather', 'ambulance', 'paramedics', 'only', 'movies', 'will', 'detective', 'acting', 'tip', 'arrive', 'gun-filled', 'showdown', 'alone', 'rather', 'having', 'called', 'location', 'local', 'gumshoes', 'get', 'backup', 'what', 'heck', 'movies.That', 'said', 'well-made', 'thriller', 'good', 'acting', 'newly', 'minted', 'star', 'K-pop', 'idol', 'T.O.P.', 'Choi', 'Seung', 'Hyun', 'crackling', 'pace', 'decent', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'Going', 'film', 'should', 'know', 'however', 'girl', 'cover', 'sister', 'only', 'tiny', 'tiny', 'role', 'proceedings', 'also', 'need', 'know', 'according', 'film', 'anyway', 'North', 'South', 'have', 'meetings', 'Beijing', 'naturally', 'neutral', 'territory', 'information', 'sometimes', 'exchanged', 'true', 'have', 'idea', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'say', 'based', 'truth', 'certainly', 'true', 'North', 'drugs', 'other', 'illegal', 'products', 'order', 'benefit', 'elites', 'reflected', 'degree', 'film', 'North', 'spy', 'appartus', 'South', 'basically', 'criminal', 'gang', 'rather', 'politically', 'motivated', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'overall', 'so', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'fairly', 'decent', 'crime', 'film', 'good', 'what', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more']",Commitment

It's a simple DVD, the packaging is nothing fancy so don't expect a lot when it comes to this...after all it's not a Big Bang CD release.Casting T.O.P in this movie was a huge plus for the director/producers...because those that are fangirls of this prince-like idol will be to busy swooning over his every move in this film to notice that unrealisticness of the plot.  If you don't mind the film saying that North Korean defectors are able to gain access to South Korea like I could sneak out of my parents house with their car when I was a teenager is unbelievable...seeing as how both countries are always on the fringes of war.  So this director/screen writer have the main character gain access to this country without any hardships and then get adopted by a family that doesn't mind a 19 year old kid....who poses as a high school student during the day/night and a killer for North Korea whenever he gets the call (Spolier Alert...Sorry).The action in this movie is awesome. I'm giving it 5-stars because the main actor is....well google him (he's beautiful). T.O.P gives a very sensitive, compassionate and thrilling performance.  There really aren't very many lines in this drama but it still manages to flow well....The character, is forced to be a spy after the death of his father who was also a spy (spoiler alert) in order to save himself and his sister....and while doing so, he finds time to adopt and save a young girl whose his classmate.It's a beautiful yet tragic tale....again you want be disappointed.",5,Espionage Thriller meets Price-like Idol,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,1591,"['Well', 'first', 'off', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'buying', 'movie', 'simple', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'when', 'not', 'Big', 'Bang', 'CD', 'release.Casting', 'T.O.P', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'plus', 'director/producers', 'are', 'fangirls', 'prince-like', 'idol', 'will', 'be', 'busy', 'swooning', 'move', 'film', 'notice', 'unrealisticness', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'film', 'saying', 'North', 'Korean', 'defectors', 'are', 'able', 'gain', 'access', 'South', 'Korea', 'could', 'sneak', 'parents', 'house', 'car', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'unbelievable', 'seeing', 'how', 'countries', 'are', 'always', 'fringes', 'war', 'director/screen', 'writer', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'gain', 'access', 'country', 'hardships', 'then', 'get', 'adopted', 'family', ""n't"", 'mind', '19', 'year', 'old', 'kid', '.who', 'poses', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'day/night', 'killer', 'North', 'Korea', 'call', 'Spolier', 'Alert', 'Sorry', '.The', 'action', 'movie', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'giving', '5-stars', 'main', 'actor', '.well', 'beautiful', 'T.O.P', 'very', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'thrilling', 'performance', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'lines', 'drama', 'still', 'flow', 'well', '.The', 'character', 'forced', 'be', 'spy', 'death', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'spy', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'order', 'save', 'sister', '.and', 'doing', 'so', 'time', 'adopt', 'save', 'young', 'girl', 'classmate.It', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'tragic', 'tale', '.again', 'want', 'be', 'disappointed']",Commitment

1682719,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00GXG5KLY,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 7]","I&#8217;m the first to admit that I don&#8217;t have a firm grasp on all of the geopolitical history involving North and South Korea.  In fact &#8211; outside of what little bit that got covered several decades back in high school history class &#8211; most of what I do know I&#8217;ve learned from the movies from South Korea.  Granted, that recounting might end up being a bit more one-sided than Kim Jong-un would have you believe, but &#8211; if the American media has taught me anything &#8211; the current dictator seems far too obsessed with Dennis Rodman than he need be.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)After his father is killed on a spy mission gone bad to the south, North Korean teenager Myung-hoon (played with suitable simmering restraint by Choi Seung-hyun) has no choice but to assume responsibility for his sister Hye-in (Han Ye-ri) and fill in his late dad&#8217;s shoes, submitting to be trained as a government assassin.  After his two-year indoctrination, he infiltrates South Korea as a defected teenager, where he meets a classmate also named Hye-in (Kim Yoo-jeong) who he befriends from school bullies.  When a change in political influences back home requires selling out all field operatives beyond the border, Myung-hoon suddenly finds himself fighting for his life against killers and the police bent on bringing him down.  In the end, he&#8217;ll risk it all to finally get his sister free from the clutches of those who destroyed his family.While it&#8217;s carefully packaged as a contemporary action film / political thriller, COMMITMENT is more aptly described as a hard-boiled drama.  (I&#8217;ve read and watched more than the average viewer, so I&#8217;d like to think I can spot one when I see it.)  It dabbles in noir sensibilities, but most of its characters are too squeaky clean to truly be attributed with that genre.  Rather, this one is mostly about some mildly over-the-top premises (characters and situations that likely couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t exist in reality to the extent that they&#8217;re defined here) all funneling to serve the traditional &#8216;actioner&#8217; conceits.To that end, Choi Seung-hyun&#8217;s Myung is great.  His is a somewhat troubled loner once he&#8217;s been fully trained and dispatched to do the North&#8217;s dirty work behind-enemy-lines (as it were).  He&#8217;s blessed with a heart of gold (he only wants to protect his sister from the labor camps), and he&#8217;s given a surrogate to protect in her absence (Kim Yoo-jeong&#8217;s Hye-in) who ends up flirting with his affections.  Once the regime changes back in the North and circumstances require Myung&#8217;s death, it&#8217;s kinda/sorta a convenient script convention that he&#8217;ll be required to save both young women and perhaps make the ultimate sacrifice of his &#8216;commitment&#8217; in the process.But, oh, what a glorious sacrifice, indeed!Director Park Hong-soo wrings some solid tension from Myung&#8217;s predicament, and the screenplay by Kim Soo-Young spaces out the action pieces far enough from one another that the players actually have some space to do some small things with what might otherwise be fairly standard character development.  Myung and Hye-in have a few moments to explore who they are respectively, and, while the film carefully never gives in to sentiments that these two will somehow find a few to be together, the picture certainly manages to pull at the viewer&#8217;s heartstrings by showing us Myung watching her while she&#8217;s sleeping, watching her while she&#8217;s dancing alone, and (dare I say?) protecting her from a blast of dynamite tearing about the politically-driven world around them.No one&#8217;s ever destined to be together in hard-boiled fiction.  In fact, that&#8217;s often the theme explored by the deluded, flawed lead.  While Myung is allowed to hint at a possible future, I suspect he knew his days were numbered, and that&#8217;s what makes the end so tragic but still a bit predictable if (and only if) you know a thing or two about hard-boiled prose.  That doesn&#8217;t keep the conclusion from being expected, and (thankfully) it doesn&#8217;t keep it from being any less exciting.COMMITMENT (2013) is produced by The Lamp and Golden Fish Pictures.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Korean-spoken-language release with English subtitles available.  (There is no English-dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications, this is one sharply made film with the highest quality sight and sound available.  Lastly &#8211; as is too often the case when these foreign films find release on American shores &#8211; there are no real special features to speak of: there&#8217;s a brief (10 minute) &#8216;making of&#8217; short along with the theatrical trailer.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I think some of the politics were a bit muddled unnecessarily in the English-dubbed translation of COMMITMENT, and I found the backstory involving feuding terrorism cells to have been a touch more confusing than it needed to be.  Also, a few early scenes were a tad too melodramatic.  But everything else &#8211; and I do mean everything else &#8211; about the film is pretty spectacular in my book.  Once the set-up is established and the audience knows what&#8217;s at stake, COMMITMENT is dynamite entertainment, topped off by brilliant performances from relative newcomers Choi Seung-hyun and Kim Yoo-jeong.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well GO USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of COMMITMENT by request for the expressed

After his father&#8217;s botched espionage mission, Myung-hoon (Choi Seung-hyun) and his sister are sent to a labor prison camp. To save his sister&#8217;s life, Myung-hoon volunteers to become a spy and infiltrates the South as a teenage defector.While attending high school in the South, he meets a pretty girl named Hye-in (Kim Yoo-jeong), an aspiring dancer, and rescues her when she is attacked. South Korean Intelligence soon discovers the plot and begins closing in on Myung-hoon while his own government sends a vicious assassin to eliminate him. Action dominates this fast-paced melodrama with car chases, explosions, and expertly choreographed fight sequences.Myung-hoon uses his martial arts skills to confront school bullies and in his capacity as a spy. Choi Seung-hyun is a pop superstar, heading one of Korea&#8217;s biggest groups, Big Bang. It&#8217;s interesting to see this sweet-faced guy playing a professional killer. The movie portrays high school as a place where discipline is lax and gangs intimidate both students and teachers.The film is in Korean, with English subtitles.
