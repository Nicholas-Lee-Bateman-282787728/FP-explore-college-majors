779372,A1A6K6KF7A5IMU,B0000DJZAR,"""antonfurst""","[15, 21]","this is absolutely awful. I have been a fan of this band for almost 22 years since I first saw them on Solid Gold back in 1982. I cannot tell you how terrible this DVD really is. Back in 1984 Culture Club had a fabulous concert on VHS titled A Kiss Across the Ocean which featured music from their first 2 albums, Kissing To Be Clever and Colour By Numbers. That was really worth its money but I cannot say the same for this. This is suppossed to be a 20th anniversary and it is ghastly. The show starts with a fantastic Boy George impersonator (you can tell because Boy is really fat now) and then it goes down from there. When Boy hits the stage he is dressed up in a clown outfit to promote Taboo his failed musical about the life of club sensation, Leigh Bowery. He does his best to belt out the classics such as Time, Do You Really,and The Crying Game. Which was nice to hear but then he turns on his fans and yells at them and berrates them to a pulp for talking? Why would you do this George? The band is really remarkable as always but Boy just comes off as a snob! The fact that the DVD was a ploy to promote the TABOO Broadway would have been quite clever if it really was interesting to begin with. I was expecting to see the history of the band or a cool documentary. Unfortunately, this was not a part of the package and it was rather disappointing. I used to really enjoy Boy and the band but those days are over. Who would have guessed that this once amazing band would adopt a circus like atmosphere to eclipse their legacy?",1,Save Your MONEY FOLKS,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,1540,"['absolutely', 'awful', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'band', 'almost', '22', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'Solid', 'Gold', 'back', '1982', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'terrible', 'DVD', 'really', 'Back', '1984', 'Culture', 'Club', 'had', 'fabulous', 'concert', 'VHS', 'titled', 'Kiss', 'Ocean', 'featured', 'music', 'first', '2', 'albums', 'Kissing', 'Be', 'Clever', 'Colour', 'Numbers', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'suppossed', 'be', '20th', 'anniversary', 'ghastly', 'show', 'fantastic', 'Boy', 'George', 'impersonator', 'can', 'tell', 'Boy', 'really', 'fat', 'now', 'then', 'down', 'there', 'When', 'Boy', 'stage', 'dressed', 'up', 'clown', 'outfit', 'promote', 'Taboo', 'failed', 'musical', 'life', 'club', 'sensation', 'Leigh', 'Bowery', 'best', 'belt', 'out', 'classics', 'such', 'Time', 'Do', 'Really', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Which', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'then', 'fans', 'yells', 'pulp', 'talking', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'George', 'band', 'really', 'remarkable', 'always', 'Boy', 'just', 'off', 'snob', 'fact', 'DVD', 'was', 'ploy', 'promote', 'TABOO', 'Broadway', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'clever', 'really', 'was', 'interesting', 'begin', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'history', 'band', 'cool', 'documentary', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'package', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'used', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Boy', 'band', 'days', 'are', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'once', 'amazing', 'band', 'would', 'adopt', 'circus', 'atmosphere', 'eclipse', 'legacy']",N/A

779377,AFPQVUEI3D46K,B0000DJZAR,"Mr. Stanley M. Schmidt ""boymitch""","[14, 18]","I've been a fan, a true fan, of Culture Club's for 21 years and I'm not one bit afraid to admit it!  I finally got around to watching this concert and I'm kicking myself I didn't watch it six weeks ago, when I bought it.  This is FANTASTIC!  Why is it fantastic?  Here's why:1) The sound quality is amazing.  The mixers show they are true professionals.  Most of the songs sounded like the studio versions, yet they were live.  George's voice is rested and sounds brilliant.2) It's simply about the music.  Sure, George came out in this less than flattering pink and black checkered frock with the illusion of an extreme behind, plus a pointed devil-like headdress that was a little distracting, BUT - the music spoke for itself.  His facial expressions were second to none.  You could tell he ENJOYED performing.  No pressure, no quotas, no nothing...just the music.3) This DVD comes with extra features that really add the overall production value of this release.  Pictures, commentary and some behind the scenes looks at his Taboo musical.  One of the definite highlights was the performance of Talk Amongst Yourselves, from Taboo.  Lynn Paul delivers a spectacular vocal performance.  If you have the soundtrack to Taboo, you'll be amazed at how she nails this.Even after 20 years, they've still got the magic.  George doesn't look like he's aged a single day.  The others, except for Mikey Craig, are not aging all that well, but how did you look two decades ago?  Viva Culture Club.  They will always be remembered as one of the most influencial bands of the 80s and possibly the 20th Century.",5,It's simply about the music...,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1600,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'true', 'fan', 'Culture', 'Club', '21', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'afraid', 'admit', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'concert', ""'m"", 'kicking', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'six', 'weeks', 'ago', 'when', 'bought', 'FANTASTIC', 'Why', 'fantastic', 'Here', 'why:1', 'sound', 'quality', 'amazing', 'mixers', 'show', 'are', 'true', 'professionals', 'Most', 'songs', 'sounded', 'studio', 'versions', 'yet', 'were', 'live', 'George', 'voice', 'rested', 'brilliant.2', 'simply', 'music', 'Sure', 'George', 'came', 'out', 'less', 'flattering', 'pink', 'black', 'checkered', 'frock', 'illusion', 'extreme', 'behind', 'pointed', 'devil-like', 'headdress', 'was', 'little', 'distracting', 'BUT', 'music', 'spoke', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'second', 'none', 'could', 'tell', 'ENJOYED', 'performing', 'pressure', 'quotas', 'nothing', 'just', 'music.3', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'really', 'add', 'overall', 'production', 'value', 'release', 'Pictures', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'Taboo', 'musical', 'One', 'definite', 'highlights', 'was', 'performance', 'Talk', 'Amongst', 'Taboo', 'Lynn', 'Paul', 'spectacular', 'vocal', 'performance', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'Taboo', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'nails', 'this.Even', '20', 'years', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'magic', 'George', ""n't"", 'look', 'aged', 'single', 'day', 'others', 'Mikey', 'Craig', 'are', 'not', 'aging', 'well', 'how', 'did', 'look', 'two', 'decades', 'Viva', 'Culture', 'Club', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'most', 'influencial', 'bands', '80s', 'possibly', '20th', 'Century']",N/A

I dont even want to go back to it.  What happened?  I have always been the Boy's biggest fan, which is why I was thrilled to get this in the mail from Amazon.  I was sooo not pleased.  This is absolutely HORRENDOUS!  George sounds like he's completely drugged out and none of the songs even sound like they should.  I guess you can say that he's the first artist in history who murdered his own music.  Terrible, awful, and completely disposable!  I'm sorry, but I can't believe this was even released to the buying public.  DON'T waste your time and money. A much better option would be their newly-released Greatest Hits DVD with all the videos, including great extras like a ten-minute interview with the band, and their ""A Kiss Across The Ocean"" concert in December' 83, which is even better than the videos and makes the price sooo worth it!
