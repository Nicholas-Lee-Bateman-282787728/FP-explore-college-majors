It is clear that there was a good director behind this movie. However, the story is very very soap opera-like and the main characters' acting is stunningly inept.The ""love"" story is really a one-sided thing between Nello, one of the dumbest characters you will ever see on screen and Angela, a beautiful but shallow and ruthlessly manipulative woman. Even in a movie world where love is blind (pun not intended) the dumbness of Nello is astounding. The fact that his love is purely due to Angela's appearance makes his character even less likable. He just deserves what he gets, and he's even happy at the end.But the unlikeable two main characters and the annoying ""love story"" are not the worst thing of this movie. There are, after all, several exceptional movies centered around unlikable characters. The acting is what's really terrible here. Minor characters are, in most cases, played very well by serious actors (Angela and Nello's fathers, the director of the school where Nello teaches). But Nello and Angela are impersonated by stunningly bad actors. Incontrada, not being Italian, has been dubbed, and unfortunately the woman who gives Angela her voice is as bad as she could be. She delivers every sentence as if she were in a soap commercial.I love well-made Italian movies based on small, personal stories, and I loved the images of Italy in this one, but I really cannot recommend ""Incantato"" at all, and indeed I am somewhat surprised by the positive reviews I found here.",2,"A well-directed, beautifully shot really bad soap opera (spoliers inside)",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,1678,"['am', 'Italian', 'loved', 'way', 'Bologna', 'shot', 'movie', 'Bologna', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Florence', 'Venice', 'more', 'attention', 'tourists', 'currently', 'clear', 'was', 'good', 'director', 'movie', 'However', 'story', 'very', 'very', 'soap', 'opera-like', 'main', 'characters', 'acting', 'stunningly', 'inept.The', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'one-sided', 'thing', 'Nello', 'one', 'dumbest', 'characters', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'screen', 'Angela', 'beautiful', 'shallow', 'ruthlessly', 'manipulative', 'woman', 'Even', 'movie', 'world', 'where', 'love', 'blind', 'not', 'intended', 'dumbness', 'Nello', 'astounding', 'fact', 'love', 'purely', 'due', 'Angela', 'appearance', 'character', 'even', 'less', 'likable', 'just', 'what', 'even', 'happy', 'end.But', 'unlikeable', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'annoying', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'exceptional', 'movies', 'centered', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'acting', 'what', 'really', 'terrible', 'here', 'Minor', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'cases', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'serious', 'actors', 'Angela', 'Nello', 'fathers', 'director', 'school', 'where', 'Nello', 'Nello', 'Angela', 'are', 'impersonated', 'stunningly', 'bad', 'actors', 'Incontrada', 'not', 'being', 'Italian', 'been', 'dubbed', 'unfortunately', 'woman', 'who', 'Angela', 'voice', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'sentence', 'were', 'soap', 'commercial.I', 'well-made', 'Italian', 'movies', 'based', 'small', 'personal', 'stories', 'loved', 'images', 'Italy', 'one', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Incantato', 'indeed', 'am', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'positive', 'reviews', 'found', 'here']",Incantato

As usual, the subtitles actually vary a bit from the words being spoken, but do not actually change the overall meaning. This film has some really beautiful, romantic scenes and content, but then there is also a point of betrayal. I think the film is better for Italian speaking audiences than for those reading the subtitles. Well acted, videography is good, sound is a bit lacking at a couple of points, I had to turn the sound up, and back down a time or two, to hear what the actors were saying.",4,Italian Language film,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,591,"['Note', 'first', 'spoken', 'language', 'film', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'usual', 'subtitles', 'actually', 'vary', 'bit', 'words', 'being', 'spoken', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'change', 'overall', 'meaning', 'film', 'really', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'content', 'then', 'also', 'point', 'betrayal', 'think', 'film', 'better', 'Italian', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'Well', 'acted', 'videography', 'good', 'sound', 'bit', 'lacking', 'couple', 'points', 'had', 'turn', 'sound', 'up', 'back', 'time', 'two', 'hear', 'what', 'actors', 'were', 'saying']",Incantato

The hero of the story is a 35 year old man who is attracted to women butextremely shy of them.  His father, the tailor to the Catholic Pope, is very sexual so he cannot understand what the problem is with his son.  Nevertheless, he directs him to go to Bologna in the 1920's where the man teaches Greek and Latin to students preparing for university.  At a chance encounter, he discovers a beautiful woman without sight who enchants him.  He falls in love at first glance.My favorite part of the movie is the love scene. I have NEVER seen one done properly with an extremely shy man experiencing his first sexual encounter.  Too often a film will treat the encounter comically not romantically. The scene is touching, sensitive, and erotic. This European director gets it right.Finally, the cinematography is gorgeous, particularly the scenes of glittering palaces and restaurants in Italy. In my book the movie is a winner.",5,An old fashioned love story,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,977,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'great', 'film', 'hero', 'story', '35', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'attracted', 'women', 'butextremely', 'shy', 'father', 'tailor', 'Catholic', 'Pope', 'very', 'sexual', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'problem', 'son', 'Nevertheless', 'go', 'Bologna', '1920', 'where', 'man', 'Greek', 'Latin', 'students', 'preparing', 'university', 'chance', 'encounter', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'sight', 'who', 'love', 'first', 'glance.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'love', 'scene', 'have', 'NEVER', 'seen', 'one', 'done', 'properly', 'extremely', 'shy', 'man', 'experiencing', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Too', 'often', 'film', 'will', 'treat', 'encounter', 'comically', 'not', 'romantically', 'scene', 'touching', 'sensitive', 'erotic', 'European', 'director', 'right.Finally', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'glittering', 'palaces', 'restaurants', 'Italy', 'book', 'movie', 'winner']",Incantato

974019,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000ELJA6U,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[0, 0]","This bitter-sweet love story is like a folk tale from another era - at least a century before the 1920s in which it is set. A 35-year-old tailor's son, played superbly by Neri Marcor&egrave;, with a modest innocence almost never associated with Italian men, is sent from Rome to Bologna to take a job as a classics teacher and to find a wife. There he meets and falls hopelessly in love, for the first time in his life, with a self-absorbed society girl, who happens to be blind - and in love with another man. Their relationship is both painful and poignant - played out at an almost dreamy pace against the more comic sexual antics of the supporting characters. Veteran actor Giancarlo Giannini, as the father, provides a comic energy of his own. As tailor to the Pope, he represents a vocation that has to my knowledge never been seen in a film before. The photography is lovely and the music rapturous.
