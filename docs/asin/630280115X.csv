336908,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,630280115X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","It's a shame this tidy, clever A-quality movie has such a corny B-movie title. Of course, you might not be blamed for thinking Taste of Fear is just more of the same old murderous, jump-out-and-scare-the-wheelchair-bound young heroine. There's the creepy house, the stepmother, the leaf-strewn swimming pool, the dark and disused summer house and the moveable old corpse. Maybe there's even an inheritance to think about. Taste of Fear has all this, but it also has an intelligent script full of misdirection (written by Jimmy Sangster, who also produced the movie), lots of shadowy atmosphere and some first-rate acting. Honors go to Ann Todd as the stepmother, Susan Strasberg as the shy heroine, Christopher Lee as a frequently visiting doctor and Ronald Lewis as the live-in chauffeur. Some are good guys, some are bad guys, and they all keep us guessing which is which.Young Penny Appleby (Strasberg), confined to a wheelchair, arrives on the Riviera to stay with her father and his wife, Jane (Todd). Her nurse and close friend Maggie Frencham died in a boating accident three weeks previously. Penny still hasn't recovered. She hasn't seen her father in ten years and has never met her stepmother. On the drive from the airport to her father's mansion on the Cote d'Azur, Robert the chauffeur (Lewis) mentions that her father has been ill but has left the house. When she meets Jane, Penny is told her father isn't ill and is away on business. That night she's awakened by strange noises, struggles into her wheelchair and makes her way to the summer house because she sees candlelight...and there she meets her father sitting motionless in a large wicker chair. He's as dead as a corpse can be. She screams, she faints, and when she comes to the corpse has disappeared. Doctor Gerrard, however, is there to give her a sedative. The next morning Jane calls her to the phone to speak with her father. Is Penny Appleby going mad? Why is Jane Appleby so gracious, so bossy and yet looks so worried? Why is Dr. Gerrard always around? Why is Robert so solicitous?One thing is for sure. You don't want to be Penny Appleby alone at night in the old mansion, not when the lighting is so weird you might think you were in a horror movie.Ann Todd in the prime of her career was one of Britain's star actresses, cool, blonde and with a hint of deeper possibilities. She also could play effortlessly the kind of aristocratic, well-bred wife who would make a passionate man irritable. On balance, I liked her. You can see her at her best, if you like cool elegance, inThe Seventh VeilandThe Sound Barrier.Taste of Fear is available on DVD as part of the Icons of Horror series.",4,"Constantly finding the wet corpse of her father really bothers young, shy Penny Appleby.

336909,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,630280115X,Dave. K,"[0, 0]","Scream of Fear was an excellent if not a little clich&eacute;d; don't really go in expecting a horror movie, while it does have the elements of a horror flick, it's much more of a suspense/thriller and it's damn creepy at times.Susan Strasberg stars as Penny Appleby who was paralyzed is from a horsing accident years ago. Penny arrives in France to visit her father, whom she hasn't seen in 10-years. When she arrives, Penny meets her step-mother Jane Appleby (Ann Todd) for the first time and informs her that her father had to leave on a business trip and will be back in a few days.One night while investigating the house in her wheelchair, Penny enters a dark room and finds the corpse of her father. She rushes out in fear and when help arrives and they go back into the room the body is gone. She is convinced it was all in her head, but when it happens again Penny suspects somebody is up to know good.The cast is excellent and all play their roles to near perfection with Susan Strasberg being the stand-out. She gives one hell of a performance. Christopher Lee also appears in a small role. Like always Lee is excellent, but he doesn't serve much to the story besides being a suspect. And as I stated before the cast is great here. But Strasberg was the stand-out.The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster was excellent. The characters for the most part are very well-written for and have a lot of depth. This is how you write a classic suspense/thriller. The script is as good as any you will find.Director Seth Holt keeps things moving at an excellent pace. While there were some moments where Scream of Fear might have dragged on, but overall from the start of the film all the way till the end Seth Holt crafts a great thriller, with many very creepy moments.What I loved about Scream of Fear is at first you never quite know if Penny is actually seeing the corpse or if it's in her head, but it's not dragged out and by the middle of the movie what is going is figured out. I thought for sure Scream of Fear might lose its edge now. But I was wrong the tension still doesn't let up.I have seen many movies like Scream of Fear so it's normally very easy to spot the plot twists, but I have to admit the first twist I didn't see coming. When it happened I was actually surprised and even caught off guard. There is one last twist and this one doesn't work as well, but in no way does it hurt the movie at all.Due to the plot twists there are a couple of plot-holes. I can't even begin to describe them since it would ruin the movie. But the plot-holes are easy to look over when a movie is as good as Scream of Fear.Sadly the movie is out of print, but it sometimes pops up on Turner Classic Movies. I very much recommend this movie to horror fans; if you are a fan of 60s horror or Hammer films in general you might find yourself enjoying this and wondering how you missed out on it all these years.Scream of Fear also goes under the title Taste of Fear.",4,Excellent and creepy thriller.,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,2959,"['Scream', 'Fear', 'was', 'excellent', 'not', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'expecting', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'elements', 'horror', 'flick', 'much', 'more', 'suspense/thriller', 'damn', 'creepy', 'times.Susan', 'Strasberg', 'stars', 'Penny', 'Appleby', 'who', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'horsing', 'accident', 'years', 'ago', 'Penny', 'France', 'visit', 'father', 'whom', ""n't"", 'seen', '10-years', 'When', 'Penny', 'step-mother', 'Jane', 'Appleby', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'first', 'time', 'informs', 'father', 'had', 'leave', 'business', 'trip', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'few', 'days.One', 'night', 'investigating', 'house', 'wheelchair', 'Penny', 'dark', 'room', 'corpse', 'father', 'out', 'fear', 'when', 'help', 'arrives', 'go', 'back', 'room', 'body', 'gone', 'convinced', 'was', 'head', 'when', 'again', 'Penny', 'suspects', 'somebody', 'up', 'know', 'good.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'play', 'roles', 'near', 'perfection', 'Susan', 'Strasberg', 'being', 'stand-out', 'one', 'hell', 'performance', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'always', 'Lee', 'excellent', ""n't"", 'serve', 'much', 'story', 'being', 'suspect', 'stated', 'cast', 'great', 'here', 'Strasberg', 'was', 'stand-out.The', 'screenplay', 'Jimmy', 'Sangster', 'was', 'excellent', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'have', 'lot', 'depth', 'how', 'write', 'classic', 'suspense/thriller', 'script', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'find.Director', 'Seth', 'Holt', 'things', 'moving', 'excellent', 'pace', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'Scream', 'Fear', 'might', 'have', 'dragged', 'overall', 'start', 'film', 'way', 'end', 'Seth', 'Holt', 'great', 'thriller', 'many', 'very', 'creepy', 'moments.What', 'loved', 'Scream', 'Fear', 'first', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'Penny', 'actually', 'seeing', 'corpse', 'head', 'not', 'dragged', 'out', 'middle', 'movie', 'what', 'going', 'figured', 'out', 'thought', 'sure', 'Scream', 'Fear', 'might', 'lose', 'edge', 'now', 'was', 'wrong', 'tension', 'still', ""n't"", 'let', 'up.I', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'Scream', 'Fear', 'normally', 'very', 'easy', 'spot', 'plot', 'twists', 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'When', 'happened', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'even', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'one', 'last', 'twist', 'one', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'hurt', 'movie', 'all.Due', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'couple', 'plot-holes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'plot-holes', 'are', 'easy', 'look', 'over', 'when', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Scream', 'Fear.Sadly', 'movie', 'print', 'sometimes', 'up', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'fan', '60s', 'horror', 'Hammer', 'films', 'general', 'might', 'find', 'enjoying', 'wondering', 'how', 'missed', 'out', 'years.Scream', 'Fear', 'also', 'title', 'Taste', 'Fear']",N/A

336911,A30TK6U7DNS82R,630280115X,Kevin Killian,"[5, 5]","Why wasn't Susan Strasberg a bigger star?  She certainly rules this movie, even though she's confined to a wheelchair for all but a few scenes, and spends a lot of time slung over the chauffeur's shoulder like a spare tire.  Throughout, even when scared out of her wits, she remains lovely and even regal, like Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.  She's sort of a cross between Hepburn and Natalie Wood I think, with something of Natalie's nervous modernity.  While we were watching this, we were thinking, ""She's so young, was she already reduced to B-movies for Hammer?""  And even though Penny Abbleby's a terrific part, it's rather sad that Hollywood apparently couldn't find a place for her.Ann Todd is almost as good as the girl's stepmother, Jane.  Todd's cool blonde good looks gave her a bit of the old Joan Fontaine authority, and in her career she specialized in playing either sweet little innocent Quaker type girls, or coldblooded tramps and killers.  David Lean was addicted to her and starred her in four 50s features, but by the time of SCREAM OF FEAR she looks older than her actual age (she was 41 at the time), sort of beat up, though she wears her clothes beautifully and can turn on the allure whenever she likes.Maybe it's cheating a bit to have cast, as Mr. Appleby Senior, someone with such a horrible look.  He would be creepy as a corpse or even a human.  We thought it was Boris Karloff in his Wurdalak makeup through most of the picture, that's how gruesome he looks.  Whereas according to the story, he might as well have been played by a handsome fortyish man, a Tyrone Power instead of a Frankenstein.  The Hammer touch?In fact the costumes tell the whole story.  Penny's little cocktail dresses, her various strings of pearls; Jane's pantsuits cut to perfection to accentuate her beautiful legs and hips, and then there's Rob, the chauffeur (played by the divine Ronald Lewis).  When Rob pads out to the swimming pool and volunteers to search it, wearing a I don't know what to call it, but it's like a miniature piece of soft dark felt molding his butt and caressing his formidable package, I was like, mail me that swimsuit ASAP, please movie gods, I feel a seizure coming on.We guessed 75 per cent of the ending but there was a good 25 percent we didn't figure on.  All in all a stylish diversion with some astonishing acting (and whatever you'd say Ronald Lewis was doing to that loincloth).",5,Scream and Scream Again,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,2424,"['Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Susan', 'Strasberg', 'bigger', 'star', 'certainly', 'rules', 'movie', 'even', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'few', 'scenes', 'lot', 'time', 'slung', 'chauffeur', 'shoulder', 'spare', 'tire', 'Throughout', 'even', 'when', 'scared', 'wits', 'lovely', 'even', 'regal', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'sort', 'cross', 'Hepburn', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'think', 'something', 'Natalie', 'nervous', 'modernity', 'were', 'watching', 'were', 'thinking', 'so', 'young', 'was', 'already', 'reduced', 'B-movies', 'Hammer', 'even', 'Penny', 'Abbleby', 'terrific', 'part', 'rather', 'sad', 'Hollywood', 'apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'place', 'her.Ann', 'Todd', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'girl', 'stepmother', 'Jane', 'Todd', 'cool', 'blonde', 'good', 'looks', 'gave', 'bit', 'old', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'authority', 'career', 'specialized', 'playing', 'sweet', 'little', 'innocent', 'Quaker', 'type', 'girls', 'coldblooded', 'tramps', 'killers', 'David', 'Lean', 'was', 'addicted', 'starred', 'four', '50s', 'features', 'time', 'SCREAM', 'OF', 'FEAR', 'older', 'actual', 'age', 'was', '41', 'time', 'sort', 'beat', 'up', 'clothes', 'beautifully', 'can', 'turn', 'allure', 'whenever', 'likes.Maybe', 'cheating', 'bit', 'have', 'cast', 'Mr.', 'Appleby', 'Senior', 'someone', 'horrible', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'creepy', 'corpse', 'even', 'human', 'thought', 'was', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Wurdalak', 'makeup', 'most', 'picture', 'how', 'gruesome', 'Whereas', 'according', 'story', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'handsome', 'fortyish', 'man', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'instead', 'Frankenstein', 'Hammer', 'touch', 'fact', 'costumes', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'Penny', 'little', 'cocktail', 'dresses', 'various', 'strings', 'pearls', 'Jane', 'pantsuits', 'cut', 'perfection', 'accentuate', 'beautiful', 'legs', 'hips', 'then', 'Rob', 'chauffeur', 'played', 'divine', 'Ronald', 'Lewis', 'When', 'Rob', 'out', 'swimming', 'pool', 'volunteers', 'search', 'wearing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'call', 'miniature', 'piece', 'soft', 'dark', 'felt', 'molding', 'butt', 'caressing', 'formidable', 'package', 'was', 'mail', 'swimsuit', 'ASAP', 'please', 'movie', 'gods', 'feel', 'seizure', 'coming', 'on.We', 'guessed', '75', 'cent', 'ending', 'was', 'good', '25', 'percent', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'stylish', 'diversion', 'astonishing', 'acting', ""'d"", 'say', 'Ronald', 'Lewis', 'was', 'doing', 'loincloth']",N/A

Tsk tsk!Spooky Hammer film, made at about the same time as Psycho but is certainly not a Psycho=wannabe.Susan Strasburg plays the woman who is the daughter of a rich man, estranged for nine years.  She is a cripple and tied to her wheelchair.  Christopher Lee plays the doctor with his awful French accent.  However, thankfully a small part.The movie centers around three players:  the daughter, the stepmother, the chauffeur (did the butler do it??) and we later find, a will.  Yes, there's always a will.In this case, where there's a will, there's a way!The moody photography and music add to the suspense -- the loud bangs, the shocking screams and the body of father suddenly appearing, then disappearing.  Is it her imagination or is someone attempting to drive her mad?And what of the chauffeur?  And what of a possible romance?
