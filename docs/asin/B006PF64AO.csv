We saw CT here in Houston in November, 2011 - my husband's first time - and I'd wondered whether the loss of two original members, Paul and Damian, would affect the sound of the group because both were strong vocally.  Within the first minute of their first ensemble offering, the truth was told...if anything, the mix is even better than before.  Truth be told, it's difficult to even compare each of them with their predecessor.  Daniel's so young and his voice is so pure, it's hard to recall when Damian was that age (he's now a cast member of Fox's hit show, ""Glee"" and has been nominated for an award as Outstanding Young Performer.  Paul Byrum is a classically-trained tenor and is now performing in his first solo tour (although Damian and other CT members have been known to pop in and join him occasionally.)  Emmett's pure Irish tenor is amazing and I'm looking forward to hearing the songs he did so well here in Houston.Don't mistake this for a group of Irish Musicians doing typically Irish music because while you won't be disappointed, what they provide is so much more.  I've ordered both the DVD and CD because there are usually significant differences with both.  As an added treat, Damian McGinty cut a ""farewell"" number for all his fans in case he was chosen for Glee - I'm anxious to hear him.  Daniel is now a ""Guest Artist"" with CT, but I truly hope that he'll become a regular very soon.  Hope y'all will enjoy these as much as I know that I will.

1518788,A2Z7H3CN0OHOR1,B006PF64AO,"Clara ""Maeve Binchy fan""","[1, 1]","I just got the DVD of Voyage and it is Celtic Thunder's best show yet!  They do a mix of Irish and American songs and a couple of comedy numbers.  Neil's much more confident in this show now that he is a full member of the group.  Emmett makes you forget there ever was a Paul.  His rendition of ""Isle of Hope Isle of Tears"" moved me to tears.  I think Emmett works better than Paul because he is an Irish tenor rather than a tenor/soprano as Paul is.  There were many songs that Paul just couldn't do bcause his voice wasn't right for them.  Daniel is so cute!  He is treated by the group as their little brother and they tease him on the stage.  Their first number is in Gaelic which makes you at first wonder where this show is going, but it is beautifully done.My only complaint is that the band has changed again!  The only original band memebers are the drummer and the whistle player who was in ""Act 2.""  The pianist is new as are all of the string memebers.  This band to me doesn't seem to have the energy and enthusiasm that the band from ""Heritage"" had.That is a small complaint, however.  Be sure and add this DVD to your Celtic Thunder library.

1518789,A3K7A04ZGA8WQA,B006PF64AO,coasteray,"[10, 10]","A few observations are in order regarding the new Celtic Thunder ""Voyage"" DVD and CD.The DVD release that came out at the end of February 2012 is just Part 1.  Part 2 will come out in the fall of 2012 with the rest of the songs from the concert.  Why not just make it a 2-disc set?  Well, check out Sharon Browne's blog on the Celtic Thunder web site.  Sorry I can't put the link here.  I tried twice, and apparently Amazon blocks that sort of thing, so just Google ""Sharon Browne blog"", and it will show up at the top of the list of choices.  Then look for her blog comments titled ""VOYAGE - DVD's vs TV show - March 14, 2012"".  There she gives a full explanation of what's going on.  It has to do with copyright law.  She mentioned keeping DVDs at about an hour in length to avoid problems.  She also said that a standard USA CD is 12 songs as compared to 16 in Europe.  I guess they can have more than the standard 12 cuts, as evidenced by the fact that all of their CDs to date have more than 12 cuts.Final observations:(1)  As I was watching the PBS airing of Voyage, I heard The Irish Rover (part of a medley?), but it doesn't appear to be on the new Voyage CD that I just sampled on Amazon.  George also sang Red Rose Cafe on the Voyage PBS show, but that song is not on the Voyage CD.  However, it is on the Heritage CD (but not the Heritage DVD), which leads to my next comment.(2)  It is a confusing and very annoying practice that songs missing from a particular Celtic Thunder DVD may appear on either a past or a future CD of a different title.  The same is true regarding songs missing from a CD appearing on another DVD.  The only way to get all the songs in both formats is to just buy all the CDs and all the DVDs.  It would be far better if the DVD and CD for a particular show would have the same track list.  No more hunting around trying to find what you're missing.(3)  As for the repeated songs, at least they are not forgetting all their songs from previous releases just because they have a new show.  If every project was nothing but all-new songs, then you'd never hear any variety of their new and old together in the same show.  Of course, the trick with repeating songs is to choose the right ones and not to overdo it.  I'm sure they get a lot of comments from fans about this sort of thing.  If you think Voyage is too full of repeats, then check out the Take Me Home DVD.  Of 29 songs, 19 are from The Show, their first DVD, leaving only 10 new ones.  Maybe that was due to that copyright issue?  Only 10 new songs, hmmm.4)  Except for ""The Show"" DVD, the ""Take Me Home"" DVD, and the two-part ""Voyage"" DVDs, all the other DVDs (It's Entertainment, Heritage, Christmas, Storm) have been close to that one-hour mark that Sharon Browne was speaking of in her blog.  This makes me wonder what we're missing from the actual concerts of these other DVDs.  I don't know myself since I have only seen the original ""The Show"" in concert.  I wonder if they sing some of their previous songs, or whether they are just plainly leaving out new songs from both the DVD and CD, though that would be a completely pointless action.  Why create new concert material and then refuse to release a lot of it on DVD and CD?  If anyone has insightful information, please share it with us.  Thanks.",4,More Voyage to come?,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3307,"['few', 'observations', 'are', 'order', 'regarding', 'new', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'Voyage', 'DVD', 'CD.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'came', 'out', 'end', 'February', '2012', 'just', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'fall', '2012', 'rest', 'songs', 'concert', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'make', '2-disc', 'set', 'Well', 'check', 'out', 'Sharon', 'Browne', 'blog', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'web', 'site', 'Sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'link', 'here', 'tried', 'twice', 'apparently', 'Amazon', 'blocks', 'sort', 'thing', 'so', 'just', 'Google', 'Sharon', 'Browne', 'blog', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'top', 'list', 'choices', 'Then', 'look', 'blog', 'comments', 'titled', 'VOYAGE', 'DVD', 'vs', 'TV', 'show', 'March', '14', '2012', 'full', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'copyright', 'law', 'mentioned', 'keeping', 'DVDs', 'hour', 'length', 'avoid', 'problems', 'also', 'said', 'standard', 'USA', 'CD', '12', 'songs', 'compared', '16', 'Europe', 'guess', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'standard', '12', 'cuts', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'CDs', 'date', 'have', 'more', '12', 'cuts.Final', 'observations', '1', 'was', 'watching', 'PBS', 'airing', 'Voyage', 'heard', 'Irish', 'Rover', 'part', 'medley', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'new', 'Voyage', 'CD', 'just', 'sampled', 'Amazon', 'George', 'also', 'sang', 'Red', 'Rose', 'Cafe', 'Voyage', 'PBS', 'show', 'song', 'not', 'Voyage', 'CD', 'However', 'Heritage', 'CD', 'not', 'Heritage', 'DVD', 'next', 'comment', '2', 'confusing', 'very', 'annoying', 'practice', 'missing', 'particular', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'DVD', 'may', 'appear', 'past', 'future', 'CD', 'different', 'title', 'same', 'true', 'regarding', 'songs', 'missing', 'CD', 'appearing', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'songs', 'formats', 'just', 'buy', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'DVD', 'CD', 'particular', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'track', 'list', 'more', 'hunting', 'trying', 'find', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', '3', 'repeated', 'songs', 'least', 'are', 'not', 'forgetting', 'songs', 'previous', 'releases', 'just', 'have', 'new', 'show', 'project', 'was', 'nothing', 'all-new', 'songs', 'then', ""'d"", 'never', 'hear', 'variety', 'new', 'old', 'together', 'same', 'show', 'course', 'trick', 'repeating', 'songs', 'choose', 'right', 'ones', 'not', 'overdo', ""'m"", 'sure', 'get', 'lot', 'comments', 'fans', 'sort', 'thing', 'think', 'Voyage', 'too', 'full', 'repeats', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'DVD', '29', 'songs', '19', 'are', 'Show', 'first', 'DVD', 'leaving', 'only', '10', 'new', 'ones', 'Maybe', 'was', 'due', 'copyright', 'issue', 'Only', '10', 'new', 'songs', 'hmmm.4', 'Show', 'DVD', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'DVD', 'two-part', 'Voyage', 'DVDs', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Entertainment', 'Heritage', 'Christmas', 'Storm', 'have', 'been', 'close', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'Sharon', 'Browne', 'was', 'speaking', 'blog', 'wonder', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'actual', 'concerts', 'other', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'original', 'Show', 'concert', 'wonder', 'sing', 'previous', 'songs', 'are', 'just', 'plainly', 'leaving', 'out', 'new', 'songs', 'DVD', 'CD', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'pointless', 'action', 'Why', 'create', 'new', 'concert', 'material', 'then', 'refuse', 'release', 'lot', 'DVD', 'CD', 'anyone', 'insightful', 'information', 'please', 'share', 'Thanks']",Voyage

The members of the cast are slightly different, in that Damian has been replaced by a youngster who is about in the 7th grade or so, and his voice has yet to change from soprano.  The operatic voice of Paul has been replaced by a young man who is a tenor, but of no great merit.  Several of the songs on this DVD are retreads, sung by the same singers on earlier discs.  The DVD includes a special file of extra material, such as backstage and rehearsal stuff.  It includes outtakes of what we are to presume is this show, but these include songs that are not part of the collection on the DVD.

Those are on albums that I have.  I don't know if there are more that are on other albums.  I really like those songs but would like to hear different songs. I know they don't put the whole show on the DVD so there must be other new songs that could be on the DVD instead of repeats.

All the rest is in English, with at least one performed in an older, but clearly understandable, form of English.  It's a very nice concert, but it's edited to last about 56 minutes, so it's a little short and it felt a little incomplete and truncated.  I would have loved to see and hear a few more songs, especially from Mr. Donaldson.~~~[Update: March 12, 2012][Other reviewers have compared the DVD to the PBS special.  I watched Boston's PBS special a couple of days ago, and the PBS concert does contain quite a few more songs than the DVD. Plus, the TV special was in high definition with excellent sound and much better picture quality in comparison to the DVD. Still, the DVD looks and sounds good and I enjoyed it.]",5,7th concert DVD,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,1582,"['First', 'here', 'song', 'list', '56:12', '1', 'Atmos', 'Druids', 'Deas', 'Meus2', 'Dulaman3', 'Isle', 'Hope', 'Isle', 'Tears4', 'Dutchman5', 'Jigs', 'Reels6', 'Lagan', 'Love7', 'Black', 'Color8', 'Rainbow9', 'Maid', 'Culmore10', 'Girls', 'Girls', 'Girls11', 'Red', 'Rose', 'Cafe12', 'Kindred', 'Spirits13', 'Clancy', 'Bros', 'Medley', ""'ll"", 'Tell', 'Me', 'Ma', 'Courtin', 'Kitchen', 'Irish', 'Rover', '14', 'Past', 'Point', 'Rescue15', 'Ride', 'on16', 'Day', 'Long17', 'Galway', 'GirlSecond', 'here', 'are', 'perfomers.Four', 'establshed', 'singers', 'are', 'concert.George', 'DonaldsonRyan', 'KellyNeil', 'ByrneKeith', 'HarkinTwo', 'have', 'left', 'group', 'are', 'not', 'concert.Paul', 'ByrumDamian', 'McGintyOne', 'new', 'singer', 'been', 'added.Emmett', 'CahillAnd', 'one', 'special', 'guest', 'singer', 'who', 'very', 'young', 'extremely', 'talented.Daniel', 'Furlong~~~The', 'first', 'song', 'Latin', 'second', 'song', 'Irish', 'fifth', 'song', 'jig', 'rest', 'English', 'least', 'one', 'performed', 'older', 'clearly', 'understandable', 'form', 'English', 'very', 'nice', 'concert', 'edited', 'last', '56', 'minutes', 'little', 'short', 'felt', 'little', 'incomplete', 'truncated', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'hear', 'few', 'more', 'songs', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Donaldson.~~~', '[', 'Update', 'March', '12', '2012', ']', '[', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'compared', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'special', 'watched', 'Boston', 'PBS', 'special', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'PBS', 'concert', 'contain', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'songs', 'DVD', 'TV', 'special', 'was', 'high', 'definition', 'excellent', 'sound', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'Still', 'DVD', 'good', 'enjoyed', ']']",Voyage

The vitality seemed to be nowhere.Anyone who has viewed ""Its Entertainment "" or  ""Heritage"" can see those were great as compared to this boring video.I really missed the Kiltsand there wasn't much from the drums or from the multitalented person that also played the bagpipes. Storm was also a disappointment tome as the format just didn't seem like Celtic Thunder.I currantly have all of their DVDs and have purchased all of them from amazon.I have no complaints on the quality of the DVDs. Perhaps the people that have found fault with the quality can blame it on their machine.MyDVD player was very expensive so I expected good quality.The first video put out by Celtic Thunder was also very good The producers of these shows need to know that Celtic Thunder is the sum of its parts. While the singers are great they are after all just part of what makes these DVDs sosuccessful.
