1643155,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00C7BZY4C,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Richard Leonard Kuklinski was the kind of guy you don't mess with.With a 6'5 frame, wide as well as tall, and a terrifying Fu Manchu mustache, Kuklinski cut a damn imposing figure. He had an explosive, horrific temper, prone to devastating violent outbursts. If Kuklinski was to be believed, then he killed almost 125 people, often at the behest of ruthless and dangerous Mafioso crime lords. He shot them, stabbed them, left them to be eaten by rats, strangled them, poisoned them, and according to one of his most chilling recollections, ""beat them to death just for the exercise."" But he was also a doting father and family man, and a loving, devoted, if somewhat obsessive husband....Truth is infinitely stranger than fiction, and Richard Kuklinski's sad, dark story is one of the strangest stories out there. He himself was a compelling, impressive character, far more dangerous and chilling than anything Thomas Harris or Mo Hayder could hope to invent. So who better to portray him than one of the most talented and electrifying actors of his generation,Michael Shannon?Shannon's performance is indeed the high point of the film. No blood flows through his veins, just cold ice water. Hard and chillingly removed, Shannon masters the hitman side of him that was of such great use to the DeCavalcante family and numerous loan sharks in the 70's and 80's. He is also believable as the devoted father of three. Shannon's performance as Richard Kuklinski is hardhitting and absolutely riveting. His performance alone is enough to recommend The Iceman to fans of crime drama and gritty, dark, violent character pieces.When you add to that Winona Ryder's subtle performance as Kuklinski's wife Deborah, Chris Evans unrecognizable role as fellow hitman Mr. Freezy, Ray Liotta being threatening and going all Goodfellas on us as crime lord Roy Demeo, and James Franco and David Schwimmer's short but scene-stealing roles, you have a fine cast that elevates the sub-quality material they are given.Because the saddest thing about The Iceman is it's squandered potential. The screenplay has a lack of focus, deserving something more fully formed that would do justice to the strange dark tale of crime's most prolific hitman. The direction should be stronger and more confident, but the film's cinematography, costumes, and makeup are all excellent. On the whole, I reccomend The Iceman mainly because of Michael Shannon's astonishing performance in the title role, and the standout performances of the supporting cast. While Kuklinski deserved better treatment, this is a riveting, gritty, dark, and compelling look at one of history's most disturbing and electrifying criminals. My rating? Four frozen bodies out of five.

It's a pretty straight-forward based-in-fact story of Ritchie Kuklinski who was a hitman for a an under-boss of the mob. Most of the technical aspects of the film are just fine but the storytelling is a bit flat. I don't necessarily want to see Spring Breakers here but there's a lack of impact for what this animal did. Shannon plays him with an icy detachment that could possibly perfect for the portrayal but it almost glosses-over what he did. Also, I found the motivations murky and at times I was wondering where I was in the events of the day. Because of the good production values the film is easy enough to watch but I didn't feel to much different at the end of what was apparently, but not necessarily emphasized here, a chronicle of a life full of heinous deeds.

1643162,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00C7BZY4C,California Dreaming,"[1, 2]","When you watch a film that has David Schwimmer in it, and his performance is really good, there are only two possibilities:  you are dreaming, or you're watching a really good movie that has a really good director.  And I don't think that I was dreaming this morning since I woke up pretty early.Oh, I've always thought that he was a really good director though; catch ""Trust"" if you disagree with me.  But I've always thought that he was a subpar actor, at least until now; I hated his character on ""Friends.""  But I think that maybe I've changed my mind, as his performance here -- granted, only a little bit more than a cameo -- is pretty terrific.  I'm actually looking forward to more of his performances now to see if this was simply a one-off, or if he's truly onto something at this point in his career.But this film is really strong because of its cast.  Everyone's really good, especially the male lead, Michael Shannon.  He just nails it here as ""The Iceman,"" as he's always cooler than a cucumber but still oddly a sympathetic character, especially for being a total anti-hero.  In my opinion, he's better than James Gandolfini in ""The Sopranos,"" and no, it's not too soon, even though Mr. Gandolfini was very good.  It's just that Mr. Shannon is far more believable to me as a bad guy than most that I've ever seen on screen.The one misfire:  Winona Ryder.  Now, I've always been at least a mild fan of her work, and I think that she's a very nice actress.  But her ""Joysey accent"" just didn't work in this film, and I believe that it was a requirement that it did.  Too bad, because she plays the part well, other than that.  And Ray Liotta, who was borderline lame in ""River Murders,"" seems to even return to his old acting form here.  He's pretty terrific too.But while acting is important, I believe that movies like this live or die by the screenplay.  If the writing is bad, it will be put out of it's misery quickly with one gunshot to the head.  But the dialog here is really believable; people say things that you would expect them to say, under the circumstances, and so it was allowed to live another day.I've been watching the show ""Evil, I"" lately on the ID network, and right now, it's one of my favorite shows.  It approaches killers from their first person perspectives, and I think that it almost always works.  While I'd heard of ""The Iceman"" before that show, I saw an episode that featured him, and it really made me want to see this film.  And I am glad that I followed through.  While it's hard to call ""The Iceman"" a serial killer per se -- serial killers usually kill for simply their own ""pleasure"" while Richard Kuklinski killed because, as he would probably say, ""I was just taking care of business"" -- he was definitely one of the worst contract killers ever.This film is probably more of a 4.5 to me, but I'm rounding up today.  After all, I don't want any of these bad guys to read my review, get mad, and come after my family.  To them I would say, ""Yeah, I really liked it!  You were great!""  But then again I wouldn't be lying to save my skin.",5,"Leaves ""The Sopranos"" in the Dust",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3089,"['When', 'watch', 'film', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'possibilities', 'are', 'dreaming', ""'re"", 'watching', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'dreaming', 'morning', 'woke', 'up', 'pretty', 'early.Oh', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'director', 'catch', 'Trust', 'disagree', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'subpar', 'actor', 'least', 'now', 'hated', 'character', 'Friends', 'think', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'mind', 'performance', 'here', 'granted', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'cameo', 'pretty', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'performances', 'now', 'see', 'was', 'simply', 'one-off', 'truly', 'onto', 'something', 'point', 'career.But', 'film', 'really', 'strong', 'cast', 'Everyone', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'male', 'lead', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'just', 'here', 'Iceman', 'always', 'cooler', 'cucumber', 'still', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'especially', 'being', 'total', 'anti-hero', 'opinion', 'better', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Sopranos', 'not', 'too', 'soon', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Gandolfini', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'Mr.', 'Shannon', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'bad', 'guy', 'most', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen.The', 'one', 'misfire', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'least', 'mild', 'fan', 'work', 'think', 'very', 'nice', 'actress', 'Joysey', 'accent', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'requirement', 'did', 'Too', 'bad', 'part', 'well', 'other', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'who', 'was', 'borderline', 'lame', 'River', 'Murders', 'even', 'return', 'old', 'acting', 'form', 'here', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'too.But', 'acting', 'important', 'believe', 'movies', 'live', 'die', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'misery', 'quickly', 'one', 'gunshot', 'head', 'dialog', 'here', 'really', 'believable', 'people', 'say', 'things', 'would', 'expect', 'say', 'circumstances', 'was', 'allowed', 'live', 'day.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'Evil', 'lately', 'ID', 'network', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'killers', 'first', 'person', 'perspectives', 'think', 'almost', 'always', 'works', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Iceman', 'show', 'saw', 'episode', 'featured', 'really', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'followed', 'hard', 'call', 'Iceman', 'serial', 'killer', 'se', 'serial', 'killers', 'usually', 'kill', 'simply', 'own', 'pleasure', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'killed', 'because', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'worst', 'contract', 'killers', 'ever.This', 'film', 'probably', 'more', '4.5', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'bad', 'guys', 'read', 'review', 'get', 'mad', 'come', 'family', 'would', 'say', 'Yeah', 'really', 'liked', 'were', 'great', 'then', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'lying', 'save', 'skin']",N/A

1643174,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00C7BZY4C,DanD,"[0, 0]","For over two decades, Richie Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) lived a double life: loving father/husband and cold-blooded killer.  He starts as a nobody in a porn lab, but gets promoted when his small-time crime boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes the ice in Richie's veins.  Things eventually escalate, on part because of a no-account friend of Demeo's (David Schwimmer), and Richie is forced to take action to protect his wife and daughters.THE ICEMAN is largely an actor's piece, though its plot, although starting slow, builds up to a decent pace about halfway through.  Shannon is fantastic in the central role; he always brings the same intensity to his performances, which sometimes helps (TAKE SHELTER) and sometimes doesn't (MAN OF STEEL).  The supporting cast is surprisingly strong; aside from the above (all great, especially Liotta), we get marvelous turns from Winona Ryder (who's having something of a career rebirth as a quality supporting actress), Robert Davi, Stephen Dorff, and an amazing (and unrecognizable) Chris Evans.  James Franco is also in there for about a minute, for some reason, although he's got nothing to do except make Shannon look cool.The story (a true one) is captivating, as it actually does a decent effort of contrasting Richie's personal life against his professional life.  Ariel Vromen's direction is solid and steady, and the film looks fantastic, as it moves through the decades.  But again, this is mostly an actor's piece, a chance for Shannon to shine, and for for great actors to do great work in smaller roles for little reward.  Like the great gangster films it obviously takes inspiration from, THE ICEMAN doesn't glorify, it merely portrays.  It's effectively viscous in spots (some of the violence is sudden and unsettling), and yet the family scenes are decidedly sentimental.

I was not disappointed in the film itself. The acting is good --Ryder in particular really shines--and the filming is even better. THE ICEMAN captures the 60s and 70s very well. It's tense and gripping, with a number of small twists and surprises (even though there are not a lot of really big ones).Still, this film seems to be missing a piece or two, and something more is needed. That something is probably more in the way of a beginning: THE ICEMAN is mostly middle and end. More back-story on Richard Kuklinski's early life would have provided more complete development of his character.Another issue may simply be the true story on which this film is based. It's interesting to learn the story of a less-publicized mass murderer, but, crass as it may sound, the fact that Kuklinski was a contract killer whose victims were mostly violent criminals themselves takes away a lot of the morbid fascination we find in serial killers such as Henry Lee Lucas or Ted Bundy, who murdered just for the thrill of it.I dunno, but some other reviewers have stated that the real-life Richard Kuklinski, unlike the one shown in this film, could not have cared less about his own family, would kill ANYone that got in his way, etc. Assuming that's the case, it might have made for a better film if they'd not tried to make such a noble villain out of the man and shown him as the psychopathic monster that he actually was.",4,Harrowingly Interesting,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,1523,"['3.5', 'stars', 'THE', 'ICEMAN', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'seeing', 'preview', 'thought', 'HAVE', 'see', 'ASAP', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'film', 'acting', 'good', 'Ryder', 'particular', 'really', 'shines', 'filming', 'even', 'better', 'ICEMAN', '60s', '70s', 'very', 'well', 'tense', 'gripping', 'number', 'small', 'twists', 'surprises', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'really', 'big', 'ones', '.Still', 'film', 'be', 'missing', 'piece', 'two', 'something', 'more', 'needed', 'something', 'probably', 'more', 'way', 'beginning', 'ICEMAN', 'mostly', 'middle', 'end', 'More', 'back-story', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'early', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'complete', 'development', 'character.Another', 'issue', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'interesting', 'learn', 'story', 'less-publicized', 'mass', 'murderer', 'crass', 'may', 'sound', 'fact', 'Kuklinski', 'was', 'contract', 'killer', 'victims', 'were', 'mostly', 'violent', 'criminals', 'away', 'lot', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'find', 'serial', 'killers', 'such', 'Henry', 'Lee', 'Lucas', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'who', 'murdered', 'just', 'thrill', 'it.I', 'dunno', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'real-life', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'one', 'shown', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'own', 'family', 'would', 'kill', 'ANYone', 'got', 'way', 'etc', 'Assuming', 'case', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', ""'d"", 'not', 'tried', 'make', 'such', 'noble', 'villain', 'man', 'shown', 'psychopathic', 'monster', 'actually', 'was']",N/A

Even in movies he's been in that might not have been the best movie, he's always been good. This is one of his better films.Here's the scoop. Shannon plays Richard Kuklinski. He works at a lab finishing adult movies. The big guy who owns said lab and adult film distributor (Ray Liotta) is closing the lab but sees something in Kuklinski and wants to bring him on as a hit man. Kuklinski is just now getting married (to Winona Ryder) and can use the dough. He accepts and does the job while dabbling in various markets on the side. Things begin to go south and the law starts closing in on him.This is a heck of a flick. The writing, acting, directing and music are all on par with the content. Shannon does an outstanding job. When he visits his brother in prison you realize he's a man on the edge. To him, killing is a job. If someone wants someone dead &#34;who am I to argue&#34; is his rationale. But he loves his wife and two daughters, so when their safety is compromised, his &#34;job&#34; gives way to his true nature. He is one sick dude and will kill anyone he needs to to hold on to that tiny thread of sanity.Robert Davi, Ray Liotta all do a good job. The real surprise is David Schwimmer as Liotta's underling. This has been his best effort in breaking away form his Ross persona.This is an good examination of a man who has reportedly killed more than 100 people.

1643192,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00C7BZY4C,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","There are some lives that don't require reflection in the form of film and surely the true life of professional murderer (100 killings) Richard Kuklinski is one of them. But because biographies have been written about him (Anthony Bruno's ""The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer"" and James Thebaut's documentary ""The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer""), it became a sure thing that we would have to actually watch this life on the screen (as written by Morgan Land  and director Ariel Vromen). It is disconcerting to view except for the actors who take on these rather unrewarding parts.The film opens and closes with the imprisoned Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) starring at us but quick jumps back in time to the1960s with a very different Kuklinski trying to make coffee conversation with the sweet Deborah (Winona Ryder) who eventually becomes his wife and the mother of their children - a life that is sacrosanct to Kuklinski. Kuklinski is working as a porn film lab tech until his mob bosses (Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer et al) persuade him to change his career into that of a contract killer. For years, Kuklinski gains a reputation for cold-blooded professionalism who tends to freeze his murdered victims even as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career. Unfortunately, mob politics ultimately forces him to secretly work independently with the psychopathic Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans). As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him. Among those actors who get killed almost as soon as they get on the screen is James Franco. Kuklinski is finally caught by the police (through a double cross maneuver) and is sentence to life in prison in the same cell with his brother Joey (Stephen Dorff).It is a strong cast but a very plodding script that burns out after about 45 minutes. Were it not for the cast, the final judgment of the film would be dyspeptic.

I was interested in Kuklinski when I first saw him in a series of actual, long interviews on documentary TV when they first came out, and went on to research him thoroughly. I also reviewed the interviews on Youtube.This film plays fast and loose with the truth, and is not really well put together or revealing of the sequence of events or the true character of Kuklinski. I am tired of seeing Ray Liota as a gangster. I am surprised they didn't bring in the old standard, Vincent Gardenia to play the godfather---oh...wait...he died, so OK. I always thought he was weak anyway; nothing like the people I knew in South Philly. Also, this film got just plain cartoonish and hokey in places.Anyways...Terrific acting all around, except for the rat-informant actor who just screamed all over &#34;I AM A RAT INFORMER!&#34; In actuality, the informer was deeply planted for other reasons, and Kuklinski knew the informer a long time. I thought this ending made Kuklinski look dumb, which he was not.At the very end, Michael Shannon delivers one of the greatest monologues of acting I've ever seen, in that he captures almost perfectly the living Kuklinski anyone can see in the taped interviews. It was astonishing. I just wish the director had allowed Shannon to show his range throughout the film, instead of restricting him to (truly) lethal and scary stares.We get to hear what Winona Ryder might sound like in bed and see hints of her big, smooth-looking...never mind. I thought she brought zero to the role and was just there as finance-bait.I gave this one star because it's a true story that Hollywood (once again) felt it had to change. For instance, Kuklinski didn't shoot a homeless man to prove he was a killer to the mob; he shot a total stranger who was just out walking a dog. But, see, we have to have SOME sympathy or admiration for a character or the story loses the viewer, so, I guess, Hollywood felt the homeless thing was still bad but &#34;not THAT bad.&#34; My son is a film exec' with Universal.You can watch this and be enthralled, and I recommend it.

In this R-rated thriller written and directed by Ariel Vromen, we see what shapes a contract killer, what is important to him and whether or not he holds any values. It's awkward for an audience when we find ourselves in a position to be rooting for a cold-blooded killer, and yet we really do NOT want to see his sweet family jeopardized, so we want him to survive.The cast:* Michael Shannon (""Premium Rush"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"") is Richard Kuklinski, our contract killer; he is a limited man with limited options: no education, no charm and no skills (other than lethal ones), so he does the best he can with what he has. Shannon is one of the finest actors working today and this difficult role is worthy of him.* Winona Ryder (""The Dilemma"") is Deborah Pellicotti, the shy Catholic girl who wouldn't even do any heavy petting until she was married. Her devoted husband respected and adored her.* Chris Evans (""What's Your Number?"") is Mr. Freezy, whose ubiquitous ice cream truck moves invisibly through the city. This scraggly haired thug bears NO resemblance to ""Captain America"" let me tell you!* Ray Liotta (""The Details"") is Roy Demeo, a pornographer/crime lord who tested and then exploited the ice water which ran through Kuklinski's veins.Because this takes place over a time span of nearly 20 years, you will get a kick out of the different cars, clothes, hair styles and mustaches that enjoyed passing popularity. Also, it's refreshing to see pagers and pay phones instead of the ever-present cell phones in today's world.

1643207,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00C7BZY4C,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.In every actor's career there comes a role that becomes a defining moment for them. Regardless of whether or not the film is good, their performance shows just how well they can act in any situation. After watching The Iceman, I believe wholeheartedly that this is that role for Michael Shannon. Now Shannon's always been a solid actor in my book. With the exception of Premium Rush, every performance I've seen from him has felt really smooth and natural. Not all of them were groundbreaking, but you could tell that he really gets into character. And that's exactly what he did in The Iceman as he stepped into the shoes of Richard Kuklinski and ran with it.For those of you uninformed -- I know I was -- Richard Kuklinski (aka The Iceman) was a contract killer. Before that, though, Kuklinski worked in the porn business. More specifically, he dubbed porn tapes which were then distributed by the Gambino crime family. However, one day Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta) informs Kuklinski that they were shutting the place down, leaving him without a job. Roy then offers him the job of killer-for-hire and Richard, worried about his future with his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder), accepts.As the story progresses we see glimpses of Richard doing his dirty work -- stabbing people in the parking lot, choking them on rooftops, etc. This is where The Iceman earns its R rating. However, these brutal killings never seem tacked on or out of place. On the contrary, they were almost essential in that it showed just how crazy this man's life really was. He would go to ""work"" like anyone else, kill someone, and come home to dinner with his family. It doesn't stop there, though. This double life is illustrated even more when he goes out to dinner with his friends. He not only has his wife convinced, but he has a huge lie prepared when asked about his occupation. It was all very eerie to witness.Now one of The Iceman's biggest shortcomings comes in the storytelling department. Upon being introduced to Richard, it didn't take long before I became fascinated with him. Unfortunately, while the movie has an intriguing story to tell, it doesn't tell it extremely well. Because of this, at times it felt like I was limited to the information I was receiving. In the first act of the film we see that Richard has a temper, but beyond one or two quick flashbacks later on they don't do much to explain why. We're supposed to assume it was due to childhood abuse, but I would have liked to see his past fleshed out a little more.Another thing that irritated me was the portrayal of Kuklinski's family. In reality his family is said to have been oblivious to what he did, but everyone -- especially Deborah -- always seemed on edge. They were always quick to think the worst even when they had no idea what was going on. For example, there's a point in the story where one of his daughters ends up in the hospital. As Richard goes to put his hand over hers, his wife goes ballistic and screams at him. Almost as if she knows it's the result of his lifestyle. It just didn't add up to me given the knowledge that they were unaware of what he was really doing.What really held this film together, though, was the performance given by Michael Shannon. Very early on we get a glimpse of Richard's temper and, aside from a few standout roles, I have never been more convinced by an actor's performance in my life. The only word I can use to describe it is menacing. There were times where I literally found myself intimidated by Richard as a human being. Part of it was because I knew this story was based on reality, but a bigger part of it was the result of how real Michael Shannon made him feel. It was almost as if I could reach through the screen and physically touch him. It was just a very gripping performance that's bound to leave an impression on anyone who watches the movie.Unfortunately, none of the other performers were able to replicate that sense of reality. Chris Evans was ok as Mr. Freezy and Ray Liotta was decent as well. My only complaint with Liotta is that we've seen this character from him before. I would really like to see him expand beyond this mobster corner he's painted himself into. Everyone else, on the other hand, felt really flat in comparison to Shannon. To some extent I think it's partially due to the fact that everyone else seemed more like an extra when all the spotlight was, understandably, put on Richard Kuklinski. Either way, that's no excuse for the rest of the cast to give unengaging performances.Overall Score: 7.25/10 - I'll admit that I was expecting something slightly different, but The Iceman didn't fail to entertain. Richard Kuklinski is a very interesting character and, if anything, you'll definitely be left intrigued by his life. If they would have allowed themselves a longer running time I think they could have fleshed out the story a little more, but it's still very enjoyable and most of that is due to Shannon's jaw dropping performance.",4,"7.25/10 - Shannon excels, but the narrative feels incomplete.",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,5036,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.In', 'actor', 'career',

1643218,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00C7BZY4C,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","Ever since people have been telling stories, audiences have been interested in bad guys, but it seems like the past decade or so has shown a really strong increase in the amount of entertainment that seems centered on what might be called Bad Guys. It started with the Sopranos, and has exploded into everything from Breaking Bad to Dexter to even, arguably, Mad Men and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Granted, those are just the ones I like. But even with the high-caliber hitters in that list, very rarely has a full-on dead stare at a Bad Guy been as engaging and as disturbing as this film.Perhaps that's because it's based on a true story about Richard Kuklinski, a (generally) free-lanced contract killer from New Jersey who not only had a death toll north of 100, but also lived a placid family life with a young wife and two beautiful daughters. The dichotomy of those two worlds never feels forced or contrived, and a lot of it has to do with both the script and Michael Shannon's incredible performance. There is the very tangible sense that Richard was born (perhaps bred) with a gaping void inside of him; that the crystalline part that makes us all empathetic to other humans was somehow shattered very early on and lost ... except for one, tiny shard. Michael Shannon, at first, doesn't appear to do a lot of actual acting. He lets the weight of his face hang in one cold, stony, inscrutable slab for the first third of the film. But when he is with his family and when that world begins to become precarious, Shannon somehow allows us just the briefest of flashes from that deeply buried shard of crystal, and the moments are powerful for their rarity, brevity, and hopelessness.For a film that deals with mobsters, you have some experienced talent (Robert Davi, and Liotta can't seem NOT to be in a mob/dirty cop movie these days), as well as some surprises (Schwimmer, Franco, and I had no clue I was looking at Chris Evans until the credits rolled). The pacing may be slow for some, but only for as long as it takes for you to invest yourself in our lead. Some might also find the movie disturbing, although there's less graphic violence here than I've seen in many other movies of this ilk. Perhaps what might be most disturbing to people is the idea that such a subtle division between evil and love could be hidden for so long from so many, but that's a very clear reality. And if modern entertainments have found ways to make us root for or even sympathize with and enjoy watching the Ways and Whys of Bad Guys, this movie takes a far starker approach and -- without ever giving us a good reason to love or sympathize with Richard -- it shows us just how desperate, fascinating and unknowable true, real-life bad guys can be.",5,No Sympathy Required,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,2751,"['Ever', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'telling', 'stories', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'bad', 'guys', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'shown', 'really', 'strong', 'increase', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'centered', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'started', 'Sopranos', 'exploded', 'everything', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Dexter', 'even', 'arguably', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'Granted', 'are', 'just', 'ones', 'like', 'even', 'high-caliber', 'hitters', 'list', 'very', 'rarely', 'full-on', 'dead', 'stare', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'been', 'engaging', 'as', 'disturbing', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'generally', 'free-lanced', 'contract', 'killer', 'New', 'Jersey', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'death', 'toll', 'north', '100', 'also', 'lived', 'placid', 'family', 'life', 'young', 'wife', 'two', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'dichotomy', 'two', 'worlds', 'never', 'feels', 'forced', 'contrived', 'lot', 'do', 'script', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'incredible', 'performance', 'very', 'tangible', 'sense', 'Richard', 'was', 'born', 'perhaps', 'bred', 'gaping', 'void', 'crystalline', 'part', 'empathetic', 'other', 'humans', 'was', 'somehow', 'shattered', 'very', 'early', 'lost', 'one', 'tiny', 'shard', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'first', ""n't"", 'appear', 'do', 'lot', 'actual', 'acting', 'weight', 'face', 'hang', 'one', 'cold', 'stony', 'inscrutable', 'slab', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'when', 'family', 'when', 'world', 'become', 'precarious', 'Shannon', 'somehow', 'just', 'briefest', 'flashes', 'deeply', 'buried', 'shard', 'crystal', 'moments', 'are', 'powerful', 'rarity', 'brevity', 'hopelessness.For', 'film', 'mobsters', 'have', 'experienced', 'talent', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'Liotta', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'NOT', 'be', 'mob/dirty', 'cop', 'movie', 'days', 'as', 'well', 'surprises', 'Schwimmer', 'Franco', 'had', 'clue', 'was', 'looking', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'credits', 'rolled', 'pacing', 'may', 'be', 'slow', 'only', 'as', 'long', 'invest', 'lead', 'might', 'also', 'find', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'less', 'graphic', 'violence', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'ilk', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'disturbing', 'people', 'idea', 'subtle', 'division', 'evil', 'love', 'could', 'be', 'hidden', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'many', 'very', 'clear', 'reality', 'modern', 'entertainments', 'have', 'found', 'ways', 'make', 'root', 'even', 'sympathize', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Ways', 'Whys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'movie', 'far', 'starker', 'approach', 'ever', 'giving', 'good', 'reason', 'love', 'sympathize', 'Richard', 'just', 'how', 'desperate', 'fascinating', 'unknowable', 'true', 'real-life', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'be']",N/A
1643219,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00C7BZY4C,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","Biographical movies have always provided entertainment to film going fans for years. At the same time more often than not their portrayals of those their stories are about rarely reflects the reality of the person. While this is the case with the new release THE ICEMAN perhaps it's best to write about it as a film rather than history. That being said, this is a dynamite crime drama for fans of the genre.Michael Shannon stars as Richard ""Richie"" Kuklinski, a low level criminal making film copies of porno flicks back in the 60s whose life changes when he meets Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta). Married with one child, Kuklinski's lack of fear in the face of a danger makes Demeo consider him a possibility for an enforcer's position. When he has Richie kill a bum just to show him he can kill without conscience, the position becomes his.What follows is three decades of Richie doing what he's best at which is killing people. When Demeo has someone who needs to be reminded to pay his debts, he sends Richie. If they don't follow through, Richie returns and the problem is erased. Soon people have good reason to make sure they pay on time.While doing one hit for Demeo, Richie runs into ""Mr. Freezy"" (Chris Evans), another hit man so named because he also drives an ice cream truck from neighborhood to neighborhood. Not only does this make for a great cover but the freezer inside the truck is a convenient place to store a dead body.As the story progresses problems come up and Demeo tells Richie to take a break, stop killing people and not to take any work on the side. With bills piling up Richie finds himself forced to break that promise, contacts Mr. Freezy and the duo begin piling up bodies and cash for contracts.When Demeo discovers this he threatens Richie and things begin to unwind for the hired gun. A combination of paranoia, real threats and a violent rage fueled temper that Richie always tries to keep in check will not result in anything positive. But just what happens and who it happens to is yet to be seen.Michael Shannon has become a force to behold in films these days. It's not just his physical presence that exudes danger here but the performance offers a depth of character movies like this usually don't possess. Liotta seems to have calmed down in recent films as he does here but one can't help but see the same intensity in Shannon that Liotta once brought to similar roles. Winona Ryder, long missing from movies, turns in a great performance as well as Deborah, Richie's wife and true love.What is depicted here is the tale of a man who wants what's best for his family, to provide for them as much as possible and who is willing to do anything to insure that their every dream is fulfilled. The movie presents Kuklinski as a sympathetic character that we wish could find an escape from the world he has chosen to be with his family. Unfortunately that wasn't the reality of the Richard Kuklinski. The movie may make for a great story and well made film, but it does so by changing most of the true story into something else.While an afterward mentions that Kuklinski is estimated to have killed 100 people before the ending presented here it rarely discusses his victims. I could be wrong but I also don't think most of us would decide that the best way to provide for our families would be to begin killing people which here is presented as Kuklinski's best option. More changes between his real story as told in the book THE ICEMAN: THE TRUE STORY OF A COLD BLOODED KILL by Anthony Bruno and what we're presented with here are best left to those interested in the book. If all you see is the film you will be entertained.

Yeah, there's a few minor flaws here. The first mistake is one that I would consider to be debatable - using Anthony Bruno's book as a key reference instead of the late Philip Carlo's. IMO Carlo's was superior to the former. The second being a somewhat sketchy plot. For those who don't know, Kuklinski (Shannon) was a killer living in Bergen County and worked in the porn business before doing contract killings for Roy Demeo (Liotta) of a Brooklyn faction in the Gambino Family. An awesome cameo from Stephen Dorff as Richard's deranged child rapist/murderer brother Joe Kuklinski is spot-on, and Shannon's dead-on impersonation of Kuklinski's HBO interviews is chilling. Schwimmer is hilariously sleazy as Josh Rosenthal (character's real name was Chris Rosenberg, Demeo's ""adopted son"") Oh, and there's a terrific scene in a disco, involving John Ventimiglia (Artie Bucco from Sopranos), with Blondie's 'Heart of Glass' blasting in the backround, that you have to see to believe.3 stars.",3,I'm not asking for forgiveness and I'm not repenting,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1278,"['Michael', 'Shannon', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'David', 'Schwimmer', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'lead', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'dark', 'attempt', 'bring', 'true', 'story', 'Jersey', 'City-bred', 'mob', 'contract', 'killer', 'Richard', 'Iceman', 'Kuklinski', 'big', 'screen', 'almost', 'Yeah', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'here', 'first', 'mistake', 'one', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'debatable', 'using', 'Anthony', 'Bruno', 'book', 'key', 'reference', 'instead', 'late', 'Philip', 'Carlo', 'IMO', 'Carlo', 'was', 'superior', 'former', 'second', 'being', 'somewhat', 'sketchy', 'plot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kuklinski', 'Shannon', 'was', 'killer', 'living', 'Bergen', 'County', 'worked', 'porn', 'business', 'doing', 'contract', 'killings', 'Roy', 'Demeo', 'Liotta', 'Brooklyn', 'faction', 'Gambino', 'Family', 'awesome', 'cameo', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Richard', 'deranged', 'child', 'rapist/murderer', 'brother', 'Joe', 'Kuklinski', 'spot-on', 'Shannon', 'dead-on', 'impersonation', 'Kuklinski', 'HBO', 'interviews', 'chilling', 'Schwimmer', 'hilariously', 'sleazy', 'Josh', 'Rosenthal', 'character', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Chris', 'Rosenberg', 'Demeo', 'adopted', 'son', 'Oh', 'terrific', 'scene', 'disco', 'involving', 'John', 'Ventimiglia', 'Artie', 'Bucco', 'Sopranos', 'Blondie', ""'Heart"", 'Glass', 'blasting', 'backround', 'have', 'see', 'believe.3', 'stars']",N/A

1643226,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00C7BZY4C,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","There may be spoilers.This is a factually based film which follows the adult crime life of notorious hit-man Richard Kuklinski.  Set in New Jersey, the story follows Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) from his early (1950's) introduction to crime boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) to his capture in the mid-1980's.Kuklinski, a hulking figure, keeps an internal rage always in check, thus his nickname.  But make no mistake, he is a cold blooded assassin and only cares about 3 people.  His wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) and his 2 daughters.  Kuklinski dispatches friends with the same coolness as he does a stranger or an enemy.  Although I had a hard time understanding the attraction Deborah had for the mealy-mouthed thug, Kuklinski somehow manages to keep her and the girls happy and in the dark about his craft.  Instead they think he is a bond and currency-trader.  OK, if you say so.Chris Evans (""Captain America"") is nearly unrecognizable as a fellow killer, as is David Schwimmer as an assistant to Demeo.  The acting is excellent, especially Shannon as the deeply dark and vicious Kuklinski.  While the film moves along briskly, it is mostly due to a mounting body count, which includes a character played by James Franco.The film is hardly perfect, which is mostly due to Ariel Vromen's sometimes clumsy direction.  He seems much more interested in dispatching victims in unnecessarily unique ways than with providing more depth as to Kuklinski's motives or history.  There is also some confusion about who is who in the crime hierarchy.  And in one scene we see a newspaper headline that mentions the killing of Roy when in fact, he hadn't been killed at that point in the story.  But then, I was a bit confused as I said.The film is dark, sinister and registers a high body count.  I have to admit however I was mesmerized by Shannon's depiction of Kuklinski.  I never felt sorry for the lug.  He got what he deserved, but his unknowing family didn't.The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  I don't think this film will make anyone's demo list.  It is about as dank and dingy as the story itself.  And I suspect that is the idea.  So while the film is a bit fuzzy, pale and bleak it is well represented in the transfer.  Grain exists but it is moderate and consistent throughout.  I thought the Dolby TruHD 5.1 audio track was excellent.  The film has plenty of environmental sounds that play to the surrounds (traffic, cats, trains, etc.) There is a club scene with a Blondie song that sounds very authentic to the setting.  Dialog is very clear and easy to understand, even with Kuklinski's mumbling through most of the film.  Extras are minimal with a ""making-of"" featurette and a behind the scenes piece about casting the film.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",4,"(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for a dark, sinister film with a high body count",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2819,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.This', 'factually', 'based', 'film', 'adult', 'crime', 'life', 'notorious', 'hit-man', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'Set', 'New', 'Jersey', 'story', 'Kuklinski', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'early', '1950', 'introduction', 'crime', 'boss', 'Roy', 'Demeo', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'capture', ""mid-1980's.Kuklinski"", 'hulking', 'figure', 'internal', 'rage', 'always', 'check', 'thus', 'nickname', 'make', 'mistake', 'cold', 'blooded', 'assassin', 'only', '3', 'people', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Winona', 'Ryder', '2', 'daughters', 'Kuklinski', 'friends', 'same', 'coolness', 'stranger', 'enemy', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'attraction', 'Deborah', 'had', 'mealy-mouthed', 'thug', 'Kuklinski', 'somehow', 'keep', 'girls', 'happy', 'dark', 'craft', 'Instead', 'think', 'bond', 'currency-trader', 'OK', 'say', 'so.Chris', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'fellow', 'killer', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'assistant', 'Demeo', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Shannon', 'deeply', 'dark', 'vicious', 'Kuklinski', 'film', 'moves', 'briskly', 'mostly', 'due', 'mounting', 'body', 'count', 'character', 'played', 'James', 'Franco.The', 'film', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'mostly', 'due', 'Ariel', 'Vromen', 'sometimes', 'clumsy', 'direction', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'dispatching', 'victims', 'unnecessarily', 'unique', 'ways', 'providing', 'more', 'depth', 'Kuklinski', 'motives', 'history', 'also', 'confusion', 'who', 'who', 'crime', 'hierarchy', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'killing', 'Roy', 'when', 'fact', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'killed', 'point', 'story', 'then', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'said.The', 'film', 'dark', 'sinister', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'have', 'admit', 'however', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'Shannon', 'depiction', 'Kuklinski', 'never', 'felt', 'sorry', 'lug', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'unknowing', 'family', ""didn't.The"", 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', 'resolution', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'demo', 'list', 'dank', 'dingy', 'story', 'suspect', 'idea', 'So', 'film', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'pale', 'bleak', 'well', 'represented', 'transfer', 'Grain', 'moderate', 'consistent', 'thought', 'Dolby', 'TruHD', '5.1', 'audio', 'track', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'plenty', 'environmental', 'sounds', 'play', 'surrounds', 'traffic', 'cats', 'trains', 'etc', 'club', 'scene', 'Blondie', 'song', 'very', 'authentic', 'setting', 'Dialog', 'very', 'clear', 'easy', 'understand', 'even', 'Kuklinski', 'mumbling', 'most', 'film', 'Extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'scenes', 'piece', 'casting', 'film', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH']",N/A

1643230,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7BZY4C,Paul Allaer,"[55, 61]","""The Iceman"" (2013 release; 106 min.; not to be confused with the 1984 movie ""Iceman"" with Timothy Hutton) brings the true-life story of Richard Kuklinski, the notorious New Jersey contract killer with a double life as devoted husband and father. As the movie opens, there is a very short glimpse of a very old Kuklinksi, saying ""I don't regret anything"", after which we are transported back in time to 1964 when Kuklinski (played by Michael Shannon) is on a date with Debbie (played by Winona Ryder). Debbie asks him what he does and he answers ""I do Disney movies"" (when in reality we later find out he works as a porn movie manufacturer). It is the beginning of a long double-life. Kuklinski and Debbie get married and soon have two young daughters. Meanwhile, Kuklinski gets involved in dubious dealings that lead him to become a contract killer. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,Several comments: this movie (which in the end credits is shown to be based on the book of the same name, as well as the infamous ""Iceman Tapes: Interviews With a Killer"") is chilling and hard-as-nails, but ultimately riveting and yes, entertaining. There isn't so much surprise as to the story (since we all pretty much know how it's going to end), but in the circumstances of the story. How was Kuklinski able to have parallel lives in which his family had no idea about his ""other life""? Director Ariel Vromen does a great job in giving us clues. About midway into the movie there is a pivotal scene in which we see Kuklinski visiting his younger brother, who it turns out is in jail for murdering a 12 yr. girl. When Kuklinski tells him he now has a wife and 2 daughters, his brother goes ballistic, telling him ""you're no better than me, we're screwed up in the head"". There is another clutch scene in the movie: Kuklinski, with his family in the car, gets involved in a fender bender, and the other driver insults/threatens his wife, which send Kuklinski over the top (I won't reveal what exactly happens).The performances in the movie are mostly outstanding, none more so than Michael Shannon, bringing a tour-de-force as we watch him in the role of Kuklinski over a 20 year period (mid-60s to mid-80s). But I was also quite impressed by Winona Ryder, whom I hadn't seen on screen in quite a while. Her role as the clueless but devoted wife and mother is top-notch. Check out also David ""Friends"" Schwimmer in a smaller role as Josh (another mobster) and James Franco in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo (less than 5 min. screen time). Please note that I did not mention Ray Liotta, I mean, how many more mobster characters can the guy still bring? There was some nice music placement, we hear ELO's ""Livin' Thing"" during a roller-skating outing of Kuklinski and his family, and later we also get Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" in a disco scene where a hit is planned.Bottom line: this movie flew by in no time for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, more so for the performances than for anything else. There are quite a bit of violent scenes, so this is probably not for anyone faint of heart. This movie showed up this weekend on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati, but I must say that, given the subject matter of the movie, I was quite surprised how well attended the screening was when I saw this. If you are in the mood for something gritty and dark with outstanding performances, you cannot go wrong with this.

1643232,A2DECXC7Y496GV,B00C7BZY4C,Phillip Tomasso III,"[0, 0]","The Iceman is a 2012 film by director, Ariel Vromen. It is a 105 minutes of nothing but tension and suspense. Based on the true story of  Richie Kuklinski (portrayed by Michael Shannon), a polish hit-man contracted by the Mafia. In his career it is said that Kuklinski killed over 100 people for the mob.It showcases a great cast. To me, unrecognizable, is Winona Ryder (who portrays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife), Ray Liotta (mob boss Roy DaMeo), Chris Evans as Mr. Freeze, and get this ... David Schwimmer from Friends (Ross) as Josh Rosenthal.Dubbing porno films for a living, Kuklinski meets Deborah, and begins their relationship on a lie, claiming to dub animated films for Disney. A man of few words, once he is married the porno business comes to an end. Roy DaMeo likes Kuklinski's cool, calm and fearless attitude. He hires him to do mob hits. The condition is Kuklinski is only to work for Roy.As in any organized crime syndicate, times are not always lucrative. In an attempt to continue to support is wife and daughters, Kuklinski teams up with Mr. Freeze taking on hits as a contractor. Once Roy finds out, things spin quickly out of control.The story plot is not much more complex than. It is a movie about a hit-man. Double crossings, mistrust and paranoia. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski,  made a name for himself in the '70's.Rated R for obvious reasons, the movie is filled with violent deaths, disassembled bodies and some bad language and nudity. The acting was outstanding. I felt that Shannon did an exceptional job. And I will state again, I did not recognize Ryder at all. She doesn't look old, but neither does she look like herself. Maybe it's just me. Schwimmer will always be Ross, even if he wears a ponytail. His drug sales are almost humorous in this film, because I couldn't help anticipating the arrival of Joey and Chandler.

1643242,A1BCHDAHJF0M4,B00C7BZY4C,Ryan,"[3, 4]","My review is a bit bias I must admit first and foremost.  I have watched the interviews with the real Richard Kuklinski multiple times.  I have a fascination with psychological conditions and a cold blooded killer is one that is worth exploring for my own personal interests.  To see what drives the person to do what they do is very intriguing to me.  Having watched the Kuklinski interviews I figured the movie would be a great way to see what he talks about in action rather than just using your imagination.The movie itself is quite good.  The only major problem I had with it was the fact that it would have been better off as a mini series or a multi part movie like ""Che.""  This would be able to separate the decades when Kuklinski was active far better than 105 minutes total.  However, I do feel this is the best adaptation of the life of Kuklinski during this time frame.  Its very difficult I would imagine as a director to compress that much data into the time frame allotted.  The problem you are running into is the same with the film adaptation of ""Akira.""  Six graphic novels reduced to approximately 2+ hours of film won't give you the complete experience.  The film does a good job of keeping track of the time until about half way through the flick where it suddenly stops listing what time frame you are in which can jar you a bit.  You have to decide based on the way Michael Shannon looks to determine the approximate time frame.The Good:-Excellent Casting.  Michael Shannon is pitch perfect as Kuklinski.  If they ever make another movie based on the ""Hitman"" game franchise they should get him to play Agent 47.  The supporting cast is quite good as well.  James Franco has the oddest part as he is only in it for a few minutes.  Chris Evans is fantastic.-The soundtrack fits well with the time and makes sense.-The weapons and methods Kukliski used are almost perfect save the fact that he would use cyanide in drinks and drop them on people rather than in spray bottle.-Very accurate cars and clothing really match the time frames in the movie.  Its very good to see no modern items in the scenes which definitely helps with the historical accuracy of the film.The Bad:-The blu-ray transfer has a filter on it that makes the blacks not appear as black as they should be and this is not due to contrast adjustments on my set.  This is basic quality control that wasn't quite up to par.-If you know the interviews then you know some of the facts are a bit different from what actually happened.-9/9 Update.  After watching the movie a second time its quite disturbing the writers didn't include much on his motivation. If you don't know his history, you have to speculate on why he is doing what he is doing.  They did make reference to some of his abusive past but not enough to even begin to explain how bad he had it and how his childhood affected his psychological make up.-The worst of it as I mentioned was the running time of the film.  There are a lot of kills that don't make sense because they are in a montage fashion.  You have no idea why he is killing certain folks and it can be really confusing.  You don't need to know every detail of why he is killing someone but a montage is not what I was looking for.  This also causes a problem because you don't feel sorry for any of the characters by the film's end.Conclusion:Its a good flick.  Don't get me wrong.

1643246,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00C7BZY4C,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 3]","This movie is not one I would generally watch, although sometimes I like to see a mafia-type film; ""Good Fellas"", ""The Departed"", ""The Godfather"", you get the idea.  These are not the usual 'go to' movies for me, but some of them are my favorites, it just depends on the mood.  Watching ""The Iceman"" scared me to death more than anything else, probably because the cast was excellent.  The acting of Michael Shannon was over-the-top and it was based on someone real. The movie itself is very dark, visually and also thematically. Just Frightening.Ariel Vromen wrote the part then directed a perfectly unfeeling Michael Shannon as ""The Iceman"", Richard Kuklinski. I was entirely enthralled with his flat-affect manner.  No visible emotion on his face, one couldn't tell what was going to necessarily happen.  He didn't seem to have any marketable skills for working, and didn't appear to care, he also lacked any social ability or prowess.  The one thing that Kuklinski could do with precision, is taking a life without batting an eye. He works as a vicious contract killer, nobody is off limits.  Kuklinski works for Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) who is a criminal himself and higher on the food-chain, calling all the shots for him.  The Iceman is involved in all types of felonious behavior (pornography, etc.) at first before Demeo has him prove himself loyal for his use. He then starts his horrific murderous lifestyle.When he begins dating his wife, Deborah Pellicotti (Wynona Ryder), it's curious to watch the sweetness involved in their romance, if this is what one would call it.  It is as if he is a completely different person with her.  Deborah is an all around good girl type, so unlike him.  The Catholic girl that will not be with a man before marriage.  In contrast, Kuklinski is a hardhearted killer, cold and calculating, but then entirely respectful and loving with his girlfriend then wife; this, of course, is according to the movie. She appears to remain oblivious to her husband's job and what he is up to.  The dichotomy of Kuklinski is altogether fascinating to view, it felt like I was watching two different people throughout the two decades this encompasses.  The surroundings change from the story's beginning in 1964.  The way people dress, what properties and housing looks like, the cars, right down to every detail has to move on with the times.  I enjoyed these changes and also was intrigued with the subsequent dramatic legalities.The movie is definitely not for everyone as it is extremely violent (I took a couple blanket dives) and to really enjoy this type of movie would be a personal subjective choice according to your ability to tolerate violence. As for myself, watching this movie was so frightening, then again, it was impossible to look away from. I was told there are documentaries made previous to this which include interviews with Kuklinski, if you are so inclined. Possibly seeing them as a complement to this movie could help explain the psychology involving such a protagonist.  That is what would interest me the most.  I don't understand what drives a person such as Richard Kuklinski; Why he did what he did.  Did he have any respect or thoughts about a human life in any regard?  I don't care whatsoever about him personally, I just want to know why.",4,"Michael Shannon As ""The Iceman""  Was Chilling To Watch.",1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3302,"['movie', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'generally', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'like', 'see', 'mafia-type', 'film', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Departed', 'Godfather', 'get', 'idea', 'are', 'not', 'usual', ""'go"", 'movies', 'are', 'favorites', 'just', 'mood', 'Watching', 'Iceman', 'scared', 'death', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'probably', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'was', 'based', 'someone', 'real', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'visually', 'also', 'thematically', 'Just', 'Frightening.Ariel', 'Vromen', 'wrote', 'part', 'then', 'directed', 'perfectly', 'unfeeling', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Iceman', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'was', 'entirely', 'enthralled', 'flat-affect', 'manner', 'visible', 'emotion', 'face', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'necessarily', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'marketable', 'skills', 'working', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'care', 'also', 'lacked', 'social', 'ability', 'prowess', 'one', 'thing', 'Kuklinski', 'could', 'do', 'precision', 'taking', 'life', 'batting', 'eye', 'vicious', 'contract', 'killer', 'nobody', 'limits', 'Kuklinski', 'Roy', 'Demeo', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'who', 'criminal', 'higher', 'food-chain', 'calling', 'shots', 'Iceman', 'involved', 'types', 'felonious', 'behavior', 'pornography', 'etc', 'first', 'Demeo', 'prove', 'loyal', 'use', 'then', 'horrific', 'murderous', 'lifestyle.When', 'dating', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Pellicotti', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'curious', 'watch', 'sweetness', 'involved', 'romance', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'Deborah', 'all', 'around', 'good', 'girl', 'type', 'so', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'man', 'marriage', 'contrast', 'Kuklinski', 'hardhearted', 'killer', 'cold', 'calculating', 'then', 'entirely', 'respectful', 'loving', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'wife', 'course', 'according', 'movie', 'remain', 'oblivious', 'husband', 'job', 'what', 'up', 'dichotomy', 'Kuklinski', 'altogether', 'fascinating', 'view', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'two', 'decades', 'surroundings', 'change', 'story', 'beginning', '1964', 'way', 'people', 'dress', 'what', 'properties', 'housing', 'looks', 'cars', 'right', 'down', 'detail', 'move', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'changes', 'also', 'was', 'intrigued', 'subsequent', 'dramatic', 'legalities.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'violent', 'took', 'couple', 'blanket', 'dives', 'really', 'enjoy', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'personal', 'subjective', 'choice', 'according', 'ability', 'tolerate', 'violence', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'frightening', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'impossible', 'look', 'away', 'was', 'told', 'are', 'documentaries', 'made', 'previous', 'include', 'interviews', 'Kuklinski', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'Possibly', 'seeing', 'complement', 'movie', 'could', 'help', 'explain', 'psychology', 'involving', 'such', 'protagonist', 'what', 'would', 'interest', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'person', 'such', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'Why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Did', 'have', 'respect', 'thoughts', 'human', 'life', 'regard', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'whatsoever', 'personally', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'why']",N/A

Richard starts out making copies of porno films for the mob when Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes his talent and turns him into a hitman. The story goes that his family didn't know anything about his hitman life, most likely made up by their attorney. It is said he killed over 100 men, although we only get the main hits. A montage of hits done to some good background music would have given us a better feel for his notoriety. One story is that Kuklinski killed Hoffa. The film avoids that controversy.The film is gritty, but doesn't offer the action of a fictional production. Richard lived a quiet life and didn't flaunt his wealth, a simple requirement for someone to be a long term hitman. By the end of the film, you start to sympathize with the Iceman.

1643251,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00C7BZY4C,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 0]","The trouble with biographical films is most people's lives make for unsatisfying stories. Such films usually feel incomplete. A story requires a beginning, middle, and end -- with the protagonist's story arc unified by some ""life lesson"" or theme. But real people's lives are not stories, but a series of disjointed and messy episodes.WithThe Doors, Oliver Stone tried to ""explain"" Jim Morrison's life by depicting it as Morrison's quest for death, sparked by his witnessing a car accident in his youth. It was an unsatisfactory explanation in a fascinating film.Director Ariel Vromen's THE ICEMAN likewise fails to find a unifying theme for contract killer Richard Kuklinski's life. What lesson is to be learned from this film? Who was the Kuklinski? Why did he become a cold-blooded killer? There's a brief flashback showing him beaten by his father, but most victims of child abuse do not go on to murder over 100 people, so it's an unsatisfying explanation. I guess the best explanation is that Kuklinski was a psychopath. Which is a label rather than a cinematic story arc.Ultimately, films like THE ICEMAN exist to satisfy the morbid curiosity of those wishing a safe peak at ""true crime."" It's also a painless way to get a brief history lesson, though filmmakers always alter the facts.THE ICEMAN is an artfully made film. The 1960s, 1970s period sets and clothes look accurate. It's well acted. Michael Shannon comes across as, well, icy. The other gangsters are well portrayed. Winona Ryder is sympathetic in a smallish role as Kuklinski's wife.I can't say I enjoyed THE ICEMAN, but it held my attention, the way a car accident might. Yet it left me emotionally unsatisfied, as biographical films often do. What was the point ofBasquiat's life? The film was an interesting peak into the 1980s New York art scene, but it meandered aimlessly, as does real life. As did Kuklinski's life, as did THE ICEMAN.If you like gritty, true-life crime films (e.g.The Valachi Papers,The French Connection,Serpico), you should like THE ICEMAN.",3,for the morbidly curious,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2037,"['trouble', 'biographical', 'films', 'most', 'people', 'lives', 'make', 'unsatisfying', 'stories', 'Such', 'films', 'usually', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'story', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'protagonist', 'story', 'arc', 'unified', 'life', 'lesson', 'theme', 'real', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'stories', 'series', 'disjointed', 'messy', 'episodes.WithThe', 'Doors', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'tried', 'explain', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'life', 'depicting', 'Morrison', 'quest', 'death', 'sparked', 'witnessing', 'car', 'accident', 'youth', 'was', 'unsatisfactory', 'explanation', 'fascinating', 'film.Director', 'Ariel', 'Vromen', 'THE', 'ICEMAN', 'likewise', 'find', 'unifying', 'theme', 'contract', 'killer', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'life', 'What', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'film', 'Who', 'was', 'Kuklinski', 'Why', 'did', 'become', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'brief', 'flashback', 'showing', 'beaten', 'father', 'most', 'victims', 'child', 'abuse', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'murder', '100', 'people', 'unsatisfying', 'explanation', 'guess', 'best', 'explanation', 'Kuklinski', 'was', 'psychopath', 'Which', 'label', 'rather', 'cinematic', 'story', 'arc.Ultimately', 'films', 'THE', 'ICEMAN', 'exist', 'satisfy', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'wishing', 'safe', 'peak', 'true', 'crime', 'also', 'painless', 'way', 'get', 'brief', 'history', 'lesson', 'filmmakers', 'always', 'alter', 'facts.THE', 'ICEMAN', 'artfully', 'made', 'film', '1960s', '1970s', 'period', 'sets', 'clothes', 'look', 'accurate', 'well', 'acted', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'well', 'icy', 'other', 'gangsters', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'sympathetic', 'smallish', 'role', 'Kuklinski', 'wife.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'ICEMAN', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'car', 'accident', 'might', 'Yet', 'left', 'emotionally', 'unsatisfied', 'biographical', 'films', 'often', 'do', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'ofBasquiat', 'life', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'peak', '1980s', 'New', 'York', 'art', 'scene', 'meandered', 'aimlessly', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'Kuklinski', 'life', 'did', 'THE', 'ICEMAN.If', 'gritty', 'true-life', 'crime', 'films', 'e.g.The', 'Valachi', 'Papers', 'French', 'Connection', 'Serpico', 'should', 'like', 'THE', 'ICEMAN']",N/A

1643253,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00C7BZY4C,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Between 1964 and 1986, Richard Kuklinski killed as many as 250 people for the mafia. His cold, callous style and willingness to do anything, earned him the nickname, The Iceman. In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1618,"['Between', '1964', '1986', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'killed', 'as', 'many', '250', 'people', 'mafia', 'cold', 'callous', 'style', 'willingness', 'do', 'anything', 'earned', 'nickname', 'Iceman', '1992', 'Iceman', 'granted', 'HBO', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'where', 'talked', 'life', 'described', 'crimes', 'way', 'someone', 'would', 'describe', 'job', 'film', 'dramatization', 'Kuklinski', 'story', 'based', 'entirely', 'what', 'said', 'interview', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'stars', 'Kuklinski', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'actors', 'even', 'ones', 'Shannon', 'seem', 'be', 'destine', 'play', 'certain', 'characters', 'how', 'make', 'name', 'Shannon', 'often', 'knocked', 'being', 'too', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'other', 'roles', 'was', 'essentially', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Iceman', 'Shannon', 'paired', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'annoy', 'hell', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'people', 'see', 'cast', 'film', 'rounded', 'out', 'terrific', 'cameos', 'likes', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'James', 'Franco', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'whom', 'are', 'terrific', 'add', 'mystique', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'confusing', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'times', 'slower', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'mafia', 'hit-man', 'be', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'names', 'jumps', 'scene', 'scene', 'time', 'time', 'so', 'quickly', 'little', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'Other', 'performances', 'are', 'terrific', 'amazing', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'film', 'simple', 'interview', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

He started life working as a technician in a porn production company. Then after he is seen to have nerves of steel is offered a career change of becoming a ruthless hit man; the pay is way better but the hours are a bit irregular.Meantime he has started a family with his doting wife; she is all apple pie and played with remarkable deftness by Winona Ryder. His family all claimed to have not had a clue about his real life choosing to believe his cover story that he worked in currency exchange. The mob boss who gets him in is Ray Liotta playing Roy Demeo. We also have a pony tailed David Schwimmer playing parasitical adopted son to Liotta with a penchant for bad sports clothes, nose candy and ostentatious use of hand guns.Once Kuklinski makes a mistake he has to go &#8216;independent&#8217; and teams up with Mr Freezy aka Robert Prongay (Chris Evans). He teaches him about poison and a whole range of interesting ways to &#8216;off&#8217; anyone they have to. He also introduces him to the freezer technique. Once a body has been frozen and defrosted it is impossible to work out forensically at what time death occurred. It helps if they are dismembered too apparently.This has excellent period detail with a brilliant if sparse sound track (&#8216;Blondie&#8217; and &#8216;E.L.O.&#8217; to name but two). The acting is excellent Michael Shannon cast as Kuklinski is mesmerising and has genuine on screen scary moments when he is dealing with Liotta. There is violence there is gore and there is profanity but that is essentially why we watch this type of film. It is one that will stay with you and maybe make you rethink the abilities of some of the actors here; really a ruddy brilliant piece of film making.",4,Great Performances in a very dark tale,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1908,"['be', 'real', 'story', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'who', 'was', 'reported', 'have', 'been', 'mob', '8217', 'most', 'prolific', 'hit', 'man', 'supposed', 'have', 'killed', '100', '250', 'persons', 'started', 'life', 'working', 'technician', 'porn', 'production', 'company', 'Then', 'seen', 'have', 'nerves', 'steel', 'offered', 'career', 'change', 'becoming', 'ruthless', 'hit', 'man', 'pay', 'way', 'better', 'hours', 'are', 'bit', 'irregular.Meantime', 'started', 'family', 'doting', 'wife', 'apple', 'pie', 'played', 'remarkable', 'deftness', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'family', 'claimed', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'clue', 'real', 'life', 'choosing', 'believe', 'cover', 'story', 'worked', 'currency', 'exchange', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'playing', 'Roy', 'Demeo', 'also', 'have', 'pony', 'tailed', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'playing', 'parasitical', 'adopted', 'son', 'Liotta', 'penchant', 'bad', 'sports', 'clothes', 'nose', 'candy', 'ostentatious', 'use', 'hand', 'guns.Once', 'Kuklinski', 'mistake', 'go', '8216', 'independent', '8217', 'teams', 'up', 'Mr', 'Freezy', 'aka', 'Robert', 'Prongay', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'poison', 'whole', 'range', 'interesting', 'ways', '8216', '8217', 'anyone', 'have', 'also', 'freezer', 'technique', 'Once', 'body', 'been', 'frozen', 'defrosted', 'impossible', 'work', 'out', 'forensically', 'what', 'time', 'death', 'occurred', 'are', 'dismembered', 'too', 'apparently.This', 'excellent', 'period', 'detail', 'brilliant', 'sparse', 'sound', 'track', '8216', 'Blondie', '8217', '8216', 'E.L.O.', '8217', 'name', 'two', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'cast', 'Kuklinski', 'mesmerising', 'genuine', 'screen', 'scary', 'moments', 'when', 'dealing', 'Liotta', 'violence', 'gore', 'profanity', 'essentially', 'why', 'watch', 'type', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'maybe', 'make', 'rethink', 'abilities', 'actors', 'here', 'really', 'ruddy', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'film', 'making']",N/A

He is a devoted husband and father who would do anything for him family. As far as his family knows he went from making Disney movies to currency exchange. He is a great provider and great person. The truth is something Richard hides from him family. He is one of the most notorious contract killer's in history and kills with no remorse or feeling toward his victim. He is the Iceman. I am a huge fan of mafia type movies. While this isn't really a mafia type movie it has the feel of a Goodfellas-esque movie. The movie is violent and shows killings but it's not really that graphic which helps the movie by not taking you out of the emotion by showing someones head explode. While I wouldn't call this a modern classic that should be watched over and over like Goodfellas or Scarface I do think that it very much worth watching and I did enjoy it.

He married and had two daughters, but he kept what he had been doing for a living a secret from his family members for more than twenty years.&#8220;The Iceman&#8221; begins strongly, depicting how Kuklinski was hired by a gangster Roy DeMeo (Liotta) as a contract killer. Up to the one-hour mark the film manages to grab your attention, portraying the man with convincing details. The impressive cast includes Winona Ryder (as Richard&#8217;s wife Deborah), Robert Davi, Stephen Dorff, Chris Evans, James Franco, Ray Liotta and David Schwimmer, and they all did great jobs.But after Kuklinski meets Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans), contract killer disguised as ice cream truck driver, the film loses its way, leaving some intriguing questions unanswered. (How rich was he? How did he get caught?)&#8220;The Iceman&#8221; is based on Anthony Bruno's book &#8220;The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer&#8221; and I know there are HBO documentaries featuring the interviews with Richard Kuklinski himself. I have not read or seen either of them. Perhaps I should have.The greatest asset of the film is, not surprisingly, Michael Shannon&#8217;s brilliant (and chilling) performance as the merciless contract killer. Another merit is the nice production values that recreate the tone and ambiance of the 1960s and 70s. &#8220;The Iceman&#8221; is deeply flawed, but is still worth watching for his acting.",3,See for Michael Shannon&#8217;s Great Acting,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1599,"['Ariel', 'Vromenand', '8217', 'crime', 'drama', '8220', 'Iceman', '8221', 'criminal', 'career', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'played', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'real-life', 'professional', 'killer', 'married', 'had', 'two', 'daughters', 'kept', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'living', 'secret', 'family', 'members', 'more', 'twenty', 'years.', '8220', 'Iceman', '8221', 'strongly', 'depicting', 'how', 'Kuklinski', 'was', 'hired', 'gangster', 'Roy', 'DeMeo', 'Liotta', 'contract', 'killer', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'film', 'manages', 'grab', 'attention', 'portraying', 'man', 'convincing', 'details', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Richard', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'James', 'Franco', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'did', 'great', 'jobs.But', 'Kuklinski', 'Robert', ""'Mr"", 'Freezy', 'Pronge', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'contract', 'killer', 'disguised', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'driver', 'film', 'way', 'leaving', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'How', 'rich', 'was', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'caught', '8220', 'Iceman', '8221', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Bruno', 'book', '8220', 'Iceman', 'True', 'Story', 'Cold-Blooded', 'Killer', '8221', 'know', 'are', 'HBO', 'documentaries', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'seen', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have.The', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Michael', 'Shannon', '8217', 's', 'brilliant', 'chilling', 'performance', 'merciless', 'contract', 'killer', 'merit', 'nice', 'production', 'values', 'recreate', 'tone', 'ambiance', '1960s', '70s', '8220', 'Iceman', '8221', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'acting']",N/A

1643259,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00C7BZY4C,Visual Bureau,"[0, 0]","""Whilst seen as too simplistic and bland for a crime drama, The Iceman, I thought, was a fine starter in this genre and the film had an excellent performance from the new-and-upcoming Michael Shannon playing Richard Kuklinski and another from Winona Ryder playing his not-knowing wife. The film left a very cold and unsettling impression especially knowing that his secrecy and his lack of control only made matters worse for him when he got with the mob and after an abusive childhood.Kuklinski, or known as Polack by the mob, was never really caring as he so claimed for his family and his actions dramatised on screen are shocking, sustained, and ultimately unsuccessful when people turned against him. There are so many scenes in the film that are equally gripping, disturbingly violent, and surprising to watch especially when his brother played by Stephen Dorff is in prison and calls out on Richard that he shouldn't make the same mistake. Much of his violent, impulsive temper translates to many scenes that involve him destroying property in his house, killing his enemies when present, and driving with anger against a car he crashed in due to being distracted. His actions almost show that there is no escape and the cinematography, performances (including a surprise cameo from James Franco), and televisual editing remind you of a 90s film complements it.While a tough watch by all means (definitely not suitable for a BBFC 15 certificate) and an ambiguous ending, The Iceman is one of the most well-performed crime dramas you'll see this year and its acknowledgment from Toronto and Venice film festivals are supportive of that. While never on my radar but under recommendation from some friends, I'm glad I've seen it.""",4,"Intense crime drama has excellent performances and a chilling aura full of lies, violence, and social complexity.

1643261,A3M17XG8HL7JRF,B00C7BZY4C,"Who Am I? ""Me!""","[0, 0]","In real life Kuklinski beat his wife all the time and his children and wife hated him, but I enjoyed this film and it has some good performances.  I would've given it 4 stars if it wasn't for the note that comes up after the film is done which I will explain later.The film makes you feel some empathy for the Iceman who is portrayed as a saint when it comes to his family- but the truth is very different.  In reality, he often beat his wife so badly that she suffered miscarriages and broken bones.  His wife tried breaking up with him when they were just dating, but he cut her in the back of the neck with a hunting knife and threatened to kill her if she dared leave him... and that's why she ended up marrying him.  Not out of love, but out of fear.  His daughters hated him so much that at least one of them plotted to poison him by putting something in his food.  The only people who wanted this man dead more than the mafia bosses was his own family.  In an interview his former wife said: ""I will regret for the rest of my life,"" she said, ""that I didn't just tell him the bastard he is and how much I hate him. I wish the last words he'd heard had been how much I hated his guts.""  Some loving family man, huh?  But none of this really bothers me because these based on true story films are often full of misrepresentations and making the lead character someone to empathize with makes the experience more engaging for the viewer.  As long as you keep these expectations you can enjoy these types of films as simply good movies without holding them up to any standard of truth.But here is the thing that I do think is a big deal.  After the movie ends the director flashes a note on screen stating that Kuklinski never saw his family again.  This is a flat out lie.  Kuklinski's wife continued to visit him in jail for almost a decade after his incarceration.  According to her out of fear for her children since she thought that despite him being imprisoned he could still have someone on the outside cause harm to her.  And she secretly recorded (with the help of a film production office) many of the phone conversations between he and she after he had gone to prison where he threatens her.  When he was dying his wife took one of their daughters to visit him in the prison hospital also.  I can excuse the director attempting to make the audience feel sorry for the lead CHARACTER, but I cannot excuse the director's blatant attempt to make the audience feel sorry for the REAL man, by printing the lie that he never saw his family again at the end of the film.  Creating false scenes in a movie to make a good story are one thing, but the statements written at the end of a film are definitely meant to make the viewer believe something that occurred in reality.  The statement that flashes across the screen stating that he never saw his family again was a flat out deception and I do not support it.  If you ever meet director Ariel Vromen, don't take him at his word for anything.For a final note I have cut and pasted the following from an article on the final hours of the iceman.""as Richard Kuklinski's life finally slipped away, he became conscious long enough to ask doctors to make sure they revived him if he flatlined. But before she left, Barbara had signed a ""do not resuscitate"" order. A week before his death, in the early hours of March 5 2006, the hospital called Barbara to ask if she wished to rescind the instruction.
