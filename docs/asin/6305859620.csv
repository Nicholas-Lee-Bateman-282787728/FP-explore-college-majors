481223,A3GU5PNTT7DRIY,6305859620,C.R. Hurst,"[7, 7]","With the bewildering number of walking DVDs offered, the task to choose one that will suit our needs can be daunting. For this reason I offer the following comparison of two popular walking fitness DVDs designed specifically for the over 50 set, Jane Fonda's Prime Time Walkout and Leslie Sansone's Older Adults Walk and Firm. I find that both present superior low impact exercise routines and advice for seniors, but the format, content, and style of each DVD are quite different.Jane Fonda's Walkout is one of her five Prime Time exercise DVDs geared to older adults. Walkout provides two low impact routines. Level one is a mile long, and with the warm-up and cooldown included lasts roughly 25 minutes; level two also includes a mile long routine with warm-up and cooldown but is slightly more challenging. Each level uses standard walk aerobic moves like ""side-to-side"", ""kick-backs"" (or ""kick-butts"" as Fonda likes to call them), and ""knee-lifts"" in conjunction with various arm movements to give a moderate cardio challenge. Jane also incorporates some beginning dance aerobic moves such as ""grapevine"" and ""the mambo"" that are easy to follow, even for those with two left feet, like me. I especially like the fact that Jane conducts the routines alone. With her calm voice and self-deprecating humor Jane offers helpful instruction throughout. Also included in the DVD is a bonus Kegel exercise segment for those ladies who suffer from incontinence.Leslie Sansone's DVD, Older Adults Walk and Firm, is one of many walk-aerobic routines that Sansone offers. This particular DVD combines an easy walking routine with strength building exercises. Unlike the Fonda DVD only one roughly 30 minute routine is provided, and I find it much more suited to a beginner in walk-aerobics, or perhaps the more fragile senior looking for gentle all-around exercise. The maneuvers in Leslie's solo routine are straightforward walking steps and arm movements, conducted with a recommended one or two pound weights--and alternated with strength and firming moves for a light interval training approach. And although I prefer Fonda's style to Sansone's, Leslie's instruction is more precise and easier to follow, and her bubbly personality may be better suited to those who need more upbeat encouragement.All in all, both Jane Fonda's Walkout and Leslie Sansone's Older Adult Walk and Firm provide healthy and supportive exercise instruction for those over 50. We are indeed fortunate that two such inspiring women have devoted much of their lives to creating fitness programs for all our ages.",5,For All Our Ages,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,2583,"['bewildering', 'number', 'walking', 'DVDs', 'offered', 'task', 'choose', 'one', 'will', 'suit', 'needs', 'can', 'be', 'daunting', 'reason', 'offer', 'following', 'comparison', 'two', 'popular', 'walking', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'designed', 'specifically', 'over', '50', 'set', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Walkout', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Older', 'Adults', 'Walk', 'Firm', 'find', 'present', 'superior', 'low', 'impact', 'exercise', 'routines', 'advice', 'seniors', 'format', 'content', 'style', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'different.Jane', 'Fonda', 'Walkout', 'one', 'five', 'Prime', 'Time', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'geared', 'older', 'adults', 'Walkout', 'two', 'low', 'impact', 'routines', 'Level', 'one', 'mile', 'long', 'warm-up', 'cooldown', 'included', 'roughly', '25', 'minutes', 'level', 'two', 'also', 'mile', 'long', 'routine', 'warm-up', 'cooldown', 'slightly', 'more', 'challenging', 'level', 'standard', 'walk', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'side-to-side', 'kick-backs', 'kick-butts', 'Fonda', 'call', 'knee-lifts', 'conjunction', 'various', 'arm', 'movements', 'give', 'moderate', 'cardio', 'challenge', 'Jane', 'also', 'beginning', 'dance', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'such', 'grapevine', 'mambo', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'even', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'especially', 'fact', 'Jane', 'routines', 'alone', 'calm', 'voice', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'Jane', 'helpful', 'instruction', 'Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'Kegel', 'exercise', 'segment', 'ladies', 'who', 'suffer', 'incontinence.Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVD', 'Older', 'Adults', 'Walk', 'Firm', 'one', 'many', 'walk-aerobic', 'routines', 'Sansone', 'particular', 'DVD', 'combines', 'easy', 'walking', 'routine', 'strength', 'building', 'exercises', 'Fonda', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'roughly', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'provided', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'suited', 'beginner', 'walk-aerobics', 'perhaps', 'more', 'fragile', 'senior', 'looking', 'gentle', 'all-around', 'exercise', 'maneuvers', 'Leslie', 'solo', 'routine', 'are', 'straightforward', 'walking', 'steps', 'arm', 'movements', 'conducted', 'recommended', 'one', 'two', 'pound', 'weights', 'alternated', 'strength', 'firming', 'moves', 'light', 'interval', 'training', 'approach', 'prefer', 'Fonda', 'style', 'Sansone', 'Leslie', 'instruction', 'more', 'precise', 'easier', 'follow', 'bubbly', 'personality', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'who', 'need', 'more', 'upbeat', 'encouragement.All', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Walkout', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Older', 'Adult', 'Walk', 'Firm', 'provide', 'healthy', 'supportive', 'exercise', 'instruction', '50', 'are', 'indeed', 'fortunate', 'two', 'such', 'inspiring', 'women', 'have', 'devoted', 'much', 'lives', 'creating', 'fitness', 'programs', 'ages']",Leslie Sansone's Walk and Firm for Older Adults VHS
481224,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,6305859620,drebbles,"[84, 87]","""Older Adults Walk and Firm"" is a combination of walking and exercising with weights. The walking comes first and has the usual Leslie Sansone walking moves - walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks. The video is approximately 30 minutes long, has about 8 minutes of warm-ups, 15 minutes of exercising with the weights and about 7 minutes of cool down. All of this is nice and gentle and nothing is too hard to do.I really enjoy exercising to ""Older Adults Walk and Firm"". The video is just Leslie, no one else walking and exercising with her. It is a bit slower paced than some of Leslie's other exercise videos, but that's fine because it works perfectly for older adults especially those that have never exercised before. Leslie talks you through the exercises and anything new - like squats and lunges - she introduces slowly. The warm-ups are just the right length. The weight section is very nicely paced. It combines the usual walking exercises (walking in place, walking up and down, side steps, knee lifts and kicks) with exercises such as squats, bicep curls, lifting the weights over your head, and lunges. Leslie guides you through all these exercises and they are done nice and slowly but are still effective. While none of the exercises felt too strenuous while I was doing them, at the end I felt like I got a good workout.A word of warning - make sure you watch the introduction before you start exercising. In the introduction, Leslie explains how the program works and what kind of weights to use - gloved weights or dumbbells weighing up to two pounds. Also, I love Leslie's exercise programs, but she has a tendency to talk too much and sometimes interrupts the flow of exercising while talking and she gestures a lot which can be confusing.All in all, I really enjoy ""Older Adults Walk and Firm"".",5,Good Exercise DVD for Older Adults,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,1829,"['Older', 'Adults', 'Walk', 'Firm', 'combination', 'walking', 'exercising', 'weights', 'walking', 'first', 'usual', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'moves', 'walking', 'place', 'side', 'steps', 'knee', 'lifts', 'kicks', 'video', 'approximately', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'about', '8', 'minutes', 'warm-ups', '15', 'minutes', 'exercising', 'weights', '7', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'nice', 'gentle', 'nothing', 'too', 'hard', 'do.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'exercising', 'Older', 'Adults', 'Walk', 'Firm', 'video', 'just', 'Leslie', 'one', 'else', 'walking', 'exercising', 'bit', 'slower', 'paced', 'Leslie', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos', 'fine', 'perfectly', 'older', 'adults', 'especially', 'have', 'never', 'exercised', 'before', 'Leslie', 'talks', 'exercises', 'anything', 'new', 'squats', 'slowly', 'warm-ups', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'length', 'weight', 'section', 'very', 'nicely', 'paced', 'usual', 'walking', 'exercises', 'walking', 'place', 'walking', 'up', 'down', 'side', 'steps', 'knee', 'lifts', 'kicks', 'exercises', 'such', 'squats', 'bicep', 'curls', 'lifting', 'weights', 'head', 'lunges', 'Leslie', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'nice', 'slowly', 'are', 'still', 'effective', 'none', 'exercises', 'felt', 'too', 'strenuous', 'was', 'doing', 'end', 'felt', 'got', 'good', 'workout.A', 'word', 'warning', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'introduction', 'start', 'exercising', 'introduction', 'Leslie', 'how', 'program', 'works', 'what', 'kind', 'weights', 'use', 'gloved', 'weights', 'dumbbells', 'weighing', 'up', 'two', 'pounds', 'Also', 'love', 'Leslie', 'exercise', 'programs', 'tendency', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'sometimes', 'interrupts', 'flow', 'exercising', 'talking', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'confusing.All', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Older', 'Adults', 'Walk', 'Firm']",Leslie Sansone's Walk and Firm for Older Adults VHS

It's the first exercise DVD of any kind that I've been able to do all the way through, but I was sweating and huffing and puffing after the 35-40 minutes that it takes. That's the point, though, so that's good. It includes light aerobics, strength training and stretching, and it works all major muscle groups, so it's quite well-rounded. You'll need 1- or 2-lb dumbbells or another kind of hand weights (you can use soup cans at first, but the weights cost less than $10 at discount stores).Thankfully, it's only Leslie, not a bunch of other people to distract you and make it too ""busy."" Yes, she talks too much, but it would be strange for her to not to talk, too. Just turn the sound down or off after you've been through it a couple of times and know what to expect. The music isn't awful, but like all of these things, isn't good either, and you won't really need it to cue the tempo (I did appreciate the jazz toward the end, though).It's not perfect, but it's the best place to start for some of us.

Second, she speaks in a condescending, patronizing manner as though she is talking to little children. I don't see that in her other videos, so I guess she is just a typical younger adult who thinks older adults are &#34;cute&#34; and need to be talked down to. Third, she tells you that if you don't have energy you're not attractive. What a cruel thing to say to older adults, who are obviously seeing their energy decline as they age. You can slow it but you can't stop it. It is a normal part of aging.I recommend Jane Fonda's recent videos. I especially like Walk Out, which has a beginner level and a faster level. Jane is actually an older adult (in her 70's now, I believe). She is encouraging, not condescending. She shares how she has adjusted her routine now that she has had joint replacements and how she moves more slowly and carefully in stretching now to avoid injury.
