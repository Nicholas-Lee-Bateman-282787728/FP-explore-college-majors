151301,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0792844696,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[44, 47]","Leonard Maltin, who usually agrees with me (!), gives this movie only 2 1/2 stars.  The Amazon reviewer says it doesn't make much sense and is full of McGuffins!  Well, they're both way off base this time.  McGuffins?  Try  to come up with even one good one, and you'll have something that most  thrillers don't have at all.  Come up with several, as does MALICE, and you  have a totally brilliant thriller.  Yes, the serial killer subplot was  thrown in--for laughs, maybe?  No matter, it served its purpose of  deflection, setting up the main character, and even -- horror of horrors!  -- filling time while time needs to be passing by in order for the main  plot to mature.  The movie was touted as being from the same director who  brought us SEA OF LOVE, which to my mind is an immediate turn-off.  But it  shows--as William Goldman shows so clearly in his books--that the same  director can be quite different depending on the screenplay.  MALICE has a  great screenplay, so all the director had to do was film it.  Of course, I  exaggerate, but wait a moment--look who he had to work with: Nicole Kidman,  Alec Baldwin, and Bill Pullman.  Each turned in a totally outstanding,  memorable performance.  Pullman had the hardest role and he pulled it off.  Kidman is one of the greatest actresses of our generation.  Baldwin was  good as usual, and we especially have to thank the casting director for  choosing him for this role, which seems to be &quot;pure Baldwin,&quot; if  you know what I mean (e.g., most Bogart movies are &quot;pure Bogart,&quot;  as if there were no one else who could possibly play that role, including  George Raft as Rick in CASABLANCA).  And even Peter Gallagher shows up here  in an early role that makes a strong impression.  George C. Scott is  perfect, as always, in a cameo role.  Nicole Kidman does not seem to be all  that impressive through most of the movie, but she's playing a role, and  playing it to the hilt, as we find out later.  She gets her chance to show  what she can do in the last fifteen minutes, and you can see her incredible  range, her ability to focus the film, the depth of her resources as an  actress, which she exceeds only in her bravura role in TO DIE FOR.  All in  all, MALICE is one of the finest thrillers of the 90s, and my prediction is  that it will become a major cult favorite and be reissued sooner or later  on DVD.",4,Totally Underrated: A Brilliant Movie,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,2393,"['Leonard', 'Maltin', 'who', 'usually', 'movie', 'only', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'full', 'McGuffins', 'Well', ""'re"", 'way', 'base', 'time', 'McGuffins', 'Try', 'come', 'up', 'even', 'one', 'good', 'one', ""'ll"", 'have', 'something', 'most', 'thrillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Come', 'up', 'several', 'MALICE', 'have', 'totally', 'brilliant', 'thriller', 'Yes', 'serial', 'killer', 'subplot', 'was', 'thrown', 'laughs', 'maybe', 'No', 'matter', 'served', 'purpose', 'deflection', 'setting', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'even', 'horror', 'horrors', 'filling', 'time', 'time', 'needs', 'be', 'passing', 'order', 'main', 'plot', 'mature', 'movie', 'was', 'touted', 'being', 'same', 'director', 'who', 'brought', 'SEA', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'mind', 'immediate', 'turn-off', 'William', 'Goldman', 'so', 'clearly', 'books', 'same', 'director', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'different', 'depending', 'screenplay', 'MALICE', 'great', 'screenplay', 'director', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'film', 'course', 'exaggerate', 'wait', 'moment', 'look', 'who', 'had', 'work', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'turned', 'totally', 'outstanding', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Pullman', 'had', 'hardest', 'role', 'pulled', 'off', 'Kidman', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'generation', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'good', 'usual', 'especially', 'have', 'thank', 'casting', 'director', 'choosing', 'role', 'be', 'quot', 'pure', 'Baldwin', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'e.g.', 'most', 'Bogart', 'movies', 'are', 'quot', 'pure', 'Bogart', 'quot', 'were', 'one', 'else', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'play', 'role', 'including', 'George', 'Raft', 'Rick', 'CASABLANCA', 'even', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'up', 'here', 'early', 'role', 'strong', 'impression', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'perfect', 'always', 'cameo', 'role', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'impressive', 'most', 'movie', 'playing', 'role', 'playing', 'hilt', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'can', 'see', 'incredible', 'range', 'ability', 'focus', 'film', 'depth', 'resources', 'actress', 'only', 'bravura', 'role', 'TO', 'DIE', 'FOR', 'MALICE', 'one', 'finest', 'thrillers', '90s', 'prediction', 'will', 'become', 'major', 'cult', 'favorite', 'be', 'reissued', 'sooner', 'later', 'DVD']",N/A

I actually think I watched Siskel and Ebert do their original review with mixed reactions. And that's understandable. This movie can be confusing. I understand it more with each viewing. Some may say they pack too much in this movie for it to be comprehensible. That too isn't unfair. But this movie falls into the ""the more you watch it"" category- you definitely realize more with each viewing. That's not how a movie should be I realize. But in some of my favorites it is. I've gone from 50/50 on this movie initially, to an 8 or 9 out of 10 scale. I think Baldwin is at his best as is Kidman. Bebe Neuwirth isn't utilized so much, and this surely isn't the fetching Bebe that I adore so much either. And there are some spectacular small performances by Peter Ghallager (Hollywood's perpetual attorney), George C. Scott, Anne Bancroft and Tobin Bell. A pretty loaded cast along with Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin. Though the most shining moments are from Baldwin and Kidman, playing the passionate conspirators, Bancroft makes the most of about a 10 minute scene that not only explains a lot, but is reminiscent of Geraldine Page's scene stealer in ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"". The ending was satisfying in many ways also. I tell you, I know this isn't time capsule celluloid, but I like this movie a lot. It entertained me, made me think, kept me guessing, and gave me an acceptable pay-off.

151308,ACBFF25XJC2T7,0792844696,Choice Critic,"[1, 3]","This movie is a bland pastiche of the mystery genre and not much more.  The fact that is a genre movie does not necessarily mean that the movie is trite or bad.  The test of a genre movie is not its formula but how well the formula is executed.  That depends on the writing, acting, and directing.  This movie falls short on all counts, most especially the writing and plot development, which generate the poor acting performances.""Malice"" provides an underwhelming turn by Nicole Kidman as a far less brilliant schemer than portrayed by Kathleen Turner in ""Body Heat"". A weeny performance by Bill Pullman (Nicole's husband, Andy) greatly diminishes the movie's possibilities.  Alec Baldwin plays a masterful surgeon with a ""God Complex.""  OK.  But he plays it like a psycho rather than a sociopath.  All combine to make the viewer think, ""I've seen all of this done better before.""  And you have.  The poor writing and plot development contribute greatly to the poor performances.The movie opens with a rape of a young college student by a serial killer who has botched the job and an emergency room scene establishing that Alec Baldwin, as Dr. Jed Hill, is brilliant.  He saves the young woman's life with a creative and risky medical move.  No one knows why he is working at the local hospital since he is much too sophisticated to be there.  It is needed, though, as an essential part of the plot.  Nicole Kidman is an elementary education teacher at the local school.  Husband Andy is an administrator at the local college who, as soon as he meets Baldwin immediately develops a man-crush for him. They attended high school together and Andy seems to never have gotten over the experience.Pullman's characterization as a self-described ""mild-mannered"" man is outstandingly bad.  He manages to make himself, as a victim, more contemptuous than empathetic.  His mild-mannered performance comes off as more wimpy than mild.  Toward the end of the movie the viewer is presented with a histrionic, unintentionally funny, fall from a twenty foot high balcony stairway ala ""The War of the Roses"".  They then get up as though they had just walked down the stairs.  All limbs unbruised or broken.  The scene has Kidman manhandling Andy which by this time in the movie is credible since Andy has shown himself to be such a week-kneed naif.The action takes place in the Boston area. Only Bebe Neuwirth, as a detective trying to solve the serial killings, and Anne Bancroft, as Nicole's alcoholic mother, bother to adopt a Boston accent.  Everyone else sounds like they are imports from the Midwest. The one innovation in the movie is using serial killing as a peculiarly poor red herring subplot rather than as the main topic of the movie. Not a great idea.  Amusingly, there is a serial killer loose on a college campus and Bebe Neuwirth complains that she doesn't have enough manpower.  No credible explanation is given or even attempted to explain why no other police departments or state authorities are called in to help find the killer.One interesting sidebar is the appearance of Gwyneth Paltrow.  At the age of twenty-one she apprentices in this movie as student fodder for the serial killer. She gives a brief but credible performance. Little did we know back in 1993 what a huge star she would become. I am not saying to pass on this movie.  Just don't expect much merely because Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin are doing star turns.",2,Run of the Mill,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3436,"['movie', 'bland', 'pastiche', 'mystery', 'genre', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'fact', 'genre', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'movie', 'trite', 'bad', 'test', 'genre', 'movie', 'not', 'formula', 'how', 'well', 'formula', 'executed', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'movie', 'short', 'counts', 'most', 'especially', 'writing', 'plot', 'development', 'generate', 'poor', 'acting', 'performances', 'Malice', 'underwhelming', 'turn', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'far', 'less', 'brilliant', 'schemer', 'portrayed', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Body', 'Heat', 'weeny', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Nicole', 'husband', 'Andy', 'greatly', 'movie', 'possibilities', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'masterful', 'surgeon', 'God', 'Complex', 'OK', 'psycho', 'rather', 'sociopath', 'combine', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'have', 'poor', 'writing', 'plot', 'development', 'contribute', 'greatly', 'poor', 'performances.The', 'movie', 'rape', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'botched', 'job', 'emergency', 'room', 'scene', 'establishing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Dr.', 'Jed', 'Hill', 'brilliant', 'young', 'woman', 'life', 'creative', 'risky', 'medical', 'move', 'one', 'why', 'working', 'local', 'hospital', 'much', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'be', 'there', 'needed', 'though', 'essential', 'part', 'plot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'elementary', 'education', 'teacher', 'local', 'school', 'Husband', 'Andy', 'administrator', 'local', 'college', 'who', 'as', 'soon', 'Baldwin', 'immediately', 'man-crush', 'attended', 'high', 'school', 'together', 'Andy', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'over', 'experience.Pullman', 'characterization', 'self-described', 'mild-mannered', 'man', 'outstandingly', 'bad', 'make', 'victim', 'more', 'contemptuous', 'empathetic', 'mild-mannered', 'performance', 'off', 'more', 'wimpy', 'mild', 'end', 'movie', 'viewer', 'presented', 'histrionic', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'fall', 'twenty', 'foot', 'high', 'balcony', 'stairway', 'War', 'Roses', 'then', 'get', 'up', 'had', 'just', 'walked', 'down', 'stairs', 'limbs', 'unbruised', 'broken', 'scene', 'Kidman', 'manhandling', 'Andy', 'time', 'movie', 'credible', 'Andy', 'shown', 'be', 'such', 'week-kneed', 'naif.The', 'action', 'place', 'Boston', 'area', 'Only', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'detective', 'trying', 'solve', 'serial', 'killings', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Nicole', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'bother', 'adopt', 'Boston', 'accent', 'Everyone', 'else', 'are', 'imports', 'Midwest', 'one', 'innovation', 'movie', 'using', 'serial', 'killing', 'peculiarly', 'poor', 'red', 'herring', 'subplot', 'rather', 'main', 'topic', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'idea', 'Amusingly', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'college', 'campus', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'manpower', 'credible', 'explanation', 'given', 'even', 'attempted', 'explain', 'why', 'other', 'police', 'departments', 'state', 'authorities', 'are', 'called', 'help', 'find', 'killer.One', 'interesting', 'sidebar', 'appearance', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'age', 'twenty-one', 'movie', 'student', 'fodder', 'serial', 'killer', 'brief', 'credible', 'performance', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'back', '1993', 'what', 'huge', 'star', 'would', 'become', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'pass', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'merely', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'are', 'doing', 'star', 'turns']",N/A

151310,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792844696,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 8]","Take a surgeon with a God complex, a perfect young wife who loves kids, add a sincere doofus of a husband and you will have Malice, an intricate insurance-murder mystery that leaves a satisfyingly full-bodied, nasty taste in your mouth.Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a decent, sincere dean at a picture-perfect small college in a picture-perfect New England town. His wife, Tracy (Nicole Kidman), volunteers at a children's center five days a week. They've just bought an old, rundown Victorian house they plan to remodel and fill with kids of their own. In to town comes Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), the hospital's new surgeon and a hot shot cutter. Andy and Jed meet the same day and Jed winds up renting Andy's and Tracy's third floor room. Jed needs a place to stay temporarily and Andy and Tracy can use the extra income for remodeling expenses.And then Tracy starts to have abdominal pains. One night she's rushed to the hospital, where Jed operates after getting Andy's permission. Jed removes an ovary he says was cancerous. It turns out Tracy had been pregnant and the ovary was healthy. A medical hearing is held. The result is that Tracy is awarded $20 million, but she is so angry with Andy that she leaves him. Ah, but there's more. To say what would ruin a good mystery. Let's just say that there are a lot of twists and that things very often aren't what they seem. There is some really unpleasant manipulation going on, plus a degree of sexual ruthlessness that would make a fine entry into Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis.The most serious drawback to the movie is a major red herring involving a serial criminal that goes nowhere. The purpose seems only to give Andy a reason to spend the last half of the movie with a seriously bruised face. There also is a semi-red herring involving a doctor in another town that, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out. I think it was most likely a plot point that became a loose string the director figured the audience would forget about.The movie features fine performances by all. Pullman's decent guy persona drives the second half of the movie. Two one-off cameos by George C. Scott as a respected surgeon and Anne Bancroft as...well, you'll need to see the movie...are both important to the plot. Bebe Neuwirth as police detective Dana Harris, a friend of Andy's, nearly steals every scene she's in. She uses an accent that reminds me of Maerose Prizzi, but even so she radiates no-nonsense common sense and a real concern for Andy. Nicole Kidman is what the movie is all about. She gives a performance that is subtle and forceful. Amazingly, 16 years after she made this movie her forehead still has no trace of a wrinkle. Alec Baldwin has spent the latter half of his movie career specializing in unlikable egoists. Here he's interesting and at least a little likable. And does his character, Dr. Jed Hill, really have a God complex? Here's what Dr. Hill has to say for himself: ""I have an M.D. from Harvard. I am board certified in cardio-thoratic medicine and trauma surgery. I have been awarded citations from seven different medical boards in New England, and I am never, ever sick at sea. So I ask you: When someone goes into that chapel and they fall on their knees and they pray to God that their wife doesn't miscarry or that their daughter doesn't bleed to death or that their mother doesn't suffer acute neural trauma from post-operative shock, who do you think they're praying to? Now, go ahead and read your Bible, and you go to your church...and, with any luck, you might win the annual raffle. But if you're looking for God, he was in operating room number two on November 17, and he doesn't like to be second guessed. You ask me if I have a God complex.

With Alec Baldwin moving in with married couple played by Nicole Kidman and Bill Pullman, Alec brings this eerie confidence to his charactor, someone you can never trust, but for some reason you want to.  Nicole plays her charactor so well that you believe everthing she says and thats important to the story because you believe her even when you shouldn't...she's perfect here.  Bill Pullman lacks a bit, but he's not your best actor anyway.  Anne Bancroft is great as Nicole Kidmans alcoholic mother.  The film starts off being a 'who is this man living upstairs' type film to a 'could he be raping and murdering my students' type movie to a 'why is everyone screwing me over' type movie and whats great is that it keeps you guessing by addressing different situations that lead your attention away from the big surprise in the end.

Neal,"[2, 3]","Without warning you Spoiler Alert! at least two of the reviewing geniuses below reveal major plot twists, one in disagreeing with Ebert's accurate line about the serial killer subplot. Reading those reviews ruins some of the fun in this delicious flick, a magnet for me whenever I catch it on TV. The plot is summarized above so there's no need for me to do it here. This is one of those movies, like Wild Things, where the less you know about the plot going in, the better.Great movie? No. Fun movie with some stunning, clap-in-surprise moments? Oh, mama, yes.I'm going to bet the folks who made To Die For went after Nicole Kidman after seeing Malice. The comic talent needed for To Die For isn't seen here, but she establishes pretty clearly the icy (rhymes with ""kitsch"") persona she would carry through that movie and the rest of her best performances.Overall, this movie is well-shot and very well cast. The moment you see each character, you have a strong conception of the role they'll play in this multilayered plot -- or, rather, the role the filmmakers want you to think they'll play. Some of it is acting, but much of it is the weight of the actors and actresses previous performances. This was back when Peter Gallagher always played scheming cads, Alec Baldwin played the chick magnet, George C. Scott was the voice of wisdom and Nicole Kidman...well, if you aren't thinking (rhymes with ""glitch"") by her second or third scene, you probably really believe the check is in the mail.The movie is a worthy buy. No Best Picture contender and if it's on your list of Top 10 Favorite Films, please leave the room. But as a fine slice of entertainment, I'll take it.

Hands down, the acting is superb. Nicole Kidman is wonderful as is Bill Pullman but the leader? Alec Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin here has given his best performance, one that shocked me and one that was really ahead of its time. His lines are perfectly spoken, his facial expressions wonderfully shown, everything he does is litterally perfect.I have to disagree with Roger Ebert though on this one. The serial killer part adds to the movie. For one, like another reviewer said, it is key to the plot, involving Pullman as a suspect and his sperm results. But, really to me, it made the movie even more original and even more fun to watch.The movie is about the ""happy couple"", played by Bill Pullman and Nicole Kidman. They are livng the life. Enter Jed (Alec Baldwin), an amazing, hot shot physician. He moves in with the couple, a roomate. While the psychiatrist played by Bill Pullman is pondering over a mysterious serial killer, his wife has problem with her ovaries. Jed has to act. He makes a wrong choice and now she can never have children. What follows is seriously unbelievable. This is one of the most remarquable thrillers out there carried by a wonderful cast and it has some of the best lines in cinematic history. The ""I am God"" part is brilliant, one of the best lines ever, but really all of these lines are unbelievable. The whole, ""it's my mother's hair"" thing is so creepy and I was screaming: ""get out! It's him!""Malice is one of the best movie out there and is worth an addition to any serious collection.I will add one more thing. The cruel irony at the end is masterful and shows that the script for this movie was obviously written by a very intelectual person.

Bill Pullman was cast perfectly for his role as loving husband.  Ann Bancroft and George C. Scott gave sterling performances in key roles.

I was much to busy being entertained by the maliciously delicious manner the paths of the story took from scene to intriguing scene.Watching older films on DVD I have discovered that most of all I enjoy those that are a 'pleasure' to watch, those they provide entertainment and enjoyment.

151323,ASR84M1GD9X89,0792844696,Kimberly Murphy-Smith,"[35, 35]","MALICE is one of those movies that you simply MUST see more than once to believe. The first time through, MALICE is a great psychological thriller, with twists and turns through a plot that contains rape, murder, life-and-death trauma, and a fight to the death...all within the first 45 minutes. The second time through, though, provides a look at all the things you might have missed the first time around...and a chance to savor an outstanding performance from perhaps the most underrated actor in Hollywood, Alec Baldwin.Bill Pullman plays Andy Safian, an associate dean at a small New England college outside of Boston that's currently under siege by a serial rapist who claims his latest victim as the film opens. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Tracy, a volunteer in the pediatrics ward of St. Agnes Hospital. They're renovating a Victorian house and need $14,000 for the plumbing. Enter Alec Baldwin as Dr. Jed Hill, a former high school classmate of Andy's, who's brand new in town and needs a place to stay. Andy needs the money, Jed needs a room, so the two hook up and soon Jed is sleeping upstairs in the Safiens' home...usually not alone, and his sexual escapades are grating on Tracy's nerves. The rapes continue, Andy is fingered as a suspect, and in the midst of it all, Tracy collapses with a ruptured ovarian cyst. Jed operates to save her life (after a night of drinking and wild partying), but renders her unable to bear children...leading to a malpractice suit from Tracy and an incredible soliloquy on surgeons with a God complex from Jed during the deposition.But once the first half of the film is over, things really start to roll. Without revealing the rest of the plot, suffice it to say that as Andy, Tracy, and Jed all try to start their lives over again, their fates become inextricably entangled.The movie is worth seeing once as a thriller. But the second time around, Baldwin's mesmerizing performance is what stands out. Jed is charismatic, seductive, and as charming as a cobra as he weaves his spell over the Safiens.

To make ends meet, they rent out the upstairs room to an old classmate of Andy's, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin).  Tracy thinks he's impossibly arrogant but Andy likes him.  One day, Tracy is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening pains, and Jed is the surgeon on call.This is one creepy thriller with great acting and a script that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Baldwin is perfectly cast as the megalomaniac doctor.  He's both attractive and repulsive and owns the screen.  Kidman shows quite an acting range, going from ideal wife to something very shocking indeed.  Pullman is Everyman, struggling to get by, doing his best, and being easily fooled.  There is a scary subplot about a rapist on campus that is unnecessary, except to establish the close friendship between Andy and a hard-boiled police detective, well-played by Bebe Neuwirth.

The acting is also extremely fine, in particular the stars; there is even a brief appearance by a young Gwen Paltrow, who is a student Pulman's.In terms of plot, the stunning wife of a dowdy college prof has a health crisis, entering into a law suit to seek revenge for a bad surgical call.  Against this backdrop, there is a serial rapist on the loose, preying on students and casting a chill over the town.  Baldwin is great as the arrogant doctor with a chip on his shoulder, who happens to have been a ""jock"" in the same high school as the sensitive Pullman.  The three of them had become friends, so the ensuing events become ever more shocking as each character enters a downward spiral.  They all turn out to be very different than the viewer assumed them to be, but to tell much more would cross the spoiler threshold.

151337,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0792844696,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 5]","In ""Malice"" Nicole Kidman sets her mild-mannered husband (Bill Pulman) up against her darkly sinister lover, an utterly surgeon played by Alec Baldwin.  For Professor Andy Saffian (Bill Pullman) and his wife Tracy (Nicole Kidman), life in their idyllic new England College town is no more complicated than grading papers and fixing up their old brownstone...despite a string of brutal murders targeting Saffian's female students.  Calm is only broken by the arrival of the flamboyant Dr. Jed Hill, the new head surgeon. Hill allows himself a rep as a godlike surgeon with an almost satanic sense of self-confidence -  a paragon among an exclusive club of doctors. (Not quite tolerant of dissent in the OR, Hill is quite explicit to an assisting doctor who dares raise the possibility that one life may slip through Hill's fingers. ""I'm not going to like you"", the intimidated doctor fearfully predicts. ""Ofcourse you will"", Hill says back smiling, ""Everybody likes me"".) Hill moves in with Andy and Tracy, making their lives a living hell with his partying, but Andy is too good natured to run him out, and Tracy seems to share a strange bond with him. Tragedy strikes before the domestic situation gets too complicated - Tracy collapses and is rushed to the hospital with ovarian cysts. Jed rushes to the rescue - from the neighborhood bar. While one of Tracy's ovaries has clearly gone bad, the other may be good but appears ""necrotic"". Unable to wait for a pathologist to determine whether the remaining ovary should be removed, Jed makes a command decision - an ultimately botched one. Though Jed has his expertise on his side, he sabotages his defense with the now infamous ""I am god"" speech. Tracy, though winning the case, seems more withdrawn then ever, and disappears completely. Andy, unable to let go of Tracy follows her, only to learn dark things about his young and apparently innocent wife.It's really impossible to give more than that without spoiling it. ""Malice"" has its share of twists, though not very ironic ones - they exist as mere plot devices. The sub-plots don't always fit and it's incredible how trusting Andy is.Still ""Malice"" is a treat, mostly because of its leads. Nicole Kidman is great as a woman who isn't what she seems, Baldwin excels because he is exactly what he seems and Pullman is great because he manages to morph into a truly determined character by the final reel.

151339,A30CNC7G21P49D,0792844696,Sara,"[3, 3]","It was difficult for me to rate _Malice_ on a 5 star scale because it is one of my favorite ""turn your brain off and have fun"" movies. I think every collection, no matter how lofty, needs a few boredom-buster, no thinking required flicks in it. _Malice_ would make a good addition to that section of your collection as it has to mine.Without giving away the ending, the basic premise is this: A cute couple scrapes together enough to buy an old Victorian house. The husband, Andy (Bill Pullman), is a college dean and his wife, Tracy (Nicole Kidman), works in a daycare. The bills for renovating the home pile up and, proving that timing is everything, Andy runs into an old school buddy, Jed (Alec Baldwin). Jed is a suave, successful surgeon in need of a place to stay because he is new in town. Seeing an easy money source, Andy asks Jed to rent a room. He does and Tracy seems ill at ease with Jed there. Her abdominal cramps steadily worsen and finally she must be rushed to the hospital. Lo and behold, Jed is the surgeon who must operate on her damaged ovary. He takes both ovaries out and Tracy learns she will never be able to bear children. If that's not bad enough, she was a few weeks pregnant before the operation and the fetus aborted from the trauma of the surgery. Feeling angry that Andy consented to let Jed take both of her ovaries, Tracy leaves him and sues Jed. A multi-million dollar malpractice lawsuit is settled and the movie takes some odd turns. You learn that the unlikeliest of people are conspiring together and that someone thought to be dead is actually alive and well. True, a subplot about a serial rapist / killer is thrown in and though it may not seem to fit, it does provide a little extra element of scandal. By the film's conclusion, the loose ends are, in my opinion, tied up well enough.In terms of judging the DVD, the sound and video quality are good. The theatrical trailer is interesting and the screen formats come in both standard and widescreen options. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French. (I think these are pretty much the basic options that come on all DVDs nowadays.) Watch for brief performances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Peter Gallagher, and Bebe Neuwirth. And if nothing else, buy the film for Alec Baldwin's delectably sinful ""God-complex"" speech.

And there's a serial killer on the loose--coincidence? The film also has a wonderful supporting cast, including Bebe Neuwirth as a tough local cop, Peter Gallagher and George C.

I just got it today from this website, and it'll definately be a frequent watch, even though I got the MGM edition, if it gets re-released, I'll definately get it again, but hopefully, if they do they'll put some good features with the movie.I saw this for the first time in theatres with my mom, she kept covering my eyes so I didn't understand the plot-I was 13 at the time, I'll be 30 this year, but I had to watch it a few times before I could make any sense of it, but to me, the twists made it even more enjoyable. Nicole Kidman did a very good job in this film, Alec Baldwin, you go back and forth with his charecter-but the real villian is the biggest surprise. Because it made over $45 million in theaters,I have a hard time understanding why so many critics didn't like it, but then I keep forgetting the rule with them-if they like it, it stinks, if they don't, the audiences will.)When Alec makes the 'God complex' speech, you really have to wonder what he's up to, but he gives it so convincingly, that you almost know he's really got it backwards. The film has many good one-liners, speeches, and a surprise around every corner-half the time, you aren't sure who's the real villian of the film, not to mention who's telling the truth...about anything.Final note: after finally seeing the SAW series, I must mention Tobin Bell's cameo in this film, it was a good role for him, long before that was even thought of, at least 10 years prior.",4,""" a waste of time?""
