The episodes are wide screen, 2. Disc 1 has deleted scenes & 3. Disc 2 has commentary for episodes.  Why not with each episode-no clue about that.  But it is MUCH better than the blog from Rob on season 2.Now, this time out apparently there are ONLY 3 Kardashians in this season.  Kourtney, Kim & Khloe are only shown on both sides of the DVD case.  BOTH discs have the same photo of them.  So, they do NOT give credit to Kris, Bruce, Rob, Kendall & Kylie?

1356080,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B003O7I6KW,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[3, 7]","I just found out about this show a couple of months ago on E! and I honestly wanted to know why people didn't like Kim Kardashian so much. I STILL haven't figured it out. She's slightly spoiled (Bentley, taking photos of herself when Khloe is going to jail), but she seems like the nicest out of the bunch. I used to think it was Rob until he was so indifferent this season about stealing her Bentley and acting like that's perfectly normal. Kourtney and that nasal voice kills me, and the ridiculous way she treated her mother about that cover shot blew me. Her mother apologized and didn't do it on purpose, but she took that argument way too far. Kris spends pretty much every episode telling someone how she ""feels really bad"" about something, and most of the time it's something she shouldn't feel bad about because she's human. Ladies, deal with it. Your mother is not a robot. But what's completely crazy to me is the amount of vulgarity coming out of Khloe's mouth. She's not just mumbling curse words on the side. She's calling her mother all kinds of ""psychotic [next word bleeped]"" and the b-word. At one point while watching this show, my mother called me and I apologized to HER if I was ever disrespectful. To my relief, my mother said she couldn't recall me ever being disrespectful to her even though we've had countless arguments. I wish Khloe would learn where the line is drawn between arguing and just being vicious, especially to your mother (whether she believed it was her biological mother or not--another silly episode).Even when Kris is dead wrong (like trying to push Bruce into going to social events he's not interested in), he doesn't even react the way Khloe does. I am applauding Bruce for putting his foot down about the language used in his house by Khloe, but then Bruce threw me when he told Khloe she could lose a few pounds. Very insensitive. That was the one time I took Khloe's side and wanted to defend her. I think all the girls are beautiful in their own way, but their personalities (minus Kim) leave MUCH to be desired. I watched Disc 1 of Season 3 and have no interest in seeing any of these episodes again. You've got to be a glutton for punishment if you actually buy these seasons.The biggest irony for me is when Kourtney told Kim, ""It's disgusting to be related to you."" I was thinking that the entire time I watched Kourtney and Khloe. Kourtney was dead wrong for taking so much of Kim's stuff and having no respect for her personal belongings. Have an identity. Stop trying to bite your sister's. That's the ONE thing I can say about Khloe, she seems to want to be her own person. But my gawd, thank goodness for Bruce! Right when I thought Bruce was wrong about the weight loss comment, then he showed Kylie how NOT to act in public and why 11-year-old girls don't need to dress like miniature clowns. Nobody in sixth grade needs to wear makeup. When I saw the way Kris reacted to Kylie, then Khloe and Kourtney's personalities started to make sense. When I watched how little respect Khloe and Kourtney had for Adrienne's parents, then it definitely made sense. I just can't cut this show or this family. They're a whole new world of tacky, and my gawd, I hope it's all scripted.",2,Khloe: The Most Disrespectful Daughter Alive,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,3234,"['just', 'found', 'out', 'show', 'couple', 'months', 'E', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'know', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'so', 'much', 'STILL', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'slightly', 'spoiled', 'Bentley', 'taking', 'photos', 'herself', 'when', 'Khloe', 'going', 'jail', 'nicest', 'bunch', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'Rob', 'was', 'so', 'indifferent', 'season', 'stealing', 'Bentley', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'Kourtney', 'nasal', 'voice', 'kills', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'treated', 'mother', 'cover', 'shot', 'blew', 'mother', 'apologized', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'purpose', 'took', 'argument', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'Kris', 'pretty', 'much', 'episode', 'telling', 'someone', 'how', 'feels', 'really', 'bad', 'something', 'most', 'time', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'human', 'Ladies', 'deal', 'mother', 'not', 'robot', 'what', 'completely', 'crazy', 'amount', 'vulgarity', 'coming', 'Khloe', 'mouth', 'not', 'just', 'mumbling', 'curse', 'words', 'side', 'calling', 'mother', 'kinds', 'psychotic', '[', 'next', 'word', 'bleeped', ']', 'b-word', 'one', 'point', 'watching', 'show', 'mother', 'called', 'apologized', 'HER', 'was', 'ever', 'disrespectful', 'relief', 'mother', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'even', ""'ve"", 'had', 'countless', 'arguments', 'wish', 'Khloe', 'would', 'learn', 'where', 'line', 'drawn', 'arguing', 'just', 'being', 'vicious', 'especially', 'mother', 'believed', 'was', 'biological', 'mother', 'not', 'silly', 'episode', '.Even', 'when', 'Kris', 'dead', 'wrong', 'trying', 'push', 'Bruce', 'going', 'social', 'events', 'not', 'interested', ""n't"", 'even', 'react', 'way', 'Khloe', 'am', 'applauding', 'Bruce', 'putting', 'foot', 'down', 'language', 'used', 'house', 'Khloe', 'then', 'Bruce', 'threw', 'when', 'told', 'Khloe', 'could', 'lose', 'few', 'pounds', 'Very', 'insensitive', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'took', 'Khloe', 'side', 'wanted', 'defend', 'think', 'girls', 'are', 'beautiful', 'own', 'way', 'personalities', 'Kim', 'leave', 'MUCH', 'be', 'desired', 'watched', 'Disc', '1', 'Season', '3', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'again', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'glutton', 'punishment', 'actually', 'buy', 'seasons.The', 'biggest', 'irony', 'when', 'Kourtney', 'told', 'Kim', 'disgusting', 'be', 'related', 'was', 'thinking', 'entire', 'time', 'watched', 'Kourtney', 'Khloe', 'Kourtney', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', 'taking', 'so', 'much', 'Kim', 'stuff', 'having', 'respect', 'personal', 'belongings', 'Have', 'identity', 'Stop', 'trying', 'bite', 'sister', 'ONE', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Khloe', 'want', 'be', 'own', 'person', 'gawd', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Bruce', 'Right', 'when', 'thought', 'Bruce', 'was', 'wrong', 'weight', 'loss', 'comment', 'then', 'showed', 'Kylie', 'how', 'NOT', 'act', 'public', 'why', '11-year-old', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'dress', 'miniature', 'clowns', 'Nobody', 'sixth', 'grade', 'needs', 'wear', 'makeup', 'When', 'saw', 'way', 'Kris', 'reacted', 'Kylie', 'then', 'Khloe', 'Kourtney', 'personalities', 'started', 'make', 'sense', 'When', 'watched', 'how', 'little', 'respect', 'Khloe', 'Kourtney', 'had', 'Adrienne', 'parents', 'then', 'definitely', 'made', 'sense', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cut', 'show', 'family', ""'re"", 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'tacky', 'gawd', 'hope', 'scripted']",Keeping Up with the Kardashians: Season 3
