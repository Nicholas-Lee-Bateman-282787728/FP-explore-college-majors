1634850,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00BI7ZAM2,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[6, 7]","IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA: THE COMPLETE SEASON 8 has been out for about a month now, and has recently been reduced in price at some of the big boxes.  I have mixed feelings about this two-disc set but am glad I bought it.PROS:  Some very funny episodes here.  My favorites are ""The Gang Recycles Their Trash,"" ""The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre"" (impending nuptials to Liam McPoyle!), ""The Gang Gets Analyzed,"" ""Charlie's Mom Has Cancer"" (including Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs' star turn as a touchy-feely healer), and ""Charlie Rules the World"" (an MMORPG with avatars for all the gang).CONS:  Only ten episodes, but that is not too far off par for this series. ""Frank's Back in Business"" and ""The Gang Dines out"" in particular feel perfunctory and phoned-in.DEBATABLE:  Some of the funniest episodes have distinct antecedents.  ""The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre"" will be much funnier to people who understand Dennis' prior interaction with Maureen Ponderosa and the gang's uneasy history with the McPoyle clan.  ""The Gang Gets Analyzed"" harks back to a much earlier episode about a group intervention but if anything, the second time is even funnier so I forgive them.  ""The Gang Recycles Their Trash"" in particular lifts dialog from earlier episodes in earlier years, particularly ""The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis"" from 2008 (selling gasoline door-to-door).  This repetition was done on purpose but some people missed the joke and found the plagiarism lazy rather than comic.MORE PROS:  Really good bells-and-whistles.  Four of the ten episodes have full commentary.  Side features include little delights like ""Fat Mac: In Memoriam,"" gag and deletion reels, and ""Lady House: The Lost Premiere,"" a pseudo-pilot of a pseudo-sitcom starring Mac's and Charlie's moms, who now live together.  The last one is so hilariously bad I've heard Fox network is thinking of picking it up, lol.OVERALL:  If you are new to the series, this is not the place to begin.  Instead, try this set that covers the first five years and the Christmas special, where the cost per episode is much lower:It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Complete Seasons 1-5 + A Very Sunny Christmas Special.  At its best, the shows of Season Eight are up to the standards of the prior seven years, but there are a couple of disappointments.  At nearly twenty-five dollars, IMO Season Eight is a little overpriced right now.  I was going to give this set four stars but superior Extras made me raise it to five.",4,A good continuation of the series -- some episodes are better than others,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,2483,"['IT', 'ALWAYS', 'SUNNY', 'IN', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'COMPLETE', 'SEASON', '8', 'been', 'out', 'about', 'month', 'now', 'recently', 'been', 'reduced', 'price', 'big', 'boxes', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'two-disc', 'set', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'it.PROS', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'here', 'favorites', 'are', 'Gang', 'Recycles', 'Their', 'Trash', 'Maureen', 'Ponderosa', 'Wedding', 'Massacre', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'Liam', 'McPoyle', 'Gang', 'Gets', 'Analyzed', 'Charlie', 'Mom', 'Has', 'Cancer', 'including', 'Sean', 'P', 'Diddy', 'Combs', 'star', 'turn', 'touchy-feely', 'healer', 'Charlie', 'Rules', 'World', 'MMORPG', 'avatars', 'gang', '.CONS', 'Only', 'episodes', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'par', 'series', 'Frank', 'Back', 'Business', 'Gang', 'Dines', 'out', 'particular', 'feel', 'perfunctory', 'phoned-in.DEBATABLE', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'have', 'distinct', 'antecedents', 'Maureen', 'Ponderosa', 'Wedding', 'Massacre', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'people', 'who', 'understand', 'Dennis', 'prior', 'interaction', 'Maureen', 'Ponderosa', 'gang', 'uneasy', 'history', 'McPoyle', 'clan', 'Gang', 'Gets', 'Analyzed', 'back', 'much', 'earlier', 'episode', 'group', 'intervention', 'anything', 'second', 'time', 'even', 'funnier', 'so', 'forgive', 'Gang', 'Recycles', 'Their', 'Trash', 'particular', 'lifts', 'dialog', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'years', 'particularly', 'Gang', 'Gas', 'Crisis', '2008', 'selling', 'gasoline', 'door-to-door', 'repetition', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'people', 'missed', 'joke', 'found', 'plagiarism', 'rather', 'comic.MORE', 'PROS', 'Really', 'good', 'bells-and-whistles', 'Four', 'ten', 'episodes', 'have', 'full', 'commentary', 'Side', 'include', 'little', 'delights', 'Fat', 'Mac', 'Memoriam', 'gag', 'deletion', 'reels', 'Lady', 'House', 'Lost', 'Premiere', 'pseudo-pilot', 'pseudo-sitcom', 'starring', 'Mac', 'Charlie', 'moms', 'who', 'now', 'live', 'together', 'last', 'one', 'so', 'hilariously', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Fox', 'network', 'thinking', 'picking', 'up', 'lol.OVERALL', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'not', 'place', 'begin', 'Instead', 'try', 'set', 'first', 'five', 'years', 'Christmas', 'special', 'where', 'cost', 'episode', 'much', 'lower', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'Complete', 'Seasons', '1-5', '+', 'Very', 'Sunny', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'best', 'shows', 'Season', 'Eight', 'are', 'up', 'standards', 'prior', 'seven', 'years', 'are', 'couple', 'disappointments', 'nearly', 'twenty-five', 'dollars', 'IMO', 'Season', 'Eight', 'little', 'overpriced', 'right', 'now', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'superior', 'Extras', 'made', 'raise', 'five']",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: The Complete Season 8

1634854,A2LSWBBCLW87LW,B00BI7ZAM2,Devan,"[3, 4]","The series as a whole is not everyone's cup of tea, but for millions of viewers like myself, we've been hooked since it first hit the scene (personally, I think the second season sealed the deal). The Gang's absurd schemes--and the behavior that follows--are a huge part of the show's success, but what I love most about Always Sunny is the acting and chemistry between the characters.Before I jump in, I must say that the series hit its peak with seasons 4 through 6; Season 7 isn't great on the surface, but the more you watch it, the funnier it becomes. This will most likely be the case with season 8. Some of the episodes don't leap out at you the way previous seasons did; there are a ton of references to previous seasons and feature some characters we haven't seen in a while, like Pop Pop, The Lawyer, Maureen Ponderosa, and the McPoyle twins. The Gang still get themselves into strange and dark situations, and even though people have become jaded to the kind of outrageousness that brought the show so much notoriety in the past, the chemistry is still there.
