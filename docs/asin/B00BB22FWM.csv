1623797,A3KVAS0IALLIHE,B00BB22FWM,"bbrockRailFan ""Brian Brocksmith""","[5, 7]",When I saw the box cover I saw a a young girl holding a gun behind her back. As I was watching this movie I only remember her with a revolverin one scene. The movie itself is fair. It is most certainly not a super violent or over the top movie as is lead to believe by the box art. Thisis not even a crime related movie either. I saw it as more of something made for the Lifetime or HallMark Channel. This movie is pretty tame and barleyeven deserves a PG rating. Maybe just for a small amount of profanity but their is no nudity in it at all. I think this movie needs different box cover art to properly represent it.,2,Preacher's Daughter a review,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,618,"['When', 'saw', 'box', 'cover', 'saw', 'young', 'girl', 'holding', 'gun', 'back', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'only', 'remember', 'revolverin', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'fair', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'super', 'violent', 'top', 'movie', 'lead', 'believe', 'box', 'art', 'Thisis', 'not', 'even', 'crime', 'related', 'movie', 'saw', 'more', 'something', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'HallMark', 'Channel', 'movie', 'pretty', 'tame', 'barleyeven', 'PG', 'rating', 'Maybe', 'just', 'small', 'amount', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'think', 'movie', 'different', 'box', 'cover', 'art', 'properly', 'represent']",The Preacher's Daughter

1623800,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BB22FWM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","4 Stars for Actual Movie1 Star for Marketing MisrepresentationIf one were to look at the DVD packaging for ""The Preacher's Daughter,"" you would undoubtedly guess that it was a slice of B-movie exploitation.  I would like to say that whoever conceived of the idea to market the movie in this way was an absolute moron.  Sorry, but it had to be said.  Anyone looking for a ""hot girls with guns"" action film (as is portrayed) will absolutely loathe this movie.  In truth, ""The Preacher's Daughter"" is a surprisingly effective character drama.  And anyone looking for that type of film would definitely stay away from something that looks like a white trash epic or a vigilante shoot-em-up.  Just to be perfectly clear:  the movie is completely, one hundred percent misrepresented in its artwork and advertising!  Not just a little bit.  It's a lose-lose situation.  People who buy it, won't like it.  Those who would like it, won't buy it.  Utter nonsense!  Whew!  That feels better.  Now on to the movie.Andrea Bowen (Desperate Housewives) plays the troubled young woman at the center of ""The Preacher's Daughter.""  As we meet her, in an awful wig, her life is spiraling out of control in the big city.  After a drug bust, she calls her daddy who happens to be a small town preacher.  Despite having been estranged for four years, he picks her up and brings her home.  As she faces her past, the story breaks into flashbacks and we see two concurrent time frames alternate from this point on.  In the present, we see Bowen try to get her life back on track.  In the past, we see just what caused her to flee town many years ago.  And in both, the tale is told better than you might expect.  The screenplay really focuses on developing Bowen's character and this is a nicely realized turn.  A couple of moments are a bit over-the-top (local drug dealer), but overall the effect is understated and meaningful.  And while faith is certainly a component to the film, I felt it was presented in a way that was consistent with this type of upbringing.I never paid much attention to Bowen on ""Desperate Housewives,"" finding her Julie a bit bland.  It's easy to see why she went after this role (she even has a producer credit).  On one side, it has a hard edge.  On the other, it has a naked vulnerability.  The entire movie rests on her shoulders.  And she underplays naturally.  I also particularly liked Adam Mayfield as the church choir director who plays a significant role in the proceedings.  It would have been easy for this experience to be preachy and overbearing, but the screenplay shows unexpected restraint.  As a character study, ""The Preacher's Daughter"" works.  Once again, though, I have to ask it:  What is up with that DVD cover?

And that's not easy at all. By and by you come to understand what made her leave her hometown, because of the long flashbacks. Actually this film is more playing in the past, then the present. But that didn't really bother me. It's like a puzzle where you are given more and more parts. Although some parts are pretty predictable.

1623802,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00BB22FWM,S. Der,"[0, 0]","As like the other reviews stated, this movie doesn't seem to violent at all. The movie cover is really misleading with the NOT RATED movie. This movie is PG or PG-13 at the most and could be air on public TV no problem now a days. In fact, I seen worse things happen on TV movies/shows than this.First thing first, the gun behind the girl's back on the cover is not there ever. Also, the back cover has the daughter holding a gun as well. i don't know what's up with the gun drawing being shown on the title or back cover, but it's not there! The only gun there is in the whole movie seen bad one drug dealer and it wasn't even fired or used.Now let me talk about the movie. This movie is one of those family coming together movies, and you could watch it with you family and you could talk about the things being shown in the movie. It's about a daughter that grew up in Trinity, TX  with her SUPER religious family and runs away to Austin, TX, when she turns 18. Also, unknown to her family, she keeps a very bad secretly that she done to them. Once she runs away, she wants to forget it all and starts doing drugs. She also meets her Boyfriend as well, which doesn't help her situation as he is a drug dealer.After some time, she and her Boyfriend get caught by the police in their car. They both get arrested by having drugs in the car. This all leads to the boyfriend going to jail and the daughter going back to her hometown. The movie then starts with flashbacks of the daughter life before her going to Austin, TX. Then, would revel more and more of her life story. Then, the movie would come back to the present time and go back to flashbacks when something new is revealed.I only recommend this movie if you want to talk to your teenage kids about drug issues, sex, running away, or anything else you see in this movie. This is a good movie to show them that family first and what bad things that comes along the way, the family can overcome it and get through it.",3,What is up with that cover???,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1974,"['other', 'reviews', 'stated', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'violent', 'movie', 'cover', 'really', 'misleading', 'NOT', 'RATED', 'movie', 'movie', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'air', 'public', 'TV', 'problem', 'now', 'days', 'fact', 'seen', 'worse', 'things', 'happen', 'TV', 'movies/shows', 'this.First', 'thing', 'first', 'gun', 'girl', 'back', 'cover', 'not', 'there', 'ever', 'Also', 'back', 'cover', 'daughter', 'holding', 'gun', 'as', 'well', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'up', 'gun', 'drawing', 'being', 'shown', 'title', 'back', 'cover', 'not', 'there', 'only', 'gun', 'whole', 'movie', 'seen', 'bad', 'one', 'drug', 'dealer', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'fired', 'used.Now', 'let', 'talk', 'movie', 'movie', 'one', 'family', 'coming', 'together', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', 'family', 'could', 'talk', 'things', 'being', 'shown', 'movie', 'daughter', 'grew', 'up', 'Trinity', 'TX', 'SUPER', 'religious', 'family', 'away', 'Austin', 'TX', 'when', '18', 'Also', 'unknown', 'family', 'very', 'bad', 'secretly', 'done', 'away', 'forget', 'doing', 'drugs', 'also', 'Boyfriend', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'help', 'situation', 'drug', 'dealer.After', 'time', 'Boyfriend', 'get', 'caught', 'police', 'car', 'get', 'arrested', 'having', 'drugs', 'car', 'boyfriend', 'going', 'jail', 'daughter', 'going', 'back', 'hometown', 'movie', 'then', 'flashbacks', 'daughter', 'life', 'going', 'Austin', 'TX', 'Then', 'would', 'revel', 'more', 'more', 'life', 'story', 'Then', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'present', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'something', 'new', 'revealed.I', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'want', 'talk', 'teenage', 'kids', 'drug', 'issues', 'sex', 'running', 'away', 'anything', 'else', 'see', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'family', 'first', 'what', 'bad', 'things', 'way', 'family', 'can', 'overcome', 'get']",The Preacher's Daughter
