1664922,A61B8N6588SCY,B00E688U9K,"JPL ""Avid Gamer, Anime, Manga and Movie Enthu...","[8, 11]","High School of the Dead is a fantastic yet interesting anime series combining the Zombie Apocalypse with colorful characters and tons of fan service. The story chronicles the lives of 5 high school students (2 male, 3 female), the school nurse and a little girl who fight off a spreading zombie epidemic as they try to escape to safety. However, the interesting part comes in that all the girls are buxom beauties (save for the loli girl) that find their way into revealing outfits while still finding a way to smash, crush, and annihilate hordes of the undead. Yet, you still grow with the characters through their personal struggles and situations...as well as witness the destruction of society and the psychological effects such devastation has on normal humans. Any fans of Shonen, Harem, Apocalypse and Ecchi will certainly have a delight with the 1st anime season.With all of this, they still find time for the stereotypical &#34;beach&#34; episode in the form of this 16 minute OVA. This particular episode was a bonus for anyone who purchased the 7th manga volume in Japan and supplies a welcome break from the dramatic action that our heroes have encountered. However, be prepared...this is a comedic fan service fest and not much more.Stumbling across an island, our characters believe that they have finally found a safe haven to take a well needed rest from the end of the world. After discovering an abandoned hut, the only clean clothing they find are skimpy bathing suits for the older women, a speedo for Takashi and an elementary female swimsuit for everyone's favorite hefty male gun enthusiast! I won't give too much more away but lets just say that when hallucinations start affecting the crew, it sends the sexual urges of our heroes into a frenzy! I am sure you can figure out where this goes from here.There are some hilarious moments but the episode does not go into any deep character developments or action that was supplied in the first series. The runtime as mentioned is approximately 16 minutes so don't expect an epic story arc. The dub does an excellent job but the beautiful Japanese language with subs are here as well. The Blu-ray transfer looks gorgeous and there were no noticeable issues with the dub or subtitles. Unfortunately, there are no special features other than the Blu-ray credits and Sentai Filmworks trailers.For anyone new to the series, I suggest watching the first season before even touching this. For everyone else, if you are a completist then go for it! Too bad this couldn't have been put together with the original series, but at least we get the opportunity to view it in the states complete with a dub option. I wound up picking it up at Rightstuf.com during a Sentai Fimworks/Section 23 sale so I was able to get it for a lower price. It is not imperative for you to get this to see what happens next...simply a hilarious yet short episode to see our characters in another crazy situation!(PS...when you do pick it up...make sure to watch through past the end credits!)",4,"High School of the Dead finally gets its ""beach"" episode - Hilarious yet Short.",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,3032,"['High', 'School', 'Dead', 'fantastic', 'yet', 'interesting', 'anime', 'series', 'combining', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'colorful', 'characters', 'tons', 'fan', 'service', 'story', 'lives', '5', 'high', 'school', 'students', '2', 'male', '3', 'female', 'school', 'nurse', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'fight', 'off', 'spreading', 'zombie', 'try', 'escape', 'safety', 'However', 'interesting', 'part', 'girls', 'are', 'buxom', 'beauties', 'save', 'loli', 'girl', 'find', 'way', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'still', 'finding', 'way', 'smash', 'crush', 'annihilate', 'hordes', 'undead', 'still', 'grow', 'characters', 'personal', 'struggles', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'witness', 'destruction', 'society', 'psychological', 'effects', 'such', 'devastation', 'normal', 'humans', 'fans', 'Shonen', 'Harem', 'Apocalypse', 'Ecchi', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'delight', '1st', 'anime', 'season.With', 'still', 'find', 'time', 'stereotypical', '34', 'beach', '34', 'episode', 'form', '16', 'minute', 'OVA', 'particular', 'episode', 'was', 'bonus', 'anyone', 'who', 'purchased', '7th', 'manga', 'volume', 'Japan', 'supplies', 'welcome', 'break', 'dramatic', 'action', 'heroes', 'have', 'encountered', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'comedic', 'fan', 'service', 'fest', 'not', 'much', 'more.Stumbling', 'island', 'characters', 'believe', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'safe', 'haven', 'take', 'well', 'needed', 'rest', 'end', 'world', 'discovering', 'abandoned', 'hut', 'only', 'clean', 'clothing', 'find', 'are', 'skimpy', 'bathing', 'suits', 'older', 'women', 'speedo', 'Takashi', 'elementary', 'female', 'swimsuit', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'hefty', 'male', 'gun', 'enthusiast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'away', 'just', 'say', 'when', 'hallucinations', 'start', 'affecting', 'crew', 'sexual', 'urges', 'heroes', 'frenzy', 'am', 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'episode', 'not', 'go', 'deep', 'character', 'developments', 'action', 'was', 'supplied', 'first', 'series', 'runtime', 'mentioned', 'approximately', '16', 'minutes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'epic', 'story', 'arc', 'dub', 'excellent', 'job', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'language', 'subs', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'noticeable', 'issues', 'dub', 'subtitles', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'special', 'other', 'Blu-ray', 'credits', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'trailers.For', 'anyone', 'new', 'series', 'suggest', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'touching', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'completist', 'then', 'go', 'Too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'original', 'series', 'least', 'get', 'opportunity', 'view', 'states', 'complete', 'dub', 'option', 'wound', 'up', 'picking', 'up', 'Rightstuf.com', 'Sentai', 'Fimworks/Section', '23', 'sale', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'lower', 'price', 'not', 'imperative', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'short', 'episode', 'see', 'characters', 'crazy', 'situation', 'PS', 'when', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'end']",High School of the Dead OVA: Drifters of the Dead

At this time there is no second season, so this is all we get. This OVA episode takes place after the 12 episode series, but takes place on a beach. What could possibly happen on a beach? If you have seen the series then you would not be surprised with what would happen in this episode.Most importantly, one should note that this feature is only about 15 minutes long, excluding the songs. It is sort of a rip-off purchase if you are expecting a lot more from this single episode. This episode should have been released with the series, not as a stand alone. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sentai Filmworks releases the entire series again with this episode included with it. That would have been the smart decision in the first place.What is this episode like? Well, if I told you, that would defeat the entire purpose of even watching this episode since it is so short.

How and when they got there isn't really explained or ties in with the first series.  I am only on the 5th volume of the Manga and it isn't there either.  I am told a break comes up later on.As I mention break; this is basically what goes on for the story.  It's a break from the running, fighting and hiding.  We get to see the girls in as little as possible for the traditional beach scene.There is also a situation with hallucinations that follow a sexual nature so this is NOT kid friendly.Overall I am mixed on this one.  I would like to see more but will probably wait to see if there is a series set.  As to following the first series; this is not needed as it doesn't really follow or add to it.

1664931,A2F6UZ8BMH45GX,B00E688U9K,peter krug,"[0, 0]","Taking place after the TV series ended, Takashi and his friends decide to escape from the zombie-infested mainland by traveling by boat to a small island to relax and unwind. After arriving they all change into swimware (the teenage girls and school nurse Shizuka all dress in teeny weeny bikinis) and enjoy some R&R; in the sun. Later that night, they cook some fish, but the leaves they use to burn them turn out to be hydrangea leaves, which causes everyone to have hallucinations...First, the good: Sentai has brought back all the English voice actors from the TV series to repraise their roles, and they all do great work as before. There's plenty of fanservice and humor, especially after the hallucinations set in. I definetly had a good time watching this.Now, the bad: while the TV series followed the manga almost flawlessly, (or the first four volumes, at least) taking almost no liberties at all, this is a story that wasn't in the manga but was an original story made specifically for the anime. There's no human-vs-zombie action here, the emphesis is on light comedy and fanservice.The biggest problem is the lack of content: the whole DVD has just one 15 minute episode, and NO extras. To me this is unforgivable. Back when Sentai Filmworks was still ADV, there were a couple of times when they'd release a DVD that had just one half-hour-or-less long OVA. (Some examples that come immediately to mind are GRRL POWER and SLAYERS PREMIUM) To make up for this they included behind-the-scenes interviews with the voice actors and voice actor commentary for both. Well, guess what? There's none of that here. It's just the show which ends all too quickly, which seems like a real waste of a DVD. They should've either loaded it with extras for the sake of having more content, or they should've included this episode in the TV series, perhaps had it at the end of the second disk after the last TV episode.To summerize: it's lots of fun, yet it feels like there's not nearly enough here. Also at the end of the episode something happens that makes you seriously wonder about the fate of one of the characters, and we never get a direct answer.",4,Fun yet disappointing follow-up,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,2154,"['Taking', 'place', 'TV', 'series', 'ended', 'Takashi', 'friends', 'decide', 'escape', 'zombie-infested', 'mainland', 'traveling', 'boat', 'small', 'island', 'relax', 'unwind', 'arriving', 'change', 'swimware', 'teenage', 'girls', 'school', 'nurse', 'Shizuka', 'dress', 'teeny', 'weeny', 'bikinis', 'enjoy', 'R', 'R', 'sun', 'Later', 'night', 'cook', 'fish', 'leaves', 'use', 'burn', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hydrangea', 'leaves', 'everyone', 'have', 'hallucinations', 'First', 'good', 'Sentai', 'brought', 'back', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'TV', 'series', 'repraise', 'roles', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'before', 'plenty', 'fanservice', 'humor', 'especially', 'hallucinations', 'set', 'definetly', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'this.Now', 'bad', 'TV', 'series', 'followed', 'manga', 'almost', 'flawlessly', 'first', 'four', 'volumes', 'least', 'taking', 'almost', 'liberties', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'manga', 'was', 'original', 'story', 'made', 'specifically', 'anime', 'human-vs-zombie', 'action', 'here', 'emphesis', 'light', 'comedy', 'fanservice.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'lack', 'content', 'whole', 'DVD', 'just', 'one', '15', 'minute', 'episode', 'extras', 'unforgivable', 'Back', 'when', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'was', 'still', 'ADV', 'were', 'couple', 'times', 'when', ""'d"", 'release', 'DVD', 'had', 'just', 'one', 'half-hour-or-less', 'long', 'OVA', 'examples', 'come', 'immediately', 'mind', 'are', 'GRRL', 'POWER', 'SLAYERS', 'PREMIUM', 'make', 'up', 'included', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews', 'voice', 'actors', 'voice', 'actor', 'commentary', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'none', 'here', 'just', 'show', 'too', 'quickly', 'real', 'waste', 'DVD', 'should', ""'ve"", 'loaded', 'extras', 'sake', 'having', 'more', 'content', 'should', ""'ve"", 'included', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'perhaps', 'had', 'end', 'second', 'disk', 'last', 'TV', 'episode.To', 'summerize', 'lots', 'fun', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'here', 'Also', 'end', 'episode', 'something', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'fate', 'one', 'characters', 'never', 'get', 'direct', 'answer']",High School of the Dead OVA: Drifters of the Dead
