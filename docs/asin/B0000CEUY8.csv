Grasp the Sparrow's Tail, for example, looks very strange in this video.  I understand that Dr. Yang is a Shaolin White Crane expert, so perhaps his Taijiquan is influenced by his martial arts background, anyway it is very different to me.  However I will say that the quality of the DVD is very good.  It is well laid out and the production quality is probably the best I have ever seen.  If you are a student of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming this is probably an excellent video to own.",3,"Good quality, but the moves are different",1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,659,"['own', 'several', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'DVD', 'have', 'taken', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'couple', 'different', 'places', 'having', 'said', 'moves', 'video', 'are', 'different', 'have', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Grasp', 'Sparrow', 'Tail', 'example', 'very', 'strange', 'video', 'understand', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'Shaolin', 'White', 'Crane', 'expert', 'perhaps', 'Taijiquan', 'influenced', 'martial', 'arts', 'background', 'anyway', 'very', 'different', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'production', 'quality', 'probably', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'student', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'Jwing', 'Ming', 'probably', 'excellent', 'video', 'own']",Tai Chi Chuan: Classical Yang Style

It provides a great warm-up rotine and an analysis and presentation of the postures of the form.  Also, there is a section that analyses the most basic and repeated movements in the form and how they relate to self-defense.  This gives the practioner a sense of what each posture in the form is inteneded to be doing as one practices the form.  It would take a beginner quite a while to become proficient in just this foundational stuff, but by the time one did become proficient at it, one's Tai Chi practice could easily move into more advanced stuff without running into set-backs.",5,Very Foundational,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,687,"['Tai', 'Chi', 'Chuan', 'practice', 'always', 'close', 'attention', 'foundations', 'great', 'foundational', 'DVD', 'great', 'warm-up', 'rotine', 'analysis', 'presentation', 'postures', 'form', 'Also', 'section', 'most', 'basic', 'repeated', 'movements', 'form', 'how', 'relate', 'self-defense', 'practioner', 'sense', 'what', 'posture', 'form', 'inteneded', 'be', 'doing', 'one', 'practices', 'form', 'would', 'take', 'beginner', 'quite', 'while', 'become', 'proficient', 'just', 'foundational', 'stuff', 'time', 'one', 'did', 'become', 'proficient', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'practice', 'could', 'easily', 'move', 'more', 'advanced', 'stuff', 'running', 'set-backs']",Tai Chi Chuan: Classical Yang Style

The moves of all Tai Chi styles look different of course, even the same style can look different when done by different students. Tai Chi has been taught person-to-person for centuries: of course the moves will be different as each person changes it slightly.Often when you see Tai Chi, you are seeing a form that has been modified repeatedly by many generations of students.The Tai Chi of Dr Yang is very authentic, and I believe it is very close to its martial arts origin. Each move has a practical martial art application, which is very important, and also quite rare nowadays. Based on Dr Yang's scholarly research in the field, I trust that his Tai Chi is the closest form to how Yang style was originally intended to be.The DVD navigation is second to none. It says in the credits that the program was originally filmed in Europe, about 10 years ago. The lighting is good, and the program has a nice mood/great music. This is not flashy 'tai chi on the beach'- it is a demonstration in a classroom by a very traditional master. His 'theory seminar' in the beginning is amazing! The DVD is easy to learn from, although with 4 hours of content, it will take years to assimilate it all.

776160,A28UY9ARH7WVKS,B0000CEUY8,"Patrick H. Dickson ""TAIJIQUAN.COM""","[62, 64]","Having owned the videotape of this offering from Dr. Yang, I was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the DVD.  I was very satisfied with the information offered on the VHS tape, but having already owned the material, it didn't make sense to purchase a DVD unless there was something added to the material.Generally, when a company releases a DVD of a previously released VHS tape, there is very little added to the DVD release.  Fortunately, in line with the high quality of YMAA publications, this DVD has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original VHS.Combine this with the ease of access that a DVD offers and the Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD becomes even more of a bargain.The video offers material and instruction for the following:The Taijiquan Thirteen PosturesThe Fundamental 8 StancesTaiji Qigong, with stretching and three sets taughtThe Yang Style Taijiquan sequence (The long form)The video also has an extensive lecture on Taijiquan Theory by Dr. Yang as well as a demonstration of Fa Jing and a list of all the movements of the long form.The lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn Taijiquan.  Merely imitating the postures and movements, which sadly is how many people practice Taijiquan, without an understanding of the philosophy from which Taijiquan developed, would severely limit one's experience.Dr. Yang discusses how Taiji is between Wuji (nothingness) and yin and yang.  This concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of Taijiquan.  When you begin the form, you should stand in a beginning posture which represents Wuji, or nothingness/emptiness, during which you settle the body, relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this Wuji state.Then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the Taiji (which came from the Wuji) splits into the yin and yang.  The dead hands and body, maximum yin, become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang, along with the whole body.  Now the form begins.I see many practitioners walk up, stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from.  The transition from Wuji to Taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of Taijiquan.Dr. Yang points out that Taiji, the theory of which is explained so well in this video, has been around for approximately four thousand years, whereas Taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years.  The use of this theory in Daoism is also explained by Dr. Yang.  The link between Taijiquan and Daoism  through their mutual use of the philosophy of Taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning Taijiquan.Dr. Yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of Taijiquan and the laws of physics.  This lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video.  Too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered.  This video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn Taijiquan.Throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the Taijiquan Qigong.  The demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol.I would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this DVD.  A wonderful addition to Dr. Yang's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the VHS version of this video.",5,"Another pearl from Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming and David Silver",1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,3755,"['Having', 'owned', 'videotape', 'offering', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'was', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'information', 'offered', 'VHS', 'tape', 'having', 'already', 'owned', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'was', 'something', 'added', 'material.Generally', 'when', 'company', 'DVD', 'previously', 'released', 'VHS', 'tape', 'very', 'little', 'added', 'DVD', 'release', 'Fortunately', 'line', 'high', 'quality', 'YMAA', 'publications', 'DVD', 'approximately', 'two', 'hours', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'VHS.Combine', 'ease', 'access', 'DVD', 'offers', 'Taijiquan', 'Classical', 'Yang', 'Style', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'bargain.The', 'video', 'material', 'instruction', 'following', 'Taijiquan', 'Thirteen', 'PosturesThe', 'Fundamental', '8', 'StancesTaiji', 'Qigong', 'stretching', 'three', 'sets', 'taughtThe', 'Yang', 'Style', 'Taijiquan', 'sequence', 'long', 'form', 'video', 'also', 'extensive', 'lecture', 'Taijiquan', 'Theory', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'as', 'well', 'demonstration', 'Fa', 'Jing', 'list', 'movements', 'long', 'form.The', 'lecture', 'vital', 'anyone', 'who', 'learn', 'Taijiquan', 'Merely', 'imitating', 'postures', 'movements', 'sadly', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'practice', 'Taijiquan', 'understanding', 'philosophy', 'Taijiquan', 'developed', 'would', 'severely', 'limit', 'one', 'experience.Dr', 'Yang', 'how', 'Taiji', 'Wuji', 'nothingness', 'yang', 'concept', 'extremely', 'important', 'vital', 'performance', 'practice', 'Taijiquan', 'When', 'begin', 'form', 'should', 'stand', 'beginning', 'posture', 'Wuji', 'nothingness/emptiness', 'settle', 'body', 'relax', 'breath', 'bring', 'parts', 'body', 'mind', 'Wuji', 'state.Then', 'thought/intention', 'born', 'mind', 'Taiji', 'came', 'Wuji', 'yin', 'yang', 'dead', 'hands', 'body', 'maximum', 'yin', 'become', 'alive', 'slowly', 'inflate', 'expand', 'balance', 'maximum', 'yin', 'maximum', 'yang', 'whole', 'body', 'Now', 'form', 'begins.I', 'see', 'many', 'practitioners', 'walk', 'up', 'stand', 'still', 'one', 'second', 'leap', 'form', 'understanding', 'where', 'yin', 'yang', 'spring', 'transition', 'Wuji', 'Taiji', 'interplay', 'yin', 'yang', 'one', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'engaging', 'aspects', 'Taijiquan.Dr', 'Yang', 'out', 'Taiji', 'theory', 'explained', 'so', 'well', 'video', 'been', 'approximately', 'four', 'thousand', 'years', 'whereas', 'Taijiquan', 'been', 'perhaps', 'thousand', 'years', 'use', 'theory', 'Daoism', 'also', 'explained', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'link', 'Taijiquan', 'Daoism', 'mutual', 'use', 'philosophy', 'Taiji', 'was', 'one', 'initial', 'reasons', 'interest', 'learning', 'Taijiquan.Dr', 'Yang', 'illustrate', 'use', 'scientific', 'formulas', 'relationship', 'Taijiquan', 'laws', 'physics', 'lecture', 'just', 'preparation', 'begin', 'use', 'other', 'parts', 'video', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'tapes', 'are', 'presented', 'martial', 'artists', 'little', 'thought', 'tying', 'together', 'explaining', 'meaning', 'what', 'offered', 'video', 'extremely', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'viewer', 'strategic', 'approach', 'will', 'enable', 'go', 'far', 'quest', 'learn', 'video', 'are', 'visual', 'clues', 'when', 'inhale', 'when', 'exhale', 'doing', 'form', 'Taijiquan', 'Qigong', 'demonstration', 'long', 'form', 'offers', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'when', 'click', 'yin-yang', 'symbol.I', 'would', 'have', 'write', 'ten', 'page', 'review', 'give', 'justice', 'material', 'presented', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'Dr.', 'Yang', 'presentations', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'even', 'already', 'own', 'VHS', 'version', 'video']",Tai Chi Chuan: Classical Yang Style

Every move from the form can be access via the menu.  Also besides showing each move you also have the option to click a button and get nore information about the how and why of each move.The information on Chi is an extra bargain.  It was easy to understand and there were Chi Kung exercises taught as well.The quality of the video was excellent and though they did not keep the camera at the same angle, I could follow along with what he was doing.Minor issues:I would have preferred the ability to control my viewing angle instead of just the one.I'm no expert and I don't know the Yang long form, but every book I have looked at and the few videos I have looked at seems to show the form slightly differently.  The movements at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd sections are different, the number of repetitions for wave hands at clouds, repulse monkey and parting mane are different (wave hands at clouds also seems to be moving in the opposite direction - right instead of left).Your enjoyment of the instruction will probably be based on whether or not you think the form should match what is normally seen or if you feel the form is open to interpretation (as long as it contains all of the moves).
