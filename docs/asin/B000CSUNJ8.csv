I honestly don't understand the mentality of hollywood.If you've got labels on the back of a dvd that's saying not to let kids watch it,then what makes hollyood think that minors are responsible enough to be part of a mature show?Probabally for the same reason that Wonder Showzen has 4-8 year old children on it's show and uses them as hate propoganda tools.Probabally for the same reason that Adult Swim is now on during the weekend so kids can watch it and 14 years old is now considered adult.As for MTV,I can see why they need a kid to entertain them,as they have infantile minds to begin with.Wasn't the whole purpose of MTV2  to create a channel JUST to play music videos?Now we get this junk;how did this all come to be?Did some big wig at a meeting just say,""Hey I've got a great idea!Let's get some annoying little puke from out of grade school,give him a guy with a camera and watch him harrass and annoy people much older than him!Now let's give him money and fame!Woohoo!The viewing public is so stupid,they'll watch anything!""This little Andy jerk will follow the same path as Tom Green.People will say he's funny for awhile,then when reality finally hits and they see that he's really just annoying,sarcastic and talentless;they'll drop him like a hot potato.He'll be yet another worthless fad to disappear.Yes,the fat,ugly arrogant little pug that is Andy Milonakis has the special ability to make alot of people genuinly angry just by looking at him...but it's nothing that a good old fashioned butt kicking couldn't fix.Where are his parents??Put a muzzle on that little A.D.D spaz,get him away from snoop dog and ground him!",1,If it's meant for mature audiences.......,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1696,"['then', 'why', 'star', 'show', 'just', 'kid', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mentality', 'hollywood.If', ""'ve"", 'got', 'labels', 'back', 'dvd', 'saying', 'not', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'then', 'what', 'hollyood', 'think', 'minors', 'are', 'responsible', 'enough', 'be', 'part', 'mature', 'show', 'Probabally', 'same', 'reason', 'Wonder', 'Showzen', '4-8', 'year', 'old', 'children', 'show', 'hate', 'propoganda', 'tools.Probabally', 'same', 'reason', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'now', 'weekend', 'so', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', '14', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'considered', 'adult.As', 'MTV', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'need', 'kid', 'entertain', 'have', 'infantile', 'minds', 'begin', 'with.Was', ""n't"", 'whole', 'purpose', 'MTV2', 'create', 'channel', 'JUST', 'play', 'music', 'videos', 'Now', 'get', 'junk', 'how', 'did', 'come', 'be', 'Did', 'big', 'wig', 'meeting', 'just', 'say', 'Hey', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'idea', 'Let', 'get', 'annoying', 'little', 'puke', 'grade', 'school', 'give', 'guy', 'camera', 'watch', 'harrass', 'annoy', 'people', 'much', 'older', 'Now', 'let', 'give', 'money', 'fame', 'Woohoo', 'viewing', 'public', 'so', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'anything', 'little', 'Andy', 'jerk', 'will', 'follow', 'same', 'path', 'Tom', 'Green.People', 'will', 'say', 'funny', 'awhile', 'then', 'when', 'reality', 'finally', 'hits', 'see', 'really', 'just', 'annoying', 'sarcastic', 'talentless', ""'ll"", 'drop', 'hot', 'potato.He', ""'ll"", 'be', 'yet', 'worthless', 'fad', 'disappear.Yes', 'fat', 'ugly', 'arrogant', 'little', 'pug', 'Andy', 'Milonakis', 'special', 'ability', 'make', 'alot', 'people', 'genuinly', 'angry', 'just', 'looking', 'nothing', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'butt', 'kicking', 'could', ""n't"", 'fix.Where', 'are', 'parents', 'Put', 'muzzle', 'little', 'A.D.D', 'spaz', 'get', 'away', 'snoop', 'dog', 'ground']",The Andy Milonakis Show - The Complete First Season

962561,A2KEKPMI3WQMPA,B000CSUNJ8,"pancake_repairman ""pancake_repairman""","[2, 3]","This is my favorite new show of the past year. Probably the most consistently clever and funny ""sketch"" comedy show ever, if you can call it that. Andy seems to be taking his cues from Tom Green's pioneering work in the antisocial ""reality comedy"" and ""acting insane"" niches, but thankfully he isn't trying to one-up Tom, he just does his own thing. The use of weird camera tricks, like making Andy's head hover around, lots of marbles fall out of his mouth, or people going through his tv screen is the most original aspect. Other trademarks of Andy's comedy include making inanimate objects talk (staple remover vampire is the best), an abscence of sex references, and his obsession with food. More than half the bits revolve around food in some way. Andy's co-stars are his best friend Ralphie, who reminds me of Wesley Willis, and a couple of old people who I guess live in his building. None of them are very funny. It doesn't detract from the show, as it leaves most of the focus on Andy, but the co-stars really are not funny. The pranks on delivery men is the only kinda unfunny part. Andy doesn't get much of a reaction out of them other than a bemused look, and he seemed to bail on the bits halfway through when he realised they weren't working, so I don't know why they ended up in the show.Anyway buy The Andy Milonakis Show on dvd.

Wubbie dreams of killing Andy and a spoon may just be what you've been dreaming of.Episode 2We learn how to make breadcrumbs, learn important lessons from Jesus Kitty, while Snoop Dogg learns that Andy may look just like him but that's where the similarity ends.Episode 3Andy loses his monster protection from the couch people, and needs protection from a rabid John Stamos that he rescues from a tree.  And whatever your favorite color is, he was just about to say that.Episode 4Guess what - Andy's guests the Black Eyed Peas taste as good as they sound, and Andy's public freestyle rapping still sounds awful.  Andy gives birth to a living coupon, then hatches an egg.Episode 5We get our news from Australia, our protection from Goggle Man.  Andy the insomniac gets no sleep, while Andy the babysitter gets no respect.Episode 6These are dark days for Andy as he gets struck by lightning, gets turned into a werewolf, wets his bed and his pants, and battles it out with Fat Joe over a game of Battleship.Disc 2Episode 7Yes, Andy's penpal from Alaska sucks.  Yes, Abraham Lincoln invented Karate, and yes, Andy rips out guest Carson Daly's arm hair.  But, remember, it is his show.Episode 8Guest Rob Schneider hangs out with the Lady of the Lake and Andy hangs out with some Magic Beans.

Not content with giving Bam Margera reason to stink up the screen, they give this hopeless, unfunny guy his own show. And wow - is it ever bad. Want to know what's worse than someone who isn't funny? Someone who isn't funny but THINKS they're funny - and being given a TV show to prove it.Whilst some would pretend to call this show ""off-beat"" and ""irrelevant"" and then blaspheme and try and mention it in the same sentence as, say, Monty Python, what other shows of this nature (obscure, wacky, ""zany"", for want of a better word) have that this program doesn't is someone funny starring in it. Oh, and funny people writing it. They seem to have forgotten that in this.So, we have fat boy Andy doing totally, like, outrageous things dude, along with funny music (because what we are watching is funny, see?) He annoys strangers! He wastes peoples time! He shouts a lot! Hey, aren't you rolling around on the floor yet either?Do you know what the ONLY funny thing is? Andy Milonakis himself. You see, he'd like all you MTV watching kids out there to believe that he's just like you, some goofball kid of 14. But he's not - he's 30, with a growth defect. Now, I'm no expert on comedy, but THAT, my friends, is funny.Not sure if this garbage is getting another series or not (the first deservedly tanked) but if it does hopefully we'll see Andy's growth defect go full scale, going past the 14 year old boy look right back to toddler age and then finally obliterating him from this earth.The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk",1,The worst show on television?,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1535,"['Good', 'ol', 'MTV', 'Not', 'content', 'giving', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'reason', 'stink', 'up', 'screen', 'give', 'hopeless', 'unfunny', 'guy', 'own', 'show', 'wow', 'ever', 'bad', 'Want', 'know', 'what', 'worse', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'funny', 'THINKS', ""'re"", 'funny', 'being', 'given', 'TV', 'show', 'prove', 'it.Whilst', 'would', 'pretend', 'call', 'show', 'off-beat', 'irrelevant', 'then', 'blaspheme', 'try', 'mention', 'same', 'sentence', 'say', 'Monty', 'Python', 'what', 'other', 'shows', 'nature', 'obscure', 'wacky', 'zany', 'want', 'better', 'word', 'have', 'program', ""n't"", 'someone', 'funny', 'starring', 'Oh', 'funny', 'people', 'writing', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'this.So', 'have', 'fat', 'boy', 'Andy', 'doing', 'totally', 'outrageous', 'things', 'dude', 'funny', 'music', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'funny', 'see', 'strangers', 'peoples', 'time', 'lot', 'Hey', 'are', ""n't"", 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'yet', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'ONLY', 'funny', 'thing', 'Andy', 'Milonakis', 'see', ""'d"", 'like', 'MTV', 'watching', 'kids', 'there', 'believe', 'just', 'goofball', 'kid', '14', 'not', '30', 'growth', 'defect', 'Now', ""'m"", 'expert', 'comedy', 'THAT', 'friends', 'funny.Not', 'sure', 'garbage', 'getting', 'series', 'not', 'first', 'deservedly', 'tanked', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Andy', 'growth', 'defect', 'go', 'full', 'scale', 'going', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'look', 'right', 'back', 'toddler', 'age', 'then', 'finally', 'obliterating', 'earth.The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You', 'yahoo.co.uk']",The Andy Milonakis Show - The Complete First Season

I mean...I was thinking where is this kids parents?  But the show, with all it's juvenile humor is quite silly but still pretty funny.  The best parts are when Andy takes to the streets of New York to interact with people on the street.  Their reactions to this crazy ""kid"" are absolutely priceless.  Andy runs down the street with a giant cow tongue hanging out of his mouth screaming as astonished onlookers watch.  Or he hands out balloons to people saying ""I hate Myself...have a nice day!""  Andy likes to have fun with pizza or Chinese food delivery guys.  In one episode he is all tied up to a chair as the delivery man arrives.  These guys normally speak little English so their reactions are really funny.  In another, Andy takes his pizza and disappears to get money, only to come back with the pizza and complain that there's a tennis shoe on it.  But that's OK because he says it's the one he lost.  And so it goes as Andy moves from one prank to another.There's no theme to the episodes, just Andy goofing off.  Each episode has a guest star such as Carson Daly or Snoop Dog.  The reason it's so hard to believe that Andy isn't a kid is that his escapades are things you'd think only a kid could possibly come up with.  Still it's funny and the show has a lot of heart.  Andy gets to do things that I suppose a lot of us would like to do.
