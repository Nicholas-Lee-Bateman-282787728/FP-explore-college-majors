The sound is surprisingly clear. Singer John Payne's vocals are very strong. Geoff Downes keyboard playing is typically great. Highlight's include The Arena, Only Time Will Tell, Go, Free, &amp; Wherever You Are. My only complaint is that the songs Kings of the Day and the Love under Fire/Sad Situation/Longest Night medley listed on the box are not on the DVD.",5,The &quot;new&quot; Asia,1049155200,"04 1, 2003",2003,477,"['Being', 'fan', 'never', 'having', 'heard', 'post', 'Wetton', 'Asia', 'lineup', 'live', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'DVD', 'sound', 'surprisingly', 'clear', 'Singer', 'John', 'Payne', 'vocals', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'keyboard', 'playing', 'typically', 'great', 'Highlight', 'include', 'Arena', 'Only', 'Time', 'Will', 'Tell', 'Go', 'Free', 'amp', 'Wherever', 'Are', 'only', 'complaint', 'songs', 'Kings', 'Day', 'Love', 'Fire/Sad', 'Situation/Longest', 'Night', 'medley', 'listed', 'box', 'are', 'not', 'DVD']",N/A

Man, the guy (he's also the bass player) has a incredibly powerful and beautiful voie, but sometimes he sings like if he was in a  gospel church!! It's really annoying, mainly on the old classics.Anyway, there are times when he can restrain himself, and the band as a whole is very good (check Chris Slade on drums. The guy is a consumate pro, decades on the road with artists going from AC/DC through Jimmy Page). The set list was also good.Another flaw is the guitar sound. It is ludicrously thin here, I can't tell if it was sounding this way at the live show or the damage was done in the mixing table.In generalm it's worth watching. Like someone below said, it's miles better than the crap that flows through the airwaves nowadays....",3,Talk about &quot;oversinging&quot;...,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,848,"['have', 'known', 'quot', 'overacting', 'quot', 'new', 'singer', 'Asia', 'real', 'quot', 'oversinging', 'quot', 'Man', 'guy', 'also', 'bass', 'player', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'voie', 'sometimes', 'was', 'gospel', 'church', 'really', 'annoying', 'mainly', 'old', 'classics.Anyway', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'restrain', 'band', 'whole', 'very', 'good', 'check', 'Chris', 'Slade', 'drums', 'guy', 'consumate', 'pro', 'decades', 'road', 'artists', 'going', 'AC/DC', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'also', 'good.Another', 'flaw', 'guitar', 'sound', 'ludicrously', 'thin', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'sounding', 'way', 'live', 'show', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'mixing', 'table.In', 'generalm', 'worth', 'watching', 'someone', 'below', 'said', 'miles', 'better', 'crap', 'airwaves', 'nowadays']",N/A

The singer and bassist, Paynes, makes me wanna puke with his exaggerated singing, destroying the old classics, even if it's clear the guy can sing like few people do. The guitarrist is a joke, his stage presence is equal to zero. Chris Slade on drums is a remarkable drummer and, as with any band he's ever played, he plays with conviction, but this is not enough to save this dumb DVD. Downes himself clearly is not enjoying none of it, playing for the paycheck.

First of all, in a time of MTV-destroyed music (with things like J-Lo and Beyonce ruling the charts) any chance of an echo from the past is well received.So, I went to check this DVD, even knowing that &quot;ASIA&quot; was not playing in it. The &quot;real&quot; ASIA must have Wetton, Palmer, Downes and Howe or, at least, the former three with another guitarrist.The result is a bunch of great songs played in a unintersting way by a strange band, with a faceless guitar player, a &quot;I've Played With Them All&quot; drummer (Chris Slade), a potent new singer and a sleepy Downes.

It was passable after Steve Howe left, because Pat Thrall filled in so admirably, but this collection of hacks are just a waste of time. The band always had enough of a monkey on their back being collection of progressive musicians playing mostly pop songs, so they had a hard enough time earning the little respect they ever got, but the monkey has bit the head off now and all that remains is a lifeless corpse being propped up by Geoff Downes' need to pay the rent. It's hard to believe that it's been 20 years for the band. Lets hope this act won't be together another 20 minutes. Stay away from this skunk.
