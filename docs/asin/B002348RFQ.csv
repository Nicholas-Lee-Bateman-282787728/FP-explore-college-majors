It is horribly put together with annoying music to create fake ambiance. They would have done better just to talk over pictures instead of all of the hideous interviews with ""experts.""

What makes the story so powerful is the fact that this possessed girl convinced Mary&#8217;s parents that she was their dead child, demonstrating remarkable knowledge about Mary&#8217;s life and connections to even distant relatives.  This type of story is not unknown among those who believe in reincarnation, but this is something else entirely because Lurancy was two years old when Mary died.So we have a compelling case of the paranormal here, one more than worthy of study and investigation.  The problem I have is with the Booth Brothers, who wrote, edited, directed, and produced this documentary.  I find it difficult to take the Booth brothers seriously as investigators &#8211; partly because they always dress like rejects from the band Poison, but mostly because they are basically filmmakers and showmen who like to use too many fancy technological tricks, sound effects, and music to juice up a story, as opposed to letting their evidence speak for itself.  Their &#8220;s&eacute;ance&#8221; at the Mary Roff house is a perfect example of their style: you&#8217;ve got a psychic sitting there hooked into some fancy biometric equipment, a laser display taking place all around him, with Ovilus responses thrown into the mix willy-nilly and totally devoid of the context in which they may have been recorded.  It&#8217;s more of a carnival show than a serious investigation.  Elsewhere, the visual evidence they get so excited about tends to consist of images I can&#8217;t make out at all (although they do catch one intriguing image in this case).  And how do they capture so many clear EVPs?  Heck, they capture over one hundred in just a few hours at the old Mary Roff house, which so far as I know isn&#8217;t even reputed to be haunted.In the end, I think this documentary is worth watching, but I&#8217;m not convinced that the Booth Brothers added anything to a story that is more than capable of standing on its own.  If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with that story, I do suggest you read up on it, though &#8211; it&#8217;s fascinating.",3,Great subject for a documentary -- but this one is a little too flashy and over the top,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2380,"['8220', 'Watseka', 'Wonder', '8221', '8217', 'ring', 'bells', 'soon', 'discovered', 'case', 'explored', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'somewhat', 'familiar', '8211', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'young', 'Lurancy', 'Vennum', 'spiritual', 'possession', 'Mary', 'Roff', 'girl', 'same', 'town', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'decade', 'earlier', 'What', 'story', 'so', 'powerful', 'fact', 'possessed', 'girl', 'convinced', 'Mary', '8217', 'parents', 'was', 'dead', 'child', 'demonstrating', 'remarkable', 'knowledge', 'Mary', '8217', 's', 'life', 'connections', 'even', 'distant', 'relatives', 'type', 'story', 'not', 'unknown', 'who', 'believe', 'reincarnation', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'Lurancy', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Mary', 'died.So', 'have', 'compelling', 'case', 'paranormal', 'here', 'one', 'more', 'worthy', 'study', 'investigation', 'problem', 'have', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'who', 'wrote', 'edited', 'directed', 'produced', 'documentary', 'find', 'difficult', 'take', 'Booth', 'brothers', 'seriously', 'investigators', '8211', 'partly', 'always', 'dress', 'like', 'rejects', 'band', 'Poison', 'mostly', 'are', 'basically', 'filmmakers', 'showmen', 'who', 'like', 'use', 'too', 'many', 'fancy', 'technological', 'tricks', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'juice', 'up', 'story', 'opposed', 'letting', 'evidence', 'speak', 'Their', '8220', 'eacute', 'ance', '8221', 'Mary', 'Roff', 'house', 'perfect', 'example', 'style', '8217', 've', 'got', 'psychic', 'sitting', 'there', 'hooked', 'fancy', 'biometric', 'equipment', 'laser', 'display', 'taking', 'place', 'Ovilus', 'responses', 'thrown', 'mix', 'willy-nilly', 'totally', 'devoid', 'context', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', '8217', 's', 'more', 'carnival', 'show', 'serious', 'investigation', 'Elsewhere', 'visual', 'evidence', 'get', 'so', 'excited', 'tends', 'consist', 'images', 'can', '8217', 't', 'make', 'out', 'do', 'catch', 'one', 'intriguing', 'image', 'case', 'how', 'do', 'capture', 'so', 'many', 'clear', 'EVPs', 'Heck', 'capture', 'one', 'hundred', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'old', 'Mary', 'Roff', 'house', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'isn', '8217', 'even', 'reputed', 'be', 'end', 'think', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching', '8217', 'not', 'convinced', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'added', 'anything', 'story', 'more', 'capable', 'standing', 'own', '8217', 're', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'do', 'suggest', 'read', 'up', '8211', '8217', 'fascinating']",The Possessed

Anderson,"[7, 10]","I usually will buy a DVD like this and just be bored to tears with it.Many times these type things tend to be just a repackaged rehash of readily available information. Often you have seen most of it before.This DVD presents the Lurancy Vennum story in a nice change of pace documentary style. It doesn't leave you with the feeling that you just got duped. The film makers have added in the contributing stories of other people, notably all very young, who have had thier own encounters with the supernatural. This just seems to support the overall credibility of the Lurancy Vennum story.If you have an interest in this kind of phenomena you cannot go wrong having this in your DVD library.It can add considerably to your knowledge base and also make you think hard about your current beliefs on the afterlife. Some of the EVP's featured in this program, if genuine, are genuinely creepy and disturbing.Recommended.",5,Surprisingly different ; Very Creepy,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,916,"['usually', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'just', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'it.Many', 'times', 'type', 'things', 'tend', 'be', 'just', 'repackaged', 'rehash', 'readily', 'available', 'information', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'DVD', 'Lurancy', 'Vennum', 'story', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'documentary', 'style', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'just', 'got', 'duped', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'added', 'contributing', 'stories', 'other', 'people', 'notably', 'very', 'young', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'thier', 'own', 'encounters', 'supernatural', 'just', 'support', 'overall', 'credibility', 'Lurancy', 'Vennum', 'story.If', 'have', 'interest', 'kind', 'phenomena', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'having', 'DVD', 'library.It', 'can', 'add', 'considerably', 'knowledge', 'base', 'also', 'make', 'think', 'hard', 'current', 'beliefs', 'afterlife', 'EVP', 'featured', 'program', 'genuine', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'disturbing.Recommended']",The Possessed
