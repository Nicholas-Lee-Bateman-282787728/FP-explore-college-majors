177678,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,155526493X,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[24, 28]","Based on Russell Janey's novel, the Ben Hecht/Quentin Reynolds script for this film is sometimes sappy and often uneven, but it's also a nice sentimental story, told in flashback, by William Dunnigan (played in a somber manner by Fred McMurray), a press agent who was never a very happy guy, and is burying the woman he loved (but was never able to tell her so).The real reason to watch this film is to see Alida Valli play Joan of Arc, in a &quot;film within a film&quot; segment. She is luminous and incredibly beautiful, and would have made a terrific Joan. Coincidentally, the lavish &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; production starring Ingrid Bergman was released the same year as this film.Another reason to view &quot;The Miracle of the Bells&quot; is to see Frank Sinatra, skinny as a rail, in the unlikely part of a soft spoken priest; this was five years before his success in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, and he is surprisingly good, but far from great. He sings &quot;Ever Homeward&quot;, a cappella, as he sits among the grave stones; there's a lot of gloomy aspects to the film, one of them being that the setting is a poor coal mining town...though it all has a nice pay-off.Lee J. Cobb is Marcus Harris, the film producer making &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, and he has the humorous moment in the film with his &quot;I won't stand for any press agent miracles !&quot; rant, which was funny enough to make me laugh out loud, a rarity for me.Some might say it's improbable that headlines of &quot;Nation Mourns For Movie Star&quot; could ever happen, especially when the &quot;movie star&quot; is unknown, but seeing how today's media obsesses about inconsequential stories, and runs with them for days (nay, weeks !) on end, on a slow news cycle, anything could happen.Total running time is 120 minutes.",4,"like molasses, a little slow but very sweet",1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,1810,"['Based', 'Russell', 'Janey', 'novel', 'Ben', 'Hecht/Quentin', 'Reynolds', 'script', 'film', 'sometimes', 'sappy', 'often', 'uneven', 'also', 'nice', 'sentimental', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'William', 'Dunnigan', 'played', 'somber', 'manner', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'press', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'happy', 'guy', 'burying', 'woman', 'loved', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'tell', 'so', '.The', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'play', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'quot', 'film', 'film', 'quot', 'segment', 'luminous', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'terrific', 'Joan', 'Coincidentally', 'lavish', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'quot', 'production', 'starring', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'reason', 'view', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Bells', 'quot', 'see', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'skinny', 'rail', 'unlikely', 'part', 'soft', 'spoken', 'priest', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'success', 'quot', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'quot', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'far', 'great', 'quot', 'Ever', 'Homeward', 'quot', 'cappella', 'grave', 'stones', 'lot', 'gloomy', 'aspects', 'film', 'one', 'being', 'setting', 'poor', 'coal', 'mining', 'town', 'nice', 'pay-off.Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Marcus', 'Harris', 'film', 'producer', 'making', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'quot', 'humorous', 'moment', 'film', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'press', 'agent', 'miracles', 'quot', 'rant', 'was', 'funny', 'enough', 'make', 'loud', 'rarity', 'me.Some', 'might', 'say', 'improbable', 'headlines', 'quot', 'Nation', 'Mourns', 'Movie', 'Star', 'quot', 'could', 'ever', 'happen', 'especially', 'when', 'quot', 'movie', 'star', 'quot', 'unknown', 'seeing', 'how', 'today', 'media', 'inconsequential', 'stories', 'days', 'nay', 'weeks', 'end', 'slow', 'news', 'cycle', 'anything', 'could', 'happen.Total', 'running', 'time', '120', 'minutes']",N/A
