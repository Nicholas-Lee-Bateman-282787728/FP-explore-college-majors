The actress who played Lady Dona St. Columb (Tara Fitzgerald) was somebody I had never heard of at that point.Well, I instantly enjoyed this version and was so thrilled that it has been filmed where it should have been filmed in the first place: in Cornwall where all those fascinating stories of Daphne DuMaurier take place.Of course the 1944 version could not have been filmed in Cornwall as WW II was going on, but it always bothered me to see the Californian coastline which is very different from Cornwall's coast.I wish somebody would finally make a movie from ""The House on the Strand"" (my favorite DuMaurier novel).",5,My Favorite Version,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,894,"['Many', 'times', 'watched', '1944', 'version', 'o.k.', 'not', 'great', 'compared', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Amber', 'D', 'eacute', 'eacute', '.A', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'discovered', 'delight', 'Netflix', 'remake', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'son', 'Anthony', 'Delon', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Lady', 'Dona', 'St.', 'Columb', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'was', 'somebody', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'point.Well', 'instantly', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'been', 'filmed', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'first', 'place', 'Cornwall', 'where', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'Daphne', 'DuMaurier', 'take', 'place.Of', 'course', '1944', 'version', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'Cornwall', 'WW', 'II', 'was', 'going', 'always', 'bothered', 'see', 'Californian', 'coastline', 'very', 'different', 'Cornwall', 'coast.I', 'wish', 'somebody', 'would', 'finally', 'make', 'movie', 'House', 'Strand', 'favorite', 'DuMaurier', 'novel']",N/A

583935,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00005JHCD,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[37, 38]","Tara Fitzgerald makes a lovely Dona and Anthony Delon portrays the Frenchman pirate of the title, Jean Aubery, to perfection.  In fact all the players were selected admirably: Rockingham is disturbingly sly and manipulative, William combines the right combination of sex appeal with devoted servitude and Harry exudes vulnerability and inner strength as Dona's husband.  Just like Du Maurier intended them to be, fleshed out from the pages of her novel and set on the lonely wild coast of Cornwall.My main objection to this film, if it can be called an objection, is that it fails to tell the story of the novel.  Yes, the characters are not changed and the local is the same.  What differs is the setting--this story is driven by the religious revolution of 1688--Catholic King James has fled to France as Protestant William of Orange marches in from the Netherlands.  Lady Dona is a Catholic fleeing the eventual destruction of the court of which she is alligned.  France has declared war on England at this crucial time and so the pirate is, in a sense doing his duty, rather than ravaging the English coast simply for his own amusement as he does in the novel.  Navaronne, Lady Dona's estate is not the idyllic refuge of the book, it too has transformed into a battle ground where corpses litter the roads patrolled by befeathered Orangeman troops.There are far too many differences in this film version to comment on individually, so instead I will say that it simply does not faithfully adhere to the story told in the novel.  The adventure and romance remains, but even this is twisted to appeal to a more modern day audience. Most disturbing was the addition of tension between Dona and her young daughter which unfortunately weaves its way into the dinner scene at the film's climax.  The producers most likely and sadly felt that the notion of a woman wanting to escape the life she thought at one time satisfying not meaningful enough for audiences who expect the Lifetime Channel's grander causes.  There is none of the frivolity that makes Du Maurier's work a delightful escape albeit with a philosophical tone.Despite its plot differences, the film still entertains.  Lady Dona remains a free spirit encumbered by her station in life.  As much as I enjoyed Anthony Devon's Jean,I would have liked to have seen what he would have brought to the man-without-a-cause depicted in the book.  Whether this is how Du Maurier intended Frenchman's Creek to flow, the film provides an enjoyable two hours of entertainment.",4,"Du Maurier's Characters, But Plot Driven by Religion",1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,2526,"['Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'lovely', 'Dona', 'Anthony', 'Delon', 'Frenchman', 'pirate', 'title', 'Jean', 'Aubery', 'perfection', 'fact', 'players', 'were', 'selected', 'admirably', 'Rockingham', 'disturbingly', 'sly', 'manipulative', 'William', 'right', 'combination', 'sex', 'appeal', 'devoted', 'servitude', 'Harry', 'vulnerability', 'inner', 'strength', 'Dona', 'husband', 'Just', 'Du', 'Maurier', 'intended', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'pages', 'novel', 'set', 'lonely', 'wild', 'coast', 'Cornwall.My', 'main', 'objection', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'objection', 'tell', 'story', 'novel', 'Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'changed', 'local', 'same', 'What', 'setting', 'story', 'driven', 'religious', 'revolution', '1688', 'Catholic', 'King', 'James', 'fled', 'France', 'Protestant', 'William', 'Orange', 'marches', 'Netherlands', 'Lady', 'Dona', 'Catholic', 'fleeing', 'eventual', 'destruction', 'court', 'alligned', 'France', 'declared', 'war', 'England', 'crucial', 'time', 'so', 'pirate', 'sense', 'doing', 'duty', 'rather', 'ravaging', 'English', 'coast', 'simply', 'own', 'amusement', 'novel', 'Navaronne', 'Lady', 'Dona', 'estate', 'not', 'idyllic', 'refuge', 'book', 'too', 'transformed', 'battle', 'ground', 'where', 'litter', 'roads', 'patrolled', 'befeathered', 'Orangeman', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'differences', 'film', 'version', 'comment', 'individually', 'instead', 'will', 'say', 'simply', 'not', 'faithfully', 'adhere', 'story', 'told', 'novel', 'adventure', 'romance', 'remains', 'even', 'twisted', 'appeal', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'audience', 'Most', 'disturbing', 'was', 'addition', 'tension', 'Dona', 'young', 'daughter', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'dinner', 'scene', 'film', 'climax', 'producers', 'most', 'likely', 'sadly', 'felt', 'notion', 'woman', 'wanting', 'escape', 'life', 'thought', 'one', 'time', 'satisfying', 'not', 'meaningful', 'enough', 'audiences', 'who', 'expect', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'grander', 'none', 'frivolity', 'Du', 'Maurier', 'work', 'delightful', 'escape', 'philosophical', 'tone.Despite', 'plot', 'differences', 'film', 'still', 'Lady', 'Dona', 'free', 'spirit', 'encumbered', 'station', 'life', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Anthony', 'Devon', 'Jean', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'man-without-a-cause', 'depicted', 'book', 'how', 'Du', 'Maurier', 'intended', 'Frenchman', 'Creek', 'flow', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment']",N/A

Here she encounters a mysterious & dashing French pirate.  Now she must decide whether to follow her heart that yearns for adventure & the love of a dashing pirate or her head, which is telling her to follow her Catholic morals & stay with her (foolish) husband. This story briefly touches on the struggle of the time between Catholics & Protestants in England.  Be ready to encounter adventure, love, drama, ships, pirates, etc.!!!For those of you worried about content, be aware that there is a violent scene of fighting & an attempted rape towards the end: there is also a love scene that lasts a few seconds or so, earlier in the film.  The lead character is struggling with morality & her faith (Catholic), versus the excitement of adventure & forbidden love, so her choices are not always moral, although there does seem to be somewhat of a balance in the end.  This is set during a tumultous period in England where the Catholic & Protestant factions are in turmoil, mostly due to the changes in the royal ruler (from Catholic to Protestant & back again)...All in all, this movie is a well-done, entertaining & romantic swashbuckler of a film!
