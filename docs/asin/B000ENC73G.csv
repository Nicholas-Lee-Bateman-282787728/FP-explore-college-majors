974791,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000ENC73G,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","This French film 2004 tells the story of a unique relationship between two women involved with the same man, one experience is through fantasy, another for reality.Bernard (Gerard Depardieu) is  married  to a gynecologist Katherine (Fanny Ardant).  The 25 year marriage has drifted, lacking sexual and/or intimate times.  They have drifted apart and occasionally he cheats on the side.  They both admit that the marriage is going sour and after all those souring years Katherine decides to find out what does turn him on, what pleasures does he enjoy.She wanders to a gentlemen's club and meets Nathalie (Emmanuelle Beart) a strikingly beautiful prostitute.  Katherine propositions Nathalie to entice and seduce her husband, and report the experience back to her.  Katherine pays the prostitute.  The two women often meet at the gentlemen's club and Katherine learns and lives her sexual fantasy through Nathalie's experiences which include sexually graphic language.Much of the action takes place at the home of Katherine but also at the beautiful gentlemen's club.  Depardieu's role is supporting and takes a backseat to Ardant's and Beart's major roles.  The pacing is even and watching this, it keeps one wondering what the next step will be for the three characters involved.Director Anne Fontaine's filmography includes extensive roles as an actor, writer, and director.  We see Fontaine at work in a short feature piece for the Making of  Nathalie.The French film made in 2004 is now a remakeChloe2009 that stars Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore.  ......Rizzo",4,All the horny details !,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1564,"['French', 'film', '2004', 'story', 'unique', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'involved', 'same', 'man', 'one', 'experience', 'fantasy', 'reality.Bernard', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'married', 'gynecologist', 'Katherine', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', '25', 'year', 'marriage', 'drifted', 'lacking', 'sexual', 'and/or', 'intimate', 'times', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'occasionally', 'side', 'admit', 'marriage', 'going', 'sour', 'souring', 'years', 'Katherine', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'turn', 'what', 'enjoy.She', 'wanders', 'gentlemen', 'club', 'meets', 'Nathalie', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'prostitute', 'Katherine', 'propositions', 'Nathalie', 'entice', 'seduce', 'husband', 'report', 'experience', 'back', 'Katherine', 'prostitute', 'two', 'women', 'often', 'meet', 'gentlemen', 'club', 'Katherine', 'learns', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'Nathalie', 'experiences', 'include', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'language.Much', 'action', 'place', 'home', 'Katherine', 'also', 'beautiful', 'gentlemen', 'club', 'Depardieu', 'role', 'supporting', 'backseat', 'Ardant', 'Beart', 'major', 'roles', 'pacing', 'even', 'watching', 'one', 'wondering', 'what', 'next', 'step', 'will', 'be', 'three', 'characters', 'involved.Director', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'filmography', 'extensive', 'roles', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'see', 'Fontaine', 'work', 'short', 'feature', 'piece', 'Making', 'Nathalie.The', 'French', 'film', 'made', '2004', 'now', 'remakeChloe2009', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Rizzo']",N/A
974792,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000ENC73G,Dennis Littrell,"[0, 0]","Fanny Ardant plays Catherine, a gynecologist of a certain age, who discovers that her husband Benard (Gerard Depardieu) is cheating on her.  She wonders if this is a onetime thing or something he does regularly.  So she hires a prostitute (Emmanuelle Beart as Marlene/Nathalie) to test him.  When the test turns up positive, Catherine wants to hear the intimate details which Marlene agreeably supplies.The details of exactly what they do would seem a bit hard to take for the spouse who is being cheated on, and Catherine does find some of the descriptions unsavory.  However she insists on hearing them.  The viewer begins to wonder if Catherine is not being sexually aroused by these details (which is what Marlene thinks) or is of a masochistic frame of mind.As Catherine and Marlene draw closer together the viewer now begins to wonder if Catherine herself would like to have a sexual relationship with Marlene.  Since a lot of the tension in the movie relies on just what it is that Catherine wants, I won't reveal the answer.  She claims to love her husband but as the details get seamier and seamier she decides she no longer knows whether she loves him or not.How this will resolve itself is what kept me watching.  The ending is a bit of a surprise.  See if you can guess it.Ardant is excellent, although her long suffering face may become a bit tedious for some.  Beart is very good as a skillful and opportunistic prostitute, almost too good perhaps because I found her a bit creepy.  She was 40-years-old when this was released and there is nary a line on her face.  Ardant's look was natural and, for me anyway, more agreeable.  Both women are of course two of the most celebrated stars of the French cinema as is Depardieu, whose part is rather modest.  Anne Fontaine's direction is clear and focused.While not your typical ""chick flick""--certainly it is not like American chick flick faire--this is nonetheless very much a woman's point of view movie with the kind of agreeable ending that will please most viewers regardless of sex.Best line and typical of the kind of psychology presented is this from Catherine as she is talking to Marlene: ""Jealousy.  For men it's a reflex.""See this for Fanny Ardant who has that Catherine Deneuve quality of growing more beautiful as she gets older, a talented actress who always carries herself well.",4,French style chick flick with some depth and surprises,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,2356,"['Fanny', 'Ardant', 'Catherine', 'gynecologist', 'certain', 'age', 'who', 'husband', 'Benard', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'cheating', 'onetime', 'thing', 'something', 'regularly', 'prostitute', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'Marlene/Nathalie', 'test', 'When', 'test', 'up', 'positive', 'Catherine', 'hear', 'intimate', 'details', 'Marlene', 'agreeably', 'supplies.The', 'details', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'would', 'seem', 'bit', 'hard', 'take', 'spouse', 'who', 'being', 'cheated', 'Catherine', 'find', 'descriptions', 'unsavory', 'However', 'hearing', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'Catherine', 'not', 'being', 'sexually', 'aroused', 'details', 'what', 'Marlene', 'masochistic', 'frame', 'mind.As', 'Catherine', 'Marlene', 'draw', 'closer', 'together', 'viewer', 'now', 'wonder', 'Catherine', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Marlene', 'lot', 'tension', 'movie', 'just', 'what', 'Catherine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'answer', 'love', 'husband', 'details', 'get', 'seamier', 'seamier', 'no', 'longer', 'not.How', 'will', 'resolve', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'ending', 'bit', 'surprise', 'See', 'can', 'guess', 'it.Ardant', 'excellent', 'long', 'suffering', 'face', 'may', 'become', 'bit', 'tedious', 'Beart', 'very', 'good', 'skillful', 'opportunistic', 'prostitute', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'perhaps', 'found', 'bit', 'creepy', 'was', '40-years-old', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'nary', 'line', 'face', 'Ardant', 'look', 'was', 'natural', 'anyway', 'more', 'agreeable', 'women', 'are', 'course', 'two', 'most', 'celebrated', 'stars', 'French', 'cinema', 'Depardieu', 'part', 'rather', 'modest', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'direction', 'clear', 'focused.While', 'not', 'typical', 'chick', 'flick', 'certainly', 'not', 'like', 'American', 'chick', 'flick', 'faire', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'much', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'kind', 'agreeable', 'ending', 'will', 'please', 'most', 'viewers', 'regardless', 'sex.Best', 'line', 'typical', 'kind', 'psychology', 'presented', 'Catherine', 'talking', 'Marlene', 'Jealousy', 'men', 'reflex', 'See', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'who', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'quality', 'growing', 'more', 'beautiful', 'older', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'well']",N/A
974793,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B000ENC73G,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[2, 3]","The main thing that kept me watching this movie was the two female leads: both very French, very elegant and sexy and alluring in that distinctive French way...and of course, very neurotic and opaque in that distinctive French way.Gerard Depardieu is presented as a highly attractive/desirable man---something I had a very hard time swallowing, as he has a Frankenstein-ish sort of physique and bearing in addition to a monstrous proboscis and kept making me think about the Hunchback of Notre Dame for some reason---who is in a sexless (but, as it turns out, not entirely loveless) marriage with an impeccably genteel doctor who discovers that he's been (gasp!) cheating on her.  She reacts more like an American than a French wife...which is to say, badly.  But then she does something that no prudish American wife would ever dream of doing: she hires a hooker (Emmanuelle Beart, painfully French as usual) to seduce dear hubby and share all the carnal details with her, in a campaign of both voyeurism and masochism.  Along the way the two women form an interesting friendship, with some oblique lesbian overtones.Luckily there are enough plot twists along the way and the ending is surprisingly unpredictable, so the viewer's interest is kept fairly well engaged despite the leisurely (i.e. very French) pacing.  This also made up for some awkward, amateurish and ludicrously unconvincing scenes of Beart wearing bad makeup, tacky lingerie, and doing an atrocious job of pretending to be a sex kitten.3 and 1/2 stars.

974794,A2THA689XM7IPJ,B000ENC73G,floridian321,"[2, 5]","I figured out pretty quickly (as did most people, I imagine) that the hooker (Beart) hired by the wife (Ardan) to service her husband (Depardieu) was describing sexual encounters that never occurred.  The movie owns up to this fact rather late in the story and makes that a key plot point, which fell flat on me because it told me what I already knew.Far better for the movie to have gone boldly where Maupassant took the story and show a love affair developing between Beart and Ardan, I mean way beyond the sly hints we get, and then have the husband find out and show how he reacts to the event.  Does he fight to get his wife back?  Does he do something violent?  Does he throw in the towel and move on with his life?  Does he throw himself into the river (as in M's story)?  All these are far more interesting options than the one chosen.  If M could write a love story between two beautiful women in mid-19th century, I should think someone could do that today.  Okay, maybe not as well because M was a master story teller and his command of French prose was way beyond what a screenwriter could do.  Still, opportunity missed.By the way, the sleazy DVD cover is misleading.  Beart handles her portrayal of a ""belle de jour"" with restraint.

974795,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ENC73G,Grady Harp,"[10, 12]","The French have a way with steamy films that makes the rest of the cinematic world seem bland in comparison.  NATHALIE is fine case in point.  Based on an idea by Philippe Blasband and transformed into a superb screenplay by Jacques Fieschi, Franois-Olivier Rousseau and the director Anne Fontaine, this incredibly well acted, subtle, understated film explores the many facets of adultery - from the woman's point of view.  The result is a suspenseful, erotic, intelligent film that provides an opportunity for three of France's greatest actors to demonstrate their credentials.Catherine (the still very beautiful and gifted Fanny Ardant) is a gynecologist married to the successful Bernard (G&eacute;rard Depardieu in one of his more subtle roles) and they have a stay-at-home hippy son (Rodolphe Pauly) who goes about his life much the same as his parents: there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship.  The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine suspects Bernard of having affairs, a fact that Bernard very honestly confesses to having: in his eyes the affairs are sexual dalliances that mean nothing.  Catherine is shocked, attempts to gain some support from her insular but worldly mother (a fine Judith Magre) who tells Catherine it is a normal situation in older marriages.Catherine visits a bar, a private club for consignations, and there she meets Marl&egrave;ne (the extraordinary Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) and eventually buys Marl&egrave;ne's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters.  It is agreed that Marl&egrave;ne will be known as 'Nathalie'.  From this point on Catherine and Nathalie meet after Nathalie has encounters with Bernard and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Nathalie for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with bartender  Franois (Wladimir Yordanoff) in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity.Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends.  When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against Bernard to leave him there is a final encounter of the three (Catherine, Bernard, Nathalie) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending to fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story.Ardant is simply radiant as Catherine, playing the role of the victim wife of an adulterous husband with supreme dignity.  Likewise  Depardieu makes his Bernard so understated and profoundly honest that the conclusion in retrospect should have been suspected.  B&eacute;art is at once wholly physical in her prostitute role yet maintains the inner core of a confused woman that keeps us on her side as she does her job.  The production values are all first rate (except for some ragged editing) and the direction of Anne Fontaine is bristling with intrigue and wholly convincing in her development of this strange tale.  Despite the dialogue being X-rated there is very little actual sex in this film: that makes it not only more powerful but as the ending is revealed adds to the solidity of the story.  In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended for art film lovers.

In the hands of a typical American screenwriter and director, this story of a woman who discovers that her husband has been cheating on her usually would have taken one of two paths: either the wife would have tried (succssfully or unsuccessfully) to take bloody revenge on the husband (and perhaps on the current mistress as well) or the husband would have contritely gone back to the wife and the current mistress would have tried (successfully or unsuccessfully) to take bloody revenge on her ex-lover (and perhaps on his family as well). In the hands of French director Anne Fontaine the story becomes an absorbing psychological study of two women who forge an unlikely and sometimes uneasy bond, as well as a study about a marriage that has gone stale. Neither approach is necessarily the correct one - let the viewer decide what he or she is in the mood for. The three leads are all excellent, with Fanny Ardent taking top honors. Much of the time all she is doing is listening, but her face is so expressive that there is no doubt about the emotions she is feeling. The film is certainly not a mystery, yet it is never at all obvious where it is heading, and while the ending is not necessarily a surprise, it is also not necessarily expected. Yes, the film is a bit slow in spots, but that is because it substitutes character development for action, forcing the viewer to think about and assimilate what is happening, what has happened, and what might happen.

I read a few of the local movie reviews only to find that Chloe is actually a remake of the French film Nathalie.  I was unable to find a copy of this movie anywhere, so I took a chance and ordered from Amazon.  Needless to say, it was not a disappointment.  The idea for the movie was original: a wife with a professional career is concerned that her husband is cheating on her.  She hires a local ""dancer"" (i.e call girl) to try to attract her husband's attention and see if he will be unfaithful.  The wife gets what she is paying for, and soon finds out from ""Nathalie"" what her husband does behind her back.  The movie takes a few twists and turns and the two women seem to form a type of frienship.  How far it actually goes is left up to the viewers imagination.  This is where Nathalie differs from Chloe.  In Chloe the relationship is right there in the viewers face, which is fine, but some may prefer to ponder it for themselves.The film is French with English subtitles and is pretty spicey.  Nothing too taboo, and I think it shows a little less than the naughty American version, Chloe! Emmanuelle Beart is never hard to watch, and Fanny Ardant was wonderful as the paranoid wife.  Gerard Depardieu played the cheating(?!?) husband, and the city of Paris set a pretty background for the whole movie.  All in all, I think it was worth buying the DVD.

974799,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000ENC73G,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[1, 2]","Nathalieis an excellent film with subtle and smart writing and beautiful camera work.  Fanny Ardant displays subtle sophistication in the lead role as Catherine.  Her husband Bernard, played by Gerard Depardieu, has grown distant and unfaithful.  Her insecurity prompts her to commission Marlene, played by Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, to seduce him.  She gives her the pseudonym of ""Nathalie"" and they slowly start to peel back the layers of their relationships and their own psyches.The resulting story is a closely woven series of rendezvous where each of the characters plays off of the emotions of their counterparts.  For the most part, our triangle is never all together save for a few brief moments.  Instead, the dynamic of this film is the one-on-one interactions that they share that reveal how their feelings for one another allow them to be manipulated and hurt.  It's also an exploration of what makes them unwilling to simply let go of their damaging relationships.Watching this film brings to mind the parallels between the love triangle of ""Nathalie"" and the love rectangle ofCloser.  Whereas the storyline in ""Closer"" is more driven by a combination of plot elements and character pathos, ""Nathalie"" is almost entirely focused on the inner torment and psychological games played by and on the central characters.This is a very cerebral and theatrical film.  While ""Closer"" was also written for the stage prior to being made into a film, it has a more traditional plot.  Here, the message is much more complicated and the plot is circuitous.  That does not takes nothing away from the strong character studies that we have in the film.  But the abrupt and questionable conclusion slightly detracts from the story's effectiveness.  I would really love to know how many alternate endings were considered by the film makers before they settled on this one.From a technical standpoint, this film is also worthy of study, with each scene expertly lit and filmed.  Beart in particular is framed beautifully, and I believe symbolically, in her scenes.  Each still is like a painting.  This is an achievement that the director of photography should be applauded for.If you enjoy thoughtful psychological character studies, this film is absolutely worth buying and watching again and again.  Beart, Depardieu and Ardant hold an actor's clinic for us to study and enjoy.  The slow and deliberate plot and somewhat soft conclusion will not satisfy those looking for a more traditional story.  But the creativity and depth of these character is sure to appeal to lovers of acting and French cinema.Enjoy.",4,"Nathalie - Cerebral French Film About Sex, Love And The Human Heart",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,2605,"['Nathalieis', 'excellent', 'film', 'subtle', 'smart', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'work', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'subtle', 'sophistication', 'lead', 'role', 'Catherine', 'husband', 'Bernard', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'grown', 'distant', 'unfaithful', 'insecurity', 'commission', 'Marlene', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'seduce', 'pseudonym', 'Nathalie', 'slowly', 'start', 'peel', 'back', 'layers', 'relationships', 'own', 'psyches.The', 'resulting', 'story', 'closely', 'woven', 'series', 'rendezvous', 'where', 'characters', 'plays', 'emotions', 'counterparts', 'most', 'part', 'triangle', 'never', 'together', 'save', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'Instead', 'dynamic', 'film', 'one-on-one', 'interactions', 'share', 'reveal', 'how', 'feelings', 'one', 'allow', 'be', 'manipulated', 'hurt', 'also', 'exploration', 'what', 'unwilling', 'simply', 'let', 'go', 'damaging', 'relationships.Watching', 'film', 'mind', 'parallels', 'love', 'triangle', 'Nathalie', 'love', 'rectangle', 'ofCloser', 'storyline', 'Closer', 'more', 'driven', 'combination', 'plot', 'elements', 'character', 'pathos', 'Nathalie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'focused', 'inner', 'torment', 'psychological', 'games', 'played', 'central', 'characters.This', 'very', 'cerebral', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Closer', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'stage', 'prior', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'traditional', 'plot', 'Here', 'message', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'plot', 'circuitous', 'not', 'nothing', 'away', 'strong', 'character', 'studies', 'have', 'film', 'abrupt', 'questionable', 'conclusion', 'slightly', 'story', 'effectiveness', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'alternate', 'endings', 'were', 'considered', 'film', 'makers', 'settled', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'also', 'worthy', 'study', 'scene', 'expertly', 'lit', 'filmed', 'Beart', 'particular', 'framed', 'beautifully', 'believe', 'symbolically', 'scenes', 'still', 'painting', 'achievement', 'director', 'photography', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'for.If', 'enjoy', 'thoughtful', 'psychological', 'character', 'studies', 'film', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'buying', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'Beart', 'Depardieu', 'Ardant', 'hold', 'actor', 'clinic', 'study', 'enjoy', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'soft', 'conclusion', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'looking', 'more', 'traditional', 'story', 'creativity', 'depth', 'character', 'sure', 'appeal', 'lovers', 'acting', 'French', 'cinema.Enjoy']",N/A

This movie is focused on the women characters.The story is really about the sexual growth of Catherine as she becomes more obsessed with the erotic details of her husband's affair and her own realization about her inner self. What is so great about Fanny Ardant's performance is that by the end of the movie you become just as fascinated with her on both a human and erotic level as you are with Emmanuelle Beart.

As soon as I saw this stars Fanny Ardant and Gerard Depardieu, that was good enough for me, and I picked it up.&#34;Nathalie...&#34; (2003 release from France; 105 min.) brings the story of a married couple, Catherine (played by Fanny Ardant) and Bernard (played by Gerard Depardieu). As the movie opens, Catherine has organized a surprise birthday party but Bernard misses his connecting flight home. Soon Catherine learns that he spent the evening with another woman instead. Catherine decides to hire a call girl at a private bar, whom she names Nathalie (played by Emmanuelle B&eacute;art). Nathalie is to seduce Bernard and start a relationship with him, and in return Nathalie must report back to Catherine and provide all the details. Nathalie easily picks up Bernard. It is not long thereafter that things begin to change, both as between Catherine and Bernard, and as between Catherine and Nathalie. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Anne Fontaine, who later on would go on to direct &#34;Coco Before Chanel&#34; and last year's disastrous &#34;Adore&#34;/&#34;Perfect Mothers&#34;/&#34;Two Mothers&#34;  (the movie was renamed for different parts of the world). Second, notwithstanding the racy subject matter, there is very little nudity in the movie (2 brief shots), but there is a lot of frank talk about sex, so if that is bothersome to you, do not watch this movie. Third, this movie is an interesting look at love and desire with and outside the bounds of marriage. Catherine hires Nathalie because it is for her the closest way of expressing her desires, really desires by proxy. Fourth, this movie is all about the acting performances. Fanny Ardant is a fantastic actress and she proves that again in this role. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is quite good as well, as is Depardieu who nowadays sadly is just a (much bloated) shadow of his former self. The DVD comes with some bonus materials, including a nice 25 min. &#34;making of&#34; documentary.Bottom line: if you are into conversation-driven French movies, I'd suggest you check this one out.",4,Desire by proxy,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2305,"['was', 'browsing', 'foreign', 'movie', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'something', 'good', 'watch', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'stars', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'picked', 'up.', '34', 'Nathalie', '34', '2003', 'release', 'France', '105', 'min', 'story', 'married', 'couple', 'Catherine', 'played', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'Bernard', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'movie', 'Catherine', 'organized', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'party', 'Bernard', 'connecting', 'flight', 'home', 'Soon', 'Catherine', 'spent', 'evening', 'woman', 'instead', 'Catherine', 'hire', 'call', 'girl', 'private', 'bar', 'whom', 'Nathalie', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'Nathalie', 'seduce', 'Bernard', 'start', 'relationship', 'return', 'Nathalie', 'must', 'report', 'back', 'Catherine', 'provide', 'details', 'Nathalie', 'easily', 'up', 'Bernard', 'not', 'long', 'thereafter', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'Catherine', 'Bernard', 'Catherine', 'Nathalie', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'movie', 'directed', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'who', 'later', 'would', 'go', 'direct', '34', 'Coco', 'Chanel', '34', 'last', 'year', 'disastrous', '34', 'Adore', '34', '/', '34', 'Perfect', 'Mothers', '34', '/', '34', 'Two', 'Mothers', '34', 'movie', 'was', 'renamed', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'Second', 'notwithstanding', 'racy', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'little', 'nudity', 'movie', '2', 'brief', 'shots', 'lot', 'frank', 'talk', 'sex', 'so', 'bothersome', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'Third', 'movie', 'interesting', 'look', 'love', 'desire', 'bounds', 'marriage', 'Catherine', 'Nathalie', 'closest', 'way', 'expressing', 'desires', 'really', 'desires', 'proxy', 'Fourth', 'movie', 'acting', 'performances', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'again', 'role', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Depardieu', 'who', 'sadly', 'just', 'much', 'bloated', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'nice', '25', 'min', '34', 'making', '34', 'documentary.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'conversation-driven', 'French', 'movies', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A
