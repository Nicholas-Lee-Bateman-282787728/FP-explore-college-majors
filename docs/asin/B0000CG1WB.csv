Tia Carrere was wonderful as the college professor who spent more time chasing down lost artifacts than she did in the classroom.While it would have been easy to go too far with a female lead in what would decades ago have surely been a male role, Hawaiin native Carrere always managed to remain feminine while getting the best of others after the same object, or in some cases, Sydney herself. There was a terrific if small supporting cast we came to really like just as much as Sydney.Christien Anholt's character, Nigel Bailey, always brought charm and humor to the role of Sydney Fox's assistant. And Lindy Booth was fabulous as the daffy blonde secretary, Claudia, you loved in spite of her unorthodox mind. Though Booth was missed by fans when she left the show, Tanja Reichert grew into her role as Karen Petrusky, the voluptuous and not so daffy secretary who seemed to have a spark with Nigel.Whether it was caves or jungles or rickety old planes and snakes, it was fun each week to escape for an hour with old and likable friends. It was what television is supposed to be but seldom is anymore. It bordered on camp at times but never crossed the line.While it is true that not everything we fans would like to have been included on this set has been, it is still sweet that it is available at all. While every network show under the sun seems to be released on DVD as of late, many fine syndicated shows such as ""One West Waikiki"" have been completely ignored. We can just be grateful to have a little time with Sydney and the gang thanks to its availability.Those looking for serial and ""B"" movie type adventure will find as much here as they can handle.

Tia Carrere starred as Sydney Fox, history professor and intrepid relic hunter ala Indiana Jones.

To further delight the male viewers there was also plenty of beautiful females populating the screen.

776173,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B0000CG1WB,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[0, 0]","This is basically Indiana Jones made into a TV show, with Tia Carrera in the lead Role.  She's a Professor of Ancient Studies at a university, but spends most of her time flying around the globe and getting into adventures finding lost civilizations, ancient artifacts, etc.  Quite a few episodes have a small supernatural aspect to them, like the artifact is cursed and usually the bad guys become the victims of the curse.  There's always some humor to it, very much in the style of Indiana Jones.  Most of the episodes are fairly interesting, if Indiana Jones gets 5 stars then this show gets 4.  Well, the better episodes certainly deserve a 4, there are of course ones that aren't that great.  It's often a bit too cheesy for it's own good, but I guess that's part of the fun.  Tia is accompanied by her smart but athletically-challenged assistant Nigel, who provides some enjoyable comedy relief.It's too bad we only get 22 episodes, it would have been really nice to have season sets, especially since some of my favorite episodes are missing from this ""best of"" set.  Is anyone really surprised that the first episode on disk one is one of the more uninteresting, cornball episodes of the whole series?  I can't believe they didn't even include the pilot.  Video quality on the DVD's is pretty good, not as good as a big budget movie, but perfectly acceptable for a TV show.  Sound quality is excellent, with good use being made of the surround speakers but the dialogue always comes through nice and clear.  You do get some extras, like an interview with Tia Carrera, another with Christian Anhold (Nigel), a ""making of"" documentary which is okay, and some trailers for about 8 episodes which are quite fun to see.  There are production stills and some stuff about the website, maybe some other stuff I'm forgetting.  The menus are quite fun, like a video game that takes you through dark passageways and into ancient rooms where you select which episode you want to see.Overall, it's a good show, not great, but the production values are very high - it's obvious they spent a lot of money making this TV show - the sets are excellent and you get a new exotic location each week.  The stories are more or less interesting, Tia is sexy and fun and certainly the highlight of the show.  This is a nice DVD set to have on hand for those boring Sunday afternoons when there's nothing on TV except golf and NASCAR racing and old reruns of Frasier.",4,"Fun show, a bit too cheesy at times.",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2451,"['basically', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'Tia', 'Carrera', 'lead', 'Role', 'Professor', 'Ancient', 'Studies', 'university', 'most', 'time', 'flying', 'globe', 'getting', 'adventures', 'finding', 'lost', 'civilizations', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'etc', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'small', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'artifact', 'cursed', 'usually', 'bad', 'guys', 'become', 'victims', 'curse', 'always', 'humor', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '5', 'stars', 'then', 'show', '4', 'Well', 'better', 'episodes', 'certainly', 'deserve', '4', 'are', 'course', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'often', 'bit', 'too', 'cheesy', 'own', 'good', 'guess', 'part', 'fun', 'Tia', 'accompanied', 'smart', 'athletically-challenged', 'assistant', 'Nigel', 'who', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'relief.It', 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'get', '22', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'nice', 'have', 'season', 'sets', 'especially', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'missing', 'best', 'set', 'anyone', 'really', 'surprised', 'first', 'episode', 'disk', 'one', 'one', 'more', 'uninteresting', 'cornball', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'pilot', 'Video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'TV', 'show', 'Sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'good', 'use', 'being', 'made', 'surround', 'speakers', 'dialogue', 'always', 'nice', 'clear', 'do', 'get', 'extras', 'interview', 'Tia', 'Carrera', 'Christian', 'Anhold', 'Nigel', 'making', 'documentary', 'okay', 'trailers', 'about', '8', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'fun', 'see', 'are', 'production', 'stills', 'stuff', 'website', 'maybe', 'other', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'forgetting', 'menus', 'are', 'quite', 'fun', 'video', 'game', 'dark', 'passageways', 'ancient', 'rooms', 'where', 'select', 'episode', 'want', 'see.Overall', 'good', 'show', 'not', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'obvious', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'making', 'TV', 'show', 'sets', 'are', 'excellent', 'get', 'new', 'exotic', 'location', 'week', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'interesting', 'Tia', 'sexy', 'fun', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'show', 'nice', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'hand', 'boring', 'Sunday', 'afternoons', 'when', 'nothing', 'TV', 'golf', 'NASCAR', 'racing', 'old', 'reruns', 'Frasier']",N/A

The reason for the cancellation was directley from Tia Carrere herself.  Making the series was so intense it was like filming a movie every week.  This took a toll on Tia.  The other reason rummered for leaving the show was that she was nearing the age of 35.  She felt her biological clock was running out; it was time to get married and have a family.

776180,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000CG1WB,trebe,"[28, 28]","In production for three seasons from 1999 through 2002, the syndicated television program Relic Hunter features Tia Carrere as Sydney Fox, an archeology professor with a big appetite for adventure.  The college instructor, along with her intrepid assistant Nigel Bailey (Christien Anholt), boldly traverse the globe, uncovering mysteries and seeking lost artifacts.  This ""best of"" compilation of contains a selection of 22 episodes from the 44 produced during the first two seasons.Relic Hunter is light-hearted adventure, that doesn't take things too seriously.  Do not expect rigid scientific or historical accuracy.  Often just a thread of historical fact is taken, and woven into a modern day adventure.  Once the quest has begun, each episode unfolds in mostly formulaic fashion, taking twists and turns that while not always logical, are frequently exciting, often humorous, and just plain fun.  Lots of action, and in the end usually nobody gets hurt too badly.Tia Carrere has the charisma and presence to make her credible as a female Indiana Jones.  She's athletic, intelligent and sexy.  Trained in martial arts, she takes on physically demanding tasks with enthusiasm, and looks damn good doing so.The complementary relationship between the two leads helps makes this drama a success.  While Ms. Fox is definitely a woman of action, Nigel Bailey is more demure.  The show's producers were looking for a ""Hugh Grant"" type, and with Mr. Anholt they got exactly that.  His character, while far from physically commanding, has other strengths, and is a hardy and loyal companion.  Clearly recognizing his limitations, he leaves the bulk of the fighting to Sydney, but when it comes to translating some obscure language, Nigel is definitely your man.  Together they make an unusual team that is a blast to tag along with.  Providing support from their academic home base, is Lindy Booth who plays Claudia, Professor Fox's perky and quirky secretary.The presentation is fullscreen, and picture quality is average for a television production, with a lot of grain and distortion at times.  The five disc set, has five episodes per disc, except for the fifth, which only has just two, plus some bonus material.  The extras include interviews with stars Tia Carrere and Christien Anholt, a making of featurette, and a photo gallery.  Not outstanding, but still better than nothing. For reasons of character development, and continuity of appearance, it might have been better to present the episodes in chronological order, rather than the grouping chosen.Though a bit formulamatic, the PG13 rated exploits of Professor Fox and Nigel are very entertaining for what they are.  Full of excitement and adventure, set in a variety of exotic locations, featuring some pretty decent sets, these programs hold up well to repeated viewings.  For TV action and adventure fans, this set deserves your consideration.",4,Ancient Studies . . .,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2907,"['production', 'three', 'seasons', '1999', '2002', 'syndicated', 'television', 'program', 'Relic', 'Hunter', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'Sydney', 'Fox', 'archeology', 'professor', 'big', 'appetite', 'adventure', 'college', 'instructor', 'intrepid', 'assistant', 'Nigel', 'Bailey', 'Christien', 'Anholt', 'boldly', 'globe', 'uncovering', 'mysteries', 'seeking', 'lost', 'artifacts', 'best', 'compilation', 'contains', 'selection', '22', 'episodes', '44', 'produced', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.Relic', 'Hunter', 'light-hearted', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'take', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'rigid', 'scientific', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Often', 'just', 'thread', 'historical', 'fact', 'taken', 'woven', 'modern', 'day', 'adventure', 'quest', 'begun', 'episode', 'unfolds', 'mostly', 'formulaic', 'fashion', 'taking', 'twists', 'turns', 'not', 'always', 'logical', 'are', 'frequently', 'exciting', 'often', 'humorous', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'Lots', 'action', 'end', 'usually', 'nobody', 'hurt', 'too', 'badly.Tia', 'Carrere', 'charisma', 'presence', 'make', 'credible', 'female', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'athletic', 'intelligent', 'sexy', 'Trained', 'martial', 'arts', 'physically', 'demanding', 'tasks', 'enthusiasm', 'damn', 'good', 'doing', 'so.The', 'complementary', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'drama', 'success', 'Ms.', 'Fox', 'definitely', 'woman', 'action', 'Nigel', 'Bailey', 'more', 'demure', 'show', 'producers', 'were', 'looking', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'type', 'Mr.', 'Anholt', 'got', 'exactly', 'character', 'far', 'physically', 'commanding', 'other', 'strengths', 'hardy', 'loyal', 'companion', 'Clearly', 'recognizing', 'limitations', 'bulk', 'fighting', 'Sydney', 'when', 'translating', 'obscure', 'language', 'Nigel', 'definitely', 'man', 'Together', 'make', 'unusual', 'team', 'blast', 'tag', 'Providing', 'support', 'academic', 'home', 'base', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'who', 'Claudia', 'Professor', 'Fox', 'perky', 'quirky', 'secretary.The', 'presentation', 'fullscreen', 'picture', 'quality', 'average', 'television', 'production', 'lot', 'grain', 'distortion', 'times', 'five', 'disc', 'set', 'five', 'episodes', 'disc', 'fifth', 'only', 'just', 'two', 'bonus', 'material', 'extras', 'include', 'interviews', 'stars', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'Christien', 'Anholt', 'making', 'featurette', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Not', 'outstanding', 'still', 'better', 'nothing', 'reasons', 'character', 'development', 'continuity', 'appearance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'present', 'episodes', 'chronological', 'order', 'rather', 'grouping', 'chosen.Though', 'bit', 'formulamatic', 'PG13', 'rated', 'exploits', 'Professor', 'Fox', 'Nigel', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'what', 'are', 'Full', 'excitement', 'adventure', 'set', 'variety', 'exotic', 'locations', 'featuring', 'pretty', 'decent', 'sets', 'programs', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'TV', 'action', 'adventure', 'fans', 'set', 'consideration']",N/A
