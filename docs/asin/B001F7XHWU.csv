1188141,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B001F7XHWU,Andrew Raker,"[22, 22]","""The Pistol: The Birth of a Legend"" (1990) is a very inspirational film. When I was a child, my parents purchased the film on VHS. I thought the film was moderately interesting yet nothing spectacular.Now that I am an adult, I see the film differently. Certainly, there are many scenes were people simply talk with one another - the amount of basketball played might take up 20 minutes of the film. However, the theme of the film is about following your dreams (and yes, certainly there are many other films with this same theme). Yet, ""The Pistol"" is persuasive to me because Pete Maravich actually WAS able to fulfill his dream ""of becoming the greatest college basketball player ever."" It is not a fictional story created to make people feel good about themselves. Maravich is still the all-time leading NCAA Division I scorer with 3,667 points scored and an average of 44.2 points per game. (Note: Maravich accomplished this without the benefit of a three-point line and despite the fact that NCAA rules prohibited him from playing on the varsity team as a freshman.)But enough with the statistics - the point is that many people did not believe that someone as small in stature as Pete Maravich was in junior high (as least as was portrayed in the film) could become a great basketball player. Yet, as the film shows in many scenes, Pete desired to fulfill his dream - it became his life. Pete's father (a college basketball coach) inspired and encouraged him, yet it was Pete  who gave his countless hours to perfect his skills.In short, ""The Pistol"" is the type of film I want to give to skeptics who believe that ""ability"" alone is what determines how successful a person can become in any area of life. I recommend the film.",5,Very Inspirational/Motivational Film,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1733,"['Pistol', 'Birth', 'Legend', '1990', 'very', 'inspirational', 'film', 'When', 'was', 'child', 'parents', 'purchased', 'film', 'VHS', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'yet', 'nothing', 'spectacular.Now', 'am', 'adult', 'see', 'film', 'differently', 'Certainly', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'people', 'simply', 'talk', 'one', 'amount', 'basketball', 'played', 'might', 'take', 'up', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'However', 'theme', 'film', 'following', 'dreams', 'yes', 'certainly', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'theme', 'Pistol', 'persuasive', 'Pete', 'Maravich', 'actually', 'WAS', 'able', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'college', 'basketball', 'player', 'ever', 'not', 'fictional', 'story', 'created', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'good', 'Maravich', 'still', 'all-time', 'leading', 'NCAA', 'Division', 'scorer', '3,667', 'points', 'scored', 'average', '44.2', 'points', 'game', 'Note', 'Maravich', 'accomplished', 'benefit', 'three-point', 'line', 'fact', 'NCAA', 'rules', 'prohibited', 'playing', 'varsity', 'team', 'freshman', 'enough', 'statistics', 'point', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'someone', 'small', 'stature', 'Pete', 'Maravich', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'as', 'least', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'could', 'become', 'great', 'basketball', 'player', 'Yet', 'film', 'shows', 'many', 'scenes', 'Pete', 'desired', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'became', 'life', 'Pete', 'father', 'college', 'basketball', 'coach', 'inspired', 'encouraged', 'was', 'Pete', 'who', 'gave', 'countless', 'hours', 'perfect', 'skills.In', 'short', 'Pistol', 'type', 'film', 'want', 'give', 'skeptics', 'who', 'believe', 'ability', 'alone', 'what', 'how', 'successful', 'person', 'can', 'become', 'area', 'life', 'recommend', 'film']",The Pistol

Along Pete's journey in life, there were plenty of people who said he couldn't play against real competition. He loved basketball and with the strong support and coaching of his dad, he became equipped to perform what was considered at the time to be miraculous.  He is still considered one of the best of the best.  There are so many players in the hall of fame who actually had to dribble correctly and not carry or palm the ball in doing so.  The rules or lack of them in the modern game leaves me wanting something more when I see a game nowadays.  I long for the days when people who had honed their skills really put on a show.  That's what Pistol Pete did every time he laced his sneakers.  This movie is an excellent account of his early life, but I wish it had been a little longer so it could show more of his accomplishments as an adult.  He was one a kind.  If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it with two thumbs up.",5,Hard work.... a recipe for achieving any goal!,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,1033,"['movie', 'example', 'how', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'perseverance', 'can', 'pay', 'off', 'big', 'ways', 'Along', 'Pete', 'journey', 'life', 'were', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'real', 'competition', 'loved', 'basketball', 'strong', 'support', 'coaching', 'dad', 'became', 'equipped', 'perform', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'time', 'be', 'miraculous', 'still', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'best', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'players', 'hall', 'fame', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'dribble', 'correctly', 'not', 'carry', 'palm', 'ball', 'doing', 'so', 'rules', 'lack', 'modern', 'game', 'wanting', 'something', 'more', 'when', 'see', 'game', 'nowadays', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'honed', 'skills', 'really', 'put', 'show', 'what', 'Pistol', 'Pete', 'did', 'time', 'laced', 'sneakers', 'movie', 'excellent', 'account', 'early', 'life', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'could', 'show', 'more', 'accomplishments', 'adult', 'was', 'one', 'kind', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'recommend', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up']",The Pistol
1188144,A1DG29RP3FBQ74,B001F7XHWU,J. Norberg,"[6, 7]","This is a story about a very ambitious and confident kid's drive to succeed--in an environment where failure is almost a guarantee. The kid, Pete Maravich, is in 8th grade, and he wants to start on the varsity team! The story is well done and quite entertaining, and I've enjoyed this film since I was a kid.This movie would definitely fall into the ""cheesy sports movie"" class except for one thing--it's a true story! Of course, One must always take a true story from Hollywood with a grain of salt, but I think it can be mostly trusted. I, for one, like ""cheesy"" when it happens to be true. (Disney's ""The Rookie"" comes to mind.)The biggest flaw with the movie is the acting. The movie at times appears to be a very low budget film. In fact, I'm sure it was a low budget film. But here's the thing, it's a sports story about one of the all-time basketball legends, and if you let the story grab you, you can overlook the acting. I know some people simple cannot stomach a movie that looks anything less than a blockbuster. If that's you, stay away from this. But if you can overlook flaws in favor of a great story (and you like good sports films) check this out!",5,Cheesy... and irresistable!!,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,1165,"['story', 'very', 'ambitious', 'confident', 'kid', 'drive', 'succeed', 'environment', 'where', 'failure', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'kid', 'Pete', 'Maravich', '8th', 'grade', 'start', 'varsity', 'team', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'kid.This', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'fall', 'cheesy', 'sports', 'movie', 'class', 'one', 'thing', 'true', 'story', 'course', 'must', 'always', 'take', 'true', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'grain', 'salt', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'mostly', 'trusted', 'one', 'cheesy', 'when', 'be', 'true', 'Disney', 'Rookie', 'mind', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'times', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'here', 'thing', 'sports', 'story', 'one', 'all-time', 'basketball', 'legends', 'let', 'story', 'grab', 'can', 'overlook', 'acting', 'know', 'people', 'simple', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'movie', 'anything', 'less', 'blockbuster', 'stay', 'away', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'favor', 'great', 'story', 'like', 'good', 'sports', 'films', 'check', 'out']",The Pistol
1188145,A1FNW6H983I87V,B001F7XHWU,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[0, 0]","Pete Maravich is the greatest scorer in the history of NCAA basketball. Think about it. This is a record that has stood for 40 years AND he did it before the three point rule (he was a guard with many of his shots outside today's three point boundary) AND freshman were not eligible when he played so he did it in three years. He averaged 44 points (charts show it would have been an incredible 57 with the three point rule) per game for three seasons. He also went on to become one of the all time great NBA players and was the youngest ever selected for the Hall of Fame. He was also a pioneer of the free wheeling style of basketball that dominates today. Behind the back passes and between the legs dribbling were unheard of in the white dominated basketball culture. Much more common in the segregated black teams and leagues, it was considered show-boating and hot-dogging in the white culture at that time. But Pete had a Dad, Press Maravich (a great player & coach in his own right), who was also a visionary and saw this as the future of basketball. This film is the story of how a father passed on his dream and vision to his talented and determined son at an early age. The film primarily covers Pete's eighth grade basketball, a coming of age experience, for this young man, both socially and athletically. Too good for his age and not politically correct to beat out the coach's son, he sits on the bench for a good part of the season until an injury puts him in the starting lineup. Basketball would never be the same again. While not a big budget film, nevertheless, it is a very satisfying story of this incredible athlete in this particular stage of his career. Adam Guier, who plays the eighth grade Pete, is no slouch as a basketball talent and makes the basketball scenes very real.

But I gave it 4 stars BECAUSE OF WHAT IT LACKED. The video left we searching the web to find out how he progressed from age 8 to his death in January 1998. This movie could use a sequel telling what he meant by his ""father dyeing at to early an age"". How did he rise to stardom over coming his 5' 2"" (?) height when he started high school and quickly go to first string? Did his dad coaching for LSU get him the scholarship his mother wanted for him? What if his dad was not famous, would he have ever gotten to play first string and develop the stills towards greatness? What about his transition to pro ball. The message seems to tell young viewer you can only make it ""IF YOU HAVE A FAMOUS DAD or sponsor"" and dedicate all of your energies to the detriment of all other things, and must have the undying motivation to win forsaking all NORMAL pressures, needs. and desires. That's likely true but what about those that cannot afford that dedication due to the lack of support and financial environment and a measure of friend, luck, and the contacts for get to play first string. Was his father an abusive pusher and at what cost? The photo at the end of the video showed an older man, very tall, talking to his son, was that Pistol Pete, if so it left we wondering? What was the injection of having a black friend and playing one game(?) with a all black High School have to do with the story? Sorry I missed it, was it only to show he was not a bigot in 1959 and add to his nice guy image? Did he marry his cheerleader girlfriend? I may have missed the answers since I did not purchase the inspirational version. I MUST ADD THAT THE SKILLS DEMONSTRATED BY THE YOUNG ACTOR WERE AMAZING, AND IF YOU COACH BASKETBALL CUT OUT THOSE SECIONS AND DRILL YOUR PLAYERS TO LEARN THOSE SKILLS.",4,Great motivational movie but need a sequel,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,1871,"['Pistol', 'Pete', 'Maravich', 'video', '5', 'stars', 'what', 'how', 'was', 'presented', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'LACKED', 'video', 'left', 'searching', 'web', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'progressed', 'age', '8', 'death', 'January', '1998', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'sequel', 'telling', 'what', 'meant', 'father', 'dyeing', 'early', 'age', 'How', 'did', 'rise', 'stardom', 'over', 'coming', '5', '2', 'height', 'when', 'started', 'high', 'school', 'quickly', 'go', 'first', 'string', 'Did', 'dad', 'coaching', 'LSU', 'get', 'scholarship', 'mother', 'wanted', 'What', 'dad', 'was', 'not', 'famous', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'gotten', 'play', 'first', 'string', 'develop', 'stills', 'greatness', 'What', 'transition', 'pro', 'ball', 'message', 'tell', 'young', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'FAMOUS', 'DAD', 'sponsor', 'dedicate', 'energies', 'detriment', 'other', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'undying', 'motivation', 'win', 'forsaking', 'NORMAL', 'pressures', 'needs', 'desires', 'likely', 'true', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'dedication', 'due', 'lack', 'support', 'financial', 'environment', 'measure', 'friend', 'luck', 'contacts', 'get', 'play', 'first', 'string', 'Was', 'father', 'abusive', 'pusher', 'what', 'cost', 'photo', 'end', 'video', 'showed', 'older', 'man', 'very', 'tall', 'talking', 'son', 'was', 'Pistol', 'Pete', 'left', 'wondering', 'What', 'was', 'injection', 'having', 'black', 'friend', 'playing', 'one', 'game', 'black', 'High', 'School', 'have', 'do', 'story', 'Sorry', 'missed', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'bigot', '1959', 'add', 'nice', 'guy', 'image', 'Did', 'marry', 'cheerleader', 'girlfriend', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'answers', 'did', 'not', 'purchase', 'inspirational', 'version', 'MUST', 'ADD', 'THE', 'SKILLS', 'DEMONSTRATED', 'BY', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'ACTOR', 'WERE', 'AMAZING', 'AND', 'IF', 'YOU', 'COACH', 'BASKETBALL', 'CUT', 'OUT', 'THOSE', 'SECIONS', 'AND', 'DRILL', 'YOUR', 'PLAYERS', 'TO', 'LEARN', 'THOSE', 'SKILLS']",The Pistol
