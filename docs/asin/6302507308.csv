316690,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302507308,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","The Seventies were a great time for American film.  Character and story took precedence over visual effects.  One film that comes to mind is ""Scarecrow"" starring Gene Hackman and Al Pacino.  It concerns a couple wayward souls going on the road to seek their fortune only to be confronted by personal demons.  ""Leaving Normal"" reminds me of that film except the protagonists are women instead of men.  Marianne (Meg Tilly) has a case of wanderlust and is escaping from an abusive marriage.  Darly (Christine Lahti) is a cocktail waitress who is harboring feelings about a tragic decision she made in her youth.  Both want to leave the stifling environment of Normal, Wyoming for the Northern Lights of Alaska to find happiness.  That entails, however, they confront their sins of the past.  This is a terrific somewhat daring film.  Director Edward Zwick challenges the audience to emphasize with flawed, and in the case of Darly somewhat unsympathetic, individuals.  Tilly and Lahti are terrific and Patrika Darbo in a smallish role as a waitress they meet during the course of their journey makes an impact.

Of all the ""buddy"" movies I've seen - especially dealing with women - this one always cut straight to the bone with me. When Meg Tilly, in a moment of trauma, cries out ""Why am I here again?"" referring to her continual missteps in life, it struck such a resonant chord with me. Do we ever feel that we've gotten to the place we're supposed to get to? Apparently, in an absolutely luminous moment, she does, as, looking up at the Northern Lights sometime after that, she responds to a friend asking her why she's happy now, she answers, ""Because I didn't expect anything."" (Or words to that effect.) Her character comes to an epiphany before Christine Lahti's does - but both come to a resolution by the end of the movie. It's like observing two of your most dysfunctional friends from afar - you long to help them, hope they arrive at the right answer, and sit back happy when they do. (I also like Meg's moment in the phone booth when, after a raucous conversation with her former husband, she screams, ""I MARRIED him, what is my problem?"")

I was hoping to find it on DVD, but so far, no luck.Over the years, I have watched this movie whenever possible, enjoying the dialogue, the laughs, the camaraderie between the two primary characters--Mary Anne and Darly, portrayed so effectively by Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti.Lahti's character has that sarcastic, wise-girl persona down pat, with all the wittiness and self-deprecation one can expect from a person who has met more hard knocks than some.  But she keeps on getting up when life knocks her down.  This quality sees her through.Tilly's character, on the other hand, seems naive and gullible, with her low expectations and her persistent wrong choices.  All because she refuses to give up on her dreams.  She CHOOSES to be happy.Two strangers who happen to connect at a low point in each of their lives, they join forces.  They both are trying to escape small-town life in Wyoming, so when Darly offers Mary Anne a ride to Oregon, where her sister lives--which, as Darly points out, is only a ""little"" out of the way in her trek to Alaska--Mary Anne is only too happy to accept.Combining their individual qualities with their perseverance, Mary Anne and Darly persist in their journey until they finally reach their destination...Alaska. (Mary Anne decides against staying with her sister after all).So what happens along the way to cement the bond between the characters?  What disasters do they find when they arrive?  And do these obstacles prevent them from finding their dreams?Discovering the answers to these questions are half the fun in this movie.
