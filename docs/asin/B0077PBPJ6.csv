1527711,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B0077PBPJ6,Charity Bishop,"[29, 35]","England is at war, and Stephen Wraysford (Eddie Redmayne) is on the front lines. In command of a group of enterprising young men digging tunnels in order to get nearer foreign forces, Stephen spends most of his time above ground... until a superior officer (Matthew Goode) tells him to take to the tunnels. His timing could not be worse. Gunfire penetrates the underground shaft, leaving him badly wounded...But conscious to remember a much happier time... when he was employed at a textile factory in France. His employer is the wealthy, older Ren&eacute; Azaire but it is his lovely young wife Isabelle (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) who most attracts Stephen's attention. Quiet and self-contained, she can often be heard weeping at night. Her stepdaughter is not much younger than she is, and is romantically interested in Stephen... but he has eyes only for the beautiful young woman who suffers so much in silence. As their affair unfolds and carries them both into desperate times, the audience travels back and forth between earlier simplicity and later turmoil during wartime. Many films employ this tactic but few accomplish it with as gentle of grace as Birdsong.Though I have not read the book, I understand that certain things, including the style of the narrative, have been changed. Fans debate heatedly over whether or not the cast is appropriate... I found them a lovely couple to watch with natural chemistry that sparks through lingering glances more than passionate love scenes. One could argue that some of these glances are too long, that eyes meeting over dinner or on the river with music dramatically swelling in the background can at times be a bit dull... and yes, it is true that it prolongs things considerably. The photography is glorious and the costuming exquisite. Too bad it misses the point of the novel, by making it seem as if they are in love. The book is about lust. The miniseries transforms it into forbidden love. There is a distinction between the two.From a purely entertainment perspective, the first episode is terrific, and the second is considerably less so, in part because the wartime scenes are tedious and the abrupt nature of how the relationship ends is emotionally unsatisfying (we learn later the reason for her flight, but there is little build-up). Much of the last hour is downright depressing as we watch his friends die in battle, some of them brutally. The first half of this story was solid but in the second half it stumbled and lost its way, most of the tension going right along with it. Stephen cannot carry the story on his own without Isabelle, and she is absent for the most part in the last hour and a half. It needed a stronger narrative style to go with its beautiful costumes and exquisite period setting. But perhaps the most troubling is that neither character learns anything from their misbehavior or feels remorse for their actions. For me, that left the story feeling empty since when stripped of any redeeming value or moral messages, any adulterous love affair just becomes a story of extreme selfishness.Parental Concerns: I presume this is the original, uncut British release that contains graphic sexual content (including oral), and nudity. Some war-related gore (including a man whose insides have been blown out). At least one f-word, a couple of abuses of Jesus' name, and scattered profanities.",3,Gorgeous But Empty,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,3383,"['England', 'war', 'Stephen', 'Wraysford', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'front', 'lines', 'command', 'group', 'enterprising', 'young', 'men', 'digging', 'tunnels', 'order', 'get', 'nearer', 'foreign', 'forces', 'Stephen', 'most', 'time', 'ground', 'superior', 'officer', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'take', 'tunnels', 'timing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'worse', 'Gunfire', 'underground', 'shaft', 'leaving', 'badly', 'wounded', 'conscious', 'remember', 'much', 'happier', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'employed', 'textile', 'factory', 'France', 'employer', 'wealthy', 'older', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Azaire', 'lovely', 'young', 'wife', 'Isabelle', 'Cl', 'eacute', 'mence', 'Po', 'eacute', 'who', 'most', 'attracts', 'Stephen', 'attention', 'Quiet', 'self-contained', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'heard', 'weeping', 'night', 'stepdaughter', 'not', 'much', 'younger', 'romantically', 'interested', 'Stephen', 'eyes', 'only', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'silence', 'affair', 'unfolds', 'desperate', 'times', 'audience', 'back', 'forth', 'earlier', 'simplicity', 'later', 'turmoil', 'wartime', 'Many', 'films', 'employ', 'tactic', 'few', 'accomplish', 'gentle', 'grace', 'Birdsong.Though', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'understand', 'certain', 'things', 'including', 'style', 'narrative', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Fans', 'debate', 'heatedly', 'not', 'cast', 'appropriate', 'found', 'lovely', 'couple', 'watch', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'lingering', 'glances', 'more', 'passionate', 'love', 'scenes', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'glances', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'eyes', 'meeting', 'over', 'dinner', 'river', 'music', 'dramatically', 'swelling', 'background', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'bit', 'dull', 'yes', 'true', 'things', 'considerably', 'photography', 'glorious', 'costuming', 'exquisite', 'Too', 'bad', 'point', 'novel', 'making', 'seem', 'are', 'love', 'book', 'about', 'lust', 'miniseries', 'forbidden', 'love', 'distinction', 'two.From', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'perspective', 'first', 'episode', 'terrific', 'second', 'considerably', 'less', 'so', 'part', 'wartime', 'scenes', 'are', 'tedious', 'abrupt', 'nature', 'how', 'relationship', 'emotionally', 'unsatisfying', 'learn', 'later', 'reason', 'flight', 'little', 'build-up', 'Much', 'last', 'hour', 'downright', 'depressing', 'watch', 'friends', 'die', 'battle', 'brutally', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'was', 'solid', 'second', 'half', 'stumbled', 'lost', 'way', 'most', 'tension', 'going', 'right', 'Stephen', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'story', 'own', 'Isabelle', 'absent', 'most', 'part', 'last', 'hour', 'half', 'needed', 'stronger', 'narrative', 'style', 'go', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'exquisite', 'period', 'setting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'troubling', 'character', 'learns', 'anything', 'misbehavior', 'feels', 'remorse', 'actions', 'left', 'story', 'feeling', 'empty', 'when', 'stripped', 'redeeming', 'value', 'moral', 'messages', 'adulterous', 'love', 'affair', 'just', 'story', 'extreme', 'selfishness.Parental', 'Concerns', 'presume', 'original', 'uncut', 'British', 'release', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'content', 'including', 'oral', 'nudity', 'war-related', 'gore', 'including', 'man', 'insides', 'have', 'been', 'blown', 'out', 'least', 'one', 'f-word', 'couple', 'abuses', 'Jesus', 'name', 'scattered', 'profanities']",N/A
1527712,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B0077PBPJ6,Daniel A. Brown,"[3, 5]","Maybe it was a mistake to view this right after being immersed in ""Downton Abbey"". Same time period. Same Masterpiece Classic presentation. Same Battle of the Somme. But the comparisons end there. As the plot explains, Steven, a young man working for a callous factory owner in France falls in love with Isabelle, the owner's wife. The story jumps back and forth between their illicit tryst in 1910 to the horrors of trench warfare in 1916 where Steven is now a junior officer in the British Army.The initial sequences are what lag the most. Despite the obvious attractiveness of the couple, Steven and Isabelle both seem oddly allergic to words. Instead, there are long loving gazes, long anguished gazes, long questioning gazes. They exchange about ten words between them, half of them inaudible. It is here that one misses the rich conversational wit, compassion and swordplay of ""Downton Abbey"". Isabelle abruptly disappears (we later find out why), Steven is left in torment despite having Isabelle's willing sister, Jeanne at his disposal.The actions picks up during the World War I segments as it is obvious the Brits are still haunted by July 1, 1916, the day they lost 20,000 men in one day during the catastrophic Battle of the Somme. The blasted expanse of No-Man's Land is an exact replica of the one used in both ""Downton Abbey"" and ""War Horse"" which makes you wonder if it is a space specifically rented out for WWI movies. But the scenes of battle are unsparing and horribly graphic. Steven is assigned to a tunneling outfit, the ""Sewer Rats"" and forms a friendship of sorts with Jack Firebrace, a solid workingman who is suffering from the loss of his young son. Jack's poignancy helps mitigate Steven's wallowing self-pity as well as reminding him that love is the only thing that matters, a lesson that Steven will need to utilize to become a full man.Steven and Isabelle reunite briefly during a lull in the fighting but I found myself not caring. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension. I was more intrigued if Steven would man up and take responsibility for those others who have come into his life (I am avoiding spoilers here!).Overall, ""Birdsong"" was a small disappointment, only worth watching if there's nothing else available.",3,A Curious Lack of Chemistry,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2284,"['Maybe', 'was', 'mistake', 'view', 'right', 'being', 'immersed', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Same', 'time', 'period', 'Same', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'presentation', 'Same', 'Battle', 'Somme', 'comparisons', 'end', 'there', 'plot', 'Steven', 'young', 'man', 'working', 'callous', 'factory', 'owner', 'France', 'falls', 'love', 'Isabelle', 'owner', 'wife', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'illicit', 'tryst', '1910', 'horrors', 'trench', 'warfare', '1916', 'where', 'Steven', 'now', 'junior', 'officer', 'British', 'Army.The', 'initial', 'sequences', 'are', 'what', 'lag', 'most', 'obvious', 'attractiveness', 'couple', 'Steven', 'Isabelle', 'seem', 'oddly', 'allergic', 'words', 'Instead', 'are', 'long', 'loving', 'gazes', 'long', 'anguished', 'gazes', 'long', 'questioning', 'gazes', 'exchange', 'ten', 'words', 'half', 'inaudible', 'here', 'one', 'rich', 'conversational', 'wit', 'compassion', 'swordplay', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Isabelle', 'abruptly', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Steven', 'left', 'torment', 'having', 'Isabelle', 'willing', 'sister', 'Jeanne', 'disposal.The', 'actions', 'up', 'World', 'War', 'segments', 'obvious', 'Brits', 'are', 'still', 'haunted', 'July', '1', '1916', 'day', 'lost', '20,000', 'men', 'one', 'day', 'catastrophic', 'Battle', 'Somme', 'blasted', 'expanse', 'No-Man', 'Land', 'exact', 'replica', 'one', 'used', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'War', 'Horse', 'wonder', 'space', 'specifically', 'rented', 'out', 'WWI', 'movies', 'scenes', 'battle', 'are', 'unsparing', 'horribly', 'graphic', 'Steven', 'assigned', 'tunneling', 'outfit', 'Sewer', 'Rats', 'friendship', 'sorts', 'Jack', 'Firebrace', 'solid', 'workingman', 'who', 'suffering', 'loss', 'young', 'son', 'Jack', 'poignancy', 'mitigate', 'Steven', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'as', 'well', 'reminding', 'love', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'lesson', 'Steven', 'will', 'need', 'utilize', 'become', 'full', 'man.Steven', 'Isabelle', 'reunite', 'briefly', 'lull', 'fighting', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'had', 'enough', 'doe-eyed', 'gazes', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'tension', 'was', 'more', 'intrigued', 'Steven', 'would', 'man', 'up', 'take', 'responsibility', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'life', 'am', 'avoiding', 'spoilers', 'here', '.Overall', 'Birdsong', 'was', 'small', 'disappointment', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'nothing', 'else', 'available']",N/A

1527714,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B0077PBPJ6,Doug Park,"[3, 3]","First of all, BIRDSONG is beautifully filmed and acted. Joseph Mawle is especially memorable as Jack Firebrace--who I quote in my title here--a friend and sort of foil-character to the protagonist (Stephen Wraysford) played by Eddie Redmayne. Agree: American audiences may find all the British brogues a bit hard to follow without the subtitles.While there is a palpable storyline and a good surprise at the end, BIRDSONG appeals more to the heart than to the head. It's quite a sad story, of course, but it avoids going too far in the direction of melodrama. It successfully incorporates some really huge themes: Love, forgiveness, loyalty, and others. There is also a great deal of WWI battle footage: BIRDSONG will probably appeal to most war film aficionados. Warning: Some really graphic scenes of carnage at the Somme and various other battles.Part I shifts every few minutes from Wraysford's illicit 1910 love affair with the wife of a French business partner to his service in the British army between 1916-18. The two time settings are extremely well-synchronized: The directors and producers did a fine job of making the two stories into one. Part II, though it follows the same general pattern, is a little more of a straightforward, solidified story.I haven't read Sebastian Faulks's original novel, but I've heard nothing but good things about it.

One addresses the love story, one addresses the war story and the third featurette discusses the behind the scenes filming.  The movie was filmed in part in Budapest, Hungary.  The actors, director, producer and costume designer all speak warmly and intensely of their involvement in the production.This film is a not-to-be-missed Masterpiece theatre two-part series.  If you have read the book, you will find some differences.  I won't go into detail, since I have not read the book as of yet (I have skimmed through it), but one major difference is that the 1970's part of the novel is not included in the film.  That is probably no great loss, since many readers felt that this part of the book was not necessary.Clemence Poesy (Isabelle Azaire) is stunning and Eddie Redmayne (Stephen) is also captivating.

1527722,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0077PBPJ6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 28]","Sebastian Faulks' beloved WWII novel ""Birdsong"" makes a handsome two-part presentation as a part of Masterpiece Classics. Fans of the book, especially with the U. K. premiere, expressed a fair amount of disappointment in the liberties taken by Abi Morgan (The Hours, which coincidentally was also much more acclaimed on its U.S. debut than it had been in Britain). Having read the source material many years ago, I think this is an earnest adaptation. I don't get too caught up with the similarities and the divergences, however, the work must stand independently as a film. The harshest criticisms that I have read seem a bit unwarranted, but the glowing accolades miss the mark as well. This well-meaning and gorgeously produced film experiences some of the same problems that many adaptations of a literary success have faced. It's hard to bring the subtle nuance and introspection of fine prose to the screen without it seeming a tad disconnected.Eddie Redmayne plays the title character (this casting upset some, but Redmayne is quite good even if not the perfect ""book"" Stephen of your imagination). His story is told between two juxtaposed stories: one supposedly recounting the love story of his life, one his days in the trenches during the Great War. As he remembers his idyllic true love, however, it seems a little less successful than I would have liked. A pre-war Redmayne meets a lovely French woman (Clemence Poesy) when he is working with her husband. After a few chaste exchanges, suddenly they are deeply in love with no regard for her circumstances. The only cue that this is a grand romance is Redmayne's moony expression when no one is looking but the screenplay never builds much romance or even friendship between the two. It's occasional sex, I never felt this was a grand love story that would affect them in any substantial way. For the story's sake, though, we must believe it. The wartime sequences are more rewarding, as Redmayne stares down death and turns from an aloof outsider to heroic leader.My principle reservations, I suppose, stem from the piece's screenplay more than anything. The early scenes faced uneven pacing and are simply chock full of meaningful looks with little dialogue. Poesy, in particular, is a real cipher who never gets fully fleshed out as a real person. But that's it in a nutshell. Redmayne is so front and center, we don't really get to know anyone else beyond surface presentation. His squad in the wartime segment are appealing, but largely unexplored as well. ""Birdsong"" had the potential to be an absolutely devastating tear-jerker. I wanted it at ANY time to profoundly move me. The subject matter should have and could have. But I was so detached from everyone in the cast, I ended up admiring this production more than loving it. And I really wanted to love it. Maybe that's why the detractors to this adaptation were so harsh, it keeps you at a distance throughout. Still, there is enough good to make this a recommendation for the right audience. About 3 1/2 stars, for me.

He has an affair with a married woman and continues unwilling to honor her need to love through parenting.Through World War I the boy experiences the challenges of adulthood, accepting responsibility for making decisions which impact others. The intensity of the combat scenes and his moments of choice are compelling illustrations of the rigors of battle, a telescoped and exaggerated trajectory of maturation not everyone survives. His team is a group of tunnelers who repeatedly experience blast trauma TBI as well as personal loss PTSD. His paramour also suffers blast trauma PTSD from a German bomb to her home.The boy tries to protect and mentor a younger tunnel digger, introducing him to a brothel, and assigning him the task of lookout so the younger never enters the carbon monoxide filled tunnels. Eventually he learns no one can control another's life or death.Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)The boy is befriended by an older miner who advises him that love is all there is ""to love and to be loved in return."" This advice provides the motivation the boy needs to survive long enough to contemplate his own coming of age and meaning in life.The boy's immaturity due to being without role models for appropriate parenting seems prolonged, as he resists any suggestion that parenting is an honorable state.
