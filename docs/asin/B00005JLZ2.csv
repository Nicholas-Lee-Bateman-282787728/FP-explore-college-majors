Paltrow is far too talented for this, but more importantly, she is far too talented to pull this off.  She is such a miscast as this character; it just doesn't seem legit coming from her.  I wish the film had been as engaging or as funny as the trailer suggested, but it just doesn't come together well enough in the end.  What is even worse than this being bad is that it is ultimately the definition of forgettable.  Watch it and give it a week and you won't remember a thing other than that you didn't care for it.  `View From the Top' is just hollow fluff; a film with no real depth of even worthy plot development.

Paltrow, an actress of far greater range, seems overqualified for the role of a Silver Springs, Nevada girl, who, after her high school sweetheart dumps her, is inspired by a TV commercial to escape by becoming a stewardess (oops, I mean Flight Attendant...it's that 60's thing, again!) Winding up with a bush water airline flying drunks back and forth to Las Vegas, she bonds with ex-Hooters 'vet', Kelly Preston (agelessly beautiful, and as voluptuous as ever), and Applegate, a cute kleptomaniac. Despite meeting a law student on sabbatical (Mark Ruffalo) that she's attracted to, Paltrow convinces her friends to join her in interviewing for flight attendant jobs with the international airline her role model (Candice Bergen, playing a sympathetic character, for a change) flew for. The interviews are run by a cross-eyed and hilarious Mike Myers, who steals the film, every time he appears! Preston fails, but Paltrow and Applegate are accepted, and training begins...but when the final exam is given, despite Paltrow's intense studying, Applegate gets the choice assignment, and she ends up in Cleveland...where she again meets Ruffalo, who's decided to return to Law School...Will Gwyneth allow herself to fall for the hunky Ruffalo? Will she, as Myers commands, wait a year and retest, again? Will she ever see Paris, her Flight Attendant dream destination? And just how did educationally-challenged Christina out-test her?

That is why so many people pan it as they want it to meet an expectation from the advertising. It was advertised wrong as a pure comedy. It of course is not. Some might say it has too many angles. That is what makes it more like real life than many movies. It is a &quot;growing up&quot; movie. It is a comedy. It is a drama at times. Just like life! So often studios advertise movies as fitting a certain category to try and draw a set audience. That can be a movie killer though. Gwenith Paltrow did a fantastic job as the star.

A bit offensive to anyone with an ounce of feminist sensibility?  I'm afraid so.Here's the thing:  I went to the theater expecting an hour and a half of so-bad-it's-good fluffball comedy, and really enjoyed ""View From the Top"" in spite of myself.  The whole movie all but begs not to be taken seriously, which is probably the reason why it works as well as it does.  Appropriately for a movie about the airline industry, this is pure escapism, in the well-worn motif of a trailer-park kid who decides she wants more out of life and, after a few mildly hard knocks, gets it.  Donna, a store clerk somewhere in rural Nevada, decides on a career as a flight attendant on a lark after her boyfriend dumps her, and promptly sets her sights on the New York-to-Paris route despite a hilariously bumpy start in the business.  Of course, this is America, and all Donna has to do is work hard, be patient and persistent, and look like Gwyneth Paltrow.  (Casting Paltrow as trailer trash is about as convincing as you'd expect it to be, but her acting is great as usual.)While the movie never really tries to be very serious, it will probably elicit a knowing nod or two from anyone who has suffered an unfair setback at work or felt like it was taking too long to climb the professional ladder.  (In other words, it's the perfect comedy for today's job market!)  The corollary plot about Donna's on again, off again relationship with her law-student boyfriend is a bit too treacly and old-fashioned to be really enjoyable, but the story's final twist resolves this in a cute, if utterly unconvincing, way.In any case, the main focus is on the slapstick comedy portions of the story, while plot advancement is mostly an afterthought.

She doesn't want to end up like her mom, who has married four times, and all of them seem to be alcoholics. After her high school boyfriend dumps her on a birthday card, she decides that she needs to make some changes. She goes to work for a small airline as a flight attendant, where they believe in ""big hair and short skirts.""She fits right in, and meets Christine (Christina Applegate) and Sherry (Kelly Preston). They spend their time in Lake Havasu tanning on Sherry's roof.(not much else to do) When Donna meets Ted, (Mark Ruffalo) they instantly have an attraction. But, since she is moving to Cleveland to bigger and better airlines to be a trainee, they don't take their relationship much further than a first date.Once there, Donna is at the top of her class, and taking all of the rules and procedures seriously---her classmate Christine, not so much. But, somehow, Christine manages to do better than Donna on the test, so she is the one that gets to work out of New York International, while Donna is stuck in Cleveland. Something doesn't seem right, but it doesn't matter so much when she meets up with Ted again who is going to law school in Cleveland, where his family lives.Will she make it to New York International? If she does, will she still want what she has wanted all of this time, or is what she wanted right in front of her face?It was cute, as I stated above.

It started out to be ""woman will go to all lengths to live her dreams"" but then it had ""spoof"" like parts in it, like Mike Myers and his lazy eye. I'm all for comedy, but when you take it to that level, it becomes an entirely different movie.

But the movie was an overall good movie.Donna Jenson, played by Gwenyth Paltrow, has dreamed of a better life for herself. She thought she was going to get the chance to leave her hometown with her first boyfriend, but he had no intention of taking her with him. He was involved with another co-worker and took her instead. With a stroke of luck, she and her two friends friends Christine Montgomery and Sherry (a short role for Kelly Preston)decide to get an education in the friendly skies.Meeting Sally Weston brings sheer stroke of hope for Donna who looks up to her but she is thwarted again and working for a lesser airline. But on the flipside, she does find love with Ted Stewart, a law student who is family-oriented. The two fall in love. When her friend Christine arrives on their doorstep, she then questions how she got her job at Sally Weston's airline.A chance again comes for Donna but it also means having to give up the man she loves. She doesn't want to get hurt again. But flying the friendly skies can be lonely for an airline stewardess and she soon wonders if she has made the right decision.This movie is good on themes but the humor just isn't there. Candace Bergen looks very good for her age. She proves that you don't have to be relegated to playing roles that identify ""old age"". She stood out in that airline uniform. And Christina Applegate, who played the dumb blonde on ""Married With Children"" has come a long way. Despite the devious character she plays, she handles it very well.Personally I felt that she should have pursued her dream of being a Weston stewardess but she could've maintained her romance with the aspiring lawyer.

But let us assume that Royalty needs the flexibility of calling its best flight attendants to fly domestic out of Newark or international out of JFK at will. Manhattan is midway.But, the reality is La Hacienda near LAX, the official hotel of Spirit Airlines, a fun budget carrier, staffed by fun people, who only on occasion calls the LAPD to deal with its passengers when its one and only plane at LAX has a busted tire or something, and the passengers, delayed 12 hours, storm the counter. The passengers are also a fun lot, mostly gang bangers and working people who would otherwise take the bus. In general, a good time is had by all...but it is certainly nothing like ladies in hats deplaning in Paris.[A fun way to go to Paris from the Far East: Emirates. My flight last year was also taken by an Osama clone who prayed overlong in the departure lounge and was greeted by muscular followers who played video games enroute. I sat next to an Austrian army type who was probably keeping an eye on the homes and nothing happened, probably because the Osama clone was just another schmoe cleric. Once you get over raw terror, flying is a gas, and, because of the raw terror, cheap psychiatry.]But, movies about commercial aviation manage to show real working people who actually dream dreams limited ab initio by material circumstances.This movie includes some nice eye candy including some real basic stuff...Stews in Bikinis at Lake Havasu. And throughout, Gwyneth Paltrow retains that dignity which does credit both to her own profession and those of people who keep planes up with the sharp end pointed the right way and watch over us passengers.Rob Lowe as CoPilot Steve gets another one of those strange little cameos he gets from time to time, where his dangerous, almost saccharin, sexuality is allowed to ooze out a bit and then put back in the can. He goes nowhere, unfortunately, and his career (starting as it did with a serious version of David Mamet's stage play Sexual Perversity in Chicago) is also going nowhere...perhaps because About Last Night managed to preserve a modicum of moral seriousness and this upset the morally unserious  who can't deal with terminal pain as a necessary part of sexuality.Mike Moore is allowed instead to romp over most of the latter part of the film in a fun way and as your basic airhead stuff, this film is five stars.",5,"Fun, basic eye candy",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2757,"['Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'apartment', 'upper', 'eighties', 'Fifth', 'avenue', 'hard', 'credit', 'fictional', 'airline', 'bought', 'block', 'flats', 'time', 'senior', 'employees', 'funds', 'block', 'investment.As', 'business', 'decision', 'airline', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'equity', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Newark', 'JFK', 'are', 'rather', 'hard', 'get', 'Manhattan', 'let', 'assume', 'Royalty', 'flexibility', 'calling', 'best', 'flight', 'attendants', 'fly', 'domestic', 'Newark', 'international', 'JFK', 'will', 'Manhattan', 'midway.But', 'reality', 'La', 'Hacienda', 'LAX', 'official', 'hotel', 'Spirit', 'Airlines', 'fun', 'budget', 'carrier', 'staffed', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'occasion', 'LAPD', 'deal', 'passengers', 'when', 'one', 'only', 'plane', 'LAX', 'busted', 'tire', 'something', 'passengers', 'delayed', '12', 'hours', 'storm', 'counter', 'passengers', 'are', 'also', 'fun', 'lot', 'mostly', 'gang', 'bangers', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'otherwise', 'take', 'bus', 'general', 'good', 'time', 'had', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'ladies', 'hats', 'deplaning', 'Paris', '[', 'fun', 'way', 'go', 'Paris', 'Far', 'East', 'Emirates', 'flight', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'Osama', 'clone', 'who', 'prayed', 'overlong', 'departure', 'lounge', 'was', 'greeted', 'muscular', 'followers', 'who', 'played', 'video', 'games', 'enroute', 'sat', 'next', 'Austrian', 'army', 'type', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'keeping', 'eye', 'homes', 'nothing', 'happened', 'probably', 'Osama', 'clone', 'was', 'just', 'schmoe', 'cleric', 'Once', 'get', 'raw', 'terror', 'flying', 'gas', 'raw', 'terror', 'cheap', 'psychiatry', ']', 'movies', 'commercial', 'aviation', 'manage', 'show', 'real', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'dream', 'dreams', 'limited', 'ab', 'initio', 'material', 'circumstances.This', 'movie', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'including', 'real', 'basic', 'stuff', 'Stews', 'Bikinis', 'Lake', 'Havasu', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'dignity', 'credit', 'own', 'profession', 'people', 'who', 'keep', 'planes', 'up', 'sharp', 'end', 'pointed', 'right', 'way', 'watch', 'passengers.Rob', 'Lowe', 'CoPilot', 'Steve', 'one', 'strange', 'little', 'cameos', 'time', 'time', 'where', 'dangerous', 'almost', 'saccharin', 'sexuality', 'allowed', 'ooze', 'out', 'bit', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'can', 'nowhere', 'unfortunately', 'career', 'starting', 'did', 'serious', 'version', 'David', 'Mamet', 'stage', 'play', 'Sexual', 'Perversity', 'Chicago', 'also', 'going', 'nowhere', 'perhaps', 'Last', 'Night', 'managed', 'preserve', 'modicum', 'moral', 'seriousness', 'morally', 'unserious', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'terminal', 'pain', 'necessary', 'part', 'sexuality.Mike', 'Moore', 'allowed', 'instead', 'romp', 'most', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'fun', 'way', 'basic', 'airhead', 'stuff', 'film', 'five', 'stars']",View from the Top

It never takes itself too seriously, yet it does not just discard itself either.Every shot is wonderful.  It is almost like a painting full of color and texture.  It reminds me of why we go to see movies anyway..  As an escape.  To get away from the mundane everyday boredom that may exist in our own lives.It is fantasy.  It is there to help us dream and explore other feelings that we may never have the chance to feel.Just take it for what it is worth.... nothing more, nothing less.Don't expect over the top action or anything like that.It is a character driven movie.  You are not left at the end wondering why or how did that happen.  You are just left with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.I cannot express enough how much I love this movie.(I also got a kick out of George Kennedy's little part. - a throwback to the days of &quot;Airport&quot;)Have fun, I know I did.",5,The best kind of light fluff there is,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,1780,"['was', 'really', 'promoted', 'incorrectly', 'not', 'laugh', 'ass', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'funny', 'love', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'eating', 'whipped', 'cream', 'Not', 'much', 'love', 'Gwyneth', 'living', 'trailer', 'hell', 'tells', 'how', 'why', 'got', 'away', 'way', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'help', 'stab', 'back.In', 'quest', 'be', 'best', 'industry', 'airline', 'attendant', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'looking', 'already', 'seen', 'what', 'looking', 'still', 'out', 'ther', 'find', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'story', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'love', 'will', 'keep', 'throw', 'away', 'think', 'light', 'tone', 'movie', 'really', 'helped', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'not', 'just', 'discard', 'either.Every', 'shot', 'wonderful', 'almost', 'painting', 'full', 'color', 'texture', 'why', 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'anyway..', 'escape', 'get', 'away', 'mundane', 'everyday', 'boredom', 'may', 'exist', 'own', 'lives.It', 'fantasy', 'there', 'help', 'dream', 'explore', 'other', 'feelings', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'feel.Just', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'top', 'action', 'anything', 'that.It', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'left', 'end', 'wondering', 'why', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'inside.I', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'got', 'kick', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'little', 'part', 'throwback', 'days', 'quot', 'Airport', 'quot', 'Have', 'fun', 'know', 'did']",View from the Top

Thus, I avoided seeing it for all of the right reasons. However, the genre of film is one of my boyfriend's favorites, and as a favor to him, rented this little movie for a quick Saturday afternoon's entertainment. What I found was a quirky, fun, funny movie that, if you don't take it all too seriously, you can seriously warm to.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna, a girl with stars and the skies in her eyes. Donna longs for a better life than her small town girlhood in Silver Springs. Hooking up with a small commuter airline, Donna starts her career in the air. In one short but pivotal scene, she is dissed by a trio of snooty flight atttendants, which fires her upward. Soon, she moves up to a major airlines, but first, has to endure the training process, run by the ever funny Mike Meyers.Complication besets complication, but no worries, this is a film whose plot is secondary to the likabillity of its characters. You know about the ending, but the time spent with these people is entertaining. Turning in great performances is the hugely underused Kelly Preston, Christina Applegate as a ditsy coworker, wonderful Candice Bergan as a flight attendant extraordinaire, and the lovable Mark Ruffalo, playing a has-it-together guy, finally.Much disdain has been heaped on this movie, perhaps by people intending to take it much more seriously than was its intention. Citizen Kane its not, but a lighthearted time spent in the skies. As we follow Donna on her journey of self-revelation, we root for her and all of her friends as well.

609780,A1DX5ELWUXHLIZ,B00005JLZ2,"Jorge Carreon, Jr.","[2, 2]","God bless Gwyneth for taking on such a sophomoric comedy. Despite is banalities, she looks like she's having a great time -- or she's really that good an actress.The Oscar-winner works hard and her charms go a long way in this odd venture from some talented filmmakers.  Shelved since 2001, it is obvious Miramax needed some time to grease up their legendary hype machine. Although, one look at the poster and the shameful marketing is painfully evident.  Airbrushed faces on the bodies of models to represent the cast is a dead giveaway, since that is how the movie plays.VIEW FROM THE TOP is so featherweight, it practically floats away from your mind the minute it is over.  However, given our current war situation, I have to admit it was a nice piece of brain candy to shut out the CNN barrage.The film offers a simple moral fable -- stay true to your dreams and heart.  La Paltrow is white trash godddess Donna Jensen, who is determined to get out of the trailer park and fly the friendly skies as an international stew for Royalty Airways.The plot barely thickens, allowing for some cute cameos (Rob Lowe) and some shtick that goes on too long (Mike Myers, are you listening!?).  The love story with uber-talented, but still slumming Mark Ruffalo is predictable, especially with its awww-fully sappy dialogue, but dammit, I bought it!Still, it is the girl power represented by such pros as Paltrow, Candice Bergen, Christina Applegate and, especially, Kelly Preston, that proves its best asset, even at its lowest points.  At best, it is a mindless matinee that makes the best of limited pluses.  At its worst, you may feel slightly cheated for spending the money. Still, I found the film a guilty pleasure. From its retrocool look to the chick pop soundtrack, VIEW FROM THE TOP is worthy of viewing, but keep your expectations low.If watching Gwyneth parade in some outfits that would have even Julia Roberts' jaw-drop in ""Erin Brockovich,"" then this film is for you!

I use to be a flight attendent, and  could identify with Gwyneth Paltrow's character  wanting to find a new direction in her life. With the exception of the more outrageous comedy moments in the film, I thought it was a pretty close to what flight attendents go through. Of course it not 100% accurate. It's a movie not a documentary. I think the reason this film did not do well at the box office was because it was pushed to look like another Airplane movie or Naked Gun. I watched this movie with a open mind and I thought it was great. The supporting cast was very good. Mike Myers is a hoot!

She's got a great range.  The woman won an Oscar, remember?  She didn't grab the statue for this movie, but she's got the chops and she runs away with the role of Donna, the trailer park girl from Nevada with big dreams.Second, Christina Applegate is deliciously duplicitious in the role of her friend and protege, and is proof that trash in Chanel's clothing is still ... well, trash.  Then again, standing next to Gwyneth Paltrow, who isn't going to look somewhat less-than?  (OK, so I'm biased.  This is my disclaimer).Third, Mike Meyers as flight attendant trainer?  How funny is this?  Do you love Mike Meyers?  Why haven't you seen this movie yet?  Not optional.  A MUST OWN.  He is high-larious, and the bloopers at the end of the movie are worth the price of a rental alone.  (""I am a kitten ... "")Fourth:  The writing.  No, not the plot, which is predictably formulaic and fairly predictable.  What makes this movie pop like Jiffy is the way these actors take it and make it their own.  What comes through loud and clear is how much fun these folks were having making this film.  It is a romp!

Bernabo,"[11, 13]","You keep wanting to dismiss &quot;View from the Top&quot; as a total fluff piece, but then something keeps happening to make you think that it is not that bad.  After all, at the heart of this movie is Gwyneth Paltrow, and we might not really believe that she is a white trash trailer park girl, but we never forget this is Gwyneth Paltrow.  More importantly, this is not Gwyneth Paltrow the drama queen, but one who gets to spend most of the film being adorable (without an English accent), and she can be pretty adorable (especially without an English accent).&quot;View from the Top&quot; walks a fine line, because on the one hand we have some over the top scenes courtesy of Mike Myers as Flight Attendant Guru John Whitney, Josh Malina as Randy Jones male Flight Attendant, and Rob Lowe as co-pilot Steve Bench.  Then we get back to Gwyneth as Donna, the girl with a dream, and it is almost like being in another movie.  So there is a comic side and a serious side to this movie, just like there is the career plot line and the romance plot line between Donna and Ted (Mark Ruffalo), and just like Donna has her good friend Sherry (Kelly Preston) and her not so good friend Christine (Christina Applegate).But the person who ends up being the lynch pin of this film is Donna's mentor and flight attendant godmother, Sally Weston, played by Candice Bergen.  You keeping thinking Murphy Brown is going to make an appearance at any moment, but Sally Weston is exactly who she seems to be and as good as gold.  She might be perky and the queen of stewardesses, but the lady is not stupid.  You keep thinking this movie is going to turn into some sort of mindless romp about flight attendants, but it never sinks to that level.Be sure not to bail out before the credits, because in addition to the traditional outtakes there is a production number by the flight attendants of Royalty Airlines.

When she is almost convinced that she will be stuck in her little town forever, Donna sees Sally Weston (Candice Bergen), the royalty of flight attendants, on a television talk show. Inspired to fly her way into a new life -even though she has never been on an airplane- Donna applies immediately for a flight attendant's position with a local commuter airline. Eventually aspiring to greater opportunities, she and two fellow stewardesses (Christina Applegate &amp; Kelley Preston) pursue jobs with the more prestigious and widely traveled Royalty Airlines, the airline of Sally Weston, herself. Donna enjoys the aid and encouragement of many of the folks at Royalty Airlines, feels the betrayal of others, and must balance her personal and professional lives while she pursues her dream of working &quot;Paris First Class International&quot; and beyond.&quot;View from the Top&quot; is a light-hearted comedy about a nice all-American young woman trying to make a satisfying life for herself. Donna isn't particularly smart or dumb. She's ambitious, but hard-working and scrupulously honest. She's pretty. She's friendly. When I think about it, she's so full of sugar and spice and everything nice that she sounds nauseating. If Gwyneth Paltrow's charisma was ever in doubt, it is no longer. Paltrow imbues Donna with such sincerity and spirit that she is magnetic and sympathetic where the character could easily have been saccharine in the hands of a less appealing actress.

609802,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00005JLZ2,Priscilla Stafford,"[0, 7]","Being a movie buff and still in high school means that on most occasions I watch movies with both parents. And since my mom simply loves romantic comedies (think Meg Ryan, 'The Queen of Romantic Comedies'), I decided to give ""View from the Top"" a try.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Donna Jensen, a small time girl who desperately wants to see the world and leave her home town behind. By chance she sees the famous stewardess/recent authoress Sally Weston (Candice Bergen). Inspired by Sally Weston, Donna lands a job as a stewardess on one of the lower class airlines. But soon, her dreams start becoming a reality when she gets accepted to the Royal Airlines school to be trained as a waitress. But through many hardships, trials, and a love interest in the form of Ted Stewart (Mark Ruffalo), Donna learns what it really means to find happiness and fulfill your true dreams. Also stars the famous Mike Myers as a teacher at the Royal Airlines School with a slight 'eye' problem, Christine Applegate as Christine the fellow stewardess who is not all that she seems, and a small part by Kelly Preston as another aspiring stewardess. Short cameo also of Rob Lowe as a co-pilot.Just as the title for my review states, I found ""View from the Top"" in my list of 'extremely mediocre'. Wasn't too bad, just nothing special either. The thing with this movie is that it actually DOES have potential. So here's a list of the good points:1) Gwyneth Paltrow's character is actually likable though a bit naive. Recent romantic/comedy stars are at times just unlikable, making the whole movie unlikable. How can you like a movie with terrible characters.2) Mike Myers is simply HILARIOUS! His whole 'eye' thing is sooo funny! But amazingly enough, he has character isn't too one-dimensional, giving occasion for you to feel for him and like him not just as a comic relief.3) The story is in a way quiet enjoyable, an easy to follow storyline.4) Some great one-liners and jokes! I especially loved it when Sally Weston says something about 'smiling even after you're out of Bloody Mary mix'.Ok, on with the numerous 'on the bad side' points:1) All right, even for people who LOVED this movie have to admit that the love plot was just a 'mite' too boring. There seemed to be no real chemistry between the two Paltrow and Ruffalo that it was bit hard to believe they end up with each other at the end.2) Predictability seems to be a major *must* in all romantic/comedies. Unfortunately, ""View from the Top"" seems to have taken the cake for being too predictable. There was some effort to include a small twist in the plot, but viewers could predict that at least 30 minutes before it actually happens.3) Half of the jokes are sexually implied ones, which for me totally ruins all great movies of this genre. And as many movies are now inclined to have to include gay jokes or at least have one gay person in the movie, it proves to make me especially uncomfortable. I'm sure at least a few people agree with me on that area, gay jokes can be in my opinion TOTALLY taken out of any film.To sum it up, ""View from the Top"" is nothing special. And sadly because it seemed to be MADE to be 'just another chick flick', it's a movie which can be easily passed over.

It takes place, sadly, in our time.  It would have been more fun had the cheesy uniforms and the ""jet-setting stew"" been more a focus.Also, while there are occasional moments of comedic hijinks, the movie is actually a fairly low-key romantic comedy.  If you're in the mood for a laid back, pleasant but hardly hot romance, then go ahead and enjoy.Gwyneth Paltrow and the terrific Mark Ruffalo (YOU CAN COUNT ON ME) are the on-again, off-again couple.  Mostly, we follow Paltrow, as she strives to fulfill her dreams of becoming a flight attendant with the New York - Paris route.  Not exactly the stuff of high drama.  Kelly Preston plays an acquaintance who joins her on her ""quest"" and Christina Applegate is another friend, whose dealings are just a bit suspect.Mike Myers, featured heavily in the trailers, is in a supporting role as a trainer.

609806,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLZ2,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Bruno Barreto's ""View From the Top"" boasts a cute premise that doesn't quite live up to its potential.  The film starts out in a satirical vein, promising to deliver a nifty spoof of life in the friendly skies.  Instead, it settles into a typical romantic comedy formula, not bad as these things go, but nothing to write home about either.  So while ""View from the Top"" never soars very high, neither does it end up crashing and burning.  In this day and age, one must be grateful for a safe landing, even if the ride is a bumpy one.Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a winning performance as Donna, a small town girl who becomes a stewardess as a way of escaping her dysfunctional family and white trash upbringing.  The first part of the film is fun, as Donna earns her wings flying for a cut-rate airline whose attendants dress and act more like prostitutes than stewardesses.  With their form-fitting, cleavage-exposing blouses, purple hot pants and big hair, these pleasantly perky hostesses look like they're ready to serve their passengers more than just the customary coffee, tea or milk.  So far, so good - but once the girls move onto a more ""legitimate"" airline, much of the satiric bite drains out of the film and we move onto the more familiar terrain of catty rivalries, long distance romance, and unrequited love.In addition to Paltrow, the movie features Christina Applegate, Rob Lowe, Candice Bergen and Mark Ruffalo in various roles.  Mike Myers is surprisingly annoying in the part of a cross-eyed stewardess trainer. The screenplay by Eric Wald has a maddening tendency to drop characters along the way, giving the film a slapdash, unformed and oddly amateurish quality.  As partial compensation, the film boasts superb production and costume design and a generally ebullient spirit.""View From the Top"" doesn't end up flying us anywhere special and it's definitely coach all the way, but it does serve up a few laughs in mid flight.",3,uneven though occasionally fun,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1942,"['Bruno', 'Barreto', 'View', 'Top', 'cute', 'premise', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'film', 'out', 'satirical', 'vein', 'promising', 'deliver', 'nifty', 'spoof', 'life', 'friendly', 'skies', 'Instead', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'go', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'So', 'View', 'Top', 'never', 'very', 'high', 'neither', 'end', 'up', 'crashing', 'burning', 'day', 'age', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'grateful', 'safe', 'landing', 'even', 'ride', 'bumpy', 'one.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'winning', 'performance', 'Donna', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'stewardess', 'way', 'escaping', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'white', 'trash', 'upbringing', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'fun', 'Donna', 'wings', 'flying', 'cut-rate', 'airline', 'attendants', 'dress', 'act', 'more', 'prostitutes', 'stewardesses', 'form-fitting', 'cleavage-exposing', 'blouses', 'purple', 'hot', 'pants', 'big', 'hair', 'pleasantly', 'perky', 'hostesses', 'look', ""'re"", 'ready', 'serve', 'passengers', 'more', 'just', 'customary', 'coffee', 'tea', 'milk', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'once', 'girls', 'move', 'more', 'legitimate', 'airline', 'much', 'satiric', 'bite', 'film', 'move', 'more', 'familiar', 'terrain', 'catty', 'rivalries', 'long', 'distance', 'romance', 'unrequited', 'love.In', 'addition', 'Paltrow', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'various', 'roles', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'surprisingly', 'annoying', 'part', 'cross-eyed', 'stewardess', 'trainer', 'screenplay', 'Eric', 'Wald', 'maddening', 'tendency', 'drop', 'characters', 'way', 'giving', 'film', 'slapdash', 'unformed', 'oddly', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'partial', 'compensation', 'film', 'superb', 'production', 'costume', 'design', 'generally', 'ebullient', 'spirit', 'View', 'Top', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'flying', 'anywhere', 'special', 'definitely', 'coach', 'way', 'serve', 'up', 'few', 'laughs', 'mid', 'flight']",View from the Top

A good advertisement for the flight attendant field, it's a rotten ad for the film business. How Gwyneth Paltrow, a good actor, happened upon this goofy script is one of those mysteries better left unsolved.Paltrow is Donna, a small-town Nevada girl doing time at the Big Lots superstore. She sees a TV show featuring a famous flight attendant (Candice Bergen), decides upon a job in the skies, and works first for a low-class puddle jumper with two big-haired broads (Kelly Preston and Christina Applegate). She also meets Ted (Mark Ruffalo), a law student on some kind of hiatus. Scooting right along, Donna and her buddies try out for a reputable airline, the ultimate goal being the coveted New York-Paris international route, although I'd prefer Madrid. Or maybe Istanbul.Donna is an ace student, somewhat to chagrin of Applegate's character, who plays a nasty trick, and Donna's cross-eyed flight instructor, played by Mike Myers like he had some time to kill. There is a Choice, between love and the international route, and a Moral To It All, with a few decent, obligatory shots of Paris at Christmas.&quot;A View From The Top&quot; seems to know a little about flight attendants, but not too much. It certainly flip-flops on how they should look these days - top hats and one-piece zipper suits haven't been around for years. The entire cast is forgettable, and though Paltrow has the talent to play below her intelligence level - check out her clever cameo in &quot;Duets&quot; - her heart is not in it here. Ruffalo is bizarrely jocular. Applegate is swiftly becoming an annoying third wheel.Though it isn't vulgar, or very long - both good marks in my book - &quot;A View From The Top&quot; is never consistently funny, or dramatic, or touching, or even interesting to watch.

My mother simply brought home as a fun bit of fluff for a Saturday night, and that was pretty much what we got.I was unable to work out whether the film was actually taking itself seriously, or whether it was a gigantic satire on the whole follow-your-dream/romantic comedy genre.  At times it was really funny or enjoyably wacky - for instance, quite a few parts of the flight attendant training; Mike Myers's character, in general; the fight scene between Donna and Christina; but at other times it was sickly-sweet (nearly everything about following your dreams) or very, very sincere (Donna's relationship with Ted).  So it was really hard to understand how you were meant to react.Personally, I found the morals of the story cliched and irritating, and the Sally Weston character just another strong-mentor-person-thing; and Donna did come across as just a bit too smug/perfect at times.  Also the plot was quite annoying, with characters fading out leaving you wondering what the point was of putting them in in the first place.

Or just insensible, prejudjuced ideas of someone behind the movie?And Donna becomes a flight attendant, and be a friend with Christina Applegate and Kelly Preston as co-workers... quite a bad sign, isn't it?  For these ladies, talented as they are (especially the latter), tend to be typecast.  And again they are.  To make matters worse, Kelly Preston soon disappears (whom I miss) while Candice Bergen shows up (who exactly looks unchanged from her role in &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;), and Paltrow &amp; Applegate go on to audition for the first-class airline, where the best trainer is over-the-top Mike Myers, whose awfully misguided acting demolishes every little thing in the film.What does this film want to do?  It sometimes suggests our prejudiced ideas about flight attendants, trying to be a satire.  But the satire is weak, when you see Applegate and Paltrow engaged in a fierce cat flght (really), the former banging the head of the latter into bread.  Comedy?  But the gags are weak too when Myers' performance is just irritating and unfunny, the same kind of gags you see in, say,  &quot;Little Nicky.&quot;  And there is a romance, which is too weak to remember (love interest, Mark Raffalo).&quot;View From the Top&quot; gives us lots of fluff, that's the only thing you can get.  And as that, the film is not bad, a real eye-candy.  You will see Paltrow in bikini, and the costumes she wears are very fashionable.  And that's all that I can recommend.",2,Very Fluffy Eye-Candy: And That's All,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,2072,"['So', 'what', 'do', 'mean', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'thing', 'how', 'thought', 'when', 'was', 'quot', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'quot', 'Sliding', 'Door.', 'quot', 'Then', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', 'came', 'then', 'one', 'complete', 'mess.Ms', 'Paltrow', 'utterly', 'miscast', 'Donna', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'Nevada', 'wanted', 'leave', 'place', 'anyway', 'see', 'world', 'do', 'so', 'flight', 'attentant', 'So', 'far', 'see', 'so', 'lots', 'cliche', 'girl', 'living', 'trailer', 'mom', 'who', 'had', 'married', 'four', 'times', 'drunk', 'husband', 'supposed', 'be', 'satire', 'just', 'insensible', 'prejudjuced', 'ideas', 'someone', 'movie', 'Donna', 'flight', 'attendant', 'be', 'friend', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'co-workers', 'quite', 'bad', 'sign', ""n't"", 'ladies', 'talented', 'are', 'especially', 'latter', 'tend', 'be', 'typecast', 'again', 'are', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'soon', 'whom', 'miss', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'up', 'who', 'exactly', 'unchanged', 'role', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'quot', 'Paltrow', 'amp', 'Applegate', 'go', 'audition', 'first-class', 'airline', 'where', 'best', 'trainer', 'over-the-top', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'awfully', 'misguided', 'acting', 'demolishes', 'little', 'thing', 'film.What', 'film', 'want', 'do', 'sometimes', 'prejudiced', 'ideas', 'flight', 'attendants', 'trying', 'be', 'satire', 'satire', 'weak', 'when', 'see', 'Applegate', 'Paltrow', 'engaged', 'fierce', 'cat', 'flght', 'really', 'former', 'banging', 'head', 'latter', 'bread', 'Comedy', 'gags', 'are', 'weak', 'too', 'when', 'Myers', 'performance', 'just', 'irritating', 'unfunny', 'same', 'kind', 'gags', 'see', 'say', 'quot', 'Little', 'Nicky.', 'quot', 'romance', 'too', 'weak', 'remember', 'love', 'interest', 'Mark', 'Raffalo', 'quot', 'View', 'Top', 'quot', 'lots', 'fluff', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'real', 'eye-candy', 'will', 'see', 'Paltrow', 'bikini', 'costumes', 'wears', 'are', 'very', 'fashionable', 'can', 'recommend']",View from the Top

Most of the jokes were not funny and were thrown in for cheap laughs.  Also, Gwyneth Paltrow was a very poor choice for the lead role.  I think Kate Hudson or Cameron Diaz would have been much better, however, I don't think even they could have saved this bad film.  At times I wasn't sure if this was supposed to even be a comedy.  In the beginning, it seemed like it was supposed to be funny that Paltrow's character wanted to be a stuartess, but then it's supposed to be serious.  Although this movie was very bad, every scene with Mike Meyers was very funny.  His character had a lazy eye and he had an erratic temper that often caused hilarious scenarios.  If your a Meyers fan, you'd like him in this film, but you most likely will find this movie to be an un-funny chick-flick with bad writing and casting.",2,"Very bad, but Mike Meyers was hilarious",1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,948,"['watched', 'film', 'tv', 'very', 'late', 'night', 'was', 'surfing', 'channels', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'rent', 'was', 'horrible', 'Most', 'jokes', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'were', 'thrown', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'Also', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'choice', 'lead', 'role', 'think', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'bad', 'film', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'even', 'be', 'comedy', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Paltrow', 'character', 'wanted', 'be', 'stuartess', 'then', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'scene', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'character', 'had', 'lazy', 'eye', 'had', 'erratic', 'temper', 'often', 'caused', 'hilarious', 'scenarios', 'Meyers', 'fan', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'un-funny', 'chick-flick', 'bad', 'writing', 'casting']",View from the Top
