258239,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6301615832,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","Alright. Granted, this movie is not exactly an over the boards smash. That said, it really isn't so bad. To be sure, there are a lot of silly moments, but remember, it's a comedy. The story starts by introducing us to a detective agency that is not doing so well. John Larroquette plays Willis, who may seem obnoxious and annoying. However, as we grow to know him, we start to understand his frustrations. He left the Boston Police Force on less than good terms, and (to say the least) he has to deal with his less than normal partners. Preston (Stuart Pankin) is a nice enough guy, but his fascination with scientific aspects of situations often distracts him from performing at optimal levels. The other partner (Bobby) has seemingly boundless psychic abilities. (Not only can he read thoughts, but he has the power of mind over matter.) What prevents Bobby from being an invincible ally is that his eccentricities often get in the way of his duties and cause less than desirable consequences. (As we see more of this, we can understand the frustrations of Willis.) Bobby's spiritual guide (Murray) also offers some laughs, but he is not without angry emotions that lead to dangerous consequences. Moving on, a nun (Sister Elizabeth) and her assistant go to these unusual detectives over a hit and run case. Our poor detectives fail miserably. But in the process they learn that Sister Elizabeth had a tragic past with Bobby's spirit guide Murray. Later, our detectives learn that the hit and run incident was only part of a plan to kidnap the cardinal. So while our poor detectives failed in the simple hit and run case, they decide to uncover the mystery behind the cardinal's kidnapping. In my opinion, what makes this comedy work is that as silly as it gets, it avoids becoming an utter farce. The bumbling detective agency not only goes through moral development, but they actually start to pull together more, and become more effective. This is a lot more convincing than so called Hollywood heroes who are faultless and indestructible. Also, there is some violence in the story, but it is well placed, and the story doesn't take a back seat to it. Special kudos to Bess Armstrong for playing a very human nun. Perhaps the most hilarious scene is in the final chase when our heroes find themselves surrounded by the villains. Preston lets out a curse of despair; Sister Elizabeth gives a swift kick to the villain putting him out of action; but before their escape, Sister Elizabeth tells Preston: ""Watch your language."" Not only does this movie juggle comedy and suspense well, but it also allows the characters to go through moral development. My advice is to understand that this is a comedy, don't take it to seriously, and give it a chance.",3,At Least Give It A Chance,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,2753,"['Alright', 'Granted', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'boards', 'smash', 'said', 'really', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'silly', 'moments', 'remember', 'comedy', 'story', 'introducing', 'detective', 'agency', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'Willis', 'who', 'may', 'seem', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'However', 'grow', 'know', 'start', 'understand', 'frustrations', 'left', 'Boston', 'Police', 'Force', 'less', 'good', 'terms', 'say', 'least', 'deal', 'less', 'normal', 'partners', 'Preston', 'Stuart', 'Pankin', 'nice', 'enough', 'guy', 'fascination', 'scientific', 'aspects', 'situations', 'often', 'performing', 'optimal', 'levels', 'other', 'partner', 'Bobby', 'seemingly', 'boundless', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'read', 'thoughts', 'power', 'mind', 'matter', 'What', 'Bobby', 'being', 'invincible', 'ally', 'eccentricities', 'often', 'get', 'way', 'duties', 'cause', 'less', 'desirable', 'consequences', 'see', 'more', 'can', 'understand', 'frustrations', 'Willis', 'Bobby', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'Murray', 'also', 'laughs', 'not', 'angry', 'emotions', 'lead', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'Moving', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Elizabeth', 'assistant', 'go', 'unusual', 'detectives', 'hit', 'run', 'case', 'poor', 'detectives', 'fail', 'miserably', 'process', 'learn', 'Sister', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'tragic', 'past', 'Bobby', 'spirit', 'guide', 'Murray', 'Later', 'detectives', 'learn', 'hit', 'run', 'incident', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'plan', 'kidnap', 'cardinal', 'So', 'poor', 'detectives', 'failed', 'simple', 'hit', 'run', 'case', 'decide', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'cardinal', 'kidnapping', 'opinion', 'what', 'comedy', 'work', 'as', 'silly', 'avoids', 'becoming', 'utter', 'farce', 'bumbling', 'detective', 'agency', 'not', 'only', 'moral', 'development', 'actually', 'start', 'pull', 'together', 'more', 'become', 'more', 'effective', 'lot', 'more', 'convincing', 'so', 'called', 'Hollywood', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'faultless', 'indestructible', 'Also', 'violence', 'story', 'well', 'placed', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'Special', 'kudos', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'playing', 'very', 'human', 'nun', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'final', 'chase', 'when', 'heroes', 'find', 'surrounded', 'villains', 'Preston', 'out', 'curse', 'despair', 'Sister', 'Elizabeth', 'swift', 'kick', 'villain', 'putting', 'action', 'escape', 'Sister', 'Elizabeth', 'Preston', 'Watch', 'language', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'juggle', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'well', 'also', 'characters', 'go', 'moral', 'development', 'advice', 'understand', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

A kidnapping occurs and the Second Sight detective agency is hired to handle it.  They bring in a man and his psychic partner Bobby to handle the case.  What's funny about this is the part where they're in Larroquette's office, and Armstrong who plays a nun in this notices Bobby dancing rather strangely like he has to go to the bathroom.  And she says, ""Bobby you have to go to the bathroom?"" He says, ""No."" Larroquette says, ""Then why are you doing the pee-pee dance?"" I just about died laughing when I saw this part.  The low budget CGI effects in this movie are cool even when Bobby stops a bullet from hitting Larroquette's character in the face.
