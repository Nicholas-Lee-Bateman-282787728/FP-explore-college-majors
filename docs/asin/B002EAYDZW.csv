1265039,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B002EAYDZW,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[1, 2]","[THE GRASSHOPPER - (1969) - Widescreen presentation - directed by Jerry Paris]  Part exploitation, part cautionary tale of a young girl (Jacqueline Bisset) from a small town in British Columbia who travels to suburban L.A. to unite with her childhood boyfriend and, presumably, settle down. As it turns out, she doesn't want to settle for this douchebag (understandably), and ends up in Vegas as a showgirl to make ends meet. She has commitment issues with men and ends up in one turnstile relationship after another, until she meets Jim Brown. They date, they marry Vegas-style (no wonder divorce rates were/are so high), they have a troubled marriage that ends wretchedly (the highlight of the film), and she gets involved with a rock band and starts doing massive amounts of drugs. The downward spiral continues as she becomes the kept woman of a rich, older man (Joseph Cotton), flees when he offers to leave his wife of 30 years and marry her, first becoming an escort and finally a cheap hooker with her loser boyfriend as pimp, but ultimately he dashes off with all the cash they've amassed, leaving her nowhere and with nothing but a drug habit. As the old adage goes, ""It ain't easy being pretty and it ain't pretty being easy""...Had I known it was scripted and produced by Garry Marshall and Jerry Belson, a pair of irretrievably sophomoric TV hacks responsible for 'Happy Days' and 'Laverne and Shirley', I would've known what to expect and probably passed on this one. Parts were insufferable, namely the derivative soundtrack lifted from 'Midnight Cowboy', the uninspired ran-out-of-ideas-while-promoting-our-own-agenda final act and the insanely abrupt ending, coupled with the archaic cautionary message underlined in all the misgivings put forth here - ladies, if you don't marry your childhood sweetheart, settle down and have kids, you're going to hell in a handbasket right quick, having to settle for a black man, selling yourself to old codgers for next to nothing and, oh yeah, a drug habit and jail time. So conform or lose all. There was no third option back then in a world of many options, optimism and the 'Let it all hang out' era the likes of which American society had never known before or since? It's absolutely mindboggling in its message. It's rotten, racist, repressive and just wrong on so many levels. And this was made in 1969? When the entire world was engulfed in breaking the barriers of conventionality we're subjected to a 1950's repressive admonition straight out of 'Ozzie and Harriet'? WTF? Above all, it tries sooo hard to be hip and happening while promoting McCarthy and Eisenhower-era policies and standards. If there weren't several rounds of reasonably enjoyable gratuitous nudity thrust our way, this could've been an ABC Movie of the Week in the early 70's or a Lifetime channel flick to remind women which side of the fence they're supposed to play on. I ask you in all sincerity, friends - don't you just hate it when some imbecile ruins your exploitation entertainment by inserting a conflicting ideology into the proceedings, thereby abolishing the entire reason you signed on for? Me too: it's nothing short of criminal.Truth be told, it did have a few enjoyable trashy, tawdry moments here and there; the first half of the film was engaging in a tacky, cheesy way and fans of Miss Bisset will undoubtedly appreciate her solid performance at this early stage in her career and enjoy seeing parts of her physicality only dreamed about previously. The showgirl scenes are downright fun, the rock band ('The Ice Packs'- yeesch) segments are almost insipid (giving Marshall a never-overlooked chance to place his obnoxious sister, Penny, as one of the clich&eacute;d Plaster Caster girls, as if someone would find her erection-inducing in any way), the hotel sequence where she's first sexually compromised by an obnoxious brute is blatantly reprehensible, and from there it's all a downhill avalanche. It's touted here as a ""remarkable, neglected film"" - I'm thinking remarkably conflicted and neglected for good reason. And why 'The Grasshopper'? Jump this one and bag 'Day of the Locusts' instead...",3,This Chocolate-Covered Grasshopper Is No Delicacy...,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,4157,"['THE', 'GRASSHOPPER', '1969', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', 'directed', 'Jerry', 'Paris', ']', 'Part', 'exploitation', 'part', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'young', 'girl', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'small', 'town', 'British', 'Columbia', 'who', 'suburban', 'L.A.', 'unite', 'childhood', 'boyfriend', 'presumably', 'settle', 'down', 'out', ""n't"", 'want', 'settle', 'douchebag', 'understandably', 'up', 'Vegas', 'showgirl', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'commitment', 'issues', 'men', 'up', 'one', 'turnstile', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'date', 'marry', 'Vegas-style', 'wonder', 'divorce', 'rates', 'were/are', 'so', 'high', 'have', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'wretchedly', 'highlight', 'film', 'involved', 'rock', 'band', 'doing', 'massive', 'amounts', 'drugs', 'downward', 'spiral', 'kept', 'woman', 'rich', 'older', 'man', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'when', 'leave', 'wife', '30', 'years', 'marry', 'first', 'becoming', 'escort', 'finally', 'cheap', 'hooker', 'loser', 'boyfriend', 'pimp', 'ultimately', 'cash', ""'ve"", 'amassed', 'leaving', 'nowhere', 'nothing', 'drug', 'habit', 'old', 'adage', 'ai', ""n't"", 'easy', 'being', 'pretty', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'being', 'easy', 'Had', 'known', 'was', 'scripted', 'produced', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Jerry', 'Belson', 'pair', 'irretrievably', 'sophomoric', 'TV', 'hacks', 'responsible', ""'Happy"", 'Days', ""'Laverne"", 'Shirley', 'would', ""'ve"", 'known', 'what', 'expect', 'probably', 'passed', 'one', 'Parts', 'were', 'insufferable', 'namely', 'derivative', 'soundtrack', 'lifted', ""'Midnight"", 'Cowboy', 'uninspired', 'ran-out-of-ideas-while-promoting-our-own-agenda', 'final', 'act', 'insanely', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'coupled', 'archaic', 'cautionary', 'message', 'underlined', 'misgivings', 'put', 'forth', 'here', 'ladies', 'do', ""n't"", 'marry', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'kids', ""'re"", 'going', 'hell', 'handbasket', 'right', 'quick', 'having', 'settle', 'black', 'man', 'selling', 'old', 'codgers', 'next', 'nothing', 'oh', 'yeah', 'drug', 'habit', 'jail', 'time', 'So', 'conform', 'lose', 'was', 'third', 'option', 'back', 'then', 'world', 'many', 'options', 'optimism', ""'Let"", 'hang', 'out', 'era', 'likes', 'American', 'society', 'had', 'never', 'known', 'absolutely', 'mindboggling', 'message', 'rotten', 'racist', 'repressive', 'just', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'was', 'made', '1969', 'When', 'entire', 'world', 'was', 'engulfed', 'breaking', 'barriers', 'conventionality', ""'re"", 'subjected', '1950', 'repressive', 'admonition', 'straight', ""'Ozzie"", 'Harriet', 'WTF', 'sooo', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'happening', 'promoting', 'McCarthy', 'Eisenhower-era', 'policies', 'standards', 'were', ""n't"", 'several', 'rounds', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ABC', 'Movie', 'Week', 'early', '70', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'flick', 'remind', 'women', 'side', 'fence', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'play', 'ask', 'sincerity', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'hate', 'when', 'imbecile', 'exploitation', 'entertainment', 'inserting', 'conflicting', 'ideology', 'proceedings', 'thereby', 'abolishing', 'entire', 'reason', 'signed', 'Me', 'too', 'nothing', 'short', 'criminal.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'enjoyable', 'trashy', 'tawdry', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'engaging', 'tacky', 'cheesy', 'way', 'fans', 'Miss', 'Bisset', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'appreciate', 'solid', 'performance', 'early', 'stage', 'career', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'parts', 'physicality', 'only', 'dreamed', 'previously', 'showgirl', 'scenes', 'are', 'downright', 'fun', 'rock', 'band', ""'The"", 'Ice', ""Packs'-"", 'yeesch', 'segments', 'are', 'almost', 'insipid', 'giving', 'never-overlooked', 'chance', 'place', 'obnoxious', 'sister', 'Penny', 'one', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Plaster', 'Caster', 'girls', 'someone', 'would', 'find', 'erection-inducing', 'way', 'hotel', 'sequence', 'where', 'first', 'sexually', 'compromised', 'obnoxious', 'brute', 'blatantly', 'reprehensible', 'downhill', 'avalanche', 'touted', 'here', 'remarkable', 'neglected', 'film', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'remarkably', 'conflicted', 'neglected', 'good', 'reason', 'why', ""'The"", 'Grasshopper', 'Jump', 'one', 'bag', ""'Day"", 'Locusts', 'instead']",N/A
1265040,A3942G0XBGQHRW,B002EAYDZW,Greg Johnson,"[0, 0]","This is a slightly entertaining 1969 tale (directed by Jerry Paris) about a pretty Canadian girl (Jacqueline Bisset) who leaves her small town in BC and heads south to Las Vegas and LA in search of adventure and romance.  What she finds instead is a phobia for substance in her life.  But if you look closer at this film her situations are so crippling they are a major cause of her growing neurosis.  So as soon as she lands somewhere like a grasshopper then she will leave.  Until Tommy (Jim Brown).  Tommy is what Christine needs.  Stable, ambitious, strong, but in the shadow of his football career. He too lacks substance in his life and he knows it. The two marry in one of the worst Vegas weddings I have ever seen.  It is a wasteland  of smoke, plastic flowers, and scratchy records.  Soon Tommy and Christine meet Rosey Decker, a mobster covering as a construction giant.  Why Christine goes to Rosey's room dressed in a very flattering dress making sexy conversation and getting herself beaten by a thug is a big flaw in the film.  It makes no sense. There is no reason she should go to Rosey's private room to talk about Tommy's career when he obviously wants a roll in the hay with one of the cutest ladies in Vegas.  This eventually gets Tommy killed, adding to Christine's misery. The music in the film sounds sadistic to me: weak songs with squeaky voices seemingly to mock Christine for her inability to find a compass in her life.  So Christine takes another step down and is now out of control. So she takes the dive into drugs and prostitution.This movie has faint shadows of the children of the 1960's sometimes called the lost generation, with its defiance, rebellion, counter culture, and drugs.  Christine's persona does not include politics, or antiwar activities.  Christine does not fit entirely.  She has only the presence of worsening discontent that just relents. The last scenes are fun to watch as Christine uses a bit of svengali to get an airplane mechanic to do some skywriting for her.  This movie is a downer, but if you're in the mood you'll be OK.",3,...Getting lost,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,2085,"['slightly', 'entertaining', '1969', 'tale', 'directed', 'Jerry', 'Paris', 'pretty', 'Canadian', 'girl', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'BC', 'heads', 'south', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'LA', 'search', 'adventure', 'romance', 'What', 'instead', 'phobia', 'substance', 'life', 'look', 'closer', 'film', 'situations', 'are', 'so', 'crippling', 'are', 'major', 'cause', 'growing', 'neurosis', 'as', 'soon', 'somewhere', 'grasshopper', 'then', 'will', 'leave', 'Tommy', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Tommy', 'what', 'Christine', 'Stable', 'ambitious', 'strong', 'shadow', 'football', 'career', 'too', 'substance', 'life', 'two', 'marry', 'one', 'worst', 'Vegas', 'weddings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'wasteland', 'smoke', 'plastic', 'flowers', 'scratchy', 'records', 'Soon', 'Tommy', 'Christine', 'meet', 'Rosey', 'Decker', 'mobster', 'covering', 'construction', 'giant', 'Why', 'Christine', 'Rosey', 'room', 'dressed', 'very', 'flattering', 'dress', 'making', 'sexy', 'conversation', 'getting', 'beaten', 'thug', 'big', 'flaw', 'film', 'sense', 'reason', 'should', 'go', 'Rosey', 'private', 'room', 'talk', 'Tommy', 'career', 'when', 'obviously', 'roll', 'hay', 'one', 'cutest', 'ladies', 'Vegas', 'eventually', 'Tommy', 'killed', 'adding', 'Christine', 'misery', 'music', 'film', 'sadistic', 'weak', 'songs', 'squeaky', 'voices', 'seemingly', 'mock', 'Christine', 'inability', 'find', 'compass', 'life', 'Christine', 'step', 'down', 'now', 'control', 'dive', 'drugs', 'prostitution.This', 'movie', 'faint', 'shadows', 'children', '1960', 'sometimes', 'called', 'lost', 'generation', 'defiance', 'rebellion', 'counter', 'culture', 'drugs', 'Christine', 'persona', 'not', 'include', 'politics', 'antiwar', 'activities', 'Christine', 'not', 'fit', 'entirely', 'only', 'presence', 'worsening', 'discontent', 'just', 'relents', 'last', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Christine', 'bit', 'svengali', 'get', 'airplane', 'mechanic', 'do', 'skywriting', 'movie', 'downer', ""'re"", 'mood', ""'ll"", 'be', 'OK']",N/A

1265044,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,B002EAYDZW,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 2]","""The Grasshopper"" from 1970 was directed by the famous sitcom actor and director, Jerry Paris, whose first feature as director was Disney's ""Never a Dull Moment"" starring Dick Van Dyke in one of the studio's first ""adult"" pictures before letting out all the stops with their Touchstone company and the public's acceptance of permissiveness by Disney.  Disney did get in trouble even earlier when in his film ""Bon Voyage"" with Fred MacMurray, Disney showed streetwalkers while the family visited in Paris to the complaints of parents back in 1962.  ""The Grasshopper"" was one of Jacqueline Bisset's earlier roles for which she was nominated for a Golden Laurel Award and she does carry the picture along with Jim Brown.  Also in the cast are Joseph Cotton and Tim O'Kelley who had the lead opposite Boris Karloff in Peter Bogdanovich's ""Targets"" and many other recognizable faces but not so well known.  The story of the downward path of a nineteen year old girl and ending with her being 22 needs more from the imagination of the film-makers than there is as her peregrinations and her uninvolvement with anybody becomes tiresome and the score attributed to Maurice Jarre must be one of his worst coupled with a lot of rather annoying songs, many helped written by Al Kasha (who won Oscars for his songs for ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"").  The entire film is gratuitous and with ordinary ambitions and only occasionally insightful.  Only recommended if one is a fan of Jacqueline Bisset.
