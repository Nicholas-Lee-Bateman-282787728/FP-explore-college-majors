272481,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6301923782,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","""A Big Hand for the Little Lady"" revolves around the events concerning the latest annual high stakes poker game attended by five rich and unscrupulous men. The progress of the game is always a secret, but many in the town regard it as a big event and crave news of its progress. When a family passing through town gets delayed by a bad wagon wheel, the father (a reformed gambler) wants to join the game. He is allowed to when the rich men see a chance to clean him out. A couple of big surprise twists liven things up, however.The movie is a masterpiece of cinema. Most of the story takes place in a dark backroom of a western hotel, with just a few characters involved, yet it is completely compelling from start to finish. Henry Fonda and Jo Anne Woodward give great performances, but the poker players, including stalwarts such as Jason Robards and Charles Bickford, are really just as good. Paul Ford comes in late with his usual amusing bombastic performance, and Burgess Meredith plays a fun role as well.The end of the movie comes as a total surprise, twice. :-)It is a true cinema classic, and a must see film for all movie lovers.",5,Fun and surprising,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1140,"['Big', 'Hand', 'Little', 'Lady', 'events', 'concerning', 'latest', 'annual', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'attended', 'five', 'rich', 'unscrupulous', 'men', 'progress', 'game', 'always', 'secret', 'many', 'town', 'regard', 'big', 'event', 'crave', 'news', 'progress', 'When', 'family', 'passing', 'town', 'delayed', 'bad', 'wagon', 'wheel', 'father', 'reformed', 'gambler', 'join', 'game', 'allowed', 'when', 'rich', 'men', 'see', 'chance', 'clean', 'out', 'couple', 'big', 'surprise', 'twists', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'however.The', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'Most', 'story', 'place', 'dark', 'backroom', 'western', 'hotel', 'just', 'few', 'characters', 'involved', 'completely', 'compelling', 'start', 'finish', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Jo', 'Anne', 'Woodward', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'poker', 'players', 'including', 'stalwarts', 'such', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'late', 'usual', 'amusing', 'bombastic', 'performance', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'fun', 'role', 'well.The', 'end', 'movie', 'total', 'surprise', 'twice', 'true', 'cinema', 'classic', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'movie', 'lovers']",N/A

272483,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301923782,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","What a cast of characters in A Big Hand for the Little Lady: Henry Drummond, a rich and irascible rancher who put his daughter's wedding on hold just as the vows were starting; Otto Habershaw, a slick, handsome and morally questionable lawyer. Habershaw left a client probably to hang when he ran from the courthouse and jumped on his horse just as he was supposed to sum up for the defense; Benson Tropp, wealthiest undertaker in the region, who has no use for women unless he's burying them; Dennis Wilcox, another wealthy rancher, a big, loud man who enjoys joking at other's expense; and Jesse Buford, small, aging and just as wealthy. He, Wilcox and all the others are sticklers for the rules. High stakes poker rules, that is.And what a cast: Jason Robards (Drummond), Kevin McCarthy (Habershaw), Charles Bickford (Tropp), Robert Middleton (Wilcox) and John Qualen (Buford). Plus Burgess Meredith as Doc Joseph Scully, a man getting old who is tired of saving people and getting produce as payment, and Paul Ford as C. P. Ballinger, a banker who knows the value of collateral.The five are poker players, and for each of the last 17 years nothing, absolutely nothing, has stood in the way of their annual game. They hold it in the back room of a saloon and hotel in Laredo. It's become a legend in the territory for the money they've lost and won They're just starting the first hand when into town comes a hard-luck family on a wagon with a busted wheel, on their way to start again on 40 acres near San Antonio. Meredith (Henry Fonda) is a nice man trying to do his best. He's also a fool for cards, a man who has lost so much of his family's hard-earned money that his wife, Mary (Joanne Woodward) made him solemnly promise that he'd never touch cards again. Mary wants to believe him. Their 12-year-old son is about to get a lesson of a lifetime.It's not long, while Mary takes the wagon to the blacksmith, that Meredith has begged for a chance just to watch the game. He can't help licking his lips. His son can't help begging his pa not to. Soon Meredith has taken the family's $4,000 stake, all the money they have in the world, to get in the game. You know the rest...he wagers and he loses.Wait. He wagers, alright. He has the best hand he's ever been dealt in his life...but he's about to be out-raised. He begs for a loan so he can stay in the game...and has a heart attack. It's up to Mary, back from the blacksmith and who has never played a game of poker in her life, to convince the five hard-bitten players that it's only fair that she be allowed to play her husband's hand. The five bicker a bit but reluctantly agree, and are stunned when Mary takes the hand and marches to the bank, with them following, to convince C. P. Ballinger to use the hand as collateral for a loan on her bet.Does the movie have a more satisfactory ending than a dead Henry Fonda clutching his heart, a tearful Joanne Woodward seeing these committed poker players take every cent her family has? Oh, yes, indeed. No one dies, and there is one of the most satisfying endings, with a twist and a sting, you'll ever hope to see.What makes this movie so engaging - after all, it's basically 1 hour and 35 minutes of a poker game - is that twist at the end and the skill and charm of the actors. As good as Fonda and the others are, the movie really sits up when Woodward, Robards and McCarthy are doing their stuff. Woodward is so skilled an actress that I sometimes think we take her for granted. That would be an unwise action in this movie. Robards, who was probably America's greatest stage actor in the last 60 years and one of it's best screen actors, turns Henry Drummond into a fine mixture of frustration and selfishness. Robards can make us smile in sympathy over even an unlikeable character like Drummond. See just how good an actor Robards was with his performances inEugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten (Broadway Theatre Archive)andEugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (Broadway Theatre Archive). Kevin McCarthy, a fine actor with great charm, could play weak, strong, sleaze or integrity with equal believability. Here, he's all charm and quite willing to make a move on Mary, but he holds back, surprising even himself. I don't want to short-change Fonda. As Meredith, he's stuck for most of the movie playing a weak man in the grip of poker fever, and henpecked as well. He captures our sympathy even while we pity the poor man.A Big Hand for the Little Lady is something of a one-joke movie, but it's a first-class, clever joke with a great cast. The DVD looks just fine.

Roberts ""movie buff""","[21, 25]","""A Big Hand for the Little Lady"" is a great film which on the face of it appears to be a Western but how can it be when there is no gunfight on the town's main street, no saloon fights or bar room brawls, no sheriff to keep order and put the bad guys in jail, no Indians, in fact, not much ""action"" of any kind that would usually be associated with the Western film. So what is the appeal of this unusual film where most of the story takes place during a long drawn out card game in the back room of the town's hotel? The tension mounts as stranger in town Henry Fonda is tempted to get into the high stakes poker game with some wealthy cattlemen after he had promised his wife he would give up gambling. Obviously, he does join the game and is convinced that he has been dealt a hand that can't lose but the other players in the game also have good hands that each one feels could be the winner. Who is bluffing who? Can Fonda risk losing all the family savings of his wife and young son? Will the stakes go too high for Fonda to stay in the game? Can wife Joanne Woodward persuade Fonda to see sense and walk away? Surprise is piled upon surprise as the game progresses and the final twist is a beauty.Some favourite lines from the film:Jason Robards Jr (to Henry Fonda): ""That's four hundred dollars to you. And you know something mister, you ain't got enough left to stay in this pot"".Henry Fonda (to Joanne Woodward): ""I got a hand of cards here comes once in a lifetime"".Joanne Woodward (to card players): ""How do you play this game?"".Paul Ford (to Joanne Woodward): ""Nobody sees those cards but you and C. P. Ballinger"".What holds your interest is the finely plotted screenplay by Sidney Carroll and the magnificent acting from the entire cast. Henry Fonda and Joanne Woodward in the lead roles are admirably supported by Jason Robards Jr, Charles Bickford, Kevin McCarthy, Burgess Meredith, Robert Middleton and Paul Ford. Competently directed by Fielder Cook it grips your attention throughout and then packs a totally unexpected surprise ending that will delight you!! Upon release in the U.K. the title was changed to ""Big Deal at Dodge City"" which was a strange choice as the action takes place in Laredo.

272490,AU10YGO10MUCA,6301923782,Gary Lee,"[1, 1]","If you're not familiar with this little classic, I urge you not to read anything that even hints at a spoiler before you see it (including Amazon's rather unenthusiastic Editorial Review above, but--probably too late if you're already reading this review).  It would be a shame to ruin the whopper of a surprise ending, or any of the other startling developments along the way in this fresh and inventive Western comedy.  From the opening credits, the sure-footed plot grabs the viewer and just gets more and more engrossing, until that climactic twist.  The story of an exclusive annual poker game that spins out of control, it boasts great dialogue in the repartee around the table, a cast of vivid characters, fine pacing, and top notch performances by all, right down to the bit players.  Paul Ford, that consummate scene stealer, here too carries off the picture as an irascible banker.  But he gets plenty of competition from the rest of the cast.  Henry Fonda, a master at portraying anxious, conflicted characters, grows increasingly frantic as a farmer with a gambling problem (strange that Hitchcock only used him once, as an innocent musician accused of a crime in THE WRONG MAN.  Fonda would have been compelling in Jimmy Stewart's parts in VERTIGO, in REAR WINDOW, in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  But I digress.).  Kevin McCarthy, John Qualen, Robert Middleton, Charles Bickford, and Jason Robards, Jr. each play distinct, flinty but likeable rogues as Fonda's adversaries in the game (although Robards is at full volume a little too much).  Burgess Meredith does a memorable turn as the put-upon town doctor.  As the little lady of the title, Joanne Woodward shines as Fonda's delicate, long-suffering wife who shows her steel when she must take matters in hand with these raucous men to save the family fortune.  As other reviewers have noted, it would have been fun to see her hubby Paul Newman as one of the exasperated card sharks, but he had wait until THE STING for his turn at high stakes poker.

272493,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301923782,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","A BIG HAND FOR THE LITTLE LADY, out in 1966, is both a character study and an offbeat comedy western, and if you're a big fan of shoot-'em-up oaters, then you'd best step away from this one, mister, and with alacrity. The participants in this picture tend to slap cardboard more so than leather. Me, I reveled in this film and its cast of veteran character actors. I especially loved watching Joanne Woodward go to work. And the fabulous Jason Robards.In this Old West caper, you shouldn't knock yourself for despising the Henry Fonda role. It only means that Fonda is working his craft to great effect. He plays Meredith, a weak-willed husband and reformed card playing addict who puts the lie to the ""reformed"" bit. En route to a homesteading in San Antonio, he and his wife Mary (Woodward) and their young son make a pit stop at the tiny Texas town of Laredo to fix their busted wagon. It's simply bad joss that their sojourn coincides with the annual high stakes poker game being hotly contested by the five richest and most ruthless men in the territory.Before setting off for the local blacksmith, Mary reluctantly grants permission for Meredith to watch (and ONLY watch!) the marathon game being conducted in the back room of a saloon. She returns to learn that her husband had just lost their startup stake of $4000, and needing $500 more just to stay in the game. Mary is shocked and devastated. We're not. You and me, we already had the measure of her husband. I mean, his name is Meredith!Meredith believes that he's got the holy of holies in terms of an unbeatable hand. Except that there's no more money to enable him to stay in. To complete his emasculation, Meredith suffers a stroke and it's up to Mary - who doesn't know the first thing about poker - to finish the hand... if only she could first come up with the necessary $500. She does what any sensible woman would do. She goes to the bank for a loan. And I should probably stop right there with the plot blow-by-blow. The story's too good to spoil wantonly.Henry Fonda is in here and his sweaty face and fawning behavior are good for conveying the rabid, desperate inadequacies of his character, but an excellent Joanne Woodward carries the film and Jason Robards steals the scenes. I could've told you he'd steal the scenes. He does that. Robards plays Henry Drummond, a wealthy landowner and a dedicated poker player who abandoned his daughter's wedding rather than be late for the annual contest. His incessant vicious needling of Meredith should've made you dislike him, except that Meredith is, by design, so unsympathetic and Robards oozes such a glowering charisma that he manages to overcome the viewer's animosity, or this viewer's animosity, anyway.Kevin McCarthy also turns in a terrific performance as a defense attorney who tore away from the courthouse to join the poker game just as he was about to deliver his closing argument for his possibly gallows-destined client. The film implies that the attorney is interested in Mary, but nothing really comes of that. Burgess Meredith has a bit part as a disenchanted doctor.The big men at the poker table all take turns being blustery at and dismissive of Meredith and Mary, and so from that angle there's incentive to feel good at the final turn of events. A BIG HAND FOR THE LITTLE LADY gives you plenty of chances to laugh, and so what if some of the chuckles are at Meredith's expense (that tool)? But Joanne Woodward makes you invest in her character, and, boy, does she ever earn those later ""gotcha"" moments. She ends up humbling the big men at the table, even inspires one, a confirmed misogynist, to doff his hat to her, even transforms Robards' sniping malcontent into a pensive, wistful person.And I haven't even mentioned the eye-opening final plot twist.

The banker, Paul Ford (playing JP Ballinger),  says ""Ossa on Pelion, madam"" accusing her of piling one mountain of flummery on another. I have used that expression numerous times since I first saw this movie in the early 70's in a dormitory on one of those old projectors people had. I finally found out what Ossa and Pelion were.

272499,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6301923782,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","Though the DVD cover art, and most of the posters I've seen for this film promise something rather sexy, don't be mislead.  Not that A BIG HAND FOR THE LITTLE LADY, directed by Fielder Cook - whose best-known film this probably is - doesn't have some femininity, in the form of Joanne Woodward, but if you are looking for something salacious, you won't find it.  What you will find instead is one long con-game of a film revolving around poker, and set in Laredo, Texas around 1900.  It begins with a montage of several men riding or taking stages, seemingly in great hurry, and eventually converging on the town.  The men are Drummond (Jason Robards), Tropp (Charles Bickford), Habershaw (Kevin McCarthy) and Buford (Jesse Qualen), and they all meet in a backroom of a hotel/saloon with Wilcox (Robert Middleton) for a once-a-year hand of poker.  These are the richest men in the territory, and they'll let nothing stand in the way of their game - not even weddings or court cases - a fact pointed out by the cynical Doc Scully (Burgess Meredith).  It's a game that allows no interruptions, no postponements, no limits and no exceptions to the rules that they've all agreed on.Until, of course, they ARE interrupted by a couple of settlers, Meredith and Mary (Henry Fonda and Joanne Woodward) and their young boy Jackie (Jean-Michel Michenaud).  The family's wagon has broken down, and they need it fixed - right on the very day of this big poker game.  And Meredith apparently has a gambling problem, but he assures Mary that all he wants to do is watch the game.  Yeah...we know how that will turn out.  I haven't seen an enormous number of films about gambling, but I have seen a few, and it's not usually a big leap to guess in a film like this that things aren't going to go in the straight line that the game's participants think they're going in.  It's not hard to guess that there's going to be a scam here - the only real question is, who's involved, besides (one probably guesses) the naive-seeming couple?  Could it be the Doctor, who seems rather intemperately disposed towards the rich gamblers?  The owner of the hotel, who clearly enjoys the notoriety - but perhaps might enjoy a larger stake in the winnings?  Or perhaps Mr. Habershaw, who seems much more kindly disposed to the intruders - especially the feminine member of the trio - than the rest of his high-rolling companions.There's nothing particularly fresh or novel about the way the storyline develops - I doubt it was all that new in 1966 either - and I for one am typically not so well disposed towards the clean-scrubbed 60s westerns where everything looks far too clean and bright; the same year's remake of STAGECOACH comes to mind - but the actors really go a long ways towards making this enjoyable, if not particularly memorable.  Fonda does the desperate, diseased gambler part well enough and Woodward is fine as the wife who is clearly not as innocent as she makes out, but the real honors go to Jason Robards at his cynical, sarcastic best - his scene towards the end of the film with his prospective son-in-law is as fine a piece of bitter hilarity as I've seen in a while; this is really Robards at the top of his always-impressive game.  Paul Ford as the sour bank manager who Meredith goes crying to is also loads of fun.

272504,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,6301923782,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 1]","Poker and the Wild West, they go together like horses and wagons. And the West (or plot) doesn't get any 'wilder' than in this fun movie that is filled with twists.I won't give away any more of the plot, it's too good. You have to experience the many discoveries for yourself. But I do have to say, the game of poker has a lot to do with it. I think the title gives that away.Okay, first, it's a Western where NOBODY GETS SHOT! Yeah, that actually happened from time to time in the Old West! So, instead of gunslingers, we get some rough looking cattlemen, but it's all for show. Cow-folk don't have to be nasty or violent, some of them are probably very nice people! The film also captures all the scenery and trappings of the West, but none of the violence.The film has great color and the costumes are authentic. The dirt and grime, the sweat is obviously there. The opening music is reminiscent of works by Copeland (nice touch if you've ever heard his ""Billy The Kid Suite""). So the film has all the right atmosphere.Then there are the actors.Henry Fonda is a fine actor and always a treat. He plays his role here VERY carefully. This film is a comedy of sorts (for a while, it seems deadly serious -- part of the twists in it). So Fonda's character, Meredith, is at once a bumpkin and pathetic gamble-holic, a loser who is going down before the poker game is over. Or so it might seem. But you have to watch Fonda closely. In a few shots, he shows 'his hand' and we get a suspicion about his true nature, but just a twinge.Joanne Woodward as Mary. Woodward is always a delight on screen. She's hardly recognizable in the beginning and plays her role perfectly. Watch as her character develops over time from naively innocent and the more familiar more cunning Woodward emerges. It's a pleasure to see her innocence and then discover more about her at the end.Kevin McCarthy - as Otto, one of the gamblers in the poker game, is another winner, so to speak. He's a bit lusty, has his eye on Mary, but turns out to be a real --- well, you have to watch the movie to discover that!We also get a very cantankerous Jason Robards Jr. as Henry Drummond, a man who takes his poker game very seriously and is intent on playing the game all the way through. He's a no nonsense guy, who has a deeper side, which also is nicely revealed after what SEEMS to be the climax of the movie. He seems to be sweating all through the film and we can almost smell it as well as the cigars he loves to chomp on through gritted teeth.Paul Ford, a great veteran, appears later in the film and is very convincing in his role. When he appears, we begin to see the lighter side of this sort of comedy. Up until his entrance, I was thinking the movie was going to be a downer.Other great stars, including Burgess Meredith are in the film, and it is worth watching just to see these folks strut their stuff on the screen. We'll never see the like of such acting talent again, certainly not brought together so well as in this ensemble cast.Now as to the tone of the thing.It is loaded with twists. At first it seems very dark and brooding. You kind of know it's a comedy (because it's billed as one) but it's hard to tell for the first half. It could go both ways here, from the tragic story of a losing gambler caught in his addiction, to one of how people can gang up on the downtrodden... take advantage of the weak, to the story of a man who betrays his family to feed his addiction. That's the hook to get you into the film. Exactly what IS the message here?However, things take a decided turn half way through and then we get the idea that maybe its a film about how even the downtrodden might get a break, until the end when all is revealed and we get the belly laughs and the ""GOTCHA"" that this movie was going for all along. It's a cinematic prank on the audience, and a well played one at that, as subtle and tense as -- the game of poker itself!I enjoyed the movie very much, great acting, very carefully balanced plot and action, great atmosphere and a Wild West unlike what we would expect.This is a movie that kept me on my toes, and kept me watching.Westerns are still a viable vehicle for fiction. They may be a bit out of favor these days, but the old West still has a Romanticism about it, and cowboys can be heroes in many ways. No giant robots, of course, but you can't have everything.And not a bullet in sight--but don't worry, there are horses--gotta have horses!Enjoy the film.",5,Fun in the Wild West -- With a Twist,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,4476,"['Poker', 'Wild', 'West', 'go', 'together', 'like', 'horses', 'wagons', 'West', 'plot', ""n't"", 'get', ""'wilder"", 'fun', 'movie', 'filled', 'twists.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'too', 'good', 'have', 'experience', 'many', 'discoveries', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'game', 'poker', 'lot', 'do', 'think', 'title', 'away.Okay', 'first', 'Western', 'where', 'NOBODY', 'GETS', 'SHOT', 'Yeah', 'actually', 'happened', 'time', 'time', 'Old', 'West', 'So', 'instead', 'gunslingers', 'get', 'rough', 'looking', 'cattlemen', 'show', 'Cow-folk', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'nasty', 'violent', 'are', 'probably', 'very', 'nice', 'people', 'film', 'also', 'scenery', 'trappings', 'West', 'none', 'violence.The', 'film', 'great', 'color', 'costumes', 'are', 'authentic', 'dirt', 'grime', 'sweat', 'obviously', 'there', 'opening', 'music', 'reminiscent', 'works', 'Copeland', 'nice', 'touch', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Suite', 'film', 'right', 'atmosphere.Then', 'are', 'actors.Henry', 'Fonda', 'fine', 'actor', 'always', 'treat', 'role', 'here', 'VERY', 'carefully', 'film', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'while', 'deadly', 'serious', 'part', 'twists', 'So', 'Fonda', 'character', 'Meredith', 'once', 'bumpkin', 'pathetic', 'gamble-holic', 'loser', 'who', 'going', 'down', 'poker', 'game', 'over', 'might', 'seem', 'have', 'watch', 'Fonda', 'closely', 'few', 'shots', ""'his"", 'hand', 'get', 'suspicion', 'true', 'nature', 'just', 'twinge.Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Mary', 'Woodward', 'always', 'delight', 'screen', 'hardly', 'recognizable', 'beginning', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Watch', 'character', 'time', 'naively', 'innocent', 'more', 'familiar', 'more', 'cunning', 'Woodward', 'pleasure', 'see', 'innocence', 'then', 'discover', 'more', 'end.Kevin', 'McCarthy', 'Otto', 'one', 'gamblers', 'poker', 'game', 'winner', 'so', 'speak', 'bit', 'lusty', 'eye', 'Mary', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'well', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'discover', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'cantankerous', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'Henry', 'Drummond', 'man', 'who', 'poker', 'game', 'very', 'seriously', 'intent', 'playing', 'game', 'way', 'nonsense', 'guy', 'who', 'deeper', 'side', 'also', 'nicely', 'revealed', 'what', 'SEEMS', 'be', 'climax', 'movie', 'be', 'sweating', 'film', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'as', 'well', 'cigars', 'chomp', 'gritted', 'teeth.Paul', 'Ford', 'great', 'veteran', 'later', 'film', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'When', 'begin', 'see', 'lighter', 'side', 'sort', 'comedy', 'entrance', 'was', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'downer.Other', 'great', 'stars', 'including', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'are', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'folks', 'strut', 'stuff', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'like', 'such', 'acting', 'talent', 'again', 'certainly', 'not', 'brought', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'ensemble', 'cast.Now', 'tone', 'thing.It', 'loaded', 'twists', 'first', 'very', 'dark', 'brooding', 'kind', 'know', 'comedy', 'billed', 'one', 'hard', 'tell', 'first', 'half', 'could', 'go', 'ways', 'here', 'tragic', 'story', 'losing', 'gambler', 'caught', 'addiction', 'one', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'gang', 'up', 'downtrodden', 'take', 'advantage', 'weak', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'family', 'feed', 'addiction', 'hook', 'get', 'film', 'Exactly', 'what', 'message', 'here', 'However', 'things', 'take', 'decided', 'turn', 'half', 'way', 'then', 'get', 'idea', 'film', 'how', 'even', 'downtrodden', 'might', 'get', 'break', 'end', 'when', 'revealed', 'get', 'belly', 'GOTCHA', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'along', 'cinematic', 'prank', 'audience', 'well', 'played', 'one', 'subtle', 'tense', 'game', 'poker', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'great', 'acting', 'very', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'plot', 'action', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'Wild', 'West', 'what', 'would', 'expect.This', 'movie', 'kept', 'toes', 'kept', 'watching.Westerns', 'are', 'still', 'viable', 'vehicle', 'fiction', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'favor', 'days', 'old', 'West', 'still', 'Romanticism', 'cowboys', 'can', 'be', 'heroes', 'many', 'ways', 'giant', 'robots', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything.And', 'not', 'bullet', 'sight', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'horses', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'horses', 'Enjoy', 'film']",N/A
