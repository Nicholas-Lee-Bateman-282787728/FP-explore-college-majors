1531901,A2XJAMHZL2QHP8,B007JNZYPM,80's TV Fan,"[30, 36]","Like many fans of this series, I have been waiting twenty-five years for the commercial release of ""Rags to Riches.""  Now that this day has come, I can't help but be extremely disappointed with the way Image Entertainment haphazardly hurried this release with no concern to the quality of the product.  At the top of my list of complaints is the fact that the pilot is not the final version as it was originally broadcast.  The pilot released on this DVD is a ""rough cut"" and a ""work in progress.""  Which explains all of the film splice lines/scratches and rough audio mix. Viewers may notice that it is titled ""Rags AND Riches"" (a pre-release title which was later changed.) It is also missing the actors/producer credits at the beginning as well as the end credits. Also not included is the popular song ""School is In"" as well as most of the well remembered score and music cues (specifically at the commercial breaks).Should buyers wish to see the finessed final pilot the way they fell in love with it originally, it was recently released correctly on the German DVD which can be purchased at amazon.de (but you will need a region free player) and the final version was also released correctly two different times on VHS.",1,"FIVE Star show, ZERO Star Release",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1225,"['many', 'fans', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'commercial', 'release', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'Now', 'day', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'way', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'haphazardly', 'hurried', 'release', 'concern', 'quality', 'product', 'top', 'list', 'complaints', 'fact', 'pilot', 'not', 'final', 'version', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'pilot', 'released', 'DVD', 'rough', 'cut', 'work', 'progress', 'Which', 'film', 'splice', 'lines/scratches', 'rough', 'audio', 'mix', 'Viewers', 'may', 'notice', 'titled', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'pre-release', 'title', 'was', 'later', 'changed', 'also', 'missing', 'actors/producer', 'credits', 'beginning', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'credits', 'Also', 'not', 'included', 'popular', 'song', 'School', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'well', 'remembered', 'score', 'music', 'cues', 'specifically', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'buyers', 'wish', 'see', 'finessed', 'final', 'pilot', 'way', 'fell', 'love', 'originally', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'correctly', 'German', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'amazon.de', 'will', 'need', 'region', 'free', 'player', 'final', 'version', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'correctly', 'two', 'different', 'times', 'VHS']",Rags to Riches: The Complete Series

1531906,A27N04GDPG1P1N,B007JNZYPM,ljg765,"[11, 11]","I've been waiting decades to finally get a decent home copy of this series. It's one of the few left that haven't seen a DVD release so when I saw this was being made, I immediately preordered the set. I'm still glad to have it, as I only had a VHS copy from TV of the pilot that was degrading fast, but am very disappointed in the content and quality.Watching the pilot, it's filled with scratches and blobs and sometimes the sound is missing. The title is even wrong! (reading a previous review, this is a work in progress copy and not the final one). This means I still cannot get rid of my old VHS tape. I doubt that it will receive a decent release either. How hard would it have been to get the actual pilot for this set?As someone said, there are no real extras. Two badly produced bonus trailers are the only extra content and limited to disc one only. I'm still not sure why they included them...are they coming to DVD? Are they coming to Blu-ray?If you're a fan of this show, you'll buy it cause there isn't anything else out there, but wait for a good sale--no reason to spend anymore than needed on this poor release.",3,Rags to Riches,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1129,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'decades', 'finally', 'get', 'decent', 'home', 'copy', 'series', 'one', 'few', 'left', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'release', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'immediately', 'preordered', 'set', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'have', 'only', 'had', 'VHS', 'copy', 'TV', 'pilot', 'was', 'degrading', 'fast', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'content', 'quality.Watching', 'pilot', 'filled', 'scratches', 'blobs', 'sometimes', 'sound', 'missing', 'title', 'even', 'wrong', 'reading', 'previous', 'review', 'work', 'progress', 'copy', 'not', 'final', 'one', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'doubt', 'will', 'receive', 'decent', 'release', 'either', 'How', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'get', 'actual', 'pilot', 'set', 'someone', 'said', 'are', 'real', 'extras', 'Two', 'badly', 'produced', 'trailers', 'are', 'only', 'extra', 'content', 'limited', 'disc', 'one', 'only', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'included', 'are', 'coming', 'DVD', 'Are', 'coming', 'Blu-ray', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'cause', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'wait', 'good', 'sale', 'reason', 'spend', 'anymore', 'needed', 'poor', 'release']",Rags to Riches: The Complete Series
1531907,A3RQZPO3A425SL,B007JNZYPM,Luna,"[5, 6]","Growing up I used to watch the VHS movie &#34;Rags to Riches&#34;.  I never knew it was made into a TV show!  So, I bought the series to see if it was anything like the movie.  (I already own the movie on DVD, copied from a VHS.)  I never expected to see the movie as the pilot episode to the series.  Althought the TV series was interesting, the pilot episode has issues.  I bought this product from 3 different sources thinking I might get lucky.  Nope, all three copies, from three different sources, had the same issue.  I'm afraid no matter where you buy this product, you too will have this issue with the pilot episode, but ONLY the pilot episode.  The copy I have is so much better in picture then the copy on the series.  As I watched the pilot episode for the first time, I noticed black lines and black spots popping up constantly.  Also, the volume was a roller coater, contantly going up and down.  This one episode is just in bad shape.  The other episodes are all just fine.  Since the pilot episode was giving me this problem, I returned the item twice.  Now, I'm done; just gonna keep my movie copy so I can watch the pilot epsiode without the black lines and black spots and audio going in and out.  I've wlatched all the discs from the copy I bought from Amazon.com, no more problems.  So, if you like the TV series, I recommend getting this, but make sure you get the movie (pilot episode) seperately if you can not handle the roughness of the pictureand audio.",4,Movie turned TV Show,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,1481,"['Growing', 'up', 'used', 'watch', 'VHS', 'movie', '34', 'Rags', 'Riches', '34', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'So', 'bought', 'series', 'see', 'was', 'anything', 'movie', 'already', 'own', 'movie', 'DVD', 'copied', 'VHS', 'never', 'expected', 'see', 'movie', 'pilot', 'episode', 'series', 'Althought', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'interesting', 'pilot', 'episode', 'issues', 'bought', 'product', '3', 'different', 'sources', 'thinking', 'might', 'get', 'lucky', 'Nope', 'three', 'copies', 'three', 'different', 'sources', 'had', 'same', 'issue', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'matter', 'where', 'buy', 'product', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'issue', 'pilot', 'episode', 'ONLY', 'pilot', 'episode', 'copy', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'then', 'copy', 'series', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'first', 'time', 'noticed', 'black', 'lines', 'black', 'spots', 'popping', 'up', 'constantly', 'Also', 'volume', 'was', 'roller', 'coater', 'contantly', 'going', 'up', 'down', 'one', 'episode', 'just', 'bad', 'shape', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'giving', 'problem', 'returned', 'item', 'twice', 'Now', ""'m"", 'done', 'just', 'gon', 'keep', 'movie', 'copy', 'can', 'watch', 'pilot', 'epsiode', 'black', 'lines', 'black', 'spots', 'audio', 'going', ""'ve"", 'wlatched', 'discs', 'copy', 'bought', 'Amazon.com', 'more', 'problems', 'So', 'like', 'TV', 'series', 'recommend', 'getting', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'movie', 'pilot', 'episode', 'seperately', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'roughness', 'pictureand', 'audio']",Rags to Riches: The Complete Series
