956912,A29YS9QSGOKS4O,B000CCZRB8,"Carolyn ""Dedicated Yaoi Fan.""","[2, 2]","Though I gave this DVD 4 Stars I'm a little disappointed with the lack of extras and lack of episodes on a disc.For an Anime series that has more then 300 episodes, you'd think they'd put more then just 3 episodes a disc (look at Rurouni Kenshin, 40+ DVDs because it has so many episodes and there's only 3 episodes a disc). Not only but $19.99 for just 3 episodes and almost no extras is just a rip off. The extras include trailers for other Anime and production art. That's about it for DVDs 1 and 2.I first viewed One Piece about a year ago when it first came out as the English Dub version and I have to agree with other angry fans about how it's been butchered. Now that I've found out about the 40+ episodes been removed or cut because the company who licensed it want it for `kids' even though in Japan it's not aimed at kids.I'd love both the original version and the edited version for sale on the same disc (then it'd be worth what they expect you to pay) and it'd make so many fans of the ORIGINAL series happy.I'd like to see what's so different between the edited and original version (I already know about the swearing and violence).Don't get me wrong though, I love the edited version, it's really funny and Luffy is the coolest! This group of episodes (4-6) introduces us to Luffy's past with Shanks, Buggy the Clown and Nami joining the crew. And that's about it for such a small group of episodes.",4,Both versions would be better...,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1415,"['gave', 'DVD', '4', 'Stars', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'extras', 'lack', 'episodes', 'disc.For', 'Anime', 'series', 'more', 'then', '300', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'put', 'more', 'then', 'just', '3', 'episodes', 'disc', 'look', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', '40+', 'DVDs', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'disc', 'Not', 'only', '19.99', 'just', '3', 'episodes', 'almost', 'extras', 'just', 'rip', 'off', 'extras', 'include', 'trailers', 'other', 'Anime', 'production', 'art', 'DVDs', '1', '2.I', 'first', 'viewed', 'One', 'Piece', 'year', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'English', 'Dub', 'version', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'angry', 'fans', 'how', 'been', 'butchered', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'found', '40+', 'episodes', 'been', 'removed', 'cut', 'company', 'who', 'licensed', 'want', 'kids', 'even', 'Japan', 'not', 'aimed', 'kids.I', ""'d"", 'love', 'original', 'version', 'edited', 'version', 'sale', 'same', 'disc', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'worth', 'what', 'expect', 'pay', ""'d"", 'make', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'ORIGINAL', 'series', 'happy.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'what', 'so', 'different', 'edited', 'original', 'version', 'already', 'know', 'swearing', 'violence', '.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'edited', 'version', 'really', 'funny', 'Luffy', 'coolest', 'group', 'episodes', '4-6', 'Luffy', 'past', 'Shanks', 'Buggy', 'Clown', 'Nami', 'joining', 'crew', 'small', 'group', 'episodes']","One Piece, Vol. 2 - The Circus Comes To Town"

Thompson,"[7, 10]","I always find it funny that the 12 year old fans of the homeland versions (US or what have you) always enjoy the funtastic little things thrown in by 4Kids or other similar companies.  Probably because they are the suckers that are being targeted?If you really have an open mind towards anime in general, this show is very action packed and also much more comedic in its original format.  Although not many people die in this show, there is a hefty amount of blood and violence to go around.  Proving that One Piece was made for (at the very least) early and mid teens.  Not 8-12 year olds.  Oh well, this is life.  America has been butchering good foreign shows for ages.  I used to like a lot of this kind of stuff too when I was younger...then I grew up.  Too bad for me I never grew out of the teenager phase (almost 25 now).Who knows, maybe one day someone will make laws against this kind of sadness from even starting.

Everything else pales when compared. The horrors of the 4kids dub are also well documented. But let me remind you, that there were those of us not yet able to reach the anime treasures in all their greatness and this was the best we could have at our time. The times changed, and with them changed our opportunities. Eventually a more improved, if somewhat imperfect, replacement came along that brought with it the original greatness. Now we give our thanks that we were, at the very least, made aware of this great treasure. We also give thanks that the CP9 Saga is within reach, for everything that comes after is nothing less than a celebration of continued greatness. We are in a time where perfection is closer than it has ever been, even if it came from such humble beginnings.Kaizo ko Ore wa naru!",5,"One Piece, in all its forms, is to be treasured!",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,906,"['hate', 'unnecessary', 'here', 'undisputed', 'fact', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'unmatched', 'Everything', 'else', 'when', 'compared', 'horrors', '4kids', 'dub', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'documented', 'let', 'remind', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'able', 'reach', 'anime', 'treasures', 'greatness', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'time', 'times', 'changed', 'changed', 'opportunities', 'Eventually', 'more', 'improved', 'somewhat', 'imperfect', 'replacement', 'came', 'along', 'brought', 'original', 'greatness', 'Now', 'give', 'thanks', 'were', 'very', 'least', 'made', 'aware', 'great', 'treasure', 'also', 'give', 'thanks', 'CP9', 'Saga', 'reach', 'everything', 'nothing', 'less', 'celebration', 'continued', 'greatness', 'are', 'time', 'where', 'perfection', 'closer', 'ever', 'been', 'even', 'came', 'such', 'humble', 'beginnings.Kaizo', 'ko', 'Ore', 'wa', 'naru']","One Piece, Vol. 2 - The Circus Comes To Town"

Well as much hate 4Kids gets, they just poorly reasearched this anime and I'm pretty sure they would have given up the license at the drop of a pin. But they were stuck with it from 2004 to 2007, so they made the best that they could. I got hooked onto the franchise starting with this dub and when the license was dropped and then picked up by FUNimation, I still watched it.

956917,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000CCZRB8,Simon,"[3, 6]","American One Piece is a mess. If 4Kids was expecting this series to catch fire as the next Pokemon, they seriously shot themselves in the foot when they opted to leave out the original music, hire bland voice actors, and generally butcher and water down the scripts to death. Some edits are understandable for saturday morning standards (though One Piece arguably isnt a saturday morning show), others just feel like 4Kids pointlessly wasting money.I will give credit where it's due though. Unless 4Kids went back and pulled a ""George Lucas,"" one of the edits on this disc is the infamous ""hammer gun"", a bizzare looking contraption that replaces a flintlock pistol a character holds to a child's head. The hammer gun is *very* badly edited in, but whoever came up with and executed the idea deserves points for thinking outside the box in a hopeless situation. It's in the running for best laughably bad edit of modern anime standards, and you owe yourself a rental if you haven't seen it.I can't, in good conscience, recommend you watch the original Japanese version of One Piece, because there is currently no legal way to obtain it in North America. I will then highly recommend you read the Viz manga instead, which is fairly accurate to the original material. Rent this disc for the hammer gun, and hope and pray 4Kids never gets a chance to butcher anything this badly again.",1,At least the edit artists are creative,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1382,"['American', 'One', 'Piece', 'mess', '4Kids', 'was', 'expecting', 'series', 'catch', 'fire', 'next', 'Pokemon', 'seriously', 'shot', 'foot', 'when', 'opted', 'leave', 'out', 'original', 'music', 'hire', 'bland', 'voice', 'actors', 'generally', 'butcher', 'water', 'down', 'scripts', 'death', 'edits', 'are', 'understandable', 'saturday', 'morning', 'standards', 'One', 'Piece', 'arguably', 'saturday', 'morning', 'show', 'others', 'just', 'feel', '4Kids', 'pointlessly', 'wasting', 'money.I', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', '4Kids', 'went', 'back', 'pulled', 'George', 'Lucas', 'one', 'edits', 'disc', 'infamous', 'hammer', 'gun', 'bizzare', 'looking', 'contraption', 'flintlock', 'pistol', 'character', 'child', 'head', 'hammer', 'gun', '*very*', 'badly', 'edited', 'whoever', 'came', 'up', 'executed', 'idea', 'points', 'thinking', 'box', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'running', 'best', 'laughably', 'bad', 'edit', 'modern', 'anime', 'standards', 'owe', 'rental', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'recommend', 'watch', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'One', 'Piece', 'currently', 'legal', 'way', 'obtain', 'North', 'America', 'will', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'Viz', 'manga', 'instead', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'original', 'material', 'Rent', 'disc', 'hammer', 'gun', 'hope', 'pray', '4Kids', 'never', 'chance', 'butcher', 'anything', 'badly', 'again']","One Piece, Vol. 2 - The Circus Comes To Town"
