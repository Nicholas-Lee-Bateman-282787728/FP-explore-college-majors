Few people realize that this movie has been very hard to get, at best on VHS tape.  Now it is on DVD.  The cast is superb, the music is outstanding, and the art production for the movie was done by Norman Rockwell.  Folks don't generally know that Winchester produced the 1866-1966 commemorative rifle and carbine and used the Stagecoach artwork to help market the firearms.  Both the rifle and carbine are very hard to get now.  The movie itself was shot on location near Nederland, Colorado along the front range of the Rocky Mountains.  The scenery is gorgeous.

1504081,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B005UO1CLM,Gary P. Cohen,"[24, 26]","I saw this film with my father in the movies when I was 16 and greatly enjoyed it.  For years I wondered why it had never been released on VHS or DVD.  I especially wondered when another terrific 20th. Century Fox western ""Rio Conchos"" was released earlier in the year and partnered with a mediocrity like ""Take A Hard Ride.""Well anyway it is finally here in a release limited to 3000.  This film was released in the summer of 1966 and was both a critical and financial failure.  The main problem seems to be simply that it is not the John Ford ""Stagecoach"" and has been maligned unfairly as a result.  Filmed in color in beautiful Colorado, this film has plenty of action and an indian attack sequence near the end that goes on forever.  The film has a terrific cast including the beautiful Ann-Margaret as the saloon girl Dallas, Bing Crosby excellent as the alcoholic Doc Boone and Michael Connors, 1 year before ""Mannix,"" as the Southern gambler Hatfield.  Red Buttons as the whiskey salesman whose wares Crosby keeps sampling and the great Slim Pickens as whiny stagecoach driver Buck.  The rest of the cast includes Van Heflin as the Marshal, Curley and Bob Cummings, slimy and obnoxious as the embezzling banker Gatewood.  Stefanie Powers is the pregnant cavalry Captain's wife, protected by Connors.  (I was lucky enough to meet Miss Powers and Ann-Margret a few years ago at a Chiller Theatre in New Jersey and had them sign a poster, with that wonderful Norman Rockwell artwork, of this film that I own.)Keenan Wynn makes a small appearance at the end as the absolutely evil Luke Plummer, the man the Ringo kid has come to kill.And speaking of the Ringo kid, theres Alex Cord in the role that made the legendary John Wayne a star.  Look, Cord is obviously no Duke, not many are.  As a matter of fact, the Duke has been gone since 1979 and still no one has replaced him and probably no one ever will.  However Cord is fine on his own in the film.As stated the film is in color and has plenty of action and beautiful scenery.  The picture quality on the DVD is great.  There are no extra features except an isolated audio score of the fantastic Jerry Goldsmith music.In conclusion, I have waited for this one on DVD for years and was not disappointed.

If John Ford's 1939 masterwork STAGECOACH had never existed, this film would be seen as an above average exciting western. But when you're a remake of one of the great American films of all time, it's near impossible to stand on your own without being compared. Of course, a film like this, despite some genuine virtues, is going to suffer under comparisons. As it is, it's a solid western with colorful characters traveling amid the glorious Colorado mountains majestically lensed in CinemaScope by William Clothier (MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE). The film, not surprisingly considering the almost 30 years that have passed, is more violent. It opens with a soldier getting a tomahawk to the face, a man being dragged through fire and a horse stomping a solider to death. Some of the casting is off. Ann-Margret, in particular, with her Sydney Guilaroff hairstyles and anachronistic false fingernails is simply too young for the role of the prostitute Dallas and Robert Cummings, who normally can barely make an effort to act, overacts terribly. Directed by Gordon Douglas, music by Jerry Goldsmith.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[1, 1]","1966's ""Stagecoach"" was a bit of a dud getting terrible reviews but now getting royal treatment from Twilight Time in a limited edition on DVD.  Jammed packed with lesser stars but top billed by Bing Crosby and Ann-Margret and with Stephanie Powers, Slim Pickens, Bob Cummings, Red Buttons, Mike Connors, Keenan Wynn and Van Heflin  (Heflin worked opposite A-M the year before it in the exceptional ""Once a Thief"" directed by Ralph Nelson), but the real strength comes from Alex Cord (""Synanon"") in the anti-hero John Wayne role, ""The Ringo Kid.""  I admit his scenes with Ann-Margret have dramatic impact probably more to great acting in love scenes by Ann-Margret, but even there he brings a sense of naivete and innocence to his tough ex-con status as a loser opposite her loser character saloon girl.  I like Ann-Margret better in as ""Melba"" in ""The Cincinnati Kid"" directed by Norman Jewison that same year, and I think that later A-M would have chewed up the scenery to give her ""Dallas"" character here more life.  ""Stagecoach"" was well directed by Gordon Douglas (""Rio Conchos"") but a lot looks like it was filmed on a set and the actors look like they just stepped out of hairdressing and make-up most of the time even white battling Indians.  There are Norman Rockwell renderings of each character at the end accompanied by a song ""Stagecoach to Cheyenne"" which is sung by Wayne Newton.  You can see the Hollywood star power at work here as Newton clearly has no more connections to headline a major movie song today.  The DVD has an isolated track of the score by Jerry Goldsmith as a bonus feature.  And perhaps its greatest achievement is that it shows that it was one Hollywood vehicle that definitely made good cause for a re-make, but alas, as we know today, they could never make them better than the original.
