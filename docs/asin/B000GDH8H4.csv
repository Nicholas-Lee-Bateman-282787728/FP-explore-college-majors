1002015,ACGOT6Z1UX6X7,B000GDH8H4,David A. Plouffe,"[0, 0]","I've only recently been introduced to Ghost Hunters and found this DVD very entertaining.  The way TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) goes about their investigations is quite unique.  I was expecting something along the lines of how a psychic picks up ""feelings"" or ""voices in their head"" which of course the rest of us don't experience.  Instead TAPS conducts a scientific analysis of the situation.  The haunting is then either verified or debunked.  More than not, at least in this season, they are debunked.  Instead of feelings, they use equipment, such as EMF readers, infared cameras, digital cameras, and digital voice recorders to try and catch EVPs.The real charm of the series comes from the individuals that play a part of the TAPS team.  Both Jason and Grant are very likable characters.  They are hard-working family men who work for Roto-Rooter during the day, but  hunt ghosts at night.  They each have children and place an increased importance on cases that involve children.  The other members of the team from Donna to Brian to Andy each have great characteristics that make them entertaining to watch.The product itself contains 4 discs.  Each disc is broken down into 3 episodes (2 on the last DVD along with 2 unseen adventures).  The episodes can be viewed independently or one after the other automatically.  There is a bonus feature of deleted scenes.  I really wish they just would have included those scenes in the episode which they belong.  It would have made for a cleaner product.  All-in-all this is well worth the purchase and I am looking forward to watching their other DVDs!",4,Engaging Show With Great Locations,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1615,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'introduced', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'found', 'DVD', 'very', 'entertaining', 'way', 'TAPS', 'Atlantic', 'Paranormal', 'Society', 'investigations', 'quite', 'unique', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'how', 'psychic', 'up', 'feelings', 'voices', 'head', 'course', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'Instead', 'TAPS', 'scientific', 'analysis', 'situation', 'haunting', 'then', 'either', 'verified', 'debunked', 'More', 'not', 'least', 'season', 'are', 'debunked', 'Instead', 'feelings', 'use', 'equipment', 'such', 'EMF', 'readers', 'infared', 'cameras', 'digital', 'cameras', 'digital', 'voice', 'recorders', 'try', 'catch', 'EVPs.The', 'real', 'charm', 'series', 'individuals', 'play', 'part', 'TAPS', 'team', 'Jason', 'Grant', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'are', 'hard-working', 'family', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'Roto-Rooter', 'day', 'hunt', 'ghosts', 'night', 'have', 'children', 'place', 'increased', 'importance', 'cases', 'involve', 'children', 'other', 'members', 'team', 'Donna', 'Brian', 'Andy', 'have', 'great', 'characteristics', 'make', 'entertaining', 'watch.The', 'product', '4', 'discs', 'disc', 'broken', 'down', '3', 'episodes', '2', 'last', 'DVD', '2', 'unseen', 'adventures', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'independently', 'one', 'other', 'automatically', 'bonus', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'really', 'wish', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'scenes', 'episode', 'belong', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'cleaner', 'product', 'All-in-all', 'well', 'purchase', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'other', 'DVDs']",N/A

Comparing the taped ""off the air"" shows to the DVD version ... audio ""clipping"" and distortion is present, I have no idea how a big studio doesn't notice this!Granted, not having to endure endless commercials is helpful, but why a REDUCTION in audio crispness? Well, the first Season's DVD case was abysmal (my Disc 2 fell off the hub and was scratched) but the audio on those discs was fine ... now on Season 2 & 3 the reverse is true (nice ""super-gripper"" cases but abysmal audio quality)!(NOVEMBER 8, 2007 - UPDATE!!!!)- Did mail back my original DVD covers to get the replacement DVDs (""remastered"" audio) from Big Vision Entertainment (other reviewers mentioned about the replacements ... thanks).Took 24 days for the replacements to arrive. Oddly, the new and old boxes have the same UPC #'s which is going to make it very hard for a buyer to know what copies are which ""edition"". Unfortunately (for whatever reason?) Season 2: Part 2's DVD case came in a horrendous multi-swing case divider (all my discs where thrown around inside like a tornado hit, yes they got scratched). Season 2: Part 1 came in what the original Season 2 DVDs came in ... an Acecase ""super-gripper"" 4 Disc tray which held the DVDs in place by ""vice grip-like"" holders. I did listen to two random episodes from the ""remastered"" versions:(Season 2: Part 1 - Disc 3) EPISODE 9: WORTHINGTON HOME / ROLLING HILLS ASYLUM ~ The TAPS team investigates reports of paranormal phenomena at the Worthington's house and try to assure the family that their house is safe. Then the team travels to Rolling Hills Asylum to investigate reports from visitors of hair tugging, noises and phantom smells at the former insane asylum in Bethany, N.Y.(Season 2 - Part 2 - Disc 8) EPISODE 21: STONE LION INN / EDGERLY HOME ~  The Oklahoma Paranormal Society (a member of the TAPS family) refers to Grant and Jason its case file for The Stone Lion Inn in Guthrie, Oklahoma. The inn was previously a private residence and a funeral home. Grant and Jason talk with Kristen Perkins and Christine Selfridge of TOPS. The women say they've seen shadows and have captured EVPs during their investigations. Later TAPS heads to the home of Dave Edgerly in New Bedford, Massachusetts, responding to a call from Dave's friend, Kathy Elmore, who is concerned about Dave because he's ""a different person"" when he's outside the house. During the investigation, Brian and Steve discover, in a closet under the stairs, an electrical box that gives off dangerously high EMF readings. In the basement, they find mold that might be causing Dave's headaches. As the team continues to investigate, they realize that Dave uses his house to store chemicals, such as paint strippers and acetone, that can aerosolize and disperse through the vents. Even though Jason and Grant can't guarantee that there isn't any paranormal activity in the house, they tell Kathy and Dave that the house's other safety issues need to be addressed. They explain that the chemicals, the mold and the EMF radiation can cause fatigue, headaches, depression and nausea. They show him the problems one by one and tell him to fix them.Yes, it is readily apparent that the new audio is back the way it should be (audiotorily legible). Thankfully, Big Vision Entertainment confessed their error - originally I had no intention of ever buying anymore Ghost Hunters DVDs after the Season Two's were released (a pre-order on my part, none the less).Well, when comparing the laser etching on the play side of the disc(s) themself (hold under a light to see the very small printing), the difference between new and old can be told:Original defective versions:GHOST HUNTERS (SEASON 2) DISC 3GHOST HUNTERS (SEASON 2) DISC 8New ""remastered"" versions:GHOST HUNTERS DISC 3 (SEASON 2)GHOST HUNTERS DISC 8 (SEASON 2)... Note the slight difference in the word ordering. Hopes this helps all the Ghost Hunter fans out there, and I feel for the poor people who unknowingly get stuck with any ""old"" Season 2 DVD sets out there.",3,"Much better DVD case, much worse audio!",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,4197,"['Thought', 'was', 'going', 'crazy', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'realize', ""'m"", 'not', 'indeed', 'starting', 'Episode', '209', 'Disc', '3', 'audio', 'noticeable', 'turn', 'worse', 'Comparing', 'taped', 'air', 'shows', 'DVD', 'version', 'audio', 'clipping', 'distortion', 'present', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'big', 'studio', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Granted', 'not', 'having', 'endure', 'endless', 'commercials', 'helpful', 'why', 'REDUCTION', 'audio', 'crispness', 'Well', 'first', 'Season', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'abysmal', 'Disc', '2', 'fell', 'hub', 'was', 'scratched', 'audio', 'discs', 'was', 'fine', 'now', 'Season', '2', '3', 'reverse', 'true', 'nice', 'super-gripper', 'cases', 'abysmal', 'audio', 'quality', 'NOVEMBER', '8', '2007', 'UPDATE', 'Did', 'mail', 'back', 'original', 'DVD', 'covers', 'get', 'replacement', 'DVDs', 'remastered', 'audio', 'Big', 'Vision', 'Entertainment', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'replacements', 'thanks', '.Took', '24', 'days', 'replacements', 'arrive', 'Oddly', 'new', 'old', 'boxes', 'have', 'same', 'UPC', 'going', 'make', 'very', 'hard', 'buyer', 'know', 'what', 'copies', 'are', 'edition', 'Unfortunately', 'reason', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '2', 'DVD', 'case', 'came', 'horrendous', 'multi-swing', 'case', 'divider', 'discs', 'where', 'thrown', 'tornado', 'hit', 'yes', 'got', 'scratched', '2', 'Part', '1', 'came', 'what', 'original', 'Season', '2', 'DVDs', 'came', 'Acecase', 'super-gripper', '4', 'Disc', 'tray', 'held', 'DVDs', 'place', 'vice', 'grip-like', 'holders', 'did', 'listen', 'two', 'random', 'episodes', 'remastered', 'versions', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1', 'Disc', '3', 'EPISODE', '9', 'WORTHINGTON', 'HOME', '/', 'ROLLING', 'HILLS', 'ASYLUM', '~', 'TAPS', 'team', 'reports', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'Worthington', 'house', 'try', 'assure', 'family', 'house', 'safe', 'Then', 'team', 'Rolling', 'Hills', 'Asylum', 'investigate', 'reports', 'visitors', 'hair', 'tugging', 'noises', 'phantom', 'smells', 'former', 'insane', 'asylum', 'Bethany', 'N.Y.', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '2', 'Disc', '8', 'EPISODE', '21', 'STONE', 'LION', 'INN', '/', 'EDGERLY', 'HOME', '~', 'Oklahoma', 'Paranormal', 'Society', 'member', 'TAPS', 'family', 'refers', 'Grant', 'Jason', 'case', 'file', 'Stone', 'Lion', 'Inn', 'Guthrie', 'Oklahoma', 'inn', 'was', 'previously', 'private', 'residence', 'funeral', 'home', 'Grant', 'Jason', 'talk', 'Kristen', 'Perkins', 'Christine', 'Selfridge', 'TOPS', 'women', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'shadows', 'have', 'captured', 'EVPs', 'investigations', 'Later', 'TAPS', 'heads', 'home', 'Dave', 'Edgerly', 'New', 'Bedford', 'Massachusetts', 'responding', 'call', 'Dave', 'friend', 'Kathy', 'Elmore', 'who', 'concerned', 'Dave', 'different', 'person', 'when', 'house', 'investigation', 'Brian', 'Steve', 'discover', 'closet', 'stairs', 'electrical', 'box', 'dangerously', 'high', 'EMF', 'readings', 'basement', 'find', 'mold', 'might', 'be', 'causing', 'Dave', 'headaches', 'team', 'investigate', 'realize', 'Dave', 'house', 'store', 'chemicals', 'such', 'paint', 'strippers', 'acetone', 'can', 'aerosolize', 'disperse', 'vents', 'Even', 'Jason', 'Grant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guarantee', ""n't"", 'paranormal', 'activity', 'house', 'tell', 'Kathy', 'Dave', 'house', 'other', 'safety', 'issues', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'explain', 'chemicals', 'mold', 'EMF', 'radiation', 'can', 'cause', 'fatigue', 'headaches', 'depression', 'nausea', 'show', 'problems', 'one', 'one', 'tell', 'fix', 'them.Yes', 'readily', 'apparent', 'new', 'audio', 'back', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'audiotorily', 'legible', 'Thankfully', 'Big', 'Vision', 'Entertainment', 'confessed', 'error', 'originally', 'had', 'intention', 'ever', 'buying', 'anymore', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'DVDs', 'Season', 'Two', 'were', 'released', 'pre-order', 'part', 'none', 'less', '.Well', 'when', 'comparing', 'laser', 'etching', 'play', 'side', 'disc', 'themself', 'hold', 'light', 'see', 'very', 'small', 'printing', 'difference', 'new', 'old', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'Original', 'defective', 'versions', 'GHOST', 'HUNTERS', 'SEASON', '2', 'DISC', '3GHOST', 'HUNTERS', 'SEASON', '2', 'DISC', '8New', 'remastered', 'versions', 'GHOST', 'HUNTERS', 'DISC', '3', 'SEASON', '2', 'GHOST', 'HUNTERS', 'DISC', '8', 'SEASON', '2', 'Note', 'slight', 'difference', 'word', 'ordering', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'out', 'there', 'feel', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'get', 'stuck', 'old', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'sets', 'out', 'there']",N/A

1002021,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000GDH8H4,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[29, 29]","Big Vision, the company responsible for putting out ""Ghost Hunters:  Season 2, Parts 1 and 2"" and ""Ghost Hunters:  Season 1,"" still have a long way to go with the production quality of their discs, but they definitely listen to their customers and attempt to make corrections.  For starters, they've hulked up the DVD cases for Season 2, making it virtually impossible for the discs to become dislodged during shipping.  This was a major complaint of many folks of Season 1's release.  Secondly, the picture has gotten better.  Granted, it's not perfect, and it's still too grainy during the investigations to see everything that's going on, but it has improved slightly.  Finally, the audio is okay.  As stated before, there is still plenty of space for changes and improvements, but Big Vision seems to be taking its customers advice to heart.Now, on to Season 2, Part 1, in which we find Jason and Grant and the rest of the TAPS team seeking out more ghosts or lack thereof.  This particular set includes one of my favorite cases:  Myrtles Plantation.  They also revisit Eastern State Penitentiary and tackle the Rolling Hills Asylum, the wacky Winchester House, and the U.S.S. North Carolina.TAPS has always managed to impress me with their professionalism.  Search any number of ""ghost hunting"" websites and you'll see that many of them are nothing more than a bunch of teen and college-aged kids hanging out in the graveyard or trespassing onto abandoned property.  TAPS takes the paranormal very seriously.  It almost takes an act of God to make them label a location as haunted.  When they do, you can rest assured that they've done everything in their power to debunk a ghost's existence.I highly recommend this DVD set, as well as Part 2 of Season 2 and the first season.  You'll be impressed at how the TAPS team takes time to explain what an EMF detector is, what ""orbs"" are and probably aren't, and how something as simple as a mirror can play tricks on your mind.Another great thing about this particular set is in the deleted scenes area where Brian is confronted by a woman and called a few derogatory terms.

But no, I got the same poor quality sets that others have mentioned below.  The sound on half of the episodes in both Parts 1 and 2 turns fuzzy, so it is often difficult to hear and certainly very annoying.  I'm disappointed that Amazon continues to sell these poor sets.

So, of course, I had to pick up this first part of the Second Season.  Boy, am I happy I did.  Some of places they visit are well know and very famous.  Such as Winchester House and the Queen Mary.  And the U.S.S. North Carolina which is one of the most haunted ships there is.Sometimes they get something and sometimes not.  There is still a tad too much drama for me, but there is also humor and some amazing investigations. I was VERY interested in the episode where they visited the Myrtles Plantation as I have heard mixed reports about that haunting.  Over all a very good DVD set, worth the money.  I also hear that later seasons they drop a lot of the drama and focus on the ghost hunting, which makes me lean towards buying more of the sets.If you DO enjoy the Ghost Hunters DVDs, I would also suggestThe Most Haunted House in England: Ten Years' Investigation of Borley Rectory (Collector's Library of the Unknown)andHow to be a Ghost Hunter (How To Series).",5,Wonderful...,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,1089,"['was', 'back', '2007', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'copy', 'First', 'Season', 'decided', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'things', 'haunted', 'So', 'course', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'part', 'Second', 'Season', 'Boy', 'am', 'happy', 'did', 'places', 'visit', 'are', 'well', 'know', 'very', 'famous', 'Such', 'Winchester', 'House', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'U.S.S', 'North', 'Carolina', 'one', 'most', 'haunted', 'ships', 'get', 'something', 'sometimes', 'not', 'still', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'also', 'humor', 'amazing', 'investigations', 'was', 'VERY', 'interested', 'episode', 'where', 'visited', 'Myrtles', 'Plantation', 'have', 'heard', 'mixed', 'reports', 'haunting', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'money', 'also', 'hear', 'later', 'seasons', 'drop', 'lot', 'drama', 'focus', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'lean', 'towards', 'buying', 'more', 'sets.If', 'DO', 'enjoy', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'DVDs', 'would', 'also', 'suggestThe', 'Most', 'Haunted', 'House', 'England', 'Ten', 'Years', 'Investigation', 'Borley', 'Rectory', 'Collector', 'Library', 'Unknown', 'andHow', 'be', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'How', 'Series']",N/A

1002028,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000GDH8H4,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","With the exception of the first season, from here on out, Ghost Hunters Seasons are separated into two parts.  Probably just to give you a more impressive looking collection on your shelf, at least that's the reason I'm going to go with.  So this review is for the First Part of Season 1.For those not familiar with Ghost Hunters, it revolves around a paranormal investigative society called The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS).  Founders Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson are investigators, who along with their team, go to different locations and try to disprove hauntings.  That's right, disprove.  They don't immediately believe anything and try to rule out explainable possibilities for the phenomena they do find.  And that's what makes them different and explains their success as a TV show.The people are what make the show.  If you didn't believe in their credibility, there'd be no reason to watch it.  And Jason and Grant come across as being very truthful and believable.  You know they don't want to make a fool out of you with fake evidence.  Or so it seems that way.  In fact, as the season progresses, they kind of filter out the people who are not so professional and move to having people that are calm, collected, and present the group well.  This includes the removal of Brian Harnois about half way through the discs, who not only caused drama,  but didn't appear to be very professional either.  Steve Gonsalves, as his replacement, still has fun, but gets the job done.  And this season introduces us to Dave Tango, an investigator I really enjoy because of energy.  I was still a little disappointed to see the demonologists in this one.  I think they just lose a little bit of their credibility when they bring them in; especially when all we see them do is bless houses and not actual find any real proof that a non-human entity is haunting a place.  But even their appearances were rare.The equipment they use is specialized for what they want to find.  They run a lot of different kinds of video, record audio to see if there is voice phenomena, have heat sensors and temperature guns, and EMF detectors to detect high energy fields whether it be emitting from an electronic or something unexplainable.  All this is in an attempt to find evidence that's provable, and sometimes they catch some pretty interesting stuff with it.  I honestly don't care one way or the other for the EMF's and temperature guns, they don't add anything for me.  But the video and audio, when they do have something to show, is quite impressive.  And because it seems they have a little more funds this time around, the picture quality was noticeably better (although still not fantastic) and the sound seemed less fuzzy.  I think this better presents their evidence and makes viewing it at home not as much of a chore to see what they're seeing.  They still had the distracting music though.TAPS went to a lot of famous places in this first part of the season and I was impressed that they didn't automatically assume that a place was haunted.  In fact, at a lot of these places, they didn't find anything.  And they admitted it.  They also disproved a lot of evidence they caught that appeared to be a haunting in the first place, but was actually done by a tricky live person.  The fact that they are so upfront is another thing that makes this show so believable.  And aside from these famous places that they went (Myrtles Plantation, Brennan's Restaurant, Mordecai House, USS North Carolina, Bradley Playhouse, Harris Firehouse, Ledge Lighthouse, Astor's Newport Mansion, Rolling Hills Asylum, Eastern State Penitentiary, Winchester House, and Queen Mary) they also went to quite a few private residences, where in my opinion, they get the best evidence.  My favorite episode was probably the Rolling Hills Asylum.  I won't say whether or not they caught any evidence, but it was an interesting place and the team really acted as a unit during it.  By contrast, the first couple of episodes were a little haphazard because of their crew.I think that as the drama lessened and the people improved, this is where Ghost Hunters starts to really be a great show.  Even for people who don't believe in ghosts, they present interesting evidence or something strange happening.  I recommend starting at this season instead of the first, unless you really want all the background stuff that happens with TAPS.Review by M.

I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E;) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma.

While the sound and picture were noticeably imperfect it doesn't stop you from enjoying the episodes just the same and with the reduced price it is a good value.",5,Addictive,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,708,"['think', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'two', 'week', 'buying', 'true', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'better', 'sound', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'such', 'things', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'poor', 'days', 'dvd', 'technology', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'blame', 'Big', 'Vision', 'Hopefully', 'season', 'three', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'treatment', 'show', 'more', 'popular', 'Having', 'said', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'show', 'not', 'let', 'negative', 'comments', 'stop', 'picking', 'up', 'copy', 'season', 'two', 'sound', 'picture', 'were', 'noticeably', 'imperfect', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'episodes', 'just', 'same', 'reduced', 'price', 'good', 'value']",N/A

But I have a major complaint.Why is it that you only do these video downloads for PC's only and for portable video players that very few people actually own? I was seriously looking forward to catching up on season 4 - and loading them onto my ipod and I can't.I understand that the TAPS guys have no control over how their content is sold, so I am not pissed at them, I am pissed that the people who think that making this stuff compatable for pc's only and for crappy portable video players is okay. It's not. Compress these items for OSX too please... we like our TAPS and we like to watch them on Apple products.

Well let me tell you how responsible they are, took almost 3 months to get here and  when i got them they were in old ,beat up, broken inside and out cases, all but one of the dvds was intact. Looking at these i am thinking"" why wouldn't they use the new boxes, if these are indeed ""new"" and remastered!?????""Would love to be able to check it out,,,but i wouldn't put one of these scratched, cracked coasters in my dvd player for anything.Nasty, just simply nasty, that is the way i was treated, i mean if they didn't want to do it why offer?There was a delay, I'm guessing because they didn't expect such a return, and i understood that, i mean again,  I thought it was a cool offer to fix their mistake, but it's like they were pissed at us and threw garbage in an envelope and shipped it out to shut us up.Well they can kiss it, i will NEVER buy anything from their company again!These dvds are the crappiest i have ever purchased, and unfortunately i have purchased some winners over time, and this takes the cake!",1,"Big Vision, BIG JOKE!Replacement version is HORRIBLE!",1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1251,"['Okay', 'i', 'other', 'people', 'followed', 'instructions', 'returns', 'get', 'fixed', 'dvd', 'whole', 'time', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'wow', 'how', 'cool', 'company', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'send', 'back', 'faulty', 'discs', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'how', 'responsible', 'are', 'took', 'almost', '3', 'months', 'get', 'here', 'when', 'i', 'got', 'were', 'old', 'beat', 'up', 'broken', 'inside', 'cases', 'one', 'dvds', 'was', 'intact', 'Looking', 'i', 'am', 'thinking', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'new', 'boxes', 'are', 'indeed', 'new', 'remastered', 'Would', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'check', 'out', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'one', 'scratched', 'cracked', 'coasters', 'dvd', 'player', 'anything.Nasty', 'just', 'simply', 'nasty', 'way', 'i', 'was', 'treated', 'i', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'why', 'offer', 'was', 'delay', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'return', 'i', 'understood', 'i', 'mean', 'again', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'offer', 'fix', 'mistake', 'were', 'pissed', 'threw', 'garbage', 'envelope', 'shipped', 'out', 'shut', 'can', 'kiss', 'i', 'will', 'NEVER', 'buy', 'anything', 'company', 'again', 'dvds', 'are', 'crappiest', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased', 'unfortunately', 'i', 'have', 'purchased', 'winners', 'time', 'cake']",N/A
