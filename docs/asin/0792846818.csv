But I'm sorry; I just didn't get this movie. I did understand that the main character, Michael, had a hard life and some very dysfunctional (divorced) parents. But then the movie got all twisted. By watching the movie, you can tell that was sort of the point, but it was still weird in that a lot of the scenes and secondary characters didn't seem to have anything to do with each other. Also, the ""n"" word was thrown around a lot, but I guess I can let that side since it was the `70s.

157486,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,0792846818,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[2, 2]","by Dane YoussefThis is rumored to be animation-pioneer Ralph Bakshi's favorite among all his projects. And no wonder. This is his story!A 22-year old Jewish-Italian spends his time playing pin-ball non-stop and drawing. He still lives with his parents, an Italian man who cheats on his wife and a Jewish woman who's so emotionally torqued up--such a drama queen, that when Angelo comes home after a night with his lady, she hits him over the head with a frying pan and sticks his head in the oven.There's always domestic unrest in any family, particularly with interracial married couples who lived in the Bronx around this time. But they're so wound-up, so ready to snap--they come to blows and sharp instruments a little too quickly.Way too quickly, in fact. Angelo and Ida's Punch-and-Judy relationship--coupled with the problems that reside outdoors in the Bronx--Michael seems doomed to have some of it rub off on him. ""You hang around garbage long enough, you start to stink,"" as they say.But Michael has an outlet for his angst and confusion. Rather than fall into the trap many around him seem to, he vents himself at the drawing board. He draws a lot of the people and places in the Bronx. Although he seems to dislike many of them, they're so broad and colorful and wired, they translate easily to caricatures.Bakshi takes us to all the usual haunts we visit in his movies--trashy ghetto neighborhoods with buildings that look condemned, dirt-cheap apartments, behind the wheel of cars, rooftops, nightclubs, bars, brothels.The lives of all of the Bronx inhabitants: Jews, Italians, blacks, drag queens, junkies, vagrants, hookers, cops, thugs and the like. And by using animation, Bakshi (and Michael) sort of illustrate their world and their eccentricity, which is so dangerous, it borderlines on insanity.I wasn't particularly crazy about the disco remix of ""Scarborough's Fair."" What can I say? I fell in love with the original.But I suppose it does fit in with the nature of the film. Bakshi uses a lot of shots of Michael playing pinball. He's a big pinball fanatic. It's obviously a metaphor, perhaps for the hectic universe in which Michael bounces from one scenario to another, for which he's constantly out of place.Carol is a black woman who works at a local bar where Michael draws on the roof. She's loud, she's opinionated, she's passionate. And she really seems to be about something. She's not just an ethnic joke.Like all bars, there are lots of colorful locals there, plenty of dangerous ones to be sure.Michael tries to score free drinks with his art. But that's all he tries to score Michael's no ladies' man and he knows it. He's a deep, sensitive, skilled artiste. And a sitting duck for some of the louder, tougher guys who make up the city.It doesn't help matter that he's a virgin and everyone knows it. At one point, some greasers try to hook him up with a loose woman who's eager to have it with a guy who's so fresh and green. Although this leads to a disaster. Even his own father tries to hook him up. Now there's a true loving father for you.Michael has an eye for Carol (many people at the bar she tends do), not because he's dying to get laid like nearly every other male. But he seems to genuinely feel something real for her. When she offers it up to him in gratitude for a favor, he faints. He wants her, but he's just not ready.Ida is fussy and over-protective of her son, just like a mother hen. Or rather a Jewish mother. Angelo wants his son to be more of a ""man's man.""Like all of Bakshi's films, this contains a lot of graphic violence and sexual images, as well as caricatures in the ethnic vein.But surprisingly, in the strangest way, it contains real heart, as well as some sweetness. The relationship between Michael and Carol has to be seen. Bakshi could've made her just an archetype like everyone else and he didn't. She's just as developed and human and relative as dear Michael is. These two deseve one another.""Heavy Traffic"" is wildly imaginative and thrilling in all it's glory. Like ""Being John Malkovich,"" we actually feel like we're inside the author's head rather than his film. This truly ranks as Bakshi's best. He deserves more credit for this than ""Fritz The Cat.""How much of all this take place in Michael's mind and how much of it takes place in his reality? Maybe they're one and the same. Maybe not. Maybe we're supposed to figure it out. It up to us. Just like Michael's life is up to him.The characters in the city are so damn cartooniSH and erratic already, they transfer them into cartoon characters without losing anything in the translation.Bakshi doesn't paint a pretty picture of the city and it's locals. But then again, he never has, has he? That's one of the things he's known for.But that's not the only thing. Let's hope that when he goes... he'll be remembered for a lot of things.Especially this one. It is... not only his best, not only one of the year's best... but of the best.by Dane Youssef",5,One of the best... and Bakshi's best,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,4986,"['Dane', 'YoussefThis', 'rumored', 'be', 'animation-pioneer', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'favorite', 'projects', 'wonder', 'story', '22-year', 'old', 'Jewish-Italian', 'time', 'playing', 'pin-ball', 'non-stop', 'drawing', 'still', 'parents', 'Italian', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'emotionally', 'torqued', 'up', 'such', 'drama', 'queen', 'when', 'Angelo', 'home', 'night', 'lady', 'head', 'frying', 'pan', 'sticks', 'head', 'always', 'domestic', 'unrest', 'family', 'particularly', 'interracial', 'married', 'couples', 'who', 'lived', 'Bronx', 'time', ""'re"", 'so', 'wound-up', 'so', 'ready', 'snap', 'come', 'blows', 'sharp', 'instruments', 'little', 'too', 'quickly.Way', 'too', 'quickly', 'fact', 'Angelo', 'Ida', 'Punch-and-Judy', 'relationship', 'coupled', 'problems', 'reside', 'outdoors', 'Bronx', 'Michael', 'doomed', 'have', 'hang', 'around', 'garbage', 'long', 'enough', 'start', 'stink', 'say.But', 'Michael', 'outlet', 'angst', 'confusion', 'Rather', 'fall', 'trap', 'many', 'seem', 'drawing', 'board', 'lot', 'people', 'places', 'Bronx', 'dislike', 'many', ""'re"", 'so', 'broad', 'colorful', 'wired', 'translate', 'easily', 'caricatures.Bakshi', 'usual', 'haunts', 'visit', 'movies', 'trashy', 'ghetto', 'neighborhoods', 'buildings', 'look', 'condemned', 'dirt-cheap', 'apartments', 'wheel', 'cars', 'rooftops', 'nightclubs', 'bars', 'brothels.The', 'lives', 'Bronx', 'inhabitants', 'Jews', 'Italians', 'blacks', 'drag', 'queens', 'junkies', 'vagrants', 'hookers', 'cops', 'thugs', 'like', 'using', 'animation', 'Bakshi', 'Michael', 'sort', 'illustrate', 'world', 'eccentricity', 'so', 'dangerous', 'insanity.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'crazy', 'disco', 'remix', 'Scarborough', 'Fair', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'fell', 'love', 'original.But', 'suppose', 'fit', 'nature', 'film', 'Bakshi', 'lot', 'shots', 'Michael', 'playing', 'pinball', 'big', 'pinball', 'fanatic', 'obviously', 'metaphor', 'perhaps', 'hectic', 'universe', 'Michael', 'one', 'scenario', 'constantly', 'place.Carol', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'local', 'bar', 'where', 'Michael', 'roof', 'loud', 'opinionated', 'passionate', 'really', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'just', 'ethnic', 'joke.Like', 'bars', 'are', 'lots', 'colorful', 'locals', 'there', 'plenty', 'dangerous', 'ones', 'be', 'sure.Michael', 'tries', 'score', 'free', 'drinks', 'art', 'score', 'Michael', 'ladies', 'man', 'deep', 'sensitive', 'skilled', 'artiste', 'sitting', 'duck', 'louder', 'tougher', 'guys', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'city.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'matter', 'virgin', 'everyone', 'one', 'point', 'greasers', 'try', 'hook', 'up', 'loose', 'woman', 'who', 'eager', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'so', 'fresh', 'green', 'disaster', 'Even', 'own', 'father', 'tries', 'hook', 'up', 'Now', 'true', 'loving', 'father', 'you.Michael', 'eye', 'Carol', 'many', 'people', 'bar', 'do', 'not', 'dying', 'get', 'laid', 'nearly', 'other', 'male', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'something', 'real', 'When', 'up', 'gratitude', 'favor', 'just', 'not', 'ready.Ida', 'fussy', 'over-protective', 'son', 'just', 'mother', 'hen', 'rather', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'Angelo', 'son', 'be', 'more', 'man', 'man', 'Bakshi', 'films', 'lot', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sexual', 'images', 'as', 'well', 'caricatures', 'ethnic', 'vein.But', 'surprisingly', 'strangest', 'way', 'real', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'sweetness', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'Carol', 'be', 'seen', 'Bakshi', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'just', 'archetype', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'developed', 'human', 'relative', 'dear', 'Michael', 'two', 'deseve', 'one', 'Heavy', 'Traffic', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'thrilling', 'glory', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'actually', 'feel', ""'re"", 'author', 'head', 'rather', 'film', 'truly', 'Bakshi', 'best', 'more', 'credit', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'How', 'much', 'take', 'place', 'Michael', 'mind', 'how', 'much', 'place', 'reality', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'one', 'same', 'Maybe', 'not', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'figure', 'out', 'up', 'Just', 'Michael', 'life', 'up', 'him.The', 'characters', 'city', 'are', 'so', 'damn', 'cartooniSH', 'erratic', 'already', 'transfer', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'losing', 'anything', 'translation.Bakshi', ""n't"", 'paint', 'pretty', 'picture', 'city', 'locals', 'then', 'again', 'never', 'one', 'things', 'known', 'for.But', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'Let', 'hope', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'remembered', 'lot', 'things.Especially', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'best.by', 'Dane', 'Youssef']",N/A

157489,AWI3PQ13KX0WE,0792846818,"Eric Noble ""Animation Keeper""","[7, 7]","""Heavy Traffic"" is a masterpiece of animation, despite the flaws it has. It dares to tackle with more complex human emotions and issues, far more than had ever been done since the Golden Age of Animation. The story deals with the trials and tribulations of young Michael Corleone (yes, that's his name), a 22 year-old Half-jewish, Half-Italian aspiring cartoonist. He lives with his parents, Angelo and Ida Corleone, whose relationship make Al and Peg Bundy look like Ozzie and Harriet. The film also talks about life in 1973 New York (tough place to be).First off, there is a lot of great animation in here, although it lacks precision and professionalism , although I chalk that up to lack of funds for pencil testing and Bakshi's relative inexperience with feature animation. However, the animators do manage to get the personality of the characters across quite well. The characters in this film feel real, although they have caricatured appearances, but in some ways, the cartoony drawing style of the movie enhances the emotional realism of the characters. They're both lovable and deplorable at the same time, which makes them feel like real people. You'll never see Mickey Mouse or even Bugs Bunny do any of the stuff they do in this movie. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that it prides itself on being a animated movie. A lot of animated films have followed the Disney pattern of trying to disguise the animated factor by following a live-action pattern (trying to emulate live-action). This film tries to do what can only be done in animation. As such, there is a lot of surreal moments loaded with symbolism, although you will have to watch it a few times to get them. A key strength to any Bakshi film, but particularly his early ones, is collage of different styles. The characters are sometimes traced over live backgrounds (actual photographs), or the animation takes a whole new turn and transforms into something like the brilliant Maybellene sequence (set to the classic Chuck Berry song). Bakshi in those days was all about forging ahead and trying to create something new.However, despite its brilliance, this film has a few rough patches. There are many good parts to this movie, but it's only after multiple viewings that the film connects as a whole. This shows a lack of clarity in storytelling, which isn't surprising since Bakshi tended to improvise as he went along. Although it adds a sense of adventure for production, it doesn't help create a coherent film. Also, did we really need to see Ida's breasts or have the gag about Angelo crapping his pants. I could have done with out those.Aside from these minor complaints, ""Heavy Traffic"" is a great movie that is lightyears beyond Bakshi's previous film, ""Fritz the Cat"". This DVD does no justice to the films. We need a DVD commentary from the man himself, along with the animators who worked on this.

157494,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0792846818,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 7]","After the success of ""Fritz the Cat"", celebrated animation director Ralph Bakshi turned his adult-oriented animation style to something a bit more personal with 1973's ""Heavy Traffic"". The film follows Michael Corleone, a young, underachieving cartoonist living with his violently battling parents in a rough part of the city. When he is at home, he must put up with his Italian mob-involved father and his coddling Jewish mother literally attempting to kill each other, so he spends a lot of time wandering the streets and getting into odd situations by hanging out with seedy people at seedy bars and being harassed by locals about his virginity. When he takes up with an attractive black girl who has been fired from one of those clubs, his racist father puts a contract out on his life for shaming the family. While that seems like it could be a solid plot on paper though, it doesn't play out into very much onscreen. There is little added to the story than what I've just told you. No real twists, nothing really interesting besides Bakshi's expected bizarre visuals, which are really what Bakshi's more doodly films, like this, are worth watching for I suppose. Though, personally, the clashing of Bakshi's far too doodly animated characters with real world imagery comes out looking far too messy for my tastes. We're not talking ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" here.Of course, the film is clearly a look at the ugly, gritty, dark side of urban life. How hard and violent it is, how you get bounced around (there is a big pinball machine metaphor played out with live-action footage that weaves in and around the animation), how much hatred there is between groups of people and how some folks struggle (apparently unsuccessfully) to rise above it. It shows both a nostalgic love and a disdain for urban life, which is truly portrayed without pulling any punches (be prepared for racially offensive language and generally offensive visuals). It's all best seen as a work of pop art reflecting its time and source, not just in its unique look but over all. It works in that sense, though still is not my cup of tea, but I don't really feel it works as a movie. I can appreciate a simple story, but this one still didn't really seem like a sufficient story as I watched it, I've never really been a fan of Bakshi's wild and unnecessarily raunchy or violent doodles that seem to serve little purpose or be too over the top to be effective when they are making a point, and the whole live-action wraparound only made the film's story more confusing, leaving one wondering if it was all imagined by the live-action Michael or if it was a vision of things to come, or what. Bottom line, it works as a work of art, but not as a piece of storytelling, and since it seems to be trying to be both, I would only consider it partially successful and not appealing to my personal tastes at all really.Regardless, it's good to see this one on DVD, as I personally feel everything should be available on DVD. It is only in fullscreen though, and there is only one extra, but it's a good one. The extra is the theatrical trailer, and theatrical trailers for this kind of film from this era are very interesting to watch. Despite the low number of stars I'm giving this film (sorry, it just didn't do much for me except as an animation oddity), I would recommend it for true animation aficionados to have in their collections since it is a part of animation history. But, if you don't care about that sort of thing, don't bother with it unless you just like raunchy, wild animation.",2,"Worth viewing as an animation oddity, nothing more, unless its nostalgia speaks to you.",1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3567,"['success', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'celebrated', 'animation', 'director', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'turned', 'adult-oriented', 'animation', 'style', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'personal', '1973', 'Heavy', 'Traffic', 'film', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'young', 'underachieving', 'cartoonist', 'living', 'violently', 'battling', 'parents', 'rough', 'part', 'city', 'When', 'home', 'must', 'put', 'up', 'Italian', 'mob-involved', 'father', 'coddling', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'literally', 'attempting', 'kill', 'other', 'lot', 'time', 'wandering', 'streets', 'getting', 'odd', 'situations', 'hanging', 'out', 'seedy', 'people', 'seedy', 'bars', 'being', 'harassed', 'locals', 'virginity', 'When', 'up', 'attractive', 'black', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'fired', 'one', 'clubs', 'racist', 'father', 'contract', 'out', 'life', 'shaming', 'family', 'could', 'be', 'solid', 'plot', 'paper', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'onscreen', 'little', 'added', 'story', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'told', 'real', 'twists', 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'Bakshi', 'expected', 'bizarre', 'visuals', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'Bakshi', 'more', 'doodly', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'suppose', 'Though', 'personally', 'clashing', 'Bakshi', 'far', 'too', 'doodly', 'animated', 'characters', 'real', 'world', 'imagery', 'out', 'looking', 'far', 'too', 'messy', 'tastes', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'here.Of', 'course', 'film', 'clearly', 'look', 'ugly', 'gritty', 'dark', 'side', 'urban', 'life', 'How', 'hard', 'violent', 'how', 'get', 'bounced', 'big', 'pinball', 'machine', 'metaphor', 'played', 'out', 'live-action', 'footage', 'animation', 'how', 'much', 'hatred', 'groups', 'people', 'how', 'folks', 'struggle', 'apparently', 'unsuccessfully', 'rise', 'nostalgic', 'love', 'disdain', 'urban', 'life', 'truly', 'portrayed', 'pulling', 'punches', 'be', 'prepared', 'racially', 'offensive', 'language', 'generally', 'offensive', 'visuals', 'best', 'seen', 'work', 'pop', 'art', 'reflecting', 'time', 'source', 'not', 'just', 'unique', 'look', 'sense', 'still', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'can', 'appreciate', 'simple', 'story', 'one', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'sufficient', 'story', 'watched', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'Bakshi', 'wild', 'unnecessarily', 'raunchy', 'violent', 'doodles', 'seem', 'serve', 'little', 'purpose', 'be', 'too', 'top', 'be', 'effective', 'when', 'are', 'making', 'point', 'whole', 'live-action', 'wraparound', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'confusing', 'leaving', 'one', 'wondering', 'was', 'imagined', 'live-action', 'Michael', 'was', 'vision', 'things', 'come', 'what', 'Bottom', 'line', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'would', 'only', 'consider', 'partially', 'successful', 'not', 'appealing', 'personal', 'tastes', 'really.Regardless', 'good', 'see', 'one', 'DVD', 'personally', 'feel', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'only', 'fullscreen', 'only', 'one', 'extra', 'good', 'one', 'extra', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'kind', 'film', 'era', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'low', 'number', 'stars', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'sorry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'animation', 'oddity', 'would', 'recommend', 'true', 'animation', 'aficionados', 'have', 'collections', 'part', 'animation', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'sort', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'just', 'raunchy', 'wild', 'animation']",N/A

In  Heavy Traffic, animation artist Ralph Bakshi presents us with a look at life in the early 70s (late 60s?), city style .... and this city is gritty, not entirely pretty ....Michael Corleone (not the only reference to other popular films of the times) scribbles away at his drawing board while his Catholic father and Jewish mother wage Armageddon outside his door.  He finds comfort and release seeing the world as an absurd, psychotic cartoon.  Pretty much a loner, his main connection to the outside world is a black bargirl named Carol who works right downstairs from him and slips him drinks for his entertaining sketches.  An unfortunate incident with a drag queen associate costs Carol her job, and she and Michael end up out on the streets together, since he can't seem to make ANY sort of job situation come together.  They form a sort of hustling alliance, with him as her pimp, and they nosedive into dark urban realms of the quick buck and the inevitable personal compromises involved.All this is interposed with images of live city backdrops and numerous references to a pinball game.  Ralph Bakshi's animated vision is a moving work of underground pop art which, despite limitations, was a groundbreaking achievement that pushed the frontiers of American animation thousands of miles.  I can see the influence of this film (and Bakshi's work in general) on the likes of Matt Groening, Don Bluth, and yes, even parts of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Heavy Traffic is dark, rude and dangerous.  At times it has an almost experimental feel, moving at a stream of consciousness pace more than any conventional narrative.  Its portayal of characters is raw and extreme, has an exaggerated sort of believability to it.  It also has the feel of a semi-autobiography, with its portayal of a creative misfit struggling against the odds for survival, if not personal validation.This very personal work goes places other animations of the time wouldn't even consider, was rated X at the time of its original release, and was re-released very shortly afterward in a lightly watered-down R-version.  The recent DVD release appears to be a restoration of the original artwork, is a nice clean print, despite the full-frame format and mono soundtrack.  It would be nice to see this touched up with a slightly refurbished soundtrack (it IS animation, after all); at the same time the compressed sound lends to the quaint sort of 70s feel to it, creating an air of nostalgia rivaling that of The Iron Giant.  And these guys weren't even trying!My appreciation for this special film has not diminished over the years; indeed, I understand it a bit more as an adult.  It captures the dark, skewed out, surrealistic beauty of the urban underbelly, delivers some nasty bellylaughs, shows us the world as an oversized cartoon arcade game, and reminds us that all we can do sometimes is just keep playing that game.  Even if we do end up getting our head blown off by a paraplegic midget on a skateboard.

157502,AGGP33QD4DTKV,0792846818,Xevious,"[0, 0]","Considering it's a Bakshi film it being a little odd is to be expected, but this? This is one of the strangest cartoons out there, literally like a night of boozing and doing LSD. The biggest drawback is that there's almost no plot. The main character is in an arcade, he's a somewhat talented cartoonist, and while playing a game of pinball he sorta trips out into this fantasy world where it's mostly live action, partly cartoon, and the whole setting of this is in the disturbed 1970's NYC where gangs of punks, lowlifes, pimps, prostitues, cheap sex and the like are at their worst. You'll see the glits and glamor of New York, but mostly the darker side will abound ranging from dirty slums, delapidated abandoned buildings, swanky bars, allies overrun with mafioso, and corrupt cops and almost anything inbetween. The plot is very basic. The cartoonist trips out, then he meets his friend Carol, and they go and get together and do something (totally unknown what it is but it's apparent at the end.) The movie basically throws the plot out the window and focuses in on dazzling you with a gritty, grainy animation style Bakshi and his crew are now famous for while a barely noticeable plot is slows peiced together in about an hour and sixteen minutes. As a matter of fact, you could almost say that the biggest 'plot' of all is to amaze you with the bloody, gory and sexually provocative tidbits of this film while some patches of actually story were thrown in.This film goes against the grain of your average movie, but executes it in a very wonderful unforgettable way. I guess it all boils down to personal taste with this one. I can see someone wanting a great movie with an all star cast and an engaging plot dismissing this as pure rubbish, but someone simply looking for a film with a truly remarkable bag of neat tricks would give think it was an unloved masterpiece.I would most certainly give another look at a Bakshi production!
