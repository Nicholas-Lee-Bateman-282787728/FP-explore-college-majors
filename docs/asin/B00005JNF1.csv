The characters are likable and the story kept my interest the whole time...and that's hard to do. NOW BE WARNED!

Accused of being ""a millstone 'round our necks,"" Toby decides to make a new beginning by joining up with it.  Signing on to help the snack concessionaire, Harry Tupper (Bob Sweeney), might not be the smartest move he could make, but he soon finds a reluctant protector in strongman Ben Cotter (Henry Calvin, better known as Sgt. Garcia in Disney'sWalt Disney Treasures: Zorro - The Complete First Season), who can't abide seeing a boy mistreated, and a friend in clown/veterinarian/dog trainer Sam Treat (Gene Sheldon, who played Bernardo in the same series), and is captivated by a chimpanzee he christens Mr. Stubbs.  Before he knows it, he's talked himself into being groomed to take over for one of the juvenile trick riders who serve as the show's star attraction.  Now he has to decide whether he really has what it takes to become ""truly circus.""  This movie is based onToby Tyler or Ten Weeks with a Circusbut has, to my mind, a much more satisfying ending.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 6]","""Toby Tyler"" is an excellent family movie and a rare one as well since it is suitable for every member of the family.  I have watched ""Toby Tyler"" multiple times and find it as enjoyable now as when I first saw it as a child.Toby Tyler (Kevin Corcoran, who was a Disney regular as a child and appeared in ""Polyanna,"" ""A Tiger Walks,"" and ""Old Yeller,"" among others) is orphaned and living with his aunt and uncle.  However, life is hard for Toby and he feels unloved.  After his uncle makes him feel like a burden, Toby runs away to join a circus passing through town.Toby works as a concessionaire for Mr. Tupper (Bob Sweeney, who also appeared in Disney's ""Moon Pilot"" and ""Son of Flubber), who manages to make it appear as though he is helping Toby when he cons Toby regularly.  For example, Mr. Tupper convinces Toby that he must share his tips with Mr. Tupper.  Toby also finds a protector in Ben Cotter (Henry Calvin, ""Babes in Toyland"" and Sergeant Garcia in Disney's 1950's television series ""Zorro""), who turns out to be a good friend to Toby, along with clown Sam Treat (Gene Sheldon, who also appeared in ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""Zorro) and chimpanzee Mr. Stubbs.Life is initially difficult for nave Toby.  He has a hard time focusing on his job and keeping food from Mr. Stubbs.  Even though chaos seems to follow Toby, an opportunity arises for Toby to take center stage at the circus.  Somehow things just never seem to go well for Toby, and he decides to leave the circus, but tragedy strikes.  The end of this movie will bring smiles and make you want to watch this movie again in the near future.Kevin Corcoran seemed to play the same character again and again.  However, Corcoran excelled in ""Pollyanna"" and ""Toby Tyler.""  Toby is an innocent in a wild world and we get an opportunity to see the world as Toby sees it.  Even though Toby has some bad experiences, Toby also gets to do some very exciting things and for just a moment we can think back to an era when circuses visited smaller towns and it was common for boys to at least think about running away to join the hard life of the circus.The marvelous thing about this movie is that it has action, excitement and humor, and yet is sufficiently tame for even the youngest members of the family.  The portions of the circus that we see add to the excitement of the story.  I also enjoyed how this movie ends.  Though we know that life is complicated and messy, for a brief moment life is joyful and unrestrained and we can all too briefly recapture all the possibilities that exist when you are a child.Enjoy!",5,Perfect Family Movie,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2582,"['Toby', 'Tyler', 'excellent', 'family', 'movie', 'rare', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'suitable', 'member', 'family', 'have', 'watched', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'multiple', 'times', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'child.Toby', 'Tyler', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'who', 'was', 'Disney', 'regular', 'child', 'appeared', 'Polyanna', 'A', 'Tiger', 'Walks', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'others', 'orphaned', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'However', 'life', 'hard', 'Toby', 'unloved', 'uncle', 'feel', 'burden', 'Toby', 'away', 'join', 'circus', 'passing', 'town.Toby', 'works', 'concessionaire', 'Mr.', 'Tupper', 'Bob', 'Sweeney', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Disney', 'Moon', 'Pilot', 'Son', 'Flubber', 'who', 'make', 'appear', 'helping', 'Toby', 'when', 'Toby', 'regularly', 'example', 'Mr.', 'Tupper', 'Toby', 'must', 'share', 'tips', 'Mr.', 'Tupper', 'Toby', 'also', 'protector', 'Ben', 'Cotter', 'Henry', 'Calvin', 'Babes', 'Toyland', 'Sergeant', 'Garcia', 'Disney', '1950', 'television', 'series', 'Zorro', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'friend', 'Toby', 'clown', 'Sam', 'Treat', 'Gene', 'Sheldon', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Babes', 'Toyland', 'Zorro', 'Mr.', 'Stubbs.Life', 'initially', 'difficult', 'nave', 'Toby', 'hard', 'time', 'focusing', 'job', 'keeping', 'food', 'Mr.', 'Stubbs', 'Even', 'chaos', 'follow', 'Toby', 'opportunity', 'Toby', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'circus', 'Somehow', 'things', 'just', 'never', 'seem', 'go', 'well', 'Toby', 'leave', 'circus', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'smiles', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'near', 'future.Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'seemed', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'again', 'again', 'However', 'Corcoran', 'excelled', 'Pollyanna', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'Toby', 'innocent', 'wild', 'world', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'world', 'Toby', 'Even', 'Toby', 'bad', 'experiences', 'Toby', 'also', 'do', 'very', 'exciting', 'things', 'just', 'moment', 'can', 'think', 'back', 'era', 'when', 'circuses', 'visited', 'smaller', 'towns', 'was', 'common', 'boys', 'least', 'think', 'running', 'away', 'join', 'hard', 'life', 'circus.The', 'marvelous', 'thing', 'movie', 'action', 'excitement', 'humor', 'yet', 'sufficiently', 'tame', 'even', 'youngest', 'members', 'family', 'portions', 'circus', 'see', 'add', 'excitement', 'story', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'know', 'life', 'complicated', 'messy', 'brief', 'moment', 'life', 'joyful', 'unrestrained', 'can', 'all', 'too', 'briefly', 'recapture', 'possibilities', 'exist', 'when', 'are', 'child.Enjoy']",Toby Tyler

Based on the 1880 children's book by James Otis Kaler, this oft overlooked Disney live-action classic from 1960 is the tale of a small boy who does just that! After an encounter with a very friendly circus concessionaire and an unpleasant verbal lashing from his cruel Uncle Daniel, little Toby Tyler (official Disney Legend Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran) hits the road to be an assistant concessionaire himself. Now a part of the Big Top family, Toby learns the ins and outs of circus life from a non-performer point of view, making friends with a secretly soft-hearted strongman, a delightfully kind and wise clown, and a sweet little girl whose horse-riding skills make her a starring attraction. But it's not all cotton candy for Toby once his concessionaire boss, Mr. Tupper, quickly reveals his true colors as a selfish and greedy opportunist. But it seems best friends can be even more trouble, as Toby's closest circus pal, the mischievous little chimp Mr. Stubbs, seems to get the boy into predicament after predicament by simply acting like a chimp. It's all in good fun though, despite one dangerous mishap when the monkeys break loose in a small town and Mr. Stubbs gets his hands on a Sherriff's guns, but Toby repeatedly shows his willingness to face any situation rather than runaway like everyone expects him to, even when a fib and a thrust into the center ring get him in over his head.So, what makes ""Toby Tyler"" such a great family film, great enough to be considered by many to be among Disney's best? Well, there isn't really anything bad to say about the film, I don't even think it's as predictable as some may have said and is instead rather original, but I think the real charm of it is how 3 dimensional all the characters are! Yes, this is a family film where everyone has real depth of emotion; everyone seems like a real person! Even the manipulative Mr. Tupper (Bob Sweeney) has more personality traits than greedy and selfish. Truly, he does seem to take some pleasure and pride in seeing Toby's moments of success, even if he never ceases to lookout for number one. And the performances of these wonderfully real characters! They're just excellent! And why not, when ""Toby Tyler"" stars some of Disney's finest, including Zorro's Henry Calvin as strongman Ben Cotter and Gene Sheldon as clown Sam Treat. The film is also brimming with the sights and sounds and nostalgic charm of an old fashioned circus and the small towns it passes through. Plus, it's got a monkey! A monkey! What's not to love?! I'll tell ya what's not to love: Toby's mean uncle. Even at the end of the film, I don't like the man. But, hey, still a wonderful, feel-good, family classic!Every kid should get to see ""Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks with a Circus"" at least once, so thank goodness it is finally available on DVD! The DVD itself is a mix of good and bad. Everything it's got is good (the issue of formatting is in question with a lot of these old Disney films, and there is a good chance the fullscreen here IS appropriate). The problem is what this DVD hasn't got; specifically, bonus features. There's not a one. That's not all that unusual with classic Disney live-action, but it's still inexcusable, especially when Kevin Corcoran was brought in to do interviews and such for other films released to DVD around the same time. He's a big part of the Old Yeller DVD, so why don't we get so much as an interview here? Or the Walt Disney TV series intros for the television airings? Or even a trailer? Well, it's enough to complain about but not a reason to pass up on this excellent film that should be in everyone's home library. I recommend that you pick up this DVD before it becomes nearly impossible to find like so many other Disney live-action classics that I'm still trying to catch up with myself!",5,One of Disney's best!,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,3933,"['ever', 'wanted', 'run', 'away', 'join', 'circus', 'kid', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'Ten', 'Weeks', 'Circus', 'film', 'Based', '1880', 'children', 'book', 'James', 'Otis', 'Kaler', 'oft', 'overlooked', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'classic', '1960', 'tale', 'small', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'encounter', 'very', 'friendly', 'circus', 'concessionaire', 'unpleasant', 'verbal', 'lashing', 'cruel', 'Uncle', 'Daniel', 'little', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'official', 'Disney', 'Legend', 'Kevin', 'Moochie', 'Corcoran', 'road', 'be', 'assistant', 'concessionaire', 'Now', 'part', 'Big', 'Top', 'family', 'Toby', 'ins', 'outs', 'circus', 'life', 'non-performer', 'point', 'view', 'making', 'friends', 'secretly', 'soft-hearted', 'strongman', 'delightfully', 'kind', 'wise', 'clown', 'sweet', 'little', 'girl', 'horse-riding', 'skills', 'make', 'starring', 'attraction', 'not', 'cotton', 'candy', 'Toby', 'once', 'concessionaire', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Tupper', 'quickly', 'reveals', 'true', 'colors', 'selfish', 'greedy', 'opportunist', 'best', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'trouble', 'Toby', 'closest', 'circus', 'pal', 'mischievous', 'little', 'chimp', 'Mr.', 'Stubbs', 'get', 'boy', 'predicament', 'predicament', 'simply', 'acting', 'chimp', 'good', 'fun', 'one', 'dangerous', 'mishap', 'when', 'monkeys', 'break', 'loose', 'small', 'town', 'Mr.', 'Stubbs', 'hands', 'Sherriff', 'guns', 'Toby', 'repeatedly', 'willingness', 'face', 'situation', 'rather', 'runaway', 'everyone', 'even', 'when', 'fib', 'thrust', 'center', 'ring', 'get', 'head.So', 'what', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'such', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'great', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'Disney', 'best', 'Well', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'as', 'predictable', 'may', 'have', 'said', 'instead', 'rather', 'original', 'think', 'real', 'charm', 'how', '3', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'Yes', 'family', 'film', 'where', 'everyone', 'real', 'depth', 'emotion', 'everyone', 'real', 'person', 'Even', 'manipulative', 'Mr.', 'Tupper', 'Bob', 'Sweeney', 'more', 'personality', 'traits', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'Truly', 'seem', 'take', 'pleasure', 'pride', 'seeing', 'Toby', 'moments', 'success', 'even', 'never', 'lookout', 'number', 'one', 'performances', 'wonderfully', 'real', 'characters', ""'re"", 'just', 'excellent', 'why', 'not', 'when', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'Disney', 'finest', 'including', 'Zorro', 'Henry', 'Calvin', 'strongman', 'Ben', 'Cotter', 'Gene', 'Sheldon', 'clown', 'Sam', 'Treat', 'film', 'also', 'brimming', 'sights', 'sounds', 'nostalgic', 'charm', 'old', 'fashioned', 'circus', 'small', 'towns', 'got', 'monkey', 'monkey', 'What', 'not', 'love', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'ya', 'what', 'not', 'love', 'Toby', 'mean', 'uncle', 'Even', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'man', 'hey', 'still', 'wonderful', 'feel-good', 'family', 'classic', 'kid', 'should', 'get', 'see', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'Ten', 'Weeks', 'Circus', 'least', 'once', 'thank', 'goodness', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'mix', 'good', 'bad', 'Everything', 'got', 'good', 'issue', 'formatting', 'question', 'lot', 'old', 'Disney', 'films', 'good', 'chance', 'fullscreen', 'here', 'IS', 'appropriate', 'problem', 'what', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'got', 'specifically', 'bonus', 'features', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'unusual', 'classic', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'still', 'inexcusable', 'especially', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'was', 'brought', 'do', 'interviews', 'such', 'other', 'films', 'released', 'DVD', 'same', 'time', 'big', 'part', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'DVD', 'so', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'much', 'interview', 'here', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'TV', 'series', 'intros', 'television', 'airings', 'even', 'trailer', 'Well', 'enough', 'complain', 'about', 'not', 'reason', 'pass', 'up', 'excellent', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'home', 'library', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'find', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'classics', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'catch', 'up']",Toby Tyler

The almost copyrighted close one eye in squint to gaze upward in ponder that 'Moochie' does best finds believable opportunity here.The story line begins as expected with the unloved un-WANTED and percievably un-welcome orphan taking it upon himself to accept the hospatility of flashy, intrieguing  strangers.  A concessionaire literally lures Toby into the extended circus family only to be less than benevolent to the boy.  Here it is that Mr Walt portrays the mistreated youth completely sans what today would have called for explicit molestation, wounding, personal damage.But the youth is KIND.  The youth is just that; a youth - a real child.  Toby is curious.  Toby is polite as best as he knows how. Toby is thoughtful.  Toby has some fun.  Toby likes some people and he doesn't like others.  Toby is not amorous but he does love (characterized by the Toby's friendship with his horse...  well, it WOULD have been a horse if this had been a western.  But since this is a circus movie his affectionate companion is a chimpanzee). Comic relief?  like a dwarf maybe.  Portral of emulatable ethics?  Absolutely.

630599,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JNF1,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","""Toby Tyler"" (1960) is one of my earliest movie memories. In combination with the film Whitman Publishing released a book of the screenplay, which differed considerably from the source novel, managing to lighten up the story.Most boys (at least in my class) were at first reluctant to see the film because it's star, Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran, had pretty much ruined the ""Spin and Marty"" serial when he was added to the cast after the first season. We also had suffered through his ""too cute"" acting in ""Old Yeller"". Rare is the child actor who was more irritating to his contemporaries. But ""Moochie"" was just a hammy kid who did what the director wanted; and fortunately the director of ""Toby Tyler"" dialed down the standard ""Moochie"" cuteness for his first staring role.The film was the perfect escape for boys. Running away with the circus was almost as good as getting to spend the whole summer riding horses on the Triple ""R"" Ranch. Plus Toby's protector was Ben Cotter, our old friend Sgt. Garcia from ""Zorro"". Mr. Stubbs the chimp is given the ""too cute"" supporting role that ""Moochie"" normally played, which was most likely an attempt to expand the target audience to include pre-teen girls. It worked as the film entertained the entire family.The story involves Toby's efforts to move from peanut vendor to circus performer. He eventually replaces a snotty boy in a bareback riding act. His partner is Mademoiselle Jeanette (Barbara Beaird), my first crush and most likely the reason that I remember the film so fondly.Then again, what do I know?
