1420598,A1TRRIAA44W5OO,B004N21KIC,Accen28,"[3, 4]","I watched the previews, and my first impression was that this movie might be similar to Loving Annabelle, with a similar theme of a teacher and student falling in love with each other. I love movies set in a collegiate setting, as long as they're not of the Animal House variety, and a college film with lesbians is right up my alley, but even in the previews there was something ""off"" about the relationship. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just didn't have a good impression about the teacher. I didn't like her, so I didn't watch the movie right away when it came out. Then I read some reviews that talked about how good it was, so I decided to give it a try. I made the unfortunate decision to purchase the movie, because it was on sale at a good price. Stupid me. Recommendation: Don't do it. Rent it if you're curious. Don't waste your money buying it. I will never watch this movie again, ever. It's that bad.Let's start with something positive. The film quality was excellent. It's a visually striking movie, and really evokes the college atmosphere. The idea of a child TV star who grows up and goes to college is interesting and original, or could have been. It's also gratifying that the star seems to be comfortable with her sexuality. This isn't a movie about someone who is struggling with her sexual identity, so that's refreshing.The story is really very simple, and is revealed in the previews, so I'm not really spoiling anything by writing this: Child star goes to college, meets a female teacher with whom she becomes intimately involved, then is offered a new role that threatens the ""relationship."" Instant conflict. Okay. I have no problem with that as an idea. My issue is how it was handled in this film. The two stars have no chemistry. They're both extremely attractive, but there isn't any relationship buildup, no attraction between them other than the most base form of physical attraction. The love scenes aren't satisfying, and come off as slightly creepy, because of the perceived age difference and the lack of a real connection on an emotional level (in a stark contrast to Loving Annabelle, which handled a similar plot in a much more nuanced way). I wanted to like these characters, but in the end I didn't care whether they were together, and in fact, was relieved that it didn't work out. The way the teacher felt at the party was the same way I felt watching this film -- uncomfortable.They had a good opportunity to do something interesting with the mother/daughter relationship. It was a lot more complex than the one between the leads, or it could have been. The film doesn't really develop that part of the film much. It seems like an after-thought, and comes off one dimensional and cliched as a result. No, she's not a stage mother, as she points out. She's the mother who doesn't want to be over-shadowed by her famous daughter, but likes the money and attention she gets. There's also the subtext of the teacher as ""mother"" substitute, which could have been interesting if they worked with that theme a little. They didn't, though.I gave this film two stars because of the production values. It's a pretty film.",2,I regret buying this movie.,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3165,"['watched', 'previews', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'similar', 'Loving', 'Annabelle', 'similar', 'theme', 'teacher', 'student', 'falling', 'love', 'other', 'love', 'movies', 'set', 'collegiate', 'setting', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'Animal', 'House', 'variety', 'college', 'film', 'lesbians', 'right', 'alley', 'even', 'previews', 'was', 'something', 'relationship', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'impression', 'teacher', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Then', 'read', 'reviews', 'talked', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'made', 'unfortunate', 'decision', 'purchase', 'movie', 'was', 'sale', 'good', 'price', 'Stupid', 'Recommendation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Rent', ""'re"", 'curious', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'ever', 'bad.Let', 'start', 'something', 'positive', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'visually', 'striking', 'movie', 'really', 'evokes', 'college', 'atmosphere', 'idea', 'child', 'TV', 'star', 'who', 'up', 'college', 'interesting', 'original', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'also', 'gratifying', 'star', 'be', 'comfortable', 'sexuality', ""n't"", 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'struggling', 'sexual', 'identity', 'refreshing.The', 'story', 'really', 'very', 'simple', 'revealed', 'previews', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'writing', 'Child', 'star', 'college', 'female', 'teacher', 'whom', 'intimately', 'involved', 'then', 'offered', 'new', 'role', 'relationship', 'Instant', 'conflict', 'Okay', 'have', 'problem', 'idea', 'issue', 'how', 'was', 'handled', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'have', 'chemistry', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'relationship', 'buildup', 'attraction', 'other', 'most', 'base', 'form', 'physical', 'attraction', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'come', 'off', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'perceived', 'age', 'difference', 'lack', 'real', 'connection', 'emotional', 'level', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Loving', 'Annabelle', 'handled', 'similar', 'plot', 'much', 'more', 'nuanced', 'way', 'wanted', 'characters', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'were', 'together', 'fact', 'was', 'relieved', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'teacher', 'felt', 'party', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'felt', 'watching', 'film', 'uncomfortable.They', 'had', 'good', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'mother/daughter', 'relationship', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'one', 'leads', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'part', 'film', 'much', 'after-thought', 'off', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cliched', 'result', 'No', 'not', 'stage', 'mother', 'out', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'over-shadowed', 'famous', 'daughter', 'money', 'attention', 'also', 'subtext', 'teacher', 'mother', 'substitute', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'worked', 'little', 'did', ""n't"", 'though.I', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'pretty', 'film']",Bloomington

Heck, they show a lot worse in PG-13 romantic comedies at multi-plex matinee shows.In this case the featured couple is female, one a college student and one a professor.  The student is a semi-famous ex-starlet, having had a well received run on a sci-fi television series now in syndication. The professor is beautiful and wealthy, with a predatory reputation.Sure enough, the professor swoops down very early in the movie, but this first part is more romantic and sweet than sordid, even given the forbidden nature of the liaison.  At the end of the first half, you'll be wondering what happened to the fierce predator, as the professor tenderly nurtures her young chick, taking her completely under her wing.  Regardless, this is the best part of the movie, with great acting and palpable chemistry between the two.Other than that the student has a less than perfect relationship with her mother (and therefore may be looking for a substitute) and that the professor inherited a fortune (and is lonely), there isn't any more back-story or character development, so when the movie heads downhill in the second half, you're left wondering what the heck happened.The material was there for a good romantic drama with a better resolved ending, but the filmmakers wrapped it up far too abruptly, leaving this viewer feeling short changed when the credits started rolling.Amanda Richards, July 17, 2011",3,Hot for teacher,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,1622,"['think', 'education', ""'ve"", 'missedBut', 'then', 'homework', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'Van', 'HalenFor', 'hoping', 'naughty', 'teacher/student', 'romp', 'be', 'warned', 'rather', 'tame', 'hanky-panky', 'department', 'Heck', 'show', 'lot', 'worse', 'PG-13', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'multi-plex', 'matinee', 'shows.In', 'case', 'featured', 'couple', 'female', 'one', 'college', 'student', 'one', 'professor', 'student', 'semi-famous', 'ex-starlet', 'having', 'had', 'well', 'received', 'run', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'series', 'now', 'syndication', 'professor', 'beautiful', 'wealthy', 'predatory', 'reputation.Sure', 'enough', 'professor', 'down', 'very', 'early', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'more', 'romantic', 'sweet', 'sordid', 'even', 'given', 'forbidden', 'nature', 'liaison', 'end', 'first', 'half', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'fierce', 'predator', 'professor', 'tenderly', 'young', 'chick', 'taking', 'completely', 'wing', 'Regardless', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'two.Other', 'student', 'less', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'mother', 'therefore', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'substitute', 'professor', 'inherited', 'fortune', 'lonely', ""n't"", 'more', 'back-story', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'when', 'movie', 'heads', 'downhill', 'second', 'half', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'heck', 'happened.The', 'material', 'was', 'there', 'good', 'romantic', 'drama', 'better', 'resolved', 'ending', 'filmmakers', 'wrapped', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'short', 'changed', 'when', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '17', '2011']",Bloomington

As for this film being marketed as a ""lesbian genre"" movie: what the two do in bed together may fall under the classification of homosexual, but the gears shift in a different direction the moment Catherine takes a man up to her bedroom and Jackie rolls the hay with a male student admirer. This doesn't mean that bisexuals shouldn't also be able to have their version of relationships on film; but had either one or both, instead, sought solace in the arms of another woman after the requisite breakup then it would have at least justified the ""lesbian"" category.

In fact, practically all the interpersonal scenes not only rarely occur but seemed too artificially contrived to simply create tension and conflict for a movie effect. Second, the likelihood that a college prof could get away with sexual relations on numerous occasions with students nears the probability of a meteorite hitting this computer in the next thousand years. Third, even the rather quickly developing relationship was just not real especially for two highly educated people one of whom is essentially participating for the first time.

I also struggled slightly with what seemed like the lightening seduction of the student. But I could forgive the ending because realistically you have two people in completely different places in their lives explaining what happens. I was slightly thrown by a few scenes that seemed incongruous. After watching the extras I realized it was because they had been inserted basically out of sequence of story events during editing. I can only guess that the editor / director liked them so much they could not leave them out despite the oddity.

Of course, people recognize her some like her, some don't, others just don't care. However, all those people's opinions could matter less once she meets Catherine. Catherine is a Psych professor in the University and there are SO many rumors surrounding her, people find her for some reason intimidating and advice Jackie to stay away from her. Jackie in response feels curious about this ""woman"" but she doesn't say anything until Catherine approaches her and BAM you guessed it they embark an affair.MY OPINION :Well, For a lesbian movie and a Teacher/student one at that, a person would assume a LOT of things that things being lots of Hot sex scenes, lots of drama, the danger of being caught, the (Taboo) of the relationship and of course a Happy Ending.In this film, you get a good acting and the plot actually made sense. It was also realistic and Romantic Somewhat without being cheesy or over the top. Both Jackie and Catherine were mature, and handled their relationship as adults not as whiny teenagers which is Good.So why 3.5 stars instead of 5 ? It's not the movie's fault, but I guess I'm a very Romantic person I can't help it. This movie was so Realistic for me, I didn't get my Disney Happy Ending and I was disappointed a LOT because of that. I wanted the characters to fight for their right to be together, I wanted them to come up with a solution. I wanted them to show passion and great love for each other, greater than anything else in life. I wanted them to put their love first and all the rest of the things to fall behind it. The Other problem I found in this movie, though not as a big deal as the first is the sex/love scenes. You would expect them to be Hot ? Sexy ? But they felt, more like cuddling to me. When the lead actresses were having sex, I never believed it was sex. There was hardly any nudity to make me believe that.Overall, Good Movie and like what I said the acting was great and the plot was good too if not for those two flaws I mentioned above I would rate this a 5. It's still good to watch though.

The hype and build-up of the story line led me to believe this was a lesbian film. Turns out it wasn't. It was a bisexual film. Though I do not have a problem with bisexuality, I would LOVE to see a film about two women falling in love and NOT have one or both of them eventually sleep with a guy. It takes away the merit of the film, a lot like ""The Kids Are Alright."" It seems film makers are trying to redefine sexuality as a whole and portray lesbians as really bisexual and just sleeping with women until a guy comes along. It's insulting, degrading, and holds no merit. I would NOT recommend this film to anyone.The relationship between the women was not believable. They start out just glancing at each other in an office and then before anyone knew what was going on they were in a sexual relationship. There was no pretense that Jackie had attraction to women before hand yet seemed to fall into the sexual relationship with a woman very easily. The chemistry wasn't believable either. Honestly, it creeped me out. The way the professor seemed to prey on this young woman just had an air of pedophilia. I head a lot of hype about this film on AfterEllen.com and the whole of the film just disappointed me.

However, there was just no chemistry between the young college student (who looked liked she was in high school) and the professor.  The story takes place over a two year period but there's no evolution in plot or their relationship.  The professor has a well known reputation for sleeping with her female students without reparation; however, in the end her undoing is nothing more than a photo that shows her answering her front door with a female student standing with her back to the camera.  There was no money shot of the professor kissing or hugging the student.  In fact,  the photo was so innocuous no intelligent board of director's would have fired a teacher over it.  The student could have been selling magazines for all anyone knew.The main problem with this movie was the poorly written script.  But, even a good director should be able to turn a poor script into believable character development.  We're supposed to believe that a professor would just walk up to a student, kiss her and say, ""let's go back to my place.""  It truly causes one to think the script was written by someone who usually writes for the porn industry.  Only they left their clothes on.  All of them.  I have nothing against a movie with no nudity, but who wakes up after a night of love making with her bra, cami and underwear still fully intact?  Was it filmed by college virgins?The fact that the professor was very wealthy made it easy not to care that she lost her job in the end.  If she was a struggling professor, there would have been more emotion attached to the outcome.  This film should be shown to film students as a ""what not to do"" example.

1420630,AVTAKCRJIRZKD,B004N21KIC,Teresa Rimmer,"[8, 9]","I read the reviews, prior to renting this movie.  Most reviews had the usual complaints of dialogue and sets, but no one talked about the actors, or the story line.I was hesitant, but thought that unlike ""Loving Annabelle"", this would be a bit more ""adult"", given the setting was a college and not a high school. Wrong!  The actress who portrayed ""Jackie"" looked like she was 12, but supposed to be more like 20.  That was a bit creepy. I can think of a number of early 20 somethings who would look more like they were 20, and not a 12 year old.Also, the character of Catherine was just plain predatory.  While college professors are teaching adults, and therefore, it's consensual, the character was on the hunt, and then acted like a 16 year old once they had hooked up.I agree with previous reviews that the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and was, quite frankly, unrealistic.  If you've ever set foot on a college campus, and have spent any time talking/socializing with the staff, the idea that 1) this professor could hook up with freshmen semester after semester without any problems was a bit much and then, 2) when she is ""caught"", she is dismissed.  Really?  What century is this?Is it horrible?  No.  Is it good? No.  Worth buying?  Definitely not.  Save the 20 bucks, rent it if you enjoy 2 actresses having sex that act and look more like mother/daughter then lovers.

This movie is about a college professor with co dependancy issues who has a tendency of getting mixed up with the students (hey their in college, its not like its illegal, its just not cool with the schools) and a naive ex child star who tried to pull off this cool with it im not stuck on my kiddy tv show fame additude.  The kid really doesnt know what shes doing. the teacher knows exactly what shes doing. the movies more sexed up than loving annabelle but if thats what your looking for its not all that appealing anyway because you know that the kids well, stupid. Neither of them are gay though they seem to think that they are both wind up fooling around with guys just to set eachother off. im not saying i hated this movie and if i wanted to curl up on the couch and stay home one friday night with my dog and just chill ill probably watch it again but i wouldnt pay full price for it. to be honest id just stream it through amazon. thats what i did. that way i didnt feel like id lost out on money, got 3 days to watch it on my fire and practically no harm to my wallet done. its not a great movie and if your looking for a love sory of this genre id suggest loving annabelle. its got heart to it. this movie was more preditory than anything else. i was actually thinking they were gonna pull a lip service (the movie, also good) move and just beat the crap out of eachother.",3,not loving annabelle with some spoilers,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1688,"['descriptions', 'same', 'famous', 'student', 'school', 'mixed', 'up', 'teacher', 'same', 'sex', 'everyone', 'live', 'consequenses', 'may', 'come', 'thats', 'where', 'likeness', 'ends.loving', 'annabelle', 'had', 'student', 'teacher', 'had', 'mature', 'love', 'one', 'movie', 'college', 'professor', 'co', 'dependancy', 'issues', 'who', 'tendency', 'getting', 'mixed', 'students', 'hey', 'college', 'not', 'illegal', 'just', 'not', 'cool', 'schools', 'naive', 'ex', 'child', 'star', 'who', 'tried', 'pull', 'off', 'cool', 'not', 'stuck', 'kiddy', 'tv', 'show', 'fame', 'additude', 'kid', 'really', 'doesnt', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'teacher', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'movies', 'more', 'sexed', 'up', 'loving', 'annabelle', 'thats', 'what', 'looking', 'not', 'appealing', 'anyway', 'know', 'kids', 'well', 'stupid', 'are', 'gay', 'seem', 'think', 'are', 'wind', 'up', 'fooling', 'guys', 'just', 'set', 'off', 'im', 'not', 'saying', 'i', 'hated', 'movie', 'i', 'wanted', 'curl', 'up', 'couch', 'stay', 'home', 'one', 'friday', 'night', 'dog', 'just', 'chill', 'ill', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'be', 'honest', 'id', 'just', 'stream', 'amazon', 'thats', 'what', 'i', 'did', 'way', 'i', 'didnt', 'feel', 'id', 'lost', 'out', 'money', 'got', '3', 'days', 'watch', 'fire', 'practically', 'harm', 'wallet', 'done', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'looking', 'love', 'sory', 'genre', 'id', 'suggest', 'loving', 'annabelle', 'got', 'heart', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'preditory', 'anything', 'else', 'i', 'was', 'actually', 'thinking', 'were', 'gon', 'pull', 'lip', 'service', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'move', 'just', 'beat', 'crap', 'eachother']",Bloomington
