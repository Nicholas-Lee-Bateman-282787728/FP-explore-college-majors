In particular, when a writer creates a screenplay that threatens to take down the greatest actress of our generation (maybe ever) - Meryl Streep - then the writer deserves more than a Razzie.But it's not just the writer who is at fault.  The soundtrack is absolutely grating.  Now, I myself have always liked Carly Simon over the years, but Ms. Simon has many songs, many of them very good.  Why is it then that she, or those doing post production work, decided to use ""Coming Around Again"" over and over again, maybe with the original at first, and then variant instrumental versions?  Why not other songs, such as ""You're So Vain"" for example?  Wouldn't that song have fit the Jack Nicholson character as well?  Let's mix it up a bit here!In this film, Ms. Streep's character is a mess but she's supposed to be.  So, well played once again with what she had to work with.  But the movie feels like a mess as well, little scenes thrown in just because they seemingly have to be in any movie.  Weddings, dinner parties, pity parties, etc.  I would say that if you've just gone through a bad breakup and want to lay around and eat ice cream and cry like a little baby, this film might be just for you.

Of course she is so blissfully happy and pregnant that she is clueless and Ms Streep makes this evident without saying a word. And, who else can look so glowingly beautiful one minute and so witch like a minute later. Stockard Channing is unique and I've never understood why she wasn't a bigger star. All of the supporting cast is wonderful.If this story is really based on real life as reported then bless her heart I hope she settled into her well earned success and flipped him off every time she saw him.

This wonderfully gifted actress is capable of taking any role and infusing it with such passion and dedication that she can make a dull movie like HEARTBURN entertaining, just to bask in the glow of her performance.  Based on Nora Ephron's novel and her marriage to Carl Bernstein, HEARTBURN doesn't really ""do"" much of anything.  Streep marries philandering Jack Nicholson (in one of his more bland performances), has a couple of kids, and finds out he's cheating on her (duh?).  Ephron's script cripples its stars by making Streep a little too whiny and self-pitying and Nicholson a little too dispassionate and predictable.  One of the true crimes of this movie is Oscar's neglect to praise the movie's showpiece song COMIN AROUND AGAIN.  Carly Simon's song poignantly evokes the loss but hope in any kind of relationship; it's pairing with the old children's ITSY BITSY SPIDER is creative genius.  The spider gets washed down the spout but always goes back up to try again; in COMIN AROUND AGAIN, the song's emphasis on ""I believe in love"" mirrors the tenacity of the spider.

The cinematography is interesting, lots of very long takes and surprising camera angles. The wedding vows, for example, are shown from the point of view of the rabbi, and we see the couple's faces in closeup throughout. Some of the scenes are true to life, touching, and better than similar scenes in other films. The childbirth sequences, for example, have no peer I can think of. There are a few funny scenes as well, especially one in which Meryl Streep describes a (fake) embarrassment pertaining to romantic rival to a gossipy friend (excellently played by Catherine O'Hara).The film has problems, though, chief among them that the story is overly simplistic. Streep's character marries a guy who cheats on her. We are given no reason why he cheats. She splits with him, gets back together, and he cheats again, worse even than the first time. No reason is given; Streep's character (a stand-in for author Nora Ephron) is basically a saint. I can see where writing this might have been therapeutic for Ephron, but it's not dramatically interesting.Also, the couple buys a rundown house in Washington DC upon getting married. There is some failed humor as they fix it up, and all looks cleaned up and good before Streep realizes her husband's infidelity. Then, in step with the decay in their marriage, we see the house falling apart too -- rain comes in through the ceiling, and in a late scene we are shown open channels for electrical cables in the walls. Symbolically, the house was never as good as we had thought. Maybe for some this would be smart, but I thought it was too heavy handed.Decent acting by all the main characters; the problem was the script, not the performances.p.s. watch for an amusing early appearance by Kevin Spacey as an urban criminal.",3,"an odd film, much to like but not a success overall",1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,1848,"['unusual', 'film', 'lightly', 'plotted', 'rendition', 'end', 'marriage', 'cinematography', 'interesting', 'lots', 'very', 'long', 'surprising', 'camera', 'angles', 'wedding', 'vows', 'example', 'are', 'shown', 'point', 'view', 'rabbi', 'see', 'couple', 'closeup', 'scenes', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'touching', 'better', 'similar', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'childbirth', 'sequences', 'example', 'have', 'peer', 'can', 'think', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'one', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fake', 'embarrassment', 'pertaining', 'romantic', 'rival', 'gossipy', 'friend', 'excellently', 'played', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", '.The', 'film', 'problems', 'though', 'chief', 'story', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'Streep', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'reason', 'why', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'worse', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'reason', 'given', 'Streep', 'character', 'stand-in', 'author', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'basically', 'saint', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'writing', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'therapeutic', 'Ephron', 'not', 'dramatically', 'interesting.Also', 'couple', 'rundown', 'house', 'Washington', 'DC', 'getting', 'married', 'failed', 'humor', 'fix', 'up', 'looks', 'cleaned', 'up', 'good', 'before', 'Streep', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'Then', 'step', 'decay', 'marriage', 'see', 'house', 'falling', 'apart', 'too', 'rain', 'ceiling', 'late', 'scene', 'are', 'shown', 'open', 'channels', 'electrical', 'cables', 'walls', 'Symbolically', 'house', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'thought', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed.Decent', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'problem', 'was', 'script', 'not', 'performances.p.s', 'watch', 'amusing', 'early', 'appearance', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'urban', 'criminal']",N/A

This was a movie of her life and marriage to Carl Bernstein.Nora was ravaged by the critics for this book and film, but time was on her side .Norah always stood up for women and their roles in life. She worked and lived in a man's world. She took the slings and arrows for many of us. This film is a must see about the life of a marriage when one spouse cheats. It is down and dirty and lovely!  Meryl Streep plays Norah's part, and Jack Nicholson plays the part of the husband. He was always a lady's man, and it seems he never stopped. He was a DC journalist and Streep plays the part of a food writer . Jack is not likable, charming, yes, but despicable. He cheats on Meryl while she is pregnant with their second child .  The most amusing part of the film is that Meryl spreads ugly rumors about the woman Jack is cheating with.  Meryl takes Jack back, but as times goes on, she knows he will continue his philandering, and she leaves. She has enough sense of herself to know that she will never be happy, otherwise.Norah Ephron is a woman to be much admired. A true forerunner of the modern woman.

In a moment of total boredom I found it on Netflix and downloaded it, knowing only that it starred Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. I didn't realize until it was over that it was based on the Nora Ephron/Carl Bernstein marriage.  This was an advantage as I had no expectations of what would happen and I didn't have any preconceptions about the characters.  I liked the Nicholson character a lot -- he seemed warm and very funny and genuinely fond of Streep and their child.  Frankly I never knew what he saw in the Streep character as she seemed like an unpleasant, unattractive, not particularly nice woman.  No wonder he began to have a roaming eye, I thought as the film progressed.  Howevever being Hollywood I figured they'd have a happy ending cooked up and so I was somewhat pleased that it ended the way it did.Then, after the credits rolled and I realized that this was indeed written by Nora Ephron it all clicked into place.  As another reviewer said, it's obviously a revenge move by Ephron and that doesn't make a good basis for a work of art.  Despite the excellent direction and the world class stars and very good supporting cast, this is mostly a waste of time.Plot summary: unlikable woman marries jerk, jerk cheats on her, woman runs to daddy, jerk comes for her and woman goes back with him, jerk cheats again, woman lives in denial for a long time, finally wakes up, throws a pie in jerk's face and goes running back to daddy.  Meanwhile their smart, clever friends quip cleverly about the affairs of other of their smart,clever friends.  They all have a lot of money, live in nice homes in DC and NYC, wear good clothes and hire women of color to clean their homes and watch the children.
