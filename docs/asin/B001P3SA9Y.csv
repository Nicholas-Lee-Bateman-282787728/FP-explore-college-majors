1225740,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B001P3SA9Y,Allen,"[1, 1]","In Chicago, the boy Jake (Matthew Knight) is interned in a mental institution and his therapist Dr. Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) does not believe that he is haunted by the ghost of the boy Toshio. When Jake is killed in his cell with all his bones broken, Dr. Sullivan decides to investigate further with open-mind. Meanwhile, Lisa (Johanna Braddy), who is the sister of the super Max (Gil McKinney) of Jake's building, steals the key of apartment 305 to have sex with her boyfriend Andy (Beau Mirchoff). When she realizes that the spot is a crime scene, she immediately returns to her apartment, where she lives with Max and their sister Rose (Jadie Hobson). In the meantime, the Japanese Naoko (Emi Ikehata) decides to travel from Tokyo to Chicago to stop the curse of her sister Kayako. She meets Lisa and tells that she needs hers and Rose's help her to stop the fiend of her sister, but Lisa does not accept the offer. When Max is possessed by the evil spirit of Daisuke (Takatsuma Mukai), Lisa visits Naoko but it may be too late to stop the curse.""The Grudge 3"" is better and better than the second movie of the franchise. The screenplay is well-developed and the ghosts are very creepy and scary. Max recalls Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining"" when he is possessed. Lisa is a character quite dumb and her stupid attitude refusing to help Naoko is the weakest part of this good sequel. Now it seems that Naoko has reborn the curse, but I hope the producers stop this franchise.

The first Grudge film managed to be scary throughout by setting a tone and mood. The films since the first one have not been able to capture this eerie feeling.Grudge 3 just doesn't work. It's not scary, the characters are uninteresting and the new pretzel ghost can't hold a candle to the original.I found it funny that the kid ghost is now bigger, taller and has taken to wearing brown shorts. I wonder if he'll be a teenage ghost in the 4th one?The first Grudge is a horror classic as far as I'm concerned. Although the 2nd one was not bad it did not measure up to the first.

1225742,A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B001P3SA9Y,"Brian Long ""Brian""","[1, 2]","The series that won't die continues with a third installation. Focusing again on the building in Chicago, the survivors of Grudge 2 are picked off in quick succession. This leaves Alex and his sisters Rose and Sam alone to fight off Kayoko, until receiving a visit from Naoko, Kayoko's sister. Things quickly deteriorate in a Shining like fashion as Alex struggles with keeping the building together and his sister alive.The scares in this iteration have drastically deteriorated, and just about all of time involve Kayoko walking or Toshio meowing annoyingly. What suspense and tension there was in the first movie has evaporated completely. There are a few tolerable moments and honest efforts to try something different, but they end up feeling like cut outs from the Ring.The characters have regressed to pancakes, and a couple are so forgettable that you don't recognize them or care when they die. The ceremony near the end of the movie, one of the few moments where they could've made a good impression, involves too many candles and speaking in tongues. The few people who know whats going on refuse to act, of even call the cops when necessary, as giving the illusion of helping means making a decision. Cowering quietly in a corner for fifteen minutes is what is called for.While the movie is pedantic and dull, it at least tried to keep things scary, and even tried to offer a tolerable explanation for the overall storyline. This does not do enough to paper over glaring plot holes, terrible acting, and startle scary scenes that do neither. The first Grudge managed to be scary by keeping things subtle, muted, making the scares a combination of seemingly mundane things. This lost sight of that so badly it almost spits on the series as a whole.",3,There are far worse dtv movies,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,1759,"['series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'third', 'installation', 'Focusing', 'again', 'building', 'Chicago', 'survivors', 'Grudge', '2', 'are', 'picked', 'off', 'quick', 'succession', 'Alex', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'Sam', 'alone', 'fight', 'off', 'Kayoko', 'receiving', 'visit', 'Naoko', 'Kayoko', 'sister', 'Things', 'quickly', 'deteriorate', 'Shining', 'like', 'fashion', 'Alex', 'keeping', 'building', 'together', 'sister', 'alive.The', 'scares', 'iteration', 'have', 'drastically', 'deteriorated', 'just', 'time', 'involve', 'Kayoko', 'walking', 'Toshio', 'meowing', 'annoyingly', 'What', 'suspense', 'tension', 'there', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'evaporated', 'completely', 'are', 'few', 'tolerable', 'moments', 'honest', 'efforts', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'cut', 'outs', 'Ring.The', 'characters', 'have', 'regressed', 'pancakes', 'couple', 'are', 'so', 'forgettable', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'care', 'when', 'die', 'ceremony', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'good', 'impression', 'too', 'many', 'candles', 'speaking', 'tongues', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'refuse', 'act', 'even', 'call', 'cops', 'when', 'necessary', 'giving', 'illusion', 'helping', 'means', 'making', 'decision', 'Cowering', 'quietly', 'corner', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'what', 'called', 'for.While', 'movie', 'pedantic', 'dull', 'least', 'tried', 'keep', 'things', 'scary', 'even', 'tried', 'offer', 'tolerable', 'explanation', 'overall', 'storyline', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'paper', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'terrible', 'acting', 'startle', 'scary', 'scenes', 'do', 'first', 'Grudge', 'managed', 'be', 'scary', 'keeping', 'things', 'subtle', 'muted', 'making', 'scares', 'combination', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'things', 'lost', 'sight', 'so', 'badly', 'almost', 'series', 'whole']",The Grudge 3
1225743,A1EKJGX3WK6DI0,B001P3SA9Y,Chris,"[2, 2]","I can say that the movie focuses more on plot and details then it does scariness, but don't get me wrong, this movie had one point where it startled my mom who has been watching horror movies since she was young and never got startled like that in the past 10 years (the only other thing that scared her was ""The Shining"" when she was young).  The movie itself had a plot that branched out from the original, but still retained the original content to an extent.  I can say that if it wasn't for plot and details, they could have added in more scary moments, more thrills and still keep it to where the characters would just so that the audience can pick and choose their favorites.  The scary moments are really scary when it comes down to it, but I wasn't expecting that much gore from a movie that's more about scary than gory.  The ending was extremely predictable so I wasn't really expecting too much from the ending (There generally are 1-2 survivors in American remakes, whereas Japanese horror there's no stopping the force and therefore generally no survivors).  Other then that the movie was pretty good.  The only reason I emphasis the plot and details is because the movie has basically 8-12 scary moments, which is good for a movie, but left me and anyone else I was watching it with crave for more.  Just as a quick summary of what I said; Originals = Good, Remakes = not as good; too much plot and details to be perfectly scary, but is still pretty scary when looking at the whole thing; too typical of a movie ending (survivors, but only to an extent do they survive) to give 5/5 stars, but is too good for a 3/5 stars.",4,Not as Scary as the original.,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1636,"['can', 'say', 'movie', 'more', 'plot', 'details', 'then', 'scariness', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'startled', 'mom', 'who', 'been', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'young', 'never', 'got', 'startled', 'past', '10', 'years', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'scared', 'was', 'Shining', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'movie', 'had', 'plot', 'branched', 'out', 'original', 'still', 'retained', 'original', 'content', 'extent', 'can', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'plot', 'details', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'scary', 'moments', 'more', 'thrills', 'still', 'keep', 'where', 'characters', 'would', 'just', 'so', 'audience', 'can', 'pick', 'choose', 'favorites', 'scary', 'moments', 'are', 'really', 'scary', 'when', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'gore', 'movie', 'more', 'scary', 'gory', 'ending', 'was', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'generally', 'are', '1-2', 'survivors', 'American', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'stopping', 'force', 'therefore', 'generally', 'survivors', 'Other', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'only', 'reason', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'details', 'movie', 'basically', '8-12', 'scary', 'moments', 'good', 'movie', 'left', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'watching', 'crave', 'more', 'Just', 'quick', 'summary', 'what', 'said', 'Originals', '=', 'Good', 'Remakes', '=', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'details', 'be', 'perfectly', 'scary', 'still', 'pretty', 'scary', 'when', 'looking', 'whole', 'thing', 'too', 'typical', 'movie', 'ending', 'survivors', 'only', 'extent', 'do', 'survive', 'give', '5/5', 'stars', 'too', 'good', '3/5', 'stars']",The Grudge 3
1225744,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001P3SA9Y,David J. Brown,"[3, 6]","I'll admit, I liked the first American Grudge film.  It was creepy.  Once the director's cut was released the intensity of the Japanese counterparts was put back in place and we were give a decent little fright film.  The sequel, while I didn't hate it as much as everyone else, wasn't very good.  I really enjoyed the way the story was structured, which basically meant that the viewer didn't fully get was going on until the final moments.  I just thought the basic language of scares was played out and less effective with a few minor ones here and there.  Now we have The Grudge 3.  The first Grudge film not to have the original's creator in the director's chair...and it shows.This film has the same problems as the second one in that the scare tactics are all used up and it's not particularly frightening anymore.  Though, there is one area, Marina Sirtis' death, that has a very creative arrival of the evil spirit through a painting.The acting goes back and forth.  Some is very capable, and some is awful.  The actor playing the brother is just too timid and not very good.  The sisters young and old are both very believable.  There's one no-name actor who plays the apartment complex owner and he is the pits.  He sucks the air out of the two very brief scenes he has.  It's laughable.  Current reigning scream queen Shawnee Smith shows up briefly and does a decent job, which is good considering she has so little to work with.  I mentioned Marina Sirtis, and her role in this film could be better classified as an odd cameo.  She looks weather beaten and more croney then I recall her looking back in 2002's Star Trek: Nemesis.The plot picks up directly after The Grudge 2, takes place in the same Chicago apartment complex, so we lose any prospects of new or interesting locations.  Already in boring sequel town.  The film is done in sequence unlike the previous and this shows the Grudge films for what they are: derivative ghost stories that are as predictable as they are cliche'd.  The lighting is too bright as well.  There's no mood, at least not a scary mood.  It's lit like a Lifetime movie.There's some decent twists in the third act that expand the mythos, but they're written fairly ham-fisted and certainly rushed.  The script and the cinematography are the main offenders in this sequel.  It's well made and most of the actors do good jobs, if nothing exceptional.  Our lead actress does garner our care and sympathy.  The director is the same man behind the far superior and totally neglected monster movie Splinter.  I suggest buying or renting that one first, before Hollywood totally steers the man in the wrong direction and we forget why he was given more job offers to begin with.A decent rental.",3,Too many mediocre horror sequels are going to create a grudge.,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,2733,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'liked', 'first', 'American', 'Grudge', 'film', 'was', 'creepy', 'director', 'cut', 'was', 'released', 'intensity', 'Japanese', 'counterparts', 'was', 'put', 'back', 'place', 'were', 'give', 'decent', 'little', 'fright', 'film', 'sequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'structured', 'basically', 'meant', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'get', 'was', 'going', 'final', 'moments', 'just', 'thought', 'basic', 'language', 'scares', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'less', 'effective', 'few', 'minor', 'ones', 'here', 'there', 'Now', 'have', 'Grudge', '3', 'first', 'Grudge', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'original', 'creator', 'director', 'chair', 'shows.This', 'film', 'same', 'problems', 'second', 'one', 'scare', 'tactics', 'are', 'used', 'up', 'not', 'particularly', 'frightening', 'anymore', 'Though', 'one', 'area', 'Marina', 'Sirtis', 'death', 'very', 'creative', 'arrival', 'evil', 'spirit', 'painting.The', 'acting', 'back', 'forth', 'very', 'capable', 'awful', 'actor', 'playing', 'brother', 'just', 'too', 'timid', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'sisters', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'one', 'no-name', 'actor', 'who', 'apartment', 'complex', 'owner', 'pits', 'air', 'two', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'laughable', 'Current', 'reigning', 'scream', 'queen', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'up', 'briefly', 'decent', 'job', 'good', 'considering', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'mentioned', 'Marina', 'Sirtis', 'role', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'classified', 'odd', 'cameo', 'beaten', 'more', 'croney', 'then', 'recall', 'looking', 'back', '2002', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Nemesis.The', 'plot', 'up', 'directly', 'Grudge', '2', 'place', 'same', 'Chicago', 'apartment', 'complex', 'lose', 'prospects', 'new', 'interesting', 'locations', 'Already', 'boring', 'sequel', 'town', 'film', 'done', 'sequence', 'previous', 'Grudge', 'films', 'what', 'are', 'derivative', 'ghost', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'predictable', 'are', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'lighting', 'too', 'bright', 'as', 'well', 'mood', 'least', 'not', 'scary', 'mood', 'lit', 'Lifetime', 'movie.There', 'decent', 'twists', 'third', 'act', 'mythos', ""'re"", 'written', 'fairly', 'ham-fisted', 'certainly', 'rushed', 'script', 'cinematography', 'are', 'main', 'offenders', 'sequel', 'well', 'made', 'most', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'lead', 'actress', 'garner', 'care', 'sympathy', 'director', 'same', 'man', 'far', 'superior', 'totally', 'neglected', 'monster', 'movie', 'Splinter', 'suggest', 'buying', 'renting', 'one', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'totally', 'man', 'wrong', 'direction', 'forget', 'why', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'job', 'offers', 'begin', 'with.A', 'decent', 'rental']",The Grudge 3

It's obvious right away that things have changed since Grduge 2.  New director and writer means new look, and a whole new storytelling approach.  The first act somewhat confused and bored me with all the character development and lack of scares.  Rather than keep the viewer off balance, like the first Grudge did, the approach here is standard three act American movie making, complete with an obligatory attempt to clearly explain what was going on.  The thing is, at some point during the second act, I began to care for the characters.  The downside for a ghost story is that my biggest fear up to that point in the film was that little Rose would suffer a serious asthma attack, with the ghosts seeming a less serious threat.  Fortunately by the third act, the ghost story kicks in full force and I was enjoying it for what it was:  an American tale of haunting that just happened to have the spirits from The Grudge in it.  As a stand alone work, I liked The Grudge 3 enough to give it 3 1/2 stars, but as a follow-up to Grudge 1 & 2, I found it mismatched and even misleading.

1225749,AQMZ9N7NAIPC,B001P3SA9Y,"E. Selvia ""Liz""","[1, 3]","Admittedly, in my short thirty years, I've seen many terrible movies but this one stands above the rest. With precious little to do with the original franchise or plot, the story mainly details the mundane lives of a family living in and trying to help run the day to day upkeep of an apartment building. it might make a good plot for a rom-com or perhaps a typically forgettable hollywood kids movie. But no. Sadly, this plot is borrowed for a film that was supposed to take place in an entirely different country and seemingly, in total ignorance of any of the original premises which formed the story. In short: this film has almost nothing to do with any of the Grudge (or Ju On as it's originally known) films. This said, a better film to check out for those who enjoyed the first two films would be the original Japanese films Ju On and Ju On 2. You can easily locate both of them on YouTube under these exact search titles or, if you are the sort of person who (like my husband) demands nothing less than surround sound and letterbox featuring, you may be able to find both of these titles for relatively cheap on YesAsia.com (just search under the exact names given) a pretty good place that sells Asian media. In conclusion, for those who have already seen the aforementioned films, yet another film worth seeing that has recently been added to the Ju On franchise is""Ju On: Girl in Black/Old Woman in White"".

The Grudge 3 is a mostly mediocre, occasionally creepy horror film.The story in this film is okay. It's really nothing new or innovative as it uses the same concept, and the same scares as the original; however, this isn't a bad thing for those that aren't tired of it. It's not really a scary film. It lacks the suspense and eeriness to create a truly effective horror film. Most of the jump-scares fall flat, with the exception of two, maybe three; the ghostly imagery isn't haunting or disturbing anymore, it looks like the iconic ghosts have simply been covered in paint or dipped in milk; the croaking sounds and cat sounds are still creepy, but they were rarely used. The film does, however, utilize some vicious gore effects that visual effect fans might enjoy (I did.) The acting was okay- never spectacular, occasionally bad. The ending was also decent.Overall, The Grudge 3 has a few decent moments/scenes, and it stays true to the Grudge formula, which is a plus for hardcore fans; the series has lost some steam, though, and this film doesn't standout nor does it ever truly terrify.

How much farther could they take the story of the vengeful ghosts? Requestion. How much farther could they take the story and make it work? Question's now answered.The answer: Not much farther. The new details in the curse's mythology were interesting, but they were never fully expanded beyond a simple explanation and a simple flashblack. I think there could have been more done there to make it a tad bit more interesting.There were a lot of firsts for this Grudge: the first R-rated, the first not directed by original director Takashi Shimizu, and the first to actually be scene in chronoligical order. Just like with the new mythology bits, the R rating could have been stretched farther. I thought I was simply watching a PG-13 film again. I'm not a fan of gore, but the mind's curiosity would have liked to have seen just what these ghosts could have done with the addition of some gore. Shimizu's tone and pace of the two previous entries was adequately picked up by new director Toby Wilkins, nice job. The chronological order shtick was just something I enjoyed in the previous entries. It not being here really didn't add or take away from the film.I do commend the casting choices. Shawnee Smith? Amazing as always, but a little underused, perhaps? The return of Matthew Knight from The Grudge 2 was a nice addition, and his scene was one of the only to use the R rating, I believe. Johanna Brady as our new lead chick was great, although her reactions were semi-blah. Gil McKinney played the underdog brother takes care of his sisters and holds the family together deal pretty well, and when his character took a turn, the transition was awesome. And I have to give props to Jadie Hobson for being a kid in a horror movie who didn't irk me to death. I actually enjoyed the kid.I pretty much feel on the fence about how much I did like the film. I know that it ranks above The Grudge 2. And extra creep factor? The film's twist at the end was definitely creepy.

A young Japanese woman Naoko, revealed as Kayako's sister, travels to the apartment and Dr. Ann Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) investigates also, after the death of her patient Jake, the sole survivor of the sequel.First of all, if you've seen as many horrible DTV films I have, you'll immediately notice that The Grudge 3 is one of the better ones in terms of production values, actors, quality etc. The trailer for the film makes it look cheap, but the movie looks just as theatrical as the first two. The soundtrack is exactly the same from the first two movies, the apartment looks exactly the same from the sequel, plenty of exterior shots and a solid set of actors. This movie actually looks like it had a budget to work with, unlike recent horrible sequels ""Pulse 2"" and ""Pulse 3"".DTV movies in general, and sequels such as ""Wrong Turn 2"", ""Joy Ride 2"", ""The Grudge 3"" etc. are definitely getting a lot better, and some of them are even better than some of the crap in theaters. If you've seen the first two, you'll also notice this is the most violent Grudge movie yet, with some bloody deaths. Kayako and Toshio have been recast, but it's not necessarily a huge issue since they are just actors in white make-up.The acting is solid from the cast, and it was great to see Shawnee Smith (Saw I, II, III) in another horror movie. Toby Wilkins, who recently directed the very good horror movie ""Splinter"" (2008), does a great job here and is probably one of the reasons why it doesn't feel cheap and tacky. He's a talented director and does a solid job. The script is pretty good, and I loved the introduction of Kayako's sister and the twist of events at the end.

The story beginning shows the young boy who was alive after the ending of the second movie in a asylum secure room as everyone thinks he's unstable and delusional as he continues to spout out about the spirit of Kayako and her plans to kill him.  Well as you might expect they don't believe him and lock him in the room where of course Kayako does kill him very painfully, after that they show you the apartment complex from the second movie where Kayako has apparently cursed as well.  The movie mainly keeps the focus on four people the first is Max(The elder brother who manages the complex and takes care of his two sisters Lisa and Rose and is also struggling to keep the complex afloat since most of the tenants have left), Lisa(The oldest sister who plans on going away and trying a career she's tried for a long time), Rose(The youngest sister who has a medical problem that also adds to her brothers concern both about her health and trying to keep the medical expenses paid), and finally Naoko(The younger sister of Kayako and feels it's up to her to try and end her sisters curse that's harming everyone).  The actors and actresses in the movie were pretty decent and while the effects weren't that many it still did pretty good and left you the feeling of foreboding knowing when a victim of Kayako was about to be offed.  While it doesn't quite reach the fear factor of the first movie it still way surpasses that of the second and that was enough for me.

The first Grudge came at a time when we were still intrigued by this creepy, robotic moving ghost girl which led to a decent film. The second was pretty much the same deal with a little less of a budget, a slightly weaker story, and an appearance of Kumar. Now we are brought to the third and hopefully last installment which lacks just about everything. Obviously the budget was way less since it was a straight to dvd release, the story was the same but with a few boring twists, and our scary ghost girl/brother have really lost their effect.The story picks up kind of where the second one left off. The apartment in Chicago where our asian ghosts have caused havoc is now forcing tenants to flee leaving it close to shutting down. Max is the manager of the complex who lives there with his two younger sisters. As he desperately tries to retain and gain new tenants he winds up becoming possessed by the spirits. As his sisters lives lay in the balance between the spirits and their possessed brother they are told they must do a ceremony to end the spell.Out of the series this by far is the worst of all. It was supremely boring with way too much dialogue. To watch the film you will have to fast forward through roughly 70 % of it or you will be fast asleep in you chair like Santa at work. Even the ghost girl and her brother were way less creepy. The way the girl would crawl around in that bizarre twitching motion has even been cut back. I guess they couldn't afford the camera function that made it appear so scary because this one didn't have it. Even their make-up was more b. It looked like they rolled the actors in some flour and threw them out on set. When this one is returned it will get the Sid patented ""He's gone, the evil's gone from here!""

I thought the plot was a little bit more coherent.  It was less creepy, though, and more gory, which is a criticism of horror films I have about the last 20 years or so of American horror films.Apparently, the grudge has immigrated to the United States, and this movie starts pretty much where the last one ends. Same apartment building, but this time the main characters are the three siblings, the oldest of which, Max, manages the building. Lisa, about 18, and Rose, 8, are his sisters. Kayoko and Toshio are busy killing off the tenants of the building.Enter Dr. Sullivan, who realizes that the last survivor, Jake, who died in her care, was not a crazy little kid, but telling the trusth about a vengeful spirit boy. She visits the building and encounters the grudge.  Too late for her.Enter Naoko, Kayako's sister, who is experiencing a guilt trip, and wants to end the curse by performing a ceremony involving Lisa and Rose. Lisa rebuffs Naoko's offer to help, but now, Max, has taken on the personality of a deranged Takeo, Kayako's husband. Lisa runs to Naoko for help, and agrees to an exorcism ceremony.  However, at the critical moment,Lisa stops the ceremony. Max comes in and eventually kills Naoko. Kayako chases Lisa and Rose goes back to the room to finish the ceremony before Lisa is killed. Max comes to his senses, but now Naoko's spirit carrys on the grudge.The pace is pretty fast. Gil McKinney, who plays Max does a good job of morphing from nice to evil, and I really appreciated his performance. The obligatory replaying of the original murder in a new environment was also a good touch. The vengeful spirit is a theme that for me, you can't go wrong with.Where the movie falls short is the suspension of belief required on top of what is required for a horror film.

1225778,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001P3SA9Y,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","It goes on and on. When you think everything is over, it is not. Three years after ""The Grudge 2"" comes another sequel featuring Kayako and Toshio, Japan's answer to Jason Voorhees (sort of). The new installment is as effective as the last ""Ju-On"" entry, which, sorry, is not saying much.It seems there is no way to stop Kayako the vengeful spirit. That's what Jake (Matthew Knight, reprising his role in ""The Grudge 2"") keeps saying in the opening of the straight-to-DVD sequel ""The Grudge 3."" Dr. Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) doesn't believe him, which, as you know, is a big mistake. Then two ghosts, Kayako and Toshio, start haunting the cursed Chicago building where some residents still remain after the terrible event described in ""The Grudge 2."" In the meanwhile, a young Japanese woman travels to America, believing that she only can stop the curses.The third installment suffers from the predictable storytelling and bland direction. The film just follows the basic template of horror genre faithfully. There is no surprise, no originality in the script. There is no logic behind the random appearances of the pale-faced ghosts Takao and Kayako, but still you can tell when they appear and how the victims get killed. Even the ""twist"" is not really a twist.Though unnecessary and uninspired, ""The Grudge 3"" is not totally bad. There are some nice scares and the photography and production designs are decent. The acting is acceptable. Aiko Horiuchi plays Kayako, replacing Takako Fuji (who did the same role seven times). Maybe Ms Fuji thought it's time to do something different. Aiko Horiuchi is pretty good as the creepy woman with a crackling voice though sometimes her Kayako looks like computer-generated Sadako/Tamara.It is not a total disaster, but obviously it is time to stop.

1225779,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001P3SA9Y,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 4]","Woopak never learns...Being a fan of Takashi Shimizu's ""JU-ON: The Grudge"" and ""JU-ON: The Grudge 2"", but never really liked their American remakes; I still thought I'd check out this 2nd ""Americanized"" sequel since I was bored and curious. Shimizu directed the first two remakes of ""Ju-On"", ""The Grudge 3"" has a different director at the helm in the person of Toby Wilkins (Splinter). Loosely based on ""Ju-On"", the film does adapt the established formulas set by the first two, with a different cast and shot in Bulgaria, released by Sam Raimi's Ghost House pictures. Well, I decided to check this out since the director is the guy who gave us ""Splinter"" which I somewhat liked. So how does ""The Grudge 3"" rate? Well, it is different but also very run-of-the-mill--it is a direct to dvd popcorn snooze.The story takes off after the events of ""The Grudge 2"" as Jake (Matthew Knight) is the sole survivor from those events that took his family. Jake is certain that something bad will happen in the Chicago apartment where he used to live; he tries to warn his doctor (Shawnee Smith) but she never believes his warnings. That is, until Jake is broken into two. Now, Doctor Sullivan decides to look into Jake's unexplained violent death, and goes to his former apartment building. But it seems like strange things have already began to occur as people have started dying. Max (Gil McKinney), the building's super lives with his two sisters; Lisa (Johanna Braddy) and an asthma-stricken Rose (Jadie Hobson) may already be in danger. Naoko (Emi Ikehata) is a young woman from Japan, who may be able to end this curse...but at what price?I liked ""Splinter"" which is the main reason why I gave this ""made for dvd"" movie a look. Wilkins does display competency in generating thrills in that film, and in ""The Grudge 3"", his finest moment would have to be a ""Mister Potato-head"" very creepy approach. Forget crawl spaces that looked spooky, Mr. Potato head is one creepy gimmick. Other than this, the film is pretty routine and I thought Wilkins tried to inject some nice compositions to an otherwise simple screenplay. I guess the best way to approach this film is to look at it from other direct to dvd sequels such as ""Rest Stop 2"" and ""Wrong Turn 2"", which this film is superior. Heck, this film is even better than ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" which saw its release in theaters. Let's make up a phrase; it is so routine, but it is fabulously routine (?).The screenplay by Brad Keene is totally disconnected from the events of ""The Grudge 2"" although it is linked. Jake played by Knight and Doctor Sullivan (Smith) would be expected to be the film's main characters, but the film takes its focus on Max's family. There are some pleasantly creepy moments as we witness the ""Yurei"" (long-haired vengeful ghost) do the familiar scary movements and the sound of a `clicking' and 'vibrating' throat which is an ominous sign of things to come. The timing of the scares are good, although a bit too familiar. It was curious that this time around, the cinematography is brightly lit most of the time, and doesn't have that gloomy dimly lit areas, although the make up effects of our ghosts go from good to pretty darned cheap.I suppose the cast is pretty competent. Johanna Braddy is so charming as the lead actress, and she is quite easy in the eyes. She does show some potential as an actress despite the weaknesses of the script. Now, I don't mean to go overboard, but she is full of character (as your girl next door) that she managed to get some sympathy from me. Her supporting cast is quite decent, I liked Hobson and McKinney was acceptable. Too bad Ikehata was underused, she should've gotten more screen time. I was disappointed that the ceremony wasn't fully fleshed out, I would have enjoyed a little more groundwork.Overall, ""The Grudge 3"" isn't amazing nor would it be worth as anything more than a rental. At least it wasn't as annoying as I feared it would be. There are some freaky images that may interest fans of the franchise, and for the non-veteran horror fan it can be a diversion. The script is boring and very routine, but its energy is pretty pleasant. I suppose mediocrity can be passable when compared to some real BAD movies. Better than ""The Grudge 2"", dare I say?Rent it [2  -Stars]Video/Audio: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The picture is incredibly clean and sharp. The transfer is pretty darned good.
