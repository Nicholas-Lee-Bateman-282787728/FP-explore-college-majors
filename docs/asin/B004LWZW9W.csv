1417000,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004LWZW9W,A kids review,"[7, 11]","After the 2000s yielded the first bad films of Cameron Crowe's career, the writer-director released two films in 2011 that were okay: the rock doc Pearl Jam Twenty and the family drama We Bought a Zoo, which hits store shelves this week. We Bought a Zoo is based on the memoirs of Benjamin Mee, who, after the death of his wife, purchased a struggling zoo and moved his family onto the property in hopes of reopening the facility to the public. With Crowe behind the camera and working decidedly within his wheelhouse of character-driven drama, as well as a cast that included Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, and more, I thought Zoo might find itself in Oscar contention. Unfortunately, while I found the performances noteworthy and the film overall pleasant, I also felt it was too predictable and overly sentimental, with sweet spots that weren't entirely earned. It's not the best we've seen from Cameron Crowe, but it might suffice for anyone looking for a safe, harmless little yarn.",2,We Bought a Zoo,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1009,"['2000s', 'yielded', 'first', 'bad', 'films', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'career', 'writer-director', 'released', 'two', 'films', '2011', 'were', 'okay', 'rock', 'doc', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Twenty', 'family', 'drama', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'store', 'shelves', 'week', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'who', 'death', 'wife', 'purchased', 'struggling', 'zoo', 'moved', 'family', 'property', 'hopes', 'reopening', 'facility', 'public', 'Crowe', 'camera', 'working', 'decidedly', 'wheelhouse', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'included', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'more', 'thought', 'Zoo', 'might', 'find', 'Oscar', 'contention', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'performances', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'overall', 'pleasant', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'sweet', 'spots', 'were', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'earned', 'not', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'might', 'suffice', 'anyone', 'looking', 'safe', 'harmless', 'little', 'yarn']",N/A

1417014,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW9W,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I wasn't sure what to expect here.  I mean, I love Scarlett Johansson, and the reviews all pointed to this being one of her finer performances, but overall this was a PG rated family film starring Matt Damon and I'm not always sold on either of those contributing factors.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with various aspects of this film, but my initial assumptions about the corny, melodramatic manipulation of the genre were proven true as well.The film centers around the true story of Benjamin Mee, a man who recently lost his wife in death.  His kids are obviously wounded, especially his son, and he personally can't seem to let it go.  Everything and everyone and everyplace reminds him of her, and so he goes house hunting and finds a beautiful home adjacent to a fully functional zoo that he buys and must now run, despite knowing nothing about what he is doing.  The staff is skeptical, but Benjamin isn't a quitter and he finds a way to make this the biggest adventure he or his family has ever had.  Along the way, he has to work out some personal issues with his son, but like all family centered dramas, the happy ending is right around the corner.The acting is decent here.  Scarlett Johansson is certainly the standout.  She really calms down her sexuality to create a character who is truly lived in.  You can feel the weight of the job and the concern and the `life' in her eyes, yet she still has that alluring quality so when Damon's character says he's not going to hit on her and she says ""If I wanted you to kiss me you'd have no choice"" you believe her.  The little munchkin that plays his daughter is just too cure for words, and Elle Fanning is delightful as the fidgety twelve year old vying for Damon's grumpy son's attention.The film's rise and fall comes in the script.  It is in parts very witty or at least delivers its comedic flourishes with charm.  Some of the jokes land just right.

The true story of Benjamin Mee has a terrific interview with the subject (though I'm still wondering where the money came from in this whole operation), and the nearly 90-minute documentary ""We Shot a Zoo"" has fantastic interviews with the animal trainers, awesome close ups of all the animals, more of the backstory, and satisfies completely as it's own self-contained documentary. The story always should have just been a documentary - it had enough going for it without being turned into schmaltz. But Crowe's musical tastes and a mostly terrific cast kept it watchable.

He plays the part of a father who has to raise a teenage son and young daughter.  When the son gets expelled from school, they decide to pack their bags and start over in a country house that has one very unusual problem- there's a zoo in the back yard!  Lions, bears, owls, snakes, tigers... they're all there!  Though compared to most zoos the selection is rather small, but who cares.  Oh and of course, when your child gets expelled from school, you probably won't be moving the entire family somewhere else.  You'll be sending the son somewhere else.  Oh well, minor issues!There's a couple things that strike a little close to home.  No, I don't own my own zoo.  Would be nice perhaps, but I ain't stepping foot anywhere close to that grizzly bear!  Even that weak tiger responsible for the more emotional moment near the end is still strong enough to be considered a major threat to me!  The storyline is about maintaining these animals all for the grand opening which happens to be on July 7th... which is my birthday!  Let me tell you something, it's *never* sunny on that day either.  Storyline flaw, haha.  The other similarity is that I lost my mom and it was just me and my father raising me when I was around the age of the teenage son in the film, so it's an interesting and minor coincidence that these two connections are ones I can relate to.I take away one point because the storyline slows down to a crawl about 30 minutes in, and it takes another 30 minutes to break away from it which means overall the movie is slightly overlong.  Also, the romance building between the teenage son and the beautiful blonde-haired girl feels a tad incomplete.  Overall, great movie.  The young daughter is especially smart and hilarious the way she seems very observant, mature for her age, and doesn't hold her feelings inside.  Matt Damon works great as a sentimental father, which is a surprising role for him.  I'm totally not used to seeing him in this kind of role but he was convincingly emotional after a fight he got into with his son that shows he's excellent at portraying a single father with kids.

And by snagging both Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson as his lead actors, Crowe had two big plusses going for him right off the bat. I had reasonable expectations for Zoo, but after seeing the trailer and the PG rating, I wasn't really sure what I was gonna get. In the end, I got a very good, heartfelt and funny, family film. It worked for me despite it's many flaws. For 2 hours, I managed to escape into a world that feels like a modern take on the Disney classic Swiss Family Robinson (1960), which I fell in love with as a kid and still enjoy watching from time to time as an adult.Zoo definitely has its ""problems"" cinematically: it's predictable, contrived, and pretty saccharin sweet in its almost fairytale like qualities. And yet I really love it somehow. There's just something about it's simple story, cute kids and animals, and personal growth ""life lessons"" vibe that when paired with Crowe's great taste in music, Damon's lead acting performance, the supporting cast, and good editing, it comes together and works on a level greater than its parts.

1417042,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004LWZW9W,California Dreaming,"[1, 2]","I just saw another film based upon true-life events -- ""The Impossible"" -- which is similar to this film in the sense that this is also based upon a true story.  ""Impossible"" was about a family from Spain who was on vacation during the 2004 tsunami, while ""Zoo"" is about a guy and his kids in the UK (I believe) who, well, bought a zoo.  And I have given both of these films a 4-star rating.However, I gave ""Impossible"" that rating with some huge caveats.  I wasn't nearly as brutal as Christy Lemire however, who called ""Impossible"" ""heavy handed"" while giving it a ""C rating.""  And I didn't really complain about how the original family in ""Impossible"" was incorrectly portrayed as being from an English-speaking country, or how the people who lived in the area of the tsunami were almost completely ignored over the rich vacationers like A.O. Scott.  (I am paraphrasing them a bit.  Do a web search and you can find their full reviews.)But I read a review on this site where an Amazon customer seemed to imply that ""accuracy in film is overrated.""  That one caught my eye.  Now, I believe that this opinion is completely wrong because it dumps all movies into the same bucket.  To me there are huge differences in genre.  For example, ""The Impossible"" is a disaster film -- perhaps even a documdrama to some extent -- about true-life events where a quarter of a million people were actually killed;"" while ""Zoo"" is a dramatic comedy -- or ""dramedy"" as I believe it is called -- which is surely lighter fare.  Without giving too much away, the mom died in ""Zoo"" (I don't know if this was an actual event) but Act One\Scene One occurs quite a while after that.So to me, there's the rub with saying that ""accuracy in film is overrated.""  I'm sure that many liberties were taken with ""Zoo,"" one of them was location, of course.  (And while watching the film, I wasn't convinced that the new zoo owner actually stood up against a half-ton grizzly.)  But those liberties didn't bother me since this is a comedy, a ""family-friendly"" film.  You surely couldn't call ""Impossible"" family-friendly.  After all, it was a true-life devastating event.  But also, there is partial nudity with Naomi Watts in that other film.  So I believe that the director of ""Impossible"" was off-base a bit with some of those liberties, while the director of ""Zoo"" was not.Well, I liked both films, but I have to admit that I actually liked this one just a little bit more.  Sure, they both took liberties with their ""true"" stories.  But ""Zoo"" can be forgiven for those liberties, while I'm not quite convinced the same holds for ""The Impossible.""",4,I Bought it Too!,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,2620,"['just', 'saw', 'film', 'based', 'true-life', 'events', 'Impossible', 'similar', 'film', 'sense', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Impossible', 'was', 'family', 'Spain', 'who', 'was', 'vacation', '2004', 'tsunami', 'Zoo', 'guy', 'kids', 'UK', 'believe', 'who', 'well', 'bought', 'zoo', 'have', 'given', 'films', '4-star', 'rating.However', 'gave', 'Impossible', 'rating', 'huge', 'caveats', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'brutal', 'Christy', 'Lemire', 'however', 'who', 'called', 'Impossible', 'heavy', 'handed', 'giving', 'C', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'how', 'original', 'family', 'Impossible', 'was', 'incorrectly', 'portrayed', 'being', 'English-speaking', 'country', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'area', 'tsunami', 'were', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignored', 'rich', 'vacationers', 'A.O', 'Scott', 'am', 'paraphrasing', 'bit', 'Do', 'web', 'search', 'can', 'find', 'full', 'reviews', 'read', 'review', 'site', 'where', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'seemed', 'imply', 'accuracy', 'film', 'overrated', 'one', 'caught', 'eye', 'Now', 'believe', 'opinion', 'completely', 'wrong', 'movies', 'same', 'bucket', 'are', 'huge', 'differences', 'genre', 'example', 'Impossible', 'disaster', 'film', 'perhaps', 'even', 'documdrama', 'extent', 'true-life', 'events', 'where', 'quarter', 'million', 'people', 'were', 'actually', 'killed', 'Zoo', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'dramedy', 'believe', 'called', 'surely', 'lighter', 'fare', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'mom', 'died', 'Zoo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'actual', 'event', 'Act', 'One\\Scene', 'One', 'quite', 'while', 'that.So', 'rub', 'saying', 'accuracy', 'film', 'overrated', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'Zoo', 'one', 'was', 'location', 'course', 'watching', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'new', 'zoo', 'owner', 'actually', 'stood', 'up', 'half-ton', 'grizzly', 'liberties', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'comedy', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'surely', 'could', ""n't"", 'call', 'Impossible', 'family-friendly', 'was', 'true-life', 'devastating', 'event', 'also', 'partial', 'nudity', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'other', 'film', 'believe', 'director', 'Impossible', 'was', 'off-base', 'bit', 'liberties', 'director', 'Zoo', 'was', 'not.Well', 'liked', 'films', 'have', 'admit', 'actually', 'liked', 'one', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Sure', 'took', 'liberties', 'true', 'stories', 'Zoo', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'liberties', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'convinced', 'same', 'Impossible']",N/A

1417056,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B004LWZW9W,CriticNic,"[0, 1]","I went into We Bought a Zoo expecting a fun, feel-good family comedy. That's exactly what I got with the film starring Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee, a man who moves with his two children to a house that happens to be attached to a zoo. The film is based on a true story of the real Benjamin Mee, though the film contains many differences from the real story.The film's version of Benjamin is a widower with two children. Not sure what to do after the passing of his wife, dealing with his son getting into trouble, and always seeking an adventure, Benjamin decides to relocate the family and start anew. A house hunting montage soon rolls by which ends with Benjamin and daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) stumbling upon a closed zoo and of course we assume what happens next judging from the film's title. I can't really imagine one day just saying ""hey, why not buy a zoo?!""Benjamin appears to handle the whole situation with a worry-free attitude, but really behind his happy-go-lucky facade hides a hurt man hiding his sadness through the thrill of adventure and risk. Though the zoo was meant to be a means for Benjamin to start fresh with the family, it winds up creating financial and familial distress. Being a family-oriented drama, the film is relatively tame when it comes to the more dramatic moments. The film puts more effort into the laughs, tear-jerking moments, and the cuteness factor.The movie does do a great job in the aforementioned areas though. There is some nice comic relief specifically from Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's brother Duncan, and John Michael Higgins as the absurdly silly an unrealistic albeit hilarious zoo inspector. There are some fun scenes involving the animals as well, including one with Bejnamin and an escaped bear. I'm not sure if it was CGI, animatronics, or something else but that scene was pulled off very impressively and was one of the more profound moments in the film.I also really enjoyed the cast. Matt Damon is always superb, whether kicking butt as a rogue CIA operative or an adventure-seeking widower, he always brings credibility to his roles. All of the zoo employees were great as well, though I was let down that Patrick Fugit didn't have a bigger role (he really needs more mainstream roles). I also have to mention that Elle Fanning is starting to shine and no longer should she just be known as Dakota's sister - with Super 8 and now this, she's only getting better. Though the script was a little bit cheese in some areas, the great cast makes up for it.While I realize the intended audience and that this is meant to be a nice feel-good family film, I felt there was a lot of room for more realistic life lessons which here were a bit sacrificed for audience approval. Downplayed family drama, a few moments with drippy dialog, and a not-so-credible love angle between Benjamin and zoo attendant Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) (I just think it didn't make much sense as the characters didn't seem to have a bond other than them both being lonely) gave it a little too much predictability and Hollywood conveniences. Nonetheless, We Bought a Zoo is still a fun and well crafted film that the family can enjoy a have a good time with.Source: criticnic.com 13-April-2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",3,"Fun family adventure, but sticks to the formula",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3284,"['went', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'expecting', 'fun', 'feel-good', 'family', 'comedy', 'exactly', 'what', 'got', 'film', 'starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'man', 'who', 'two', 'children', 'house', 'be', 'attached', 'zoo', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'film', 'many', 'differences', 'real', 'story.The', 'film', 'version', 'Benjamin', 'widower', 'two', 'children', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'passing', 'wife', 'dealing', 'son', 'getting', 'trouble', 'always', 'seeking', 'adventure', 'Benjamin', 'relocate', 'family', 'start', 'anew', 'house', 'hunting', 'montage', 'soon', 'rolls', 'Benjamin', 'daughter', 'Rosie', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'stumbling', 'closed', 'zoo', 'course', 'assume', 'what', 'next', 'judging', 'film', 'title', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'imagine', 'one', 'day', 'just', 'saying', 'hey', 'why', 'not', 'buy', 'zoo', 'Benjamin', 'handle', 'whole', 'situation', 'worry-free', 'attitude', 'really', 'happy-go-lucky', 'facade', 'hurt', 'man', 'hiding', 'sadness', 'thrill', 'adventure', 'risk', 'zoo', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'means', 'Benjamin', 'start', 'fresh', 'family', 'up', 'creating', 'financial', 'familial', 'distress', 'Being', 'family-oriented', 'drama', 'film', 'relatively', 'tame', 'when', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'film', 'more', 'effort', 'laughs', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'cuteness', 'factor.The', 'movie', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'aforementioned', 'areas', 'nice', 'comic', 'relief', 'specifically', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Benjamin', 'brother', 'Duncan', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'absurdly', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'albeit', 'hilarious', 'zoo', 'inspector', 'are', 'fun', 'scenes', 'involving', 'animals', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'one', 'Bejnamin', 'escaped', 'bear', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'CGI', 'animatronics', 'something', 'else', 'scene', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'impressively', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'profound', 'moments', 'film.I', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'always', 'superb', 'kicking', 'butt', 'rogue', 'CIA', 'operative', 'adventure-seeking', 'widower', 'always', 'credibility', 'roles', 'zoo', 'employees', 'were', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bigger', 'role', 'really', 'more', 'mainstream', 'roles', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'starting', 'shine', 'longer', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'known', 'Dakota', 'sister', 'Super', '8', 'now', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'script', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'cheese', 'areas', 'great', 'cast', 'up', 'it.While', 'realize', 'intended', 'audience', 'meant', 'be', 'nice', 'feel-good', 'family', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'room', 'more', 'realistic', 'life', 'lessons', 'here', 'were', 'bit', 'sacrificed', 'audience', 'approval', 'Downplayed', 'family', 'drama', 'few', 'moments', 'drippy', 'dialog', 'not-so-credible', 'love', 'angle', 'Benjamin', 'zoo', 'attendant', 'Kelly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'just', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'bond', 'other', 'being', 'lonely', 'gave', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'predictability', 'Hollywood', 'conveniences', 'Nonetheless', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'still', 'fun', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'with.Source', 'criticnic.com', '13-April-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",N/A

Twiddle,"[0, 0]","This is a pleasant, gentle, family friendly film (based on a true life story) that like so many other modern movies runs just a little longer than it should. It's got several false climaxes that push it over the two hour mark and would have played better at about 100 minutes in my opinion. That being said it's still a very good movie that children and adults of all ages will enjoy I think. It's an old fashioned film with no sex, violence or gross out humor, only a few minor vulgarities most likely inserted to make it a PG rather than G rated film.  Except for children's animation G rated films are considered box office poison nowadays, just too squeaky clean for teenagers you understand.

Zalewski ""Get it, try it, write about it.""","[0, 0]","Why You Must See This!I looked forward to watching this because it looked good - it had a good cast, animals, and some silliness to it. I mean, who buys a zoo? Well, apparently Benjamin Mee. In real life. After watching I wasn't surprised it was based on a true story. With an element of you can't make this stuff up mixed with honest emotional turmoil that the audience can identify with, it pulls at your heart strings and draws you in.At the start you learn that Benjamin was a journalist that went all over the world, even interviewing threatening dictators. He abruptly switches to one of the most difficult jobs of all - a single dad. We learn that his wife passed away several months before but without a lot of detail. We assumed it was cancer that took her. One thing is very clear, the family is hurting in their grief and they do not have it all pulled together. They all attempt to cope with their loss in very different ways, but it is clear that Benjamin and his oldest child, Dylan, are struggling the most. I was surprised at how well his daughter was handling everything, though it seemed she had an easier time communicating her feelings to her father.I was disappointed in Dylan's school as it appeared they did little to try and help him deal with his feelings. His emotions were coming out in his artwork and said loud and clear that he was full of hurt. He acted out in other ways too, such as stealing, which ends up getting him expelled from school. This coupled with Benjamin's difficulty with going anywhere that reminded him of Lily, his dead wife, pushed him to look for a new place to live.And that some place turned out to be a zoo. Some of the logistics of how and why escaped me, but it was a new start for their family. The little girl loved it, the older boy hated it. Benjamin was convinced they needed this and tried to make it work so they could reopen the zoo in July.There were a lot of things that happened along that path that challenged the family emotionally and financially. One issue being what to do about an elder tiger that refused to take his medicine. He showed signs of suffering and the staff urged Benjamin to give the vet the okay to put him out of his misery. Benjamin struggled with this believing the tiger would get better. I felt he was connecting the tiger to his wife and this made it hard to let go.As they prepared for inspection to see if they could reopen, Benjanin learned that he can't run from his feelings. He still missed his wife and his children still missed their mother. But, they could still move on in their lives.  I really enjoyed this film. I felt drawn in and rode the emotional roller coaster along with them. I literally had to fight myself not to cry several times. Only distractions from the movie helped!Since we received a promotional review copy and not the fully released DVD, I'm not sure if the extra features will all be the same. But, I really enjoyed the bonus feature about the animal trainers. It was fascinating to learn about how they work with the animals in movies and the thought that goes into actions they have them perform. For example, having the bear twist his head gives him character as he is staring down at Benjamin.  I also learned that most retired trained animals end up living the rest of their days with their trainers.I honestly loved this movie! It was authentic and honest in its portrayal of the modern family dealing with intense grief... even if we all can't buy a zoo to help us escape.",5,A Must-See - So Crazy It Has to Be True,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3507,"['Why', 'Must', 'See', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'looked', 'good', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'animals', 'silliness', 'mean', 'who', 'zoo', 'Well', 'apparently', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'real', 'life', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'element', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'mixed', 'honest', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'heart', 'strings', 'draws', 'in.At', 'start', 'learn', 'Benjamin', 'was', 'journalist', 'went', 'world', 'even', 'interviewing', 'threatening', 'dictators', 'abruptly', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'jobs', 'single', 'dad', 'learn', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'several', 'months', 'lot', 'detail', 'assumed', 'was', 'cancer', 'took', 'One', 'thing', 'very', 'clear', 'family', 'hurting', 'grief', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'pulled', 'together', 'attempt', 'cope', 'loss', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'clear', 'Benjamin', 'oldest', 'child', 'Dylan', 'are', 'struggling', 'most', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'daughter', 'was', 'handling', 'everything', 'seemed', 'had', 'easier', 'time', 'communicating', 'feelings', 'father.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Dylan', 'school', 'appeared', 'did', 'little', 'try', 'help', 'deal', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'artwork', 'said', 'loud', 'clear', 'was', 'full', 'hurt', 'acted', 'out', 'other', 'ways', 'too', 'such', 'stealing', 'up', 'getting', 'expelled', 'school', 'coupled', 'Benjamin', 'difficulty', 'going', 'anywhere', 'reminded', 'Lily', 'dead', 'wife', 'pushed', 'look', 'new', 'place', 'live.And', 'place', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'zoo', 'logistics', 'how', 'why', 'escaped', 'was', 'new', 'start', 'family', 'little', 'girl', 'loved', 'older', 'boy', 'hated', 'Benjamin', 'was', 'convinced', 'needed', 'tried', 'make', 'work', 'so', 'could', 'reopen', 'zoo', 'July.There', 'were', 'lot', 'things', 'happened', 'path', 'challenged', 'family', 'emotionally', 'financially', 'One', 'issue', 'being', 'what', 'do', 'elder', 'tiger', 'refused', 'take', 'medicine', 'showed', 'signs', 'suffering', 'staff', 'urged', 'Benjamin', 'give', 'vet', 'okay', 'put', 'misery', 'Benjamin', 'struggled', 'believing', 'tiger', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'felt', 'was', 'connecting', 'tiger', 'wife', 'made', 'hard', 'let', 'go.As', 'prepared', 'inspection', 'see', 'could', 'reopen', 'Benjanin', 'learned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'feelings', 'still', 'missed', 'wife', 'children', 'still', 'missed', 'mother', 'could', 'still', 'move', 'lives', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'felt', 'drawn', 'rode', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'literally', 'had', 'fight', 'not', 'cry', 'several', 'times', 'Only', 'distractions', 'movie', 'helped', 'received', 'promotional', 'review', 'copy', 'not', 'fully', 'released', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'extra', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'bonus', 'feature', 'animal', 'trainers', 'was', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'how', 'work', 'animals', 'movies', 'thought', 'actions', 'have', 'perform', 'example', 'having', 'bear', 'twist', 'head', 'character', 'staring', 'down', 'Benjamin', 'also', 'learned', 'most', 'retired', 'trained', 'animals', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'rest', 'days', 'trainers.I', 'honestly', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'authentic', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'modern', 'family', 'dealing', 'intense', 'grief', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'zoo', 'help', 'escape']",N/A

1417087,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LWZW9W,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","WE BOUGHT A ZOO (Dir. Cameron Crowe, 2011, 125 minutes) is a really delightful family-oriented comedy based on the true story of (and bookWe Bought a Zoo: The Amazing True Story of a Young Family, a Broken Down Zoo, and the 200 Wild Animals That Change Their Lives Foreverby) Benjamin Mee, who owns and operates the Dartmoor Zoo in England. Incidentally, the real Benjamin Mee is completely bald but otherwise resembles Billy Crystal.In this iteration, set in 2010 or 2011 California, widower Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) and his two wonderful kids Rosie (a charming angel named Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and Dylan (a handsome 15-year-old heartbreaker named Colin Ford, who actually resembles Damon) head for a fresh start, larger home. Somehow, they end up falling for a house that is weirdly enough situated right in an abandoned yet still populated zoo. Benjamin (his father was ""Ben"", not him) naturally leaps for it when he sees how delighted Rosie is.Of course the zoo is also populated by a rogue cast of skeleton-crew zookeepers (the stunningly beautiful Scarlett Johanssen, a welcome turn by my old perennial favorite Angus MacFadyen, the very beautiful Elle Fanning who's growing fast, and a few others whose names I'm having trouble tracking). Somehow the state deems that the owner of the home is also the owner of the entire zoo - apparently the land and the zoo on it are one package with the house. They buy it and commence to getting it off the ground.Damon is getting skilled, improving with age - he stunned me pleasantly inHereafter(and I wasn't unimpressed by the BOURNE movies either) - here he once again fits and actually acts. His deep attachment to his daughter and his steady ignoring of his son create the tension the family film needs. Healing always seems to be the message with such films, but this movie avoids the maudlin and the weepy. One thing that delighted me to learn is that the Mee Family (the real Benjamin, his son and daughter) have a walk-on part in the film: they are the first in line to enter the zoo.A truly stunning turn is Scarlett Johansson's contribution here; this is a person anybody would just want to scoop up and take home in a bundle. She is truly one of the most heavenly creatures on earth. It is a pity she has what I call ""one-liner scenes"", as if a series of cameos. Hollyweird tends to do that to Johanssen and I do not know why. It certainly drained the film of a better, warmer feel to it. Perhaps it is the British origin of the film (I can't see why) but it seemed cold and a bit stiff to me. As much as I champion this quality from film ... I just can't seem to put my finger on the problem. Yet I sense there is a problem here.Let me address what may be bothering me: about 45 minutes from my home is what I call ""the family zoo"". I'd been going there since I was a child, and Mee's Rosemoor Zoo reminded me of my zoo. The thing is, employees and even the owners had their homes near but not on the zoo grounds.In this film, the home seems to be smack in the center of the place. They hear a lion roaring right next to the windows when they first look inside the house! That just strikes me as wrong. Of course the whiny and often silly soundtrack with whining college music did not help. I HATE that and wish for a blessed, golden silence in such movies when characters are not talking.Lest I forget major honorable mention for an adult role: Thomas Hayden Church (a Scott Glenn lookalike if ever there was one) plays Benjamin's eccentric older brother Duncan. Church gleefully doles out his typical slouchy southern-California-tinged humor and hilarious emotive expressions with skill. This is his second time playing an eccentric older brother onscreen; his first was in 2008'sSmart Peopleas Dennis Quaid's hapless sibling.Another real charmer in this is the goofy realtor Mr. Stevens (J. B. Smoove of TV fame). I don't have time to look up this actor about whom I know nothing - I can only say his turn here is star-making. He reminded me of the comic geniuses of the 1930s and 1940s. Smoove in a lot more film in future, that's what I want to see. He is hilarious and natural in front of a camera. No one can ask more of an actor.Regardless of my weird cinematic moods or sensibilities, I know you'll love this humorous, laid-back family film as much I truly did. If only more films like this were being made, America might find itself again - and it only takes 20 seconds of courage to do anything.",5,"Mee, Mee, Mee ... and a zoo",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,4469,"['WE', 'BOUGHT', 'ZOO', 'Dir', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', '2011', '125', 'minutes', 'really', 'delightful', 'family-oriented', 'comedy', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bookWe', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'Amazing', 'True', 'Story', 'Young', 'Family', 'Broken', 'Down', 'Zoo', '200', 'Wild', 'Animals', 'Change', 'Their', 'Foreverby', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'who', 'Dartmoor', 'Zoo', 'England', 'Incidentally', 'real', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'completely', 'bald', 'otherwise', 'resembles', 'Billy', 'Crystal.In', 'iteration', 'set', '2010', '2011', 'California', 'widower', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'two', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'Rosie', 'charming', 'angel', 'named', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'Dylan', 'handsome', '15-year-old', 'heartbreaker', 'named', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'who', 'actually', 'Damon', 'head', 'fresh', 'start', 'larger', 'home', 'Somehow', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'house', 'weirdly', 'enough', 'situated', 'right', 'abandoned', 'yet', 'still', 'populated', 'zoo', 'Benjamin', 'father', 'was', 'Ben', 'not', 'naturally', 'when', 'how', 'delighted', 'Rosie', 'is.Of', 'course', 'zoo', 'also', 'populated', 'rogue', 'cast', 'skeleton-crew', 'zookeepers', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'welcome', 'turn', 'old', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'Angus', 'MacFadyen', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'who', 'growing', 'fast', 'few', 'others', 'names', ""'m"", 'having', 'trouble', 'tracking', 'Somehow', 'state', 'owner', 'home', 'also', 'owner', 'entire', 'zoo', 'apparently', 'land', 'zoo', 'are', 'one', 'package', 'house', 'buy', 'commence', 'getting', 'off', 'ground.Damon', 'getting', 'skilled', 'improving', 'age', 'stunned', 'pleasantly', 'inHereafter', 'was', ""n't"", 'unimpressed', 'BOURNE', 'movies', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'fits', 'actually', 'acts', 'deep', 'attachment', 'daughter', 'steady', 'ignoring', 'son', 'create', 'tension', 'family', 'film', 'needs', 'Healing', 'always', 'be', 'message', 'such', 'films', 'movie', 'maudlin', 'weepy', 'One', 'thing', 'delighted', 'learn', 'Mee', 'Family', 'real', 'Benjamin', 'son', 'daughter', 'have', 'walk-on', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'line', 'enter', 'zoo.A', 'truly', 'stunning', 'turn', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'contribution', 'here', 'person', 'anybody', 'would', 'just', 'want', 'scoop', 'up', 'take', 'home', 'bundle', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'heavenly', 'creatures', 'earth', 'pity', 'what', 'call', 'one-liner', 'scenes', 'series', 'cameos', 'Hollyweird', 'do', 'Johanssen', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'certainly', 'drained', 'film', 'better', 'warmer', 'feel', 'Perhaps', 'British', 'origin', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'seemed', 'cold', 'bit', 'stiff', 'As', 'much', 'champion', 'quality', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'finger', 'problem', 'sense', 'problem', 'here.Let', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'bothering', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'home', 'what', 'call', 'family', 'zoo', ""'d"", 'been', 'going', 'there', 'was', 'child', 'Mee', 'Rosemoor', 'Zoo', 'reminded', 'zoo', 'thing', 'employees', 'even', 'owners', 'had', 'homes', 'not', 'zoo', 'grounds.In', 'film', 'home', 'be', 'smack', 'center', 'place', 'hear', 'lion', 'roaring', 'right', 'next', 'windows', 'when', 'first', 'look', 'house', 'just', 'strikes', 'wrong', 'course', 'whiny', 'often', 'silly', 'soundtrack', 'whining', 'college', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'HATE', 'wish', 'blessed', 'golden', 'silence', 'such', 'movies', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'forget', 'major', 'honorable', 'mention', 'adult', 'role', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'lookalike', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Benjamin', 'eccentric', 'older', 'brother', 'Duncan', 'Church', 'gleefully', 'out', 'typical', 'slouchy', 'southern-California-tinged', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'emotive', 'expressions', 'skill', 'second', 'time', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'older', 'brother', 'onscreen', 'first', 'was', ""2008'sSmart"", 'Peopleas', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'hapless', 'sibling.Another', 'real', 'charmer', 'goofy', 'realtor', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'J', 'B.', 'Smoove', 'TV', 'fame', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'look', 'up', 'actor', 'whom', 'know', 'nothing', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'turn', 'here', 'star-making', 'reminded', 'comic', 'geniuses', '1930s', '1940s', 'Smoove', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'future', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'hilarious', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'one', 'can', 'ask', 'more', 'actor.Regardless', 'weird', 'cinematic', 'moods', 'sensibilities', 'know', ""'ll"", 'love', 'humorous', 'laid-back', 'family', 'film', 'much', 'truly', 'did', 'only', 'more', 'films', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'America', 'might', 'find', 'again', 'only', '20', 'seconds', 'courage', 'do', 'anything']",N/A

I think I was expecting her death to be distant background, and I thought the movie would be about BUYING A ZOO!!!  Instead, every aspect of buying the zoo and getting it started was totally saturated with grief--the man is grieving the loss of his wife, and the teenage boy is grieving the loss of his mother, and the cute little girl misses her mommy.So, instead of being upbeat and fun, I felt like the movie was kind of a downer.  I was excited about the adventure aspect of buying the zoo, but it wasn't an adventure movie, it was a grieving movie.  Not what I expected or hoped for.Aside from that, the movie was fine.

Not surprisingly, their efforts to save the animals of the zoo assist them in working through their grief and bring them closer together.There are no big surprises here (maybe because this is really how things played out in real life), but stories of hard work and passion creating family unity are pretty timeless.And, apparently, there is something for everyone.

Yes it gets a bit sappy at times, but so doe life. But in the end if you let yourself go with the flow of this true story based on Benjamin Mee's memoir you will end up feeling the pleasure of hugs again. Aline Brosh McKenna joined director Cameron Crowe in adapting the book as a screenplay and it works.Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has recently lost his wife to cancer. Always a lover of adventure as in the journalistic form, he sees the newspaper world crumbling and his life of grieving overbearing and in a bid to start his life over, and against the advice of his older brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) he follows a new realtor (J.B. Smoove) with his young daughter Rosie (an absolutely captivating Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and purchases a large house that has a zoo. Benjamin and Rosie are delighted, but his young frustrated and failing student son Dylan (Colin Ford) is not happy about it. The zoo is need of renovation and Benjamin sets about the work with the head keeper, Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), and the rest of the zoo staff - MacCready (Angus MacFadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), Lily (Elle Fanning). But, the zoo soon runs into financial trouble. The staff must get the zoo back to it's former glory, pass a zoo inspection, and get it back open to the public.In addition to the challenges of the new adventure of owning a zoo, Benjamin must face the reality that his deceased wife is to remain only a sweet memory, must deal with Dylan's anti-social behavior and budding awakening to girls in Lily, must deal with the nauseating inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins), and gradually become at one with his zoo animals and that responsibility as well as his attraction to Kelly who gives him advice on how to relate to his sullen son Dylan (""The secret to talking is listening').  How it all works out is expected but endearing.This is a strong cast, well directed, and continues Cameron Crowe's tendency to pluck at the heartstrings. Now is that so bad? Don't think so.

When they're most likely to forgive one's abundance of sentimentality? WE BOUGHT A ZOO utilizes savvy product placement by coinciding its box office release with the month of December. Not that it mattered to me one bit when this film would've come out. Me, I'm a sucker for the sentimental stuff. The movie's title doesn't lie; you get the gist of the premise. Here's Cameron Crowe again, manipulating your emotions, coaxing a laugh, making you tear up. He's such a user.It's based on a true story. Matt Damon, one of my favorite actors, plays journalist Benjamin Mee who nurses an adventurous streak. He has interviewed dangerous underworld figures in third world nations. He has flown into Category 4 storms. Benjamin profoundly believes that 20 seconds of insane courage can only alter your life for the better. But how much insane courage can one muster when the love of your life leaves you?Benjamin Mee can't stand pity, even pity assignments at work. Six months after his wife's passing, Benjamin quits his career and - when a neighbor's party causes his seven-year-old girl Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) to remark: ""Their happy's too loud."" - he uproots the fam. Seeking a new residence, he and Rosie stumble upon what looks to be the ideal home in the country, even if it's nine miles from a Target store or pretty much from any other store. Except that a broken-down zoo is attached to the house. Buy one, buy the other. Benjamin Mee has always strived to give his kids an ""authentic American experience,"" but his bump of common sense is interfering here. Ultimately, it's little Rosie's unbounded joy at the thought of having a zoo that decides things. Benjamin's cautious accountant brother (Thomas Haden Church) is pretty much aghast.WE BOUGHT A ZOO isn't as incisive or emotionally searing as THE DESCENDANTS, a similar picture dealing with a family's grief. WE BOUGHT A ZOO, to be frank, won't be nominated for as many awards as THE DESCENDANTS will. Except that I like this movie better. Sue me for prefering clear-cut happy endings. While Clooney's dramedy tends to cut too close to home and no one in WE BOUGHT A ZOO comes close to Shailene Woodley's fierce performance, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast guide you to more familiar territory. Their story has a warmth and an undeniable sweetness to it, brought about in huge part by the actors but also by Crowe's knack for heartstring tugging. And, of course, the zoo animals.Benjamin Mee has his work cut out for him. The Rosemoor Wildlife Park has been dead in the water for the past two years, and just how strongly does he want to commit to operating a zoo, let alone resurrecting it to specs? The dreaded inspection is fast approaching. His idiosyncratic new employees - including the gorgeous zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) - are casting dubious eyes at him. Benjamin's troubled teen son, Dylan, hates the place, hates everything, really. He keeps on drawing those disturbing images. Benjamin and Dylan just can't seem to connect.I admit that I choked up in places (damn you, Cameron Crowe!). Yes, this is a sappy film, and some bits feel contrived, but the cast, I feel, ultimately rises above it all. Matt Damon is a sturdy lead and he grounds the story, and I do like that spark between him and Scarlett Johannson. Elle Fanning, who is growing up fast, has a glow about her, sweetly playing the zookeeper's younger sister, Lily, who approaches the tormented artist Dylan with open acceptance. And while there's a chance that Crowe may have overplayed his hand by making Rosie's input so invaluable in a key sequence - it's pretty hard to believe that a seven-year-old could be so canny - there's no arguing that Maggie Elizabeth Jones is just about the cutest thing on earth (sorry, tap-dancing penguins). So, I dunno, sir. WE BOUGHT A ZOO may not come across as emotionally blunt or ""truthful"" as THE DESCENDANTS. But this is Christmastime wherein edges are softened. There's no place here for blunt truths.",4,"""Travel the stages of grief... but stop right before zebras get involved.""",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,4070,"['Really', 'when', 'are', 'folks', 'most', 'maudlin', 'not', 'holiday', 'season', 'When', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'forgive', 'one', 'abundance', 'sentimentality', 'WE', 'BOUGHT', 'ZOO', 'utilizes', 'savvy', 'product', 'placement', 'coinciding', 'box', 'office', 'release', 'month', 'December', 'Not', 'mattered', 'one', 'bit', 'when', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'come', 'out', 'Me', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'sentimental', 'stuff', 'movie', 'title', ""n't"", 'lie', 'get', 'gist', 'premise', 'Here', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'again', 'manipulating', 'emotions', 'coaxing', 'laugh', 'making', 'tear', 'up', 'such', 'user.It', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'plays', 'journalist', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'who', 'adventurous', 'streak', 'interviewed', 'dangerous', 'underworld', 'figures', 'third', 'world', 'nations', 'flown', 'Category', '4', 'storms', 'Benjamin', 'profoundly', '20', 'seconds', 'insane', 'courage', 'can', 'only', 'alter', 'life', 'better', 'how', 'much', 'insane', 'courage', 'can', 'one', 'muster', 'when', 'love', 'life', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'pity', 'even', 'pity', 'assignments', 'work', 'Six', 'months', 'wife', 'passing', 'Benjamin', 'career', 'when', 'neighbor', 'party', 'seven-year-old', 'girl', 'Rosie', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'remark', 'happy', 'too', 'loud', 'fam', 'Seeking', 'new', 'residence', 'Rosie', 'stumble', 'what', 'be', 'ideal', 'home', 'country', 'even', 'nine', 'miles', 'Target', 'store', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'store', 'broken-down', 'zoo', 'attached', 'house', 'Buy', 'one', 'buy', 'other', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'always', 'strived', 'give', 'kids', 'authentic', 'American', 'experience', 'bump', 'common', 'sense', 'interfering', 'here', 'Ultimately', 'little', 'Rosie', 'unbounded', 'joy', 'thought', 'having', 'zoo', 'things', 'Benjamin', 'cautious', 'accountant', 'brother', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'pretty', 'much', 'aghast.WE', 'BOUGHT', 'A', 'ZOO', ""n't"", 'as', 'incisive', 'emotionally', 'searing', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'similar', 'picture', 'dealing', 'family', 'grief', 'WE', 'BOUGHT', 'ZOO', 'be', 'frank', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nominated', 'as', 'many', 'awards', 'DESCENDANTS', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'better', 'Sue', 'prefering', 'clear-cut', 'happy', 'endings', 'Clooney', 'dramedy', 'cut', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'one', 'WE', 'BOUGHT', 'A', 'ZOO', 'close', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'fierce', 'performance', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'rest', 'cast', 'guide', 'more', 'familiar', 'territory', 'story', 'warmth', 'undeniable', 'sweetness', 'brought', 'about', 'huge', 'part', 'actors', 'also', 'Crowe', 'knack', 'heartstring', 'tugging', 'course', 'zoo', 'animals.Benjamin', 'Mee', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Rosemoor', 'Wildlife', 'Park', 'been', 'dead', 'water', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'just', 'how', 'strongly', 'want', 'commit', 'operating', 'zoo', 'let', 'alone', 'resurrecting', 'specs', 'dreaded', 'inspection', 'fast', 'approaching', 'idiosyncratic', 'new', 'employees', 'including', 'gorgeous', 'zookeeper', 'Kelly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'are', 'casting', 'dubious', 'eyes', 'Benjamin', 'troubled', 'teen', 'son', 'Dylan', 'place', 'everything', 'really', 'drawing', 'disturbing', 'images', 'Benjamin', 'Dylan', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect.I', 'admit', 'choked', 'up', 'places', 'damn', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Yes', 'sappy', 'film', 'bits', 'feel', 'contrived', 'cast', 'feel', 'ultimately', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'sturdy', 'lead', 'story', 'do', 'spark', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'fast', 'glow', 'sweetly', 'playing', 'zookeeper', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lily', 'who', 'tormented', 'artist', 'Dylan', 'open', 'acceptance', 'chance', 'Crowe', 'may', 'have', 'overplayed', 'hand', 'making', 'Rosie', 'input', 'so', 'invaluable', 'key', 'sequence', 'pretty', 'hard', 'believe', 'seven-year-old', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'canny', 'arguing', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'just', 'cutest', 'thing', 'earth', 'sorry', 'tap-dancing', 'penguins', 'So', 'dunno', 'sir', 'WE', 'BOUGHT', 'ZOO', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'emotionally', 'blunt', 'truthful', 'DESCENDANTS', 'Christmastime', 'wherein', 'edges', 'are', 'softened', 'place', 'here', 'blunt', 'truths']",N/A

But it's very well done - an excellent cast holds it together and the dialog is believable enough to keep the audience engaged and routing for the zoo's success. My only question was why the zoo was moved from its real life location in England to a fictional rural area outside Los Angeles - some of the quirky zookeeper characters would probably have worked more effectively if it had stayed in the UK.I've read some comments on both here and IMDB that the profanity is too much much for a family film - personally I didn't think there was anything that was not family oriented but then again I don't have kids!

Benjamin's wife passed away six months earlier and his life has been a whirlwind of keeping up with his two kids as well as working at a job he no longer likes.  Looking for a career change and a new home, Benjamin discovers an old victorian-style house in the country.  However, this house is much more than Benjamin bargained for; it's also a zoo, complete with bears, tigers, porcupines, and other animals.  Undeterred, Benjamin goes ahead with the purchase.  He has also inherited the zoo's staff, led by head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansen).Benjamin and Kelly must deal not only with the animals, but also the snuffy inspector who has the power to shut the zoo down.  With words of encouragement from his brother, Benjamin sticks it out and, with Kelly's help, manage to get the zoo up and running again.I watched this movie with my children and we all enjoyed it very much.

I can't believe I wasted the three dollars on this.First, this is NOT a family film.  The language is inappropriate, the lack of respect for adults astounding, and the promotion of selfishness incredible.  The artwork Gee's son drew was graphically violent and my children were covering their eyes.  The threats made by the Scotsman were uncalled for.Secondly, the characters and scenes were completely unbelievable.  A five-year old girl who just lost her mother to cancer would not be Little Miss Sunshine (and then turn around and call the inspector a 'dick' to his face at the end). The wife of a man like this wouldn't hide $84K for a rainy day, and hide the evidence of it in the pocket of a sweatshirt, somewhere.  There's no way they would haul 300lb grandmothers over a tree to get them in the zoo like that - HUGE insurance liabilities, that!  The young boy was horrible: he screamed at adults, was a thief, a liar, and even when the father told him to 'think about someone other than himself' he was screaming ""ME, ME.""  The behavior went WAY beyond just grief... there were basics missing, there.Scarlett J... is there a reason Hollywood has to settle for this?  There are beautiful, talented, tasteful, passionate actresses out there.  This woman is not one of them - I don't understand the appeal.  Scarlett hasn't got what it takes.  She spent the entirety of the movie making cow eyes at Matt Damon, only stirring herself to be the 'commanding zookeeper' at random moments throughout the movie.  Either she's needy or strong, but make up your mind what characterization you wish to portray.Matt Damon was THE only redeeming part of the movie, and his character was so mired in a twisted mix of loss, desperation, frustration, and a complete sense of overwhelming disbelief that the poor actor had a hard time holding both the character and the movie together.  And Lord, please smite the person who was in charge of Matt's hair and wardrobe.  We've come a LONG way from Jason Bourne, baby.  But apparently Hollywood wants us to know that when one becomes a parent, they loose all sense of taste and class, capable of only choosing cable knit sweaters and corduroy.The only part of the movie that stood out as intriguing was Lilly, whose situation is never explained, whose guardianship I didn't understand, and while I'm all for homeschool themes threading their way into film, I never quite understood who was supervising her education or when there was time for it.  But the obvious contrast between Dylan (public schooled teen with emotional and behavioral issues, a lack of ability to relate to other age groups and situations, and a lack of direction) compared to Lilly (articulate, curious, creative, friendly, polite, and helpful) was amusing... and also seen in ""A Dolphin Tale"" with Hazel vs. Sawyer.

Colin Ford, on the other hand, is wonderful as the alienated teenage son. There isn't much interaction or `awwww-how-cute' moments with the animals; this story is about the people.Since it's based on a true story, I can appreciate the heart behind it, but still, fixing up the dilapidated zoo did seem rather effortless for Damon's city-slicker character.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 0]","This is a soulful family film centered on a widowed father (Matt Damon) and his 2 kids, who buy a small and troubled local zoo in an attempt to make a fresh start. Scarlett Johannson stars as head zookeeper, with a humorous supporting cast in roles as zoo employees. They all must pull together to get the zoo ready for a new grand opening, and face many challenges. Along the way, Damon reconnects with his difficult teenage son, and comes to terms with his grief.It's a sober film in many ways, although the animals and the young daughter provide some comic relief. I watched it with a 7 year old and 2 five year olds, and the 7 year old was engaged throughout, but the 5 year olds got bored with the more dramatic scenes. There is also some explicit language, including the young daughter calling a zoo inspector a dick. So between that and the adult drama, I'd say it's probably best suited for kids 7 and up or so. My only other complaint is that Johansson's and Damon's characters are supposed to be falling for each other, but unfortunately don't seem to have much chemistry, although otherwise they put in solid performances.

Kid friendly movies are very hard to come by and to bash this one as such is not right.This movie is a great family movie, BUT you have to know your children and what they can handle.  Yes, there are some possibly scary/disturbing images drawn by the son, which are shown several times.  I wish the movie didn't have them, or at least didn't make them so graphic, and the movie would have worked just fine without them.  It does have its place in the movie and the family works through it.  (This caused me to give the movie four stars instead of five, it just wasn't necessary) There is also some language that parents may be concerned about. H*.l a few times, S--t three to six times, B.S. once or twice & *$$ or A-ho once or twice.  HOWEVER, I just heard that the DVD will feature a family friendly audio track that can be selected in the menu.  This will reduce the above instances greatly changing a few S--ts to Shoot and possibly eliminating them alltogether.  This does not address the disturbing images though, so keep that in mind.Overall this movie will give you a great story full of emotion and laughter. This is one movie you can watch with the whole family~ young and old (provided the previously mentioned images are discussed and perhaps understood beforehand).

When his wife passes away after an illness (we are led to believe that it might have been cancer), Benjamin mentally ""checks out"" from life.  The loss is keenly felt by his son (Colin Ford) and daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones).  Ben quits his job, his son gets expelled from school, and the scene is set for the most improbable adventure of all . . . life.Benjamin leaves everything behind and winds up purchasing a new house with an interesting stipulation: he must also take on the administration and upkeep of the zoo that is located on the property!  Throw in a skeleton crew of loyal staff, a runaway bear, an aging tiger, and more wildlife than you can shake a stick at, and you have the makings of the ultimate adventure.  Is Benjamin up to the challenge?  Or has the adventure specialist finally met his match?Touted by Lou Lumenick as ""a delightful surprise of a family movie,"" I would have to cautiously agree.  There are some issues with language, which can be dealt with by selecting the Family-Friendly Audio Track (in English only).  There are a couple of kissing scenes, but there are no hot and heavy groping sessions at all.  There is a sort of clubhouse where the staff meets to unwind, so alcohol and tobacco are prevalent as well.Other special features of the DVD include:  Audio in Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish, and French languages as well as Descriptive Audio and a Commentary with Director Cameron Crowe, Actor J.B. Smoove, and Editor Mark Livelsi; and Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired and in Spanish.WE BOUGHT A ZOO is loosely based upon the real-life story of the Dartmoor Zoological Park located in Dartmoor, Deveon, England, which was forced to close in 2006, and reopened under the Mee family in 2007.  The film was nominated for Best Live Action Family Film by the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, and for Best Original Song by the Satellite Awards.  Not only did Cameron Crowe direct the film, he was the lyricist for the song in question.Throughout the film, the viewer will be bombarded with the positive message, ""Bad things happen.  You just keep going.""  Benjamin Mee and his family continue to do so, despite an evil Zoo inspector, a traitor in their midst, and a financial mess that would keep Bill Gates up at night.

1417200,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW9W,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It's not often that a movie exceeds any negative expectations you have for it. That holds more true when a movie is marketed as a feel good movie that seems so saccharine sweet you're afraid you'll go into a diabetic coma should you watch it. Those were the feelings I had when I heard just the title of the film WE BOUGHT A ZOO. When I saw the trailer for it I felt it had to be as bad as I expected. What a rude awakening I had when I finally watched the movie. It's fantastic.Matt Damon stars as Ben Mee, a journalist who spends most of his career traveling to exotic locations and facing danger. But nothing has prepared him for the death of his wife and being alone with his two children. The same holds true for dealing with where they live, a location where everything he sees reminds him of his wife and his loss.Son Dylan (Colin Ford) has had the most difficulty dealing with the loss. He's in trouble non-stop at school where they're concerned about the themes of his art work (severed heads and gore) and where he lashes out by breaking rules. When he has his third strike, he's expelled and a new school needs to be located.Dylan's sister Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is the adorable one. She's the most uplifting thing this family has to offer. She never dwells on the loss of her mother and helps Ben to hold the family together be it talks the two have or packing lunches for the next day.With all that's going on Ben decides he and the children need a change. They need a different house, a different location and something new in their lives. He quits his job and begins house hunting. When he and Rosie find the ideal house they discover there's a hitch...the house is part of a zoo in need of much repair. But he sees this as a challenge and something to do so they buy the zoo.Some things go as expected with Dylan seeing this as unfavorable and thinking more of him than the family. Ben shows the usual frustrations with dealing with a teen filled with angst as well as a new job. But with the help of the staff he inherits they work toward the goal of having the zoo ready for inspection and opening come June.Heading that staff is Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson). With more knowledge than most she has kept the place running and taken care of the animals while a suitable buyer was sought. Along with her are several staff members, most notably Peter MacReady (Angus Macfadyen) as a zoo designer with a grudge against the zoo inspector who can determine if they are permitted to open or not.The movie follows the ups and downs of trying to keep the zoo afloat and remade in time to meet their deadline for repairs suggested by the inspector. Money is tight and it seems they might not only have little time but little cash to accomplish their goal. But the film doesn't focus solely on this problem. At the heart of the film is the emotional turmoil going on in this family, as much with Ben as with Dylan. And as they try and cope with their own problem, the staff gets involved as well.This is a film about people trying to rise above the worst situation they can possibly imagine. It's about people being brought together for a reason even if they aren't aware that fate has driven them into each other's arms. It's about love and the meaning of it all and about loss roped in the middle of that love.The movie is never boring and never overly sentimental, a trap that many movies with these themes tend to fall into. Instead it deals with the problems the family faces as well as the predicaments they find themselves in while rebuilding the zoo.The acting is fantastic doing what the best of actors do: make you believe that they are the character and not an actor playing a role. Everyone from Damon on down turns in a performance you can believe.The movie is supposed to be based on a true story and if so then I'm hoping the zoo is still up and running. Perhaps the romance in the picture isn't real but we can hope so. And in the end we can hope that Ben Mee and his family are at peace and loving life again while we have the chance to share in their story and their triumph with this film.",5,FUN FAMILY FILM,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,4127,"['not', 'often', 'movie', 'negative', 'expectations', 'have', 'more', 'true', 'when', 'movie', 'marketed', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'so', 'saccharine', 'sweet', ""'re"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'go', 'diabetic', 'coma', 'should', 'watch', 'were', 'feelings', 'had', 'when', 'heard', 'just', 'title', 'film', 'WE', 'BOUGHT', 'ZOO', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'felt', 'had', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'What', 'rude', 'awakening', 'had', 'when', 'finally', 'watched', 'movie', 'fantastic.Matt', 'Damon', 'stars', 'Ben', 'Mee', 'journalist', 'who', 'most', 'career', 'traveling', 'exotic', 'locations', 'facing', 'danger', 'nothing', 'prepared', 'death', 'wife', 'being', 'alone', 'two', 'children', 'same', 'true', 'dealing', 'where', 'live', 'location', 'where', 'everything', 'wife', 'loss.Son', 'Dylan', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'had', 'most', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'loss', 'trouble', 'non-stop', 'school', 'where', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'themes', 'art', 'work', 'severed', 'heads', 'gore', 'where', 'out', 'breaking', 'rules', 'When', 'third', 'strike', 'expelled', 'new', 'school', 'needs', 'be', 'located.Dylan', 'sister', 'Rosie', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'adorable', 'one', 'most', 'uplifting', 'thing', 'family', 'offer', 'never', 'loss', 'mother', 'Ben', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'be', 'two', 'have', 'packing', 'lunches', 'next', 'day.With', 'going', 'Ben', 'children', 'need', 'change', 'need', 'different', 'house', 'different', 'location', 'something', 'new', 'lives', 'job', 'house', 'hunting', 'When', 'Rosie', 'find', 'ideal', 'house', 'discover', 'hitch', 'house', 'part', 'zoo', 'need', 'much', 'repair', 'challenge', 'something', 'do', 'so', 'buy', 'zoo.Some', 'things', 'go', 'expected', 'Dylan', 'seeing', 'unfavorable', 'thinking', 'more', 'family', 'Ben', 'usual', 'frustrations', 'dealing', 'teen', 'filled', 'angst', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'job', 'help', 'staff', 'work', 'goal', 'having', 'zoo', 'ready', 'inspection', 'opening', 'come', 'June.Heading', 'staff', 'Kelly', 'Foster', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'more', 'knowledge', 'most', 'kept', 'place', 'running', 'taken', 'care', 'animals', 'suitable', 'buyer', 'was', 'sought', 'are', 'several', 'staff', 'members', 'most', 'notably', 'Peter', 'MacReady', 'Angus', 'Macfadyen', 'zoo', 'designer', 'grudge', 'zoo', 'inspector', 'who', 'can', 'determine', 'are', 'permitted', 'open', 'not.The', 'movie', 'ups', 'downs', 'trying', 'keep', 'zoo', 'afloat', 'remade', 'time', 'meet', 'deadline', 'repairs', 'suggested', 'inspector', 'Money', 'tight', 'might', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'little', 'cash', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'film', ""n't"", 'focus', 'solely', 'problem', 'heart', 'film', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'going', 'family', 'much', 'Ben', 'Dylan', 'try', 'cope', 'own', 'problem', 'staff', 'involved', 'well.This', 'film', 'people', 'trying', 'rise', 'worst', 'situation', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'people', 'being', 'brought', 'together', 'reason', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'fate', 'driven', 'other', 'arms', 'love', 'meaning', 'loss', 'roped', 'middle', 'love.The', 'movie', 'never', 'boring', 'never', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'trap', 'many', 'movies', 'themes', 'tend', 'fall', 'Instead', 'problems', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'predicaments', 'find', 'rebuilding', 'zoo.The', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'actors', 'do', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'character', 'not', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'Everyone', 'Damon', 'down', 'turns', 'performance', 'can', 'believe.The', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'so', 'then', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'zoo', 'still', 'up', 'running', 'Perhaps', 'romance', 'picture', ""n't"", 'real', 'can', 'hope', 'so', 'end', 'can', 'hope', 'Ben', 'Mee', 'family', 'are', 'peace', 'loving', 'life', 'again', 'have', 'chance', 'share', 'story', 'triumph', 'film']",N/A

Gagliano ""Maria""","[0, 0]","The 411 by Maria:I was eager to see this because it starred Matt Damon and an adorable little actress Maggie Elizabeth Jones whose face just lights up the screen. Love her.Matt Damon is a widow who is raising his children alone and doing a decent job of getting them where they need to go but not dealing with the death of their mother and how it effects them, especially his preteen Dylan. Believing that a fresh start would be right for his family he moves them to a house that comes with its very own zoo animals and staff.With some cute moments, We Brought A Zoo shows a touch of reality. As a child who lost her mom and raised by a father, this is exactly how most men deal with loss. The scene of him and his little daughter going through his wives clothes and deciding what to keep just about made me lose it. I did that! While a deep emotional subject, I didn't feel the movie to be emotional. Damon does a great job playing a very, good looking dad doing the best he can, but even while he watched the movies of his wife with the kids, the emotion was kept at a family friendly level.While there were moments in the movie that dragged more than others, I appreciated this family friendly movie although we were a bit confused at times (the ending) and flabbergasted at others like who was financing the zoo before Matt Damon's character came along, who paid for the staff and why did they help all those people climb over trees to get to the zoo. Maybe a rain date would have been better considering the liability on someone getting hurt. Although we thought it would be on as background noise while we worked, we closed our computer's 15 minutes in and watched all of it.Great performance by Colin Ford who plays Dylan, Damon's son. Very good looking kid with a bright future and little Maggie Elizabeth Jones could just be standing there without a script and I would watch.",3,"Not Overly Dramatic or Emotional, Nice Family Movie",1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1884,"['411', 'Maria', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'starred', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'adorable', 'little', 'actress', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'face', 'just', 'up', 'screen', 'Love', 'her.Matt', 'Damon', 'widow', 'who', 'raising', 'children', 'alone', 'doing', 'decent', 'job', 'getting', 'where', 'need', 'go', 'not', 'dealing', 'death', 'mother', 'how', 'effects', 'especially', 'preteen', 'Dylan', 'Believing', 'fresh', 'start', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'family', 'house', 'very', 'own', 'zoo', 'animals', 'staff.With', 'cute', 'moments', 'Brought', 'A', 'Zoo', 'touch', 'reality', 'child', 'who', 'lost', 'mom', 'raised', 'father', 'exactly', 'how', 'most', 'men', 'deal', 'loss', 'scene', 'little', 'daughter', 'going', 'wives', 'clothes', 'deciding', 'what', 'keep', 'just', 'made', 'lose', 'did', 'deep', 'emotional', 'subject', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'be', 'emotional', 'Damon', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'dad', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'even', 'watched', 'movies', 'wife', 'kids', 'emotion', 'was', 'kept', 'family', 'friendly', 'were', 'moments', 'movie', 'dragged', 'more', 'others', 'appreciated', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'were', 'bit', 'confused', 'times', 'ending', 'flabbergasted', 'others', 'who', 'was', 'financing', 'zoo', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'came', 'along', 'who', 'paid', 'staff', 'why', 'did', 'help', 'people', 'climb', 'trees', 'get', 'zoo', 'Maybe', 'rain', 'date', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'considering', 'liability', 'someone', 'getting', 'hurt', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'background', 'noise', 'worked', 'closed', 'computer', '15', 'minutes', 'watched', 'it.Great', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'who', 'Dylan', 'Damon', 'son', 'Very', 'good', 'looking', 'kid', 'bright', 'future', 'little', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'standing', 'there', 'script', 'would', 'watch']",N/A

Well, at least if you like the same kind of music he does.  I do.  Here he borrows from real life events and tells the story of a recently widowed journalist (Matt Damon) and his two children.  As you might expect Benjamin Mee (Damon) struggles with solo child rearing.  His precocious 7 year old daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is making her own lunch for school and tries to be helpful.  His 14 year old son (very good Colin Ford) on the other hand gets expelled from school for stealing and drawing bizarre Daliesque images.  He also seems to hate his dad.Benjamin (""Ben was my dad"") decides they need to move away from the city so eventually they settle on a large house in the country, 9 miles from Target and Home Depot.  The one wrinkle is that it comes with a real life working zoo.  And Benjamin needs to get it up and running for its reopening.  The zookeeper is comely Scarlett Johansson.  Sure it is.  Now Benjamin pines throughout the film for his beautiful departed wife, but manages to get into the work.  It is costing him a fortune but he likes it.  A cousin of Kelly the zookeeper is Lily (Elle Fanning) who is a year or two younger than morose Dylan (Ford) and she of course, takes a liking to his brooding personality.The film's direction is easy to predict and Crowe and company are certainly breaking no new ground.  The tear ducts are assaulted on a regular basis, but damn if I wasn't drawn in.  What makes this film more than the standard syrupy sentimental drama is Damon's performance.  It doesn't seem to matter with him as to whether he's kicking ass as Jason Bourne or doing animation voice work, he gives it his all.  And it is clearly evident in this PG family drama.  Some punches are pulled to hold on to the rating, but it is an enjoyable film for everyone...unless you still believe in the Easter Bunny.The Blu ray version of this film is excellent.  There are no complaints either with the video (1.85:1 aspect ratio) or the excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.",3,3 1/2 stars for a very good family film (most families),1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2121,"['Cameron', 'Crowe', 'helm', 'co-wrote', 'also', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'very', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Well', 'least', 'like', 'same', 'kind', 'music', 'do', 'Here', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'story', 'recently', 'widowed', 'journalist', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'two', 'children', 'might', 'expect', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'Damon', 'solo', 'child', 'rearing', 'precocious', '7', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'making', 'own', 'lunch', 'school', 'tries', 'be', 'helpful', '14', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'very', 'good', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'other', 'hand', 'expelled', 'school', 'stealing', 'drawing', 'bizarre', 'Daliesque', 'images', 'also', 'hate', 'dad.Benjamin', 'Ben', 'was', 'dad', 'need', 'move', 'away', 'city', 'so', 'eventually', 'settle', 'large', 'house', 'country', '9', 'miles', 'Target', 'Home', 'Depot', 'one', 'wrinkle', 'real', 'life', 'working', 'zoo', 'Benjamin', 'get', 'up', 'running', 'reopening', 'zookeeper', 'comely', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Sure', 'Now', 'Benjamin', 'pines', 'film', 'beautiful', 'departed', 'wife', 'get', 'work', 'costing', 'fortune', 'cousin', 'Kelly', 'zookeeper', 'Lily', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'who', 'year', 'two', 'younger', 'morose', 'Dylan', 'Ford', 'course', 'liking', 'brooding', 'personality.The', 'film', 'direction', 'easy', 'predict', 'Crowe', 'company', 'are', 'certainly', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'tear', 'ducts', 'are', 'assaulted', 'regular', 'basis', 'damn', 'was', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'What', 'film', 'more', 'standard', 'syrupy', 'sentimental', 'drama', 'Damon', 'performance', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'kicking', 'ass', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'doing', 'animation', 'voice', 'work', 'clearly', 'evident', 'PG', 'family', 'drama', 'punches', 'are', 'pulled', 'hold', 'rating', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'everyone', 'still', 'believe', 'Easter', 'Bunny.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'excellent', 'are', 'complaints', 'video', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'excellent', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'soundtrack']",N/A

I am not going to go as far as to say that I loved the film, because for me, the movie did not get interesting until we were two-thirds of the way in -- and that is just a bit too far.  The scene between Damon and his fourteen-year-old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, is what opened up this formulaic adaptation, it just took too long to get to the good stuff.Based on the book by Benjamin Mee, the family is in turmoil following the death of Ben's wife and the family is in desperate need of a getaway.  Not just physically, but emotionally, so when Ben and Rosie go house hunting a curious thing happens.  The perfect house is available, the only stipulation, a small zoo is also part of the package.With no experience and very limited funds, Ben jumps in with both feet, and is able to turn the place into a home for both his family and the abandoned animals.As I said, this film is based very loosely on a book by Benjamin Mees.  The Mee's zoo is actually located in England whereas the fictional Rosemoor Wildlife Park is portrayed to be located in California.  There are a couple of facts that are toyed with, but for a child going to see this movie, that does not matter.  The animals are adorable and Rosie will appeal to even the hardest heart.There have been some complaints about the language used by the 7-year-old daughter, but for me that was not too big of a deal.  That is how some children talk, and to be honest, it was a funny scene.Do I recommend it, yes, but only if you are not expecting high drama and like a little sugar coating.",3,Upstaged by a Seven-Year-Old,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1763,"['must', 'be', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'be', 'upstaged', 'seven-year-old', 'child', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Disney', 'family', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'interesting', 'were', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'scene', 'Damon', 'fourteen-year-old', 'son', 'Dylan', 'played', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'what', 'opened', 'up', 'formulaic', 'adaptation', 'just', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'good', 'stuff.Based', 'book', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'family', 'turmoil', 'following', 'death', 'Ben', 'wife', 'family', 'desperate', 'need', 'getaway', 'Not', 'just', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'so', 'when', 'Ben', 'Rosie', 'go', 'house', 'hunting', 'curious', 'thing', 'happens', 'perfect', 'house', 'available', 'only', 'stipulation', 'small', 'zoo', 'also', 'part', 'package.With', 'experience', 'very', 'limited', 'funds', 'Ben', 'feet', 'able', 'turn', 'place', 'home', 'family', 'abandoned', 'animals.As', 'said', 'film', 'based', 'very', 'loosely', 'book', 'Benjamin', 'Mees', 'Mee', 'zoo', 'actually', 'located', 'England', 'whereas', 'fictional', 'Rosemoor', 'Wildlife', 'Park', 'portrayed', 'be', 'located', 'California', 'are', 'couple', 'facts', 'are', 'toyed', 'child', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'matter', 'animals', 'are', 'adorable', 'Rosie', 'will', 'appeal', 'even', 'hardest', 'heart.There', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'language', 'used', '7-year-old', 'daughter', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'big', 'deal', 'how', 'children', 'talk', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'funny', 'scene.Do', 'recommend', 'yes', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'high', 'drama', 'little', 'sugar', 'coating']",N/A

Yet each character has their own mountain to climb, and the zoo provides them all with a collective goal that is therapeutic for their own recuperation.This is a film that allows the viewer to appreciate all that life presents, and healing from major grief can be achieved with a task that stimulates the body and the heart and mind.Nicholas R.W.

Benjamin the main character has lost his wife to an illness and has two young children, a seven year old girl and fourteen year old boy.  The girl is sweet, adorable, and adds a lot of sparkle to the movie.  The boy is a teenager with a lot of personal problems and a talent for drawing grotesque images along with acting out, getting expelled from school, etc.  Actually in the scene with the principal I think I wouldn't want to attend that particular school either.  He's also sent home from the next school for being ""moody"" and one starts to wonder whether the family would be better off in another school district or another state!  There are some unbelievable scenes as well like when Benjamin has the stand off with the escaped grizzly bear and manages to get the bear to lie down. Mostly the bear would've had him for lunch by then!  There is a lot of grieving in this movie mostly on the part of Benjamin, who keeps trying to keep the memory alive with photos and images of the past.  Dylan, the son also is having a difficult time trying to adjust to this new ""zoo life"" and get along with his father.

1417264,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B004LWZW9W,Rissi,"[5, 5]","Stories that have plots in some way derived of ""inspired by true events"" can go one of two ways. The first is either more of docu-drama that is far too technical and biographical to be really entertaining, and the second option is an uplifting drama that could inspire its viewer to betterment. This movie is the latter.He has been on a plane that went straight into the heart of a hurricane, interviewed world leaders in war-torn countries but nothing could prepare Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) for the loss of his beloved wife and the responsibility of raising his two children without Katherine at his side. A year ago the family of four was a happy, typical American family; six months ago they said good-bye to a wife and mother. Now, Benjamin is tired of sympathy. He cannot stomach the attentions he or his children are getting from people who are merely feeling pity for them. His brother, Duncan (Thomas Hayden Church) encourages Benjamin to get out more and ""interact"" with people but when his fourteen-year-old son (Colin Ford) gets expelled from school after his fourth offense, Benjamin sees that something needs to change. With a fresh start in mind, he and his precocious seven-year-old daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) begin looking at new properties until he finds one that is exactly what his family needs - only problem is, the backyard is literally a zoo!Dylan is angry about the move and thinks his adventurer dad is crazy to buy a zoo while young Rosie finds happiness and a place where she can feel at home - and best of all, his daughter is laughing again. The Mee's find the zoo staff knowledgeable and ready to help them along as they learn everything about zoo-keeping. Head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) befriends the family and is encouraged to see Benjamin has a genuine heart to make the zoo a success while her shy cousin Lily (Elle Fanning) attempts to be friends with Dylan. Even with minor progress behind them, hardships still find Benjamin. Unless the family can band together, their livelihood will be sorely tested.Seeing this movie when I did almost didn't happen because the copy I had reserved wasn't coming in but I nabbed one elsewhere and can only say how glad I am to have seen it! There is a lot to be admired in this film regardless of a premise that seems mediocre and not all that ""interesting"" when compared to some of the blockbusters that are clamoring for ""first place"" and our attention. One of the first things I was most impressed with was the script - it is not only funny (more on that later) but also tugs on our heartstrings in a way that still leaves us with a smile at the end result. All of the dialogue - or the majority of it, is written with a family grieving in mind, and that is one of its strengths. The directing is equally dynamic. There are multiple scenes that I loved the set-up of; the simplicity in them is not too sappy but yet has a beautiful familiarity to them - scenes that are reminiscent of realistic life. It is this quality that so endears the film, and connects with its audience.What helps this along to an extreme that is beautifully portrayed is the acting. Damon is a first-rate versatile actor, and he does not disappoint in this role. Seeing him play a father is one of the best roles he's had to date - the way he relates to his on-screen children is precious. Then there are the child actors; Colin does an admirable job but it is young Maggie who steals every single frame she is in. I cannot tell you what a doll she was in this role, how sweet, sassy and spot-on perfect she is. You just have to experience it for yourself. She is like a miniature adult who is still an innocent in the best sense of the word. (Many of you may also remember her from the re-make of ""Footloose."") Although I don't clamor to see everything Johansson is in, she is cute in the role and her chemistry with Damon is memorable albeit one made of more tender emotions than ""sparks"" of romance. (It was also a pleasant surprise to see one of the rotating ""squints"" from ""Bones"" in a supporting role.)""We Bought a Zoo"" is the surprise movie of the year at my house (yes, I am aware it is only April). My whole family found it precious, and something we all got a chuckle out of. Its true story working idea makes it more endearing than usual but the cast is what pulls it all together. How everything comes together at the end may be a bit of a clich&eacute; but for the most part, the movie does not fall into those sorts of traps. Instead it is a pleasant family drama with an ending that doesn't stop where you think it will.

The animals, and the little girl actor, were both great for families watching this, but the profanity, as well as some of the emotionally-exhausting yelling sequences between father and son were probably geared for slightly older viewers.

1417280,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B004LWZW9W,Sheryl Fechter,"[10, 14]","There is an overwhelming sentimentality to Cameron Crowe's movie ""We Bought A Zoo"".  This is not all strictly 'fun and games'.  Crowe has always had the ability to dig deep in his pockets to reach the real issue in the most personal way.In this lovely film it is definitely more about a family's grieving, and the way the father, Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon), has to try to re-construct his family after the major loss of his wife, and his two children's mother, less than a year prior.There are no easy tasks involved anywhere, especially with his son Dylan (Colin Ford - giving a wonderful performance) who is scattered between his grief and anger.  Add Thomas Haden Church, as Mee's outspoken brother, and a lot of comedic relief countering Benjamin all the time. Just as Ben says ""yes"" to things, he says ""NO"" in typical Haden Church style.  I can't forget his very young, starry-eyed daughter Rosie, she adds so much childlike whimsy to this story and seems to have a lot of knowledge for her wee age.Benjamin Mee starts to get frustrated with his present career and all his familial issues, resulting in finding it necessary for a very monumental change and moves to a new home.  Surprised with finding the opportunity to be taking over a once prosperous zoo on the newly acquired property, Mee realizes his family can be prosperous there also.The staff is indecisive about whether another buyer of the zoo will stay and make a 'go of it'. This staff is educated in the ways of animal care and quite a diverse cast of characters.  They are a family, of sorts, and convene nightly for fun and conversation - they all know each other very well.  Heading up the zoo is Kelley (Scarlett Johansson) as the zookeeper, who also begins interacting with Mee in a more personal regard.  Among many others, is Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous"");  I was happy to see Cameron Crowe using him in another of his movies, he adds a spark of personality to the whole theme.Through the whole experience of running and opening the zoo to the public, there are many conflicts in this film that are resolved.  One pertinent issue would be relinquished by Benjamin grappling with an older tiger.  The relevance of it brings on a change for him in a far deeper regard.New relationships are established; the inspector who is always there with a 'close this down' attitude may be seeing things differently. The people of the town are beginning to have hope in the project, and most important for Benjamin Mee is that his family is beginning to act as One, through the devastating loss they have suffered.  They may just be able to move forward now instead of remaining in what is past.For myself, I found it fun to see Damon and Johansson acting outside of most of their stereotypical roles.  I found them quite believable and entertaining as an interactive family.  I think this movie is a great pick for a family picture; including lots of fun with animals, situations with the children and life beginning to be more on the upswing.",5,"This movie is ""Why We Bought A Zoo...""",1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,3008,"['overwhelming', 'sentimentality', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'not', 'strictly', 'games', 'Crowe', 'always', 'had', 'ability', 'dig', 'deep', 'pockets', 'reach', 'real', 'issue', 'most', 'personal', 'way.In', 'lovely', 'film', 'definitely', 'more', 'family', 'grieving', 'way', 'father', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'try', 're-construct', 'family', 'major', 'loss', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'mother', 'less', 'year', 'prior.There', 'are', 'easy', 'tasks', 'involved', 'anywhere', 'especially', 'son', 'Dylan', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'giving', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'who', 'scattered', 'grief', 'anger', 'Add', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Mee', 'outspoken', 'brother', 'lot', 'comedic', 'relief', 'countering', 'Benjamin', 'time', 'Just', 'Ben', 'yes', 'things', 'NO', 'typical', 'Haden', 'Church', 'style', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'very', 'young', 'starry-eyed', 'daughter', 'Rosie', 'so', 'much', 'childlike', 'whimsy', 'story', 'have', 'lot', 'knowledge', 'wee', 'age.Benjamin', 'Mee', 'get', 'frustrated', 'present', 'career', 'familial', 'issues', 'resulting', 'finding', 'necessary', 'very', 'monumental', 'change', 'moves', 'new', 'home', 'Surprised', 'finding', 'opportunity', 'be', 'taking', 'once', 'prosperous', 'zoo', 'newly', 'acquired', 'property', 'Mee', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'prosperous', 'also.The', 'staff', 'indecisive', 'buyer', 'zoo', 'will', 'stay', 'make', ""'go"", 'staff', 'educated', 'ways', 'animal', 'care', 'quite', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'family', 'sorts', 'nightly', 'fun', 'conversation', 'know', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'Heading', 'up', 'zoo', 'Kelley', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'zookeeper', 'who', 'also', 'interacting', 'Mee', 'more', 'personal', 'regard', 'many', 'others', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'using', 'movies', 'spark', 'personality', 'whole', 'whole', 'experience', 'running', 'opening', 'zoo', 'public', 'are', 'many', 'conflicts', 'film', 'are', 'resolved', 'One', 'pertinent', 'issue', 'would', 'be', 'relinquished', 'Benjamin', 'grappling', 'older', 'tiger', 'relevance', 'change', 'far', 'deeper', 'regard.New', 'relationships', 'are', 'established', 'inspector', 'who', 'always', ""'close"", 'down', 'attitude', 'may', 'be', 'seeing', 'things', 'differently', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'beginning', 'have', 'hope', 'project', 'most', 'important', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'family', 'beginning', 'act', 'One', 'devastating', 'loss', 'have', 'suffered', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'forward', 'now', 'instead', 'remaining', 'what', 'past.For', 'found', 'see', 'Damon', 'Johansson', 'acting', 'most', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'found', 'quite', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'interactive', 'family', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'pick', 'family', 'picture', 'including', 'lots', 'fun', 'animals', 'situations', 'children', 'life', 'beginning', 'be', 'more', 'upswing']",N/A

It involves a man moving his family away from their home after the beloved wife and mother of the clan passed on.  Of all the kooky things, though wouldn't you know, the Mee family buys the farm.  Or, rather, the zoo.  And, as this zoo is on the verge of going boots up, they help turn it around and thus save the oddball cast of zoo workers and themselves and their fracturing psyches.  Directed with an eye toward sentimental angst and sap, Cameron Crowe at least knows how to pace this slow family simmer and avoid an overly cloying taste while still feeding us what turns out to be a cathartic and ultimately feel-good feature.The conceit of the film, a family buying a zoo, could be any child's fantasy and that's simply brilliant.  I would have certainly thought that to be one of the coolest things ever should I have been the child.  But if I were that child, would I have let the tiger pass on?  I don't know.

And Matt Damon is portraying one such person in this latest family effort from acclaimed writer/director Cameron Crowe.Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is an adventure columnist for a struggling newspaper, if that's not redundant, and father of two children. His wife recently passed away due to illness leaving him to raise those children on his own. His daughter Rosie (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is regularly losing sleep thanks to the hard-partying college students in the house next door. His son Dylan (played by Colin Ford) is a fourteen year-old artist who's developed a taste for the macabre of late and who has recently been expelled from school. Rather than keep his job at the paper, which he would've held onto despite their financial problems thanks to his editor's sympathy, Mee decides to sell his home and find more picturesque surroundings for him and his family. After rejecting several houses for being dull or dime-a-dozen, they find a home situated on the grounds of a struggling zoo and embark on their greatest adventure yet.It's cutesy, I'm not denying that. But while Zookeeper had nothing else going for it, this is entertaining and interesting and I enjoyed it very much thanks to Crowe's screenplay and direction, a typically interesting effort from Damon and an excellent supporting cast in Elle Fanning, Thomas Hayden Church and Scarlett Johansson.",4,"Not amazing, but good.",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1494,"['Life', 'adventure', 'A', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'true', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'portraying', 'one', 'such', 'person', 'latest', 'family', 'effort', 'acclaimed', 'writer/director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe.Benjamin', 'Mee', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'adventure', 'columnist', 'struggling', 'newspaper', 'not', 'redundant', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'wife', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'due', 'illness', 'leaving', 'raise', 'children', 'own', 'daughter', 'Rosie', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Jones', 'regularly', 'losing', 'sleep', 'thanks', 'hard-partying', 'college', 'students', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'son', 'Dylan', 'played', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'fourteen', 'year-old', 'artist', 'who', 'developed', 'taste', 'macabre', 'late', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'expelled', 'school', 'Rather', 'keep', 'job', 'paper', 'would', ""'ve"", 'held', 'financial', 'problems', 'thanks', 'editor', 'sympathy', 'Mee', 'sell', 'home', 'find', 'more', 'picturesque', 'surroundings', 'family', 'rejecting', 'several', 'houses', 'being', 'dull', 'dime-a-dozen', 'find', 'home', 'situated', 'grounds', 'struggling', 'zoo', 'embark', 'greatest', 'adventure', 'yet.It', 'cutesy', ""'m"", 'not', 'denying', 'Zookeeper', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'thanks', 'Crowe', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'typically', 'interesting', 'effort', 'Damon', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson']",N/A
1417306,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZW9W,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a recently widowed father of two, who, in order to restart his and his family's life, buys a Southern California house that comes with a small zoo (complete with animals and the staff). The incredible story is based on Mee's memoir published in 2008 (the events really happened in Devonshire, England).While Benjamin slowly gains the trust of the zoo staff led by the spirited head keeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), they have to overcome numerous obstacles including financial trouble, before the zoo's opening. The film's subplots include a romance between Benjamin's troubled son Dylan (Colin Ford) and a young girl Lily (Elle Fanning).Cameron Crowe's first feature film in six years (since disappointing ""Elizabethtown""), ""We Bought a Zoo"" marks a semi-comeback for Crowe, a uniquely talented director who has given us such films as ""Say Anything...,"" ""Jerry Maguire"" and, of course, autobiographical ""Almost Famous,"" which I think is his best.Adapted for screen by Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") and Crowe himself, ""We Bought a Zoo"" is not totally without familiar elements like Duncan, Benjamin's reluctantly helpful older brother (Thomas Haden Church), but despite its predictable storyline, ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a heart-warming comedy drama with nice soundtrack music.",4,"""We Bought a Zoo"": Almost There",1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,1322,"['Matt', 'Damon', 'Benjamin', 'Mee', 'recently', 'widowed', 'father', 'two', 'who', 'order', 'restart', 'family', 'life', 'Southern', 'California', 'house', 'small', 'zoo', 'complete', 'animals', 'staff', 'incredible', 'story', 'based', 'Mee', 'memoir', 'published', '2008', 'events', 'really', 'happened', 'Devonshire', 'England', '.While', 'Benjamin', 'slowly', 'gains', 'trust', 'zoo', 'staff', 'led', 'spirited', 'head', 'keeper', 'Kelly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'have', 'overcome', 'numerous', 'obstacles', 'including', 'financial', 'trouble', 'zoo', 'opening', 'film', 'subplots', 'include', 'romance', 'Benjamin', 'troubled', 'son', 'Dylan', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'young', 'girl', 'Lily', 'Elle', 'Fanning', '.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'six', 'years', 'disappointing', 'Elizabethtown', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'semi-comeback', 'Crowe', 'uniquely', 'talented', 'director', 'who', 'given', 'such', 'films', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'course', 'autobiographical', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'think', 'best.Adapted', 'screen', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Crowe', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'not', 'totally', 'familiar', 'elements', 'Duncan', 'Benjamin', 'reluctantly', 'helpful', 'older', 'brother', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'Bought', 'Zoo', 'heart-warming', 'comedy', 'drama', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'music']",N/A
