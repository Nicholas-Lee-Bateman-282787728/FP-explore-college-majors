That said, my personal attachment to my relative (who shall remain nameless for the purpose of this review) didn't add to my enjoyment of this movie in the slightest.Frankly, I'm still looking for a good reason why this movie was made. It was tied to a reality show that aired solely on E! (not exactly the best place to gain visibility). It was then aired on E! (sanitized) and released directly to DVD with very little promotion. After watching it, it's easy to see why the producers tried to forget about it. There are a few average performances (any truly good performances would have been prohibited by a brain-dead script), but for the most part, the ""actors"" noticably fake their way through their lines. Steven Hill and Jenna Lewis appear to at least try to make the most of their lead roles of Oliver and Kirsten, and Trish Schneider, while playing comatose for part of the time, seems to enjoy the villany of her murderous ghost (though so much of the plot involving her seems odd and even silly). But others in the film (particularly Johnny Fairplay and Ethan Zohn) are ludicrous in their attempts to feign acting ability.All things considered, ""The Scorned"" suffers from substandard acting and directing, has average production values (at best) and one of the worst scripts ever to make it to the screen. Again, that makes it hard to comprehend why it ever saw the light of day. If zero stars were a possibility, I'd seriously consider that, but I'd certainly never consider buying it.",1,"Hated it, and that's really saying something...",1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1592,"['should', 'qualify', 'review', 'saying', ""'m"", 'related', 'one', 'actors', 'Scorned', 'said', 'personal', 'attachment', 'relative', 'who', 'shall', 'remain', 'nameless', 'purpose', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'slightest.Frankly', ""'m"", 'still', 'looking', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'tied', 'reality', 'show', 'aired', 'solely', 'E', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'place', 'gain', 'visibility', 'was', 'then', 'aired', 'E', 'sanitized', 'released', 'directly', 'DVD', 'very', 'little', 'promotion', 'watching', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'producers', 'tried', 'forget', 'are', 'few', 'average', 'performances', 'truly', 'good', 'performances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prohibited', 'brain-dead', 'script', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'noticably', 'fake', 'way', 'lines', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Jenna', 'Lewis', 'appear', 'least', 'try', 'make', 'most', 'lead', 'roles', 'Oliver', 'Kirsten', 'Trish', 'Schneider', 'playing', 'comatose', 'part', 'time', 'enjoy', 'villany', 'murderous', 'ghost', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'involving', 'odd', 'even', 'silly', 'others', 'film', 'particularly', 'Johnny', 'Fairplay', 'Ethan', 'Zohn', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'attempts', 'feign', 'acting', 'ability.All', 'things', 'considered', 'Scorned', 'suffers', 'substandard', 'acting', 'directing', 'average', 'production', 'values', 'best', 'one', 'worst', 'scripts', 'ever', 'make', 'screen', 'Again', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'why', 'ever', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'zero', 'stars', 'were', 'possibility', ""'d"", 'seriously', 'consider', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'never', 'consider', 'buying']","Scorned, The 2006"

971959,A2G6GO4O7EVCPF,B000EDWLO6,Michael Bolts,"[2, 4]","I did see the show Kill Reality which aired last year from like August till September and then I waited for this to come out on DVD and here it is and it's BAD!! Basically it's about a woman (Trish Schneider) who finds her boyfriend (Bob Guiney) in bed with another chick (Trishelle Cannatella) and winds up in the hospital in a coma like state. Years later she is still in there and a new couple (Jenna Lewis and Steven Hill) have just moved into the old house. People start to die by the spirit of Trish because their all lying and cheating on the ones they love. What will happen? Well, if you wanna find out be my guest but I do not recommend this movie, it's not campy fun it's just utter stupidity. Rent Cube or something, at least that was more intelligent then this. Bad acting? Hell yes but there was Ethan Zohn who I thought was the best one out of the whole bunch. If you wanna skip the acting and just watch the nudity, well go right ahead I'm not stopping you. I hate reality TV but I watched Kill Reality to see what kind of movie they were making and gee willikers it was horrible. Mostly all the deaths are retarded and corny...I mean a f**king lava lamp! Plus the eyes appearing on the doors was down right idiotic. Also starring Jonny ""Fairplay"" Dalton, Reichen Lehmkuhl, Tonya Cooley, Toni Ferrari, Stacie Jones UpChurch anbd Jenna Morasca. The director appears (forgot his name, lame director anyway) appears as that ponytailed cop who calls Bob Guiney.

971960,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000EDWLO6,Tim Janson,"[5, 8]","The only way this film MIGHT be enjoyable is if these no talent, over-exposed reality ""stars"" really were killed.  Seriously...who came up with this idea and can we possibly have them deported?  Is someone really into reality TV that much that they care to see these people as (bad) actors?  I guess a few are...Anyway, a murder in a beach house leaves a woman named Raina dead with her throat cut.  She becomes a vengeful spirit who is out to kill unfaithful lovers.  Months later she finds a treasure trove as a whole group of people move in who are unfaithful to each other.  This list of stars includes Jenna Lewis, Jenna Morasca, Ethan Zohn, and Johnny Fairplay from ""Survivor"", Bob Guiney from ""The Bachelor"", Trishelle Cannatella, Tonya Cooley, and Steven Hill from ""The Real World"", Stacie Jones Upchurch from the Apprentice, Erika Landin from ""Big Brother"", and so on and so forth...There's also a boatload of cameos by other reality stars like Nikki McKibbin, Gervase Peterson, yadda yadda....It seems the main goal of the film was to stuff as many of these never-was-beens into a movie and if that was the goal then it was a success.  The film comes off as a fan-boy project.  It was written by another Survivor alum Rob Cesterino and Rob might want to look for another deserted island to move to because I don't think he'll have many people knocking on his door.Guiney who plays the beach houses landlord and Zohn actually don't come off to bad.  I suppose you could see them scratching out a living acting.  As for the rest, well they pretty much were very bad and I hope none of them took the film too seriously.",2,TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T REALLY DIE...,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1626,"['only', 'way', 'film', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'talent', 'over-exposed', 'reality', 'stars', 'really', 'were', 'killed', 'Seriously', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'can', 'possibly', 'have', 'deported', 'someone', 'really', 'reality', 'TV', 'much', 'care', 'see', 'people', 'bad', 'actors', 'guess', 'few', 'are', 'Anyway', 'murder', 'beach', 'house', 'woman', 'named', 'Raina', 'dead', 'throat', 'cut', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'who', 'out', 'kill', 'unfaithful', 'lovers', 'Months', 'later', 'treasure', 'trove', 'whole', 'group', 'people', 'move', 'who', 'are', 'unfaithful', 'other', 'list', 'stars', 'Jenna', 'Lewis', 'Jenna', 'Morasca', 'Ethan', 'Zohn', 'Johnny', 'Fairplay', 'Survivor', 'Bob', 'Guiney', 'Bachelor', 'Trishelle', 'Cannatella', 'Tonya', 'Cooley', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Real', 'World', 'Stacie', 'Jones', 'Upchurch', 'Apprentice', 'Erika', 'Landin', 'Big', 'Brother', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'also', 'boatload', 'cameos', 'other', 'reality', 'stars', 'Nikki', 'McKibbin', 'Gervase', 'Peterson', 'yadda', 'yadda', '.It', 'main', 'goal', 'film', 'was', 'stuff', 'many', 'never-was-beens', 'movie', 'was', 'goal', 'then', 'was', 'success', 'film', 'off', 'fan-boy', 'project', 'was', 'written', 'Survivor', 'alum', 'Rob', 'Cesterino', 'Rob', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'deserted', 'island', 'move', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'many', 'people', 'knocking', 'door.Guiney', 'who', 'beach', 'houses', 'landlord', 'Zohn', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'bad', 'suppose', 'could', 'see', 'scratching', 'out', 'living', 'acting', 'rest', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'were', 'very', 'bad', 'hope', 'none', 'took', 'film', 'too', 'seriously']","Scorned, The 2006"
