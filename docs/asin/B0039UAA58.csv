I was unfamiliar with the series of books this film is based upon, but had heard of them. If the novels are anything like the film I never need to read them. The largest problem with this film is that it's very disjointed and doesn't really make too much sense overall. The zombies are wasted. They are not scary and don't do much at all until the end when they suddenly attack for no real reason.

If you haven't read the books flip a coin.  You will or won't.  What I mean by this is that this covers the first book of the series and it sets everything up for the later books.  In a nutshell, almost everyone on the planet dies.  There are survivors that don't know what to do.  Several of the survivors that have banded together determine that it isn't safe where they are and leave.  You then follow the story of Carl, Emma and Mike.  This story isn't fast paced but it is very true to the story.  I liked the books and liked the movie.  It is nice when you can see things in the movie that happened in the book.  The scene with David Carradine is important in the series and is downplayed in the movie if I remember right.  Anyway, if you are a zombie fan, you may or may not like this movie.  I hope there are more of these movies so this movie does what it is supposed to do and set up the series, if not, it will be sad.

1333994,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0039UAA58,Compay,"[9, 14]","The positive Amazon reviews for Autumn were paid for, the negative ones voted down by people involved with the movie. It's voted 3/10 on IMDB by hundreds of voters, 'nuff said.As you probably know, most new zombie films aren't going to be as good as 28 Days Later. But Autumn is one of those movies that doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the 2002 Danny Boyle classic.The cinematography is uninspiring, the lighting is awful, and there doesn't seem to be any color correction. The sound quality is poor, the editing is terrible, and the use of slow motion during the action sequences is annoying. There are also inconsistencies like the story taking place in Canada, yet half of the survivors have British accents. Even if this wasn't a low-budget movie, there's one reason why this film will bore you: the zombies aren't scary.For most of the film, the zombies aren't dangerous. They mill around the town like bored cows, and the survivors casually walk past them. Even when the zombies become aggressive towards the end of the film, they're still not scary. The survivors only have to push them down and briskly jog away to escape. The only character that you actually see killed by a zombie has to stand still and allow them to do so.I've been a fan of lead actor Dexter Fletcher, ever since his work in Layer Cake as well as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He delivers a great performance, though it's not enough to save the film. I'm not sure how the budget allowed for the casting of David Carradine, but it's not surprising that he's in the movie for only a few minutes.It's funny that another reviewer describes it as a brilliant film deserving of five stars. Newsflash: real horror fans don't watch zombie movies for Oscar performances and deep philosophical themes. If the zombies aren't threatening, they aren't scary. Nobody wants to watch a zombie film that isn't suspenseful.This wasn't even worth a Redbox rental, I can't imagine why anyone would want to own a copy of the DVD.",1,Most Boring Zombie Movie Ever Made,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2023,"['positive', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Autumn', 'were', 'paid', 'negative', 'ones', 'voted', 'down', 'people', 'involved', 'movie', 'voted', '3/10', 'IMDB', 'hundreds', 'voters', 'said.As', 'probably', 'know', 'most', 'new', 'zombie', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Autumn', 'one', 'movies', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'sentence', '2002', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'classic.The', 'cinematography', 'uninspiring', 'lighting', 'awful', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'color', 'correction', 'sound', 'quality', 'poor', 'editing', 'terrible', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'action', 'sequences', 'annoying', 'are', 'also', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'Canada', 'yet', 'half', 'survivors', 'have', 'British', 'accents', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'low-budget', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'will', 'bore', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary.For', 'most', 'film', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'dangerous', 'mill', 'town', 'bored', 'cows', 'survivors', 'casually', 'walk', 'Even', 'when', 'zombies', 'become', 'aggressive', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'still', 'not', 'scary', 'survivors', 'only', 'have', 'push', 'down', 'briskly', 'jog', 'away', 'escape', 'only', 'character', 'actually', 'see', 'killed', 'zombie', 'stand', 'still', 'allow', 'do', 'so.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'lead', 'actor', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'ever', 'work', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'as', 'well', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'great', 'performance', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'budget', 'allowed', 'casting', 'David', 'Carradine', 'not', 'surprising', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'minutes.It', 'funny', 'reviewer', 'brilliant', 'film', 'deserving', 'five', 'stars', 'Newsflash', 'real', 'horror', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'threatening', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'Nobody', 'watch', 'zombie', 'film', ""n't"", 'suspenseful.This', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'Redbox', 'rental', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'copy', 'DVD']",Autumn

No doubt this is to build suspense. The problem is the suspense is built clear to the end of the movie meaning nothing really happens except a lot of talking and crying. After people wander amongst the zombies with no repercussions throughout, by the time something actually does happen one tends not to care. The character and animal you see killed in this movie, by being ripped apart, don't even scream. They just sink down as if going to sleep which is exactly what the viewer is tempted to do. That's right, character and animal, both singular tense. It's that much of a snoozer. Basically this movie resembles what would happen if you took a good zombie flick and edited out all the exciting parts. The result isn't completely horrible but fails at being entertaining. At the end one character is described as having grief larger than his zest for life. This is a perfect description of the film.

If you're a fan of whip-smart zombie movies (although the word is never used, come on, they're freaking zombies already, not ""meatcoats""), like28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)andPontypool, and you have more patience for nuance and sophistication than our young reviewer friend did, then ""Autumn"" is extremely rewarding.It's light on the scares and heavy on horror...the emotional, psychological horror of death and of the dead.  The way the dead start off inanimate, immobilized (as the dead should be) and gradually, gradually gain the characteristics of the zombies we know from the Romero oeuvre and his imitators is the masterstroke of the film, allowing tension to ratchet up slowly.  And for a low budget film, ""Autumn"" boasts some exquisite camera work that only fleetingly becomes so creative as to be annoying.Now don't misunderstand: ""Autumn"" is not ""Citizen Cane.""  It is a ZOMBIE movie, at its heart.  But even though it has many of the elements familiar to the genre, the approach is fresh, and the emphasis on psychology rather than mere viscera elevates ""Autumn"" well beyond what the genre usually produces.

I had read Autumn when it was posted on the web years ago and pretty much liked it... what I really liked was the fact that survivors were given a little bit of head start until the ""dead"" reanimated and began to hanker for a hunk of flesh! So, I disregarded all the negative feedback and found myself a copy of Autumn. Well, the movie was pretty close to what I remember reading, however I don't remember all the back and forth bitching and nagging and arguing that the characters did. Can't think of anything intelligent for your characters to talk about and add depth and development to them, just have them yell and argue with each other! This was a budget movie and it really showed, but that is no excuse cause I have seen some pretty good low budget zombie movies and some really crappy Hollywood big budget zombie movies.  What made Autumn such a bad movie for me was the fact that the filmmakers, who worked with David Moody, the writer of Autumn, in making this movie, didn't seem to take the time to develop a strong script. I think if they had done that, it might of help with some character development. There was almost no character development so I never really cared about any of the characters and never fully got into the movie.The acting was hit or miss, thankfully the 3 main actors were pretty good actors.  The actors had a thick British accent and it was hard at times to understand what they were saying / yelling at each other. I almost wish the movie had been filmed in the French speaking part of Canada so I could have watched the movie dubbed!  Zombie make-up was hit or miss, mostly on the miss side.The pacing was incredibly slow in the beginning and then seemed to rush throughout the remainder of the film. And the film jumped all around, I'm sure it was because they wanted to try and stay true to the story, and show the viewer what happened to the other characters that left the community center, but that just confused and frustrated me and I thought it was just a huge waste of film on characters that I didn`t care about and it didn`t add anything to the movie!To sum it all up, this was too much of an idea / story for the budget that they had.But on the plus side, this was not the worst zombie film I have ever seen...

It was very unique and creative.Before you believe the 1 star reviews...please understandYes this movie is slow...but that pace is used to build suspense...The Zombies don't show a need for human flesh...So what...Why can't a movie be appreciated for it's ORIGINALITY...?I will admit that if you want to be scared stupid this movie most likely won't do it.It is not filled with action scenes or loads of gore...The horror is more in the idea of facing death and the reanimated dead.This movie is begging for a sequel, because the zombies continue to evolve but never reach that ""Deadly"" status.The basic premise is a airborne virus spreads over the world and within hours only a select few ""IMMUNE"" people are left alive with everyone else dead where they fell. After a day or so about 3 dozen folk have gathered together wondering what to do now that everyone but them are dead.After another day or so the dead begin to get up a slowly, plodding around until they bump into something and they turn and mindlessly wander off in another direction. Despite the horror of seeing dead rise, they seem harmless.However 3 of the survivors take this as a sign to get the hell away from the city and the hundreds of thousand walkers.They spend the rest of the movie venturing of into the countryside and find a farm. But they have visitors there too.The rest of the movie is suspenseful horror as the dead begin to react to sound, get more aggressive etc. All the while the group of 3 shell up in the farmhouse and venture into towns to get supplies.This movie clocks in at about 2 hours so it has more time to develop character and dread. There is always the danger of the dead, but if you're looking for gore and gunfights this is not your movie. It is not an action movie or splatter fest but rather a realistic portrayal of what survival would be like if you were one of the last alive on earth.The makeup work on the dead is very realistic and superb...there is no CG or bad effects hereThere is even a 15 minute scenario where one of the three goes into a town and runs into a lonely man named Philip (played by David Carradine from Kung-fu and Kill Bill Fame) Philip however won't leave because his ""sick"" mum can't come along.For suspenseful Horror or Zombie fans tired of the paint by numbers gore fests that almost every Zombie film seems to follow...Please try this movie...It is truly great.",5,NOT a paint by the numbers Zombie Movie = Original,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,2423,"['Zombie', 'Film', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'creative.Before', 'believe', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'please', 'understandYes', 'movie', 'slow', 'pace', 'used', 'build', 'suspense', 'Zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'need', 'human', 'flesh', 'So', 'what', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'be', 'appreciated', 'ORIGINALITY', 'will', 'admit', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'stupid', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.It', 'not', 'filled', 'action', 'scenes', 'loads', 'gore', 'horror', 'more', 'idea', 'facing', 'death', 'reanimated', 'dead.This', 'movie', 'begging', 'sequel', 'zombies', 'continue', 'evolve', 'never', 'reach', 'Deadly', 'status.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'airborne', 'virus', 'spreads', 'world', 'hours', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'IMMUNE', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'alive', 'everyone', 'else', 'dead', 'where', 'fell', 'day', 'so', '3', 'dozen', 'folk', 'have', 'gathered', 'together', 'wondering', 'what', 'do', 'now', 'everyone', 'are', 'dead.After', 'day', 'so', 'dead', 'begin', 'get', 'up', 'slowly', 'plodding', 'around', 'bump', 'something', 'turn', 'mindlessly', 'wander', 'off', 'direction', 'horror', 'seeing', 'dead', 'rise', 'seem', 'harmless.However', '3', 'survivors', 'take', 'sign', 'get', 'hell', 'away', 'city', 'hundreds', 'thousand', 'walkers.They', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'venturing', 'countryside', 'find', 'farm', 'have', 'visitors', 'there', 'too.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'dead', 'begin', 'react', 'sound', 'get', 'more', 'aggressive', 'etc', 'group', '3', 'shell', 'up', 'farmhouse', 'venture', 'towns', 'get', 'supplies.This', 'movie', 'clocks', '2', 'hours', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'character', 'dread', 'always', 'danger', 'dead', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gore', 'gunfights', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'splatter', 'fest', 'rather', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'survival', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'one', 'last', 'alive', 'earth.The', 'makeup', 'work', 'dead', 'very', 'realistic', 'superb', 'CG', 'bad', 'effects', 'even', '15', 'minute', 'scenario', 'where', 'one', 'three', 'town', 'lonely', 'man', 'named', 'Philip', 'played', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Kung-fu', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Fame', 'Philip', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sick', 'mum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'along.For', 'suspenseful', 'Horror', 'Zombie', 'fans', 'tired', 'paint', 'numbers', 'gore', 'fests', 'almost', 'Zombie', 'film', 'follow', 'Please', 'try', 'movie', 'truly', 'great']",Autumn

So, I'm not going to compare the movie to the book(s) it was based on.On its own, this movie stands up pretty well. But don't expect post-28 Days Later hyper-zombies. These are closer to Romero's plodding, brainless zombies (though, by the end of the movie it's a bit of a middle ground between the two).The basic premise is that a plague strikes the world and nearly everyone dies. A few people weren't affected (either they never contracted the disease or were immune; it's not really stated and doesn't matter too much) and band together to try to keep humanity alive and/or ward off looters / vigilantes.Then the dead start moving again, it starts out slowly. Eyes open, bodies movie. Eventually they get up and wander about aimlessly. They slowly regain some of their senses and motor skills over the course of the movie, but are still zombies and ""have no pulse.""I think the movie was executed pretty well. It wasn't a big actioner, so don't go in expecting a super-fast thrill-ride with lots of explosions. There was some amount of chasing that went on toward the end of the movie. But, ultimately it was more of a slow-burn, ever-so-slightly atmospheric movie. In all, I thought it was pretty competently made and accomplished what it set out to do. Even if it wasn't a Planet Terror or Zombieland or Last of the Living...The David Carradine cameo was a little forced. But it was nice to see him in one of his last roles... Even if the character was a little ""off"" and didn't believe that his mother was dead. ""She's only sick...

Autumn focuses almost entirely on the humans. The zombies don't even pose a threat till sometime well into the second half. It's also a very low budget film with no great actors, make up, effects or action. Instead, this is an opportunity for a bunch of young film makers and actors to test their wings. I don't expect any of these young people to become household names, but this is still a decent effort. Better action would have made this a much more watchable movie, but I still liked it.

1334016,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0039UAA58,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[23, 25]","Autumn (Steven Rumbelow, 2009)It should be noted, first, that while David Moody's Autumn quartet has become a self-publishing success story (including netting Moody a publishing contract with St. Martin's, who are slowly re-releasing all his stuff) and singlehandedly sparked an explosion in small-press zombie literature, the books themselves aren't all that great. Yes, they're loads of fun, retool (if not reimagine) the zombie paradigm nicely, and ask a lot of interesting questions in a meta sort of way. But they're not terribly well-written. Still, great movies have been made from mediocre books (think The Silence of the Lambs here). So I held out some small hope that Steven Rumbelow would take the first book in the series and turn it into some sort of minor masterpiece. More fool me.Autumn is the story of a small group of survivors who are left behind by some sort of fast-acting plague that wipes out billions of people in the space of a few heartbeats. While the novel focuses on one band that gets together in a school building and then splits off into different groups, the movie, after paying token lip service to the school bit (five minutes or thereabouts, it's a much larger portion of the book), focuses on one splinter group from the original mass: Michael (Kick-Ass' Dexter Fletcher), Emma (Lana Kamenov in her first screen appearance), and Carl (British TV character actor Dickon Tolson; American audiences may remember him from a recurring role on the sitcom Growing Pains). There's tension in the group, as there was in the larger group, and it gets worse when the billions of corpses struck down by the disease get up and start walking around...This is, in many ways, the basis for every post-Romero zombie movie, though Moody, in his novels, was very interested in shifting things around to make it obvious he was questioning the conventions of the genre. (Most interestingly, perhaps, Moody's zombies do not crave human flesh.) Rumbelow, on the other hand, adapting Moody's novel, feels the need to high-five a number of zombie films, most notably Romero's original Dawn of the Dead. These two things do not necessarily have to live in exclusivity; Rumbelow's zombies don't eat people, either. But it's kind of synecdochic of the way this adaptation goes; wherever Moody zigs in the books, the movie zags, and we end up with a conventional zombie flick.Not that this would necessarily be a bad thing; conventional zombie films still have a lot of mileage in them, as recent movies like The Mad and Dance of the Dead showed nicely. And these days having no budget is no excuse to make a bad movie, either (think DeadBirds or Lockout as an example of a stellar microbudget release). So what is this creature I have before me? It's a movie where a pretty darned good cast was picked up (including David Carradine in a small but memorable role), put in front of the camera, and wasted. There are some decent performances here; both Carradine and Kamenov are at least competent, though the zombies are more animated than anyone else in the film. Problem is, those performances don't connect to anything. Sticking with the bigger-picture aspect of the book might have helped this a bit, but I think a lot of things were short-circuited by the seemingly minor changes Rumbelow made (for example, the zombie makeup, which is really good, but doesn't belong in this flick; when it's obvious that the zombies are zombies, some of the confusion scenes just plain don't make sense--including the climactic one). The end result is a confusing mess that could have been a really good movie, but is instead one to avoid. * ",2,I've been waiting for this movie for so long...,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,3639,"['Autumn', 'Steven', 'Rumbelow', '2009', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'first', 'David', 'Moody', 'Autumn', 'quartet', 'become', 'self-publishing', 'success', 'story', 'including', 'netting', 'Moody', 'publishing', 'contract', 'St.', 'Martin', 'who', 'are', 'slowly', 're-releasing', 'stuff', 'singlehandedly', 'sparked', 'explosion', 'small-press', 'zombie', 'literature', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'loads', 'fun', 'retool', 'not', 'reimagine', 'zombie', 'paradigm', 'nicely', 'ask', 'lot', 'interesting', 'questions', 'meta', 'sort', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'terribly', 'well-written', 'Still', 'great', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'mediocre', 'books', 'think', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'here', 'held', 'out', 'small', 'hope', 'Steven', 'Rumbelow', 'would', 'take', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'turn', 'sort', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'More', 'fool', 'me.Autumn', 'story', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'behind', 'sort', 'fast-acting', 'plague', 'out', 'billions', 'people', 'space', 'few', 'heartbeats', 'novel', 'focuses', 'one', 'band', 'together', 'school', 'building', 'then', 'splits', 'off', 'different', 'groups', 'movie', 'paying', 'token', 'lip', 'service', 'school', 'bit', 'five', 'minutes', 'thereabouts', 'much', 'larger', 'portion', 'book', 'one', 'splinter', 'group', 'original', 'mass', 'Michael', 'Kick-Ass', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'Emma', 'Lana', 'Kamenov', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Carl', 'British', 'TV', 'character', 'actor', 'Dickon', 'Tolson', 'American', 'audiences', 'may', 'remember', 'recurring', 'role', 'sitcom', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'tension', 'group', 'was', 'larger', 'group', 'worse', 'when', 'billions', 'corpses', 'struck', 'down', 'disease', 'get', 'up', 'start', 'walking', 'around', 'many', 'ways', 'basis', 'post-Romero', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Moody', 'novels', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'shifting', 'things', 'make', 'obvious', 'was', 'questioning', 'conventions', 'genre', 'Most', 'interestingly', 'perhaps', 'Moody', 'zombies', 'do', 'not', 'crave', 'human', 'flesh', 'Rumbelow', 'other', 'hand', 'adapting', 'Moody', 'novel', 'need', 'high-five', 'number', 'zombie', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'Romero', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'two', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'have', 'live', 'exclusivity', 'Rumbelow', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'people', 'either', 'kind', 'synecdochic', 'way', 'adaptation', 'wherever', 'Moody', 'books', 'movie', 'zags', 'end', 'up', 'conventional', 'zombie', 'flick.Not', 'would', 'necessarily', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'conventional', 'zombie', 'films', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'mileage', 'recent', 'movies', 'Mad', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'showed', 'nicely', 'days', 'having', 'budget', 'excuse', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'either', 'think', 'DeadBirds', 'Lockout', 'example', 'stellar', 'microbudget', 'release', 'what', 'creature', 'have', 'movie', 'where', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'cast', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'including', 'David', 'Carradine', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'put', 'front', 'camera', 'wasted', 'are', 'decent', 'performances', 'here', 'Carradine', 'Kamenov', 'are', 'least', 'competent', 'zombies', 'are', 'more', 'animated', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'Problem', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'anything', 'Sticking', 'bigger-picture', 'aspect', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'bit', 'think', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'short-circuited', 'seemingly', 'minor', 'changes', 'Rumbelow', 'made', 'example', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'really', 'good', ""n't"", 'belong', 'flick', 'when', 'obvious', 'zombies', 'are', 'zombies', 'confusion', 'just', 'plain', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'including', 'climactic', 'one', 'end', 'result', 'confusing', 'mess', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'instead', 'one', 'avoid', '*']",Autumn
