After a while viewers tend to drift away for a change. The producers react to this by changing the formula. If it doesn't increase the number of viewers the series will end. One change is to add or drop actors or characters to see if this increases viewers. There are few series that go over nine years without some type of changes. Other factors can affect a series. Actors may become unavailable, fashions change. This package has a symbolic black cover. Do these stories follow the path set in the earlier seasons? This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the 22 shows.Disc 1.Times Are Changing, Part 1.  Times Are Changing, Part 2.Welcome to Olesonville.

924984,A2ZS59R1GNT1JB,B000AA4KQ0,A. Grace,"[96, 107]","In the last season, we see more of the Carters and Wilders than the Ingallses.  You have to wonder why the writers did this; certainly there was a behind-the-scenes reason.  For some viewers, much of the show's charm is missing along with the Ingalls family, but it remains classic, family friendly TV with some truly great moments.  Nellie comes home to envious fireworks from Nancy (her face as she asks Caroline, ""Was I ever that bad?"" is priceless).  The Younger brothers are spoofed with a cheesy humor that is lost on children but makes the episode classic for probably many adults.  Jason Carter befriends a dying lady in maybe the best episode of the season.  Laura pens her first draft of Little House in the Big Woods, wins a writing contest, and concedes the prize when she realizes the publishers intend to change her story.  Isaiah Edwards is perhaps the most poignant character of this season, as he cares for and defends a circus ""wild boy"" (who later leaves town to live with his father) and falls in love only to decide that he's an ""old man"" and the girl's life will be better without him.Episode List, first aired September 1982-March 1983Times Are Changing (parts 1&2)Welcome To OlesonvilleRageLittle LouThe Wild Boy (parts 1&2)The Return of NellieThe Empire BuildersLoveAlden's DilemmaMarvin's GardenSins of the FathersThe Older BrothersOnce Upon a TimeHome Again (2-hour episode)A Child With No NameThe Last SummerFor the Love of BlancheMay I Have This DanceHello and Goodbye",4,The season not for everyone (but still classic!),1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,1497,"['last', 'season', 'see', 'more', 'Carters', 'Wilders', 'Ingallses', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'writers', 'did', 'certainly', 'was', 'behind-the-scenes', 'reason', 'viewers', 'much', 'show', 'charm', 'missing', 'along', 'Ingalls', 'family', 'classic', 'family', 'friendly', 'TV', 'truly', 'great', 'moments', 'Nellie', 'home', 'envious', 'fireworks', 'Nancy', 'face', 'Caroline', 'Was', 'ever', 'bad', 'priceless', 'Younger', 'brothers', 'are', 'spoofed', 'cheesy', 'humor', 'lost', 'children', 'episode', 'classic', 'probably', 'many', 'adults', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'dying', 'lady', 'maybe', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'Laura', 'first', 'draft', 'Little', 'House', 'Big', 'Woods', 'writing', 'contest', 'prize', 'when', 'publishers', 'intend', 'change', 'story', 'Isaiah', 'Edwards', 'perhaps', 'most', 'poignant', 'character', 'season', 'circus', 'wild', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'town', 'live', 'father', 'love', 'only', 'decide', 'old', 'man', 'girl', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'him.Episode', 'List', 'first', 'aired', 'September', '1982-March', '1983Times', 'Are', 'Changing', 'parts', '1', '2', 'Welcome', 'OlesonvilleRageLittle', 'LouThe', 'Wild', 'Boy', 'parts', '1', '2', 'Return', 'NellieThe', 'Empire', 'BuildersLoveAlden', 'DilemmaMarvin', 'GardenSins', 'FathersThe', 'Older', 'BrothersOnce', 'TimeHome', 'Again', '2-hour', 'episode', 'Child', 'No', 'NameThe', 'Last', 'SummerFor', 'Love', 'BlancheMay', 'Have', 'DanceHello', 'Goodbye']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 9

Charles and Caroline are gone, the Little House taken over by the Carters, but Laura and Almanzo are still there.  The stories are enthralling, family friendly, heartwarming, sad, funny...everything that Little House is famous for!!  This season does full justice to Michael Landon's legacy to Laura Ingalls Wilder and we have some great entertaining moments here.  My favorite episode is ""May I Have This Dance"" where a charming Willie Oleson comes of age and marries a sweet girl named Rachel.  The scene where he tells Mrs. Oleson off is priceless.  Its obvious he's becoming more and more like his father and not the annoying little pest he was when he was little.  Melissa Gilbert and Dean Butler more than hold their own as the true de-facto stars here, but the Carter family is very engaging and appealing.  Any true Little House fan will enjoy this season just as much as the others.  I now have my Little House collection complete and Season Nine is one of my favorites!

Then the cast changed, drastically. Charles and his family moved to the city and the little house saw a new family. The Wilder's took in their orphan-niece, Jenny; played by a very young 90210-star, Shannen Doherty. Even though Michael Landon wasn't in every ep, his spirit could be seen in every single show!This was the last season.

These movies are rarer in syndication since they're longer than an hour, however they are available for purchase,Little House on the Prairie - Special Edition Movie Boxed Set (Look Back to Yesterday / Bless All the Dear Children / The Last Farewell).

So she sets out to write her memoirs. For some reason, this ep doesn't show up too often on TV.Home Again (Part 1) 2/7/1983Home Again Part 1 & Part 2 are likely the very best eps of Season 9. It starts out with Charles (of course played by the legend, Michael Landon) at his new place of business. He is informed that his son, Albert (Matthew Laborteaux) was arrested for stealing. Charles is able to get the charges dropped. But he has to do something with his son. Albert is out of control. He has changed so much. What can Charles do to help him?

However, Albert is holding onto a dark secret that no one knows about.Home Again (Part 2) 2/7/1983At first Charles convinces himself that Albert is doing better in his new surroundings. However, eventually Doc Baker and Charles find out that Albert is addicted to morphine. Charles confronts his son. At first, Albert is indignant saying, ""why do you care?"" Charles tells him that he's his son and he loves him. So, Albert agrees to give up the morphine and the following day Charles gives Doc Baker the good news and apologizes for all the trouble that Albert has caused. As usual, Doc Baker tells Charles that no apology is necessary. That same day at school Albert goes berserk. He beats up the Carter boy and even clocks poor Miss Plumb in the face! Charles finally has to face that fact that his son has a serious addiction and they take to Edwards' cabin for a long retreat.A Child With No Name 2/14/1983Laura gives birth to a baby boy who tragically passes away soon after his birth. Laura blames her newborn baby's death on Doc Baker. When Rose comes down with an illness Doc Baker is able to save her life and Lauren sees the foolishness of her actions.For The Love Of Blanche 3/7/1983This is a really funny show. Mr. Edwards takes in Blanche. A cute little 3-year old orangutan!The Last Summer 2/21/1983Upset that he cannot get his mother a nice gift for her birthday, Jason takes a job working for an elderly woman who is dying. Ruthy Leland (Vera Miles) gives him a very lavish gift for his mother. Sarah's nose is a little out of joint when her son is spending so much time at Ruthy's home. Once it is revealed that Ruthy doesn't have much time left Sarah relents.May I Have This Dance? 3/14/1983A lot of changes take effect during this ep.

924997,ABAZFH25304ZG,B000AA4KQ0,John M Spangler,"[34, 37]","Landon's true last season was defintely Season 8 and he basically took over the story lines and directing duties for Season 9. His gray hair must have been the deciding factor! Just kidding. Karen Grassle (Mrs. Ingalls) is nowhere to be found, Carrie Ingalls, Mary, Adam Kendall... vanished...Landon (Mr. Ingalls) starts out in the opening episode and returns for a very ""morbid episode with Albert in the midlde of the season"" It must be said though although the most beloved character is gone, the charm and satisfaction of the show is still very much intact.  Landon's directing abilities certainly shine as the stories do not seem old and rehashed from past years.Season 9 is truly a ""New Beginning"" as the characters have certainly evolved, and there are newbies galore. Shannon Daughtery is an amazing little actor in this series as I couldn't believe it was her when I popped it in my DVD player. I think I liked her better as a little girl!  Isaiah Edwards, (Victor French) has once again became one of the main characters for the series and is with the season througout the stay. Laura and Almonzo are still around along with classics such as Nels, Harriet, Nancy and Wily, Willy Olesen, Dr. Baker and the Reverend Alden are still here. I think this is the last Season we get to enjoy the antics of Harriet (McGreggor) as I don't believe she reprises her role in Season 10.  The stories still seem (and manage) to touch the heart like they did in the earlier seasons and still draws tears to fans. How they can make a story about a strayed babboon in Walnut Grove and make it enjoyable is beyond me, but it's successful no matter how you cut it.The most gut wrenching and disturbing 2-part episode is with the return of Albert and Charles Ingalls.  It's the most morbid episode ever for the series and is almost to the point of being inappropriate for younger viewers. The moral is certainly ""drugs will ruin your life, so don't do drugs!"" Albert is addicted to Morphine, and the show puts you through his vomiting, convulsions, hallucinations, his severe withdrawl and the battle with his father to save his life. Can the great and powerful Charles Ingalls save him one last time? Great entertainment, allbeit a bit morbid.Fans of the series should still buy this, It's not the best season by any means, most of the classic characters are gone, but the show still manages to rock thanks to continued great storylines and fine acting. It's still one of the betters forms of entertainment that should be on everyone's shelf for years to come.",5,"Landon is gone, well almost...",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,2550,"['Landon', 'true', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'defintely', 'Season', '8', 'basically', 'took', 'over', 'story', 'lines', 'directing', 'duties', 'Season', '9', 'gray', 'hair', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'deciding', 'factor', 'Just', 'kidding', 'Karen', 'Grassle', 'Mrs.', 'Ingalls', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Carrie', 'Ingalls', 'Mary', 'Adam', 'Kendall', 'vanished', 'Landon', 'Mr.', 'Ingalls', 'out', 'opening', 'episode', 'returns', 'very', 'morbid', 'episode', 'Albert', 'midlde', 'season', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'beloved', 'character', 'gone', 'charm', 'satisfaction', 'show', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'intact', 'Landon', 'directing', 'certainly', 'shine', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'old', 'rehashed', 'past', 'years.Season', '9', 'truly', 'New', 'Beginning', 'characters', 'have', 'certainly', 'evolved', 'are', 'newbies', 'galore', 'Shannon', 'Daughtery', 'amazing', 'little', 'actor', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'think', 'liked', 'better', 'little', 'girl', 'Isaiah', 'Edwards', 'Victor', 'French', 'once', 'again', 'became', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'season', 'stay', 'Laura', 'Almonzo', 'are', 'still', 'classics', 'such', 'Nels', 'Harriet', 'Nancy', 'Wily', 'Willy', 'Olesen', 'Dr.', 'Baker', 'Reverend', 'Alden', 'are', 'still', 'here', 'think', 'last', 'Season', 'get', 'enjoy', 'antics', 'Harriet', 'McGreggor', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'role', 'Season', '10', 'stories', 'still', 'seem', 'manage', 'touch', 'heart', 'did', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'still', 'draws', 'tears', 'fans', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'story', 'strayed', 'babboon', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'successful', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'cut', 'it.The', 'most', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'disturbing', '2-part', 'episode', 'return', 'Albert', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'most', 'morbid', 'episode', 'ever', 'series', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'inappropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'moral', 'certainly', 'drugs', 'will', 'ruin', 'life', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'drugs', 'Albert', 'addicted', 'Morphine', 'show', 'vomiting', 'convulsions', 'hallucinations', 'severe', 'withdrawl', 'battle', 'father', 'save', 'life', 'Can', 'great', 'powerful', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'save', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'Great', 'entertainment', 'bit', 'morbid.Fans', 'series', 'should', 'still', 'buy', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'means', 'most', 'classic', 'characters', 'are', 'gone', 'show', 'still', 'rock', 'thanks', 'continued', 'great', 'storylines', 'fine', 'acting', 'still', 'one', 'betters', 'forms', 'entertainment', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'shelf', 'years', 'come']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 9

925006,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000AA4KQ0,MollyRK,"[0, 0]","When this 9th season debuted in 1983 with a shocking and disappointing decision to eliminate the Ingalls clan and relocate them to Burr Oak, Iowa, this year's premiere episode was undoubtedly a moment where some previously loyal audiences were lost. Others stuck with the current story and did their best to enjoy it for what it was, but for the most part, it was perceived as a weak, unsettling conclusion to a long-running, highly beloved television series.Not too many viewers will be quick to buy Charles as a man who leaves behind his farming lifestyle to become a store merchant and provide more stability for his wife and younger children, but regardless of that, Michael Landon opted for a bittersweet ending to the Ingalls story arc that established the series as lighthearted, pleasing television for a full eight years. In addition, not only did the Ingalls pack up their covered wagon and leave Walnut Grove for good, but they sold their little wooden house--which Charles built with his own hands back in Season 1--to a blacksmith, his wife, and their two young sons. That's right--from here on out, the Carter family entered the plot and joined what would soon become an ensemble cast of old and new characters.The good news is that Laura and her husband Almanzo remained in the mix, and Melissa Gilbert was catapulted to ""leading lady"" stardom. I must say, it is nice to see her blossom this year as a full-fledged, mature adult, not just a newlywed on the brink of womanhood that we saw in Seasons 7 and 8. Now, after being married for a couple years and enduring several harsh realities connected to marriage, Laura is a strong, credible character who cares for her family and allows us to see just how much she has grown since she was a buck-toothed, tomboyish 8-year-old in the pilot movie nearly a decade ago. Also, because her and Almanzo's baby daughter Rose was not school-aged and could not yet assume the role of an older child on the show, Laura and Almanzo needed an older child to care for as they established themselves as the kind of loving, guiding parents that Charles and Caroline Ingalls were in years past. For that purpose, in comes Jenny Wilder, a bright-eyed, cheery 10-year-old who comes to live with her aunt and uncle in the wake of her widowed father Royal's tragic death. (And yes, folks, Royal Wilder appeared previously with his scatterbrained wife and two sons in Season 7, but Michael Landon had a new plan in mind by the time this season came around, and preserving continuity meant absolutely nothing to him as he completely rewrote Royal's story for the sake of convenience.) Played by a very young Shannen Doherty (whose Lindsay Lohan-type behavior in her teen years is well recognized by those who keep up with the tabloids), Jenny is a surprisingly effective asset to the series. Sweet, genuine, and widely effervescent, nothing about Doherty's acting is artificial as she develops the character in her own unique way. Some may say that Jenny was a poor substitute for the long-gone image of Laura as a child, but I don't think so. Say what you want about her, but she had some real talent as a little girl, and it's easy to see how she made it into the business in the first place. She was a good choice in the casting department, and episodes like ""Times are Changing"" and ""Marvin's Gardens"" are a nice showcase for what the girl was able to do at 11 years old.Then comes the slew of familiar and unfamiliar faces of ""Little House,"" where nobody is really the ""star"" of the show, but again, it is more like an illustration of the community that is Walnut Grove. Nels and Harriet Oleson continue along with their virtually unforgettable roles, and with Willie turning into a young man and Nancy wreaking havoc every chance she gets, these parents have a lot to help keep them on their toes (and even their beloved Nellie returns for one episode)! Mr. Edwards steps up to keep a protecting eye on Laura in her own Pa's absence, and as he becomes a father figure to several people in town, he adopts a child named Matthew and must learn how to avoid compensating with alcohol and reclusion when things don't go exactly as planned.Michael Landon's daughter Leslie portrays the young woman who replaces homemaker Laura as the new teacher of Walnut Grove, and Reverend Alden and Doc Baker continue to add their same memorable touch to each episode. And of course, the Carters assume residence in the Ingalls' old house and round out the new cast. Seeing them in the house is a noticeable difference, to be sure, but setting obvious grievances aside, there is plenty to like about this family. They soon became some of my very favorite characters in this season, if not the entire series, and I only wish we could have seen a little bit more of them. Young parents John and Sarah are a loving couple with enough charm to carry any plot that they are given, and while newspaper editor Sarah is relatively underdeveloped, blacksmith John Carter projects a sincerity and consciousness of what is right, making him a welcome addition as a leading male character. If you think he's just a cheap imitation of Charles Ingalls, think again: John has a much calmer and quieter presence than Charles, and while Charles undoubtedly never held back in throwing a defensive punch when necessary, John is more the type who looks for the good and keeps himself as collected as possible in various situations. As for their sons Jeb and Jason, they are cute kids who don't necessarily have to be viewed as ""male versions of Laura and Mary"" (you'd be surprised at what some hard-core fans came up with once the Ingalls were written out of the show). Jeb is mostly just average, but little Jason, played by David Friedman, is probably the sweetest breath of fresh air in the newfound image of this season, and as the Carters became more recognized in the plot, Jason quickly became the ""go-to kid"" for several moments of comic relief (as you may have already guessed, I am talking about the darker episodes that Michael Landon did not shy away from, particularly in the show's later years). ""The Last Summer,"" which paired Friedman with seasoned actress Vera Miles, was a standout episode that will require some Kleenexes, and for being so young, Friedman really delivered as a kid with the ability to make you smile every time he was on-screen. It's too bad he retired from the acting business at age 12, just a few years later, because he could have continued to be a fine young actor.There is no doubt that Season 9 is different from what you saw in Seasons 1-8, but I have to believe that once you get used to the change, you will like it for what it is. Those first eight seasons are available on DVD to watch and enjoy anytime you want, but Season 9 also has a quality that is all its own, and I feel it deserves to be appreciated for that. Humor, poignancy, and occasionally dark episodes represent a classic ""mixed bag"" in this 22-episode collection. Charles Ingalls returns for three episodes, two of which also feature Albert, whose recent problems with shoplifting and morphine present Charles with one of the most horrifying challenges a father can possibly face. I guess you can say that raising adolescent children is always tough, even way back in the pioneer days.All in all, this is certainly something worth buying to top off your ""Little House"" collection, and the DVD includes a bonus booklet that, in itself, is absolutely worth the entire purchase. Written by Little House series expert Patrick Laboutiere, it contains numerous cast photos, current pictures of several cast members, and information about practically every actor and actress on the show that you can think of, whether their roles were large or minor. It's a terrific resource that will surely provide you with some ""Little House"" trivia that you may never have known about before, so if you're a big fan, don't miss out on owning this. The tone is different in some ways, but the emphasis on the community of Walnut Grove reigns supreme, and you can bet that this was an integral part of what made the show so successful in the first place.",5,the spirit of community takes over in this controversial final season,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,8157,"['When', '9th', 'season', 'debuted', '1983', 'shocking', 'disappointing', 'decision',

The producers planned to end it in Season 8, but popular demand opened it for another season.Having another hard winter, Charles Ingalls has finally decided to give up on farming.  He sold the little house and moved is family to Iowa (sound familiar?)  To replace the departing Ingalls' family, John and Sarah Carter buy the house along with their two sons, Jeb and Jason.  But nobody can replace the Ingalls'.  The family was nice enough, but they didn't get the ratings Charles and Caroline got.Laura and Almanzo became the main characters.  Laura was out-spoken and hyper like her father.  The writer's made Almanzo almost speachless until near the end of the season.

However, while this is Alison's final appearance as Nellie, she has a cameo as a phone operator in the series finale, ""The Last Farewell.""
