341565,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302864518,Byron Kolln,"[23, 24]","WHERE ANGELS GO, TROUBLE FOLLOWS (1968) is the sequel to the 1966 surprise hit ""The Trouble with Angels"", updating the lives of the nuns of St. Francis Academy and their lively pupils.When free-thinking Sister George (Stella Stevens) plans for the girls to attend a youth rally on the other side of the country, first she must convince staunch Reverend Mother (Rosalind Russell) and the rest of the sisters.  During their long bus-trip, Sister George gradually wins the admiration of the Reverend Mother, whilst troublesome students Marvel-Ann (Barbara Hunter) and Rosabelle (Susan Saint James) weave their own brand of hijinks...While it succeeds in reviving the characters of ""The Trouble with Angels"", WHERE ANGELS GO... pales in comparison with it's predecessor.  It lacks a certain sense of innocence; which might be due to the radically shifting political and social climates in which it was filmed.  In one tense scene, the bus-party is terrorised by a gang of knife-wielding bikers...a far cry from the quiet charms of Hayley Mills & Co. from the first movie.Barbara Hunter and Susan Saint James don't carry the youthful side of the cast terribly well, but they deliver solid work.  It's always a pleasure seeing Rosalind Russell, and her slyly comic Reverend Mother is a joy.  Stella Stevens takes a while to settle into her role of progressive Sister George, but she's a luminous presence.The DVD is unfortunately in ""Pan & Scan"", but that shouldn't stop people from enjoying this cute comedy.

The rest was rather hokey jokes, but they played well here. Alot of this showed that the church was changing not just in the Catholic Church, but also the Protestant faith as well and also the Jewish faith. People were starting to wake up, or so they thought. When in reality the opinions and thoughts that were expressed in this movie were there all along, and this is shown in the acting chemistry between Sister George(Stella Stevens), and Mother Simplica(Rosalind Russell). Middle towards the end of the movie the generations between these two would clash, and the Mother seems to be gravitating towards what Sister George was trying to accomplish, and Sister George is starting to show her practicality. I can understand why Sister George was trying to become more practical, but at the same time I can also understand the Mother's change of heart as well. It's like the parable that Jesus told everyone about the 2 sons whose father asked them to do a task the one said ""NO"", and the other said he would. However, the one son who said no came back, and later did the task. Mother and Sister here both are showing what the one son did of course there's no need to write about the other one, but he ended up not doing the task. Therefore there's no need to bring him up.

Stevens was terribly miscast (against type) and gives a tedious performance.About the only scene that made me laugh was when the sisters and the students, of St. Francis Academy, were on a cross-country journey driving in a raggedy old bus when they got stuck on some railroad tracks. The sister that was driving the bus was gunning it, attempting to move the bus off the tracks before it got slammed by an oncoming train. The camera keeps switching between the frightened-as-hell look on the sister's face and her beat-up, white tennis shoe pumping the acceleration pedal. Somehow or another that scene always gets a big laugh out of me.At any rate, I'm glad they didn't bring back Hayley Mills (who starred in the original) for this sequel. Actually, Mills passed on it; she wasn't too thrilled with the script.With or without Mills, the film wouldn't have worked. The script just wasn't there.No matter whether you liked this sequel or not, don't forget to check out the original, The Trouble with Angels, if you haven't seen it yet. It's a bit of a classic.

341582,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,6302864518,Joe Sherry,"[10, 11]","""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" is a sequel, of sorts, to 1966's charming ""The Trouble With Angels"".  This sequel stays with the nuns of St. Francis and their school for girls.  This time there is a spirited young nun named Sister George (Stella Stevens) who manages to talk the bishop into allowing a trip across the country to California to join into a big protest rally.  This is the 1960's, you see, and the church is taking a more activist role and trying to get involved in society.  Mother Superior (Rosalind Russell) disapproves, of course, but when the bishop speaks she has to obey.  ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" is a movie dealing with this trip across the country.There are several returning characters from ""The Trouble With Angels"" in this movie, but ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" is less a sequel than an entirely different movie with a couple of common characters.  Mother Superior and several of the nuns have returned, as have Mary Clancy's incredibly annoying cousin Marvel Ann (Barbara Hunter).  This time Marvel Ann is a much more sympathetic character and something of a trouble maker with her friend Rosabelle (Susan St. James).  This is a huge change for the character.The point of this movie seems to be less about the students, or even the nuns, but the assorted misadventures they get into travelling by bus across the country.  The rally is even beside the point.  Unfortunately ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" is missing so much of the charm that made ""The Trouble With Angels"" such a wonderful movie.  This one isn't really bad, but it suffers greatly in comparison to a vastly superior movie about a spoiled kid and the lessons of faith that can be found even when one isn't looking for it.  In this movie faith is almost besides the point and the characters didn't have to be nuns or students in a religious school.  They could have been anyone on a cross country trip.  That's a shame.""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" did not drag at all, but it just didn't live up to ""The Trouble With Angels"".  It does stand well enough on its own, and Rosalind Russell is always a treat, but this isn't something that I can recommend, especially to fans of ""The Trouble With Angels.""",3,Disappointing compared to The Trouble With Angels,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2222,"['Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', 'sequel', 'sorts', '1966', 'charming', 'Trouble', 'Angels', 'sequel', 'nuns', 'St.', 'Francis', 'school', 'girls', 'time', 'spirited', 'young', 'nun', 'named', 'Sister', 'George', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'who', 'talk', 'bishop', 'allowing', 'trip', 'country', 'California', 'join', 'big', 'protest', 'rally', '1960', 'see', 'church', 'taking', 'more', 'activist', 'role', 'trying', 'get', 'involved', 'society', 'Superior', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'course', 'when', 'bishop', 'obey', 'Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', 'movie', 'dealing', 'trip', 'country.There', 'are', 'several', 'returning', 'characters', 'Trouble', 'Angels', 'movie', 'Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', 'less', 'sequel', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'couple', 'common', 'characters', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'several', 'nuns', 'have', 'returned', 'have', 'Mary', 'Clancy', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'cousin', 'Marvel', 'Ann', 'Barbara', 'Hunter', 'time', 'Marvel', 'Ann', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'something', 'trouble', 'maker', 'friend', 'Rosabelle', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'huge', 'change', 'character.The', 'point', 'movie', 'be', 'less', 'students', 'even', 'nuns', 'assorted', 'misadventures', 'get', 'travelling', 'bus', 'country', 'rally', 'even', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', 'missing', 'so', 'much', 'charm', 'made', 'Trouble', 'Angels', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'greatly', 'comparison', 'vastly', 'superior', 'movie', 'spoiled', 'kid', 'lessons', 'faith', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'even', 'when', 'one', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'faith', 'almost', 'point', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'nuns', 'students', 'religious', 'school', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anyone', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'shame', 'Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Trouble', 'Angels', 'stand', 'well', 'enough', 'own', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'always', 'treat', ""n't"", 'something', 'can', 'recommend', 'especially', 'fans', 'Trouble', 'Angels']",N/A

Being a fan of ""The Trouble with Angels,"" I was intrigued by the notion that someone had made a thitherto-unknown-to-me sequel to it; however, watching it was a disappointing experience to say the least. Rosalind Russell reprises her role as Mother Superior, and--in contrast with the first movie--is easily the most sympathetic character in the film. The activist nun, Sister George (played by Stella Stevens), comes off as a caustic, spoiled little brat, as does Susan St. James's Rosabelle character. Marvel Ann (again played by Barbara Hunter) inspires less antipathy this time around, but only because she was such a curmudgeon in the first movie. Finally, the bit players brought in to lend the film more star power (e.g., Arthur Godfrey, Van Johnson, and Milton Berle) are given painfully stupid roles.Thus there are no memorable characters, and the basic premise of the movie--the St. Francis girls' hitting the road to participate in a youth rally of some kind--is eminently forgettable. Even the theme song, penned by Boyce and Hart and sung poorly by other people, is extremely annoying.I will say, however, that it's interesting to see what Hollywood thought was ""hip"" or ""with it"" in 1968.

Sister George (Stella Stevens), a young teacher at St. Francis Academy, encourages her students to join her in sign-carrying and chanting, much to the concern of the Mother Superior (Rosalind Russell).  When the sisters take a busload of girls across country to attend a peace rally in California, chaos reigns as they encounter endless car troubles, lots of boys, and even some cowboys and Indians.This sequel to ""The Trouble With Angels"" is a really bad movie.  The original had a funny script, spunky Hayley Mills, and the charisma and energy of Rosalind Russell.  This time around, the plot is ludicrous, Stella Stevens' hip-nun act gets old after five minutes, and poor Miss Russell just looks tired and worn-out.  There are awkward cameos by Van Johnson, Arthur Godfrey, Milton Berle, and Robert Taylor but they do have the good taste to look embarrassed.  None of the students' characters are developed (even though a very young and cute Susan Saint James shows promise) so we don't care about them.  All of the boys and most of the girl students were played by non-professionals who can't act.  And the worst part is *SPOILER* - after suffering through every possible road trip clich&eacute; - there's no California and no rally.Ever-dependable Mary Wickes reprises her role as a quirky nun from the first movie and she's always watchable, but when an Indian war party attacked the bus in New Mexico, I rolled my eyes in disbelief.

341595,A1Z0LLO7WEKMUW,6302864518,"Randle Rector ""Randy""","[1, 1]","If you read most of the reviews on here you will soon notice that ""Where Angels Go... Trouble Follows"" is one of those movies that people either love or hate.  If you enjoyed the original ""The Trouble With Angels"" (as I did) and expect this sequal to be more of the same, you will be greatly disappointed. I was initially, but I soon fell in love with its own unique charm. I would characterize ""The Trouble With Angels"" as basically a serious movie with comedy elements, and this movie as a comedy with serious elements. It's also a road trip movie, so it's much more episodic than the original. That makes it seem more shallow, but I look at it this way:  The breadth of life experiences cannot be encompassed in one movie, so this movie shows the nuns and the girls having different kinds of experiences than they had in the original.  To quote a character from the movie ""A Summer Place"", some of the best things in life are shallow! Most of the time here it is just plain uncomplicated fun.Some have criticized this film for portraying Mary Clancy's cousin Marvel Ann as a more sympathetic character than the obnoxious brat she was in ""The Trouble With Angels"". But again, we are seeing a broader view of life, because in this film we learn that Marvel Ann has issues with self-rejection, and isn't it true that rude and obnoxious people are often actually hurting inside? And she didn't graduate at the same time as Mary Clancy, so there may be a story behind that, too.This is not a great movie, just a fun movie.  It does explore some of the serious issues that were on people's minds in the late '60s, and presents them in a hip and groovy vibe which may seem corny today.  But that's how it was in the late '60s, so put yourself in the frame of mind to watch it with late '60s eyes.
