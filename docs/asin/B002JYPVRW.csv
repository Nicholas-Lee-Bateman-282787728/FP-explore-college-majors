1273405,A1248JRIINWRTH,B002JYPVRW,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[11, 11]","Andy Barker, P.I., was a short-lived NBC comedy created by Conan O'Brien. I don't care for O'Brien's humor and was surprised at how much I liked this show. There were so many laugh-out-loud moments packed into the 6 episodes, it was better than a night of comedies in Prime Time. There is a dry, quick humor that you have listen to closely so you don't miss anything. If you watch the episodes a second time, I guarantee you will hear/see something different, but equally hilarious.Andy Richter is spot on with his comedic delivery, as are all of the supporting characters of this sharp, funny series. I just wish there were more episodes. I would even watch it online if it were revived.If you only watch one episode, watch the one about the chickens.Note: There are only six episodes of the show in this DVD set - all that were created. The series was canceled very quickly for low ratings. What some forget is that NBC released ALL of the episodes online before running them in Prime Time.",5,"Surprisingly witty, fun show",1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,992,"['Andy', 'Barker', 'P.I.', 'was', 'short-lived', 'NBC', 'comedy', 'created', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""O'Brien"", 'humor', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'show', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'packed', '6', 'episodes', 'was', 'better', 'night', 'comedies', 'Prime', 'Time', 'dry', 'quick', 'humor', 'have', 'listen', 'closely', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'watch', 'episodes', 'second', 'time', 'guarantee', 'will', 'hear/see', 'something', 'different', 'equally', 'hilarious.Andy', 'Richter', 'spot', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'sharp', 'funny', 'series', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'would', 'even', 'watch', 'were', 'revived.If', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'watch', 'one', 'chickens.Note', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'show', 'DVD', 'set', 'were', 'created', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'very', 'quickly', 'low', 'ratings', 'What', 'forget', 'NBC', 'released', 'episodes', 'online', 'running', 'Prime', 'Time']",N/A

1273407,A3PFKE8EFXAXQE,B002JYPVRW,"cornbreadthedog ""larue""","[1, 2]","I really loved the first episode of this series! I was laughing and having a great time! Unfortunately, the other five episodes don't seem to keep up the tone and the pace of the pilot episode.In the first episode, Andy Richter shines when it's just him doing the P.I. work by himself. It was cool and funny, at the same time, to see a sweet mannered and loveable accountant clumsily do battle with and to totally outwit the bad guys! It was truly fantastic and exceptionally interesting to see how Andy Richter's character seemed to have a natural skill and an inborn gift for detective work. I dunno, the first episode had a nice kind of a Barney Fiffe/McGuyver/Get Smart vibe to it.Now, that's where the show should've stayed! Unfortunately, as the series progresses, we kind of lose Andy's character behind the wall of supporting characters of the show. In, my opinion, they had way too much screen time. Wally,the video store guy, Andy's mousy and ""un-hot"" wife, and Andy's predecessor in the detective business should've had only cameo appearances, no more than 60 seconds of screen time each, just enough time to help Andy's character out a bit whenever he got stuck on a case or needed some extra info to crack the case.I groaned and shook my head every time that the supporting characters over-stayed their welcome and kind of hogged the show away from Andy Richter's funny but bumbling detective/accountant. A lot of times, they weren't even all that funny.I'm so in love with the first episode only! The rest of the five episodes on this DVD set just feels like casual acquaintances.",3,OUTSTANDING FIRST EPISODE BUT IT ALL GOES DOWNHILL FROM THERE!,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1594,"['really', 'loved', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'laughing', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'five', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'up', 'tone', 'pace', 'pilot', 'first', 'episode', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'shines', 'when', 'just', 'doing', 'P.I', 'work', 'was', 'cool', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'sweet', 'mannered', 'loveable', 'accountant', 'clumsily', 'do', 'battle', 'totally', 'outwit', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'exceptionally', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'natural', 'skill', 'inborn', 'gift', 'detective', 'work', 'dunno', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'nice', 'kind', 'Barney', 'Fiffe/McGuyver/Get', 'Smart', 'vibe', 'it.Now', 'where', 'show', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'kind', 'lose', 'Andy', 'character', 'wall', 'supporting', 'characters', 'show', 'opinion', 'had', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Wally', 'video', 'store', 'guy', 'Andy', 'mousy', 'un-hot', 'wife', 'Andy', 'predecessor', 'detective', 'business', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'only', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'more', '60', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'help', 'Andy', 'character', 'bit', 'whenever', 'got', 'stuck', 'case', 'needed', 'extra', 'info', 'crack', 'case.I', 'groaned', 'shook', 'head', 'time', 'supporting', 'characters', 'over-stayed', 'welcome', 'kind', 'hogged', 'show', 'away', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'funny', 'bumbling', 'detective/accountant', 'lot', 'times', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'love', 'first', 'episode', 'only', 'rest', 'five', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'feels', 'casual', 'acquaintances']",N/A

The run was only six shows before NBC canceled it - as usual, the bottom line spoke and the network didn't give it a chance to find its audience. I was surprised to see it released on DVD, given the truncated run it had, but I snapped it up immediately. Watching it again, I could only wonder at where it would have gone had it been given a chance.

1273410,A2UTKYA2U8542F,B002JYPVRW,Steve Reina,"[4, 4]","While this show may only have six episodes, each episode is hilarilously funny.So if you think of the purchase price in terms of the number of times you actually laugh out loud, you'll actually find this DVD to be a better buy than some regular purchases.  (In any event, the total running time exceeds three hours anyway so in comparison, to say, a DVD of a comedy movie, you especially come out ahead on the deal.)For its entertainment value, take the first episode, for instance, where we meet Andy Barker, an accountant ready to open his new CPA office at a strip mall (funny stuff, eh?).  Played by Andy Richter, Barker is just funny sitting still.  But no sooner than the first scene at his new office, he stands up and gets even funnier when a mysterous blond comes to him seeking PI work.Before he gets to explain that he's just an accountant (or is he?), he gets four thousand dollars pushed into his hands with a mission to find the woman's husband (or is he?).So as not to spoil the plot, let's just say that Andy spends the rest of the show proving that if you make enough wrong steps, you can actually end up going in the right direction again.As you watch other episodes, you meet other quirky and fun characters from the Barker universe including a morbidly obese man who's death breaks the hearts of a shocking number of women, an evil chicken cartel, and a doctor (played by that guy who never ages from Lost) who's main practice consists of romancing young wives out of their husbands' fortunes.It's pretty funny stuff and while I certainly would've been happier if they'd run and sold more episodes, I'm at least glad we've got these ones to watch, and re-watch and re-watch.",5,"Only six episodes, but more than a million laughs",1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1694,"['show', 'may', 'only', 'have', 'six', 'episodes', 'episode', 'hilarilously', 'funny.So', 'think', 'purchase', 'price', 'terms', 'number', 'times', 'actually', 'out', 'loud', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'find', 'DVD', 'be', 'better', 'buy', 'regular', 'purchases', 'event', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'three', 'hours', 'anyway', 'so', 'comparison', 'say', 'DVD', 'comedy', 'movie', 'especially', 'come', 'out', 'ahead', 'deal', 'entertainment', 'value', 'take', 'first', 'episode', 'instance', 'where', 'meet', 'Andy', 'Barker', 'accountant', 'ready', 'open', 'new', 'CPA', 'office', 'strip', 'mall', 'funny', 'stuff', 'eh', 'Played', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'Barker', 'just', 'funny', 'sitting', 'still', 'sooner', 'first', 'scene', 'new', 'office', 'up', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'mysterous', 'blond', 'seeking', 'PI', 'explain', 'just', 'accountant', 'four', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'pushed', 'hands', 'mission', 'find', 'woman', 'husband', '.So', 'not', 'spoil', 'plot', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Andy', 'rest', 'show', 'proving', 'make', 'enough', 'wrong', 'steps', 'can', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'right', 'direction', 'watch', 'other', 'episodes', 'meet', 'other', 'quirky', 'fun', 'characters', 'Barker', 'universe', 'including', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'man', 'who', 'death', 'hearts', 'shocking', 'number', 'women', 'evil', 'chicken', 'cartel', 'doctor', 'played', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'Lost', 'who', 'main', 'practice', 'romancing', 'young', 'wives', 'husbands', 'fortunes.It', 'pretty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'certainly', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'happier', ""'d"", 'run', 'sold', 'more', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'least', 'glad', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ones', 'watch', 're-watch', 're-watch']",N/A
