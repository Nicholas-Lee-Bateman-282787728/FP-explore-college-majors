1437346,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0051T46DW,Brian Maitland,"[3, 8]","If you enjoy watching people walk, this is the movie for you. There are numerous long takes of no dialogue at all of an undercover cop following a possible extremely minor drug dealer in a small Romanian town.On the back of the DVD box the writeup calls the movie a ""masterpiece,"" but maybe they meant like a masterpiece painting that just hangs there in a museum and does nothing, that's pretty much what this movie does. It tries to play up the fact that words have meanings that vary from the dictionary definition in real life. How profound! I don't need a glacially paced crime drama to tell me that.Maybe Romanians have far greater patience than Westerners when it comes to storytelling on screen but basically this police procedural is as boring as pretty much any particular day would be for an undercover cop who has to tail a suspect and that suspect does nothing out of the norm.The DVD itself has just the trailer as an extra but it does have a booklet that has an interview with the director so you can get at what he was trying to say with this movie. Personally, I think he failed as the thing plods so slowly, you can literally disappear for 20 minutes on end and come back to find...oh, yes, more of nothing has happened and you have not really missed a single thing. I know there will be ""fillum"" students and critics who will disagree with me completely and that I missed the nuances of this Romanian director's ""masterpiece,"" but masterpieces should not put viewers to sleep.

1437347,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0051T46DW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","In the stunningly realistic Romanian film ""Police, Adjective,"" we get an unadulterated view of mundane beat work and bureaucratic apathy.  This is a true police procedural where not everything is a grand case waiting to be broken open.  It may be a hard sell, however, for some audiences (especially if they are expecting a more conventional cop film) as almost NOTHING happens in the entire movie.  Enormous sections are static and without dialogue and the most excruciatingly uncomfortable dramatic scene features reading the dictionary.  Sounds awful and boring, huh?  I know.  And yet, I absolutely loved this movie--a thrillingly original piece that defies every expectation.  I was so impressed after the concluding scene that I immediately went and looked this title up (I caught it on a whim, not knowing anything about it) and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had actually been awarded the prestigious Un Certain Regard Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.The plot is strikingly simple.  A young cop (the impressive Dragos Bucur) is assigned to tail a high school student who is suspected of dealing drugs.  Most of the movie highlights an isolated Bucur as he watches his target from afar.  There is clearly no evidence of dealing, the kid shares an occasional marijuana cigarette with his after school friends but is doing nothing of a nefarious nature.  Pushed to make a case, Bucur is resistant.  He believes that marijuana will soon be legalized and busting this kid would ruin his life to no purpose.  On his own initiative, he attempts to divert attention to more worthy targets but encounters apathy, procedure, and indifference every step of the way.  The frustration is palpable as there exist no way to personalize the decidedly institutional department.Again, for a movie whose tension exists in processing reports and stalking alley ways, I found ""Police, Adjective"" to be a highly engaging and believable piece.  I'm sure some people will be turned off by the film's stillness and quiet, but it is highly effective in creating the mood.  The message and ideological thoughts of the film are expressed as much by the silence as by what is said.  And if you're confused by the title, its relevance plays out in an extremely uncomfortable scene where Bucur's boss uses a dictionary to humiliate him.  It is an incredibly surprising, unusual, literate, and powerful scene.  Ultimately, Bucur's idealism and clinging hope that he can make a small difference must stand up to a system that just doesn't care.  As the film maintains its sense of realism, the ending just fits so perfectly with everything that precedes it.  Unexpectedly, I absolutely loved this movie!  It is, however, geared to more patient or adult audiences that don't mind a film quietly unfolding.  KGHarris, 5/11.",5,The Most Realistic Police Movie Ever?

1437348,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0051T46DW,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","A young detective follows a high school kid, a suspected drug pusher, as he goes to school, hangs out with friends, and occasionally smokes hash. After several days worth of surveillance yields no leads on a supplier or any direct connections to illegal activity other than using, it's clear the kid is mostly harmless. Sure, the kid's breaking the law, but Cristi, the detective, knows that most places in Europe possession of marijuana doesn't even warrant arrest, and suspects the law will eventually change in Romania. While Cristi hesitates, reluctant to take responsibility for ruining the future of a young man, his supervisor wants results, even if it means bringing the kid in for possession, a minor crime, but one that could land the kid in jail for several years.It's a simple police procedural film, with none of the hype or glamour or intrigue of even the simplest television cop show. There are no car chases, no shoot outs, no rapid fire montages of strip clubs and shady deals. The most dangerous weapon wielded in the climactic showdown is a dictionary. Still, under the masterful direction of Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 East of Bucharest), this simple and deliberately paced film becomes a quite profound and subtle meditation on the meaning of conscience in a world regulated by law, and on the essence of language. While stylistically more direct, the approach of this film and its simple profundity reminded me of the best episodes in Krysztof Kieslowski's remarkableThe Decalogueseries.

1437350,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0051T46DW,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[4, 4]","The tag line to this Romanian film is `In a world where crime has no meaning'. I was keen to see this as it is from director Corneliu Porumboiu who did '12:08 East of Bucharest'.This has a very basic plot in that a cop is assigned a case to target a drug dealer. He spends weeks watching him and staking out his house etc. He then files his report arguing for leniency as the law on drugs is so Draconian. His bosses take a more traditional police approach and he has a crisis of conscience. That is neither a plot spoiler or too short a synopsis as this is a basic film examining conscience. It is not a crime thriller or an action movie, despite having a gun on the cover, the dictionary it lies on is a better representation of this film.Set in post Stalinist Romania, the settings are all bleak, rotting concrete and badly made roads, which add to the cold feel of the film. There is very little colour too so that when something bright -like a blue bucket- appears on screen I was immediately drawn to it. Whether that is intentional or a reflection on the greyness of the city is unclear.There is also no background music at all, this adds to the feeling that time is passing slowly and there are many such devices which seem to heighten the mundanity of his job.This film has many layers but you will have to dig to get them and at 113 minutes running time does seem overly long. However, when it gets moving, things change fairly rapidly. One of the things I love about World Cinema is the different approaches to film making from say Hollywood, but there are downsides too and this film for me required some effort. It felt a bit Kafkaesque so if that is your thing I am sure you will like this presentation from Artificial Eye.",3,For Kafka fans only,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,1737,"['tag', 'line', 'Romanian', 'film', 'world', 'where', 'crime', 'meaning', 'was', 'keen', 'see', 'director', 'Corneliu', 'Porumboiu', 'who', 'did', ""'12:08"", 'East', ""Bucharest'.This"", 'very', 'basic', 'plot', 'cop', 'assigned', 'case', 'target', 'drug', 'dealer', 'weeks', 'watching', 'staking', 'out', 'house', 'etc', 'then', 'report', 'arguing', 'leniency', 'law', 'drugs', 'so', 'Draconian', 'bosses', 'take', 'more', 'traditional', 'police', 'approach', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'too', 'short', 'synopsis', 'basic', 'film', 'examining', 'conscience', 'not', 'crime', 'thriller', 'action', 'movie', 'having', 'gun', 'cover', 'dictionary', 'better', 'representation', 'film.Set', 'post', 'Stalinist', 'Romania', 'settings', 'are', 'bleak', 'rotting', 'concrete', 'badly', 'made', 'roads', 'add', 'cold', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'colour', 'too', 'so', 'when', 'something', 'bright', 'blue', 'bucket-', 'screen', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'intentional', 'reflection', 'greyness', 'city', 'unclear.There', 'also', 'background', 'music', 'feeling', 'time', 'passing', 'slowly', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'devices', 'seem', 'heighten', 'mundanity', 'job.This', 'film', 'many', 'layers', 'will', 'have', 'dig', 'get', '113', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'seem', 'overly', 'long', 'However', 'when', 'moving', 'things', 'change', 'fairly', 'rapidly', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'World', 'Cinema', 'different', 'approaches', 'film', 'making', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'downsides', 'too', 'film', 'required', 'effort', 'felt', 'bit', 'Kafkaesque', 'so', 'thing', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'presentation', 'Artificial', 'Eye']","Police, Adjective"
