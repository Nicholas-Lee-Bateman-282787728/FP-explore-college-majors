And why doesn't Amazon allow ZERO stars????  The creative minds behind this have committed the ultimate sin -- it's just not funny.  The first Gretchen Mol bit had potential but that was rapidly exhausted.  The rest of this is truly awful.  I don't mind the blasphemy or any of the other content; what I do mind is the absence of funny.

On paper, the movie seems non-conformist and gutsy for going against the Church, etc. In reality, it is cheesy, and is not a parody of anything worthwhile.There might be some who will notice more inside jokes than others, but overall, the entire movie is one big inside joke on the gullible audience. It's a shame too, because the cast is incredible. Sadly, the actors try the best to deliver their lines, but they have nothing to work with.In the end, the only one sequence out of ten that is worth watching is the very first one. Featuring Adam Brody as a newly-made celebrity God and Winona Ryder as his fiance, the sequence is keen to pick up on our obsession with the media and celebrities.Other sequences fall flat in the jokes, with one sequence focusing on being as vulgar as possible, but in Spanish. Additionally, the movie suffers from not having a unified theme and comes together haphazardly at the very end.By the time the credits roll, you'll be delighted to get on with your life and forget you ever experienced this atrocity.",1,stay away if you don't want to waste 93 minutes of your life,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1190,"['am', 'tad', 'stupidier', 'having', 'seen', 'Ten.Film', 'noir', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'goal', 'instead', 'up', 'being', 'worse', 'average', 'YouTube', 'video', 'paper', 'movie', 'non-conformist', 'gutsy', 'going', 'Church', 'etc', 'reality', 'cheesy', 'not', 'parody', 'anything', 'worthwhile.There', 'might', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'notice', 'more', 'inside', 'jokes', 'others', 'overall', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'inside', 'joke', 'gullible', 'audience', 'shame', 'too', 'cast', 'incredible', 'Sadly', 'actors', 'try', 'best', 'deliver', 'lines', 'have', 'nothing', 'work', 'end', 'only', 'one', 'sequence', 'ten', 'worth', 'watching', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'Featuring', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'newly-made', 'celebrity', 'God', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'fiance', 'sequence', 'keen', 'pick', 'up', 'obsession', 'media', 'celebrities.Other', 'sequences', 'fall', 'flat', 'jokes', 'one', 'sequence', 'focusing', 'being', 'as', 'vulgar', 'possible', 'Spanish', 'Additionally', 'movie', 'suffers', 'not', 'having', 'unified', 'theme', 'together', 'haphazardly', 'very', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'be', 'delighted', 'get', 'life', 'forget', 'ever', 'experienced', 'atrocity']",N/A

What were these actors thinking being in this mediocre ""comedy""? They deserve a better movie.The film seems to be impressed with how ""wacky"" it is. Ha, ha. Instead, it's just silly and stupid. We have two black 20 year olds born to a white couple who wonder about their paternity. The mother thinks it's Arnold Schwarzenegger and hires an actor (Oliver Platt) to pretend to be him. Then the mother realizes the boys' father is really Arsenio Hall. So the actor, who can't do an Arsenio impression, does Eddie Murphy. A woman (Winona Ryder) gets married after her other fiance falls out of a plane and get surgically stuck in the ground. Then she falls for a ventriloquist's dummie and has sex with it and leaves her husband for it. Another sketch is about a woman (Gretchen Mol) whose husband likes to hang out around the house with his other male friends naked rather than go to church. Another tale is a raunchy, offensive cartoon about a rhino who likes to gossip and whose lies lead to grisly deaths by sex.Doesn't really make any sense, does it? What does any of this have to do with the Ten Commandments? Nothing, really. It's just unfunny nonsense instead of sharp, humorous satire.

They didn't. It just kept sliding downhill, and finally I gave up and took it back to the video store, two days early.Folks who think that Wes Anderson is a brilliant, gifted genius might get off on this flick.  Like Anderson's ouvre, the humor is crude and overly-obvious, and the basic technique is to pile one joke on top of another, ad nauseum.  Meanwhile, all the attention is placed on the self-satisfied cleverness of the writers, and thus the actual directing is weak and actors are allowed to coast. Isn't it groovy and miraculous enough that they are vehicles for the brilliantly witty bon mots of the writer -- why should they have to act as well?This film is about as subtle as a ton of bricks.  Dropped on your toes. From a great height, so your feet turn to jelly.  And they, your feet, hurt a lot.  And start oozing and festering.  And then all your friends start calling you Fester. And you start getting all these Addams Family jokes tossed at you until one day you go crazy and rob a bank.  (And did I mention, the jokes in this film are often written in about the same way as this paragraph, with about as much comedic effect -- close to nil -- and it keeps on going on and on and on and on and on and each sequence is at least as lame as the one before it?  It's like a student film on steroids, and that isn't funny either...)Paul Rudd, who I think is a great comedic actor, serves as the postmodern, irony-laden, hipster's Rod Serling, introducing each of the ten segments... And, oh, what a stain on his resume!  Take my word for it: if you are also a Paul Rudd fan, it ain't worth it to watch this movie to see him in action.  This one's a turkey. Skip it.

I've seen a movie so inexplicably appalling that I'm in favor of mandatory mental competency tests being given to Hollywood directors, actors, and screenwriters before a frame of film is shot. This cinematic cold sore is The Ten. It's an allegedly comedic collection of short stories ""based"" on each one of the Ten Commandments [tee hee].Let's see, where to begin: IT'S NOT FUNNY. Not in the slightest. The stories have little or nothing to do with the particular Commandment to which it's linked...unless, of course, one can truly draw a line from the ""thou shall not covet thy neighbor's goods"" ruling and connect it to two guys in prison making the beast with two backs (get the kids out of the room). Here's a sample of the dialogue, an argument between The Ten's host/moderator (played by, alas, Paul Rudd) has with his wife (Famke Janssen) in front of gigantic approximations of those TWO STONE TABLETS Moses brought down from Mt. Lebanon or wherever:Man: You know what, Gretchen? You know what you can do?Wife: Don't say something you're gonna regret.Man: Go...Man: Fly...Wife: I'm warning you, Jeff.Man: A...Wife: Don't you say it!Man [earnestly]: Go fly a kite, Gretchen!

At least the Monty Pyton guys did a little bit of research for their LIFE OF BRIAN.Because of their lack of any comprehension of the commandments, they're incapable of producing a sketch remotely involving...let alone a sketch that's remotely funny.So who are they trying to entertain?  An audience with any religious awareness is going to be put off by the language, crudity and general blasphemy gleefully on display here.  Any agnostics and athiests will be put off by both any religious references as well as the lack of any real comedy.I feel bad for the people in this movie because I have this sick feeling that there will be a DVD player on Judgment Day...and THE TEN will be reviewed during the cast and crew's appearance in the dock.  Man, I hope I'm not next in line.This movie was so terrible that I actually felt bad for hating those Broken Lizard losers and their awful movies.  That's a joke, by the way.  The Broken Lizard losers are still grotesquely horrible.So who would like this movie?  Looking over the other reviews, I found one that seemed legitimate: her son was in the movie so she liked it.

658078,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00005JPXC,Thomas M. Sipos,"[13, 26]","First off, THE TEN ignores its own ""high concept."" This film has nothing to do with the Ten Commandments.  It doesn't satirize them or reference them in any substantive way.For instance, in one of the ten skits, a man jumps from an airplane without a parachute. He survives, but must remain half-buried in the ground. So he becomes a celebrity.  This skit is supposed to depict Thou Shalt Not Worship Other Gods Before Me.HOW does it relate to that commandment? Because he becomes a celebrity, and we worship celebrities?  It's a weak connection.Another skit is about a newlywed woman (Winona Ryder) who falls in love with a ventriloquist dummy.  Which commandment is this?  The one about adultery or coveting your neighbor's wife?  No, this is supposed to illustrate Thou Shalt Not Steal, because Ryder steals the dummy at one point.But that's NOT the gist of the skit.  It's just a minor plot point.  Again, this skit is unrelated in any meaningful way to its commandment.Of course, one can forgive THE TEN for ignoring its own concept, were it funny.  It's not.The comedy is all over the place, uncertain what mood or tone it wants.  One skit satirizes Woody Allen's relationship films.  Another resembles the FRITZ THE CAT cartoon.  Others are broad-based TV type skits.THE TEN's skit comedy structure is similar to KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE, and MONTY PYTHON'S MEANING OF LIFE, except those films are (1) funnier, and (2) consistent in their comedic tone.THE TEN is boring, its satirical targets very old, even by TV standards.It's sad to see Winona Ryder slumming in this mess.  She's in some great films: GIRL INTERRUPTED, LOST SOULS, 1969, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, not to mention such excellent comedies as REALITY BITES.Ryder has too many great films to list -- but most are from the 1980s and 1990s.  In THE TEN she just screeches maniacally, occupying under 10 minutes of screen time, portraying a woman who for no reason suddenly falls in love with a dummy.This has been a mostly bad decade for Ryder, and THE TEN doesn't change that.It's sad to see Liev Schreiber slumming in THE TEN.  Schreiber appeared in some of the finest indie films of the 1990s -- WALKING AND TALKING and THE DAYTRIPPERS -- a decade known for great indie films.But lately Schreiber has appeared in that pointless and poor OMEN remake, and now this.  He just goes through the motions in THE TEN, almost as if he's embarrassed to be in this film, and just wants to get it over with.A couple of the actors in TEN TEN are from RENO 911 -- except RENO 911 is much funnier.  And the actors do nothing to improve THE TEN with their presence.An unfunny, pointless mess.",1,"Unfunny skits, unconnected to the Ten Commandments",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2660,"['First', 'off', 'THE', 'TEN', 'own', 'high', 'concept', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'Ten', 'Commandments', ""n't"", 'satirize', 'reference', 'substantive', 'way.For', 'instance', 'one', 'ten', 'skits', 'man', 'jumps', 'airplane', 'parachute', 'must', 'remain', 'half-buried', 'ground', 'celebrity', 'skit', 'supposed', 'depict', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Not', 'Worship', 'Other', 'Gods', 'Me.HOW', 'relate', 'commandment', 'celebrity', 'worship', 'celebrities', 'weak', 'connection.Another', 'skit', 'newlywed', 'woman', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'who', 'love', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'Which', 'commandment', 'one', 'adultery', 'coveting', 'neighbor', 'wife', 'No', 'supposed', 'illustrate', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Not', 'Steal', 'Ryder', 'dummy', 'one', 'point.But', 'NOT', 'gist', 'skit', 'just', 'minor', 'plot', 'point', 'Again', 'skit', 'unrelated', 'meaningful', 'way', 'commandment.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'THE', 'TEN', 'ignoring', 'own', 'concept', 'were', 'funny', 'not.The', 'comedy', 'place', 'uncertain', 'what', 'mood', 'tone', 'One', 'skit', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'relationship', 'films', 'FRITZ', 'THE', 'CAT', 'cartoon', 'Others', 'are', 'broad-based', 'TV', 'type', 'skits.THE', 'TEN', 'skit', 'comedy', 'structure', 'similar', 'KENTUCKY', 'FRIED', 'MOVIE', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'SHUFFLE', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'MEANING', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'films', 'are', '1', 'funnier', '2', 'consistent', 'comedic', 'tone.THE', 'TEN', 'boring', 'satirical', 'targets', 'very', 'old', 'even', 'TV', 'standards.It', 'sad', 'see', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'slumming', 'mess', 'great', 'films', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', 'LOST', 'SOULS', '1969', 'BRAM', 'STOKER', 'DRACULA', 'not', 'mention', 'such', 'excellent', 'comedies', 'REALITY', 'BITES.Ryder', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'list', 'most', 'are', '1980s', '1990s', 'TEN', 'just', 'screeches', 'maniacally', 'occupying', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'portraying', 'woman', 'who', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'love', 'dummy.This', 'been', 'mostly', 'bad', 'decade', 'Ryder', 'THE', 'TEN', ""n't"", 'change', 'that.It', 'sad', 'see', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'slumming', 'THE', 'TEN', 'Schreiber', 'appeared', 'finest', 'indie', 'films', '1990s', 'WALKING', 'TALKING', 'THE', 'DAYTRIPPERS', 'decade', 'known', 'great', 'indie', 'films.But', 'lately', 'Schreiber', 'appeared', 'pointless', 'poor', 'OMEN', 'remake', 'now', 'just', 'motions', 'THE', 'TEN', 'almost', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'film', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'with.A', 'couple', 'actors', 'TEN', 'TEN', 'are', 'RENO', '911', 'RENO', '911', 'much', 'funnier', 'actors', 'do', 'nothing', 'improve', 'THE', 'TEN', 'presence.An', 'unfunny', 'pointless', 'mess']",N/A
