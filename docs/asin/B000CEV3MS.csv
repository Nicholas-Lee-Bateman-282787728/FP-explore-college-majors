Of course, he was talking about ""Birth of a Nation,"" which, although it's a great film, mendaciously tries to justify one of history's great injustices, slavery.The Hanging Gale is also about one of history's great injustices-- the English exploitation of Ireland that climaxed in the Potato Famine of 1848-- but there is nothing mendacious about it.  Of course, I wasn't there, but the series seems absolutely fair and truthful in its treatment of the tragedy.  It presents Irish brutality and greed along with English, and it is unflinching in its dramatization of a situation that left little room for compassion, honesty, or hope. It's also wonderfully written, produced and acted, and because of that, very worth watching despite its very grim subject. One of the best TV mini-series I've seen.",5,history written in lightning,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,896,"['series', 'mind', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'comment', 'film', 'history', 'written', 'lightning', 'course', 'was', 'talking', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'great', 'film', 'mendaciously', 'justify', 'one', 'history', 'great', 'injustices', 'slavery.The', 'Hanging', 'Gale', 'also', 'one', 'history', 'great', 'injustices', 'English', 'exploitation', 'Ireland', 'climaxed', 'Potato', 'Famine', '1848', 'nothing', 'mendacious', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'series', 'absolutely', 'fair', 'truthful', 'treatment', 'tragedy', 'Irish', 'brutality', 'greed', 'English', 'unflinching', 'dramatization', 'situation', 'left', 'little', 'room', 'compassion', 'honesty', 'hope', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'produced', 'acted', 'very', 'worth', 'watching', 'very', 'grim', 'subject', 'One', 'best', 'TV', 'mini-series', ""'ve"", 'seen']",The Hanging Gale

And the Michael Kitchen character struggles with his own sensibilities in his role as an Englishman.But bringing history into DVD in a dark photography mode with the highly talended and respected Michael Kitchen, well that really gets you over and over.

People are poor, starving; crops are failing.  Folks had little to no income to afford their rents or buy food. Not exaggerated or embellished, the story follows one particular family's struggles in parallel with an English &#34;management&#34; replacement (played superbly by Michael Kitchen).  Kitchen's character at the outset of his arrival in the village only sees the issues from his role as the manager for the owner of the farms; while the families in the local village see him only as the &#34;outsider&#34; and &#34;enforcer&#34; of the landowner's wishes.

It is not only the story of the Irish potato famine of two centuries ago, but it is about man's inhumanity to man, about how man is a wolf to man because largely the rich own everything, including the land you live and work on, and including the law, while unprivileged human beings (with no inheritable wealth) are merely serfs, slaves, consumers, ""creatures.""  Michael Kitchen, a wonderful, even adorable actor, plays a dishonorable role in this film, an agent of the rich (in England).  When the Irish Phelan family lose their home and land by Part 3, one wonders what Part 4 can say or illustrate.  It seems as if the film is over at this point.  The finale has been shown and completed.  Part 4, however, is a worthy counterpart to the first three parts.  Do not discount it.  This film is very instructive, by analogy, as to what will or can occur should men and women defend liberty in America now that Global Governance has started it's greedy (carbon trading/vegetarian/GMO foods/international socialism) claims, with the Elite (rich) at the very top giving the orders.

This presentation dwells primarily on the struggles of the Phelan family and mainly about the four brothers as played wonderfully by real life brothers, Paul, Stephen, Joe and Mark McGann--who are very rugged and very handsome; with one brother being a rather emtionally torn priest and all of them prone to violence and not above committing murder.  The brothers are trying to deal with the devastation of poverty, starvation, crop failure, etc.  (along with some of the dreariest  weather that I've ever seen on film) that is happening to their family and friends and, of course, that meant dealing with Captain Townsend as played greatly by Michael Kitchen who is a rather ""mild-mannered"" agent for the absent and without a clue land owner.  This 2 disc (two episodes on each disc) mini-series is greatly acted and directed.  I certainly now have more knowledge and understanding of what happened to the Irish during the time being depicted.Be advised that this is no cushy ""Hallmark"" presentation.

957676,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000CEV3MS,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[5, 5]","EXCELLENCE in cast, writing, music, location, and historical truth. This could be called a documentary/fiction. I visited Ireland and did some research into ""The Great Hunger"", or potato famine, and this is spot on. You have to read Irish publications to get truth. I'm absolutely amazed the BBC allowed this. Irish people still are shy in talking about the famine event.This story focuses on the accounts of a family of 4 boys, the Phelans, and their struggle during the famine years. The story idea was originated with 2 of the 4 McGann brothers that played the 4 Phelan brother roles. In their struggle, the absent landowner sends an agent, Capt. Townsend (wow! played by Michael Kitchen, doing as super as he has done with Foyle's War). Those McGann brothers were equally good in their portrayals as Kitchen was as the man caught between duty and desire to help the poor. There is suspense, mystery, action... and beauty amid the wretchedness.Having been all over Co. Donegal, Ireland (the origin of my ancestors) I can attest that this footage taken there is exactly how most of the country looks. The wild countryside yet exists. The music by Shaun Davey, placed behind the perfection of acting, costumes (some just like old photographs and written first-hand accounts of the famine years)...well the music is as enthralling as the story. A must see for any Irish, history, & Kitchen fans.1: Begins in may, 1846, Co. Donegal, and a new land agent replaces a murdered man. He soon finds deplorable conditions for tenants of the estate and a desperate Irish poor. While trying to seize animals in loo of back rent, a farmer is shot. Just as harvest time arrives so does the potato blight.2: Fr Liam Phelan is returned to Donegal just as the potato crop is lost & records his first instance of death from want. Townsend must begin turning out tenants--11 in all. One, Mary, is hired as his servant. A letter is sent by the United Sons of Freedom, 10 Nov, 1846 sentencing Townsend to death.3: Daniel, leading USofF, tries to avenge wrongs through violent reactive measures. His brother, Fr. Liam, begs for peace. Conor begs Coulter for a fight to earn $$$. He takes a fight against a Brit soldier ending in consequences. An assassination plot is devised against Townsend. Crisis descends upon the Phelan family.4: Lord Hawksborough offers free America passage to tenants. Yet famine, starvation, struggle, and death continue. Some proud Irish people refuse to quit. A life/death struggle--a holocaust for many. Desperate days for others. A gritty depiction of Ireland's Great Hunger.Some nudity, violence, mature audience. NO subtitles or CC, but still worth seeing. I'm so glad I bought this. I'll re-watch it.Historically accurate according to the Irish books on the famine that I own, and what I witnessed in historical sites in Ireland.

Brother Liam (Paul McGann--Withnail and I, Horatio Hornblower, Fish) is a Catholic priest, a man whose faith is sorely tried throughout the family's ordeal; while Daniel (Stephen McGann), a passionate and angry young man with a dangerous secret, is a school teacher.  Brothers Sean (Joe McGann) and Conor (Mark McGann--The Grand) live and work with their father on the family farm, along with Sean's wife, Maeve, and their small children.  The Phelan's holding is a small one and is one of many let by Lord Hawksborough, a highly unsympathetic, avaricious absentee British landowner--a man whom we never see, but whose presence (not to mention iron will) is represented by his agent.The series opens with the murder of the agent by a radical and dangerous group of Irish vigilantes.  Enter Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War) as Captain Townsend, the new agent.  Townsend is appalled by what he sees and is sympathetic to the plight of the Irish tenants, but he is not the landowner.  His duty is to his Lordship--to manage the property and collect the rents on his Lordship's behalf.  Apart from writing to his master to inform him of the situation and to make requests on behalf of the tenants, there is little that Townsend is able to do.  It is Townsend's good nature that creates the tremendous tension in this splendid series, for we are torn as we sympathize with both the Phelans (and the other tenants) as their situation goes from bad to worse and with Townsend, whose hands are tied.I don't wish to delve in detail about the complexities of the plot and the twists and turns that it takes as I don't wish to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this fine series.  Suffice it to say that the series (produced in 1995 and consisting of four 50-minute episodes) is a captivating--indeed riveting--historical drama that will keep one on the edge of one's seat and waiting in anticipation for the next episode.  It has the added benefit of being educational and informative, and it provided much in the way of conversation for our family in between episodes.  As should be obvious, this is a heavy series, but it is not one that will be soon forgotten, and I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys top quality (and well-acted) historical drama.
