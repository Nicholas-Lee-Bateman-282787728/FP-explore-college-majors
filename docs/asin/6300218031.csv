And is not an adult film because it is not pornographic(this may make you chuckle). Anyway,director John Hughes(PLANES TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES,SHE'S HAVING A BABY,CURLY SUE,HOME ALONE 1 & 2),worked with a talented cast featuring Eric Stoltz(MASK),Lea Thompson(HOWARD THE DUCK),Mary Stuart Masterson(FUNNY ABOUT LOVE,FRIED GREEN TOMATOES) and John Ashton(BEVERLY HILLS COP 1 & 2,MIDNIGHT RUN,LITTLE BIG LEAGUE). Thompson and MSM are respectively,Stoltz's love interests. Interestingly,MSM plays drums in the film. Ashton is Keith's(Stoltz) father Cliff,a service station attendant.

223967,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6300218031,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 5]","And my 80's reviews continue. Okay, watching this movie is basically like watching ""Pretty In Pink"" all over again, but with the genders and ending switched. Makes sense. It was written by the same writer, John Hughes, and directed by the same director, Howard Deutch(who would later marry his star, Lea Thompson). But there's more to it than that, and we will get into that a little bit later. For starters, let's get to what the movie is about. But if you have seen the already mentioned PIP, then you pretty much already know. And having just written a review for PIP, I thought it would be quite hard to review a movie that is basically the same one I just wrote about. But I will do my best!.Eric Stoltz stars as Keith Nelson, a middle class 18 year old high school senior. He works at a garage, attends school, and has a father(John Ashton, ""Beverly Hills Cop"")riding his every moment to pick a college to attend. But Keith is on his own path. He has a best friend in Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson), a tomboy with a love of drums(as she carries her sticks with her wherever she goes)and for Keith. But you see, Keith is blind, and he doesn't see it. Instead, he has the hots for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), a beauty who is in a whole other class than Keith and seemingly unattainable. When she has had enough of her boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Scheffer), Amanda accepts Keith's offer of a date, and he sets out to win the girl, stand up to the bully, and continue to overlook his best pal's feelings for him.Okay, here is how I know the story. John Hughes wrote ""Pretty In Pink"" with an ending he liked and wanted. The director, producers, and even Ringwald(who was offered this movie but turned it down. Why would she want to do the same movie over again?) herself, didn't like it, didn't think the audience would either, and it was changed. In my opinion, it was a change for the better. Ending it the other way just didn't ring true to me and a lot of others, and the people involved supporting the change have valid reasoning. So, John Hughes ended up writing this movie in response to how ""Pretty In Pink"" ended with his original ending intact. Except this time, his original ending works for the better with these characters. It really wouldn't of worked with PIP at all, and I am glad they changed it for that film. Here, it does ring true, and it works. It feels right. The way it should be. But does anything else work?.Just like PIP, ""Some King Of Wondeful"" is working with a story that is not new and we've seen numerous times. But the movie has what PIP had that made it seem worthwhile. The script, and a lot of the dialogue, just works for the time and place and the characters. These people seem like real human beings, and not plastic models that you see plastered all over TV and movies nowadays. I found myself charmed by the whole thing, as with PIP, and really liked the characters. Speaking of, The characters were cast with good actors. Even though Ringwald sat this one out, we get another redhead in the form of Eric Stoltz. He does an admirable job as Keith Nelson, and he is really likeable and down to earth. There is an innocent charm to him in the same way as Ringwald's past characters in the Hughes universe. He is relatable and watchable. So too is Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, the ""Duckie"" of this version. She has the right kind of attitude and punkiness for the role, and doesn't make it a caricature, which can so easily be done, and many actors would do just that with the role. Sadly, Lea Thompson(the female version of Andrew McCarthy) can't quite match the other two. She is pretty and likeable, but I got the feeling that maybe she was just the wrong choice for Amanda Jones. Some of her scenes were a little wooden, and I didn't get much chemistry with her and Keith together. Thompson is a fine actress, but she has been much better in other roles. And then there is Keith's family. John Ashton is great as the gruff dad, but it's Keith's two sisters, played by Maddie Corman and Candace Cameron, that steal the show. Some of the best humor in the movie comes from his family. I loved those parts. I also loved Elias Koteas as the school tough guy, whose relationship with Keith soon turns after his first introduction in the movie in a great way. His scenes with Stoltz in detention admiring each other's art work was a particular highlight. I also loved the ""Breakfast Club"" reference when Watts tells the guys she's playing cards with ""you mess with the bull, you get the horns"". The line the principal gave to Bender.I really liked and enjoyed this movie a lot, and even though there is a part of me that wants to write a less than rave review, or at least, a smaller four star rating, simply because we've just seen this movie a year before, I just can't. I liked it too much and it was just very enjoyable. No matter if we've seen this story before, this movie still manages to get you with it's real, normal, characters, the well casted actors they have assembled for the movie, and the surroundings. No matter what decade, we've all been to high school. John Hughes always knows how to cast a movie too. His casts are usually great. As for the ending, it's the feel good ending that a lot of people would want, and here, it's what should happen. I just don't think I would feel the same if PIP had ended the same way. Plus, if it did, then we probably wouldn't of gotten this movie. And did you catch a Rolling Stones theme throughout the movie. Amanda Jones is a Stones song, one that is heard throughout the film. The main kid, Keith, is named after Keith Richards. And Watts?. You guessed it. Stones drummer, Charlie Watts. Love it. So, ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" is PIP 2, but that's okay. It's also one of, if not the last, great teen/high school movies of the 80's, and John Hughes' last as well. The 80's was just perfect, and it surprises me how people still have to point out, as a negative, that these movies are dated. Well, of course they are. And the point being?. They weren't made yesterday. Nowadays, something only a month old is dated and people are on to the next thing. The great thing about these movies is that not only is it's ""dated-ness"" a good thing, a fun nostalgic thing, but these movies have things that people can see and go ""Oh!, remember that!"". Some of these things may not be what someone wants to remember, but they are memorable. 20 years from now, it's not going to be the same looking back at movies from the 90's or present day. I guess it means more to those who actually grew up in the time and understand what it had to offer much better. Also, these kinds of movies have issues that are universal to everyone. Hughes was a master at this genre. Nobody did it better than him. If ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" was to be his teen swan song, it wasn't a bad way to go.This edition is the ""I Love The 80's"" version, and there are no special features, but you get the exact same CD with the exact same 4 songs that are in the other editions. While this is cool, it would of been nice if it were a different CD in each one. I mean, does anyone really need numerous copies of A-Ha's ""Take On Me""?. I think not.",4,Hughes' Teen Movie Swan Song,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,7198,"['80', 'reviews', 'continue', 'Okay', 'watching', 'movie', 'basically', 'like', 'watching', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'over',

Thus, for instance, the characters live in the area of Southern California near the Mexican border and they even speak of living in &quot;sectors&quot; which is border patrol lingo for different areas. The characters' backgrounds are very believable with a neglected tomboy of a drummer that is punked out and the solid working class hero Keith with artistic talents, one can not help but wonder if Keith was meant to be a Chicano artist from a solid Mexican American family working in a garage and spraypainting murals as his genuine artistic activity. The opening shot of the film points in that direction because it shows Keith crossing over some heavy duty railroad tracks and that has a double significance, first as the right vs wrong side of the &quot;tracks&quot; in a small town, but also signifying the border region between the US and Mexico.The film suffers from casting adults as teenagers, and still more is lost when the casting directr misses out on the cultural idiom. Skinheads are barely recognizable and none of them wear suspenders. The drummer girl, who is apparently  a punk rocker, if you look at the walls in her room, has no tattoos or real piercings, and does not look punk. Also, it is a bit odd to hear relatively flat chested Mary Stuard Masterson worrying about sagging breasts, which sounds like a heavy set person's affliction and which would really not be out of character when you consider her pigging out on takeout food and hanging out at Keith's garage because she has no place to go and no family to eat dinner with.Unfortunately none of this screenplay realism made it into the film since it was cast with mainstream actors who only interpreted acting a punk, skinhead or a working class hero, but did not look the part. The film is a great romantic comedy with an dynamite opening sequence (Too bad THAT music did not make it onto the soundtrack!), but then its starts straining the bounds of believability with its fairy tale like qualities, which fail as a source of satire. The perfect date takes a good piece of the film is almost unbearable to watch. Putting the girl waiting in the wings as a chauffeur on a date is a great pun, but it's so corny, that it's painful to see.The actors do a tremedous job, Eric Stoltz giving credence to romantic obssession, something that only Eric Stoltz had been able to do with grace. Mary Stuart Masterson is great as the social outcast with a heart of gold, interaction between them being the best part of the film. The films dialogue is excellent, even in comparison with serious acting films beyond existential dramas with high school as the arena and everyone being a teenager. It loses a star for a few glitches, but it's the best film of its type to come out of the eighties.",4,SURPRISING SOPHISTICATION FOR A HIGH SCHOOL FLICK,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,3205,"['film', 'ahead', 'time', 'consider', 'when', 'was', 'created', 'have', 'skinheads', 'celtic', 'music', 'end', 'credits', 'tomboy', 'prefer', 'butch', 'chick', 'long', 'things', 'made', 'out', 'mainstream', 'Remember', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'film', 'lot', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'point', 'where', 'screenplay', 'lost', 'casting', 'director', 'Thus', 'instance', 'characters', 'live', 'area', 'Southern', 'California', 'Mexican', 'border', 'even', 'speak', 'living', 'quot', 'sectors', 'quot', 'border', 'patrol', 'lingo', 'different', 'areas', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'neglected', 'tomboy', 'drummer', 'punked', 'solid', 'working', 'class', 'hero', 'Keith', 'artistic', 'talents', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'Keith', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'Chicano', 'artist', 'solid', 'Mexican', 'American', 'family', 'working', 'garage', 'spraypainting', 'murals', 'genuine', 'artistic', 'activity', 'opening', 'shot', 'film', 'points', 'direction', 'Keith', 'crossing', 'heavy', 'duty', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'double', 'significance', 'first', 'right', 'vs', 'wrong', 'side', 'quot', 'tracks', 'quot', 'small', 'town', 'also', 'signifying', 'border', 'region', 'US', 'Mexico.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'casting', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'still', 'more', 'lost', 'when', 'casting', 'directr', 'out', 'cultural', 'idiom', 'Skinheads', 'are', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'none', 'wear', 'suspenders', 'drummer', 'girl', 'who', 'apparently', 'punk', 'rocker', 'look', 'walls', 'room', 'tattoos', 'real', 'piercings', 'not', 'look', 'punk', 'Also', 'bit', 'odd', 'hear', 'relatively', 'flat', 'chested', 'Mary', 'Stuard', 'Masterson', 'worrying', 'sagging', 'breasts', 'heavy', 'set', 'person', 'affliction', 'would', 'really', 'not', 'be', 'character', 'when', 'consider', 'pigging', 'out', 'takeout', 'food', 'hanging', 'out', 'Keith', 'garage', 'place', 'go', 'family', 'eat', 'dinner', 'with.Unfortunately', 'none', 'screenplay', 'realism', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'cast', 'mainstream', 'actors', 'who', 'only', 'interpreted', 'acting', 'punk', 'skinhead', 'working', 'class', 'hero', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'part', 'film', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dynamite', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Too', 'bad', 'THAT', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'starts', 'straining', 'bounds', 'believability', 'fairy', 'tale', 'qualities', 'fail', 'source', 'satire', 'perfect', 'date', 'good', 'piece', 'film', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'Putting', 'girl', 'waiting', 'wings', 'chauffeur', 'date', 'great', 'pun', 'so', 'corny', 'painful', 'see.The', 'actors', 'do', 'tremedous', 'job', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'giving', 'credence', 'romantic', 'obssession', 'something', 'only', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'grace', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'great', 'social', 'outcast', 'heart', 'gold', 'interaction', 'being', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'films', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'even', 'comparison', 'serious', 'acting', 'films', 'existential', 'dramas', 'high', 'school', 'arena', 'everyone', 'being', 'teenager', 'star', 'few', 'glitches', 'best', 'film', 'type', 'come', 'eighties']",Some Kind of Wonderful VHS

Eric Stolz stars as Keith, a sensitive artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks, who works after school as an auto mechanic and who has a monumental crush on pretty and popular classmate Amanda (Lea Thompson).  Mary Stuart Masterson is pitch perfect as tough tom boy Watts, Keith's best friend.Keith decides to ask Amanda out, a daring act which cuts against the grain of his social standing, the advice of the horrified Watts, and the warning of Amanda's angry former boyfriend Hardy (Craig Sheffer).  The rest of the movie is the gutsy Keith's preparation for his date with destiny (and Amanda).  Watts helps out, if only to save the dreamy Keith from himself.  Keith will also get an unexpected assist from a tough kid he befriends in detention.Hughes and Director Howard Deutch have the sensitive touch to portray three-dimensional young people with real hopes and fears, without drowning the audience in schmaltz.  The conclusion of the movie manages to be dramatic, insightful,and romantic all at the same time.

223993,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300218031,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Out of all the John Hughes pictures I've seen, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL ranks first in my heart, with FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and THE BREAKFAST CLUB slugging it out for a second place finish. And, yeah, it wasn't John Hughes who directed this one (but rather Howard Deutch), but SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is full of those quintessential John Hughes touches. And, besides, Hughes wrote the thing. This movie is when I fell in love with Mary Stuart Masterson, and, to me, clearly, her character Watts, sardonic and disaffected and yet secretly in love, is the most vital role in the film.John Hughes knows how painful high school can be, knows how big a deal it is for teens. He has this knack for tapping into the heart of the teenaged struggle. When we were kids, our world revolved around this quest for self-identity and a place in the pecking order and there was always, always this pressure to fit in. There's a reason Hughes' films in the '80s have stood the test of time. He makes it so personal and approaches it with great sensitivity and wit and real emotion. He makes you invest.Back in high school, you and I, we can relate to what Keith Nelson is going thru. Shy and closed-in and a bit of an outcast, Keith (Eric Stoltz) has fallen hopelessly for the most popular girl in school, Amanda Brown (Lea Thompson). Amanda lives in the same blue collar neighborhood as Keith and his best friend Watts. Except that Amanda happens to date the rich big man on campus and hangs with the posh, trendy crowd. Or as Watts, a devastatingly cute tomboy, remarks: ""Guilt by association."" Amanda is clearly out of Keith's league. But Keith is one of those brave souls who opts to lay his heart on the line. Did I say brave? Maybe I meant stupid. Even Watts is trying to drive sense into Keith. Of course, she's got ulterior motives.Keith girds his loins or screws his courage to the sticking place or whatever, and he puts himself out there. Surprisingly, his overtures toward Amanda are met with success and she agrees to a date. Mostly because Amanda's boyfriend has been acting like a champion tool (and Craig Sheffer is so good as the bad guy here). The film messes with the viewer. It initially establishes Watts as the rooting interest. She's the one pining for her best friend. But then the film turns around and makes Amanda Brown a sympathetic character also worth rooting for. I think that this is one of Lea Thompson's best roles. She makes Amanda Brown a three-dimensional person who gets hurt the same as anyone, and not 'til the very end do you really know with whom Keith will end up.It's one of those perfect casts, really. I think everyone is strong in their parts, from John Aston's demanding working class father who doesn't quite get his introspective son to Elias Koteas' howlingly funny rebel punk who befriends Keith and, in an odd way, plays a sort of fairy godmother role. But, really, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL belongs to Mary Stuart Masterson. She's the heart of it all. Equal parts defiant and vulnerable, she breaks your heart many times in this film. And how can you not fall for Watts, a wounded girl who not only is a bit of an iconoclast but who also plays the drums? How can you not pull for her? And yet, on the other hand, there stands Amanda Brown, equally wounded and who stands up for herself and is equally deserving of that good ending. SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is a legitimate romantic triangle and one of the best teen movies I've ever seen. Teen angst and social conflict and another superb 1980s soundtrack. Characters that feel real and emotional arcs that draw you in. This was when John Hughes still had that magic touch.The DVD's extras: Audio Commentary by Lea Thompson and director Howard Deutch (Thompson and Deutsch are married in real life); the ""Making Of"" the film featurette (00:07:45 minutes long); ""Meet the Cast"" (00:13:26); the Music; a Photo Gallery; and the ""John Hughes Time Capsule,"" which is a Kevin Bacon interview of John Hughes in 1986, huge chunks of which concern SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (00:10:49).",5,"""Don't go mistaking paradise for a pair of long legs.""",1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,4055,"['John', 'Hughes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', 'ranks', 'first', 'heart', 'FERRIS', 'BUELLER', 'DAY', 'OFF', 'THE', 'BREAKFAST', 'CLUB', 'slugging', 'out', 'second', 'place', 'finish', 'yeah', 'was', ""n't"", 'John', 'Hughes', 'who', 'directed', 'one', 'rather', 'Howard', 'Deutch', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', 'full', 'quintessential', 'John', 'Hughes', 'touches', 'besides', 'Hughes', 'wrote', 'thing', 'movie', 'when', 'fell', 'love', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'clearly', 'character', 'Watts', 'sardonic', 'disaffected', 'yet', 'secretly', 'love', 'most', 'vital', 'role', 'film.John', 'Hughes', 'how', 'painful', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'be', 'knows', 'how', 'big', 'deal', 'teens', 'knack', 'tapping', 'heart', 'teenaged', 'struggle', 'When', 'were', 'kids', 'world', 'revolved', 'quest', 'self-identity', 'place', 'pecking', 'order', 'was', 'always', 'always', 'pressure', 'fit', 'reason', 'Hughes', 'films', ""'80s"", 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'personal', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'wit', 'real', 'emotion', 'invest.Back', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'Keith', 'Nelson', 'going', 'thru', 'Shy', 'closed-in', 'bit', 'outcast', 'Keith', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'fallen', 'hopelessly', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Amanda', 'Brown', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Amanda', 'same', 'blue', 'collar', 'neighborhood', 'Keith', 'best', 'friend', 'Watts', 'Amanda', 'date', 'rich', 'big', 'man', 'campus', 'hangs', 'posh', 'trendy', 'crowd', 'Watts', 'devastatingly', 'cute', 'tomboy', 'remarks', 'Guilt', 'association', 'Amanda', 'clearly', 'Keith', 'league', 'Keith', 'one', 'brave', 'souls', 'who', 'opts', 'lay', 'heart', 'line', 'Did', 'say', 'brave', 'Maybe', 'meant', 'stupid', 'Even', 'Watts', 'trying', 'drive', 'sense', 'Keith', 'course', 'got', 'ulterior', 'motives.Keith', 'girds', 'loins', 'screws', 'courage', 'sticking', 'place', 'whatever', 'there', 'Surprisingly', 'overtures', 'Amanda', 'are', 'met', 'success', 'date', 'Mostly', 'Amanda', 'boyfriend', 'been', 'acting', 'champion', 'tool', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'so', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'here', 'film', 'viewer', 'initially', 'Watts', 'rooting', 'interest', 'one', 'pining', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'film', 'around', 'Amanda', 'Brown', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'also', 'worth', 'rooting', 'think', 'one', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'best', 'roles', 'Amanda', 'Brown', 'three-dimensional', 'person', 'who', 'hurt', 'same', 'anyone', 'not', ""'til"", 'very', 'end', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'whom', 'Keith', 'will', 'end', 'up.It', 'one', 'perfect', 'casts', 'really', 'think', 'everyone', 'strong', 'parts', 'John', 'Aston', 'demanding', 'working', 'class', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'introspective', 'son', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'howlingly', 'funny', 'rebel', 'punk', 'who', 'Keith', 'odd', 'way', 'sort', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'role', 'really', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', 'belongs', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'heart', 'Equal', 'parts', 'defiant', 'vulnerable', 'heart', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'Watts', 'wounded', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'bit', 'iconoclast', 'who', 'also', 'drums', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'pull', 'yet', 'other', 'hand', 'Amanda', 'Brown', 'equally', 'wounded', 'who', 'up', 'herself', 'equally', 'deserving', 'good', 'ending', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', 'legitimate', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Teen', 'angst', 'social', 'conflict', 'superb', '1980s', 'soundtrack', 'Characters', 'feel', 'real', 'emotional', 'arcs', 'draw', 'was', 'when', 'John', 'Hughes', 'still', 'had', 'magic', 'touch.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'director', 'Howard', 'Deutch', 'Thompson', 'Deutsch', 'are', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'Making', 'film', 'featurette', '00:07:45', 'minutes', 'long', 'Meet', 'Cast', '00:13:26', 'Music', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Time', 'Capsule', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'interview', 'John', 'Hughes', '1986', 'huge', 'chunks', 'concern', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', '00:10:49']",Some Kind of Wonderful VHS

I really loved this movie, it's one of my treasured keeper films. I know, I know, propaganda alert, but I did enjoy everything about it purely as a story with no subversive Catholic crap approved of. Mary Stuart Masterson is the beautiful, tough girl outcast, Watts, who is secretly in love with her mechanic best friend, Keith - who is of course, is drooling for the popular, conventionally pretty girl in school. Who in turn, ignores him completely and dates the snotty rich guy in her clique, who treats her like crap. It's a love triangle. Watts plays the drums and hangs out with Keith at the shop but is too much of a tough girl - and a virgin - to make her feelings known to him. All he can obsess about is Amanda Jones the girl of his dreams. He draws her. He spends his college fund on the perfect date to woo her. There's all kinds of drama with her boyfriend deciding to set up Keith for a beating. Watts is loyal and agrees to help him out. She hates Amanda clearly, but is worried about the beating thing. I won't tell you about the rest of the plot or movie, but it's a great trip. I was always rooting for Watts, though Amanda seems less of a b*tch once you get to know her. I was kind of in love with Watts when I first saw this movie, she's the kind of people I like. I like Keith too, they're sort of underground (maybe hero) types, outcasts, arty and tough.

Producer Hughes  has visited it often before and after, but the sincerity and heart-felt  depth of the performances here makes this a special realization. Tomboy  Watts, played by the luminous Mary Stuart Masterson, pines away secretly  for her shy, artistic, mechanic best friend Keith [Eric Stoltz]. Stoltz in  turn lusts after the school beauty Amanda Jones [Lea Thompson]. Villainy of  different degrees is provided by Amanda's snobbish friends, and her current  beau the devilish Hardy Jenss [Craig Sheffer giving us a taste of his  upcoming Nightbreed persona.] I've always had a soft spot for the Hughes  villains; and Hardy as the Corvette driving, Miami Vice homage-ing,  cheating, boyfriend stands up well against the languid lizard-like cool of  James Spader in Pretty in Pink.  Support for Keith is provided by his dad,  younger sisters, and a batch of new friends found in the depths of school  detention.  The movie revolves around Keith's courting of Amanda, and how  Watts must stand idly by while her devotion is deflected.  It becomes even  more heart breaking to observe her chauffeuring the two on their big date;  sobbing as she watches the two kiss in the light of an abandoned concert  venue.  Resolution comes at the party, to Charlie Sexton's Beat So Lonely.  Hardy and Keith square off with the results one might expect.  As this film  ages, after 13 years [!], I continue to enjoy the interplay between the  main characters when I see it.  There really isn't a weak performance all  the way around.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is ultimately a sweet,  reaffirming movie.",5,Top 5 80&#65533;s Teen Drama w/ Strong Performances,960681600,"06 11, 2000",2000,1882,"['consider', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'best', 'teen', 'movies', '80', '[', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '16', 'Candles', 'Weird', 'Science', ']', 'Additionally', 'think', 'sibling', 'film', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'story', 'obvious', 'unrequited', 'love', 'face', 'obsession', 'old', 'one', 'Producer', 'Hughes', 'visited', 'often', 'sincerity', 'heart-felt', 'depth', 'performances', 'here', 'special', 'realization', 'Tomboy', 'Watts', 'played', 'luminous', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'away', 'secretly', 'shy', 'artistic', 'mechanic', 'best', 'friend', 'Keith', '[', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', ']', 'Stoltz', 'turn', 'lusts', 'school', 'beauty', 'Amanda', 'Jones', '[', 'Lea', 'Thompson', ']', 'Villainy', 'different', 'degrees', 'provided', 'Amanda', 'snobbish', 'friends', 'current', 'beau', 'devilish', 'Hardy', 'Jenss', '[', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'giving', 'taste', 'upcoming', 'Nightbreed', 'persona', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'Hughes', 'villains', 'Hardy', 'Corvette', 'driving', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'homage-ing', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'well', 'languid', 'lizard-like', 'cool', 'James', 'Spader', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'Support', 'Keith', 'provided', 'dad', 'younger', 'sisters', 'batch', 'new', 'friends', 'found', 'depths', 'school', 'detention', 'movie', 'Keith', 'courting', 'Amanda', 'how', 'Watts', 'must', 'stand', 'idly', 'devotion', 'deflected', 'even', 'more', 'heart', 'breaking', 'observe', 'chauffeuring', 'two', 'big', 'date', 'sobbing', 'two', 'kiss', 'light', 'abandoned', 'concert', 'venue', 'Resolution', 'party', 'Charlie', 'Sexton', 'Beat', 'So', 'Lonely', 'Hardy', 'Keith', 'square', 'off', 'results', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'film', 'ages', '13', 'years', '[', ']', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'interplay', 'main', 'characters', 'when', 'see', 'really', ""n't"", 'weak', 'performance', 'way', 'around', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'ultimately', 'sweet', 'reaffirming', 'movie']",Some Kind of Wonderful VHS

The plot of Pretty In Pink is sort of rehashed here: a teen from the poor side of town (Eric Stoltz subbing for Molly Ringwald), has got eyes for a popular teen (Lea Thompson subbing for Andrew McCarthy), and has a free-thinkin', seemingly gay best friend of the opposite gender (Mary Stuart Masterson subbing for Jon Cryer) that winds up being the person they should end up with.  There's even the token jerk that causes problems for everyone (Craig Sheffer subbing for James Spader.)The original ending of Pretty In Pink was changed after test audiences said they would rather Molly Ringwald's character end up with Andrew McCarthy's, instead of Jon Cryer's.  (Wrong! At least in my opinion.)  They got it right in ""Some Kind Of Wonderful.""  What a great 80's teen flick this is!  Not too sappy, not too dramatic- everything gets balanced out with little drops of humor here and there.  Candace Cameron is hilarious in every one of her scenes (check her out as Eric Stoltz's younger sister before she wound up on TV's migraine headache inducing ""Full House""); so is Maddie Corman who plays the middle sister.  (She later ended up on Margaret Cho's short lived ""All American Girl"" sitcom and was in another GREAT 80's teen flick called ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" which also starred Jennifer Connelly.)If you love this movie, or are a fan of the John Hughes genre, you should also check out the ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" soundtrack.  It's every bit as GREAT as the ""Pretty In Pink"" soundtrack.  The opening credits sequence music from ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" (""Abuse"" by Propaganda) is not on the cd, but is available on Propaganda's ""Wishful Thinking"" cd.The only issue I have with this DVD is the same issue I have with a lot of other Paramount DVD's: no extra goodies.

Sometimes the genders were reversed.  Always, in 80s teen flicks, we see the same self-important oh-mi-gawd-type characters fill the screen in their high fashion and high hair.  Unlike so many of the decade's movies, however, this one is more timeless than, say, Sixteen Candles or Pretty in Pink which are very much of their time.What makes this movie effective more than John Hughes' direction or the script are very strong performances by some very talented young people.  The triangle of Eric Stolz as Keith, Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, and Lea Thompson as Amanda Jones gels on every level and breathes life into a script that might not have taken off with any other combination of the day's most popular teen actors.  It simply worked, and that is that.  If you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to check it out rather than give much away.  It is worth your time, and it will make you smile as much as it will move you.

224016,APIKB09RZAZN,6300218031,M. Bryan,"[3, 3]","I am a huge fan of the legendary Hughes films of the Eighties.  This is the sleeper of the bunch.  A true hidden jem not just of the Hughes films, but all of those teenage films that dominated 80's theater.  This is the last true masterpiece that he created.  He followed his string of teenage targeted sucesses with Uncle Buck & Home Alone.  He never returned back to his roots.  This is the ultimate love story of all his films & a glorious grand finale.I wrote my first review of Some Kind of Wonderful on Feb. 15th, 2007.  I recently had to do a report for school about teen films so I chose one of my favorites... this one.  I am posting an abridged version of my report; a better review I hope.The 80's were the greatest for teen movies in general.  John Hughes' was by far the man known to define 1980's outstanding cinema with a list of the most known teen films of that decade.  Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off all have to be mentioned if anyone is discussing teen movies in general.  These were all hits and are still popular amongst diehard fans of that era in film.  John Hughes would go on to write, produce, and / or direct Uncle Buck, the hit Home Alone & the odd, but funny Planes, Trains, & Automobiles.  He had a way of understanding teen issues of the day and was able to express them in his writing and in his directing.1987's Some Kind of Wonderful is an interesting teen love triangle in the vein of another Hughes film, Pretty in Pink.  This film has a fantastic cast and practically a perfectly written script.  Numerous characters are well thought out and developed within the film; not just thrown together to be shown once only to be forgotten ten minutes later... well maybe with the exception of the Mom character.  It is very easy to be drawn into this world of 80's teenage angst.  The sensationally edgy soundtrack helps to achieve this by bringing more emotion from the fabulous performances of the excellent ensemble.Some Kind of Wonderful opens up with the character Watts rapidly playing on some drums.  The rhythm drives the initial and traditional 80's montage that introduces all of the main players.  The beautiful Watts is played by the fresh faced Mary Stewart Masterson.  Her bobbed blonde hair is very reminiscent of Human League's Susan Ann Sulley.  Mary truly steals the film with an absolutely amazing performance as the heart torn best friend.  Watts is a tomboy from the wrong side of town and best friend to the main character in the film Keith.  The curious and hard working Keith Nelson is played by Eric Stoltz.  Keith is a loner artist from a blue collar family from the same neighborhood as Watts.  The gorgeous Amanda Jones is next introduced in the arms of her rich and popular boyfriend.  Amanda is played by the wonderful actress Lea Thompson.  Hardy Jenns, Amanda's snobbish and obnoxious boyfriend is played by Craig Sheffer.  Some may recognize him as the quarterback alongside James Caan in the awesome 1990's college football film, The Program. These four consist of the main force that drives this film.Keith works after school as an auto mechanic and gas station attendant saving money for his unknown future. When he is not working he spends his time either painting and illustrating or hanging out with his pal Watts.  Keith is an admirer of the popular and totally taken Amanda Jones.  His interest increases and he totally falls for her.  A glimmer of hope begins to shine for Keith when Amanda and her A hole of a boyfriend's relationship starts to crumble.  Keith consults his good friend Watts for advice in his quest for love.  She does not respond in kind and repeatedly explains to him that there is no chance for him to ever go out with Amanda who hangs out with the rich kids.  Hardy, Amanda's boyfriend realizes Keith's interest in his girlfriend and tensions start to build between them.  Tension increases between the frustrated good friend Watts and the clueless Keith as he continues to plan to win the heart of Amanda...If you want to know how this all ends you will have to see the movie.  No sense in ruining it for you.There has to be a definite mention of the high school bully Skinhead named Duncan.  He is awesomely played by Elias Koteas; a little reminiscent of a young De Niro at times.  There are a couple of scenes with a young Candace Cameron playing Keith's youngest sister; one where she is shuffling through some awesome Garbage Pail Kids cards.  Candace played the oldest sister on the show Full House.Interestingly there is a sneaky Rolling Stones theme throughout this film. The main character, Keith, is named after Keith Richards the legendary guitarist. Keith's best friend Watts who is an obsessed percussionist is named after the drummer from the Rolling Stones, Charlie Watts.  Last, but not least Amanda Jones is a Rolling Stones song and is used twice in the movie.  On another music note Chyna Phillips plays the other love interest of Amanda's boyfriend Hardy.  Chyna was part of the 90's band Wilson / Phillips and the daughter of Mamma & the Pappa's John and Michelle Phillips.Some Kind of Wonderful is a one of a kind; truly a great movie.  It did not reach the same status as Hughes' other classics.  Sadly this film was advertised poorly and many thought it was just a rehash of Pretty in Pink.  Regardless this was the last true teen masterpiece that Hughes made in the 80's.  Now there are a dime a dozen American Pie type clones thrown together that cannot tell a story as fraction as well as John Hughes could.  Sadly he is no longer around and passed away a few years back.  Luckily he left us with a great bunch of films that give us all a glimpse into the life of a teen and a view of the 80's.",5,Some Kind Of......

224022,A228JH8V9Y700G,6300218031,MortensOrchid,"[6, 7]","Perhaps it was under pressure that John Hughes made this movie, as the reaction to the end of Pretty In Pink caused such uproar.  This was, as so many have pointed out, the ending Pretty In Pink should have had; and, as it turned out, this would be John Hughes's last aclaimed teen dramedy (by both critics and audience) of the 80s.We are rooting for the overturn of social class and pecking orders once again in High School USA.  Keith, the artistic outcast soft boy, has been mooning over the prettiest, most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones.  Amanda Jones is the arm candy of the typical ego inflated Big Man on Campus, Hardy, and otherwise preoccupied.  The whole time, right under his nose, his friend Watts has been in love with him.  A star crossed lovers' triangle if there ever was one - or perhaps a square, or even another polygon as Hardy cheats.Keith decides to risk life and limb by crossing the social barriers and asks Amanda out.  Much to everyone's surprise, Amanda accepts (based out of revenge against Hardy's wandering eye), and the drama unfolds.  Watts is jealous enough that she offers to drive them.  Hardy is outraged enough that he attempts to reclaim his Big Man On Campus role by having his loyal minions beat him up and asert himself as the Alpha Male.  Everyone's friends and support systems are cheering or shunning them, and it all culminates on the night of the Big Date and The Party at Hardy's house.While this movie is full of cheesy quotes here and there, and knowing what I know now I wonder if in fact Watts was a little ""confused"" about her sexuality (she was pushing that butch thing a bit far), it has some heart to it.  Amanda Jones, while uses her feminine charms to get out of detention, isn't the shallow socialite she appears to be and shows that she has strength and character.  Watts, while pretending to be tough as nails and impervious, lets her jealousy show but puts it aside enough to let bygones be bygones.  And Keith, miracle of miracles, sees that Watts is the genuine article and he would prefer her over Amanda Jones.It's a wonderful thought - hence the title - but, knowing what I know now, I am cynical and somewhat embittered.  I wish I had a nickel for everyone who has chosen the wrong person over the right one, for everyone who has been disappointed, hurt or suffered a heartbreak, and for everyone who acted immaturely, selfish, and abusive.  Some of those people look back, realize their mistake and change for the better, but even more blame the other person and go on doing what they've been doing.  This movie had heart, and it showed us the right thing to do, which is why I gave it 4 stars.Why not 5?  I wish they had developed that side character of Duncan the Skinhead a little more.  He was threatening and sullen when they first introduced him, but once in detention with Keith became a loyal ally.  And once he rescues Keith from certain death at the popular kids' party I would've liked to see him and his posse trash the house.",4,By popular demand,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,3013,"['Perhaps', 'was', 'pressure', 'John', 'Hughes', 'made', 'movie', 'reaction', 'end', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'caused', 'such', 'uproar', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'ending', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'John', 'Hughes', 'last', 'aclaimed', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'critics', 'audience', '80s.We', 'are', 'rooting', 'overturn', 'social', 'class', 'pecking', 'orders', 'once', 'again', 'High', 'School', 'USA', 'Keith', 'artistic', 'outcast', 'soft', 'boy', 'been', 'mooning', 'prettiest', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Amanda', 'Jones', 'Amanda', 'Jones', 'arm', 'candy', 'typical', 'ego', 'inflated', 'Big', 'Man', 'Campus', 'Hardy', 'otherwise', 'preoccupied', 'whole', 'time', 'right', 'nose', 'friend', 'Watts', 'been', 'love', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'triangle', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'perhaps', 'square', 'even', 'polygon', 'Hardy', 'cheats.Keith', 'decides', 'risk', 'life', 'limb', 'crossing', 'social', 'barriers', 'asks', 'Amanda', 'out', 'Much', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Amanda', 'based', 'revenge', 'Hardy', 'wandering', 'eye', 'drama', 'Watts', 'jealous', 'enough', 'drive', 'Hardy', 'outraged', 'enough', 'reclaim', 'Big', 'Man', 'Campus', 'role', 'having', 'loyal', 'minions', 'beat', 'up', 'asert', 'Alpha', 'Male', 'Everyone', 'friends', 'support', 'systems', 'are', 'cheering', 'shunning', 'culminates', 'night', 'Big', 'Date', 'Party', 'Hardy', 'house.While', 'movie', 'full', 'cheesy', 'quotes', 'here', 'there', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'wonder', 'fact', 'Watts', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'was', 'pushing', 'butch', 'thing', 'bit', 'far', 'heart', 'Amanda', 'Jones', 'feminine', 'charms', 'get', 'detention', ""n't"", 'shallow', 'socialite', 'be', 'strength', 'character', 'Watts', 'pretending', 'be', 'tough', 'nails', 'impervious', 'jealousy', 'show', 'aside', 'enough', 'let', 'bygones', 'be', 'bygones', 'Keith', 'miracle', 'miracles', 'sees', 'Watts', 'genuine', 'article', 'would', 'prefer', 'Amanda', 'Jones.It', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'hence', 'title', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'am', 'cynical', 'somewhat', 'embittered', 'wish', 'had', 'nickel', 'everyone', 'who', 'chosen', 'wrong', 'person', 'right', 'one', 'everyone', 'who', 'been', 'disappointed', 'suffered', 'heartbreak', 'everyone', 'who', 'acted', 'immaturely', 'selfish', 'abusive', 'people', 'look', 'back', 'realize', 'mistake', 'change', 'better', 'even', 'more', 'blame', 'other', 'person', 'go', 'doing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'movie', 'had', 'heart', 'showed', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars.Why', 'not', '5', 'wish', 'had', 'developed', 'side', 'character', 'Duncan', 'Skinhead', 'little', 'more', 'was', 'threatening', 'sullen', 'when', 'first', 'introduced', 'once', 'detention', 'Keith', 'became', 'loyal', 'ally', 'once', 'Keith', 'certain', 'death', 'popular', 'kids', 'party', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'posse', 'trash', 'house']",Some Kind of Wonderful VHS

Eric Stoltz takes the place of Molly Ringwald and Lea Thompson &amp; Mary Stuart Masterson do the same for Andrew McCarthy &amp; Jon Cryer.  Mr. Stoltz plays Keith a loner, artistic type who works at a garage and whose best friend is a tom girl, drummer Watts played by Ms. Masterson.  Keith pines after Amanda Jones (Ms. Thompson), one of the most popular girls in school.  Amanda dates the spoiled rich boy Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer) and after they fight, Keith swoops in and asks Amanda for a date, to which she agrees.  Keith finds out that the whole date is just a setup to get him to Jenns' house so he can beat him up, he still continues with the date.  He sets an elaborate evening, dinner at a fancy restaurant, art museum after hours and a set of diamond earrings.  It turns out that Amanda isn't some spoiled rich girl, but a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who sold herself out for popularity.  All the while, Watts is secretly in love with Keith and in the end after a showdown at Jenns' house where he is exposed as a chicken and fraud, Keith realizes his true feelings for Watts and they kiss.  The movie is filled with nice performances by the three leads, but it is the supporting players that give the best performances.  John Ashton is perfectly gruff and pushing as Keith's dad, Maddie Corman is the classic, annoying younger sister, but Elias Koteas steals the show as Duncan, the school thug who befriends Keith.  Mr. Koteas throws out some classic lines.  This was the last film John Hughes would write or director in the classic 80's teen angst vein.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[12, 12]","John Hughes (here as producer) has always put together some films about teenagers that made them filled with interesting traits, true feelings and genuine situations. Though this film is a bit far-fetched, it has the best characters (tomboy, skinhead, nerd, popular girl in school, rich fool). I've loved Mary Stuart Masterson since this film, and have made an attempt to see everything she's done since. Lea Thompson had the hardest part, trying to be cool and ""real"" at the same time. Eric Stoltz was never better looking, truly handsome, belying his previous role in ""Mask"" and future independent film projects, as well as carrying the lead role with genuine confidence. Elias Koteas is a real delight as Duncan, the skinhead; later he was in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" as a romantic lead, and the great Terrence Malick used him to excellent advantage in ""The Thin Red Line"". This film really marks the beginning of many fine film careers. The use of current popular music in all of Hughes' films has always added to their appeal, as well as good writing. This was a little more brutal than ""16 Candles"", but it hit all the right nerves. Also, as a middle-aged baby boomer, the emotions involved, I must say, are as relevent now as then. It was also a pleasure to see John Ashton (""Beverly Hills Cop"") as the dad; he plays the bewildered authority figure very well.

Lea Thompson looks appetizing as Amanda Jones and for some reason dumps super cool rich kid Hardy Jens to go out with some dork who is friends with a drummer that looks like she digs chicks. Hardy Jens is pretty much me in high school, but with more money. I wasn't rich in high school, but I was incredibly good looking and carried myself with a quiet confidence that some called arrogance. In the real world, Lea Thompson would never have left me for a poor tool that likes to draw tippy the turtle. The only turtle she would have wanted to see was the giant tortuss in my pants. This movie is such a joke in that this isn't how the real world works. I'm sure some girl in Wisconsin loves this movie thinking that romance is alive and well. I hate to break the news, but hot girls like guys like me, JAbs,Kroll and Burns. They don't dig kids that are art geeks.

Its just about a every day, un popular kid (Eric Stolz) from a family of humble finances who gets the courage to ask the most popular and cutest girl out on a date. He wants to impress her to show that he is good enough for her.The characters are all wooden stereotypes with no development yet I root and hiss at themThe soundtrack is soooooo 1980's yet the songs make me move and gyrate, especially the new wave-ish ""Falling in Love""The ending is anti-climatic yet there is a certain charm to the ""what the heck"" attitude about the movie...like it does not need any type of climax.One of the reasons this movie works is b/c of the actors. Eric Stolz was way too nice of a guy, he never conveyed what he was feeling, yet you want him to succeed. He is immensely likeable.Craig sheffer makes a great smarmy rich kid villain.Mary Ann Stuartson was unbelievable in her role yet she still had a lot of charisma.Lea Thompson plays, what essentially was for the world of the movie, the most beautiful girl in the high school yet she's not that cute (go figure)The supporting cast added good comic relief especially the blue collar Dad, social status concerning sister.In summary, this movie makes a perfect guilty pleasure.

It's definitely a feel-good movie and the acting is wonderful. As cheesy as some scenes might be, the overall effect overcomes the cheese-meter.An introspective artist, a pretty rich girl and a smart-mouthed tom-boy look for love in all the wrong places until the end. Petty people become deep, true loves find one another... not exactly reality, but a great flick none-the-less.

I can't believe I liked it.&quot; Instead, I feel like I'm seeing it again for the first time.

This film didn't do as well in theaters as it could have because of the unconventional (read: weird) trailers that advertised the film. You just see bluejeans and a drummer hitting drums... I basically saw this film only because Eric Stoltz was in it... but I ended up adoring the film in spite of the cheesy trailer that promised nothing of substance.

There is no nudity or sexual inuendo. There is a kissing scene that might cause you to have to fan yourself, but it's a kiss and not heavy petting or anything. There is language, but not above or beyond what can be heard on &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot; The film shows the values in true friendships, self-sacrifice, and true love based on sacrifice - not on sex, beauty or money.

There's no doubt that Hughes was a marketing genius, in that he tapped into what his narcissistic market--white suburbia--wanted so hungrily to see, which was itself as the star of little morality plays with cool soundtracks and hipster clothes.  Certainly, this movie provides all that.  On the other hand, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" manages to do what other lesser-known Hughes productions do not:  create a story that is still universal and affecting, even after all these years.  Much of the credit goes to the two leads, Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, who each give understated and honest performances that are far more moving than their stereotypical characters generally deserve.  More sincere than the manipulative ""Pretty in Pink,"" more thoughtful than the mega-hit ""The Breakfast Club,"" and more meaningful than the fluffy ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" suffers mostly from bad timing--had it premiered a few years before Hughes had saturated the market with his cookie-cutter productions, it probably would have been a far bigger hit.  As it stands, this story of a genuinely nice kid chasing the wrong girl--with the conflicted help of the right girl, who loves him--rises above the standard plasticky fare of the period; you're truly moved by the end of the movie, rooting for its leads to find the love they undoubtedly deserve.  Even if it borrows from ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" and a host of other works--and pretends that minorities only exist as background extras in some other movie--""Some Kind of Wonderful"" stands on its own, perhaps because director Howard Deutch adds just a tinge of sadness to so many scenes, even the comic ones.

The performances were believable - the actors became the characters, not the other way around. Eric Stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who wants to pursue art instead of business. Mary Stuart Masterson is his best friend, a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him. Lea Thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty - and her boyfriend. Craig Scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend - and the only off note.Keith (Eric Stoltz) is interested in Amanda (Lea Thompson) and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend. To spite the boyfriend, she says yes. Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) predicts trouble and their friendship is tested. My favorite line from the movie is when Keith defends Amanda, claiming, ""You can't judge a book by its cover."" Watts cynically replies, ""Yeah, but you can tell how much it's gonna cost."" Finally Watts agrees to help Keith prepare for the date, including helping him ""practice kissing"" - and it's a doozy of a kiss.Throw in John Ashton as Keith's father, Maddie Corman as his meddlesome sister, and Elias Koteas as the scary guy Keith befriends in detention, and you have a ""wonderful"" movie.",5,My favorite movie kiss,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1414,"['was', 'teenager', '80', 'love', 'old', '80', 'teen', 'movies', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'top', 'three', 'performances', 'were', 'believable', 'actors', 'became', 'characters', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'level', 'headed', 'mechanic', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'literally', 'who', 'pursue', 'art', 'instead', 'business', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'best', 'friend', 'tomboy', 'drummer', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'made', 'inner', 'circle', 'popular', 'rich', 'kids', 'basis', 'beauty', 'boyfriend', 'Craig', 'Scheffer', 'rich', 'bully', 'boyfriend', 'only', 'note.Keith', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'interested', 'Amanda', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'opportunity', 'ask', 'out', 'when', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'spite', 'boyfriend', 'yes', 'Watts', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'trouble', 'friendship', 'tested', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'Keith', 'Amanda', 'claiming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Watts', 'cynically', 'Yeah', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'gon', 'cost', 'Finally', 'Watts', 'help', 'Keith', 'prepare', 'date', 'including', 'helping', 'practice', 'kissing', 'doozy', 'kiss.Throw', 'John', 'Ashton', 'Keith', 'father', 'Maddie', 'Corman', 'meddlesome', 'sister', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'scary', 'guy', 'Keith', 'detention', 'have', 'wonderful', 'movie']",Some Kind of Wonderful VHS

My fave scene in this movie has to be when the tough guys show up to help and the party, and how some of the rich girls liked them. It ended the way I wish it would, although I wonder if the money on those diamonds could have been put to better use, his girl would have loved him anyways.
