The second film, Kiss the Girls benefits from Ashley Judd's performance.  Overall, this is a very good purchaseand for a small cost.  Besides, Morgan Freeman brings a rare and wonderful quality to the films he does, makingthem very entertaining and enjoyable to see.",4,Films with Morgan Freeman,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,387,"['good', 'collection', 'films', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'better', 'thetwo', 'second', 'film', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'benefits', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'performance', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'purchaseand', 'small', 'cost', 'Besides', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'rare', 'wonderful', 'quality', 'films', 'makingthem', 'very', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'see']",Kiss The Girls / Along Came A Spider

1614704,A3DOCWNJH2NLA5,B00AP2DC94,"Praise The Lord, Always","[1, 3]","I gave this a 4-star because of the first movie: KISS THE GIRLS. I haven't read the book(s), so I don't know if they stayed true to them or not, but Mr. Patterson did enjoy the movie. At the beginning there is so much ""hop-scotching"" going on that it makes it difficult to follow the action and why they need to overuse the mobile camera and keep circling the actors  as the Indians did with the wagon trains of old, is beyond me. Once or twice, most of us can get the picture.  Now ALONG CAME A SPIDER was  directed much better and it made for a greater movie. It is sad that HELL-LYWOOD (not Hollywood anymore) needs to use such vulgar language that is only suited for our high-ranking politicians nowadays, as they will still get the ""R"" rating from the violence, which thankfully is not gory as in far too many movies. Both movie plots were very good and they will keep you guessing on who the real villains are. In KISS THE GIRLS, the ending scenes were NOT very real, as there is suppose to be a live gas line disconnected and nobody shuts the gas off!! If they cleaned up the language, both movies would be okay for T.V.. The quality of the DVDs are great as usual.  +JMJ+",4,It should have been better:,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,1179,"['gave', '4-star', 'first', 'movie', 'KISS', 'GIRLS', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 's', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stayed', 'true', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Patterson', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'beginning', 'so', 'much', 'hop-scotching', 'going', 'difficult', 'follow', 'action', 'why', 'need', 'overuse', 'mobile', 'camera', 'keep', 'circling', 'actors', 'Indians', 'did', 'wagon', 'trains', 'old', 'Once', 'twice', 'most', 'can', 'get', 'picture', 'Now', 'ALONG', 'CAME', 'A', 'SPIDER', 'was', 'directed', 'much', 'better', 'made', 'greater', 'movie', 'sad', 'HELL-LYWOOD', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'anymore', 'use', 'such', 'vulgar', 'language', 'only', 'suited', 'high-ranking', 'politicians', 'nowadays', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'violence', 'thankfully', 'not', 'gory', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'movie', 'plots', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'who', 'real', 'villains', 'are', 'KISS', 'THE', 'GIRLS', 'ending', 'scenes', 'were', 'NOT', 'very', 'real', 'suppose', 'be', 'live', 'gas', 'line', 'disconnected', 'nobody', 'gas', 'cleaned', 'up', 'language', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'T.V..', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'are', 'great', 'usual', '+JMJ+']",Kiss The Girls / Along Came A Spider
