258919,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6301628500,Andrew McCaffrey,"[9, 13]","On the recent DVD release of THE SEEDS OF DEATH, the picture quality looks absolutely phenomenal, thanks to the VIDFIRE treatment and from the painstaking effort placed in cleaning each frame.  It's a pity the same remedies couldn't have been applied to the script, as it surely could have benefited from having a few of the rough spots removed.  Terrance Dicks often complains that six-part Who stories were difficult to do without resorting to padding, and it's easy to nod alongside him.  Still, this was the first time I watched the serial in episode format and that helped.  By limiting myself to two episodes a sitting stretched over several days, I didn't let the viewing become tedious.  The best I can say is that it isn't boring, which isn't an enormous compliment, but it's enough.One way you could look at the structure of much of this story is as a reworking of the basic base-under-siege pattern that was so prevalent and successful.  However, instead of a base, we're presented with a small storeroom; the Ice Warriors effortless capture the entire outpost within minutes rather than (as in the past) not managing it until later episodes, or, indeed, ever.  But this actually works, as the storeroom is a convincingly confined set, and you can really believe they these people are pinned in here hiding from great danger lurking in the corridors.As with many serials from the era, the production is a mixture of silliness and splashes of surprisingly effectiveness.  The sets are quite good, and the director successfully makes it appear that there's more than one corridor on the moonbase.  As for the silliness, well, other reviewers have mocked the characters' ""nappy-wear"" costumes, but it looked to me more like some joker had darkened their visible panty lines with permanent marker.  I concur with the opinion stated many times on the DVD commentary track: ""Not really flattering, no.""One of the major negatives is the story rests so heavily on a hokey piece of fictional technology.  T-Mat is the equivalent of Star Trek's transporter, allowing anyone in the world to beam to anywhere else in the world by bouncing a signal off the moon (presumably it only works on half the planet at a time, but this isn't addressed).  The world's supply of hamburgers and Chicken McNuggets are delivered via this medium, so a slight delay means starvation for millions.  So naturally, this vital, irreplaceable technology is all controlled through one sloppily organized (the opening scene shows the world's food supply delayed by five minutes because of one mistake) point, a relay station.  This design flaw becomes most apparent when the aliens invade and start stomping through it.I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the directing in this episode.  On one hand, Michael Ferguson does a great job with some short individual scenes.  There are set pieces with a lot of tension.  That parallel zoom-in thing he does is very effective.  But the overall story never feels real or dangerous.  The threat from the Ice Warrior's oh-so-dastardly plan remains a little too abstract in tone.  There's no real tension from it; I never felt the characters or the world were seriously in jeopardy.  Yet I was able to easily accept that they were in immediate danger from, say, the soldier shooting at them.  That stated, I did like the way the plot (where there is of it) unfolds.  The Ice Warriors plan is multi-staged, and we get to see them constantly one step ahead of everyone.The places where the story works best are where focus is placed on its human components.  The regular cast and the guest actors play it all very nicely and believably (a few wooden extras aside).  Terry Scully as Fewsham gets a lot of deserved credit for playing the collaborator whose conscience is slowly eating away at him.  Harry Towb steals the show quite nicely... until he's killed off after a scant ten minutes.  The Earth-based characters play off each other well, too.  I really like the scene where Phillip Ray's Professor Eldred fusses over the would-be-Astronauts while the Doctor gently humors him.Speaking of the Doctor, I think a large part of what makes SEEDS watchable is that I simply love this Doctor-companion combination.  I'd watch them in anything.  A little remarked upon scene comes near the end, where the defeated Ice Lord orders his heavy to destroy the Doctor.  Patrick Troughton calmly closes his eyes, his character peacefully preparing for death.  Until he suddenly spots Jamie in harm's way and leaps across a table to spoil the warrior's aim.  It's nicely underplayed, which is classic Troughton.THE SEEDS OF DEATH isn't terribly good.  But ironically, the DVD of it is, simply because of the wealth of material on it that isn't THE SEEDS OF DEATH.  The SSSOWING THE SSSEEDSS documentary is relatively interesting, although if one were being unkind, one could simply sum up the 25 minutes with the sentence: ""The costumes were uncomfortable.""  The Censor Clips and The Last Dalek thing are diverting enough, though I'm not sure if I'll ever feel the need to watch them again without a story to go around them.While watching the main story, I wrote down many jokes and then had to erase them when I listened to the commentary track, because Terrance Dicks had already made them.  I have no bad things to say about this commentary.  All you need to know is that good old Uncle Terry is on it, which automatically places it in the top-tier.",3,The Dying Days,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,5463,"['recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE',

Unfortunately, this was probably not one of his best stories. This was one  of those Doctor Who adventures originally released in the 1980's that was  edited to be a full length movie. This technique has never set very well  with me. It also makes the episode seem ten times longer than it really is.  The storyline is too slow moving that you feel like you're being lulled to  sleep.

258924,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6301628500,Crazy Fox,"[1, 1]","Leave it to ""Doctor Who"" to take that most hackneyed of science fiction concepts, a Martian invasion of Earth, and actually make it fresh and interesting. But the idea of an unselfconscious overdependence on technology backfiring when it breaks down or is sabotaged (I'm reminded of things like the Y2K scare here) and the theme of biological warfare (WMDs, anyone?) both seem as startlingly contemporary as the 1960's vision of the future represented here seems nostalgically dated (but fun). And if the actual rendering of the Martian Ice Warriors costume-wise hasn't stood the test of time so well, the portrayal of a rigidly hierarchical, militaristic society backed into a corner by the dying of their own world and so striving to colonize another works remarkably well and is rather believable. Of course, the idea of cold-blooded reptilians who thrive in low temperatures and to whom heat is deadly seems scientifically worrisome, but oh never mind. They sure act cold-blooded anyway.There's some fine acting from the supporting cast here, and that does wonders in helping one suspend one's disbelief when faced with some of the shakier elements of the storyline. Patrick Troughton is in absolutely top form as the second Doctor, bumbling about absent-mindedly but saving the day with his scientific genius, goofy and lovable but ready to fry Ice Warriors into lizard pudding and lure their armadas into the sun if they insist on being aggressors (and to think the sixth Doctor took so much flak for shooting down a couple of Cybermen). Rational, intellectual Zoe and stout, strong-armed Jamie create a fine balance among the main characters, and their warmth and chemistry with the Doctor seems convincingly natural--the three of them make for what might possibly be one of the most compelling combinations in the history of the show, and that's saying a lot.This is a six-parter, and I've found that watching these all at once makes the plot seem ploddingly slow but that watching a few at a time over a couple of days fixes this problem. Which only makes sense after all, since these episodes were originally intended to be watched one at a time on a weekly basis and were paced with that in mind. As for the DVD itself, some of the footage included here as extras can also be found on the ""Lost in Time"" DVD set and seems more at home there, and the ones specific to ""Seeds of Death"" don't quite seem to justify a second disc and the corresponding price increase. But overall that shouldn't deter anyone from adding this classic ""Doctor Who"" storyline to their collection.",4,"""You can't kill me...

258928,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,6301628500,Jason A. Miller,"[12, 16]","I made up my mind to leave Ohio in January 1999, and moved six weeks later.  I somehow got wrapped up in a very intense relationship during those six weeks, knowing quite well in retrospect that it was never going to work once I left the state for good.  However, she was a ""Doctor Who"" fan, and so was I.  You just don't let these rare connections drift by.  We spent a good portion of our time together watching my Season 6 Patrick Troughton videotapes (getting far as Episode 4 of ""The War Games"" until the inevitable happened).  The only disagreement we ever had (apart from the move) was on the quality of ""The Seeds of Death"".  She thought it was enjoyable fun.  I thought it was a dull slog.  Maybe that's why we didn't last.  Was I being too critical?""Seeds of Death"" has always been on the lower region of my own ""Doctor Who"" rankings.  On paper I should love it: I'm a fan of ""The Ice Warriors"" and ""The Curse of Peladon"", two other stories featuring the same villainous Martian marauders.  I similarly have great fondness for the Season 6 Doctor/companion pairing.  Fraser Hines almost never embarrassed himself as an actor during three long seasons.  Wendy Padbury, of course, is a doll.  Archaic word, but it actually fits.  Cutest face ever.Each of Patrick Troughton's stories -- whether you're watching on TV or merely listening to the surviving audio -- is a seminar on how to play ""Doctor Who"".  You can always count on Troughton for a riveting mixture of physical clowning and top-tier problem solving -- usually at the same time.  ""Seeds of Death"" is notable for a shockingly well-directed madcap chase sequence in Episode 3, as Troughton runs back and forth down the same lone corridor set, making it seem as if he's running for miles.  He slips and slides, turns and twists, and does comic double-takes at every distorted mirror reflection.  Finally, when the Ice Warriors have him cornered... he talks his way out of it: ""Your leader will be very cross with you if you kill me.... I'm a genius!""However, ""Seeds of Death"" itself never tickled my imagination the way other stories did.  The Ice Warriors, let's face it, aren't well-used here.  Slaar (Alan Bennion, who played three different Ice Lords across the years and gave each of them distinct shadings) is only allowed to stand around a control room on the Moon and terrify a dwindling cast of stock BBC actors.  The most interesting of these (Harry Towb) is killed off after ten minutes.  There's a lot to be said for Terry Scully's nebbishy performance as Fewsham, the moonbase technician who turns traitor to save his own life until he finally summons up the courage to redeem himself with a noble act of self-sacrifice.  However, we've seen this performance many other times across the years, so the hurdle is set high.  His best moment is the scene in Episode 5, after Fewsham's already made up his mind to betray the Ice Warriors: he's seen standing alone, frowning, wringing his hands, waiting for Slaar to find him.  That's quite a good shot.The DVD builds up a solid case that this story is a neglected Troughton gem.  The crowded commentary track features the companions (Hines and Padbury) making cogent remarks about the action -- when they're not busy laughing at Troughton's clowning or about their own slips and line fluffs.  Much is made of Jamie's frequent groping of Zoe.  You can always count on this reaction when someone asks what it was like to work with the late Troughton: ""Ohhhhh"" (Similarly, when asked what William Hartnell was like, the reaction is a less enthusiastic ""Well..."").  Director Michael Ferguson delivers a good account of how he direct ed the story.  Since he's speaking 34 years later, it's impressive that he remembers what he does.  Script editor Terrance Dicks should be allowed on every commentary track, even for the stories he didn't oversee.  The commentary picks up intensity once he shows up for Episode 3.  If you don't have time to listen to two hours of actor ramblings, the one episode to listen to is Episode 4, where Ferguson and Dicks discuss the story alone.A long featurette, amusingly called ""Sssowing the Ssseeds"", describes how the Ice Warrior costumes were made, and three actors tell us what it was like to work in them.  Speaking of costumes, the VidFIRE process that restores the episodes to their original videotape look, works so vividly that you can actually count the paint brushstrokes on the Ice Warrior helmets.  The other extras on the bonus disc do not pertain to ""Seeds"" specifically, but provide archival footage from a dozen other ""Troughton"" stories that no longer exist.I find the production-note option increasingly tiresome when Richard Molesworth is the writer.  His formula seems to be: provide all the other acting credits of all the other actors in the guest cast; give us the day and the location of the filming of all the model shots; and describe the originally conceived plot of the episode.  Only the last of those three items interests me.  It's possible to provide fresh text commentary for decades-old ""Doctor Who"" stories -- see Martin Wiggins' contributions -- so I think Molesworth could depart from the formula without hurting anyone.At this point in my life, with new ""Doctor Who"" a year away, I am never going to fall in love with ""The Seeds of Death"".  I may never watch it again.  However, the DVD series, with their focus on what *works* (and, more importantly, by getting the story's actors and production team to laugh at the shortcomings), serve the important task of rehabilitating the less-remembered stories, and work hard to dispute the notion that ""Doctor Who"" was always done on the cheap, without thought.  Fair enough.  Job well done.  Next DVD, please.",4,End-stage Troughton,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,5745,"['made', 'up', 'mind', 'leave', 'Ohio', 'January', '1999', 'moved', 'six', 'weeks', 'later', 'somehow', 'got', 'wrapped',

It introduces the T-Mat, Doctor Who's version of Star Trek's Transporter, and provides an interesting commentary on what happens when we get too comfortable in our lives.  Not to mention that the technology became one of the few examples of continuity through most of the series.  There's some great moments for the Doctor here as well, especially one scene where he is rapidly trying to prevent a ""seed"" from bursting by pouring just about everything in a beaker he can get his hands on as fast as he can.  While some of the acting is a bit flat and the special effects were dated even when the episode was new (It's kind of hard not to giggle when someone appears on the T-Mat and the entire scene jumps a few inches to one side), the script is reasonably solid and most of the performances are quite enjoyable.
