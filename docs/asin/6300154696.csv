Brings back such sweet memories. Today, as I am working  towards a future career as a cartoonist and an animator, Chuck Jones is now  one of my &quot;mentors&quot; and a great influence on the next generation  of cartoon geniuses!",5,One of the most favorite cartoons of my childhood,946684800,"01 1, 2000",2000,529,"['When', 'was', 'small', 'girl', 'living', '1970s', 'would', 'air', 'cartoon', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'animated', 'shorts', 'masterful', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'frequently', 'TV', 'show', 'special', 'oh', 'would', 'always', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'such', 'endearing', 'white', 'seal', 'wonderfully', 'mischievous', 'mongoose', 'time', 'Brings', 'back', 'such', 'sweet', 'memories', 'Today', 'am', 'working', 'future', 'career', 'cartoonist', 'animator', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'now', 'one', 'quot', 'mentors', 'quot', 'great', 'influence', 'next', 'generation', 'cartoon', 'geniuses']",White Seal VHS

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 9]","I saw this show on TV eons ago.It's the story of a sweet little white seal, Kotick, seen as an oddity by his fellows, but definitely not  inferior. Because of his aloneness, Kotick sees more around him than the  others, and must attempt to save them from seal-hunters.There's a sweet  little substory about Kotick's relationship with his father--you'll want to  kick Dad at the beginning, and give him a friendly whap on the head at the  end.An adorable little cartoon that won't make you throw up!

I do enjoy Chuck Jones, and you can certainly see a few of his touches throughout this movie, even if you don't really try to find them.  The movie is okay, but not the best thing I have ever seen in my life.  A little sappy, and only 30 minutes long.  I really like the Bugs Bunny stuff better, but I gave it 4 stars because my kids really do like it, and sometimes you don't have time for a 90 minute movie (especially near bedtime!) if they ask to watch ""one more"" this (or Rikki Tikki Tavi) is a fine choice.",4,"My kids like it...I can watch it, too.",1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,589,"['never', 'remember', 'seeing', 'child', 'watched', 'LOTS', 'television', 'too', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'few', 'touches', 'movie', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'find', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'best', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'little', 'sappy', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'stuff', 'better', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'kids', 'really', 'do', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'especially', 'bedtime', 'ask', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'Rikki', 'Tikki', 'Tavi', 'fine', 'choice']",White Seal VHS
