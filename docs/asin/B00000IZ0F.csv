505372,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00000IZ0F,bookloversfriend,"[35, 38]","It would be a shame if only Dolly Parton fans saw this movie.  They will like it, of course, but anyone who likes wholesome family feel-good movies will like it too.  Dolly has one week to bring a hurt and alienated family back together again, and this father, son and daughter are a challenge even to a good-hearted infectious spirit like Dolly.  The set-backs are believable, and how she finally does it is believable.I wish I could give the movie a perfect score, and the rest of the movie is so good, it almost deserves it.  But if you're NOT a fan, the first scene is likely to dampen your response to most of the rest of the movie (until you realize that the rest of the movie is not at all like the first scene).  I urge you to skip this scene on your first viewing.  The story does not start until scene 2 anyway, so you're not missing any story.  On the Image DVD, you can just start with track 2.  If you don't, you'll feel that this is a three-star movie and you'll be sure that your friendly reviewer is totally besotted to think that merely cutting the first scene would make any difference.The end too is regretable--not the end of the story, that ends beautifully and credibly.  But the movie doesn't stop.  It keeps going, and the audience is treated to a rock-country version of (I'm afraid to say it) the Hallelujah Chorus.  Now, this may be some viewers' cup of beer, but others will throw up.  So, depending on your taste, stop the movie when the story is wrapped up.  Don't sour your experience by sitting through that musical atrocity.If you make these two cuts, you'll be giving this movie 5-plus stars and wondering what is wrong with your friendly reviewer that he couldn't see it that way.  And one final tip: if you like this type of story, check out Little House on the Prairie Christmas edition, Mary Christmas, and I'll Be Home for Christmas(1997).  And if you read books, try A Thanksgiving Miracle.  Other movies and books of this type, I'm sure you're already familiar with.If you're a student of film or a screenwriter, watch the movie both ways (with the cuts and without) to discover the enormous effects that a bad scene can have on the REST OF the movie.

Having hugely enjoyed her big screen debut in ""Nine to Five"", I've followed her busy career ever since. There is something about her whole person that to me seems inherently decent and down to earth, which I find very appealing despite her often exaggerated public persona. She fits in perfectly to a Christmas themed story and apparently Dolly herself also feels that way as she has appeared now in two warmly regarded Christmas offerings in the wonderful ""Smoky Mountain Christmas"" (should be on DVD!), and this one titled ""Unlikely Angel"". Dolly plays a character that doesn't stray too far from what we normally associate with all things ""Dolly"", but she does great work with an admittedly thin story aided superbly by legendary actor Roddy McDowell as St. Peter, or just ""Peter"", as he asks to be called in the story. After dying in a car crash Dolly must perform a selfless good deed before Christmas arrives so that she can earn her wings and enter Heaven and she is sent by St. Peter to reunite a shattered and emotionally crippled family headed by Brian Kerwin. The family is falling apart after the death of Kerwin's wife and mother to his two children when Dolly takes on the role of ""Nanny"". With a slight resemblance to ""The Sound of Music"", which this film also includes a very funny reference to, Dolly not only reunites the shattered family after many set backs, but in the process earns her wings because of the better person she has also become in the process. Certainly ""Unlikely Angel"", is no masterpiece with the family problems being resolved perhaps a little too easily, however this telelvision movie is a delight to watch and from this year will become a staple in my regular Christmas viewing.

It was her second Holiday telefim, the first being ABC's ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"" that aired in 1986. In this outing Dolly plays a selfish, unforgiving bar singer who winds up dead in a car crash. In order to get her angel wings and receive entrance into Heaven she must return to earth and help out a family during the Holidays. The family is very dysfunctional as the two children have no mother, are too busy playing video games and watching soap operas, and the father is caught up running his business rather than care for his kids. It's up to Dolly to pull this clan together before she can be with God.""Unlikely Angel"" is a remarkably good made-for-TV movie, even better than Dolly's first Christmas film. The script is strong and the performances are wonderful, especially Dolly and the great Roddy McDowall who plays St. Peter. This would be Roddy's final performance before his death.The movie also features two new Dolly-written compositions, ""Unlikely Angel"" and ""Whatcha Tryin' To Do To Me?"". Unfortunately, Dolly has never recorded those for commercial release, yet are two of her best Holiday songs.Dolly has done many Holiday-themed projects in her career besides ""Unlikely Angel"" and ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"" (the later of which has only been released in the U.S. via VHS and Asia through DVD only). She starred with Kenny Rogers in the blockbuster ""A Christmas To Remember"" on CBS in 1984 and she had her own solo Christmas special in 1990 called ""Home For Christmas"" on ABC that starred her family. Both specials have never seen a DVD release, but there are many copies recorded from TV airings floating around the internet.An interesting sidenote: Dolly actually suffered from bruises while doing this movie. In the scene where she is floating as an angel the producers had her tied to a crane while dangling her in the air attached to a rope.
