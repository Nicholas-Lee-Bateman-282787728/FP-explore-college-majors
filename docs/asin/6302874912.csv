It was innovative in that it kept its faithfulness to the stage play and didn't sell out to standard Hollywood fair. Broadway's finest plays often have had more of an intellectual appeal, and therefore Hollywood often times had to ""adjust"" them to make them marketable to general audiences who weren't so intellectual. (Just check out the way the early 50s film of THE GLASS MENAGERIE nearly destroyed  the Tennessee Williams play, or the way producers had to mercilessly sanitize the late 50s film of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.) The uniqueness of this play/movie is that it not plot driven but rather more character driven; not a lot happens, yet strongly and brilliantly fleshed out characters make it a masterwork, and that's the nature of the piece.",5,Landmark drama for a 50s film,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,933,"['MEMBER', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'was', 'landmark', 'era', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'sentimental', 'melodramatic', 'else', 'full', 'spectacle', 'order', 'compete', 'television', 'was', 'coming', 'age', 'was', 'innovative', 'kept', 'faithfulness', 'stage', 'play', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'out', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fair', 'Broadway', 'finest', 'plays', 'often', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'intellectual', 'appeal', 'therefore', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'times', 'had', 'adjust', 'make', 'marketable', 'general', 'audiences', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'intellectual', 'Just', 'check', 'out', 'way', 'early', '50s', 'film', 'THE', 'GLASS', 'MENAGERIE', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'way', 'producers', 'had', 'mercilessly', 'sanitize', 'late', '50s', 'film', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', 'uniqueness', 'play/movie', 'not', 'plot', 'driven', 'rather', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'not', 'lot', 'yet', 'strongly', 'brilliantly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'make', 'masterwork', 'nature', 'piece']",N/A

It's boxed with four other Kramer films, in which I have little interest, but Hey! at least it's on DVD!This film adaptation of Carson McCullers' coming of age story features wonderful performances by Ethel Waters - a luminous screen presence - and a young Julie Harris as tomboy Frankie, along with an excellent supporting cast. This is a poignant and excellent film that depicts a portion of everyone's life that we need not to forget, if not for ourselves, for those in the throes of it, now and to come.

I agree that it certainly is a classic movie from that time. I found it somewhat depressing, not only because it was  filmed in black-and-white and has so many nightime scenes, but also because  two of the three main characters live mostly miserable lives.The plot is  that of a 12-year-old girl who has been struck by the worst case of  adolescent craziness. Her peers have dumped her (possibly because of her  constant talking and questionable attitude). She unloads (for most of the  movie) on Bernice, the family's housekeeper. Frankie's plan is to to run  away with her older brother and his new wife just as soon as the rice hits  the air! One really good scene is when Frankie ends one of her lengthy  diatribes on life. Little John Henry then suddenly starts the trio singing  &quot;His Eye Is On The Sparrow&quot;. The room continues to darken as they  sing. (And Brandon De Wilde did not need  anyone to lip-sync for  him!)You need to experience this movie just to see if it depresses you  as badly as it did me.

Rejected by her peer group, she decides she will join her brother and his future bride on their honeymoon and go with them forever.  The family housekeeper, Bernice, played by Ethel Waters, tries to convince her otherwise, but Frankie is strong willed and won't be deterred.  Julie Harris gives an intense, painfully honest performance as the struggling adolescent, hitting all the emotional peaks and valleys with such feeling and truth.  As Frankie's pseudo-mother, Waters is equally impressive, delivering a charismatic, deeply felt performance that provides the film's emotional centre.  The film definitely betrays its stage origins, with a lot of dialogue and little change in scene or action.

This is a great, great movie made from filming the original stage players at their work.  I hope it will soon be on an affordable DVD so I can watch it again and again and again.  Oh, and by the way, I was not a member of the wedding of my brother, but he did ask me to serve the cake.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[23, 24]","Perhaps Julie Harris was a bit old to play this role, but she has definitely channeled her remarkable resources to create one of the finest interpretations ever immortalized on film. An established stage personality, Julie re-created her Broadway role (as did Brandon de Wilde & Ethel Waters), and the ensemble re-creation is mystifying and powerful.Fred Zinnemann's direction kept pace, genuine care and generous close-ups of the constant intimacy of the bittersweet procedings. Ms. Harris received an Oscar nomination for this, her first film. The next year she made ""I Am a Camera"" (the basis for ""Cabaret"") where she played Sally Bowles with vigor and aplomb. Wow! In '55 she played Abra in Elia Kazan's ""East of Eden"", which was James Dean's film debut. Everyone said she was too old to play that role. Julie plays well in black & white, transcending any semblence of age. ""Eden"" was in color, and it just wasn't the same. This was also Brandon de Wilde's film debut, and the following year he received a nomination for ""Shane"". Those were the only nominations Julie & Brandon ever received. No question they were great performers. Mr. de Wilde couldn't seem to go on to adult roles, and the result was unfortunate. Knowing all this, and watching ""The Member of the Wedding"" tonite on TCM, I'm craving a DVD of this wonderful, heart-felt film. It was remade in 1997 with the wonderful Jena Malone, but the gut-reaction simply wasn't the same.

342623,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302874912,Westley,"[4, 6]","""The Member of the Wedding"" is based on the brilliant book (and later play) by Carson McCullers.  The stage play starred the same cast in the three main roles - Julie Harris (Frankie), Ethel Waters (Bernice), and Brandon de Wilde (John Henry).  Frankie is a 12-year-old southern girl who is misunderstood by her peers and somewhat ignored by her business-owner widowed father.  She spends her days idling with her 6-year-old cousin, John Henry, and the family cook, Bernice.  Frankie is starting to experience the kind of alienation common in young girls; she idealizes everything and her attempts to feel special are thwarted by reality.  When her older brother (Jarvis) returns from the military and announces his upcoming wedding, Frankie goes moony and plans on running away with Jarvis and his fianc&eacute;.  She's finally found a way of making herself part of a ""we.""  All she really wants is a place to belong; however, that's going to be tricky.Keeping the same Broadway cast for a movie was somewhat unusual at the time - even the classic ""Streetcar Named Desire"" booted Jessica Tandy in favor of Vivian Leigh.  Ethel Waters and Brandon de Wilde come across beautifully with finely nuanced performances.  Julie Harris' performance, on the other hand, is extremely ""theatrical.""  Obviously, stage performances do not always translate to film, which emphasizes close-ups and increased intimacy.  Furthermore, Harris was 25 years old and looks not a day under 30, and she just isn't believable as a young girl.  Nevertheless, she was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award, losing to another stage actress, Shirley Booth.Eventually, the elements come together to form a fine film.  In particular, the direction (Fred Zinnemann) and amazing writing shine through nicely.  Overall, ""The Member of the Wedding"" is a solid and enjoyable coming of age story.  I just wish that I believed that Frankie was truly ""coming of age"" and not headed toward middle-age.",4,"""They are the we of me""",1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1968,"['Member', 'Wedding', 'based', 'brilliant', 'book', 'later', 'play', 'Carson', 'McCullers', 'stage', 'play', 'starred', 'same', 'cast', 'three', 'main', 'roles', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Frankie', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'Bernice', 'Brandon', 'de', 'Wilde', 'John', 'Henry', 'Frankie', '12-year-old', 'southern', 'girl', 'who', 'misunderstood', 'peers', 'somewhat', 'ignored', 'business-owner', 'widowed', 'father', 'days', 'idling', '6-year-old', 'cousin', 'John', 'Henry', 'family', 'cook', 'Bernice', 'Frankie', 'starting', 'experience', 'kind', 'alienation', 'common', 'young', 'girls', 'everything', 'attempts', 'feel', 'special', 'are', 'thwarted', 'reality', 'When', 'older', 'brother', 'Jarvis', 'military', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Frankie', 'moony', 'plans', 'running', 'away', 'Jarvis', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'finally', 'found', 'way', 'making', 'part', 'really', 'place', 'belong', 'however', 'going', 'be', 'tricky.Keeping', 'same', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'time', 'even', 'classic', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'booted', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'favor', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'Brandon', 'de', 'Wilde', 'come', 'beautifully', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'performance', 'other', 'hand', 'extremely', 'theatrical', 'Obviously', 'stage', 'performances', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'translate', 'film', 'close-ups', 'increased', 'intimacy', 'Furthermore', 'Harris', 'was', '25', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'day', '30', 'just', ""n't"", 'believable', 'young', 'girl', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'losing', 'stage', 'actress', 'Shirley', 'Booth.Eventually', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'fine', 'film', 'particular', 'direction', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'amazing', 'writing', 'shine', 'nicely', 'Overall', 'Member', 'Wedding', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'just', 'wish', 'believed', 'Frankie', 'was', 'truly', 'coming', 'age', 'not', 'headed', 'middle-age']",N/A
