We are left with several questions and the sense that there is more to the story.On the bright side, the character designs are awesome and the story is fairly original. I like how Ohri, being a mute at the beginning, has to speak with those boxes that RPG game characters use. Cute!If you have ever seen (or heard of) the video game series/OAV series &quot;Angelique&quot;, then you will find that some of the characters (just Olivier, really) look like a cross between several &quot;Angie&quot; characters. My best friend pointed that out and I have never been able to watch it Gestalt without thinking that.So, please watch this, but understand that it is NOT the whole series.",4,Good but incomplete,1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,806,"['Gestalt', 'beautifully', 'done', 'show', 'entertaining', 'action-filled', 'humorous', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'been', 'finished', 'are', 'left', 'several', 'questions', 'sense', 'more', 'story.On', 'bright', 'side', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'awesome', 'story', 'fairly', 'original', 'how', 'Ohri', 'being', 'mute', 'beginning', 'speak', 'boxes', 'RPG', 'game', 'characters', 'use', 'Cute', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'video', 'game', 'series/OAV', 'series', 'quot', 'Angelique', 'quot', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'just', 'Olivier', 'really', 'look', 'cross', 'several', 'quot', 'Angie', 'quot', 'characters', 'best', 'friend', 'pointed', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'Gestalt', 'thinking', 'that.So', 'please', 'watch', 'understand', 'NOT', 'whole', 'series']",N/A
195466,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,1890228796,Carl Malmstrom,"[13, 13]","Companies like Media Blasters and ADV seem to have an odd talent for acquiring OAV (direct-to-video) series that never finished their run.  &quot;Ninja Cadets&quot;, &quot;My Dear Marie&quot;, &quot;Dragoon&quot;: the list is distressingly long and &quot;Gestalt&quot; only adds to it.  To make matters more confusing, this is obviously a series that has its grounding in a video game that was never released in the US.The story is a bit confusing if harmless and unresolved.  The characters obviously inhabit a world that was thought out pretty thoroughly by someone at some point, but we the American audience aren't given more than the basics of the world and its dynamics.  Media Blasters could have done well to include a background information section on this DVD.  It's a shame they didn't.The story itself is cute if somewhat odd.  It begins with a priest leaving his order so he can go south to the closed, forbidden land of Gestalt (which is only referred to as &quot;G&quot; for reasons of superstition).  Well, along the way he helps out a town and is given a mute slave girl as a gift (no, this is not going quite the way you think).  He's attacked by the person that was sent to bring him back to the order, he lifts her curse of muteness, she defeats his would-be bounty hunter, they start to fall for each other, etc.  You can kind of mentally fill in the blanks yourself for the next 45 minutes of screen time.From a technical aspect, the disc is perfectly fine.  The CG work in the episodes comes out well in DVD format and the layout is nice, even if they extras are pretty much restricted to an art gallery.On the whole, it's a nice, light, if somewhat strange disc.  It's a shame they don't take the story further, but I would assume that's the purpose of the Japanese video game.  If you're looking for something light and more-or-less romantic, I guess you'd do okay by getting this, but I wouldn't recommend jumping to get it right away if you're looking for the next hit anime title.",3,Yet Another Incomplete OAV Series...,981763200,"02 10, 2001",2001,2008,"['Companies', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'ADV', 'seem', 'have', 'odd', 'talent', 'acquiring', 'OAV', 'direct-to-video', 'series', 'never', 'finished', 'run', 'quot', 'Ninja', 'Cadets', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dear', 'Marie', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dragoon', 'quot', 'list', 'distressingly', 'long', 'quot', 'Gestalt', 'quot', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'confusing', 'obviously', 'series', 'grounding', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'US.The', 'story', 'bit', 'confusing', 'harmless', 'unresolved', 'characters', 'obviously', 'inhabit', 'world', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'pretty', 'thoroughly', 'someone', 'point', 'American', 'audience', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'more', 'basics', 'world', 'dynamics', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'include', 'background', 'information', 'section', 'DVD', 'shame', ""didn't.The"", 'story', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'priest', 'leaving', 'order', 'can', 'go', 'south', 'closed', 'forbidden', 'land', 'Gestalt', 'only', 'referred', 'quot', 'G', 'quot', 'reasons', 'superstition', 'Well', 'way', 'out', 'town', 'given', 'mute', 'slave', 'girl', 'gift', 'not', 'going', 'quite', 'way', 'think', 'attacked', 'person', 'was', 'sent', 'bring', 'back', 'order', 'curse', 'muteness', 'would-be', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'start', 'fall', 'other', 'etc', 'can', 'kind', 'mentally', 'fill', 'blanks', 'next', '45', 'minutes', 'screen', 'technical', 'aspect', 'disc', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'CG', 'work', 'episodes', 'out', 'well', 'DVD', 'format', 'layout', 'nice', 'even', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'restricted', 'art', 'gallery.On', 'whole', 'nice', 'light', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'disc', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'story', 'further', 'would', 'assume', 'purpose', 'Japanese', 'video', 'game', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'light', 'more-or-less', 'romantic', 'guess', ""'d"", 'do', 'okay', 'getting', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'jumping', 'get', 'right', 'away', ""'re"", 'looking', 'next', 'hit', 'anime', 'title']",N/A

Yep, people, Gestalt is great, but if you wanna know the entire story, you're gonna have to buy the manga, which doesn't have a commercial release in the U.S., or, as far as I can tell, any release in the U.S., period.Olivier (pronounced O-li-vee-ay; it's French!) is a young priest (at least from the general POV - I estimate he's 20-something.) who is beginning to doubt his faith.  So, he decided to go to the forbidden island of G.  Will his superior, Father Messiah, say ""Okay, no problem""?  Nope!  Instead, he hires the dark elf, Suzu, to track down Olivier and bring him home.Meanwhile, Olivier is staying in an inn in a small town (try saying that five times fast!).  In return for a miracle, the innkeeper gives him a mute slave girl.  That's all I'll divulge for now...get the video!Gestalt is excellent.  The animation and character designs are beautiful, complete with plenty of drool-worthy bishonen.  The plot, as far as I can tell, is great.  My biggest complaints are a) the incompleteness and b) Suzu's voice is *obnoxious*.  But those are easily overlooked, and other than that, it's great, including the dubbing.  Wendee Lee, a well-known dub VA plays Ohri.  I highly recommend this if you want comedy, action, and bishonen!",5,Excellent with one problem...,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,1264,"['incomplete', 'Yep', 'people', 'Gestalt', 'great', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'entire', 'story', ""'re"", 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'buy', 'manga', ""n't"", 'have', 'commercial', 'release', 'U.S.', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'release', 'U.S.', 'period.Olivier', 'pronounced', 'O-li-vee-ay', 'French', 'young', 'priest', 'least', 'general', 'POV', 'estimate', '20-something', 'who', 'beginning', 'doubt', 'faith', 'So', 'decided', 'go', 'forbidden', 'island', 'G.', 'Will', 'superior', 'Father', 'Messiah', 'say', 'Okay', 'problem', 'Nope', 'Instead', 'dark', 'elf', 'Suzu', 'track', 'down', 'Olivier', 'bring', 'home.Meanwhile', 'Olivier', 'staying', 'inn', 'small', 'town', 'try', 'saying', 'five', 'times', 'fast', 'return', 'miracle', 'innkeeper', 'mute', 'slave', 'girl', ""'ll"", 'divulge', 'now', 'get', 'video', 'Gestalt', 'excellent', 'animation', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'complete', 'plenty', 'drool-worthy', 'bishonen', 'plot', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'great', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'are', 'incompleteness', 'b', 'Suzu', 'voice', '*obnoxious*', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'other', 'great', 'including', 'dubbing', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'well-known', 'dub', 'VA', 'Ohri', 'highly', 'recommend', 'want', 'comedy', 'action', 'bishonen']",N/A
195469,A2G3HEJ2WSRZVP,1890228796,Tivor,"[10, 10]","This is such a beautiful OVA series, and it's a shame that there are only 2 episodes.  I admit, I purchased this DVD only because I thought the cover art was cool.  I've never heard of it before, but there was just something in the art style which grabbed my attention.  It was totally an impulse purchase, and, having watched it twice now, I do not regret one bit.The artwork and the character design is just as beautiful as the cover art, and they are very smoothly animated.  It's a big-time eye-pleaser.  And the dub is surprisingly quite tolerable, although I clearly prefer the original Japanese voices.But as for the storyline....  Well....  OK, I really like the story that's there.  But it's just darn too SHORT!!  I love Olivier's inner conflict of wanting to know the truth about the gods, and I like Ohri's character.  They both have such great potentials, and it's such a shame that neither get very developed because of the time constraint (60 minutes).  I so wish there were just a couple more OVA episodes to really dig into their characters and develop the plot more.  I WANNA SEE SOME MORE!!!  (I guess I'll have to track down the manga series, eh?)Still, I love this DVD because it just looks so darn beautiful.

This anime has a lot of criticism about story line (the reason for it is that there is manga published prior to it), and it is true there are a couple of moments where they should've speeded up the story. The dub is horrible, they use those high pitch, squeaky voices for some of the characters, so I suggest watching it in Japanese. And if you wont put subtitles in, at least the first time you watch it, it adds a lot of mystery to the show and you will truly enjoy watching it.(really!)
