No, it's not of a &quot;Meryl Streep/Oscar winning&quot; level in production or acting. If it were, the true power of this film would have been lost. Some of the critical reviews are overlooking the lesson this movie delivered. The movie is about believing in yourself despite obstacles, &quot;sudden punches,&quot; and quick turns life can give hand out. It's about staying true to your chosen course and the power and belief in one's self because of the support and belief others have in you.I remember walking out of the film more affected than I thought I would be due to the last scene of the movie with Didi Conn's affecting performance and some her last lines: &quot;I learned something today, Pop. It was really painful, but I learned something. I learned that I have to depend on myself. I can't depend on anybody else and that's ok. You know why? Because I'm a really good person to depend on. Maybe I don't have someone that I thought I loved a lot really, but that's ok because I've got me. And I've got my work. And I've got my music. And I love that- more than anything else on this earth.&quot;I was 25 and at the beginning of making my life choices in career, living on my own, and all the other &quot;adult responsibilites&quot; that come at you in that time in your life whether you're ready or not. I think that's why this film had the impact on me that it did. Maybe if some of the other reviewers- and people who watch this film- look back at that phase in their lives and evaluate the film again in comparison to their 20-something &quot;coming into the real world&quot; experiences, they may modify their original opinions as to the movie's quality.Yes, I think the film ended a bit abruptly. It would have been a bit of a happy, selfish, enjoyable pleasure to see Laurie Robinson revel in her success because of her perseverance and hard work. At least the viewer was left with the fact that she did become a winner. Everyone needs &quot;happy ending&quot; movies every once in awhile! I am now going to put this DVD in my player and watch this movie I haven't seen in 26 years just so I can see Ms. Conn's ending performance/scene that has stayed with me all this time and hope it still has the same positive power and impression....",4,"Simple plot, simple story- but timeless life lesson",1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,2333,"['remember', 'going', 'theatre', 'see', 'film', 'summer', ""'77"", 'No', 'not', 'quot', 'Meryl', 'Streep/Oscar', 'winning', 'quot', 'level', 'production', 'acting', 'were', 'true', 'power', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'critical', 'reviews', 'are', 'overlooking', 'lesson', 'movie', 'delivered', 'movie', 'believing', 'obstacles', 'quot', 'sudden', 'punches', 'quot', 'quick', 'turns', 'life', 'can', 'give', 'hand', 'out', 'staying', 'true', 'chosen', 'course', 'power', 'belief', 'one', 'self', 'support', 'belief', 'others', 'have', 'you.I', 'remember', 'walking', 'film', 'more', 'affected', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'due', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'affecting', 'performance', 'last', 'lines', 'quot', 'learned', 'something', 'today', 'Pop', 'was', 'really', 'painful', 'learned', 'something', 'learned', 'have', 'depend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'depend', 'anybody', 'else', 'ok.', 'know', 'why', ""'m"", 'really', 'good', 'person', 'depend', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'someone', 'thought', 'loved', 'lot', 'really', 'ok', ""'ve"", 'got', ""'ve"", 'got', 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'music', 'love', 'that-', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'earth.', 'quot', 'was', '25', 'beginning', 'making', 'life', 'choices', 'career', 'living', 'own', 'other', 'quot', 'adult', 'quot', 'come', 'time', 'life', ""'re"", 'ready', 'not', 'think', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'impact', 'did', 'Maybe', 'other', 'reviewers-', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'film-', 'look', 'back', 'phase', 'lives', 'evaluate', 'film', 'again', 'comparison', '20-something', 'quot', 'coming', 'real', 'world', 'quot', 'experiences', 'may', 'modify', 'original', 'opinions', 'movie', 'quality.Yes', 'think', 'film', 'ended', 'bit', 'abruptly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'happy', 'selfish', 'enjoyable', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Laurie', 'Robinson', 'revel', 'success', 'perseverance', 'hard', 'work', 'least', 'viewer', 'was', 'left', 'fact', 'did', 'become', 'winner', 'Everyone', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'movies', 'once', 'awhile', 'am', 'now', 'going', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '26', 'years', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Conn', 'ending', 'performance/scene', 'stayed', 'time', 'hope', 'still', 'same', 'positive', 'power', 'impression']",N/A

Didi Conn did a nice job of playing the naive young woman, but gifted with alot of drive and belief in herself. The supporting cast put in a solid effort, and a very nice movie came out of it. If you're judging it against 'A Star is Born', I can understand why someone might find it inferior, but stand it alone-on it's own merits, and it's a more than adequate, enjoyable movie.

682787,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005U125,Only-A-Child,"[4, 6]","Had ""You Light Up My Life"" been promoted for what it was, a low-budget growing-up film with a quirky and effective performance by Didi Conn, it would be better regarded today. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives, for some reason the distributors decided that this little film had the potential to make big money.So they threw more money into marketing than had gone into production, they pre-sold the film with a hit recording of the title song (sung by Debby Boone although Kacey Cisyk actually does the singing in the film) released concurrently with the film, and they utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening a film simultaneously in many theatres, with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance (although a common practice today this was done less often in the 1970's).The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing, and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some good points. Conn's earnest portrayal of a reluctant juvenile comedienne and good daughter trying to work out her adult identity rings true. You feel a protectiveness toward her that makes you more tolerant of the cornball elements. The child star vs stage-father stuff with Joe Silver seems genuine and the surreal television commercial material has some good comic qualities.Kacey Cisyk (a session singer who was opera trained) recorded the song for the film but initially declined to record it for commercial release. She may have felt that it had no potential or maybe she just didn't wanted to be closely associated with a pop standard. So they recruited Debby Boone and her version went to the radio stations and record stores. Cisyk actually appears in the film as one of the bridesmaids.Ironically, although the song works fine within the film, it hurts the film's reputation. People incorrectly believe that the film was just a lame attempt to exploit a hit record and that Boone was unwilling to allow her own version to be used in the production.Then again, what do I know?

682788,ALD1CRUBY1365,B00005U125,R. L. MILLER,"[1, 3]","Anyone I ever tried to discuss this movie with when I first saw it just when punk cynicism was starting to dominate entertainment would say dismissively; ""Oh. Yeah, right. That lame preachy Debby Boone song."" I would try to explain that the film had nothing to do with the Evangelical brainwashing that Boone's father Pat (among others of that ilk) were into--that it was a simple, partially romantic tale of an emerging young songwriter--but no one wanted to hear that. The punk elite wanted war with the Christian far right, so this movie was a casualty of ideological preconceptions and the jihad-like collision between those two extreme societal forces. Just a simple love song taken from a movie that was too innocently ""goody-goody"" for the times. And Pat's ""Little Debby"" had to go and hijack it for ideological purposes masquerading as spiritual purposes. So I gave up. ""WHAT ABOUT SIMPLE ENTERTAINMENT?!?!"", I yelled. ""IS 'WHOLESOME' A BLEEPIN' FOUR-LETTER WORD?!?!"" And was pleasantly surprised just now, years later, to find my old classic cable tear-jerker is still in print. The VHS tape of it I grabbed back then didn't outlast the machine that ate it, and the machine itself croaked years ago. Now (sorry ACLU) thank God, I can still get it. I don't recommend it to people who are only turned on by Vin Diesel flash-and-kaboom ""thrillers"" and gangsta rap or death metal--they'll find it boo-oo-ring. The secular 11th Commandment of contemporary entertainment: ""Thou Shalt Not Bore"". After all, this is only Girl Writes Songs, Girl Has Sudden Success With Some Of Them, Girl Falls In Love With Boy Involved In Her Breakthrough, Gets Heart Broken, and so on.  Know what scene really blew me away, being a musician myself? I can tell you without much ""spoiler"" risk. There's this scene where Laurie brings the producer the orchestral arrangements she's had done for the title song. She's never actually heard them played, but they've got an orchestra in the place, they point her at a mike, and away we go. And you can see as she sings the amazed joy on her face as she hears her music just as she'd been imagining it. Trite, huh?
