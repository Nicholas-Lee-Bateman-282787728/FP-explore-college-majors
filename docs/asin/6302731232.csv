330199,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,6302731232,A Customer,"[5, 5]","Toys is along the lines of a movie made for young ones, but far different than any movies of the sort I knew of growing up. 'Toys' lights up the screen with thoughts that have to go through every kids mind opening a toy tank on Christmas..imagining it blowing up his little sister's doll. The movie adds a harmless wartime effect, fantastic special effects and embraceable performances by the cast. Robin Williams turns child-appealing roles to gold with his quick wit and arsenal of a thousand voices. Joan Cusack is sweet and adorable as Williams' robot sister, giving her beautiful smile and few jumbled words as your biggest reason to get this movie. I think what theatres these days need is less graphic and obscene teenage trash acting, and more movies that combine well respected big names on the acting scene and good ideas. Ideas that are so good they can make a movie appeal to all ages like 'Toys'...if some movie writers took their time they could make a good movie, not follow a popular, always discriminating trend. 'Toys' is a flashy, cute and smart rollercoaster ride that you HAVE to see to know how sweet Joan Cusack's role of Alsatia is.",5,Joan Cusack Is a Wonder To Behold InThis Role...,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,1156,"['Toys', 'lines', 'movie', 'made', 'young', 'ones', 'far', 'different', 'movies', 'sort', 'knew', 'growing', 'up', ""'Toys"", 'lights', 'screen', 'thoughts', 'have', 'go', 'kids', 'mind', 'opening', 'toy', 'tank', 'Christmas..imagining', 'blowing', 'up', 'little', 'sister', 'doll', 'movie', 'harmless', 'wartime', 'effect', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'embraceable', 'performances', 'cast', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'child-appealing', 'roles', 'gold', 'quick', 'wit', 'arsenal', 'thousand', 'voices', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'sweet', 'adorable', 'Williams', 'robot', 'sister', 'giving', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'few', 'jumbled', 'words', 'biggest', 'reason', 'get', 'movie', 'think', 'what', 'days', 'need', 'less', 'graphic', 'obscene', 'teenage', 'trash', 'acting', 'more', 'movies', 'combine', 'well', 'respected', 'big', 'names', 'acting', 'scene', 'good', 'ideas', 'Ideas', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'appeal', 'ages', ""'Toys"", 'movie', 'writers', 'took', 'time', 'could', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'follow', 'popular', 'always', 'discriminating', 'trend', 'flashy', 'cute', 'smart', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'HAVE', 'see', 'know', 'how', 'sweet', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'role', 'Alsatia']",N/A

Still, the whole idea of a toy factory that is itself more of a toy than a reality, and the owner's home as well, is carried through right down to the funeral and monument of the original owner. He leaves the factory to his brother, General Leland Zevo (Michael Gambon aka Albus Dumbledore) instead of his rather impractical son Leslie Zevo (Robin Williams). The General hears of industrial espionage and calls in his son Patrick (LL Cool J, who does a great job) to head up the security operation.One day, the General and Patrick go into town to see what the competition is doing, and discover a video game arcade full of boys playing war games. The General plays one where he gets points for hitting tanks and other military targets, but a 1,000 point penalty for hitting UN trucks. He decides to concentrate on hitting the UN trucks, taking out his anger at the UN for the first time in his life.The General is really a maniac, but we don't learn quite how much until later. He decides to build toys that carry weapons, and also video games that are actually control panels for real battles. (Shades of ""Ender's Game"" here) But of course gentle Leslie disapproves of making war toys, and eventually tells his uncle so. My favorite Robin Williams line is ""Wow! FAO Schwartzkopff!)It would be helplessly corny if it didn't go completely over the top in the last half hour or so. But even deadly war toys can be funny when they are played to this extreme. I'm not certain it would be good for very little children, but kids from about 9 or 10 would probably roll on the floor laughing.

330203,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,6302731232,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[6, 9]","Here is a film that has some of the most wonderous sights I have seen in any film. TOYS creates a world of a toy factory that is so wonderful, so imaginative, that you wonder how this movie could possibly have gone wrong. Barry Levinson had this film in mind since before he did DINER, and he found his main star in Robin Williams after they worked on GOOD MORNING VIETNAM. It is obvious what he wants to accomplish. To show us a fantasy world that couldn't exist but that you would love it if it did, that only innocence should prevail in the world of toys. He accomplishes the first half with exuberance. He is aided by three absolutely wonderful performances: Robin Williams, Joan Cusack, and Robin Wright Penn. But he comes to a conclusion that is not only confusing but really bizarre.Robin Williams is Leslie Zevo. His father is Kenneth Zevo, founder of Zevo Toys, a factory that doesn't so much exist in a town but in the middle of its own world. Zevo is old and dying and played by the legendary Donald O'Connor. (His funeral scene creates a nice little laugh until I remembered that O'Connor himself passed away a few months ago.) Kenneth Zevo must hand over control of his factory, but feels that his son Leslie isn't ready for this job. And his daughter Al-Sashia (Joan Cusack) isn't, well you find out at the end of the film. So he turns the factory over to his brother General Zevo (Michael Gambon) of the U.S. Army.General Zevo clearly doesn't want the job, but the Army isn't the way he remembers it. He is the kind of soldier who would shoot a fly with his .45 sidearm instead of using a fly swatter. That creates a nice laugh, but in a really funny scene he goes to visit his father, who never tires of humiliating hiis son by showing how he outranks him.  What to do? He tours the factory in a sequence that demonstrates again and again the visual wonder of this world. But this isn't his world. He begins to think that there may be a market in the world of war toys, but Willaims and everyone else at the company feels that it isn't the company's style.General Zevo comes up with an idea. The only reason I can reveal this idea is to explain how the film goes off the rails. The company will manufacture miniature toys armed with real bullets, missiles, and bombs. They will be controlled by children who think they are playing videogames and scoring points. When his scheme is discovered by Williams and Cusack they find themselves running through the factory pursued by the miniature war toys. Bullets are soon flying, explosions are going off, and everything leads to a battle between the evil war toys and the old innocent wind-up toys. It is here when my heart started to really sink. Why couldn't Barry Levinson come up with a more imaginative solution to stop the General than having innocent toys attack (and be blown to pieces) by war toys? Surely a movie with such imaginative setting could give us a payoff just as imaginative, couldn't it?Robin Williams was born to play this character. He is so convincing as a man who never seemed to grow up. Again and again he uses his gift for verbal improvisation that for once doesn't stop a film dead in its tracks. Joan Cusack displays a charming innocence that many times I don't always see. At the end the secret of who her character really is doesn't come across as a surprise. And there's a nice sweet romance between Williams and Robin Wright Penn as a new employee. And all during the opening, first act, and middle, is that wonderful look. The production designer Ferdinand Scafforeili was nominated for an Academy Award, and perhaps should have received a special achievement for it.So, TOYS has a magnificent extravagant look, terrific performances, and even some really sweet and delightful music (especially the opening song). But it doesn't have an imaginative conclusion or a good third act. I guess I will recommend this film. Its good qualities really are the price of admission.

I  bought  this  DVD  2  days  before  Thanksgiving  because  I  needed  something  to  get me into  the  holiday  spirit, and  it  worked  and  keeped  me  laughing  from  the  scean  where  the  head  of  Zevo  toys  dies  to  the  end  of  the  film. The  film  starts  out  when  the  Zevo  toy  company  puts  on  a  christmas  ballet  musical  in  the  style  of  The  Nutcracker  with  singing, the  lead  female  singer  sings  this  song  in  the  production  called  toys  at  christmas  which  is  a  really  great holiday  song  that  should of  got  a  grammy  nomanee. Then  theres  the  scean  where  the  General(played  by  Michael  Gambon  who  played  Professor Dumbledore  in  the  Harry  Potter  films)  goes  to  viset  his  brother  who  is  the  head  and  founder  of  Zevo  toys  tells  him  that  he  is  dying  and  wants  him  to  take  over  Zevo  toys  because  he  thinks  that  his  son  Leslie (played  by  the funest  and  funnest  actor  in  movie  history  Robin  Willams) is  not  ready  to  take  over  Zevo  toys, this  shows  that  you  can't  always  get  what  you  want. The  head  of  Zevo  toys  dies  with  his  pace maker  attached  to  his  beeny  with  a  propeller  attached. So  they  give  him  a  ride  in  the  vicheal  in  the  desighn  of  a  toy  amblunce. Then  we  go  to  the  funeral  scean  where  everyone  is  gathering  around  the  casket. The  Minster  tells  them  that  Kenneth  was  the  child  in  all  of  them  and  goes  on  until  they  hear  some  kind  of  strange  laughter  coming  from  the  casket. Leslie  open  the  lide  and  pulles  out  this  toy  called  the  barral  of  laughter. He  put  the  toy  back  in  the  casket. Owen  tells  Leslie  that  he  should  remove  the  batteries from  the  laughing  barrel and  back  in  the  casket. Leslie  tell  him  that  the  batteries  will  die  in  a  couple  of  hours. Well  the  batteries  don't  die. As  for  the  rest  of  the  movie, you  have  to  see  it  through  the  eyes  of  a  child. Everything  in  the  rest  of  the  movie  looks  like  toys,  The  toy  making  machines, Anastasia  work  cloths  look  like  doll  cloths, The  house  Leslie  and  Anastasia  live  in  is  a  giant  doll  house, Leslie  bed  is  in  the  shape  of  a  rubber  ducky,  and  Kennth  Zevo  tombstone  is  a  giant  elephant  blowing  bubbles  with  that  laughing  barrel  still  working  and  laughing. The  general  who  now  run  the  toy  company  now  has  the  toys  made  into  war  toys. So  its  up  to  Leslie  and  Anastasia  to  to  fight  the  battles  of  war  toys. They  even  make  a  music  video  in  the  style  of  a  Peter  Gaberal  and  The Talking  Heads. The  question  is  can  Leslie  and  Anastasia  save  the  toy  company? that  you  will  have  to  find  out  when  you  watch  this  movie.

First off, ignore all the reviewers who complain that this story line isn't the most imaginative ever thought up, and therefore give this fantastic movie a terrible review.  The main point of this movie is that it's visually fun to watch!The movie starts with Zevo Toy's founder Kenneth giving a dying wish to his military brother Leland: that the brother take over the toy factory when Kenneth passes away.  Kenneth's son Leslie (Robin Williams) has a true love for the company, but lacks the leadership skills to really take over the company...until Leland starts making toys into actual weapons that use kids to do all the killing.  This forces Leslie to come to grips with some serious issues about what's really important to him, and makes him the couragous leader (along with Captain Patrick Zevo, Leland's son) of a toy army to take on Leland's insanity.I'm not a big fan or rap by any means, but I really got a kick out of LL Cool J's performance in this movie, and it was fun to watch his character develop into a toy-factory loving guy.

I avoided this turkey at the theaters in 1992, but I thought what the heck and decided to waste a couple hours and see why some call this, THE WORST MOVIE EVER. ""Toys"" isn't the worst movie of all time, but it comes really, really, close. This movie reeks of pretension and psuedo-political correctness. Its a kid's movie, or wants to be, with an over the top sense of whimsy, an implausible love scene between Robin Wright Penn and Robin Williams and an insufferable script that makes no sense what-so-ever. The weirdest thing about this movie is that it's one of the best made pieces of schlock that I have ever seen, you can really tell that someone put a lot of time and effort into the sets and costumes, as for the script, eh, not so much. In ""Toys"" you see a truly gifted performer like Williams utterly fall flat on his face. You can practically smell the flop sweat as he and director Barry Levinson try desperately to sell us this cutesy-pie, anti-war movie with all the subtlety of a sledge-hammer. I'm all for a good anti-war movie, but you can't preach for 90 minutes and then have the nerve to depict a climactic, toy-Armageddon, war-o-the-toys finale.

The &quot;poor&quot; choices of the past(militaristic Uncle in charge of the factory) compell the newer generations to reorient the system(democracy as toy factory) towards it's original intent. The founder(or founders Jefferson,Madison et al) Zevo had no idea of the damage the company would tolerate and still move towards a stronger more democratic outcome. An allegory for the younger Bush administration, we should all be amazed at how our poor choices inflict harm and ruin our way of life. Catch the Tori Amos, happy worker song at the beginning of the movie and contrast this with the miltary dictatorship that insues.It's hard to know if the intent of the father was to shake the son out of his doldrums and trivial existence, or a truly poor choice of leadership. As we relinquish our rights, it becomes harder and harder to reacquire them as the newer systems congeal. Warren Zevo has early and ample opportunity to question the decisions, but inaction allows the Uncle to overwhelm and adulterate the system.

I first saw this movie while spending the night in a hotel in Garmisch, Germany; and I was so drawn into it I put off dinner (hard for me to do with the excellent food in Germany) until it was over.  I can understand why a lot of people are disappointed with this movie, it isn't the normal Robin Williams performance.  If you are expecting 'Mork and Mindy' then go rent 'Mrs Doubtfire.' I am sure some are appalled over the fact that there is a message in this movie as well, we want to see robin act like the clown prince, not tell us that violent toys are bad!  However, if you can get past those two points, you are in for one of the best abstract movies of the past decade.

330228,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6302731232,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","I have a special love for &#34;Toys&#34; despite it being an obviously imperfect film.  Whether it be a genuine dream project of Barry Levinson or perhaps a result of his own hubris, what resulted was a film like no other.The film's greatest assets are the visuals.  Clearly inspired by the artwork of Ren&eacute; Magritte as well as classical toys, Levinson and co created a very magical world.  It was something that seemed to set itself out to be Oz, Wonderland, or something out of Charlie and the Chocolate factory.  The world has a colorful clean look to it.  Levinson is careful not to leave Zevo Toys too much to keep you captured in the world of &#34;Toys.&#34;  I think the world of the film is one of the things that keeps me coming back to it.The acting is good.  Williams is perfectly cast as an eternal manchild and son of Zevo.  Michael Gambon is excellent as the villian, Zevo's brother, who sets out to make war toys.  Stealing the show though is Joan Cusack, who's just plain adorable in this film as Williams sister.  Our heroes have to stop Gambon from changing Zevo toys, and ultimately, losing its innocence.  In addition to a fun story and good visuals, it boasts a good soundtrack.The only fault of the film, and probably why it never found success, is that it really doesn't have a clear audience.  It looks like a kids movie, but along with its antiwar message, it has enough innuendo and adult dialogue to drive kids away.  It has a shifting tone between that and its more childlike innocence that keep the film from having a defined purpose from start to finish.  That fault aside, this is a film that is a fun watch, and love it or hate it, you'll agree it's one of a kind.",4,Good film..no audience?,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1702,"['have', 'special', 'love', '34', 'Toys', '34', 'being', 'obviously', 'imperfect', 'film', 'be', 'genuine', 'dream', 'project', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'perhaps', 'result', 'own', 'hubris', 'what', 'resulted', 'was', 'film', 'other.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'assets', 'are', 'visuals', 'Clearly', 'inspired', 'artwork', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Magritte', 'as', 'well', 'classical', 'toys', 'Levinson', 'co', 'created', 'very', 'magical', 'world', 'was', 'something', 'seemed', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'Oz', 'Wonderland', 'something', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'factory', 'world', 'colorful', 'clean', 'look', 'Levinson', 'careful', 'not', 'leave', 'Zevo', 'Toys', 'too', 'much', 'keep', 'captured', 'world', '34', 'Toys.', '34', 'think', 'world', 'film', 'one', 'things', 'keeps', 'coming', 'back', 'it.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Williams', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'eternal', 'manchild', 'son', 'Zevo', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'excellent', 'villian', 'Zevo', 'brother', 'who', 'out', 'make', 'war', 'toys', 'Stealing', 'show', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'adorable', 'film', 'Williams', 'sister', 'heroes', 'have', 'stop', 'Gambon', 'changing', 'Zevo', 'toys', 'ultimately', 'losing', 'innocence', 'addition', 'fun', 'story', 'good', 'visuals', 'good', 'soundtrack.The', 'only', 'fault', 'film', 'probably', 'why', 'never', 'found', 'success', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'audience', 'kids', 'movie', 'antiwar', 'message', 'enough', 'innuendo', 'adult', 'dialogue', 'drive', 'kids', 'away', 'shifting', 'tone', 'more', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'film', 'having', 'defined', 'purpose', 'start', 'finish', 'fault', 'aside', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'love', 'hate', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'one', 'kind']",N/A
