I found out recently that they aren't planning on making anymore episodes of Coupling!  I shall have to go into deep mourning!First of all, I need to mention that I was predisposed to like this show due to the fact I love BritComs. However, most romantic comedies, at least the ones that have been made recently, are usually not, comedies, that is.  In other words, they aren't very funny!However, Coupling is laugh out loud funny.  It's also clever and intelligent, and an interesting insight into men's minds.Hard to say which episode is the best.  Some stand-out ones are Steve and Susan's first date where both their exes and best friends end up tagging along, for a toal of six people.Then there's the one where Susan discovers that her ex Patrick has taped them having sex, which makes her furious, and everyone in the group watches it, only to have Susan become even more furious when she discovers that Patrick has taped over her!Then there's Jeff's foreplay tips, which reference something called ""the sock gap.""Jeff is actually in many ways my favorite character because he is so bizarre, while at the same time managing to be really sweet and vulnerable!  And from some of the things he says about his mother, you have to wonder about his family life!Steve is a nice guy.  Susan is someone I'd like to have as a friend.  Sally is neurotic and not very nice, not to mention getting drunk at the drop of a hat.  Patrick's ego knows no bounds.  Jane is very insecure underneath it all.In the fourth series Jeff is replaced by another character named Oliver.  He is similiar in some ways to Jeff, but he doesn't have the weird theories about womyn that Jeff does.However, Jeff, reappears in a dream Steve is having while he and Susan are at the hospital waiting for their baby to be born.  Apparently, Jeff has headed off to Lesbos in search of, you guessed it, Lesbians, and appears in Steve's dream as Steve and Jeff's heavily pregnant and lactating fourth grade math teacher!  This is explained by vague references to a kind of do-it-yourself sex change operation combined with some sort of bizzarre magick spell.  At least that's the impression I got from the little that was said.If you like intelligent, grown-up, comedy, you should like this show!Thank Goddess for BBC America!",5,A Romantic Comedy That's Actually Funny!,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,2332,"['Update', 'Tragic', 'News', 'Say', ""n't"", 'so', 'found', 'out', 'recently', 'are', ""n't"", 'planning', 'making', 'anymore', 'episodes', 'Coupling', 'shall', 'have', 'go', 'deep', 'mourning', 'First', 'need', 'mention', 'was', 'predisposed', 'like', 'show', 'due', 'fact', 'love', 'BritComs', 'However', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'least', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'recently', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'comedies', 'other', 'words', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'However', 'Coupling', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'also', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'insight', 'men', 'minds.Hard', 'say', 'episode', 'best', 'stand-out', 'ones', 'are', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'first', 'date', 'where', 'exes', 'best', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'tagging', 'along', 'toal', 'six', 'people.Then', 'one', 'where', 'Susan', 'ex', 'Patrick', 'taped', 'having', 'sex', 'furious', 'everyone', 'group', 'only', 'have', 'Susan', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'furious', 'when', 'Patrick', 'taped', 'Then', 'Jeff', 'foreplay', 'tips', 'reference', 'something', 'called', 'sock', 'gap', 'Jeff', 'actually', 'many', 'ways', 'favorite', 'character', 'so', 'bizarre', 'same', 'time', 'managing', 'be', 'really', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'things', 'mother', 'have', 'wonder', 'family', 'life', 'Steve', 'nice', 'guy', 'Susan', 'someone', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'friend', 'Sally', 'neurotic', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'not', 'mention', 'getting', 'drunk', 'drop', 'hat', 'Patrick', 'ego', 'bounds', 'Jane', 'very', 'insecure', 'fourth', 'series', 'Jeff', 'replaced', 'character', 'named', 'Oliver', 'similiar', 'ways', 'Jeff', ""n't"", 'have', 'weird', 'theories', 'womyn', 'Jeff', 'does.However', 'Jeff', 'dream', 'Steve', 'having', 'Susan', 'are', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'baby', 'be', 'born', 'Apparently', 'Jeff', 'headed', 'off', 'Lesbos', 'search', 'guessed', 'Lesbians', 'Steve', 'dream', 'Steve', 'Jeff', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'lactating', 'fourth', 'grade', 'math', 'teacher', 'explained', 'vague', 'references', 'kind', 'do-it-yourself', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'combined', 'sort', 'bizzarre', 'magick', 'spell', 'least', 'impression', 'got', 'little', 'was', 'said.If', 'intelligent', 'grown-up', 'comedy', 'should', 'like', 'show', 'Thank', 'Goddess', 'BBC', 'America']",N/A

My first thought was, ""Where has this been all my life?"" My second thought was, ""I must own this on DVD.""This cutting edge comedy that isn't afraid to traverse the rocky terrain of sexuality, friendship, and dating in today's world is pretty much what I wish ""Friends"" had been. It is adult, satisfying, awkward, painful, and laugh-out-loud funny! The acting is superb, the characters are quirky but lovable, it's easy to relate to them (I see myself in Sally!), and the situations they get into are ludicrous. I love when they show the different perspectives between men and women and the misunderstandings that occur therein. I also love the candid boy-talk and girl-talk segments. Despite how over-the-top it can be, I actually find it to be more down-to-Earth and realistic than ""Friends"" ever was--and certainly more satisfying. After watching this, ""Friends"" seems watered down and boring (in short, very American in terms of appeal, whereas Brits are a little more edgy).I docked a star for the fourth season because the show really suffered, in my opinion, in two key areas: Jeff (who was my favorite character!) left the series. The interaction became forced between them all, the chemistry was gone, and the new guy didn't have the nearly charm that Jeff did. It just didn't work. Additionally, I was lost when Susan became pregnant because I can't relate to, nor do I have any interest in, story lines like that; more so, it felt untrue to the show, which is about coupling and adult relationships, not babies and homemaking.

So, I scored a great deal on the entire series.'Coupling' is one of the most satisfying series I have seen in many a year. At first, I'd watch and think, ""I can't believe they just said that!"" But as the series went along the characters became more developed, and I really cared about them, especially Sally Harper. This surprised me, because, at first, I could not stand her. She was this one note age obssessed stereotype. But Kate Isitt really brought a lot to making Sally a real person. Her standout, and I think, brave performances are in the episodes ""Remember This"", ""The Girl with One Heart"" (absolutley heartbreaking at the end), ""Bed Time"", and ""9 1/2 Months"".Gina Bellman was note perfect as the ""mad"" Jane Christie, a good time gal up for anything. However, Jane never became really believable until the penultimate episode ""The Naked Living Room"". But it's worth the wait.Susan Walker, played by Sarah Alexander, is the most elusive of the women. She's smart, organized, sexually voracious, a ""happy trotting elf"", to quote an episode. Yet, there's a distance to her, probably because she's so busy keeping everything together. Maybe having a boyfriend like Steve Taylor has something to do with that.Steve, played by Jack Davenport, is the most normal of the guys. He does tend to complain a lot, especially during series 4 ""the baby season"", but he also gets to make great speeches about why men are like we are; ""Inferno"" is a great example. Steve also gets the last line of the series, and after he says it, you know why it ended when it did. It's perfect.Patrick Matiland, played by Ben Miles, is the ""tripod"" womanizer. But, in a twist, he's very upfront about it. There's no guile to him at all. When he gets involved with Sally, it's very confronting to him, and he breaks out of being the stud, although not willingly.And Jeff... ah, Jeff. The reason to watch the show. Richard Coyle will always be identified with Jeff Murdock no matter what. I saw a video of 'Lorna Doone' with Mr. Coyle on the box as the romantic lead and just burst out laughing. Jeff gets the best lines and observations; the ""sock gap"" is so true! And he always manages to get naked at least one a season with hilarious and squirm inducing results.Richard Mylan, as Oliver Morris, had the thankless job of replacing Jeff after Richard Coyle left after series 3. He acquits himself admirably; he's not Jeff under another name, and he gives Oliver gravity in ""The Naked Living Room"" when he dares confront Jane... something none of the other characters ever did.Steven Moffatt wrote all 29 episodes and as he went along he put twists on presenting the stories, such as ""The Girl with Two Breasts"", ""The End of the Line"", ""Split"", ""Remember This"", ""9 1/2 Minutes"", ""Nightlines"" and ""Bed Time."" Great, great imagination.So, yes, it IS a comedy about sex, sex, and more sex. But if you watch closely it's also a about lot more.",5,"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps",1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,3214,"['came', ""'Coupling"", 'local', 'PBS', 'channel', 'late', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'was', ""'The"", 'Office', 'was', 'show', 'wanted', 'see', 'few', 'weeks', 'skipped', ""'The"", 'Office', 'got', 'hooked', ""'Coupling"", 'series', 'run', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'have', 'wait', 'once', 'week', 'So', 'scored', 'great', 'deal', 'entire', 'series', ""'Coupling"", 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'year', 'first', ""'d"", 'watch', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'said', 'series', 'went', 'characters', 'became', 'more', 'developed', 'really', 'cared', 'especially', 'Sally', 'Harper', 'surprised', 'first', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'was', 'one', 'note', 'age', 'obssessed', 'stereotype', 'Kate', 'Isitt', 'really', 'brought', 'lot', 'making', 'Sally', 'real', 'person', 'standout', 'think', 'brave', 'performances', 'are', 'episodes', 'Remember', 'Girl', 'One', 'Heart', 'heartbreaking', 'end', 'Bed', 'Time', '9', '1/2', 'Months', '.Gina', 'Bellman', 'was', 'note', 'perfect', 'mad', 'Jane', 'Christie', 'good', 'time', 'up', 'anything', 'However', 'Jane', 'never', 'became', 'really', 'believable', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Naked', 'Living', 'Room', 'wait.Susan', 'Walker', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Alexander', 'most', 'elusive', 'women', 'smart', 'organized', 'sexually', 'voracious', 'happy', 'trotting', 'elf', 'quote', 'episode', 'distance', 'probably', 'so', 'busy', 'keeping', 'everything', 'together', 'Maybe', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'Steve', 'Taylor', 'something', 'do', 'that.Steve', 'played', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'most', 'normal', 'guys', 'tend', 'complain', 'lot', 'especially', 'series', '4', 'baby', 'season', 'also', 'make', 'great', 'speeches', 'why', 'men', 'are', 'are', 'Inferno', 'great', 'example', 'Steve', 'also', 'last', 'line', 'series', 'know', 'why', 'ended', 'when', 'did', 'perfect.Patrick', 'Matiland', 'played', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'tripod', 'womanizer', 'twist', 'very', 'upfront', 'guile', 'When', 'involved', 'Sally', 'very', 'confronting', 'being', 'stud', 'not', 'willingly.And', 'Jeff', 'ah', 'Jeff', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'identified', 'Jeff', 'Murdock', 'matter', 'what', 'saw', 'video', ""'Lorna"", 'Doone', 'Mr.', 'Coyle', 'box', 'romantic', 'lead', 'just', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'Jeff', 'best', 'lines', 'observations', 'sock', 'gap', 'so', 'true', 'always', 'get', 'naked', 'least', 'one', 'season', 'hilarious', 'squirm', 'inducing', 'results.Richard', 'Mylan', 'Oliver', 'Morris', 'had', 'thankless', 'job', 'replacing', 'Jeff', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'left', 'series', '3', 'admirably', 'not', 'Jeff', 'name', 'Oliver', 'gravity', 'Naked', 'Living', 'Room', 'when', 'confront', 'Jane', 'something', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'ever', 'did.Steven', 'Moffatt', 'wrote', '29', 'episodes', 'went', 'put', 'twists', 'presenting', 'stories', 'such', 'Girl', 'Two', 'Breasts', 'End', 'Line', 'Split', 'Remember', '9', '1/2', 'Minutes', 'Nightlines', 'Bed', 'Time', 'Great', 'great', 'imagination.So', 'yes', 'comedy', 'sex', 'sex', 'more', 'sex', 'watch', 'closely', 'also', 'lot', 'more']",N/A

In the real world, he's slightly less successful.Then there's Jane, she thinks she's everything that she wants to be. She's been with Steve and had one particularly memorable moment with Susan.The show suffered a bit in the final season with the loss of Richard Coyle. Jeff was more than just the wacky friend, he gave the show some of it's greatest moments. Also, the producers focused too much on fantasy sequences to mirror the episode events.One of the amazing things about this show, especially in the early seasons, was how well they could tell a story from various perspectives and have it all mesh together.

The sturdy & attractively designed pastel cases in which each DVD is contained are a cut above lots of cheap DVD packaging out there, which is a nice touch too.When I first happened upon an episode of Coupling a few years ago courtesy of my local PBS station, I was surprised that such a poorly written and produced show could make it to the airwaves. I failed to realize at the time that Mr. Moffat was a brilliantly funny writer and the plots were supposed to be absurd. At this point I consider myself a hard core fan.In the fourth series, the writing and overall production of the show feels so polished it bears very little resemble to the slapped-together quality of the first season, for lack of a better term. The character of Jane (aka the 'stupid one') has made the most noticeable transformation in the fourth series. Her 'dumb brunette' act has been toned down to the point of being almost unrecognizable, which works better anyway and is far less grating. I have to wonder if this was Gina Bellman's idea?The fourth series does suffer a little from the loss of Jeff (Richard Coyle) especially in light of the fact that the character of Oliver (Richard Mylan) was clearly modeled after Jeff Murdoch.  Like Jeff, Oliver is an easily-flustered, tongue-tied dork around women.  He's likeable enough though, but as a new character I felt he should have had a completely different role to add another dimension to the show.  Watching him you only wind up making comparisons to the inimitable Jeff. However the chemistry between goofy Oliver and dim-witted Jane has the effect of balancing their respective exaggerated personality traits out and makes scenes between these two characters especially engrossing.All of the characters have really grown on me over the seasons, particularly Ben Miles (The Forsyte Saga) an amazing actor who effortlessly manages to make the womanizing character he portrays (Patrick Maitland) loveable and utterly realistic.I am anxiously awaiting a fifth season!",5,A MUST for Coupling Fans,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,2709,"['Serious', 'Coupling', 'fans', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed', 'attractively', 'packaged', 'box', 'set', 'four', 'seasons', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'interviews', 'writer', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'wife', 'producer', 'Sue', 'Vertue', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'are', 'loosely', 'based', 'in-depth', 'scenes', 'look', 'making', 'show', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'Moffat', 'joined', 'various', 'members', 'cast', 'have', 'option', 'several', 'episodes', 'view', 'show', 'aired', 'watch', 'commentaries', 'taped', '.I', 'was', 'only', 'expecting', 'four', 'DVDs', 'containing', 'shows', 'was', 'utterly', 'delighted', 'seven', 'discs', 'holding', 'extras', 'sturdy', 'attractively', 'designed', 'pastel', 'cases', 'DVD', 'contained', 'are', 'cut', 'lots', 'cheap', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'there', 'nice', 'touch', 'too.When', 'first', 'happened', 'episode', 'Coupling', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'courtesy', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'was', 'surprised', 'poorly', 'written', 'produced', 'show', 'could', 'make', 'airwaves', 'failed', 'realize', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Moffat', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'writer', 'plots', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'absurd', 'point', 'consider', 'hard', 'core', 'fan.In', 'fourth', 'series', 'writing', 'overall', 'production', 'show', 'so', 'polished', 'very', 'little', 'resemble', 'slapped-together', 'quality', 'first', 'season', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'character', 'Jane', ""'stupid"", 'one', 'made', 'most', 'noticeable', 'transformation', 'fourth', 'series', ""'dumb"", 'brunette', 'act', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'point', 'being', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'better', 'anyway', 'far', 'less', 'grating', 'have', 'wonder', 'was', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'idea', 'fourth', 'series', 'suffer', 'little', 'loss', 'Jeff', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'especially', 'light', 'fact', 'character', 'Oliver', 'Richard', 'Mylan', 'was', 'clearly', 'modeled', 'Jeff', 'Murdoch', 'Jeff', 'Oliver', 'easily-flustered', 'tongue-tied', 'dork', 'women', 'likeable', 'enough', 'new', 'character', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'role', 'add', 'dimension', 'show', 'Watching', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'making', 'comparisons', 'inimitable', 'Jeff', 'However', 'chemistry', 'goofy', 'Oliver', 'dim-witted', 'Jane', 'effect', 'balancing', 'respective', 'exaggerated', 'personality', 'out', 'scenes', 'two', 'characters', 'especially', 'engrossing.All', 'characters', 'have', 'really', 'grown', 'seasons', 'particularly', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'amazing', 'actor', 'who', 'effortlessly', 'make', 'womanizing', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Maitland', 'loveable', 'utterly', 'realistic.I', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'fifth', 'season']",N/A

868074,A3OB3WDUN51D8A,B0006HBLU0,Sterling,"[0, 0]","Coupling is a superbly written and acted comedy. It depicts honestly various aspects and tribulations of real life mating rituals and relationships, without resorting to vulgarity, or profanity. The humor does not reflect only British culture, as sex has universal appeal. In addition some social values and stereotypes related to sex are explored in a witty, hilarious maner.For example, Jane who reports on traffic from a helicopter cannot be fired for incompetence, even after she tells motorists to close their eyes and meditate, which causes crashes and sends motorists to the hospital, or for misdirecting traffic so she can get home faster. When it comes down to longtime, loyal service of the station manager versus Jane's breasts, the manager ends out of a job.The funniest character is Jeff, played by Richard Coyle. His performance places him in the company of the greatest comedians of all time. Jeff was replaced in the fourth season by Oliver, who is not that funny.Comparison to the US sitcom Friends is not relevant. All episodes are intelligent, very funny, and some will bring tears to your eyes from laughter.

The resolutions of the multiple plots are inventive, surprising and just plain ""laugh out loud"" funny.
