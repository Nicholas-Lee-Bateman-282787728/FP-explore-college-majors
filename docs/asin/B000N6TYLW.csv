1054046,A11ZG7PKB6ZZZC,B000N6TYLW,A. Anderson,"[18, 20]","I wish shows would end while they are ahead instead of limping off sadly leaving fans with a bittersweet taste in the mouth.  Season 7 had a lot to clean up and I think it was not too badly done, overall.  As a rabid lover of GG, I can still say, with criticism of something I love, that this show took a horrific nosedive around the end of Season 5 and Season 6 was cringe-inducing at best.  The LL relationship was sweet and satisfying in Season 5 and Rory's life was interesting enough, until we got that horrible moment that revealed Rory cannot deal with life unless she's being lavished with praise.  The Mitchum freak-out never got called by its right name.  Instead we had a season 6 of ""poor little spoiled rotten brat Rory got yelled at by a meanie.""  Not only was Rory impossibly self-centered and obnoxious and disagreeable during season 6, but the LL relationship was BAD!  That relationship was borderline emotionally abusive.  I started violently disliking Luke (after he had been sweet for 5 years) and I just wanted Lorelai OUT.  So, yes, Season 7 had a lot to do.  They had to clean up Luke's personality and Rory's personality, make them likeable again, and they had to somehow bring us back our happy escapist show that once was.The new writers succeeded in making me like Rory and Luke again.  Rory had gotten so selfish that the only thing to do was just stop and rewrite her character, ignoring previous ""character growth.""  Which is what they did.  Instead of stomping and sulking around, fighting with her mother and grandparents, and making wild accusations like, ""the only reason you want your son to get a job is to separate him from me,"" suddenly she was sweet and modest again.  She reconnected with friends.  Maybe this sudden turn-around of character should be completely unrealistic, but I didn't care.  I was glad to be able to like Rory again.  On the other hand, rather than pretending that Luke had never been a jerk, the writers wrote in a very believable realization of faults on his part and regret over his behavior.  I liked when he threatened Kirk, ""If you do anything to hurt that sweet girl . . .""  And eventually he even apologized to Lorelai.  That needed to be done.  I am grateful to the Season 7 writers that characters become nice and loveable again.However, I don't think we ever got that special Stars Hollow feeling back again.  Season 6 took us away from our favorite charming alternate universe to a painful, unwatchable world of fracturing relationships where the old Lorelai and Rory did not even exist anymore.  Season 7 was not so harsh and so cold, but it continued along like a soap opera.  The show never slowed down (I mean in plot, not dialogue) and recaptured that perfect balance of family, work, romance, and cat funerals, swan attacks, biscotti-ballroom-dance-a-thons, etc.  In the early seasons, Lorelai's and Rory's romances, fun as they were, did not get center-stage.  There would be a Jess-heavy episode, and then an episode about the inn, and then about a fight with the parents, and then college applications.  GG, at the end, turned into your average 90210--One Tree Hill--Dawson's Creek type of show, and, while I am not knocking those shows, GG had always stood out because it was different.  Boys were important, but so were friends, family, literature, a work ethic, self-respect, and those wonderful little moments that make up life, like getting a cup of coffee with a friend.  The beauty of Gilmore Girls was in the details.  Season 7 did not have that.  We just got drama every week.  I find all that drama exhausting.  I prefer to watch the girls chatting about clothes or homework while strolling down the street.Season 6 was just plain bad, Season 7 was better than that, but still sub-par.  The older seasons are the best.  Since they had evidently lost the ability to create that kind of magic, it was time for the show to end.  I wish they had ended it before we suffered through Season 6.  But since we weren't that fortunate, I'm glad Season 7 wrapped things up as nicely as they did.",4,Not too badly done,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,4077,"['wish', 'shows', 'would', 'end', 'are', 'ahead', 'instead', 'limping', 'off', 'sadly', 'leaving', 'fans', 'bittersweet', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Season', '7', 'had', 'lot', 'clean', 'up', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'badly', 'done', 'overall', 'rabid', 'lover', 'GG', 'can', 'still', 'say', 'criticism', 'something', 'love', 'show', 'took', 'horrific', 'nosedive', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'cringe-inducing', 'best', 'LL', 'relationship', 'was', 'sweet', 'satisfying', 'Season', '5', 'Rory', 'life', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'got', 'horrible', 'moment', 'revealed', 'Rory', 'can', 'not', 'deal', 'life', 'being', 'lavished', 'praise', 'Mitchum', 'freak-out', 'never', 'got', 'called', 'right', 'name', 'Instead', 'had', 'season', '6', 'poor', 'little', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'brat', 'Rory', 'got', 'yelled', 'meanie', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Rory', 'impossibly', 'self-centered', 'obnoxious', 'disagreeable', 'season', '6', 'LL', 'relationship', 'was', 'BAD', 'relationship', 'was', 'borderline', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'started', 'violently', 'disliking', 'Luke', 'had', 'been', 'sweet', '5', 'years', 'just', 'wanted', 'Lorelai', 'OUT', 'So', 'yes', 'Season', '7', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'had', 'clean', 'up', 'Luke', 'personality', 'Rory', 'personality', 'make', 'likeable', 'again', 'had', 'somehow', 'bring', 'back', 'happy', 'escapist', 'show', 'once', 'was.The', 'new', 'writers', 'succeeded', 'making', 'Rory', 'Luke', 'again', 'Rory', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'selfish', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'was', 'just', 'stop', 'rewrite', 'character', 'ignoring', 'previous', 'character', 'growth', 'Which', 'what', 'did', 'Instead', 'stomping', 'sulking', 'around', 'fighting', 'mother', 'grandparents', 'making', 'wild', 'accusations', 'only', 'reason', 'want', 'son', 'get', 'job', 'separate', 'suddenly', 'was', 'sweet', 'modest', 'again', 'reconnected', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'sudden', 'turn-around', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'like', 'Rory', 'again', 'other', 'hand', 'rather', 'pretending', 'Luke', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'jerk', 'writers', 'wrote', 'very', 'believable', 'realization', 'faults', 'part', 'regret', 'behavior', 'liked', 'when', 'threatened', 'Kirk', 'do', 'anything', 'hurt', 'sweet', 'girl', 'eventually', 'even', 'apologized', 'Lorelai', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'am', 'grateful', 'Season', '7', 'writers', 'characters', 'become', 'nice', 'loveable', 'again.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'got', 'special', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'feeling', 'back', 'again', 'Season', '6', 'took', 'away', 'favorite', 'charming', 'alternate', 'universe', 'painful', 'unwatchable', 'world', 'fracturing', 'relationships', 'where', 'old', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'anymore', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'harsh', 'so', 'cold', 'continued', 'along', 'soap', 'opera', 'show', 'never', 'slowed', 'mean', 'plot', 'not', 'dialogue', 'recaptured', 'perfect', 'balance', 'family', 'work', 'romance', 'cat', 'funerals', 'swan', 'attacks', 'biscotti-ballroom-dance-a-thons', 'etc', 'early', 'seasons', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'romances', 'fun', 'were', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'center-stage', 'would', 'be', 'Jess-heavy', 'episode', 'then', 'episode', 'inn', 'then', 'fight', 'parents', 'then', 'college', 'applications', 'GG', 'end', 'turned', 'average', '90210', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'type', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'knocking', 'shows', 'GG', 'had', 'always', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'different', 'Boys', 'were', 'important', 'so', 'were', 'friends', 'family', 'literature', 'work', 'ethic', 'self-respect', 'wonderful', 'little', 'moments', 'make', 'up', 'life', 'getting', 'cup', 'coffee', 'friend', 'beauty', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'details', 'Season', '7', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'just', 'got', 'drama', 'week', 'find', 'drama', 'exhausting', 'prefer', 'watch', 'girls', 'chatting', 'clothes', 'homework', 'strolling', 'down', 'street.Season', '6', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'sub-par', 'older', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'had', 'evidently', 'lost', 'ability', 'create', 'kind', 'magic', 'was', 'time', 'show', 'end', 'wish', 'had', 'ended', 'suffered', 'Season', '6', 'were', ""n't"", 'fortunate', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Season', '7', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'as', 'nicely', 'did']",Gilmore Girls: Season 7

It has witty banter and a delightful use of the English language mixed with lots of lit and pop culture references.  Needless to say this was a smartly written series.  The acting on Lauren Graham and the entire cast is fabulous.That being said this final season is slightly odd compared to the rest.  The writing style and banter is still great, it just had an odd story line.  Luke and Lorelei have split, leaving Lorelei with Christopher for a good chunk of the season.  Rather creepy in my opinion.  Rory spends a few episodes pining for Logan, who is in London, then gets jealous over the Bobbi issue, and then doesn't mention Logan for an episode or two.  The is not much of the charming Luke/Lorelei interaction.  However Lane gets pregnant!

1054057,A20F0VHBQ48NFF,B000N6TYLW,Andromeda,"[8, 18]","The first thirteen epsoides were the worse in Gilmore history with Lorelei and Luke broken up Lorelei begins dating Christopher. No matter how hard the writers tried there was nothing they could do to convince me that no matter how desperate or stupid Lorelei was that she would ever date Rory's father Christopher given all of the crappy things he's done the past six seasons and his lack of help in raising Rory or supporting her (sure he's pays for a year and half of Yale but only because his grandfather died).  Every ep. did nothing but remind me how much I hate Christopher from his ""booty call"" in the Long Marrow, wanting to ship Gigi off to Paris to be with her mother who abandoned her for the last two years, to him pressuring Lorelei into marrying him without even calling or consulting Rory, to reaction to Lorelei's letter for Luke to help him retain get custidy of April and to his absense when Lorelei's father was in the hospital.  With Lorelei I was torn I should hate her for all the stupid moves she made in dating and marrying Christopher but I was never able to believe for one second the Lorelei we knew for the past six years would do either given all of the things Christopher's done kept me from hating her. The Lorelei who was on the screen with Christopher with her lack of emotion or feeling in what she said or did with Christopher was not the Lorelei we've known for the past six years.There was something really off with the writing and the charactors reaction to things. Like Rory, she was correctly upset to find out her parents' elope but it wasn't the elopement that angered her but that they did it without her. Shouldn't Rory have been more angry at her parents for eloping especially given the speed of their dating and all the baggage of the last twenty-two years? That would have been interesting and might have helped the storyline be a little believable. If the writers really wanted to convince us that Christopher and Lorelei were attempting to re-try things it would have been better to A) do it earlier in the series perhaps around the time of the last Lorelei and Christopher hook up at Sookie's wedding beause at the this late in the series no one cared. Secondly had the writers were trying to really make this storyline work they could have Christopher work hard to make up for things he did in the past or his lack of involvement with Rory (with something other then money Christopher inherited. To have him and Lorelei work through these issues and him and Rory, that would have made for interesting t.v. instead of what we watched. Every time Christopher was on the t.v. everything that was good, funny and witty about Gilmore Girls was gone. Once Christopher was gone for good it was back to the normal good Gilmore Girls. Like last season Lane's storyline came to be even more welcoming from the bad Christopher-Lorelei storyline, Lane returned from her horrible honeymoon the same Lane we all knew and loved and her mother's opinion about martial relations from the same bad hoenymoon.  Her and Zack's raction to her pregnancy was funny the same goes with their fears of telling Mrs. Kim and her reaction. I loved Mrs. Kim moving in with them and Lorelei settling their fight over how to raise the twins. I loved Zack stepping into Lane's job he was the happiest man I'd ever seen in the diner business and his adopting Luke as a father figure. Other things that were good (assided from the divorce) was Lorelei helping Emily after Richard's heart attack, their drunken night together, Lorelei riding the bike and going car shopping with Luke and of course Lorelei drunkenly singing ""I Will Always Love You"" first to Rory and then to Luke from the moment he stepped into the bar.  Rory was likable again for the first time since she met Logan half of her storylines stinked though the whole Marty thing was completely stupided and eighth grade material the same with her two stupided new friends Lucy and Olivia. They were too stupid for me to care about or want to care about and the same with Logan. I was so happy when he was shipped of to London I secretly hoped he'd never come back but just when my dislike for Logan slipped a bit with Rory's crush on the student teacher and being there when Richard was in the hospital it ended with the crash of his internet company. Logan immediately reverted back to the same person I hated drunk, not telling Rory, hiding out from his dad and going off to Vegas with Colin and Finn. That ended it. I didn't even find Logan's proposal to Rory at all romantic and expecting her to jump at marriage at moving clear across the country to California where he had a job, where he picked out a house for them, and where he had found two newspapers for Rory to work at make it clear Logan knew nothing about his girlfriend or what she really wanted. I liked Rory's meltdown about what she was going to do after graduating in French Twist very realistic and I also liked Rory being rejected by her dream job and other newspapers very realistic, interesting, and my favorite storyline for Rory. With each rejection you could see Rory getting nervous and scared as graduation drew closer. Listening to the plans of her friends while she had none I couldn't wait to see where this was going. Glimore Girls was finally on track with Luke and Lorelei slowly making their way back to each other and Rory's uncertain future which I hopeed would contiune on in season eight. Everything was wonderful then with only two eposides left it was canceled. I was (and still am) completely blown away. I never suspected it and all the writing and words from the writers telling us fans to be patient made it clear their would be an eighth season instead after seven years of watching Gilmore Girls even though the horrors of the first thirteen epsoides of this season of waiting for Luke and Lorelei to be together it was all going to end in two epsoides. No real warning, no real tying up of the storylines and no real farewell to the Gilmore Girls. Bon Voyage was wriittened to serve as either a season finale or series finale. It was an excellent epsoide don't get me wrong. I sobbed through the whole thing from the final Friday Night Dinner to Rory and Lane's last night together, to Luke and the town throwing the surprise party, Luke staying up all night sewing tarps together it was a wonderful and touching goodbye. It did well to tie up Lorelei and Rory's storyline. But I still feel like the fans deserve more seeing Luke and Lorelei get married as it was always promised more of Lorelei working out her relationship with her parents. Too borrow from Lorelei's lines ""I feel like I'm being ambushed"" with the cancelation, that ""its too soon"" and that ""I need more time"" at least to have a real farewell. I'm hoping the cast and writers will come back together either for an eighth season or even a two hour Gilmore Girls to do just that to end the show properly.",3,Three Stars,1182297600,"06 20,

The acting was stellar and all relationships were real and believable.  Especially Lorelai and Rory of course.Season 7 is a mixed bag - a very disappointing way for true Gilmore fans to say good-bye.  The season 5 ender with the infamous ""Will You Marry Me?"" was ideal Gilmore at its best.Sadly, the creators of Gilmore Girls, Amy SP and family, seemed to have not felt the Gilmore love as much as the Gilmore dedicated fans did.Many felt that the show should have ended with Lorelai and Luke together.  I loved them as a couple in season 5 as much as anyone but I would have been ok if they did part if the 6th and 7th season were as well written and up to par as all the previous superior Gilmore seasons.  One must remember that the trauma with Luke and Lorelai and the introduction of April was by Ms. Amy so things started to go wrong even with the original creative crew.  (I have always been a believer that when an addition that doesn't make sense occurs like the famous cousin on The Brady Bunch disaster is near.)  And that is what happened here.Season 7 could have evolved with exploring each character's journey and been of the highest caliber if it was realistic.  Lorelai marrying Christopher was not written in a way that made any sense.But I must move on to the positive and that is that subpar Gilmore is better than no Gilmore at all.  The excellent acting continued in season 7 and never has an ensemble clicked so well.  One of the greatest mistakes with Gilmore Girls was that the gifted Lauren Graham never received an Emmy let alone a nomination.  Her portrayal of Lorelai was filled with so many layers and dimensions it is truly one of the greatest characters ever.  Though the ensemble cast was so excellent she always held the show on her shoulders.  And she carries season 7 and manages to make silly plots and things that just didn't make sense seem more than real.  Lorelai was as real as ever and Lauren Graham saved the day.  She definitely got to use her acting chops in this season.If you are a true Gilmore fan as I am you must have this season - the set must be complete.  And watch season 7 to find joy and pleasure where you can.  The last half of the season hits its stride and the series did manage to end on a high note.I will always miss Gilmore Girls and it will always have a special place in my heart and soul.  It managed to become a part of me as all the real activities that happened in the fictitous town of Stars Hollow were exppertly written and acted.  This is a television classic and my dvds will never get dusty.Thanks for 7 seasons of pleasure and love.",4,GOOD-BYE WITH LOVE GILMORE GIRLS.......,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2722,"['Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'aired', 'mix', 'drama', 'humor', 'was', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'acting', 'was', 'stellar', 'relationships', 'were', 'real', 'believable', 'Especially', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'course.Season', '7', 'mixed', 'bag', 'very', 'disappointing', 'way', 'true', 'Gilmore', 'fans', 'say', 'good-bye', 'season', '5', 'ender', 'infamous', 'Will', 'Marry', 'was', 'ideal', 'Gilmore', 'best.Sadly', 'creators', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Amy', 'SP', 'family', 'seemed', 'have', 'not', 'felt', 'Gilmore', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'Gilmore', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'did.Many', 'felt', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Lorelai', 'Luke', 'together', 'loved', 'couple', 'season', '5', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ok', 'did', 'part', '6th', '7th', 'season', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'up', 'par', 'previous', 'superior', 'Gilmore', 'seasons', 'One', 'must', 'remember', 'trauma', 'Luke', 'Lorelai', 'introduction', 'April', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Amy', 'things', 'started', 'go', 'wrong', 'even', 'original', 'creative', 'crew', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'believer', 'when', 'addition', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'famous', 'cousin', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'disaster', 'what', 'happened', 'here.Season', '7', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'exploring', 'character', 'journey', 'been', 'highest', 'caliber', 'was', 'realistic', 'Lorelai', 'marrying', 'Christopher', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'way', 'made', 'sense.But', 'must', 'move', 'positive', 'subpar', 'Gilmore', 'better', 'Gilmore', 'excellent', 'acting', 'continued', 'season', '7', 'never', 'ensemble', 'clicked', 'so', 'well', 'One', 'greatest', 'mistakes', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'gifted', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'never', 'received', 'Emmy', 'let', 'alone', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Lorelai', 'was', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'dimensions', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'characters', 'ever', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', 'always', 'held', 'show', 'shoulders', 'season', '7', 'manages', 'make', 'silly', 'plots', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'real', 'Lorelai', 'was', 'as', 'real', 'ever', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'saved', 'day', 'definitely', 'got', 'use', 'acting', 'chops', 'season.If', 'are', 'true', 'Gilmore', 'fan', 'am', 'must', 'have', 'season', 'set', 'must', 'be', 'complete', 'watch', 'season', '7', 'find', 'joy', 'pleasure', 'where', 'can', 'last', 'half', 'season', 'stride', 'series', 'did', 'manage', 'end', 'high', 'note.I', 'will', 'always', 'miss', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'soul', 'managed', 'become', 'part', 'real', 'activities', 'happened', 'fictitous', 'town', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'were', 'exppertly', 'written', 'acted', 'television', 'classic', 'dvds', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'dusty.Thanks', '7', 'seasons', 'pleasure', 'love']",Gilmore Girls: Season 7

At least give us a season 8 where Loreli and Luke actually gets married and decides on a house, let her get pregnant for him and have a child.  Let Miss Patty find her true love.  Where did Dean go, did his marriage to Christine ever get back on track?  What about Kurt and LuLu?  Is Taylor still running everyone crazy?  How did Rory do on the campaign?

Over the years I have seen so much light and happiness come from the show. So much so that I actually found myself laughing at some of the jokes that was said way after the show was over. One of my favorite episodes of the past was A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving. This is an episode that has slid easily into the Thanksgiving playlist while I cook dinner.Over the years we have seen Chris come and go. He left Lorelai when she was a young girl to raise a daughter on her own. In the first season he came unexpectedly to visit. After that, he came back and brought Sherri, his live-in girlfriend, to town to meet Rori and not so much Lorelai. As the time marched on he decided he was going to leave Sherri and make things work with Lorelai. He made Rori a promise that he was not going to just up and leave again. A few minutes later he decided to go home to be with his girlfriend because she was pregnant. Let's not forget about Emily and Richards's vowel renewal, when he showed up and broke up Lorelai and Luke. He has a track record for being careless, self-centered, and vapid. That was where his involvement with Lorelai should have been left. Imagine my shock and dismay at the end of Season 6 when Lorelai, understandable irritated that Luke would not commit to marry her, decided to jump in bed with Chris. I was hoping that the first three episodes of season 7 were going to deal with playing out this mini-romance and get Lorelai back on the road to Luke. I was wrong. Instead they had most of the season be all about Chris and his hang-ups. Richard got sick and Chris was not even there. When he got to the hospital he had an attitude because Luke was there taking the place of what Chris should have been doing. Then he gets mad because Lorelai was holding Liz's baby and then threw a hissy fit that she did not want to have kids right away with him. Lorelai's character was written to be smart. When it came to matters of the heart, we knew that she could be dense but she was never stupid. I found it unbelievable that her character was supposed to be made to stand by Chris while he acted like a petulant child. Even when he bailed on her for what looks like the third time she still was trying to keep him in the marriage. What happened to the Lorelai personality that would have kicked him to the curb the same way she did Luke when he would not commit to a wedding date? I did not like the Chris character being developed because he was not really moved along and matured; he continued to act like a stupid child over EVERYTHING!!Rori's character was moved backwards. She was a strong, mature individual who always knew what she wanted. She always made lists and pros and con's to make decisions and that was something that made her character soar. What I saw go out the window was the fact that she was too sensitive and unhappy all the time. She complained and she was moody and was all together not a fun character to watch. She lobbied for Logan and their relationship. She wanted to marry him and, in fact, was the first to use the ""L"" word in season 6. Imagine my shock to see that she turned down his marriage proposal. She wanted to marry him, fancied being with him so much that she decided to move in with him when she had nowhere to go. She stole a boat with him and alienated her mother over their relationship. Why did she turn down the proposal? What was the actions and thought processes that led up to that? Did she make a pro-con list or did she only get her advice from Paris who, lets face it, had the same issue she had and kept her boyfriend while telling Rori the relationship may not have been right for her because of the distance. I did not like the fact that she listened to Paris when it came to matters of the heart because Paris was never one who would allow her feelings to influence what she said. Her character was irrational, blunt, and not always correct but made to be correct because she was louder than everyone else. I find it very unbelievable that this decision looks like it was based on a one time conversation with her. I also found it unbelievable that Lorelai, the one who always have something to say, had no real opinion on the matter. Her reaction was stale and not really true to the way the real character would have reacted.All in all, I think with Amy not being at the helm there were a lot of issues as far as trying to capture the essence of the characters. I truly think that this season was the worst one to date. Luke and Lorelai should have gotten married. I would hope that they would put out a movie to set everything right. Luke and Lorelai married and Rori and Logan getting engaged and married, showcasing the Huntsburgers reaction. The spark was gone and down went the show. I just saw this season a few days ago and I cannot remember much of the dialogue because it was not meaningful, heartfelt, or realistic. Shame.

The second reason is that if you own the first 6, you cannot leave a collection incomplete, regardless of how the Palladino's departure affected things.  This was easily the best written show on television.  Although it never truly got the respect and ratings it deserved.  For those who have never seen this show, it is a true gem and I recommend you watch every episode.  Better yet, own every episode.

I'm a male, a musician (in fact, I used to play in two bands with a very famous drummer that Lane mentions in one episode in the series, much to mine and my daughter's delight!), and I am dad. But surprisingly, from time to time, I come cross other men, and male guitar students of mine, who love the show, as well. (Generally, I find it's the more ""intelligent"" and less narrow minded, amongst said ""males""!)I truly enjoyed reading ""Andromeda's"" review (beautiful name, by the way!), and it's too bad she couldn't have written for the show! Perhaps it might still be in production!Finally, when I saw the final show on television, I was left with the feeling that the series was ""up in the air"", so to speak. In other words, it seemed like a ""just in case, this is the last season"" sort of ending, and it could have been much better. As far as another season goes, time is running out, and it dosen't help that some of the season's stars are now becoming movie stars. However, I think there's a genuine possibility that a sort of ""reunion"" show could be possible. Two hours worth would be nice, but it would take everyone writing to Warner Brothers, as well as to the cast members, Ms. Palladino, etc. and don't think it can't be done!! When enough dvd buyers pressured CBS to continue making, and changing back the original soundtrack for the classic television series, ""The Fugitive"", they finally gave in!

Toteda,"[82, 94]","After crying all throughout the series finally I have to say that it really was time to say goodbye and I would buy this seasons set for the last episode alone!  That scene when Lorelai and Luke make-up is precious and as a fan of the show from the beginning I truly feel that in that moment Lorelai is completely happy, and she finally realized that Luke is a big part of that happiness.  The show has definitely had it's up and downs but I'm giving it 5 stars because as a whole I have never seen a show like this one and don't think I ever will. I often feel that GG fans are so hard on the show because they really don't realize how good we had it, we got use to such a high standard of writing and acting that anything less brought out red flags.  Nonetheless, it seems unreasonable to think that the series could keep that standard for every episode in every season, especially after the original creators left abruptly after the sixth season.  So whatever that's worth I feel this show is a great investment and although it's centered around a mother-daughter relationship, a lot of men like the show as well even though they might not like to admit it:-)Growing up with the Gilmore Girls has been such a pleasure and I cannot wait for the day when I can re-watch the series with my daughter and relive all that funny banter, crazy town meetings and just all the wonderfully unique characters...I think Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson will go down as having some of the best chemistry on TV as we watched their love grow and Alexis Bledel has a great future ahead.

There are really no characters on this show that you can't stand, even the ex-boyfriends, and the meddling grandparents (they are among my absolute favorites).I must say, though it pains me, that the innocent family-friendly beginnings of this show took a turn when Rory decided to sleep with her old boyfriend (the married Dean). I know this gave the show an edgy quality, but honestly I liked the show better before this change. We have had enough ""soap opera"" programming like One Tree Hill, 90210, etc. I continued to watch, even though I was disappointed, because the characters were dear and charming. I couldn't believe the episode where they try to decide what color to paint the living room. Please! They appealed to a smarter audience than that. Also, in the real world she would have married Logan. She helped him become a great guy. And even though I wasn't ""head over heel"" for him in the beginning, I doubt she could do better. They really grew together as a couple. That is what true couples do. Let her wait 10 years to become a lonely reporter, and then she can realize her mistake when she runs into Logan with his wife and family.Even so...I was still sad to see this show go off the aire. I think it would have recovered nicely given another season. I really wanted to see Luke and Lorelai together, married and with a little bundle on the way (I'm sure I'm not alone here).

1054087,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000N6TYLW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 16]","""Gilmore Girls"" has finished its seventh and final season and now fans will have to wait patiently for it to come out on DVD to complete our sets (i.e., everybody reading this review is waiting to pre-order this set having already watched all of these episodes).  The seventh season has been the most disappointing one by far, and when it was announced on the eve of the series finale that the show was not coming back, I had convinced myself in my own mind that this was a good thing.  After Rory literally turned away from her mother at the end of the fifth season (""A House is Not a Home""), I really did not care about her again until she called up Mitchum Huntzburger and read him the riot act when Logan was in the hospital (""Super Cool Party People"").  Then Lorelai ends the sixth season in Christopher's bed (""Partings"") and I am spending almost the entire seventh season unhappy with her character.  Not as upset by the fact Lauren Graham never even received a single Emmy nomination, but enough to allow the heresy of hoping the show would be cancelled if this was what we were going to have to endure from here on in.I remain convinced that when creator Amy Sherman-Palladino walked away from the show that she put Lorelai in Christopher's bed as the season six cliffhanger knowing that the show would not be able to write its way out of that situation.  But it turns out that Graham, now also a producer for the show, argued for other romantic complications because she thought it made the story better.  I still maintain that breaking up Luke and Lorelai was the biggest mistake the show ever made, reducing it to being just another soap opera.  I thought the whole point of putting off the inevitable and devoutly wished for union of Lorelai and Luke for four seasons was that when it happened it would not be a deathblow to the romantic dynamic as it was on ""Moonlighting.""  I remember when Luke was up on the roof telling Lorelai that he had to tell Rory about the engagement and that he was not happy being in the middle (""Fight Face""), and I saw this as clear evidence the two could still have funny fights as a romantic couple.  There was a bit of this at the end of the seventh season (""It's Just Like Riding a Bike""), but that just added insult to injury since it proves they could have been doing this all along.You see, for me a key element in a dramatic romance is the Grand Gesture.  Luke's Grand Gesture is to not only organize a surprise graduation/bon voyage party for Rory, but to stay up all night sewing together the tent because it is going to rain (""Bon Voyage"").  What is Christopher's Grand Gesture?  To use his inherited money to pay a restaurant staff to get up in the middle of the night to make a fancy dinner for him and Lorelai (""French Twist"").  Forget about Lorelai's inherent distrust about wealth and her carving out a life on her own financially, I want to know where is her moral outrage as a person who runs a successful inn over the sort of guest who would pull that sort of crap?  So Luke has Christopher beat from start to finish in the Grand Gesture department, but at least Christopher had one, which is more than we can say for Logan and his proposal to Rory (""Unto the Breach"").  Talk about ending a relationship with a whimper.The ironic theme of season seven seems to be ignoring the obvious, of which Christopher is the most gifted, proving once and for all he is an outsider.  After all, Christopher seems to have no idea that Lorelai's friendship is forever (""To Whom It May Concern""), that she loves Stars Hollow as much as it loves her (""Knit, People, Knit""), and that Luke is still a better friend to Lorelai than Christopher is a husband (""I'd Rather be in Philadelphia"").  If I could change one thing in the final seaon it would be having Christopher go to Luke, admit that he took advantage of Lorelai every step of the way and that he knows Luke is the right man of Lorelai.  Instead, Christopher sulks away (""Farewell, My Pet""), and it takes several episodes just to have Lorelai and Luke even acknowledge the elephant in the room let alone talk about it.  This delaying action increased my sense of frustration rather than heightened my anticipation towards a happy reunion.The CW's promotion of the series finale (""Bon Voyage"") made the gross mistake of giving away what was going to happen with Lorelai and Luke (I would have loved to have heard a heartfelt comeback from her regarding his declaration that all he wants to do is see her be happy instead of going right for the kiss).  It should have been a moment we could enjoy, such as the big moment a couple of weeks earlier when Lorelai is singing ""I Will Always Love You"" to Rory on karaoke night and you just knew Luke was going to walk into the bar and she was going to end up singing it to him instead (""Lorelai? Lorelai?"").  But the promos totally took away the sense of anticipation, and so the choice moments ended up being a couple of emotional exchanges between Lorelai and her parents, which reminds me: another problem was that Richard and Emily were woefully absent from episodes in the first half of the final season.  Good thing they were around for the end because it was what Richard said to Lorelai and what Lorelai said to Emily, along with the final scene bringing us full circle that finally persuaded me to round up on the seventh season (I guess I like the characters too much to stay mad at them forever).The last episode was supposed to work as either the season finale or the series finale, but it clearly leans towards the latter from start to finish.  I was worried that the show would forgo the opportunity to say goodbye, as it were, but the party for Rory covered that bet.  I also thought that when Christiane Amanpour she was going to serve as a ""deus ex machina"" to get Rory a job, but they did not go that route.  Then I was worried that they might do the whole ""Six Feet Under"" ending with Rory driving away into the future.  However, they went for a simple final scene, allowing viewers to project the futures they want onto the characters.  Of course, those wanting more explicit resolutions to various relationships will be underwhelmed.  I do wish that what I assume were to be the final two-word line that Sherman-Palladino had in mind for the series (to wit, ""Thanks, Mom"") had been uttered explicitly, but I think the sentiment is still there.",4,"For better or worse, the ""Gilmore Girls"" come to the fork at the end of the road",1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,6410,"['Gilmore', 'Girls', 'finished', 'seventh', 'final', 'season',

The characters that inhabited Stars Hollow were truly special and unique. The well written dialogue and monologues were amazingly said and acted. Only the Gilmore Girls could launch into their monologues with so much intensity. The witty talk and banter was really another character in the show. Words had their own personality and place in the world of Stars Hollow.All the seasons were excellent, except when Lorelai and Rory stopped talking. I was truly hurting for them. How can you have the Gilmore girls if they don't talk to each other. That aside, all the seasons were excellent.The seventh season was good (except when Chris entered the picture). I was disappointed with what they did to Chris' character. He turned into a jealous (although there was reason for this), immature man-child who failed to support Lorelai when she needed him the most. Luke had kept the secret about his daughter in Season 6 (after launching into a monologue directed at Lorelai about how secrets...hypocrite much?!). Lorelai, who had been a strong woman, flawed but strong, became this even more flawed character that cheated on Luke after he failed to accept her ultimatum to elope in Season 6. She moved away from the Lorelai we knew and loved. Season 6 was a very contentious season and it was a challenge to fix things on Season 7.Although this season was not as good as the previous ones, after all, it was missing the Sherman-Palladino team...it did well. But, the show no longer had the amazing witty banter that characterized the show, what actually made it what it was. I appreciate that they ended the show now, rather than continuing without the Sherman-Palladino team. It would have degraded episode by episode.Still, there were great moments and episodes in Season 7. I loved every moment where Lorelai and Luke talked. When Lorelai sang at karaoke night, ""I will always love you"" (directed at Luke), I screamed with delight...It was one of the best moments of the entire show.The show had a good series finale. Luke became Lorelai's hero once again, not that he ever stopped being it, and organized Rory's farewell party.What a truly amazing series. The cast was one of a kind.

1054102,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000N6TYLW,Robert Moore,"[451, 477]","Warning!  Spoilers!There really isn't another show quite like THE GILMORE GIRLS.  No other series so thoroughly dedicated to words.  There are no doubt other series with great talk:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER definitely comes to mind.  But no other show that I know put language and witty talk so completely at the heart of what it was trying to do.  Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said that she was inspired by great Hollywood comedies like the Thin Man series and HIS GIRL FRIDAY (one of the few films where the characters talked faster than they did on THE GILMORE GIRLS).  And for five absolutely brilliant and one less than brilliant season the show was magical beyond any reasonable expectation.  Then came Season Seven.  I still watched with great interest.  Well, until the marriage to Chris part (I asked a friend to tell me when Lorelei and Chris busted up and stayed away until they did).  Season Seven was not a truly awful season.  There were still many great moments during the year, including an absolutely splendid series finale, but by the end the show was having fewer and fewer of those wonderful moments that made it so special.One major reason Season Seven struggled so much was the absence of the show's guiding genius.  During contract negotiations at the end of Season Six, the WB offered Amy and her co-producer husband Daniel Palladino a one-year contract.  She wanted the respect to be offered a two-year contract.  The WB refused to budge and she and Daniel left the show.  Since the two of them had either written or directed separately or together the bulk of the episodes on the show, the loss was irreparable.  The show was built mainly around great talk, but what happens when the person most responsible for that talk leaves?  Unfortunately, the brilliance of the talk went with them.Those left behind tried gamely to carry on.  But they also had the misfortune to be left with the remnants of an exceedingly bad story arc that Amy left behind.  Most fans of THE GILMORE GIRLS came to dislike Lorelei at times during Season Six, including Lauren Graham.  While most agreed that Luke was being too secretive about learning that he had a daughter he knew nothing about, most also felt that Lorelei's reaction was excessive.  She became pushy and needy and impatient and just generally unlikable.  Then incredibly stupid by giving Luke an ultimatum to either elope on the spot or lose her.  And Season Six ended with her sleeping with Luke.This whole story arc has to be laid at the feet of Amy Sherman-Palladino and the show had no choice but to continue the arc in Season Seven.  As brilliant as Amy was over the first five seasons, the falling apart of Luke and Lorelei's relationship in Season Six and then whole Chris mess in Season Seven were her worst contributions to the show.  Luckily, it didn't last forever.  By the end of the season Rory had graduated from Yale and Lorelei was yearning to be with Luke, acutely conscious of what she had lost.The season ended on some of the best moments of the year.  One memorable episode had all of Stars Hollow laid out as a vast maze, in a weird plan by Taylor that for once truly worked out.  Lorelei and Luke meet and express some of the regrets that they had felt for some time.  It was a great moment.  But the highpoint of the season and one of the highpoints of the entire series occurred in a scene in which Rory gets her mother drunk enough to sing on karaoke night.  She starts off singing Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" (and the Dolly Parton arrangement, not the overly ornate butchering that Whitney Houston did) in Rory's direction.  But Luke walks in as she sings and inevitably her gaze shifts.  As she sings (and quite well, thank you), you see a world of conflicting emotions overcoming her:  regret, yearning, hope, resignation, good will, and love.  I don't know of another actress on TV other than Lauren Graham who could have pulled it off.  It was one of those utterly perfect TV moments that reminded me not just why I watch THE GILMORE GIRLS but TV in general.Until the very end of the season it appeared that there was going to be a Season Eight.  The CW (which had taken over the show when the WB and UPN merged) hoped to have a 13 or 16 episode shortened season, but in the end Lauren Graham and Alexis Bedell, who were both up for contract renewal, declined to sing new contracts.  But after seeing what turned out to be the series finale I am almost grateful of their decision.  What a lovely end to a wonderful series!  Few shows get to go out perfectly, but THE GILMORE GIRLS managed one of the most perfect finales ever.  As Luke marshals the town for a farewell party (on one day's notice) we get a beautiful episode that allows us both to see all our favorite characters one last time and to say goodbye to them.  Everything that should have been done was done.  Rory is off to join the Barack Obama campaign as a reporter.  Lorelei, when Sookie tells her that the planning of the party ""was all Luke,"" realizes that Luke, who is sometimes slow to speak, has shown how he feels about her with actions.  When she thanks him and he tells her that he likes to see her happy you know that they are going to be fine.  You don't even need the kiss that follows.  And the series ends just as it began seven years earlier, Lorelei and Rory sitting in Luke's diner.I'm not sure that this is a show that can be replaced.  Some shows are sui generis, truly one of a kind.  This is one of those.  The premise of a mother and daughter who were best friends was at the heart, but it didn't make it unique.  It was the combination of the amazing group of characters, the wonderful town, and the endless stream of magnificently written scripts.I want to end by praising Lauren Graham.  This was a great cast with a number of remarkably gifted actors.  But Lauren Graham towered above them all.  The Emmys never did her justice.  It is almost inconceivable that she never received a single Emmy nomination.  Yet for seven years she was without serious competition the finest actress on television.  How can such a travesty occur and the Emmys not feel a profound sense of shame?  It is true that last year the Emmys were ""reformed"" in order to make it possible for deserving performers more likely to be nominated.  Lauren Graham's name was the one mentioned as an example of such a performer.  Yet even with reform she didn't receive a nomination.  But to me her performance as Lorelei is one of the great achievements of television acting.  No one came anywhere close to her in handling comedy; no one could rival her delivery of the machine-gun like dialogue.  But neither could many rival her with drama.  The karaoke scene I mentioned is a perfect example.I will truly miss this series.",4,A less than perfect ending to one of TV's most unique series,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,6796,"['Warning',

1054103,A1E12CWVAJYDM2,B000N6TYLW,rocky mt lady,"[3, 4]","All great things come to an end. Who doesn't love Stars Hollow and all the inhabitants. It makes you yearn for the quirkyness of small town America. Yet the finale was disappointing because it sort of closed it down with bad results. Dean said it best to Luke in an earlier episode, they need more, meaning they weren't the guys for either Lorali or Rory.It made sense that Lorali would seek Christopher for solace after Luke turned down her ultimatum as the cliff hanger season finale. He was a lingering constant from her past and she knew he cared for her when Luke couldn't/wouldn't decide. He would be the arms she turned to. Where they went with that story line could have been vastly improved.Luke proved a bad match when he was on the valentine weekend, he couldn't alter his routine or step out of the diner w/o being a fish out of water. He was and always would be small town. A good friend who helped Lorali with her life but not a good life partner. She came from a different world, she retreated to a small town to raise her daughter, but she wasn't really small town. She probably would sell the inn and take to traveling like the offer her dad mentioned being a consultant for a major chain of hotels. With Rory not there, she wouldn't have a reason to stay, she was up for grander adventures. And though I didn't like the way the plot unraveled between her and Christopher, I think the date night was awesome with a mustang, a barn and an old movie, he was on the right track in Paris, and with his new found means, he would have been able to show her the world. They were more in sync, having similar backgrounds. He got her, Luke never did. I didn't like that they have him wimp out. I don't think coming from the background he did, he wouldn't rise to be the man she really needed. He made a go with Gigi, so he would have figured out a better stragedy with Lorali. He wanted to make it right, and first loves are powerful, it had so much possibility to tap into and they tanked it badly in my opinion.Rory, she tested the waters with Logan, and he showed her the benefits of being of the Gilmore background. But he wasn't what she needed either. He was trying to force her into his life TOO MUCH as the fix it piece. A world that she didn't like because he used people and his priviledge in the wrong manner. She would never be Huntzburger material, she was ABOVE them all. She wanted to conquer the world and so her going off on a campaign trail w/o Logan would be the right move for her. That was the right story line ending there.Lane, her and Zach, ah NO! She was smart, she went after what she wanted despite her restrictions. She found creative solutions. She WAS the band, they didn't do anything, she pushed them to success. It made NO sense for her not to get out and explore the world she was kept from and hooking up with Zach, who was slow and not motivated at all was a waste for her enterprising character. They could have done better by her character out exploring the whole music scene or bringing it to town and it creating havoc. She was more than waitress material, more than just settling to be a mom of twins at an early age. Not with all the spunk and determination she displayed throughout the show. She deserved to shine a bit before settling down to momhood. She could have shown Stars Hollow how to ROCK, ha!Luke, nice hometown guy who did right by people. He was better off with Anna and April. They should have put them together and left them in Stars Hollow. Have them rebuy the Twickham Mansion and populate it, more believable then he and Lorali. They had tension, a bit of heat, but no real staying power for a lasting relationship. She would have been bored in 6 mths after a marriage to him. He saw to her needs, but he didn't stretch her, she was always pulling him to expand and her character wouldn't stick with that long. Besides flannel and army jackets never mix with designer dresses and heels, be serious! He wanted to camp out, she wanted a 4 star hotel. No real common ground.I think it would have been best to have glimpses of Lorali and Rory reminiscing on Stars Hollow from the future. Sort of like a back to the future episode plot all done from the dining table of Emily and Richard, looking at how the town was right for them until their lives would part after Rory's graduation. It was a great place to rear Rory, but then it birthed them to greater things outside once she was raised. Life would go on there quietly as before. The Bon Voyage was appropriate, but it should have been both of them leaving and going on adventures. As they were destined for so much more!!!!! Rory a news correspondant, and Lorali a consultant, and finding more suitable men...That would be my ending, ha!",3,Gilmore Finale,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,4757,"['great', 'things', 'come',

1054105,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B000N6TYLW,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[6, 6]","I admit, I read the spoilers and Season 7 episode summaries (DVD insert) before watching the final season of my favorite TV show. I always wait to watch the show only after a complete season has come out on DVD, as catching the occasional, commercials-ridden WB/CW episode would be frustrasting and incomplete.  So, it was like Christmas before Thanksgiving when my long-awaited Gilmore Girls Amazon order arrived this past Tuesday. Since Tuesday, I've done little else besides watching episode after episode until I finally made my way through the entire season this evening.I was expecting the worst.  Review after review bemoaned how all standards had gone to pot after Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino split when the CW didn't meet their demands.  I was prepared for forced dialogue, the stellar wit that set this show apart (and kept its viewers on their toes) taking a nose dive.  What I found, however, was that the Gilmore magic was still there, witty dialogue intact.  Yes, a lot of things happen during this season, a sort of ""pulling out all of the stops"" in terms of plot twists and turns.  Yet Christopher and Lorelai's marriage and subsequent divorce plans didn't seem as contrived as it sounded when I read complaining reviews and the DVD insert.  Yes, it was  a rebound, impulsive marriage, but it was made more plausible by Christopher and Lorelai's (lifelong) history, Rory's paternity, and Lorelai's personality.  I even briefly rooted for this doomed marriage, despite my preference for Luke.Other storylines: lucky Lane, who proves that one time is all it takes, knocked up during her disastrous honeymoon, and even luckier Sookie (pregnant with baby #3 after her husband's noncompliance with a vasectomy mandate); though both women eventually come to terms with their pregnancy and see it as a blessing. Luke gets partial custody of April (I wish I had been that together in the eighth grade); unfortunately, Lorelai's written character reference for Luke in the custody battle threatens Christopher, cementing divorce plans.  The one plot twist that I thought was unconvincing/completely out-of-character was Logan's ""now or never"" marriage proposal. Usually, Logan wasn't a now-or-never kinda guy, and he only recently turned 25 himself. He should have known to give Rory her time and space before expecting such a commitment.  I guess the writers wanted us to know definitively that this relationship wasn't going to work out whereas Luke and Lorelai were (hopefully) in it for the long haul. Though if you analyze Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" lyrics (Lorelai's unintentional ""serenade"" to Luke during a tipsy, countrified rendition of this early 90's hit), or see the movie, ""The Bodyguard"" (which I haven't), you get that the two lovers never get together, despite their mutual sentiment and goodwill.  But the kiss on the lips sealed the deal for my interpretation--hopefully, they'll work through whatever is holding them back and get together.I love Luke's characterization (though the grunge flannels and backwards baseball cap gets a little old); he's such a sweet guy.  Kirk is over-the-top as usual, beyond quirky but a little short of DSM-IV, nonfunctioning insanity.  Paris and Doyle are so cute together, and Doyle will follow wherever Paris leads.  Richard and Emily are still Richard and Emily, but they show their appreciation for Rory (and Richard tells Lorelai that Stars Hollow's tribute to Rory is as much a celebration of Lorelei as it is of Rory--I was bawling unabashedly during this scene, along with Luke's ""I just want to see you happy"" gesture to Lorelai).  Emily seems to be one of those ""one step forward, two steps backwards"" types of people (the way she treats her maids and ""socioeconomic inferiors"" is an obvious sign of unhappiness, i.e., how an uppity attitude backfires).  When you see her softer side, you see her dark side in full-form a few scenes later.  Yet it was sweet when she contrived a plan to keep Lorelai in her life.  She was going to spot Lorelai a loan to improve the Dragonfly, with Friday dinners (mutated to business get-togethers from time-to-time) part of the interest-free arrangement.  But Lorelai promised that she would continue coming to Friday night dinners without any other reason than to keep in touch with her parents, as these dinners were now a well-established ritual.Yes, like other fans, I'd like a ring on Lorelai's finger and an exchange of vows with Luke, but a kiss will have to suffice.  Yes, like other fans, I'd LOVE a WB 2-hour TV movie to wrap up loose ends and let us glimpse into Gilmore World for just a little longer.  But my rewatching the seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls will have to suffice for the time being.Loved the extras that featured a day in the life of Keiko Agena and the Gilmore Fashionistas.  I love Lorelai and Rory's wardrobe...all those beautiful clothes just sitting in storage (did I mention that Lauren Graham and I are about the same height and build?)...But mostly, I just love this show.  Kudos to the creators and writers of this very special TV series.",5,And I will always love this show (tribute to Lorelei's karaoke),1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,5114,"['admit', 'read', 'spoilers',

The love and friendship of a single mother and her daughter has honestly made me jealous and wish i had the relationship with my mom like that. Mine is more like Lorelai and her mother. The love and protectiveness of a small town is like another family...a crazy family. That town definitely has its own uniqueness and i can see why Lorelai chose this town to live in it fits her quite well...This show has made me smile and cry and angry...but this last season has made me extremely disappointed and left feeling....how could they let this show go?!?! When its the last season of a series i always seem to take forever to watch it cuz i dont want to know how they make it end and will it be just as good as throughout the whole thing and will it answer everything....Well there was answers left unsaid and you end up thinking well what does really happen. For this kind of show I want to know and they just ended it up so quick and you could tell in my opinion that they didnt want it to end but they just wrapped it up as quickly as they can but try to leave the impression that they started with the show. and thats love, friendship, laughs and just a good feeling.Im definitely disappointed in how it ended. but it was a good series and all the other seasons are good and this season is good but just a sad one cuz of the ending just not how you picture this series to end i guess.",3,Disappointed Gilmore Girl,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1465,"['love', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'such', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'friendship', 'single', 'mother', 'daughter', 'honestly', 'made', 'jealous', 'wish', 'i', 'had', 'relationship', 'mom', 'Mine', 'more', 'Lorelai', 'mother', 'love', 'protectiveness', 'small', 'town', 'family', 'crazy', 'family', 'town', 'definitely', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Lorelai', 'chose', 'town', 'live', 'quite', 'well', 'show', 'made', 'smile', 'cry', 'angry', 'last', 'season', 'made', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'left', 'feeling', '.how', 'could', 'let', 'show', 'go', 'When', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'i', 'always', 'seem', 'take', 'forever', 'watch', 'cuz', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'whole', 'thing', 'will', 'answer', 'everything', '.Well', 'was', 'answers', 'left', 'unsaid', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'well', 'what', 'really', 'happen', 'kind', 'show', 'want', 'know', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'so', 'quick', 'could', 'tell', 'opinion', 'didnt', 'want', 'end', 'just', 'wrapped', 'up', 'as', 'quickly', 'can', 'try', 'leave', 'impression', 'started', 'show', 'thats', 'love', 'friendship', 'just', 'good', 'feeling.Im', 'definitely', 'disappointed', 'how', 'ended', 'was', 'good', 'series', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'good', 'season', 'good', 'just', 'sad', 'one', 'cuz', 'ending', 'just', 'not', 'how', 'picture', 'series', 'end', 'i', 'guess']",Gilmore Girls: Season 7

1054111,A2CZXIEBCR4YCY,B000N6TYLW,The Opinionista,"[16, 40]","WARNING:  FULL OF SPOILERSI watched The Gilmore Girls since day 1 and loved it, even though it had some big flaws:1. The show was too elitist. There was not a single important African-American character (Michel is French).  I feel the writers in season 7 were keenly aware of this and tried to somehow make up for it by having a black nurse with a couple of good lines confronting Emily, and having Emily admit to finding Will Smith charming.  Too little, too late; but more than the Palladinos did in 6 years.Another example of this elitism is how they treat the Lane story line.  A Korean-American who is as smart and well-read as Rory, ends up as a waitress in Luke's diner married to a total dimwit.  In real life, she whould have gotten 1 or 2 scholarships to Ivy League schools;  And Zach would have just been a summer crush instead of the father of her twin boys!2.  Most characters were obnoxious at one point or another.  The most obnoxious one being Michel.  I would not have been sad to see him leave the show.  Taylor, Kirk, Emily, Richard, Sookie,TJ, even Lorelei and Rory got on my nerves at time.  I think this was truly the fault of the writers who pushed the character flaws or rapid-fire lines to the max for comic impact.3.  Season 6 was horrible, starting with Luke finding out he had a daughter and the whole Lane/Zach relationship: PLEASE!!!!.NOW FOR SEASON 7:Unlike most reviewers, I think the departure of the Palladinos was a good thing.  The dialogue slowed down a bit, allowing more emotion to shine through, more in-depth look at the characters, and yet keeping the same level of humor.  In other words, the show remains witty but much less superficial.  I am left wondering if these new writers had had a couple of more seasons, what they could have come up with.  They did a pretty good job considering the mess the Palladinos left behind.Again, unlike most reviewers, I never went for the Luke/Lorelei romance.  Luke summed up my feelings on this subject well when he said ""Lorelei will remain Lorelei, and I will remain the guy who pours coffee for her"". I think they were great friends, but they did nothing for me as a  couple.  I had felt cheated when Christopher and Lorelei were getting together and had to stop due to Sherry's pregnancy in an earlier season.  So it was great for me to see them together in Season 7; I was really rooting for them to stay together and was sad for both when it ended.  That said, the way the writers developed the story and it's end was really well done.  And I can see that the pressure from the audience was too big for the Luke/Lorelei pairing; so I can understand.Now for Rory, again most reviewers will not agree with me.  I thought the Jess/Rory story line was great.  Whenever Jess was onscreen it was amazing, and there was just pure chemistry between Rory and him.  I would have loved seeing them end up together, especially since he cleaned up his act and became a writer.  But Logan came in, and after a while he grew on me.  So having them go through so much, and splitting them up at the end was very disappointing.  I felt so bad for Logan when he walks away from Rory after she returns the ring.  I could not believe that they end with Lane and Zach; and Paris and Doyle together, and they break apart Rory and Logan?!! HORRIBLE.  I mean they didn't have to end up getting married, but they could have ended up still a couple.This ending really affected me not only because I have a romantic streak and wanted a truly happy ending for all, but because it seemed to me that they were not consistent with the story line. Throughout the seasons, the story line was developed on the premise that Rory really loved Logan. By splitting them up, I felt the message here was that a career was more important than true love.  They could have done better.Perhaps in the near future we can have a ""Gilmore Women"" and get to reunite Rory and Logan.In any case, I write all this with a smile on my face for having been witness to a wonderful show, with wonderful actors.  It's a credit to the actor playing Logan that he becomes lovable after being such a jerk; that I could like Emily and Richard, even though they are such snobs, that I loved Christopher with all his shortcomings, Luke with his gruffness, Miss Patty, Babette, Jackson.  Now Sookie, what a wonderful and consistent performance throughout; and last but not least Lorelei, who was truly deserving of at least one Emmy and who truly carried not only the show but who was the perfect match for Rory's performance as well.It's also a credit to the original creators, producers, old writers, and new writers, that even though I disagreed with much of their story lines and character developments, I could still see the quality of the show shining through in 6 of the 7 years (Season 6 is hopeless for me).PLEASE DO ""THE GILMORE WOMEN:  The Gilmore Girls 5 years later"" as a movie or mini series.  Your fans will be eternally grateful.Thank you Gilmore Girls, and goodbye, I will miss you.",5,Goodbye Gilmore Girls,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,5023,"['WARNING', 'FULL', 'SPOILERSI', 'watched',

Coming off a lackluster sixth (which had its strengths, but overall was the worst season of the series), the new producers had a lot of bad Blood to fix, as well as the problem of continueing a show that for the most part was the brainchild of a single woman - who was now completley out of the picture.After stumbling over the first several episodes the season starts to take-off around episode six, and while it never blossoms into the 'Gilmore Girls' of years past, it definately held it own as an entertaining and engaging series.  The main focus for this year was Rory coming to terms with Graduating from College - and what life after college has in store for her.  She spends the year questioning her goals, relationships, and place within the world (just like every other 22 year-old about to strike it on their own for the first time).  Lorelai finds herself in a similar delimma.  After playing Rory's mother for so many years, she starts to have to life a life without her daughter.  She eventually falls for her one time flame Christopher with interesting results.But than anything this is the season of growing up and a season of change.  While this season also includes the series finale, it was not decided as a series finale until 10 days before it aired.  The producers were trying to get another season out of the series, which in my opinion would have been a mistake.  While this series finale is low-key and not exactly a 'blockbuster ending' some series are graced with, it fits the series perfectly.  All loose ends are tied up, all the characters have grown up, they know their place in the world, and everyone is looking forward to a new life ahead of them.  It's sad to see the girls go, but they couldn't have ended on a better note.",4,"This is how it ends.

1054117,A3BDB0FRY2WIOO,B000N6TYLW,William Spears,"[0, 0]","(Possible Spoilers)This last season was a worthy edition to the Gilmore Canon. As I watched the DVD of Season 7, the season felt a lot like ""closure"" to me. Closure and Change/Growth seemed to be the themes for this final season.The writing in season 7 wasn't as witty as in past years, but it had an awful lot of heart to it. Throughout the season, words were spoken between characters that, I think, needed to be said.The last show, in particular, was maybe the best final wrap-up show that I have ever watched.Luke, looking at Lorelai, and saying simply, ""I just like to see you happy.""--is there any more touching and true way of saying ""I love you""?Lorelai, looking at her mother, and realizing that her mother is worried about losing her daughter again--now that Rory is moving on. So Lorelai smiles sweetly at Emily and says softly, ""Why don't we just talk about this on Friday, at dinner?""  Anyone who has watched even a few episodes of Gilmore Girls, can sense that this simple remark by Lorelai carries immense emotional weight. And for those of us who have followed the Gilmore girls through 7 seasons, Lorelai's remark is perfect.But for me, probably the most touching words are those of Richard, Lorelai's father, who says to Lorelai, ""This party is as much for you, Lorelai, as it is for Rory."" Richard expands on these words, and when the camera switches to Lorelai's tearful face, it mirrors what we are feeling.Like most everyone else here on the comments board, I will miss the Gilmore Girls. The dialog, the truly memorable and fascinating characters created, and most especially the acting by all of the stars, particularly Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel--that will all be sorely missed.
