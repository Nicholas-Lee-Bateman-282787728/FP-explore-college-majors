Olivia Williams is excellent too -- she was one of the most redeeming features of &quot;The Postman&quot;, if anyone remembers that movie.  For me, however, Bill Muray steals the show.  Who would have thought, when he was &quot;Todd&quot; on Saturday Night Live in 1977, giving Gilda Radner noogies, that he would turn out to be a real actor with actual range, and actual depth?!?!  Well, the man's doing something right, that's all I can say.  Also -- I don't want to give the ending away, but just be somewhat aware, while watching this, that you could construct a pretty strong argument that Max Fischer is just a total jerk.

Often, the commentators bounce off each other and share reminiscences (as in, say, the CHARADE or FIGHT CLUB commentaries), and it would have been nice to have that here as well.But that's a minor quibble.

464324,A1VQY8XWM19IXB,6305428239,Alan Cerny,"[5, 6]","First off, RUSHMORE the movie is probably my favorite film of 1998.  It's just one of the most truly honest films of the 90s.  It's a simple tale,  excellently told.  Boy falls in love with teacher who falls in love with  friend of boy...one of the oldest stories in the book, right?  But Wes  Anderson and Owen Wilson have created something more.  And in Max Fischer,  they have created a character that will be held along the lines of classic  characters like Benjamin Braddock (THE GRADUATE), or even Wes Anderson and  Owen Wilson's Dignan (played by Owen Wilson in BOTTLE ROCKET).What  really needs to be said, though, is that the Criterion DVD of this film  simply is one of the best DVDs ever made.  It's got a terrific commentary,  documentaries, interviews, even the MTV Movie Awards reenactments by the  Max Fischer Players.  Other than FIGHT CLUB and Criterion's BRAZIL, I can't  think of a single DVD that holds a candle to it.  It's well worth the extra  price.RUSHMORE is destined to be a classic..one of those movies that  still will be appreciated 20 years later.

But it is in no way, shape, or form a genre comedy, and in fact is more heartfelt and moving than the vast mojority of dramas.Many people have commented on the brilliant performance given by Bill Murray, but Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams also give nearly flawless efforts. I've heard people complain that Schwartzman is annoying and unlikeable - and certainly he is eccentric - but I'd argue that Max Fisher is a timeless example of the dynamic protaganist; he begins his year at Rushmore as an obsessed, pretentious, sexually-frustrated teen (girls aren't his *forte*), and ends up with a very different perspective on life, learning, and love. Williams couldn't be better in her ability to combine a strong intellect with vulnerability.But, of course, Murray steals the show in the long run. He is a wonderful anti-hero who ultimately just wants to be a simple, happy man, but is confronted constantly with vice and disillusionment. He is a weakling -- there is no doubt about this, but his wealth and status make his weakness complicated and endearing.The music in this movie, and all of Anderson's movies, is as crucial an element as any other. Try imagining Max walking out of the hotel room, having just assaulted Bill Murray with a swarm of bees, with John Williams music playing in the background. Or Max dancing with Olivia Williams with Glenn Miller as the music. It woulndn't work.

464329,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305428239,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 14]","I am a huge fan of `The Royal Tenenbaums', but I couldn't rally behind `Rushmore' the way I thought I would.  The acting was superb across the board, and the humor, when it hit, was hilarious; but there was just something about this movie that didn't sit well with me.  I found myself wondering where this movie was going; what point it was trying to make.  There are many scenes where it feels like this movie doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be.  Is it a comedy, is it a drama, is it an intellectual farce, is it a tearjerker; is it neither?  I found the contemplation of the films intent to be tiresome and draining and thus I found my feelings for the film in general to be rather indifferent.I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't.The film tells the story of Max Fisher (an outstanding Jason Schwartzman), a young fifteen-year-old who is just making it at Rushmore.  He is failing everything yet his indulgence in extracurricular activities keeps him active in the school.  He's fallen for the young widowed teacher Rosemary Cross and become friends with Rushmore alumnus and industrial tycoon Herman Blume.  When those two friendships cross paths though, Max's world comes crashing down on him.`Rushmore' is heralded by many as a near masterpiece and is placed alongside classics like `The Graduate' as one of the best coming-of-age stories out there, but I sorely disagree.  What `The Graduate' has that `Rushmore' lacks is a common strain of thought.  Instead of focusing its attention on a primary subject, `Rushmore' seems to barely find its footing, skirting along various focal points, never really settling down to uncover the meat of the film.  I found some of the performances to feel disjointed from the film because they seemed to be from a completely different genre.  Case-in-point; Schwartzman is purely comic while Olivia Williams is pure drama.  There is a scene where Max confronts Rosemary about his feelings, and her response seemed so unnatural when taken in the context of the film; it just didn't flow.Bill Murray is the only actor who actually `gets' it.  His delivery is comic, yet in that subtly dramatic way (as he was in `Lost in Translation') and it seems to elevate each scene he is in.  He plays Herman with the perfect mixture of misery and humor.  His performance is so good that I'm appalled he was denied an Oscar nomination, despite his winning several critics awards.  This isn't to say that Schwartzman and Williams aren't wonderful (Schwartzman is really at the top of his game, and the character fits him like a glove; and Williams is very moving in her scenes and understandably endearing) I just feel that they contradict one another in their approach to the material.I can see why some adore this film, for it has its moments of quirky delightfulness, but in the end I feel that it misses what it was striving for and winds up being less than one would expect.  If it had some better direction maybe, or any direction, the film would have realized its potential and made good use of its stars.  I'll admit that the final Vietnam War themed school play was a hoot, but for the most part I found myself to bewildered to enjoy the humor.",2,"Sadly, this film lacks a keen sense of direction...",1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3196,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'could', ""n't"", 'rally', 'Rushmore', 'way', 'thought', 'would', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'board', 'humor', 'when', 'hit', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'found', 'wondering', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'intellectual', 'farce', 'tearjerker', 'neither', 'found', 'contemplation', 'films', 'intent', 'be', 'tiresome', 'draining', 'thus', 'found', 'feelings', 'film', 'general', 'be', 'rather', 'indifferent.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', ""didn't.The"", 'film', 'story', 'Max', 'Fisher', 'outstanding', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'young', 'fifteen-year-old', 'who', 'just', 'making', 'Rushmore', 'failing', 'everything', 'yet', 'indulgence', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'active', 'school', 'fallen', 'young', 'widowed', 'teacher', 'Rosemary', 'Cross', 'become', 'friends', 'Rushmore', 'alumnus', 'industrial', 'tycoon', 'Herman', 'Blume', 'When', 'two', 'friendships', 'cross', 'paths', 'Max', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'him.', 'Rushmore', 'heralded', 'many', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'placed', 'classics', 'Graduate', 'one', 'best', 'coming-of-age', 'stories', 'there', 'sorely', 'disagree', 'What', 'Graduate', 'Rushmore', 'lacks', 'common', 'strain', 'thought', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'attention', 'primary', 'subject', 'Rushmore', 'barely', 'find', 'footing', 'skirting', 'along', 'various', 'focal', 'points', 'never', 'really', 'settling', 'down', 'uncover', 'meat', 'film', 'found', 'performances', 'feel', 'disjointed', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'genre', 'Case-in-point', 'Schwartzman', 'purely', 'comic', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'pure', 'drama', 'scene', 'where', 'Max', 'Rosemary', 'feelings', 'response', 'seemed', 'so', 'unnatural', 'when', 'taken', 'context', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow.Bill', 'Murray', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'actually', 'delivery', 'comic', 'yet', 'subtly', 'dramatic', 'way', 'was', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'elevate', 'scene', 'Herman', 'perfect', 'mixture', 'misery', 'humor', 'performance', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'appalled', 'was', 'denied', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'winning', 'several', 'critics', 'awards', ""n't"", 'say', 'Schwartzman', 'Williams', 'are', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'Schwartzman', 'really', 'top', 'game', 'character', 'glove', 'Williams', 'very', 'moving', 'scenes', 'understandably', 'endearing', 'just', 'feel', 'contradict', 'one', 'approach', 'material.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'adore', 'film', 'moments', 'quirky', 'delightfulness', 'end', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'striving', 'up', 'being', 'less', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'had', 'better', 'direction', 'maybe', 'direction', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'potential', 'made', 'good', 'use', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'final', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'themed', 'school', 'play', 'was', 'hoot', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'bewildered', 'enjoy', 'humor']",Rushmore

And believe me it is a amazingly beautiful world. ""Rushmore"" is one of the most famous works of his, and it has became a cult flick world wide.It is a story of a `nerd' called Max (Jason Schartzman), whose life is devoted to his well concepted school, Rushmore. Everything is his life has to do somehow with his school. Accidentally he comes across both Mr Blume and Miss Cross -- two people who will change his life forever. They introduce Max to love, friendship and some other things of the real world -- a place to which Max is not very used.""Rushmore"" --the movie -- is melancholic, funny and deeply lyrical. It seems to me that the film is a metaphor of the Rites of Passage -- the ritual that transforms the teenager into an adult. Rushmore -- the school -- is a metaphor of the world, where in this little place, Max can experience all those things that he will face through his life, such as love, friendship, betrayal, rejection and some others that we all have to face sooner or later.The two who change Max's life are played by Olivia Willians and Bill Murray. She is a widowed teacher for whom he falls, despite she being a bit older than him, and this platonic love affair is the first contact that Max has with the mysterious world of women. This relationship must have to do with the Oedipus Complex somehow, once Max's mother died when he was only 7. I think that Mr Blume represents what Max wants to be when is older -- i.e. wealthy and important. But these two poles will give Max their back, and this is when he seems his dreams falling into pieces.But it is not a sad film, although it is very melancholic. The soundtrack has an important role in this story. It is perfect and every song played there does extremely fine with the character's mood and with the sequences.

464334,AG0TA24LI0XV7,6305428239,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[2, 2]","Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson wrote and created a film that is profoundly rich in its portrayal of multifaceted characters, three lonely and wounded people. I have seen many coming of age films, from comedies to dramas, from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". ""Rushmore"" is one of my favorites, a total standout with its own unique flavor and style. It is at times dark, quirky, funny, joyful, heartbreaking, and triumphant.I can't imagine this film without Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. They are both so good here. You can't help liking them, loathing them, pitying them, laughing at them, cheering for them, and hoping for them to find some thread of happiness. They start out friends, then enemies, then friends again but stronger. This film really is about friendships.Max Fischer is easily one of the most fascinating and interesting characters I have encountered in the movies. He is a creative dynamo and yet he is flawed and vulnerable. Max is (pardon all the adjectives) witty, cruel, clever, resilient, funny, dangerous, foolish, brilliant, lonely, formidable, and damaged. This is not a character you've seen before in a film.I was particularly impressed with one friendship in ""Rushmore"", which was that of Dirk and Max. I felt their history together; you just know they've been buddies for a long time, and have had many schemes and fun times... and when there was a big rift between them, I actually was hoping that their bond would not be broken permanently.When it comes down to it, this is (for me) a love story about a young man and the time of his life. Rushmore is more than a school to Max, it is a time. I remember that time in my life, and I think that the fact that it has to end or change is rather sad and unfair (but inevitable). It's a heady time with so many things going on: changes, self image issues, first loves, learning, socializing, making mistakes, friendship, creating, failing, fighting, and slowly beginning to discover your place in life. ""Rushmore"" captures a genuine taste of this time.I really wish ""Rushmore"" had become a TV series, an hourly 'dramedy'. It has a perfect setting and characters for that. The film left me wanting to see more stories involving Max and his world.",5,"Coming of Age, and All of its Pain and Glory",1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,2249,"['Owen', 'Wilson', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'wrote', 'created', 'film', 'profoundly', 'rich', 'portrayal', 'multifaceted', 'characters', 'three', 'lonely', 'wounded', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'coming', 'age', 'films', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Rushmore', 'one', 'favorites', 'total', 'standout', 'own', 'unique', 'flavor', 'style', 'times', 'dark', 'quirky', 'funny', 'joyful', 'heartbreaking', 'triumphant.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'film', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'loathing', 'pitying', 'laughing', 'cheering', 'hoping', 'find', 'thread', 'happiness', 'start', 'out', 'friends', 'then', 'enemies', 'then', 'again', 'stronger', 'film', 'really', 'friendships.Max', 'Fischer', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'interesting', 'characters', 'have', 'encountered', 'movies', 'creative', 'dynamo', 'yet', 'flawed', 'vulnerable', 'Max', 'adjectives', 'witty', 'cruel', 'clever', 'resilient', 'funny', 'dangerous', 'foolish', 'brilliant', 'lonely', 'formidable', 'damaged', 'not', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'one', 'friendship', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'Dirk', 'Max', 'felt', 'history', 'together', 'just', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buddies', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'schemes', 'fun', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'rift', 'actually', 'was', 'hoping', 'bond', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'time', 'life', 'Rushmore', 'more', 'school', 'Max', 'time', 'remember', 'time', 'life', 'think', 'fact', 'end', 'change', 'rather', 'sad', 'unfair', 'inevitable', 'heady', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'changes', 'image', 'issues', 'first', 'loves', 'learning', 'socializing', 'making', 'mistakes', 'friendship', 'creating', 'failing', 'fighting', 'slowly', 'beginning', 'discover', 'place', 'life', 'Rushmore', 'genuine', 'taste', 'time.I', 'really', 'wish', 'Rushmore', 'had', 'become', 'TV', 'series', 'hourly', ""'dramedy"", 'perfect', 'setting', 'characters', 'film', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'stories', 'involving', 'Max', 'world']",Rushmore

At times outlandish and at other points heartfelt, it's one of the best trips I ever took to the cinema. This Criterion DVD is so good, though, because the special features, including other plays from the Max Fischer Players, added to my enjoyment of the film.Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman, is the worst student at Rushmore Academy, though not because he doesn't apply himself. He is in every available club at the school, commandeers many of the extra-curricular activities, petitions to save the Latin program at the school and knows all of his teachers. But he's also failing his actual classes, has no ambitions beyond being the lord and master of Rushmore and has so much passion, in fact, that it clouds his reason.Max's passion becomes particularly troublesome when his focus turns to Miss Cross, the widowed first-grade teacher who's just joined the Rushmore staff. Her love for Latin and poetry, in addition to her incredibly refined beauty, drive Max to outrageous lengths in the name of love. He recruits a rich yet soul-defeated man, played by an Oscar-worthy Bill Murray, to fund his ultimate monument to Miss Cross, an aquarium in her late husband's honor. Only Max doesn't get anyone's approval to build the aquarium first, which leads to major disaster for him and all else involved.Max uses his heart, then his head. That's his greatest aspect and his ultimate failing. That's what makes him a compelling, funny character, one with which members of the audience can quickly identify.The screenplay, by Anderson and actor Owen Wilson, is smart and funny. Visually, the film is quirky and beautiful, in its way. The acting is stellar, even from Schwartzman in his first film.Check out the DVD's use of drawings, as well as its audition tape reel.

Then they both fall in love with Olivia Williams, a first grade teacher at Rushmore.  Max's love is really a crush, but then he and Bill Murray do battle for the affections of Williams.Olivia Williams is a beautiful actress who plays her part perfectly.  I enjoyed every scene she was in.Max goes off the deep end, getting expelled from Rushmore.  Somewhere along the line, Max turns it around and becomes friends again with Murray and Williams.  He produces a play that results in a tidy, happy ending.The movie had some problems.  It jumped from scene to scene without quality transitions.

I can  report, though, that &quot;Rushmore&quot; pleasantly surprised  me.Newcomer Jason Schwartzman stars as Max Fischer, an oddly mature  15-year-old who goes to Rushmore Academy, which is &quot;one of the best  schools in the country.&quot;  Max (who always sports a blue blazer and  tie) is extremely active in many - if not most - of the school's clubs.  He's a little too active, however, and is facing expulsion because of  &quot;too many extracurricular activities.&quot;  Max is into everything it  seems, so much so that a wealthy steel tycoon, Mr. Bloom (Bill Murray in  yet another terrific supporting role) comments to the headmaster Dr.  Guggenheim that Max seems &quot;to have it pretty figured out.&quot;That is until he falls for a pretty teacher.  When their friendship  starts to become more in his mind, she quickly cuts him off.  And then the  movie takes an unusual turn.  Max's friend Mr. Bloom falls for her too.  The romantic triangle that follows is strange until you realize that Max  and Mr. Bloom aren't so different as you might imagine.Two films came  to my mind as I watched &quot;Rushmore&quot;.  The movie reminded me of  &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (two terrific  films by the way).  I think you'll be able to see the similarity to  &quot;The Graduate&quot; right away, but if you doubt me on the other one,  remember this - both &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; and &quot;Rushmore&quot;  feature Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack.  I don't think  &quot;Rushmore&quot; is as good as those other movies, however, but the  fact that it earns comparison says a lot.",3,A rather pleasant surprise,962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,1900,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expected', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'quot', 'seemed', 'recall', 'buzz', 'regarding', 'movie', 'won', 'couple', 'prizes', 'last', 'year', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Awards', 'can', 'report', 'though', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'me.Newcomer', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'oddly', 'mature', '15-year-old', 'who', 'Rushmore', 'Academy', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'schools', 'country.', 'quot', 'Max', 'who', 'always', 'sports', 'blue', 'blazer', 'tie', 'extremely', 'active', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'school', 'clubs', 'little', 'too', 'active', 'however', 'facing', 'expulsion', 'quot', 'too', 'many', 'extracurricular', 'activities.', 'quot', 'Max', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'wealthy', 'steel', 'tycoon', 'Mr.', 'Bloom', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'yet', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'role', 'comments', 'headmaster', 'Dr.', 'Guggenheim', 'Max', 'quot', 'have', 'pretty', 'figured', 'out.', 'quot', 'pretty', 'teacher', 'When', 'friendship', 'become', 'more', 'mind', 'quickly', 'cuts', 'off', 'then', 'movie', 'unusual', 'turn', 'Max', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Bloom', 'too', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'strange', 'realize', 'Max', 'Mr.', 'Bloom', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'different', 'might', 'imagine.Two', 'films', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'movie', 'reminded', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'quot', 'two', 'terrific', 'films', 'way', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'similarity', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'right', 'away', 'doubt', 'other', 'one', 'remember', 'quot', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'feature', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies', 'however', 'fact', 'comparison', 'lot']",Rushmore

464355,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,6305428239,C. Sawin,"[5, 5]","Rushmore is a fantastic film for many reasons. As someone who lives in Houston, it's still amazing to think that a big portion of Rushmore was shot here. This little independent gem was more than likely your introduction to both director and Houston native Wes Anderson and actor Jason Schwartzman and what an introduction it would turn out to be. Anderson would go on to continue giving us quirky yet extremely heartwarming films while Schwartzman evolved into a very talented actor and worked with Anderson on several other occasions. Once you hear Bill Murray say, ""Yeah, I was in the @#$%,"" you know you're in for something special. Rushmore is just what every comedy, independent or otherwise, should be.The love triangle between Max Fischer (Schwartzman), Herman Blume (Murray), and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) is one of the things that makes Rushmore so good. Each character brings out the best in the others while their flaws only seem to strengthen the performances of those around them. Max is devoted to so many activities and clubs around Rushmore Academy that he finds himself on the verge of expulsion from failing grades, Ms. Cross is still grieving her husband who only passed a year ago, and Mr. Blume is one of the richest guys around, finds himself in a failing marriage, doesn't know how to act around people, and has a drinking problem. The rivalry that develops between Max and Herman is just extraordinary. Nearly any scene featuring Bill Murray is incredible anyway, especially the hospital scene where he shows up with flowers and rides with Max in the elevator. The restaurant scene where Max is drinking and confesses his love to Ms. Cross is really exceptional, as well. Mostly because all three of the of the main cast have the chance to shine.There's this sense of quirkiness to a Wes Anderson film that you can't find anywhere else and that's its charm. Anderson also has a knack for picking some pretty memorable soundtracks and knows how to make a scene look better than it should, but his writing is what stands out the most. Flawed people and unusual dialogue and situations; that's a Wes Anderson film at its core. Maybe that's why his movies are so easy to relate to since nobody is perfect and everyone finds themselves slipping up from time to time.There's just something about Rushmore that speaks to you whether you relate to one of the characters, love Bill Murray, or have a thing for independent film. It's awkward and touching when things get heavy and hilarious and lighthearted when things are more laid back. It's well-written, you actually care about these eccentric characters, and the performances are top notch all around. Rushmore is one of those films you just have to see; you HAVE to. It's the type of film that latches onto you and never lets go while you're more than willing to let it stay as long as it's willing to stick around.Rushmore isn't loaded with special features, but there is some really great stuff in what is included. The Making of featurette and MTV Movie Awards Shorts are the must see features. The Making of ""Rushmore"" is the lengthiest (around seventeen minutes) and is mostly just a brief behind the scenes documentary shot by Eric Chase Anderson, Wes Anderson's brother that includes interviews and a rundown of the cast. The EPK (Electronic Press Kit) was shot for something like five months, when most films shoot them in a matter of days. When you consider that bit of information, it's kind of surprising that the footage they shot wasn't used to make a full-length documentary. The MTV Movie Awards Shorts are brief (three segments, each about a minute long, and a thirty second introduction), but are just fantastic. The shorts are theatrical adaptations of films from 1999 including The Truman Show, Armageddon, and Out of Sight. If you liked Max's plays in the film, you'll enjoy these.Other special features include cast auditions, a film to storyboard comparison, storyboards, an episode of The Charlie Rose Show Featuring Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, the theatrical trailer, an image gallery, and audio commentary by Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and actor Jason Schwartzman (which was recorded in 1999). There's this pretty incredible collectible poster included inside the case and an essay by film critic Dave Kehr included in the liner notes, as well.Criterion Collection, as you've come to expect by now, has made Rushmore look and sound better than it ever has before. The Blu-ray is a digital transfer of the director's cut, which was supervised by director Wes Anderson with a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The film is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 5.1 surround sound and is approximately 93 minutes long. The Rushmore Criterion Collection Blu-ray will be released in stores and in most online retail outlets on Tuesday, November 22nd.",4,Tell that stupid mick he just made my list of things to do

One reviewer wrote that they didn't think it was supposed to be a comedy. Of course it was meant to be a comedy and for many people as well as too many clueless critics it was successful. I may give this film one more chance on a stormy day when I have absolutely nothing better to do and somebody ties me up and holds a gun to my head.

Also, people, as far as I know, Mr. Schwartzmann hasn't been in a film since. That should say something(and no, I don't think it's that he's just very selective). I have to say though they did put alot of care into this transfer to dvd. Alot of extra features for you fans. Much better films don't get this treatment.

Whereas most prep school coming of age stories attempt a kind of been-there realism, what Anderson achieves here is something close to a kid's fantasy framed in realism.Jason Schwartzman stars as 15-year-old Max Fischer whose claim to fame is flunking most of his classes at Rushmore prep while being a boy genius who leads a dozen extra curricular activities including writing and directing his own plays.  He's a kind of dark browed Woody Allen in the making.  Bill Murray, slightly subdued and under comedic control, gives support as Herman Blume the millionaire entrepreneur who is impressed with Fischer's accomplishments and style.  Olivia Williams is the grade school teacher they both adore.Well, if you are a slightly nerdish boy (or were one) this movie is going to just pop your tart.  So wish-fulfilling is the story that at any moment I expected Max Fischer to hop into a phone booth and come out in leotards and cape.  Even the plays Max writes embody a boy's dream of being a man: Serpico as played by teens, Platoon (or Apocalypse Now) in the high school gym.  But I have to say anybody who watches this movie and doesn't feel a bit of nostalgia for childhood needs to have his bedpan changed.Max is a slacker who doesn't slack.  Max is to be preferred to Blume's own idiot kids.  Max can lead the boys at public or private schools.  It doesn't matter.  Max can almost win the girl, even though she is a dozen or so years older and six inches taller.  Max can take a punch.  Max has inexhaustible energy.  Max is a leader and liked and respected by all but the school bully (whom he wins over and puts to work).  Max probably will get into his safety school, Harvard, by scoring a perfect 2400 on his SATs.  Humm, maybe that's a good idea for a sequel--oh, too late for a sequel, and anyway The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) certainly is better than any sequel.Well, how about Max grows up and becomes an astronaut, the first man on Mars?  Or better yet, Max grows up and becomes--Wes Anderson!I have one MAJOR problem with this movie.  What is with all the cigarettes?  Wes, did you get some backing from Phillip Morris?  I am so tired of cigarettes in movies where they serve no plot or character purpose, where they are planted merely to entice young people into a lifetime of addiction.

The Criterion version was recently released so I bought it and gave my other DVD to a friend. I love the Criterion films.  Although I am not in the movie making business, I am interested in the  composition of a good film, and have become a fan of Criterion.  I own a  number of laser disk and DVD Criterion films.Rushmore is a wonderful  film. The leading young man is Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire of Rocky fame  is his mother, Francis Ford Coppola is his grandfather, and Nicholas Cage  is his cousin). Bill Murray is almost always in weird comedies and this is  a weird comedy. Bill has never been so droll, however. Olivia Williams  played Jane Fairfax in &quot;Emma&quot; and was Bruce Willis' wife in  &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; I am mentioning all these connections because  the film is sometimes thought of as an &quot;Indy&quot; and although it may  be (I think if might have won something at Sundance), very talented people  were involved in the production--at least of Jason.The setting is  Rushmore, a private school where young Max Fischer is a failing and  troubled student. Ms. Williams is a beautiful young teacher who trys to  counsel Max, and with whom he is smitten.  In spite of her efforts, Max is  eventually expelled from Rushmore.  He continues to pursue Ms. Williams  romantically, however she tries to discourage him.  Eventually, he  crosses  paths with Bill Murray, an excentric millionaire who also is smitten with  and courting Ms. Williams.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 5]","Wes Anderson followed up the wonderful ""Bottle Rocket"" with ""Rushmore,"" a coming-of-age romantic-comedy-drama that actually seems halfway plausible. Wittily-written, well-acted, and solidly-directed with plenty of amusing quirks.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) attends the elite Rushmore Academy, and is perhaps the most unusual student there -- he's part of every club and team in Rushmore, but failing all his classes. He encounters an odd friend of sorts in the unhappy magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is impressed by Max. At the same time, he befriends the smart, pleasant teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams).But Max's world is turned upside-down. When he tries to build a magnificent aquarium in honor of Miss Cross, he's expelled from Rushmore. Worse yet, he learns that she's having an affair with Blume, who's every bit as attracted to her as Max is. Will Max, having lost what defined his life (namely, Rushmore), be able to bounce back?""Rushmore"" is one of those movies that Wes Anderson does really well -- it doesn't fit neatly into any one category, it's smart, it's funny, and the characters are endearing in a weird, quirky sort of way (especially when engaging in a sort of revenge one-upping, for the love of the teacher). It somehow manages to be sweet and pleasant without being schmaltzy or boring.The writing is humorous, but not the sort of snort-hee-hee comedy that most movies have. (The limpest humor in here is the ""O.R. scrubs"" joke, and then it's clearly meant to be lame). Max's particular brand of dynamic brilliance is outlined best in the Vietnam-based school play, a mediocre idea raised to amazing levels. And unlike most movies of any kind, it leaves you thinking. Are the places we WANT to be the best places for us to be? Or would we really be happier elsewhere? Are the people we adore the people we should be with?Max is an unusual character -- smart and mature, but somehow not quite as mature as he thinks he is. He always aspires to climb higher and higher, and clearly sees no end to how far he can go, and Schwartzman does an excellent job without being obvious about it. Bill Murray does a fantastic job as the depressed magnate who doesn't like his life as it is. Williams does a less amazing job, but is good as the center that the other two revolve frantically around.""Rushmore"" is a different but fully worthy follow-up to ""Bottle Rocket,"" and it definitely won't disappoint Wes Anderson fans.

Add  to this the relationship he creates with one female tutor (the lovely  Olivia Williams), and then a friendship with a male tutor (Bill Murray who  just gets better and better as his career goes on), and you have a special  movie. The fact that Max is 15 creates a barrier between him and the new  (recently bereaved) love of his life. Mr. Murray, in falling for her too,  creates another.

Never does the film feel condescending like a lot of ""hip"" films during this time had a tendency to do.  It doesn't feel smarmy or sleazy.  In the hands of a ""hip"" director, they could have needled Max's character, mocking him and making fun of him.  Anderson didn't.  Wes (and co-writer Owen Wilson, who should write more) made all their characters like real people.  And the film has one of the greatest soundtracks EVER.  It is filled with British invasion hits, and the use of The Who's A Quick One While He's Away is truly inspired.

But first, the movie itself is a  real treat. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), 10th grade student of Rushmore  academy, is involved in playwriting and numerous extra-cirricular  activities. The only problem is he faces expulsion due to his lack luster  grades. Towards the beginning of the film he comes to admire Mr. Blume, a  self made millionaire in a bad marriage played wonderfully by Bill Murray.  The two of them become good friends, each displaying a mutual respect for  one another, until they both fall for the same woman, a widowed first grade  teacher played by Olivia Williams. If anything, this movie shows the  hardships of growing up as a teenager and coming to terms with feelings so  overwhelming (in this case unrequited love) that you can't deal with them.  Funny, poignant, and intelligent, it's an excellent coming of age story  highlighted by the incredible performances of all the players.

He does not get sent to a work camp for juvenile offenders (though he spends a  short time in jail). He lives with a loving father. And where Antoine is  helpless in a world run by hapless adults, Max is a precocious youth who  has firmly established himself in, at least some aspects, the adult world.On the other hand there are several very salient affinities between the  two.  They are both brilliantly intelligent and creative.  They are both  misunderstood and at odds with &quot;the establishment&quot;.  They are  both vital and active children who search for something to live for.  And  they both look to the adult world to answer their innermost yearnings, and  come back disappointed and rejected.Rushmore, like The 400 Blows, has  a magic quality to it.  Whether it is the catchy soundtrack; the  rebelliouly charming, somewhat anachronistic 60's quality of Max; the  quaint, quiet, enlightened, and tolerant town of Rushmore; or the wonderful  supporting characters like Mr. Littlejeans, Dirk, Margaret Yang, and Max's  haircutting father--the film conveys a real sense of the subtle,  understated beauty hidden amid all of the irritation, brilliance, and  activity that exudes from the film.In short,this is an indispensably  good film.

464383,A192KEPM0HW6AC,6305428239,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[4, 7]","Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of schmoozer par-excellence Max Fischer is one of the great performances in recent comedy.  You cannot separate the two, Schwartzman is so wedded to his character.  Yet, his depiction does not reek of ""method"" disingenuousness.Max Fischer is a precocious and ingratiating young man who is already a ""professional student"" by aged 15 at the tony Rushmore Academy.  He's sort of a male Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon's defining role in Alexander Payne's ""Election""), a consummate extracurricular overachiever and president of every club in the yearbook.  Unfortunately -- unlike Tracy -- this leaves Max with little time for his studies, in which he is failing miserably.  Having sailed through school since second grade (when he was awarded a full scholarship to Rushmore for writing an original stage play based on Watergate, which one can infer was a ripoff of ""All the President's Men"" based on Max's later featured stage production, ""Serpico: An Original Play by Max Fischer""), Max now sees that his days are numbered.This nevertheless does not impel Max to putting his nose to the grindstone; Rather, he finds more intricate ways of manipulating the school's dean and using his wiles to establish his status as an unexpendable big man on campus.  However, unlike the Ferris Bueller he imagines himself to be, Max is more an adolescent Walter Mitty, kind of a loner and dreamer.As far as he is capable of a crisis of conscience, two interlopers in Max's life suddenly change his routine at Rushmore.  Self-made industrialist and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (played by the irrascible Bill Murray) picques Max's interest one day with a wonderfully off-the-wall ""get the rich boys in your crosshairs"" speech before the spoiled children of privilege who people Max's school, reaching only Max, a barber's son (whom Max has promoted to neurosurgeon in his conversations with others).  When Max gushes to Blume about his enthusiasm for his speech, Blume sees an opportunity to mentor Max.  Meanwhile, Max has developed a crush on a first grade teacher at Rushmore, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), which provides a few hilarious scenes as Max uses his full reserve of charm to woo the reluctant educator, who is mildly amused by Max's overconfident advances.  It is at this point that ""Rushmore"" could devolve into a sappy ABC After School Movie like ""Murder In Mew Hampshire,"" but director Wes Anderson instead handles the scenes farcically, in showing up Max more as Don Quixote than Don Juan.In exchange for showing Max the ropes in the real world, Blume acts as Cyrano de Bergerac to Miss Cross, keeping tabs on her for Max, in hopes of arranging dalliances for Max and Miss Cross.  Of course, like the real Cyrano, Blume falls in love (or rather, lust) with Max's Roxanne, and it is at this point that the movie really takes off.For unbeknownst to Blume, it is Max -- and not he -- who is the mentor, and Blume who will soon be schooled, as he finds himself in an battle of wits with the prodigious saboteur.  I won't give away the actual battle plan, but the scenes are both endearing and ingenious.  Bill Murray really shines as Herman Blume, and is his best recent performance since sleazy bowler Ernie McCracken in ""Kingpin.""Because of his lax attitude towards his studies, Max finds himself out on his ear at Rushmore anyways, and has to attend public school for the first time in his life.Once ensconsed at Grover Cleveland H.S., Max is back to his old tricks, and uses his overachieving zeal among the apathetic students to hatch a grand scheme to finally win back (not that he ever had) Miss Cross:  An extravagantly staged production of ""Heaven and Hell,"" a script lifted mostly from ""Apocalypse Now"" and Oliver Stone's Vietnam-era movies.  I was rolling on the floor during the staging, particularly when a couple of GIs were carrying a surfboard in front of the beachhead).The movie ends wistfully, with the unrequited love between Max and Miss Cross still unfulfilled.  By this time, Max has reluctantly given into the advances of a fellow student, Margaret Yang (played by the beautiful Sara Tanaka), who is initially rebuffed by Max as Miss Cross had previously turned down Max's romantic overtures.""Rushmore"" is a solid and offbeat movie that is a welcome detour from the hackneyed and formulaic comedies Hollywood is currently proferring.  Its combination of social satire, screwball situations and sadistic slapstick places Wes Anderson in the same patheon with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, Oliver Stone and Francis Ford Copolla, all of whose work has been adapted for the stage by the inimitable Max Fischer.",5,Endearing and Exhilarating,1034467200,"10 13, 2002",2002,4677,"['Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'portrayal',

Thats jsut me however, for most i think this movie would rank at about a 3 1/2 star rating. It is slightly quirky, but most anyone will enjoy it, so give it a rent first. THe picture quality is superb, very clean ,very vivid, no artifacting. But what else would you expect form a criterion. THe audio is hte same. mothersbaugh's origional scores in addition to the oldies all sound great. (btw the soundtrack is fantastic). In the extras department, teh actors screen test are mildly interesting. The commentary provides no mind blowing insight but is interesting and keeps you involved. By far the mtv shorts are the best addition to this disc, they were very cool ,i wuldn't call them hialrious, but they were righteous regardless. If you are casual enjoyer of this movie, then just buy the regular version, there is even a two pack out there with the standard rushmore and mumford..i think its mumford. But if you have more than a passing interest in this film the criterion is well worht the extra 13 bux. Plus it comes with this way cool map of the places where rushmore takes place. It's done in the same artwork as the cover of the dvd. The movie has a lot of heart, the script is very well written and wverything flows at a great and constant pace.

I won't go too much into the plot, you can read about it in other reviews, but I would like to tell you why it is so wonderful. Director Wes Anderson knows how to frame a shot. He knows how to cut the film. And he knows how to complement it with great music. I liked his first film BOTTLE ROCKET ... I love this one. Max Fisher is a cross between Holden Caulfield and ... I don't know. He is like no other character I've ever seen or heard about. He is an elitist yet not of the elite, and an over UNDER-achiever (he has so many extra-curricular activities on his plate he can't succeed at anything). For some reason the movie reminded me of the Graduate ... it had that atmosphere about it. Bill Murray's Mr. Blume is hysterical (without blatantly being so). Their friendship is both sadistic and touching. They are one and the same and that may be why they the have this love/hate relationship with each other as well as with themselves.If you didn't like this film or haven't seen it, take a look (again if you hated it). I am a firm believer in the seeing-it-more-than-once principal. A lot of people think that is stupid ... I believe if it's a good film then it is not stupid. I liked it the first time.

First, this was not a typical predictable Hollywood movie with a predictable ending. Second, it was not a re-hash of some old story line with the same old actors. It is a very well written comedic coming of age movie.  Few movies take the time or effort to develop complex, flawed and genuine characters, but director Wes Anderson apparently understands the value of doing so. The emotionally stagnating business tycoon Herman Blume is played brilliantly by Bill Murray - the disappointment he feels with his banal life and idiotic children is wrenchingly palpable. But Rushmore Academy student and quirky prodigy Max Fischer enters Herman Blume's dull life, renewing his enthusiam. The movie is both thought provoking and hilarious. Particularly enjoyable are Max's adaptations of ""Serpico"" and ""Platoon"" for the high-school drama club.  Hands down this was the best comedy produced in the 90's.

There seemed to be no direction of the story and I was ready to be bored for an hour or two. I was close to even turning it off. In the end, I realized that would have been a huge mistake, because I would have missed out on a great, little film.Max Fischer (Jason Schwarzman) is in love with the school at which he attends: Rushmore Academy. He's the president of chess club, German club, and French club, as well as the founder of the dodgeball society, the Max Fischer players, and tons more. He's also the worst student at the school. As it begins to look gloomy for Max, things begin to brighten up when he falls for a first-grade teacher, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). Unfortunately, Max isn't the only one who has his eye on the teacher. Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) falls for her as well. The two duke it out for Miss Cross' feelings as Max juggles with love, friendships, school, and a play about the Vietnam War.I always thought of director Wes Anderson as a filmmaker you either love or hate. Not to say that I despise him or his films, but I just never really ""got"" them. I fell asleep during ""The Life Aquatic"" and although I liked ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", I wasn't thrilled or engaged by it. ""Rushmore"" works the best for me, mainly because of how focused it is. It's the observation of one character unlike say ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Since this is the case, I have a better time trying to understand what the certain character is doing and why, instead of having to switch back and forth between many characters.Jason Schwartzman is Max Fischer. Determined, caring, awkward, obsessed, and upset, Schwartzman does it all. Bill Murray is great as Max's enemy. The dialogue between the two is well done and never feels forced. Their dream girl is played beautifully by Olivia Williams, who does a remarkable job. The rest of the cast do fine as well.Wes Anderson moves the story along at a fairly slow pace, which actually benefits the story. I particulary enjoyed the off-kilter editing that he employs throughout the film. I found it to be a nice parallel with Max's mindset in every situation that he is in.Overall, ""Rushmore"" is a good film. As I said before, Wes Anderson is a director that you can either take or leave. If you enjoy his films, you'll certainly enjoy this. Even if you're not though, it's still worth checking out. It may move at a slow, deliberate pace, but it's got a great story to tell, filled to the brim with great characters and some solid direction.",3,Rushmore,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2554,"['When', 'began', 'watch', 'Rushmore', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'was', 'headed', 'seemed', 'be', 'direction', 'story', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'bored', 'hour', 'two', 'was', 'close', 'even', 'turning', 'off', 'end', 'realized', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'mistake', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'great', 'little', 'film.Max', 'Fischer', 'Jason', 'Schwarzman', 'love', 'school', 'Rushmore', 'Academy', 'president', 'chess', 'club', 'German', 'club', 'French', 'club', 'as', 'well', 'founder', 'dodgeball', 'society', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'players', 'tons', 'more', 'also', 'worst', 'student', 'school', 'look', 'gloomy', 'Max', 'things', 'begin', 'brighten', 'up', 'when', 'first-grade', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Unfortunately', 'Max', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'eye', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Blume', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'duke', 'out', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'feelings', 'Max', 'love', 'friendships', 'school', 'play', 'Vietnam', 'War.I', 'always', 'thought', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'filmmaker', 'love', 'hate', 'Not', 'say', 'despise', 'films', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'fell', 'asleep', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'liked', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'engaged', 'Rushmore', 'best', 'mainly', 'how', 'focused', 'observation', 'one', 'character', 'say', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'case', 'have', 'better', 'time', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'certain', 'character', 'doing', 'why', 'instead', 'having', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'many', 'characters.Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'Determined', 'caring', 'awkward', 'obsessed', 'upset', 'Schwartzman', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'great', 'Max', 'enemy', 'dialogue', 'two', 'well', 'done', 'never', 'feels', 'forced', 'dream', 'girl', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'who', 'remarkable', 'job', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'fine', 'well.Wes', 'Anderson', 'story', 'along', 'fairly', 'slow', 'pace', 'actually', 'benefits', 'story', 'particulary', 'enjoyed', 'off-kilter', 'editing', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'nice', 'parallel', 'Max', 'mindset', 'situation', 'in.Overall', 'Rushmore', 'good', 'film', 'said', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'director', 'can', 'either', 'take', 'leave', 'enjoy', 'films', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'may', 'move', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'got', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'filled', 'brim', 'great', 'characters', 'solid', 'direction']",Rushmore

I had read great things about it when it was in the theater and never got around to seeing it.  Then I planned on renting it on DVD and checking it  out.  Finally, a couple nights ago, I did.  And I found that this is one of  the best, consistent movies I had seen in a long time.Jason Schwartzman  absolutely nails the part of Max Fisher.  Bill Murray is funny and breathes  life into his dying--yet living--character.  Olivia Williams gives Ms.  Cross the perfect pitch.  The rest of the cast is damn near perfect.  This  is truly the perfect cast for the movie.And as for the actual movie, it  is quite funny.  It carries a very sardonic, deadpan tone that works  perfectly with these characters.  Every moment seems true for this world  and never does the writing fall weak or ring falsely.

It is quirky, unpredictable and true to real life but with a huge humors twist.  Max Fisher the main character is a very active high school student, member of many clubs and bad graded student.  He Reminds me of many people I knew in high school, which made it even more funny.  In my opinion this was Bill Murry's best performance since Groundhog's Day.

I really love Seymour Cassell's role as Max's (Schwartzman)father and it's always a treat to see him on screen.  Out of the four Wes Anderson films this one I feel is the funniest and by far the darkest of the lot.

I don't believe that Bill Murray was even nominated for an Academy Award for this film and that is an absolute crime.

There's not much popular culture references as there are what might be called unpopular culture references to charlie brown and mod britain (look at max's clothing), and i think it kind of adds a more timeless quality to it. this does take place in 1998, but it could have been anytime really. the humor isn't ""intellectual"", it's just humor with max trying too hard to sound like an intellectual (which is a joke). it's not the funniest movie you'll ever see, but it definately has it's moments (favourites include any of the plays and the dinner scene) and i like it because the jokes are hit-or-miss, but at least it's amitious and when it hits, it hits hard. i HIGHLY recommend that you invest in the criterion version. i'm not going to bs you, it's expensive, but ""rushmore"" was made to be loved and if you're one who gets into it, the origional release probably won't be enough. i payed half the price, but i wasn't satisfied and ended up shelling out the extra cash, and that's alot more money than it needed to be. the extras are pretty great and the picture quality is tweeked to perfection; they just added the extra polish, but it shines even brighter than i remembered it. this is a visual film, so those things do make a difference. as far as criticisms go, i'm probably not the best person to defend this because i'm so in love with it. however, i will say that i don;t think the style really takes away from or makes up for the movie, because i kind of think that it's sharp and distinctive just like the characters and the dialogue, so i think that if it is remembered for it's ""style"" than the whole thing is remembered just as well. if there's anything that ""rushmore"" can be disliked for, it's not flaws. you can criticise what you don't like, but wes anderson got exactly what he wanted out of this movie and it's obvious that he didn't just let errors slide. this is his vision, definately a ""love it or hate it"" one, and this is what it was supposed to be. when 1998 is being recalled, ""rushmore"" isn't the box-office hit, but it's one that will be remembered and acclaimed for years to come.",5,sic transit gloria,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,3377,"['i', 'think', 'rushmore', 'alot', 'common', 'protagonist', 'smart', 'special', 'be', 'crowd-pleaser', 'completely', 'tune', 'how', '1998', 'thought', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'presented', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'rushmore', 'defined', 'subtleties', 'so', 'bold', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'very', 'quiet', 'story', 'loud', 'representation', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'everything', 'max', 'eyes', 'where', 'world', 'dramatic', 'almost', 'animated', 'always', 'max', 'people', 'almost', 'centered', 'frame', 'really', 'drama', 'disguised', 'comedy', 'okay', 'humor', 'nice', 'welcoming', 'beginning', 'then', 'plot', 'kind', 'point', ""'re"", 'too', 'involved', 'notice', 'funny', 'stylish', 'stay', 'what', 'core', 'what', 'core', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'story', 'then', 'get', 'technical', 'aspect', 'cinematically', 'wit', 'visual', 'appeal', 'pacing', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Graduate', 'wonder', 'why', 'took', '30', 'years', 'similar', 'movie', 'genre', 'could', 'walk', 'footprints', 'shame', 'not', 'much', 'popular', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'unpopular', 'culture', 'references', 'charlie', 'brown', 'mod', 'britain', 'look', 'max', 'clothing', 'i', 'think', 'kind', 'more', 'timeless', 'quality', 'take', 'place', '1998', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anytime', 'really', 'humor', ""n't"", 'intellectual', 'just', 'humor', 'max', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'sound', 'intellectual', 'joke', 'not', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'definately', 'moments', 'favourites', 'include', 'plays', 'dinner', 'scene', 'jokes', 'are', 'hit-or-miss', 'least', 'amitious', 'when', 'hard', 'i', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'invest', 'criterion', 'version', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bs', 'expensive', 'rushmore', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'loved', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', 'origional', 'release', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'i', 'payed', 'price', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'ended', 'up', 'shelling', 'extra', 'cash', 'alot', 'more', 'money', 'needed', 'be', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'tweeked', 'perfection', 'just', 'added', 'extra', 'polish', 'even', 'brighter', 'i', 'remembered', 'visual', 'film', 'things', 'do', 'make', 'difference', 'as', 'far', 'criticisms', 'go', 'i', ""'m"", 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'person', 'defend', 'i', ""'m"", 'so', 'love', 'however', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'i', 'don', 'think', 'style', 'really', 'away', 'up', 'movie', 'i', 'kind', 'think', 'sharp', 'distinctive', 'just', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'i', 'think', 'remembered', 'style', 'whole', 'thing', 'remembered', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'rushmore', 'can', 'be', 'disliked', 'not', 'flaws', 'can', 'criticise', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'anderson', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'out', 'movie', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'let', 'errors', 'slide', 'vision', 'definately', 'love', 'hate', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', '1998', 'being', 'recalled', 'rushmore', ""n't"", 'box-office', 'hit', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'acclaimed', 'years', 'come']",Rushmore

464413,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6305428239,Kenji Fujishima,"[5, 7]","After hearing so much from both sides of the fence about idiosyncratic director Wes Anderson, I feared that I would perhaps develop an active dislike for RUSHMORE, his second feature (and the first of his films that I have seen). I'm all for style, but not when it takes over story and characters, as some have suggested Anderson's style does. As it turns out, though...I kinda like RUSHMORE. In its own offbeat, unsentimental way---and perhaps in spite of its main character, the sometimes monstrously callow 15-year-old Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman)---it has a charm to it that I found engaging, even as I was wincing at some of the things these characters were doing.RUSHMORE is basically a coming-of-age tale, in which Max learns to overcome his narcissism and grow up a little. But it is done in a way that never makes it as cloying and sentimental as other movies of its type. By the end, instead of feeling manipulated, you feel some genuine warmth in your heart at how it all turns out (even if it's not necessarily a clean resolution).Of course, RUSHMORE is a comedy, not a pure drama, and, while I found some of its humor funny (its funniest moments come in the first half of the movie, while Max is still getting an education), overall I didn't find it very memorable as a comedy. In fact, sometimes its supposed wit seems to be a bit like Max---rather in love with itself. And Anderson has a very strange film style: RUSHMORE is perhaps one of the only widescreen (2.35:1) movies I've seen that STILL feel cramped, since a lot of his close-ups are framed with the figure squarely in the middle. That, and those close-ups seem almost oppressively close-up, often with a figure staring straight at the camera (only the old Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu has done something similar with the framing in his movies, and he often used the classic 1.33:1 frame instead of Anderson's wider canvas). When you see the movie, perhaps you'll see what I mean. It's...interesting, to say the least.Still, for all its self-consciousness and its weirdness, RUSHMORE is an enjoyable and refreshing little coming-of-age tale, one that has heart but always remains charmingly offbeat. If nothing else, the performances---particularly Schwartzman's, maybe a little too good at bringing this occasionally bothersome character to life---make the movie work.

464414,A1RFWRJCAIF0DR,6305428239,Kenji Miwa,"[5, 10]","""Rushmore"" serves as an interesting reference for semiotic analysis because its director, Wes Anderson, is a unique auteur.  He understands paradigmatic choices and commands them with a satirical tone characteristic in his films.  When performing this semiotic analysis, it helps to keep in mind the film's target audience as a point of reference.  This film is probably intended for an American audience of almost all ages however I think younger audiences, who have recently been through high school, could relate to the film in particular.  Even further, this movie could be considered only for the growing cult of loyal Wes Anderson fans who follow his distinctive brand of film.  For practical purposes of this essay, we will only examine the introductory scene from the movie paradigmatically and then look at some of its oppositions.Anderson wastes no time establishing the quirky and mildly uplifting mood found throughout the movie.  As the Touchstone Pictures logo moves on screen, we hear the jubilant plucking of a mandolin and are delighted because we expect this to be a lighthearted ""fun"" movie.  Anderson's introduction is dissimilar from most other big budget movies in that it does not begin with a lengthy montage of credits; a strategy intended to set him apart from the Hollywood norm much in the way an oil painter seeks  his/her avant-garde style.Painting of the BlumesThe first shot fades in to a family portrait on an easel to the left of the screen with a red curtain closed in the background.  ""Touchstone Pictures presents"" appears on the right in Anderson's trademark bold Futura font.  It is important to note that like his other paradigmatic choices, Anderson's consistent selection of Futura font found in all his films is deeply personal and may not be fully understood by the audience.  A set of curtains open to reveal the Rushmore plaque on a gate just outside the campus.This shot comprises an array of unusually crafted paradigmatic choices.  Denotatively, the fact that the portrait is painted suggests that the family depicted is part of an elite upper class.  Many families in America have their family portrait hanging in the living room but they are usually photographed because it is a significantly cheaper.  An original painting suggests the high importance and appreciation of art that many upper class families boast.  In the painting, everyone appears to be happy and normal except the father figure, Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is not standing next to his wife; instead he sits in the foreground with the look of pain on his face and a cigarette drooping off the corner of his mouth.  Obviously this man has problems.  The two adolescent twins are wearing the exact same outfit with the exact same haircut.  Therefore, we can assume their interests and personalities are similar as well.  Their clothes are part of a private school uniform; another indication of the family's wealth.  Anderson consistently exploits the ambiguous relationship between the signifier and the signified to draw humor.  Many of his paradigmatic choices seem random and cannot be explained logically.  For example, the drab green sheet in the painting's background is subtly humorous because of its hideous color and presence.  Indeed, it is noticeable but its presence cannot be fully explained.  Even the quality of the painting itself is an odd paradigmatic choice.  The colors are basic and the faces look almost cartoon-like; the entire painting hints the unrefined work of an art student in training.  Why would a wealthy man, who could afford to commission the best artist money can buy, hire someone with sub par skills?  What family would find it acceptable for the father to pose by himself in the foreground with a frown on his face for a family portrait?  These are the kind odd paradigmatic choices Anderson uses to dance on the fence between realistic life and satirical exaggeration.  It is also important to note the choice to include an opening curtain.  Anderson reminds us that we are watching a completely fictitious play on screen; a fantasy world completely separate from our own.  The curtain serves as an intermediary in this transition.Max's DreamA student asks about an extra credit problem on a forgotten chalkboard in the classroom and the teacher explains that it is ""just a joke"" geometry problem even his mentor from MIT cannot solve.  The students whisper about this amongst themselves and the name ""Max Fisher"" surfaces a few times.  Max Fisher is called on, who is busy reading the Wall Street Journal, but causally gets out of his desk to work out the problem.  He fills most of the chalkboard with his mathematical steps written neatly in calligraphy and finally arrives with an answer.  The teacher nods in approval and the whole class cheers for him.  Max then wakes up from his dream.The film's protagonist, Max Fisher, is introduced in a dream sequence taking place in a Geometry class at Rushmore.  Connotatively, I can immediately identify with the algebraic symbols and graphs on the chalkboard from when I took Geometry in high school.  Even the crusty white writing of chalk on a blackboard alone can conjure an array of memories from an academic environment.  The boxed off list of homework assignments on the top right corner of the chalkboard, random colored papers posted on the wall, and black board eraser smudges are hardly noticed in this scene, however they all serve as an effective sign system which provide the realistic detail authenticating Anderson's work.  The teacher dresses conservatively in a beige V-neck sweater vest and a dry, monotone speech pattern to match.  We can stereotype his dull persona as the result of a lifelong dedication to advanced mathematics.  By this time, the audience is aware that Rushmore is an elite private high school but may find it hard to identify with the setting since the majority of people go to public schools.  We expect Rushmore to be filled with the best teachers, a nurturing administration, and endless opportunity.  This is evident when Max gets expelled from Rushmore because of his bad grades and forced into the public school system.  His former club activities such as fencing are no longer embraced by the public school community and he is not allowed to use the public phone without a hall pass.Max's dream sequence elicits the following main oppositions:Student vs. TeacherStudent vs. StudentsPublic vs. Private SchoolThe Intelligent vs. The AverageIn his dream, Max is idealizing that he is the exact opposite of what he is.  The teacher and students respect him for his academic prowess but in reality, he is ""one of the worse student's we've got,"" according to the president of Rushmore in a later scene.  When Herman Blume asks his twin sons if they invited Max to their birthday party and they respond in disgust: ""Max Fisher? Common Dad there's gonna be girls there.  I'd rather die.""  With Max's odd fashion sense, neatly parted hair, thick framed glasses, and braces, he is denotatively the stereotypical nerdy kid in school.  Connotatively, his character traits eventually unfold to reveal his enthusiasm for extra-curricular activities, great organization skills, and finally his compassion for others.  Max's nonconformity with the ""average kids"" in school and his poor academic infamy with the school's administrators allow him to surprise viewers with his ambitious club endeavors such as directing a hit play about the Vietnam War complete with real dynamite pyrotechnics.  The audience is willing to accept this precocious behavior from a student attending a private school which presumably admits only the most gifted applicants.  We recognize that school uniforms are commonly worn at private schools and are intended to maintain a presentable student and encourage equality.  However, many kids do not adhere to conformity by individualizing their uniform; they can take off their jacket, roll their sleeves up, and untuck their shirt if they want to.  Max, on the other hand, breaks this trend by wearing his complete Rushmore school uniform while the other students prefer the relaxed look of the light blue collar shirt.  This stark difference is accentuated further when Max stands to clap for the Herman Blume's chapel speech in the next scene.  Max's dark navy blue blazer is unmistakable amongst the sea of light blue shirts in the congregation; an obvious statement that he is the black sheep.In conclusion, Anderson's unique brand of paradigmatic choices in ""Rushmore"" allows for an interesting semiotic analysis because they are not always produce a relevant meaning.  Although he follows many of the same semiotic strategies to convey meaning as other directors, Anderson plays with the non-existential relationship between the signifier and signified in his paradigmatic choices to provoke confusion and humor.  He is a quiet reminder that film is an art form and not a science of optimizing commercial success.  For the true auteur, there are no rules.",5,Semiotic Analysis of Rushmore,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,9030,"['Rushmore', 'serves', 'interesting', 'reference', 'semiotic', 'analysis', 'director',

That does not necessarily make it among the best or most memorable I've ever seen (it isn't) but it is clearly one of the most original and mold-breaking excursions in comedy.Jason Schwartzman -- Talia Shire's son -- played the lead in this 1998 dramedy as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy in Houston. Max is everything -- head of the fencing team, the beekeepers, most other oddball clubs -- except a very good student. This becomes his downfall and, finally, his salvation.There's not much point in describing what goes on in the movie, its script, or its other actors (including Bill Murray in one of those roles that defined him in middle age before his breakout in ""Lost In Transition"") other than to say this film merges elements of romance, teen hijinks, class warfare and derision into a stew that almost no one will be able to resist.There is something you've never seen in a film before happening in almost every scene. While the ending is perfectly predicatable and acceptable, you'll enjoy yourself a great deal getting from the opening credits to there. It will be 90 minutes of enjoyment the likes of which you won't repeat too soon.

It is Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot and their tortured relationships rather than Rhett loving Scarlett who loves Ashley who loves Melanie.  The true epic love triangle is difficult to carry off; recent case in point, &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;  However, in &quot;Rushmore,&quot; we are once again fortunately enough to scale the heights of love the true love triangle.If we follow the figurational logic of our paradigmatic example, then Bill Murray as Mr. Herman J. Blume is our Arthur, the king of all the limited world he surveys, but disenchanted with both his life and his wife.  As our Lancelot we have Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer, Mr. Extra-Curricular Activities at Rushmore, the prep school where in we lay our scene.  The bond between the two is what comes first, with Blume seeing Max as the son he never had (he cannot abide the twins he does have), and Max seeing Blume as the father of his dreams (Max loves his father, but tells everyone his father is a neurosurgeon rather than a barber).  It is Max who stumbles upon their Guinevere, Olivia Williams as Miss Rosemary Cross, a teacher at Rushmore.  Recently a widow, she is amused and flattered by Max's attention (He saves the Latin classes as a token of his affection), but obviously does not know where to draw the line.  When Blume becomes enamored of her as well, the relationship between the two males becomes, shall we say, strained.Ironically, the more they go after each other, the more Blume and Max prove their true affinity for one another.  Your assumption is that &quot;Rushmore&quot; will end when the dust has settled and we see if anybody is left alive on the battlefield, but writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have higher aspirations.  The three main actors all turn in marvelously understated and subtle performances (yes, even Murray), so even though the action is going over the top, the film does not.  Every absurdity seems well grounded in the created reality of the world we are visiting.  For this Anderson gets additional credit as director.  &quot;Rushmore&quot; is a film that is wickedly funny without being wickedly cynical.  The obvious double bill for this film would be &quot;Election,&quot; which will only serve to underscore the effectiveness of the more subtle performances in &quot;Rushmore.&quot;",5,"An epic love triangle of a man, a woman, and a boy...",1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2381,"['true', 'love', 'triangle', 'bonds', 'affections', 'directions', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'tortured', 'relationships', 'rather', 'Rhett', 'loving', 'Scarlett', 'who', 'Ashley', 'who', 'Melanie', 'true', 'epic', 'love', 'triangle', 'difficult', 'carry', 'off', 'recent', 'case', 'point', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.', 'quot', 'However', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'fortunately', 'enough', 'scale', 'heights', 'true', 'love', 'triangle.If', 'follow', 'figurational', 'logic', 'paradigmatic', 'example', 'then', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Mr.', 'Herman', 'J.', 'Blume', 'Arthur', 'king', 'limited', 'world', 'disenchanted', 'life', 'wife', 'Lancelot', 'have', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'Mr', 'Extra-Curricular', 'Activities', 'Rushmore', 'prep', 'school', 'where', 'lay', 'scene', 'bond', 'two', 'what', 'first', 'Blume', 'seeing', 'Max', 'son', 'never', 'had', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'twins', 'have', 'Max', 'seeing', 'Blume', 'father', 'dreams', 'Max', 'father', 'everyone', 'father', 'neurosurgeon', 'rather', 'barber', 'Max', 'who', 'Guinevere', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Miss', 'Rosemary', 'Cross', 'teacher', 'Rushmore', 'Recently', 'widow', 'amused', 'flattered', 'Max', 'attention', 'Latin', 'classes', 'token', 'affection', 'obviously', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'draw', 'line', 'When', 'Blume', 'enamored', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'two', 'males', 'becomes', 'shall', 'say', 'strained.Ironically', 'more', 'go', 'other', 'more', 'Blume', 'Max', 'prove', 'true', 'affinity', 'one', 'assumption', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'will', 'end', 'when', 'dust', 'settled', 'see', 'anybody', 'left', 'alive', 'battlefield', 'writers', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'have', 'higher', 'aspirations', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'turn', 'marvelously', 'understated', 'subtle', 'performances', 'yes', 'even', 'Murray', 'so', 'even', 'action', 'going', 'top', 'film', 'not', 'Every', 'absurdity', 'well', 'grounded', 'created', 'reality', 'world', 'are', 'visiting', 'Anderson', 'additional', 'credit', 'director', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'film', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'being', 'wickedly', 'cynical', 'obvious', 'double', 'bill', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'Election', 'quot', 'will', 'only', 'serve', 'underscore', 'effectiveness', 'more', 'subtle', 'performances', 'quot', 'Rushmore.', 'quot']",Rushmore

This also becomes a source of an endearing rivalry and friendship between  Bill and Max, and all of a sudden you have a honest, sometimes dark,  sometimes touching look at human relationships.More than a  coming-of-age story, it's a story about the weird people we meet and the  weirder (and special) friendships we get from them.

Hailed world wide as the arrival of a new force in film making, even though it's Anderson's second film, Rushmore put Jason Schwartzman into the spotlight and thrust Bill Murray back into homes all over America.Rushmore is, basically, the story a woman you can't have, and the effect it has on the two men who want her. (Jules & Jim automatically comes to mind as another influence.)  Schwartzman plays, masterfully, Max Fischer - doing his best to involve himself in as many extracurricular activities as possible, and to avoid homework as often as he can.  Max is growing up too quickly, he has an air of pseudomaturity, and this only raises in intensity when he meets Rosemary, a teacher at his school.He does his best to impress her, as any young boy in love would.  He buys her new fish, and seems interested in her life outside of school.  She catches on and informs him that he's far too young for her.All the while, Murray's character, Harold Bloom, is miserable in his life with his cheating wife and annoying twin sons.  He meets Max and is strangely in awe of the young man and his tenacity.  Through Max he meets Rosemary and he too falls for her subtle charms.What follows is a war between two men, well, one man and a boy, a war for something neither one could ever acquire.For it's few flaws, it remains a fairly realistic, touch and poignant look at adolescent love.",4,the Re-Birth of Bill Murray (and probably Anderson's only masterpiece),1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1717,"['Well', 'i', 'use', 'masterpiece', 'loosely', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'least', 'good', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'same', 'way', 'say', 'Red', 'Beard', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'melding', 'of/take', 'Rye', ""'Harold"", 'Maude', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'success', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'Hailed', 'world', 'wide', 'arrival', 'new', 'force', 'film', 'making', 'even', 'Anderson', 'second', 'film', 'Rushmore', 'put', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'spotlight', 'thrust', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'back', 'homes', 'America.Rushmore', 'basically', 'story', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'effect', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'automatically', 'mind', 'influence', 'Schwartzman', 'masterfully', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'doing', 'best', 'involve', 'as', 'many', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'possible', 'avoid', 'homework', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'Max', 'growing', 'up', 'too', 'quickly', 'air', 'pseudomaturity', 'only', 'intensity', 'when', 'Rosemary', 'teacher', 'school.He', 'best', 'impress', 'young', 'boy', 'love', 'would', 'new', 'fish', 'interested', 'life', 'school', 'informs', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'while', 'Murray', 'character', 'Harold', 'Bloom', 'miserable', 'life', 'cheating', 'wife', 'annoying', 'twin', 'sons', 'Max', 'strangely', 'awe', 'young', 'man', 'tenacity', 'Max', 'Rosemary', 'too', 'subtle', 'charms.What', 'war', 'two', 'men', 'well', 'one', 'man', 'boy', 'war', 'something', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'acquire.For', 'few', 'flaws', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'touch', 'poignant', 'look', 'adolescent', 'love']",Rushmore

For Max, it was going to Rushmore. For Herman Blume, it was a never ending quest to find ""his Rushmore"". And that is the basis for the sophomore effort from director Wes Anderson and his screenwriting partner Owen Wilson. A good part coming of age story of both young and old and part dry comedy, Rushmore excels on every level with an outstanding ensemble cast, a obscenely witty and smart screenplay, intricate set design, and the perfect 60s Mod soundtrack of coming of age music.Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a middle class teenager who gained a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore private school (he wrote a one act Watergate play in the first grade) and he's a star in dozens of extra curricular activities which have a negative effect on his class work. Max's chapel partner Dirk Calloway seems to be Max's only real friend and acts as Max's assistant (because you need one when you have ambitions like Max does). Max is able to have a incredible clout at Rushmore and he's skirted around the grades issue before by sweet-talking his way with the administration.Enter Henry Blume (Bill Murray) a wealthy industrialist whose sons are idiots, marriage is falling apart, and he's enamored with Max Fisher because he seems have the self contentment Blume can only dream of. They enter an unlikely friendship where Max is the son Blume never had and Blume is the man with the pocketbook who can help Max's over ambitious projects come to fruition. One catch, they're both in love with the same woman, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed elementary teacher at Rushmore. We're never sure why anyone here would really be attracted to each other but that adds to the fun.The film is quite endearing, which is carried by the amazing performance of Schwartzman whose Max will one minute have you pity him and the next mad as hell. Max's ambitions early in the picture are all of triumph, but soon they get out of control and he's lost. Our 3 central characters are all alone but seem to continuously destroy their relationships with each other because they seem to be afraid to be happy. The sad soul lying underneath the film makes the character's final triumph all that much more sweet. Before the end Max has to allow himself to find his ""Rushmore"" outside of his former school, Blume needs to come to terms with his middle age monotonous life, and Miss Cross needs to move past her deceased husband. Only one man can make this happen and that's Max Fischer who ultimately does this through the help of Dirk and the new girl in his life Margaret Yang at his new school, Grover Cleveland, who like Dirk has appreciation of Max's mass aspirations.At any point Anderson and Wilson could have let their story tread into standard coming of age ground but throughout it stays fresh and vibrant. We have to tip our cap to Max's glorious ambitions because we'd never have the audacity to even think about such things while Max acts on them.

464430,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305428239,Matthew Horner,"[0, 2]","In the recent avalanche of movies about teen angst in high school, Rushmore is easily the best. It doesn't cover any new ground, but it presents us with some funny and eccentric characters who carry on in a story line that becomes increasingly more hilarious and improbable.Max Fischer [Jason Schwartzman] is the nerd equivalent of a high school jock. Rather than earn letters in sports, Max gets involved in - and usually is president of - every club on the campus of the private school, Rushmore Academy. He's in everything from the bee keeper's club to the drama club, for which he also writes all the plays. Though obviously smarter than the average jock, Max shares with sports figures a tendency to let his extracurricular activities ruin his grades.Max befriends Herman Blume [Bill Murray], a wealthy benefactor of the school who believes that the rich students should be ""mowed down,"" probably because his own sons are idiots. Since Max's father is a barber, he thinks Herman is right on.Later, Max falls for a young teacher named Rosemary [Olivia Williams]. Though Rosemary sensibly points out that it would be ridiculous to have an affair with a fifteen-year old boy, Max is persistent. He enlists the aid of Herman, who winds up having an affair with Rosemary himself. This leads to an all-out war between the two. Eventually Max gets expelled, but finds new strength in a public school.The fun element in Rushmore is the tendency of the characters, who reside in a normal setting, to react in abnormal or unexpected ways. Everyone is just a little batty, much as they were in the great comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. Yet they remain lovable. They possess traits we can often relate to. Herman may be a tycoon, but he can revert to adolescent behavior when pushed too far. Max is often defeated, but he is such a natural leader that he just moves on.Rushmore is fairly unique in that it does not follow the popular gross-out formula. This absence of bathroom humor is a nice change.If it has a theme, I think it must be that people who appear to be outsiders often find their way by interacting with others who are the same, even though there is a danger that they may kill each other in the process.",4,"Quirky, eccentric comedy about teen angst",1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2213,"['recent', 'avalanche', 'movies', 'teen', 'angst', 'high', 'school', 'Rushmore', 'easily', 'best', ""n't"", 'cover', 'new', 'ground', 'funny', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'who', 'carry', 'story', 'line', 'increasingly', 'more', 'hilarious', 'improbable.Max', 'Fischer', '[', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', ']', 'nerd', 'equivalent', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'Rather', 'earn', 'letters', 'sports', 'Max', 'involved', 'usually', 'president', 'club', 'campus', 'private', 'school', 'Rushmore', 'Academy', 'everything', 'bee', 'keeper', 'club', 'drama', 'club', 'also', 'plays', 'Though', 'obviously', 'smarter', 'average', 'jock', 'Max', 'shares', 'sports', 'figures', 'tendency', 'let', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'ruin', 'grades.Max', 'Herman', 'Blume', '[', 'Bill', 'Murray', ']', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'school', 'who', 'rich', 'students', 'should', 'be', 'mowed', 'down', 'probably', 'own', 'sons', 'are', 'idiots', 'Max', 'father', 'barber', 'Herman', 'right', 'on.Later', 'Max', 'young', 'teacher', 'named', 'Rosemary', '[', 'Olivia', 'Williams', ']', 'Though', 'Rosemary', 'sensibly', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'affair', 'fifteen-year', 'old', 'boy', 'Max', 'persistent', 'aid', 'Herman', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'Rosemary', 'all-out', 'war', 'two', 'Eventually', 'Max', 'expelled', 'new', 'strength', 'public', 'school.The', 'fun', 'element', 'Rushmore', 'tendency', 'characters', 'who', 'reside', 'normal', 'setting', 'react', 'abnormal', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'Everyone', 'just', 'little', 'batty', 'much', 'were', 'great', 'comedies', '1930s', '1940s', 'remain', 'lovable', 'possess', 'can', 'often', 'relate', 'Herman', 'may', 'be', 'tycoon', 'can', 'revert', 'adolescent', 'behavior', 'when', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'Max', 'often', 'defeated', 'natural', 'leader', 'just', 'on.Rushmore', 'fairly', 'unique', 'not', 'follow', 'popular', 'gross-out', 'formula', 'absence', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'nice', 'change.If', 'theme', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'outsiders', 'often', 'find', 'way', 'interacting', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'even', 'danger', 'may', 'kill', 'other', 'process']",Rushmore

First off the director, Wes Anderson, did an amazing job at developing the characters and their respective personalities.  Then of course there is the excellent choice of the actors and actresses chosen for the film.  A mixture of well-known stars and relative new comers make it a fantastic combination of young and developed talent.  And of course, the story.  The story is an excellent portrayal of a 15 year old boy who is obsessed with his school, a first grade teacher, and writing/directing plays.  This movie has everything you need to feel drama and comedy that the actors make known, so you really get into the film.  The comedy itself is almost hidden and very dry, but it is so effective for a film of this nature.  Some might say this is a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie, but I feel that would be cleche.  I chose to say that this film is an excellent representation of young teenage rebellion, looking for a direction to travel.

Even if it's without the approval of the Dean.Or we could just talk about how great this film is.""Rushmore"" stars the son of Talia Shire(""Rocky""), Jason Schwartzman(of the highly-awful SLACKERS) in his debut performance as an overachieving student of Rushmore Academy named Max Fischer. Max does everything one could possibly do at a school except for keeping his grades high which suffer due to all the activites he works on. He runs clubs dedicated to stamp-collecting, astronomy, fencing, and debating, just to name a few and when he's not doing all this, he's directing ""hit-plays"" like SERPICO, based off the film of the same name.His friends consist of Dirk(Mason Gamble), his chapel-partner; Mr. Bloom(Bill Murray in a quiet, understated breakthrough performance), the owner of a metal/construction-plant; Bert Fischer(Seymour Cassel), his father; and his love, ""Miss Cross""(the beautiful Olivia Williams)...It ain't that easy, unfortunately. For someone who has done it all, Max doesn't have it all. He's only Dirk's friend because he likes his mother, he likes Mr. Bloom because he mistakenly thinks Bloom thinks the same way he does, him and his father are close but are more like friends and Mrs. Cross doesn't want to be romanitcally involved with Max because Max is a minor, for the love of God. On top of all of this, his fellow peers can't stand him as he ruthlessly and sadistically uses them to achieve his fame and steer his ship, the school he calls Rushmore Academy.RUSHMORE is beautifully written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, well-acted, expertly directed and at times, slightly touching.Bill Murray turns in an expert-performance and Jason Schwartzman is equally good. The fantasically set-up cinematography is a thing of beauty, a work of art, almost as if it came out of a master-director's playbook. The art-direction is like something out of a science-book from the sixties complete with the generic-yearbook font. And it all comes together to form a mosaic, ironically like one of Max's stage-plays.The funny thing about it is, this seems to be a surreal tale of kids and adults battling in a scholastic enviornment, but it's really about a group of mature adults, getting through their respective lives, discovering who they are, growing up to be the adults they've longed to be. It could be taking place in the real world in a business office, a tale set in an ancient society, or a small town in America, but it doesn't. The performers aren't supposed to play the characters they're assigned, yet like a Max Fischer Production, here they are. The setting is at a school, and the storyline remains the same, yet the characters are changed slightly...you can interpret this film many ways.The Criterion Collection DVD is one of the best I have ever seen. Great sound and picture and the extras! My, oh my! You get a featurette on the making of the film, Charlie Rose interviews Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, a great audio-commentary track by the filmmakers and actor, Schwartzman, an amusing set of stage-plays based on OUT OF SIGHT, ARMAGEDDON, and THE TRUMAN SHOW that will crack you up if you've seen all three films, cast auditions, storyboards, posters...this is a great DVD, just like the film.Go to Rushmore.

It is nowhere near as arch or twee as his later movies. It still has his quirky style and music usage, but the characters are actually relatable and the plot is relatively straightforward. It has a number of noteworthy performances, especially the central three, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Willliams. I've seen it a good ten times in the last 13 years, and it is a rewarding view each time.The Blu-Ray:This is an EXTREMELY impressive transfer. Criterion did a fresh 2k scan under the supervision of director Wes Anderson, along with a thorough clean-up of dirt and print damage. Detail is superb both in close-ups and wide-angled shots. Facial detail is outstanding, among the best on the format. So is cloth texture - some of the tweedy and hounds-tooth jackets are amazing. Colors are lush and vibrant but free of any bleeding or over-saturation. Black levels are stout and never waver, but still retain perfect detail near black. Grain is stable, light, and omnipresent. There is no edge enhancement, noise reduction, or anything untoward or artificial. This looks as much like the film as a Blu-Ray can, and I say this having seen it three times in the theater.I did some comparisons between the Criterion DVD and the Blu-Ray, and the difference is literally like having Lasik surgery or something - practically every shot is crystal clear, and is competitive with the best high definition video out there today.  This is not one of those discs where you won't be able to tell the difference between BD and DVD. It is an absolute slam dunk upgrade.Better still, all of the comprehensive extras and commentary are carried over from the previous disc. So sell it, use it as a coaster, target practice, whatever.

But the real star of the film is the script,  which is unpredictable, beautifully erudite and always completely truthful.This is the sort of film that I loved so much that I wanted to tell  everyone to go and see it, yet, at the same time, keep it to myself,  because it spoke to me, and in a sense, it was about me.Best of all is  the soundtrack - the music I grew up loving.

Since enough praise has already been posted about the film, I'll focus on  the extra DVD features. The best  of course is the commentary by Anderson,  Wilson, and Schwartzman. Not the best I've ever heard (that award goes to  Paul Thomas Anderson on Boogie Nights), but Wilson adds wonderful comments  about how so many of the best lines in the film come from his childhood.  That aside, there are wonderful cast interviews, audition tapes (!), still  photos, storyboard comparisons to the film, and storyboard layouts for a  few key scenes. Basically everything you could want and more. The most  charming is the Max Fischer Players performances from the 1999 MTV Movie  Awards. Wonderful!  Also included is a small map by Eric Chase Anderson of  the highlights of the movie. The only complaint I have is that the trailer  seems a bit grainy and muffled.

464443,A1VLHZ9KXRGVE0,6305428239,Mike,"[6, 7]","This movie is sheer brilliance. It's hard to tell whether this movie is a romantic comedy, or a coming-of-age drama. The plot circles around Max Fischer, who is an over-ambitious, extra-curricular high school student, whom befriends a Mr. Herman Blume. Both Max and Blume fall in love with the attractive and interesting first grade teacher, Miss Cross. The love triangle affects Blume's and Max's relationship in both a humorous and somewhat saddening way. All three characters are well-defined and the directing and photography are simply beautiful, with the use of the fall season to set the background. Every single line of the film is said with such a brilliant charm, it has to be seen to be believed. Many will not find a whole lot of comedy in this film without repeated viewing, but it is well worth it. The fact that Max is virtually blind to the age difference between him and Miss Cross brings a smile to my face with every viewing. Also, Mr. Blume sees himself within Max's personality, and is probably some of the reason that they form a friendship in which they both respect each other and resent each other. In the end, they find their relationship to be a great treasure, and is one of the reasons this film is so beautiful. I don't know whether this is a comedy or drama, but I love it, and those who don't might want to give it another or even a few more chances.

464444,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6305428239,Mike Stone,"[14, 18]","[The following is a review of the Criterion Collection DVD for &quot;Rushmore&quot;, and not the movie proper.]Wes Anderson, a self-described film buff and devotee of the Criterion Collection, must have jumped out of his boots when he found out the company planned a deluxe DVD edition of his second feature film, &quot;Rushmore&quot;.  But he probably didn't jump as high as I did the first time I found this DVD in my hot little hands.  The features included here follow standard DVD format -- audio commentary, photo galleries, video featurettes, behind the scenes footage, etc. -- but done at an excessively high level.  They do the film, one of my all-time favourites, deserved justice.From the main menu, which features the innocent sketches of Eric Chase Anderson, Wes' brother, and snippets from Mark Mothersbaugh's renaissance-style soundtrack, you can select from amongst the Rushmore AV Club, the Audio Commentary, the Max Fischer Players Presents, and Archiva Graphica.The Rushmore AV Club features various behind the scenes and promotional video clips.  The first, &quot;The Making of Rushmore&quot;, is ostensibly an Electronic Press Kit, filmed by Eric, intended to be longer (it runs nearly 17 minutes) and more in-depth than most EPK's.  Eric shows that he's come by his Anderson genes naturally, as he proves himself to be an observant, low key, and amusing documentarian.  The film is basically an annotated introduction to the crew and cast, with an oddball explanation of each person's job.  Favourite moment: on his last day, Bill Murray does his interview while getting his head shaved.  He convinces Eric to do the same.The Storyboard sections, which include an option to watch the film's opening scene while Anderson's storyboards play below, are instructive and illuminating.  Anderson's simple pencil sketches look like they were drawn by a 6-year old, but planned out by Alfred Hitchcock.  They are at once juvenile and precise.Next we get a complete episode of &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;.  I'm a big fan of Rose, whose interview style, while often times erratic, never fails to get something interesting from his subject.  And when your subjects are Bill Murray (who takes the first half hour) and Wes Anderson (who does a neat 20 minute segment to close the show), how can you go wrong?  Murray is charming and thoughtful and insightful (and, duh, funny).  Anderson, visible tickled that he's talking to Charlie Rose, is matter of fact about his talents and his film, while engaging Rose in a wonderful little conversation.Finally, this section includes the film's theatrical trailer.Next from the main menu is the option to turn on the film's audio commentary track.  Shared, although unfortunately not recorded at the same time, by Wes Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and star Jason Schwartzman, the track is a treat.  Especially for fans of the three men.You can tell they are all film fans.  They deliver the track as if in conversation, sitting next to the listener in a darkened theatre while the film plays in front of them.  They talk in stage whispers, so as not to disturb the viewing enjoyment of those around them.  It's quite sophisticated that way.Anderson knows what he wants, and knows how to get it.  And he'll tell you how, if you're willing to listen.  &quot;Rushmore&quot; seems like a serendipitous experience for him.  He's grateful for all the luck he had, from the casting of Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, to figuring out that the locations, to having a vast repository of influences to draw upon at just the right moment.  This is even carried through to a story about the genesis of his relationship with Owen Wilson.  But Anderson is not just lucky; he's smart, and he works hard to make his own luck.Wilson comes across as more of a spiritual guide to Anderson than anything.  That's not to say that he had any less to do with the screenplay, for it's obvious that he more than pulled his weight.  I mean that it's Owen's charismatic personality, his charm, and his wit that the less captivating Anderson can latch on to.  And, though he tells some truly interesting anecdotes about how &quot;Rushmore&quot; came about, he really needn't say anything of substance.  That slow, Texas drawl just gets me every time!Schwartzman's contribution surprised me.  In interviews he comes across as an unbound-Id, always ready to leap feet first into any situation and make the most of it.  But here he candidly admits that, and this shouldn't have been a surprise seeing as he was a first time actor, he was scared witless about being in the film.  But as he relaxed into the role, he brought a lot to it (putting the gum on the wall was his idea).  And even though it was intimidating at first, he seems to have developed an honest and sincere relationship with Bill Murray, one that he treasures to this day.The Max Fischer Players Presents section features four delightful video segments.  First you get the on-camera auditions of the principle young actors: Schwartzman, Ronnie &amp; Keith McCawley, Stephen McCole, Mason Gamble, and Sara Tanaka.  McCole, especially, has a grand old time, sporting a smile on his face as he spits out his lines in a luscious Scottish brogue.  The next two features show some of the artwork Max put together for his two plays-within-the-film: &quot;Serpico&quot; and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.  Finally, The Max Fisher Players, a repertory company made up of high school students, re-enact for the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, and &quot;Out of Sight&quot;.  They are at once satiric and respectful and innocent.  A real joy.Finally, in Archiva Graphics, you get a motherload of ephemera, including posters, promotional pics, and close-ups of all the in-film art.  The detail that Anderson is so noted for is exhibited for close examination.Even if the film weren't currently in rotation as one of my must-watch-over-and-over movies, the Criterion Collection DVD offers so much &quot;Rushmore&quot;-related material that it would probably still never leave my DVD player.",5,Take DVDead Aim On The Rich Boys: The Criterion Collection,1029628800,"08 18,

464459,AGHZCRWBR9XML,6305428239,"Preferred Customer ""C. Edman""","[2, 2]","I was 15 when I first saw this film. I was coming to the end of an odd emotional whirlwind, and my first year of crazy, irrational high school was almost over. A teacher I met in the first semester, an English teacher for whom I'd had a slight innocent crush on was now working at the local video store(I think she was the manager, but I cant be certain), anyway, she was only a student teacher, so she left after the first semester was up, and I missed her a lot, then I found that she worked at the video store, every Sunday I'd grab my movies, turn them in and rent three more, all because I could see her and talk to her about movies, video games, comics, books, anything. I'd heard of Rushmore many time through the internet, magazines, and other things, I'd seen Bottle Rocket(Wes Anderson's first and equally great film)and The Darjeeling Limited already, but it was Rushmore. I found it on the shelf, and rented it. I brought it home and probably watched it that night or the next. From the first scene on, I was entranced.Max Fischer(played to perfection by Jason Schwartzman)reminded me so much of myself, not only in his odd tastes, his somewhat mean-mannered behavior, his flaws, his everything, really. Max first meets Miss Cross after reading a passage she wrote into a book about the sea, a quote from Jacques Cousteau, he falls in love with her almost immediately. And through his naive encounters and constant strains to try and convince her she is the one for him, and he the one for her, he only manages to push her away, and lose what he wanted most. And through this, we see Max grow up, and become more mature. To me, the film was almost a mirror of what I was feeling at the time, depressed, angry, ""in love"", etc. it showed me something new, hope. And for the first time in a film it didn't seem cheap or trite, or whatever, it felt real, to me at least, and my own twisted up world view, but that doesn't matter. I never ever went to the extremes Max did, in fact, I never acted on my attractions what so ever, but I felt a kind of... I dunno soulful connection between Max and myself, for better or worse, he almost is exactly like me. Yes, I know this wasn't the ""average"" review, but I wanted to say WHY this film is so important to me, and why, after seeing it about ten times since, and about a year and half since I FIRST saw it, it still packs an emotional punch at the end when the curtains are drawn. This film isn't for everyone, so everyone shouldn't necessarily go see it. It's classic Wes Anderson dry, dead-pan humor, if you dont get it, you probably never will. The film is a lot like Harold and Maude and even the Graduate, but still functions solely in and of itself. This film isn't guaranteed to effect most people in the same way it did me, because most people dont have that first hand experience with what the film more or less deals with, and also in an innocent way, not like in a dark foreign art house film that'd make the thing into a very dark and disturbing endeavor, here, to me and my experiences, Rushmore couldn't BE anymore realistic. This is most definitely in my top ten favorite films, but probably only because of my experiences, check it out if you think you'll like it, it will certainly be worth it.I have grown to love Wes Anderson and his films, all somewhat surrealistic, and more than obviously inspired by both New Hollywood films of the sixties and also the artistic and cinematography of French New Wave films like Breathless, Pierot Le Fou and Jules et Jim(referenced slightly in the Life Aquatic, ""Not This One."").

This is defintely a film in which we are supposed to root for the hero (or the anti-hero)...the adorable short nerdy kid with a big nose and glasses. His mother died of cancer, his father is a poor-but-good hearted barber,he got into this fancy prep school on a scholarship, he is so smart that he solved a math problem that stumped MIT profs in a matter of minutes, etc. And the school bully picks on him.Well he isn't really that nice, himself.  He's insufferably rude to the Chinese girl, destroys Blume's marriage without a second thought, disables Blume's car which could have killed him.  But he's still ""adorable nerdy Max"" so we're supposed to overlook these quirks and love him.  I found his egotism much more annoying than cute.I suspect that guys who felt like nerds in middle school might like this film due to some sort of wish fulfillment but beware, he doesn't end up with the pretty school teacher in the end!  Maybe if another, more naturally likable actor had starred I'd have more interest in him..(Leonardo DiCaprio captured our sympathy as a young kid, in spite of committing huge crimes in Catch Me if You Can and I think that a lot of that was due to DiCaprio's natural sweetness)  Jason Shwartzman (whom I actually liked a lot in Marie Antoinette) just didn't grab my heart the way the script obviously intended.  Only once, when he smiled in the end did he seem a little sympathetic. For most of the film he sails through his antics with a vague superior smirk on an opaque, masklike face. There's no light there except an evil glint in his eyes  when he's seeking revenge.He looks like a cross between Woody Allan and Groucho Marx (were those his real eyebrows?.)

McNally ""Author, 'CLASS DISMISSED: 75 Outr...","[1, 1]","Since making his directing debut with the 1996 cult caper film ""Bottle Rocket,"" Wes Anderson has established himself as one of film's most exciting young directors. His second film, ""Rushmore,"" is a witty, heartfelt and often amusing film that features a hilarious performance by Bill Murray.Anderson wrote the quirky script with his right-hand man, actor Owen Wilson, with whom he also collaborated on ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" The story follows the trials and travails of high school student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a sharp kid who focuses his attention on a plethora of offbeat extracurricular pursuits (fencing club, Latin, playwriting) rather than his studies.In between attending to his various activities at Rushmore (the name of the private school he attends), Max develops a crush on Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), an elementary school teacher at his school. He also befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire whose two sons attend school with Max.Things soon fall apart for Max: The school expels him, Miss Cross denies his flirtations, and Blume begins courting Miss Cross himself. That sets up an extremely funny tete-a-tete between Max and Blume, highlighted by the scene in which Blume runs over Max's bike with his car.As the intriguing love triangle of Max, Blume and Miss Cross plays out, Max finds solace in his caring father and a female student at his new school. The ending, which features all the characters coming together to watch Max's newest play, is entirely satisfying without being hokey or cynical.Schwartzman, the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather""), exhibits a great knack for comedy throughout ""Rushmore."" But Murray steals the show with a masterfully funny turn that scored him a Golden Globe Nomination and Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. In one unforgettable scene, Herman suggests that his sons invite Max to their birthday party. ""There's gonna be girls there,"" replies one. ""Yeah,"" adds the other, ""Get your head out of your a--."" Murray's initial deadpan reaction will have you howling; his subsequent reach into the back seat to pummel his son will have you rolling on the floor.Anderson, who captured the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, exhibits a sense of craft that's rare for comedic directors. Rather than depend solely on physical gags or even amusing one-liners, Anderson uses set direction, art direction and music to enhance his vision.

464468,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,6305428239,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[6, 9]","A story about an overachieving high school student and a depressed millionaire fighting for the love of a preschool teacher sounds too bizarre to be made into a Hollywood movie, right? Well, not for Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. They came up with one of the smartest, most captivating screenplays in recent years and paired that with Anderson's fantastic and very personal style of directing, and with great casting for the lead roles. The result? Rushmore, one of the best movies you'll ever get a chance to see.Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) is a high school student. He goes to Rushmore. He has it all figured out - he is an average student at best, but his extra-curricular activities can not be contained. He's the president, or founder, or director to almost every single group, club or association in the school, ranging from calligraphy and debate to sword fighting and go-kart racing. And, most of all, he's the head of the Max Fisher Players theater troup.He meets Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a tired, depressed man who happens to be a millionaire . He has two annoying sons who go to school with Max. They hit it off and become friends - Max finds someone to look up to (other than his barber dad) and Blume finds someone that sparks the interest he lacks for everything else in life.Enter Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). Max falls in love with her at first sight, but of course, she pays no attention to him, so he recruits Mr. Blume to help him win her, but in the process, he too falls in love with the teacher. What follows is a hilarious battle of wits between the two as both try to get the other out of the way.Although this story alone would make a good movie, Anderson's writing and directing take this film to the next level. The setting of the film manages to remain contemporary while not being truly current (if that makes any sense). The supporting characters surrounding the leads are also interesting and capture your attention from the first moment (especially Wilson's brother Luke, the great Brian Cox as Max's principal and Seymour Cassel as Max's father).Another key element of the film is its music. Anderson is one of those directors that `gets' music and knows how to use it in his movies. I promise you that after watching this movie, you'll want to get the soundtrack to it.Rushmore is truly a hidden gem, one of those great movies that almost no one saw at the theaters, but that has gained a somewhat large cult following . There is a great Criterion Collection DVD that you should check out to truly appreciate this work of art.On a final, side note, Anderson and Wilson are the same team that brought us the also incredibly fantastic The Royal Tenenbaums (for which they were nominated for an Original Screenplay Oscar), also starring both Wilsons and Murray. As for Jason Schwartzman, he is another member of one of the most prolific Hollywood movies, the Coppolas - he's the grandson of Carmine Coppola, nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, son of Talia Shire, and cousin to Sofia Coppola, Nicolas Cage and Roman Coppola.",5,Amazing!,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,3057,"['story', 'overachieving', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'depressed', 'millionaire', 'fighting', 'love', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'too', 'bizarre', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'smartest', 'most', 'captivating', 'screenplays', 'recent', 'years', 'paired', 'Anderson', 'fantastic', 'very', 'personal', 'style', 'directing', 'great', 'casting', 'lead', 'roles', 'result', 'Rushmore', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'see.Max', 'Fisher', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Rushmore', 'figured', 'out', 'average', 'student', 'best', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'contained', 'president', 'founder', 'director', 'almost', 'single', 'group', 'club', 'association', 'school', 'ranging', 'calligraphy', 'debate', 'sword', 'fighting', 'go-kart', 'racing', 'most', 'head', 'Max', 'Fisher', 'Players', 'theater', 'troup.He', 'meets', 'Herman', 'Blume', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'tired', 'depressed', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'millionaire', 'two', 'annoying', 'sons', 'who', 'go', 'school', 'Max', 'hit', 'off', 'become', 'friends', 'Max', 'someone', 'look', 'up', 'other', 'barber', 'dad', 'Blume', 'someone', 'interest', 'everything', 'else', 'life.Enter', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Max', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'course', 'attention', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Blume', 'help', 'win', 'process', 'too', 'love', 'teacher', 'What', 'hilarious', 'battle', 'wits', 'two', 'try', 'get', 'other', 'way.Although', 'story', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Anderson', 'writing', 'directing', 'take', 'film', 'next', 'level', 'setting', 'film', 'remain', 'contemporary', 'not', 'being', 'truly', 'current', 'sense', 'supporting', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'leads', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'capture', 'attention', 'first', 'moment', 'especially', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'Luke', 'great', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Max', 'principal', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Max', 'father', 'key', 'element', 'film', 'music', 'Anderson', 'one', 'directors', 'music', 'how', 'use', 'movies', 'promise', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'it.Rushmore', 'truly', 'hidden', 'gem', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'almost', 'one', 'saw', 'theaters', 'gained', 'somewhat', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'great', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'work', 'art.On', 'final', 'side', 'note', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'are', 'same', 'team', 'brought', 'also', 'incredibly', 'fantastic', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'were', 'nominated', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'also', 'starring', 'Wilsons', 'Murray', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'member', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Coppolas', 'grandson', 'Carmine', 'Coppola', 'nephew', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'son', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'cousin', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Roman', 'Coppola']",Rushmore

With ""Rushmore"", however, I walked out of the theater immediately in a daze of pleasure.  It seemed as if the film revealed it self to me completely and wholly at once.  What makes it so special is the dazzling juggling act of hilarity and depression--and how one is a cure for the other.  The key to the film is the affecting performance by Bill Murray as millionaire Herman Blume (for which he was robbed of an Oscar.)  It's as convincing and touching a portrayal of angst as you could ever see.  Death haunts this movie--the death of Max's mother, of Ms. Cross' husband.  And it's just lightly touched on that Herman is a Vietnam vet (and has seen his share of death), but the traumas of the 1960's and 1970's seem to permeate every frame of the movie--check out Max's plays.  Herman is steeped in melancholy.  It's only Max Fishcer's riotously warped vision of forgiveness and reconciliation that allows Herman to come alive again.  (Notice how during the final production, set in the Vietnam war, Herman is the only member of the audience to *not* put his protective goggles on.)  Some days, I wake up feeling like Blume.

Equal parts character study, deadpan humor, and coming-of-age drama, Rushmore is that strangest of creatures - a sad comedy.  All the performances in the film are brilliant, but Bill Murray's melancholy millionaire is the highlight of the bunch.  The cinematography here is brilliant and steals effectively from films as diverse as Barry Lyndon and The Graduate; Anderson knows how to show off his actors rather than gloss over them, and the film is that much better because of his camerawork.  This is probably the best DVD on the market in terms of extra features.  It's a mystery how they managed to fit it all on one disc, but this set includes a documentary, taped auditions, storyboards, and a hilarious send-up of several of that year's films.  Also included is an introduction to the film, and a great map of Rushmore.  The transfer is also excellent (and apparently supervised by Anderson himself), and the sound is very good.One mild warning: some people hate this movie.  I mean HATE.  If you don't buy the Max Fischer character, you will probably be one of those people.  I think it's brilliant, I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, but in order to make this an even-handed review, I will simply say that several nice, interesting, intelligent people can't stand to sit through this movie.

A movie with the mordant tone of Donnie Darko or The Royal Tennenbaums.And Rushmore I'd contend is the most extraordinary feather in his illustrious cap to date. It is difficult to classify. Romance features as a pervasive undercurrent, full of mercurial dialogue and quirky moments, but it's not merely a romantic-comedy. It's not even your average angst-filled coming-of-age story. It's an oddity with a flowy screenplay that begs to be discovered individually, for oneself.The acting all round is top notch. Schwatzman, our young protagonist, is very intriguing in his potrayal of an academically challenged overachiever. Murray delivers a rock solid sad-sack performance as usual, his long face speaking volumes.The brand of subtle humour may not spring out to everyone but is hilarious when pondered over.

464479,AVN00ASBFTMN6,6305428239,Smoking Ace,"[1, 2]","Wes Anderson has always been a tricky director for me. There are things I love about his films (The usage of colors, the odes to french new wave, and of course his brilliant music montages.)and things I outright hate (The low key sense of humor that seems to be somewhat self aware, the glaring overtones of pretensiousness).Of all the Anderson films I have seen where the good out way the bad I would say that 1999's Rushmore makes the list. The typical adjectives used to describe Anderson films can be applied here: Witty, quirky, odd, sentimental, dry. And the Anderson/Wilson humor is still present too: ""These are my O.R scrubs."" ""O.R they?"" (a joke so stupid that you just can't help but chuckle). But what makes Rushmore a favorite for most are the characters. Max Fischer is one of the most odd ballishly relatable characters to ever star in a film: He is like a mash up of the Graduate's Benjamin Braddock, Election's Tracy Flick, and of course Harold from Harold and Maude. With his Groucho eyebrows, thick specs, and slicked back barber cut hair, Jason Schwartzman pulled off a performance that finds a strange balance between loveable and narcissistic. This was also the debut of Bill Murray's indie comedy career as Mr. Blume: the man cursed with ""Child in Man's body"" syndrome. When Murray is in these types of comedies, it shows his vast range of comedic talent: He can be off the wall funny ""What about Bob?"" but he can also be hilarious just standing in an elevator hiding beer cans in a cart full of nursing scrubs.Some overreliance on plot in Rushmore is the main bug of the film for me. The 1st 30 minutes of Rushmore might be some of the best filmmaking Anderson has ever done: Humorous, at times actually hilarious (C'mon how can you go wrong with high school production of Serpico?), and the characters are shown more interest than the plot. But near the 40 minute mark, the film's characters become out of focus, putting more attention on the war between Fischer and Blume than on what really drives these characters. The last act of the film has its charming moments (The ""I am Waiting"" montage is one of the film's best moments) but the film's climax overall dissapoints. I just felt that something was missing, that the script didn't delve deep enough into the potential the first half and the Max Fischer character offered. That the film still had alot more to say, and was then cut off.Although these are major complaints, I still would consider not skipping Rushmore. Even though it isn't as good as it could have been, the film still has a very lovable spark to it. One really can't deny the pleasure of seeing two people jaunting around a steel factory to John Lennon's ""Oh Yoko!"". So even with all my grievances, I guess I still can't help but be lured into Rushmore's undeniable charm.

He is president and founder of numerous school clubs, mentors a younger pupil and talks with airs and graces not normally becoming a fifteen year student.  He also works at seducing a young teacher who works at the school and who he falls deeply in love with.  He befriends another pupils father (played by Murray) and when he too falls for the teacher things start to go awry.This has Anderson's quirky touch throughout and whilst a lot of the lines are delivered dead pan and this isn't an out and out comedy, I found myself laughing for much of the film.  Jason Schwartzman is simply excellent in this film and his delivery of numerous lines borders on perfection.  Bill Murray is as superb as we have come to expect and I tend to feel he is rather overlooked as a credible actor due to his more outlandish early comedy films.  The direction is as good as anything Anderson has done before or since and the story balances on the cusp of sadness and triumph throughout, not giving anything away until the very end.For a look at young unrequited love and the life of a young male adolescent, however unique he may be, this film is unmatched and the excellent direction, coupled with some stunning performances throws up a surprisingly good film that can be enjoyed again and again.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,Rushmore,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,1605,"['Rushmore', 'classic', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'up', 'dry', 'humorous', 'storyline', 'enough', 'depth', 'elevate', 'mere', 'comedy.Max', 'Fischer', 'Rushmore', 'Private', 'Academy', 'poor', 'grades', 'school', 'life', 'full', 'vigour', 'president', 'founder', 'numerous', 'school', 'clubs', 'mentors', 'younger', 'pupil', 'talks', 'airs', 'graces', 'not', 'normally', 'becoming', 'fifteen', 'year', 'student', 'also', 'seducing', 'young', 'teacher', 'who', 'school', 'who', 'deeply', 'love', 'pupils', 'father', 'played', 'Murray', 'when', 'too', 'teacher', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'awry.This', 'Anderson', 'quirky', 'touch', 'whilst', 'lot', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'dead', 'pan', ""n't"", 'out', 'comedy', 'found', 'laughing', 'much', 'film', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'simply', 'excellent', 'film', 'delivery', 'numerous', 'lines', 'borders', 'perfection', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'as', 'superb', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'tend', 'feel', 'rather', 'overlooked', 'credible', 'actor', 'due', 'more', 'outlandish', 'early', 'comedy', 'films', 'direction', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Anderson', 'done', 'story', 'balances', 'cusp', 'sadness', 'triumph', 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'very', 'look', 'young', 'unrequited', 'love', 'life', 'young', 'male', 'adolescent', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'unmatched', 'excellent', 'direction', 'coupled', 'stunning', 'performances', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Rushmore

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[7, 8]","Rushmore is a quirky and delightful motion picture directed by Wes Anderson (Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou) and starring Jason Schwartzman (Simone) and Bill Murray (Groundhog Day).The movie is similar to classic films like Harold And Maude and The Graduate in that it's a story of a young man who becomes infatuated with a teacher at his school, an older and much wiser woman.The movie pursues Max, played by Schwartzman, a loser, who somehow fits into many clubs at Rushmore private school including theatre, cheerleading, and the debate team. He meets Herman Blume, played by Murray, a well off businessman and father of some of the boys at the school, who thinks Max is a genius. Max also meets Miss Cross, a British elementary teacher, whom he becomes attracted to. Max introduces Miss Cross to Herman and the two become more than friends in no time. Max is left feeling betrayed by Herman and fooled in thinking that he can actually get Miss Cross to be all his. Max's hilarious escapades as he attempts to take revenge on Herman and Herman's retaliations are some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen.The movie features music from 70's artists such as Cat Stevens, who also provided music for Harold And Maude adding another close similarity to the 70's classic, John Lennon and The Faces.RecommendedB+",4,Here comes my baby...,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1312,"['Rushmore', 'quirky', 'delightful', 'motion', 'picture', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Simone', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '.The', 'movie', 'similar', 'classic', 'films', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'Graduate', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'infatuated', 'teacher', 'school', 'older', 'much', 'wiser', 'woman.The', 'movie', 'pursues', 'Max', 'played', 'Schwartzman', 'loser', 'who', 'somehow', 'fits', 'many', 'clubs', 'Rushmore', 'private', 'school', 'including', 'theatre', 'cheerleading', 'debate', 'team', 'Herman', 'Blume', 'played', 'Murray', 'well', 'businessman', 'father', 'boys', 'school', 'who', 'Max', 'genius', 'Max', 'also', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'British', 'elementary', 'teacher', 'whom', 'attracted', 'Max', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'Herman', 'two', 'become', 'more', 'friends', 'time', 'Max', 'left', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'Herman', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'be', 'Max', 'hilarious', 'escapades', 'take', 'revenge', 'Herman', 'Herman', 'retaliations', 'are', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'movie', 'features', 'music', '70', 'artists', 'such', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'who', 'also', 'provided', 'music', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'adding', 'close', 'similarity', '70', 'classic', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Faces.RecommendedB+']",Rushmore

464488,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,6305428239,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 4]","Comedy is so subjective. Some people want American Pie, The Hangover, or the latest Eddie Murphy movie, while others prefer gentle indie comedies such as Little Miss Sunshine.What makes you laugh?I often think about my own sense of humor and it's difficult to pin down at times. I tend to avoid cheap laughs or things done for shock value, and I admire intelligent dialogue and quirky or original takes on everyday situations. One director who never fails to make me smile is Wes Anderson. He definitely falls into the quirky category, but there is so much more to his movies than that.Rushmore is Anderson's second movie, coming two years after his debut, Bottle Rocket. Both movies were written with Owen Wilson, and they have a similar feel. Anderson is one of those directors who appears to make movies about nothing and it's easy to sit there wondering what you just watched. But, unlike many comedies, there are deeper themes present. I usually find myself thinking about Anderson's work several days after I see the movie. That's the case this time, and it's the main reason I am writing this review.Rushmore stars Jason Schwartzman in his first role. He plays Max Fischer, who is a 15-year-old student at Rushmore, a private school. He's there because he wrote a play in second grade and won a scholarship. Most of the students have rich parents, but Max's father is a barber and Max has to lie and claim that he's the son of a brain surgeon in order to gain acceptance.Max is struggling at school and is informed that he'll be expelled if he flunks another class. His main problem is not one of intelligence, it's his lack of focus. He takes on so many extracurricular activities that he doesn't have time to work on his grades. We see snippets of Max indulging in each of these activities, such as beekeeping and fencing, and these snapshots give the movie a lot of charm. It reminds me of Amelie and some of Jeunet's other work in that regard.As usual, something feels odd in Anderson's world. This effect is heightened by the dialogue. For example, Max sounds as if he is much older. He talks so seriously and it's funny that someone of that age thinks the way he does. Watch him direct Serpico for the school play and you'll see just what I mean.The heart of the story involves an unusual love triangle. Max befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a wealthy tycoon and former student of Rushmore. They both develop feelings for Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), who teaches at the school.I won't reveal any more of the plot, because it doesn't really matter. All you need to know is that Rushmore is a typical Wes Anderson film. He'll surprise you at times, make you laugh, and leave you wondering how he came up with such original ideas.I should also mention Mark Mothersbaugh, who began his association with Anderson on this film by contributing to the soundtrack. Other music used in the film includes songs by The Kinks, The Who, The Faces, and John Lennon. They all add to the nostalgic tone and fit perfectly.Owen Wilson doesn't appear in this one, but Luke and Andrew Wilson are both involved. If you appreciate quirky comedy, Rushmore won't disappoint.The Criterion Blu-ray offers a superb presentation. Colors are natural throughout and you'll feel as if you are standing next to the characters. The special features are also noteworthy and the highlight is a 55-minute feature showing interviews with Murray and Anderson on the Charlie Rose Show. Fans of commentaries will be happy that Anderson, Owen Wilson and Schwartzman appear on the commentary track.If you are curious about the appeal of Wes Anderson, Rushmore isn't a bad starting point. It won't work for everyone though.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Anderson does it again,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,3723,"['Comedy', 'so', 'subjective', 'people', 'want', 'American', 'Pie', 'Hangover', 'latest', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'movie', 'others', 'prefer', 'gentle', 'indie', 'comedies', 'such', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine.What', 'often', 'think', 'own', 'sense', 'humor', 'difficult', 'pin', 'down', 'times', 'tend', 'avoid', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'things', 'done', 'shock', 'value', 'admire', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'quirky', 'original', 'everyday', 'situations', 'One', 'director', 'who', 'never', 'make', 'smile', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'definitely', 'quirky', 'category', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'movies', 'that.Rushmore', 'Anderson', 'second', 'movie', 'coming', 'two', 'years', 'debut', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'movies', 'were', 'written', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'have', 'similar', 'feel', 'Anderson', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'nothing', 'easy', 'sit', 'there', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'watched', 'many', 'comedies', 'are', 'deeper', 'themes', 'present', 'usually', 'find', 'thinking', 'Anderson', 'work', 'several', 'days', 'see', 'movie', 'case', 'time', 'main', 'reason', 'am', 'writing', 'review.Rushmore', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'first', 'role', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'who', '15-year-old', 'student', 'Rushmore', 'private', 'school', 'there', 'wrote', 'play', 'second', 'grade', 'won', 'scholarship', 'Most', 'students', 'have', 'rich', 'parents', 'Max', 'father', 'barber', 'Max', 'lie', 'claim', 'son', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'order', 'gain', 'acceptance.Max', 'struggling', 'school', 'informed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'expelled', 'class', 'main', 'problem', 'not', 'one', 'intelligence', 'lack', 'focus', 'so', 'many', 'extracurricular', 'activities', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'work', 'grades', 'see', 'snippets', 'Max', 'indulging', 'activities', 'such', 'beekeeping', 'fencing', 'snapshots', 'give', 'movie', 'lot', 'charm', 'Amelie', 'Jeunet', 'other', 'work', 'regard.As', 'usual', 'something', 'feels', 'odd', 'Anderson', 'world', 'effect', 'heightened', 'dialogue', 'example', 'Max', 'much', 'older', 'so', 'seriously', 'funny', 'someone', 'age', 'way', 'Watch', 'direct', 'Serpico', 'school', 'play', ""'ll"", 'see', 'just', 'what', 'mean.The', 'heart', 'story', 'unusual', 'love', 'triangle', 'Max', 'Herman', 'Blume', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'wealthy', 'tycoon', 'former', 'student', 'Rushmore', 'develop', 'feelings', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'who', 'school.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'need', 'know', 'Rushmore', 'typical', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'film', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'times', 'make', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'such', 'original', 'ideas.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'who', 'began', 'association', 'Anderson', 'film', 'contributing', 'soundtrack', 'Other', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'songs', 'Kinks', 'Who', 'Faces', 'John', 'Lennon', 'add', 'nostalgic', 'tone', 'fit', 'perfectly.Owen', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'appear', 'one', 'Luke', 'Andrew', 'Wilson', 'are', 'involved', 'appreciate', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'Rushmore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint.The', 'Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'superb', 'presentation', 'Colors', 'are', 'natural', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'are', 'standing', 'next', 'characters', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'highlight', '55-minute', 'feature', 'showing', 'interviews', 'Murray', 'Anderson', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'Fans', 'commentaries', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Schwartzman', 'appear', 'commentary', 'track.If', 'are', 'curious', 'appeal', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Rushmore', ""n't"", 'bad', 'starting', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'everyone', 'though.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",Rushmore

The movie recites the tale of Max Fischer, something of a paradox- on the one hand, he is a wunderkind writer and an extremely gregarious lad whose social skills border on the level of a savant, while on the opposite extremity he is an underachieving, academic failure who has no time to ponder the theorems and axioms of Euclidean geometry.  He's a dreamer, he's caught up in his role as resident playwright at Rushmore, he is the founder of just about all the cool clubs (and the not-so-cool ones as well), and he basks in all the saturating glory afforded him by his private-school compatriots...why bother himself with dry, insipid textbooks?Well, for one thing, he's on the verge of being kicked out of his beloved Rushmore, a concept he finds beyond anathema.  But try as he might, he just can't get into the swing of things.  And another complication is added to his already challenged world: Miss Rosemary Cross, the institution's new pedagogue.  An infatuation with the bursting energy of a quasar builds up inside his psyche, he becomes obsessed by this crush; but, as fate would have it- as fate always has it- Cross is not the least bit interested in crossing the anachronistic line which separates them.Enter Herman J. Blume, wealthy industrialist and Rushmore benefactor.  Played with understated and sardonic elegance by expert-of-the-everyman-character and erstwhile member of the Saturday Night Live repertory Bill Murray, Blume develops a paternal bond with Fischer, finding in him a sharp contrast with his twin sons, a pair of progeny both crude in demeanor and lacking in high-level cognitive abilities.  He wishes Fischer was the product of his loins instead of what he's been cursed with, and he makes overtures to the boy by hanging with him and aiding him when necessary.A nasty thing then develops: Blume falls for Cross.  Talk about a tempest.  To say Fischer was hurt is to call the Big Bang a Little Pop.  By this time, the Rushmore student's shenanigans succeed in getting him expelled to a public school; having Blume now on Cross's tail in addition to such an indignity sends him over the edge, and a give-and-take battle erupts between the two, with Max siccing angry bees on his adversary and Herman crushing the kid's bicycle under his vehicle's tires.  Poor Miss Cross is caught in the crossfire, and becomes exasperated with the both of them.  But Fischer has one more play in him, and as he begins to assimilate the damage that he's done and received, he uses it to find some semblance of sanity not only for himself but for Herman and Rosemary.RUSHMORE is a complex tapestry of technique, make no mistake about it.  The filmmaking protocols and paradigms at work are quite subtle for the most part, yet are discernible for those willing to invest even a cursory analysis; it is an entire semester's worth at Emerson or UCLA, covering even the most ambitious syllabus.  Director Anderson is a genius at detail and execution, and he knows about pace- above all, he keeps things moving, and in fun, interesting ways.  Great example is when Max requests seed money from Blume for a project; watch as the dialogue's linear course is broken up into several successive scene changes, thus granting the illusion of swift shifting through the story's arc.  Each scene's vector is calculated with meticulous grace, the mathematics at work making sure that the sequences last as long as they need to (of course, this is not to suggest that such calculation is consciously going on in the mind of the director; but music is, as they say, just a prettier way of expressing number manipulation, and who can argue that a great movie is like a great song?).  Every subplot- and there really aren't any subplots in a sense, more like subconcepts- is treated appropriately and amplifies the value of the alpha plot.  As such, this is one of the best-edited works to come along in quite some time; it is worthy to note that it is probably due to the seminal reach of early-MTV videos, making proper use of the better trappings of that particular- and perhaps dubious- art form (good example: the yearbook-like montage of Fischer's clubs).Anderson doesn't stop there.  No, for his camera moves are slick and fluid when not static (when they are static, the above-mentioned quick-cut editing adds the style).  And his direction is as masterful as it is practical; although it cannot be stated with surety, it definitely seems as if he's a minimalist when it comes to giving orders, preferring instead to allow the thespians under his tutelage broad range of interpretation...given the nature of the material, it is probably a sagacious choice, since it is best for actors to draw upon their own experiences when it comes to slice-of-life artistic endeavors.  The soundtrack is almost a character in its own right, and is comprised of a song collection which not only captures the mood of the varied moments throughout the film with sharp accuracy but is catchy and offbeat; the excellent score was done by former head Devo Mark Mothersbaugh, the Pepsi to Danny Elfman's Coke.RUSHMORE comes highly recommended.  More could be said about it, but the thousand-word limit has almost been reached.

464492,A3TFFSO47Z3BX8,6305428239,"The Bluto ""adncjs3""","[4, 4]","The Criterion Edition of Rushmore is a jewel.  This movie is so untouched with the Hollywood Brass Committee storytelling that it seems like a miracle that the film was even made.  The film focuses on a strange teenage boy named Max Fischer who attends a posh private school called Rushmore Academy and his misadventures there.  The film is a coming of age odyssey, a romantic comedy, and a quirky drama all at once.  The film has been compared to coming of age classics like &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;.  It is a fair comparason for &quot;Rushmore&quot; will be remembered for years to come.There is such honesty in the storytelling and the performances in Rushmore, that I don't even fell like I'm watching a movie but a documentary.  Much of that is due to Bill Murray's perfomance as Max Fischer's older millionare friend.  Murray has usually been the focus of his films giving appropriately off beat and showy performances, but in &quot;Rushmore&quot; he's much more restrained.  Murray gives a true performance showing that not only can he be a great star but a great character actor as well.  There are many quirky and off beat characters in &quot;Rushmore&quot;, some are even very touching.The Criterion Edition of &quot;Rushmore&quot; has an insightful commentary by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson.  While listening you get the impression that both Wilson and Anderson have great affection for their effort here.

464495,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,6305428239,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[1, 2]","I was prepared to love this movie after all the raves: several critics' sites had assured me that Igby Goes Down, a coming-of-age film I admired greatly, was a poor man's Rushmore. They've got it backwards. Rushmore has the outward appearance of quirky offbeatness, but much of the plot, when viewed in black and white, is actually very conventional, especially in the second half, where much of the action becomes a series of one-upman stunts between Max (a marvelous Jason Schwartzman) and Blume (Bill Murray). The scene where Max reveals the affair to Blume's wife is mean sprited, conventional and while a convenient plot device to make Blume available to Miss Cross, is also a convenient plot device to make Blume available to Miss Cross, if you get my drift. For all its alleged unconventionality and subtlty, it's actually more conventional and not nearly as subtle as most critics seem to think.I think we've been fooled by the setup. The opening sequences, the characters, the whole mood of the piece, is very fresh. Certainly we've seen no one like Max in movies before, with his manic involvement in every activity imaginable. Yet, once having created him and his world, the authors fail to deliver with sufficient followthrough. Would someone with such an Orson Welles become so despondent so easily that he drops his high aspirations and decides to become a barber like his dad? I found that plot line 100% unbelievable, non-sequitor, and designed as a lazy attempt to tug at our hearts. Ditto the scene where Max climbs a ladder into Miss Cross' bedroom and fakes an injury to get her sympathy. I guess this was supposed to be endearing, but to me it belonged on the cutting room floor. Similarly, I found the ending--who wound up with whom--to be contrived. Why is Blume so suddenly desirable to Miss Cross? What's the linkage between Max and Margaret Yang, other than it's convenient to make one at the two-hour mark. Some critics said they couldn't see Sookie's motivation for pursuing first Igby and then brother Oliver in Igby Goes Down, but it's actually there and firmly established, unlike the relationships in this film.I will give credit to Olivia Williams, who plays Miss Cross. It's hard to play someone who is completely and utterly ordinary and yet attracts our interest and desire anyway. She is one of these people. We understand why a lonely and tortured soul would be instantly drawn to her, against all rationality and common sense. It's not easy to ignite this instant chemistry on the screen, but it happens here. Her charm is delightfully understated, and her scenes are the highlight of the movie.Now on to Bill Murray. I'm afraid I'm in the minority when it comes to this beloved actor: in short, I'm sick of roles where he merely stands there with mussed hair and a slight smirk on his face and makes a few dry cracks, and the critics fall all over themselves talking about his deep and richly-layered performances. Be it Lost in Translation, this movie or even Tootsie, I don't see where he does much aside from be Bill Murray. The same can be said for Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen and Robert Duvall, only he has even less charisma than they do. For once, I'd like to see him surprise me by stretching himself. Save your hate mail, you won't dissuade me.The film looks good on DVD. The pop music medley is a bit intrusive--again, I felt the similar technique in Igby was far better integrated.

Sadly, for a good 8 years, I've had to put up with the Touchstone DVD of this movie. The Touchstone DVD is, frankly, one of the worst transfers you'll ever see. It's non-anamorphic, every shot is really pixelated, and the colors are dull and drab. Just terrible. Fortunately, Criterion has given us this bluray which is a revelation. Watching this on bluray was like watching the movie for the first time. Vibrant colors, very fine film grain, the true aspect ratio the film was originally shot in, etc. The bluray transfer is gorgeous.

It goes well beyond being merely &quot;quirky&quot; or &quot;offbeat&quot; and manages to be wholly original and even groundbreaking.  Wes Anderson established himself as one  of the best new directors with Rushmore, fufilling the promise of his  underrated Bottle Rocket.  I think it is definitely accurate to place him  on par with P.T. Anderson and Quentin Tarantino.  Rushmore requires many  viewings to be fully appreciated (I have seen it at least 10 times and  still find new things to admire).  Its influences are both literary (J.D.  Salinger and F. Scott Fitzgerald)and cinematic (French New Wave, Stanley  Kubrick, and Michael Mann), blended into something unique and memorable.  The dialogue is the greatest, nearly every single line is hilarious. It is  unfortunate that so many people don't get this movie, it is a true classic  that I am thankful to have seen.

464500,A1WWDFQ8HSKT0,6305428239,Vincent M. Mastronardi,"[5, 6]","&quot;Rushmore&quot; is a new and exciting kind of comedy.  It's a quirky film about teens, but all is not about hormones.  Well, a little is but the  film does it in a very cleaver way.  Most teen films are awful glamour  pictures about beautiful young people and falling in love.  Isn't that  cute?  This film on the other hand is about breaking out and trying to make  something of yourself.  The character of Max Fisher gives you faith in  teens today.The movie is about a young man named Max Fisher (Jason  Schwartzman) that is in love with his private school Rushmore.  For most  people out in the academy, it's just another part of being rich, but for  innovative Max it's a dream job.  He focuses all of his time on extra  circulars and pet projects like plays (which are often violent but very  poignant).  This kid wrote a one-act play on Watergate before turning 7!  But these activities land him in deep trouble as he begins slipping grade  wise.  Still everything is great as Max not only finds a friend in a wise  but sly steel tycoon (Bill &quot;The Genius&quot; Murray) and falls in love  with a charming 1st grade teacher (Olivia Williams).  The friendship with  Herman is a good one, but Rosemary is not as impressed with the ideal of  romance with a 15-year-old.  One of the keys to impressing her is getting  Latin not only reinstated, but required!  It's the mind in action, and it's  a sight to behold. The fun doesn't last forever as soon Miss Cross realizes  the young man is falling in love with her.  If it takes his mind and  Herman's money to get her, Fisher it up to it.A new twist on the  &quot;teen&quot; movie is the smart and calculated hero that isn't perfect.  Max is not the richest kid by any means and is not easily liked.  He  manages to be appreciated for his talents and not his good looks or  something artificial.  Also fascinating is the fact that Max has a good  relationship with his hapless father.  Max shockingly doesn't really trick  his father but just uses him in the lot in the film.  He doesn't view him  as a threat at all while other teen movies have parents that are cunning  and to ready to punish their kids. Here it is dad that treats his child  extremely well, but won't dare try to restrict him.  Maybe this is wise, as  we see Max fall in his face but indeed learn from his mistakes.  Anyway, I  just thought it was worth noting the stellar performance of Seymour Class,  that is all.I don't want to give too much of this superior script away  but at some point Herman and Max do become enemies and then friend's again.  It's speculator the chemistry the two have as a comic team.  They are just  too ingenious for words, yet it is this cleaver dialogue that brings them  to life.  This film is superb in comic timing not to mention some emotional  moments.  It's a light-hearted but very smart movie with a few really big  twists and turns that no one suspects.  For many reasons, it's an excellent  film, from introducing Jason Schwartzman as a geeky but cutting edge kid to  being a great welcome back to Bill Murphy.  While Murray is always a comic  master, it had been while since he had done anything so this is a great way  to introduce him into a new generation.  His performance as a gloomy  millionaire trying to figure out life while having to put up with a  cheating wife and two obnoxious twins that he really doesn't relate to is  more than Oscar worthy.  If this is the last film he stars in (or last  notable one), it will be a great way to seal his career.  But please do  more, Mr. Murray.  You're the best.",5,Vet Murray and Newcomer Schwartzman.

464505,AMMEMPM9MPS55,6305428239,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[3, 7]","I struck up my acquaintance with the work of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson with the later The Royal Tenenbaums. I was not disappointed when I finally sat down to watch Rushmore. Anderson and Wilson have the extraordinary gift of being able to write characters and stories that are as deeply human and believable as they are absurdly surreal.Like Tenenbaums, Rushmore is a film about vulnerable people finding their way through conflict to resolution and reconciliation. From my Christian point of view, I like to see it as GRACE. In the world of Rushmore, there is even hope for a washed-up old failure like tycoon Herman Blume (Bill Murray).The filmmakers place in their world characters who are poles apart from one another: Rich and poor; English, Scottish and American; young and old; western and eastern. Somehow events conspire to show the characters their commonality; something breaks; and through the cracks we see glimpses of healing.Performances are incredible. I have never been a fan of Murray, but after this, I can see myself fast becoming a devotee. Schwartzman veers brilliantly between suavely sophisticated and grimacingly geeky. Seymour Cassel is a talent I would like to see more of: His brief appearances here and in Tenenbaums are to be treasured. There is even an amusing turn from Mason Gamble, who doesn't seem to have aged a bit since Dennis the Menace.The humour is subtle, yet hilarious to those with whom this brand of quirkiness resonates. For me, its funniness comes from the fact that the comedy is not arbitrary---no banana skins for banana skins' sake---but is made part and parcel of the characters, who they are and how they develop.I know this is a film I will watch over and over, simply because it resonates me on the deepest level as a human being---contra the critics who say that Anderson and Wilson's films lack heart and warmth. My favourite films have always been about vulnerable people who find courage and a means to healing, and Rushmore does that with the best of them.",4,"Bravo, Anderson and Wilson!",1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,2019,"['struck', 'up', 'acquaintance', 'work', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'later', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'when', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Rushmore', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'being', 'able', 'write', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'deeply', 'human', 'believable', 'are', 'absurdly', 'surreal.Like', 'Tenenbaums', 'Rushmore', 'film', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'finding', 'way', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'reconciliation', 'Christian', 'point', 'view', 'like', 'see', 'GRACE', 'world', 'Rushmore', 'even', 'hope', 'washed-up', 'old', 'failure', 'tycoon', 'Herman', 'Blume', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'filmmakers', 'place', 'world', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'poles', 'apart', 'one', 'Rich', 'poor', 'English', 'Scottish', 'American', 'young', 'old', 'western', 'eastern', 'Somehow', 'events', 'conspire', 'show', 'characters', 'commonality', 'something', 'breaks', 'cracks', 'see', 'glimpses', 'healing.Performances', 'are', 'incredible', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Murray', 'can', 'see', 'fast', 'becoming', 'devotee', 'Schwartzman', 'brilliantly', 'suavely', 'sophisticated', 'grimacingly', 'geeky', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'talent', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'brief', 'appearances', 'here', 'Tenenbaums', 'are', 'be', 'treasured', 'even', 'amusing', 'turn', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'aged', 'bit', 'Dennis', 'Menace.The', 'humour', 'subtle', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'whom', 'brand', 'quirkiness', 'resonates', 'funniness', 'fact', 'comedy', 'not', 'arbitrary', '-no', 'banana', 'skins', 'banana', 'skins', 'sake', '-but', 'made', 'part', 'parcel', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'develop.I', 'know', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'simply', 'deepest', 'level', 'human', 'being', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'films', 'lack', 'heart', 'warmth', 'favourite', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'courage', 'means', 'healing', 'Rushmore', 'best']",Rushmore
464506,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,6305428239,Young Kim,"[3, 3]","This is a precious movie.  No, the characters are not specially sweet and tender, and they all have warped motivations.  Nevertheless, the movie shows, by utilizing caricatures, some truths about people and trust.Rushmore is the name of a highly prestigious preppy academy.  Max Fischer, wonderfully played by Jason Schwartzman, is a sophomore who dreams of being a scholastic genius, but who has to compensate for his lack of academic capacity by involving himself in extra-curricular activities (or maybe his academic failures can be attributed to his extra-curricular activities).  To list all the clubs that he is a member, president, or founder would easily go over the Amazon.com 1000 word limit, so let's just say that if one can imagine any sort of school or after school activity, Max has done it.  His greatest passion is theater, for which he writes, directs, and acts; the plays he concocts are hilariously extravagant productions, and unfortunately cannot be described without giving away some great moments and visual effects.  Simply put, Max does not believe in half measures.Max attends Rushmore on a full scholarship provided by Mr. Guggenheim, the principal, but that scholarship is in jeopardy due to his poor grades and extravagant behavior.  To further complicate matters, Max comes from a humble family, his father is a barber, and he feels shame, lying about his family to his friends.The plot centers around Max and two adults.  Mr. Blume, a steel magnate played by Bill Murray, is rich, but not one who can be considered part of the elite.  He does drive a Rolls Royce, but for him, it might as well have been a Buick.  He drives it everywhere, without care or pride.  He has two annoying, spoiled sons and has been having marital difficulties.  After giving a speech at Rushmore, where his sons attend, Mr. Blume meets Max, and they both become friends - one a precocious child and the other an adult that never really grew up.  The third player of this comedy is Miss Cross, played by Olivia Williams, a new elementary school teacher at Rushmore.  Max falls desperately in love with her, but so does Mr. Blume, and the race is on.The humor can best be described as oblique.  The situations are funny because they are strange, but they take place in an extremely matter of fact way.  The score enhances this perception by its constant pace.  It is muted, calm, unlike most comedies where the music serves as the laugh track for the movie, and the audience clearly know where they are supposed to laugh by just listening to the crescendos in the score.The movie raises interesting questions about trust and friendship.  Who are our friends and our enemies, and if trust is broken, can it ever be repaired?  Can one trust in others without trusting in oneself?  The movie takes the audience in a journey of self-discovery, using Max as the little paranoid/compulsive child in all of us, the child that wants to be loved and admired, even though it is painfully aware of its own shortcomings.  The lessons, although sometimes funny, can also hurt.  All in all, it is a satisfying movie that has depth and humor.  There is much to be learned from Max Fischer, and the audience will have a blast while doing so.",5,Who is your Rushmore?,972345600,"10 24, 2000",2000,3233,"['precious', 'movie', 'No', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'specially', 'sweet', 'tender', 'have', 'warped', 'motivations', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'shows', 'utilizing', 'caricatures', 'truths', 'people', 'trust.Rushmore', 'name', 'highly', 'prestigious', 'preppy', 'academy', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'sophomore', 'who', 'being', 'scholastic', 'genius', 'who', 'compensate', 'lack', 'academic', 'capacity', 'involving', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'maybe', 'academic', 'failures', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'list', 'clubs', 'member', 'president', 'founder', 'would', 'easily', 'go', 'Amazon.com', '1000', 'word', 'limit', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'sort', 'school', 'school', 'activity', 'Max', 'done', 'greatest', 'passion', 'theater', 'directs', 'plays', 'are', 'hilariously', 'extravagant', 'productions', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'giving', 'away', 'great', 'moments', 'visual', 'effects', 'Simply', 'put', 'Max', 'not', 'believe', 'measures.Max', 'attends', 'Rushmore', 'full', 'scholarship', 'provided', 'Mr.', 'Guggenheim', 'principal', 'scholarship', 'jeopardy', 'due', 'poor', 'grades', 'extravagant', 'behavior', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Max', 'humble', 'family', 'father', 'barber', 'shame', 'lying', 'family', 'friends.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Max', 'two', 'adults', 'Mr.', 'Blume', 'steel', 'magnate', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'rich', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'part', 'elite', 'drive', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Buick', 'everywhere', 'care', 'pride', 'two', 'annoying', 'spoiled', 'sons', 'been', 'having', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'giving', 'speech', 'Rushmore', 'where', 'sons', 'attend', 'Mr.', 'Blume', 'Max', 'become', 'friends', 'one', 'precocious', 'child', 'other', 'adult', 'never', 'really', 'grew', 'up', 'third', 'player', 'comedy', 'Miss', 'Cross', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'new', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'Rushmore', 'Max', 'desperately', 'love', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Blume', 'race', 'on.The', 'humor', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'oblique', 'situations', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'strange', 'take', 'place', 'extremely', 'matter', 'fact', 'way', 'score', 'perception', 'constant', 'pace', 'muted', 'calm', 'most', 'comedies', 'where', 'music', 'laugh', 'track', 'movie', 'audience', 'clearly', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'just', 'listening', 'crescendos', 'score.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'questions', 'trust', 'friendship', 'Who', 'are', 'friends', 'enemies', 'trust', 'broken', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'repaired', 'Can', 'one', 'trust', 'others', 'trusting', 'movie', 'audience', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'using', 'Max', 'little', 'paranoid/compulsive', 'child', 'child', 'be', 'loved', 'admired', 'even', 'painfully', 'aware', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'lessons', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'can', 'also', 'hurt', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'depth', 'humor', 'much', 'be', 'learned', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'doing', 'so']",Rushmore
