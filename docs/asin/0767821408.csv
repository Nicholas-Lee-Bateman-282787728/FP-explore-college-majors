Those are some of my favorite movies so I figured I would like this one as well. I didn't, and it took me a while to figure out why. They're all quirky, all dialog heavy, all off-beat. So what's wrong with Bottle Rocket? In the other movies, the main characters are more intelligent than everybody else. That is not the case in Bottle Rocket. All the main characters are unbelievably boneheaded. I had high hopes, and just couldn't get myself to care about the characters. In a movie like this, if you don't care about the characters, there's nothing left. Lots of people loved it. Maybe you will too.

They are so true to life and have so many good actors in it. I'll start with &quot;Bottle Rocket.&quot; As I was  watching this my father said, &quot;This is horrible acting.&quot; The  later he said,&quot;Wait...they aren't acting. They're being human.&quot;  And that's what it is with both of these movies. Being human...showing life  for what it is and not what you see in the movies and on TV. Life isn't  perfect...but it sure as hell can be funny. Wes Anderson is brilliant. In  Bottle Rocket Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are great. One of my favorite  movies of all times. Then there's &quot;Rushmore&quot;...it is my favorite  movie of all times. It's so sincere and real, and touching and funny and  it's a blethera of emotions. I felt sorry for the characters, I laughed at  them, and I felt their pain. Love stinks. Jason Shwartzman is great as Max  Fischer, and Mason Gamble is great as his little fried...I see he's moving  on to good roles from &quot;Dennis the Menace.&quot; Bill Murray shows his  true acting talents for once. I mean, Bill Murray was hilarious  before...but now he's respectable. Olivia Williams is pleasant as the  teacher both of them are ga-ga over, but she doesn't really have that much  to do with her role. The whole movie leaves me with a smirk on my face.  Life can be funny is what both of these movies teach us. It can be really  funny. Bad things happen so later in life we can make jokes about it. And  that's what these movies show I think. They are real as you'll ever get, no  Hollywood BANG! This is life people, and you will crack up at it. Just see  these two movies. They will make you actual use your brain when you are  watching a comedy.",5,Rushmore and  Bottle Rocket: The Full Review,941846400,"11 6, 1999",1999,1794,"['quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'quot', 'two', 'most', 'sincere', 'movies', '90', 'believe', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'life', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'start', 'quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket.', 'quot', 'was', 'watching', 'father', 'said', 'quot', 'horrible', 'acting.', 'quot', 'later', 'said', 'quot', 'Wait', 'are', ""n't"", 'acting', ""'re"", 'being', 'human.', 'quot', 'what', 'movies', 'Being', 'human', 'showing', 'life', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'movies', 'TV', 'Life', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'sure', 'hell', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'brilliant', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'are', 'great', 'One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'times', 'Then', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'favorite', 'movie', 'times', 'so', 'sincere', 'real', 'touching', 'funny', 'blethera', 'emotions', 'felt', 'sorry', 'characters', 'laughed', 'felt', 'pain', 'Love', 'stinks', 'Jason', 'Shwartzman', 'great', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'great', 'little', 'fried', 'see', 'moving', 'good', 'roles', 'quot', 'Dennis', 'Menace.', 'quot', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'true', 'acting', 'talents', 'once', 'mean', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'was', 'hilarious', 'now', 'respectable', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'pleasant', 'teacher', 'are', 'ga-ga', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'role', 'whole', 'movie', 'smirk', 'face', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'what', 'movies', 'teach', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'Bad', 'things', 'happen', 'so', 'later', 'life', 'can', 'make', 'jokes', 'what', 'movies', 'show', 'think', 'are', 'real', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'BANG', 'life', 'people', 'will', 'crack', 'up', 'Just', 'see', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'actual', 'use', 'brain', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'comedy']",Bottle Rocket
15784,A1VQY8XWM19IXB,0767821408,Alan Cerny,"[0, 0]","BOTTLE ROCKET, directed by Wes Anderson, rewards intelligence.  Is that elitist?  Maybe.  But in a world of candy-coated  feed-it-to-me-in-the-simplest-of-ways movies, BOTTLE ROCKET is a gem which  you have to examine every facet.  And Owen Wilson's Dignan is a comic  masterpiece.  I would love to see another Dignan movie.What's the plot?  Basically, it's about three friends who decide to be bank robbers.  Anthony  (Luke Wilson), who has just checked himself out of a mental institution, is  friends with Dignan, a man-child who dreams of being a bigtime thief.  Bob  is their other friend, the getaway driver, mostly given that position  because he's the only person they know with a car.  Together the three live  a life of crime, basically because there doesn't seem to be all that much  else to do.What sets this movie apart from other crime films is the warm  center at its heart.  The film cares about Dignan, Anthony, and Bob.  And  it goes out of its way to say that being a dreamer is not only okay in this  world, it's a preferred way of life.This film was written by Wes  Anderson and Owen Wilson, who also co-wrote the brilliant RUSHMORE and next  year's THE ROYAL TANENBAUMS.  In my opinion, they are the best writers in  Hollywood today.  Some of the lines of dialogue should all be on a T-Shirt  somewhere.  &quot;On the run from Johnny Law...ain't no trip to  Cleveland!&quot;  &quot;They'll never catch me, man, because I'm  &amp;%*#&amp;%# innocent!&quot;  &quot;Could you please give me the  money...sir?&quot;This movie is the keepers.",5,BOTTLE ROCKET is a joy to watch - if you're on the ball.,967420800,"08 28, 2000",2000,1559,"['BOTTLE', 'ROCKET', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'rewards', 'intelligence', 'elitist', 'Maybe', 'world', 'candy-coated', 'feed-it-to-me-in-the-simplest-of-ways', 'movies', 'BOTTLE', 'ROCKET', 'gem', 'have', 'examine', 'facet', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Dignan', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Dignan', 'plot', 'Basically', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'decide', 'be', 'bank', 'robbers', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'who', 'just', 'checked', 'mental', 'institution', 'friends', 'Dignan', 'man-child', 'who', 'being', 'bigtime', 'thief', 'Bob', 'other', 'friend', 'getaway', 'driver', 'mostly', 'given', 'position', 'only', 'person', 'know', 'car', 'Together', 'three', 'live', 'life', 'crime', 'basically', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'else', 'do.What', 'sets', 'movie', 'apart', 'other', 'crime', 'films', 'warm', 'center', 'heart', 'film', 'Dignan', 'Anthony', 'Bob', 'way', 'say', 'being', 'dreamer', 'not', 'only', 'okay', 'world', 'preferred', 'way', 'life.This', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'brilliant', 'RUSHMORE', 'next', 'year', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TANENBAUMS', 'opinion', 'are', 'best', 'writers', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'should', 'all', 'be', 'T-Shirt', 'somewhere', 'quot', 'run', 'Johnny', 'Law', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'trip', 'Cleveland', 'quot', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'never', 'catch', 'man', ""'m"", 'amp', '%', '*', 'amp', '%', 'innocent', 'quot', 'quot', 'Could', 'please', 'give', 'money', 'sir', 'quot', 'movie', 'keepers']",Bottle Rocket

15786,A1SQFUCSPMUE8I,0767821408,ALF,"[0, 0]","&quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; lacks the focus and maturity of Wes Anderson's two later films, &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, but it is nonetheless a satisfying and often very funny film. Based on a short film that director/co-writer Anderson made in 1994, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; tells the story of three 20-somethings who aspire to be thieves.The comparison to &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; that appears on the cover is without basis, in my opinion. There is little grit or darkness to Wes's film. There's next-to-nothing in the way of violence or true obscenity (the things that often turn me off to Tarantino's films). It's colorful and bouncy, which is a good way to describe Dignan, the offbeat character played by co-writer Owen Wilson. It's the finest comedy work I've seen from Owen.It's also (along with &quot;Tenenbaums&quot;) the best performance I've seen from his brother Luke, who plays the protagonist Anthony. Luke's performance is subdued and also, very funny. The brothers have great chemistry together, and are able to make each other's performance more entertaining.Robert Musgrave rounds out the trio and gives a delightfully quirky performance as the awkward one who endures constant abuse from his brother. He cements his place in the group simply because he is the one who has the car. James Caan and Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana also deliver energy and comedy in their supporting roles.&quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is a wise film, and it makes a nice companion to the two aforementioned Wes Anderson films that everyone has seen. It is wise, fast-moving and extremely funny, although certainly not to everyone's tastes.The DVD from Columbia/TriStar is completely featureless (not even a trailer), but it displays the film's colorful palette with a crispness and fidelity that is most satisfying.",4,Spirited debut from Wes Anderson,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,1846,"['quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'quot', 'focus', 'maturity', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'two', 'later', 'films', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'quot', 'nonetheless', 'satisfying', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'Based', 'short', 'film', 'director/co-writer', 'Anderson', 'made', '1994', 'quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'quot', 'story', 'three', '20-somethings', 'who', 'aspire', 'be', 'thieves.The', 'comparison', 'quot', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'cover', 'basis', 'opinion', 'little', 'grit', 'darkness', 'Wes', 'film', 'next-to-nothing', 'way', 'violence', 'true', 'obscenity', 'things', 'often', 'turn', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'colorful', 'bouncy', 'good', 'way', 'describe', 'Dignan', 'offbeat', 'character', 'played', 'co-writer', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'finest', 'comedy', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Owen.It', 'also', 'quot', 'Tenenbaums', 'quot', 'best', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'brother', 'Luke', 'who', 'protagonist', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'performance', 'subdued', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'brothers', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'other', 'performance', 'more', 'entertaining.Robert', 'Musgrave', 'out', 'trio', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'performance', 'awkward', 'one', 'who', 'constant', 'abuse', 'brother', 'place', 'group', 'simply', 'one', 'who', 'car', 'James', 'Caan', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'regular', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'also', 'deliver', 'energy', 'comedy', 'supporting', 'roles.', 'quot', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'quot', 'wise', 'film', 'nice', 'companion', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'everyone', 'seen', 'wise', 'fast-moving', 'extremely', 'funny', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'tastes.The', 'DVD', 'Columbia/TriStar', 'completely', 'featureless', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'film', 'colorful', 'palette', 'crispness', 'fidelity', 'most', 'satisfying']",Bottle Rocket

I've never been good at that.So I'll just say that this is one of the top movies of the 90's, and one of the funniest movies ever. I could keep going with hyperboles, but they're meaningless.What makes this film, as one reviewer said, is the humanity. We actually love these guys. Dignan is obtuse, potentially dangerous (mainly to himself), and an adorable little kid. The three of them fight like 12 year olds. I love it when Dignan feels hurt, then mumbles, &quot;You know my mom and Greg (?) aren't speaking to me&quot; (or something like that).The love between Anthony and Inez is sexual and innocent. Surprise. There's no nudity. There's a &quot;come on, let's run away&quot; spirit in Anthony. Inez is more practical. First she has to learn English, since there's no chance Anthony will learn Spanish. Something has to be done. After all, Rocky certainly isn't the best interpreter, and Dignan doesn't give the best messages!The reason I mention Grace is because that little 8(?) year old is the grownup in this film. Dignan even feels threatened by her (I won't give away his defensive retorts). I'm sure this is a major theme in Wes Anderson's films. He is fascinated by adults who haven't grown up (Bill Murray in Rushmore), and kids that are wise beyond their years (Grace, Jason Schwartzman's character and his little friend).See this film, even if you don't like it.

For example, in a lot of contemporary big-budget films, plot, script, and character all serve to support the special effects.  Oftentimes everything seems to be serving the lead actor.  In adult films, everything serves the orgasm.  Generally there is one thing that is the point of the film, and everything else exists as placeholders.  I think for Bottle Rocket, the master is character, and the plot really serves to motivate character development.  For whatever reason, and for whatever its worth, this seems like a much more valid point than, say, explosions or Kevin Costner's classic good looks.Still, to make a movie work, you've got to have more than good characters.  And in Bottle Rocket, every factor holds its own.  The film is wonderful to watch on a visual level, with vibrant colors and placeless locations.  The acting is eccentric and genuine, with the subtle and sweet Luke Wilson, and the endearingly pathetic Dignon.  The writing is spot-on, with indrecibly funny one-liners and dry wit spewing out so regularly that you'll need to watch it at least twice to digest all the humor.Most importantly is that at the end of the movie, you will love these charcters, and want to watch the movie again to keep them alive.",5,"Please watch this movie, for God's sake",1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,1323,"['Whenever', 'watch', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'ask', 'what', 'serving', 'what', 'movie', 'example', 'lot', 'contemporary', 'big-budget', 'films', 'plot', 'script', 'character', 'serve', 'support', 'special', 'effects', 'everything', 'be', 'serving', 'lead', 'actor', 'adult', 'films', 'everything', 'orgasm', 'Generally', 'one', 'thing', 'point', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'placeholders', 'think', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'master', 'character', 'plot', 'really', 'motivate', 'character', 'development', 'reason', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'valid', 'point', 'say', 'explosions', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'classic', 'good', 'looks.Still', 'make', 'movie', 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'more', 'good', 'characters', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'factor', 'own', 'film', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'visual', 'level', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'placeless', 'locations', 'acting', 'eccentric', 'genuine', 'subtle', 'sweet', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'endearingly', 'pathetic', 'Dignon', 'writing', 'spot-on', 'indrecibly', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'dry', 'wit', 'spewing', 'out', 'so', 'regularly', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'digest', 'humor.Most', 'importantly', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'charcters', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'keep', 'alive']",Bottle Rocket

15791,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767821408,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Wes Anderson is an acquired taste.  His aesthetic is very uniquely tuned into who he is as an artist that if you aren't dialed into his brand of humor his films will be lost on you entirely.  I have to admit, I am not a fan of all of his work, but when he hits a home run it is a real, tried and true masterpiece, and I must say that I have found his latest two offerings to be undeniable cinematic treasures.In my attempt to fully familiarize myself with this man's work, I dug back a few years to see where it all started.  In 1996 he teamed up with Owen Wilson to flesh out a short film they had released two years prior.  Thus, the careers of both these men were born.  Wilson went on to gigantic fame, thanks to his chemistry with the camera and his knack for playing the lovable loser, but his collaborations with Anderson show a depth to his talent that other directors have yet to tap into.  `Bottle Rocket' is a blast of a film that shows all of Anderson's promise and potential, and while it is certainly rough around the edges and lacks the glossy veneer and visual grandeur that he brought to his later films, the gritty indie quality adds a layer of likability to the film.It's oddly relatable.The writing is really key here.  Without the surprising character development, this would have been an average film at best, but there is so much between the lines here, in the things that are not said, and the comedic development is even richer than expected.  It's easy to see why Owen is the Wilson with the career, for Luke is rather lackluster but then again, his character is the least interesting.  He's even upstaged by his love interest, and she barely speaks a word of English.Look for scene stealing supporting performances from Lumi Cavozos and James Caan in this heist film about bumbling idiots that is sure to make you smile.",4,Anderson's debut...,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,1847,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'acquired', 'taste', 'aesthetic', 'very', 'uniquely', 'tuned', 'who', 'artist', 'are', ""n't"", 'dialed', 'brand', 'humor', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'entirely', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'work', 'when', 'home', 'run', 'real', 'tried', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'must', 'say', 'have', 'found', 'latest', 'two', 'offerings', 'be', 'undeniable', 'cinematic', 'treasures.In', 'attempt', 'fully', 'familiarize', 'man', 'work', 'dug', 'back', 'few', 'years', 'see', 'where', 'started', '1996', 'teamed', 'up', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'flesh', 'out', 'short', 'film', 'had', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'Thus', 'careers', 'men', 'were', 'born', 'Wilson', 'went', 'gigantic', 'fame', 'thanks', 'chemistry', 'camera', 'knack', 'playing', 'lovable', 'loser', 'collaborations', 'Anderson', 'show', 'depth', 'talent', 'other', 'directors', 'have', 'yet', 'tap', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'blast', 'film', 'Anderson', 'promise', 'potential', 'certainly', 'rough', 'edges', 'glossy', 'veneer', 'visual', 'grandeur', 'brought', 'later', 'films', 'gritty', 'indie', 'quality', 'layer', 'likability', 'film.It', 'oddly', 'relatable.The', 'writing', 'really', 'key', 'here', 'surprising', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'average', 'film', 'best', 'so', 'much', 'lines', 'here', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'said', 'comedic', 'development', 'even', 'richer', 'expected', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'career', 'Luke', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'then', 'again', 'character', 'least', 'interesting', 'even', 'upstaged', 'love', 'interest', 'barely', 'word', 'English.Look', 'scene', 'stealing', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Lumi', 'Cavozos', 'James', 'Caan', 'heist', 'film', 'bumbling', 'idiots', 'sure', 'make', 'smile']",Bottle Rocket

15794,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,0767821408,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Wes Anderson is probably one of my favorite quirky directors. With films such asThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,The Royal Tenenbaums, andRushmorein his repertoire, I feel the ""quirky"" title to be appropriate. Best known forRushmore(1998), Anderson's films have a unique edge to them. Definitely not in-your-face comedy, their impact is much dryer and subtler (I remember the nude gal inThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissoujust being there because some nudity was needed. And I remember Bill Murray driving back and forth over his enemy's bicycle inRushmorethen placing it back in its bike rack and how I knew this would influence the battle yet-to-come).I'd never heard of BOTTLE ROCKET until somebody pointed it out to me. Having enjoyedRushmoretremendously, it came highly recommended. And after watching it, I can see why.This is early Anderson, and a film that helped launch his inimitable movie style. Released in 1996 and starring the newly found Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen), it goes to show that Anderson knew how to pick a good script and good actors to round out a chuckle-fest.Luke Wilson (My Super Ex-Girlfriend) is no stranger to Anderson films now, having been given the lead role here and later strong supporting roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, Luke can celebrate his strong Anderson film trifecta and proudly point back to his roots in this film. Brother Owen (Cars) is one up on Luke in that he has performed in all of those, plus The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.Mental health issues abound for Anthony (Luke Wilson) and his buddy Dignan (Owen). In fact, Anthony has just been released from a voluntary psychiatric facility where he was resting after a nervous breakdown. Waiting for him in the bushes (literally) is Dignan, who believes Anthony is escaping from the psych ward instead via his own free will.The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by ""robbing"" Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).Word eventually comes to Bob (the driver) that a family member is in trouble and he has to return to town. Since he has the only car, Anthony and (more importantly) Dignan, flip out, telling him he can't leave. But he does and leaves Anthony and Dignan stranded at the hotel (which is fine with the love-struck Anthony). But Dignan wants to get out of there, so he devises a plan to steal a car and return to their lives of thievery. Not wanting to leave without his newfound love interest, Anthony tries to convince Inez to come with them. A misunderstanding ensues and he and Dignan are back on their debauched road. Eventually they take on a robbery at a meat packing plant and it goes horribly. Risking everything, eventually a choice has to be made about who stays behind -- and takes the risk of capture -- and who goes free.It is the strange and quirky (there's that word again) that drives this film. Owen Wilson's character (Dignan) is obviously an extreme case of an excessive-compulsive. He plans out items to the nth degree, ensuring that everything is okay decades later. Anthony (Luke) struggles to regain some sense of normalcy in his life but keeps getting dragged back down by his bond with Dignan while being tugged the other direction by Inez.In the end, all turns out bizarrely well. Dignan ends up where he belongs, Owen gets what he needs, and even Inez finds what she's looking for.Certainly one of the less known Anderson films, this one still comes highly recommended, just not as highly as his more recent works.",4,Early Wes Anderson Is Still Good Wes Anderson,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,4352,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'quirky', 'directors', 'films', 'such', 'asThe', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'andRushmorein', 'repertoire', 'feel', 'quirky', 'title', 'be', 'appropriate', 'Best', 'known', 'forRushmore', '1998', 'Anderson', 'films', 'have', 'unique', 'edge', 'Definitely', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'comedy', 'impact', 'much', 'dryer', 'subtler', 'remember', 'nude', 'gal', 'inThe', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissoujust', 'being', 'there', 'nudity', 'was', 'needed', 'remember', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'driving', 'back', 'forth', 'enemy', 'bicycle', 'inRushmorethen', 'placing', 'back', 'bike', 'rack', 'how', 'knew', 'would', 'influence', 'battle', 'yet-to-come', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'BOTTLE', 'ROCKET', 'somebody', 'pointed', 'out', 'Having', 'enjoyedRushmoretremendously', 'came', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watching', 'can', 'see', 'why.This', 'early', 'Anderson', 'film', 'helped', 'launch', 'inimitable', 'movie', 'style', 'Released', '1996', 'starring', 'newly', 'found', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'show', 'Anderson', 'knew', 'how', 'pick', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'actors', 'round', 'out', 'chuckle-fest.Luke', 'Wilson', 'My', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'stranger', 'Anderson', 'films', 'now', 'having', 'been', 'given', 'lead', 'role', 'here', 'later', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Rushmore', 'Luke', 'can', 'celebrate', 'strong', 'Anderson', 'film', 'trifecta', 'proudly', 'point', 'back', 'roots', 'film', 'Owen', 'Cars', 'one', 'up', 'Luke', 'performed', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou.Mental', 'health', 'issues', 'abound', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'buddy', 'Dignan', 'Owen', 'fact', 'Anthony', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'voluntary', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'where', 'was', 'resting', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Waiting', 'bushes', 'literally', 'Dignan', 'who', 'Anthony', 'escaping', 'psych', 'ward', 'instead', 'own', 'free', 'will.The', 'two', 'quickly', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'decide', 'return', 'life', 'petty', 'thieving', 'even', 'do', 'dry-runs', 'robbing', 'Anthony', 'family', 'home', 'order', 'see', 'still', 'have', 'robbing', 'edge', 'also', 'decide', 'take', 'strangest', 'heists', 'meat', 'packing', 'plants', 'bookstores', 'own', 'car', 'though', 'have', 'get', 'driver', 'pick', 'Bob', 'Mapplethorpe', 'Robert', 'Musgrave', 'simply', 'well', 'car', 'first', 'felony', 'aforementioned', 'bookstore', 'make', 'quick', 'getaway', 'leaving', 'town', 'scurrying', 'state', 'end', 'up', 'motel', 'middle', 'nowheresville', 'decide', 'hold', 'up', 'trio', 'quickly', 'sour', 'when', 'pretty', 'young', 'hotel', 'maid', 'name', 'Inez', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'Anthony', 'eye', 'Speaking', 'English', 'Central', 'American', 'goddess', 'fails', 'realize', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'yet', 'love', 'Anthony', 'partly', 'due', 'language', 'barrier', 'partly', 'do', 'Anthony', 'fumbling', 'ways', '.Word', 'eventually', 'Bob', 'driver', 'family', 'member', 'trouble', 'return', 'town', 'only', 'car', 'Anthony', 'more', 'importantly', 'Dignan', 'flip', 'out', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Anthony', 'Dignan', 'stranded', 'hotel', 'fine', 'love-struck', 'Anthony', 'Dignan', 'get', 'plan', 'steal', 'car', 'return', 'lives', 'thievery', 'Not', 'wanting', 'leave', 'newfound', 'love', 'interest', 'Anthony', 'convince', 'Inez', 'come', 'misunderstanding', 'ensues', 'Dignan', 'are', 'back', 'debauched', 'road', 'Eventually', 'take', 'robbery', 'meat', 'packing', 'plant', 'horribly', 'Risking', 'everything', 'eventually', 'choice', 'be', 'made', 'who', 'stays', 'risk', 'capture', 'who', 'free.It', 'strange', 'quirky', 'word', 'again', 'film', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'Dignan', 'obviously', 'extreme', 'case', 'excessive-compulsive', 'out', 'items', 'nth', 'degree', 'ensuring', 'everything', 'okay', 'decades', 'later', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'regain', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'life', 'getting', 'dragged', 'back', 'down', 'bond', 'Dignan', 'being', 'tugged', 'other', 'direction', 'Inez.In', 'end', 'out', 'bizarrely', 'well', 'Dignan', 'up', 'where', 'Owen', 'what', 'even', 'Inez', 'what', 'looking', 'for.Certainly', 'one', 'less', 'known', 'Anderson', 'films', 'one', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'highly', 'more', 'recent', 'works']",Bottle Rocket

Stewart ""Debussy & Sibelius Freak""","[2, 2]","This film is probably starting to make its way to mainstream with the commercial success of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen.This film is perhaps one of the best independent films I have ever seen.  Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson (who co-wrote with Owen W. and directed the film) paired on several films of less-than-popular stature.  All of them are quirky at worst and extremely entertaining at best.  As a note, I would recommend all of them as spectacular, with slight hesitation on ""The Royal Tannenbaums"".This film in particular was a showcase of how good writing can make up for subpar acting.  The actors in this movie were not great, but the story, the words, they were fantastic.  Basically, a guy gets bored with life and wants some adventure and he drags his buddies along as he attempts to become a criminal. Things don't go as planned, but the results are very funny.I am not a huge fan of big hollywood type films, so I have lost interest in most of the films of the Wilson brothers, but this one shows brilliance when they were unknown.A very intelligent, funny film.  It is not a slapstick comedy, so don't rent it if you are expecting ""Tommy Boy"" or ""Happy Gilmore"". If you like quirky comedies, comedies that make you think, in the vein of ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""A Mighty Wind"" or ""Rushmore"", then this is a perfect fit for you; buy it.

The two sit and chat and they are so relaxed with one another you eventually feel you are just sitting there with them watching the film. Several times i wished i could just chime in and add my two cents to the mix. Sometimes I feel filmmakers need a fans perspective to add to the depth these commentaries have. Now with every film getting a commentary many get lost in the mix.

15797,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,0767821408,Cecily Champagne,"[7, 7]","This is a movie that some people will find boring and that some people will find very very funny.  I am part of the latter group.Essentially, `Bottle Rocket' is about 3 young men.  1.) Anthony (Luke Wilson) - a somewhat caring, laid back and under-motivated dude.  2.)  His pal Dignan (Owen Wilson) - an extremely motivated - albeit misguided  - and overly energetic guy, who is perhaps a little clueless. And 3.) Bob - a guy who always wears Reservoir Dog-esque suits; Bob seems frequently annoyed by Dignan's antics but puts up with him because he is kind of lonely.The plot of this movie is really not that important, and I fear that a too thorough description might be misleading.  Yes - the film revolves around the three friends' attempts at small crimes, but this is not a slap-stick comedy about burglaries gone awry (even though they are entirely inept and even though the burglaries are extraordinarily funny).  Rather, this is a very dry comedy that thrives on dialogue (vs. physical humor).  If you've seen writer/director Wes Anderson's other films (such as `Rushmore' and `The Royal Tenenbaums'), you know what I mean.This movie is one of my all-time favorite comedies (and my favorite of the Anderson films) for two reasons.1.  The characters are entirely likeable.  They're doofuses, but they are really sweet.  It's impossible not to root for them.  For instance, when they rob a local bookstore, they don't blast into it like a bunch of tough guys.  They are bumbling and apologetic - and yet, as giddy as can be.  I mean - they're really excited to be hanging out with each other and to be pulling off this heist.  It's almost like a bonding experience for them.  And this is the tone throughout the film.  Despite disagreements, they really care for each other.  Their playfulness (and quasi-innocence) is accentuated by the lighthearted soundtrack (which is also excellent).2.  The delivery in this film could not be more subtle.  Let's contrast the humor in `Bottle Rocket' with the sort of humor exhibited by other contemporary comedians.  Take Will Farrell.  When he delivers a funny line, he's usually half naked, his eyes are bulging out of his head, and he shouts it at the top of his lungs so that everyone can hear him.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Will Farrell.  I mean, I personally don't find him that funny, but I know a lot of people who do.  I just want to use him as a point of contrast.  Now take this scene from `Bottle Rocket' and compare:Dignan is in a ridiculous yellow jumpsuit on some sort of rundown moped and is talking to Anthony.  Bob's macho and not-so-nice older brother - Future Man - pulls up in a jeep and mocks Dignan's attire.  After Future Man drives away, Dignan is feeling pretty hurt.  Anthony tries to make him feel better and says something to the effect of, ""Come on, man.  Did you see what he was wearing?"" (Future man had on a waspy, pastel colored polo shirt.)  Dignan replies under his breath (I didn't even catch the line the first time I saw this movie) and in all seriousness, ""Yeah.  It was pretty cool...""  This is the sort of comedy I love.  It's not in-your-face.  It's barely on the radar.  If subtle humor likewise appeals to you, then chances are you will love `Bottle Rocket.'  Worth noting, for those of you who have seen `Royal Tenenbaums' and are expecting something more or less identical - `Bottle Rocket' is in the same vein of comedy - but is definitely more subtle and less ""colorful.""  I just want to warn you so that your expectations don't cloud your appreciation of this hilarious film.",5,a real gem,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,3593,"['movie', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'am', 'part', 'latter', 'group.Essentially', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', '3', 'young', 'men', '1', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'somewhat', 'caring', 'laid', 'back', 'under-motivated', 'dude', '2', 'pal', 'Dignan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'extremely', 'motivated', 'albeit', 'misguided', 'overly', 'energetic', 'guy', 'who', 'perhaps', 'little', 'clueless', '3', 'Bob', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'Reservoir', 'Dog-esque', 'suits', 'Bob', 'frequently', 'annoyed', 'Dignan', 'antics', 'up', 'kind', 'lonely.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'important', 'fear', 'too', 'thorough', 'description', 'might', 'be', 'misleading', 'Yes', 'film', 'three', 'friends', 'attempts', 'small', 'crimes', 'not', 'slap-stick', 'comedy', 'burglaries', 'gone', 'awry', 'even', 'are', 'entirely', 'inept', 'even', 'burglaries', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'funny', 'Rather', 'very', 'dry', 'comedy', 'dialogue', 'vs.', 'physical', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'writer/director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'know', 'what', 'mean.This', 'movie', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'favorite', 'Anderson', 'films', 'two', 'reasons.1', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'likeable', ""'re"", 'doofuses', 'are', 'really', 'sweet', 'impossible', 'not', 'root', 'instance', 'when', 'rob', 'local', 'bookstore', 'do', ""n't"", 'blast', 'bunch', 'tough', 'guys', 'are', 'bumbling', 'apologetic', 'yet', 'as', 'giddy', 'can', 'be', 'mean', ""'re"", 'really', 'excited', 'be', 'hanging', 'other', 'be', 'pulling', 'off', 'heist', 'almost', 'bonding', 'experience', 'tone', 'film', 'disagreements', 'really', 'care', 'other', 'playfulness', 'quasi-innocence', 'accentuated', 'lighthearted', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'excellent', '.2', 'delivery', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'subtle', 'Let', 'contrast', 'humor', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'sort', 'humor', 'exhibited', 'other', 'contemporary', 'comedians', 'Take', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'When', 'funny', 'line', 'usually', 'half', 'naked', 'eyes', 'are', 'bulging', 'head', 'top', 'lungs', 'everyone', 'can', 'hear', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'mean', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'want', 'use', 'point', 'contrast', 'Now', 'take', 'scene', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'compare', 'Dignan', 'ridiculous', 'yellow', 'jumpsuit', 'sort', 'rundown', 'moped', 'talking', 'Anthony', 'Bob', 'macho', 'not-so-nice', 'older', 'brother', 'Future', 'Man', 'up', 'jeep', 'mocks', 'Dignan', 'attire', 'Future', 'Man', 'away', 'Dignan', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'hurt', 'Anthony', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'something', 'effect', 'Come', 'man', 'Did', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'wearing', 'Future', 'man', 'had', 'waspy', 'pastel', 'colored', 'polo', 'shirt', 'Dignan', 'replies', 'breath', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'catch', 'line', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'seriousness', 'Yeah', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sort', 'comedy', 'love', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'barely', 'radar', 'subtle', 'humor', 'likewise', 'appeals', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'love', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Worth', 'noting', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'less', 'identical', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'same', 'vein', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'more', 'subtle', 'less', 'colorful', 'just', 'want', 'warn', 'so', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'cloud', 'appreciation', 'hilarious', 'film']",Bottle Rocket

15799,A1YWUPCT83WY48,0767821408,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[60, 61]","Released in 1996, this is Wes Anderson's first feature movie and the beginning of a great career that has also included the fantastic quirky comedy-dramas &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums.&quot; &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; isn't the equal of those films, but it is a great start to Anderson's career, and a fine little comedy. It also marked the beginning of the stardom of Owen Wilson, who co-wrote the script with Anderson and plays the most noticeable and memorable part. The film was shot in Texas, Anderson and Wilson's home state, based on a short film they had made two years earlier.The movie has the type of laid-back and character-driven humor that won't appeal to everyone. This is comedy that doesn't target laughs or build up elaborate set-ups as most comedies do. Instead, the humor is continuously slow-pitched to you in the form of weird but likeable characters, off-center attitudes, and situations that seem familiar to us but are played in unreal ways and thus become extremely funny. All together, it's an extraordinarily enjoyable and pleasant movie that strolls through its story with no particular rush.Owen's brother Luke Wilson, who had so far appeared in every Wes Anderson film, plays Anthony Adams, who gets out of a voluntary mental hospital after recuperating from a breakdown. His friend Dignan (Owen Wilson) has big plans for both of them -- a life of easy and enjoyable crime! Dignan doesn't have any good ideas, but tries to make up for it with endless enthusiasm and an outrageously optimistic view of life. Unfortunately, when things inevitably don't go well for him and his friends start criticizing him, he can fall into pretty bitter depressions. Owen Wilson has the character nailed down, and Dignan sets the tone for most of Wilson's other characters: the enthusiastic but misguided nut. Dignan gets his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) in on his plan to pull a 'job' (and all of Dignan's 'jobs' are minor-league suburban affairs) that will attract the attention of the local crime boss/landscaper, Mr. Henry (James Caan in a brief but darned funny performance). Dignan get obsessed with his planning and attempts at damage control, while Anthony and Bob are more busy with the really important things in their lives: Anthony falls for a housekeeper at a motel (Lumi Cavazos, from &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;), and Bob tries to deal with his bully of a brother, Future Man (Andrew Wilson -- yep, another Wilson).The film has some sad and serious moments -- after all, these are characters who are really going NOWHERE in a very boring suburban landscape -- but with Dignan around it never stays down for long. There are plenty of chuckles and some real moments of howling laughter, especially during the climatic 'take down' (and I'm really using that term pretty loosely). Another Wes Anderson favorite actor, Kumar Pallana, who appeared as Pagoda in &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums,&quot; is on-hand to add comedy as a safe-cracker (and again, I'm really using that term loosely).If you like quirky, odd, but realistic comedy, and if you've enjoyed Owen Wilson in many of his later performances, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is really worth a look.(This DVD is, unfortunately, nothing special.

15800,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,0767821408,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[2, 2]","I have purchased and viewed all of Wes Anderson's films in the past month or so and I have got to say that I am thoroughly impressed. Rushmore, probably his most popular and acclaimed film, is an interesting story focusing on one character (very uncharacteristic of Anderson), Max Fischer. The Royal Tenenbaums, in my opinion, is TECHNICALLY his best achievement to date. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited were both solid entries that I thought were great despite a lack of a certain something (still trying to figure it out). Fantastic Mr. Fox was an extremely well done stop-motion film adapting a story from Roald Dahl. My FAVORITE however is his debut film, Bottle Rocket.I have now seen Bottle Rocket three times (in the past like 2 months) and on the third viewing, I decided to take some notes. What resulted was a 13-page in depth analysis of the themes and threads pumping through the heart of the film. My favorite aspect of Bottle Rocket is the character development. The character, Dignan, I believe is the most completely realized character of any of Wes' films and possibly the most tragic. Loneliness is the most prominent theme in the film, Dignan being the vehicle for the theme. Through my intense note taking, I was able to find some things that some people may not have picked up on.Observations: After *successfully* breaking Anthony out of a voluntary hospital, Dignan and Anthony take a bus back home. On the bus, as soon as Anthony begins to talk about his emotional disturbances, Dignan switches the subject because he is uncomfortable talking about emotional problems.""You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and CRAIG."" - Dignan. The fact that Dignan uses a first name probably signifies that Craig is the step-father i.e. daddy issues.Throughout the film, Dignan tries to cultivate a relationship with his former employee Abe Henry, whom he looks up to as a father figure.Dignan recruits Anthony and Bob into his ""team"", brother figures. The film depicts Anthony's sibling and Bob's sibling, but never shows or mentions Dignan having siblings. Only child = loneliness.Dignan is very much a child trapped in the body of a control freak/army commander type guy. He throws tantrums but at the same time has the urge to be in control of every situation at all times. Anthony and Bob, unfortunately for Dignan, have a much different attitude towards their heists, theirs being more laid back and only semi-committed. Wes even shows us this through the characters haircuts. Dignan has a short hair cut and is even at one point mistaken as being in the army because of it. Anthony and Bob both have long hair that further shows their more laid back attitude. While Dignan plans out their heists to the last detail, Anthony is usually drawing while Bob is wrapped up in his brother.Also a very minute detail I picked up on was the number of the motel room they stayed in. The room number is 212. This possibly suggests that the two '2s' are Anthony (who has Inez) and Bob (who has Futureman) and the lone '1' in the middle is Dignan. Also the adress of the Lawn Wranglers headquarters is 2215. Again, the '2s' are Anthony and Bob, the '5' is the Lawn Wranglers crew, and the lone '1' is again, Dignan.""He thought he had a team, turns out to be a man alone. Now, that's tough now. Real tough."" - Mr. Henry speaking of Dignan. This totally captures Dignan up to that point in the movie and really foreshadows what happens during the final heist where he is let down by his entire crew and in turn is the only one who is punished for the 'attempted' crime.The ending is very bittersweet. On one hand, Dignan is in jail but on the other, it seems like he is growing up. He makes belt buckles while in prison and tells Anthony and Bob that they could give them to Mr. Henry (who totally used Dignan to get closer to Bob and ultimately robs his house) and Apple Jack (who was caught at the scene but the charges were dropped because of his medical condition). He also jokes to Bob and Anthony about an escape plan which shows that he has accepted his fate. This is truly a coming of age story.I could continue to go on about the analysis (and trust me, I COULD), but I want to touch on other areas of the film. First of all, the acting is absolutely spectacular. Owen Wilson's portrayal as Dignan is one of the most 'real' performances I have ever seen. It definitely helps that he co-wrote it with Anderson. Luke Wilson was also great as Anthony. There is one scene that really shows his talent. It is when he and Dignan are stuck on the side of the road after their car breaks down and Dignan refers to Inez as the ""housekeeper"". The look in Luke's eyes after he says that is actually kind of chilling. That takes skill. Robert Musgrave was definitely well suited for Bob and his performance is definitely on par with Owen and Luke but he was just given less material to work with than them. James Caan gives a very unique performance as Abe Henry. It was an odd but effective choice. AND YOU CAN'T FORGET KUMAR! Nothing makes me laugh more than when Dignan walks in on Kumar sitting on a couch while he should be cracking a safe.Style wise, this is probably Wes Anderson's least ""Wes Anderson"" film. After Bottle Rocket, he really defined his style and stuck with it for the rest of his career. The cinematography by Robert Yeoman is simply superb and he manages to craft some stunningly beautiful shots. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is indeed effective while the choice of already recorded music by Anderson is great. I found that ""Seven and Seven is"" by Love and ""2000 Man"" by The Rolling Stones define the scenes that they are played in and Anderson continued to burn scenes into our memories through his use of music in the rest of his films.Making a long story short (too late), Bottle Rocket is in my top 10 films of all time. All the characters are just so rich and fleshed out that I find it irresistible to come back and continue to watch and enjoy there little quirks and mannerisms. I just find it amazing that all of the newcomers (Wes, Owen, Luke, and Bob Musgrave) met each other (obviously Owen and Luke didn't meet up, haha), created this masterwork, and now are all famous and successful (not so much Bob). This film gets my absolute highest recommendation if you have yet to see it. I urge you to watch it multiple times though so you can really catch the genius and depth of the characters. Also, check out Wes Anderson's other movies, especially The Royal Tenenbaums, which also delves deep into it's characters and is considered by many to be a near masterpiece.On a final note, I also CANNOT WAIT for Moonrise Kingdom to come to my town. When I found out that it was initially only being released in New York and Los Angeles, I almost lost it. I have since cooled down and decided to appreciate the films I already have by him to their fullest before worrying about Moonrise Kingdom.Thank you for your time.",5,In My Top Ten Movies of All

The wait is finally over.Disc one starts things off with an audio commentary by director/co-writer Wes Anderson and actor/co-writer Owen Wilson. They touch upon which scenes from the original short film survived into the feature. They also point out the re-shoots done after a disastrous test screening. Anderson and Wilson talk about how producer James L. Brooks helped them get Bottle Rocket made and taught them about screenwriting. It's great to hear these two long-time friends talk about their first film.On disc two there is ""The Making of Bottle Rocket,"" a 25-minute retrospective featurette that brings back key cast and crew members as they reflect on how the film came together and what they think of it now. There is footage from the short film and outtakes from the feature film. One gets the impression that James L. Brooks really mentored Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.

One can see the core ingredients of what would become feature film.Also included are a collection of deleted scenes that include the source of Future Man's name but mostly there are several scenes between Anthony, Bob and Dignan.

He compares it to films from the 1950s and talks about his favourite scenes.""Anamorphic Test,"" Originally, Anderson planned to shoot the film in the widescreen Panavision format and shot a test scene that actually looks really good. It's too bad that they didn't go that way.Finally, there is a collection of photographs by Laura Wilson, the Wilson brothers' mother. We see Anderson and the Wilsons planning the short film in 1992.

15803,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767821408,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Low-key, deadpan humor is the name of the game in this quirky comedy that is chock full of Wilson brothers.  Owen wrote and starred in the film alongside brother Luke, and yet another Wilson brother plays a small role as their buddy's brother.  Bottle Rocket is definitely a quirky little film, and its humor won't appeal to everyone.  Inevitably, you'll either enjoy it or wonder why such a nothing story was ever made into a film.  By this point, I have to come to terms with the fact that I am actually an Owen Wilson fan; I can't help it - the man's just extremely funny.The story centers around Anthony (Luke Wilson), who just got out of a voluntary mental hospital, and his one-of-a-kind buddy Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Dignan has big plans; in fact, he has the next fifty years charted out.  This master plan of his calls for Dignan and Anthony to pull a few burglary jobs and thus impress the local landscaper (I mean, criminal mastermind) Mr. Henry (James Caan) so much that he makes them part of his crew.  Dignan obsessively maps out each facet of his plans, treating them as daring capers of great importance, but Anthony and his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) tend to get distracted rather easily.  The first job, a little after-hours bookstore robbery, sort of succeeds despite itself, and the trio goes on the lamb until the supposed heat is off, holing up in a cheap motel out in the middle of nowhere.  Here's where things start falling apart, at least insofar as Dignan is concerned.  Bob's all worried about his brother having been arrested for the pot that Bob was growing in his own backyard, while Anthony falls in a rather pathetic - but awfully sweet -  kind of love with Inez the housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos) - despite her limited knowledge of English.  Everyone goes his separate way, basically, but the gang comes back together in order to pull their most ambitious (and, of course, wildly unsuccessful) heist yet.  There's not a great deal of story resolution at the end, but that's okay; the film's ambiguity is actually one of its strengths.Bottle Rocket is a decidedly quirky film, but the characters of Dignan and Anthony really grow on you.  Poor Dignan, despite all of his big plans and enthusiasm, is really just a loser going nowhere, while Anthony basically just wants the world to slow down to his low-key pace and to be reunited with Inez.  The whole film thrives on a fairly intellectual brand of comedy - no toilet humor, outrageous pratfalls, or low-brow, course jokes to generate cheap laughs.  Sure, the movie is sort of stupid, but the comedy certainly isn't.  Basically, you either get Bottle Rocket or you don't.  That's probably one of the reasons that the film has never managed to generate a giant blip on the radar screens of movie viewers - and that's too bad because Bottle Rocket really is a funny little oddball of a film.",4,"A strangely compelling, wonderfully quirky little comedy",1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,2870,"['Low-key', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'name', 'game', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'chock', 'full', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'Owen', 'wrote', 'starred', 'film', 'brother', 'Luke', 'yet', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'small', 'role', 'buddy', 'brother', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'definitely', 'quirky', 'little', 'film', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'Inevitably', ""'ll"", 'either', 'enjoy', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'nothing', 'story', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'point', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'am', 'actually', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'man', 'just', 'extremely', 'funny.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'out', 'voluntary', 'mental', 'hospital', 'one-of-a-kind', 'buddy', 'Dignan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Dignan', 'big', 'plans', 'fact', 'next', 'fifty', 'years', 'charted', 'out', 'master', 'plan', 'calls', 'Dignan', 'Anthony', 'pull', 'few', 'burglary', 'jobs', 'thus', 'impress', 'local', 'landscaper', 'mean', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Mr.', 'Henry', 'James', 'Caan', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'crew', 'Dignan', 'obsessively', 'out', 'facet', 'plans', 'treating', 'daring', 'capers', 'great', 'importance', 'Anthony', 'friend', 'Bob', 'Robert', 'Musgrave', 'tend', 'get', 'distracted', 'rather', 'easily', 'first', 'job', 'little', 'after-hours', 'bookstore', 'robbery', 'sort', 'trio', 'lamb', 'supposed', 'heat', 'holing', 'up', 'cheap', 'motel', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Here', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'falling', 'apart', 'least', 'insofar', 'Dignan', 'concerned', 'Bob', 'worried', 'brother', 'having', 'been', 'arrested', 'pot', 'Bob', 'was', 'growing', 'own', 'backyard', 'Anthony', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'awfully', 'sweet', 'kind', 'love', 'Inez', 'housekeeper', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'English', 'Everyone', 'separate', 'way', 'basically', 'gang', 'back', 'together', 'order', 'pull', 'most', 'ambitious', 'course', 'wildly', 'unsuccessful', 'heist', 'yet', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'story', 'resolution', 'end', 'okay', 'film', 'ambiguity', 'actually', 'one', 'strengths.Bottle', 'Rocket', 'decidedly', 'quirky', 'film', 'characters', 'Dignan', 'Anthony', 'really', 'grow', 'Poor', 'Dignan', 'big', 'plans', 'enthusiasm', 'really', 'just', 'loser', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Anthony', 'basically', 'just', 'world', 'slow', 'down', 'low-key', 'pace', 'be', 'reunited', 'Inez', 'whole', 'film', 'thrives', 'fairly', 'intellectual', 'brand', 'comedy', 'toilet', 'humor', 'outrageous', 'pratfalls', 'low-brow', 'course', 'jokes', 'generate', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'Sure', 'movie', 'sort', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Basically', 'either', 'get', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'do', ""n't"", 'probably', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'never', 'managed', 'generate', 'giant', 'blip', 'radar', 'screens', 'movie', 'viewers', 'too', 'bad', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'really', 'funny', 'little', 'oddball', 'film']",Bottle Rocket

15805,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,0767821408,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 2]","As its title indicates, 'Bottle Rocket' is a desperately sad comedy about confinement and the reach for liberation.  Framed by men incarcerated in institutions accompanied by friends, the film switches expertly between perspectives and patterns - from wide country spaces to cramped interiors whose very shapes seem to offer yet another wall to kick against; from hope-fuelled plans to inept executions; from the need to settle down to the desire to escape; from children to adults, friends to lovers, play to work; from comedy to tragedy, the ideal to real, fireworks to damp squibs, trust to lies, innocence to experience.  And, for genius director Wes Anderson, from the limitations of genre, to the messy, vibrant open-endedness of emotional experience.If the characters in 'Bottle Rocket' were children, the whole thing would seem a lark.  A young man, Anthony, is released from a mental hospital, where he was rocovering from 'exhaustion'; he is met by his high-wired friend Dignan, who bombards him with blueprints for the next 50 years of their lives.  They plan a heist on a book store, bringing in a rich friend, car-owning Bob, frequent victim of his beefy older brother's bullying.  This is intended to impress the Kafkaesque figure of Mr. Henry, a landscape-gardener-...-ganglord.  They cross states 'on the lam' for a while, where Anthony falls in love with Inez, a cleaner from Paraguay with little English.  Bob, his brother arrested for drug-dealing, goes back with the car.  Frustrated by failed love and broken dreams, Anthony and Dignan have a fight, Anthony returning home to relative normality.  Then Dignan turns up in a yellow boiler-suit, with the big plan that's going to turn their lives...The film is full of play, silliness, mucking about, kids pretending they're big men, their failures eliciting laughter and sympathy.  Anderson's fluid but fidgety style, true to the needs of his story, but employing all manner of stylistic variations, approximates his young heroes' vitality, imagination and restlessness, while the family intimacy of cast and crew spills into the performances.  Because these aren't kids, though, because their lives are slipping away, because their dreams far outstrip their means, the larks stop being funny.  The true hero of the film is not the compromising Anthony, through whose developing eyes we watch it (the nocturnal, neon-pool love scene at the motel is a hymn to quiet rapture, quickly intruded on by his friend), but Dignan, a man out of time (and, let's be honest, mind), a man with ambition, big ideas in a little land, a straw target easily unstuffed by burly policemen; a man who needs space, confined.Although it wasn't especially noticed at the time, 'Bottle Rocket' now looks set to join 'Citzen Kane', 'They Live By Night' and 'Badlands' as one of the great American debuts.  It has the spaciousness, generosity, inbuilt mystery, feel for America and stylistic depth that could see it grow.",4,The beginning of a great adventure.,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2964,"['title', 'Rocket', 'desperately', 'sad', 'comedy', 'confinement', 'reach', 'liberation', 'Framed', 'men', 'incarcerated', 'institutions', 'accompanied', 'friends', 'film', 'expertly', 'perspectives', 'patterns', 'wide', 'country', 'spaces', 'cramped', 'interiors', 'very', 'seem', 'offer', 'yet', 'wall', 'kick', 'hope-fuelled', 'plans', 'inept', 'executions', 'need', 'settle', 'down', 'desire', 'escape', 'children', 'adults', 'friends', 'lovers', 'play', 'work', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'ideal', 'real', 'fireworks', 'damp', 'squibs', 'trust', 'lies', 'innocence', 'experience', 'genius', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'limitations', 'genre', 'messy', 'vibrant', 'open-endedness', 'emotional', 'experience.If', 'characters', ""'Bottle"", 'Rocket', 'were', 'children', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'seem', 'lark', 'young', 'man', 'Anthony', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'was', 'rocovering', ""'exhaustion"", 'met', 'high-wired', 'friend', 'Dignan', 'who', 'bombards', 'blueprints', 'next', '50', 'years', 'lives', 'plan', 'heist', 'book', 'store', 'bringing', 'rich', 'friend', 'car-owning', 'Bob', 'frequent', 'victim', 'beefy', 'brother', 'bullying', 'intended', 'impress', 'Kafkaesque', 'figure', 'Mr.', 'Henry', 'landscape-gardener-', '-ganglord', 'cross', 'states', ""'on"", 'lam', 'while', 'where', 'Anthony', 'love', 'Inez', 'cleaner', 'Paraguay', 'little', 'English', 'Bob', 'brother', 'arrested', 'drug-dealing', 'back', 'car', 'Frustrated', 'failed', 'love', 'broken', 'dreams', 'Anthony', 'Dignan', 'have', 'fight', 'Anthony', 'returning', 'home', 'relative', 'normality', 'Then', 'Dignan', 'up', 'yellow', 'boiler-suit', 'big', 'plan', 'going', 'turn', 'lives', 'film', 'full', 'play', 'silliness', 'mucking', 'kids', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'big', 'men', 'failures', 'eliciting', 'laughter', 'sympathy', 'Anderson', 'fluid', 'fidgety', 'style', 'true', 'needs', 'story', 'employing', 'manner', 'stylistic', 'variations', 'young', 'heroes', 'vitality', 'imagination', 'restlessness', 'family', 'intimacy', 'cast', 'crew', 'spills', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'kids', 'though', 'lives', 'are', 'slipping', 'away', 'dreams', 'far', 'outstrip', 'means', 'larks', 'stop', 'being', 'funny', 'true', 'hero', 'film', 'not', 'compromising', 'Anthony', 'developing', 'watch', 'nocturnal', 'neon-pool', 'love', 'scene', 'motel', 'hymn', 'quiet', 'rapture', 'quickly', 'intruded', 'friend', 'Dignan', 'man', 'time', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'mind', 'man', 'ambition', 'big', 'ideas', 'little', 'land', 'straw', 'target', 'easily', 'unstuffed', 'burly', 'policemen', 'man', 'who', 'space', 'was', ""n't"", 'especially', 'noticed', 'time', 'Rocket', 'now', 'set', 'join', ""'Citzen"", 'Kane', 'Live', 'Night', ""'Badlands"", 'one', 'great', 'American', 'debuts', 'spaciousness', 'generosity', 'inbuilt', 'mystery', 'feel', 'America', 'stylistic', 'depth', 'could', 'see', 'grow']",Bottle Rocket

15809,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767821408,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[17, 19]","""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is most definitely a hilarious but yet an insanely awkward film that just sticks in your head because of how wild and crazy it is.Released in 1996, the film would be the directorial debut for Wes Anderson (""RUSHMORE"", ""THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS"", ""Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou"") and the debut of the Wilson brothers: Owen Wilson (Co-writer) and Luke Wilson (plus brother Andrew) and Robert Musgrave who all grew up together in Texas.Back in 1992, the first initial concept of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" was shot in 16mm film on B&W; after the group was able to raise about $4,000 and raise more money and eventually have the 13 minutes extra to have a short film and submit it to the Sundance Film Festival in 1994.After being screened for the festival, the film was able to attract a few producers who were willing to invest in making ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" to a full-length film and thus, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson had their first major opportunity.As the story goes, the film did terrible in its first test screening which shocked everyone.  The film then had its final released cut which then was released in theaters in 1996 and the film bombed.  In fact, to everyone's surprie, the film couldn't even get screened at Sundance (where the short film version was able to be screened years prior).But there were many people who loved the film and for critics, it was a critically acclaimed film that some critics were quite passionate about such as  the LA Times (blasting Sundance Film Festival for not screening it) and then followed by director Martin Scorsese calling it one of his favorite films in the 1990's, the film reached cult-status.Flash forward 12 years later and with three of Wes Anderson's films released on THE CRITERION COLLECTION on DVD, what an awesome way to kick off THE CRITERION COLLECTION's entry to Blu-ray in Dec. 2008 with the release of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", Anderson's first film.VIDEO & AUDIO:THE CRITERION COLLECTION is all about gathering the greatest films around the world and publish them in the highest technical quality but the focus is to present the film the way the original director intended.  For film fans, THE CRITERION COLLECTION is known for its quality and rarely do fans question the releases, the releases are embraced as fans are introduced to important classics or contemporary films.For ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film is presented in its original aspect ration of 1:85:1.  The film's presentation was supervised and approved by Wes Anderson and the Director of Photography Robert Yeoman.  The high definition transfer was scanned on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35mm interpositive and thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Resotration System and Pixel Farm's PFClean.The video quality of this film looks great especially for a film created in the early to mid-90's.  Typically films released on Blu-ray during these years have been clean but have this softness effect where the vibrancy of the colors are not as beautiful as I would like it to be.  With ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film had many outdoor scenes and literally from the red's to the blues and greens and the yellow jumpsuit that the guys wear, these colors are vibrant in Blu-ray HD.As for audio, audio was mastered at 24-bit from the original magnetic tracks and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The film is primarily a dialogue based film, thus a lot of the audio is coming from your front channel speakers.  There are scenes with gunshots and music that come out quite live on your home theater channels but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.SPECIAL FEATURES:For the special features, the following are included:* AUDIO COMMENTARY -  A commentary featuring Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  The commentary is not more on the filmmaking perspective but more of nostalgia as the guys talk about memories of people they worked with, areas they shot and how some of the people on the crew have moved on to bigger things.* THE MAKING OF ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" - A featurette with interviews with Wes Anderson, the Owens brothers, James Caan, Kumar Pallana, the producers and more.  You learn a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the film from creating the short film, Sundance, how the test screening was a bomb, how the film was not a commercial success but became a cult hit and much more.  Great insight on the actors about being part of the job, how they were able to get James Caan for the film and how the producers felt about the talent at the time.  A fun and informative documentary by filmmaker Barry Braverman.* The Bottle Rocket Shorts - The actual 13-minute B&W; short film that was created back in 1992.* Storyboards - Wes Anderson's original storyboards and sketches for the film.* Anamorphic Test - Anamorphic test shots of several scenes from the film and how Anderson originally planned to shoot the film in widescreen Panavision.  Test shots.* ""The Shafrazi Lectures, No. 1 Bottle Rocket"" - A guy who is reviewing the film and talking about why he loved it.* ""Murita Cycles"" - A Short film created Barry Braverman (friend and collaborator for Anderson and the Wilson family) about his father, a Staten Island bicycle shop owner which inspired the guys to create ""BOTTLE ROCKET"".* Behind-the-Scenes Photograps by Laura Wilson - The Wilson brothers also had a talented mother who is a photographer that took pictures of Wes, Owen and Luke during the planning stages of the film and also at Sundance.* Deleted Scenes - There were a quite a number of scenes that were cut and eleven featured on the disc.  Scenes that would have explained how ""Futureman"" got his name, what Dignan and Applejack were up to when they went to by Bob's place, another scene of how the pot was found in Bob's home and much, much more.Also included is a booklet that features an appreciation by director Martin Scorsese (which is a tribute that appeared in the March 2000 issue of ESQUIRE Magazine), an essay book by executive producer James L. Brooks (written as an introduction to the ""RUSHMORE"" screenplay published in 1999) which really goes into detail of how ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" was created and things that happened behind-the-scenes not mentioned on the special features  and artwork by Ian Dingman.JUDGMENT CALL:""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is just an amazing, awkward and hilarious film.  Forget about the ""Oceans #"" type of films that try to bring comedy to heist films, BOTTLE ROCKET"" was special because it came from these young people who were not known at the time but their vision of filmmaking and storytelling just sticks into your mind.You know that feeling about pulling a prank that got a lot of laughs during your younger years and you remember it to this day.  This is how I felt about certain scenes from ""BOTTLE ROCKET"".  There were a lot of humor that was not meant to be taken in as a joke but for these characters of Dignan, Anthony and Bob, you can't help but be entertained and laugh.From memorable scenes of the group putting tape on top of their noses before their heist, to how rob the bookstore but at the same time, those being held hostage just look at them as non-dangerous and almost humorous (despite Dignan carrying a gun).And then scenes of love as Anthony falls for this woman who can't speak any English and goes where she goes as she cleans each hotel room and just falls in love.  And his far out drawings of his love for Inez.And also the team assembled by Dignan for their major heist.  One would think, why he would select really old men (especially one who had some major memory loss issues) to bring with him for a major robbery?  But you realize it's Dignan and you just accept his approach to pulling of a heist and enjoy the ride.There are many of these  moments in the film that you just think back and just be amazed of how much of those type of scenes were included.  Wes Anderson and Owen Williams are just an amazing duo and although at the time, they were not known in the industry, it just showed you how much potential these guys had when they first emerged and eventually they would go on to have successful careers making many more films together.As for the Blu-ray disc, again, THE CRITERION COLLECTION manages to pull of another wonderful release.  Wonderful picture quality that is vibrant in colors and again, I've reviewed many major films released in the early and mid-90's and although cleaned up, never have the vibrancy or sharpness but this softness that always bugged me.  This was not the case of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film looks great!And the amount of special features and also the booklet that really help enhance one's appreciation for the film.  You wouldn't expect anything less from CRITERION and sure enough, they delivered.""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is a fun, hilarious and well-written film that is so different from any film that has come out.  It's not a moronic film, nor is it a serious heist film.  It's just a film that is just all-out fun and one can understand why it has become a popular cult film.Highly recommended!",5,"How a test screening failure, commercially unsuccesful film became one of

15811,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0767821408,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Taking a trip into Wes Anderson's head is like going into a parallel universe where most things are the same, but the nature of reality is just slightly warped.And while the world of ""Bottle Rocket"" -- Anderson's first collaboration with actor Owen Wilson -- is a little rough around the edges, the absurdist crime caper is a jewel. And while it sounds like yet another goofy comedy, Anderson's signature quirkiness is already in place -- a heavy dose of his dry, erratic, clever wit and some lovable misfit characters.After being treated for exhaustion (""You haven't worked a day in your life. How could you be exhausted?""), Anthony (Luke Wilson) has just been released from a voluntary mental hospital.His ""rescuer"" is his idealistically weird pal Dignan (Owen Wilson), who has decided to become a master criminal. To this end, he has created an elaborate 75-year plan of theft and heists. You can guess where that's going to take them. After an absurd first heist, they recruit the timid Bob (Bob Musgrave) as the getaway driver, as he is the only one who has a car.And so the odd little trio practice for a while on smaller-time burglaries, such as robbing a bookstore and Anthony's own house -- then hiding out at a motel, where Anthony falls in love with the pretty South-American maid (Lumi Cavazos). However, the guys find themselves in hot water when they bump into a REAL master criminal (James Caan), and Bob bails out on them. The hot water is rising.Comedic crime caper movies are hard to make, because of the need for balance between the criminal activities and the comedy... without making any of it too stupid or over the top. Wes Anderson solves this dilemma by making this a caper carried off by affluent young slackers who could easily do stuff other than thieving their way through life. And that's half of ""Bottle Rocket's"" comedy appeal right there -- the unlikely criminals.The other half is handling humor that would be stupid and forgettable in another auteur's hands. Wes Anderson's uniquely quirky touch is a little rough in his full-length debut, but it's that slightly unpolished touch that makes his offbeat style such a delight here -- as an example, Anthony ""escapes"" from a hospital that he can leave anytime he wants. That unnecessarily complex opener sets the tone of the rest of the movie, of thrill-seeking young men who are just a little out of sync with the rest of the world.And ""Bottle Rocket"" shares the dry, funny, erratic humor of Anderson's later movies, albeit in a slightly more energetic manner (""Here are just a few of the key ingredients: dynamite, pole vaulting, laughing gas, choppers..."" Dignan explains). And the scripting is peppered with a thousand funny little lines (""Which part of Mexico are you from?"" ""Paraguay""). Anderson and Wilson avoid being self-consciously cool, in favor of being earnestly quirky.And the Wilson brothers -- Owen and Luke both -- are in fine form here as the Odd Couplish friends, especially when interacting with one another. Anthony is calmer, more laid-back and thinks a lot, while Dignan is idealistic and wacky almost to the point of mental illness. This pair have a certain innocence despite their illegal ambitions, and while they're goofy misfits, they're not the kind you laugh at.Since most of Wes Anderson's work has been released in a Criterion deluxe edition, it's about freaking time someone gave similarly loving care to ""Bottle Rocket."" Both the forthcoming double-disc DVD edition and the Blu-ray edition are going to have a wealth of extras for fans of Anderson's, and it's hard to imagine that there's any more it would need. Criterion has apparently not only put in everything it needs, but actually slightly more.In particular, it has newly restored picture, eleven deleted scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, actor/director commentary from Anderson and Owen Wilson, a new documentary about the making of the film, screen tests, storyboards, behind the scenes photographs, and a booklet with essay by James L. Brooks and ""appreciation"" by Martin Scorsese. As an extra bonus, it has some short films as well -- a 1970s half-hour film called ""Murita Cycles"" about a bicycle repairman/philosopher, and the 1994 short film ""Bottle Rocket"" that served as the basis for the full-length one.""Bottle Rocket"" is a bit erratic and rough around the edges, but it's also fresh, weird and delightfully zany. Anderson should try his hand at this sort of stuff again, because he has a rare talent for such films.",5,Rocket away,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,4515,"['Taking', 'trip', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'head', 'going', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'most', 'things', 'are', 'same', 'nature', 'reality', 'just', 'slightly', 'warped.And', 'world', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Anderson', 'first', 'collaboration', 'actor', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'absurdist', 'crime', 'caper', 'jewel', 'like', 'yet', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'Anderson', 'signature', 'quirkiness', 'already', 'place', 'heavy', 'dose', 'dry', 'erratic', 'clever', 'wit', 'lovable', 'misfit', 'characters.After', 'being', 'treated', 'exhaustion', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'day', 'life', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'exhausted', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'voluntary', 'mental', 'hospital.His', 'rescuer', 'idealistically', 'weird', 'pal', 'Dignan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'decided', 'become', 'master', 'criminal', 'end', 'created', 'elaborate', '75-year', 'plan', 'theft', 'heists', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'going', 'take', 'absurd', 'first', 'heist', 'recruit', 'timid', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'Musgrave', 'getaway', 'driver', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'car.And', 'odd', 'little', 'trio', 'practice', 'while', 'smaller-time', 'burglaries', 'such', 'robbing', 'bookstore', 'Anthony', 'own', 'house', 'then', 'hiding', 'out', 'motel', 'where', 'Anthony', 'love', 'pretty', 'South-American', 'maid', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'However', 'guys', 'find', 'hot', 'water', 'when', 'bump', 'REAL', 'master', 'criminal', 'James', 'Caan', 'Bob', 'out', 'hot', 'water', 'rising.Comedic', 'crime', 'caper', 'movies', 'are', 'hard', 'make', 'need', 'balance', 'criminal', 'activities', 'comedy', 'making', 'too', 'stupid', 'top', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'dilemma', 'making', 'caper', 'carried', 'off', 'affluent', 'young', 'slackers', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'do', 'stuff', 'other', 'thieving', 'way', 'life', 'half', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'comedy', 'appeal', 'right', 'there', 'unlikely', 'criminals.The', 'other', 'half', 'handling', 'humor', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'forgettable', 'auteur', 'hands', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'touch', 'little', 'rough', 'full-length', 'debut', 'slightly', 'unpolished', 'touch', 'offbeat', 'style', 'delight', 'here', 'example', 'Anthony', 'escapes', 'hospital', 'can', 'leave', 'anytime', 'unnecessarily', 'complex', 'opener', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'thrill-seeking', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'sync', 'rest', 'world.And', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'shares', 'dry', 'funny', 'erratic', 'humor', 'Anderson', 'later', 'movies', 'albeit', 'slightly', 'more', 'energetic', 'manner', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'key', 'ingredients', 'dynamite', 'pole', 'vaulting', 'laughing', 'gas', 'choppers', 'Dignan', 'scripting', 'peppered', 'thousand', 'funny', 'little', 'lines', 'Which', 'part', 'Mexico', 'are', 'Paraguay', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'avoid', 'being', 'self-consciously', 'cool', 'favor', 'being', 'earnestly', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'Owen', 'Luke', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'here', 'Odd', 'Couplish', 'friends', 'especially', 'when', 'interacting', 'one', 'Anthony', 'calmer', 'more', 'laid-back', 'lot', 'Dignan', 'idealistic', 'wacky', 'almost', 'point', 'mental', 'illness', 'pair', 'have', 'certain', 'innocence', 'illegal', 'ambitions', ""'re"", 'goofy', 'misfits', ""'re"", 'not', 'kind', 'laugh', 'at.Since', 'most', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'work', 'been', 'released', 'Criterion', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'freaking', 'time', 'someone', 'gave', 'similarly', 'loving', 'care', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'forthcoming', 'double-disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'wealth', 'extras', 'fans', 'Anderson', 'hard', 'imagine', 'more', 'would', 'need', 'Criterion', 'apparently', 'not', 'only', 'put', 'everything', 'actually', 'slightly', 'more.In', 'particular', 'newly', 'restored', 'picture', 'eleven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'actor/director', 'commentary', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'new', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'screen', 'tests', 'storyboards', 'scenes', 'photographs', 'booklet', 'essay', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'appreciation', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'extra', 'bonus', 'short', 'films', 'as', 'well', '1970s', 'half-hour', 'film', 'called', 'Murita', 'Cycles', 'bicycle', 'repairman/philosopher', '1994', 'short', 'film', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'served', 'basis', 'full-length', 'one', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'bit', 'erratic', 'rough', 'edges', 'also', 'fresh', 'weird', 'delightfully', 'zany', 'Anderson', 'should', 'try', 'hand', 'sort', 'stuff', 'again', 'rare', 'talent', 'such', 'films']",Bottle Rocket
15812,ATA9L747CJ622,0767821408,Emily McB,"[1, 1]","Even if Bottle Rocket had no merits of its own, it would be worth watching to see the beginning of what I hope will be a long and lasting working relationship--that of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson (and Luke).  Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.  The drama always stops just short of heartbreaking, and the comedy just short of slapstick, leaving us only with a bunch of characters we care about, and their crazy, messed up lives.Bottle Rocket is not flawless.  I'm not sure why not, just as I'm not entirely sure why its so close to flawless.  But it has a wonderful screenplay, full of such lines as ""Bob's gone, he stole his car!"" or, in response to one characters depression that his eight year old sister thinks he's a failure, ""She thinks your a failure?  What she ever do with her life that was so great?""  The romance between main character Anthony and the Paraguayan housekeeper Inez is touching, as is the sometimes uncomfortable friendship between Anthony and the bonkers-in-a-sad-kind-of-way Dignan.  Scenes stay in your memory, like Anthony and Bob watching the retreating Dignan through a fence, or Dignan handing a sparkler to Inez.  The cast is great, from Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson (Owen is always an obvious standout, Luke is the type who you appreciate more with each film you see him in) to Robert Musgrave as the hangdog Bob and Lumi Cavazos as Inez.

This slowness takes away from the humor aspects of the movie because it drags too long.  Otherwise the humor before this portion is as charming and crass as watching I Heart Huckabees.  The build up of the movie afterward is funny in a weird way, but not too many people would probably think that Michael lusting for almost non-English speaking hotel maid Anita was funny.

BR is an offbeat crime/comedy about three friends, Dignan (Owen), Anthony (Luke), and Bob (Robert Musgrave) who tried to pursue the career of the professional criminals. If ever three screw-up characters were less suited for becoming tough guys, thieves or bank robbers, I am yet to see them on the screen. Of all three, Dignan takes the cake - his brazenness, ineptitude, clumsiness and lack of any sense of reality in the combination with the true belief that he was born to become a ""made man"" (or something like that) and that the local ""godfather"" Mr. Henry (James Caan in a very funny cameo) would take him and his friends seriously are absolutely adorable. Andrew Wilson, the oldest of three brothers has a small role as Bob's obnoxious older brother. I personally don't think that ""Bottle Rocket"" is a masterpiece and the best movie of that year but it certainly has got some very funny moments, especially in the beginning (Dignan helps Anthony to run from a mental hospital and soon they pull a job of robbing the local book store; Dignan interviews Bob for a position of a runaway driver) and in the end when three friends are sent by Mr. Henry to the biggest (and the most hilarious) heist that would be the apotheosis of their careers.

You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)This film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.Owen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E; special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.The narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.The strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.It reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity.

15831,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,0767821408,JoeyD,"[2, 2]","Wes Anderson is not for everyone.  Personally, he's my favorite modern-day director and this is my favorite of all of his films.  I fell in love with this movie right from the get-go.  The directing is so unique and the film's score by Mothersbaugh is simply brilliant.  The characters in this film (like the three other Anderson films) are all so likeable no matter how eccentric and dysfunctional they may be.  Everyone in the cast does a fantastic job, but Owen Wilson (Dignan) steals the show.  His performance in this film, in my opinion, is by far the finest work he has done to date.  It's pure comic genius, and one could easily say that this was a role that he was born to play as cliche as that may sound.  I would also have to say the same about his charming brother Luke as well (although he did an excellent job in the Royal Tennebaums too).  James Caan in a small, supporting role is absolutely hilarious on top of just being Jimmy Caan, one of the coolest cats alive!  He gives the film that extra added kick that it needs half way through when he first appears on screen.I personally love this film but like I stated earlier, it is definately not for everyone.  The humor is subtle and wry, but it's non-stop throughout the movie - you just need to pay attention!  There are so many classic lines as many of the other reviewers mentioned.  I have shown this movie to many friends of mine, some get it and love it while others look at me as if I'm from another planet.  However, I am a 'strange' dude when it comes to movies.  I usually despise Academy Award winning/nominated films (i.e. Titanic, American Beauty, etc...) or can't figure out why 'American Pie' and 'The Break Up' are considered to be so damn funny.  So then again, what do I know?  I know one thing - this movie is what movies are supposed to be - ENTERTAINING from start to finish.

15832,A1MCGG7A9G93YI,0767821408,John Galvin,"[4, 4]","Bottle Rocket is ostensibly about a pair of recently graduated high-schoolers who, through boredom or ill-ambition or the mercy of friendship, choose to initiate their early adulthood with a heist.The film begins as Anthony, played by Luke Wilson, is checking himself out of a club-med style mental institution where he has spent time for exhaustion--though this despite the fact that he has never actually worked a day in his life. He has, however, to leave the institution through a window so that his best friend Dignan, played by real-life brother Owen Wilson, may think that he has helped him to escape--though this despite the fact that Dignan hasn't actually done anything more than signal his presence with a mirror and wave to the psychiatrist whom he has mistaken for a complicitous janitor. On the bus-ride back home, Dignan shows Anthony his spiral notebook in which he has outlined their life course for the next 75 years. And they are, it seems, already behind schedule. So, to get underway and to provide themselves with a capital base, they plot the robbery of a bookstore. They also enlist the aid of another friend, Bob, played by Robert Musgrave, who will drive the car. The robbery is a success of sorts though their disguises are no disguises and their progress is impeded by the absence of bags that will hold something bigger than a paperback. Dignan is ecstatic over their success and in a fit of good fellowship proposes that Bob be given the ""Spirit Award"" for his part in the crime. They then go on the lam for a while, hiding out in a large motel on an otherwise uninhabited stretch of Texas highway. There, Anthony spies and falls in love with a member of the motel housekeeping staff, Inez, played by Lumi Cavazos. There are a variety of complications that then conspire to divide the crew, after which Anthony and Bob undertake a series of non-criminal activities such as a paper route and coaching a pee-wee soccer team, and Dignan returns to his old job at the Lawn Wranglers, which serves as a front for the larcenous activities of Mr. Henry, played by James Cahn. Anthony and Dignan eventually reconnect and, for the purposes of bolstering Dignan's self-image, Anthony joins Dignan in one last large-scale heist, meant to impress Mr. Henry. The film ends with that heist and the capture of one of its perpetrators in an act of humanity.The beauty of the film lies not in the complications or originality of the plot--but in the course of the character development. The boys are not really criminals but people pretending to enjoy what they believe are the non-material rewards of crime--a kind of life-informing cool. Which is to say, I suppose, that they are mere teenagers looking for the kind of social selves and knowing attitudes that can only really come from having lived a little longer than 18 or 19 years and at some other business than being a teenager. What's more, they have chosen a career requiring a soulessness and absence of empathy that belies their own thoroughly good-natured polity.They can't quite get the criminal patter down and have eventually to revert to ""Sir"" and ""please"" and ""I'm sorry"" before they can complete their first robbery. When one of them is later used and betrayed, he doesn't want anyone to think that there are ""any hard feelings."" And when Anthony gives away the last of the money that they have stolen, Dignan can only scream ""That's inappropriate!""--a sentiment and phrasing that are as harsh as it gets while delivered with the most profound sincerity.If you have the time and the inclination, I recommend that you go to your local video store and rent this sweet tale of a collection of courteous naives whose criminality can't quite free itself from the rules and conventions that govern good humor and civility.",4,Bottle Rocket: the non-material rewards of crime,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,3798,"['Bottle', 'Rocket', 'ostensibly', 'pair', 'recently', 'graduated', 'high-schoolers', 'who', 'boredom', 'ill-ambition', 'mercy', 'friendship', 'choose', 'initiate', 'early', 'adulthood', 'heist.The', 'film', 'Anthony', 'played', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'checking', 'club-med', 'style', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'spent', 'time', 'exhaustion', 'fact', 'never', 'actually', 'worked', 'day', 'life', 'however', 'leave', 'institution', 'window', 'best', 'friend', 'Dignan', 'played', 'real-life', 'brother', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'may', 'think', 'helped', 'escape', 'fact', 'Dignan', ""n't"", 'actually', 'done', 'anything', 'more', 'signal', 'presence', 'mirror', 'wave', 'psychiatrist', 'whom', 'mistaken', 'complicitous', 'janitor', 'bus-ride', 'back', 'home', 'Dignan', 'Anthony', 'spiral', 'notebook', 'outlined', 'life', 'course', 'next', '75', 'years', 'are', 'already', 'schedule', 'So', 'get', 'underway', 'provide', 'capital', 'base', 'plot', 'robbery', 'bookstore', 'also', 'enlist', 'aid', 'friend', 'Bob', 'played', 'Robert', 'Musgrave', 'who', 'will', 'drive', 'car', 'robbery', 'success', 'sorts', 'disguises', 'are', 'disguises', 'progress', 'impeded', 'absence', 'bags', 'will', 'hold', 'something', 'bigger', 'paperback', 'Dignan', 'ecstatic', 'success', 'fit', 'good', 'fellowship', 'Bob', 'be', 'given', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'part', 'crime', 'then', 'go', 'lam', 'while', 'hiding', 'out', 'large', 'motel', 'otherwise', 'uninhabited', 'stretch', 'Texas', 'highway', 'Anthony', 'spies', 'falls', 'love', 'member', 'motel', 'housekeeping', 'staff', 'Inez', 'played', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'are', 'variety', 'complications', 'then', 'conspire', 'divide', 'crew', 'Anthony', 'Bob', 'undertake', 'series', 'non-criminal', 'activities', 'such', 'paper', 'route', 'coaching', 'pee-wee', 'soccer', 'team', 'Dignan', 'returns', 'old', 'job', 'Lawn', 'Wranglers', 'front', 'larcenous', 'activities', 'Mr.', 'Henry', 'played', 'James', 'Cahn', 'Anthony', 'Dignan', 'eventually', 'reconnect', 'purposes', 'bolstering', 'Dignan', 'self-image', 'Anthony', 'Dignan', 'one', 'last', 'large-scale', 'heist', 'meant', 'impress', 'Mr.', 'Henry', 'film', 'heist', 'capture', 'one', 'perpetrators', 'act', 'humanity.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'not', 'complications', 'originality', 'plot', 'course', 'character', 'development', 'boys', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'criminals', 'people', 'pretending', 'enjoy', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'non-material', 'rewards', 'crime', 'kind', 'life-informing', 'cool', 'say', 'suppose', 'are', 'mere', 'teenagers', 'looking', 'kind', 'social', 'selves', 'knowing', 'attitudes', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'come', 'having', 'lived', 'little', 'longer', '18', '19', 'years', 'other', 'business', 'being', 'teenager', 'What', 'more', 'have', 'chosen', 'career', 'requiring', 'soulessness', 'absence', 'empathy', 'own', 'thoroughly', 'good-natured', 'polity.They', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'criminal', 'patter', 'down', 'have', 'eventually', 'revert', 'Sir', 'please', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'can', 'complete', 'first', 'robbery', 'When', 'one', 'later', 'used', 'betrayed', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'think', 'are', 'hard', 'feelings', 'when', 'Anthony', 'away', 'last', 'money', 'have', 'stolen', 'Dignan', 'can', 'only', 'scream', 'inappropriate', 'sentiment', 'phrasing', 'are', 'as', 'harsh', 'delivered', 'most', 'profound', 'sincerity.If', 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'recommend', 'go', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'rent', 'sweet', 'tale', 'collection', 'courteous', 'naives', 'criminality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'free', 'rules', 'conventions', 'govern', 'good', 'humor', 'civility']",Bottle Rocket

I love all of those movies, but ""Bottle Rocket"" is just so much more sincere and immediate.I sometimes wonder if the film holds the same allure for women as it does for men, just because so much of it revolves around male adolescent preoccupations (being on a ""crew"", firing guns, secret plans, fireworks).

15838,ATLZ3GS1UMK2Y,0767821408,Mandamus,"[0, 0]","BOTTLE ROCKET is an exceptionally fresh and thoroughly fun movie. I found myself smiling throughout, and not even sure why. I can't even say what kind of movie it is. For BOTTLE ROCKET defies any attempt at classification, any assault on its originality and creativity by placing it neatly in a box. It is neither a comedy nor a drama; not a love story nor a crime flick. It blends all of these genres--along with a pinch of classic Americana--into a very unique, delightful movie. Yet it is also a deliciously messy enigma: a loosely strung-together melange of brillance and childishness, high and pop art, profundity and absurdity. By the film's conclusion, I knew I had seen something special, a truly inspired and deeply personal work.BOTTLE ROCKET's power lies in its characters. They are so quirky, so unique, that they seem unmistakably real, and therefore patently likeable. They are simple people who lead quietly extraordinary and beautiful lives, people who believe in following one's dreams, chasing after true love, being individuals--and all with childlike wonder, innocence, and joie de vivre. In short, they are people of unique and genuine character. They also happen to be hysterically funny. BOTTLE ROCKET, while I would not categorically call it a comedy, is easily one of the funniest movies of the nineties. The brothers Owen and Luke Wilson give laudable (although not flawless) performances as the two principals, and they are supported admirably by some great character actors.BOTTLE ROCKET is also a beatiful picture. The photograhpy is excellent--stylish in an understated way--and this adds an element of class to an already quality piece. Almost every shot would make an excellent photograph, full of rich and subtle detail, and interesting interplay of colors, textures, and distances. BOTTLE ROCKET does not have lavish sets, nor does it take place in exotic locales. Anderson instead transforms what would otherwise be lacklustre settings like rural Texas and a cheap motel into places of almost otherworldly beauty. The lighting has a lot to do with this effect, giving the movie a very clean, bright feel--think of a J.Crew ad, only set in the rural Midwest instead of a Cape Cod beach house. The movie gives the warm, uplifting feeling of a young, free, and beautiful America, a feeling one gets at certain times reading Kerouac. The music is superb to boot, as in all Anderson's flicks, and greatly enhances the visual experience.Yet BOTTLE ROCKET falls short in its bid for perfection. For one thing, the love story, while sometimes touching, is very artifical and abstract. At times I really wanted Inez and Anthony to get together, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the forced nature of their love. Anthony instantly falls in love with the motel housekeeper, who doesn't speak a word of English because she's from Paraguay. The love-at-first-sight gimmick only works when the characters develop a fulfilling emotional bond over time, but this doesn't happen in BOTTLE ROCKET. Also, I think Anderson indulges in the 1960's motif a bit much. From the music to the sets to the hairstyles, everything reeks of the sixties--hell, even all the cars are vintage. There are points in the film where one could easily forget it was made in '96. The ending even reminded me of COOL HAND LUKE. But BOTTLE ROCKET, I've learned, is a very subjective experience and therein lies its genius, at least in part.

15845,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0767821408,Mike Stone,"[4, 4]","Early on in ""Bottle Rocket"", there's an exchange that crystallizes, for me, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's filmmaking ethos.  The scene is set at night.  Three men are sitting in their car outside a bookstore, pre-robbery.  Dignan (Owen) and Anthony (Luke Wilson) put white tape across the bridges of their noses.  Bob (Robert Musgrave), the get-away driver, innocently asks, ""Why is there tape on your nose?""  Dignan, with a devilish grin stretching from ear to ear, excitedly replies, ""Exactly!""  It's typical for Anderson/Wilson characters to not fully understand the reason for their actions (or if they do, never tell the audience), while knowing that, like sharks, if they stop moving they will die.""Bottle Rocket"" grew out of a notion that Anderson and Wilson had that their generation, so long believed to be idle and apathetic, could accomplish great things if they channeled their boundless energy.  The problem being, what did they want to accomplish?  This is no better exemplified than with Dignan.  He is a wonderful creation: a case of arrested development whose actions are completely unexpected.  Sure, you know he's going to screw up somehow, but will it be through his over-extended bravado, or just his general incompetence?  And try as you might, you just can't get a complete read on his personality.  He shows not a whit of self-awareness until the film's final scene, a genuinely surprising moment where he has enough self-awareness for ten men.It is Dignan who acts as the impetus for what is going to go down: a youthful crime operation is to be formed, with the sole intent of proving to the local crime boss (James Caan, in a role that's probably too small; still, Caan, in his brief scenes, shines) that they are ready to jump to the big leagues.  Only they aren't.  And probably never will be.  This is where most of the film's broad comedy comes from: watching Dignan and his boys try their best, and constantly fail through misguided attempts, to become real thieves (at one point they rob Anthony's house, just for practice).While Dignan is the showier role, Anthony is the crux of the movie; it is told through his eyes.  Luke Wilson, an actor of low-key charm who gets more appealing the more I watch him, plays the yin to his brother Owen's yang.  Anthony is Dignan's more adult alter ego.  Or, more accurately, he's Dignan's Big Brother figure: full of support and amusement for Dignan's harebrained schemes, always willing to lend a hand, and, if needed, a sane word.  An odd role for a man just released from a mental hospital.  And Wilson, in his first film role, even gets to play a very touching and tender romance with Inez (Lumi Cavazos), a Spanish-only speaking maid at a motel.  It's this section, which takes up most of the film's middle third, which defines Anthony's character most.It is the one scene in the mental hospital that, in a few scant moments, defines Anthony and Dignan's relationship.  Anthony is ready to check out, voluntarily, but a confused Dignan wants to help him break out.  Always the good sport, Anthony ties several bed sheets together, explains politely to his doctor what he's doing, and casually rappels down the wall, while his friend, hiding in the bushes, couldn't be more excited that his plan was a success.  Dignan, the adventurous man-child with big ideas and loads of initiative, and Anthony, the ever-loyal friend who always wants to do his buddy right, compliment each other so well in this scene, as they do throughout the movie.  It is a fascinating and complex, but very dear, relationship.Anderson's filmmaking style, so effervescent in his next two films (""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums""), still shines through here, although it is hampered by two things.  First, he has a stingier budget to work with (at one point we see inmates wearing jumpsuits emblazoned with the words ""WASCO STATE PENITENTIARY""; the same suit, if seen in ""Tenenbaums"" would be professionally made and ornate, while here it appears to be a painter's overalls written on with magic marker).  Second, whereas ""Rushmore"" and ""Tenenbaums"" were basically confined to one setting (a prep school and a Manhattan townhouse respectively), ""Bottle Rocket"" is a road movie.  Anderson can't plan elaborate tableaus, filled with precious details, when the location may change from scene to scene.  These aren't harsh criticisms, mind you.  But I did feel like Anderson wasn't able to fully play to his strengths here, as he got a chance to later.That's not to say he doesn't still indulge in his passion for vibrant details.  One fine example is Dignan's notebook, outlining his 75-year (!) plan for success.  It goes by quickly, so you'll have to pause if you want to read each page as it flips by.  I recommend you do.  It's a marvel of low-key ambition and wrong-headed planning.  And Anderson's passion for music, a character unto itself in his later films, is more subdued, but no less effective, here.  Mark Mothersbaugh, a frequent collaborator with Anderson, again provides the score and again does a flawless, eccentric job.""Bottle Rocket"" is a modest masterpiece.  Anderson and Wilson's script, with its Altmanesque scenes of overlapping dialogue, its obsession with the incidentals of the character's lives, and its knack for peculiar dialogue (Dignan, in an atypical moment of self-doubt, says, ""He's out. And you're out, too. And I don't think I'm in, either. No gang!""), is just plain wonderful.  Anderson's direction shows the promise he would later fulfill.  And the acting, mainly by the Wilson brothers, but also by Musgrave, Cavazos, and Caan, is not as amateurish as I would have expected.  A fine, funny, friendly film, that shoots for the moon, but doesn't flare out quickly like the fireworks for which it is named.",5,Righteous Dignan narration,1013817600,"02 16,

15848,A1GTHUO4BOBWCR,0767821408,Neildo,"[4, 4]","&quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is an Owen Wilson feast.  Although he's had some hilarious roles in later movies (Shanghai Noon, Meet the Parent's, Zoolander and Royal Tenenbaums), this is one of the few movies where he is the lead character.  He aptly plays the role of Dignan, a modern-day Don Quixote who sets out on a 75 year life of crime only to have his dream of being a professional criminal undermined by his lack of common sense.This movie is not as sophisticated or complex as later Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson ventures (Rushmore &amp; Royal Tenenbaums), but it is more fun.  The humor is very subtle at times but that's what makes it so funny.

The  problem is only one of them wants to really be a great robber and he is a  complete moron who can't even keep a job mowing lawns.  Another is just  trying to impress his jerk brother and the third just wants to be a good  friend and find a chick to love.The result is a hilarious series of  poorly executed robberies, mostly robbing people they know.  The last  robbery is so over planned and yet completely miscalculated it becomes an  absolute mess.  I laughed so hard and for so long at the last robbery I  almost passed out from a lack of oxygen.  This is a fun film with two  endearing lead characters.The only criticism I have is the time spent  on the love interest.  It seemed contrived and added as filler.

15864,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0767821408,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 2]","***Spoilers Within***Bottle Rocket is one of the hardest movies I've ever decided to review. The story isn't great and the acting isn't meant to be taken seriously. There aren't any memorable messages or profound events. So why has it become one of my favorite comedies?It's all about tone and style.Director Wes Anderson doesn't look for the obvious laugh. It doesn't matter whether the story makes sense or whether events fit perfectly. Anderson reminds me of David Lynch in some ways, but the subject matter is generally much lighter. He creates worlds, and there's something not quite right with those worlds. It makes them fascinating places to visit.Bottle Rocket begins with Anthony (Luke Wilson) feigning escape from a mental institution which he attends voluntarily. He does this to make things more exciting for his friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson). Dignan is an interesting character. He's capable of doing idiotic things, but he's not exactly stupid. He just can't see the danger in some of the bizarre things he attempts. We are shown his 75-year plan, outlining all the goals he's aiming to reach over the course of his life.Dignan sees himself as a criminal mastermind and practices by helping Anthony rob his own house. The pair hang around with their friend, Bob (Musgrove), who drives their getaway car because he's the only one of the group who owns a car. The group proves how utterly inept it is during a bookstore robbery. They are so bad that it works well as comedy. After the robbery, the group decides to flee the town and hides in a motel.Anthony falls in love with a housekeeper at the motel, despite the fact that she can barely speak any English. He does his best to communicate and occasionally enlists the help of someone to translate. That leads to major confusion at one point in the movie.Dignan eventually introduces the gang to Mr. Henry (Caan), who once fired him from his job as a landscape gardener. Dignan believes that Henry's company is just a front and that he's also a criminal mastermind. He wants to prove to Henry that he can pull off robberies of his own and so he plans a raid on a storage facility with Anthony, Bob and some of Henry's friends. This sequence is ridiculous and highlights just how idiotic Dignan can be. When the robbery is interrupted and they have been seen, he instructs the group to put on their bandit masks.Bottle Rocket marked the debuts of Luke and Owen Wilson, and Owen Wilson helped Wes Anderson with the screenplay. It's a film made by a group of friends who had known each other since they met in school. The film was rejected by the Sundance Festival, and initial test screenings were a disaster. It appeared that nobody wanted to embrace Anderson's quirky sense of humor. However, over the years, Bottle Rocket has gained a lot of fans.Wes Anderson's career has blossomed since his debut, but he's always retained that quirky style and tone. Bottle Rocket isn't perfect, but it's significant to me because it's where everything began for Anderson.Criterion's Blu-ray looks great and the special features provide fans with plenty of background information. It also contains the Bottle Rocket short and it's worth watching to see how the film evolved.",5,Where it all began for Anderson and the Wilson brothers,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,3226,"['***Spoilers', 'Within***Bottle', 'Rocket', 'one', 'hardest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'decided', 'review', 'story', ""n't"", 'great', 'acting', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'are', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'messages', 'profound', 'events', 'So', 'why', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'tone', 'style.Director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'look', 'obvious', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'matter', 'story', 'sense', 'events', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'Anderson', 'David', 'Lynch', 'ways', 'subject', 'matter', 'generally', 'much', 'lighter', 'worlds', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'worlds', 'fascinating', 'places', 'visit.Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Anthony', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'feigning', 'escape', 'mental', 'institution', 'voluntarily', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'exciting', 'friend', 'Dignan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Dignan', 'interesting', 'character', 'capable', 'doing', 'idiotic', 'things', 'not', 'exactly', 'stupid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'danger', 'bizarre', 'things', 'are', 'shown', '75-year', 'plan', 'outlining', 'goals', 'aiming', 'reach', 'course', 'life.Dignan', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'practices', 'helping', 'Anthony', 'rob', 'own', 'house', 'pair', 'hang', 'friend', 'Bob', 'Musgrove', 'who', 'getaway', 'car', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'car', 'group', 'how', 'utterly', 'inept', 'bookstore', 'robbery', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'well', 'comedy', 'robbery', 'group', 'flee', 'town', 'hides', 'motel.Anthony', 'love', 'housekeeper', 'motel', 'fact', 'can', 'barely', 'speak', 'English', 'best', 'communicate', 'occasionally', 'help', 'someone', 'translate', 'major', 'confusion', 'one', 'point', 'movie.Dignan', 'eventually', 'gang', 'Mr.', 'Henry', 'Caan', 'who', 'once', 'fired', 'job', 'landscape', 'gardener', 'Dignan', 'Henry', 'company', 'just', 'front', 'also', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'prove', 'Henry', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'robberies', 'own', 'so', 'raid', 'storage', 'facility', 'Anthony', 'Bob', 'Henry', 'friends', 'sequence', 'ridiculous', 'highlights', 'just', 'how', 'idiotic', 'Dignan', 'can', 'be', 'When', 'robbery', 'interrupted', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'group', 'put', 'bandit', 'masks.Bottle', 'Rocket', 'marked', 'debuts', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'helped', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'screenplay', 'film', 'made', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'known', 'other', 'met', 'school', 'film', 'was', 'rejected', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'initial', 'test', 'screenings', 'were', 'disaster', 'appeared', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'embrace', 'Anderson', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'However', 'years', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'gained', 'lot', 'fans.Wes', 'Anderson', 'career', 'blossomed', 'debut', 'always', 'retained', 'quirky', 'style', 'tone', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'significant', 'where', 'everything', 'began', 'Anderson.Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'provide', 'fans', 'plenty', 'background', 'information', 'also', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'short', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'evolved']",Bottle Rocket

Despite the fact that this is the first film that these two worked on together, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is every bit as good as the more recognized and well known follow-ups.  This film marks the introduction of a very unique and original brand of humor, a type of humor that can possibly be mistaken for drama if the viewer isn't paying close enough attention.  This is not in your face comedy, but rather a subtle, quirky sense of humor delivered in a deadpan style that in its own way is extremely rewarding and enjoyable.The film itself features great direction, music and acting. In particular, Luke Wilson's portrayal of Dignan ranks among some of the most complex comedic performances I have ever seen.  As for the rest of the cast, the performances are funny, heartfelt, and sincere.  This combination of emotion adds a realistic dimension to &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;.  This is a funny film, and comical things continually happen to the characters, but it is humor that seems to exist somewhere in the real world.  &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; does not focus soley on comedy, but incorporates aspects of everyday life into its story.

15871,A96K1ZGW56S2I,0767821408,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","Even though he's only made four movies, Wes Anderson is one of the most talented, interesting, and quirky directors in the business.  He's still young, but with only four films under his belt he's already become a synonym for a very distinct type of filmmaking, e.g. ""That movie was kind of Wes Andersonish.""  Having seen the final three films of the Anderson canon (RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS, and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU), I finally had the opportunity to see Anderson's debut feature, BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie begins rather slowly, but by the end I was laughing my head off and decided BOTTLE ROCKET was my second favorite film next to THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU.The movie was released early in 1996 and though not as technically strong as Anderson's later pictures, it illustrates the genius of filmmaking that he is.  In addition to being Anderson's major directorial debut, the movie is also known as the film that catapulted the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke, into superstardom.  Luke Wilson portrays Anthony Adams, a young man who is struggling with his identity and purpose in life.  After taking time to recuperate at a voluntary mental hospital, Anthony returns home and meets up with his childhood friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Anthony is looking forward to settling down and getting on with life while Dignan has bigger plans for both of them.  Dignan wants Anthony to enjoy life, too, but through a totally different means than he imagines:  a life of pleasure gained from committing crime.  At first, Anthony isn't willing to join Dignan's wild scheme, but Dignan is persistent and breaks through Anthony's reluctance and gets him to join him on a crime spree to impress Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry, a supposed local crime lord.  Dignan also gets another friend, Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) to join the scheme.  While Dignan goes about planning the caper, Bob tries to fend off his bully brother John, aka ""Future Man"" (Andrew Wilson--the overlooked Wilson brother) and Anthony falls in love with a Latino motel housekeeper named Inez (Lumi Cavazos).The film leads up to the caper itself, an event that is both hilarious and heartbreaking.All of the actors do a great job.  I particularly liked Andrew Wilson (whose real childhood nickname was Future Man because he was seen as being so serious and looking to the future) and Kumar Pallana who portrays Kumar, a supposed expert safe-cracker that Dignan adds to his crime team.Not everyone is going to enjoy watching BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie has a very odd pacing, even for a Wes Anderson film.  It's evident that both the director and cast were adjusting to making a major picture.  Also, since this is a Wes Anderson picture, not everyone is going to like, enjoy, or even understand the humor.  There are no cheap gags or easy jokes.  Instead, the comedy can best be described as intellectual-situational.  In short, it's kind-of Wes Andersonish.  A must-see for fans of Wes Anderson or any of the Wilson brothers as well as anyone who likes quirky dramatic-comedies.",4,"""You're calling me a bully?

15873,A3J5J7QDERBKVA,0767821408,"Volpe ""geezowhiz""","[2, 2]","I might as well not even try to give BOTTLE ROCKET a fair and balanced review because Owen Wilson is all I can talk about when it comes to this movie. His character, Dignan, is the embodiment of what movie characters should be: entities that live beyond the movie, beyond time, and beyond the actor who plays them. Dignan is quite possibly the best movie creation I have seen in a LONG time. I have a newfound respect for Owen Wilson's acting and his screenwriting ability.With my short homage to Dignan being over (for now...), I will say that BOTTLE ROCKET does not fail to live up to Wes Anderson's usual offbeat comedies. Having seen RUSHMORE and THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS before this movie, I was well prepared for the characters in BOTTLE ROCKET to be slightly insane, off-beat and freakishly realistic at the same time. There seems to be a common vein that runs through all of Anderson's lead characters--an insatiable drive towards something that the audience (and other characters) may not be able to grasp until the end. You know going into a Wes Anderson film that you are going to be treated with a rare glimpse of an indiscernible time period where the constraints of reality/normalcy do not exist.I must agree with many of the other reviewers here in that this movie is definitely not for people who can ONLY find humor in the obvious slapstick/punch-line formula. I think all of Anderson's movies are in the ""love `em or hate `em"" category for this reason. The humor in this movie is understated, of course, and it lives within the idiosyncrasies of the characters. The way certain characters deliver their dialogue with their own unique brand of subtle comedy makes this movie what it is: a completely quotable riot for those ""in the know"" to relish on.And now I'm back to Dignan. His sincerity and enthusiasm will overwhelm you. In one scene all he does is make a semi honk its horn with the usual yanking motion out a car window, but the gleam in his eyes and smile on his face when he says ""Did you hear that?"" evokes a pure, childlike excitement that lights up the screen. Dignan definitely sees through the eyes of a child-the world is in black and white to him...maybe only one color, actually.

One of them, Anthony (Owen Wilson), just got out of an mental institution but seems much more sane than the manic Dignan (Luke Wilson). Anthony falls in love with a motel maid, Inez.Personally, I though this was a disconnected movie wih a very slim plot. I didn't care for this at all.For what it's worth I thought Owen Wilson looked like a young Dennis Hopper with a broken nose in this film. It's the haircut that Wilson has in this film, a crew cut.",1,A waste of time,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,527,"['Three', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'petty', 'burglary', 'jobs', 'are', 'pretty', 'inept', 'One', 'Anthony', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'just', 'got', 'out', 'mental', 'institution', 'much', 'more', 'sane', 'manic', 'Dignan', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Anthony', 'love', 'motel', 'maid', 'Inez.Personally', 'was', 'disconnected', 'movie', 'very', 'slim', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'all.For', 'what', 'worth', 'thought', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'looked', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'broken', 'nose', 'film', 'haircut', 'Wilson', 'film', 'crew', 'cut']",Bottle Rocket

I couldn't find any reference to these changes in the supplementary material at all.MISSING: Originally, during the book store robbery, Anthony grabs a random book off the shelf and opens it, revealing the title page ""Job Opportunities in Government - 1995"" which always gave me a little chuckle. Now for some reason the book opens to a black and white  photograph of a military plane (it goes by so fast you'd have to freeze frame to make it out.) ** UPDATE *** per the new Wes Anderson coffee table book, we learn that the military plane shot was in the original cut ( a bit of non-sequitor humor... you think Anthony is reading something important enough to distract him from the business of robbing the store, only to discover its a completely off-topic, random photograph.) The studio wanted a more obvious laugh so they had Wes reshoot the ""Job Opportunities..."" title page (which, if you look closely, was just taped into the book). This Criterion edition restores the original shot.The Wes Anderson CollectionADDED: Originally, when Bob hands his earnings over to Future Man to cover his attorney fees, he asks if he can keep a few bucks for gas, and the scene ends. Now the scene plays a few seconds longer, and we hear Future Man's reply: ""No, you can't.""In addition to these minor (and somewhat baffling) changes, I was also  unable to find any images of the one-sheet art or logo anywhere on this set (as appears on the menu page and sleeve of the original release).So if you're a hardcore Bottle Rocket fan or completist, hang onto your old disc and buy this set as well. In addition to a beautiful transfer, commentary track, documentary, the original short film, and other extras, the booklet insert is a miniature replica of Dignan's 75-Year Plan notebook, along with reproductions of Anthony's drawing of Inez on horseback, the book store heist plan schematics, etc.",5,"Great set--but keep the old disc, too!",1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,2064,"['Criterion', '2-disc', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'outstanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'toss', 'original', 'disc', 'just', 'yet', 'new', 'edition', 'slightly', 'different', 'edit', 'one', 'laugh', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'reference', 'changes', 'supplementary', 'material', 'all.MISSING', 'Originally', 'book', 'store', 'robbery', 'Anthony', 'grabs', 'random', 'book', 'shelf', 'revealing', 'title', 'page', 'Job', 'Opportunities', 'Government', '1995', 'always', 'gave', 'little', 'chuckle', 'Now', 'reason', 'book', 'black', 'white', 'photograph', 'military', 'plane', 'fast', ""'d"", 'have', 'freeze', 'frame', 'make', 'out', '**', 'UPDATE', '***', 'new', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'coffee', 'table', 'book', 'learn', 'military', 'plane', 'shot', 'was', 'original', 'cut', 'bit', 'non-sequitor', 'humor', 'think', 'Anthony', 'reading', 'something', 'important', 'enough', 'distract', 'business', 'robbing', 'store', 'only', 'discover', 'completely', 'off-topic', 'random', 'photograph', 'studio', 'wanted', 'more', 'obvious', 'laugh', 'had', 'Wes', 'Job', 'Opportunities', 'title', 'page', 'look', 'closely', 'was', 'just', 'taped', 'book', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'original', 'shot.The', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'CollectionADDED', 'Originally', 'when', 'Bob', 'earnings', 'Future', 'Man', 'cover', 'attorney', 'fees', 'can', 'keep', 'few', 'bucks', 'gas', 'scene', 'Now', 'scene', 'few', 'seconds', 'longer', 'hear', 'Future', 'Man', 'reply', 'No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'addition', 'minor', 'somewhat', 'baffling', 'changes', 'was', 'also', 'unable', 'find', 'images', 'one-sheet', 'art', 'logo', 'anywhere', 'set', 'menu', 'page', 'sleeve', 'original', 'release', '.So', ""'re"", 'hardcore', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'fan', 'completist', 'hang', 'old', 'disc', 'buy', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'addition', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'commentary', 'track', 'documentary', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'other', 'extras', 'booklet', 'insert', 'miniature', 'replica', 'Dignan', '75-Year', 'Plan', 'notebook', 'reproductions', 'Anthony', 'drawing', 'Inez', 'horseback', 'book', 'store', 'heist', 'plan', 'schematics', 'etc']",Bottle Rocket

Indie movies range from low-brow to high-intensity to semi-porn to down-home.  This paragraph has nothing to do with Bottle  Rocket except for the fact that in the chocolate box that is Independent  Film, Bottle Rocket is the one you always hope for, but rarely come  across.Bottle Rocket is cleverly written by Wes Anderson and Owen  Wilson, and even more ingeniously ad-libbed by Owen Wilson and his brother  Luke.  Family chemistry can be a great thing, and in Bottle Rocket, it's  spectacular.  If Owen Wilson one of the best comic performances of the  '90s, it's partially due to the fact that Luke Wilson gives a wonderful  straight-man performance.  The dialogue is hilarious and quotable, the  secondary characters are entertaining, the story is unpredictable, and it's  a treat to see the Wilson Brothers together on screen.Bottle Rocket is a  gem of an Indie movie -- hilarious, unconventional, and with a great  Un-Hollywood quality.  If you haven't seen it -- put it on your &quot;Must  Rent&quot; list.  If you have seen it, see it again!  If you liked Owen  Wilson in this movie, check him out in the new Jackie Chan movie Shanghai  Noon.  The role was written as a stock Cowboy character, but Owen Wilson  rewrote it and did some great improv to make it one of the most delightful  performances of the year.",5,The birth of my appreciation for the Wilson brothers,959731200,"05 31, 2000",2000,1417,"['Indie', 'film', 'industry', 'box', 'chocolates', 'never', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'Indie', 'movies', 'range', 'low-brow', 'high-intensity', 'semi-porn', 'down-home', 'paragraph', 'nothing', 'do', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'fact', 'chocolate', 'box', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'one', 'always', 'hope', 'rarely', 'come', 'across.Bottle', 'Rocket', 'cleverly', 'written', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'even', 'more', 'ingeniously', 'ad-libbed', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'Luke', 'Family', 'chemistry', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'thing', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'spectacular', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'performances', ""'90s"", 'partially', 'due', 'fact', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'wonderful', 'straight-man', 'performance', 'dialogue', 'hilarious', 'quotable', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'entertaining', 'story', 'unpredictable', 'treat', 'see', 'Wilson', 'Brothers', 'together', 'screen.Bottle', 'Rocket', 'gem', 'Indie', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'unconventional', 'great', 'Un-Hollywood', 'quality', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'put', 'quot', 'Must', 'Rent', 'quot', 'list', 'have', 'seen', 'see', 'again', 'liked', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'new', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'Shanghai', 'Noon', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'stock', 'Cowboy', 'character', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'rewrote', 'did', 'great', 'improv', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'performances', 'year']",Bottle Rocket
