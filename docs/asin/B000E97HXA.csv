970785,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B000E97HXA,Adam,"[0, 1]","CBS is a weird network-they drop all their decent TV shows, but then they show these clearly floppable movies.  But, this review is not on CBS, rather a movie that I saw years ago that I seriously thought nothing of until I saw it here on Amazon.I never saw Category 6 (the preceding story), but Category 7 is a disaster flick about a large storm laying seige to just about everything.  Due to various reasons, this superstorm has intensified to one of the highest categories possible, meaning it will obliterate whatever it passes over.  It is essentially up to scientists, government officials, and a wacky storm chaser to find a way to stop it before imminent disaster parks itself over Washington D.C.  This movie was shown in a two-parter on CBS in 2005 and the only reason I ever heard about it is because of CBS's intense radio and television commercials.  Simple curiosity prompted me to record it and watch later.In short, this movie was a major disappointment.  The acting was horrible, the dialogue must not have been proofed at all, and the characters were hardly memorable (well, ok, the Tornado guy was a little bit, simply because of his goofy nature, but only him).  Aside from science that is a little far-fetched to ever consider possible, this movie just got to be a little too much.  It's sad, because I grew up on the disaster TV movie genre, which are naturally prone to campy acting and low-budget special effects, but even this one fell short.In summary, if you're a person who loves over-the-top disasters, cheesy characters, and a plot line controlled by excessive action sequences, then this might be your movie.  My only reason for giving it 2 stars rather than 1 is because I feel this movie had a chance of being better if it had more money in its budget.",2,"I wasn't ""Blown Away"" by this movie",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1785,"['CBS', 'weird', 'network-they', 'drop', 'decent', 'TV', 'shows', 'then', 'show', 'clearly', 'floppable', 'movies', 'review', 'not', 'CBS', 'rather', 'movie', 'saw', 'years', 'seriously', 'thought', 'nothing', 'saw', 'here', 'Amazon.I', 'never', 'saw', 'Category', '6', 'preceding', 'story', 'Category', '7', 'disaster', 'flick', 'large', 'storm', 'laying', 'seige', 'just', 'everything', 'Due', 'various', 'reasons', 'superstorm', 'intensified', 'one', 'highest', 'categories', 'possible', 'meaning', 'will', 'obliterate', 'essentially', 'up', 'scientists', 'government', 'officials', 'wacky', 'storm', 'chaser', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'imminent', 'disaster', 'parks', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'two-parter', 'CBS', '2005', 'only', 'reason', 'ever', 'heard', 'CBS', 'intense', 'radio', 'television', 'commercials', 'Simple', 'curiosity', 'prompted', 'record', 'watch', 'later.In', 'short', 'movie', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'acting', 'was', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'proofed', 'characters', 'were', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'well', 'ok', 'Tornado', 'guy', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'simply', 'goofy', 'nature', 'only', 'Aside', 'science', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'ever', 'consider', 'possible', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'sad', 'grew', 'up', 'disaster', 'TV', 'movie', 'genre', 'are', 'naturally', 'prone', 'campy', 'acting', 'low-budget', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'one', 'fell', 'short.In', 'summary', ""'re"", 'person', 'who', 'over-the-top', 'disasters', 'cheesy', 'characters', 'plot', 'line', 'controlled', 'excessive', 'action', 'sequences', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'rather', '1', 'feel', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'money', 'budget']",Category 7: The End of the World

The means by which this is achieved, I must keep secret, but it is shown in the film.Second, a good many people, going by the Amazon reviews, didn't much like this TV film. I found it reasonably entertaining, given the limitations of the 'made for television' product. Admittedly, I did watch the two separate parts on different nights; I would  recommend you do the same. Given the time spent on the various subplots, common to all disaster movies. that is the best way to reduce or eliminate the lack of really superfilmic (to coin a term) content. Now if they had shown the world coming to an end......Key characters, contrary to some of the review comments, perform to the level one expects from made for television  productions (admitting that there are exceptions who can deliver first class performances); Gina Gershon's looks raise her a notch above the rest, with Swoozie Kurtz doing well as an evangelical's wife, although holding her superior talent in check as the role demanded. The plot has a good deal more padding than it needs,  presumably to extend the length as television time-demands probably required. Tightening up the script (blue penciling a good deal) would have helped the presentation but there is that need for two episodes. I rerun a number of his older TV series, so I haven't seen Robert Wagner in anything new since his work of the early 80's. In this one, dating from 2005, he sure did well-preserved and very authoritative as a Senator. He didn't have much to do, but did add class to the production.With reservations, I do recommend this film as a successor to the Category 6 by the same producers. Randy Quaid's character has come back to life in this one, not very credibly if you saw the last one; he gets another chance to do his  ""follow them anywhere"" storm hunter once more.At any rate, I missed the super storms that can be made with super budgets, but found this one sufficiently entertaining to warrant watching it.",4,"Not Up There With The Big Ones, But Watchable",1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2039,"['First', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'subtitle', 'World', 'Does', 'Not', 'Come', 'End', 'means', 'achieved', 'must', 'keep', 'secret', 'shown', 'film.Second', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'going', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'TV', 'film', 'found', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'given', 'limitations', ""'made"", 'television', 'product', 'Admittedly', 'did', 'watch', 'two', 'separate', 'parts', 'different', 'nights', 'would', 'recommend', 'do', 'same', 'Given', 'time', 'spent', 'various', 'subplots', 'common', 'disaster', 'movies', 'best', 'way', 'reduce', 'eliminate', 'lack', 'really', 'superfilmic', 'coin', 'term', 'content', 'Now', 'had', 'shown', 'world', 'coming', 'end', 'Key', 'characters', 'contrary', 'review', 'comments', 'perform', 'level', 'one', 'made', 'television', 'productions', 'admitting', 'are', 'exceptions', 'who', 'can', 'deliver', 'first', 'class', 'performances', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'looks', 'raise', 'notch', 'rest', 'Swoozie', 'Kurtz', 'doing', 'well', 'evangelical', 'wife', 'holding', 'superior', 'talent', 'check', 'role', 'demanded', 'plot', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'padding', 'presumably', 'extend', 'length', 'television', 'time-demands', 'probably', 'required', 'Tightening', 'up', 'script', 'blue', 'penciling', 'good', 'deal', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'presentation', 'need', 'two', 'episodes', 'rerun', 'number', 'older', 'TV', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'anything', 'new', 'work', 'early', '80', 'one', 'dating', '2005', 'sure', 'did', 'well-preserved', 'very', 'authoritative', 'Senator', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'did', 'add', 'class', 'production.With', 'reservations', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'successor', 'Category', '6', 'same', 'producers', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'character', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'one', 'not', 'very', 'credibly', 'saw', 'last', 'one', 'chance', 'do', 'follow', 'anywhere', 'storm', 'hunter', 'once', 'more.At', 'rate', 'missed', 'super', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'super', 'budgets', 'found', 'one', 'sufficiently', 'entertaining', 'warrant', 'watching']",Category 7: The End of the World

The same can be said of religion, here it's an easy target, unflattering, also meant to anger.  They want controlled responses because they haven't much else....except putting children in peril.  After all, they have to keep our interest for 169 minutes, how else are they going to do that if not with turmoil, confusion, and people constantly screaming ""it's the end of days!""When this movie started I was momentarily confused, had I stumbled into a music video instead?  All the garish colors, the abrupt cuts; very visually arresting, I liked it.  I also liked seeing someone else's landmarks destroyed for a change.  All was well, or so I thought, until the speeches started flowing, the doom messages, the self-important grandiose performances by every actor (I suppose they thought this heightened the suspense to have everyone just a shade under hysteria).  Unfortunately, this made everyone seem unnatural.  When the calmest one in the mix is Randy Quaid you know you're in trouble!The problem with working on something this massive is how do you sustain interest?  I thought the killer frogs were a nice touch but other than that, most of the scenes were all jumbled together, whip stitched in a less than seamless fashion.

It is by no means, high art, but who cares?Though the box says Randy Quade and Shannon Doherty are the stars, in reality, Gina Gershon is more the star here as well as Cameron Daddo. They get a lot more screen time. However, Quade and Doherty are the bigger stars, so they get top billing.It was kind of eerie to see Randy Quade doing his kind of crazy bit here, as he seems to be doing it in real life right now. I sure hope whatever he's going through gets straightened out so he can get back to making movies, because he is one of those characters that I just love to see, especially in movies like this.I won't even attempt to justify the science behind this movie. What's the point? It's not about that anyway. It's about a big disaster, and having fun surviving it. There is, of course, the evil Dick Cheney-like government character that tries to stop the heroes every step of the way. Then there is the seemingly evil bureaucrat that ends up helping them in the end.The special effects are not too bad, though on the fringe of corny b-movie bad, but still what I would expect out of this type of movie.As long as SyFy keeps pumping out movies like this every Saturday, I'll keep watching. Seeing as how their regular weekly fare is degenerating into things like wrestling, I'm starting to wonder if they are going to end up like MTV, which used to stand for Music Television, but hasn't had any music on it in several decades.But I digress.Category 7 is a great popcorn flick for a lazy Saturday afternoon.

970803,ALOYRM215JP45,B000E97HXA,"GhostFrappe ""Nerd of all trades""","[1, 1]","This movie intrigued me at a glance because, like many, I like disaster movies. Twister, The Day After Tomorrow, Flood: A River's Rampage...all pretty good titles. But I figured Category 7 was some kind of bargain-bin TV movie, so I wasn't expecting to be dazzled. But even with expectations riding a little low, I was still disappointed. Very. The movie was boring, senseless in many spots, and way too long. This movie did not need to be almost three hours long; there was a bunch of unnecessary padding in there for who knows why; there was absolutely nothing in this piece of crap that could not have been said in the standard 70-90 minutes.First off, the plot is stupid. Bad tornadoes that happen around the world in convenient large urban areas. These tornadoes are happening in the northeastern United States while a hurricane approaches from the South. They will meet in - what do you know - America's capital. Apparently the clashing of these two storm systems will result in an unheard-of apocalyptic Category 7 storm. And the only way to save the world is to lower the temperature in Washington D.C. to 79.2 degrees by cutting power to the entire area. The End. Why that's the magic number is beyond me, but I guess the producers thought since most people are ignorant about meteorology and weather patterns, they could say anything in order to create a crisis and a goal to reach that people wouldn't question much. I don't even think anything different would happen if tornadic storm cells clashed with a hurricane. The weather would still suck, but I seriously doubt two different storms could collide into one super-storm.Also, there's a scene where a bus is hijacked and a bunch of people are kidnapped. Later in the film, one of the kidnappers says something about how the victims are all first-born, I guess implying the disasters are somehow related to the plagues of Egypt? I don't know, but this entire thing - from the bus-jacking to the victims being found in some kind of factory is absolutely pointless. If you left out those scenes, nothing would be lost from the movie in terms of plot or quality.Gotta also love the use of very obvious stock footage of tornadoes; one is an exact segment from the documentary ""Twister 2."" It was, however, kind of cool to see the idiot preacher get electrocuted; he deserved it. That was probably the best part of the whole film. And I will say, for a TV movie, the special effects weren't too horrible (though I do think Mount Rushmore was much too small). Read a bit about this title on IMDB. It was nominated for several awards for it's sound quality only. That ought to tell you how much viewers thought of this mess. The film is just plain bad; it was a TV movie most likely because it would have absolutely bombed at the box office. So in that case, why the hell even make it to begin with? There was honestly no point. It wasn't like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" where half the country was plunged into a new ice age and everyone had to learn to live differently. Power got cut and people hid in a factory, and by the time they got done offing the kidnappers, it was sunny outside! There is absolutely no resolution. What exactly is learned? You can control the weather with electricity? Except for the part where you can't. I think Category 7 tried to mix ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Twister"" and just failed miserably because they somehow got $15 million to play with and had no idea what they were even doing.Do not waste your money on this crap.

There are far too many scene discontinuities, incomprehensible and underdeveloped story additions, and simply atrocious special effects - some of the worst ever filmed - to keep this film above average.  Which is a shame considering the fairly impressive cast that includes Gina Gershon, Tom Skerritt, Kenneth Walsh, Shannen Doherty, Robert Wagner, and the always entertaining Randy Quaid.Basically, a professor who is not Dennis Quaid has predictions about storms destroying the world.  He's widely disregarded by smug politicians.  Massive hurricanes collide to produce the heretofore unseen.  Storm chasers who are not Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton shoot rockets into city-destroying twisters to collect data.  Tom Skerritt mails it in as a jet fighter pilot who flies into tornadoes; it's essentially his role from Top Gun, but older.  Meanwhile, Gina Gershon is completely overwhelmed by the role and responsibilities of FEMA director Judith Carr.Perhaps the best way to describe this movie is with the sad tale of Kenneth Walsh.  In The Day After Tomorrow he is the Vice President and ignored advice that could have saved millions of lives; in this movie he's Chief of Staff, and he ignored the advice again.  `Nuf said.In every possible way this movie is a generic rip-off, and there are even a few poorly done reenactments from scenes in the original; except, in this one, the Statue of Liberty is plastic and the flipping cars are of the Matchbox variety.  Some of the hurricane footage is less believable than footage from the Wizard of Oz.  To make matters worse, some stock footage is blatantly used twice, a slap in the face to any intelligent viewer.  I'm embarrassed for some of the quality actors no doubt wishing this weren't on their resume.Crack-pot climatology - poorly executed plagiarism from The Day After Tomorrow (there's even a token Asian assistant not named Tamlyn Tomita) - combined with an abhorrent Armageddon angle and an attack on FEMA serves as nothing more than a hit piece, a horribly transparent collection of Hollywood political agendas masquerading as legitimate plotlines.

While I haven't seen the previous film, Category 6, I plan on purchasing the movie to see how this series started.While it's not too impossible to believe, such events as what is seen in this film could very well become true. With the rising cost of oil and the fact that the greenhouse effect and global warming are impacting our enviropnment, this movie does have a very moral lesson to show anyone who watches this movie. We must protect our environment before it starts to react to our presence on this world.It was refreshing to see Shannon Doherty and her authentic talent coming to the surface. She had been released from Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed because of her attitude with producers and directors but it was refreshing to see her performing true to her nature and having a role that was written just for her. She is a wonderful actress and it's time more and more roles were written specifically for her. Randy Quaid is also the consummate actor who always seems to manage to steal every scene he's in.But, I was disapponted that the US Government and the politicians that are portrayed in this movie seem content in facing the ultimate destruction of Mother Nature and protecting the interests of the large corporations, oil cartels and special interests instead of safeguarding the lives of the people. It shows a lack of original thinking on the part of the writers, who should have gone to a few more creative writing courses before sitting down to write this movie. In addition, I felt that this movie was a little longer than it should have been. Hopefully, there'll be a little more of a waiting period before we see Category 8, which will be coming our way faster than we can turn off the power.",4,Category 6: The Year of Disasters,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,2140,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'open', 'watching', 'disaster', 'movies', 'Volcano', 'Twister', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'good', 'films', 'own', 'right', 'what', 'movie', 'critics', 'say', 'them.Category', '7', 'End', 'World', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'over-analyzing', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'instead', 'enjoying', 'what', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'film', 'Category', '6', 'plan', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'not', 'too', 'impossible', 'believe', 'such', 'events', 'what', 'seen', 'film', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'become', 'true', 'rising', 'cost', 'oil', 'fact', 'greenhouse', 'effect', 'global', 'warming', 'are', 'impacting', 'enviropnment', 'movie', 'have', 'very', 'moral', 'lesson', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'must', 'protect', 'environment', 'react', 'presence', 'world.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Shannon', 'Doherty', 'authentic', 'talent', 'coming', 'surface', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Charmed', 'attitude', 'producers', 'directors', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'performing', 'true', 'nature', 'having', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'roles', 'were', 'written', 'specifically', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'also', 'consummate', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'manage', 'steal', 'scene', 'in.But', 'was', 'disapponted', 'US', 'Government', 'politicians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'seem', 'content', 'facing', 'ultimate', 'destruction', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'protecting', 'interests', 'large', 'corporations', 'oil', 'cartels', 'special', 'interests', 'instead', 'safeguarding', 'lives', 'people', 'lack', 'original', 'thinking', 'part', 'writers', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'few', 'more', 'creative', 'writing', 'courses', 'sitting', 'down', 'write', 'movie', 'addition', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'little', 'more', 'waiting', 'period', 'see', 'Category', '8', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'way', 'faster', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'power']",Category 7: The End of the World
