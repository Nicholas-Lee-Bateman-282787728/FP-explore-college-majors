I was too busy building a career and raising a family to care about anything except getting Carter out of the White House.  It is an interesting note that some of Reagan's taxing and budget policies that failed him worked-out well for Clinton.  While not quite the hero many think him to be, he was a relief from his predecessor and put the USA on a path to recovery albeit with a bit of pain before the healing.  Good documentary.",5,Reagan...warts and all.,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,511,"['lot', 'information', 'have', 'forgotten', 'regarding', 'Reagan', 'era', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'building', 'career', 'raising', 'family', 'care', 'anything', 'getting', 'Carter', 'White', 'House', 'interesting', 'note', 'Reagan', 'taxing', 'budget', 'policies', 'failed', 'worked-out', 'well', 'Clinton', 'not', 'hero', 'many', 'think', 'be', 'was', 'relief', 'predecessor', 'put', 'USA', 'path', 'recovery', 'albeit', 'bit', 'pain', 'healing', 'Good', 'documentary']",Reagan Presidency

This DVD is miserly in its appreciation of Reagan's accomplishments and spins history to support current, left wing political dynamics.  I would view it as a rewrite of history to support the massive expansion of government that he most opposed.",2,The DVD is too biased,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,407,"['Let', 'face', 'asking', 'PBS', 'create', 'unbiased', 'overview', 'President', 'Reagan', 'time', 'office', 'asking', 'fox', 'critically', 'appraise', 'chicken', 'coop', 'security', 'DVD', 'miserly', 'appreciation', 'Reagan', 'accomplishments', 'history', 'support', 'current', 'left', 'wing', 'political', 'dynamics', 'would', 'view', 'rewrite', 'history', 'support', 'massive', 'expansion', 'government', 'most', 'opposed']",Reagan Presidency
1612297,A96B0X5VJV1T9,B00AJER3K2,Mark Twain,"[1, 8]",This is a fun look back over 30 years ago on Ronald Reagan's Presidency. Its Amazing how the policy's of back then still apply to today's issues. this video shows how we beat the Evil Empire by making them spend money they did not have to end the cold war. This also shows how Reagan was a great communicator with his back ground in Acting and radio when you see any President give a speech shows they are not like Reagan. Fun look back at History at a great President that made the 80s.,5,Fun History of Reagan,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,487,"['fun', 'look', 'back', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Presidency', 'Amazing', 'how', 'policy', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'apply', 'today', 'issues', 'video', 'how', 'beat', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'making', 'spend', 'money', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'end', 'cold', 'war', 'also', 'how', 'Reagan', 'was', 'great', 'communicator', 'back', 'ground', 'Acting', 'radio', 'when', 'see', 'President', 'give', 'speech', 'are', 'not', 'Reagan', 'Fun', 'look', 'back', 'History', 'great', 'President', 'made', '80s']",Reagan Presidency

1612299,A5IGFN80DBM9U,B00AJER3K2,Nurse Sandie,"[0, 3]","While I lived through the Reagan years, I was too young and ignorant to care about the politics of those years.  Even though I have only watched the first episode, I am glad for this series for documenting some of that era.  However, now that I am older and wide awake to the current administration and all of its politics, I can see that history repeats itself constantly.  Nothing ever changes unless you purposely set out to make it change.  Some have done that and made those changes  behind closed doors and have kept them covered up so no one would find out because they changed it, not to make it better, but to fit their agenda...even if it made it worse; and this current administration is guilty of doing that. But in order to make it change for the better you have to bring it out into the open.  Give it the &#34;test of fire&#34; by exposing it to the light and the truth.  When that happens it begins to take a turn for the better.  This series shows Reagan's decisions, either good or bad, coming to light.  You decide for yourself if they turned out for the better and changed history for the common good.",4,Remembering the past,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1121,"['lived', 'Reagan', 'years', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'ignorant', 'care', 'politics', 'years', 'Even', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'am', 'glad', 'series', 'documenting', 'era', 'However', 'now', 'am', 'older', 'wide', 'awake', 'current', 'administration', 'politics', 'can', 'see', 'history', 'constantly', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'changes', 'purposely', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'change', 'have', 'done', 'made', 'changes', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'have', 'kept', 'covered', 'up', 'so', 'no', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'out', 'changed', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'fit', 'agenda', 'even', 'made', 'worse', 'current', 'administration', 'guilty', 'doing', 'order', 'make', 'change', 'better', 'have', 'bring', 'out', 'open', 'Give', '34', 'test', 'fire', '34', 'exposing', 'light', 'truth', 'When', 'take', 'turn', 'better', 'series', 'Reagan', 'decisions', 'either', 'good', 'bad', 'coming', 'light', 'decide', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'changed', 'history', 'common', 'good']",Reagan Presidency
