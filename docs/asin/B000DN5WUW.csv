If Chinese soldiers occupied our country....we would fight back.If Chinese soldiers randomly fired their tanks by your home at 3am and started fires nearby for no reason...would you be upset?If Chinese soldiers broke into your local church and had intercourse on the floor....would you be upset?What this film does is cover both sides of the war....What everyone should watch after this film is 'Hubris, Selling the Iraq War'.  After you see the suffering of the Iraqi citizens and realize that we should have never been in Iraq.....The one thing that did not come up because the film was trying to be unbiased was the lack of leadership in our country at the time this war started.  One side lied about the WMD's and the other side were cowards and did not stand up to protest (some did).  We send men and women that are trained to kill and then are shocked when innocent people die.  This was a lack of leadership.We were the bulliesWe reacted out of fear",5,Great unbiased documentary,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1143,"['Ron', 'Paul', 'ran', 'commercial', 'YouTube', 'Republican', 'Primaries', 'asking', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'were', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'soldiers', 'were', 'doing', 'Iraqi', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'occupied', 'country', '.we', 'would', 'fight', 'back.If', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'randomly', 'fired', 'tanks', 'home', '3am', 'started', 'fires', 'nearby', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'broke', 'local', 'church', 'had', 'intercourse', 'floor', 'be', 'upset', 'What', 'film', 'cover', 'sides', 'war', '.What', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'film', ""'Hubris"", 'Selling', 'Iraq', 'War', 'see', 'suffering', 'Iraqi', 'citizens', 'realize', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Iraq', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'unbiased', 'was', 'lack', 'leadership', 'country', 'time', 'war', 'started', 'One', 'side', 'lied', 'WMD', 'other', 'side', 'were', 'cowards', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'protest', 'did', 'send', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'trained', 'kill', 'then', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'innocent', 'people', 'die', 'was', 'lack', 'leadership.We', 'were', 'bulliesWe', 'reacted', 'fear']",Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories

Mike Shiley did an excellent job of remaining unbiased. He's not a journalist in real life, he's an adventure traveler. The guy went into Iraq as a freelancer so he wasn't beholden to, or financed by, anybody.  He pointed his camera around the country and talked about what he saw. He was personable and funny in a way that 'real' journalists  aren't.  Several times during the showing we the audience laughed out loud.  I very much enjoyed getting a look at the Iraqi people. They are an attractive bunch, if I may say so. The children are darling little things, the young men and women are total hotties, and the older people look like people I'd like to get to know. We interviewed some soldiers and officers, rode in a tank on an ""Intimidate and Harrass"" mission, talked to some Kurds, got a glimpse of the easily accessible porn and armament, saw the results of a car bomb that detonated before its intended time. We watched a couple guys dig out land mines planted by Saddam and met some of the victims of the mines. We saw that the major force is most people's lives is simple economics - you need to be able to feed your family. As long as the insurgency pays better, more people will be insurgents. I found this show fascinating and  highly recommend it.",5,Loved this unbiased look at Iraq,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,1401,"['attending', 'showing', 'movie', 'director', 'talked', 'film', 'answered', 'questions', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Mike', 'Shiley', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'remaining', 'unbiased', 'not', 'journalist', 'real', 'life', 'adventure', 'traveler', 'guy', 'went', 'Iraq', 'freelancer', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'beholden', 'financed', 'anybody', 'pointed', 'camera', 'country', 'talked', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'personable', 'funny', 'way', ""'real"", 'journalists', 'are', ""n't"", 'Several', 'times', 'showing', 'audience', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'look', 'Iraqi', 'people', 'are', 'attractive', 'bunch', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'children', 'are', 'darling', 'little', 'things', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'total', 'hotties', 'older', 'people', 'look', 'people', ""'d"", 'like', 'get', 'know', 'interviewed', 'soldiers', 'officers', 'rode', 'tank', 'Intimidate', 'Harrass', 'mission', 'talked', 'Kurds', 'got', 'glimpse', 'easily', 'accessible', 'porn', 'armament', 'saw', 'results', 'car', 'bomb', 'detonated', 'intended', 'time', 'watched', 'couple', 'guys', 'dig', 'land', 'mines', 'planted', 'Saddam', 'met', 'victims', 'mines', 'saw', 'major', 'force', 'most', 'people', 'lives', 'simple', 'economics', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'feed', 'family', 'As', 'long', 'insurgency', 'better', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'insurgents', 'found', 'show', 'fascinating', 'highly', 'recommend']",Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories
963246,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000DN5WUW,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[14, 30]","Mike Shiley, almost on a whim, decides to take us inside Iraq.  He goes to places not normally traversed by professional journalists to get the ""real"" story.  Most western journalists in Iraq rarely (if ever) venture outside the Green Zone.  The possibility of ambush, being kidnapped and getting tortured / executed is just too great.Enter Shiley, someone who is not a professional journalist.  He takes us on a ""tour"" of the Iraq of today in the post-Saddam era.  He introduces us to Iraqis who love us (believe it or not, there are some) as well as those who loathe us (a higher percentage, I would say).While the DVD does not set out to bash the Bush administration, Shiley does implicity show just how badly Dubya has bungled this whole venture.  If the self-appointed geniuses who work for the Bush administration would take the time to watch this film, they just MIGHT be able to make decisions that are productive.  As it stands, Iraq will likely continue to be a stagnant quagmire due to the ignorance of the Bush administration and it's broken-record statement of ""Stay the course.""Beyond that, we see the human side of what's going on over there.  It is painful to watch in several instances.  We hear about American soldiers being killed on CNN on an almost daily basis.  That's bad enough, but what we don't normally hear about are all the Iraqis who are being massacred & caught in the crossfire.  Typically we only hear about Iraqi casualties if there is a spectacular attack.If you have an interest in what is REALLY going on in Iraq and wonder about the future of the Middle East, then I cannot endorse this movie highly enough.",5,Gripping...,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1645,"['Mike', 'Shiley', 'almost', 'whim', 'take', 'inside', 'Iraq', 'places', 'not', 'normally', 'traversed', 'professional', 'journalists', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'Most', 'western', 'journalists', 'Iraq', 'rarely', 'ever', 'venture', 'Green', 'Zone', 'possibility', 'ambush', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'getting', 'tortured', '/', 'executed', 'just', 'too', 'great.Enter', 'Shiley', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'professional', 'journalist', 'tour', 'Iraq', 'today', 'post-Saddam', 'era', 'Iraqis', 'who', 'love', 'believe', 'not', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'loathe', 'higher', 'percentage', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', 'not', 'set', 'out', 'bash', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Shiley', 'implicity', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'Dubya', 'bungled', 'whole', 'venture', 'self-appointed', 'geniuses', 'who', 'work', 'Bush', 'administration', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'decisions', 'are', 'productive', 'Iraq', 'will', 'likely', 'continue', 'be', 'stagnant', 'quagmire', 'due', 'ignorance', 'Bush', 'administration', 'broken-record', 'statement', 'Stay', 'course', 'see', 'human', 'side', 'what', 'going', 'there', 'painful', 'watch', 'several', 'instances', 'hear', 'American', 'soldiers', 'being', 'killed', 'CNN', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'bad', 'enough', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'hear', 'are', 'Iraqis', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'massacred', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'Typically', 'only', 'hear', 'Iraqi', 'casualties', 'spectacular', 'attack.If', 'have', 'interest', 'what', 'REALLY', 'going', 'Iraq', 'wonder', 'future', 'Middle', 'East', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'endorse', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough']",Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories

The military personel are shown as individuals that offer a gamut of behavior/emotion.I chose to read all the reviews 'after the fact' instead of before watching the video.
