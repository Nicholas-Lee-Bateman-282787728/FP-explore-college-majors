1332977,AOB5695UUUJ0,B0038Q9QB2,"Anime Lover ""D""","[2, 2]","In the far future, people have left earth to colonize other planets.  And on two planets, men and women not only live on different worlds, but they also are mortal enemies.  On the eve of the launch of a new mens battleship, a lowly worker sneaks aboard on a dare.  And while he does that, pirates from the female planet board and steal the ship.  And while they are doing that, our hapless worker meets Dita a journeyman pirate pilot who is excited about meeting her first ""alien"".  as she chases him around, a new enemy appears and attacks both sides and the ship decides to warp them to saftey.  when that happens three of the female fighters and one of the mens mechs are transformed into new fighting machines able to merge into new combinations of destruction.  of course now the fun part is how a ship of women and a few guys are going to get back to their homeworlds, without killing each other or having the enemy do it for them.the animation was sharp, especially  during the combat sequences.  the characters are full of life and the story moves at a good pace, the interaction of the men and women start out as bitter enemies to working as a group and possibly more.  the story was well developed and the history develops at a good pace (the reason why the men and women are on different planets is hilarious, and the true id of the enemy is a real eye opener).  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with action and a bit of romance.  Enjoy.",5,Enjoyable to the end,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,1471,"['far', 'future', 'people', 'have', 'left', 'earth', 'colonize', 'other', 'planets', 'two', 'planets', 'men', 'women', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'different', 'worlds', 'also', 'are', 'mortal', 'enemies', 'eve', 'launch', 'new', 'mens', 'battleship', 'lowly', 'worker', 'aboard', 'dare', 'female', 'planet', 'board', 'steal', 'ship', 'are', 'doing', 'hapless', 'worker', 'meets', 'Dita', 'journeyman', 'pirate', 'pilot', 'who', 'excited', 'meeting', 'first', 'alien', 'around', 'new', 'enemy', 'sides', 'ship', 'warp', 'saftey', 'when', 'three', 'female', 'fighters', 'one', 'mens', 'mechs', 'are', 'transformed', 'new', 'fighting', 'machines', 'able', 'merge', 'new', 'combinations', 'destruction', 'course', 'now', 'fun', 'part', 'how', 'ship', 'women', 'few', 'guys', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'back', 'homeworlds', 'killing', 'other', 'having', 'enemy', 'do', 'them.the', 'animation', 'was', 'sharp', 'especially', 'combat', 'sequences', 'characters', 'are', 'full', 'life', 'story', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'interaction', 'men', 'women', 'start', 'out', 'as', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'working', 'group', 'possibly', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'developed', 'history', 'good', 'pace', 'reason', 'why', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'different', 'planets', 'hilarious', 'true', 'id', 'enemy', 'real', 'eye', 'opener', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'action', 'bit', 'romance', 'Enjoy']",Vandread: The Ultimate Collection

I enjoyed it and the ending was just the right touch.The only thing I didn't like was the OVA disk. Having to read subtitles for me takes me away from working on other things I do while watching a DVD. Since my players are in the Living Room, I feed the output from them to both the TV and computer in the front computer room so I can watch movies there too. This allows me to watch a good movie, etc. and work on computer related items at the same time. With a subtitled DVD, I have to ""glue"" to the monitor and that sort of takes away from other things I've doing. (Besides good titles SHOULD be watched more than once anyway.) That's my only complain re this DVD set. This OVA would have made an excellent way to watch a summary of the series if time was a consideration except for the subtitles.Well worth the money otherwise.",4,Another Good DVD To My Collection,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,879,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'OVA', 'disk', 'Having', 'read', 'subtitles', 'away', 'working', 'other', 'things', 'do', 'watching', 'DVD', 'players', 'are', 'Living', 'Room', 'feed', 'output', 'both', 'TV', 'computer', 'front', 'computer', 'room', 'can', 'watch', 'movies', 'there', 'too', 'watch', 'good', 'movie', 'etc', 'work', 'computer', 'related', 'items', 'same', 'time', 'subtitled', 'DVD', 'have', 'glue', 'monitor', 'sort', 'away', 'other', 'things', ""'ve"", 'doing', 'good', 'titles', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'anyway', 'only', 'complain', 're', 'DVD', 'set', 'OVA', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'way', 'watch', 'summary', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'consideration', 'subtitles.Well', 'money', 'otherwise']",Vandread: The Ultimate Collection
1332979,A2AT08TWXCEUDR,B0038Q9QB2,djfullshred,"[0, 0]","This show surprised me a little because I had zero expectations, but cam away impressed. Story is as presposterous as any sci fi anime, but charatcers are very likable & that's really what kept me watching. This is mostly campy fun with some moments of drama added in (they are in a war after all). The basic premise is men & women have split completely to live on different planets, and are at war with each other. A group of men are captured by a women's warship. After showing some usefulness, they end up working for the women, but are still prisoners to them.The character Dita stands out as most endearing to me. She has a naive childlike innocence, but more open to her feelings than the rest of the characters. This makes for some great interaction between her & clueless male character Hibiki, who is quite rude to her & doesn't get this male-female relationship thing. The only thing he has been taught about women is they are men's sworn enemy. It is touching and sweet to see Dita trying to win over Hibiki by making little gifts for him, only to get her feelings hurt when our clueless dude doesn't show any appreciation...but we later see how one of these silly little presents seems to have some importance to him. Will Hibiki come around and realize what a precious person Dita is to him, or will he remain a women hating warrior? I'll stop here, and let the viewers find out for themselves.",4,Fun action with heart,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,1407,"['show', 'surprised', 'little', 'had', 'zero', 'expectations', 'away', 'impressed', 'Story', 'as', 'presposterous', 'sci', 'fi', 'anime', 'charatcers', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'really', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'mostly', 'campy', 'fun', 'moments', 'drama', 'added', 'are', 'war', 'basic', 'premise', 'men', 'women', 'have', 'split', 'completely', 'live', 'different', 'planets', 'are', 'war', 'other', 'group', 'men', 'are', 'captured', 'women', 'warship', 'showing', 'usefulness', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'women', 'are', 'still', 'prisoners', 'them.The', 'character', 'Dita', 'out', 'most', 'endearing', 'naive', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'more', 'open', 'feelings', 'rest', 'characters', 'great', 'interaction', 'clueless', 'male', 'character', 'Hibiki', 'who', 'quite', 'rude', ""n't"", 'get', 'male-female', 'relationship', 'thing', 'only', 'thing', 'been', 'taught', 'women', 'are', 'men', 'sworn', 'enemy', 'touching', 'sweet', 'see', 'Dita', 'trying', 'win', 'over', 'Hibiki', 'making', 'little', 'gifts', 'only', 'get', 'feelings', 'hurt', 'when', 'clueless', 'dude', ""n't"", 'show', 'appreciation', 'later', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'silly', 'little', 'presents', 'have', 'importance', 'Will', 'Hibiki', 'come', 'around', 'realize', 'what', 'precious', 'person', 'Dita', 'will', 'remain', 'women', 'hating', 'warrior', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'let', 'viewers', 'find', 'out']",Vandread: The Ultimate Collection
