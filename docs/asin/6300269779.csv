Two the characters as with most of Bakshi's work are nothing more than archetypes. They don't stretch out beyond their own limitations which is frustrating. And just quite frankly the story just stinks. Truly one of his lesser works. If you want to see a real Bakshi masterpiece take a gander at American Pop. Now that's a movie.,2,Not as GOOD as I remembered...,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,409,"['First', 'music', 'not', 'relative', 'times', 'movie', 'trying', 'depict', 'Two', 'characters', 'most', 'Bakshi', 'work', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'archetypes', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'out', 'own', 'limitations', 'frustrating', 'just', 'quite', 'frankly', 'story', 'just', 'stinks', 'Truly', 'one', 'lesser', 'works', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'Bakshi', 'masterpiece', 'take', 'gander', 'American', 'Pop', 'Now', 'movie']",N/A
235322,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6300269779,Andre Dursin,"[3, 3]","Animator Ralph Bakshi's feature films are a wildly uneven assortment of psychedelic colors, ethnic stereotypes and ribald humor - elements of which haven't quite translated into the 21st century. After breaking out with ""Fritz the Cat"" and ""Heavy Traffic,"" Bakshi found himself being courted by major studios, but two of his subsequent projects - ""Coonskin,"" produced for Paramount, and the Warner Bros.-backed ""Hey Good Lookin'"" - would end up being shuttled off to another studio in the case of the former and delayed for years in the case of the latter.In fact, HEY GOOD LOOKIN' (75 mins., 1982, R) was originally produced as a live-action/animated mix in the mid `70s. According to reports, indifferent test screenings and the controversy over ""Coonskin"" caused Warner to shelve the project for years, during which time Bakshi generated box-office paydirt with ""Wizards"" and his ""Lord of the Rings"" animated adaptation. Looking to capitalize on the latter's success, Warner opted to dump ""Hey Good Lookin'""s live-action footage and have the film fully animated. The resulting feature was finally completed in 1982, a year after Columbia's release of ""American Pop,"" one of Bakshi's most satisfying features.""Hey Good Lookin'"" doesn't rate as one of Bakshi's better films, yet this tale of a Brooklyn greaser and his various adventures in the mid `50s has its moments - including an opening conversation between two pieces of trash (!), a wild finale, and a tuneful song-soundtrack by Ric Sandler and John Madara that's the best thing in the film. Of course, the movie also includes some grotesquely drawn stereotypes and humor that often misses the mark; like a lot of Bakshi's work, ""Hey Good Lookin'"" isn't going to be for every taste, and overall, ranks as a minor work from the controversial animator. Still, for adventurous viewers, the movie is worth seeing, as are many of the filmmaker's audacious attempts at using the artform as a vehicle for adult storytelling - especially at a time when Bakshi was one of the only animators trying to do so.Making its first appearance on home video since a VHS release in the `80s, ""Hey Good Lookin'"" is presented in its 77-minute 1982 version. Although Bakshi's original `70s version remains in the Warner vaults (and it's a shame the studio didn't see fit to releasing it here), fans will have to make due with this DVD presentation for the moment, and it's certainly a solid presentation, enhanced for 16:9 televisions. The print shows its age at times but generally conveys the spectrum of colors in Bakshi's animation; the original trailer, comprised of just one scene of ""Vinnie"" using Vitalis, is the sole extra.",3,"Uneven, Worth Seeing for Bakshi Fans",1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,2669,"['Animator', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'assortment', 'psychedelic', 'colors', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'ribald', 'humor', 'elements', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'translated', '21st', 'century', 'breaking', 'out', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'Heavy', 'Traffic', 'Bakshi', 'found', 'being', 'courted', 'major', 'studios', 'two', 'subsequent', 'projects', 'Coonskin', 'produced', 'Paramount', 'Warner', 'Bros.-backed', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'shuttled', 'off', 'studio', 'case', 'former', 'delayed', 'years', 'case', 'latter.In', 'fact', 'HEY', 'GOOD', 'LOOKIN', '75', 'mins.', '1982', 'R', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'live-action/animated', 'mix', 'mid', '70s', 'According', 'reports', 'indifferent', 'test', 'screenings', 'controversy', 'Coonskin', 'caused', 'Warner', 'shelve', 'project', 'years', 'time', 'Bakshi', 'generated', 'box-office', 'paydirt', 'Wizards', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Looking', 'capitalize', 'latter', 'success', 'Warner', 'opted', 'dump', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', 'live-action', 'footage', 'have', 'film', 'fully', 'animated', 'resulting', 'feature', 'was', 'finally', 'completed', '1982', 'year', 'Columbia', 'release', 'American', 'Pop', 'one', 'Bakshi', 'most', 'satisfying', 'features', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', ""n't"", 'rate', 'one', 'Bakshi', 'better', 'films', 'yet', 'tale', 'Brooklyn', 'greaser', 'various', 'adventures', 'mid', '50s', 'moments', 'including', 'opening', 'conversation', 'two', 'pieces', 'trash', 'wild', 'finale', 'tuneful', 'song-soundtrack', 'Ric', 'Sandler', 'John', 'Madara', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'grotesquely', 'drawn', 'stereotypes', 'humor', 'often', 'mark', 'lot', 'Bakshi', 'work', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'taste', 'overall', 'ranks', 'minor', 'work', 'controversial', 'animator', 'Still', 'adventurous', 'viewers', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'many', 'filmmaker', 'audacious', 'attempts', 'using', 'artform', 'vehicle', 'adult', 'storytelling', 'especially', 'time', 'when', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'animators', 'trying', 'do', 'so.Making', 'first', 'appearance', 'home', 'video', 'VHS', 'release', '80s', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', 'presented', '77-minute', '1982', 'version', 'Bakshi', 'original', '70s', 'version', 'Warner', 'vaults', 'shame', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fit', 'releasing', 'here', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'due', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'moment', 'certainly', 'solid', 'presentation', 'enhanced', '16:9', 'televisions', 'print', 'age', 'times', 'generally', 'spectrum', 'colors', 'Bakshi', 'animation', 'original', 'trailer', 'comprised', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'Vinnie', 'using', 'Vitalis', 'sole', 'extra']",N/A

Artwork is great. at least they use original poster art. Now the quality here is, or seems to be stricken from an original negetive, It is sharp and colors are strong, specially crazy's red hair. But the transfer is plaqued with constant little white specs throughout, but oh well, you will get use to it. At least its sharp and miles better than whats on you tube now. Also intresting is that we get the original warner bros logo at the beginning which makes me thinks its from an old film element, not a direct copy from a later pressing VHS.
