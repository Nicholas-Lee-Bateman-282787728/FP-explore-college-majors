No words, just a lot of hijinks and sound effects.  Every episode is well done, funny and less than five minutes long.  The series is named after Shaun the sheep from Wallace & Gromit's ""A Close Shave,"" which is found onWallace and Gromit: Three Amazing Adventures.There's a baby sheep on the show named ""Timmy"" and he's always got a binky in his mouth.  He also goes missing in a few episodes and a frantic, comedic search by the other sheep always ensues.  The ""Little Sheep of Horrors"" episode is top notch example.You won't be disappointed with this show.",5,Shaun does it again.

1263082,A205NEEKCQY4F8,B002D755B2,Tycereom,"[0, 0]","""Shaun the Sheep: Little Sheep of Horrors"" is the fourth DVD release of episodes of ""Shaun the Sheep"". It has 6 episodes, where Shaun and the other sheep get into adventures. I did not enjoy this fourth DVD as much as the first and second, because the comedy has become a bit broad. As TV shows age, they tend to become too over the top, like Fonzie jumping the shark in ""Happy Days"". Cartoons need to follow some set of rules to be entertaining, like cartoonist Chuck Jones imposing the rule that the Road Runner could only run on roads. In this fourth DVD, I felt that Shaun and his fellow sheep could now do anything for the sake of comedy, and weren't following any rules. The DVD includes two simple games, suitable for young children, but I also found them pretty amusing.
