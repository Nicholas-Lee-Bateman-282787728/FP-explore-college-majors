I ordered this with several other films.  The packet states that it has English closed captions.However, it does not and I was unable to watch the movie because of this.I really wish that DVD companies would learn what the word ""closed captioned"" means before putting it on their DVDs.  I also wish they would remember to put the English captions on.This is about the 10th time that I have bought a film and found out that it isn't captioned despite having the ""CC"" signature or the ""Closed captioned"" phrase on the back cover.  Why can't DVD companies remember to put the captions on when they have it on their ""Extras"" list on the back of the DVD cover????I have to say that experiencing this error several times has really made me appreciate the good DVD companies that actually do put the closed captions on their DVDs.",1,BIG error on DVD packaging from the company!,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,958,"['DVD', 'receiving', 'negative', 'review', 'not', 'film', 'service.It', 'DVD', 'company', 'ordered', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'packet', 'English', 'closed', 'captions.However', 'not', 'was', 'unable', 'watch', 'movie', 'this.I', 'really', 'wish', 'DVD', 'companies', 'would', 'learn', 'what', 'word', 'closed', 'captioned', 'putting', 'DVDs', 'also', 'wish', 'would', 'remember', 'put', 'English', 'captions', 'on.This', '10th', 'time', 'have', 'bought', 'film', 'found', 'out', ""n't"", 'captioned', 'having', 'CC', 'signature', 'Closed', 'captioned', 'phrase', 'back', 'cover', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'companies', 'remember', 'put', 'captions', 'when', 'have', 'Extras', 'list', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'have', 'say', 'experiencing', 'error', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'made', 'appreciate', 'good', 'DVD', 'companies', 'actually', 'do', 'put', 'closed', 'captions', 'DVDs']",Maid Of Honor

Well, ""Maid of Honor"" might be just the flick for you.  Surprisingly poignant and filled with superior character development, ""Maid of Honor"" is an above-average psychological thriller.Unloved and plain, Lacey is an ""old maid"" who lives with her brother-in-law, Richard, and his two children after the death of her sister.  Aunt Lacey is a superb cook and a wonderful caregiver.  However, lurking underneath the kind veneer is an obsessed and manipulative individual.  Smoldering with hidden passion for Richard, Lacey will stop at nothing to get what she desires.""Maid of Honor"" is presented in an engaging and suspenseful way, and the actors/actresses are excellent in their roles.  Linda Pearl, who portrays Lacey, brings poignancy and depth to a role that could have been two-dimensional, and the viewer feels a small degree of sympathy toward her.  The scenes with Richard's little boy, Danny, are chilling as Pearl's character sews seeds of doubt into the youngster's heart.  Linden Ashby is excellent in his portrayal of Richard.If you're searching for a sutle thriller that probs the psychological depths of its characters, then please give this movie a chance.
