The thing that is most interesting about it is that it seems to document both the birth and death of the entire Punk Rock spirit as it existed in England all in 100 minutes.The whole ""story"" is told very simply and as clearly as it can be.  We see a small group of people having fun and expressing themselves in new ways grow into a very large group of people who buy into the whole ""look and feel"" of the movement as a trend, and through it all, we get anecdotes about how the members of the Sex Pistols fit into the whole thing... from their first gig to the very last.. all the way to the death of Sid.I think anyone interested in music would enjoy this movie.  I don't mind that the concert footage is overdubbed, or that the songs are interrupted with ""chatter"" as one reviewer stated.  After all, that ""chatter"" is why i bought the movie in the first place.  I knew i wasn't buying a concert film.But, it would be very cool to have another film comprised of nothing but that concert footage uninterrupted, and without musical overdubs as a companion dvd.",4,a good documentary,1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,1337,"['i', 'saw', 'film', 'i', 'knew', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'was', 'what', 'i', 'heard', 'albums', 'Bollocks', 'R', 'R', 'swindle', 'stories', 'here', 'there', 'seem', 'mostly', 'exaggerated', 'fit', 'legendary', 'punk', 'rock', 'god', 'status.So', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'thing', 'most', 'interesting', 'document', 'birth', 'death', 'entire', 'Punk', 'Rock', 'spirit', 'existed', 'England', '100', 'minutes.The', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'simply', 'as', 'clearly', 'can', 'be', 'see', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'having', 'fun', 'expressing', 'new', 'ways', 'grow', 'very', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'whole', 'look', 'feel', 'movement', 'trend', 'get', 'anecdotes', 'how', 'members', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'fit', 'whole', 'thing', 'first', 'gig', 'very', 'last..', 'way', 'death', 'Sid.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'interested', 'music', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'concert', 'footage', 'overdubbed', 'songs', 'are', 'interrupted', 'chatter', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'chatter', 'why', 'i', 'bought', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'knew', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'concert', 'film.But', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'cool', 'have', 'film', 'comprised', 'nothing', 'concert', 'footage', 'uninterrupted', 'musical', 'overdubs', 'companion', 'dvd']",N/A

It won 3 awards in 2000 as best documentary in Chicago, Sao Paolo, and the Online Film Critics Society Awards.The movie depicts the history of one of the most controversial Rock bands ever: The Sex Pistols. This DVD is a widescreen version of the film and features an audio commentary by director Julien Temple. The story of the band is told chronologically, and we get to see some of the members of the band telling us their own point of view of their contribution to the band and what happened during the 26 months the band lasted. There is a lot of controversy about the figure of Sid Vicious, who was found dead (by overdose or suicide, or was it just the same?) after being charged for the murder of his partner Nancy. One of the things I like the most about the movie is the Extra Documentary ""Un-Defining Punk: An In Depth Examination of the Punk Movement"", a 35 minute long documentary that gives us a very good deep analysis of what punk was.I recommend this movie to anybody who likes pop culture, the history of Rock, and more especifically, to punk fans and anybody who likes transgression in Art in any form. The movie is rated R, which is a pity because it can't be shown to teenagers who would benefit a lot from watching it.P.S. If you like my review vote YES.

Maybe it would be of interest to the aspiring American consumer stereotypes that much of Simon Cowell's ubersnob delivery can be attributed to Pistol's head snarler Johnny Rotten.  Their curiosity peaked, they drop it in and discover the Amercian consumer's lifestyle is under bombardment, even though the Filth's recollecting anti- establishment and chaos in the 70's.Remarkably, one of the instant revelatory moments in this film is how up to date the Pistols look compared to the ridiculously vomitous slabs of polyesteryear fashions their supposedly hip hosts were wearing during the old interview clips.  What's more, this is exactly what Lydon (Rotten) hates the most about the Pistols legacy: the mall culture they so deplored finds ""punk fashion"" cool and watered it down to flavorless damp 4/4-time whining while doing nothing to deconstruct the world into a better place.  This is also where the Pistols couldn't last.  They were too messed up to fix a world they wanted to destroy.  Rotten remains gloriously disgusted throughout the film often leaving your Mom and Dad (who grew up familiar with the Pistols and continously failing to understand them) wondering why he's still in it (to give bollocky pissoff to mums and dads of course).The other Pistols will continue to provide vigor towards their old antics in rollickingly funny interviews.  The serious viewer will understand that Chaos was their goal and not making punk fashionable.  And if the soccer mom and Nextel Cup Pops take a second or two to think about how this film and the Chaos that was the Pistols' true legacy are meant to affect them..just imagine..perhaps the world may be a little more dangerous, but it won't be boring and we won't feel cheated.",5,Never Mind Anything Here's the Sex Pistols,1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,2320,"['Somewhere', 'Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs', 'suburbs', 'soccer', 'mom', 'just', 'unloaded', 'brood', 'match', 'Soccer-mom', '7-3', 'shift', 'office', 'now', 'go', 'home', 'help', 'digital-literate', 'Nascar', 'dad', 'dinner', 'hope', 'kids', 'are', 'home', 'plates', 'are', 'dishwasher', 'time', 'American', 'Idull', 'only', 'find', 'friend', 'friend', 'copy', 'Filth', 'Fury', 'laying', 'about', 'daring', 'pop', 'player', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'swoon', 'syrup', 'drip', 'balladeer', 'over-singing', 'supper', 'club', 'karoake', 'standards', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'interest', 'aspiring', 'American', 'consumer', 'stereotypes', 'much', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'ubersnob', 'delivery', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'Pistol', 'head', 'snarler', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'curiosity', 'peaked', 'drop', 'discover', 'Amercian', 'consumer', 'lifestyle', 'bombardment', 'even', 'Filth', 'recollecting', 'anti-', 'establishment', 'chaos', ""70's.Remarkably"", 'one', 'instant', 'revelatory', 'moments', 'film', 'how', 'up', 'date', 'Pistols', 'look', 'compared', 'ridiculously', 'vomitous', 'slabs', 'polyesteryear', 'fashions', 'supposedly', 'hip', 'hosts', 'were', 'wearing', 'old', 'interview', 'clips', 'What', 'more', 'exactly', 'what', 'Lydon', 'Rotten', 'most', 'Pistols', 'legacy', 'mall', 'culture', 'so', 'deplored', 'finds', 'punk', 'fashion', 'cool', 'watered', 'down', 'flavorless', 'damp', '4/4-time', 'whining', 'doing', 'nothing', 'deconstruct', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'also', 'where', 'Pistols', 'could', ""n't"", 'last', 'were', 'too', 'messed', 'up', 'fix', 'world', 'wanted', 'destroy', 'Rotten', 'gloriously', 'disgusted', 'film', 'often', 'leaving', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'familiar', 'Pistols', 'continously', 'failing', 'understand', 'wondering', 'why', 'still', 'give', 'bollocky', 'pissoff', 'mums', 'dads', 'course', 'other', 'Pistols', 'will', 'continue', 'provide', 'vigor', 'towards', 'old', 'antics', 'rollickingly', 'funny', 'interviews', 'serious', 'viewer', 'will', 'understand', 'Chaos', 'was', 'goal', 'not', 'making', 'punk', 'fashionable', 'soccer', 'mom', 'Nextel', 'Cup', 'Pops', 'take', 'second', 'two', 'think', 'how', 'film', 'Chaos', 'was', 'Pistols', 'true', 'legacy', 'are', 'meant', 'affect', 'them..just', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'dangerous', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'boring', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated']",N/A
525114,A2H3TGP5WIJNHK,B00003CXHL,"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com""","[5, 6]","From formation in a fetish store in late 1975 to implosion in San Francisco in 1978, the Sex Pistols were the Bashi-Bazouks of punk music, bringing the sound to millions of listeners.  They came to embody the movement, whether as music of working class rage or songs of snotty adolescent rebellion.The members' personalities were wildly different, fistfights were frequent and the Pistols replaced Glen Matlock, their bassist and best songwriter, with Sid Vicious, a sad heroin addict who literally could not play his instrument, in early 1977.  The band was only together for 26 months, and to paraphrase Gibbon, we should ask not why it broke up but why it lasted so long.The film's answer, basically, is the Pistols had nowhere else to go.  Guitarist Steve Jones says he hated playing guitar in early rehearsals but stuck with it because he didn't have anything else.  It took Vicious' slide in heroin addiction and manager Malcolm McLaren's mismanagement to finally lead to the last concert, where singer Johnny Rotten said, more with weariness than contempt, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""""The Filth and the Fury"" is an enjoyable, interesting piece that puts the Pistols in the context of their times.  It makes a few bold sallies toward objectivity (for the band's reputation as a scream against the British establishment, Jones says he didn't know who the PM was and just wanted sex) but is essentially hero worship, as all rock documentaries are.That's not necessarily a problem, but the movie strongly suggests the whole of England was against the Pistols, which not only downplays the support they had from music critics who were as sick of Emerson, Lake and Palmer as they were but suggests punk was being listened to all over the country. In reality, it had something more than a cult following, but not much; the fear of punk gaining a broader audience drove much of the opposition documented here.Director Julien Temple, in his otherwise awful DVD commentary, points out he made ""The Great Rock N' Roll Swindle"" in 1979 to dispel some of the hero worship the band had developed, thought it went too far and made ""Filth"" as a corrective.  OK.  But the movie puts the Pistols back on their pedestals, which means their influences (Alice Cooper, the Modern Lovers, the New York Dolls) and more durable bands like The Clash suffer in comparison.  You'd think punk owed everything to the Pistols after seeing this, and that ain't the case.That said, it would take a filmmaker of rare incompetence to make the Pistols' meteoric story boring, and Temple has gift for both narrative and humor.  Rotten has one ego trip too many in his interview, but both he and the other members of the band provide new insights and details about the Pistols' troubled life.  McLaren is heard only through audio he recorded for ""Swindle,"" and it may be unfair, but the evidence doesn't weigh well in his favor.  You get to see footage of ""Who Killed Bambi?"" the lousy film the Pistols did (with an appearance by Sting) and a previously unseen 1978 interview with Vicious, who speaks with a surly eloquence.It's great storytelling about a singular moment in time.  The Pistols may have an importance out of proportion to their recorded legacy, but ""Filth"" does justice to their peculiar place in music.",4,The Pistols back on their pedestals,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,3304,"['formation', 'fetish', 'store', 'late', '1975', 'implosion', 'San', 'Francisco', '1978', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'were', 'Bashi-Bazouks', 'punk', 'music', 'bringing', 'sound', 'millions', 'listeners', 'came', 'embody', 'movement', 'music', 'working', 'class', 'rage', 'songs', 'snotty', 'adolescent', 'rebellion.The', 'members', 'personalities', 'were', 'wildly', 'different', 'fistfights', 'were', 'frequent', 'Pistols', 'replaced', 'Glen', 'Matlock', 'bassist', 'best', 'songwriter', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'sad', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'literally', 'could', 'not', 'play', 'instrument', 'early', '1977', 'band', 'was', 'only', 'together', '26', 'months', 'paraphrase', 'Gibbon', 'should', 'ask', 'not', 'why', 'broke', 'up', 'why', 'lasted', 'so', 'long.The', 'film', 'answer', 'basically', 'Pistols', 'had', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'Guitarist', 'Steve', 'Jones', 'hated', 'playing', 'guitar', 'early', 'rehearsals', 'stuck', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'else', 'took', 'Vicious', 'slide', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'manager', 'Malcolm', 'McLaren', 'mismanagement', 'finally', 'lead', 'last', 'concert', 'where', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'said', 'more', 'weariness', 'contempt', 'Ever', 'get', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cheated', 'Filth', 'Fury', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'piece', 'Pistols', 'context', 'times', 'few', 'bold', 'sallies', 'objectivity', 'band', 'reputation', 'scream', 'British', 'establishment', 'Jones', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'PM', 'was', 'just', 'wanted', 'sex', 'essentially', 'hero', 'worship', 'rock', 'are.That', 'not', 'necessarily', 'problem', 'movie', 'strongly', 'whole', 'England', 'was', 'Pistols', 'not', 'only', 'support', 'had', 'music', 'critics', 'who', 'were', 'sick', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'were', 'punk', 'was', 'being', 'listened', 'country', 'reality', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'not', 'much', 'fear', 'punk', 'gaining', 'broader', 'audience', 'drove', 'much', 'opposition', 'documented', 'here.Director', 'Julien', 'Temple', 'otherwise', 'awful', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'points', 'out', 'made', 'Great', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'Swindle', '1979', 'dispel', 'hero', 'worship', 'band', 'had', 'developed', 'thought', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'made', 'Filth', 'corrective', 'OK', 'movie', 'Pistols', 'back', 'pedestals', 'influences', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Modern', 'Lovers', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'more', 'durable', 'bands', 'Clash', 'suffer', 'comparison', ""'d"", 'think', 'punk', 'owed', 'everything', 'Pistols', 'seeing', 'ai', ""n't"", 'case.That', 'said', 'would', 'take', 'filmmaker', 'rare', 'incompetence', 'make', 'Pistols', 'meteoric', 'story', 'boring', 'Temple', 'gift', 'narrative', 'humor', 'Rotten', 'one', 'ego', 'trip', 'too', 'many', 'interview', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'provide', 'new', 'insights', 'details', 'Pistols', 'troubled', 'life', 'McLaren', 'heard', 'only', 'audio', 'recorded', 'Swindle', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'evidence', ""n't"", 'weigh', 'well', 'favor', 'get', 'see', 'footage', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Bambi', 'lousy', 'film', 'Pistols', 'did', 'appearance', 'Sting', 'previously', 'unseen', '1978', 'interview', 'Vicious', 'who', 'surly', 'eloquence.It', 'great', 'storytelling', 'singular', 'moment', 'time', 'Pistols', 'may', 'have', 'importance', 'proportion', 'recorded', 'legacy', 'Filth', 'justice', 'peculiar', 'place', 'music']",N/A

525116,A3DSTOJPRMV674,B00003CXHL,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[38, 49]","OK, watched the Sex Pistols documentary ""The Filth and the Fury."" A recent flick, it came out in 2000 and interviewed the surviving members of the Pistols, though they were but silhouettes residing in the comfort of midlife homes. It's an extraordinary documentary detailing the rise of punk and the brief life of the Sex Pistols. They played but for two years, banned, hated and vilified. The documentary ends appropriately enough during their final show with Sid Vicious in San Francisco, with Johnny Rotten sadly sneering to the audience, ""Do you ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""I suppose everyone is familiar with the legend of the Sex Pistols, and if you're not, this documentary is as good a place to start as any. What I liked about ""The Filth and the Fury"" was how accurately it detailed the conditions in England that gave rise to punk music and fashion. Americans love to claim everything as their own, and the Ramones have certainly carried that ""punk creation"" torch to their graves. But ""The Filth and the Fury"" slaps everyone back into reality. The Sex Pistols were the first, and that LP ""Never Mind the Bullocks"" echoes down through generations as crystal clear as a golden coin.After watching this documentary and listening to their album, I am amazed how contemporary the Sex Pistols are. Much of the music that followed, The Clash, The Misfits, The Circle Jerks, even U2, feels oddly dated today, a testament of the decade of the 1980s. But place the Sex Pistols on the air, and blasting from the speakers is incredible anger and energy, as profound and timeless as ""A Clockwork Orange."" The music has aged well, and one never blushes when listening to it.Watching the documentary, I was amazed how modern the members of the band looked, interviewed by 70s fashion victims adorned in wide lapels, offensive plaid and flared pants. These reporters, attempting to make sense, were as befuddled as JFK assassination reporters, trying to nurture terrified audiences. The sad fact, and one which is detailed in ""The Filth and the Fury,"" is that the band eventually became a freak show, the music forgotten or lost by the time they wearily limped on stage in San Francisco.The footage which haunts and terrifies, is of the Sex Pistols playing their infamous 1978 tour through the southern United States. Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta, Memphis, long-haired crowds resembling frightened Bob Seegers. Audiences threw trash on the stage, beer bottles at Sid Vicious' face, and yet the band played on, realizing that America was a scary place......""Throw what you want at me, I'm not leaving this stage!""Can you imagine a band like the Sex Pistols playing here today? They would get lynched. American music writers wax poetic about the Sex Pistols' cruise through Texas and the south. But we see footage of the San Antonio and Dallas shows, people standing as stark as statues, terrified of what they were witnessing. The echoes of those concerts carry through to today, profound and horrifying. For the Sex Pistols to have embarked through the southern U.S. with that incredibly blatant brand of rebellion was almost suicidal. They cut a path through a dense forest of a conservative Urban Cowboy rocker wastelands. The wake splashes today.The Sex Pistols band died young, no doubt. They have but one album, and a lot of haunting film footage. But to watch them in this documentary during their prime, fiercely screaming ""Anarchy in the UK,"" ""God Save the Queen"" and ""Bodies,"" is to see the ultimate example of what the musical form known as rock represents.

525118,AZ9N53LAUMWES,B00003CXHL,Commish,"[1, 1]","Rarely have I viewed such an honestly documented interview with any band available on video. The Sex Pistols' singer, Johnny Rotten (now Lydon) is well known for his notorious intolerance of the music establishment, the class system and authority in general (with perhaps, a little more emphasis on the British monarchy). He's in his 50's now, and I was very interested, almost startled, to listen to his views on music, the hypocrisy of the media, and his deeply loyal friendship to Sid Vicious, which was expressed in a rare expression of emotion. He has since become a television personality, appearing on talk shows and at media events in both the United States and the UK. I found him especially witty and fiercly truthful, which was a standout in this film for me, as I'm just not used to such soulful honesty in what has become a music industry cesspool of spoiled brats, addicts, and sexually confused ""popstars"". Lydon calls it like it is, and I really admired everything he had to say. The other high point of the film is the unusually large amount of footage attributed to Sid Vicious. We see him ""smacked up"" most of the time, but there are several spots (with his crazy girlfriend noticably absent) when he lucidly explains his own frustrations up to the point in time he was being interviewed. All but Sid are hidden in the shadows of strategically positioned studio lighting, which aids in giving the surviving members a sense of immortality, yet raising up their fallen band mate out of the shadows for all to clearly see in living color, and most of the time, it ain't pretty. There are important video clips of the performers during the punk madness of their heydey in the late '70's that I've not seen before, and this was really special for me. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys the historical relevance of documentaries, such as this one, where a point in time is stopped for all to see - sometimes not glorious or flattering - yet, at other times, soulful and honest. Listening to a more mature group of Pistols; especially the witty articulation of Lydon's anecdotes and recollections, makes for an immensely enjoyable and interesting look into the souls of this seminal punk rock band.",5,An Honest Documentary Peering into the Souls of the Pistols,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2224,"['Rarely', 'have', 'viewed', 'honestly', 'documented', 'interview', 'band', 'available', 'video', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'now', 'Lydon', 'well', 'known', 'notorious', 'intolerance', 'music', 'establishment', 'class', 'system', 'authority', 'general', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'emphasis', 'British', 'monarchy', '50', 'now', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'almost', 'startled', 'listen', 'views', 'music', 'hypocrisy', 'media', 'deeply', 'loyal', 'friendship', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'was', 'expressed', 'rare', 'expression', 'emotion', 'become', 'television', 'personality', 'appearing', 'talk', 'shows', 'media', 'events', 'United', 'States', 'UK', 'found', 'especially', 'witty', 'fiercly', 'truthful', 'was', 'standout', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'used', 'such', 'soulful', 'honesty', 'what', 'become', 'music', 'industry', 'cesspool', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'addicts', 'sexually', 'confused', 'popstars', 'Lydon', 'really', 'admired', 'everything', 'had', 'say', 'other', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'unusually', 'large', 'amount', 'footage', 'attributed', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'see', 'smacked', 'up', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'several', 'spots', 'crazy', 'girlfriend', 'noticably', 'absent', 'when', 'lucidly', 'own', 'frustrations', 'point', 'time', 'was', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Sid', 'are', 'hidden', 'shadows', 'strategically', 'positioned', 'studio', 'lighting', 'giving', 'surviving', 'members', 'sense', 'immortality', 'yet', 'raising', 'up', 'fallen', 'band', 'mate', 'shadows', 'clearly', 'see', 'living', 'color', 'most', 'time', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'are', 'important', 'clips', 'performers', 'punk', 'madness', 'heydey', 'late', ""'70"", ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'really', 'special', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'historical', 'relevance', 'documentaries', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'point', 'time', 'stopped', 'see', 'sometimes', 'not', 'glorious', 'flattering', 'yet', 'other', 'times', 'soulful', 'honest', 'Listening', 'more', 'mature', 'group', 'Pistols', 'especially', 'witty', 'articulation', 'Lydon', 'anecdotes', 'recollections', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'look', 'souls', 'seminal', 'punk', 'rock', 'band']",N/A

Its not the truth of it; its hell, its hard, its horrible, its enjoyable to a small degree, but if you know what you're doing it for, you'll tolerate all that. Because the work, at the end of the day, is what matters. We managed to offend all the people we were f***ing fed up with""Thus intones one Johnny Rotten (aka John Lydon) over a credit sequence which emulates the opening of the legendary film version of Oliver's ""Richard III"" - and Lydon knows of which he speaks because as the teenage front-man of ""The Sex Pistols"", probably the singularly most reviled and misunderstood band of all time, he certainly had it harder than most.To my mind, there's no two ways about it - ""The Sex Pistols"" are THE band that broke a fundamental law of physics by literally creating something out of the nothing of economic, social and cultural poverty that was England in the mid-seventies. And in this film, which remains probably the best music documentary ever made (and my personal favourite of all time), you get to hear, in their own words, how they charted a notorious course from being four disparate, penniless teenagers hanging around a rubber-ware shop on the King's Road to being banned from playing in the UK and pursued around the US by the CIA and FBI because they were considered such a threat to the establishment.Listening to Lydon, Cook, Jones, Matlock and Vicious (in absentia) recounting their tale in silhouette over a wealth of material cobbled together from the films ""DOA"" and ""The Great Rock And Rock Swindle"", as well as hours of never before seen archive footage, gives you a devastatingly honest insight into not only the times and circumstances that formed them, but also the morass of scumbags, groupies, hangers-on and imbeciles that populate the gristle-mill of the music industry to this day.One gets the impression that Julien Temple, who previously directed the Malcolm MacLaren propaganda exercise, ""The Great Rock And Roll Swindle"", is almost undertaking an act of atonement with this film and he wisely chooses to forego overt directorial flourishes in favour of just letting the parties involved speak for themselves.Alternately hysterically funny, genuinely touching and occasionally chilling (Vicious' final words to camera are haunting), as a film it is never anything less than fascinating. And as strange as it may sound, I personally find it to be one of the most energizing and positive pieces of cinema that I've ever seen. I watch my copy regularly and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone despairing at the state of their lives - because if four council estate kids with nothing but a shed-load of anger (which really `is' an energy, when properly channeled) can change the world in their own shambolic way, then you can learn a lot from their example, whatever your age.",5,The Band That Broke The Laws Of Physics...,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,2930,"['What', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'documentary', 'band', 'how', 'great', 'wonderful', 'everything', 'not', 'truth', 'hell', 'hard', 'horrible', 'enjoyable', 'small', 'degree', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', ""'ll"", 'tolerate', 'work', 'end', 'day', 'what', 'matters', 'managed', 'offend', 'people', 'were', 'f***ing', 'fed', 'up', 'Thus', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'aka', 'John', 'Lydon', 'credit', 'sequence', 'opening', 'legendary', 'film', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Richard', 'III', 'Lydon', 'knows', 'teenage', 'front-man', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'probably', 'singularly', 'most', 'reviled', 'misunderstood', 'band', 'time', 'certainly', 'had', 'harder', 'most.To', 'mind', 'two', 'ways', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'are', 'THE', 'band', 'broke', 'fundamental', 'law', 'physics', 'literally', 'creating', 'something', 'nothing', 'economic', 'social', 'cultural', 'poverty', 'was', 'England', 'mid-seventies', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'music', 'documentary', 'ever', 'made', 'personal', 'favourite', 'time', 'get', 'hear', 'own', 'words', 'how', 'charted', 'notorious', 'course', 'being', 'four', 'disparate', 'penniless', 'teenagers', 'hanging', 'rubber-ware', 'shop', 'King', 'Road', 'being', 'banned', 'playing', 'UK', 'pursued', 'US', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'were', 'considered', 'threat', 'establishment.Listening', 'Lydon', 'Cook', 'Jones', 'Matlock', 'Vicious', 'absentia', 'recounting', 'tale', 'silhouette', 'wealth', 'material', 'cobbled', 'together', 'films', 'DOA', 'Great', 'Rock', 'Rock', 'Swindle', 'as', 'well', 'hours', 'never', 'seen', 'archive', 'footage', 'devastatingly', 'honest', 'insight', 'not', 'only', 'times', 'circumstances', 'formed', 'also', 'morass', 'scumbags', 'groupies', 'hangers-on', 'imbeciles', 'populate', 'gristle-mill', 'music', 'industry', 'day.One', 'impression', 'Julien', 'Temple', 'who', 'previously', 'directed', 'Malcolm', 'MacLaren', 'propaganda', 'exercise', 'Great', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Swindle', 'almost', 'undertaking', 'act', 'atonement', 'film', 'wisely', 'forego', 'overt', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'favour', 'just', 'letting', 'parties', 'involved', 'speak', 'themselves.Alternately', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'occasionally', 'chilling', 'Vicious', 'final', 'words', 'camera', 'are', 'haunting', 'film', 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'fascinating', 'as', 'strange', 'may', 'sound', 'personally', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'energizing', 'positive', 'pieces', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'watch', 'copy', 'regularly', 'would', 'recommend', 'wholeheartedly', 'anyone', 'despairing', 'state', 'lives', 'four', 'council', 'estate', 'kids', 'nothing', 'shed-load', 'anger', 'really', 'energy', 'when', 'properly', 'channeled', 'can', 'change', 'world', 'own', 'shambolic', 'way', 'then', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'example', 'age']",N/A

Rotten, Jones, Cook, Matlock let it be known that they were not mere puppets of the machinations of manager Malcolm McLaren that they had a voice in the message that they were conveying.

The style of ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle"" has been replicated on the Filth and the Fury (and countless other Sex Pistols histories since) so much so that it would interesting to see someone tell the Pistol's story straight and without all the deliberately choppy editing style like an editorial montage.I found the ""style"" of the film to be not only fairly unoriginal, but also distracting. What's with Johnny Rotten and these clips of Sir Laurence Olivier in the role of Shakesphere's Richard III? I get the reference, but isn't it redundant to keep switching back & forth between Olivier's performance and Rotten's onstage? I certainly thought so anyway.No telling of the Sex Pistol's extreme history could ever possibly be dull and this film is no exception.

525126,A2T892MU5MMNPA,B00003CXHL,"jbn 63 ""jbn63""","[4, 5]","It's not immediately apparent where Punk stands in historical terms.  There were only a handful of great bands, the music was rarely memorable, and the whole thing (the real thing I mean, not the post-punk posing) was practically over within four years.  Compared with the sixties, when the pop movement encompassed a revolution in sexual habits, drug-taking, fashion, music, film, civil rights, concepts of individuality and community, and even took on and managed to end a major war, it looks like Punk was just one of a number of notable ripples (another being Red Brigades-style terrorism) which extended outwards after 1969.But ripple or not, it had a bigger cultural impact than anything else on my teenage years:  I clearly remember in 1978 a friend pulling out his latest purchase, a record called ""Never Mind the Bollocks"" and how completely staggered I felt when I looked at this luminous urine-yellow cover, took in the ransom-note font and then heard the noise - I couldn't comprehend it as music at first - of the first few tracks.  These bits of vinyl and card seemed at the time as dangerous a thing as a shipment of heroin.Basically I and most of Britain was in a daze when the Pistols appeared.  The sixties had been a huge upheaval, but the energy seemed to dissipate as rapidly as it had appeared.  By 1974 the oil embargo, massive inflation, strikes, terrorism, pomp rock, et. al. had all but crushed the mod movement and the airwaves were jammed with coma-inducing pop like the Bay City Rollers and Abba.  Moreover, the ""establishment"", that is the traditional structures of power, having been battered halfway to oblivion in the sixties, were gradually and rather insidiously reasserting themselves.What this film captures is the electrifying effect the Pistols had on a country that had become complacent in its own dismalness.  The famous Grundy interview is as notable now for the toe-curling triteness of daytime TV of that time as for the naughtiness of the Pistols.  Footage of the housing estates from whence the group emerged reveals the brutal starkness of urban working-class Britain.  With the rubbish piling up on the streets thanks to another strike and utter shabbiness seemingly everywhere, there's a strong impression of a country at the nadir of a massive multi-year hangover.  The Pistols woke the country up like an exploding alarm clock, caused an outcry that seems almost funny in retrospect, and made flares, permed hair on males and Emerson Lake and Palmer utterly unfashionable for a couple of decades.On a more serious note, it is also worth considering that Punk probably helped Mrs. Thatcher get elected in 1979.  Much of the population was shocked into believing that a strong law and order Government was the only hope for Britain.  So perhaps a bit more than just a historical ripple, albeit in a very ironic manner?As for the Pistols themselves, it is not hard to see why they only lasted a couple of years:  they are the (mostly) living proof that anarchy is great in theory but hard to sustain in practice.  There is a lot of bitching between the boys twenty-plus years on, and while most other reviewers seem to have found Rotten inspirational, I thought he was full of s***, moaning about just about everything including bizarre things such as once having had to stay in a motel.  Apparently blind to irony, he even at one point launches a heartfelt attack on the people he considers let Sid down:  ""they had no respect"" he wails.Good film of a fascinating time with well-chosen footage, witty asides (nice idea to compare the Pistols with Richard III), wild music and interesting interviews.

Come to think of it, the last 20 years (when I first started listening to them in junior high and chopped my hair off into a spike) also zipped by pretty fast...they put all the best songs, the best performances in here, along with some rare footage.Sex Pistols fans may have already seen the interview with a nodded-out Sid Vicious and sleazy girlfriend Nancy Spungen (who makes Courtney Love on one of her bad days look like Grace Kelly in comparison) trying to wake him up for the camera as he snores (&quot;Sid, wake up...they're tryin' ta interview ya...&quot;). But what no fans may not have seen is a short, heartbreaking clip of an interview with Vicious after he is out on bail after being arrested for her murder. When the interviewer thoughtlessly asks him if he's 'having fun right now' (what was that reporter thinking? the kid looks completely miserable), Vicious just chuckles bitterly and asks him, &quot;Are you kidding? No, I'm not having any fun, at all.&quot; When the interviewer asks him where he wishes he was right now, Vicious' quiet, calm answer to the question is so chilling and heartfelt that it made every hair on my body stand on end.  In a scene shortly after, John Lydon talks about Sid getting his aforementioned wish, and for a minute you think that in the voice over he is laughing, because as a rule you don't see John Lydon displaying any other emotion other than general crankiness. Then you suddenly, shockingly realize he's actually in genuine tears over his dead boyhood friend.But you can also see the fun the Sex Pistols had while it lasted-especially memorable during a retelling of how they played a children's party (still not sure what the story behind this was, or what the people who organized it were thinking, but it was a stroke of genius), with footage of them covered in cake after they start a food fight, to one of the Pistol's best songs (in my opinion), &quot;Bodies&quot;. What struck me is how the Sex Pistols (who, at the time, were not far out of their teens themselves) look and act about the same age as the kids at the party. They are obviously having just as much fun as the kids, too- they try to look like tough punk rockers but can't wipe the smiles off their faces as they joyfully have a ball.The soundtrack, timing, and editing are all perfect. &quot;Submission&quot;, another of my favorite songs (and in my opinion, one of their more underrated ones) is played over the credits, and it fits perfectly. As I said, my one complaint that was it zipped by too fast, but talking with my husband after the movie, so did the Sex Pistols. One of the better rock documentaries I've seen.

There are only a few people reviewing this (who probably hated them already) who didn't love it.  The reason is simple: this is a well-done, historically researched, and painfully frightening look at a moment in history, particularly English history.  Who'd have thought a rock band could provolk so much resentment and hatred?  But, when placed in historical context (with many many clips from contemporary television shows to give you that context) The Sex Pistols emerge as a shotgun blast of freedom in a very deteriorated culture.  What we see is an entire Britain; both the upper and lower classes in the depths of despair.  What else could have happened, apart from a war?I don't really think much else that emerged from the ""punk"" era was worth the effort (apart from some of the more musical new wave acts), but the Pistols are frighteningly real.  Johnny Rotten's insistence that they were merely a combination of English Dance Hall Comedy and Richard III is both absurd and completely genuine.  And, considering that is exactly the reception they recieved in their mother country, it is not so extraordinary to think they were (lances down during ""Anarchy in the UK"") declaring war on it.The moments of chaos surrounding ""God Save the Queen"" and their barge trip down the Thames is a massive peak, both historically and musically.  What else could be said?  ""They could have hanged us at traitors gate and it would have been applauded ..."" says Rotten and it would.The aftermath, or Coda, is the decline that occures immediately Sid Viscious joins the band.  I make no arguement for the personel shift.  They felt it necessary, so it happened.  After a brief trip to the Berlin wall, the Pistols were so inspired to pen a couple of nitro-infused blasts at the Germans in the form of ""Holiday in the Sun"" and ""Belson was a Gas"" ... but, that didn't last long.  The American tour was the end.  The myth didn't mean anything in this country, apart from a freak show.  The bubble was punctured and Sid went down with it.""Ever Get the Feeling you've been cheated?"" Rotten exclains, furiously looking out at their first full blown concert in San Francisco after perversely playing the south and hated.  The menace in his voice is so obvious as he sings ""No Fun"" that the watcher feels glued to this meltdown.  It is the end of Rock and Roll.  It has never really risen.  It has become a mere form of music and maybe that isn't so bad.  But, the myth died right there and then with those words.",5,No one created me ...

Then seeing photographs of the band and the environment they spawned: like walking into a cultural junk shop and finding some wild, interesting things.  Then you hear the music, and you KNOW that things will be all right.  The documentary was like watching a wildly painted, gravelly sounding, busted-up auto running laps around the neighborhood grandstand.  I sat on the couch, popcorn and soda handy - and watched this documentary twice in one night.Memories of this sort are like a giant bonfire that everyone throws logs on to keep it going.  For the first time, the Pistols toss there own logs onto the fire.  Just the thought of the backdrops, colors and possibilities attached to that time and place are wondrous enough.  It seemed so open, raunchy and ugly that you can run a million scenarios in your head and still have room for more.  The Sex Pistols were at the apex of all this: an accident, a force of nature.The title alone, THE FILTH AND THE FURY, suggests so much about what you are about to experience.  You are told a story in a chaotic manner, images hurled at you - grainy, black and white concert footage; crazy, young English kids acting like they just don't care; seedy bars, streets and garbage dumps; representatives of various government, media and church organizations.  Lots of news reels and garish lights.  The surviving band members tell their own versions of what happened; their faces cast in shadow to keep you carefully tuned in to the images of the time period.  Essentially a history lesson taught by the people who created, and were created by, the moment.  I thought it was well done - but left me wanting more. But that was OK, too.  Their career was so abrupt, 26 months from start to end - which I think has much to do with interest in them to this day.""High drama"" as John Lydon describes it - is exactly it.  Everything suggested by the Sex Pistols, all the random images and brilliant simplicity of the music just feeds the imagination.  You can't create that kind of magic with high gloss and untouchable superstars.  For my money, Steve Jones was the best interview in the whole thing.  The guy is hilarious!  He seems like someone you'd hang out with for hours and hours at a bar, drinking beers and exchanging war stories.  The commentary by Julien Temple is extremely dull and doesn't add much.  The other punk documentary, if it serves any purpose at all, illustrates where they could have gone wrong in the making of THE FILTH AND THE FURY.  So, you may want to rent first, but you'll probably want to pick up a copy for yourself.

Along with great commentaries by the surviving band members. All of them always , seperately , in silhouette during their commentaries.You come away with a deeper understanding of the Sex Pistols after watching this DVD. There are insights given here that some fans may not have known about. People saw the band fall apart but this film shows HOW they fell apart and why. They were a band who came out of the dulldrams of British life during the 70's and rose to fame during the birth of punk but in the end of their career may have been exploited as controversial freaks and not a serious band. The band sensed it and broke up. Appropriately , the last song played at their final concert was called ""No Fun"".You see the punk rock scene in 1970's England , you see the Bill Grundy interview that gave birth to the bands notorious reputation. And you get Jones' and Rotten's take on the Grundy interview as the clip played. You see the band singing ""No Fun"" at their last concert in San Francisco and expressing their feelings and insight toward their demise and their regrets through voice overs during the concert clip. You see the demise of Sid Vicious , the sad picture painted of him and Nancy Spurgen , and you see the chilling interview of Sid that showed the unstable state of mind he was in during his pending trial of Nancy's murder. Johnny Rotten , emotionally , expresses his regrets for not helping Sid more and not preventing his death in some way. It is surprising to hear the emotion from Rotten because he is a guy who you never see express sadness and show tears. Its a rare and real moment captured on tape.As the film goes along you become more captivated by this unique documentary. It captivates you as it goes along because its very insightful to the feelings of the band members and their manager Malcolm and they're all very giving with their insights and feelings.

525144,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CXHL,Robert Moore,"[10, 20]","For some reason, Julien Temple has made not one, but two documentaries on the Sex Pistols.  The first and slightly better film was THE GREAT ROCK AND ROLL SWINDLE, and tells the Sex Pistols' story more or less from Malcolm McLaren's perspective.  This second film, besides being messier than the earlier one, is far less original.  It actually culls considerable hunks from the earlier film, but despite this manages to be the mirror image of the other.  Instead of telling things from the standpoint of McLaren, it is told from the standpoint of the band members, and they clearly don't like him at all.It is amazing that Temple, who has actually made some good films over the years, has managed to make two poor films on the Sex Pistols.  One would think that making a good documentary about the Sex Pistols would be as easy as catching fish in a bathtub.  They were so outrageous, so dramatic, their impact on society so huge that it would be simply a matter of casually editing already existing footage.  But what we have in THE FILTH AND THE FURY is a visual mess, almost borderline incoherent at times, almost completely without any new insight into the Sex Pistols, and with the insertion of a host of images that aren't really relevant to the time or their story.  Why, for instance, the absolutely endless excerpts from Laurence Olivier's RICHARD III.  The pretentiousness of the film can hardly be overstated.  For instance, in contemporary interviews, the members of the band are left in darkness, as if they were part of a witness protection program.One of the points of the film seems to be to minimize the role that McLaren played in creating the band, as if the four members of the Sex Pistols pulled the whole enterprise together.  Besides being enormously self-serving, it overlooks a number of key facts.  For instance, McLaren's time spent in New York earlier in the 1970s, getting to know bands and performers like Television, Richard Hell, the Ramones, and deciding that he would like to import something like that into London.  Indeed, his first choice for the lead singer of the Sex Pistols was Richard Hell, who originated the fashion styles that were later associated with the Sex Pistols.  Hell declined, deciding to stay in New York, but Hell's dress code provided the pattern for much of the clothing available in Sex, McLaren's boutique.  Typically, the documentary leaves Hell out of the story entirely.  The worst thing about pushing McLaren to the periphery of the story, as if he were lucky to be along for the ride rather than the owner of the ride, is that it leaves out the ideological context for the punk movement.  Was McLaren the exploitative jerk that especially Johnny Rotten asserts that he was?  It is entirely possible, but even if so it doesn't negate the formative role he played.Where the film excels and where it gets quite good is when the members of the band, especially John Lydon, talk about what went wrong with the band and with the punk movement.  There is also some great footage of the Sex Pistols performing live, but very nearly all of this is dubbed with studio recordings.  This is not merely dishonest, it considerably lessens the value of the film.  Luckily, much of the American footage contains the original soundtrack, including the absolutely chilling ""No Fun"" from their final concert in San Francisco.  The way Johnny Rotten keeps growling the words ""No fun"" while sitting in a crouch on the stage sounds more like a lesson in metaphysics than a confession.  It is a stunning bit, made more complete by the visibly distraught Steve Jones to the side of Rotten.In the end, this is an important film for anyone interested in rock, punk, or the Sex Pistols.  But one nonetheless feels frustration that a filmmaker with such extraordinary access to the band members had to mar his film with so much needless and irrelevant footage of British comedians and Laurence Olivier's RICHARD III.  He would have done better to focus more distinctly on the band itself.",3,An important but flawed documentary on a crucial band,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,4025,"['reason', 'Julien', 'Temple', 'made', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'documentaries', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'first', 'slightly', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ROCK', 'AND', 'ROLL', 'SWINDLE', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'Malcolm', 'McLaren', 'perspective', 'second', 'film', 'being', 'messier', 'earlier', 'one', 'far', 'less', 'original', 'actually', 'considerable', 'hunks', 'earlier', 'film', 'be', 'mirror', 'image', 'other', 'Instead', 'telling', 'things', 'standpoint', 'McLaren', 'told', 'standpoint', 'band', 'members', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'all.It', 'amazing', 'Temple', 'who', 'actually', 'made', 'good', 'films', 'years', 'managed', 'make', 'two', 'poor', 'films', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'making', 'good', 'documentary', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'catching', 'fish', 'bathtub', 'were', 'so', 'outrageous', 'so', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'society', 'so', 'huge', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'matter', 'casually', 'editing', 'already', 'existing', 'footage', 'what', 'have', 'THE', 'FILTH', 'AND', 'THE', 'FURY', 'visual', 'mess', 'almost', 'borderline', 'incoherent', 'times', 'almost', 'completely', 'new', 'insight', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'insertion', 'host', 'images', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'relevant', 'time', 'story', 'Why', 'instance', 'absolutely', 'endless', 'excerpts', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'RICHARD', 'III', 'pretentiousness', 'film', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'overstated', 'instance', 'contemporary', 'interviews', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'left', 'darkness', 'were', 'part', 'witness', 'protection', 'program.One', 'points', 'film', 'be', 'minimize', 'role', 'McLaren', 'played', 'creating', 'band', 'four', 'members', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'pulled', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'together', 'being', 'enormously', 'self-serving', 'number', 'key', 'facts', 'instance', 'McLaren', 'time', 'spent', 'New', 'York', 'earlier', '1970s', 'getting', 'know', 'bands', 'performers', 'Television', 'Richard', 'Hell', 'Ramones', 'deciding', 'would', 'like', 'import', 'something', 'London', 'Indeed', 'first', 'choice', 'lead', 'singer', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'was', 'Richard', 'Hell', 'who', 'originated', 'fashion', 'styles', 'were', 'later', 'associated', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'Hell', 'declined', 'deciding', 'stay', 'New', 'York', 'Hell', 'dress', 'code', 'provided', 'pattern', 'much', 'clothing', 'available', 'Sex', 'McLaren', 'boutique', 'Typically', 'documentary', 'leaves', 'Hell', 'story', 'entirely', 'worst', 'thing', 'pushing', 'McLaren', 'periphery', 'story', 'were', 'lucky', 'be', 'along', 'ride', 'rather', 'owner', 'ride', 'out', 'ideological', 'context', 'punk', 'movement', 'Was', 'McLaren', 'exploitative', 'jerk', 'especially', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'was', 'entirely', 'possible', 'even', ""n't"", 'negate', 'formative', 'role', 'film', 'excels', 'where', 'quite', 'good', 'when', 'members', 'band', 'especially', 'John', 'Lydon', 'talk', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'band', 'punk', 'movement', 'also', 'great', 'footage', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'performing', 'live', 'very', 'nearly', 'dubbed', 'studio', 'recordings', 'not', 'merely', 'dishonest', 'considerably', 'value', 'film', 'Luckily', 'much', 'American', 'footage', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'Fun', 'final', 'concert', 'San', 'Francisco', 'way', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'growling', 'words', 'fun', 'sitting', 'crouch', 'stage', 'more', 'lesson', 'metaphysics', 'confession', 'stunning', 'bit', 'made', 'more', 'complete', 'visibly', 'distraught', 'Steve', 'Jones', 'side', 'Rotten.In', 'end', 'important', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'rock', 'punk', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'one', 'nonetheless', 'feels', 'frustration', 'filmmaker', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'access', 'band', 'members', 'had', 'mar', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'needless', 'irrelevant', 'footage', 'British', 'comedians', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'RICHARD', 'III', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'focus', 'more', 'distinctly', 'band']",N/A

How two nogoodfernuthins happened to hook up with someone who can actually play and with a provocateur to manage them is already hard enough to swallow.  Add to that their discovery of the charismatic and hyperarticulate Johnny Rotten in a random search for a front-man, and it becomes the proverbial discovery of the proverbial needle in the proverbial haystack.  This documentary, solely from the band's point of view as McLaren was not invited, will captivate any true music fan.  We get to hear about all the juicy stuff firsthand: Their profanity-strewn appearance on a British TV talk show that first gave them their notoriety, A&amp;M wilting under public pressure and dropping them off their roster after signing them less than 24 hours earlier, the infighting between the band-members, the accelerating mutation of punk culture into something even the band did not understand, McLaren's underhanded dealings, Sid Vicious' girlfriend and their destructive habits, etc.  It must've been a wild and chaotic two-year ride for the Pistols and based on the interviews, they appear to be just getting over the shock now.  I think Temple tried to capture some of that woolliness in his approach because this is not your typical talking-heads documentary.  Instead, Temple assaults us with a collage-montage barrage.  I found the technique to be exhausting, and I imagine people uninterested by the subject matter will not have the patience to endure it.  And it's too bad that McLaren wasn't involved in the project because although he would invariably have overestimated his contributions to the Pistols' rapid ascent, it would be interesting to know more about how he pulled the strings behind the scenes.  I also didn't like Temple's approach of shooting the interviews with the band-members backlit.  In fact, I don't know anyone who liked this approach, so I have no idea why the Pistols decided to hide their faces.  Perhaps it's because they wanted to preserve in our minds their images as wild, young punk-avatars, since there was no mention of the Filthy Lucre reunion tour either.",3,Absorbing subject but montage assault is exhausting,991785600,"06 6, 2001",2001,2213,"['What', 'most', 'fascinating', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'not', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'infamy', 'utter', 'implausibility', 'How', 'two', 'nogoodfernuthins', 'happened', 'hook', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'provocateur', 'manage', 'already', 'hard', 'enough', 'swallow', 'Add', 'discovery', 'charismatic', 'hyperarticulate', 'Johnny', 'Rotten', 'random', 'search', 'front-man', 'proverbial', 'discovery', 'proverbial', 'needle', 'proverbial', 'haystack', 'documentary', 'solely', 'band', 'point', 'view', 'McLaren', 'was', 'not', 'invited', 'will', 'captivate', 'true', 'music', 'fan', 'get', 'hear', 'juicy', 'stuff', 'firsthand', 'profanity-strewn', 'appearance', 'British', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'first', 'gave', 'notoriety', 'A', 'amp', 'M', 'wilting', 'public', 'pressure', 'dropping', 'off', 'roster', 'signing', 'less', '24', 'hours', 'earlier', 'infighting', 'band-members', 'accelerating', 'mutation', 'punk', 'culture', 'something', 'even', 'band', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'McLaren', 'underhanded', 'dealings', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'girlfriend', 'destructive', 'habits', 'etc', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wild', 'chaotic', 'two-year', 'ride', 'Pistols', 'based', 'interviews', 'appear', 'be', 'just', 'getting', 'shock', 'now', 'think', 'Temple', 'tried', 'capture', 'woolliness', 'approach', 'not', 'typical', 'talking-heads', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'Temple', 'collage-montage', 'barrage', 'found', 'technique', 'be', 'exhausting', 'imagine', 'people', 'uninterested', 'subject', 'matter', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'endure', 'too', 'bad', 'McLaren', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'project', 'would', 'invariably', 'have', 'overestimated', 'contributions', 'Pistols', 'rapid', 'ascent', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'more', 'how', 'pulled', 'strings', 'scenes', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'Temple', 'approach', 'shooting', 'interviews', 'band-members', 'backlit', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'approach', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Pistols', 'decided', 'hide', 'Perhaps', 'wanted', 'preserve', 'minds', 'images', 'wild', 'young', 'punk-avatars', 'was', 'mention', 'Filthy', 'Lucre', 'reunion', 'tour']",N/A
