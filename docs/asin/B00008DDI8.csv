738351,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00008DDI8,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[10, 19]","Malibu Beach (1978)...this movie could have been called Van 2: Electric Boogaloo aka Van 2: Return of Dugan, as it shares a lot of similarities to the movie The Van (1977), which I watched the night before...both were released by Crown Pictures International ""If it's Crown, You Can Bet it's Crap"", both written by Celia Susan Cotelo and Robert J. Rosenthal (the latter also directing here), both featured a main protagonist character named Bobby (played by different actors), and both featured a main antagonistic character named Dugan, played by Stephen Oliver.  Directed by Robert J. Rosenthal (Zapped!), the film stars Kim Lankford (""Knots Landing"", The Octagon) and James `Greg Marmalard' Daughton, who would, in the same year, go on to appear in a little film know as Animal House (1978).  Also appearing is Susan `She's a' Player (The Pom Pom Girls), Michael `Lex"" Luther (The Verne Miller Story), Stephen Oliver (Werewolves on Wheels, Cycle Psycho, The Van), and Flora `I'm not Eve' Plumb, whose biggest claim to fame appears to be the fact she's the sister of Eve Plumb, also known as Jan Brady on TV's ""The Brady Bunch"".As the movie begins a bell rings, and a throng of bell bottomed, feathered haired teenage types pour out of a high school.  Apparently it's the beginning of summer break, and, if you live in Southern California aka SoCal, that means it's time to go to the beach, Malibu beach, that is (never mind the irregular shaped moles...what's a little melanoma in comparison to the perfect tan?)...Bobby (Daughton) makes the scene...hey, there's Dugan...seems he's traded in his boogie van for a set of dumbbells and a motorcycle, now spending his days working out in the sand and calling everyone a punk...and there's Dina (Lankford), the new lifeguard...uh oh Dina, better not let your supervisor catch you wearing a bikini on duty.  Look at that...there's a dog trained to steal women's bikini tops...that's right, get up and chase after that dog so everyone can get a good look at your bazooms.  Hey, there's Ms. Plickett (Plumb), a teacher from the high school, getting clumsily hit on by Dugan.  He does manage to pick her up, only later to be shot down...didn't that coming...and so it goes.  Later that night Bobby and his friend Paul (Luther) hook up with Dina and her friend Sally (Player).  Bobby's getting plenty of action from Sally, but Paul's not doing so well with Dina (she's got the goo goo eyes for Bobby)...there's a bonfire, some weed, and about the biggest bottle of wine I've ever seen.  Uh oh, here comes Dugan...seem Dugie's got the hots for Dina, and is itching to get into a beach blanket rumble with the boys.  The film goes on like this, as there's some skinning dipping, white people dancing awkwardly, beach bonfires, girls in bikinis, Bobby hooks up with Dina, Paul runs afoul of some `vanners', drag racing in stolen cars, the beach mutt steals some more bikini tops, more bazooms, a nerdlinger throws a bash, hi-jinks galore, some making out, Dugan acting like an a-hole, and so on, finally culminating in a showdown (of sorts) between Bobby and Dugan.In case it isn't obvious as to what one might be getting themselves into with this film, I'll detail a fairly common exchange from the movie.  Bobby and Paul are cruising a strip, pull up next to Dina and Sally, and invite them to hang out, but Dina's hesitant...Sally ""Aw come on...I wanna go""Dina ""I don't know""Sally ""I want to if you want to""Dina ""Well, if you want to""Sally ""I want to""About this time I was hoping, nay praying, for a flaming meteorite to descend from the merciful heavens and crush all those within the scene, but alas...the acting throughout the film is pretty much what you'd expect, but the actual story itself was lacking, even for a film like this...at least in The Van, there was a sense of continuous flows, but here, the story wanders around, often settling into a particular scene for way too long, causing an overall sense of drag.  And I wouldn't have even minded, as perhaps this was indicative of the SoCal lifestyle of the times, laid back and feelin' groovy, but at least make things a little more interesting.  There is some fun to be had here, both of the intentional and unintentional kind, along with a good deal of nekkidness, mostly of the topless variety.  I didn't think Ms. Lankford would doff her clothing, as she seemed of the goody goody variety, but sure enough, she does make with the goods (a few times).  As far as Daughton goes, it was interesting seeing him play a good guy, considering his next film, Animal House, would forever typecast him as the heavy.  There was one really odd sequence near the beginning where Dugan's giving Ms. Plickett a ride home from the beach on his motorcycle accompanied by the Peter & Gordon song ""I Go to Pieces"", which actually gets used a few times throughout (Crown International certainly got their money's worth).  I like the song, but it just felt so strange used the way it was in that scene.  My favorite scene involved a bratty kid running around the beach being a pain in everyone's behind.  At one point he runs up to Dina and tells her, ""You got big t*ts for a lifeguard.""  He then proceeds to run out into the water and pretend like he's drowning.  Dina swims out to save him, only to find out he doesn't need saving, but then he starts drowning for real, so she does rescue him.  Once back on the beach, as a crowd gathers, she makes sure he's okay, leaves, and Dugan, who's got the hots for Dina, grabs the kid, shaking him violently, and threatens to break every bone in his body if he ever tries a stupid stunt like that again.  You have to picture this, a gawky kid being physically manhandled by a hulking, tattooed, muscle head, who looks to be about in his mid 30s, in front of a throng of spectators.  To Oliver's credit, he was convincing, as the kid really did looked scare out of his wits.  The film does eventually end, suitably, and with one of the phoniest looking cinematic sharks I've ever seen.The picture quality, presented in fullscreen, looks really decent on this Rhino DVD release, and the audio comes through well enough.  There are no extras features on the disc.  As another has stated, it does appear this version is missing some footage, as The Internet Movie Database lists a running time of 96 minutes, and this one ran about 93 minutes.  What might be missing?  I couldn't tell you.  The one thing I really dislike about this release, a commonality to Rhino releases in general, is their usage of the cardboard and plastic snap cases, known as snapper cases.  Warner Brothers used to utilize this really cheap form pf packaging, but even they've since gotten away from it due to customer complaints.  I like the fact Rhino releases these forgettable films and charges accordingly, but I'd be willing to fork over the extra 50 cents for better packaging.Cookieman108",2,"""You punks gotta be kidding!

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[3, 5]","The movie open over seas in Sweden before it made its way to the United State on June 1st 1978 starring a very young but beautiful Kim Lankford as Dina, James Daughton as Bobby, Susan Player as Sally, Michael Luther as Paul and, Steve Oliver as Dugan Hicks. Schools out and the kids are making plans for the summer. Dina and friends want to go to the beach, but just not any beach, they want to go to Malibu Beach. Dina pulls up to the beach in her car in her blue bikini and heads to none other then the lifeguards chair. While sitting on her chair she's approach by a Dugan who tells Dina that if she gets in over her head to holler. Meanwhile on the beach under a blanket Bobby making out with a young woman until a kid comes up and pulls of the blanket. Later that night Sally who's Dina girl friend goes by Dina house to pick her up so they can go cruising. While cruising, the girls get a flat tire and they get assistants from Paul and Bobby. At first when the four get together, it's Bobby and Sally and Paul and Dina. However, as the movie goes on ***** ******. Later that night the four meet up again on the beach. They build a fire, smoke a little weed, drink alcoholic and then decide to go skinny-dipping. While in the water, Dina is the last one to go in, taking her clothes near the water. When she returns she fines her clothes ******* ***. The next day while at the beach in her chair, Dina is approach by a young kid who starts to run his mouth. The kid runs into the water and starts to act as if he's drowning or is he? There are two questions at this point. Is the kid drowning and the second question is will Dina enjoy her summer being a lifeguard. Now some of my personal thoughts of my own on this movie.  First, if you're looking for a movie with action, adventure, and drama then this movie isn't for you. If you looking for a movie that has woman and good looking bodies then this is the movie you're looking for. The only reason I bought this movie was Kim Lankford and if you're a fan of hers then you need to buy this movie. Kim was excellent in this movie. Not only does she have talent but also she's very beautiful in a bikini. Despite not having the action and adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat, I still give this movie 10 weasel stars because Kim Lankford deserves it.",5,Kim Lankford Makes This Movie Good,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2320,"['movie', 'open', 'seas', 'Sweden', 'made', 'way', 'United', 'State', 'June', '1st', '1978', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Kim', 'Lankford', 'Dina', 'James', 'Daughton', 'Bobby', 'Susan', 'Player', 'Sally', 'Michael', 'Luther', 'Paul', 'Steve', 'Oliver', 'Dugan', 'Hicks', 'Schools', 'kids', 'are', 'making', 'plans', 'summer', 'Dina', 'friends', 'want', 'go', 'beach', 'just', 'not', 'beach', 'want', 'go', 'Malibu', 'Beach', 'Dina', 'up', 'beach', 'car', 'blue', 'bikini', 'heads', 'none', 'other', 'then', 'lifeguards', 'chair', 'sitting', 'chair', 'approach', 'Dugan', 'who', 'Dina', 'head', 'holler', 'Meanwhile', 'beach', 'blanket', 'Bobby', 'making', 'out', 'young', 'woman', 'kid', 'up', 'pulls', 'blanket', 'Later', 'night', 'Sally', 'who', 'Dina', 'girl', 'friend', 'Dina', 'house', 'pick', 'up', 'can', 'go', 'cruising', 'cruising', 'girls', 'get', 'flat', 'tire', 'get', 'assistants', 'Paul', 'Bobby', 'first', 'when', 'four', 'get', 'together', 'Bobby', 'Sally', 'Paul', 'Dina', 'However', 'movie', '*****', '******', 'Later', 'night', 'four', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'beach', 'build', 'fire', 'smoke', 'little', 'weed', 'drink', 'alcoholic', 'then', 'decide', 'go', 'skinny-dipping', 'water', 'Dina', 'last', 'one', 'go', 'taking', 'clothes', 'water', 'When', 'clothes', '*******', '***', 'next', 'day', 'beach', 'chair', 'Dina', 'approach', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'run', 'mouth', 'kid', 'water', 'act', 'drowning', 'are', 'two', 'questions', 'point', 'kid', 'drowning', 'second', 'question', 'will', 'Dina', 'enjoy', 'summer', 'being', 'lifeguard', 'Now', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'own', 'movie', 'First', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'action', 'adventure', 'drama', 'then', 'movie', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'woman', 'good', 'looking', 'bodies', 'then', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'only', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'Kim', 'Lankford', ""'re"", 'fan', 'hers', 'then', 'need', 'buy', 'movie', 'Kim', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'talent', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'bikini', 'not', 'having', 'action', 'adventure', 'edge', 'seat', 'still', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'weasel', 'stars', 'Kim', 'Lankford']",N/A
