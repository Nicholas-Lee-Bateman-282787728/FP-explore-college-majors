1603558,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B00A144O5W,CriticNic,"[1, 1]","What caught my attention with The Liability was the fact that it stars Tim Roth, who is in my opinion one of the most underrated actors. I'm not as familiar with the rest of the primarily UK-based cast, aside from actress Kierston Wareing, of the incredible Fish Tank (2009). Upon reading the plot, I was intrigued about this film even more: a young man named Adam (Jack O'Connell) joins aging hit man Roy (Roth) after Adam wrecks his stepfather's car and is forced to repay him by running errands. Adam is enthralled by Roy's profession, while Roy on the other hand is less expressive about his feelings or anything else for that matter at the start. The trip the two take winds up affecting them in more ways than they knew. The performances by the two leads is excellent, as is their chemistry. The cinematography was reminiscent of Drive at moments, with nice choice of music mixed with stylish imagery. This is the type of hit man flick that I enjoy - it's not so much heavy on the violence and action, but focuses more on the characters, their inner conflicts and circles around an interesting story that is fairly original for the genre. One thing I couldn't help but was that the film ended a bit abrupt with a few things that didn't quite add up. With a story like the one it had, I felt like it could have carried on more and I would have loved to see more. To top that off, Kierston Wareing is unjustly underused here. Those things aside, it's refreshing to see a hit man movie, or even a crime movie in general, doing something different.Source: criticnic.com 30 April 2013Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate",4,Nice take on the hit man flick,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,1619,"['What', 'caught', 'attention', 'Liability', 'was', 'fact', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'rest', 'primarily', 'UK-based', 'cast', 'aside', 'actress', 'Kierston', 'Wareing', 'incredible', 'Fish', 'Tank', '2009', 'reading', 'plot', 'was', 'intrigued', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Adam', 'Jack', ""O'Connell"", 'aging', 'hit', 'man', 'Roy', 'Roth', 'Adam', 'stepfather', 'car', 'forced', 'repay', 'running', 'errands', 'Adam', 'enthralled', 'Roy', 'profession', 'Roy', 'other', 'hand', 'less', 'expressive', 'feelings', 'anything', 'else', 'matter', 'start', 'trip', 'two', 'take', 'up', 'affecting', 'more', 'ways', 'knew', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'cinematography', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Drive', 'moments', 'nice', 'choice', 'music', 'mixed', 'stylish', 'imagery', 'type', 'hit', 'man', 'flick', 'enjoy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'heavy', 'violence', 'action', 'more', 'characters', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'circles', 'interesting', 'story', 'fairly', 'original', 'genre', 'One', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'film', 'ended', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'story', 'one', 'had', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'top', 'off', 'Kierston', 'Wareing', 'unjustly', 'underused', 'here', 'things', 'aside', 'refreshing', 'see', 'hit', 'man', 'movie', 'even', 'crime', 'movie', 'general', 'doing', 'something', 'different.Source', 'criticnic.com', '30', 'April', '2013Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'Lionsgate']",The Liability

That's the set up. And the stepson is given the task of being a driver for Roth who is seemingly on a mission to take out some other lowlifes. Problem is, the stepson is completely useless. Roth bears this with wry indifference and sometimes wit that will provoke a few smirks. Otherwise, it's a slow show that unwinds with some predictability. Enter a female in search of justice and things improve markedly and in surprising ways. Yet, that stepson lacks any redeeming qualities, making the movie difficult to watch and move difficult to have any empathy for him, even when he becomes the victim. At any rate, things plod along until justice is served quite wickedly. If not for Tim Roth, this would have been straight to TV. You may find it interesting for the brooding portrayal by Roth and the excellent camera work in the bleak locations.
