Being a man of Omega (those familiar with the Black Greek system know what I mean) I was a little offended by Gamma Phi Gamma's dipiction of the &quot;dogs.&quot;  More often than once I felt he was referring to the &quot;dogs of Purple and Gold.&quot;  Yet, once I got beyond my petty sensitivities, Lee's underlying critique of the social ills plaguing the African American community revolving around issues of social consciousness, skin color, hair texture, education, etc., made this movie provocative and challenging.  Also, it's depiction of homecoming, pledging, parties and general &quot;college life&quot; made for an entertaining walk down memory lane.

563867,AFZ41PKYX29G0,B000051YMS,Catharsise,"[62, 65]","I once heard on a TV talk show that you don't have to be a parent to know about kids.  This was uttered by a single female with tons of doctorate credentials.  As I listened, having kids of my own, I found her comments clinical and devoid of those fundamentals any parent experiences during daily contact with their offspring.  I subsequently disregarded most of her observations with the exception of the obvious.  Some things do have to be experienced.  With that said, Spike Lee's School Daze had to be experienced to really appreciate the social comments being made.  Being a graduate of Howard University (an Afro-American college since federal inception) in Washington, D.C., I could readily identify with the life and social levels depicted.  This movie is FUBU (For Us By Us).  The distinction between light skinned and dark skinned, &quot;good hair&quot; and &quot;kinks&quot;, &quot;Greeked&quot; (Fraternity/Sorority) and outsiders, upper-class, middle-class and no-class, may be lost in an already segmented society.  However, it hits home to anyone (irregardless of ethnic background) who has attended historically rooted colleges and universiies.  The voluntary (and involuntary!) sub-segmentation on campus is real and extant.  Spike Lee's direction, musical scenes and comedic comment, gives us a laugh at these really stupid concepts.  Laurence Fishburne as usual gives an excellent performance as a politically aware student, trying to change a system that cannot be changed, and personally changing because of it.  Spike Lee plays his usual &quot;Baby, baby, pleaseee baby, baby&quot; self-depreciating character caught-up in fraternity life but willing to play for the perceived rewards of acceptance.  Giancarlo Esposito is the fraternity leader and movie antagonist bent maintaining class/segment separation.  Tisha Campbell (Martin - TV show co-star) plays Esposito's &quot;girlfriend&quot; and gives an excellent performance as a &quot;have&quot; who is victimized by her own would-be ascension and maintenance of same.  This movie demonstrates our society's nature for congregation by segregation as we matriculate through a &quot;Black&quot; college and the surrounding urban community.  View this movie with an inquisitive mind and you'll find it a very entertaining movie.  View it with a similar background and it will haunt you.  On a lighter note, of all the musical numbers one of my favorite scenes is the talent show when Tisha Campbell belts out a soul-stirring song so strong I want to &quot;play&quot; (read blast) it every summer when the weather is hot, the windows are rolled-down and the world is out.",4,One of Lee's Best,980380800,"01 25, 2001",2001,2642,"['once', 'heard', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'parent', 'know', 'kids', 'was', 'uttered', 'single', 'female', 'tons', 'doctorate', 'credentials', 'listened', 'having', 'kids', 'own', 'found', 'comments', 'clinical', 'devoid', 'fundamentals', 'parent', 'experiences', 'daily', 'contact', 'offspring', 'subsequently', 'disregarded', 'most', 'observations', 'exception', 'obvious', 'things', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'experienced', 'said', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'School', 'Daze', 'had', 'be', 'experienced', 'really', 'appreciate', 'social', 'comments', 'being', 'made', 'Being', 'graduate', 'Howard', 'University', 'Afro-American', 'college', 'federal', 'inception', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'could', 'readily', 'identify', 'life', 'social', 'levels', 'depicted', 'movie', 'FUBU', 'Us', 'Us', 'distinction', 'light', 'skinned', 'dark', 'skinned', 'quot', 'good', 'hair', 'quot', 'quot', 'kinks', 'quot', 'quot', 'Greeked', 'quot', 'Fraternity/Sorority', 'outsiders', 'upper-class', 'middle-class', 'no-class', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'already', 'segmented', 'society', 'However', 'home', 'anyone', 'irregardless', 'ethnic', 'background', 'who', 'attended', 'historically', 'rooted', 'colleges', 'universiies', 'voluntary', 'involuntary', 'sub-segmentation', 'campus', 'real', 'extant', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'direction', 'musical', 'scenes', 'comedic', 'comment', 'laugh', 'really', 'stupid', 'concepts', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'usual', 'excellent', 'performance', 'politically', 'aware', 'student', 'trying', 'change', 'system', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'changed', 'personally', 'changing', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'usual', 'quot', 'Baby', 'baby', 'pleaseee', 'baby', 'baby', 'quot', 'self-depreciating', 'character', 'caught-up', 'fraternity', 'life', 'willing', 'play', 'perceived', 'rewards', 'acceptance', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'fraternity', 'leader', 'movie', 'antagonist', 'bent', 'maintaining', 'class/segment', 'separation', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'Martin', 'TV', 'show', 'co-star', 'Esposito', 'quot', 'quot', 'excellent', 'performance', 'quot', 'have', 'quot', 'who', 'victimized', 'own', 'would-be', 'ascension', 'maintenance', 'same', 'movie', 'society', 'nature', 'congregation', 'segregation', 'matriculate', 'quot', 'Black', 'quot', 'college', 'surrounding', 'urban', 'community', 'View', 'movie', 'inquisitive', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'View', 'similar', 'background', 'will', 'haunt', 'lighter', 'note', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'talent', 'show', 'when', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'out', 'soul-stirring', 'song', 'strong', 'want', 'quot', 'quot', 'read', 'blast', 'summer', 'when', 'weather', 'hot', 'windows', 'are', 'rolled-down', 'world', 'out']",N/A

I cannot claim this, but having graduated college in 2006 I can say that I have seen nearly all of Lee's poignant scenes with my own eyes during my college career in the 00's.  In this sense, Lee has a gift for seeing things, writing about them and directing them so realistically on film. Not to mention the fact that his insights have obviously stood the test of time (well, at least 20 years). The insanity of fraternities and sororities, the social activists on campus, the virgins, nuances of being a lighter skin African-American or a darker skin African-American, the sweet innocence of bringing someone to your dorm room at home (when your roommate is not there, hoping to get lucky!), the sports games (which Spike doesn't even show you the field, only the reactions of the onlookers), men teasing each other, woman teasing each other, the non-student townies wandering the streets. Spike's got this film jam-packed with the essence of college.Lee's father's music is once again in this film, which is great. The actors, are great. Everything is perfect, however not me.I can't quite explain it, but after watching this movie I thought, ""Well, that was OK"". This is now, the second film of Spike Lee's that I have watched, and I must say that, if I did not know who the director was before I watched the movie I think that I would easily guess that this was made by a young person. A person who is still hoping to change the world by shouting, rather than by doing. For this, there is something about this movie that is annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, it was surely fun, entertaining and poignant to some extent, however I just can't seem to get over an air of immaturity.  But what am I looking for? Spike Lee is just over thirty when he made this picture. Before I talk smack about Spike, let's see what I have accomplished by the time I turn thirty!

Guess what? Most of us DO get it, and it could've been done MUCH better. While the basic depiction of Black college life may be kinda overexaggerated for the film (no; in fact, it was WAY overexaggerated in a number of areas), Spike was making several very valid, and, yes, very sad points here. The problem is, the self-parodying dance numbers and almost comic-book quality a lot of the film had managed to seriously soften the impact of what he was trying to say. Some of the characters were so one-dimensional they were almost pointless, such as Jane and Joie's character (and, to a degree, Rachel, too). Others, like Dap, were just stuck in the same single groove, not allowing room for any discussion, which got tired real fast, and some of his reactions made no sense at all. Giancarlo's role was basically an insecure pompous ass; not that lots of campuses don't have them, but the part was too overplayed; again, exaggeration. Spike's character wasn't even that deep. And as far as the ending goes, not only is it relatively sudden and total fantasy, but it's about as subtle as 400 Mack trucks bearing down on you. People aren't that stupid.
