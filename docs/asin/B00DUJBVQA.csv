Each week it is interesting to see which bad guy he will run into & send forward to his century.  Lambert has a pleasing personality & he along with Selma are enjoyable to watch interacting together.

1661397,A2TRDBTC8AF943,B00DUJBVQA,rdaaamg,"[2, 2]","This is a continuation from the first season.  It is better and has more fun and action in it, especially that Darien cannot be bought no matter what the bribe is and that Selma becomes more like a person that a machine.  I also like that Darien learns about where he really came from and who he really is.  The only thing that I did not like is that there were not more seasons made of this series especially seeing Darien catch Mordicai Sahmbi and send him back so that he could go back home.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in science fiction especially about the future.",5,Season 2 of Time Trax,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,594,"['continuation', 'first', 'season', 'better', 'more', 'fun', 'action', 'especially', 'Darien', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bought', 'matter', 'what', 'bribe', 'Selma', 'more', 'person', 'machine', 'also', 'like', 'Darien', 'about', 'where', 'really', 'came', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'were', 'not', 'more', 'seasons', 'made', 'series', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Darien', 'catch', 'Mordicai', 'Sahmbi', 'send', 'back', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'science', 'fiction', 'especially', 'future']",Time Trax: The Complete Second Season

1661399,A2WE24HCTKKM4X,B00DUJBVQA,"Roy Clark ""rclarknv""","[1, 6]","...Ten or so years ago I pitched a TV idea called Time Trax (or 'Tracks') to a famous independent  producer at 20th Century Fox. Trax is not from 20th. But here's an amazing coincidence: My pitch (with TV director David Orr) and this Trax are virtually the same every aspect. My details were explicit.I really like this concept and its producer's totally fine job. If my name was on Trax it'd be Five Stars from me. I filed my treatment with Writer's Guild; I wonder if it's still filed there?  This Trax's credits don't list the producer we pitched to. He's famous now (No names, Hollywood heavies have Hollywood lawyers). After so much time, retired by 40,flew to Tahiti and on. I'm now 73. I've had a good life Maybe better because of this twist. So coincidence aside, I'm okay, fine, afloat, happy. But maybe there are lessons for writers in this quick take.Amazon Review Guidelines coincidentally allow me latitude here. I repeat: this TIME TRAXhas a fine concept and execution. If you like Sci-Fi action adventures, you'll like it.Whoever created and wrote the initial concept should be proud. Coincidentally, I am, remotely.  rc",1,WHAT IRKS ME IS COINCIDENCE (5 stars but for one nit),1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1135,"['Ten', 'so', 'years', 'pitched', 'TV', 'idea', 'called', 'Time', 'Trax', ""'Tracks"", 'famous', 'independent', 'producer', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Trax', 'not', '20th', 'here', 'amazing', 'coincidence', 'pitch', 'TV', 'director', 'David', 'Orr', 'Trax', 'are', 'virtually', 'same', 'aspect', 'details', 'were', 'explicit.I', 'really', 'concept', 'producer', 'totally', 'fine', 'job', 'name', 'was', 'Trax', ""'d"", 'be', 'Five', 'Stars', 'filed', 'treatment', 'Writer', 'Guild', 'wonder', 'still', 'filed', 'there', 'Trax', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'list', 'producer', 'pitched', 'famous', 'now', 'No', 'names', 'Hollywood', 'heavies', 'have', 'Hollywood', 'lawyers', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'retired', '40', 'flew', 'Tahiti', ""'m"", 'now', '73', ""'ve"", 'had', 'good', 'life', 'Maybe', 'better', 'twist', 'coincidence', 'aside', ""'m"", 'okay', 'fine', 'afloat', 'happy', 'maybe', 'are', 'lessons', 'writers', 'quick', 'take.Amazon', 'Review', 'Guidelines', 'coincidentally', 'allow', 'latitude', 'here', 'repeat', 'TIME', 'TRAXhas', 'fine', 'concept', 'execution', 'like', 'Sci-Fi', 'action', 'adventures', ""'ll"", 'like', 'it.Whoever', 'created', 'wrote', 'initial', 'concept', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'Coincidentally', 'am', 'remotely', 'rc']",Time Trax: The Complete Second Season
