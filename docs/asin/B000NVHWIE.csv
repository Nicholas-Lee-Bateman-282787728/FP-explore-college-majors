I have seen a region that was in peace and growing in prosperity turn to political extremism and economic ruin. I have also  witnessed the fear caused by these people and seen the responses by the public that are its intended targets.So having seen it from the victims view, I was curious  to see what it was like from the other side the suicide bomber. What did they think? How did they behave? How is that, that so few have done so much damage?Luckily some have failed and were captured. From these several were available for interviews. I partly expected what I heard that they are clever people, I was surprised to see that they are friendly, witty and warm too. You don't think of a mass murder are a nice person but obviously they can be.Overall the film is right. The Palestinians are a proud people. They are humiliated. We are dealing with here is a society which by its own standards has failed. Rather then move on what many take a gun or a bomb and try to kill someone. This is no solution but the alternative is to face reality. The alternative is as one Arab said in the movie that the two people have to live together. This is clearly what the suicide bombers does not want.These people are the soldiers who do their leaders bidding. They are being trained from birth so some will do it. It was clear that none of the big shoots actually do any suicide bombing themselves. They are a tool, a weapon.Here you will find some interesting interviews where you hear the suicide bombers ideals and hopes  discussed. One thing is for sure some of these people should never be released from jail.",4,Modern terrorism is ultimately an advertising stunt.,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,1677,"['have', 'been', 'region', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'appeared', 'have', 'seen', 'region', 'was', 'peace', 'growing', 'prosperity', 'turn', 'political', 'extremism', 'economic', 'ruin', 'have', 'also', 'witnessed', 'fear', 'caused', 'people', 'seen', 'responses', 'public', 'are', 'intended', 'targets.So', 'having', 'seen', 'victims', 'view', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'other', 'side', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'How', 'did', 'behave', 'How', 'so', 'few', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'damage', 'Luckily', 'have', 'failed', 'were', 'captured', 'several', 'were', 'available', 'interviews', 'partly', 'expected', 'what', 'heard', 'are', 'clever', 'people', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'are', 'friendly', 'witty', 'warm', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mass', 'murder', 'are', 'nice', 'person', 'obviously', 'can', 'be.Overall', 'film', 'right', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'proud', 'people', 'are', 'humiliated', 'are', 'dealing', 'here', 'society', 'own', 'standards', 'failed', 'then', 'move', 'what', 'many', 'take', 'gun', 'bomb', 'try', 'kill', 'someone', 'solution', 'alternative', 'face', 'reality', 'alternative', 'one', 'Arab', 'said', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'live', 'together', 'clearly', 'what', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'not', 'want.These', 'people', 'are', 'soldiers', 'who', 'do', 'leaders', 'bidding', 'are', 'being', 'trained', 'birth', 'so', 'will', 'do', 'was', 'clear', 'none', 'big', 'shoots', 'actually', 'do', 'suicide', 'bombing', 'are', 'tool', 'weapon.Here', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'where', 'hear', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'ideals', 'hopes', 'discussed', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'people', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'jail']",N/A
1060572,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000NVHWIE,Buenoslibros.es,"[7, 12]","Extraordinary. This documentary really takes you into the living grounds of these people. We are in a search to find the reasons why some Muslims want to die as martyrs killing as many Jews (or infidels) as possible. 80 minutes, plus some short -but good- extras.Muslims -and especially Palestinian Muslims- should ask themselves if any of their national leaders has followed through with their preaching. Have any of their Mullahs, for that matter, died martyrs as they so fervently encourage others to do? Of course not. They all die in their beds, of old age, and rich as the good capitalists they are. This documentary interviews the very terrorists that failed to die in their blasts, also psychiatrists, Israeli victims, and even some Palestinian who questions the worthiness of this bloody deal they are into. It's comprehensive and riveting. The focus is not so much on the political issue as on the human level. Just how can people, normal people, even decent people, be willing to commit these atrocities? This is what we are trying to understand.My conclusion is that they have been deceived. They honestly seem to believe that they are doing the right thing, simply because the god they believe in tells them so, and he's got to be right. Thus the devil uses even the most honest and humble people for his evil purposes. The devil, through his radical islamist leaders, has taken good care that their muslim populations stay in poverty. Living in daily anguish, poverty and sexual repression, what are the things life can offer to them? What can they loose? The promise in the Coran of 72 virgins is self-explanatory of why so many young kids want to die quickly and have their dreams come true. Their descriptions of the promised heaven are rather (as one interviewee mentions) more like desciptions of America, discounting the 72 virgins (and maybe even not discounting them). Another explanation that helps us digest this giant delusion is the sadic use of guns as substitute phallic organs, erect and ready. If you are asking how come even young girls and mothers do this, you may get a good idea seeing how gloomy their earthly prospects are. Their lack of equal rights is just an understatement, as you may imagine.The best remedy for this craziness -aside from the Lord bringing some Light into their heads- is jobs and prosperity, so they would really have something to distract their brainwashed minds with, something not so deathly. Love? Oh, they have love alright. This is one of the illuminating things one learns watching this film: they are not hateful or perverted people, on the contrary, they are easy to love. But they have made a deal with the wrong person, they've sold their souls to the great Liar. May the Lord pour his lifegiving love on all of us, the killers and the victims. ""Greater love has no one than this, that to lay down one's life for his friends."" 1 John 14:13.Our greatest commandment is not to kill the infidel, it is ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind,"" AND ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" Matthew 22:37-39. His Word also says: ""love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you and persecute you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you"" Matthew 5:44.

""Suicide Killers"" allows the adherents of this radical movement to speak for themselves. Many of them are obviously sexually frustrated and existentially unable to deal with the modern era---which is dominated by the values and successes of the hated West.  They are losers, but how can this be?  Aren't these Muslim men and women God's favorites?  If so, have they not been cheated by Jews and other infidels?  How can outsiders be more accomplished than the faithful?  What explains the logical inconsistences between their faith system and reality?  Who is to be blamed for this sad state of affairs?Many of those interviewed have yet to reach their twentieth birthday.  The full grown adults, however, also come across as intellectually shallow, immature, and suffering from low self esteem.  It soon becomes clear why it was so easy to entice them to volunteer for a suicide bombing operation.  No, they are not mere victims of alleged Western imperialism.  Their difficulties far transcend the lazy and incomplete perspective of Marxist ideology.  A number of them seem gentle and inoffensive. They don't appear even slightly threatening.  I am sure of this: you will not be able to look away from the screen.  ""Suicide Killers"" will demand your full attention.  You must see this movie.  Order a copy today.

1060574,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B000NVHWIE,Kendra,"[4, 6]","On his death bed, Muhammad ordered that there shall be no Jews in the Arabian Peninsula.  And, from then on, jihad has been fought to ensure one of Muhammad's final revelations.And, that is the basis of Jihad today.  Well, some of it.  The other parts are orders to commit jihad until the entire world is dar al Islam.  That means, that Jihad will be fought and that we will be in the house of war until sharia law or Islamic law rules over the entire world.  Only then can there be peace.  And, at that time, we will be in the House of Islam, or dar al Islam.This is the only fault I really found in this film.  It was an excellent documentary, too, but it neglected the main reason that the Jews are so incredibly despised by the ""Palestinians"".  It really isn't because of the land, except for the fact that they have any at all.  It's because the land there is supposed to be cleansed of Jews, or Jew free.  And, all Jews permitted to live (and all Christians) should be living in dhimmitude.  Remember, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc., AND Muslims live freely in Israel.  No Jews at all live in Saudi Arabia and non-Muslims in most Muslim countries absolutely do not live freely.To be sure, the film showed the indoctrination of the ""Palestinian"" children from their earliest age.  No canoeing or kayaking at summer camp for them-- no, they learn how to become jihadists!  And, they learn how to carry and use weapons and get indoctrinated into believing that being a shaheed is the greatest honor.  As we hear in the film (and elsewhere), they really don't value life so much.  They look forward to death and their virgins.  Even the women look forward to being re-virginized, according to a female suicide bomber.  Unfortunately, the filmmaker didn't ask for clarification on this point and I really wish he would have.These failed suicide killers' hatred for the Jews/Israelis is palpable.  It's really venomous.  Some of the killers look like our neighbors, and some of them look like Charles Manson.  But, even the nice ones spewed the same garbage.Some of the more disturbing parts of the dvd included parents who were proudly raising their children to die for Allah.  Without any irony, they hoped all their children became martyrs or shaheeds and looked forward to the day their own children would blow themselves up and take as many dead jews with them as possible.For balance, the filmmaker showed several surviving family members (of shaheeds) who weren't so happy their family member blew themselves up and seemed to be mourning still.  So, it's clear that not everyone there were 100% in agreement.This was a great film to see the truth of what the suicide killers actually believe, how they feel, and what makes them tick.  It's strange to see they aren't all visible monsters, though a few are.  Some of them look like your neighbors and kids and seem reasonable. Yet, when the tough questions are asked, they respond in a way that is just the opposite to anything Western belief systems teach.  They respond as you'd expect if you know Islamic doctrine.Again, the only fault I found in this film-- and the reason I gave it four stars rather than five-- is the lack of discussing Koran and Islamic doctrine.  These ""Palestinians"" are jihadists and commit jihadist acts because the Koran tells them to and because Muhammad did it and because Muhammad is their finest example of a human being.  Their justification is found in Koran and Muhammad, not modern-day geopolitics.  They've been killing Jews and Christians and Buddhists and Hindus for years and years and it's estimated that Jihad has been the cause of 270 million deaths.  The Arab-Israeli conflict is unique in that it has been turned into propaganda to support the Jihadist cause.  However, Islam's behavior towards non-Muslims is the same as it has always been-- the main purpose is to further Islam by whatever means necessary.  All of this is the bulk of Islamic doctrine.",4,"One of the best, but misses the most important point.",1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,3961,"['death', 'bed', 'Muhammad', 'ordered', 'shall', 'be', 'Jews', 'Arabian', 'Peninsula', 'then', 'jihad', 'been', 'fought', 'ensure', 'one', 'Muhammad', 'final', 'revelations.And', 'basis', 'Jihad', 'today', 'Well', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'orders', 'commit', 'jihad', 'entire', 'world', 'dar', 'al', 'Islam', 'Jihad', 'will', 'be', 'fought', 'will', 'be', 'house', 'war', 'sharia', 'law', 'Islamic', 'law', 'rules', 'entire', 'world', 'Only', 'then', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'peace', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'House', 'Islam', 'dar', 'al', 'Islam.This', 'only', 'fault', 'really', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'too', 'neglected', 'main', 'reason', 'Jews', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'despised', 'Palestinians', 'really', ""n't"", 'land', 'fact', 'have', 'land', 'supposed', 'be', 'cleansed', 'Jews', 'Jew', 'free', 'Jews', 'permitted', 'live', 'Christians', 'should', 'be', 'living', 'dhimmitude', 'Remember', 'Christians', 'Hindus', 'Buddhists', 'etc.', 'Muslims', 'live', 'freely', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'live', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'non-Muslims', 'most', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'freely.To', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'showed', 'indoctrination', 'Palestinian', 'children', 'earliest', 'age', 'No', 'canoeing', 'kayaking', 'summer', 'camp', 'learn', 'how', 'become', 'jihadists', 'learn', 'how', 'carry', 'use', 'weapons', 'get', 'indoctrinated', 'believing', 'being', 'shaheed', 'greatest', 'honor', 'hear', 'film', 'elsewhere', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'value', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'look', 'forward', 'death', 'virgins', 'Even', 'women', 'look', 'forward', 'being', 're-virginized', 'according', 'female', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'clarification', 'point', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have.These', 'failed', 'suicide', 'killers', 'hatred', 'Jews/Israelis', 'palpable', 'really', 'venomous', 'killers', 'look', 'neighbors', 'look', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'even', 'nice', 'ones', 'spewed', 'same', 'garbage.Some', 'more', 'disturbing', 'parts', 'dvd', 'included', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'proudly', 'raising', 'children', 'die', 'Allah', 'irony', 'hoped', 'children', 'became', 'martyrs', 'shaheeds', 'looked', 'forward', 'day', 'own', 'children', 'would', 'blow', 'up', 'take', 'many', 'dead', 'jews', 'possible.For', 'balance', 'filmmaker', 'showed', 'several', 'surviving', 'family', 'members', 'shaheeds', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'happy', 'family', 'member', 'blew', 'up', 'seemed', 'be', 'mourning', 'still', 'So', 'clear', 'not', 'everyone', 'were', '100', '%', 'agreement.This', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'see', 'truth', 'what', 'suicide', 'killers', 'actually', 'believe', 'how', 'feel', 'what', 'tick', 'strange', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'visible', 'monsters', 'few', 'are', 'look', 'neighbors', 'kids', 'seem', 'reasonable', 'when', 'tough', 'questions', 'are', 'asked', 'respond', 'way', 'just', 'opposite', 'anything', 'Western', 'belief', 'systems', 'teach', 'respond', ""'d"", 'expect', 'know', 'Islamic', 'doctrine.Again', 'only', 'fault', 'found', 'film', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'lack', 'discussing', 'Koran', 'Islamic', 'doctrine', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'jihadists', 'commit', 'jihadist', 'acts', 'Koran', 'Muhammad', 'did', 'Muhammad', 'finest', 'example', 'human', 'being', 'justification', 'found', 'Koran', 'Muhammad', 'not', 'modern-day', 'geopolitics', ""'ve"", 'been', 'killing', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'Buddhists', 'Hindus', 'years', 'years', 'estimated', 'Jihad', 'been', 'cause', '270', 'million', 'deaths', 'Arab-Israeli', 'conflict', 'unique', 'been', 'turned', 'propaganda', 'support', 'Jihadist', 'cause', 'However', 'Islam', 'behavior', 'towards', 'non-Muslims', 'same', 'always', 'been', 'main', 'purpose', 'further', 'Islam', 'means', 'necessary', 'bulk', 'Islamic', 'doctrine']",N/A
1060575,A24MVVGNFVG68S,B000NVHWIE,Manfred Zeichmann,"[9, 28]","I was not too impressed with this documentary. Do not expect any insightful political or miltary commentary regarding suicide bombers. The focus here is on psychological and social issues, which would not be a bad thing in itself were the documentary not so biased, cliched and flawed.SUICIDE KILLERS is very much a talking heads documentary. Among the interviewees are failed suicider bombers (both male and female) in an Israeli high security detention centre, aspiring martyrs, family members of bombers (who express great pride in their children's actions), survivors of terrorist attacks and several intellectuals, among them a female French author of Iranian descent,  a Palestinian psychiatrist from the Gaza mental health hospital and a French philosopher and surgeon.Particularly fascinating sequences include an imprisoned suicide bomber recalling the moment he triggered his explosive belt (he survived [ !] despite severe stomach wounds), an Israeli of Arab descent who survived two (!) bombing attacks and witnessed a female Israeli soldier bleeding to death in his arms, and two Jewish border policemen suicide bombing survivors (the blast threw one of them on a car, he fainted and awoke to find himself covered with human flesh).Despite some hugely interesting interviews the documentary is very flawed mostly due to a certain slant in the presentation.This documentary emphasizes the view that Arabs are incapable to come to terms with defeat. In the words of the Palestinian psychiatrist, his countrymen prefer to ""die in glory than to live in humiliation"", one of several psychological explanations being given to the viewer regarding the phenomenon of  suicide bombers, thusly denying any legitimate political motive.One of  the documentary's main arguments against radical islam is thesexual oppression it causes. Interviewees never tire to share their cliche psychoanalytic wisdom. ""One of the classic mechanisms of chauvinism is that men confuse the power of their weapons with their phallic erections"", explains the French philosopher  at one point, and: ""The terrorist has a substitute phallus"" (i.e. gun or explosive).  The well-known sura from the Koran regarding the 72 virgins awaiting the martyr in paradise is cited again and again by the interviewees to prove their point about sexual oppression. Don't be fooled by the high brow intellectual verbiage; basically it boils down to the simplistic ""explanation"" that providing Arabs had better sex lives they would stop blowing themselvesand others up. Quite aside that this argument is a subtle smear (trying to delegitimize a political motive), also keep in mind that this psychoanalytic ""theory"" applies Western concepts  (which are unheard of in many parts of this world and hence of no relevance) to Islamic culture.Related to this explanation is the filmmaker's opinion that Islam is a religion that oppresses women in ways unimaginable in the Western world. A good example is a deleted scene (footage from Saudi Arabian TV) in the DVD's extra features when an islamic cleric states: ""There is a difference between men and women in Islamic law. Those who want total equality between the sexes are criminals, betrayers and violators of the Koran and the Sunna."" According to the filmmaker suicide bombing is almost a kind of  perverse ""self-empowerment"" for Arab women in backward Islamic societies. (Never mind occupation and Israeli atrocities...)Last not least: a particular unbalanced scene shows us the Nablus based terror shrine, where Palestinians apparently celebrate suicide bombers. (Well, the filmmakers did not bother to show us the shrine radical Jews erected in honour of extremist settler Baruch GOLDSTEIN, who shot 29 Arabs in a Hebron mosque.)At least there is nothing to complain about the DVD extra features:There is of course the film's trailer featuring primarily footage from news TV stations and a trailer for a film called TORN APART ( a love story about a Palestinian woman and an Israeli soldier).There are also eight deleted scenes:*  a brief  scene about Israeli mourners at a roadside memorial*  a doctor in charge of  a phoneline for victims of post traumatic stress disorder  after suicide bombings;  his explanations on the flashbacks survivors experience are intercut with brief footage of the gory aftermath of  suicide bombings*  IDF soldiers on guard duty at a border checkpoint - their officer evenclaims  straightfacedly ""the soldiers are behaving nicely to the  [Palestinian] civilians"" (!)*  a Jewish woman mourning the death of her husband*  additional footage of  Palestinian prisoners at a high security detention  center*  Jihadists praying and checking their AK -47s*  long interviews and sermons from Islamic scholars as seen on variousArab TV stations, mostly on the issue of women and Islam (if this scenewas intended to smear Arabs by showing them as wife-beaters it clearlybackfired, as the scholars elaborate in great detail that the Koran doesnot endorse violence against women for no reason)* a brief interview with director Pierre REHOV on HANNITY & COLMES  (exactly the propaganda piece one would expect)There is also a lenghty booklet (about 30 pages) as pdf-file on the DVD, including an interview with director Pierre REHOV, advice on how to use the documentary in the classroom, casualty and terrorist incident figures, articles and internet resources for your further study. As you can imagine from over a dozen links provided for Christian Zionism alone [!] this collection might not the most balanced one.SUICIDE BOMBERS is more or less neoconservative propaganda although admittably more articulate than usual.

The acts of violence are less portrayed while the convoluted reasoning of those who ""do"" these acts (or tried to) are on display in their myriad forms. This will give pause to any who believe you can reason with the hardcore members of Islamic terror groups. Their addiction to a twisted logic is so evident that one wonders how they will be stopped and perhaps they will only cease when all are dead or martyred.

Jen,"[0, 0]","Consisting of interviews with terrorists (one failed to consummate his suicide bombing), this is perhaps the mos crucial documentary created in the first decade of this century. It is troubling and revealing both at once. For the first time, we have first-hand explanations for why young men throw their lives away for fundamentalist Islam (the virgins). In so doing, we are given the flip side of the equation - how to prevent these tragedies from happening and how to castrate Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah's river of recruits.Under Islamic doctrine, one can either get married or become a suicide bomber to gain access to fertile and willing women for pleasure. Given the difficulties inherent in convincing a Muslim father to surrender his daughter to him, a Muslim man may opt for the second route. It doesn't even cross their mind to ask ""OK, why haven't you blown yourself to smithereens yet?"" Needless to say, no secular minded individual with a solid foundation for his worldview would fall for such a barbaric scam.
