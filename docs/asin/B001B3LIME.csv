Airing in 2007 on ABC Networks during the Christmas Season Elmo and Co left me wanting an encore, as other holiday specials were receiving.  Alas,no repeats, and not a return come the 2008 season. This made me eager to find this special. A viewing of a daytime talk show mentioned the film's release this year.I bought  the movie,and watched start to finish. It follows as the TV airing. There seems to be no extras, other than closed caption.Those with motion disorders may be uncomfortable with the moving motions at the start of the film.",4,Elmo's Christmas Countdown......,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,660,"['Elmo', 'man', 'managed', 'get', 'famous', 'lastest', 'holiday', 'TV', 'movie', 'Elmo', 'Christmas', 'Countdown', 'Airing', '2007', 'ABC', 'Networks', 'Christmas', 'Season', 'Elmo', 'Co', 'left', 'wanting', 'encore', 'other', 'holiday', 'specials', 'were', 'receiving', 'Alas', 'repeats', 'not', 'return', 'come', '2008', 'season', 'made', 'eager', 'find', 'special', 'viewing', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', 'mentioned', 'film', 'release', 'year.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'TV', 'airing', 'be', 'extras', 'other', 'closed', 'caption.Those', 'motion', 'disorders', 'may', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'moving', 'motions', 'start', 'film']",Sesame Street: Elmo's Christmas Countdown
