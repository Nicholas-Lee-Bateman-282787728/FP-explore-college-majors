Sorel ""book lovah""","[3, 3]","I can't say that I am a huge Lizzie Borden scholar or follower but there has always been a soft spot in my heart for history's mysteries. That's why this summer I decided to go to Fall River and visit the Lizzie Borden house where the murders were committed. I paid for the tour of the house as well as that of the Fall River historical society where the bloodied bedsheets from Mrs. Borden's bed still reside next to the infamous handle-less hatchet. I heard the traditional ""Lizzie Borden took an axe"" story as well as many variations that ranged from Lizzie was seeking revenge against her abusive father to she was a lesbian who was caught having an affair with the household maid. While these were revelations to me, I could have learned just as much if I were to have stayed home (and not spent as much money). What I am saying is, when I returned home after this epic day I sat down and watched this History Channel DVD and learned exactly the same information as I did in Fall River but for less $!Of course it was wonderful to actually see the crime scene and visit Lizzie's grave, but such places are caught on film in this extraordinary documentary. The whole Borden story is told in this brief 50 minute DVD complete with archival photographs that are on display at the Fall River Historical Society. The reenactments are a bit odd but they never detract from the history or overall tone of the film. Basically, if you're contemplating a pilgrimage to Fall River watch this movie first and if you feel the need to see the photographs and artifacts in person then head on out to Fall River. But I think that this DVD is so complete that you might even cancel those reservations at the Lizzie Borden B&B; and choose instead to just hit ""replay"" on your DVD remote.",4,Excellent insight into an American mystery,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1774,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'scholar', 'follower', 'always', 'been', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'history', 'mysteries', 'why', 'summer', 'decided', 'go', 'Fall', 'River', 'visit', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'house', 'where', 'murders', 'were', 'committed', 'paid', 'tour', 'house', 'as', 'well', 'Fall', 'River', 'historical', 'society', 'where', 'bloodied', 'bedsheets', 'Mrs.', 'Borden', 'bed', 'still', 'reside', 'next', 'infamous', 'handle-less', 'hatchet', 'heard', 'traditional', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'took', 'axe', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'variations', 'ranged', 'Lizzie', 'was', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'abusive', 'father', 'was', 'lesbian', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'having', 'affair', 'household', 'maid', 'were', 'revelations', 'could', 'have', 'learned', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'were', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'not', 'spent', 'much', 'money', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'epic', 'day', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'History', 'Channel', 'DVD', 'learned', 'exactly', 'same', 'information', 'did', 'Fall', 'River', 'less', 'course', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actually', 'see', 'crime', 'scene', 'visit', 'Lizzie', 'grave', 'such', 'places', 'are', 'caught', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'documentary', 'whole', 'Borden', 'story', 'told', 'brief', '50', 'minute', 'DVD', 'complete', 'archival', 'photographs', 'are', 'display', 'Fall', 'River', 'Historical', 'Society', 'reenactments', 'are', 'bit', 'odd', 'never', 'detract', 'history', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'contemplating', 'pilgrimage', 'Fall', 'River', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'feel', 'need', 'see', 'photographs', 'artifacts', 'person', 'then', 'head', 'Fall', 'River', 'think', 'DVD', 'so', 'complete', 'might', 'even', 'cancel', 'reservations', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'B', 'B', 'choose', 'instead', 'just', 'hit', 'replay', 'DVD', 'remote']",The History Channel: The Strange Case of Lizzie Borden

925036,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000AABKW2,Jeffery Mingo,"[5, 22]","You would almost think this was made by Court TV, rather than another cable channel.  It's intended for those who like the true crime genre, even with its dash of feminism and women's studies.  This work has some cheesy reenactments in it.  For example, the murder victims were bludgeoned, but the actors portray them as if they were fainting and there is no fake blood anywhere.  One actor has huge, 19th-Century sideburns that were obviously bought at a five-and-dime wig shop and lazily glued on.The work foreshadows matters by saying ""crime of the century"" and noting that the event happened in the 90s of a century.  Later in the work, they very explicitly say Lizzie Borden was the O.J. Simpson of the 1800s.  Later the work introduces that Miss Borden may have had lesbian relationships.  I am surprised that they didn't then bring up Aileen Wuornos or Wanda Jean, lesbians in the 1990s who were prosecuted for murder, just as Miss Borden was.  O.J. is as far as the work goes in trying to get modern audiences to relate.The work had female and male interviewees.  One interviewee is a psychotherapist and they never once explain why she was/is an expert on the subject; very random!  They don't bring up when Martin Prince in drag as Miss Borden says, ""Three whacks with a wet noodle, Bart!"" on ""The Simpsons.""",2,1800s Woman on Trial,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1318,"['would', 'almost', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'Court', 'TV', 'rather', 'cable', 'channel', 'intended', 'who', 'like', 'true', 'crime', 'genre', 'even', 'dash', 'feminism', 'women', 'studies', 'work', 'cheesy', 'reenactments', 'example', 'murder', 'victims', 'were', 'bludgeoned', 'actors', 'portray', 'were', 'fainting', 'fake', 'blood', 'anywhere', 'One', 'actor', 'huge', '19th-Century', 'sideburns', 'were', 'obviously', 'bought', 'five-and-dime', 'wig', 'shop', 'lazily', 'glued', 'on.The', 'work', 'foreshadows', 'matters', 'saying', 'crime', 'century', 'noting', 'event', 'happened', '90s', 'century', 'Later', 'work', 'very', 'explicitly', 'say', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'was', 'O.J', 'Simpson', '1800s', 'Later', 'work', 'introduces', 'Miss', 'Borden', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'lesbian', 'relationships', 'am', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'bring', 'up', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Wanda', 'Jean', '1990s', 'who', 'were', 'prosecuted', 'murder', 'just', 'Miss', 'Borden', 'was', 'O.J', 'as', 'far', 'work', 'trying', 'get', 'modern', 'audiences', 'relate.The', 'work', 'had', 'female', 'male', 'interviewees', 'One', 'interviewee', 'psychotherapist', 'never', 'once', 'explain', 'why', 'was/is', 'expert', 'subject', 'very', 'random', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'when', 'Martin', 'Prince', 'drag', 'Miss', 'Borden', 'Three', 'whacks', 'wet', 'noodle', 'Bart', 'Simpsons']",The History Channel: The Strange Case of Lizzie Borden
925037,A23PELUCEYKW0V,B000AABKW2,"P. A. Feher ""eccentric""","[11, 20]","(March 9 2007 rebroadcast) I must've miss this the first time around. YES, why hasn't a modern foresnic study been done? There is likely plenty of evidence still in the Borden home, even after 100 years. The re-enactors in this production are just dreadful... Mrs. B is portrayed by a skinny, young-ish woman and the Lizzie actor doesn't even have her red hair and moon face and looks about 20 year old (Lizzie was 32 at the time of the murders), and the Irish maid spits out a couple of words in an attempted British accent. (Bad acting is the fault of the director.) The reenactments aren't done convincingly and the production is sub-standard- far below the usual level of History Channel mysteries. This episode is not worth watching. Please, some production company put together a show that applies modern forensic CSI to what evidence remains in the Borden home and the Fall River historical society has plenty of artifacts to test. Like those hatchets and clothing! Minute, old blood spots will still be intact. Well, I think Lizzie did it, and don't we all? She must've been PMSing! Let's face it this was one dysfunctional family.
