This is not a 2013 movie; it was released in 1991 on Lifetime and remains formatted for TV (no wide screen).  The lighting is lousy, even for outdoor day scenes.  The acting is almost amateurish, though partly from an awkward script.  And while I like Stephanie Zimbalist, she's never had much range as an actor.What was especially distracting, however, was the continual barrage of harassment and disdain directed at SK because she was a woman.  Her character is a professional looking FBI agent who joins the LA murder squad.  Some sexism would be make sense.  But it's so cartoonish, it comes across almost as a running gag.
