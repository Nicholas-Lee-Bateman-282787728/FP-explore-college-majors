1030065,ADUJ7NO080YDM,B000JYW5EQ,Barbara Wolf,"[0, 0]","I bought this DVD bundle mainly to own You've Got Mail.  I remember seeing Must Love Dogs a couple years back, and it is a sweet and charming romantic comedy.  I have thoroughly enjoyed viewing it again!  Diane Lane is adorable in this movie.  Having Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing guest-star was a rare treat!I've seen You've Got Mail once or twice when it first came out, while I enjoyed it, I also thought it seemed a little too lighthearted to me.  I've rediscovered it after many years, and fell in love.  I've watched it many times since.I've even seen the original ""The Shop Around the Corner"" movie which served as inspiration for the making of this one.  Both equally charming, and even with some of the same dialogues and storyline, both are quite different.  I would go so far as to say that in You've Got Mail is the best role that Meg Ryan has ever starred in.  To me, this is the ultimate chick flick!  It always manages to raise my spirits, it will cheer you right up, too! Highly recommended!",5,The ulitimate chick flick combo!,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1019,"['bought', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'own', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'sweet', 'charming', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'viewing', 'again', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'adorable', 'movie', 'Having', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'guest-star', 'was', 'rare', 'treat', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'once', 'twice', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'thought', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'lighthearted', ""'ve"", 'rediscovered', 'many', 'years', 'fell', 'love', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'since.I', ""'ve"", 'even', 'seen', 'original', 'Shop', 'Corner', 'movie', 'served', 'inspiration', 'making', 'one', 'equally', 'charming', 'even', 'same', 'dialogues', 'storyline', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'best', 'role', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'ever', 'starred', 'ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', 'always', 'raise', 'spirits', 'will', 'cheer', 'right', 'up', 'too', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Must Love Dogs / You've Got Mail
