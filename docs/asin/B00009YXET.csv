Whenever I get in a slump, not wanting to exercise, etc., I can always count on her encouraging, energizing, positive attitude to get back in the mode of exercising regularly.  Also, when I use Denise's dvds, I never hurt my back or anything like I have with other dvd's.  Also, I need variety and fun or I know I'll just eventually quit.  I know, maybe that's not a very good attitude, but it's a reality.  At least I know myself enough to know this is the truth and to take measures to get around it.  Anyway, Denise has a great variety of fun and versatile workouts so that no matter what, there's something that works for the moment.  She also gives lot's of good advice in her workouts and has a great mix/balance of weight training and aerobic exercises.  If you feel like you don't have energy for more than 10 minutes or if you feel like getting an intense 1 hour workout, you can find this with Denise's workouts.

I met her once, and she is EXACTLY the same in person - I found her extremely genuine and likable.  Plus, anyone who can get me off the couch and exercising using weights and a stability ball is pure genius!I'm not advanced enough to give a critical review of her programs and methodology, but I AM impressed that she moves quickly from one exercise to the next without creating a lot of muscle fatigue. Sticking with a program is the greatest goal anyone should have when beginning an exercise regime.  With Denise Austin's Shrink Your Female Fat Zones it's doable - even at 46 years old.

When I first started working out I used this dvd and it was fabulous. I really saw results and I thought it was tough. Now a days, however, it's a little too easy for me. So if you want a really solid workout as a beginner or want something tried and true for an easier workout, this dvd is a great choice.I like it because it isn't separate 10 minute routines focusing on one body region. It's all integrated into one flowing routine which goes between arms, legs and abs. That is one thing I do like about this dvd.

759973,AOEP96629WHHA,B00009YXET,A. Reid,"[43, 43]","I went from sedentary to relatively toned primarily through the virtues of this routine, which I have been doing now for about 6 weeks.  The DVD bills itself as containing two separate routines--weights and exercise ball--but as other reviewers have noted, it's really one workout you can break into two.  The warm-up is clumped with the weights; the cool-down is with the ball.  It would have been nice if they had taken advantage of DVD technology as they do in Denise Austin's Personal Training System to allow users to stretch & cool-down with either routine.  I had intended to break them into two, but gave in and simply do it all at once.  If you choose to do the ball portion only, you might want to do a few warm-up stretches of your own before you start.  Cool-down after the weights may not be necessary for you, unless it leaves your muscles feeling tight.Many people find Denise Austin grating.  She talks nonstop.  Some of this inane chatter (""That's right; you've got it!""--which I still find cheering even though I know she can't possibly know), but some of it is pretty informative.  She tells what each exercise is meant to work and discusses proper form--though not always early enough in the exercise.  Sometimes we'll be halfway through something, and she'll suddenly say, ""Exhale when you lift up.""  This can be a bit of a problem when you first start doing the routine, but as you get used to it, you'll start anticipating these belated reminders.The best part about this workout is how fluidly Austin moves from one part of the body to another.  It keeps the cumulative impact of the exercises from overwhelming you--you don't exhaust your arms, for instance, by doing them in one fell swoop.  They get a bit of a rest while you work the legs and the abs before you come back.I love this DVD.  I'm still finding parts of it challenging, though I can now do all the exercies, but I can see an incredible difference in the muscle tone in my body.  I am now varying it with Denise Austin's Personal Training System for variety, but I can say with all confidence that whether my female fat zones have shrunk or not, they're definitely better sculpted.Equipment required: 3 to 8 lb. handweights & a stability ball.

The warm up consists of Yoga inspired moves and stretches, and the cool down is performed on the stability ball.

The soft lighting and rich color are also very soothing on the eyes.Overall, this is a fanstastic body-sculpting video where not a moment is wasted.

They use very heavy weights, are very long, lack clear directions or are just plain boring.Denise's tape gives you a simple workout that you can do 3-4 times a week to build strength, preserve bone density and get toned.The first section is a simple 20 minute light weight routine. You will do a few pushups, lat rows, light ab work, bicep work etc. Very simple. No jumping around. Clear direction. The second session adds in the balance ball. The ball is not included in the tape but is sold by places like Wal-mart for under $20.00. With the ball you work your core, legs and more.Pick one or both workouts depending on your mood and needs.The setting is a studio with a calm background, one that will not date in the future. Denise leads the exercises with a small group of exercisers behind her, following her directions. It would have been nice if Denise had included some older exercisers, but she didnt. The music is relaxing. Though Denise is her usual chatty self she is not overbearing. Denise uses the same set of weights throughout the workout which could be a drawback for those who like to vary their weights as there is not a lot of time to change poundage.My goal is not to be a fitness buff, but to be healthy, strong and slender. I don't want to kill myself working out but recognize that in addition to aerobic activity (which this tape is not) I need weight bearing activity.

After looking at different workout DVDs from other fitness experts, Denise is my favorite.  I love her energy and enthusiasm shown in all of her workouts.For this DVD, you'll need light weights (3-8 lbs probably) and a stability ball.  The workout is broken into two segments, one with weights and the other with the ball & weights.  You'll get to do a lot of great exercises that tone your tummy, arms, legs, and butt.I like to alternate between cardio and strength training/toning workouts while always remembering to stetch too.  Using Denise's DVDs, I have lost about twenty pounds.  I use to weigh about 150 and now weigh about 130.  It took several months to loose the weight and my goal is to be more toned and healthy.  I also highly recommend Denise's indoor walk DVD.  I can't always do all of the moves either in Denise's DVDs, but I really enjoy them.I give this DVD four instead of five stars because of several reasons.  1) You get to do stretching in this DVD but I feel there's a lack of stretching for your arms with the amount of lifting weights you do.  2) The two twenty minute sections run into in each and there's no pause between the two, so you may be confused when first doing this workout if you just want to do the first segment.",4,A Great Toning Workout with Denise Austin!,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,1312,"['favorite', 'toning', 'workout', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'looking', 'different', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'other', 'fitness', 'experts', 'Denise', 'favorite', 'love', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'shown', 'workouts.For', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'need', 'light', 'weights', '3-8', 'lbs', 'probably', 'stability', 'ball', 'workout', 'broken', 'two', 'segments', 'one', 'weights', 'other', 'ball', 'weights', ""'ll"", 'get', 'do', 'lot', 'great', 'exercises', 'tone', 'tummy', 'arms', 'legs', 'butt.I', 'alternate', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training/toning', 'workouts', 'always', 'remembering', 'stetch', 'too', 'Using', 'Denise', 'DVDs', 'have', 'lost', 'twenty', 'pounds', 'use', 'weigh', '150', 'now', 'weigh', '130', 'took', 'several', 'months', 'loose', 'weight', 'goal', 'be', 'more', 'toned', 'healthy', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Denise', 'indoor', 'walk', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'moves', 'Denise', 'DVDs', 'really', 'enjoy', 'them.I', 'give', 'DVD', 'four', 'instead', 'five', 'stars', 'several', 'reasons', '1', 'get', 'do', 'stretching', 'DVD', 'feel', 'lack', 'stretching', 'arms', 'amount', 'lifting', 'weights', 'do', '2', 'two', 'twenty', 'minute', 'sections', 'run', 'pause', 'two', 'may', 'be', 'confused', 'when', 'first', 'doing', 'workout', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'first', 'segment']",N/A

760001,A1R1EBKHAADRH2,B00009YXET,SharkLady,"[15, 15]","Okay, let me start by saying that this was my first ever Denise Austin video.  After reading about how much she annoys so many people I had no idea what to expect.  Initially she's almost laughable but it seems she calms down after a while and I found her motivating and extremely genuine.  She seems to sincerely care about what she does and how it can help you, she really reminds me of a kindergarten teacher.The routine was great.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, it is not a cardiovascular workout (nor does it claim to be).  However, for someone who is as out of shape as me, it is quite a workout in itself.  I found myself working up a bit of a sweat and my muscles were shaking at some points because they were working so hard.  I did the full 40-minute segment which seems to be the most effective.  There is a short break in between the ""just weights 20-minutes"" and the ""stability ball and weights 20-minutes"" where you could pause and come back to later if you wanted.One of the things I really like about the routine Denise walks you through is that she alternates from legs, to abs, to arms, etc.  She doesn't have you working one muscle-group too much at one time.  It seems like she covers most the areas I'd be concerned about and explains why she does each exercise and which areas you're targeting during the workout, which I liked a lot too.  She continually motivates you and tells you to hang in there and lets you know how much longer which I also found extremely helpful.The one downfall is that the transition time is very quick and I would sometimes miss the first 1-2 reps trying to catch-up.  However, I think after I do this DVD a couple more times I'll be right in line with her.  With that, its probably better in the long-run so you don't feel the routine moves to slowly.I highly recommend to anyone looking for an overall strengthening video concentrating on all the areas we are looking to tone.",5,A great overall toning DVD,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1941,"['Okay', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'was', 'first', 'ever', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'video', 'reading', 'how', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Initially', 'almost', 'laughable', 'calms', 'down', 'while', 'found', 'motivating', 'extremely', 'genuine', 'sincerely', 'care', 'what', 'how', 'can', 'help', 'really', 'kindergarten', 'teacher.The', 'routine', 'was', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'cardiovascular', 'workout', 'claim', 'be', 'However', 'someone', 'who', 'shape', 'quite', 'workout', 'found', 'working', 'up', 'bit', 'sweat', 'muscles', 'were', 'shaking', 'points', 'were', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'did', 'full', '40-minute', 'segment', 'be', 'most', 'effective', 'short', 'break', 'just', 'weights', '20-minutes', 'stability', 'ball', 'weights', '20-minutes', 'where', 'could', 'pause', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'wanted.One', 'things', 'really', 'routine', 'Denise', 'walks', 'legs', 'abs', 'arms', 'etc', ""n't"", 'have', 'working', 'one', 'muscle-group', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'time', 'most', 'areas', ""'d"", 'be', 'concerned', 'explains', 'why', 'exercise', 'areas', ""'re"", 'targeting', 'workout', 'liked', 'lot', 'too', 'continually', 'tells', 'hang', 'there', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'also', 'found', 'extremely', 'helpful.The', 'one', 'downfall', 'transition', 'time', 'very', 'quick', 'would', 'sometimes', 'miss', 'first', '1-2', 'reps', 'trying', 'catch-up', 'However', 'think', 'do', 'DVD', 'couple', 'more', 'times', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'line', 'probably', 'better', 'long-run', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'routine', 'moves', 'slowly.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'overall', 'strengthening', 'video', 'concentrating', 'areas', 'are', 'looking', 'tone']",N/A
