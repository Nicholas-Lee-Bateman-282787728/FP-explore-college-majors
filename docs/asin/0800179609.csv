Since I knew nothing about it, I had very low expectations (my guess is it didn't  do too well at the box office), and was surprised to see the wonderful  Shirley MacLaine and the consistently good Brendan Fraser. On the other  hand, I did not recognize Ricki Lake at all, even though I have seen some  J. Waters movie she was in. I had to wait until the credits to find out who  it was. Brendan Fraser has turned out to be one of the best actors of his  generation, if not for his choice of movies. Hopefully Gods and Monsters  will open some doors for more serious roles. However, he shows a very good  comedic timing in Mrs. Winterbourne, and did very well against Ms.  MacLaine.

It owes too much to While You Were Sleeping and the timing of the film is a bit off kilter but it succeeds  none-the-less. Shirley Maclaine is, as always, absolutely wonderful.  Brendan Fraser is good also (though his character's transition is somewhat  flimsy) and Ricki Lake does fine in the role of Connie even if her  performance is a bit rough around the edges. What sets this romantic comedy  apart from all the others is the fact that it takes a surpising turn that  involves a murder and this lends the film alot more interest.

166168,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800179609,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 5]","Yes, this movie is cute if not completely unrealistic, improbable and beyond predictable.  I liked it, but I have to be realistic when I say that this is not a great movie.  The acting is subpar (MacLaine really should have been in more of the film) and the script is very generic.  There are all your usual plot twists and developments, the characters are very unoriginal and the ending is as far fetched as they come.The story is that of Connie Doyle, a young woman who leaves home at a young age, winds up living with a creep named Steve who gets her pregnant and throws her out.  When she meets Hugh Winterbourne and his lovely new wife Patricia she makes quick friends, but when the train they are on crashes and Hugh and Patricia are killed Connie finds herself being mistaken by Hugh's family (who had never met Patricia) for Hugh's wife, and the baby she is carrying is mistaken as Hugh's baby.  She tries to explain, but the Winterbourne's generosity is more than she has ever experienced, and since she has no where to go she decides to let them believe what they want to believe.  Hugh's twin brother Bill is skeptical but soon he falls in love with Connie and this makes her decision all the more difficult to make.Ricki Lake is not a good actress.  There, I said it.  She manages to make Connie very unbelievable and comes off very scripted here.  Brendan Fraser is also a very tasteless actor.  I adored him in `Gods & Monsters' but that was like a one time thing for him.  His performance here is not awful, but it is not charming or even becoming.  Loren Dean is despicable as Steve, and so I guess he is serviceable (although I loathe characters like his, so much so that it makes it difficult for me to enjoy the film).  Shirley MacLaine is always amazing, even when the movie is not.  As Grace she is delightful, funny and very watchable.  I only wish she was in more of the film.There are moments to enjoy here, and the film overall is decent, just nothing new or anything to really get excited over.  I can see how, if this is a film that you grew up on or enjoyed as a child you may have a special place for it in your heart, but for a fan of the genre in general there are plenty of better places to look than this one.The fact remains that `Mrs. Winterbourne' is nothing new, and it doesn't have the great performances to bolster its lack of originality and warrant our attention.  MacLaine cannot carry this film on her own, and Lake and Fraser do nothing special to make this a film worthy of our time.  Watch a Jennifer Lopez film (that JLo if you're down) instead.",2,"It's cute, but overall it's a miss...",1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2592,"['Yes', 'movie', 'cute', 'not', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'improbable', 'predictable', 'liked', 'have', 'be', 'realistic', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'acting', 'subpar', 'MacLaine', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'film', 'script', 'very', 'generic', 'are', 'usual', 'plot', 'twists', 'developments', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'unoriginal', 'ending', 'far', 'fetched', 'come.The', 'story', 'Connie', 'Doyle', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'home', 'young', 'age', 'up', 'living', 'creep', 'named', 'Steve', 'who', 'pregnant', 'out', 'When', 'Hugh', 'Winterbourne', 'lovely', 'new', 'wife', 'Patricia', 'quick', 'friends', 'when', 'train', 'are', 'crashes', 'Hugh', 'Patricia', 'are', 'killed', 'Connie', 'being', 'mistaken', 'Hugh', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'Patricia', 'Hugh', 'wife', 'baby', 'carrying', 'mistaken', 'Hugh', 'baby', 'explain', 'Winterbourne', 'generosity', 'more', 'ever', 'experienced', 'where', 'go', 'let', 'believe', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'Hugh', 'twin', 'brother', 'Bill', 'skeptical', 'soon', 'love', 'Connie', 'decision', 'more', 'difficult', 'make.Ricki', 'Lake', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'said', 'make', 'Connie', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'off', 'very', 'scripted', 'here', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'also', 'very', 'tasteless', 'actor', 'adored', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'thing', 'performance', 'here', 'not', 'awful', 'not', 'charming', 'even', 'becoming', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'despicable', 'Steve', 'so', 'guess', 'serviceable', 'loathe', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'always', 'amazing', 'even', 'when', 'movie', 'not', 'Grace', 'delightful', 'funny', 'very', 'watchable', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'are', 'moments', 'enjoy', 'here', 'film', 'overall', 'decent', 'just', 'nothing', 'new', 'anything', 'really', 'get', 'excited', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'fan', 'genre', 'general', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'places', 'look', 'one.The', 'fact', 'Mrs.', 'Winterbourne', 'nothing', 'new', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'performances', 'bolster', 'lack', 'originality', 'warrant', 'attention', 'MacLaine', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'Lake', 'Fraser', 'do', 'nothing', 'special', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', 'time', 'Watch', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'film', 'JLo', ""'re"", 'down', 'instead']",N/A

166171,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,0800179609,Carlisle Wheeling,"[2, 2]","Amen, sister, we hear ya!  So Rikki Lake isn't a great actress.  At least she manages to be funny and likable in this little romantic comedy that's in no way realistic but a cute fairy tale that lots of people wish would happen to them.  Lake plays Connie Doyle, a down and out young girl who leaves home because she doesn't get along with her father and takes up with a no-good womanizing criminal named Steve DeCunzo (Loren Dean).  She is thrown out into the street after the scumbag refuses to accept responsibility for her pregnancy and, through an odd turn of events meets a wealthy young couple, Hugh Winterbourne and wife Patricia on a train that's headed for Boston.  Both the women are pregnant and, after trying on Patricia's ring and clothes, there is a horrible trainwreck in which Connie is the only one of the three to survive.  Mistaking her and the baby to be Hugh Winterborne's wife and child, she is welcomed openly by the matriarch, played by a feisty, eccentric Shirley McClain and met with suspicion by Hugh's twin brother Bill, dual roles played by Brendan Fraser, who is by far the best thing about this movie.Naturally, as in all fairy tales, Connie wins Bill over and he proposes marriage to her.  Okay, so he moved a bit fast just after his brother's death, and we all know that women like Connie Doyle--or Rikki Lake for that matter--are not the type of woman a handsome, wealthy guy is going to fall for.  Suspend your disbelief merely on the premise of fun.  Just when everything seems to be turning out well for our underdog, who shows up with blackmail on his mind but Steve, and now he has an interest in his baby after all.  Money talks...Complete with a humorously awkward priest, a crazy Cuban Butler, and other lively characters that compensate for Lake's not-so-stellar performance, this movie manages to be a likable comic escape and fun to watch every now and then.  Not meant to be earthshakingly fabulous due to its lack of originality, at least it's appealing on the premise of wishful thinking and makes you wish dreams came true that easily.

As a fan of Brendan Fraser, I have to say that as always, he's adorable in this movie. At first you hate is character, but by the end you love him. And despite the foul language coming from Ricky Lake's character, you fall in love with the fact that Brendan's character is still cute. I think the real reason that they inserted the bad language coming from her, was to stress the major class differences in each of them in the story. Thus said I do not agree with the bad language (this factor in the story makes it impossible to be a family movie)-but I do understand why they thought that they needed to put it in. The beginning is a little slow, and not that great, but the ending is classic, and perfectly adorable. I rate it a four and not a five  simply due to the language.

Train crashes. Preg. Protagonist is believed to be dead married lady (cause she had tried on wedding ring of lady), whose hubby happens to come from family with beaucoup bucks. She tries to play the part of ""Mrs. Winterbourne"", falls for brother of dead guy (the twin). Confusion and comedic events ensue. Happy ending. Wedding. Hurrah!So, now, my take on the weaknesses and strengths:Here you have a pretty mediocre script, an okay director, and, except for Rikki Lake, a really good lead cast. Rikki sucks. She sucks so bad that I wanted to take the original celluloid and edit it myself so she wasn't in any of the scenes, then edit in someone else. Someone who could, well, you see, maybe, ACT.If they had simply paired with Brendan someone with real acting chops and comedic timing, this would get 4 stars from me and would qualify as a decent little comedy. It gets one star for Shirley and two for Brendan. He manages to be romantic, funny and a bit sad, and boy, is he totally to die for in the tango scene. Women, prepare to swoon. He's adorably funny and touching in the ""making a list of pros and con"" scene.The biggest flaw in this film, hands down, is Rikki Lake. She simply has no onscreen charisma, negligible acting talent, and no comedic timing whatsoever. She can't hold up her end, so the movie doesn't rise. And she's totally painful to watch in some scenes. I mean, CRINGE painful. (That is not figurative. I actually cringed.) What a shame. Brendan is so good, he deserved a better partner. When Miss Lake was heavy, she got cast as a novelty actress. But I've seen her in Hairdo and in this flick, and she simply cannot act. Period. Stick to talk shows, Rikki.The movie has a ""tv film"" feel to it. If it weren't for Shirley and Brendan, you'd think you were watching a movie of the week. Well, I still recommend you watch it for the amazing Mr. Fraser. Hollywood needs to put this man in more funny or dramatic films. He's just got ""it"".Mir",3,Brendan Fraser and Shirley McL rock.
