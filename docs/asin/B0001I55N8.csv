The ""Partners In Danger"" story arc was more than satisfying and added an element that solidified the animated series.Felecia Hardy/Black Cat! Wow! When the King Pin kidnapped Felicia's father and then transferred the super soldier formula (Her Father The Cat Had Memorized In 1943) into her, thinking he could control her actions, he made a big mistake!! Not only did Felicia become strong, powerful and agile, but she could control the metamorphosis of her physical countenance! Wow! The Black Cat was born! And this Black Cat would use her nine lives to bite and scratch the King Pin and seduce the Spiderman; with her natural attraction to Spiderman, it was only a matter of time before the two of them became involved. The sexual tension between the two was evident from the moment Black Cat intentionally allows herself to be discovered by a web swinging Spidey as she is robbing a jewelry store! She promptly knocks him out and then plants a kiss on his cheek (Every Guy's Dream) that he won't discover until Robbie points it out to him hours later after he's changed back to Peter Parker.This DVD, like the others: Spiderman: The Ultimate Villain Showdown; Spiderman: The Return of the Green Goblin; Dare Devil vs Spiderman have DVD extras that include Stan Lee giving us his insights into characters and events. Absolutely perfect! The DVD could not have been better produced. Buy it and you won't be disappointed!A.

806609,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B0001I55N8,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 5]","Having yet to see Spider-Man 2 I was able to watch this DVD without comparing the two.  However, from what I understand of Spider-Man 2 there is no Black Cat, which is odd because this DVD could have been entitled ""Spider-Man and Black Cat.""  Black Cat is a rich girl who pines for Spider-Man, and is turned into a superhero through some of the usual hocus pocus.  I would have been very interested to see how Sam Raimi would have handled this story line had he stuck to this one in his new movie.  I think the Black Cat character is an interesting one, I just feel as though these episodes really screw it up.  There are the obvious flaws: old school animation, abysmal voice acting, and a complete avoidance of any type of dramatics.  Then there are the larger problems, such as how the writers of these episodes seem to have been using too much cold medication while writing the scripts. I thought it was odd when they turned sweet Felecia into a muscle bound butt kicker named Black Cat, but I got used to it.  Then these provided the DVD with its most surreal moment when a tyrannical baby states that he has no interest in his bottle, but that his body does. Never mind...I can't explain it.  There is also a comparison between pizza and the Shield that is only funny in its unfunnyness.  The DVD does have its charms though.  I loved the shot it took at cowardly CEO's who declare all those who they don't like cowardly.  I also enjoyed the Captain America cameo.  But still by the time the DVD ended I was fighting a strong urge to doze off.  Maybe I'm just comic book ignorant, or maybe not. 5.00 out of 10",3,Stan Lee loves these episodes!!!!!!!!,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,1615,"['Having', 'yet', 'see', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'DVD', 'comparing', 'two', 'However', 'what', 'understand', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Black', 'Cat', 'odd', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entitled', 'Spider-Man', 'Black', 'Cat', 'Black', 'Cat', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'Spider-Man', 'turned', 'superhero', 'usual', 'hocus', 'pocus', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'stuck', 'one', 'new', 'movie', 'think', 'Black', 'Cat', 'character', 'interesting', 'one', 'just', 'feel', 'episodes', 'really', 'screw', 'up', 'are', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'old', 'school', 'animation', 'abysmal', 'voice', 'acting', 'complete', 'avoidance', 'type', 'dramatics', 'Then', 'are', 'larger', 'problems', 'such', 'how', 'writers', 'episodes', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'too', 'much', 'cold', 'medication', 'writing', 'scripts', 'thought', 'was', 'odd', 'when', 'turned', 'sweet', 'Felecia', 'muscle', 'bound', 'butt', 'kicker', 'named', 'Black', 'Cat', 'got', 'used', 'Then', 'provided', 'DVD', 'most', 'surreal', 'moment', 'when', 'tyrannical', 'baby', 'states', 'interest', 'bottle', 'body', 'Never', 'mind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'also', 'comparison', 'pizza', 'Shield', 'only', 'funny', 'unfunnyness', 'DVD', 'have', 'charms', 'loved', 'shot', 'took', 'cowardly', 'CEO', 'who', 'declare', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cowardly', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Captain', 'America', 'cameo', 'still', 'time', 'DVD', 'ended', 'was', 'fighting', 'strong', 'urge', 'doze', 'off', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'ignorant', 'maybe', 'not', '5.00', '10']",Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock

Instead we are getting four episodes for our twenty bucks.  Also, the best part of Spider-Man was the ongoing storylines.  Here the episodes are taken out of the full context.

Doctor Octopus: Armed & Dangerous: When Peter arrives for a date with Felicia Hardy, she is kidnapped by corrupt scientist Doctor Octopus, in order to force her mother to provide him with ransom money in which she promised to fund his experiments.  The worst episode of season 1 made it to DVD.  It's not bad it just needed a LOT of polishing.  B-43.  The Cat:  Doctor Octopus attempts to blackmail Anastasia Hardy into paying him ransom money in order to fund his dangerous experiments, by threatening to reveal that Felicia's father was the crook known as ""The Cat"".  This is much better.  A44.  The Black Cat:  The Kingpin blackmails John Hardesky into revealing a secret super-soldier formula by making threats against Felicia. After Hardesky reveals his secrets, Landon is able to recreate and improve the formula for the crime lord. Kingpin uses the serum to transform Felicia into a ""black cat"", and forces her to carry out his crimes until he can create more serum.  A good continuation.  A46.  Partners:  Alistair Smythe, currently working as Silvermane's top scientist, kidnaps the Black Cat. He then bribes Spider-Man into capturing either the Scorpion or the Vulture, whom both have unique DNA samples which are essential for Silvermane if he is to restore adulthood, in exchange for her release.
