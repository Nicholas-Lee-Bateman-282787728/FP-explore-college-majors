If you haven't: then you must make it a point to watch.  It's hilarious.  He is one of the best imitators of others that I've ever seen.  Who doesn't love his take of Captain Kirk?  In this show, he goes on for quite some time about prank calling Alan Arkin.  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Arkin in person in an intimate stage show setting.  I was able to ask him about Kevin Pollak and his claim to prank calling Arkin extensively.  Arkin verified that the whole story was true; it really did happen.  The man next to me asked me about this show and I recommended the DVD to him.
