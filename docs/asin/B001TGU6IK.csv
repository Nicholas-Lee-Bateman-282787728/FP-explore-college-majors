1235816,A1Y09QLADQYQJG,B001TGU6IK,&#34;T=H=E --- 'Older Than Dirt' --- Time Tra...,"[2, 2]","There is a DVD bonus feature of Joe Mantegna (""Robert"") and his daughter -- Gina -- talking about the making of the film, which washelpful in the writing of this review.""UNCLE NINO"" (Pierrino Mascarino) -- filmed in Italy and Northern Illinois -- also features Joe Mantegna as an out-of-touch, out-of-the-house, father more concerned with his career than family. Joe's real-life daughter, Gina, plays Gina, his eleven-year-old daughter.The 11 year-old, played by a 12-year-old, looks about 14 on the DVD cover. Entirely possible, as this 2003 movie ran for a year in aMichigan theatre before its 2005 National release.Also features Anne Archer (PATRIOT GAMES) as Joe's wife; and, rebellious 14-year-old son, Bobby, (Trevor Morgan JURASSIC PARK 3).An old-world Italian with old-fashioned ways arrives the same day a three week-old letter is found in his nephew's briefcase(""Robert"").The old man is a neighborhood curiousity and a pain in the butt to Robert. The old man is just another distraction in a patient wife'slife that has an empty space where her husband should be. Uncle Nino becomes her ""oldest kid"" as he needs a little ""adult"" supervision,himself. When Uncle Nino is left to babysit the kids, everybody knows something ""interesting"" will happen -- but Mom and Dad.UNCLE NINO slowly turns everybody into a REAL family. He even gets a highschool freshman to quit smoking.UNCLE NINO is rated PG, has no objectionable words or pictures -- unless Abraham Lincoln is offensive to you.This family film appears to be a work of love by the cast and crew. Of course, I've seen BETTER, and I've seen WORSE films, but thisis one that leaves a peaceful feeling in your heart. When the final frame flickers off your screen, you just might find a f-o-r-e-i-g-nparticle in your eye.The price of the double disc Blu-ray/DVD is such that this film is a keeper... not a rental.Enjoy!",5,I wish the BLU-RAY was available when I ordered my DVD.,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,1876,"['DVD', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Robert', 'daughter', 'Gina', 'talking', 'making', 'film', 'washelpful', 'writing', 'review', 'UNCLE', 'NINO', 'Pierrino', 'Mascarino', 'filmed', 'Italy', 'Northern', 'Illinois', 'also', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'out-of-touch', 'out-of-the-house', 'father', 'more', 'concerned', 'career', 'family', 'Joe', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'Gina', 'Gina', 'eleven-year-old', 'daughter.The', '11', 'year-old', 'played', '12-year-old', '14', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Entirely', 'possible', '2003', 'movie', 'ran', 'year', 'aMichigan', 'theatre', '2005', 'National', 'release.Also', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'Joe', 'wife', 'rebellious', '14-year-old', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', '3', '.An', 'old-world', 'Italian', 'old-fashioned', 'ways', 'same', 'day', 'three', 'week-old', 'letter', 'found', 'nephew', 'briefcase', 'Robert', '.The', 'old', 'man', 'neighborhood', 'curiousity', 'pain', 'butt', 'Robert', 'old', 'man', 'just', 'distraction', 'patient', ""wife'slife"", 'empty', 'space', 'where', 'husband', 'should', 'be', 'Uncle', 'Nino', 'oldest', 'kid', 'little', 'adult', 'supervision', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Nino', 'left', 'babysit', 'kids', 'everybody', 'something', 'interesting', 'will', 'happen', 'Mom', 'Dad.UNCLE', 'NINO', 'slowly', 'everybody', 'REAL', 'family', 'even', 'highschool', 'freshman', 'quit', 'smoking.UNCLE', 'NINO', 'rated', 'PG', 'objectionable', 'words', 'pictures', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'offensive', 'you.This', 'family', 'film', 'be', 'work', 'love', 'cast', 'crew', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BETTER', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'WORSE', 'films', 'one', 'peaceful', 'feeling', 'heart', 'When', 'final', 'frame', 'flickers', 'screen', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'f-o-r-e-i-g-nparticle', 'eye.The', 'price', 'double', 'disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'such', 'film', 'keeper', 'not', 'rental.Enjoy']",Uncle Nino

Though a lower-budget film, this is a well-made, well-acted low budget film and was overall very well done.  It's a great story and there's lots of good messages in it.  With the exception of a few pretty minor swear words at the beginning, this movie is clean all the way around.  I was most impressed with the quality of the acting as well as the music component - it could have easily have been cheesy on both counts and it was NOT.  Overall, this is a fun movie that somehow slipped &#34;under the radar&#34; - give it a watch - I doubt you'll regret it.",5,"Great ""under the radar"" Family Movie!",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,661,"['excellent', 'family', 'movie', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'lower-budget', 'film', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'story', 'lots', 'good', 'messages', 'exception', 'few', 'pretty', 'minor', 'swear', 'words', 'beginning', 'movie', 'clean', 'way', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'quality', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'component', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cheesy', 'counts', 'was', 'NOT', 'Overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'somehow', 'slipped', '34', 'radar', '34', 'give', 'watch', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'regret']",Uncle Nino
1235818,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B001TGU6IK,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[7, 7]","A charming family film -- better suited for teens than younger children. It seems more like a TV-movie to me, although it's not. While I enjoyed its wholesome family emphasis, the script seemed a bit too contrived for me.  I think, though, that most family film fans will enjoy this one.Mascarino was endearing as Uncle Nino Micelli who travels from Italy to visit his nephew Robert (Joe Mantegna), a workaholic executive who lives in suburban Chicago. The purpose of Uncle Nino's visit is revealed late in the story and prompts Robert to re-evaluate his priorities. Young Gina Mantegna (Joe Mantegna's real-life daughter) makes her film debut here and shows promise as an upcoming young talent in her role as the young daughter of the Micelli family.While much of the story is predictable, the acting by the main characters compensates for this shortcoming.  My favorite scene is the Carps' debut in the high school ""battle"" -- the group's performance seemed convincing & very upbeat.The film has its happy and sad moments, but, as is typical of movies of this genre, the wholesome nature of the film is the main reason to see it.",3,A Wholesome Family Film,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1131,"['charming', 'family', 'film', 'better', 'suited', 'teens', 'younger', 'children', 'more', 'TV-movie', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'wholesome', 'family', 'emphasis', 'script', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'think', 'though', 'most', 'family', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one.Mascarino', 'was', 'endearing', 'Uncle', 'Nino', 'Micelli', 'who', 'Italy', 'visit', 'nephew', 'Robert', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'workaholic', 'executive', 'who', 'suburban', 'Chicago', 'purpose', 'Uncle', 'Nino', 'visit', 'revealed', 'late', 'story', 'prompts', 'Robert', 're-evaluate', 'priorities', 'Young', 'Gina', 'Mantegna', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'film', 'debut', 'here', 'promise', 'upcoming', 'young', 'talent', 'role', 'young', 'daughter', 'Micelli', 'family.While', 'much', 'story', 'predictable', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'compensates', 'shortcoming', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Carps', 'debut', 'high', 'school', 'battle', 'group', 'performance', 'seemed', 'convincing', 'very', 'upbeat.The', 'film', 'happy', 'sad', 'moments', 'typical', 'movies', 'genre', 'wholesome', 'nature', 'film', 'main', 'reason', 'see']",Uncle Nino
