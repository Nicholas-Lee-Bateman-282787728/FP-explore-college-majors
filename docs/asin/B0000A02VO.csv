760520,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0000A02VO,Michael Butts,"[12, 12]","Made for TV back in 1991, CAROLINA SKELETONS is based on the book by David Stout, and inspired by a true story.  Set in the 1960's South, the story focuses on the execution of a 14 year old African-American lad who supposedly brutally slaughtered two little girls.  Thirty years later, the boy's brother, now a colonel in the Green Berets, has come home to visit his dying mother who asks him to find out who really killed the girls.  While the movie has its share of cliches and stereotypes, it nonetheless has some powerful and tragic scenes.  The execution of the little boy in itself is terrifying, but even more so is the sheriff's insistence that his own son (a closet friend of the condemned) witness the execution is ghastly.  Lou Gossett Jr. brings a stoic strength in his role as the Green Beret, whose search for the truth uncovers those Carolina Skeletons.  Bruce Dern is very good as the sheriff, who is the little boy forced to witness the execution; he too wants to find out from his now institutionalized father, what really transpired.  Melissa Leo gives an effective performance as Dern's daughter who aids Gossett in his quest for the truth, and Richard Jenkins is vile as a good old boy out to stop Gossett from finding the truth.  No special effects, no intense action sequences, CAROLINA SKELETONS brings home the sad truth of a country riddled with hate, and is tragic in its exposition of such truth.",5,QUIETLY POWERFUL FILM,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,1424,"['Made', 'TV', 'back', '1991', 'CAROLINA', 'SKELETONS', 'based', 'book', 'David', 'Stout', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Set', '1960', 'South', 'story', 'execution', '14', 'year', 'old', 'African-American', 'lad', 'who', 'supposedly', 'brutally', 'slaughtered', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'boy', 'brother', 'now', 'colonel', 'Green', 'Berets', 'come', 'home', 'visit', 'dying', 'mother', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'killed', 'girls', 'movie', 'share', 'cliches', 'stereotypes', 'nonetheless', 'powerful', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'execution', 'little', 'boy', 'terrifying', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'sheriff', 'insistence', 'own', 'son', 'closet', 'friend', 'condemned', 'execution', 'ghastly', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'stoic', 'strength', 'role', 'Green', 'Beret', 'search', 'truth', 'uncovers', 'Carolina', 'Skeletons', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'very', 'good', 'sheriff', 'who', 'little', 'boy', 'forced', 'witness', 'execution', 'too', 'find', 'out', 'now', 'institutionalized', 'father', 'what', 'really', 'transpired', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'effective', 'performance', 'Dern', 'daughter', 'who', 'Gossett', 'quest', 'truth', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'vile', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'stop', 'Gossett', 'finding', 'truth', 'special', 'effects', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences', 'CAROLINA', 'SKELETONS', 'home', 'sad', 'truth', 'country', 'riddled', 'hate', 'tragic', 'exposition', 'such', 'truth']",N/A
