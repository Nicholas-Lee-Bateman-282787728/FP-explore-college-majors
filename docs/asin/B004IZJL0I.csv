His solo stuff, his Queen things, just amazing how good his vocal skills are. My only reason for not rating it a five is I saw a concert on HD net or Palladia that blows it away. After seeing that concert, all other performances just fall a little short. In this particular concert the crowd noise interfered a bit with the overall sound. I realize loud audiences can contribute to a concert, Freddy Mercury and Robbie Willians are evidence of that. But it also can distract, anywhere from a little to overwhelming the music. This is kind of in between those 2 points. If you consider their age, it is amazing that they can perform at all. For one who has been to ""return"" performances from Steppenwolf, Iron Butterfly, and others, they seem ageless (Iron Butterfly was actually booed and Steppenwolf probably deserved to be).

Nice video transfer and great sound.This is Bad Company with their classic hits (and others - Young Blood) shot in high definition, and with three sound-fields to choose from.  I liked the DTS 5.1 track on the DVD and ran it through my amp's 7.1 stereo selection, to get great continuous sound through all of my speakers.Seems this is the same band line-up from the Hard Rock reunion show a few years back.  I just watched the Hard Rock show on VH1 Classic and there are many of the same songs.  The vocals sound strong on both shows, but there seemed to be just a bit more range to the vocals on the Hard Rock show (Hitting the higher notes).The Wembley concert is about 90 minutes long with 16 songs and separate band interviews as a 20 minute +/- bonus.  There is a nice insert with a little history and a few concert pictures.All of the songs are great and it is difficult to pick a favorite.

Paul Rodgers' voice has held up really well and the band members are very tight in concert.The band is now comprised of three original members: Paul Rodgers, vocals, Mick Ralphs, guitar and Simon Kirke, drums. There are two additional players: Howard Leese, formerly of Heart, on guitar and Lynn Sorensen on bass, replacing the late Boz Burrell, who died in 2006.The sound production on the DVD is very good; the video quality is also very good, although the editing frequently resorts to a series of very fast cuts, which I find a bit disconcerting.One criticism I have of the production is that there were apparently two encore songs which aren't included on the DVD. During the band interviews included as extra features, Paul Rodgers specifically refers to the encores, so one wonders why they weren't included on the DVD. If those encores had been included, I would've given this DVD 5 stars rather than 4.Apart from that, this is a very good DVD.
