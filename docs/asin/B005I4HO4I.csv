1461748,A17UBY9JDNLEL3,B005I4HO4I,G. Chenoweth,"[6, 6]","""The Good, The Bad And Huckleberry Hound"" is my favorite made-for-TV movie of all time. This has all the wit and charm that Huck showed during his syndicated TV run from 1958-1962. It is funny and just great Huckleberry Fun for everyone. There are some gags from the original cartoons that have been dropped into the movie that were marvelous to see again.I have enjoyed this movie since it first came out in 1988 and, now, Warner Archive presents on DVD ""The Good, The Bad and Huckleberry Hound."" I watched this film on TV in May 1988 when it originally aired and then purchased this film on VHS that same year. Believe it or not, there are three versions of the film. The first one is the original TV broadcast. The second one is the first VHS release which added additional scenes in the film and then the third version is an edited piece that takes out certain elements.I was pleasantly surprised that all of the elements from the original video release have been kept intact as well as new elements were added to this release that haven't been seen since this film was first shown on TV, namely the bumpers into and out of commercials. This makes this new Warner Archive version the definitive release of ""The Good, The Bad and Huckleberry Hound.""The colors on this release are the sharpest I have ever seen them and the sound is pristine. Thank you, Warner Archive, for putting such a great quality DVD release out as this. This is my favorite TV movie of all time and you have outdone yourselves. This fan couldn't be more proud having this movie in my Huckleberry Hound collection. Thank you.",5,This Huckleberry Hound Movie Is Very Good,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1600,"['Good', 'Bad', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'favorite', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'time', 'wit', 'charm', 'Huck', 'showed', 'syndicated', 'TV', 'run', '1958-1962', 'funny', 'just', 'great', 'Huckleberry', 'Fun', 'everyone', 'are', 'gags', 'original', 'cartoons', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'movie', 'were', 'marvelous', 'see', 'again.I', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1988', 'now', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'presents', 'DVD', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'watched', 'film', 'TV', 'May', '1988', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'then', 'purchased', 'film', 'VHS', 'same', 'year', 'Believe', 'not', 'are', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'original', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'second', 'one', 'first', 'VHS', 'release', 'added', 'additional', 'scenes', 'film', 'then', 'third', 'version', 'edited', 'piece', 'out', 'certain', 'elements.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'elements', 'original', 'video', 'release', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'intact', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'elements', 'were', 'added', 'release', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'TV', 'namely', 'bumpers', 'commercials', 'new', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'version', 'definitive', 'release', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'colors', 'release', 'are', 'sharpest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'sound', 'pristine', 'Thank', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'putting', 'such', 'great', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'out', 'favorite', 'TV', 'movie', 'time', 'have', 'outdone', 'yourselves', 'fan', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'proud', 'having', 'movie', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'collection', 'Thank']","The Good, The Bad, And The Huckleberry Hound"
