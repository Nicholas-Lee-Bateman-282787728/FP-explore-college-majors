And the chance to get both in a decent transfer is great, since before this Funny Farm, the funnier of the two, was only a pan and scan DVD.There are two types of Chevy Chase fans, ones that claim to be a fan and only like Vacation and Caddyshack, then there are ones who think Funny Farm is one of his quotable best, while also having a soft spot in their hearts for Modern Problems.Funny Farm has a better director than it deserves, but maybe that's why it's so unassuming and humble. Part of what makes it great. Better than all the Vacation sequels. If you ever wanted to trade city life for the country, this is a movie you will appreciate.Spies Like Us is also pretty damn funny, it gets a little too bogged down in trying to be a grand 007 spoof, and the training montage is terribly slapstick, but Chase has some choice lines. If you ever wanted to see Chevy Chase moonwalk, here is your chance. Boatloads of cameos. Frank Oz (a Landis staple), Terry Gilliam, Ray Harryhausen, Coen Bros, etc. It's easy to see how todays high concept comedies staring the likes of Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, Will Ferrel owe a lot to this movie and it's ilk.Both movies look decent, nothing surprising, soft like you expect, grain intact, no video noise or tinkering I can see,but Spies Like Us has pretty bad audio issues, very brittle sounding and re-occuring hiss.These films aren't Ghostbusters so they don't require pristine presentations, but they are still minor classics if you are a Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, John Landis 80's comedy fans, so it's a little disappointing this is the best we'l ever get.Will there ever be a re-mastered version of either? So probably safe buying them hopefully for the last time. That is until 4k takes over, but even if that is sooner than Bluray took over DVD, these two titles are still a very long time away from looking better, these are deep-catalog titles.",3,Two Chevy Chase classics get barebones and borderline bad treatment.,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,1919,"['Hard', 'beat', 'price', 'chance', 'get', 'decent', 'transfer', 'great', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'funnier', 'two', 'was', 'only', 'pan', 'scan', 'DVD.There', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'fans', 'ones', 'claim', 'be', 'fan', 'only', 'like', 'Vacation', 'Caddyshack', 'then', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'think', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'one', 'quotable', 'best', 'also', 'having', 'soft', 'spot', 'hearts', 'Modern', 'Problems.Funny', 'Farm', 'better', 'director', 'maybe', 'why', 'so', 'unassuming', 'humble', 'Part', 'what', 'great', 'Better', 'Vacation', 'sequels', 'ever', 'wanted', 'trade', 'city', 'life', 'country', 'movie', 'will', 'appreciate.Spies', 'Us', 'also', 'pretty', 'damn', 'funny', 'little', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'trying', 'be', 'grand', '007', 'spoof', 'training', 'montage', 'terribly', 'slapstick', 'Chase', 'choice', 'lines', 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'moonwalk', 'here', 'chance', 'Boatloads', 'cameos', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Landis', 'staple', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'Coen', 'Bros', 'etc', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'todays', 'high', 'concept', 'comedies', 'staring', 'likes', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'owe', 'lot', 'movie', 'ilk.Both', 'movies', 'look', 'decent', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'soft', 'expect', 'grain', 'intact', 'video', 'noise', 'tinkering', 'can', 'see', 'Spies', 'Us', 'pretty', 'bad', 'audio', 'issues', 'very', 'brittle', 'sounding', 're-occuring', 'hiss.These', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'Ghostbusters', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'pristine', 'presentations', 'are', 'still', 'minor', 'classics', 'are', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'John', 'Landis', '80', 'comedy', 'fans', 'little', 'disappointing', 'best', 'l', 'ever', 'get.Will', 'ever', 'be', 're-mastered', 'version', 'So', 'probably', 'safe', 'buying', 'hopefully', 'last', 'time', '4k', 'even', 'sooner', 'Bluray', 'took', 'over', 'DVD', 'two', 'titles', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'away', 'looking', 'better', 'are', 'deep-catalog', 'titles']",N/A
