1289815,A1ARH7N0BEONSM,B002UJIY34,Cassandra Dunkin,"[1, 1]",I am a big fan of the Dog Whisperer Series and had purchased the previous 3 seasons.  I was disappointed to see that they have spit the 4th season into 2 volumes.  Seems to me the producers are taking advantage of its popularity to gouge the fans. Each season has about the same number of episodes so there is no reason to spit it into two and charge double- except greed.,4,Why Only Half a Season?,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,372,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', 'Series', 'had', 'purchased', 'previous', '3', 'seasons', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'have', 'spit', '4th', 'season', '2', 'volumes', 'Seems', 'producers', 'are', 'taking', 'advantage', 'popularity', 'gouge', 'fans', 'season', 'same', 'number', 'episodes', 'reason', 'spit', 'two', 'charge', 'double-', 'greed']","Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 4, Vol. 1"

1289818,A3F90D22Y57652,B002UJIY34,Phil,"[1, 1]",Always learn something new when viewing Ceasar's DVD's.  I like the way Ceasar explains why dogs do what they do.  He points out behaviors the the majority of pet owners would not notice.  Ceasar seems to improve with each season and tackles more and more unique problems.,5,Informative with insight,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,272,"['Always', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'when', 'viewing', 'Ceasar', 'DVD', 'way', 'Ceasar', 'why', 'dogs', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'out', 'behaviors', 'majority', 'pet', 'owners', 'would', 'not', 'notice', 'Ceasar', 'improve', 'season', 'tackles', 'more', 'more', 'unique', 'problems']","Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 4, Vol. 1"

I wish I did as well as he does. Anyone who wants to own a dog, or has dogs whether or not they are having trouble or not, should watch his shows to help them.DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE!!!",5,Wonderful Season...,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,309,"['definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'Season', 'anyone', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', 'definitely', 'way', 'dogs', 'wish', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'own', 'dog', 'dogs', 'not', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'not', 'should', 'watch', 'shows', 'help', 'them.DEFINITELY', 'MUST', 'HAVE']","Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 4, Vol. 1"
