Fine actors giving fine performances. And excellent production values to boot.But it was very much biased against the Clinton Administration and quite lenient on the Bush Administration. This should come as no surprise when it's discovered the screenwriter was known to be a neo-con.And this point of view would be fine...if it had been accurate.I've read enough books and articles to understand that neither administration handled Al Qaeda perfectly, but the Clinton Administration was very much focused on fighting them and thwarted many efforts to attack the United States. It is also a known fact that the Clinton Administration warned the incoming Bush Administration of the terrorist threat. And that warning was ignored. Then it was too late.One need only read Richard Clarke's book AGAINST ALL ENEMIES to get an understanding of this.

The first night went off with out a hitch, but the second night all I got were the opening and ending credits. So I missed the second half, and I have been waiting for it to come out on dvd. However, I do believe the Hilary angle. I found the LA Times article on the web. ABC is not allowing it to be sold during this campaign season. I would like to be proved wrong, but ABC only responds to e-mails and letters only in a standard form letter.I first wrote a statement on this in 2007, it is now 2013. ABC has yet to release the DVD. I have two bad copies, one of the actual broadcast and the second is the unedited version. The picture quality is not great so I would like to buy an authorized version. ABC is still bowing to political pressure and will not release it. Why? Why else, the Democrats seemed to want that tired old lady in 2016 and yet another Bush is making noises about running for the GOP. Until the Clinton's and the Bush's leave presidential politics behind, this may never be released.The sad part is the film, "" The Path to 9/11,"" showed both Clinton and Bush in a bad light. Most of all nothing has seemed to have changed as the events in Boston show. People are still getting into the country, who mean us harm.

It played for 2 nights on ABC and I stayed up late to watch as much as I could.  I really, really, REALLY wish that the liberal powers-that-be would stop their fascistic censorship of this film and let the ""masses"" watch it again!I really liked the characters played by Harvey Keitel (John O'Neil, FBI man who died in 9/11) and Mark Wahlberg (CIA field guy).  That's because I appreciate courageous men whose characters aren't critically weakened & compromised by political correctness, and can still say the TRUTH.  I.e., they were ""no-BS"" men.  They dealt with the reality and the horror of anti-US Islamic terrorism, up close and personal.  Then, when they ran into complacent, PC, arrogant, pompous political clowns like Madeline Albright (Dept of State) and Barbara Bodine (Ambassador to Yemen), the story exposes the latter's extreme patheticness and lack of real-life experience.  Actually, Condoleeza Rice also gets skewered in the film for likewise being clueless.  Maybe that's another reason why the Clintons and the RULING LIBERAL ELITE killed the production of this excellent, outstanding and hard-hitting docu-drama:  it wasn't very nice to clueless Governmental women bureaucrats!  (Did you ever run across one?  The liberal complacent, pompous, effete jerk on a power trip because they're in the government? Not a nice bunch, and admittedly as many men are in this role as women!)Another thing I loved about the movie was its tracking of the 9/11 story from 1993, when the World Trade Center was bombed the first time.  And yes, it DID go into the fecklessness and incompetant ineptness of the Clinton's tree-hugger administration.  (But Bush did not get a pass either!!) It's not like we didn't have warning about the 9/11 attacks.I know that our puppet-masters want us to ""forget about it,"" but I remember the controversy over the docu-drama right before it aired.  The Democrats had a cow and immediately rushed to sue, to denounce, to threaten etc. even BEFORE the film was shown.  Then, the gutless ABC put out disclaimers before every episode on TV, something like ""Don't believe a word in this thing, we know it stinks, we're sorry we made it, it's just a fantasy, we love the Clintons, Go Democrats"" etc etc The docu-drama was really good despite the ridiculous disclaimer.If enough people push for the production of it, then maybe millions more Americans will see The Path to 9/11 someday.

What was so damning that he surrendered his hard earned law license so as not to testify and answer questions under oath about what he stole? Read the Berger report, I did. It's only 45 pages and shocking. They replaced documents to see if it was a mistake, and he stole them again! He stole so much, that he couldn't remember if he had already seen the documents, and couldnt figure how he missed stealing them the first time. Then he moved the bright pink post-its on the documents he stole, to others, and returned them. He went outside to make a ""phone call"", and temporarily stashed them at a nearby construction site, for later retrieval. Seriously, why did he do this, and what did he steal! That's the REAL conspiracy. So let all the information come out, you fascists at ABC/Disney/Democratic party.

This in part because of the Clinton administration's feckless power over the rights to create the DVD for retailers. Had it have been a movie implicating say the Reagan or Bush Sr administrations, you can bet that the DVD probably would have been available 1 to 2 weeks after the movie was shown. This is really what is sad about this country and why we are so blind to the truth. It is really the main reason why this current administration, which in fairness, did have some blame, but not the majority of it since he only had one shot at OBL. This is the reason why he has not yet beaten the terrorists. This and the way the media portray him and our US soldiers fighting in Iraq & Afghanistan. If there was any suppresion of the truth, any illegal wire tapping (remember Eschelon) or rights that being suppressed, it was under the Clinton administration. Anyone who defied him was automatically audited or worse. And let's be honest shall we. Had Clinton done his job (not the one being done to him) as president, and killed Osama in at least ONE of the THIRTEEN CHANCES that he had, we wouldn't be talking about the 9/11 tragedy or the war on terror as bad as it is. Quite frankly, if he had done his job like his mentor, JFK did, I wouldn't care if he slept with 100 WOMEN. Yes that's right, I wouldn't care who he slept with, so long as he would've killed OBL and fought back the terrorists! Instead, clinton chose the dirtbag route, kept getting his rocks off & soiling the reputation of the White House and this country. HE allowed the terrorists to roam free and Osama & his henchmen plotted the most evil destruction in american history on our soil! In this process, we also lost the only man that could track & find OBL every time, like radar. A man named mousaud, who was the leader of the Northern Alliance, but who was unfortunately assasinated by one of Osama's henchmen just before the 9/11 attacks. His group was completely against what Osama was up to, and was totally on our side. This and many other important events leading up to the 9/11 attacks, are what this really good docu-drama is all about. It must be seen by all who are in SEARCH of the REAL truth and not what the dirty politicians on the democrats side or the media such as CNN & MSNBC would have you to believe.

It's a reminder as to what happens when we become too complacent and allow evil to run free in the world. Let's face it, the Clinton administration had many opportunities to bring down Osama but failed to do so because they didn't view him as much of a threat. How wrong the Clintons were.Make no mistake about it, this is a truthful and unbiased documentary based on the 9/11 commission findings. It even places some blame on the Bush administration (such as Condi ignoring a specific threat). However the facts support the conclusion that the Clintons were overwhelmingly responsible for putting us on the path to 9/11.Unfortunately you can't even buy this DVD because the Clintons have used political pressure to sensor the truth. I hope that by posting positive reviews here, patriots and fans of this film can exert our own pressure on ABC -- pressure from our wallets.
