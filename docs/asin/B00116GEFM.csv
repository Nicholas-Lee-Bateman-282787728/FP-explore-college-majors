1130067,A6KNR46BDWOJU,B00116GEFM,JJ,"[1, 1]","I will try to make an adequate review of this film which deserves high praise and seems to be outside peoples radar.I have seen many many movies on or centered around the Holocaust, many of which did not measure up to being close to good film making. When I see, by far more reviews on The boy in Striped Pajamas than on this I wonder if today's society would rather see fiction or fact when it comes to the Holocaust in film genre. This I must point out IS a true story, a story that borders on amazement, luck and ingenuity beyond all else. This is a story of a boys personal triumph of survival in the face of evil, an evil determined to wipe he and all of his blood into extinction.Meet Alex, an 11 year old of Jewish ancestry whom among millions were herded into ghettos and concentration camps. This is the story of one of those millions, a boy imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto desperately seeking survival by any means necessary. When the ghetto is continuously emptied by German soldiers in their infamous ghetto roundups, the boy is left to fend for himself while his father is taken away from him during one of these roundups. Miraculously With a harrowing escape, Alex is able to hide and elude the Germans within the hidden places of the ghetto. You see a boy using his head and not making decisions based upon fear to hide amongst the ruins of a building blown apart, a building I believe that helped save his life as much as his own ingenuity did. Throughout the movie you see roundup after roundup, slowly emptying the Jews until it seems that Alex is all that is left but their was seemingly no end in site for Alex as he had to not only survive the Germans but also others of his own kind fighting to do the same.In the end I believe you will be happy that you purchased this film, it has enough triumph and moments of humor to take your mind off (If even for a moment) the death surrounding Alex at all times. It is rare to see a film of this caliber in a genre that is flooded with movies that make you sad. I leave it for you to decide but I see this as a breath of fresh air in the category even if it, at times, seems impossible for a boy to be so inventive at his age",5,A monument in film making..

Young Alex [Jordan Kizuik] is reassured by his father Stefan[Patrick Bergin] that he will return to find Alex upon the war's end [Stefan had been selected for deportation]. Alex manages to escape a similar fate or worse by eluding the Nazis, with the help of his old uncle [Jack Warden] who sacrifices his life to save Alex.Upon the ghetto's liquidation, Alex finds himself totally isolated and having to rely upon his wits to survive. His only constant companion is ""Snow"", a white mouse and Alex is also sustained by reading and re-reading passages from Robinson Crusoe [which also inspires him to survive using whatever resources he can find].The drama of Alex's survival unfolds at a steady and suspenseful pace - Alex soon discovers that there are other Jewish refugees just like him who are hiding in the ravaged ghetto and time and again, he sees these Jews being caught by the Nazis whilst eluding capture himself. By sheer ingenuity, Alex builds a sort of treehouse for himself in one of the derelict buildings in the ghetto and stares out of a window out onto the other side of the ghetto, where Polish Gentiles lead relatively ordinary lives, seemingly untouched by the Nazi atrocities. Eventually, events necessitate Alex's venturing out to the Aryan side, and though he realises the risks, Alex's adventurous streak wins over his caution. He is also lucky in coming across Polish Gentiles who sympathise with his plight, such as a Catholic priest, a Polish doctor who works for the Polish underground, and even makes a friend, a young girl who is kind and accepting of Alex, even after finding out that he's a Jew.Despite everything, Alex is adamant and determined to wait the war out in the remnants of the ghetto - and hoping against hope that he will be reunited with his father. Alex's resilience shines through every scene, as does his extraordinary courage, and the young actor that plays Alex has done an amazing job in bringing credibility to his role as the young boy with an indomitable spirit.""The Island on Bird Street"" is a unique Holocaust drama as it focuses on one individual's experience, that of a young boy. Another Holocaust drama that is told from a young boy's viewpoint is ""Fateless"", about a young Hungarian boy's experiences in a concentration camp during WW II.
