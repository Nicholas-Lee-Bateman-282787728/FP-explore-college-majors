Well it was for the following reasons:- The following three characters are absolutely unnecessary in this film: the person who plays Abhishek Bachan's wife, Bipasha Basu (both roles) and Uday Chopra.- Bipasha Basu is lusting after Abhishek Bachan - a person who is already married and soon to be a father.- The sound track was average- Why can Bipasha Basu's sister who resides in Brazil understand when Uday Chopra speaks Hindi and not when Abhishek Bachan speaks Hindi?- Uday Chopra - he is working on the physique but that face should not be appearing in Bollywood films in a hero roleThe storyline was fine because it was suppose to be a kind of action/fantasy type of film. Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan had great chemistry. It was an unlikely pair, but it works out well. Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachan do a great job in this film. Aishwarya Rai was the only female who had an important role, but even her character is a bimbo who says ""like"" in every sentence.It was a nice movie and despite the flaws, I would recommend watching it.",3,Dhoom 2,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1190,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'combine', 'hot', 'celebrities', 'cool', 'storyline', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'Dhoom', '2', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'following', 'reasons', 'following', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'person', 'who', 'Abhishek', 'Bachan', 'wife', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'roles', 'Uday', 'Chopra.-', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'lusting', 'Abhishek', 'Bachan', 'person', 'who', 'already', 'married', 'soon', 'be', 'father.-', 'sound', 'track', 'was', 'average-', 'Why', 'can', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'sister', 'who', 'Brazil', 'understand', 'when', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'Hindi', 'not', 'when', 'Abhishek', 'Bachan', 'Hindi', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'working', 'physique', 'face', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'appearing', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'hero', 'roleThe', 'storyline', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'kind', 'action/fantasy', 'type', 'film', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'was', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'out', 'well', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Abhishek', 'Bachan', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'was', 'only', 'female', 'who', 'had', 'important', 'role', 'even', 'character', 'bimbo', 'who', 'sentence.It', 'was', 'nice', 'movie', 'flaws', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching']",Dhoom 2
1052479,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000N301P8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 11]","The following refers to the 2-disc dvd set of DHOOM 2.Begin plot SPOILERS here: DHOOM 2: BACK IN ACTION marks the return of relentless supercop Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) and his dubious bandana-clad sidekick Ali (Uday Chopra), who himself is now in the police force. Released two years after the 2004 blockbuster picture DHOOM (a blockbuster in India, anyway), this sequel tells of Dixit and Ali's efforts to nab flashy international master thief Aryan, aka Mr. A (Hrithik Roshan, KRRISH), who has a fondness for disguises and techno-gadgetry and specializes in outrageously daring heists. Dixit and Ali are aided by ACP Shonali Bose (Bipasha Basu), a buxom college friend of Dixit's who had been tracking Aryan for the past two years and had become an expert on him.But it's Dixit who figures out early on that Aryan has a pattern to his thefts involving numbers and the letter ""A"" and thus is able to predict the date and site of his next crime. That site turns out to be Mumbai and what happens there sets off a frenetic cat and mouse hunt as Dixit, Ali, and Shonali pursue Aryan from metropolitan Mumbai all the way to exotic Brazil. It's a good thing for Aryan that he bumps into a beautiful petty thief named Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai) who teasingly calls him ""Funny Guy"" and talks him into a partnership. But will Sunehri's allegiance be enough for Aryan to escape the grasp of Mumbai law? End plot SPOILERS.If you've already checked out the first DHOOM and liked it, then DHOOM 2 is more of the same. The hip posing, the attitudes, the buff bodies, the trendy wardrobe, the extreme sports style of action, that oh-so-catchy title tune...they're all here. This sequel showcases the same MTV-generated sensibilities of the first DHOOM. The polished, good looking stunts and elaborate action sequences again mimic the styles of John Woo and THE MATRIX. The thrills and intensity are juxtaposed with broad, goofball comedy and sizzling musical numbers, the last two being quite apropos of the Bollywood genre. And, yes, I did get weary of the glut of slo-mo sequences wherein the film tries to emphasize just how ""cool"" these folks are as they pose or bust a fight move for the camera.But, in spite of the corniness and cheesiness of it all, I'm giving this one three and a half stars because what matters most is that I had fun watching it. There's certainly enough eye candy here to lure in both genders. Though I enjoyed Abhishek Bachchan's work as the taciturn and unyielding Inspector Dixit, DHOOM 2, acting -wise, is served best by the chemistry between Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, who actually seem to be the prohibitive stars here. The magnetic Roshan puts in an ingratiating performance (never mind that he seems too aware of how good he looks on screen), and he's certainly athletic enough and displays several spiffy dance moves reminiscent of Justin Timberlake. Aishwarya Rai, though her character irked me at times with her constant self-referencing in the third person, remains the most beautiful woman in cinema and in life and a wonderful dancer. I don't think she had her best performance here - she makes for an improbable thief - but never mind. She and Roshan sizzle and even kiss on screen (causing an obscenity charge to be filed against them in India because kissing in Bollywood is very frowned upon). Meanwhile, Uday Chopra is good, goofy fun as Ali. I'm glad there was a callback to his funny daydream bits from the first movie. Lastly, Bipasha Basu is good as the no-nonsense but still very smoking Shonali Bose. But, don't get me wrong, she's not as hot as Aishwarya. Geez, she's not even as hot as Roshan.Now on to the dvd set. The dvd packaging has a neat pull tab that simultaneously causes both discs to extend in opposite directions for your grabbing pleasure. Disc one has the feature film as well as an option for song selection. The 2nd disc contains these special features: ""Master of Disguise"" - a breakdown of Mr. A's various disguises; ""Storyboard to Screen"" - image breakdowns (rough storyboard to computer visualization to actual live version) of the film's action sequences; ""D:2 Fashion Special"" - interviews with the cast re the look and style of their characters; 4 minutes of deleted scenes; 2 music videos ""Dhoom Again"" and a remix of ""Crazy""; tv promos; and the theatrrical trailer.Like the first DHOOM, DHOOM 2 holds a certain fascination for me in that the makers of the film seemed to blatantly care more about the look of the film, rather than the substance of it. The story is engaging enough, you can't really go wrong with a supercop versus charming master criminal scenario. But this movie, with its fast-paced editing and glossy, vibrant imagery, runs like a longer version of an MTV music video. And it seems to have worked as DHOOM and DHOOM 2 have made buckets of money, and, now, there's talk of a DHOOM 3. Me, yeah, I'm a fan of this series. The DHOOM films aren't too deep and thought provoking and aren't about to win any significant movie trophies. But it does what it sets out to do, which is to place the viewers in a world of escapism and then keep 'em there for two and a half hours or so. And, certainly, a film showcasing Aishwarya Rai playing hoops is worth viewing, right? Right.",4,DHOOM 2: flash overcomes substance,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,5264,"['following', 'refers', '2-disc', 'dvd', 'set', 'DHOOM', '2.Begin', 'plot', 'SPOILERS', 'here', 'DHOOM', '2', 'BACK',

Gardner,"[0, 0]","I'm a fan of both Bollywood movies and action films, and I liked the first Dhoom because it was fun: it had entertaining action sequences, characters that I ended up liking, and catchy music and dancing.  Unfortunately, the sequel was just mediocre in all of these respects, and despite having a better cast of actors, Dhoom 2 lacks the entertainment value of its predecessor.The action scenes, even at their most impressive, felt contrived or trite, as if I had seen all of these same ideas before in a better-executed form elsewhere.  Worse still were the dialogues, which made formerly entertaining characters like Jai (Abhishek Bachchan) into caricatures of their former selves.  The introduction of the new villains played by Hrithik Roshan and the wooden but beautiful Aishwarya Roy were no help to the film at all, and all scenes between these two seemed quite forced.The dance numbers are generally well choreographed and sexy, and show off Hrithik Roshan's athleticism perfectly.  However, the songs are fairly boring and seem to be mostly revisited versions of the first Dhoom's music.In short, you can do better than this whether you're looking for an action movie or a Bollywood movie or a Bollywood action movie.

1052484,A9E7JZ1328JC,B000N301P8,Lawrence Louis,"[1, 4]","Cheesiness reaches its apex with Dhoom 2 - Bollywood's attempt at creating a believable action film. Dhoom 2 is tackiness amplified to epic proportions. The space allotted, regrettably, isn't sufficient enough for me to adequately lambaste this picture. Bollywood needs to understand, that merely mimicking Matrix style effects and a few of the stunts seen in the Mission Impossible trilogy, doesn't make their rendition of these action classics as engrossing as the original films were. The American and Chinese action films, which Bollywood is so desperately trying to emulate, win over their audiences because the acting is, at the very least, decent, and the stories are engaging for the adult mind.The stunts, by the way, which by looking at the previews for Dhoom 2, is the movie's main selling point, are not anywhere as visually believable or artfully done as the ones done by the American films that Dhoom 2 tries to copy. The editing is so poor that one only sees the very beginning and tail end of a flip or a death defying jump. I gather that this is purposefully done to mask just how far Bollywood has to go before they can ever approach the action choreography and special effects wizardry of the Wackoski brothers, John Woo, or for that matter, an amateur film student in an American university.Particularly laughable was a scene in which the two law enforcement protagonists of the film jump off their motorcycles and coast on their feet beside their bikes, while the bikes are careening down the tunnel. This is supposed to mimic the same stunt performed by Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 2. What makes this so hilarious is that the entire scene is done in fast forward and in obscure lighting, which presumably is done so that you wouldn't see whatever mechanism was sliding under them to make them seem as if they were sliding on their own. Furthermore, the action performed in MI2 was done because the logic of the scene required it, since Tom Cruise was using his bike as cover, as his adversary was shooting at him from the other side. In this scene, from Dhoom2, there simply is no logic, because the bikes were moving straight forward into the oppositions hands, and thus jumping and sliding along the bike's side makes no sense.Speaking of things that are illogical, Dhoom2`s plot, whatever little of it that there is, could have been written by a brain damaged dance choreographer, since it is inundated with flash, but bereft of substance.  Basically you have a charming and narcissistic villain (played by Roshan) who seeks to steal priceless treasures and selects the locations of his various heists so as to form the letter ""A"" on the global map, which, naturally, is the letter of his name ""Aryan"".  Yes, even the lowliest simpleton should be rolling his eyes at this. It would seem that Aryan is as self-absorbed with his own perceived greatness, in very much the same manner that the filmmakers seem to be fooled into thinking that they have created a grade A thriller. Both, trust me, are gross delusions.Aryan is being pursued relentlessly by a police detective and his colleagues. Eventually a romantic relationship ensues between Roshan's character and Aishwarya Rai's character (an aspiring thief who cannot be taken seriously) through several brief interactions and embarrassingly teeny bopper style dialog (I swear if Rai kept using the word ""like"" in front of every statement and kept referring to herself in the third person I was going to ""like"" throw my shoe at the TV).Speaking of dialog, a note to Bollywood movie producers: Don't have your law enforcement agents say idiotic things like ""Aryan is the coolest criminal in the world"" during police debriefing scenes. How absolutely asinine can you be? The criminal underworld and the police are supposed to be intensely antagonistic towards each other, not complementing each other like love struck school children. Granted there can be latent admiration, even among heroes and villains in a film, but the key here is that this admiration goes unstated.Ultimately the film goes back and forth, with twists that are pulled out of thin air. Again Bollywood needs to understand that a plot twist is only successful in impressing adult minds when there is a sufficient background story that subtly leads up to the twist.  This film lacks both a back story and subtlety.All of this culminates in acting that are more one dimensional than Saturday morning cartoon characters, a plot that seems created ad hoc so as to provide an excuse to perform the poorly executed stunts, and finally a climax that is so anticlimactic that one sits through the dance infested end credits roll with a dumbfounded look as if to ask oneself: ""how did I sit through such cinematic garbage for so long?""Sorry Bollywood, but if Dhoom2 is your submission for a good action film, then you need to stick to traditional song and dance number comedies and romances. Dhoom2 lacks originality - a thing that has eluded Bollywood ever since its inception. It is devoid of an engaging plot, or relatable characters. When one says they are Indian, there is much they can rightly be proud of.  Dhoom2 and the Indian movie industry that spawned it, should give those same Indians ample fodder to contemplate disavowing their heritage. Yes, the movie is just that bad!",1,This is an amateurish movie.

From the reviews we weren't expecting much from Dhoom 1 but actually found it quite watchable.Dhoom 2 is definitely the reason to buy the set though (and it's nice to know what happened in Dhoom 1 first- though not essential).It is an action movie of the Mission Impossible type. Great action and stunts, not really that much violence. It is more about stunts and cleverness and a hunt for a theif. There are disguises for Hrithik that are done well (and the extras that show how they did the transformation are interesting too) including Hrithik as an old woman.Hrithik is just riveting to watch. He is gorgeous, acts well and his dancing is superb. He really gets a chance to strut his stuff. So does Ash who does a very different modern dance for her and brings it off well. Abhishek has poorer material to work with than in Dhoom 1 - particularly in relation to his screen wife. However he does bring more maturity to his acting in some of what he is given and rises to the occasion. Uday Chopra is very good as the comic sidekick too.The dances are very MTV and the music contemporary and upbeat. There are some catchy ones that stay with you if you like this movie style.This is a guilty pleasure movie - unlikely but thoroughly entertaining.I have returned to watch the song and dance sequences several times.It has romance and Hrithik and Ash do that well. But I have  a Sri Lankan female friend who just likes the Bollywood romances and disliked this one as having too much action for her. In our case we were a mother and daughter watching it together and both of us really enjoyed it.Dhoom 1 is more about boys and motorbikes. Now I thought this would be ho-hum but actually it was quite watchable. John Abraham played the part of hunk with aplomb though. Abhishek and Uday did well with their parts too.I'm glad I did buy the 2-disk set rather than just get the more tecommended Dhoom 2",5,Guilty pleasure - very enjoyable - Dhoom 2 particularly an entertainer by Dhoom 1 not bad,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,1937,"['set', 'Dhoom', '1', 'Dhoom', '2', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Dhoom', '1', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'watchable.Dhoom', '2', 'definitely', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'nice', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Dhoom', '1', 'first-', 'not', 'essential', '.It', 'action', 'movie', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'type', 'Great', 'action', 'stunts', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'violence', 'more', 'stunts', 'cleverness', 'hunt', 'theif', 'are', 'disguises', 'Hrithik', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'extras', 'show', 'how', 'did', 'transformation', 'are', 'interesting', 'too', 'including', 'Hrithik', 'old', 'woman.Hrithik', 'just', 'riveting', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'dancing', 'superb', 'really', 'chance', 'strut', 'stuff', 'So', 'Ash', 'who', 'very', 'different', 'modern', 'dance', 'off', 'well', 'Abhishek', 'poorer', 'material', 'work', 'Dhoom', '1', 'particularly', 'relation', 'screen', 'wife', 'However', 'bring', 'more', 'maturity', 'acting', 'what', 'given', 'occasion', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'very', 'good', 'comic', 'sidekick', 'too.The', 'dances', 'are', 'very', 'MTV', 'music', 'contemporary', 'upbeat', 'are', 'catchy', 'ones', 'stay', 'like', 'movie', 'style.This', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining.I', 'have', 'returned', 'watch', 'song', 'dance', 'sequences', 'several', 'times.It', 'romance', 'Hrithik', 'Ash', 'do', 'well', 'have', 'Sri', 'Lankan', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'just', 'Bollywood', 'romances', 'disliked', 'one', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'case', 'were', 'mother', 'daughter', 'watching', 'together', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.Dhoom', '1', 'more', 'boys', 'motorbikes', 'Now', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'ho-hum', 'actually', 'was', 'quite', 'watchable', 'John', 'Abraham', 'played', 'part', 'hunk', 'aplomb', 'Abhishek', 'Uday', 'did', 'well', 'parts', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'buy', '2-disk', 'set', 'rather', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'tecommended', 'Dhoom', '2']",Dhoom 2
