I like the first season and part of the third but the ones that come after that are completely horrible! My fave episode from season two has to be when Jack admits that he is gay, when he reads that poem he wrote in front of his English class, it's hilarious 'cause the poem is about a guy, all of a sudden he is gay? brilliant! Dawson and Joey begin to date and Jen goes back to her old ways (sleeping around) and Pacey has his first real relationship with Jack's mentally disturbed sister, Andie. Andie and Pacey's relationship is so moving and touching, I thought their chemistry was much stronger than when Pacey started having feelings for Joey in the third season.

781369,A1WHKR23N2DAP,B0000E5NPY,Brian Young,"[0, 0]","I have to say that this season is a major improvement over the first. After watching the first season, I wasn't super excited about starting the second. I was pretty annoyed by several of the characters, and the drama was a little too cheesy at times (I knew it would be, but some of the dialogue and scenes in the first season were just too corny).However, the second season really expands the storyline (i.e. focuses less on specific characters), and it also brings a bunch of new elements into the story. The issues presented in this season are far more complex than those in the first, and there just seems to be a lot more going on in this one. I was glad to see the introduction of some new characters and scenarios, which helped to propel the season forward and add some diversity.The reason that I am only giving this 4 stars is that I was still a little irked by some of the characters, especially Dawson. Though the dialogue is smart and well-done, it just doesn't fit high school students, and I was further annoyed by the fact that all the characters talk about how analytical they are, but they do little more than that.However, this season was way better than the first, and if you weren't a fan of the first, try this one out.",4,An Improvement,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,1241,"['have', 'say', 'season', 'major', 'improvement', 'first', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'super', 'excited', 'starting', 'second', 'was', 'pretty', 'annoyed', 'several', 'characters', 'drama', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'cheesy', 'times', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'corny', '.However', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'storyline', 'i.e', 'less', 'specific', 'characters', 'also', 'bunch', 'new', 'elements', 'story', 'issues', 'presented', 'season', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'one', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'scenarios', 'helped', 'propel', 'season', 'forward', 'add', 'diversity.The', 'reason', 'am', 'only', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'irked', 'characters', 'especially', 'Dawson', 'dialogue', 'smart', 'well-done', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'was', 'further', 'annoyed', 'fact', 'characters', 'talk', 'how', 'analytical', 'are', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'that.However', 'season', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'first', 'were', ""n't"", 'fan', 'first', 'try', 'one', 'out']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season

Jen changes her hair and dosent hang out with the gang as much, Jack is introduced, and Dawsons parents get divorced. So yeah. this has 22 episodes which is a little under half more than season one. And nearly every episode is great!What I like most about ""Dawson's"" is that it totally deals with true problems of teens and stuff like Divorce, illness', love, friendship, death, and sexuality.

781371,A3UQ3PNURYB0N3,B0000E5NPY,Daniel Sutton,"[5, 7]","Dear Amazonians,I was introduced to the Dawson's Creek clan later on in the series.  I had not watched it all the way from the beginning.I must say that what struck me the most by watching this television series is the honest and straightforward presentation of teen life, and how a group of friends gets along through all kinds of diverse relationships.  This show is among precious few that incorporated homosexuality into the relationships among its characters at the time of its initial airing  Today, however, there are more such shows, thanks to Dawson's Creek, and the sitcom ""Will and Grace.""  This kind of show is especially important today, as there are some in our society who do not fully understand what gay people are about, and how very much like everyone else they are.  The issues that the gay community relates to are mostly about being accepted by the other members of society.  Otherwise, the gay community is just like any other kind of community.The fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts is very small, and undiverse.  There are virtually no African-Americans or gay people there (although some people there may be gay, they are not ""out"").  Jack McPhee, a gay man who eventually comes out to his conservative and abusive father is a big inspiration to his friends and schoolmates in Capeside.  Eventually, his peers embrace him as a full-fledged member of their ""group.""To me, this is a very progressive show that really shows that all relationships are about love and acceptance, no matter who is involved.  I highly recommend this series to all who are interested in a real and honest look at the lives of young people, and how they grow into each other in a veery nice way.Take care,--Daniel",5,A truly heartfelt and educational television series,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,1721,"['Dear', 'Amazonians', 'was', 'introduced', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'clan', 'later', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'way', 'beginning.I', 'must', 'say', 'what', 'struck', 'most', 'watching', 'television', 'series', 'honest', 'straightforward', 'presentation', 'teen', 'life', 'how', 'group', 'friends', 'along', 'kinds', 'diverse', 'relationships', 'show', 'precious', 'few', 'incorporated', 'homosexuality', 'relationships', 'characters', 'time', 'initial', 'airing', 'Today', 'however', 'are', 'more', 'such', 'shows', 'thanks', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'sitcom', 'Will', 'Grace', 'kind', 'show', 'especially', 'important', 'today', 'are', 'society', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'issues', 'gay', 'community', 'are', 'mostly', 'being', 'accepted', 'other', 'members', 'society', 'Otherwise', 'gay', 'community', 'just', 'other', 'kind', 'community.The', 'fictional', 'town', 'Capeside', 'Massachusetts', 'very', 'small', 'undiverse', 'are', 'virtually', 'African-Americans', 'gay', 'people', 'there', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'gay', 'are', 'not', 'Jack', 'McPhee', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'eventually', 'out', 'conservative', 'abusive', 'father', 'big', 'inspiration', 'friends', 'schoolmates', 'Capeside', 'Eventually', 'peers', 'embrace', 'full-fledged', 'member', 'group', 'very', 'progressive', 'show', 'really', 'relationships', 'are', 'love', 'acceptance', 'matter', 'who', 'involved', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'real', 'honest', 'look', 'lives', 'young', 'people', 'how', 'grow', 'other', 'veery', 'nice', 'way.Take', 'care', 'Daniel']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season

The real romance this season came from Pacey and Andie. Their relationship was really touching and beautiful. When Jack came out of the closet, it was riveting and emotional.

It's unrealistic, but that's OK.  It's very entertaining and thought provoking.  If Pacey had as extensive of vocabulary as on the show, he would have done remarkably well on the vocabulary section of the PSAT.  By the way, when do students now take the PSAT?There are also incongruities about the apparent size of the community of Capeside and and size of the school and inconsistencies with the actors' personna from time to time.  And, there are lots of issues packed into such a relatively small school, but I understand that the writers have to keep it interesting even if it strains credibility some.

Tons of issues arise, such as friendships falling apart, divorce, coming out, falling in and out love etc. etc. Each character is given their own storyline this season and each one is just as intriquing as the others. In this season, Dawson adn Joey get together only to break up once Joey falls for the new guy in town Jack. Pacey meets and falls in love with the highstrung, overachieving Andie McPhee, and Jenn starts going back to her wild days in New York, drinking, partying, and having sex. Theres only a few duds in the season, but we get some excellent episodes such as The Election, in which Joey and Andie run for class presidents in which the whole school learns the truth about Andie and Jacks mother, It involves a touching scene between Pacey and the mother in a grocery store, which I'm convinced is the reason so many fell in love with Pacey instead od Dawson. The heartbreaking 2 parter of Jacks coming out, in which Kerr Smith gives an emotional and intense performance as he deals with coming out of the closet to his family and friends. Katie Holmes remains the center of the show in my opinion, always giving a sincere and honest look at a real teenager. James Van Der Beek goes a little over the top at times, but Joshua Jackson as Pacey steals every scene he is in. Always charming and likeable, and the underdog you always root for in the end. Michelle Williams is always very subtle in her performances and can handle drama and comedy and handles both very well. The only problem I have with Season 2 is Monica Keena becoming a major recurring character as Abby. She is one of the worst actresses on television, and I can't understand why she was chosen let alone kept for the entire season. However, we do say goodbye to Abby after this season. Last but not least, I love the character of Andie, Paceys girlfriend, and thought that her storylines were well written and  intriquing. However, Meredith Monroe, gets runner up for the worst actress working in television. The girl does not understand the word subtlety, and after awhile, I wanted to skip her scenese because I could not bare to watch her over the top performances.

Bernabo,"[9, 12]","The pivotal episode in the second season of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; is, ironically enough, the second episode, &quot;Crossroads.&quot;  That is the one where Dawson and Joey are so caught up in their budding romance that they forget about Pacey's birthday while Jen begins a strange friendship with Abby.  Certainly the theme of the second season was the idea of transitions as Dawson and Joey have trouble enjoying finally being together (&quot;The Kiss&quot;) before their romance explodes (&quot;The Dance&quot;), Pacey hooks up with smart girl Andie (&quot;Full Moon Rising&quot;) and her complicated family (&quot;The Reluctant Hero&quot;), Jack comes to the realization he is gay (&quot;To Be or Not To Be...&quot; and &quot;That is the Question&quot;), and Jen's reckless lifestyle leads to a tragic climax (&quot;A Perfect Wedding&quot;).Pacey clearly becomes the central figure in the Capeside crew during season two, mainly because he keeps sticking up for others, such as Jack when he reads his infamous poem in class and Andie when her father wants her to leave Capeside, and even himself, in a fateful confrontation with his father.  Dawson is too busy playing the part of Hamlet, almost always too immobilized by over thinking his life's problems to actually do anything about them.  Of course, when he finally does act, and forces Joey to confront the fact that her father is getting involved with trafficking drugs again, it ends up being the apparent death blow to their friendship (&quot;Parental Discretion Advised&quot;).I should point out that I have a somewhat warped perspective on this series because I started watching it when the gang graduated from high school.  I just happened to catch that episode and the following fall I started watching the series because my students wanted to watch it for the television unit of my Popular Culture class.  Consequently I know that Dawson made it out of high school with his virginity intact, which means that when I watch all of his sexual angst in the first four seasons of the series I know that rooting for the boy is not going to do any good.  So of course I end up rooting for Pacey.  Nobility is always much more impressive when it is a surprise.  I wanted to root for Jack, but as much as the show deserves credit for having a gay teenage character, &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; really did not know what to do with him and I shudder to think what sort of mixed messages this gave to the thousands of teenagers who were trying to relate to the character and his situation (what Jack needed was a really good gay friend, where their friendship confused all of the stereotypical presumptions about gay people).Ultimately having the show become about Pacey and Andie rather than Dawson and Joey rings false, because &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; is at its best when those two are on the front burner.  As long as it is the last day of the year and I am in the mood to think great thoughts, I will throw out the idea that for this generation of television viewers the Dawson-Joey-Pacey triangle is their version of the Arthur-Guenivere-Lancelot story.  That over inflated idea would justify the ways things worked out in the end as much as anything else.  Now if somebody could just explain why Joey has so few tops that reach down below the top of her jeans that would be one less thing to worry about next year.",5,Pacey and Andie take over for Dawson and Joey in Season 2,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,3381,"['pivotal', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'ironically', 'enough', 'second', 'episode', 'quot', 'Crossroads.', 'quot', 'one', 'where', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'budding', 'romance', 'forget', 'Pacey', 'birthday', 'Jen', 'strange', 'friendship', 'Abby', 'Certainly', 'theme', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'idea', 'transitions', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'have', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'finally', 'being', 'together', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'quot', 'romance', 'explodes', 'quot', 'Dance', 'quot', 'Pacey', 'up', 'smart', 'girl', 'Andie', 'quot', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Rising', 'quot', 'complicated', 'family', 'quot', 'Reluctant', 'Hero', 'quot', 'Jack', 'realization', 'gay', 'quot', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', 'quot', 'quot', 'Question', 'quot', 'Jen', 'reckless', 'lifestyle', 'tragic', 'climax', 'quot', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Wedding', 'quot', '.Pacey', 'clearly', 'central', 'figure', 'Capeside', 'crew', 'season', 'two', 'mainly', 'sticking', 'up', 'others', 'such', 'Jack', 'when', 'infamous', 'poem', 'class', 'Andie', 'when', 'father', 'leave', 'Capeside', 'even', 'fateful', 'confrontation', 'father', 'Dawson', 'too', 'busy', 'playing', 'part', 'Hamlet', 'almost', 'always', 'too', 'immobilized', 'thinking', 'life', 'problems', 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'course', 'when', 'finally', 'act', 'forces', 'Joey', 'confront', 'fact', 'father', 'getting', 'involved', 'trafficking', 'drugs', 'again', 'up', 'being', 'apparent', 'death', 'blow', 'friendship', 'quot', 'Parental', 'Discretion', 'Advised', 'quot', '.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'have', 'somewhat', 'warped', 'perspective', 'series', 'started', 'watching', 'when', 'gang', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'happened', 'catch', 'episode', 'following', 'fall', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'students', 'wanted', 'watch', 'television', 'unit', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'class', 'Consequently', 'know', 'Dawson', 'made', 'high', 'school', 'virginity', 'intact', 'when', 'watch', 'sexual', 'angst', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'series', 'know', 'rooting', 'boy', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'good', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'Pacey', 'Nobility', 'always', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'surprise', 'wanted', 'root', 'Jack', 'as', 'much', 'show', 'credit', 'having', 'gay', 'teenage', 'character', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'shudder', 'think', 'what', 'sort', 'mixed', 'messages', 'gave', 'thousands', 'teenagers', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'relate', 'character', 'situation', 'what', 'Jack', 'needed', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'gay', 'friend', 'where', 'friendship', 'confused', 'stereotypical', 'presumptions', 'gay', 'people', '.Ultimately', 'having', 'show', 'become', 'Pacey', 'Andie', 'rather', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'rings', 'false', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'best', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'front', 'burner', 'As', 'long', 'last', 'day', 'year', 'am', 'mood', 'think', 'great', 'thoughts', 'will', 'throw', 'out', 'idea', 'generation', 'television', 'viewers', 'Dawson-Joey-Pacey', 'triangle', 'version', 'Arthur-Guenivere-Lancelot', 'story', 'inflated', 'idea', 'would', 'justify', 'ways', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'end', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'Now', 'somebody', 'could', 'just', 'explain', 'why', 'Joey', 'so', 'few', 'tops', 'reach', 'down', 'top', 'jeans', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'less', 'thing', 'worry', 'next', 'year']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season

The Season 2 Premiere is actually one of my favorite episodes of Dawson's Creek. It deals perfectly with first date jitters and the excitement that goes with it. We are also introduced to Andie who charmingly begins her love/hate banter with Pacey. The first episode of Season 2 is definitely up there with the best of Season 1.Then it goes slightly downhill from there. Not totally. Season 2 is one of the best seasons of Dawson's Creek. It starts to go bad when we begin to sense the impending break-up of Dawson and Joey, which seems a little too contrived to me. In fact it's never really entirely clear why Dawson and Joey break-up which is what leaves me feeling unsettled. Still, we move on through the season nonetheless.Other plotlines include the evolution of Pacey and Andie's relationship, Andie's brother Jack dating Joey after she breaks up with Dawson and then discovering he is gay, Jen going off the rails, Dawson and Joey getting back together, and Dawson and Joey breaking up again.Another interesting point, is that throughout Season 1 Dawson was the centre of attention because we as the audience admired Joey's love for him, but since Joey lost interest in Dawson during Season 2, so did some of the audience. I think this continued throughout the rest of the entire series.All Season 2 episodes are included. It is also the last DVD boxset to feature the original theme song ""I Don't Want To Wait"" sung by Paula Cole. All subsequent DVD boxset releases (The Season Final DVD excluded) feature the alternative theme song sung by Jann Arden. I first saw Dawson's Creek internationally where the Jann Arden song was used only during the first season and I actually preferred it, but it is true that the Jann Arden song sets a slower pace for the show (which worked for Season 1), whereas Paula Cole's song ups the tempo slightly (which works nicely for Season 2). You will also find that some of the other songs have been changed too- this is because of various legal reasons, and was beyond the producers' control, forcing them to pick alternatives. It is a shame that the original songs weren't used in some instances here. Try not to worry too much though because most of the originals are still here.The show is presented in Full Screen. The only DVD extras are commentaries on the Season Premiere and Season Finale.

The characters spend a lot of time quibbling about how their parents are emotionally detached, or place too much pressure on them, or their parents are too normal and boring, or they don't even have parents. The show begins to comfortably ensconce itself into the structure it strictly abides by in years to come: when things are settling down, someone has to break up with someone over a small problem, and rationalize whatever they've done with enough run-on sentences to send you climbing up the walls.Equipped with a mighty vocabulary and an even mightier naivete, Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) embarks on the tumultuous quest of his sophomore year of high school, where his much-talked-about relationship with Joey will last a few episodes before the writers decide they aren't giving their characters quite enough to complain about. Hyper-aware to the last iota, Joey (the now infamous Katie Holmes) starts to fill into the central role she will later assume as the series progresses as she dates artsy good-guy Jack, who provides one of the show's most interesting and groundbreaking plot points as he comes out of the closet in a wrencher of a two-parter. In fact, if it weren't for Jack and emotionally strung-out Jen (who this season spends quality time letting her hair down with petite teen villain Abby Morgan), the every-day-is-the-end-of-the-world melodrama and squeamishly sitcom scenarios of season two would fall flat, and fast.As Dawson deals with his parents' emotional baggage (and no one seems to care), the rest of the characters rigidly pair off to their own individual plotlines. Under the tutelage of perky but problematic Andie, sister of Jack, Pacey starts to come into his own - that is, until her mental health starts to decline. Their father is absent, their mother is a delusional wreck, and they are basically maintaining their household single-handedly. Isn't it convenient that every mildly interesting character has to wag their fingers with a devastating monologue about how hard they have it? And why, oh why, do every one of these characters exhaustively analyze their silly pre-adult pratfalls without actually taking the initiative to avoid them?This year, DAWSON'S CREEK is dry - not only its humor (Joey catcalls a female instigator ""persnickety"" with a wry smile that suggests she is the only one in the world that knows what's what), but its story arcs - but remains wet with the tears of unhappy and pretentious young adults who will use every opportunity to ruin what is actually going right in their lives.

I blame shows like ""90210"" and ""The OC"" for this.Dawson's Creek may have been a ""teen drama"" but it was very real for the most part. The actors (unlike the 90210 ""actors"")  weren't pretty high school students that looked like twenty-eight year old models and they weren't bombarded with the ludicrous OC type of ""everyday teen plots"" that would never happen to any real teen. Dawson and his friends (with the exception of Pacey) went through the same things we all went through in high school. I've never seen actual realism in a teen drama before I saw Dawson's Creek for the first time. Critics seem to think that It's a teen ""soap-opera"" with pretty people that are phonies. I think they must have been in home-school when they were in high school if they truly believe this.The second season of Dawson's Creek is worth your money if you like great drama with a good sense of realism. It really sets up a powerful and excellent third season that really portrays real teen love in a nice way.",3,This is a show that gets picked on unfairly,1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,1100,"['People', 'never', 'give', 'teen', 'dramas', 'respect', 'deserve', 'often', 'consider', 'trashy', 'melodramatic', 'blame', 'shows', '90210', 'OC', 'this.Dawson', 'Creek', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'teen', 'drama', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'most', 'part', 'actors', '90210', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'looked', 'twenty-eight', 'year', 'old', 'models', 'were', ""n't"", 'bombarded', 'ludicrous', 'OC', 'type', 'everyday', 'teen', 'plots', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'teen', 'Dawson', 'friends', 'exception', 'Pacey', 'went', 'same', 'things', 'went', 'high', 'school', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actual', 'realism', 'teen', 'drama', 'saw', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'first', 'time', 'Critics', 'seem', 'think', 'teen', 'soap-opera', 'pretty', 'people', 'are', 'phonies', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'home-school', 'when', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'truly', 'believe', 'this.The', 'second', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'money', 'like', 'great', 'drama', 'good', 'sense', 'realism', 'really', 'up', 'powerful', 'excellent', 'third', 'season', 'really', 'real', 'teen', 'love', 'nice', 'way']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season
781392,A1FII6B4HLS8XR,B0000E5NPY,"Shawn Walden ""OtisBLKR1""","[1, 1]","Im almost done with season two (the last episode left) and i can already tell you season two is better than season one, the show relaxes alot (SPOILER ALERT) and its nolonger all about Dawson and Joey. Although i still have a very hard time buying the idea that these two star crossed teens finialy get together at the end of season one, Joey who is clearly head over heals about dawson has some awakening and decides at the age of 16 that if she cant make her whole life about Dawson and dumps him only to hook up with the bus boy 10 seconds later.. Im also a little bothered that the start of the show (or so we all think) Dawson has been dumped twice now.. With that out of the way, the show introduces and we get to know some new characters, and the plot doesnt revolve around Joey and Dawson constantly. Athough the tension is always there and you can just feel at any moment they may get back together. The language and thought process of these 16 year old's is a bit to swallow (again if you can try and think like a 16 year old you will overlook this).. Season two is fun and the main characters all seem to be developing, growing maturing, I think season two is where most of us back in the day got hooked. Im looking forward to covering season three next week and writing my review on it.Ok update, there were several good twists at the end of season two. the kids of capeside sure dont seem like ""kids"" at this point and the plots getting thicker.. Dawson getting dumped again (this is twice now by Joey) is a real kicker.. but then again the way they just slid back into a relationship together seemed underdeveloped to me. this is a plot downfall and i didnt like it.  We experienced a death just outside the core group and frankly i dont think anybody was real upset that this girl died (besides Jen) and this is expected.  My personal opinion and the best plot turn is Jen moving back in with ""Grams"" and bringing newly homeless Gay Jack with her.. Bible thumping Grandma is going to have a hoot in season 3. Pacey finialy makes a father son connection with his dad and his semi-nut job G/F ""Andi"" leaves capeside for medical attention. So its going to be intresting to see what Pacey Does..So for a recap:  Im looking forward to breaking the plastic seal on season three this week becouse i want to see in order of importance..#1 How things develop under Grams roof with Jen & Jack#2 How Pacey Copes with Andi being gone.#3 Is Dawsons Mom taking the out of state job? If so is Dawsons dad moving back in to the leery house ?#4 Dawson and Joey ? where's it going ?At this point and i hate to admit it as the story is suppose to revolve around Dawson and Joey.. im already bored with there relationship. She's dumped him twice, both times shortly after the relationship started.. at this point i feel pretty bad for Dawson. Lets see where season 3 takes us.",4,season two got better !,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,2871,"['Im', 'almost', 'done', 'season', 'two', 'last', 'episode', 'left', 'i', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'season', 'two', 'better', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'alot', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'nolonger', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'i', 'still', 'have', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'buying', 'idea', 'two', 'star', 'crossed', 'teens', 'finialy', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'Joey', 'who', 'clearly', 'head', 'heals', 'dawson', 'awakening', 'decides', 'age', '16', 'cant', 'make', 'whole', 'life', 'Dawson', 'dumps', 'only', 'hook', 'up', 'bus', 'boy', '10', 'seconds', 'later..', 'Im', 'also', 'little', 'bothered', 'start', 'show', 'so', 'think', 'Dawson', 'been', 'dumped', 'twice', 'now..', 'way', 'show', 'introduces', 'get', 'know', 'new', 'characters', 'plot', 'doesnt', 'revolve', 'Joey', 'Dawson', 'constantly', 'tension', 'always', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'moment', 'may', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'language', 'thought', 'process', '16', 'year', 'old', 'bit', 'swallow', 'again', 'can', 'try', 'think', '16', 'year', 'old', 'will', 'overlook', '..', 'Season', 'two', 'fun', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'developing', 'growing', 'maturing', 'think', 'season', 'two', 'where', 'most', 'back', 'day', 'got', 'hooked', 'Im', 'looking', 'forward', 'covering', 'season', 'three', 'next', 'week', 'writing', 'review', 'it.Ok', 'update', 'were', 'several', 'good', 'twists', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'kids', 'capeside', 'sure', 'dont', 'seem', 'kids', 'point', 'plots', 'getting', 'thicker..', 'Dawson', 'getting', 'dumped', 'again', 'twice', 'now', 'Joey', 'real', 'kicker..', 'then', 'again', 'way', 'just', 'slid', 'back', 'relationship', 'together', 'seemed', 'underdeveloped', 'plot', 'downfall', 'i', 'didnt', 'experienced', 'death', 'just', 'core', 'group', 'frankly', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'anybody', 'was', 'real', 'upset', 'girl', 'died', 'Jen', 'expected', 'personal', 'opinion', 'best', 'plot', 'turn', 'Jen', 'moving', 'back', 'Grams', 'bringing', 'newly', 'homeless', 'Gay', 'Jack', 'her..', 'Bible', 'thumping', 'Grandma', 'going', 'have', 'hoot', 'season', '3', 'Pacey', 'finialy', 'father', 'son', 'connection', 'dad', 'semi-nut', 'job', 'G/F', 'Andi', 'capeside', 'medical', 'attention', 'going', 'be', 'intresting', 'see', 'what', 'Pacey', 'Does..So', 'recap', 'Im', 'looking', 'forward', 'breaking', 'plastic', 'seal', 'season', 'three', 'week', 'becouse', 'i', 'want', 'see', 'order', 'importance..', '1', 'How', 'things', 'develop', 'Grams', 'roof', 'Jen', 'Jack', '2', 'How', 'Pacey', 'Copes', 'Andi', 'being', 'gone.', '3', 'Is', 'Dawsons', 'Mom', 'taking', 'out', 'state', 'job', 'so', 'Dawsons', 'dad', 'moving', 'back', 'leery', 'house', '4', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'where', 'going', 'point', 'i', 'hate', 'admit', 'story', 'suppose', 'revolve', 'Dawson', 'Joey..', 'im', 'already', 'bored', 'relationship', 'dumped', 'twice', 'times', 'shortly', 'relationship', 'started..', 'point', 'i', 'feel', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Dawson', 'Lets', 'see', 'where', 'season', '3']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season

781395,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B0000E5NPY,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[19, 23]","DO NOT READ IF NOT HAVE SEEN SEASON!!!!Well here it finally is, the complete Second season of Dawson's Creek.  This is agruablly the best season the show had.  I remember when it was when, for me atleast, Dawson went from an ""oh well i missed an episode"" to a ... I MISSED ANY EPISODE (followed by a kick to a book).  After this season the show lost its executive producer and creator Kevin Williamson, and his leaving can definatly be felt in the later seasons, but im getting ahead of myself.  The second season starts right where the first season left of (to the second) and continues to tell the story of the gangs freshman year of Highschool.The Second season is basically a continuation of the first season with one major difference... the addition of two characters.  One character is Andie McPhee and pretty-blonde who hates Pacey, so they naturally become an item.  And the other character is Jack McPhee Andies brother, who after a few month becomes Jen's best friend.  These characters has a diffent effect on the show, and Jack stays for the remander of the series, while Andie sticks around for a few years.This is a teen soap, so it would be pretty hard to explain the story-line of an entire season but I will try... Dawson and Joey go out until Joey realizes that she wants to find herself, and breaks up with DAwson, but then starts to go out with Jack until he realizes he is Gay, then joey floots until she wants to get back together with DAwson but won't because he helped put her father back in Jail.  Pacey meets a girl, that he falls inlove with, but who has problems nobody could foresee.  Jen becomes an drunk outcast that only sobbers up when her friend Abby is killed.  And Dawson just floats as usually, trying to figure out what to do about his parents.The Second Season Episodes are The Kiss, Crossroads, Alternate Lifestyles, Tamara's Return, Full Moon Rising (my personal season favorite), The Dance, the All-nighter, The Relucant Hero, The Election, High Risk Behavor (Argueably the best episode of the series), Sex She Wrote, Uncharted Waters, His Leading Lady, To Be or not to Be (1), ...That is the Question (2) (Changed television history), Be Carefull what you wish for, Psychic Friends, A Perfect Wedding, Reunited, Ch... Ch.... Changes, Parental Discretion Advised.The Special Featurs for the season include Audio Commentaries (Can't figure out which episodes yet email me if you do (moviemancritter@yahoo.com)), Featurette, Interactive Map of Capeside, Music Video, and DVD-Rom.So Sit back and remember what it was like to be 15 and have the vocabulary of a 35 year old english professor.",5,"The end of Something Simple, & the Beginning of Everything",1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,2629,"['DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'IF', 'NOT', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'SEASON', 'Well', 'here', 'finally', 'complete', 'Second', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'agruablly', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'when', 'atleast', 'Dawson', 'went', 'oh', 'well', 'i', 'missed', 'episode', 'MISSED', 'ANY', 'EPISODE', 'followed', 'kick', 'book', 'season', 'show', 'lost', 'executive', 'producer', 'creator', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'leaving', 'can', 'definatly', 'be', 'felt', 'later', 'seasons', 'getting', 'ahead', 'second', 'season', 'starts', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'season', 'left', 'second', 'tell', 'story', 'gangs', 'freshman', 'year', 'Highschool.The', 'Second', 'season', 'basically', 'continuation', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'major', 'difference', 'addition', 'two', 'characters', 'One', 'character', 'Andie', 'McPhee', 'pretty-blonde', 'who', 'Pacey', 'naturally', 'become', 'item', 'other', 'character', 'Jack', 'McPhee', 'Andies', 'brother', 'who', 'few', 'month', 'Jen', 'best', 'friend', 'characters', 'diffent', 'effect', 'show', 'Jack', 'remander', 'series', 'Andie', 'sticks', 'few', 'years.This', 'teen', 'soap', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'hard', 'explain', 'story-line', 'entire', 'season', 'will', 'try', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'go', 'out', 'Joey', 'find', 'up', 'DAwson', 'then', 'go', 'out', 'Jack', 'Gay', 'then', 'joey', 'floots', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'DAwson', 'wo', ""n't"", 'helped', 'put', 'father', 'back', 'Jail', 'Pacey', 'girl', 'inlove', 'who', 'problems', 'nobody', 'could', 'foresee', 'Jen', 'drunk', 'outcast', 'only', 'up', 'when', 'friend', 'Abby', 'killed', 'Dawson', 'just', 'floats', 'usually', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'parents.The', 'Second', 'Season', 'Episodes', 'are', 'Kiss', 'Crossroads', 'Alternate', 'Lifestyles', 'Tamara', 'Return', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Rising', 'personal', 'season', 'favorite', 'Dance', 'All-nighter', 'Relucant', 'Hero', 'Election', 'High', 'Risk', 'Behavor', 'Argueably', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'Sex', 'Wrote', 'Uncharted', 'Waters', 'Leading', 'Lady', 'Be', 'not', 'Be', '1', 'Question', '2', 'Changed', 'television', 'history', 'Be', 'Carefull', 'what', 'wish', 'Psychic', 'Friends', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Wedding', 'Reunited', 'Ch', 'Ch', 'Changes', 'Parental', 'Discretion', 'Advised.The', 'Special', 'Featurs', 'season', 'include', 'Audio', 'Commentaries', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'yet', 'email', 'do', 'moviemancritter', '@', 'yahoo.com', 'Featurette', 'Interactive', 'Map', 'Capeside', 'Music', 'Video', 'DVD-Rom.So', 'Sit', 'back', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'be', '15', 'have', 'vocabulary', '35', 'year', 'old', 'english', 'professor']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season
