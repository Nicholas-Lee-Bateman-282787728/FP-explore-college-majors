I am not a fan of the movies, nor I want to read any of the books. It all seems so fluffy and lovely and childish, mostly done for a girls to fall in love with something that is extraordinary. It's not suppose to be all like that. Where's craziness in wolves, where's viciousness? You truly think, one drop of the blood will make it any better? Creatures are not deadly and so on. The list can go on and on. Here you find romance and all creatures seem to like the ugly girl,Bella. Really, I don't find her to be pretty even on a little bit. How come all characters have to be haunting her, loving her,et.c? C'mon it's what every girl would want to happen to her and that is what we see happening. I'm not going to waste my time on that. All I'm saying is I liked the both movies because of the wolf part and I am not willing not to watch it. Because I need to know if the movie will suddenly get any better or worse. Is it rated Teen or 7+? Oh give me a break. It's all so childish. I remember watching goosebumps as a kid. Hell that was better. But anyway I gave it 4 stars for I wanted to see it because of wolves. And at that time I kinda liked it.

For my age(29), its a total guilty pleasure, but I have no shame in going to see the movies at the first opportunity.My boyfriend was excited to tell me he got advanced screening tickets, but I was a little terrified of the 12 year old kids willing to run over adults for the perfect seat. Despite some major theatre hurdles(broken projector in the 1st theatre, OMG, here's the stampede of kids to the next theatre down the hall like Robert Pattinson himself is waiting for them), and seeing it with kids screaming like they're at a rock concert when Jacob takes his shirt off -- it was definitely a fun, entertaining movie.They fit a lot of the book in, with very minor changes, if any. The scenery is amazing, both the forests and the part that takes place in Italy. You can tell more $$ was sunk into this then the first one which had a tiny budget. But here's a shocker, my boyfriend later said if given the choice(of torture really, though he won't admit it to me for fear of hurting my feelings), he'd choose to rewatch the 1st movie over this one. It really depends on what part of the story interests you more. There's only a couple minutes of the Cullens as a family, and a lot more wolves. This one had a couple cheesy scenes, but no more so then the first. More action for the guys, also more skin for the girls. The CGI wolves I thought were awesome, but some people leaving the theatre disagreed apparently(they're too cool to admit to liking the movie.) I honestly still think it's best suited for fans, and those who have read the book. Boyfriends & husbands go, but this still isn't going to be one of their favorites.

1223774,A392BU15592V2V,B001OQCV56,Alfred D. Byrd,"[6, 9]","New Moon was a step down from Twilight. In part the shortcomings of the movie sequel stemmed from the shortcomings of the book sequel: it abruptly abandoned a compelling storyline of werewolves in Washington state for a storyline of vampires in Italy -- a compelling storyline in itself, but one that just didn't mesh well with the werewolf storyline. In the book Stephanie Meyers at least had space to develop both storylines; in the movie both felt rushed for lack of time.The main shortcoming of New Moon, however, was its direction. For some reason Catherine Hardwicke, who created a clear, if controversial, artistic vision in Twilight, got replaced, but the new director tried to continue her style. (In fairness to him he was stuck with her choice of actors, settings, and tone.) Ms. Hardwicke's direction got emotionally repressed characters showing flashes of violent emotion through their shells; the new director often got no more than actors saying their lines quietly. An exception to the rule was Taylor Lautner as Jacob, who was free to develop in a radically new and strong direction with his transformation into a werewolf. He and his fellow werewolves were the heart of the movie.I also take exception to New Moon's music, which went in unclear directions in contrast with Ms. Hardwicke's choice of moody folk music as a background.Still, there were flashes of inspired acting, and the scenes in the depths of Washington's gloomy, immemorial forests and in sun-drenched, decadent Volterra were beautifully filmed. Above all, the story of New Moon was told cleanly and fully, setting up the better plotted and action-packed sequels, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.",3,A Step Down from Twilight,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1676,"['New', 'Moon', 'was', 'step', 'down', 'Twilight', 'part', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'sequel', 'stemmed', 'shortcomings', 'book', 'sequel', 'abruptly', 'abandoned', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'werewolves', 'Washington', 'state', 'storyline', 'vampires', 'Italy', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'werewolf', 'storyline', 'book', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'least', 'had', 'space', 'develop', 'storylines', 'movie', 'felt', 'rushed', 'lack', 'time.The', 'main', 'shortcoming', 'New', 'Moon', 'however', 'was', 'direction', 'reason', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'who', 'created', 'clear', 'controversial', 'artistic', 'vision', 'Twilight', 'got', 'replaced', 'new', 'director', 'tried', 'continue', 'style', 'fairness', 'was', 'stuck', 'choice', 'actors', 'settings', 'tone', 'Ms.', 'Hardwicke', 'direction', 'got', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'characters', 'showing', 'flashes', 'violent', 'emotion', 'shells', 'new', 'director', 'often', 'got', 'more', 'actors', 'saying', 'lines', 'quietly', 'exception', 'rule', 'was', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Jacob', 'who', 'was', 'free', 'develop', 'radically', 'new', 'strong', 'direction', 'transformation', 'werewolf', 'fellow', 'werewolves', 'were', 'heart', 'movie.I', 'also', 'take', 'exception', 'New', 'Moon', 'music', 'went', 'unclear', 'directions', 'contrast', 'Ms.', 'Hardwicke', 'choice', 'moody', 'folk', 'music', 'background.Still', 'were', 'flashes', 'inspired', 'acting', 'scenes', 'depths', 'Washington', 'gloomy', 'immemorial', 'forests', 'sun-drenched', 'decadent', 'Volterra', 'were', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'New', 'Moon', 'was', 'told', 'cleanly', 'fully', 'setting', 'up', 'better', 'plotted', 'action-packed', 'sequels', 'Eclipse', 'Breaking', 'Dawn']",N/A

1223779,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B001OQCV56,Allen,"[1, 1]","I don't usually do these, but I think this movie needs a fair judgement as most of the comments so far have either been uneducated, or based on a personal vendetta against the saga.Starting afresh, let's look at this movie. It is based on a book targeted primarily at females between the ages of 13-40. If you do not fall into that range, did you really expect to like it anyway? That'd be like going to see ""He's Just Not That Into You"" if you hate romances, or ""Saw"" if you hate violence - and then complaining about it. The movie has a set target audience, it's what it thrives on. If it appeals to you, great. If it doesn't, fine, either leave it be like I do with movies I do not like, or leave an educated and constructive review.So the movie, well I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed Twilight, yet New Moon was better. The narrative was greatly improved, it had a deeper plot and it was great to see the director explore new realms of cinematography and camera angles. I took my friend who hugely disliked the first movie along with me, and she left having enjoyed the 2hrs and agreeing that New Moon was certainly worth the 6 cinema ticket. Chris Weitz has done fantastic work on only his 6th directing job. His style may not be unique, but for an emerging artist he has certainly left his mark.The acting was again much improved. For the large part, these actors are unknowns who have jumped in at the deep end. The one criticism I would have is that it'd be nice for the character of ""Bella"" (Kristen Stewart) to be allowed the humour and fun loving attitude that she posses in the books, to shine through into the movie. It'd also be nice to see some of the characters back stories developed more, but on a short time scale, I understand the difficulties here.On the whole, ""Twilight - New Moon"" deserves much higher respect than it is receiving. It is highly unfair that it is written off just based on peoples opinions of the saga. This is a charming and beautiful adaptation of Stephanie Meyers story and does not deserve to be slammed so unproductively. It does not give out bad messages to it's audience, if that was the case ""Romeo and Juliet"" should be re induced as at least a 15 to avoid 'such negative messages' being revealed to it's target audience.Give this movie a chance, even just out of curiosity - you never know, you may become a fan. It's harmless, entertaining fun that at least demands sensible and logical reviews.If you dislike the movies/books so much, have some self respect and don't watch it - or at least produce a worthy point.",5,Surprised me! :),1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,2570,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'fair', 'judgement', 'most', 'comments', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'uneducated', 'based', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'saga.Starting', 'afresh', 'let', 'look', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'targeted', 'primarily', 'females', 'ages', '13-40', 'do', 'not', 'fall', 'range', 'did', 'really', 'expect', 'like', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'be', 'going', 'see', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'hate', 'romances', 'Saw', 'hate', 'violence', 'then', 'complaining', 'movie', 'set', 'target', 'audience', 'what', 'appeals', 'great', ""n't"", 'fine', 'leave', 'be', 'do', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'leave', 'educated', 'constructive', 'review.So', 'movie', 'well', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'Twilight', 'yet', 'New', 'Moon', 'was', 'better', 'narrative', 'was', 'greatly', 'improved', 'had', 'deeper', 'plot', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'director', 'explore', 'new', 'realms', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'angles', 'took', 'friend', 'who', 'hugely', 'disliked', 'first', 'movie', 'left', 'having', 'enjoyed', '2hrs', 'agreeing', 'New', 'Moon', 'was', 'certainly', '6', 'cinema', 'ticket', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'done', 'fantastic', 'work', 'only', '6th', 'directing', 'job', 'style', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'unique', 'emerging', 'artist', 'certainly', 'left', 'mark.The', 'acting', 'was', 'again', 'much', 'improved', 'large', 'part', 'actors', 'are', 'unknowns', 'who', 'have', 'jumped', 'deep', 'end', 'one', 'criticism', 'would', 'have', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'character', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'be', 'allowed', 'humour', 'fun', 'loving', 'attitude', 'books', 'shine', 'movie', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'characters', 'back', 'stories', 'developed', 'more', 'short', 'time', 'scale', 'understand', 'difficulties', 'here.On', 'whole', 'Twilight', 'New', 'Moon', 'much', 'higher', 'respect', 'receiving', 'highly', 'unfair', 'written', 'off', 'just', 'based', 'peoples', 'opinions', 'saga', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'adaptation', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'story', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'slammed', 'so', 'unproductively', 'not', 'give', 'out', 'bad', 'messages', 'audience', 'was', 'case', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'should', 'be', 're', 'induced', 'least', '15', 'avoid', ""'such"", 'negative', 'messages', 'being', 'revealed', 'target', 'audience.Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'even', 'just', 'curiosity', 'never', 'know', 'may', 'become', 'fan', 'harmless', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'least', 'demands', 'sensible', 'logical', 'reviews.If', 'dislike', 'movies/books', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'self', 'respect', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'least', 'produce', 'worthy', 'point']",N/A

I did read all the books out of curiosity and I have a habit of watching every film (that is transitioned into this format) of all the books I have read. Having read the novels and based upon that comparison; the movies are not bad at all. They follow the main plot decently without causing any strife. However, as a stand alone film; this is a bad movie. First, I want to say that almost every actor in this film is bad, having seen them in other projects I know this not to be true for most of them; so I blame the director. A bad actor is bad in everything, most of the actors in this franchise are only bad in these particular movies. I want to say that the whole presentation of how the characters are produce, is what makes the acting bad. The bad make-up, wigs, and some of the line delivery makes what should be a romantic drama, into a comedy.Ms. Stewart portrayal of Bella is the worse acting job of anyone in the film. She makes her impossible to like, as well as she does not high-light the attributes that make Bella lovable to Edward and Jacob in the books. Bella cries often in the novels when Edward leaves her; she never crises on film. I could not tell the difference of any emotion she had in this film; she could have been happy, that is how little her face changed. Jacob was between a douche and a joker in the books but here he just came off as a douche. As with the first film, I saw very little of the Cullen's personalities; where was Alice's annoyance or Emmett's joy? Out of every werewolf movie I have seen, I enjoyed these wolves the best. Some of the backgrounds and the visual atmosphere was so beautiful; enough at times to ignore the bad acting and pace, pace is another issue of mine with the film.The novels are long, while Mrs. Meyer's is not a good writer, a lot of the pages where spent on trying to convey Bella's emotions and surroundings; this is not required in the medium of film, it can actually be shown. The movie is over 2 hours long but pertinent plots and conversations were left out. This was a major problem with the first film; there was not enough segue to explain the characters actions. People who have not read the novels will not be able to grasp why both Edward and Jacob love Bella. Ultimately this is a love story; those conversations in the novels are imperative to pushing the story alone. This seems to be the reason why it is either love or hate; without prior knowledge, nothing makes sense.",3,Slow Decline,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2543,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'se', 'Twilight', 'franchise', 'not', 'sense', 'follow', 'did', 'read', 'books', 'curiosity', 'have', 'habit', 'watching', 'film', 'transitioned', 'format', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'Having', 'read', 'novels', 'based', 'comparison', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'follow', 'main', 'plot', 'decently', 'causing', 'strife', 'However', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'bad', 'movie', 'First', 'want', 'say', 'almost', 'actor', 'film', 'bad', 'having', 'seen', 'other', 'projects', 'know', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'so', 'blame', 'director', 'bad', 'actor', 'bad', 'everything', 'most', 'actors', 'franchise', 'are', 'only', 'bad', 'particular', 'movies', 'want', 'say', 'whole', 'presentation', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'produce', 'what', 'acting', 'bad', 'bad', 'make-up', 'wigs', 'line', 'delivery', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'romantic', 'drama', 'comedy.Ms', 'Stewart', 'portrayal', 'Bella', 'worse', 'acting', 'job', 'anyone', 'film', 'impossible', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'high-light', 'attributes', 'make', 'Bella', 'lovable', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'books', 'Bella', 'cries', 'often', 'novels', 'when', 'Edward', 'never', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'difference', 'emotion', 'had', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'how', 'little', 'face', 'changed', 'Jacob', 'was', 'douche', 'joker', 'books', 'here', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'douche', 'first', 'film', 'saw', 'very', 'little', 'Cullen', 'personalities', 'where', 'was', 'Alice', 'annoyance', 'Emmett', 'joy', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'best', 'backgrounds', 'visual', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'times', 'ignore', 'bad', 'acting', 'pace', 'pace', 'issue', 'mine', 'film.The', 'novels', 'are', 'long', 'Mrs.', 'Meyer', 'not', 'good', 'writer', 'lot', 'pages', 'where', 'spent', 'trying', 'convey', 'Bella', 'emotions', 'surroundings', 'not', 'required', 'medium', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'shown', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'pertinent', 'plots', 'conversations', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'major', 'problem', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'segue', 'explain', 'characters', 'actions', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novels', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'grasp', 'why', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'love', 'Bella', 'Ultimately', 'love', 'story', 'conversations', 'novels', 'are', 'imperative', 'pushing', 'story', 'alone', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'love', 'hate', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'nothing', 'sense']",N/A

1223785,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,B001OQCV56,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[2, 3]","New Moon, the second installment in the Twilight Saga movie series, is by far the greatest movie sequel I've ever seen. The movie is a stunningly beautiful, exquisitely acted and excellently-produced film which is gripping, compelling, absorbing and immensely pleasurable from beginning to end.The entire cast of actors and actresses were utterly excellent. It is hard for me to believe that young men and yound ladies this young can act so well, but Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, and especially Kristen Stewart, and the rest of the cast, were simply impeccable. As a film connoisseur, I would actually describe Kristen Stewart's performance as Garbo-esque or Meryl Streep-esque. I think Stewart deserves at least an Academy Award nomination, and I say that in all seriousness. I am captivated by her performance. Not only is she stunningly beautiful in her fragile demeanor and light complexion, but her mannerisms, gestures, inflections, pauses, dialects, vocal expressions, and line delivery couldn't be more perfect and consistently pleasing in my opinion. I don't think I've ever seen a finer performance for a similar part, and no other actress in my opinion could have done it better.Pattinson's performance was also superb. I think he conveyed Edward's inner conflicts and concern and love for Bella so well. I loved it when he made his first appearance at Forks High and strolled over to Bella from his car. I love watching great actors and charismatic people like Robert. He captures Edward's sophistication, worldliness, charm and sense of humor perfectly.Taylor Lautner was great as well. More than great. He simply ""delivered"". I am so relieved the producers are keeping him for the sequels, because he really pulled it off--and more so! He went from an innocent, playful teenager to a tortured, beligerent, adrenaline-laced wolf-person and he made it totally believable and genuine. Also, his rapport with Stewart was perfect in their emotional, close scenes together. I totally believed everything Lautner did, and considering what he had to do in this movie, that's saying a lot.The supporting actors were also all great. Jasper's hairdos might have been over the top at times, but Jackson Rathbone was still great, and funny. I loved Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen. He achieved a greater depth to Dr. Cullen's character than in the first film, even though he was great in that one too. I also loved Nikki Reed as Rosalie. In her monologue explaining to Bella why she votes No contrasted to when she tossed Bella her gift that Alice picked out, I thought she showed the full range of a distinctive character. It's not easy to play the girl who's supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Reed managed to show Rosalie's vulnerability and delicate/injured psyche.This review is hard because this movie is so good, and all the actors were so great, I would have to go over each actor one at a time because they all deserve recognition. I've been in love with Christian Serratos' portrayal of Angela since the first movie. I wish I could take Serratos out to lunch dressed up like she does as Angela, because Christian as Angela is one of the cutest things on the face of the Earth.This movie was just, ultra cool. I have to give immense credit to Chris Weitz. His work is worthy of a Best Director nomination, if not possibly the award. The entire production was simply beautiful, perfectly directed, perfectly designed, perfectly executed, I can't see a single flaw in it. The costumes, the superb make-up, the cinematography, the musical score. The songs chosen were good and complemented the scenes well. The songs kind of enhanced and commented on what was happening in the scenes that they were played in, which I thought was cool. The screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg couldn't have been better. After all, the writing is the most important element, especially for adapting books that fans are obsessive about.Oh, and I do think I should mention Billy Burke and Edi Gathegi. Billy Burke is perfect as Bella's dad. His performance is so understated, yet so perfect, but it's crucial that Burke can pull it off, because Bella's father is so important to developing and supporting Bella's personality and her background. And I thought Gathegi was chilling as Laurent. The scene where he is preparing to kill Bella, his performance was exquisite. The inevitability of him devouring Bella was so visceral the way Gathegi acted it. You could feel the menace and murderous hunger and thirst and amorality of Laurent the vampire. Then when he sees Jacob and his pack as the giant wolves, his shock and terror. That scene is so important to conveying the strength of the wolves and their ability to fight vampires. Gathegi's short appearance was superb. It framed the sections of the film around it and was a turning point in the story. The short sequence when the wolves rip out his throat later was great fx, btw.And I guess I should also mention that Ashley Greene reprises her role as Alice nicely. Greene is like absolutely perfect for the role of Alice. It's such a vital part in the stories, and Ashley Greene is the only actress for the part--I see her and only her as Alice, not any other actress or any other woman in the world.The Volturi were great too. Dakota Fanning as Jane had some pretty good lines. Those red eyes bug me to death, though. Michael Sheen, Jamie Bower and Chris Heyerdahl were ultra cool as the chief Volturi. Any actors who I didn't mention is only for space constraints and keeping this review from being a novel--I didn't talk about Anna Kendrick, Michael Welch and Justin Chon, Rachelle Lefevre, Elizabeth Reaser, Kellan Lutz, et al, but face it--if I listed every great character actor in this movie, it would be the entire cast!All in all, Twilight: New Moon is a worthy second installment in the Twilight Saga series. Really, it's miraculous that a sequel could be this good, usually sequels are terrible. Chris Weitz deserves immense credit for achieving it, and as Twilight fans we owe him a debt of gratitude and honor because he did our beloved series credit.I think Stephanie Meyers has to be thrilled with the way New Moon turned out. This is a beautiful, exquisite, elegant film that will entrance you and fill you with smooth and steady ecstasy, and it builds and crests from beginning to end, as all great films do. It is not to be missed, and although it probably will never be honored as a ""Great Film"" or ""Great Art"", it is just as good quality as the greatest films ever made (it's a hundred times better quality than Titanic, for instance, which won 11 Academy Awards) and in my heart it wins about 15 Academy Award nominations, and more than a few Oscars. I will be seeing this a lot more times in the theaters, you can be sure. Simply the best!*****UPDATE*****:I've seen New Moon a second time now (only twice, but only because I'm traveling!), and it's even better the second time around. TOTALLY AWESOME! This is the way movies should be made!I will be going a few more times before I leave town for overseas, but luckily it will be open in Asia in the next few days. Can't wait for Eclipse in June. If Chris Weitz directed that and it's anywhere like this one, it will most likely be a knockout.

Everything was so much better: the lighting, the make-up (excepting Rosalie's horrible wig, though it is seen mercifully briefly), the acting, the true-to-the-book storyline, the cinematography, the MUSIC. Everything was glaringly better, and I know part of that has to do with budget, but I think a larger part had to do with the directing. I am with others who wish for a Twilight remake. I thought Taylor did a fantastic job as Jacob and I'm glad they stayed with him though I hope in future installments they use movie magic to make him appear larger as he is supposed to be huge (by that I mean taller). I thought both Rob and Kristen did a much better job and were much more likeable. I do wish they would have changed Rob's contacts to reflect his moods rather than always having them so golden, especially when he is in Italy and hasn't fed for many days.

1223801,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B001OQCV56,"Antoinette Johnson ""Pooky""","[3, 5]","I was expecting this to be way better than Twilight because I heard there was way more action. Guess what I bailed out an hour and 30 minutes in. ITs way more dull and boring than Twilight. Theres still no plot, Bella is a b****, and theres still no true conflict. She ends up getting everything she wants at the end of the series anyway including a perfect family with no troubles at 18. OMG shocking isn't it!I'm serious Bella p***es me off. I have never watched a movie with a main character so detestable. She basically goes into a canatonic state when Edward leaves her and the segment showing how deep her depression was just ridiculus. She just sits in a chair with the same d*** clothes on for months because a vampire boy she knew for only a week or so leaves town. All of a sudden she loses the will to live and purposely puts herself in danger just to see hallucinations of him. I was actually hoping she would die just so this story would end. But saddly that doesn't happen.Then theres Jacob. I actually think Bella would have been better off with Jacob because he seems to have more personallity than Edward who don't know WTF he wants. Plus I think Jacob is better looking too. Hes brown, buff, got long hair, and Edward just sparkle. I don't know what girls see in Edward. Hes just too pale and isn't that good looking. i've seen better looking guys on the big screen. Plus her relationship with Jacob seemed more normal even as friends while her relationship with Edward has no chemistry whatsoever. Other than this I didn't care about any of the characters and was completely bored.The so called action scenes in this movie...STILL BORING! I wasn't impressed at all with it. Like I've heard other people say ""How do you make a werewolf vs. Vampire fight boring""!! The werewolves also looked ridiculus. The CG was terrible. I know peaple argue that thier shapeshifters and not wolves, but why are they usually referred to as werewolves! The werewolves are also kind of strange. From what I've seen most of them are males and they walk around most of the time with thier shirts off in the woods. ~sings~ FAAAANNNNNSEEEERRVVVICCES! For the ladies. LOL. As an 18 year old woman I won't complain too much about that, but its still strange. I also noticed that they make Jacobs transition into a werewolf sound like hes coming out the closet or something. That shows how bad the dialogue is.Did this really need to be 2 hours! I have to give this movie credit though. I like that they got rid of most of that blue look and the cinemagraphy was way better. There were also moment that made me laugh so hard because of how insane they were. One being an example is there is one scene where there at a birthday party and somehow Bella being the clumsy b**** she is cuts herself with wrapping paper (I don't know how thats possible) and one of the vampires go crazy and tries to attack her. Sounds interesting right? Well Edward being the loving boyfriend he is protects her by pushing her into a glass table adding more injury. LMAO! He couldn't just push the attacking vamp away?! He could've just restrain him! But noo! He just pushes her into a case making the situation worse. LOLThe problem I have is that this is just a bad story that seems to go nowhere.  The romance mostly stems from the notion that Edward and Bella are a perfect couple, but its just boring and made uninteresting. Theres no true climax either. What angers me the most is that so much more could have been done to make this series so much better. It could be darker, compelling, and more intense if put in the right hands. The story contradicts itself so much too. I'm baffled as to how anyone can love this series so much. Oh well its target audience is house wives and 14 year old girls.

1223805,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B001OQCV56,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[2, 7]","For the record, I am a fan of neither Stephenie Meyer's books nor of their film adaptations. That being said, I am reviewing this film as a film lover and nothing more. I saw Twilight in theaters when it was first released, and it reminded me of a badly made Lifetime film. It had no substance, and I kept wondering to myself: Why was such a flaccid story getting more recognition than books written by Anne Rice or other authors who have written better works? I read a bit of Twilight and can tell you that Stephenie Meyer--though an okay writer--is a horrible storyteller. The movie was no different: it was as shallow and one-dimensional as the book.Now, New Moon comes along and presents us with a new, more efficient director. He has made a better movie than its predecesor, but still a story with no substance. I will comment only on Chris Weitz's directorial vision; it's impressive what he chooses to do with the camera and how he choreographs the action sequences. Other than that, the film immensely lacks. For most of the film, all we get is a whiny Bella, forever moaning about how much she misses Edward. It was almost pathetic and embarassing to watch. When the film ended, there were only a few images or scenes that stuck with me: the scenes with the Volturi (an ancient Vampire clan) and the chase scene in the woods where the wolves run after Victoria. Other than that, I wondered why the film was made and why this story was ever written in the first place. Another negative about this film is the absence of Bella's father through most of her struggles. She runs off more than once and, in the end, when she's run off to Italy and returns, her father is not too upset. If this film were attempting to explore any sort of realism, the father would have been furious and would have thrown a tantrum.Like everything, I recommend you see it at least once. It is not a complete waste; it has some interesting visuals for film buffs. However, for those seeking an intelligent story with well-analyzed characters; you will not get it here. This film tries to be about the characters, but it fails tremendously. I will not lie and say I was not entertained at certain points. Once again, the director knows how to hold an audience's attention. But, sadly, I feel this film will not stand the test of time, and neither will the books. I will not lie when I say that Stephenie Meyer is one mediocre storyteller who got extremely lucky.",2,Better than the first...but still pretty unnecessary!,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2445,"['record', 'am', 'fan', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'books', 'film', 'adaptations', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'reviewing', 'film', 'film', 'lover', 'nothing', 'more', 'saw', 'Twilight', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'reminded', 'badly', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'film', 'had', 'substance', 'kept', 'wondering', 'myself', 'Why', 'was', 'flaccid', 'story', 'getting', 'more', 'recognition', 'books', 'written', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'other', 'authors', 'who', 'have', 'written', 'better', 'works', 'read', 'bit', 'Twilight', 'can', 'tell', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'okay', 'writer', 'horrible', 'storyteller', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'shallow', 'one-dimensional', 'book.Now', 'New', 'Moon', 'along', 'presents', 'new', 'more', 'efficient', 'director', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'predecesor', 'still', 'story', 'substance', 'will', 'comment', 'only', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'directorial', 'vision', 'impressive', 'what', 'do', 'camera', 'how', 'action', 'sequences', 'Other', 'film', 'immensely', 'most', 'film', 'get', 'whiny', 'Bella', 'forever', 'moaning', 'how', 'much', 'Edward', 'was', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'embarassing', 'watch', 'When', 'film', 'ended', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'images', 'scenes', 'stuck', 'scenes', 'Volturi', 'ancient', 'Vampire', 'clan', 'chase', 'scene', 'woods', 'where', 'wolves', 'run', 'Victoria', 'Other', 'wondered', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'why', 'story', 'was', 'ever', 'written', 'first', 'place', 'negative', 'film', 'absence', 'Bella', 'father', 'most', 'struggles', 'more', 'once', 'end', 'when', 'run', 'off', 'Italy', 'returns', 'father', 'not', 'too', 'upset', 'film', 'were', 'attempting', 'explore', 'sort', 'realism', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'furious', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'tantrum.Like', 'everything', 'recommend', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'film', 'buffs', 'However', 'seeking', 'intelligent', 'story', 'well-analyzed', 'characters', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'film', 'be', 'characters', 'tremendously', 'will', 'not', 'lie', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'entertained', 'certain', 'points', 'Once', 'again', 'director', 'how', 'hold', 'audience', 'attention', 'sadly', 'feel', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'neither', 'will', 'books', 'will', 'not', 'lie', 'when', 'say', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'one', 'mediocre', 'storyteller', 'who', 'got', 'extremely', 'lucky']",N/A

The teen-heartthrob aspects were all-too apparent, but that was part of the ""Twilight"" cultural phenomenon, so it was fine... The movie had some cool aspects and ideas, and I was primed for a reasonably entertaining sequel.  But I wasn't quite ready for such a dull, poorly constructed follow-up, with such leaden pacing and lax direction. The series producers apparently made a full-speed-ahead decision to go all-out WB/Aaron Spelling with the franchise, willing to pad out each episode and hope that the any-excuse-to-see-the-boys-take-off-their-shirts glamour shots would be enough to their target audience happy. But, geez, even if they were going to make the movies all about the teen-hunk marketing, couldn't they at least have made the movie even modestly better than this?  It's just such a snoozer... a couple of minutes of semi-cool special effects, but very little in the way of plot, and a really flimsy script, with one odd narrative leap after another. Sure, you can tell where the story is heading, but could it really hurt that much to write just a teeny, tiny bit of good dialogue?Anyway, I wanted to like this movie... really I did... but it was very disappointing.

I don't know if I can credit him with the change in Bella's (Kristen Stewart) acting or if some other force took control of her body, but I am thankful.  She has done away with the excessive sputtering that was overly comical in the first film.  (Remember the hospital scene where Edward was going to leave her?  I think the lines went something like ""I...but...no...you...can't...no...no...why...whyr...shio...as.....whiiii..."")  Her twitches have been toned down and her eye flickering was kept to a minimum.Those that are Team Jacob will be happy for all of those shirtless scenes he has.  And Taylor Lautner deserves all the ooh's and aah's he received.  His acting chops are still nothing to be raved about, but he's trying, and he worked his butt off to get this role, so that bumps him up a notch in my book.Team Edward fans need not worry.  Even though New Moon focuses more on Bella and Jacob's relationship, Edward (Robert Pattinson) makes appearances throughout.  However, Edwards shirtless scenes did not evoke anything from the audience like Jacobs scenes did.  Edward is just a pale, thin, vampire, what do you expect.  (And I'm Team Edward!)So while the acting was so-so in many parts, it's still an entertaining film, especially for  teenagers and fans of the books.

1223832,A2LLWO2030A41A,B001OQCV56,Brittany,"[6, 7]","Spoilers are entirely possible, but hey, maybe they'll save somebody from seeing this terrible movie...As I generally enjoy books more than their respective film adaptations, it came as no surprise to me that watching this movie was, quite literally, painful.  The Twilight films in general suffer from terrible scripts and in most cases, inadequate acting.  However, I was intrigued by the original concept of Twilight.  I don't consider Stephenie Meyer a great writer by any means, but I do have to give her credit for her reimagining of vampires.  Twilight wasn't a great movie in the artistic sense, but it was very watchable and the commentary, if you want to listen to it, is hysterical.In New Moon, the story is completely ripped apart.  Edward is gone for most of the film, as are most of the other vampires, who I find to be the only remotely intriguing part of the series.  Instead, we get triple doses of Jacob, mostly half-naked.  Now, maybe I am the only seventeen year old girl who is not interested in Taylor Lautner's torso, and so I'm a little biased, but all I could think is ""Where's the plot... surely this movie will not sell itself on the concept of shirtless men?""  But it does.  That and Kristen Stewart screaming like a dying cat.  You lose the idea of the forbidden human/vampire romance because it's drenched in a couple hours of angst and random activity, and you also get the idea that Bella will never love Jacob enough to ditch Edward, so in the end his presence seems completely pointless: ""Irrevocable"" love isn't something you can really mess with, I guess.I almost feel like I'm missing something important -- like there's this hidden message that I'm not getting, which will explain precisely what the point of this film is supposed to be, what its artistic merits are, and why on earth I should spend a few hours of my time watching it.  I don't think this message will be forthcoming, but it's nice to think that someone actually wrote this with the intention of putting forth some kind of unifying concept.  I have to say, this is the first love story I have seen in which one of the main characters is physically absent for about three-quarters of the movie.  But Stephenie Meyer once said that Jacob is her favorite character, so I guess her crush on him took over...About the acting: I find it trully sad that the cast, who I find no other fault with other than their fruitless attempts to make a good movie out of abysmal source material, is forced to embarrass themselves by delivering such awful lines. I've seen a couple other Robert Pattinson movies, and I thought he did a fantastic job in those, but watching him as Edward is just painful -- except maybe when he smashes the cell phone.  I think Taylor Lautner should do comedy, because he delivers his rare comedic lines perfectly.  Billy Burke is awesome, and I've heard good things about Kristen Stewart outside of Twilight, but her performance makes me hate Bella even more than I already did.  And all the ""vampires'"" makeup is awful -- they look deformed, not painfully beautiful.",1,"Worse than the book, if that's possible",1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,3085,"['Spoilers', 'are', 'entirely', 'possible', 'hey', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'save', 'somebody', 'seeing', 'terrible', 'movie', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'books', 'more', 'respective', 'film', 'adaptations', 'came', 'surprise', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'literally', 'painful', 'Twilight', 'films', 'general', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'scripts', 'most', 'cases', 'inadequate', 'acting', 'However', 'was', 'intrigued', 'original', 'concept', 'Twilight', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'great', 'writer', 'means', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'reimagining', 'vampires', 'Twilight', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'artistic', 'sense', 'was', 'very', 'watchable', 'commentary', 'want', 'listen', 'hysterical.In', 'New', 'Moon', 'story', 'completely', 'ripped', 'apart', 'Edward', 'gone', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'other', 'vampires', 'who', 'find', 'be', 'only', 'remotely', 'intriguing', 'part', 'series', 'Instead', 'get', 'triple', 'doses', 'Jacob', 'mostly', 'half-naked', 'Now', 'maybe', 'am', 'only', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'interested', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'torso', 'so', ""'m"", 'little', 'biased', 'could', 'think', 'Where', 'plot', 'surely', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'sell', 'concept', 'shirtless', 'men', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'screaming', 'dying', 'cat', 'lose', 'idea', 'forbidden', 'human/vampire', 'romance', 'drenched', 'couple', 'hours', 'angst', 'random', 'activity', 'also', 'get', 'idea', 'Bella', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'Jacob', 'enough', 'ditch', 'Edward', 'so', 'end', 'presence', 'completely', 'pointless', 'Irrevocable', 'love', ""n't"", 'something', 'can', 'really', 'mess', 'guess.I', 'almost', 'feel', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'important', 'hidden', 'message', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'will', 'explain', 'precisely', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'artistic', 'merits', 'are', 'why', 'earth', 'should', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'time', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'message', 'will', 'be', 'forthcoming', 'nice', 'think', 'someone', 'actually', 'wrote', 'intention', 'putting', 'forth', 'kind', 'unifying', 'concept', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'love', 'story', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'physically', 'absent', 'three-quarters', 'movie', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'once', 'said', 'Jacob', 'favorite', 'character', 'guess', 'crush', 'took', 'over', 'acting', 'find', 'trully', 'cast', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'fault', 'other', 'fruitless', 'attempts', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'abysmal', 'source', 'material', 'forced', 'embarrass', 'delivering', 'such', 'awful', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'couple', 'other', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'movies', 'thought', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'watching', 'Edward', 'just', 'painful', 'maybe', 'when', 'cell', 'phone', 'think', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'should', 'do', 'comedy', 'rare', 'comedic', 'lines', 'perfectly', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'awesome', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Twilight', 'performance', 'hate', 'Bella', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'did', 'vampires', 'makeup', 'awful', 'look', 'deformed', 'not', 'painfully', 'beautiful']",N/A

1223839,AB34G6VKP28L,B001OQCV56,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","One of the most anticipated films of the year, New Moon is a stronger film than its predecessor and one that will delight its fans.Haunted by dreams highlighting the eventual aging that will separate her from her immortal boyfriend, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is eager to make the transition from human to vampire, but Edward (Robert Pattinson) does not want to damn her soul for all eternity -- the consequences of becoming a vampire. He wishes her to remain human, something that becomes dangerous when on her eighteenth birthday Bella sheds a drop of blood that causes Jasper, the newest ""vegetarian"" member of the Cullen clan, to lose control. This event compels Edward to decide it is too dangerous for her to be around him and that he must leave Forks. Breaking up with her and promising she will never see him again, Edward does not realize his actions will send her spiraling into a deep depression. Months later, Bella makes an irrational and stupid decision that causes Edward to reappear in her subconscious mind, warning her against danger. The ""rush"" causes her to make attempts to reconnect with memories of him through reckless behavior.Recruiting her Indian friend Jacob Black (Raylor Lautner) in helping her refurbish two mountain bikes, the time they spend together soon makes his own sudden and inexplicable distance unbearable and eventually reveals a dark secret that might separate her from Edward forever...The movie follows the book very well, so the same things I did not care for in the novel also make it onto the big screen. My biggest complaint is Bella's emotional state and how she falls apart without a boyfriend. I find that unforgivable and in direct contrast with strong heroines who pull themselves together and attempt to move on rather than plotting ways in which to endanger their life just enough to see ghosts from the past. That kind of love is dangerous and obsessive rather than emotionally fulfilling and true. Most of Bella's actions can be called into question due to their selfishness, including using Jacob -- she takes advantage of his friendship knowing what he feels for her and while she does keep him at a sort of distance, one cannot help feeling sorry for him in the end when she cruelly reminds him that it ""has always been about Edward."" Poor Jacob never had a chance, although in some respects the audience might find him a better match for her.However, the film is fun to watch and memorable for its improved dialogue. There are still many corny moments and certain comments prompted titters from the audience, but it is a stronger installment than the first and has good pacing... and finally, a studio has come up with a decent werewolf that is neither a puppet nor a badly-done CGI ""were-rat"" (Harry Potter, I am looking at you!). These giant, fierce wolves are magnificent. In fact, the only thing I did not like about the filmmaking style was that often action scenes left me wanting to see more since the shots were so quick it didn't allow me to really appreciate all that was happening on-screen. The costumes, production design, close-ups of the characters, the distinction between human-drinking and ""vegetarian"" vampires through the different colors of their eyes and notable guest appearances were great. Veteran actor Michael Sheen hams it up as the darkly comical leader of an Italian clan of vampires known as the Volturi that brought to mind some of the better moments of Interview with the Vampire, but with a modern twist. He is joined by a cast of familiar, sneering faces that also includes a sinister Dakota Fanning.A charming sense of humor and an improvement in acting assists this film in being a decent sequel and a certain success at the box office.

What these movies do is bring alive the characters we have come to love in the books.I have read several comments on the poor acting of Kristen Stewart--on the contrary, having read the books, Kristen captures Bella to a ""T.""  Bella is stoic, the adult in the relationship with her mother, shy, not wanting attention.  Stewart plays Bella understated because the character of Bella is understated, awkward and uncomfortable in her own skin.I enjoyed this movie very much, more so than Twilight.  I do think they over did the Vampire makeup on Edward this round--in some scenes he looks like Joker in the Batman movies--not that he looks bad, I doubt that is possible!If you are a fan of the books, do not miss this movie.  If you haven't read the books yet, try them out.  They are a lot of fun.

1223843,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001OQCV56,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","I spent much of my review for ""Twilight"" pointing out how the story was a Mormon abstinence parable masked as a teen vampire romance. ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is essentially the same thing, but this time around, I was more bothered by its unbearable pacing, its emotionless performances, and its confusing subplots, none of which will make much sense unless you're intimately familiar with both the first film and all of Stephenie Meyer's books. Already then, a sizeable audience has been alienated, and if there's one thing I generally can't stand, it's a film that puts the fans' needs ahead of everyone else's entertainment. Someone like me should be able to walk into this movie cold and still be able to get something out of it. If not, the only achievement has been sealing the story within a closed universe.The story, which begins a year after the events of ""Twilight,"" finds Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire boyfriend, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), abruptly ending their relationship, Edward believing that he and the rest of his clan are a threat to Bella's existence. The clan leaves Fork, Washington. Bella is heartbroken. After a few months of depressive moping, she discovers a strange thing about herself: She can see wispy visions of Edward when her adrenaline levels rise. This prompts her to do reckless things, such as riding motorcycles and jumping off cliffs into turbulent waters. When faced with scenes like this, you can't help but wonder about her father, Charlie (Billy Burke), who's readily available to snap her out of nightmares yet conveniently absent and unaware of her thrill-seeking behavior. Isn't he supposed to be the Chief of Police?In Edward's absence, Bella befriends - and possibly develops feelings for - Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a young Native American who quickly exhibits very odd behavior. To say more would give too much away, although if you're a devoted fan who just happens to be reading this, you already know what I'm getting at. What I can say is that Jacob is very much into Bella, and he doesn't like the fact that she's not as much into him as she is into Edward, despite the fact that he left her behind. I can also say that Jacob and a group of mysterious boys roam through the forest without shirts, which should send shivers of delight through its predominantly young female audience. Oh, they're attractive alright, but isn't it funny how an extended metaphor for chastity can still work so hard at being ... not erotic, but maddeningly desirable?I will now skip a number of tedious details and get to Bella and her vampire friend, Alice (Ashley Greene), arriving in Italy in time to rescue Edward, minus the logistics of timing, the location of both airports, the purchasing of tickets, and who had the money to make that purchase. The best we get is a single shot of a Virgin Atlantic jet soaring above the clouds. Why does Edward need rescuing? Let it suffice to say it involves an ancient vampire coven led by the usually dependable Michael Sheen; in this movie, he speaks in such annoyingly breathless tones that he always seems to be on the verge of fainting. We also have a brief encounter with Dakota Fanning, who I feel is far too established to be reduced to a few throwaway lines of dialogue. And those burning red eyes don't help matters much.Part of the problem is that the chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson is hindered by their complete lack of emotional range. At the start, we have scene after scene of them staring at each other longingly, almost painfully, and yet they deliver their lines in excruciating monotone whispers, and their expressions never seem to change. How can we believe Bella and Edward's psychological torment when their faces exhibit permafrost neutrality? Honestly, looking at these two is like looking at talking statues. Adding insult to injury is the fact that far too much time is spent on moments like that; the pacing of this film is so unbearably slow that, by the time something exciting does happen, we may find ourselves too sapped of energy to even care. As for Lautner, he at least is allowed to show anger, but even then, it's an uncharismatic one-note performance.All issues of pandering to the fans aside, the real problem is the tepidness of the story, having plenty in the way of visual style but little in the way of substance - save for its veiled message of keeping yourself pure and virtuous, which becomes more and more prominent until at last the film's final line practically beats it into our heads. As a general rule, I don't turn to vampire romances if I want to be preached at. ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" will undoubtedly please fans of the first film and the book series, although I suspect it has less to do with its content and more to do with the seductive nature of the characters, who on the big screen have the added advantage of being physically attractive. The girls are so likely to swoon that smelling salts should be a viewing requirement.",3,"No Sex ...

New Moon, the second in the series written by Stephanie Meyer and adapted to screenplay by Melissa Rosenburg, stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Michael Sheen, Dakota Fanning and a plethora of other up-and-coming stars.When a birthday party for Bella (played by Stewart) goes horribly wrong, Edward (played by Pattinson), begins to believe that there is no place for Bella in his vampire world. Edward and the rest of the Cullen family then disappear from Forks, Washington and from Bella's life. Months pass as Bella sinks into a deep depression and longs for her lost love. Through a chance meeting with some local 'bad boys', Bella receives a rush of adrenaline from the dangerous situation, but also a surprise; a spectral image of Edward. Believing that placing herself in danger is her only means of seeing the man she loves, Bella sets out to live life on the edge.Jacob Black (played by Lautner) and Bella become best friends as he helps her to forget the pain of her loss, but when Jacob begins to exhibit some unusual traits, Bella pushes to find out the truth about her friend and discovers that maybe ALL monsters are real.Edward, believing Bella dead, goes to The Volturi, rulers of the vampire world and asks to be exterminated but is refused. He then sets out to expose himself in an effort to force the Volturi to end his existence without his beloved Bella. Alice (played by Ashley Greene) and Bella embark on a race against time to save not only Edward, but the entire Cullen family. As Edward, Bella, and Alice are forced to face the Volturi, Aro (played by Sheen) gets a glimpse into Bella's uniqueness and a different turn of events are set into motion.I must confess to being a big fan of the Stephanie Meyer series and I watched this movie as unbiasedly as possible. The wolf transformations in New Moon are, for lack of a better word, FANTASTIC! The fight scenes that pit vampire-on-vampire are literally mesmerizing and I even held back a tear at more than one point in the movie. Though the movie soundtrack felt lackluster and dull, the introduction of the new characters made up for the musical short comings. If you are a fan of the series you will love New Moon, as it is in good keeping with the book. But if you have never read the series, I recommend that you wait and enjoy the film adaptations first and then read the books. I am giving The Twilight Saga: New Moon a 4-star rating based on the incredible special effects, the nail biting fight scenes, the intensity of the character emotion and definitely on the promise of things to come.WebbWeaver Reviews",4,The promise of good things to come!,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,2749,"['Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon', 'Summit', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'November', '20', '2009', 'was', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'New', 'Moon', 'second', 'series', 'written', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'Melissa', 'Rosenburg', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'plethora', 'other', 'up-and-coming', 'stars.When', 'birthday', 'party', 'Bella', 'played', 'Stewart', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Edward', 'played', 'Pattinson', 'believe', 'place', 'Bella', 'vampire', 'world', 'Edward', 'rest', 'Cullen', 'family', 'then', 'disappear', 'Forks', 'Washington', 'Bella', 'life', 'Months', 'pass', 'Bella', 'deep', 'depression', 'longs', 'lost', 'love', 'chance', 'meeting', 'local', ""'bad"", 'boys', 'Bella', 'rush', 'adrenaline', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'also', 'surprise', 'spectral', 'image', 'Edward', 'Believing', 'placing', 'danger', 'only', 'means', 'seeing', 'man', 'Bella', 'out', 'live', 'life', 'edge.Jacob', 'Black', 'played', 'Lautner', 'Bella', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'forget', 'pain', 'loss', 'when', 'Jacob', 'exhibit', 'unusual', 'traits', 'Bella', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'friend', 'discovers', 'maybe', 'monsters', 'are', 'real.Edward', 'believing', 'Bella', 'dead', 'Volturi', 'rulers', 'vampire', 'world', 'be', 'exterminated', 'refused', 'then', 'out', 'expose', 'effort', 'force', 'Volturi', 'end', 'existence', 'beloved', 'Bella', 'Alice', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Bella', 'embark', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'not', 'only', 'Edward', 'entire', 'Cullen', 'family', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'Alice', 'are', 'forced', 'face', 'Volturi', 'Aro', 'played', 'Sheen', 'glimpse', 'Bella', 'uniqueness', 'different', 'turn', 'events', 'are', 'set', 'motion.I', 'must', 'confess', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'series', 'watched', 'movie', 'as', 'unbiasedly', 'possible', 'wolf', 'transformations', 'New', 'Moon', 'are', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'FANTASTIC', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pit', 'vampire-on-vampire', 'are', 'literally', 'mesmerizing', 'even', 'held', 'back', 'tear', 'more', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'felt', 'lackluster', 'dull', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'made', 'up', 'musical', 'short', 'comings', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'will', 'love', 'New', 'Moon', 'good', 'keeping', 'book', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'series', 'recommend', 'wait', 'enjoy', 'film', 'adaptations', 'first', 'then', 'read', 'books', 'am', 'giving', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon', '4-star', 'rating', 'based', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'nail', 'biting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'intensity', 'character', 'emotion', 'definitely', 'promise', 'things', 'come.WebbWeaver', 'Reviews']",N/A

At least that's what worked for me.In 2008 I hadn't even so much as seen a trailer for Twilight and had heard exactly nothing about it; until my kid-sister Kelly (who's sick in the head over this whole debacle just like any other 16-year-old girl), dragged me to it. Her pitch was, ""You'll love it! The books are all great and it's a vampire movie!"" She had me. I was in. Then I gave Twilight a measly two stars. `Vampire movie?' - I thought to myself; `I don't think so.'Going into New Moon, I knew exactly what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. This time, I placed myself in the mind of a 16-year-old and realized that this movie was a lot like high school; the drama mind you, not the vampires and werewolves - but the boy/girl drama that all of us can relate to. That's why the franchise is so popular.As I looked around the theater, I realized that these movies were going to involve a lot of high school memories for these kids. For me, it was the American Pie series and lo and behold; the guy who co-directed American Pie (Chris Weitz), directed New Moon as well. He really captured the essence of high school from the hardest R element with American Pie all the way down to an almost PG perspective with New Moon.The movie looks and feels like a day-time soap opera for kids. But unlike a lot of the Hollywood garbage aimed at this age group, this franchise has managed to be astronomically successful without being sleazy and disgusting and my hat is off to all of the filmmakers involved.Kids are actually going absolutely nuts over these movies and there is no profanity, no drug and alcohol content, and strangely enough, there's no sex! This is a huge success for our society folks!Now looking at the film as an adult, it has several problems. But who cares, it's not for adults! There's always True Blood and the Underworld franchise for us.We start pretty much where we left off from the last installment. Kristen Stewart returns as Bella, the love-sick puppy of the mysterious Vampire Edward, played again by Robert Pattinson. Both of these kids are great actors and bring a lot of life to these characters. Their performances will live on in the hearts of today's teens, well into their adulthood. They're on-screen romance will be that of a Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for this new generation.After a close scare at Bella's birthday party, when a harmless paper cut turns into a blood bath (yes I realize how lame that sounds), Edward decides that he must leave Bella behind and forget all about her; for her own good, of course. Bella is heartbroken but Edward and his family of blood-suckers move from the town of Forks nonetheless.This opens the door to a new relationship between Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Bella. While I really like this kid, I don't think he's near the actor that Stewart and Pattinson are. However, he's only seventeen and has no-where near the experience they do; so maybe with time he'll surprise us all. I prefer him for Bella rather than Edward, just as a side note.  I really like the way he talks and Edward is always grungy looking and creepy.Bella uses him as a crutch to get over Edward and everything is fine until she realizes that Jacob is a werewolf. This girl has some luck. She first falls for a vampire and now a werewolf. In the event she survives long enough to attend college, she'll inevitably date a zombie.Soon, things heat up a little and a few of the characters from the first film pop in to stalk Bella and score some screen time. With Edward no-where to be found, Bella is a sitting duck. Jacob must come to her aid. He starts to show interest in her as well and grows jealous of her still somewhat strong feelings for Edward.Somewhere in the third act, something significant happens to Edward and Bella leaves Forks in hopes of helping him. She travels with Edward's sister Alice to Italy, which seems like it's only in the film to put the characters in some fresher scenery, but it was probably in the book as well, so what do I know?Here in Italy, we meet up with some very nasty vampires who almost seem too nasty for this movie. One of them is played by Dakota Fanning and another by Michael Sheen. I don't need to tell you that the performances of these two legendary actors were amazing, but I just did. Anyhow, one thing leads to another and the movie is over.The final scene was amazing. The line Bella delivers to Jacob kicked my teeth into the back of my skull. The film is very well shot and filled with artsy tidbits and super-awesome cinematography. The filmmakers picked excellent outdoor locations that make you want to visit Forks despite that fact that from what I've heard, it isn't filmed there.Some of the issues that hurt the film are the cheesy special effects that we have become all too familiar with. The werewolves had a neat look, I'll give them that, and I understand that they are supposed to be super fast, but come on. They looked way too cartoony bouncing all over on the screen.And while on the subject of bad CGI (computer graphic imagery), why did they need the dramatic shot of Bella leaping from a cliff into a CGI ocean? Couldn't they have pulled back and used a stunt double? If that wasn't an option, surly they could have fastened some sort of a net or other safety device off camera, to the other side of the cliff for her to jump into and then shot the other half of the jump from the bottom where she lands. The entire background looked absurdly phony as she leaped from that cliff.There is no excuse for that in movies. If they were worried about her getting injured (which is understandable) they could have used some sort of harness and then erased that out digitally. If for whatever reason all of these ideas were brought up and not useable, then just find another location and come up with a different cool visual idea guys. Come on, you're Hollywood for God's sakes! I'm all for special effects when they make sense, but laziness seams to be CGI's best advocate these days.Furthermore, the overall flow of the movie is daringly slow and dull. It's a drama from start to finish no doubt, but with vampires and werewolves involved, there just has to be more action! There has to be more something. I get that it's a romance but it needs more substance.Also, if you haven't seen the first film or read the books, you are completely on your own. Characters just step in and out of the story at random, with the only excuse being that they needed to at least make an appearance. There is this underlying tone in the film where dramatic things or mildly humorous events will happen and the audience reacts to them; but not the way an audience would generally react to them in any other film. You get the feeling that they are reacting that way because they are comparing it to something from the book. I have not read any of the books (yet) and was bombarded by this repeatedly. I felt like the new guy at a late night secret cult meeting.Another major detail of the film that will annoy many is actually one of its strongest assets. It's kind of difficult to explain but I guess ridiculous is the best word to use when describing the dialogue. Much like the jargon used in Juno, if you will.Teenagers don't talk like this; at least the ones I have been around recently and back when I was one myself. Just look at the scene between Bella and her friend when they are walking down the street after seeing the zombie flick and ask yourself if you are a parent, `Does my teen act like that?' Or if you are a teen or were a teen, `Is that or was that how I act or acted around my friends?' No, it's not. Just like in Juno, it is enjoyable and fun but that's not how teenagers talk and behave. Of course there are exceptions, but all of the characters in this film act in a very weird way that is both far more mature and unrealistic for their age.Bella has so many mental-crisis issues in this film its mind boggling.  At one point she is even upset about turning 18 because now she is getting older and soon Edward won't be interested in her anymore. Give me a break; 18?After Edward leaves her, she begins to have these horrible nightmares that are so drastic it looks like she's going through heroin withdrawals. I found this hilarious and am surprised I wasn't stomped to death by angry teenage girls.But the strange behavior of all these teenagers is very humorous and entertaining. For me the biggest laugh was when Jacob randomly called the wimpy kid a marshmallow.Lastly, another thing that will irritate and entertain people in different ways, is how ridiculous the whole premise of the story is. Edward is well over a hundred years old, so why would he continue to go to school? Would you go to high school over and over again? And it's pretty ironic that the small town of Forks has vampires and werewolves and that no-one really seems to notice or care.Again though, if you just go with it and accept that it's the norm in this world that is The Twilight Saga; then it's a good movie. I promise.

Then I saw it again and LOVED it even more!!!While I enjoyed Twilight and thought there were some very beautifully directed scenes in that movie, it lacked depth somehow and didn't allow you to feel for the characters as much as New Moon does. Really, New Moon follows the book very closely with so many of the lines right out of the book; and as a true twi fan you have to appreciate that. Chris Weitz, it seems, took a chance by making a movie fans could really love and appreciate. He knew full well the legions upon legions of dedicated fans of these books, so doing anything else (I believe) wouldn't have made any of us happy. I love these books and I'm all about the fantasy aspect of them, and I think this movie really delivers on that.Yes, Jacob/Taylor looks amazing, and he did a great job becoming Jacob. What I'm most impressed by is the obvious step up to the plate performance by Kristen Stewart. Despite my reservations about her acting abilities, I have to say she really pulled it off this time with a thoroughly believable portrayal of all the emotions she seemed to be feeling in the book. As for Robert Pattinson, I think the Twilight Saga is only the beginning of a very long and successful acting career for him. He does an amazing job expressing the emotions and passion of the character with his facial expressions and perfectly delivered dialogue, making this fantasy movie really believable.Of course Edward is gone a lot, but we all knew that going into the theater. That is what makes their reunion so much sweeter, and it IS SWEEEEET!!!!LOVED LOVED LOVED the Fight scene!!! LOVED IT!!!!! I'd love to go into more detail, but don't want to spoil anything for anyone.There is so much about this movie that I love, but I have to say one of the biggest stand-out scenes for me was where Charlie and Harry are hunting the werewolves, which is inter spliced with great scenes of Victoria and her Vividly bright red hair flying all over the place and Bella walking up to the cliff to take the plunge. All the while, this perfectly fitting music plays in the background. A great great piece of this movie.Loved Rosalie's look. Much much better (IMHO) than she looked in Twilight. She looked pretty in New Moon, and she is a beautiful woman. It was nice to see them make her look that way. Still hated Jasper's hair though. Minor stuff.What about Esme???? She looked great as well did Alice and Carlisle and Emmett. Esme just stands out more because she looks so much better in this movie than in Twilight.Loved the way Edward looked more like a vampire. Beneath that sweet beautiful face, you could see the potential for his dangerous bad boy side to emerge. And, who doesn't love the bad boy, but in this case, you get it all.

Reed,"[4, 5]","This movie makes them seem like over-simplified, soap-operaish wimps (no offense to Barnabas fans from ""Dark Shadows"" as I've never seen his episodes, I have no intention of making fun of him and I'm sure he's a well-developed character)! My God is the were-wolf boy the only developed three dimensional character in this! This level of stupidity that surrounds these movies astounds me! How can anyone like this? None of the characters are developed or likeable (if that's misspelled I'm sorry, this movie causes so much anger that simple things like spelling leave me), the story (or lack there of) is a joke and the special effects make the ones used in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers look like something out of Lucasfilm! The two main leads can't act to save their lives! I practically had to crank the volume up whenever Pattinson spoke as he seems to only deliver his dialog in whispers (but thankfully that hack was hardly in the movie anyway). Kristen Stewart's character is nothing but a complete idiot! Her character is just a bore and her ""conflict"" is practically non-existant. Their romance is a joke, making the Joker and Harley Quinn seem normal in comparison (though that romance is another, but completely better, story). She wants to be with the vampire no matter what, even though the muscular were-wolf boy says he'd be there and defend her no matter, even though, just by being in his presence, she gets hurt more than Wile E. Coyote. No really I'm not joking; Pattinson pushes her out of the way after she gets a paper cut, trying to ""save"" her, but actually makes it worse by causing her to pretty much cut her arm right down the side! The rest of the cast is pretty much bland or non-existant as we spend the whole movie following that slut around. Taylor Lautner (I guess that's how you spell his name) seems to be the only one in my opinion who actually makes his character sympathetic. It's a shame he wastes his emotion on Stewart when he should really be ripping her head off! And of course there's our ""Gratuitous Celebrity Cameo for the Evening""; Miss Dakota Fanning, who I hope was well paid for her two lines of dialog and five minutes of screen time. The director I must also lambast. He did such a good job with The Golden Compass and I so wanted him to do a sequel. But not this piece of garbage! Did he even bother to look at the script? Did he really think it was a good idea to do not 1, not 2 but 3 360 degree shots of Stewart! All the while a crappy song is playing in the background! That was the biggest waste of film I've ever seen (not counting the entirety of this, the first and the next two films)! From Russia with Love, The Empire Strikes Back, Superman II, Batman Returns & The Dark Knight; some of the greatest sequels of all time and prove that sequels can be superior to the original.

It was filmed well on a non action expressive level.  With the help of many close up shots, lighting and angles not just of Bella and Edward but of locals in Forks, kids trudging through the rain for school, Bella writing a note, scenes of Forks main street from Charlie's cruiser, Edward writing at school, the diner (although I got tired of the constant veggie burger reference) etc.In Twilight there was also a genuine newness of all the characters getting to know each other.  The kids at Forks High getting to know Bella, Bella getting to know them, Bella getting to know the Cullen's, Bella getting to know Jacob all over again, etc.  It was fresh and warmly independently filmed like you were right there in Washington State.  Of course close ups of Bella and Edward were a must to see both vulnerability and beauty of the characters.  I think the director understood for film goers to understand the attraction between the leads they had to be attracted.None of this was done in New Moon.  There are very few close up shots, angles and good lighting which is needed for the continued adoration of Edward and Bella.  There's no intimacy feeling in the film but mostly distance. And I think the actors portrayed there parts a bit distant and unemotional as well.In New Moon prior to Edward and Bella's break up seems Robert Pattinson acting looked detached.  The breakup in the woods between Bella and Edward didn't seem authentic and very unemotional as well.Kristen Stewart has no emotional range what so ever and her portrayal was at times confusing.  When Bella goes after Edward in the woods she looks down calling his name as if he's on the ground.In a few scenes Bella stares at Jacobs's chest when she's talking to him.  Is she supposed to look like she wants to jump poor Jacob's bones any minute or is it a case of bad acting and direction?Seems the new director and screenwriter may have caused the actors in New Moon to have delivery and projection issues.

1223874,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001OQCV56,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[41, 57]","In the second installment of theThe Twilight Saga Collection, ""New Moon,"" director Chris Weitz religiously sticks to author Stephanie Meyer's plotline to deliver a film of which fans--preteens, teens and Twi-Moms alike--will definitely approve.  Others not of the Twilight persuasion may have a bit of trouble relating to the Bella/Edward/Jacob triangle as this film assumes you are already well versed with and feeling the magic from the books rather than pulling out all the stops to conjure up a little more multi-faceted chemistry between the three lead characters.Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg also assume that their audience is well aware of the various physical and mental talents of the Cullen vampire clan as no introductory synopsis of the goings-on of the first film is offered as a starting point for the plotline driving the second.  Quite obviously, this is a film created for and by the fans as testified by the satisfied squeals of approval, barks of laughter and spontaneous applause emitted by the mainly teen audience each and every time they felt the film successfully reproduced the action in their beloved books to perfection.As a standalone film, `New Moon' portrays a lot of teen angst. When Edward Cullen, vampire pretty boy extraordinaire, (Rob Pattinson's quiet smoldering mannerisms attempt to emulate a Rebel Without a Cause with a twist--he has lived long enough to understand the sad loneliness of an eternal life) decides that his continued presence in the life of his soul mate, high school senior Bella Swan, can only insure her premature demise, he and his family leave the Washington state scene of their established home. Left behind Bella is bereft, barely able to function, until amazingly buff Jacob of the Quileute Indian Reservation thankfully fills the theater with his blazingly white smile and more than adequate ability to manage whatever comes his way with a competent efficiency.  Sadly, as much as she enjoys Jacob's company, Bella doesn't find him distracting enough--even without his shirt.  Instead she orchestrates ways to filter Pattinson's archangel face back on the screen where thousands of teenage girls feel it belongs; the more reckless her behavior the more consistent his reappearance as some sort of swirling protective figment of her intuition.In her novel, Meyer more than flirts with the theme of choosing death rather than living without the constant presence of your star-designated soul mate.  At eighteen, just like Shakespeare's Juliet, Bella wants to know only Edward despite the fact that she comes from a broken home.  Sweet to believe that in our world of helter-skelter emotions, short-termed relationships and finance breaking divorce that something so pure and iconic can exist for a lifetime let alone eternity.  Those who have read the novels understand Bella's predicament and her idealistic uncontrolled drive towards an unknown from which she should run.  From the books, we know that Edward realizes this as does Jacob who like an actual flesh and blood man desires nobility but selfishly wants for himself and his chosen woman the warmth and safety of his hearth and home.Of the three film characters, the only one who is able to convey his motivation is Jacob.  Look past the desire for the filmmakers to show off an attractive body with mega shirtless reveals and capitalize on his ability to infiltrate the dreams of a multitude of women as the ultimate American Indian Dreamcatcher.  Despite some corny dialogue--not the fault of screenwriter Rosenberg as the clumsiest lines are straight out of the book--that did elicit some laughter from the audience, somehow Taylor Lautner manages to make a solid case for what he can offer Bella and her future.  Yes, supernatural elements abound for this character also, but the promise of a good life with warmth and love is evident to the extreme.Not so with Pattinson's Edward, although most of `New Moon's' story focuses on the Jacob/Bella leg of the triangle and the vampire hero gets less screen time.  Perhaps, it is the desire for the filmmakers and Meyer herself to depict the chalky-faced, amber-eyed and tossed-salad haired mega-hunk Edward as an old-fashioned guy who for the most part controls his emotions with a stilted turn-of-the-century sensibility.  I can rationalize Edward's actions and desires with regard to his Bella, but somehow, despite Pattinson's obvious beauty, I fail to feel any of the heat that I would associate with a modern day Romeo especially since Meyer's definition of vampire includes a rocklike coldness that unfortunately forces me to think of frigidity.  (Check out Franco Zeffirelli'sRomeo & Juliet--the exuberance of young love unchecked is extremely evident in the performances of the then young stars.)  In addition, I sorely missed the presence of a key melody; there were none of the haunting strains of ""Bella's Lullaby"" by Carter Burwell that enhanced and reminded the audience of the moodiness of the lovers' dilemma yet reinforced their commitment no matter what.Admittedly, if I were to choose sides, I would most definitely lean towards Team Jacob.  Not only do I prefer the heat to the cold, I find Edward's pained expression and inability to seemingly relax--whether from his forced composure around Bella's blood-filled veins or his slightly stilted century old sensibilities regarding love and romance--a little off-putting.  Part of the problem arises from the novelist's intentional misconception regarding what girls or women in general expect their men to say and how they desire them to act.  Unfortunately, most men do not follow such a script and sadly the young adults reading such sentimental lines by these most quintessential young men will inevitably be disappointed by reality.  Nonetheless, I, too, love a fairytale, one in which the damsel in distress is loved and protected without limits or self-aggrandizing reluctance by her knights in shining armor.  For me, the warmth of fur far outweighs the iciness of stone, especially in the rainy northwest.As for our heroine, Bella presents a mixed bag for me.  In the first film and as warranted by the book's narrative, Bella has a reluctance like many teenagers to get involved in anything that will end in disappointment. She is a bit hardened by her parents' divorce, anesthetized by her disinterest in girly-girl activities and displeased by her innate clumsiness.  In `New Moon,' Edward's love does not seem to have had much of an effect on her other than to further her insecurities and avoidance towards emotional disaster and push her into a fast decision regarding lifestyle choices that will reverberate for an eternity.  Bella's subdued maturity--she acts as cook and housekeeper for her sheriff father--her smug desire to kiss Edward until he shudders with unrequited passion and insistence to join the Cullen clan suggest little growth.  She is like driftwood moved by the Cullen and Quileute tides. Accordingly, in compliance with the abbreviated amount of time spanning all four of the novels and the two supernatural storms that assault Bella's natural defensiveness, Bella remains the same.  Kristin Stewart's image conjures up an instant association with the Bella character. However, in `New Moon,' she appears overly manicured and stylized with her too perfect eyebrows, head-banded hair and lip glossed pout. Meyer's Bella self-deprecates with a much more relaxed sense of grooming despite the efforts of the well-meaning Alice. Without the first person narration, Stewart plays the depressed Bella with a mute melancholy that gets old fast.  Indeed, it is amazing that the two attractive leads are interested in her at all.Techinically speaking, the film boasts some great special effects. The Quileute wolf pack is rendered with great fun as computer-generated-images of massive bulk, expressive liquid eyes and frothy flawless pelts.  The `phasing' sequences realistically convey the anger and angst of yet another brand of the adolescent coming-of-age made popular by theSmallville - The Complete First Seasontelevision series.  Action scenes abound, as the audience gets spectacular bird's eye views to the supernatural occurrences that overshadow the normal life happenings in the woodland surrounding the town of Forks, Washington.  As with all such stories, the plot is driven by threat: threat of vagabond vampires with glowing red blood-filled eyes trespassing on Cullen and Quileute territory and that of the Volturi vampire rulers who ascertain that the secret existence of their kind remains contained within a closed set.Bottom line?  Director Weitz successfully brings the second installment of the young adult Twilight saga to the big screen.  However, his true-to-the-letter adaptation, at times, fails in the same way that the novel does--not in creating a modern look atRomeo and Julietand then crossing it with the competitive love triangle found in Bronte'sWuthering Heights (Barnes & Noble Classics)--but in not really succeeding in creating a tangible feel for the chemistry between the characters.  The overt cuteness of Meyer/Rosenberg's dialogue may work in offering a lighthearted young adult presentation of a melancholy theme that depicts an unsure girl unprepared for the big questions brought on by supernatural circumstances, but it falls short in its portrayal of the depth of the connections between the three main characters except in regard to Jacob's hot, out-of-control feeling for Bella.

1223885,ABC4LIDMGUYM9,B001OQCV56,Dorothy,"[1, 2]","""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is the second installment in the Twilight franchise. It stars Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen. Bella is your average teenager who moved to Forks to live with her dad, Chief of Police, Charlie Swan(Billy Burke) after her mom and step-dad went to Jacksonville, Florida. She loathed Forks, until she met Edward Cullen. The beautiful and perfect Edward Cullen. Not knowing why he is always absent on sunny days or why his eyes change color or why he is as cold as ice she falls deeply in love with him. After looking into his cold hands and strength, she learns that he is a Vampire. Knowing that he is a bloodsucking monster she still wants to be with him and only him. So, throughout all of ""Twilight"" they are together in love and of course have to deal with several speed bumps along the way. So, this chapter of the saga, ""New Moon"", Bella turns 18, technically 1 year older than Edward. She is afraid that she will keep getting older and Edward will always look like a 17 year old boy. Unless, she is turned into a Vampire. On her 18th birthday the Cullens hold a little birthday gathering at their house for Bella and give her gifts. Esme (Elizabeth Reaser) and Carlisle's (Peter Facinelli) gift winds up giving her a papercut. Ordinarily that would be nothing. But, to a house full of Vampires that could mean everything. One speck of blood, and Jasper(Jackson Rathbone) goes into attack mode. Edward pushes Bella back but she crashes into a glass table and her entire arm is now soaked in blood. Carlisle and Emmett(Kellan Lutz) try to hold Jasper back and Alice(Ashley Greene) finally calm him down but they all have to leave the room because the smell of blood could mean death for Bella. Carlisle is a doctor and is used to blood, most of the Cullens are, except really Jasper, he is a ""newbie."" Carlisle takes Bella and stitches up her arm. Edward is distraught over the pain Bella has to endure over things such as a minor papercut. After that fiasco, Edward decides that he is going to break up with Bella in order to protect her from getting hurt all the time.After Bella and Edward break up, Bella is a mess. She's depressed and constantly having horrible nightmares. It takes her months to finally break out and talk to people. She realizes that anything careless or reckless that she does she sees Edward. So, she decides to try motorcyles. She takes 2 beat up bikes from a junkyard and asks Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) to fix them up for her. Bella and Jacob become fast friends and things start to heat up.I honestly, didn't like the book ""New Moon"". I loved ""Twilight"", but I really didn't enjoy ""New Moon."" I think because in the books, I love Edward and Bella's love and of course Edward Cullen himself. In the book, Edward isn't in it for most of it. I became somewhat bored with the storyline of Bella and Jacob, I think because I not only love Edward but Jacob gets on my nerves. But, the film is completely different for me. I actually enjoy watching Bella go through tough times, and finally come to terms with the fact that Edward may not come back. I like seeing Jacob and Bella together and I think because Jacob is goofy and they joke around a lot that it's a nice change. When Bella is with Edward, although I want them together and I will always be on ""Team Edward"" they are very serious, everything is emotional and all their situations are heavy.I've come to be really fond of Kristen Stewart. She, in my opinion, portrays Bella very well. Even though some parts of the movie are very depressing- such as when Bella is sitting at the window staring outside as the months pass- it feels real. Girls or guys that have that constant person in their life and when they are suddenly gone, they don't know what to do with themselves. Most people, react how Bella does and I think showing her suffer in that way was important. It shows that Edward was beyond real for her and that he was incredibly important to her and her life. It also shows how much she missed out with him, such as, her old friends didn't really know her at all and they are in shock when she decides to sit with them at lunch one afternoon instead of sitting by herself.I think ""New Moon"" is also a very good way of showing Jacob Black's story. ""Twilight"" was more about Bella and Edward and now ""New Moon"" is more about Jacob and Bella. It was interesting to see their chemistry and the speed bumps that they had to endure through out the film.If you want my opinion, I suggest you read the books, because they are nothing like the films. The books are truly great, and I firmly suggest you read them before seeing the movies.Want the latest reviews and movie news?

I still can't get over the lack of entertainment value this film provides. The first movie introduced the characters, had some drama, action and a conclusion while still leaving the door open for part 2 which was obvious since they're based on the books.The middle story is probably the worst middle story I've seen. Middle stories can be great, you can go anywhere with them and you can place your protagonist into very challenging situations knowing you have a whole other movie to them out. In this movie we followed a few different characters not really being clear who the protagonist was. This can work in smart movies but in lowbrow stuff like this it just comes off as teenage politics. So the movie had a lot of talking and forced drama and then it ends. The movie could have been 20 minutes and directly rolled into the other two stories.In conclusion the movie is boring. Although the first movie had many of the same teenage cheesy plots, it at least had entertainment value.

1223888,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001OQCV56,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[29, 53]","Teen Romance = True Luv. Breaking up with your True Luv is a fate worse than death. Months-long depression and suicide are valid responses to being dumped.At least that seems to be the underlying message of the second Twilight Saga movie, ""New Moon,"" which is effectively a teen-angst version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" but with more werewolves and less suicide. It's also a flabby adaptation that leaves you wishing that something unpredictable and un-teen-angsty would happen... but it never does.Bella's (Kristen Stewart) eighteenth birthday party is wrecked when she cuts herself.  Jasper goes into a feeding frenzy, and the Cullens realize that she's too tasty to be safe around them. Edward (Robert Pattinson) dumps Bella, and the clan leaves town permanently. Cue emo music, for Bella's life is empty and worthless without Edward.  Seriously. We have a fadefest in which we see how empty and lifeless life is without her Hot Rich Sparkly Coverboy.But after Bella puts herself in danger, she hears Edward ordering her to stop -- so of course she gets a motorcycle and takes up cliff-diving. She also starts palling around with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), an Indian lad who has a supernatural secret of his own (I'll just say it: he's a werewolf) -- and this comes in handy when some Evil Vampires come around hungry for her oh-so-tasty blood.  But her daredevil antics have led Edward to believe her dead... and he's going to take drastic action unless she stops him.""New Moon"" is one of those movies that is essentially the book splattered on the big screen, and not much more. Stephenie Meyers' fans will devour it like so many sparkly vampires, but the rest of the population will probably start wishing that the Volturi would wipe out all of Forks. Where are some brief moments of action and excitement, but most of it is Bella endlessly moping about her Edwardless state, while the world's smallest violin plays.The biggest problem with ""New Moon"" is that it's tediously devoid of any tension: it's pretty obvious from the start how the vampiric ""damnation"" angst, the clashes with the Volturi and werewolves, and even the central love triangle will turn out. Does Bella continue to mope after the brooding, tortured ""goth"" Edward, or does she cut her losses and go with buff, caring ""jock"" Jacob? But there's never a shred of doubt who she'll select... which makes the whole triangle rather pointless.I'll give Chris Weitz credit -- he does try to spice up this bland affair with action scenes and CGI werewolf battles. Unfortunately he also doesn't seem to have cut anything from the storyline, which makes the whole movie feel flabby and overstuffed. And despite the drippy cheesiness of the script (""Bella you give me everything just by breathing!""), the movie also takes itself deadly seriously, without a trickle of humor or self-deprecation.Playing a tragic, lovelorn heroine is difficult, but it stretches Stewart far beyond her limits -- she conveys Bella's emotional states entirely through blank staring and constipated twitches. Bella's aging wangst because she's turning eighteen (so elderly) is pretty contrived, and it's disturbing that our ""heroine"" deals with her post-breakup blues by almost killing herself over and over. Great message to send young girls.Pattinson is mostly absent except for some ghostly visions Bella has, and while he's far more skilled than Stewart, he frankly seems bored by his small role. Lautner and his buff pectorals are a more vibrant presence as Jacob, and he spends most of the movie being heroic and extremely caring. Why is he supposed to be inferior to Edward again?""New Moon"" is one of those movies aimed at pleasing the fans of a particular book. Standing alone, it's a tepid, suspenseless affair that devotes itself to teen wangst, and left me hoping for a Volturi bloodbath.",1,New Mooning after you,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,3840,"['Teen', 'Romance', '=', 'True', 'Luv', 'Breaking', 'up', 'True', 'Luv', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'Months-long', 'depression', 'suicide', 'are', 'valid', 'responses', 'being', 'dumped.At', 'least', 'be', 'underlying', 'message', 'second', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'movie', 'New', 'Moon', 'effectively', 'teen-angst', 'version', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'more', 'werewolves', 'less', 'suicide', 'also', 'flabby', 'adaptation', 'wishing', 'something', 'unpredictable', 'un-teen-angsty', 'would', 'happen', 'never', 'does.Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'eighteenth', 'birthday', 'party', 'wrecked', 'when', 'Jasper', 'feeding', 'frenzy', 'Cullens', 'realize', 'too', 'tasty', 'be', 'safe', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Bella', 'clan', 'town', 'permanently', 'Cue', 'emo', 'music', 'Bella', 'life', 'empty', 'worthless', 'Edward', 'Seriously', 'have', 'fadefest', 'see', 'how', 'empty', 'lifeless', 'life', 'Hot', 'Rich', 'Sparkly', 'Coverboy.But', 'Bella', 'danger', 'Edward', 'ordering', 'stop', 'course', 'motorcycle', 'up', 'cliff-diving', 'also', 'palling', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Indian', 'lad', 'who', 'supernatural', 'secret', 'own', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'werewolf', 'handy', 'when', 'Evil', 'Vampires', 'come', 'hungry', 'oh-so-tasty', 'blood', 'daredevil', 'antics', 'have', 'led', 'Edward', 'believe', 'dead', 'going', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'New', 'Moon', 'one', 'movies', 'essentially', 'book', 'splattered', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Stephenie', 'Meyers', 'fans', 'will', 'devour', 'so', 'many', 'sparkly', 'vampires', 'rest', 'population', 'will', 'probably', 'start', 'wishing', 'Volturi', 'would', 'wipe', 'out', 'Forks', 'Where', 'are', 'brief', 'moments', 'action', 'excitement', 'most', 'Bella', 'endlessly', 'moping', 'Edwardless', 'state', 'world', 'smallest', 'violin', 'plays.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'New', 'Moon', 'tediously', 'devoid', 'tension', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'start', 'how', 'vampiric', 'damnation', 'angst', 'clashes', 'Volturi', 'werewolves', 'even', 'central', 'love', 'triangle', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'Does', 'Bella', 'continue', 'mope', 'brooding', 'tortured', 'goth', 'Edward', 'cut', 'losses', 'go', 'buff', 'caring', 'jock', 'Jacob', 'never', 'shred', 'doubt', 'who', ""'ll"", 'select', 'whole', 'triangle', 'rather', 'pointless.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'credit', 'try', 'spice', 'up', 'bland', 'affair', 'action', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'werewolf', 'battles', 'Unfortunately', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'cut', 'anything', 'storyline', 'whole', 'movie', 'feel', 'flabby', 'overstuffed', 'drippy', 'cheesiness', 'script', 'Bella', 'give', 'everything', 'just', 'breathing', 'movie', 'also', 'deadly', 'seriously', 'trickle', 'humor', 'self-deprecation.Playing', 'tragic', 'lovelorn', 'heroine', 'difficult', 'Stewart', 'far', 'limits', 'conveys', 'Bella', 'emotional', 'states', 'entirely', 'blank', 'staring', 'constipated', 'twitches', 'Bella', 'aging', 'wangst', 'turning', 'eighteen', 'so', 'elderly', 'pretty', 'contrived', 'disturbing', 'heroine', 'deals', 'post-breakup', 'blues', 'almost', 'killing', 'over', 'Great', 'message', 'send', 'young', 'girls.Pattinson', 'mostly', 'absent', 'ghostly', 'visions', 'Bella', 'far', 'more', 'skilled', 'Stewart', 'frankly', 'bored', 'small', 'role', 'Lautner', 'buff', 'pectorals', 'are', 'more', 'vibrant', 'presence', 'Jacob', 'most', 'movie', 'being', 'heroic', 'extremely', 'caring', 'Why', 'supposed', 'be', 'inferior', 'Edward', 'again', 'New', 'Moon', 'one', 'movies', 'aimed', 'pleasing', 'fans', 'particular', 'book', 'Standing', 'alone', 'tepid', 'suspenseless', 'affair', 'teen', 'wangst', 'left', 'hoping', 'Volturi', 'bloodbath']",N/A

1223892,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001OQCV56,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 6]","EDIT-UPDATE: OK, I'm a bit touchy about this review. Could someone have the backbone to leave a post and tell me WHY this review is unhelpful?! Really, stop being babies and give a reason instead of voting me underground!....After the first film caused me to approach projectile vomiting from laughing so hard, I just had to watch this sequel. I'm not a fan of any of this type of thing generally--I haven't read nor will I read the novels--but I am a vampire folklorist. It's my job to look into freaks of nature like this.This review is for my observations that may escape others...you all know the story well, and critiques are good.Let me start saying this film is 200% better than the first. It did not have me laughing, in spite of the schmoozy kissing scenes and the music-video-slo-mo crap. Also I could mute the film at key points, relieving me from the slow death of hearing the modern whiny ""indie"" music, the garbagiola that serves as a soundtrack.But this film learned from the errors of the first film. This blends some grand acting with genuine kick-ass vampire and werewolf scenes. I actually enjoyed the laying off the vampire sauce, because the werewolves deserve a whole film of their own. I guess I tire easily these days when it comes to bloodsuckers. A hunky boy who can change into a giant dog on the fly, now THAT'S entertainment.Seriously speaking, this film in many scenes reminded me of the better horror films of the past, the slightly more romantic, emotional films such as THE HUNGER, and it had humor that reminded me of Polanski's FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS. Even good old Robert-my-boy didn't gross me out as much as in the first film, but then again, he had to contend with the cute likes of Dakota Fanning and the strong presence of Michael Sheen. By the way, these two had way too little screen time, and their respective roles were fascinating. Also lousy in my eyes as a critic was the cameo by Graham Greene. I thought he would wind up being some super-cool medicine man or something, not a damned innocent vampire victim!This made me wonder what it is about Edward's silly pet--sorry, girlfriend--that scares these vampires so much aside from the fact that they can't read her mind or affect her in any other way. And why the hell do the wolves love her so? Is her father a wolf too? Or do I have it wrong...Is it that vampires will tolerate LOUSY acting but wolves just go nuts over it?Truly, what the hell is she to the vampires, like bait that ultimately mesmerizes then hooks the fisherman?--I can't guess. That's what I get for not reading the silly novels. Saying which, thank God this thing stayed away from Anne Rice finally. Pity it keeps stealing from HARRY POTTER. C'MON!! A big black dog watching over this B-actress bimbo??Oh, and finally: where the hell is Forks? Is that Washington State? Beautiful place, anyway....",3,Never Trust A Film Reviewer.

The plot is all over the place, the weirdest distraction being an abrupt road trip to Italy to keep Edward from sparkling inappropriately.  If there was meant to be any drama or suspense I haven't seen it anywhere.  All I did see was that dreary, drab Bella Swan moping endlessly.  Not that it was easy to distinguish her lifeless behavior from her normal expressionless demeanor.  When this sourpuss wasn't moping, she was nagging BITE ME!

1223905,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B001OQCV56,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 4]","I'm man enough to admit I kind of liked the first Twilight film. It provided enough material for me to actively make fun of the film. Plus, THEY LITERALLY SPARKLE! Plus, as soon as I was starting to get bored, there was an ""action scene"" that was entertaining enough. Sure, it was utter crap, but it was entertaining crap. New Moon on the other hand? Just crap. Essentially, 8 more minutes are devoted to this movie than the last one, and NOTHING HAPPENS!Of course the biggest reveal of the movie is that Native American Jacob is a werewolf. What?!? So, while Edward is away doing Vampire things, Bella falls for Jacob, and they spend a while on that. But, this time is enough for you to say, yeah, Jacob is the better man. He's nicer, he's not trying to push Bella away all the time, he has some acting skills, he looks better shirtless, he doesn't look pale, and he has a better head on his shoulders. Essentially, Jacob is better than Edward in almost every fashion imaginable. I'm Team Jacob, and everybody that's Team Edward is not thinking with their brain. But still, the movie does give us a break from our favorite emo vampire, and I thank if for that. But still, this movie is exceedingly boring. I could go into how horrible the relationships is done, or what as soulless character Bella Swan is, or how heavy-handed the scenes are done, but hey, that's how Twilight rolls. Also note, Chris Weitz, after making The Golden Compass, got sent to director jail by being forced to make this movie, and this guy should never be allowed to direct again. Granted, you  can only do so much with the material, but he chooses to do nothing with it. If anything, he makes it more unbearable.Let's get to the ""best"" parts of the movie, shall we? Ok, the music is pretty good. Granted, they're never used that well in the context of the film, but hey, it's good music. Also, the last act is a throwback to the craziness of the first film. Basically, Edward, being the emo kid that he is, wants to expose himself as a vampire by biting somebody in a pretty Italian town so he basically have himself killed, since he heard the rumor that Bella was dead. Sounds silly? Oh yeah, it is. The scene essentially pulls a ""Couples Retreat"" since the only reason you have it in the movie is so you can vacation in Italy for a couple of days. Also, poor Michael Sheen. He's not even close to being a great actor, but he's pretty decent, and he's forced to essentially play a more over-the-top Vampire-version of Grima Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings films (That's the character's name, right?). The whole counsel stuff is even more unbearably awful than before, and it's at this point you start praying for sweet death. Then the movie ends with the promise that, ""Hey, stuff is actually going to happen in the next movie!"" Let's see if they keep this promise, since they've utterly failed so far.Overall, there are very few redeeming features about New Moon, and its plot could have been cut down to 30-40 minutes. To fill up time, you get lengthy scenes of tedious dialogue, longing stares, strange showings of ""emotion,"" and the awful direction of Chris Weitz. Only true Twi-hards love this film and its book, so maybe it's just the material, because I don't know how much more of this I can take.",1,This Moon is Made of Moldy Cheese,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3290,"[""'m"", 'man', 'enough', 'admit', 'kind', 'liked', 'first', 'Twilight', 'film', 'provided', 'enough', 'material', 'actively', 'make', 'fun', 'film', 'THEY', 'LITERALLY', 'SPARKLE', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'bored', 'was', 'action', 'scene', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'Sure', 'was', 'utter', 'crap', 'was', 'entertaining', 'crap', 'New', 'Moon', 'other', 'hand', 'Just', 'crap', 'Essentially', '8', 'more', 'minutes', 'are', 'devoted', 'movie', 'last', 'one', 'NOTHING', 'HAPPENS', 'course', 'biggest', 'reveal', 'movie', 'Native', 'American', 'Jacob', 'werewolf', 'What', 'So', 'Edward', 'away', 'doing', 'Vampire', 'things', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'spend', 'while', 'time', 'enough', 'say', 'yeah', 'Jacob', 'better', 'man', 'nicer', 'not', 'trying', 'push', 'Bella', 'away', 'time', 'acting', 'skills', 'better', 'shirtless', ""n't"", 'look', 'pale', 'better', 'head', 'shoulders', 'Essentially', 'Jacob', 'better', 'Edward', 'almost', 'fashion', 'imaginable', ""'m"", 'Team', 'Jacob', 'everybody', 'Team', 'Edward', 'not', 'thinking', 'brain', 'still', 'movie', 'give', 'break', 'favorite', 'emo', 'vampire', 'thank', 'still', 'movie', 'exceedingly', 'boring', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'horrible', 'relationships', 'done', 'what', 'soulless', 'character', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'how', 'heavy-handed', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'hey', 'how', 'Twilight', 'Also', 'note', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'making', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'got', 'sent', 'director', 'jail', 'being', 'forced', 'make', 'movie', 'guy', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'direct', 'again', 'Granted', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'do', 'nothing', 'anything', 'more', 'unbearable.Let', 'get', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'shall', 'Ok', 'music', 'pretty', 'good', 'Granted', ""'re"", 'never', 'used', 'well', 'context', 'film', 'hey', 'good', 'music', 'Also', 'last', 'act', 'throwback', 'craziness', 'first', 'film', 'Basically', 'Edward', 'being', 'emo', 'kid', 'expose', 'vampire', 'biting', 'somebody', 'pretty', 'Italian', 'town', 'so', 'basically', 'have', 'killed', 'heard', 'rumor', 'Bella', 'was', 'dead', 'silly', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'scene', 'essentially', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'can', 'vacation', 'Italy', 'couple', 'days', 'Also', 'poor', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'pretty', 'decent', 'forced', 'essentially', 'play', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'Vampire-version', 'Grima', 'Wormtongue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'character', 'name', 'right', 'whole', 'counsel', 'stuff', 'even', 'more', 'unbearably', 'awful', 'before', 'point', 'start', 'praying', 'sweet', 'death', 'Then', 'movie', 'promise', 'Hey', 'stuff', 'actually', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'movie', 'Let', 'see', 'keep', 'promise', ""'ve"", 'utterly', 'failed', 'so', 'far.Overall', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'redeeming', 'features', 'New', 'Moon', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'down', '30-40', 'minutes', 'fill', 'up', 'time', 'get', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'tedious', 'dialogue', 'longing', 'stares', 'strange', 'showings', 'emotion', 'awful', 'direction', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'Only', 'true', 'Twi-hards', 'film', 'book', 'maybe', 'just', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'take']",N/A

1223909,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B001OQCV56,Geaux Lightly,"[2, 2]","And women who should know better. I just watched New Moon last night via Netflix. That was pretty much the only way I would watch it bc I would never have paid for a ticket. From the beginning, the hype killed my interest. The actors were everywhere. I couldn't shop at Nordstrom w/o seeing their cardboard cutouts. Teens were going nuts, women my age (27) going nuts, women my MOM'S age were going nuts. First movie I didn't watch til this year when we had a blizzard. I watched NM last night and it was bad. I'm a fan of Buffy, Angel, some Anne Rice, heck, I even liked that weird Jim Carrey vampire movie from before he became a star, but Twilight bugs me. The second time around, sparkling faces *still* don't do it for me. I'm no big fan of ""Edward,"" but he looked worse in this movie. The makeup job on him was over the top. Christina Aguilera would have been jealous of how red his lips were. He looked more like a clown than the undead. ""KStew's"" range of emotions are *still* Emo and More Emo. Of the three, Jacob did the best acting bc he was the only one I hoped survived. He might have a future in Hollywood if he can get away from this franchise. He and Edward had more chemistry than Bella had w/either one of them. As in Twilight, the nemesis tension between them was palpable. I will admit I did rewind their phone call several times. Taylor's delivery of those lines was very good. The script was humorless which is pretty sad for a teen movie. It's obviously a moody film, but there was no typical-teen sarcasm or anything like that. New Moon takes itself wayyyy too seriously as though it'll be played on Turner Classics someday.On to the story, it was utter garbage. No plot, no action, no suspense. Was there really any doubt of how it would end? I cringed through the entire movie. I only kept it on since it would have been a waste of my Netflix free trial. I'm a person who can watch movies from Citizen Kane to My Man Godfrey to Memento to The Hangover and enjoy them all. I'm not pretentious with entertainment, so I was honestly hoping that the series would have found a groove and improved once the 2nd movie appeared. It's still the same overly hormonal stuff. It's funny because I'm an 80s baby so we had Clueless (Jane Austen-inspired), Sixteen Candles, River Phoenix, 10 Things (Shakespearean), Scream, and many others. These millennium kids have Twilight. What a gyp. Edward and Bella are NOT Romeo and Juliet. Edward was a vision for a good chunk of the movie which suited me just fine; however, his absence caused Bella to have screaming fits at night (see: obsession). She gets closer to Jacob during this time doing pretty normal teenage stuff: motorcycles, movies, etc. She even embraces warmth. ((Which honestly, even in a fluffy movie like this, had so much potential. It would have been more interesting if the story was written in a way that Jacob ACTUALLY had a chance. Her ""I love you"" was pretty ridiculous considering her next line was: ""Don't make me choose bc it would be him, meaning Edward. Killed any chance for a believable triangle.)) That goes to hell once Ed's ""sister"" returns and you just see a regression in Bella. She becomes more obsessed with Edward. She disses Jacob who actually helped her during the time she was depressed.Which also begs to question: what is it that draws these guys to such a downer type of girl? I mean, she's so BLAH. Edward, ok yeah, I can see it, but Jacob could do so much better. He has family, nice future sis-in-law, a better outlook on life...dude, get away from this moody girl.Disclosure: I skipped over the entire part of the movie in the temple structure or whatever. Once Edward came back, Bella started talking about turning again, and I lost interest. The only reason she wanted to turn was because she had nothing else going for her, which is sad for a girl of only 18.  I guess this makes me part of ""Team Jacob"" by default but that's more because there was no obsession there. Her ""love"" for Edward was pure obsession not based in any type of reality. She's being hunted because of him. I totally understand...who wouldn't want to be w/someone whose presence makes them a target? //total sarcasm.As for the effects, the CGI was better this time, but still obvious. LoTR or House of Flying Daggers this is not. I did like the werewolf scenes perhaps because at least they resembled wolves. The vamps were still fangless and hanging out in the sunlight. Edward and Bella also did a good bit of mumbling; I shouldn't have to turn my volume to 50 or read lips to figure out what's going on. The scripted lines made me so embarrassed for the actors. Jacob said something like ""it's gonna get ugly in here."" Did he momentarily morph not into a werewolf but a 60 yr old man? LOL, he was the only one of the 3 leads that I liked, so that line made me say ""ugh.""When the movie ended, I said ""that's it?"" I had no desire to see Eclipse. In fact, I went ahead and read the plot on Wikipedia just so that another Netflix movie wouldn't be wasted.If you have to watch a movie about teenage girls in crisis, watch Man in the Moon (Reese Witherspoon) or Mermaids (Winona Ryder).

Part three is coming soon.The scenery in Washington State is nice and the musical score is pretty.  The acting is bland as is the chemistry between Bella and Edward and Bella and Jacob.

I knew I wasn't going to like it, but my OCD makes me feel obligated to finish a series I already started watching.Let me start by saying that if you already watched Twilight, there's no reason at all to watch this because it's the exact same story all over again, except with a different guy as Bella's interest.  She likes a guy, and he's nice to her for a while, then he pushes her away because he can't be with her due to his supernatural genetics, then he pulls her back because he just can't stand to be without her, yadda yadda yadda, cheesy romance novel plot points, the end.  Seriously, didn't we already see this last time?  Can't the author/director come up with something different other than a girl who is obsessed with being with guys she shouldn't be with, especially when both guys are so hesitant to be with her?  Even though I haven't read the books, I'm afraid only the author could possibly be to blame for coming up with the weakest character development I've ever read/seen.  Nobody's motives in this story make any sense whatsoever.  I still have no idea why Bella loves Edward, or how she can claim to love him so hopelessly while falling in love with Jacob at the same time.  And what is Edward and Jacob's attraction to Bella?  She never laughs or does anything for them, all she does is mope and hate the world.  In the beginning, I'm not even sure why Bella is so mopey about losing Edward, because even when they were together all she did was mope, mope, and mope some more.  She's so cynical I want to punch her in the face!  And she says ""like"" between every other word.  I know that's how teenagers talk now, but I expect richer dialogue from a major Hollywood movie.  I'm sorry, but you have to love the main character in a movie, and Bella is obsessive, moody, naive, selfish, dull, and ditzy.Much like the first film, most of the acting is extremely weak and done without any enthusiasm.  The special effects on the wolves looks cartoony and silly like Alvin & The Chipmunks.  Nobody acts natural in this movie, everyone is either being mopey or striking a pose like they're on the cover of Vogue Magazine.  Everything is in slow motion like some sort of Backstreet Boys music video.  Just to show that I'm not trying to hate this movie, I'll point out that I did think the soundtrack had some unique selections that fit the scenes rather well, and that somewhere down deep in all this mess is a story with potential.  But everything about the plot, acting, dialogue, and special effects just seems to be stock and amateur...Like something that a 12-year-old girl would write.  Maybe that's why they like it so much.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's still better than the 2 worst movies I've ever seen (Charlie's Angels and Batman & Robin), but that's not saying much.",2,"""New Moon"" has everything you can expect from a BAD movie!",1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2957,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'subjected', 'watching', 'probably', 'same', 'reason', 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'curiosity', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'OCD', 'feel', 'obligated', 'finish', 'series', 'already', 'started', 'start', 'saying', 'already', 'watched', 'Twilight', 'reason', 'watch', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'different', 'guy', 'Bella', 'interest', 'guy', 'nice', 'while', 'then', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'due', 'supernatural', 'genetics', 'then', 'back', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'cheesy', 'romance', 'novel', 'plot', 'points', 'end', 'Seriously', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'see', 'last', 'time', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'author/director', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'different', 'other', 'girl', 'who', 'obsessed', 'being', 'guys', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'hesitant', 'be', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'only', 'author', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'blame', 'coming', 'up', 'weakest', 'character', 'development', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read/seen', 'Nobody', 'motives', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'how', 'can', 'claim', 'love', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'falling', 'love', 'Jacob', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'attraction', 'Bella', 'never', 'anything', 'mope', 'hate', 'world', 'beginning', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'why', 'Bella', 'so', 'mopey', 'losing', 'Edward', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'together', 'did', 'was', 'mope', 'mope', 'mope', 'more', 'so', 'cynical', 'want', 'punch', 'face', 'other', 'word', 'know', 'how', 'teenagers', 'talk', 'now', 'expect', 'richer', 'dialogue', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'love', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'Bella', 'obsessive', 'moody', 'naive', 'selfish', 'dull', 'ditzy.Much', 'first', 'film', 'most', 'acting', 'extremely', 'weak', 'done', 'enthusiasm', 'special', 'effects', 'wolves', 'cartoony', 'silly', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'Nobody', 'natural', 'movie', 'everyone', 'being', 'mopey', 'striking', 'pose', ""'re"", 'cover', 'Vogue', 'Magazine', 'Everything', 'slow', 'motion', 'sort', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'music', 'video', 'Just', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'hate', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'did', 'think', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'unique', 'selections', 'fit', 'scenes', 'rather', 'well', 'somewhere', 'down', 'deep', 'mess', 'story', 'potential', 'everything', 'plot', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'be', 'stock', 'amateur', 'something', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'would', 'write', 'Maybe', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '1', 'star', 'still', 'better', '2', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'not', 'saying', 'much']",N/A

1223920,A2CKFO5H9PUZN9,B001OQCV56,Heather,"[2, 3]","I am not a fan of this series in any format, by any means. I finally caved in after a friend kept badgering me about seeing this film. The movie as a whole was better than the first film, if only marginally. The soundtrack blended into one big, boring mess and did nothing to accentuate the ""feeling"" of the moment. I laughed in inappropriate places -- especially in the beginning, when Bella was whining about being old at 18, and at the ""birthday party turned bloodbath"".Kristen Stewart proved once again that she can't act her way out of a paper bag. She has two facial expressions: blank and mopey. Her voice was monotone, and all through the film I could only think of the one or two interviews I've seen of her, which also left me with the impression that there isn't a whole lot going on upstairs, for her or Bella. Robert Pattinson was only mildly less creepy and stalker-ish than he was in the first film. I laughed when Edward made comments about his age and Bella said that it was gross and creepy for him to be dating her. Yeah, chick, you got it. I think knowing that he doesn't really like playing Edward is a redeeming point in his favor.Surprisingly, I found the character of Jacob to be the most realistic and appealing. No, ladies, it's not just the abs (although I'm not complaining there), although the constant shirtlessness rendered him more beefcake than leading man. If they could have kept his shirt on more, it would have given the character an opportunity to be more than Bella's substitute arm candy. Despite these limitations, Lautner manages to convey all the awkwardness of a 16-year-old with his first crush, and you can tell that Jacob genuinely likes Bella, despite the fact that she's just using him. I felt sorry for him when Bella rejected him completely in favor of Edward. Yep, dude, she kept on saying how much she needs you and how you're her best friend, but she'll drop you completely for sparkly boy. His long wig was better this time, and I wish they would've kept his hair long rather than chopping it off.Jasper almost seemed like something other than a tree or piece of furniture, but the birthday party scene was just ridiculous. As usual, the other Cullens (except for Alice) mainly wandered around in the background, contributing little or nothing to the ""plot"".The Volturi brought a point of mild interest. Michael Sheen (who portrayed Robbie Ross in ""Wilde"") did a great job as the Volturi leader Aro. You could tell that the character had a few screws loose, which actually made him a bit scary. Dakota Fanning hardly said a dozen words, but she was a creepy little thing with those red eyes. The blonde male in the Volturi who may have said a line or two at some point -- if he did, I didn't notice -- had the worst wig in the film, and that is saying something.Charlie. I really felt for Bella's long-suffering dad. He searched all over for her when her pathetic self got lost in the woods and just laid down and cried, and he had to put up with her moping for months and sleep on the couch so he could go upstairs every night and wake her when she had her ""creepy stalker Edward withdrawals"". Personally, at that point I would've thought my kid was on drugs and would've sent her to rehab.Finally, the constant attempt to compare these two nitwits with the star-crossed lovers in ""Romeo and Juliet"" was just sad. There is no comparison between the drivel that is Twilight and a tragedy that has endured centuries as a beloved play. For those who would criticize me and ask why I watched it if I dislike it so much, I'll say this: ""Twilight"" is like a car wreck. It's horrible and hideous, but you can't look away.

1223921,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B001OQCV56,Hikari,"[1, 2]","After watching the first movie and trying (unsucessfully) to finish the book, I see that any perceived weaknesses in the script writing for the movies based on Stephanie Meyer's novels can be directly linked to the woodeness and superficiality of the source material itself.  Bella Swan and Edward Cullen might be marginally more likeable on the page than they are on the screen, but only just.  Now, all that being said, I enjoyed this second installment light-years more than the first.  Not because Robert Pattison & Kristen Stewart more successfully embody their literary counterparts or show any sort of  acting development (they don't), or because the special effects are so much better than the first time around (they aren't).  What the franchise does successfully do is capture the moody, rainy atmosphere of Forks, Washington, highlighting it with an equally moody and oddly compelling soundtrack.  The score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic; the cinematography is excellent.  Ms, Stewart in particular seems to have a face the camera loves--she is a visually lovely Bella, a suitably Gothic heroine with a look that is both contemporary and ethereal.  What a shame she ever has to open her mouth and ruin the illusion.  Robert Pattison's Edward is notably absent for most of this film, which is just as well because his pained and pasty stylings as Edward make me laugh aloud, ruining the mood somewhat.  All the other vampires in the Cullen family are great-looking and about as deep as the paper cut Bella gives herself in an early scene.  The guest turns by Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning in particular are so brief as to be little more than cameos.  In a cast full of bigger names, there is one true breakout star here and his name is Taylor Lautner, playing tortured best friend/wolf boy Jacob.  His magnificent abs aside, Lautner displays actual acting potential and personality, both notably lacking in his co-stars who get most of the press for this series.  I am looking forward to seeing much more of Mr. Lautner, and I mean that in every sense possible.  Here's hoping that he, like Daniel Radcliffe, can find success in adult roles once it's time to put his shirt back on.",3,Moon Shine,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2198,"['watching', 'first', 'movie', 'trying', 'unsucessfully', 'finish', 'book', 'see', 'perceived', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'writing', 'movies', 'based', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'novels', 'can', 'be', 'directly', 'linked', 'woodeness', 'superficiality', 'source', 'material', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'might', 'be', 'marginally', 'more', 'likeable', 'page', 'are', 'screen', 'only', 'just', 'Now', 'being', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'installment', 'light-years', 'more', 'first', 'Not', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'more', 'successfully', 'embody', 'literary', 'counterparts', 'show', 'sort', 'acting', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'What', 'franchise', 'successfully', 'do', 'capture', 'moody', 'rainy', 'atmosphere', 'Forks', 'Washington', 'highlighting', 'equally', 'moody', 'oddly', 'compelling', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'Ms', 'Stewart', 'particular', 'have', 'face', 'camera', 'visually', 'lovely', 'Bella', 'suitably', 'Gothic', 'heroine', 'look', 'contemporary', 'ethereal', 'What', 'shame', 'ever', 'open', 'mouth', 'ruin', 'illusion', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'Edward', 'notably', 'absent', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'pained', 'pasty', 'stylings', 'Edward', 'make', 'aloud', 'ruining', 'mood', 'somewhat', 'other', 'vampires', 'Cullen', 'family', 'are', 'great-looking', 'as', 'deep', 'paper', 'cut', 'Bella', 'early', 'scene', 'guest', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'particular', 'are', 'so', 'brief', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'cameos', 'cast', 'full', 'bigger', 'names', 'one', 'true', 'breakout', 'star', 'here', 'name', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'playing', 'tortured', 'best', 'friend/wolf', 'boy', 'Jacob', 'magnificent', 'abs', 'aside', 'Lautner', 'actual', 'acting', 'potential', 'personality', 'notably', 'lacking', 'co-stars', 'who', 'get', 'most', 'press', 'series', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Lautner', 'mean', 'sense', 'possible', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'can', 'find', 'success', 'adult', 'roles', 'time', 'put', 'shirt', 'back']",N/A

It's much easier to swallow than the seemingly forced interaction between Stewart and Pattinson in the first film. The werewolves and vampires going at it were also great to watch - I saw nothing wrong with the werewolf CGI: it fit perfectly with the tone of the film. The Volturi and the Cullens fighting it out was fun to watch as well. The cinematography was also a vast improvement, with sweeping vistas and far more color than the original (the 360 degree shot of Stewart in front of the window while the seasons change outside was simply beautiful). Having Pattison out of the picture for the majority of the film's running time also helped enormously, since the character of Edward is almost painful to watch. And not in a good way.Girls and women who have been through something similar to Bella - falling in love, being separated, and finding comfort in another - will find this film far more enjoyable and engaging than the original. Although the seriousness of the boys (excluding Mike, who is always enjoyable) can become tiresome after an hour or so, the film never really drags its feet. Only the first fifteen or so minutes will seem to stretch on for ages. The tone that follows sets the stage for a rather sad and bittersweet (mostly bitter) ending.If you haven't seen Twilight, skip it and go straight for the sequel: you won't miss much.

1223932,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001OQCV56,Jason,"[11, 15]","I was completely unenthralled with Twilight (i. e. The World Staring Contest Championships I), so I walked into New Moon with a bit of trepidation.  I am pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the second part of this series.Much like the recent Transformers revitalization, where far too much screen time was given to bad actors (i. e. Shia Labeouf) at the expense of the stars (i.e. the Transformer robots), New Moon improves significantly over its prequel by focusing on the vampires and werewolves, and minimizing Kristen Stewart's screen time.  Let's be honest; her acting is atrocious.Every.line.is.delivered.like.a.robot.""You.are.a.werewolf.""In the series the vampires have wonderful powers, one of which is mind-reading.  Not surprisingly, they can't read the character Bella's thoughts because Kristen Stewart is nearly devoid of expression and emotion.  She is to the Twilight series what Hayden Christianson is to Star Wars.  Or maybe she's Jar Jar Binx.  Nevertheless, this movie improves upon the original because there is more action, more character struggle, and better emotional expression of the teen angst love triangle developing between the zombie (Bella), the vampire (Edward), and the werewolf (Jacob).  Incidentally, ""The Zombie, the Vampire, and the Werewolf"" sounds like an awesome sitcom idea.  Send me an email if you're game, HBO.As the love triangle bleeds into the classic battle between two arch nemeses (i.e. Vampires and Werewolves), the teen angst and love gets as thick as a slow rolling fog often seen in horror movies.  Despite the fog, however thick it may metaphorically be, the travesty that is the sparkly vampire can be seen.  Aside from the zombie, the sparkly is the film's biggest flaw.Early in the movie Edward leaves Bella.  The predictable dialogue and wooden delivery would have you believe it's for her safety, even though everyone knows it is because of her wretched acting.  This opens the door for her to pout, sob, and mourn - emotionlessly - and eventually open up to Jacob, who is mere days away from a werewolf quasi-pubescent awakening - an idea stolen directly from Teen Wolf.  Sure enough, she leads him on and hurts him because she's ignorantly holding out for Mr. Sparkles.  I honestly can't see how anyone can like her.  She was a complete weakling, a wad of chewed emotional bubblegum in the first one, and now she's the classic easily hated woman who completely destroys a man by playing with his emotions.Nonetheless, the werewolves in this film are stupendous.  Powerful and menacing, they follow the lead of all other werewolf lore; in other words, they don't sparkle.  The special effects are actually pretty awesome.  Watching the werewolves run after and attack the vampires is nearly perfect.  And the transformation from human to werewolf is on par with any other transformation in cinema history.

1223936,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B001OQCV56,Jean-ren Leroux,"[2, 7]","Although ""New Moon"" isn't a classic, i do think that most of the bad reviews aren't necessarily fair with the movie. A bit condescending i might even say. I saw the film and i have enjoyed it immensely. From start to finish. Just the introduction itself was gripping. The title ""New Moon"" slowly appearing as the full moon unfolds, the slow beat of the menacing drums, then a flash of Bella running through the crowd in Italy...The acting was better. Kristen Stewart didn't blink as much in this second opus. And Robert Pattinson's play was more even. I do find though that Taylor Lautner's voice was too ""mature"" for his age, like he was trying too hard to sound ""manly"". But the acting of Michael Sheen and Dakota fanning, even if so small, was nothing more than chilling! And even if we don't see Rachel Lefebvre that much, man is she frightening! It's a shame they didn't hold on to her for ""Eclipse"". Bryce Dallas Howard is a gifted actress and she will no doubt make a great Victoria but once you're accustomed to Miss Lefebvre's play, it's hard to imagine someone else filling the shoes.The special effects were far more better and way cooler, the make-up was less laughable and the scenery was superb. Apart from the ridiculous scene in slow motion where Edward and Bella are running happily in the wood, i felt like the pacing of the film along with the rythm of the scenes were perfect. And the music, wether from Alexandre Desplat or from other artists, was always in the right tone with the sequences it was underlining. The piece ""The Meadow"" is so romantic and tragical in nature. It just gives the movie an even bigger scope in terms of emotion. But i would have thought that the song ( i don't remember the title but it goes ""Help me carry the fire"") would have fitted perfectly in the scene where Jacob carrys an almost drowned Bella in his arms.On a other level, the punch line in the end is perfect and sets the right tone for ""Eclipse"".The one thing i liked about Chris Weitz was that he respected the point of view of Bella. The books are written from HER point of view and you see only what SHE sees. If she's not there, you don't see it. You only hear about it because SHE does. I liked that and that was respected in the second installment. Not in the first. The battle scene at the end of ""Twilight"" was violating that rule and wasn't even that great anyway. I hope they will respect that in ""Eclipse"", especially in the final battle scene between the Cullens. the werewolves and the other bad vampires created by Victoria (you don't ""see it"" in the novel. Rather, you stay with Bella who is cornered by Victoria).And i do hope that for ""Breaking Dawn"" they'll find a way to make Jacob's character less infantile and weak (like he is in the last book).Anyhow, it's just a thought. The third film will be out soon. And i can't wait to see what the new director (David Slade) brings to the party. He's the one who directed ""30 Days Of Night"", a great horror film that shows his unique style of filming.Nothing to make Catherine Hardwicke's more-than-normal work more impressive. Although obviously talented, she is definitely the weaker link in the chain of directors assigned to the twilight saga. That great idea of filming the book cover (with the apple) was a stroke of genius, though. But other than that, when compared to the other directors... the lack of experience is obvious, i think. No?Am i beeing too hard?",3,Don't you wish now that we could re-shoot the first film?,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,3442,"['New', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'classic', 'i', 'do', 'think', 'most', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fair', 'movie', 'bit', 'condescending', 'i', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'saw', 'film', 'i', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'start', 'finish', 'Just', 'introduction', 'was', 'gripping', 'title', 'New', 'Moon', 'slowly', 'appearing', 'full', 'moon', 'unfolds', 'slow', 'beat', 'menacing', 'drums', 'then', 'flash', 'Bella', 'running', 'crowd', 'Italy', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'did', ""n't"", 'blink', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'opus', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'play', 'was', 'more', 'even', 'do', 'find', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'voice', 'was', 'too', 'mature', 'age', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'sound', 'manly', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Dakota', 'fanning', 'even', 'so', 'small', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'chilling', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Rachel', 'Lefebvre', 'much', 'man', 'frightening', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Eclipse', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'gifted', 'actress', 'will', 'doubt', 'make', 'great', 'Victoria', 'once', ""'re"", 'accustomed', 'Miss', 'Lefebvre', 'play', 'hard', 'imagine', 'someone', 'else', 'filling', 'shoes.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'better', 'way', 'cooler', 'make-up', 'was', 'less', 'laughable', 'scenery', 'was', 'superb', 'Apart', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'slow', 'motion', 'where', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'are', 'running', 'happily', 'wood', 'i', 'felt', 'pacing', 'film', 'rythm', 'scenes', 'were', 'perfect', 'music', 'wether', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'other', 'artists', 'was', 'always', 'right', 'tone', 'sequences', 'was', 'underlining', 'piece', 'Meadow', 'so', 'romantic', 'tragical', 'nature', 'just', 'movie', 'even', 'bigger', 'scope', 'terms', 'emotion', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'song', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'title', 'Help', 'carry', 'fire', 'would', 'have', 'fitted', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'where', 'Jacob', 'almost', 'drowned', 'Bella', 'arms.On', 'other', 'level', 'punch', 'line', 'end', 'perfect', 'right', 'tone', 'Eclipse', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'liked', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'was', 'respected', 'point', 'view', 'Bella', 'books', 'are', 'written', 'HER', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'only', 'what', 'SHE', 'not', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'only', 'hear', 'SHE', 'liked', 'was', 'respected', 'second', 'installment', 'Not', 'first', 'battle', 'scene', 'end', 'Twilight', 'was', 'violating', 'rule', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'great', 'anyway', 'hope', 'will', 'respect', 'Eclipse', 'especially', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'Cullens', 'werewolves', 'other', 'bad', 'vampires', 'created', 'Victoria', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'novel', 'stay', 'Bella', 'who', 'cornered', 'Victoria', '.And', 'i', 'do', 'hope', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', ""'ll"", 'find', 'way', 'make', 'Jacob', 'character', 'infantile', 'weak', 'last', 'book', '.Anyhow', 'just', 'thought', 'third', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'soon', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'party', 'one', 'who', 'directed', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'unique', 'style', 'filming.Nothing', 'make', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'more-than-normal', 'work', 'more', 'impressive', 'obviously', 'talented', 'definitely', 'weaker', 'link', 'chain', 'directors', 'assigned', 'twilight', 'saga', 'great', 'idea', 'filming', 'book', 'cover', 'apple', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'though', 'other', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'directors', 'lack', 'experience', 'obvious', 'i', 'think', 'Am', 'i', 'beeing', 'too', 'hard']",N/A

1223946,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001OQCV56,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 2]","I'm not sure why Roger Ebert gave the first **1/2 but this movie * when I think it was a lot better. It has more humor and it's more engaging romance wise. The movie is a little long and slow, yet I think it still had a lot more action than the first. I don't know why the Edward and James fight won best fight at the MTV Movie Awards. It was short and not memorable. There's more excitement in this film.Plus, sorry but I just like that there's less Edward Cullem (Robert Pattinson) in New Moon. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) are more fun together in both the book and the movies. I mean, I find it repetitive in the books and the movie when Bella wants to kiss Edward longer and he constantly backs away not wanting to hurt her. There's more laughs and charm in the movie in the Bella and Jacob scenes, minus Edward.I also found the direction to be better this time around. The first movie had too much scenes with vampires walking in slow motion or close-ups of Edward and Bella as they just stare at each other. This one feels a lot less like it's just some sexy Levis Commercial lol. The script to me is better as well since I felt the first should have had more vampire history when it came to the other Cullens, especially Alice. Here, the script is at least true to the book and everything about Jake is covered nicely.I think critics need to lighten up towards Twilight a little. Sure I was annoyed how fans made sure Twilight won every award at the MTV movie Awards. I don't think it was the best movie of 2008 or even close.

We get a glimpse of Bella 60 years in the future, old and wrinkled, if she continues as a human, and we think maybe she has a good point.Anyway, most of this movie is spent watching Bella and Edward absent from and pining for each other.  Perky little Alice arranges a birthday party for Bella in the Cullen house.  Fun and games for all.  But Bella suffers a paper cut while opening a present and Jasper goes berserk.  Oops.  Edward, horrified at what could have happened, decides he is too dangerous for Bella to be around and manages to spirit the whole Cullen family out of town while Bella sits around for the next three or four months in a terminal funk in moldering clothes, pining for Edward who is off somewhere pining for her.  At this point you probably need a Valium.Some relief from the interminable woe comes from Jacob, seizing his chance while Edward is out of the picture to romance Bella and a sort of relationship develops, only she thinks it's friendship and he thinks it's love.  Bella does all kinds of idiotic things to conjure up visual hallucinations of Edward, including throwing herself off a cliff, when improbably Alice pops up and says Edward is off to the Volturi (we never learn exactly who they are and what they represent except they seem to be some kind of vampire mafia) because he's so dejected without Bella that he wants to be really dead instead of only undead.  So Bella is off to the rescue and the film reaches its improbable conclusion.  But the whole film is improbable to begin with, so the conclusion is a fairly reliable outcome.I don't see much character development in this film, unless it's Jacob, who unexpectedly morphs into a werewolf (Bella seems to attract all kinds of monsters), and Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson give the same one-note performances as in ""Twilight"", but Jacob seems like a totally different character, probably from getting a decent haircut and beefing up.  He's turned into a caramel-colored hunk with that luscious golden skin, and Pattinson is still drop-dead gorgeous, even if his acting abilities still leave a lot to be desired.  In fact, I like the Cullens, except for Rosalie, who seems less like a tragic character and more like a spoiled brat who is pissed off because her brother is dating a girl she doesn't approve of.  And Billy Burke, as Bella's dad, once again walks off with the whole movie.There are some interesting special effects (hunky cute guys morphing into huge wolves) but no real violence and no sex to speak of; this film is nothing you couldn't take a ten year old to watch.  Only most ten year olds, as well as most over-tens, will probably be bored into a coma watching Bella mooning over Edward and vice-versa.  They really should have played down the depression and built up the action.  It would have made for a more enjoyable movie.Judy Lind",3,Silly but enjoyable in spots,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2988,"['New', 'Moon', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Twilight', 'left', 'off', 'Bella', 'longing', 'be', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'trying', 'talk', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Bella', '60', 'years', 'future', 'old', 'wrinkled', 'human', 'think', 'maybe', 'good', 'point.Anyway', 'most', 'movie', 'spent', 'watching', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'absent', 'pining', 'other', 'Perky', 'little', 'Alice', 'birthday', 'party', 'Bella', 'Cullen', 'house', 'Fun', 'games', 'Bella', 'paper', 'cut', 'opening', 'present', 'Jasper', 'berserk', 'Oops', 'Edward', 'horrified', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'too', 'dangerous', 'Bella', 'be', 'around', 'spirit', 'whole', 'Cullen', 'family', 'town', 'Bella', 'next', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'terminal', 'funk', 'moldering', 'clothes', 'pining', 'Edward', 'who', 'somewhere', 'pining', 'point', 'probably', 'need', 'Valium.Some', 'relief', 'interminable', 'woe', 'Jacob', 'seizing', 'chance', 'Edward', 'picture', 'romance', 'Bella', 'sort', 'relationship', 'develops', 'only', 'friendship', 'love', 'Bella', 'kinds', 'idiotic', 'things', 'conjure', 'up', 'visual', 'hallucinations', 'Edward', 'including', 'throwing', 'off', 'cliff', 'when', 'improbably', 'Alice', 'Edward', 'Volturi', 'never', 'learn', 'exactly', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'represent', 'seem', 'be', 'kind', 'vampire', 'mafia', 'so', 'dejected', 'Bella', 'be', 'really', 'dead', 'instead', 'only', 'undead', 'So', 'Bella', 'rescue', 'film', 'improbable', 'conclusion', 'whole', 'film', 'improbable', 'begin', 'conclusion', 'fairly', 'reliable', 'outcome.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'Jacob', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'morphs', 'werewolf', 'Bella', 'attract', 'kinds', 'monsters', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'give', 'same', 'one-note', 'performances', 'Twilight', 'Jacob', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'probably', 'getting', 'decent', 'haircut', 'beefing', 'up', 'turned', 'caramel-colored', 'hunk', 'luscious', 'golden', 'skin', 'Pattinson', 'still', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'acting', 'abilities', 'still', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'fact', 'like', 'Cullens', 'Rosalie', 'who', 'less', 'tragic', 'character', 'more', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'pissed', 'off', 'brother', 'dating', 'girl', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Bella', 'dad', 'once', 'again', 'walks', 'whole', 'are', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'hunky', 'cute', 'guys', 'morphing', 'huge', 'wolves', 'real', 'violence', 'sex', 'speak', 'film', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'Only', 'most', 'ten', 'year', 'olds', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'over-tens', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'coma', 'watching', 'Bella', 'mooning', 'Edward', 'vice-versa', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'down', 'depression', 'built', 'up', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A

The introduction of werewolves to the story was a nice complication, though their relationship to the vampires was a little more complex and required more information than the audience was given to make sense.There were some very nice plot developments, though lots of dangling story lines.  What, for example, became of Victoria?  And there was apparently a whole lot of untold story about the Volturi (sp?) that I suspect would be very interesting to know.

1223957,ARK323I3EV98D,B001OQCV56,Jordan D. Wilson,"[1, 4]","I have tremendous sympathy for writer/director Chris Weitz. His first big project was American Pie, which he directed with his brother Paul Weitz, and which was quite funny and successful. The two brothers then went on to write Nutty Professor II, which was also funny, and About a Boy, which was the best project the two brothers ever directed and wrote together. However, once the brothers' split, and Chris Weitz went on to write and direct The Golden Compass, his true solo potential shined through. Unfortunately, critics largely dismissed it as a film ""reduced to impressive visuals overcompensating for lax storytelling.""Now comes The Twilight Saga: New Moon, Weitz's first directing job since his masterpiece The Golden Compass, and according to a recent interview, his penultimate job in Hollywood. It is a shame that such a talent has been reduced to such boring, poorly conceived material as this. It almost seems as if he is trying to catch his breath after the commercial and critical failure of The Golden Compass, and the tides of failure just keep overwhelming and drowning him.This being the second installment of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series, the romance between Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) becomes a liability following Bella's 18th birthday party, at which she is nearly attacked by one of the Cullen family vampires after she receives a paper cut. Cullen informs her that he must leave her, and she is left alone and heartbroken in the middle of the woods. She fights through various nightmares, which we never see, and finds that she can see Edward's spirit, or whatever it is, when she enhances her adrenaline.Bella soon turns to her good friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), in an attempt to focus her newfound need for adrenaline on riding fast on an old motorcycle. She and Jacob form a strong bond while fixing up the motorcycle, and she is introduced to the wolf pack. Jacob and his brothers are werewolves, and they are in a feud with vampires, who are trying to kill Bella. She eventually is meant to choose which guy she wants to be with, Edward or Jacob.The finest two points of the film are the opening sequence and the last third. The opening sequence depicts a dream Bella has involving herself entering the inevitable old age that Edward will never have to face. The final third includes the most entertaining performance of the film by Michael Sheen as Aro, the head of the Volturi, a powerful bureaucracy of vampires which enforces the laws of the vampire world. It is evident that he is having a lot of fun in this campy role, which is more than I can say for anyone else in the movie.The sequel to last year's teen-vampire hit Twilight is worse than its predecessor in many ways, including length, and although it looks significantly better, which I attribute to the new director who has experience with vast landscapes and fighting CGI animals, it still doesn't make up for the lack of story development and the horrendous acting. I felt no compassion or sympathy for any of these characters, simply because they lack the energy required to provoke such emotion. The bland, brooding nature of Bella, Jacob, and Edward all add up to a bland, overlong, and ultimately undercooked bit of eye-candy (Lautner and his wolf pack are shirtless for nearly the entire running length of the movie) for young teenaged girls.",1,"Looks Good, But That's About It",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,3396,"['have', 'tremendous', 'sympathy', 'writer/director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'first', 'big', 'project', 'was', 'American', 'Pie', 'directed', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'successful', 'two', 'brothers', 'then', 'went', 'write', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'II', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'Boy', 'was', 'best', 'project', 'two', 'brothers', 'ever', 'directed', 'wrote', 'together', 'However', 'once', 'brothers', 'split', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'went', 'write', 'direct', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'true', 'solo', 'potential', 'shined', 'Unfortunately', 'critics', 'largely', 'dismissed', 'film', 'reduced', 'impressive', 'visuals', 'overcompensating', 'lax', 'storytelling', 'Now', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon', 'Weitz', 'first', 'directing', 'job', 'masterpiece', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'according', 'recent', 'interview', 'penultimate', 'job', 'Hollywood', 'shame', 'talent', 'been', 'reduced', 'such', 'boring', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'material', 'almost', 'trying', 'catch', 'breath', 'commercial', 'critical', 'failure', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'tides', 'failure', 'just', 'keep', 'overwhelming', 'drowning', 'him.This', 'being', 'second', 'installment', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'Twilight', 'series', 'romance', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'liability', 'following', 'Bella', '18th', 'birthday', 'party', 'nearly', 'attacked', 'one', 'Cullen', 'family', 'vampires', 'paper', 'cut', 'Cullen', 'must', 'leave', 'left', 'alone', 'heartbroken', 'middle', 'woods', 'various', 'nightmares', 'never', 'see', 'can', 'see', 'Edward', 'spirit', 'whatever', 'when', 'adrenaline.Bella', 'soon', 'good', 'friend', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'attempt', 'focus', 'newfound', 'need', 'adrenaline', 'riding', 'fast', 'old', 'motorcycle', 'Jacob', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'fixing', 'up', 'motorcycle', 'introduced', 'wolf', 'pack', 'Jacob', 'brothers', 'are', 'werewolves', 'are', 'feud', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'Bella', 'eventually', 'meant', 'choose', 'guy', 'be', 'Edward', 'Jacob.The', 'finest', 'two', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'opening', 'sequence', 'last', 'third', 'opening', 'sequence', 'dream', 'Bella', 'involving', 'entering', 'inevitable', 'old', 'age', 'Edward', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'face', 'final', 'third', 'most', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'film', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Aro', 'head', 'Volturi', 'powerful', 'bureaucracy', 'vampires', 'laws', 'vampire', 'world', 'evident', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'campy', 'role', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie.The', 'sequel', 'last', 'year', 'teen-vampire', 'hit', 'Twilight', 'worse', 'predecessor', 'many', 'ways', 'including', 'length', 'significantly', 'better', 'attribute', 'new', 'director', 'who', 'experience', 'vast', 'landscapes', 'fighting', 'CGI', 'animals', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'story', 'development', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'felt', 'compassion', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'simply', 'lack', 'energy', 'required', 'provoke', 'such', 'emotion', 'bland', 'brooding', 'nature', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'Edward', 'add', 'up', 'bland', 'overlong', 'ultimately', 'undercooked', 'bit', 'eye-candy', 'Lautner', 'wolf', 'pack', 'are', 'shirtless', 'nearly', 'entire', 'running', 'length', 'movie', 'young', 'teenaged', 'girls']",N/A

1223959,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001OQCV56,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[10, 16]","The sequel to 2008's Twilight needs no introduction. The film has broken box-office records and the next film in the series is due in just a matter of months. Like it or not, the Twilight Saga is a cultural phenomenon in both film and book form. After seeing the first film, I was unable to grasp the appeal of this series and now, having seen New Moon I am still dumbfounded. In my review of Twilight, I wrote ""almost everything here is underwritten, characters and plot included"" and ""no one with a knowledge or appreciation of American cinema would call Twilight a good movie."" New Moon does flesh out the main characters a bit more but I stand by the latter statement. New Moon is certainly not a good film by any means.Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finds her relationship with vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) strained as her birthday passes along with the realization that she'll be growing older while he stays the same age. After Edward announces to Bella that he and his family are leaving Forks, Bella sinks into a depression while growing closer to Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who has a ""surprise"" himself. I'm not spoiling anything for anyone by saying Jacob Black is a werewolf, which I guess is supposed to create an interesting, mythical love triangle.Teenage girls have raved about Twilight as being Romeo & Juliet for the 21st Century and New Moon makes no attempt to hide that parallel. There are direct references to the famous Shakespeare work throughout the movie; a mistake, as it reminds the audience of a much more poignant love story.The first film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who had previously made a film about teenagers called Thirteen. On New Moon, she's replaced by Chris Weitz who also previously directed a film about teenagers called American Pie. I was surprised to see that Weitz handles the material better than Hardwicke did, but this isn't a case of a director turning water into wine. No director could with this story.How can a ""love story"" be told without charm, poignancy, or intelligence? It's a teenage love story, yes, so one must expect the characters to be overdramatic and/or nave but what separates these characters from others in teen love stories is that these characters are caricatures and `overdramatic' skates dangerously close to psychotic. After Edward leaves Bella, her reaction is like that of a P.O.W. returning from Vietnam. Most parents would commit their teenage daughter for reacting the way Bella does and they'd be right to do so.Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg has made no effort to improve upon the melodramatic dialogue between Edward and Bella, which weakens the film significantly. I felt nauseous watching the two speak to each other in the first film and now Bella gets to chat the same way with other characters. The banter is nothing but clich&eacute;d, repetitive drivel. ""Bella, you give me everything just by breathing"" and constant assurances of ""I don't want you to get hurt"" seem both forced and familiar. I'd like to see how the dialogue would sound if its writer wasn't trying to obviously to be clever. If that isn't bad enough, the fact that Pattinson doesn't even seem to be trying to play Edward should be. Once again, Pattinson spends the small amount of screen time he has trying to look brooding. As Edward, Pattinson is never convincing and usually just looks nauseous...Who can blame him with some of the lines he is given?There were aspects of New Moon that surprised me. Stewart and Lautner have more chemistry than Stewart and Pattinson and there are a few scenes between the two that offer a hint of credibility which, alas never lasts very long. New Moon also has the terrific Michael Sheen in the small role of Aro, an elder of an Italian clan of vampires called the Volturi. Sheen manages to wade through the material unscathed and actually giving one of the films's only acting performances. Lautner prances around with his shirt off through almost the entire film, while Stewart complains about her life, and Pattinson tries not to vomit. I can't write this without mentioning the special effects though. For a movie that is guaranteed to tear the box-office apart, you'd think the studio could spend a little extra on special effects. The werewolves in the film look like distant cousins of Scooby-Doo from the live action films.Despite my efforts, I can't find much to like about this series and I certainly can't find the appeal. There is no intrigue, no suspense, and no emotion that feels real. The characters are completely overdramatic and illogical, which is clearly why the story hits so close to home with teenage girls, but beyond that...There's nothing. Both films have left me emotionally unfulfilled and a little more mentally handicapped than when I started watching them. The ""cliffhanger"" at the end of the film made me laugh though. Not the ending itself, but the realization that I didn't care to know where the story would go from there. The pointlessness of telling this story is summed up for me with one brief scene towards the end of the film. Edward asks Bella to wait five years for him to change her into a vampire, to which she replies ""too long."" If five years is ""too long,"" how exactly is Bella intending to handle eternity?The final song that plays over the credits is ""Meet Me on the Equinox"" by Death Cab for Cutie, which is the best thing to come from this film in my opinion. The chorus is simply ""Everything, everything ends."" This is the most profound line you will find watching New Moon from the beginning to the end of the credits. Everything does, in fact, end...And one day, not far away from now, so will the popularity of this series and anyone being under the impression that it's worth their time.GRADE: D+",2,"An Honest,

The release of ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" to theaters created an even greater feeding frenzy (as it were) regarding the books, merchandise or anything else remotely related to Twilight than its predecessor had managed to cultivate. With all of the pandemonium surrounding this film's release to theaters in late 2009, and its subsequent release a few weeks ago on DVD and Blu-ray, I was left wondering, ""Does this latest installment really live up to all the fuss?""""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" finds Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) romance running into trouble after a mishap leaves Bella injured and one of Edward's vampire brethren in a momentary bloodlust. Fearing for her safety Edward exiles himself from Bella's life, vowing never to return. As Bella struggles to cope with the loss of her love, she begins to find solace by testing fate in dangerous and deadly ways. Not wishing to see Bella injure herself over the memory of some vampire, Bella's friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) steps up his attempts to woo her to his side. However, the timing for Jacob couldn't be worse as he is undergoing a supernatural metamorphosis of his own that will unleash the animal within.From the viewpoint of a person who found very little enjoyment from the original movie, I had little expectations that the sequel would prove to be much better. My wife told me that she felt I would probably like this movie a little bit more than the previous one, but she wasn't sure how much. Truth be told, she was right. I did like this one just a little bit more than its predecessor, but not by a whole lot.What makes this entry work a little better than the original? Well let's look at the first one's primary weaknesses. The first film was comprised of an incredibly weak storyline, wooden acting from most of the cast, amateurish dialogue, and barely TV worthy visual effects work. All of this left me with maybe ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyment in the movie. In essence, it shouldn't take too much to make a slightly better movie than what has come before.For the sequel, we are given a somewhat more interesting storyline, written once again by Michelle Rosenberg and based on the novel by author Stephanie Meyer. The story focuses upon a different side of the supernatural world, namely werewolves, which inhabit the area surrounding the city of Forks. There were times where this aspect provided some interesting moments and one could almost forget all the sappy clich&eacute;s that consume the rest of the movie, but these moments were few and far between. Generally speaking it was the same old teenage angst angles being played out like any number of the CW Network's TV shows or the previous movie for that matter.Bella and Edward's story takes a bit of a backseat, which thankfully lessens some of the cheesy romance that dominated the previous film. Instead, replacing their nauseating romance is a bunch of scenes showing Bella screaming in the middle of the night. Apparently this is caused by the heartache of losing Edward being so horrendous that it manifests as an almost physical pain. Although that was never truly addressed in the movie, but I'm told it is in the novel.Plus, there are a plethora of scenes showcasing Bella's new daredevil side that she's embraced whole-heartedly, because it's the only way she feels close to her beloved. Her entire story arc is so ridiculous that I actually felt a semblance of the apparent pain Bella was feeling, because while watching her scenes unfold I felt like I was being tortured.To be honest, the only aspect of the story that really sustained my interest was when the Volturi (the elite of the vampire world) arrive on the scene. While only featured briefly, their scenes were the most dramatically engaging, filled with mystery, and an underlying malevolence that left me curious as to what all they had in store for future installments.Sadly, even during the film's strongest points, the screenplay runs into issues. Once again Melissa Rosenberg is guilty of not divulging enough detail from the books in order for those in the audience that haven't read the novels to fully understand the how and why of what's occurring. For a movie to truly work, at least for the non-readers, the story must not rely on inside information gleamed from the novels; instead, this information needs to be presented in the film's story. However, I'm fully aware that I am not the target audience; the predominantly female readership is, so I doubt this issue will ever see resolution. But, I digress.The cast for the film performed almost completely as I had expected. Robert Pattinson is as wooden as ever in his continuing quest to usurp Hayden Christensen from the throne of worst actor ever. Robert's lines are delivered so lethargically that one wouldn't be surprised if it turned out he had been reading off cue cards. I know Edward is a vampire, meaning he's a member of the undead, but he claims to love Bella (meaning he clearly still feels emotions), so one would expect him to react with some semblance of an emotional range. However, one would be wrong in this expectation and I don't believe this is a result of a poor script. I believe that Robert Pattinson couldn't act with any truly convincing range if his career depended on it, which it apparently doesn't, so he has nothing to fear there.Actress Kristen Stewart turns in a similar performance to her previous attempt; except this time she includes many overwrought and unbelievable scenes of agony and heartbreak. Her acting wavered between slightly unenthusiastic and just downright bored (except when screaming, then she was enthused), which could almost be considered a step up from her previous performance. Once more for such a high-profile role, I'm surprised by her apparent lack of interest in the character. If she is acting this way based on some cue from the books regarding Bella's personality, then perhaps that should be addressed somehow in the movies. Otherwise she just appears to be handing in another terrible performance.Then we have Taylor Lautner rising up from the ranks of barely utilized supporting cast member to third lead in the movie. His performance is the most consistent amongst the primary players, but even then, he's not delivering anything really worthy of note. His character's bogged down with as much angst and weak dialogue as the other two (Kristen and Robert), except Taylor does his level best to overcome these short-comings. His was a commendable effort to be sure, but one that was destined to fail from the get-go.Lastly, in the minor supporting roles, the same two actors manage to outshine the other cast members, despite their minimal screen time. Billy Burke continues to provide some of the best moments and cheese-free lines of dialogue out of the entire cast. Just as before, whenever Billy's character appeared in the movie, those tended to be the most enjoyable scenes. Which is quite sad considering his total time in the movie is maybe ten minutes. As for the other reliable member of the cast, Peter Facinelli in the relatively thankless role as surrogate father to the Cullen ""family"" of vampires. This time however, he's relegated to next to nothing in terms of screen time, but he does the best he can with what little he's allotted.Now, on to the primary reason for which my wife thought I might enjoy this installment more than ""Twilight""... the werewolves. The inclusion of the werewolves into the story brought more action into the mix, along with even more visual effects (both elements were sorely lacking in both quantity and quality in the previous film). While the action scenes in this film were fairly entertaining, they were marred by sub-par CGI which detracted from them every step of the way. Most likely the core fan base for these movies doesn't really care too much about the visual effects work for their beloved characters. To me there's no excuse for such a weak effort to ever be put on display from a major Hollywood production.This film was released in the same year as ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""Avatar"", both CGI-intensive movies and for this one to come out with such a weak offering is unacceptable. Obviously the ""Twilight"" movies have made a lot of money and will continue to do so, meaning the budget shouldn't be an issue. What it boils down to is this, in this day and age, CGI characters can look incredibly realistic, but if done wrong they will stand out like a sore thumb. In the end, Summit Entertainment needs to provide a bigger budget for the remaining films. Especially if they plan to use the werewolves or any other CGI-created characters in the later installments, otherwise the end result will be just as inferior as it was in this movie.Finally, to address the question I posed at the beginning, does this movie live up to the fuss? In my estimation, even though this entry was slightly better than its predecessor, I would still have to answer with a resounding ""No!"" However, I must say again, that I am not the target audience for this franchise. So, based on my wife and daughter's undeniable enjoyment of the movie; I would have to say that if you are a fan of the previous movie or the books, then this installment will definitely entertain you and leave you thirsting for more.""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",2,Barely an Improvement Over the Original...,1270252800,"04 3,

This movie was more a dreadful teenage chick flick and less a good vampire story. What in the world makes Bella and Edwards' love so special and sacred anyway?, that the entire movie revolves around this idea?... sickening!I am in no way Anti-Twilight and really enjoyed the first movie even though it was also geared toward the teenage crowd. The first movie was a refreshing change from the stereotypical vampire movie and had some comical scenes. But this movie was really a let down and had some terrible computer animation. It was obviously geared towards the teenage girl crowd... making it repulsive and insulting to the adult with an above average intelligence. The story really dragged out and lacked any humor levity.Some scenes were redeeming, while others were sooo terrible I wanted to tear my eyeballs out than continue watching. Almost half of the scenes had a young buff actor without his shirt on...being a guy, I really didn't need to see this. If they are going to show half naked adolescent men the whole time, why didn't they show more skin from Bella (Kristen Stewart)?Example of a bad scene: Edward is introduced into the movie walking in slow mo.. this made me want to vomit and toss the DVD out the window.Example of good scene: Vampire Edward and another vamp battling it out towards the end of the movie.In the movie there is a treaty between the vampires and werewolves. The story would have been better if they had broken the treaty and had a full blooded war, least this would have given the movie a chance to have some interesting action scenes, rather than watching Bella pout for 2 hours and have boring dialogue with Jacob (the 17 year old steroid addict). The feeling I got from this movie was ""So what if everyone is a supernatural creature, we should all get along and be one happy family including humans"" - lame.. lame... Lame!I think that if Jacob (a werewolf) was a real dog, and would have given Bella what she needed - doggie style... she wouldn't be such an overemotional melodramatic neurotic freak.  :DPros:-Good fight sequences, decent soundtrack.-Introducing new supernatural creature - werewolfUmmm.... Can't think of any other.Cons:-More a lame love story than a good vampire flick.-Horrific acting by minor role characters.-Cheesy dialogue (everyone says exactly what they feel)- Way too touchy feely for a vampire story-Very little suspense-Pathetic computer animated werewolf - (by the way, when does a werewolf ever actually just look like a wolf, instead of a monster?)-supernatural creatures stray from legends completely - (Werewolves turn whenever they feel like it, and vampires sparkle in sunlight - how freaking stupid is this?)-Slow moving plot-Way too much male meat that a straight guy can stand to endure.-no humor throughout entire movie-movie geared towards the teenage girl crowd... repulsive and insulting to the adult with an above average intelligence.I think I just made middle school girls angry everywhere with my review... lol",2,A Steaming Pile of Werewolf Excrement,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3074,"['swear', 'teenage', 'girl', 'wrote', 'story', 'twin', 'sister', 'directed', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'dreadful', 'teenage', 'chick', 'flick', 'less', 'good', 'vampire', 'story', 'What', 'world', 'Bella', 'Edwards', 'love', 'so', 'special', 'sacred', 'anyway', 'entire', 'movie', 'idea', 'sickening', 'am', 'way', 'Anti-Twilight', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'was', 'also', 'geared', 'teenage', 'crowd', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'stereotypical', 'vampire', 'movie', 'had', 'comical', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'had', 'terrible', 'computer', 'animation', 'was', 'obviously', 'geared', 'teenage', 'girl', 'crowd', 'making', 'repulsive', 'insulting', 'adult', 'above', 'average', 'intelligence', 'story', 'really', 'dragged', 'out', 'lacked', 'humor', 'levity.Some', 'scenes', 'were', 'redeeming', 'others', 'were', 'sooo', 'terrible', 'wanted', 'tear', 'eyeballs', 'out', 'continue', 'watching', 'Almost', 'half', 'scenes', 'had', 'young', 'buff', 'actor', 'shirt', 'being', 'guy', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'are', 'going', 'show', 'half', 'naked', 'adolescent', 'men', 'whole', 'time', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'more', 'skin', 'Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Example', 'bad', 'scene', 'Edward', 'introduced', 'movie', 'walking', 'slow', 'mo..', 'made', 'want', 'vomit', 'toss', 'DVD', 'window.Example', 'good', 'scene', 'Vampire', 'Edward', 'vamp', 'battling', 'end', 'movie.In', 'movie', 'treaty', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'broken', 'treaty', 'had', 'full', 'blooded', 'war', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'chance', 'have', 'interesting', 'action', 'scenes', 'rather', 'watching', 'Bella', 'pout', '2', 'hours', 'have', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'Jacob', '17', 'year', 'old', 'steroid', 'addict', 'feeling', 'got', 'movie', 'was', 'So', 'what', 'everyone', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'should', 'get', 'be', 'one', 'happy', 'family', 'including', 'humans', 'lame..', 'lame', 'Lame', 'think', 'Jacob', 'werewolf', 'was', 'real', 'dog', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Bella', 'what', 'needed', 'doggie', 'style', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'overemotional', 'melodramatic', 'neurotic', 'freak', 'DPros', '-Good', 'fight', 'sequences', 'decent', 'soundtrack.-Introducing', 'new', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'werewolfUmmm', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other.Cons', '-More', 'lame', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'vampire', 'flick.-Horrific', 'acting', 'minor', 'role', 'characters.-Cheesy', 'dialogue', 'everyone', 'exactly', 'what', 'feel', 'Way', 'too', 'feely', 'vampire', 'story-Very', 'little', 'suspense-Pathetic', 'computer', 'animated', 'werewolf', 'way', 'when', 'werewolf', 'ever', 'actually', 'just', 'look', 'wolf', 'instead', 'monster', '-supernatural', 'creatures', 'stray', 'legends', 'completely', 'turn', 'whenever', 'feel', 'vampires', 'sparkle', 'sunlight', 'how', 'freaking', 'stupid', 'moving', 'plot-Way', 'too', 'much', 'male', 'meat', 'straight', 'guy', 'can', 'stand', 'endure.-no', 'humor', 'entire', 'movie-movie', 'geared', 'teenage', 'girl', 'crowd', 'repulsive', 'insulting', 'adult', 'above', 'average', 'intelligence.I', 'think', 'just', 'made', 'middle', 'school', 'girls', 'angry', 'everywhere', 'review', 'lol']",N/A

I did see the first Twilight movie in the theaters.The movie lasted about 2 hours and it was very good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story of the couple continues and the Native American young man also has a major role.  Computer visual graphics are great as we see wherewolves change instantaneously in the film.  As before, we also have good vampires and bad vampires. The Cullen vampire family also appears in this film.The story begins with the young vampire's girlfriend asking him repeatedly to ""change"" her so she can be with him on his level.  Because of his love for her, he wants to spare her that lifestyle and decides to break up with her.  Of course, he is never really far.Like the first Twilight, this is a love story and a story about some good people who just happen to be vampires and a young girl who doesn't care that her love is a little pale in the sunlight.  If you want to see shock value, go see another movie.  I am pleased to say this is NOT a gory, rip-em-apart movie.On a side note, the young Native American man from the first film has beefed up and has a real nice bod now.  There is a scene in this movie where he pulls his shirt off.

1223988,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B001OQCV56,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[29, 52]","My wife is a die-hard fan of the ""Twilight"" series, and I am not. Both of us came away from this film disappointed for different reasons. While my wife liked the fact that the film stayed close to the movie plot (except the very end), we were both less than impressed with the unidimensional acting, ultra-cheesy script, and very slow pacing.As one who has not read the Twilight series, I can certainly say that as a stand-alone film, this movie is lackluster at best. For starters, Kristen Stewart is one of the most uni-dimensional actresses I've seen in a long while, seemingly capable of little more than looking confused all the time in every scene. My wife tells me that while the character of Bella is supposed to have some inner-conflict, Stewart plays the role in a way that makes Bella come off as an ultra-awkward deer in a headlight. And quite literally, she does not vary this in any scene, which makes for a bad performance. (Without going into detail, the actor who plays Jacob fares little better, sounding often like a young monotone Keanu Reeves.)As for the script, there were several of us in the theater who laughed out loud at some of the many ultra-cliche or otherwise awkward lines that make up the dialogue in this film. Here are just a few:Bella: ""It must be nice to never get cold.""Jacob: ""It's a wolf thing!""""You're hot!"" (when Bella feels the warmth of Jacob's skin.)""Giving you up is the hardest thing I've done in 100 years."" (what Edward says to Bella).By now, you get the point. The dialogue is only made worse by the very unidimensional performance the actors give.The only thing this film really had going for it (besides the fact that it ties in with a very popular book) is the action sequences in the middle and end, which I thought were half decent. (Of course, that may well be beause the rest of the film is lacking.)As my wife says: it is a shame that such a good and well-written book has been made into such a thiin, poorly done film.I couldn't agree more.",1,"Even If You're a Diehard Fan, This Movie Disappoints!",1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1999,"['wife', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'came', 'away', 'film', 'disappointed', 'different', 'reasons', 'wife', 'liked', 'fact', 'film', 'stayed', 'close', 'movie', 'plot', 'very', 'end', 'were', 'less', 'impressed', 'unidimensional', 'acting', 'ultra-cheesy', 'script', 'very', 'slow', 'pacing.As', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'Twilight', 'series', 'can', 'certainly', 'say', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'movie', 'lackluster', 'best', 'starters', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'one', 'most', 'uni-dimensional', 'actresses', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'seemingly', 'capable', 'little', 'more', 'looking', 'confused', 'time', 'scene', 'wife', 'tells', 'character', 'Bella', 'supposed', 'have', 'inner-conflict', 'Stewart', 'role', 'way', 'Bella', 'come', 'off', 'ultra-awkward', 'deer', 'headlight', 'quite', 'literally', 'not', 'vary', 'scene', 'bad', 'performance', 'going', 'detail', 'actor', 'who', 'Jacob', 'little', 'better', 'sounding', 'often', 'young', 'monotone', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'script', 'were', 'several', 'theater', 'who', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'ultra-cliche', 'otherwise', 'awkward', 'lines', 'make', 'up', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'Bella', 'must', 'be', 'nice', 'never', 'get', 'cold', 'Jacob', 'wolf', 'thing', ""'re"", 'hot', 'when', 'Bella', 'warmth', 'Jacob', 'skin', 'Giving', 'up', 'hardest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'done', '100', 'years', 'what', 'Edward', 'Bella', '.By', 'now', 'get', 'point', 'dialogue', 'only', 'made', 'worse', 'very', 'unidimensional', 'performance', 'actors', 'give.The', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'really', 'had', 'going', 'fact', 'very', 'popular', 'book', 'action', 'sequences', 'middle', 'end', 'thought', 'were', 'half', 'decent', 'course', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'rest', 'film', 'lacking', 'wife', 'shame', 'good', 'well-written', 'book', 'been', 'made', 'such', 'thiin', 'poorly', 'done', 'film.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more']",N/A

I was in junior high once, and a lot of the dialog resembled what I remembered hearing btwn boyfriends and girlfriends. You know, back in the day when you had a major crush and they were the love of your life? Then 3 weeks later, you BOTH move on to another ""love of your life."" That's how the dialog sounds. It's cheesy, overdone, and I feel sorry for the teens who thinks this is what it should be. Edward and Bella have an obsessive and codependent relationship. Dumped by a vampire so you're feeling suicidal? Really? If you take out the vampire stuff, everything else is still wrong. Bella is a mopey, emotionless, humorless, goalless, utterly empty of personality shell of a girl. It's really hard to understand why either of these guys find her attractive. What does she do? For herself or anybody? She's a major drag and she treats her dad like crap.  It's just not credible that two guys are willing to die (one again) for her.  She offers nothing in return. She gets dumped by Ed and just eats up the attention Jacob pays her w/no intention of ever reciprocating his feelings. We call that leading. Everything is about her to the max. What I found particularly amusing is that she asks Jacob if he could just STOP being a wolf...yet this same girl would never ask that of Edward. It makes no sense. Lautner did the best acting of the three, and made me feel for Jake.  I read the Wiki page for the Breaking Dawn book and the outcome for his character sounds like a movie recipe for disaster. At this point, producers need to stop leading the little girls on. He honestly saved the movie. As an adult, I can only handle so much teen angst and the fact that he cracked a few smiles kept me from turning it off.When the werewolf first emerged from the woods before chasing Victoria, OK yes, I thought it was a bear. But even still, the werewolf scenes were the best parts. The vamp makeup was terrible and the contacts were distracting.  Pattinson was better in the first movie. Stewart was the same non-entity.  She was so unrelatable. Even if not in the dialog, mannerisms, facial expressions, and actions can convey so much about a character. It's hard to believe that Bella is not a robot. Even on the dvd cover, she just doesn't try. Compared to both male leads.  Actors should be able to sell their characters' motivations. Stanley in `Streetcar' was utterly reprehensible, but Brando sold it. Stewart does not, and therefore Bella comes off as one of the most undeserving ""heroines"" to ever hit the screen.Ugh, I'm gonna stop here.",2,Lacks credibility,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,2870,"['problem', 'w/New', 'Moon', 'too', 'seriously', 'giving', 'audience', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'consider', 'joke.I', 'try', 'not', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'movies', 'believe', 'individuals', 'are', 'responsible', 'own', 'actions', 'agree', 'movie', 'influence', 'young', 'girls', 'yep', 'older', 'women', 'well', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'once', 'lot', 'dialog', 'resembled', 'what', 'remembered', 'hearing', 'btwn', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'know', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'had', 'major', 'crush', 'were', 'love', 'life', 'Then', '3', 'weeks', 'later', 'BOTH', 'move', 'love', 'life', 'how', 'dialog', 'cheesy', 'overdone', 'feel', 'sorry', 'teens', 'who', 'thinks', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'have', 'obsessive', 'codependent', 'relationship', 'Dumped', 'vampire', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'suicidal', 'Really', 'take', 'out', 'vampire', 'stuff', 'everything', 'else', 'still', 'wrong', 'Bella', 'mopey', 'emotionless', 'humorless', 'goalless', 'utterly', 'empty', 'personality', 'shell', 'girl', 'really', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'guys', 'find', 'attractive', 'What', 'do', 'anybody', 'major', 'drag', 'dad', 'crap', 'just', 'not', 'credible', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'willing', 'die', 'one', 'again', 'nothing', 'return', 'dumped', 'Ed', 'just', 'eats', 'up', 'attention', 'Jacob', 'w/no', 'intention', 'ever', 'reciprocating', 'feelings', 'call', 'leading', 'Everything', 'max', 'What', 'found', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'Jacob', 'could', 'just', 'STOP', 'being', 'wolf', 'yet', 'same', 'girl', 'would', 'never', 'ask', 'Edward', 'sense', 'Lautner', 'did', 'best', 'acting', 'three', 'made', 'feel', 'Jake', 'read', 'Wiki', 'page', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'book', 'outcome', 'character', 'movie', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'point', 'producers', 'need', 'stop', 'leading', 'little', 'girls', 'honestly', 'saved', 'movie', 'adult', 'can', 'only', 'handle', 'so', 'much', 'teen', 'angst', 'fact', 'cracked', 'few', 'smiles', 'kept', 'turning', 'werewolf', 'first', 'emerged', 'woods', 'chasing', 'Victoria', 'OK', 'yes', 'thought', 'was', 'bear', 'even', 'still', 'werewolf', 'scenes', 'were', 'best', 'parts', 'vamp', 'makeup', 'was', 'terrible', 'contacts', 'were', 'distracting', 'Pattinson', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'movie', 'Stewart', 'was', 'same', 'non-entity', 'was', 'so', 'unrelatable', 'Even', 'not', 'dialog', 'mannerisms', 'facial', 'expressions', 'actions', 'can', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bella', 'not', 'robot', 'Even', 'dvd', 'cover', 'just', ""n't"", 'try', 'Compared', 'male', 'leads', 'Actors', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'characters', 'motivations', 'Stanley', 'Streetcar', 'was', 'utterly', 'reprehensible', 'Brando', 'sold', 'Stewart', 'not', 'therefore', 'Bella', 'off', 'one', 'most', 'undeserving', 'heroines', 'ever', 'hit', 'screen.Ugh', ""'m"", 'gon', 'stop', 'here']",N/A

A story about how Twilight II changed my outlook on life. (sounds cheesy but im not joking lol)I remember when I saw Twilight one with my GF. I was like 'this is okay, and I like the bit at the start where they played Full moon by the Black Ghosts because I like that song lol'. I'm pretty sure thatk the whole 'romantic' notion of vamps being romantic is exclusive to chicks, because it seems a bit silly to me. Truth be told i cant really remember it. I remember they met his family and had a fight in a church. me and her split up so I never thought of Twilight one for a long time. I was devestated not to think of it.But I saw this film by accident at the cinema ages ago and knew I had to order the DVD off of amazon.com when it came out on DVD.The cover says it all really...Im looking at it now. RoPatz and Stewie stare right out at you from the confines of 2d paper, staring right at you, their desire for eachother and imminent life together apparent in their eyes. Behind them, the cloudy yellow skies and Jacobs the werewolf fester moodily. In front of them, tiny hooded men walk past some sort of clock tower. Brilliant cover, really. So many secrets to be revealed, so many desires to be fulfilled.I am the most unlikely purveyor of fanged romance teen-flicks. But this film moved me in ways I dont want to think about. It is a vast step up from Twilight one, a step in the right direction without a doubt. The love of the two leads intensifies, and all the actors seem comfortable and more fluid with one another.It changed the way I think about life because the romance from Robert Patterson and Bella is so fragile that it makes me thank my lucky stars that I got it so easy.

Of course a lot of money was spent on New Moon, the director showed more accuracy in special effects and so on but on the emotional level the film failed miserably.  By the way, those weird vampire eyes that holler ""I am not human"" render the whole concept of the Cullen family blending in with the mortals, absurd.Everyone has seen the film, read the book or at least is aware of the premise.  I would like to compare the portrayal of the characters in Twilight and ""New Moon"" in an attempt to show that it takes a male director with a deeper understanding of teenage love and passion to successfully depict this in his films and make the audience feel the sexual tension right along their spinal cord like an electrical charge.  I confess to not being a fan of the books and read them to see what it is that teenagers find so appealing in them.  I escorted my young daughter to the cinema to see both films.  The characters in Twilight were teenagers other young people could easily identify with.  Bella was an unusual teenager but her insecurities rang true, her lack of self confidence was in a way appealing and her fragility explained why the boys felt protective towards her.  In New Moon she comes across as a nervous wreck, moody and unpredictable, uncaring for others and  obsessed with her own little drama.  She is brooding and jumpy, as if she were in dire need of therapy, which she is, considering her reckless behaviour.  The director does nothing to atone for all these abhorrent aspects of her character  which if seen from an objective perspective, are to be condemned and certainly not admired. Her attitude towards her friends at school, Jacob and her father is despicable and that is putting it mildly. It makes one wonder what it is that makes the boys love her so as there is little she does to warrant such feelings.  She exhibits a very superficial level of love and her  dismissive attitude to 'giving away' her soul was irritating.  It simply emphasizes the fact that she is shallow and puerile, thinking only of the veneer of her outer appearance, doing nothing to improve that inner being which remains eternal. I suppose the book was more or less along the same lines, Staphanie Meyers not being willing to delve into the deeper waters of literature to unravel the intricacies of the human psyche, and the director was content to leave it at that.Edward.  In Twilight he was warm, playful with a sense of humour although torn by his conflicting emotions.  The director brought out different facets of his character not making him one dimentional, like the characters in New Moon. He had warmth as well as pain in his eyes when he looked at Bella and when he told Bella how long he had waited for her I felt his yearning in my solar plexus which remained inactivated in New Moon.  There were no such moments of playfulness, longing, endearment and generally the type of emotions conveyed by a touch, look or soul shattering kiss. In New Moon Edward wore a perpetual frown which was unfair to him as I believe he is a promising young actor who should explore his acting talents by accepting more challenging roles than this.  Anyway, I yawned through most of it but my daughter was content and so were the rest of the teenagers by the sounds of their sighs and screeches.  As for the adults that accompanied them, they shared feelings similar to mine, the drowsiness I spotted in their eyes being a telltale sign.",2,Snoozed through parts of it,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,3608,"['will', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'well', 'fans', 'found', 'film', 'utterly', 'boring', 'Edward', 'totally', 'lacking', 'endearing', 'quality', 'had', 'Twilight', 'film', 'course', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'New', 'Moon', 'director', 'showed', 'more', 'accuracy', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'emotional', 'level', 'film', 'failed', 'miserably', 'way', 'weird', 'vampire', 'eyes', 'holler', 'am', 'not', 'human', 'render', 'whole', 'concept', 'Cullen', 'family', 'blending', 'mortals', 'absurd.Everyone', 'seen', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'least', 'aware', 'premise', 'would', 'like', 'compare', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'Twilight', 'New', 'Moon', 'attempt', 'show', 'male', 'director', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'teenage', 'love', 'passion', 'successfully', 'depict', 'films', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'sexual', 'tension', 'right', 'spinal', 'cord', 'electrical', 'charge', 'confess', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'books', 'read', 'see', 'what', 'teenagers', 'find', 'so', 'appealing', 'escorted', 'young', 'daughter', 'cinema', 'see', 'films', 'characters', 'Twilight', 'were', 'teenagers', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'could', 'easily', 'identify', 'Bella', 'was', 'unusual', 'teenager', 'insecurities', 'rang', 'true', 'lack', 'self', 'confidence', 'was', 'way', 'appealing', 'fragility', 'explained', 'why', 'boys', 'felt', 'protective', 'New', 'Moon', 'across', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'moody', 'unpredictable', 'uncaring', 'others', 'obsessed', 'own', 'little', 'drama', 'brooding', 'jumpy', 'were', 'dire', 'need', 'therapy', 'considering', 'reckless', 'behaviour', 'director', 'nothing', 'atone', 'abhorrent', 'aspects', 'character', 'seen', 'objective', 'perspective', 'are', 'be', 'condemned', 'certainly', 'not', 'admired', 'attitude', 'friends', 'school', 'Jacob', 'father', 'despicable', 'putting', 'mildly', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'boys', 'love', 'so', 'little', 'warrant', 'such', 'feelings', 'very', 'superficial', 'level', 'love', 'dismissive', 'attitude', ""'giving"", 'away', 'soul', 'was', 'irritating', 'simply', 'fact', 'shallow', 'puerile', 'thinking', 'only', 'veneer', 'outer', 'appearance', 'doing', 'nothing', 'improve', 'inner', 'being', 'eternal', 'suppose', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'lines', 'Staphanie', 'Meyers', 'not', 'being', 'willing', 'delve', 'deeper', 'waters', 'literature', 'unravel', 'intricacies', 'human', 'psyche', 'director', 'was', 'content', 'leave', 'that.Edward', 'Twilight', 'was', 'warm', 'playful', 'sense', 'humour', 'torn', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'director', 'brought', 'out', 'different', 'facets', 'character', 'not', 'making', 'one', 'dimentional', 'characters', 'New', 'Moon', 'had', 'warmth', 'as', 'well', 'pain', 'eyes', 'when', 'looked', 'Bella', 'when', 'told', 'Bella', 'how', 'long', 'had', 'waited', 'felt', 'yearning', 'solar', 'plexus', 'remained', 'inactivated', 'New', 'Moon', 'were', 'such', 'moments', 'playfulness', 'longing', 'endearment', 'generally', 'type', 'emotions', 'conveyed', 'touch', 'look', 'soul', 'shattering', 'kiss', 'New', 'Moon', 'Edward', 'wore', 'perpetual', 'frown', 'was', 'unfair', 'believe', 'promising', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'should', 'explore', 'acting', 'talents', 'accepting', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'Anyway', 'yawned', 'most', 'daughter', 'was', 'content', 'so', 'were', 'rest', 'teenagers', 'sounds', 'sighs', 'screeches', 'adults', 'accompanied', 'shared', 'feelings', 'similar', 'mine', 'drowsiness', 'spotted', 'eyes', 'being', 'telltale', 'sign']",N/A

I'm a fan of the ""Twilight"" series and have read all the books. While I think the basic vampire love story is fantastic, I also think Stephenie Meyer is a god-awful writer whose books are difficult to get through without cringing. ""New Moon"" is my least favorite book of the series because it's all about Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, and there's too much history and backstory on the werewolves, etc. (As you can see, I am on Team Edward.)However, the film version does a great job of stripping down all the excess boring garbage from the book and concentrating on the characters. In the movie, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is devastated when her bloodsucking boyfriend, Edward (Robert Pattinson), abandons her for no apparent reason. In reality, Edward is trying to protect Bella by staying as far away from her as possible, but she doesn't realize that and becomes incredibly depressed. Fortunately for her, Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is still around, and he manages to help take Bella's mind off Edward, at least for a bit. However, Jacob has some crazy secrets of his own, and of course Bella's life is in danger again, which leads to a dramatic confrontation with Edward and some powerful vampires in Italy.I really enjoyed this movie. The pacing of the film is much faster than the book, and the character development is much better than the first ""Twilight"" film. The addition of the Volturi really intensified the film, and Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning give outstanding but brief performances as deviled-eyed vampire leaders. However, my favorite thing about ""New Moon"" was listening to the females in the audience randing from ages nine to 95 hooting, hollering, and literally GROWLING whenever Lautner appeared on screen. I've never seen anything like that, and it was hilarious!Brave the crowds and go see ""New Moon"" in the theatre.

She finally syarts keeping the company of Jake. They build motorcycles and become close. Much to her horror Bella discovers that Jake and hisfour friends are werewolves. A very scary group. Jake and his werewolf accomplices are hunting and killing vampires. Bella is nearly killed by one of Jake's sidekicks. An evil influence from the first movie Veronica the redheaded vampire has returned to the area to kill Bella. This is retaliation for Edward killing her vampire mate. Another of Veronica's vampire shows up to kill Bella and is torn to shreds by the werewolves. Edward and Bella are reunited. They return to the local area.

However, whenTwilight [Blu-ray] came to film I had to see it.  I loved the movie.  Seeing Edward and Bella on screen made all the difference with putting faces to the characters.  I know there are plenty of people out there who hate these films and books.  That's fine, we can't all be alike.When New Moon's previews started showing on TV I didn't know how I was going to wait to see this movie.  LikeTwilight [Blu-ray] I saw it in the theater and let me say one word...WOW.  I am very pleased that the movie followed the book so closely.  Unlike the Harry Potter films of the larger books, where they cut out way too much.Kristen Stewart is the perfect Bella.  She plays the part of her clumsly, dramatic self excellent.  Edward, well he's just hot.  However, Robert Pattinson has a way of talking and crinkling his eyebrows with his little smile that is just so Edward.  If you've not read the books, read them, you'll understand what I'm saying.I thought the wovles were really good, I enjoyed how they shift on the fly to wolf form.  I was shocked to see how big they were, I didn't realize they were that big in the books.  Again, following the book is a good thing here.If you aren't familar with the vampires of Twilight, please please don't expect to see fangs and blood.  These are a different vampire, they sparkle when in the sunlight (yes, this took me along time to accept) and they have no fangs.  I wish there were fangs in the Twilight Saga as all vampires must have fangs, but it is what it is...a love story.  And it's not written for adults, this is a young adult series so no open sex here and cursing is a very minimal (if any).I'm very eager to see Eclipse and am readingTwilight (The Twilight Saga)for the 3rd time (I had to re-read it after seeing the first movie).",5,I thought it was great,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1890,"['When', 'readTwilight', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'seeing', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'However', 'whenTwilight', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'came', 'film', 'had', 'see', 'loved', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'screen', 'made', 'difference', 'putting', 'characters', 'know', 'are', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'films', 'books', 'fine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'alike.When', 'New', 'Moon', 'previews', 'started', 'showing', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'LikeTwilight', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'saw', 'theater', 'let', 'say', 'one', 'word', 'WOW', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'movie', 'followed', 'book', 'so', 'closely', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'larger', 'books', 'where', 'cut', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'much.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'perfect', 'Bella', 'part', 'clumsly', 'dramatic', 'self', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'well', 'just', 'hot', 'However', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'way', 'talking', 'crinkling', 'eyebrows', 'little', 'smile', 'just', 'so', 'Edward', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'books', 'read', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying.I', 'thought', 'wovles', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'shift', 'fly', 'wolf', 'form', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'how', 'big', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'were', 'big', 'books', 'Again', 'following', 'book', 'good', 'thing', 'here.If', 'are', ""n't"", 'familar', 'vampires', 'Twilight', 'please', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'fangs', 'blood', 'are', 'different', 'vampire', 'sparkle', 'when', 'sunlight', 'yes', 'took', 'along', 'time', 'accept', 'have', 'fangs', 'wish', 'were', 'fangs', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'vampires', 'must', 'have', 'fangs', 'what', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'written', 'adults', 'young', 'adult', 'series', 'open', 'sex', 'here', 'cursing', 'very', 'minimal', '.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'Eclipse', 'am', 'readingTwilight', 'Twilight', 'Saga', '3rd', 'time', 'had', 're-read', 'seeing', 'first', 'movie']",N/A

1224044,A1D50VH0IN57B5,B001OQCV56,"M. Mcilvoy ""book lover""","[5, 6]","This movie has received so much hype and has been so highly anticipated that I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had read both good and bad reviews.  I asked my 16 year old niece about the movie and she loved it.  She said it was better than the first.  Now I have seen it and can share my thoughts.I'm in my mid-forties and a mother of two so I am not a teen girl who dreams of Edward at night.  Having said that I have to admit I love the books and was looking forward to the movie.  We all went, including my husband who has not read the books but has seen Twilight and enjoyed it. Unlike many reviewers I see the books and movies as just a love story and not a commentary about feminism so I do not feel insulted that Bella seems so dependent on Edward for her happiness.  True love can be like that; I think the story makes very clear that this is not a crush but a life-long love.First of all I thought Kristen Stewart did a much better job of acting in this installment than the first.  I felt she played Bella as too assertive in Twilight; this time around she did a better job of being vulnerable.  This screenplay stuck more closely to the book than the first did.  It was probably a bit easier for non-Twilight readers to follow, although I imagine 99% of the audience had read the books.  Taylor Lautner did a great job as Jacob, much better than I expected.  When he took off his shirt to wipe the blood of Bella's face I involuntarily ""oohhed"" at his improved physique.  It covered for the fact that he is not nearly as huge as the book Jacob gets.  The movie did a very good job of conveying Bella's pain after Edward leaves her, which was such a central part of the story.  There were also a few laughs in this movie which was enjoyable since it is rather a heavy subject without much humor.I thought the Cullens looked far more ""vampirish"" this time around than the last, although they were not in it very much.  From the little I saw of Rosalie, she did not look good at all.  I hated Jasper's hair; it made him look silly.The special effects with the wolves and fight scenes were great.  I wish there would have been a bit more action but then there wasn't alot of action in the book either so I shouldn't have been too surprised.  The special effects were good enough however that it made me wish for more. I liked the scene with Laurent and his interaction with the wolves.  The scene where the tourists were herded unknowingly into the Volturi's room as dinner was chilling when the screams started and Bella was hustled out so she wouldn't focus on it.All in all it was a good movie and faithful to the story the book told.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of the book.  I will say that the music in this movie was not nearly as good as the first, which was fantastic and almost part of the movie.  That was not the case with this one; none of the songs really stood out or caught my attention.  I am looking forward to the next movie (although I'm disappointed that they switched Victorias.)",4,A little difficult to review after all the hype...,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,3024,"['movie', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'been', 'so', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'read', 'good', 'bad', 'reviews', 'asked', '16', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'movie', 'loved', 'said', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'share', 'thoughts.I', ""'m"", 'mid-forties', 'mother', 'two', 'am', 'not', 'teen', 'girl', 'who', 'Edward', 'night', 'Having', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'love', 'books', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'went', 'including', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'Twilight', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'reviewers', 'see', 'books', 'movies', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'commentary', 'feminism', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'insulted', 'Bella', 'so', 'dependent', 'Edward', 'happiness', 'True', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'think', 'story', 'very', 'clear', 'not', 'crush', 'life-long', 'love.First', 'thought', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'acting', 'installment', 'first', 'felt', 'played', 'Bella', 'too', 'assertive', 'Twilight', 'time', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'screenplay', 'stuck', 'more', 'closely', 'book', 'first', 'did', 'was', 'probably', 'bit', 'easier', 'non-Twilight', 'readers', 'follow', 'imagine', '99', '%', 'audience', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Jacob', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'When', 'took', 'off', 'shirt', 'wipe', 'blood', 'Bella', 'face', 'involuntarily', 'oohhed', 'improved', 'physique', 'covered', 'fact', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'huge', 'book', 'Jacob', 'movie', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'Bella', 'pain', 'Edward', 'was', 'central', 'part', 'story', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'laughs', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'rather', 'heavy', 'subject', 'much', 'humor.I', 'thought', 'Cullens', 'looked', 'far', 'more', 'vampirish', 'time', 'last', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'little', 'saw', 'Rosalie', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'hated', 'Jasper', 'hair', 'made', 'look', 'silly.The', 'special', 'effects', 'wolves', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'wish', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'alot', 'action', 'book', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'too', 'surprised', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'however', 'made', 'wish', 'more', 'liked', 'scene', 'Laurent', 'interaction', 'wolves', 'scene', 'where', 'tourists', 'were', 'herded', 'unknowingly', 'Volturi', 'room', 'dinner', 'was', 'chilling', 'when', 'screams', 'started', 'Bella', 'was', 'hustled', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'focus', 'it.All', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'faithful', 'story', 'book', 'told', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'book', 'will', 'say', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'was', 'fantastic', 'almost', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'one', 'none', 'songs', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'caught', 'attention', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'movie', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'switched', 'Victorias']",N/A

1224053,ALBXZGW0KB1IQ,B001OQCV56,"MS ""MSB""","[6, 8]","Talented director Catherine Hardwicke did a fine job creating the original Twilight movie. She had little money to work with. Nobody thought the movie would be successful, and so the budget was almost non-existent. But through her sheer ingenuity and love for the story, and the skills of young actors Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson, she spun some magic. Maybe the movie was low-budget, but there was nothing stunted or meager about its richness of mood, character and environment. Hardwicke's respect for Twilight's Romeo and Juliet--Edward and Bella--shines through. In other words, she got it right.By contrast we have director Chris Weitz's bloated, gassy New Moon movie, a disjointed mess which he tries to conceal by distracting us with over-the-top  special effects. The story line calls for Edward (Pattinson) and Bella (Stewart) to be separated and therefore very saddened; but Bella looks jaded and hardened, not just sad. As for Edward, red-lipsticked to within an inch of his life, but with huge shadowed eyes, his look this time around will remind older viewers of the Heroin Chic appearance of models in the '90s.

The overall story arc is essentially about a girl caught in the dilemma of choosing between a polished, cultured, well-traveled aristocrat (the vampire Edward Cullen) and a muscular, blue-collar, emotional best friend (the werewolf Jacob).  These two males represent dream guys for many women; and having to choose between them is probably the dream of many a teenage girl.  Even more, the vampire is light skinned while the werewolf is dark-skinned; so we have a color contrast between the two guys.  So the Twilight series are essentially penny-romance novels with the modern twist of archetypal monsters.  This installment of the series shows the break-up of Edward and Bella, followed by Bella's descent into teenage revelry, and concluded with them getting back together.  The middle part of the movie focuses on Bella's relationship with werewolf Jacob, and her discovery of his wilder side.  There are some action scenes, and some neat special effects showing humans transforming into werewolves.

In ""New Moon"" the characters are already established and the book takes us into new territory and a three-way love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  We find out that Jacob was carrying a ressesive gene that was activated soon after the results of the first book ended.  What happened was that Jacob actually is a wolf shape shifter who's sole purpose is to kill any and all vampires.  Edward feels the need to ""protect"" Bella from himself and leaves her to live a supposedly normal ""human"" life.  In the time after Jacob and Bella's friendship grows and their emotional attachment becomes deeper.  Jacob falls for Bella and Bella begins to love Jacob.  However, Bella's first love Edward is the one who she wants to be with.  Jealousy, tension, and anger ensues between the 3 characters.  But not before Bella having to run to Italy to save Edward from a grizzy fate of exposing Vampires to the moral world, hence, being killed by the Vampire World's ""Royalty"".Overall,  the movie itself did a decent job at translating the book to screen.  However, there is no passion that the characters show and the intense scenes between the threesome end up being nothing more than melodramatic.

1224080,A1QYOWY8H6MT16,B001OQCV56,Phoenix Child,"[5, 8]","After the debacle of the ""Twilight"" movie adaptation, I walked into the theatre to see ""New Moon"" with great trepidation. I remembered the cringe-worthy moments in the original film that deviated from the novel, the horrific special effects, and the wretched acting, and I almost cringed as ""New Moon"" started. Until I actually watched the movie, and I realized: they actually stayed faithful to the novel.In the Hollywood of today, that's actually remarkable enough to comment on. I could list a hundred ""adaptation"" movies that are so different from the source material that literally all the movie has in common with the book is the title (""Queen of the Damned,"" ""Eragon,"" ""Harry Potter 3, 4 & 5,"" ""Blood & Chocolate""...). ""Twilight"" barely escaped being added to that list.""New Moon,"" however, literally changed *everything* about the first movie but the actors and the setting. This is particularly apparent in the directing: gone are Catherine Hardwicke's over-the-top atmospherics and choppy camera angles. The characters look, feel and act both real and immediate rather than as characters from a novel, lending ""New Moon"" intimacy and depth. Chris Weiz, who also directed the highly succesful ""Golden Compass"" adaptation, teased depths of acting talent from Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, making both Bella and Edward sympathetic and endearing, something ""Twilight"" failed to do on an epic scale.In terms of script, the same screenwriter adapted ""New Moon"" and clearly heard the criticism levelled against her that she'd added far too much of her own writing. Gone are Edward's painfully awkward ""spider-monkey"" comments. I also happily comment that in the amount of time Edward is featured in the movie, he and Bella do not spend that time in a tree.In terms of special effects, clearly a larger budget as well as more faithful renderings breathed life in this department. First and foremost, Edward actually sparkles like diamond in the sunlight. In ""Twilight,"" he looked like he was sweating garlic, which was fairly nauseating. Also, vampires now move with elegant speed rather than stop-motion photography. While the werewolves looked computer generated, they were quite well-done for a teenage-based movie. It was also refreshing to see that the vampire eyes (or golden contact lenses) were not completely in-your-face as they were in the first film.I was completely impressed with the level of pathos Kristen Stewart managed to convey throughout this film. Without trying to concentrate solely on her love of Edward, when left alone to brood Stewart drew one in and finally sold me on her casting as Bella Swan. The decision to turn Bella's auditory hallucinations into visuals with a brooding Edward watching her guardingly played off Pattinson's portrayal of Edward perfectly, transitioning a strange plot device to film with flair. Taylor Lautner channeled an aggressive Jacob Black well enough, though the actor functioned better as Bella's best friend than as a potential love interest.The real winner of this film, however, was the sheer faithfulness to the source material. The cinematics were handled quite well -- one of my favorite scenes was the passing of the months from Bella's perspective; I was unsure how Weitz would direct that passing of time and the decision to use her window as a perspective was wonderful. There was almost nothing added to the film that wasn't in the novel. One particular add-in was Bella writing unsent e-mails to Alice, which was actually more interesting than having Bella narrate for the entire story.The wolf pack was handled quickly yet efficiently, and the decision to keep Emily in the story was a solid one, lending Jacob's frustration depth. The city of Volterra was gorgeously rendered, and the Volturi themselves were charmingly evil. The revelation of Dakota Fanning's ability to play a sadistic childlike vampire was somewhat delicious, if a tad unsettling.My only complaint was the abrupt ending to the story: there was a major conversation as well as a bit of wrapping-up at the end of the novel that should have been adapted into the movie, rather than having Edward ask his question and then transfer immediately to the end credits. Also, although the soundtrack to ""New Moon"" was fantastic, one level that ""Twilight"" had in heaps over its predecessor was the ability to blend the songs into the movie. Often, the songs in ""New Moon"" were just disruptive or only there for five seconds and begged the question as to why they were included. However, the thematic use of Thom Yorke's deliciously broody ""Hearing Damage"" was fantastic.Another comment: Along with the change of director, we had a change of score writer. Gone are Carter Burwell's electronic ambiance distortions, and we now have a wondrous score with the force of a full orchestra written by the fantastic and multiple award-winning Alexandre Desplat. This was a positive change for the better that reinforced how seriously the studio is taking the ""Twilight"" franchise.FINAL THOUGHTS: ""New Moon"" was an artistic and lovingly rendered adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's vision. I detested the ""Twilight"" movie adaptation, and ""New Moon"" did so much better that I actually feel comfortable saying that I eagerly anticipate ""Eclipse."" While it will hardly win over any new viewers/readers to the current ""Twilight"" phenomenon, ""New Moon"" was a force of positive change, turning a franchise that had the potential to be entirely limited to its 13-and-under female fans into a true cinematic feature, able to stand on its own as a wondrously moody entry into vampire lore.4 1/2 out of 5 stars.THE SOUNDTRACK ALBUM: Vastly different from the original ""Twilight"" soundtrack, ""New Moon"" upset many fans by not including popular artists or pop/rock music but rather keeping a more folk-rock, moody feel. While the music was not used well within the film itself, the soundtrack stands alone as a wonderful collection of ""Twilight"" related songs that were written specifically for the film.THE SCORE: Masterfully written by Alexandre Desplat, ""New Moon"" is an orchestral journey through the woods of Forks. Giving each character a signature theme, Bella's piano-ballad based theme of loss was achingly lovely and haunted the listener, giving ""New Moon"" a depth and a gravity lost in ""Twilight.""",4,"A

1224083,AOC6CQ1MHA8UD,B001OQCV56,P. Taegel,"[64, 87]","It's no mistake that NEW MOON has been nominated for several Razzie awards that honor the worst films of the year.  This film is atrocious on every level (with perhaps the exceptions of its soundtrack and the cinematography).For a teen vampire film, it's tone is oddly self-important and humorless.  There are no moments of levity to break up the dour malaise in which the characters in this world seem to be hopelessly entangled.  Every scene is without subtext.  The characters say exactly what they're thinking and feeling at all times.  The result is that the scenes have no tension and fall flat. (e.g. ""So, you're a werewolf..."")The acting is stilted and without nuance.  Kristen Stuart plasters a single, anguished expression on her face the entire time, and the effect is something like watching someone in desperate need of a bowel movement -- for three hours.But the real issue is that there simply isn't a story.  Without the smoke and mirrors of the supernatural creature element as a diversion, and setting aside for a moment the fact that this is a story about a hundred year old guy who digs high school chicks -- the storyline goes something like this:SPOILER ALERT -- DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE STORY REVEALED!Edward breaks up with his girlfriend Bella and moves away.  Bella becomes hopelessly depressed, but eventually starts hanging out with a new guy, Jake.  Here we actually have a lot of promise for a great love triangle, but... the relationship kind of starts to develop with Jake, but not really.  Bella still loves Edward and is in no danger of changing her heart.  (In my opinion, this is the tragic flaw of NEW MOON.  If Bella had, after grieving Edward, really and truly fallen in love with Jake, the story could have taken some interesting twists and turns).  At any rate, because Bella hasn't gotten over Edward, she becomes a risk-taker.  Why?  Because every time Bella is in danger, she hallucinates Edward.  These hallucinations make her feel close to him.  Well, this risk taking has the unintended consequence of giving Edward's sister a dream of Bella's death.  And since Edward can read his sister's mind (when it's convenient for the story), Edward fears Bella has died.  Worried, Edward makes a phone call to Bella, but as luck would have it, Jake answers the phone.  Edward misconstrues the cryptic conversation he has with Jacob and assumes Bella is dead.  Before you know it, Edward's sister shows up and reveals that Edward is going to kill himself.  So Bella races to Italy to prevent Edward (who is not reachable by phone, email or telepathy) from killing himself.  She does prevent his suicide, and Edward returns with her back to the Pacific Northwest.  Jake is bummed, but although Bella feels bad for him, it's a simple decision that she continue to go steady with Edward.  The end.So nothing really changes from the start to the finish of this film.  Relationships don't change.  People's feelings don't change.  Despite being sad, Bella loves Edward at the beginning, middle and end of the film.  The thing about a love story is that it's only really interesting if two people FALL in love.  But in NEW MOON they STAY in love.  It's almost as if we're supposed to care about these people and want to watch them not because they're doing anything interesting, but just because they're love is ""special.""  But what makes it so special?  The fact that he's a vampire?  The fact is that love is only ""more special"" when it's tragic.  But here it's not presented as tragic.  It's presented as idyllic.  Snoresville.But wait a minute, -- Edward is a VAMPIRE.  He's going to stay young looking while Bella ages.  How can that NOT be tragic?  That's called inconvenient, -- not tragic.  It doesn't prevent them from being together.  You may as well say that EVERY love story is tragic because everyone dies eventually.However, there is an upside to all of this.

1224091,A3C4BVBA22741E,B001OQCV56,ReaderFanatic,"[7, 10]","That's the best way I can describe this horrific travesty called a ""movie"". Much ado about nothing because nothing was happening, but everything ""seemed"" to be SOOOOO dramatic. I think I must have uttered the words ""My God"" at least 150 times while watching this movie and it wasn't because I was so in awe of what I was seeing... I take that back. I was in awe, in complete disbelief that a movie could be SO bad, yet be so loved by so many.From the beginning of the movie to the very end, I was flabbergasted by how horrible the writing  was. I was appalled by how one-dimensional and stilted the dialog was. I was beside myself by how completely void of emotion the acting was. Even as a teenage girl, this movie would have made me cringe and probably demand my money back at the box office had I seen it at the theater.Seriously, the only way I was able to watch this movie was in small doses. My friends had told me how bad it was, but like most things that leave victims in its wake in total devastation, I had to see it for myself.  It took me a whole week to watch New Moon. Here's why:Spoiler Alert:I'll start with the bad, there's so much of it:Bella - Void of human emotion, it's no wonder she can't relate to other humans at all. I don't see why the author or director thinks I'm supposed to buy the cockamamie story that Bella has friends just because they throw her in a scene with four ppl who really should be giving her the cold shoulder. The humans in this series seem so desperate to be accepted by Bella who act as though she's too good for them, It's just sad and pathetic, nuff said about that.More about Bella, though. I find it funny that the vampires claim they can't read her mind. I believe I have the answer why. And the answer is: There's nothing there to read. Bella has no thoughts. She can't even hold a conversation, for crying out loud! If she's not talking about how beautiful and wonderful Edward is, or how ""complex"" and lonely and sad she is, then the dummy has nothing to say.No emotional range at all, and she's pretty heartless, egotistical and selfish if you think about it. Uses people when she needs to, but then pretends she's the victim. And I can't tell you how stupid it was that she hallucinated seeing Edward everytime she thought about doing something stupid. But even more ridiculous was her reason for being sooooo ""daring"". I only wished there was a bunch of jagged rocks at the bottom of the cliff when her dumb butt jumped.Edward - He's got to be bi-polar, that's the only thing that can explain his wishy-washy personality and rational. When he tells Bella he must leave her because she's ""not good for him"" it leaves you thinking. ""OMG"" and ""WTF"" I suppose this epiphany came to him when he tossed her silly butt into the mirror and table at his house on her birthday. Doing more damage to her than anyone else in the movie did. I only wish the mirror had sliced her throat and killed her, thus sparing the rest of us such a boring melodrama of a plot.So Edward leaves, abandoning Bella, who sits in the same chair in the same outfit for three months. LOL. Just terrible. I only wished she had downed some pills and slit her wrist in a tub of hot water and spared us the silly ""adrenaline junkie"" routine that follows her lame depression.Poor Jacob, with his goofy butt, pining for this corpse of a girl who doesn't want him. Why does he want her so badly. Why does ANYONE want her the way they do!!!!!? She's empty inside. E.M.P.T.Y.! I only wish I had a silver bullet to put him out of his misery.There was so many silly, unbelievable scenes in this movie, to name them all, I'd have to write a novel. The only good thing I thought the movie had was the size of the wolves were impressive, too bad they looked like cartoons with that crappy CGI. Also, the fight scenes were interesting, too bad the one with the wolves and the vampire didn't get a chance to play out, because we had to see what Bella was up to. The vampire fight with Edward seemed overdone and in the end a waste of time, but at least Edward got his butt kicked and that put a smile on my face. He deserved it for taking off his shirt exposing his spiny, frail, pale, pitiful-looking, glittery bird chest.The drama was forced, the romance is non-existent and the plot was barer than Mrs. Hubbard's cupboard.

1224092,A39W3263A9HCMN,B001OQCV56,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[12, 31]","I'm sure that most of you non-Twihards have stayed far away from the cinemas for a month beginning November 20th. For what reason would that be? Well, because the newest in the sparkle-vampire romance series based on the Meyer novels, New Moon, got released, and had Twihards flocking to the cinemas in droves. And believe me, I bet you're probably wondering why tweens are laying down the cash for this movie instead of a good movie like Avatar? Good question. That's what I'm wondering too.But having read the books, I can safely come to a conclusion. Who is Bella in New Moon? Bella is a whiny, immature, pre-teen Mary Sue character who has no real strengths, only weaknesses, and yet only one real ambition in life- to be with that sparkly vampire boyfriend of hers, Edward Cullens. Of course, as learned in the first entry, ""Twilight"", she always blows off her friends so that she can go see her boyfriend. And of course, everything with Jacob, whom of which is the ONLY likeable character in the series (note- I didn't put ""saga"" for a reason): ""Oh sorry, Jacob. I really think you're nice and you're cute, but you're not a vampire, you're not totally perfect like Edward is, oh, and you don't sparkle. But here! You can become a raging pedophile and fall in love with my child, Renesmee!"". Sigh.Either way, I find this all very negatively sad, because I really do adore Vampire fiction. Really. I enjoy reading and watching vampire fiction on a daily basis- When I saw Bram Stoker's Dracula (1932) as a child, I became fascinated with Vampires. 30 Days of Night, From Dusk till Dawn, Interview With A Vampire, Let The Right One In- you name it, I've seen it. Hell, I even like that show ""The Vampire Diaries"", even though it follows with the 90210 Vampires trend, but it's still a guilty pleasure to watch. And when I hear constant ""ZOMGZ I WANNA DATE EDWARD CULLANS!!!!! ELEVENONE!!!!!111!!!!"", I stop to take a moment and facepalm.Oh, but getting back to the movie. Not to mention the sheer awfulness of the special effects in this one, which mirror the sheer awfulness of the effects in the first one, which conceal the movie's worthiness for TV entertainment. Go ahead, Twihards, bash me, I'm ready. And the awfulness of the acting is still here, but that's understandable. Even Paddy himself hates the character of Edward, and I was pleased to read this quote in an interview:""When you read the book, it's like, `Edward Cullen was so beautiful I creamed myself.' I mean, every line is like that. He's the most ridiculous person who's so amazing at everything... Plus, he's a 108-year-old virgin so he's obviously got some issues there.""Paddy seems to have the acting talents and facial expressions of a wooden chair. Stewart seems to have gotten her acting lessons from Mr. Pattinson himself, but then again nobody can blame them. Really, I don't expect such a ridiculous script to have excited them to the point where they actually started caring for their characters. Fortunately, Lautner turns in a great performance as Jacob. Actually, I really do think that Lautner, despite his age, is a good actor, and that he has potential to become great in the future. He makes his character work on quite a few levels.Oh, and morals. Let's not forget. This movie has TONS of good morals for teen girls (rolls eyes). They include, but are not limited to: ""Girls, just remember that without your man, you are nothing!"" ""Missing your man? Go act incredibly stupid and just do suicidal things like jumping off a cliff! That'll attract his attention! Life just isn't worth living without him anyways!"". Oh, and my personal favorite: ""It's OK to become comatose when your sparkling boyfriend dumps you- you're life is worthless without him anyway.""Oh, and one more thing: This is not a vampire movie. When Vampires are exposed to sunlight, they burn and die, not sparkle like faeries.IN TOTAL:Entertainment: 0/10Sex: 0/10Violence: 0/10Romance: 0/10Vamp factor: 0/10Worthy of shelling out hard-earned dough for: 0/10Anybody beginning to notice a pattern going on here? 0/10***Only see it if you're a fan of the book- otherwise, if you're like me and abhor the series, avoid***",1,Can we please stop comparing Edward and Bella to classical romantic figures?,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,4176,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'non-Twihards', 'have', 'stayed', 'far', 'away', 'cinemas', 'month', 'beginning', 'November', '20th', 'what', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'Well', 'newest', 'sparkle-vampire', 'romance', 'series', 'based', 'Meyer', 'novels', 'New', 'Moon', 'got', 'released', 'had', 'Twihards', 'flocking', 'cinemas', 'droves', 'believe', 'bet', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'why', 'tweens', 'are', 'laying', 'down', 'cash', 'movie', 'instead', 'good', 'movie', 'Avatar', 'Good', 'question', 'what', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'too.But', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'safely', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Who', 'Bella', 'New', 'Moon', 'Bella', 'whiny', 'immature', 'pre-teen', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'character', 'who', 'real', 'strengths', 'only', 'yet', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'ambition', 'life-', 'be', 'sparkly', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'hers', 'Edward', 'Cullens', 'course', 'learned', 'first', 'entry', 'Twilight', 'always', 'off', 'friends', 'can', 'go', 'see', 'boyfriend', 'course', 'everything', 'Jacob', 'whom', 'ONLY', 'likeable', 'character', 'series', 'note-', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'saga', 'reason', 'Oh', 'sorry', 'Jacob', 'really', 'think', ""'re"", 'nice', ""'re"", 'cute', ""'re"", 'not', 'vampire', ""'re"", 'not', 'totally', 'perfect', 'Edward', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'here', 'can', 'become', 'raging', 'pedophile', 'fall', 'love', 'child', 'Renesmee', 'Sigh.Either', 'way', 'find', 'very', 'negatively', 'sad', 'really', 'do', 'adore', 'Vampire', 'fiction', 'Really', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'watching', 'vampire', 'fiction', 'daily', 'basis-', 'When', 'saw', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', '1932', 'child', 'became', 'fascinated', 'Vampires', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'From', 'Dusk', 'till', 'Dawn', 'Interview', 'A', 'Vampire', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'In-', 'name', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hell', 'even', 'show', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'even', '90210', 'Vampires', 'trend', 'still', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'when', 'hear', 'constant', 'ZOMGZ', 'WAN', 'NA', 'DATE', 'EDWARD', 'CULLANS', 'ELEVENONE', '111', 'stop', 'take', 'moment', 'facepalm.Oh', 'getting', 'back', 'movie', 'Not', 'mention', 'sheer', 'awfulness', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'mirror', 'sheer', 'awfulness', 'effects', 'first', 'one', 'conceal', 'movie', 'worthiness', 'TV', 'entertainment', 'Go', 'ahead', 'Twihards', 'bash', ""'m"", 'ready', 'awfulness', 'acting', 'still', 'here', 'understandable', 'Even', 'Paddy', 'character', 'Edward', 'was', 'pleased', 'read', 'quote', 'interview', 'When', 'read', 'book', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'creamed', 'mean', 'line', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'person', 'who', 'so', 'amazing', 'everything', '108-year-old', 'virgin', 'obviously', 'got', 'issues', 'there', 'Paddy', 'have', 'acting', 'talents', 'facial', 'expressions', 'wooden', 'chair', 'Stewart', 'have', 'gotten', 'acting', 'lessons', 'Mr.', 'Pattinson', 'then', 'again', 'nobody', 'can', 'blame', 'Really', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'have', 'excited', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'started', 'caring', 'characters', 'Fortunately', 'Lautner', 'great', 'performance', 'Jacob', 'Actually', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'Lautner', 'age', 'good', 'actor', 'potential', 'become', 'great', 'future', 'character', 'work', 'few', 'levels.Oh', 'morals', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'movie', 'TONS', 'good', 'morals', 'teen', 'girls', 'rolls', 'eyes', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'Girls', 'just', 'remember', 'man', 'are', 'nothing', 'Missing', 'man', 'Go', 'act', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'just', 'do', 'suicidal', 'things', 'jumping', 'off', 'cliff', ""'ll"", 'attract', 'attention', 'Life', 'just', ""n't"", 'worth', 'living', 'Oh', 'personal', 'favorite', 'OK', 'become', 'comatose', 'when', 'sparkling', 'boyfriend', 'dumps', 'you-', ""'re"", 'life', 'worthless', 'anyway', 'Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'not', 'vampire', 'movie', 'When', 'Vampires', 'are', 'exposed', 'sunlight', 'burn', 'die', 'not', 'sparkle', 'faeries.IN', 'TOTAL', 'Entertainment', '0/10Sex', '0/10Violence', '0/10Romance', '0/10Vamp', 'factor', '0/10Worthy', 'shelling', 'out', 'hard-earned', 'dough', '0/10Anybody', 'beginning', 'notice', 'pattern', 'going', 'here', '0/10***Only', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'book-', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'abhor', 'series', 'avoid***']",N/A

1224096,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B001OQCV56,robb1138,"[2, 5]","Well that pretty much sums up ""New Moon,"" the latest in Stephanie Meyer's ""Twilight"" series. I have not read any of the ""Twilight"" soap opera series of books and just reviewing this film only. I am sure the book is probably better. This movie is for ""Twilight"" fans or teenage girls. First piece of advice for those who know nothing about this series and want to watch this movie ... rent it do not buy it. Secondly, you need to see ""Twilight"" first, as this movie does not recap much for the newly initiated. Finally, do not expect much in the way of any deep revelations on vampire lore.A quick synopsis from ""Twilight"": girl meets vampire; girl falls in love with vampire (it's a bad-boy thing); more bad guys come between girl and vampire; vampire saves girl. Good, we have caught up with the series. In ""New Moon""', we focus more on the shape-shifting Native-American's living up in Fork, Washington. They introduce the werewolf part in the ""Twilight"", just so you know. Leaving off from ""Twilight,"" all seems well and good for Bella and Edward until Edward tells Bella that his Vampire family, the Cullens, have to move on because the locals are noticing how remarkably well preserved they all look after all these years - it must be the vegetarian lifestyle. So off they go leaving Bella to face her fears of growing old.I am sure that this movie appeals to teenage girls for precisely this reason, their first love, their realization that growing up and leaving home and facing their mortality is just awful. Either sit at home in a rocking chair like Bella, or get out and get another boy friend. Bella does both. She goes after Jacob, her friend from childhood, and also a member of the local American-Indian tribe, the Quileute. Bella forces herself on this kid; re-build motorcycles together, and Bella is falling for him. Jacob, played by Taylor Lautner, is a bright kid, has an impressive hunky body (my daughter's words, not mine) and seems to be smart but who is in with the wrong crowd. Now this is where ""I was a Teenage Wolfman"" comes to mind. Bella's choice for a boyfriend is difficult, should she go for the hairy and hot Jacob? Perhaps she should go for the smooth and cold Edward? The changing into werewolf is a metaphor for change and Jacob is changing from a child into a man.The photography is beautiful, the greens contrasting nicely against the gray pallet of the North West. The acting is barely passable, the characters are not credible, and the actors are attractive, but the acting is too reserved. The story is weak and limps its way. The visual effects are great, although Edward shines too much. The ending ... Well let's just say that they set you up for Eclipse, the third in this series.

1224099,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001OQCV56,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 6]","We've all dealt with unrequited love before, but ""New Moon,"" the second installment in the popular ""Twilight"" series, takes it to a whole new level.  Bella Swan, the moody high school student who found herself in love with a vampire - the brooding Edward - in the first film, now finds herself attracted to a werewolf, her long-haired Native American childhood pal turned cropped-haired, muscle-bound super-hunk, Jacob.  Now, that's a love triangle you don't come across every day of the week.This disappointing, time-marking follow-up to the flawed but often imaginative ""Twilight"" is a tedious, slow-moving bore, consisting of little more than endless conversations about which of Bella's two ""monstrous"" beaus loves her the more and which is more likely to protect her from the danger posed by his rival and the assorted associates and kinsmen that come along with him.  In fact, so focused is the story on the romantic travails of the three main characters that the movie ultimately stalls out in a puddle of its own sappiness.  And on a purely technical level, even the CGI werewolves are not as impressive as we'd expect them to be, given the massive amount of cash clearly lavished on the project.Actually, the thing that strikes one the most about ""New Moon"" is just how much of a rehash it is of the previous film, with Bella's predicament simply being played over, only this time with a lover from a different species (especially as Edward voluntarily removes himself from much of the action this time around).Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson return as the human/vampire lovers, while Lautner gets to run around with his shirt off a good deal of the time (despite the damp, rainy climate).  That may be enough to keep the movie's targeted audience of teenaged girls awake and glued to the screen for the duration, but the rest of us will have no trouble snoozing our way through to the next installment.",2,drippy and inert,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1917,"[""'ve"", 'dealt', 'unrequited', 'love', 'New', 'Moon', 'second', 'installment', 'popular', 'Twilight', 'series', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'moody', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'found', 'love', 'vampire', 'brooding', 'Edward', 'first', 'film', 'now', 'attracted', 'werewolf', 'long-haired', 'Native', 'American', 'childhood', 'pal', 'turned', 'cropped-haired', 'muscle-bound', 'super-hunk', 'Jacob', 'Now', 'love', 'triangle', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'day', 'week.This', 'disappointing', 'time-marking', 'follow-up', 'flawed', 'often', 'imaginative', 'Twilight', 'tedious', 'slow-moving', 'bore', 'consisting', 'little', 'more', 'endless', 'conversations', 'Bella', 'two', 'monstrous', 'beaus', 'more', 'more', 'likely', 'protect', 'danger', 'posed', 'rival', 'assorted', 'associates', 'kinsmen', 'come', 'fact', 'so', 'focused', 'story', 'romantic', 'travails', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'out', 'puddle', 'own', 'sappiness', 'purely', 'technical', 'level', 'even', 'CGI', 'werewolves', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'given', 'massive', 'amount', 'cash', 'clearly', 'lavished', 'project.Actually', 'thing', 'one', 'most', 'New', 'Moon', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'rehash', 'previous', 'film', 'Bella', 'predicament', 'simply', 'being', 'played', 'only', 'time', 'lover', 'different', 'species', 'especially', 'Edward', 'voluntarily', 'much', 'action', 'time', 'around', '.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'return', 'human/vampire', 'lovers', 'Lautner', 'run', 'around', 'shirt', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'damp', 'rainy', 'climate', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'targeted', 'audience', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'awake', 'glued', 'screen', 'duration', 'rest', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'snoozing', 'way', 'next', 'installment']",N/A

1224118,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B001OQCV56,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[4, 9]","New Moon refers of course to the darkest phase of the moon, thus the story is told.The short version:  Bella hates her birthday and refuses presents but her father and friends force them on her anyway.  She visits the Cullens for a birthday party and cuts herself.  Someone goes ballistic wanting to bite her.Edward at that point decides to blow the joint.  Bella goes into a depression for months and ignores everyone and is so egocentric that she does not notice.  Jacob comes along and helps her fix bikes (why and where is not fully explained).  She starts assuming Jacob is almost filling up the hole in her life.  Through several plotholes we find that Jacob becomes a werewolf because of an inherited gene carried from generation to generation (sorry, Lon Chaney).The vampires apparently are fast but not fast enough for the wolves.  Bella has little faith in the wolves.  Jacob wants to drop her as he is afraid he'll scratch her or worse.  Meantime, her father's best friend (from the last film) dies of a heart attack while dancing with a redheaded vampire (who has no dialogue), Victoria.  Eventually Alice returns and tells her Edward thinks she is about to or has killed herself.  As in Romeo and Juliet, Edward decides to off himself.He goes to the Voltori who are an ancient race of vampires who live in Italy (not fully explained in the film).  After some adventure with them and Edward sparkling in the sun (sorry Bram Stoker) we eventually get back to Forks, WA.  Her father scolds her for not telling him where she was for three solid days and then grounds her for life.  What a harsh dad.Eventually, Edward mumbles his undying love, there is lots of staring and angst.  Bella still wants to be a vampire.  Edward gives her conditions.  The End.OK, now this is what I think:Jacob [Taylor Lautner] the only interesting actor in this drab, colorless version of the Twilight Saga: New Moon, authored by Stephanie Meyer (the book is also drab and colorless but I already wrote a review on that one!).The author:  Ms. Meyer decided to turn the whole vampire myth upside down.  Rather than cursed supernatural beings who need to feed on blood and see humans as prey, she created a world where vampires can walk in sunlight and interact and fall in love with humans.  No coffins to sleep in.  And special powers I never heard of such as mind-reading and projecting pain.The director:  This is the same guy who did a hatchet job on The Golden Compass.  At least the Golden Compass had several strong female characters.  New Moon fails to deliver.The cast:  The Voltori (SP) were an interesting group of ancient vampires -- the book skirts their development and the film delivers very little information.  After all, this is a look at the failed loves of an egocentric, apathetic little girl who wants to join the Undead to be with Edward.Kirsten Stewart reprises her role as the apathetic Bella.  In fact, several cast members, as in the book, point out that she is insane and have never seen anyone in their existence so stubborn and putting themselves into crazy dangerous situations.Oh, as in the book, Bella purposely creates life threatening situations to conjure up mental images and voices of Edward.  It's the only way she can recapture his memory.  Why am I the only viewer who sees a problem with that?As in the Twilight film, the high school pals are the most interesting bunch.  The actors really get into their parts.  There is one scene where all the guys and gals are in a classroom watching Shakespeare and of the students is crying.  *Audience snicker*The music is strained, the violins grate and the ending is harsh.OK, but really, what did you think??The wolf clan was interesting though Bella leads poor Jacob along and decides to go with the ""bloodsuckers"".Effects:  The sparkle is there.  The wolves CGI looks like something off the Saturday morning SyFy channel.SyFy Channel actors:  Oh yes, one of the actors has appeared on SyFy TV programs:  John from Sanctuary [Christopher Heyerdahl] is a vampire and Michael Sheen as Aro, who plays the head Voltori. As in the book, no background, other than they eat tourists alive (mild horror scene here).Recommendations?  Sure.  If you're a fourteen year old girl who does not have a lot of relationship experience, you might like the pecs and abs of the shirtless Wolf gang.The staring was not as bad as in Twilight.  Bella looked constipated and Edward talked softly and seemed in pain during most of the film.Well, at least this generation will read more now.

I loved ""Twilight Eclipse"" but didn't care for ""Twilight,"" so when I got to ""New Moon,"" I was concerned. In ""Eclipse,"" the special effects had me jumping back from the movie screen. In ""Twilight,"" I rolled my eyes at the so-called special effects that looked more like somebody pressed fast forward on the television screen. But ""New Moon"" leaned more towards ""Eclipse"" when it came to special effects. Watching one guy throw his upper body completely over and form into a werewolf was so tight to me I had to rewind it and watch again and again. I'm not going to lie to you. I repeatedly rewound all the scenes with Jacob with no shirt on, and any scene that remotely seemed romantic between Bella and Jacob. In ""Eclipse,"" I couldn't pick a team, but in ""New Moon,"" I was Team Jacob all the way, at one point jumping up and yelling at Bella through the screen.I'm a very late ""Twilight"" fan, but I think this series is fascinating. I like the way Bella is trying to decide who is better for her between being a vampire and being a regular kid who just so happens to grudgingly have a thing for her childhood friend, who just so happens to be a werewolf. The girl apparently doesn't know how to pick regular human beings as love interests and clearly likes to live on the edge. She's the epitome of hard-headed and continuously does things that made me watch the movie thinking, ""You can't be for real! Are you REALLY about to do that? Are you really about to go with HIM? Why are you with HER?"" The fact that she refused to do anything good for her made her even more amusing because viewers knew she was going to get herself into trouble, but she just could've cared less.The dialogue was fun. The plot was interesting. The story was intriguing. The special effects were hot, and the pace was just right. I'm trying to decide which film I liked better between ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse."" It might be a tie. But I'm impatiently waiting on the other three books now because I'm sure they'll be even better! Kudos to the author and to Jacob for his shirt off.Cons: I do have one con though. In the movie ""Twilight,"" Edward Cullen said he'd been a vampire since 1918. But in ""New Moon,"" he said he was 109.

This would have created a real triangle and more suspence to this drama. Edwards broken up with bella and left, and Bella goes into major depression.. Enter Jacob. and the story moves forward,  Then a bit of a twist, Jacob is turning into a wolf and trying to distance himself from Bella..  In a crazy turn of events edwards going to kill himself, Bella Races of to stop him and they kiss and make up.. the end.With that said this movie doesnt really progress the story forward much as id like to have seen it, all the Characters basically stay where they are in the love story, and lets face it.. Twilights not a serious vampire movie, its a love triangle movie with vamps and wolves as a side plot, The only real story in the first three movies is the love triangle.  New moon (the movie) only truly accomplishes one thing in my opinion, and thats introducing us to Jacob as a Wolf and the packs.  Bella doesnt fall in love, or atleast act like she's fallen in love with Jacob and there seems to be no struggle with bella to whoom she is going to choose. Its very clear at the end of New Moon that Edward is the man, plain and simple.Others have said pretty much the same thing im saying and much better than me.",4,i enjoyed this movie alot.,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1550,"['have', 'already', 'viewed', 'movie', 'read', 'on..', '**spoilers**', 'second', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'probably', 'well', 'know', 'where', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'story', 'big', 'way', 'completely', 'spilling', 'beans..', 'there', 'needed', 'humble', 'opinion', 'be', 'more', 'love', 'connection', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'real', 'triangle', 'more', 'suspence', 'drama', 'Edwards', 'broken', 'up', 'bella', 'left', 'Bella', 'major', 'depression..', 'Enter', 'Jacob', 'story', 'forward', 'Then', 'bit', 'twist', 'Jacob', 'turning', 'wolf', 'trying', 'distance', 'Bella..', 'crazy', 'turn', 'events', 'edwards', 'going', 'kill', 'Bella', 'Races', 'stop', 'kiss', 'make', 'up..', 'end.With', 'said', 'movie', 'really', 'progress', 'story', 'forward', 'much', 'id', 'have', 'seen', 'Characters', 'basically', 'stay', 'where', 'are', 'love', 'story', 'face', 'it..', 'Twilights', 'not', 'serious', 'vampire', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'movie', 'vamps', 'wolves', 'side', 'plot', 'only', 'real', 'story', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'love', 'triangle', 'New', 'moon', 'movie', 'only', 'truly', 'one', 'thing', 'opinion', 'thats', 'introducing', 'Jacob', 'Wolf', 'packs', 'Bella', 'doesnt', 'fall', 'love', 'atleast', 'act', 'fallen', 'love', 'Jacob', 'there', 'be', 'struggle', 'bella', 'whoom', 'going', 'choose', 'very', 'clear', 'end', 'New', 'Moon', 'Edward', 'man', 'plain', 'simple.Others', 'have', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'im', 'saying', 'much', 'better']",N/A

1224130,ADLN37B0153N,B001OQCV56,Silmarwen,"[1, 1]","So I went and saw the movie New Moon last night and, I must say, it was WAY better than I was expecting it to be. I went with a group of friends (else I would not have gone to the theatre to see it at all) and we had a very good time. I am not sure how true to to the book this adaptation is as I only got halfway through Twilight before I got bored and gave up, but my friend, who is a high school teacher and so makes an effort to keep up with all things ""in"" right now, assures me that it was true to the book and that several scenes were exactly how she pictured them. Apparently, die hard fans all over the US loved it as it had a colossal opening weekend grossing $142 million (according to Box Office Mojo) so it must have been true to the book's feel.I was not a huge fan of the Twilight Movie, but I had a fun time watching it with friends. It was definitely one of those films where it is so bad that it looks good. We basically laughed our way through the movie with comments such as, ""Did he just spring a boner?"" and ""Is he constipated?"" I thought that the actors were poorly cast in the first film adaptation so I was not particularly excited to see the second one. Maybe my low expectations made the movie seem better than it was, but I think that I enjoyed the movie for one reason: Taylor Lautner. Wow. Big difference from the dopey-eyed, long-haired little boy from the first film. This Jacob (Taylor's role in the movie) was bigger, stronger, tougher and someone that a girl could definitely fall in love with. Accordingly to reputable sources (i.e. my friends), they really did not feel bad that Jacob was caught up in a love triangle with Bella and Edward in the book and they were rooting for Edward and Bella to get together the whole time. Taylor L.'s portrayal in the movie changed everything. Suddenly more women are rooting for Jacob to win Bella's heart and ditch the sullen, broody, weirdly pale Edward. Not to mention the body. Totally lickable. Good news ladies -- the werewolves are shirtless for basically the whole movie! When Edward bares his chest at the end, he just cannot compare.My second reason for watching the movie is the joy of seeing Kristen Stewart as Bella and Robert Pattinson as Edward being schooled in acting by 15-year-old Dakota Fanning who manages to overpower everyone on screen for the 5 minutes that she is in the movie. Now she makes a scary vampire and she has those brooding, scary looks down pat! Ashley Greene, who played Edward's sister in the movie, was a girl who I would like to get to know better. Spunky and fun, even though she is a vampire and can see the future before it happens, she is the type of girl I would believe an Edward Cullen or Jacob Black would fall in love with.I guess I am telling you to go see this movie. I surprisingly found myself rating The Twilight Saga: New Moon with a 4 star out of 5 star rating on Netflix because I fell in love with Jacob (Taylor Lautner) during the movie. He was able to play a 16-year-old in love with his first crush and all of the awkwardness and hope that goes along with that balanced with a great responsibility to protect his tribe from the vampires in the area. I thought the special effects with the werewolf transformations and vampire powers were very well done. I also loved the soundtrack. The film has some moments of gorgeous cinematography and, if it wasn't held back by Kristen Stewart as a depressingly dull and selfish girl who I found distinctly unlovable (no clue why she has 2 such hot supernatural guys chasing after her -- literally) and Robert Pattinson as a less-than-most-beautiful-man-I-have-ever-seen (as he is supposed to be according to the author) who cannot pull off a good dark, brooding look in the lead roles, this movie could have been a real standout.",4,MUCH Better Than I Was Expecting,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,3807,"['So', 'went', 'saw', 'movie', 'New', 'Moon', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'WAY', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'went', 'group', 'friends', 'else', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'theatre', 'see', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'true', 'book', 'adaptation', 'only', 'got', 'halfway', 'Twilight', 'got', 'bored', 'gave', 'up', 'friend', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'so', 'effort', 'keep', 'up', 'things', 'right', 'now', 'assures', 'was', 'true', 'book', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'exactly', 'how', 'pictured', 'Apparently', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'US', 'loved', 'had', 'colossal', 'opening', 'weekend', 'grossing', '142', 'million', 'according', 'Box', 'Office', 'Mojo', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'book', 'feel.I', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'Movie', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'watching', 'friends', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'basically', 'laughed', 'way', 'movie', 'comments', 'such', 'Did', 'just', 'spring', 'boner', 'constipated', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'poorly', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'excited', 'see', 'second', 'one', 'Maybe', 'low', 'expectations', 'made', 'movie', 'seem', 'better', 'was', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Wow', 'Big', 'difference', 'dopey-eyed', 'long-haired', 'little', 'boy', 'first', 'film', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'tougher', 'someone', 'girl', 'could', 'definitely', 'fall', 'love', 'Accordingly', 'reputable', 'sources', 'i.e', 'friends', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'bad', 'Jacob', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'love', 'triangle', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'book', 'were', 'rooting', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'get', 'together', 'whole', 'time', 'Taylor', 'L.', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'changed', 'everything', 'Suddenly', 'more', 'women', 'are', 'rooting', 'Jacob', 'win', 'Bella', 'heart', 'ditch', 'sullen', 'broody', 'weirdly', 'pale', 'Edward', 'Not', 'mention', 'body', 'Totally', 'lickable', 'Good', 'news', 'ladies', 'werewolves', 'are', 'shirtless', 'basically', 'whole', 'movie', 'When', 'Edward', 'chest', 'end', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'compare.My', 'second', 'reason', 'watching', 'movie', 'joy', 'seeing', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Bella', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'being', 'schooled', 'acting', '15-year-old', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'overpower', 'everyone', 'screen', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Now', 'scary', 'vampire', 'brooding', 'scary', 'looks', 'down', 'pat', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'who', 'played', 'Edward', 'sister', 'movie', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'Spunky', 'fun', 'even', 'vampire', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'type', 'girl', 'would', 'believe', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Jacob', 'Black', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'with.I', 'guess', 'am', 'telling', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'found', 'rating', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon', '4', 'star', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Netflix', 'fell', 'love', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'play', '16-year-old', 'love', 'first', 'crush', 'awkwardness', 'hope', 'along', 'balanced', 'great', 'responsibility', 'protect', 'tribe', 'vampires', 'area', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'werewolf', 'transformations', 'vampire', 'powers', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'moments', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'held', 'back', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'depressingly', 'dull', 'selfish', 'girl', 'who', 'found', 'distinctly', 'unlovable', 'clue', 'why', '2', 'such', 'hot', 'supernatural', 'guys', 'chasing', 'literally', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'less-than-most-beautiful-man-I-have-ever-seen', 'supposed', 'be', 'according', 'author', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'good', 'dark', 'brooding', 'look', 'lead', 'roles', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'standout']",N/A

It's a small improvement, but an improvement nonetheless, and hovers slightly above its predecessor with a change in directors (Chris Weitz), improved digital effects and the addition of exotic shooting locations (Italy).This particular chapter of the Twilight Saga has Bella (Stewart) celebrating her 18th birthday with Edward (Pattinson) having to fend off an attack on her from his own brethren.  The incident is a defining moment with Edward realizing that Bella's inclusion in the Cullen clan is impractical and dangerous, and he abruptly departs Forks with his ""family"", never to return.  He leaves a disconsolate Bella in his wake, a sad lump of flesh who wiles away the first few months of his absence staring silently out her bedroom window watching the seasons go by.  Once she takes the company of her good friend Jacob Black (Lautner) she finds herself lifted but it doesn't stop her from being reckless, her conscience generating visions of Edward that persuade her from endangering herself.  While helping her restore motorcycles better suited for the junkyard, Jacob makes his feelings known but when she gently rebuffs him, she soon finds him aloof, guarded and keeping company with people he previously denounced.  She is confounded by this, along with rumors she is hearing about a giant bear attacking and killing people in the nearby forests.  Once she has her own sighting of this massive creature and discovers that the vampire Victoria is hunting her, she comes to find that the small isolated wilderness that is Forks is teeming with supernatural beings for the better and the worse.Melissa Rosenberg is on board again for the screenplay and like Stephenie Meyer's book, the script draws small parallels with Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", in particular Edward's Romeo-esque suicidal visit to the Volturi, his allegorical apothecaries.  All of the actors from the first film reprise their roles and the following are brief assessments on the repeat performances of the main players (minor players are not worth mentioning):Pattinson:  Still brooding but it's toned down a bit.  Unfortunately, he's nearly devoid of emotion now and I find all that queer squinting he does distracting - were the set lights too bright or what?Stewart:  How did this girl get acting work?  She's flatter than an ironing board when it comes to emoting.  Then again, Bella herself is pretty flat, so I guess it's a good fit.  Blah...Jacob:  Still a breath of fresh air and he only becomes more interesting in his pursuit of Bella.  And boy did that largely-female audience REACT when he first took his shirt off - several delighted gasps reverberated across the auditorium (I confess my bosom heaved as well).  Lautner really buffed up for this film (he spent the majority of it shirtless, something that will satisfy any heterosexual woman or gay man) and Edward pales (haha) in comparison to his impressive physicality.  I couldn't help but again think of what an idiot Bella is for passing him up.(Can you tell I'm ""Team Jacob""?  Now I just need to go to Burger King and get my water bottle.  Represent!)Getting back to the screenplay, Rosenberg doesn't change it up much and it shows - the YA crowd at my screening tittered at every lame joke while I was either stone-faced or rolling my eyes, particularly at the movie's more maudlin moments (and boy-howdy, it's awash in those).  The film does boast some gorgeous cinematography, showing off once again the best parts of Washington and Oregon and includes some fabulous aerial shots of the Italian countryside.  My eyes were wide as Bella ran through a sea of red robes parading through the narrow streets of a clustered town - the stark contrast of the yellowed and ancient architecture of the city against the crimson cloaks of the revelers was breathtaking.As far as the digital effects, the transformation of the Quileutes from man to beast is thrilling as well as Edward's ghostly manifestations; I especially loved the phantasm that dissipated like squid ink while Bella was beneath the briny surface of the Pacific after diving off a steep cliff.  The climactic battle with the Volturi is disappointing, consisting of a lot of ""whooshing"" and slow-mo; Fanning (who looked beautiful despite her demonic red eyes) doesn't get to show enough formidability as the malevolent telekinetic Jane and though Michael Sheene plays Aro exactly as he is written, it's far more embarrassing to watch this character in action than it is to read it.Bottom line: Let's face it - you won't go see this unless you're a total escapist fantasy nut (with or without a penchant for romanticizing the supernatural), a fan of the books or a tween who loves some up close and personal shots of gorgeous guys knee-deep in melodrama.  If none of that is your forte, then don't waste your time or money - you'll feel like someone dared you to imbibe a whole can of EZ Cheez with no reward.

1224141,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001OQCV56,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","The second chapter of the horror/fantasy/romance Twilight saga is every bit as great as the first.  The obvious development in the story is that it's no longer exclusively the Bella (Kristen Stewart)/Edward (Robert Pattinson) love story, but the Jacob (Taylor Lautner)/Bella/Edward love triangle.  The other major development though, is that it's beginning to move from a localized story centering of a few main characters in a corner of Seattle, to a much larger, globe-spanning tapestry that brings in new characters (Alice, played by Ashley Greene, also gets a larger part, which is welcome) that delves into the larger world of the vampires and the werewolves and their history.Both of these developments are set in place by the departure of the Cullen family from Seattle early in the movie, a move set in place by Edward, after another incident where Bella's life is put in danger.  Feeling that their very prescence is a danger to her, the Cullens leave, and Bella is alone and devastated.  She's also unprotected when Victoria and Laurent - two of the vampires from the first Twilight, who, unlike the Cullen clan, feed on human blood - return to the area seeking revenge for the death of one of their compatriots in the first movie.  Or at least, it would seem she's unprotected - here's where the wolf legends mentioned briefly in the first Twilight start coming into play.Bella develops a deeper friendship with Jacob, and begins to come out of the shell she entered into when the Cullens left.  It's obvious early on that Jacob wants them to be more than friends, and while Bella seems to have at least some of the same feelings for him, she's torn by her enduring loyalty to the departed Edward.  She then realizes that Edward continues to watch over her from afar, appearing to her when she's in danger, which prompts her to seek out increasingly more dangerous situations, making the already threatening status with Victoria and Laurent more deadly.  The development of the relationship between Bella and Jacob is never forced or rushed and progresses naturally over time, although Bella still remains reluctant to get too close.In the later stages of the movie the action increases and the scale of the tapestry does likewise with the introduction of the Volturi, the Italy-based vampire aristocracy that maintains an informal control over the vampire race worldwide, and whose own ruling elite wield incredible powers.  The acting is excellent, and Kristen Stewart particularly impresses with an award-worthy performance.  She captures Bella's peculiar mix of shy awkwardness and feisty boldness, and her fierce capacity for total love, perfectly.New Moon is imaginative, visually gorgeous, and emotionally powerful.  Touches at least briefly (and in some cases indepth) on a vast array of movie genres - fantasy, romance, horror, mystery, drama, adventure, thriller - and does good credit to each of them.

1224149,A2EUSVSWBEONLY,B001OQCV56,"tahnee ""tahnee toft""","[0, 2]","This is the secend movie the first one was TwilightYou need to watch Twilight to understand thisHere is some thing about Twilight and The Twilight Saga New MoonThe big-screen adaptation of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's bestselling vampire romance, is aimed squarely at its key demographic: teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment. Such a prince is more fascinating than frightening to new girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who moves to the rainy-gray town of Forks, Wash., to live with her dad (Billy Burke), the local sheriff who's puzzled by a series of ""animal attacks."" On her first day at school, Bella appears to (visibly) nauseate her lab partner, Edward (Robert Pattinson). Turns out the scent of her blood is this vampire's ""brand of heroin,"" and his struggle not to kill her causes an irresistible pull toward her. Whether he's attracted for the normal reasons or because she smells especially sweet to him is vague in the book and even less clear on-screen; nonetheless, Bella falls hopelessly in love with Edward, which sets her on a dangerous path when a few nomad vampires show up in town, one particularly keen on tracking the human. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen), Twilight is full of funny moments--not all of which are intentional--and the casting, from Stewart to Bella's self-absorbed friend Jessica (Anna Kendrick) is spot-on. The weakest link, unfortunately, is Pattinson. While he certainly looks the part, his Edward could have used an extra injection of testosterone (Pattinson, who is British, used James Dean as a model for his American accent). In scenes where he growls about the temptation to kill those who would harm Bella, or flitting around a forest warning her how dangerous he is, he comes off more like a whimpering puppy than a debonair monster. The good news is, his chemistry with Stewart (particularly in their big kissing scene) is palpable, which, let's face it, is really what matters to Twilight fans most. --Ellen A. KimOn the DVDThe special features for Twilight kick off with an audio commentary with director Catherine Hardwicke and stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. There's some mumbling and groaning from Stewart (one gets the impression that Stewart is quite similar to her reserved character in the film), some standard behind-the-scenes observations from Hardwicke, and a lot of awkward self-deprecating remarks from Pattinson (of their big kiss, he opines: ""This is quite difficult 'cause I have a really flat head, and so it's quite difficult to get a correct angle.""). What's funny is Pattinson stumping Hardwicke with some basic plot questions, like ""Why doesn't James just kill [Bella when she's packing at her house]?"" While Hardwicke and Stewart attempt to answer, Pattinson doesn't appear satisfied. The deleted and extended scenes include an additional dream-sequence kiss (rightly cut because it took away from the buildup to their first kiss) and more footage of Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre). The seven-part documentary is a pretty thorough look at the development of the film, including stunts, special effects, and the involvement of author Stephenie Meyer. Another featurette looks at the Comic-Con frenzy; however, it spends no time on how the actors were cast, which would have been fun for fans who did all their own mental casting while reading the books. Also included: three music videos and trailers. --Ellen A. Kim Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doesn't expect much when she moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, until she meets the mysterious and handsome Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson)--a boy who's hiding a dark secret: he's a vampire. As their worlds and hearts collide, Edward must battle the bloodlust raging inside him as well as a coterie of undead that would make Bella their prey. Based on the #1 New York Times best-selling sensation by Stephenie Meyer, Twilight adds a dangerous twist to the classic story of star-crossed lovers.New Moon, the second in Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster teen-fiction saga adapted for film, is stronger than its predecessor, Twilight. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass), taking the helm from Catherine Hardwicke, brings a lighter, more assured touch to the sequel, which continues the star-crossed love story of mortal Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson). Incidentally, Edward is absent for most of the film; after an accident on Bella's birthday reminds Edward that her life is always at risk when he's around, he chooses to abandon her, sending her into a deep depression. The only person who helps her heal her broken heart is her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a member of the Quileute tribe who, as he grows taller, beefier, and more aggressive (with less clothing), comes to realize he's not entirely human either. But even his love for Bella doesn't prevent her from throwing herself in the path of danger, because that's the only time she can see visions of Edward. One such fateful misunderstanding sends Edward into the coven of the Volturi (a sort of vampire Mafia, if you will), where the most dangerous vampires hold both Edward and Bella's fate in their cold, dark hands. Much of New Moon rests on the shoulders of Lautner, so scrawny in Twilight, who famously packed on the muscle to avoid getting recast. He's very nearly successful in carrying the load, but the cheese-tastic beefcake scenes disservice him, and Jacob and Bella's complicated friendship stumbles on its way to any kind of love triangle. Some of that blame lies with Stewart, who understandably holds her emotions close to her chest but reveals much too little (c'mon, even an angsty girl has to be a little joyful in the arms of two different hunks). As is with the book, the film is just a bridge between sagas, so the plot drags and not a lot happens. Fortunately, while Twilight was trapped in its own self-consciousness, the wobbly-legged cast seems to have found stronger footing in New Moon; the jokes come faster, the writing (by Melissa Rosenberg, who also scribed Twilight) is a hair wittier. (Even Pattinson seems more comfortable in Edward's skin.) The Volturi, highlighted by Michael Sheen's Aro and Dakota Fanning's Jane, also make an all-too-brief impression, but at least there's more to look forward to when Eclipse, the third installment, is released. --Ellen A. Kim In the second chapter of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling Twilight series, the romance between mortal Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) grows more intense as ancient secrets threaten to destroy them. When Edward leaves in an effort to keep Bella safe, she tests fate in increasingly reckless ways in order to glimpse her love once more. But when she's saved from the brink by her friend, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), Bella will uncover mysteries of the supernatural world that will put her in more peril than ever before.",5,The

But unfortunately what we have to sit through is not a so-called vampire story, but a wishy-washy zzzzzz.....snoozefest. I love films/books of all genres....thrillers, horror, romance, adventure, etc....and this film was way below my expectations. Maybe if I was a 13 year old year, I was expected to drool over all the lead actors/actresses squinty eyes, moodiness and constant whining. Can't say I remember too many people like that in High School, and if I did, they were probably medicated.But, beyond all of the ridiulousness (is this a word?), how the hell did Bella & Alice rush to ITALY from SEATTLE just like that to save Edward from committing suicide? The movie just has them driving in a car. Maybe Burt Reynolds in a black Trans Am could have done it in less than 28 hours. I pretty positive a plane should have been involved, and not look like a Three Stooges skit.

1224161,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001OQCV56,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 15]","I liked ""Twilight"", the first film better. Perhaps because it was new and we didn't know how this world would translate visually yet. It isn't a huge stretch to jump from author Meyer's written page to the visual screen, she does what a huge number of writers do today and writes her books to be made into films. The first film introduced us to everything we were familiar with in the books so it was interesting, new and unusual.I think ""New Moon"" suffers from the same problem I felt the first two Harry Potter films suffered from. The director of each film is so faithful to the source material; he doesn't add any artistic flourishes of his own. After the enormous success of ""Twilight"", director Catherine Hardwicke left/ was fired because she protested the shooting schedule the studio was imposing on her. Chris Weitz, the director of ""American Pie"", ""About a Boy"" and ""The Golden Compass"" stepped in and took the reigns. But the difference between the two is both subtle and great. Because he is used to directing big budget films, he is able to handle the task of shooting them on an accelerated schedule, but he doesn't quite know (or care?) about how to get the best performances from his relatively young and inexperienced stars. He also doesn't (have time to?) add any artistic flourishes of his own, to make the book really come alive on the silver screen.He also directed ""Eclipse"", the third installment, which is due next summer.Filmmaking is a visual medium and there are frequently problems with adapting other mediums to this huge canvas. Often, plays seem 'stagey' when adapted to the big screen; two actors have a conversation, one leaves and another enters, continuing the story. When a good filmmaker gets their hands on a play and adapts it for the big screen, they are able to 'open it up' and create a dynamic new universe for the story, making us forget it was a play in the first place. Books are often problematic because a well-written book usually explores the characters' inner feelings and their thinking. What is making them say or do what they are doing? How do you translate that to the screen? Well, Meyer does that for the filmmaker by having her characters talk about their feelings all the time.If you have read the book, the movie will seem very familiar to you and a certain amount of this is expected and necessary. The fans have to be able to recognize key elements and we have to get to the right point for the third film to pick up the story. But because it is so faithful to the book, ""New Moon"" seems a little boring. And because the actors aren't great at their craft, at least not yet, the film quickly resembles a teenaged version of a television soap opera.Bella (Kristen Stewart) is trying to get back to a normal life and returns to school in Forks. Edward (Robert Pattison) is at her side every moment, much to the consternation of her friends. Then, Alice (Ashley Greene), Edward's 'sister' asks Bella to come over one night for a surprise birthday party. Bella reluctantly agrees to avoid hurting Alice's feelings. Bella is becoming more and more determined to become a vampire; Edward was made a vampire at seventeen and Bella doesn't want to grow old without him. An accident at the party causes Edward and the Cullen's to leave town, for Bella's protection. But Bella becomes deeply depressed and soon finds solace in the company of her friend, Jacob (Taylor Lautner), an Indian who is handy with cars. Soon, it becomes apparent the Jacob has some issues to deal with and Bella becomes reckless as she starts to seek thrills that will help her feel alive.Bella has a couple of reasons for wanting to become a vampire; she has fallen madly in love with Edward and wants to spend the rest of her life with him and because he is pretty much immortal, she doesn't want to age because she feels he will not want to be with her when she is thirty, forty, fifty, older when he will always look like he is seventeen. Both of these messages are not exactly enlightened, especially when the main audience for these books and films are pre-teen girls who are usually already dealing with self-esteem issues. Thankfully, much of Edward's being seems to be to dispel these theories. He doesn't want her to be a vampire because he knows there are many things she will miss out on. And he frequently states he is so in love with her that he won't care what she might look like in the future. This is nice to hear, but as it constantly comes up, it becomes boring very quickly.She also wants to become a vampire because there is a female vampire hunting for her, to extract revenge for Edward killing her lover, another vampire who wanted to kill Bella. Apparently, it is hard for vampires to kill one another, although Edward was able to do so in ""Twilight"". But Bella believes that by becoming a vampire, many of the threats she faces, as a human will go away.Much of the film, as the book, is about the relationship between Bella and Jacob. Jacob finds his body changing in strange ways and soon realizes he is a werewolf. Werewolves and vampires don't get along, so Bella now faces another problem. Can she juggle her relationship with Jacob and her love for Edward?Eventually, the entire story shifts to a small medieval village in Italy and Bella and Alice race to the town square to stop Edward from revealing himself to the many humans who have assembled for a festival honoring the mythical vampires who control the town, the Volturi. If Edward exposes himself, and their secret, the Volturi will have no recourse but to kill Edward. You know, this story development played a lot better in the book. In the film, Alice and Bella have a realization and the next moment they are speeding through the Italian countryside in a yellow Ferrari. In the film, this development seems like a wild stretch.Once they meet the Volturi, we are introduced to Jane (Dakota Fanning) and Aro (Michael Sheen) among others, two ancient vampires with amazing powers who oversee all other vampires in the world.All of the actors are good, none are great. Robert Pattison almost seems to be smirking through his lines, like he can't believe how corny they are. Believe it. Sure, he's good looking and plays Edward like James Dean might have if he had played the role, but he doesn't really go to any depths as or for the character. Everything is on the surface. And this seems like an okay fit for the film. And clearly the millions of tween girls who have already seen the film doesn't seem to care.Kristen Stewart is also okay as Bella. Throughout much of the film, Bella is either madly depressed or trying to be madly rebellious and independent. This second idea might work better if we didn't see Edward pop up as her conscience every time she tried to do something dangerous. It makes her seem like she can only live if she is in a relationship with Edward. Not exactly a great message to present to all of the tweens in the audience. ""You are only good and productive when you are in a relationship with your boyfriend."" But to be fair, the movie can't be faulted for this alone. This is the main idea behind the books as well.Taylor Lautner has the most complex role as Jacob, the younger member of the Quillite tribe who becomes friends with Bella. Throughout the film, Jacob goes through some changes wreaking havoc on his life and strains his relationship with Bella. He has the most to do, the most to show, the most to emote, and this makes his character the most complex, the most interesting.The rest of the cast is basically background for the romantic entanglements of these three characters. Even Edward's ""family"", the Cullen's, have virtually no screen time. This makes all of these actors almost non-existent. The good thing about this is that most of them barely register and this is a good thing based on their acting ability.""New Moon"" is already a worldwide hit and the next installment ""Eclipse"" has already been made and will be released next summer. But that doesn't mean the movie is great, only that it has tapped into a fan base willing and able to propel it to blockbuster status.",2,Two By The Book,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,8143,"['liked',

I can appreciate it, but I guess being a romantic and wanting Bella & Edward to be together makes this installment of Twilight less satisfying. Its endearing to see how her relationship with Jacob grows, however, it makes me see Bella as someone willing to settle for less than she wants, and also a bit &#34;needy&#34; in the fact that she is willing to selfishly lead Jacob on & use him as a &#34;placeholder&#34; for the spot left empty by Edward. Then, we are sympathetic to Jake, because she drops him as soon as Edward is back in the picture. Its still very entertaining, but at the same time, Bella seems obsessed and self-absorbed at anyone's [namely Jake's] expense.

Realizing that Bella will never be safe as long as he's around, Edward  makes the difficult decision to leave his beloved behind shortly after her 18th birthday. Reeling from her loss, Bella embraces self-destruction after being comforted by Edward's image during a moment of mortal peril. But as heavy-hearted as Bella may be, her old friend Jacob distracts her from her sorrows by helping her renovate a weather-beaten motorbike. When Bella encounters a former adversary with a sizable grudge, she's rescued from harm at the last second by pack of enormous, ferocious wolves. Subsequently delving into the history of the Quileutes, Bella discovers the secrets of Jacob's tribe while looking forward to a reunion with Edward that may have deadly consequences.

1224171,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B001OQCV56,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[2, 4]","The world of `Twilight' has become a phenomenon. Like other fantasy/romance novels this story has brought the world of Vampires to a whole new generation. Unfortunately, while it is having a positive impact not everyone will agree.The second installment of the `Twilight' saga, `New Moon' expands the world and romance of Bella and Edward (The Emo Vampire) Bella now suffers the pain of losing the man she loves, because he feels his world is too dangerous for her. Now, that someone has exposed Edward as Vampires a tribe of Werewolves has appeared and apparently there is a treaty between the two races to make sure that things are kept in a safe balance. The scale is now starting to tip because Bella's best friend Jacob Black is a Werewolf, and he wants Bella to be more than just a friend. You just have to love those bizarre love triangle stories.Now, the first movie I have to admit was not good. The special effects were something out of a CW drama, the acting was bland and the story itself was just way too emo for me. Surely there would be some improvements in those departments, especially with a bigger budget. `New Moon' just reeks with failure; you need a mop and bucket to clean it all up. I would love to point out a few good points, but since there are more bad than good we will save them to play redeeming qualities. First of all the script...it was as if it was written by a first grade English class. The dialogue was so cheesy and pathetic I was throwing up inside of my mouth at points. Look, I do appreciate romance in a film, but when you put no efforts in to the romance especially by using such horrible actors to portray it just doesn't come off as believable. The acting was horrible, the people chosen to play these characters apparently felt there was no reason to even look back at the first film and work out the kinks. The roles were either overacted or under acted there was no in between at all. The only thing they improved was the lighting on Kristen Stewart so she didn't look like someone dumped a whole pouch of flower on her head. Stewart just doesn't know how to be emotional, she can't even cry and make it look believable. Robert Pattenson.....you know...I can't say anything. He should just be thanking whatever God he has faith in that he will be able to live of this money for the next 10 years. Now, Ana Kendrick...I like her and I think she was fantastic in `Up In The Air' She was cast all wrong, because she is not a girly girl. She would have been a much better choice for Bella than Stewart because she probably would have been able to do a much better acting job. Taylor Lautner...let's face it he is just there for his body. The tweens just went to see him take his shirt off. Also they couldn't even improve on the special effects. Now that there are werewolves in the film you think they could make them look a little more real. Well, I have to say the wolves looked pretty life like but the transformation looked cartoonish. Take a look at a film like `The Incredible Hulk' Edward Nortans transformation looked much more real and believable than these werewolves. Now here is the part that really pissed me off. The plot of this movie is so weak and it really didn't go anywhere. Throughout the movie I was just waiting for something to happen...no climactic action sequence so major turning point in the story nothing. The whole movie was just Bella crying and trying to kill herself to a very, very emo soundtrack. The finally when the turning point finally shows its face (A very weak and predictable one I might add) the movie stops!!! So basically I just sat through a bunch of jumbled plot points with no development only to be told sorry now you have to watch the next movie!  Ok, the good parts about this movie were two things. Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen did a fantastic acting job and Dakota finally put that creepy face of hers to good use. Michael Sheen came of as a very creepy character with excellent use of dialogue. They should have expanded on these characters a little more because even though I know they will show up in the further installments some more development would be essential.Again, I saw this movie for free so it wasn't such a loss. Just my time was taken away, and I guess that is my fault to a degree because I didn't have to sit through it. But, the real reason that I saw it was just to see if maybe just maybe a good movie could have been created here. Since it was a failed attempt I got to write this review...that was the best part of all.",1,The Emo...it's spreading!

Written very plainly there are things to like and dislike about the books. As for the film, I must say that I actually prefer New Moon to Twilight. I was happy to note that there are many similarites between the movie and book and for the most part, they stuck to the script. Many films don't. Kristen Stewart as Bella remains the weakest link. She is, as in the book, annoying, shallow and just plain odd at times. Robert Pattinson as Edward does not have much screen time here and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Though I love his character in the books, and his portrayal in the film, I wasn't missing him terribly this time around. New Moon, I think, is the strongest of the series, and it actually WORKS without Edward in the picture for half the film. I thought the director did a fine job of mixing him into scenes even when he wasn't supposed to 'be there'. Taylor Lautner as Jacob certainly has a much meatier role than in Twilight and though I am not a fan, he does a decent enough job.The effects are better this time around and I love the moody feel of the film. Twilight had this almost cool hue throughout the film where New Moon almost appears muddy. I thought it worked very well. Another huge plus is the soundtrack which is very diverse and far superior to Twilight's.New Moon is a fun movie, entertaining and nothing more. It is not just for tweens or anyone else under a certain age. At the theater, there were more people over the age of 25 than under. People who dislike the series for whatever reason just need to chill and realise that there are plenty of worse films out there and no one is putting Twilight or New Moon on a pedestal.

I'm A) male and B) over 16, so I might not even have a right to an opinion.

I appreciate the fact that girls need movies too, and generally seem to be an under-served clientele.

1224186,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001OQCV56,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","I have read all the books in the series and frankly felt New Moon was the weakest (my favorite is Eclipse). I wasn't sure how Chris Weitz was going to adapt the book for the big screen but it exceeded my expectations. I usually prefer the books to the movie adaptations but in this case, I actually preferred the movie. New Moon sees Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) turning 18, and she's none too pleased about it because Edward (Robert Pattinson) is 17 and will remain forever so since he is an immortal. The fact that she's now older than Edward troubles her and Bella feels the only way to get past this is by becoming a vampire herself. Edward will have none of it as he does not wish her soul damned. So to cut a long story short - Edward breaks up with Bella and leaves Forks (the town where they live) together with the Cullens (his family). Bella sinks into a great depression, one which only 16-year-old Jacob (Taylor Lautner)is able to help her through.Bella realizes that though Edward is physically gone, they share a strong psychic connection as Edward seems to sense when Bella is in danger and pops up as a sort of vision to warn her off. This compels Bella to indulge in risky endeavors such as approaching strange men, going on a bike ride, and even cliff diving. There's also a very real threat from renegade vampire Victoria who is bent on killing Bella. In the meantime, Jacob goes through some personal issues as he is compelled to become part of a pack on the reservation. Little does Bella suspect the true nature of this 'pack' until much later, and this has important repercussions on their friendship and future dealings with the Cullens.I felt this second installment was a vast improvement over ""Twilight"" - firstly, the acting is much more credible and natural. Kirsten Stewart has made Bella more than just a cardboard character, and unlike the character of Bella in the books, here viewers get to see how Bella processes things and emotes, unlike the books. Taylor Lautner was the most compelling actor in this movie - he credibly portrays his anguish at not being able to get Bella to love him as she does Edward, and at the same time, his confusion over his new role and identity. There's not much of Robert Pattinson's Edward in this installment, though the scenes he appears in are quite well-done (he just seems to flinch so much that I found it quite annoying to be honest). The other secondary characters are all there as in the first and do a good job in their respective roles.The cinematography is excellent, effectively capturing the ethereal beauty of Forks with its magnificent forests and coastline, as well as the beauty of the Italian countryside (when Alice and Bella go to see the Volturi). The special effects were amazing - the transformation from human to werewolf, and the scenes where Victoria is hunting and trying to evade capture by the werewolves are all credibly done (even my husband who is not into the series loved it). All in all, I felt director Chris Weitz has done a good job in adapting the book to the big screen and I can't wait for his interpretation of Eclipse!",4,An improvement over Twilight,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3129,"['have', 'read', 'books', 'series', 'frankly', 'felt', 'New', 'Moon', 'was', 'weakest', 'favorite', 'Eclipse', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'was', 'going', 'adapt', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'usually', 'prefer', 'books', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'case', 'actually', 'preferred', 'movie', 'New', 'Moon', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'turning', '18', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', '17', 'will', 'remain', 'forever', 'so', 'immortal', 'fact', 'now', 'older', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'becoming', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'not', 'wish', 'soul', 'damned', 'So', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Edward', 'up', 'Bella', 'Forks', 'town', 'where', 'live', 'together', 'Cullens', 'family', 'Bella', 'great', 'depression', 'one', 'only', '16-year-old', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'able', 'help', 'through.Bella', 'Edward', 'physically', 'gone', 'share', 'strong', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Edward', 'sense', 'when', 'Bella', 'danger', 'up', 'sort', 'vision', 'warn', 'off', 'Bella', 'indulge', 'risky', 'endeavors', 'such', 'approaching', 'strange', 'men', 'going', 'bike', 'ride', 'even', 'cliff', 'diving', 'also', 'very', 'real', 'threat', 'renegade', 'vampire', 'Victoria', 'who', 'bent', 'killing', 'Bella', 'meantime', 'Jacob', 'personal', 'issues', 'compelled', 'become', 'part', 'pack', 'reservation', 'Little', 'Bella', 'suspect', 'true', 'nature', ""'pack"", 'much', 'later', 'important', 'repercussions', 'friendship', 'future', 'dealings', 'Cullens.I', 'felt', 'second', 'installment', 'was', 'vast', 'improvement', 'Twilight', 'firstly', 'acting', 'much', 'more', 'credible', 'natural', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'made', 'Bella', 'more', 'just', 'cardboard', 'character', 'character', 'Bella', 'books', 'here', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Bella', 'things', 'emotes', 'books', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'was', 'most', 'compelling', 'actor', 'movie', 'credibly', 'anguish', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'Bella', 'love', 'Edward', 'same', 'time', 'confusion', 'new', 'role', 'identity', 'not', 'much', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'installment', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'well-done', 'just', 'flinch', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'quite', 'annoying', 'be', 'honest', 'other', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'all', 'there', 'first', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'respective', 'roles.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'effectively', 'capturing', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'Forks', 'magnificent', 'forests', 'coastline', 'as', 'well', 'beauty', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'when', 'Alice', 'Bella', 'go', 'see', 'Volturi', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'human', 'werewolf', 'scenes', 'where', 'Victoria', 'hunting', 'trying', 'evade', 'capture', 'werewolves', 'are', 'credibly', 'done', 'even', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'series', 'loved', 'felt', 'director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'adapting', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'interpretation', 'Eclipse']",N/A
