898660,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0008ENI20,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[28, 29]","Ben has a car accident, and wakes up after 7 days in a coma believing his wife was killed in the crash, and his mental and emotional disturbance over her death is interwoven with the murder of a famous pop singer. The plot is a little muddled and one has to see this rather dull film twice to completely follow the thread of it. Staying awake the first time around can be a bit of a challenge, as ""Trauma"" is full of scenes of Ben as he meanders about in a delusional daze. Jobless and looking like a vagrant, he shuffles through his clippings of the pop star, and fiddles around with his ants and spiders. ""Trauma"" is not an easy film to watch, not because it is all that disturbing, but because it is boring. A recent film that can be compared to it is ""The Machinist,"" which is far creepier and disquieting to view.Colin Firth is excellent as the delusional Ben, as is Mena Suvari  as Charlotte, the gentle, trusting soul that befriends him. Other good actors in the cast include Tommy Flanagan (""Braveheart"") as Ben's buddy Tommy, and Brenda Fricker has a small part as a clairvoyant. Directed by Marc Evans, with some clever cinematography by John Mathiesen, no amount of spooky sounds in the soundtrack or mysterious elements can save this film and make it even mildly interesting. Recommended only for avid Firth fans, otherwise this one is a dud. No DVD extras are included other than Spanish subtitles, and total running time is 94 minutes.",3,Denial and Self Delusion,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,1449,"['Ben', 'car', 'accident', 'up', '7', 'days', 'coma', 'believing', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'crash', 'mental', 'emotional', 'disturbance', 'death', 'interwoven', 'murder', 'famous', 'pop', 'singer', 'plot', 'little', 'muddled', 'one', 'see', 'rather', 'dull', 'film', 'twice', 'completely', 'follow', 'thread', 'Staying', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'challenge', 'Trauma', 'full', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'delusional', 'daze', 'Jobless', 'looking', 'vagrant', 'clippings', 'pop', 'star', 'fiddles', 'ants', 'spiders', 'Trauma', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'not', 'disturbing', 'boring', 'recent', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'Machinist', 'far', 'creepier', 'disquieting', 'view.Colin', 'Firth', 'excellent', 'delusional', 'Ben', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Charlotte', 'gentle', 'trusting', 'soul', 'Other', 'good', 'actors', 'cast', 'include', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', 'Braveheart', 'Ben', 'buddy', 'Tommy', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'small', 'part', 'clairvoyant', 'Directed', 'Marc', 'Evans', 'clever', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Mathiesen', 'amount', 'spooky', 'sounds', 'soundtrack', 'mysterious', 'elements', 'can', 'save', 'film', 'make', 'even', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'Recommended', 'only', 'avid', 'Firth', 'fans', 'otherwise', 'one', 'dud', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'other', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'total', 'running', 'time', '94', 'minutes']",Trauma

898662,AJJBIXVL2U8FP,B0008ENI20,"Benjamin Mcnully ""Movie Idiot""","[4, 5]","Trauma is a movie that my friend calls 'trailer movies'. In so much as it was like watching an hour-and-a-half trailer. And the dvd isn't worth your while if your a lover of special features.The story is pretty nifty in theory, but less so in application. The main character, Ben (Colin Firth) Takes a blow to the head in a crash that kills his wife. He awakes in the hospital to his wife being dead. He begins to grieve, but at the same time he finds himself obsessed with and suspected for the murder of a popstar. How 'Perfect Blue' of them... After a while a mysterious turn of events unfold, as he see's his wife in several places, and thinks she may not have died. With his head injury, is he really seeing things, or blocking out what really happened?The story is also the movies shortcoming. In his search for truth, Ben wanders around, looking distraught. Very british, eh?But the story never really speeds up or even ties up loose ends. I suppose the disrector wanted us to draw our own conclusions, and I have mine, but my parents were confused to point of arguing with me about what it meant. So, if YOU'RE slow or don't like slow (and confusing) movies, stray away from Trauma.Onto the disc:The picture quality was subpar at best. It was combination of british television (think mr. bean or any brit sitcom) and murky darks. The night scenes in his house are blue like underworld, and the exterior night scenes are red with street lights.The sound quality is mediocre at best. The music sometimes drowns out the vocals, and other times the music nowhere to be found. The dialog is generaly low and I had to watch it with subtitles. Which is the perfect way to transition into:Special Features! That's right, features, as in two. Trauma features a spanish language track, and a host of trailers from the movie company (five including it's own...) and that's it. Nothing. In conclusion, this disc lost a star for special features, a half for the quality and one for poor story/directing. So... two and a half stars over all, with a possible half for good acting on Firth and Suvari's part.",3,Firth and Last...,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2100,"['Trauma', 'movie', 'friend', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'watching', 'hour-and-a-half', 'trailer', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'worth', 'lover', 'special', 'features.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'theory', 'less', 'so', 'application', 'main', 'character', 'Ben', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'blow', 'head', 'crash', 'wife', 'hospital', 'wife', 'being', 'dead', 'grieve', 'same', 'time', 'obsessed', 'suspected', 'murder', 'popstar', 'How', ""'Perfect"", 'Blue', 'while', 'mysterious', 'turn', 'events', 'unfold', 'see', 'wife', 'several', 'places', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'died', 'head', 'injury', 'really', 'seeing', 'things', 'blocking', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'story', 'also', 'movies', 'shortcoming', 'search', 'truth', 'Ben', 'wanders', 'looking', 'distraught', 'Very', 'british', 'eh', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'even', 'ties', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'suppose', 'disrector', 'wanted', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'have', 'mine', 'parents', 'were', 'confused', 'point', 'arguing', 'what', 'meant', 'So', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'slow', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slow', 'confusing', 'movies', 'stray', 'away', 'Trauma.Onto', 'disc', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'subpar', 'best', 'was', 'combination', 'british', 'television', 'think', 'mr.', 'bean', 'brit', 'sitcom', 'murky', 'darks', 'night', 'scenes', 'house', 'are', 'blue', 'underworld', 'exterior', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'red', 'street', 'lights.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'best', 'music', 'sometimes', 'out', 'vocals', 'other', 'times', 'music', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'dialog', 'generaly', 'low', 'had', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'Which', 'perfect', 'way', 'transition', 'Special', 'Features', 'right', 'features', 'two', 'Trauma', 'spanish', 'language', 'track', 'host', 'trailers', 'movie', 'company', 'five', 'including', 'own', 'Nothing', 'conclusion', 'disc', 'lost', 'star', 'special', 'features', 'half', 'quality', 'one', 'poor', 'story/directing', 'So', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'possible', 'half', 'good', 'acting', 'Firth', 'Suvari', 'part']",Trauma

898666,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0008ENI20,Grady Harp,"[23, 24]","TRAUMA is one of those films that invokes mixed responses from audiences depending on their expectations: it seems to polarize people into love/hate categories.  While not a great movie, TRAUMA has the courage to pose a storyline that is more involved with the interior aspects of a mind altered by physical events.  We are asked to observe the world through the eyes of a battered brain which happens to belong to a man with a tattered past. If linear stories are preferred then this is not a film to recommend.  For those viewers willing to crawl inside the malfunctioning mind, this film is mesmerizing and full of rewarding moments.Ben (Colin Firth) is seen in the opening flashbacks driving a car at night with his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris).  There is a car crash and Ben awakens from a coma in a hospital, convinced that Elisa is dead.  He wanders the hospital, drawn to the morgue where the caretaker (Cornelius Booth) enhances the mystery of the place.  Ben learns from the TV room that a famous singer Lauren Parris (Alison David), for whom Elisa has been a dancer, has been murdered.  His mind disintegrates and everything that follows is a m&eacute;lange of delusion mixed with bits of reality that exquisitely define how the post traumatic stress syndrome can be driven to psychosis if not recognized and treated.Ben leaves the hospital (or does he?) and continues his art career in a vast building undergoing reconstruction (a building that has been a hospital....), befriended by his mate Roland (Sean Harris) and by his landlady 'Charlotte' (Mena Suvari).  More flashbacks (mostly childhood memories) occur as Ben talks things out with a 'psychiatrist' (whose face we never see...) and during episodes with channeler Petra (Brenda Fricker) he is informed that Elisa is not dead.  Ben becomes a suspect in the murder of Lauren Parris and his chasing after evidence ultimately leads to a series of disasters, a series of metaphors and delusions, all of which find Ben sitting back in the hospital where he started.Did any of this story really happen, or was it the fabrication of a mind traumatized to the brink of breaking?  That is left for the viewer to decide.  Though plagued with some static moments and a lot of conversation buried in background music and sounds, Director Marc Evans with writer Richard Smith  take us on a suspenseful journey, made all the more bizarre by some extraordinary camera work and tremendously inventive settings.  Not a movie for everyone, but for those willing to enter the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome mind, this case study is rewarding.

Colin Firth plays a guy who is deranged and likes bugs a lot.  The bugs run across the screen.  He occasionally shows up at a construction job and manages to keep it the whole time.Oh yeah, and a pop singer died around the same time his wife died in a ""car crash"" while he was driving.He talks to himself and believes he's undergoing therapy.  Any idiot can tell right from the outset that there is no therapist.  He meets a ""medium""/empath who unbelievably gets personally involved with him; the big shocker of the movie is when he shoves a spider down her throat.  All I could think of during the scene was why an actress this talented and attractive was in such a dismal movie.Aimless, meandering scenes of him walking in London and being interrogated by detectives who know how screwed up he is and don't do anything about it until he finally shows them.  The movie is clearly meant to be depressing, and it is, but not for the reasons the director wanted it to be.The ending makes no sense.  At all.

Now I've seen Evans' follow-up, Trauma, another venture into the psychological-thriller realm with a much bigger cast, and my estimation of My Little Eye has gone down a notch with regards to the ability of those involved in its making, but compared to this mess, it's brilliant.Ben (Colin Firth) awakens from a coma after a car accident in which his wife (Naomie Harris) was killed. He tries to go on with his life, going back to work with his partner Tommy (Sons of Anarchy's Tommy Flanagan) and trying to figure out whether the cute blonde down the hall, Charlotte (American Beauty's Mena Suvari), is really as interested in him as he thinks she is. Problem is he can't quite leave the past entirely behind. You see, Ben's wife was a backup dancer for a very popular singer who's been missing since just before the car accident, and both the paparazzi and the police are very interested in Ben. And they don't believe him when he tells them he doesn't remember much before the accident. But the real bombshell comes when a hint is dropped that perhaps Ben's wife didn't die in the car accident at all, sending him on a fervent, out-of-control search for the truth.The movie has drawn a lot of comparisons to Mulholland Dr., and not without cause, but I was put more in mind of Pal Sletaune's excellent, and not nearly seen enough, thriller Naboer. Which is far better put together and makes a whole lot more sense, but all three movies have a good deal in common. Mulholland Dr. made my hundred best movies of the decade list, and Naboer ended up being the last film I cut, so you can certainly infer (correctly) that I'm a big fan of movies where you're not exactly sure what's going on. But Evans made a complete muddle of this from the get-go, and he's not a director of the caliber of Lynch (back when his movies still made sense, anyway) or Sletaune. I'm a huge fan of Tommy Flanagan's, and I usually find Firth and Harris enjoyable, but they all feel wooden here. It doesn't help that Evans is obviously linked to the whole mumblecore thing; one of the most common complaints you'll see about the film on its IMDB board is that you can't understand what Colin Firth is saying half the time (and not because of his accent). And that's from people who saw it in a theater; given the usual quality of vocal transfer to DVD, what I saw was damn near unintelligible all the way through. As well, where Lynch's film takes on the confusion by making the whole thing dreamlike, and Sletaune's by making his film from the gritty-realism angle, Evans can't seem to decide on one approach, and flips back and forth between the two. (This approach was actually done to excellent effect in a Jude Law film called The Wisdom of Crocodiles back in the nineties.) Evans also goes for the ambiguous ending, but his desire to actually explain stuff hamstrings the ambiguity, leaving the viewer with more of a ""what's going on?"" sense at the end than a burning desire to discuss it (a la Mulholland Dr.).It could have been a good movie, maybe even a great one. Instead, it feels like a pothole. * ",2,"When you're COlin Firth, sometimes you get an Oscar nod, and sometimes you get this.",1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3184,"['Trauma', 'Marc', 'Evans', '2004', 'saw', 'My', 'Little', 'Eye', 'last', 'year', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Evans', 'follow-up', 'Trauma', 'venture', 'psychological-thriller', 'realm', 'much', 'bigger', 'cast', 'estimation', 'My', 'Little', 'Eye', 'gone', 'down', 'notch', 'regards', 'ability', 'involved', 'making', 'compared', 'mess', 'brilliant.Ben', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'coma', 'car', 'accident', 'wife', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'was', 'killed', 'go', 'life', 'going', 'back', 'work', 'partner', 'Tommy', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'cute', 'blonde', 'hall', 'Charlotte', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'really', 'as', 'interested', 'Problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'leave', 'past', 'entirely', 'see', 'Ben', 'wife', 'was', 'backup', 'dancer', 'very', 'popular', 'singer', 'who', 'been', 'missing', 'just', 'car', 'accident', 'paparazzi', 'police', 'are', 'very', 'interested', 'Ben', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'accident', 'real', 'bombshell', 'when', 'hint', 'dropped', 'perhaps', 'Ben', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'sending', 'fervent', 'out-of-control', 'search', 'truth.The', 'movie', 'drawn', 'lot', 'comparisons', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'not', 'cause', 'was', 'put', 'more', 'mind', 'Pal', 'Sletaune', 'excellent', 'not', 'nearly', 'seen', 'enough', 'thriller', 'Naboer', 'Which', 'far', 'better', 'put', 'together', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'good', 'deal', 'common', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'made', 'hundred', 'best', 'movies', 'decade', 'list', 'Naboer', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'last', 'film', 'cut', 'can', 'certainly', 'infer', 'correctly', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'Evans', 'made', 'complete', 'muddle', 'get-go', 'not', 'director', 'caliber', 'Lynch', 'back', 'when', 'movies', 'still', 'made', 'sense', 'anyway', 'Sletaune', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', 'usually', 'find', 'Firth', 'Harris', 'enjoyable', 'feel', 'wooden', 'here', ""n't"", 'help', 'Evans', 'obviously', 'linked', 'whole', 'mumblecore', 'thing', 'one', 'most', 'common', 'complaints', ""'ll"", 'see', 'film', 'IMDB', 'board', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'saying', 'time', 'not', 'accent', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'theater', 'given', 'usual', 'quality', 'vocal', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'damn', 'unintelligible', 'way', 'through', 'As', 'well', 'where', 'Lynch', 'film', 'confusion', 'making', 'whole', 'thing', 'dreamlike', 'Sletaune', 'making', 'film', 'gritty-realism', 'angle', 'Evans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'one', 'approach', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'approach', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'excellent', 'effect', 'Jude', 'Law', 'film', 'called', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', 'back', 'nineties', 'Evans', 'also', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'desire', 'actually', 'explain', 'stuff', 'hamstrings', 'ambiguity', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'sense', 'end', 'burning', 'desire', 'discuss', 'la', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', '.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'even', 'great', 'one', 'Instead', 'pothole', '*']",Trauma

Colin Firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident, and John Mathieson's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting. Except that, however, `Trauma' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll. As for the film itself, it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery, drama, character study, or whatever that is worth spending my time.Colin Firth plays Ben, who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris, '28 Days Later'). In spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named Charlotte (Mena Suvari), Ben's mental condition gets worse and worse, and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares. In addition to the premise that is no longer original, the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress (or singer ... sorry I forgot which) that does not convince me at all. And the most surprising thing is, Ben might be the prime suspect of the murder! But how? and why?The script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things I pointed out above, Ben must meet a seer (played by Brenda Fricker) who says something very predictable, and his estranged sister who is just forgettable. There are also big red ants crawling all over, paintings that imply nothing special, and the CCTV surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in UK. All these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students. The difference is, probably they know what they are doing better.I simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking (which it is not), and sincerely wish that Mena Suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days.",2,Yet Another Bad Career Choice for Colin Firth Whose Excellent Acting Is the Only Merit of This Messy Film,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,2051,"['Nothing', 'wrong', 'Trauma', 'as', 'far', 'actors', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'concerned', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'compelling', 'acting', 'suffering', 'protagonist', 'who', 'survived', 'car', 'accident', 'John', 'Mathieson', 'noir-ish', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'riveting', 'however', 'Trauma', 'likely', 'leave', 'most', 'audiences', 'only', 'puzzled', 'unsatisfied', 'end', 'roll', 'film', 'giving', 'course', 'sense', 'mystery', 'drama', 'character', 'study', 'whatever', 'worth', 'spending', 'time.Colin', 'Firth', 'Ben', 'who', 'up', 'coma', 'lasted', 'one', 'week', 'car', 'crash', 'killed', 'wife', 'Elisa', 'Naomie', 'Harris', ""'28"", 'Days', 'Later', 'spite', 'constant', 'therapy', 'presence', 'lovely', 'girl', 'named', 'Charlotte', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Ben', 'mental', 'condition', 'worse', 'worse', 'suspect', 'what', 'remembers', 'not', 'necessarily', 'reflect', 'reality', 'everyone', 'else', 'shares', 'addition', 'premise', 'longer', 'original', 'film', 'murder', 'case', 'internationally', 'famous', 'actress', 'singer', 'sorry', 'forgot', 'not', 'convince', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'Ben', 'might', 'be', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'how', 'why', 'script', 'laden', 'so', 'many', 'bits', 'do', 'not', 'simply', 'gel', 'things', 'pointed', 'out', 'Ben', 'must', 'meet', 'seer', 'played', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'who', 'something', 'very', 'predictable', 'estranged', 'sister', 'who', 'just', 'forgettable', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'red', 'ants', 'crawling', 'paintings', 'imply', 'nothing', 'special', 'CCTV', 'surveillance', 'images', 'only', 'remind', 'film', 'set', 'UK', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'used', 'short', 'films', 'directed', 'film', 'school', 'students', 'difference', 'probably', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'better.I', 'simply', 'detest', 'ending', 'only', 'be', 'shocking', 'not', 'sincerely', 'wish', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'find', 'new', 'agent', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'string', 'bad', 'career', 'choices', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'serious', 'damages', 'career', 'days']",Trauma

During that time, he had nightmares and hallucinations that might have been the post impact of the traumatic event. Then enter Mena Suvari, who eventually gets involved with Firth romantically. She's infatuated with him, but he's too messed up and removed from his reality, that he ended up killing her by putting a poisonous spider into her mouth. That was the most disturbing scene in this film. I really didn't see that one coming, since there had been so much sexual energy between them. The remain of the film is rather like a jigsaw puzzle, which was totally confusing to follow.This is a very unusual film, and it's not a conventional thriller. It's creepy, suspenseful, and the mysterious leading role portrayed by Colin Firth is quite captivating. Mena Suvari was rather underused in this film. For some reason, I couldn't help wonder why she chose a role that calls for her to have a thing for an older man like she did in American Beauty.",4,A Dark and Twisted Journey Taken by  Colin Firth.,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,1801,"['Having', 'been', 'impressed', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'movies', 'English', 'Patient', 'B.J', 'Diaries', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'especially', 'knowing', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'appearance', 'stage', 'showing', 'film', 'Having', 'read', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'story', 'traumatized', 'man', 'dealing', 'grief', 'emotional/spiritual', 'recovery', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'something', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Spider', 'was', 'wrong', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Machinist.This', 'movie', 'man', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'severe', 'car', 'accident', 'believed', 'had', 'taken', 'life', 'beloved', 'wife', 'played', 'Black', 'British', 'actress', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'near', 'fatal', 'injury', 'kept', 'bed', 'ridden', 'hospital', 'many', 'days', 'time', 'had', 'nightmares', 'hallucinations', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'post', 'impact', 'traumatic', 'event', 'Then', 'enter', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'who', 'eventually', 'involved', 'Firth', 'romantically', 'infatuated', 'too', 'messed', 'up', 'removed', 'reality', 'ended', 'up', 'killing', 'putting', 'poisonous', 'spider', 'mouth', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'energy', 'remain', 'film', 'rather', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'was', 'totally', 'confusing', 'follow.This', 'very', 'unusual', 'film', 'not', 'conventional', 'thriller', 'creepy', 'suspenseful', 'mysterious', 'leading', 'role', 'portrayed', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'quite', 'captivating', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'was', 'rather', 'underused', 'film', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'chose', 'role', 'have', 'thing', 'older', 'man', 'did', 'American', 'Beauty']",Trauma
898685,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0008ENI20,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 3]","Apart from Colin Firth's intense portrayal of the main character, this movie is really lacking any substance. At times it seems like it makes sense and there is a thin plot to grasp at, but then that too slips away.As with most psychological thrillers, things are not what they seem. There are several twists in the plot, but most of them happen in the last 20 minutes of the movie, and ultimately the viewer is left completely confused, rather than shocked and intrigued.Colin Firth's character wakes up from a week-long coma after a car accident in which he believes that his girlfriend died. He meets Mena Suvari, who helps him cope with his ""trauma"", and is for some reason attracted to him despite his erratic mannerisms and strange habits.The filmmaking is also a little strange with quite a few slow-motion-esque shots. I wish I knew a better way to describe them. Strange shots where maybe the filmmaker is only showing every 5th frame, but in slow motion. It's distracting and not very aesthetically pleasing. There is, however, a very creepy dream sequence in the middle of the film that defintiely pays off.The DVD has no extras at all, unless you count previews and subtitles.",2,"The true test of an actor is a poor script, and Colin Firth passed the test",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1188,"['Apart', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'really', 'lacking', 'substance', 'times', 'sense', 'thin', 'plot', 'grasp', 'then', 'too', 'slips', 'away.As', 'most', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'are', 'several', 'twists', 'plot', 'most', 'happen', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'viewer', 'left', 'completely', 'confused', 'rather', 'shocked', 'intrigued.Colin', 'Firth', 'character', 'up', 'week-long', 'coma', 'car', 'accident', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'who', 'cope', 'trauma', 'reason', 'attracted', 'erratic', 'mannerisms', 'strange', 'habits.The', 'filmmaking', 'also', 'little', 'strange', 'few', 'slow-motion-esque', 'shots', 'wish', 'knew', 'better', 'way', 'describe', 'Strange', 'shots', 'where', 'maybe', 'filmmaker', 'only', 'showing', '5th', 'frame', 'slow', 'motion', 'distracting', 'not', 'very', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'however', 'very', 'creepy', 'dream', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'defintiely', 'off.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'count', 'previews', 'subtitles']",Trauma
