1123460,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000ZS8GUS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","Going into `The Jane Austin Book Club,' I had my own preconceptions that the movie would become either trivial or contrived.  Refreshingly, the film quickly set aside my pride and prejudices for what a movie of this kind can really do.The plot is not simple, but its import is clear.  Several disparate people living their modern lives find motivation to go to the titled book club where they meet and discuss the finer points of a chosen Austen book of the month title and are inspired to discuss them as they parallel the developments in their own personal lives.The characters are a real assortment:  Prudie (Emily Blunt) is an unfulfilled teacher who lives up to her name.  She is going to Paris--if her ambitious, sports' loving husband, will allow their trip to go into fruition.  Sylvia (Amy Brenneman) has a life that is faltering.  Her husband has callousedly left her for another.  (He separates with her out of courtesy to his adulterous interest, a younger woman.)  Allegra (Maggie Grace) is their lesbian daughter who has an affinity for extreme sports and self-destructive tendencies.  Bernadette (Kathy Baker) is the senior member, and Jocelyn (Maria Bello) is a dog lover.  Grieg (Hugh Dancy) is the only man. He has greater leanings toward science fiction and author Ursula LeGuin, but he has an eye for Jocelyn, the prime mover of his initiation.  He could have become merely an opportunistic ladies' man, but he's sensitive enough to fall in love and at least gives Jane Austen a try.  Meanwhile, Jocelyn tries to coax Grieg into wooing Sylvia to make her feel desirable once again.`The Jane Austin Book Club' really holds together.  The story is complicated, but the messages and impact are really clear.  Besides being thoughtful, real life and fiction, the modern world and Austen's traditional age come together in a way that is effectively natural and organic.  We become interested in all these colorful people, and we believe the Austen classics they read really motivate and inspire them as they come to grips with real disappointments, infidelities, and life's partial realizations.  In the end, the film is believable, yet contains a breezy charm that prevents any complaints of overwrought or pretentious developments.",4,"""What Would Jane Do?""",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2248,"['Going', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'Book', 'Club', 'had', 'own', 'preconceptions', 'movie', 'would', 'become', 'trivial', 'contrived', 'Refreshingly', 'film', 'quickly', 'set', 'aside', 'pride', 'prejudices', 'what', 'movie', 'kind', 'can', 'really', 'do.The', 'plot', 'not', 'simple', 'import', 'clear', 'Several', 'disparate', 'people', 'living', 'modern', 'lives', 'find', 'motivation', 'go', 'titled', 'book', 'club', 'where', 'meet', 'discuss', 'finer', 'points', 'chosen', 'Austen', 'book', 'month', 'title', 'are', 'inspired', 'discuss', 'parallel', 'developments', 'own', 'personal', 'lives.The', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'assortment', 'Prudie', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'unfulfilled', 'teacher', 'who', 'up', 'name', 'going', 'Paris', 'ambitious', 'sports', 'loving', 'husband', 'will', 'allow', 'trip', 'go', 'fruition', 'Sylvia', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'life', 'faltering', 'husband', 'callousedly', 'left', 'courtesy', 'adulterous', 'interest', 'younger', 'woman', 'Allegra', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'lesbian', 'daughter', 'who', 'affinity', 'extreme', 'sports', 'self-destructive', 'tendencies', 'Bernadette', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'senior', 'member', 'Jocelyn', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'dog', 'lover', 'Grieg', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'only', 'man', 'greater', 'leanings', 'science', 'fiction', 'author', 'Ursula', 'LeGuin', 'eye', 'Jocelyn', 'prime', 'mover', 'initiation', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'merely', 'opportunistic', 'ladies', 'man', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'fall', 'love', 'least', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'try', 'Meanwhile', 'Jocelyn', 'coax', 'Grieg', 'wooing', 'Sylvia', 'make', 'feel', 'desirable', 'once', 'again.', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'Book', 'Club', 'really', 'together', 'story', 'complicated', 'messages', 'impact', 'are', 'really', 'clear', 'being', 'thoughtful', 'real', 'life', 'fiction', 'modern', 'world', 'Austen', 'traditional', 'age', 'come', 'together', 'way', 'effectively', 'natural', 'organic', 'become', 'interested', 'colorful', 'people', 'believe', 'Austen', 'classics', 'read', 'really', 'motivate', 'inspire', 'come', 'grips', 'real', 'disappointments', 'infidelities', 'life', 'partial', 'realizations', 'end', 'film', 'believable', 'yet', 'breezy', 'charm', 'complaints', 'overwrought', 'pretentious', 'developments']",N/A

For instance, a treat called Healthy Oat Bars may have oatmeal, yes, but might be loaded with chemicals as well.  That is the analogy that comes to mind after viewing this movie.Yes, Jane Austen's name and the titles to her books are ever present.  Yes, there is a weak attempt at traditional morality with the divorced man seeking reconcilliation ... but sadly, yes, there is something other than Jane Austen at work here.Jane Austen presented the glories of chastity and the honor of marital fidelity.  Pride and Prejudice alone speaks of the Christian world view Austen embraced.  Why would her modern 'Book Club' movie use her good name to promote out of marriage sexual relations complete with a steamy hands on partial nudity same sex scene and celebrate another in which giddy young and middle aged adults shake off their clothing the minute love is recognized? Have the writers mistaken Lydia for Elizabeth Bennett or what?!My concern is that young people in particular may confuse the extreme example of modern anything goes morality in this movie with the time honored codes of conduct Austen championed.  Let us not rewrite Jane Austen's moral code. This is a book club who reads but does not follow very far.

Or maybe if Hugh Dancy, who plays the only male member of the club until the end (when some husbands join in), wasn't so adorable. But I have, and he is, and I identified with elements in every one of these women's stories, even the lesbian. You don't have to be a lesbian to identify with some of the elements in her life, after all.And there's much to that point regarding Jane Austen, too. You don't have to identify with the characters to learn from reading about them, and you don't have to be a willowy young beauty to appreciate those aspects of her life with which you can identify.All the members of the club have their strengths and weaknesses. Prudie is a French teacher who has never been to France, and who is deeply disappointed with her husband's lack of interest in her life. Sylvia's having all sorts of issues around her husband leaving her for a younger woman (especially because she's not all that much younger). Jocelyn is a breeder of championship ridgeback dogs, and has never been married. Bernadette, older than the others, is looking for romance but not glum about it. Allegra, Sylvia's daughter, is a lesbian who has yet to find just the right partner, and loves dangerous sports. Grigg, the only male, is attracted to Jocelyn but being pushed to date Sylvia. He thinks he's being pushed toward Allegra, but her frank mention of her girlfriend and her out-of-closet tee shirt soon makes it clear that's not the point.Jane Austen is a romantic, and therefore these people are pretty romance-minded, too, or they wouldn't appreciate Austen the way they do. But until you see the ""one year later"" dinner at the very end, you won't know how it all works out.I loved this film almost as much as I love Jane Austen, and that's saying something.",5,I Wish I Had Friends Like These,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1867,"['OK', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'nearly', 'so', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'review', 'club', 'maybe', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'who', 'only', 'male', 'member', 'club', 'end', 'when', 'husbands', 'join', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'adorable', 'have', 'identified', 'elements', 'one', 'women', 'stories', 'even', 'lesbian', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'lesbian', 'identify', 'elements', 'life', 'much', 'point', 'regarding', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'identify', 'characters', 'learn', 'reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'willowy', 'young', 'beauty', 'appreciate', 'aspects', 'life', 'can', 'identify.All', 'members', 'club', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Prudie', 'French', 'teacher', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'France', 'who', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'husband', 'lack', 'interest', 'life', 'Sylvia', 'having', 'sorts', 'issues', 'husband', 'leaving', 'younger', 'woman', 'especially', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'younger', 'Jocelyn', 'breeder', 'championship', 'ridgeback', 'dogs', 'never', 'been', 'married', 'Bernadette', 'older', 'others', 'looking', 'romance', 'not', 'glum', 'Allegra', 'Sylvia', 'daughter', 'lesbian', 'who', 'yet', 'find', 'just', 'right', 'partner', 'dangerous', 'sports', 'Grigg', 'only', 'male', 'attracted', 'Jocelyn', 'being', 'pushed', 'date', 'Sylvia', 'being', 'pushed', 'Allegra', 'frank', 'mention', 'girlfriend', 'out-of-closet', 'tee', 'shirt', 'soon', 'clear', 'not', 'point.Jane', 'Austen', 'romantic', 'therefore', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'romance-minded', 'too', 'would', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Austen', 'way', 'do', 'see', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'dinner', 'very', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'out.I', 'loved', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'saying', 'something']",N/A

1123467,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000ZS8GUS,barry,"[7, 7]","This film is very original, creative and heartfelt.  It is a romantic comedy of manners told with wit and charm.  It is the story of 6 friends who are Jane Austen fans and all decide to form a book club for different reasons.  6 months, 6 members and 6 books.  As each book is read and discussed we get involved more and more into the complexities of the real lives of each character.  They are all very real, very believable and it is very touching how they all gain more inner strength by the continuity of the book club.It is a romantic comedy but the comedic touches are right on and not forced the same as they are in life.  My favorite characters here are those played by Amy Brenneman and Emily Blunt as a woman recently dumped by her husband and a very prissy unhappily married teacher respectively.  The journeys of self discovery both of these women go thru is emotionally heart wrenching and excellently portrayed.Jane Austen writes with a complex purpose in each of her novels and they can all be debated for days so to have a book club centered around her work as a basis is an outstanding idea.  It freely allows us to see the real life drama each character is actually going through.  The acting is superb throughout and the ending is very uplifting but it manages to not be formulaic.  Not all things in life end badly and the way each character moves on is very authentic.This film could be called a chic flick but it is so much more and I think it is a perfect film for all couples to watch together and discuss after.  It can be used as a touching stone the same as the Jane Austen Book Club was in the film.Watch and enjoy excellent acting and very believable characters journey through life and learn from each other.",4,Excellent Film,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1738,"['film', 'very', 'original', 'creative', 'heartfelt', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'manners', 'told', 'wit', 'charm', 'story', '6', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'decide', 'form', 'book', 'club', 'different', 'reasons', '6', 'months', '6', 'members', '6', 'books', 'book', 'read', 'discussed', 'get', 'involved', 'more', 'more', 'complexities', 'real', 'lives', 'character', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'believable', 'very', 'touching', 'how', 'gain', 'more', 'inner', 'strength', 'continuity', 'book', 'club.It', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'comedic', 'touches', 'are', 'right', 'not', 'forced', 'same', 'are', 'life', 'favorite', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'played', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'woman', 'recently', 'dumped', 'husband', 'very', 'prissy', 'unhappily', 'married', 'teacher', 'respectively', 'journeys', 'self', 'discovery', 'women', 'go', 'thru', 'emotionally', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'excellently', 'portrayed.Jane', 'Austen', 'complex', 'purpose', 'novels', 'can', 'be', 'debated', 'days', 'so', 'have', 'book', 'club', 'centered', 'work', 'basis', 'outstanding', 'idea', 'freely', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'character', 'actually', 'going', 'acting', 'superb', 'ending', 'very', 'uplifting', 'not', 'be', 'formulaic', 'Not', 'things', 'life', 'end', 'badly', 'way', 'character', 'moves', 'very', 'authentic.This', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'chic', 'flick', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'perfect', 'film', 'couples', 'watch', 'together', 'discuss', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'touching', 'stone', 'same', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Book', 'Club', 'was', 'film.Watch', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'acting', 'very', 'believable', 'characters', 'journey', 'life', 'learn', 'other']",N/A

Working mom, Syl (Amy Brenneman), has it all, with a great job as a librarian, a radiant, if klutzy, lesbian daughter (Maggie Grace), and a devoted husband (Jimmy Smits)...until he announces he was cheating on her, and asks for a divorce. Oft-married, ever-optimistic Bernadette (Kathy Baker) decides to create an Austen club to provide emotional support for both Syl and their best friend, ever-single dog trainer/matchmaker Jocelyn (Maria Bello), who is grieving over the loss of a beloved dog. Bernadette meets young, uptight French teacher/Austen devotee Prudie (Emily Blunt), who has her own baggage, with an inattentive husband (Marc Blucas), an ex-hippie mom (Lynn Redgrave), and a sexy student (Kevin Zegers), whose attentions are sparking her barely-repressed lust. The older woman quickly railroads Prudie into her plan, finalizing a book club that will be ""all-women, all-Austen"", focusing on a different Austen novel, each month. Ah, but then Jocelyn meets handsome young computer geek, Grigg (Hugh Dancy), and decides to pair Syl with him, using the club...so a male member joins in the mix, and the fun really begins...With each major character a 21st century variation of an Austen one, the story unfolds around the monthly meeting/book discussions, allowing the entire cast opportunities to shine. Will Syl recover from her failed marriage? Will Prudie give in, and have her forbidden tryst? Will Jocelyn ever figure out Grigg loves HER? Swicord succeeds in making every subplot both involving, and entertaining!Great bonus features make ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" even better. The Austen prototypes of each character are explained, there is a terrific biography of the writer (far better than the one offered in ""Becoming Jane""), and an affectionate behind-the-scenes look at the production all truly expand the enjoyment of the film.Is this a 'chick flick'?

1123470,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000ZS8GUS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 4]","We've all heard the term ""chick flick"", I'm sure. Well ...THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB certainly rests comfortably within that sexist genre. Of course, Jane Austen's books appeal more to women than to men, too, having been romanticized to the extreme on celluloid (some of them multiple times). And here we get a double dose of Austen via five women and one clueless guy.The women are socially stunted in some way. Jocelyn (Maria Bello,A History of Violence) avoids male connections by burying herself in her dog kennel. Prudie (Emily Blunt,The Devil Wears Prada) is a high school French teacher who's enraptured with one of her students and distancing herself from her husband (Marc Blucas,First Daughter). Bernadette (Kathy Baker,Cold Mountain) is a serial marrying woman who can't settle down with one man. Silvia (Amy Brenneman) just found out from her husband that he's been having an affair and wants a divorce ...all while juggling her own life and that of a lesbian daughter (Maggie Grace,Lost). The man in ""the Club"" is a guy named Grigg (Hugh Dancy) who's initially brought in to hook up with Silvia but finds he's more interested in Jocelyn, causing all kinds of unusual sparks to fly.The book club is started roughly by Bernadette and it is unclear as to why this was done. Considering this is a vital plot point for the film, I felt there should've been a much more defining moment surrounding the clubs creation. It was also hard to swallow the fact that simply by reading one of Austen's books, it could save a marriage. Although romantic to think about, Austen's books, characters, and plots were never that simple (this storyline happens late in the film and was just too pat).There were some pretty funny moments. Most of them surround Grigg, though, the Austen-challenged man in this estrogen-filled club. His lack of understanding of Austen's stories are pretty funny (""They're not sequels?"") and the donning on him of what his true purpose within the group is supposed to be is quite funny, too.

As an Austen enthusiast who has read each of her works multiple times, I delighted in the way Austen's characters and themes are woven into this work and how the enhance and parallel the lives of the characters.  I read the book and enjoyed it but I think I enjoyed the movie more.First off, the casting of the movie was really wonderful.  I felt that each actor did an excellent job of bringing the diverse and interesting characters to life and made each of them authentic.  Of particular note to me was Hugh Dancy as Grigg and Maria Bello as Jocelyn.  The tension between the two was wonderful and Dancy did a superb job of playing a man who is too shy to come out and say what he is feeling.  Grigg's evolution as a man who thinks Austen books are ""girly"" to a man who becomes so enamored of her works that he reads The Mysteries of Udolpho to gain a better understanding of Northanger Abbey was really fun.  I really enjoyed his turn at hosting the book club and his thematic redecoration of his house.  The scene is a real treat for any Austen fan.I also really enjoyed Maggie Grace's turn as Allegra.  It took me a moment to recognize her as Lost's Shannon and that is a good thing.  The role was quite different from her role on the show and I really sympathized with her when she learned of her betrayal by someone she trusted implicitly with some of her deepest, darkest secrets.  I hope to see more of Maggie Grace.Emily Blunt was wonderful as Prudie whose story is perhaps the most interesting.  Prudie is so cold and judgmental upon first encountering her that she is immediately unappealing.  Her character development, though, is superb and she comes across as the most multifaceted of the characters.  Her struggles with a marriage that has become indifferent and with her inappropriate fascination with one of her students are compelling.  As her background becomes more known, it becomes more and more apparent why she is who she is and why Austen's works would hold such appeal for a woman such as her.More than anything, this film--and the book--are a sort of fan letter to the inimitable Jane Austen.  The characters meet for some really interesting and intelligent discussions about the motivations of Austen's characters.  I found myself nodding my head in agreement and some of the insights offered up by the characters were things I had not myself considered.  Austen's works help to instruct the characters and guide them in their choices.  Like Austen's characters, the characters learn not to compromise their principles and to value themselves.",4,"Funny, interesting character study",1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,2694,"['warning', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Austen', 'works', 'may', 'find', 'lost', 'many', 'parts', 'film', 'Austen', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'read', 'works', 'multiple', 'times', 'delighted', 'way', 'Austen', 'characters', 'themes', 'are', 'woven', 'work', 'how', 'enhance', 'parallel', 'lives', 'characters', 'read', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'off', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'wonderful', 'felt', 'actor', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'diverse', 'interesting', 'characters', 'life', 'made', 'authentic', 'particular', 'note', 'was', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Grigg', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Jocelyn', 'tension', 'two', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Dancy', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'shy', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'what', 'feeling', 'Grigg', 'evolution', 'man', 'who', 'Austen', 'books', 'are', 'girly', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'enamored', 'works', 'Mysteries', 'Udolpho', 'gain', 'better', 'understanding', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'turn', 'hosting', 'book', 'club', 'thematic', 'redecoration', 'house', 'scene', 'real', 'treat', 'Austen', 'fan.I', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'turn', 'Allegra', 'took', 'moment', 'recognize', 'Lost', 'Shannon', 'good', 'thing', 'role', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'role', 'show', 'really', 'sympathized', 'when', 'learned', 'betrayal', 'someone', 'trusted', 'implicitly', 'deepest', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'Maggie', 'Grace.Emily', 'Blunt', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Prudie', 'story', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'Prudie', 'so', 'cold', 'judgmental', 'first', 'encountering', 'immediately', 'unappealing', 'character', 'development', 'superb', 'most', 'multifaceted', 'characters', 'struggles', 'marriage', 'become', 'indifferent', 'inappropriate', 'fascination', 'one', 'students', 'are', 'compelling', 'background', 'more', 'known', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'why', 'who', 'why', 'Austen', 'works', 'would', 'hold', 'such', 'appeal', 'woman', 'such', 'her.More', 'anything', 'film', 'book', 'are', 'sort', 'fan', 'letter', 'inimitable', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'characters', 'meet', 'really', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'discussions', 'motivations', 'Austen', 'characters', 'found', 'nodding', 'head', 'agreement', 'insights', 'offered', 'up', 'characters', 'were', 'things', 'had', 'not', 'myself', 'considered', 'Austen', 'works', 'help', 'instruct', 'characters', 'guide', 'choices', 'Austen', 'characters', 'characters', 'learn', 'not', 'compromise', 'principles', 'value']",N/A

Impressively, in less than two hours, the film managed to deal with more than six storylines well. Sure, it's a little schmaltzy, but it's oddly satisfying. The film (based on Karen Joy Fowler's book of the same name) is not only an ode to Jane Austen, but to literature as a whole, especially its resonance over the years. As Jane Austen's novels are too, this movie is about life, love, loss, trust and friendship.The cast was brilliant: Mario Bello, Kathy Baker, Emily Blunt, Amy Brenneman, Hugh Dancy, Maggie Grace, Jimmy Smits and Lynn Redgrave. It was wonderful to see Emily Blunt have so much to do, especially after seeing her do little but smoke a joint and take her clothes off in Charlie Wilson's War. Mario Bello was fantastic. Despite so many excellent female performances, Hugh Dancy stole the movie. He was charming, dapper, awkward and ultimately endearing.In so many ways, this movie comes dangerously close to being cringe-inducing and cheesy. Wonderful acting and the back drop of both intellectual and catty banter about Jane Austen firmly anchors this story in a respectable space.

The movie has six segments, each one named after one of the novels.

And like a soap opera, neither real life nor Austen's novels enjoy the syrupy resolution of this film. My hunch is that a woman who has married six times is not a candidate for bliss on the seventh try, that a young teacher who hits on her high school student will not rebound so quickly, or that a twenty year marriage that ends in acrimony will probably not u-turn into one of affection after the husband (!) reads an Austen novel.

1123484,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000ZS8GUS,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","It really isn't the singularly ultra-feminine orientation that alienates me from this 2007 hodgepodge tribute to the power of Jane Austen's prose as much as the cursory, heavy-handed way that director/screenwriter Robin Swicord has approached her adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler's2004 novel. Austen's enduring popularity has inspired several recently filmed productions of her early 19th century works, and Fowler cleverly interweaves the author's six novels by incorporating her pertinent themes into a contemporary story of manners. Unfortunately, with a running time of 105 minutes, Swicord barely has time to tap into the themes of each novel as Fowler could, and the result feels rushed and misshapen by the machinations of the modern-day stories toward a too-perfect resolution. Despite the presence of a sterling ensemble of proven actors, there's just something ultimately patronizing to viewers of either gender when a filmmaker needs to wrap up the numerous loose threads of the omnibus plot into a neatly tied bow at the end.The multi-decked story is a pure Harlequin romance fantasy bringing together a group of five women and one man into a monthly book club in, of all places, Sacramento (though it was filmed in LA). The den mother is Bernadette, a fiftyish, six-times-married free spirit who decides to start the book club to cheer up longtime friend Sylvia, facing the breakup of her twenty-plus year marriage, and new acquaintance Prudie, a young high school French teacher with an insensitive husband. Joining the clutch is Bernadette and Sylvia's good friend Jocelyn, a dog breeder who has already given up on having possible long-term relationships (just like Austen'sEmma); Sylvia's daredevil lesbian daughter Allegra, who treats love and sports in the same risk-taking manner; and Grigg, a software whiz and science-fiction geek who has never read Austen before. Their lives outside the club intertwine, in particular, Jocelyn's repeated attempts to match the now-separated Sylvia with Grigg. I imagine familiarity with Austen's novels would be helpful since many of the literary references occur in rapid-fire succession, but it isn't mandatory since Swicord primarily focuses on the characters' predicaments in a more predictable soap opera fashion.A strong cast helps, but more often, their portrayals feel like chess pieces in a timer-dictated game. Channeling a lot of Frances McDormand's innate pragmatism, the ever-dependable Maria Bello (A History of Violence,World Trade Center) is sharp as always as Jocelyn. Kathy Baker is earthy goodness as Bernadette, though her character feels more like a plot device to allow the others a sounding board. More familiar for her TV work, Amy Brenneman gets to experience the most drastic transformation as Sylvia, moving stepwise from dispensable wife to emancipated woman, while Maggie Grace brings the requisite looseness to daughter Allegra. With her severe haircut, repressed wardrobe, and pretentious manner, Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada,Dan in Real Life) continues to sharpen her versatility as the insecure Prudie. As put-upon Grigg, Hugh Dancy (Evening) does what he can with a relatively thankless part. Smaller parts are played by Jimmy Smits as Sylvia's male-menopausal husband, and surrounding Prudie, Kevin Zegers (Transamerica) as her hormonally charged student, Marc Blucas as her lunk-headed husband, and Lynn Redgrave as her pothead hippie mother.There are quite a few extras on the 2008 DVD with the obligatory commentary track probably the most informative feature with light-hearted remarks provided by Swicord, editor Maryann Brandon, co-producer Julie Lynn, and actors Dancy, Grace and Blucas. Four featurettes are provided - a standard eighteen-minute behind-the-scenes segment with the cast and crew interviewed in brief snippets;  a 22-minute overview of Austen's life as narrated by her devotees; a twelve-minute short - interesting but somewhat contrived - on how Swicord adapted each of the principal characters in Fowler's book to a literary counterpart in an Austen novel; and a throwaway segment from the premiere in LA (it had a short theatrical run before going to video). There are also seven deleted scenes, including the last one where they tried repeatedly to have a ridgeback dog sniff at Dancy's crotch. Austen devotees may enjoy the constant references to her works, but I wonder if they will appreciate the conventional storyline upon which they precariously hang.",3,Strong Cast Enlivens a Superficial

1123499,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B000ZS8GUS,Kelly Klepfer,"[3, 3]","Jane Austen's books overwhelm me with the number of characters. I have to be exposed to her stories more than once to fully feel like I get her world. ""Book Club"" is a movie not unlike Jane's books in that way. It's a movie that needs to be watched more than once to begin to see the inner workings within the characters.I read several reviews before renting Book Club and decided I needed to see it for myself. I understand what the issues are with the folks who didn't care for the movie. For starters, this isn't a G-rated historical romance like Austen's beloved novels. It's set in modern day and the movie actually opens with scenes of chaos in the busyness of daily living. Ringing cellphones, automated transactions and traffic. Then it moves into a funeral scene. The characters begin to plan something to help the bereaved and suddenly there is another crisis -- a death of a marriage. The characters, a group of old and new friends, need something good to focus on.So they choose to meet for six months and cover a different Jane Austen title each month, hoping to bring romance and genteelity back into some hurting lives.These are the complaints I picked up in other reviews.The sexuality aspects of the movie are moderately strong. If you are a concerned parent, by all means watch it first. The major sexual themes -- a teacher with an emotionally, borderline physically inappropriate relationship with a student, a marriage suffering from an affair, another marriage on the verge, a young lesbian with more than one partner throughout the film, a woman married six times and still looking for lucky number seven.The second complaint about the movie seems to be the lack of Jane Austen's works in the film. Yes and no. The ""book"" discussions are short and there is very little actual Jane Austen prose shared with the audience. Instead you are given glimpses of each character devouring a different book each month. Interestingly the book club members' and their relationships end up looking like little slivers of Austen's characters. For example, Emma surfaces in 3-D when Jocelyn tries to fix her broken friend's life by finding the perfect man. Jocelyn doesn't need a man, of course, until he seems to be looking elsewhere. Young Allegra who gives her heart away and receives it back crushed and yet enters rapidly into another relationship not unlike Marianne and Willoughby. Or maybe Allegra and Corrine are the modern version of Mr. Wickham and Lydia Bennet.The third issue with the negative reviews was the lack of character development and/or the miracle changes of heart. Two marriages, one with an affair, another with an emotional affair that could ruin a career as well, a woman in her forties who has never been in love, a young man in love with a woman a decade or so older, a lesbian who loves with all her heart one day and hates her lover the next.True, these are huge issues, but this movie takes place over months as they meet to discuss the books and we are given only glimpses of time throughout that month. So what seems fast, unbelievable and overnight is not fully the case. And having been married for twenty-six years, I can completely believe that one person who begins to think differently can change the whole flavor of the marriage overnight, if the thinking truly changes.

Oh well, that's maybe the most fun part of the movie, when Maria Bello starts really feeling jealous of Hugh Dancy's interest in Amy Brenneman.It was sort of a dumb picture, but how dumb could it be when heaping ladlesfull of Austeniana were dripped all over us every few minutes.  We sat there mouths open while the characters tore a new one out of the Patricia Rozema film of Mansfield Park, the one with Harold Pinter in it, and maybe felt a little intellectually superior because we knew what they were talking about.I did get thrown for a loop when Emily Blunt, feeling the pain of having crazy Lynn Redgrave for a mom, and feeling slighted by her husband Marc Blucas, starts crushing out on Kevin Zegers who is supposed to be in high school.  Okay, so in real life he's 25 and probably no older than Emily Blunt, it still feels wrong somehow and yet no one has the nerve to tell her, this is messed up Prudie!  Casting Zegers as a high school boy is like casting Maggie Grace as Liam Neeson's 16 year old daughter in TAKEN.  It's so badly calculated there's something magical about it.  Why didn't they get Brad Pitt?  Too expensive I suppose.Instead they made do with NYPD BLUE alumni and you know what, they worked just fine.

I belong to a book group and could relate to the intimacy of the group and how issues from ""the outside"" make their way into discussions. I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 3, but only because of Grigg (Hugh Dancy) and Prudie (Emily Blunt).I'll start with Grigg, the charming sci-fi fan. Jocelyn (Maria Bello) is the typical anti-sci fi elitist, believing classic fiction like Austen's to have more realistic characters. People do tend to stereotype science fiction as a genre of aliens and bizarre happenings, but it can often be more realistic and philosophical than regular fiction. It is the ultimate genre of ""What If...?"" Grigg stood up for this, and I waited eagerly to hear what Jocelyn thought of Ursula Le Guin. The clash between sci fi and ""the classics"" is not often fleshed out in movies.Some of the others: Kathy Baker was fabulous in her role; Jimmy Smitts was irritating (his character was forced to be more likeable than it should have been). Emily Blunt's character, Prudie, is the French teacher who's never been to France, her snobbery sickening as she spouts off French phrases during their meetings.  She wears her wedding ring on her right hand because ""it's European"" (""But you're not European"", character Allegra points out). Prudie is the saddest character of them all, I think. Loveless marriage, interested in one of her students...she can't get over painful memories of her past (which include her hippie mother/anonymous father and embarrassing moments in high school). One memorable scene is when Prudie fights with her husband about his flirtations with a high school enemy of hers.""High school's over,"" he tells her.""High school's never over,"" she says.That's one of the most profound lines I've ever heard - I'm serious.

Austen fans will have great fun spotting which of the characters are riffing off which Austen characters (my wife and I were totally convinced that the Emily Blunt character Prudie and the Maggie Grace character Allegra were basically re-enacting Pride and Prejudice - boy, were we wrong) and those who have never read Jane Austen...well, I can only assume that this would turn you onto her, the way Babette's Feast turned an entire generation of film-lovers onto French cuisine.It's nice to see British actors demonstrating that they can do great American character acting as good as any American actor - kudos to Emily Blunt, Hugh Dancy and Lynn Redgrave.  My favourite actor in the whole thing is Maria Bello, fabulous as what you might call the 'Emma' character, a woman so used to being single that she's forgotten how to be normal around anyone but her friends.  There's a sublime moment early on, in an elevator, where her dog-breeding single woman character suddenly notices an adornment on a passing Goth girl, and comments on it...classic.It's a generous, intelligent, grown-up rom-com.

1123511,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000ZS8GUS,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[15, 16]","""The Jane Austen Book Club"" (TJABC) was a 2004 novel by author Karen Joy Fowler. I acquired the novel last spring and relished the thought of reading a contemporary version of Austen's romances, with each character and each chapter tying into one of Austen's novels. A clever premise, some interesting characters....but I found the overall effort to be a tad on the lackluster side and kept picking the book up, and putting it down before eventually managing to end it all.Robin Swicord tackled the job of getting this book to film; and it opened to very little fanfare last summer. As the members of the book club, the cast is a director's dream. It's always a joy to see Amy Brenneman (Of the TV Show, ""Judging Amy"", on the screen, and we've had too little of her in the world of film. Brenneman is devastated and devastating as an unwilling divorcee, Sylvia, who was married to Daniel (Jimmy Smits in an unfamiliar role) who has fallen in love with the other woman. Maggie Grace (Shannon from the TV Show, ""Lost"") is suitably cast as Allegra, Sylvia and Daniel's grown daughter. Much of Fowler's book centered on the oddities of Allegra...thankfully, the movie only touches on them.Kathy Baker plays flamboyant, much-divorced Bernadette and does so with a satirical air. Maria Bello is Jocelyn, a dog breeder who is afraid of commitment. Bello is no surprise; she's done a credible job with every one of her big screen roles -- here we are caught up in her draw towards Grigg, the only male member of the club, although initially she attempts clumsily to ""matchmake him"" to Sylvia.The outstanding turns belong to Hugh Dancy, as Grigg. He's a science fiction fan who accidentally meets Joceyln and accepts her invitation to join a book club reading a genre he has no idea about. He's subtly charming and has a way of 21st century hero about him; he and Bello are drawn like moths to flame. Also a stand out is Emily Blunt, so good in whatever she brings to the screen, as Prudie. Prudie's character is audacious -- an obsessive French teacher married to the wrong man, she's eager to find romance in any way she can.Tying in Austen's novels and characters to the ensemble is easy, and a little tedious, but by film's end, you're glad you made the attempt. TJABC is kind of a ""little film that could""...not excellent by any stretch of the imagination, but still a worthy contemporary treatise on Austen's themes.Set in Sacramento, the surroundings are lovely and bracing, and the DVD has a full complement of extras like deleted scenes, the casting dilemma, and a lively conversation about the filming between Swicord, the producers, Maggie Grace and Hugh Dancy.For once, a film that improves upon the material it was derived from.

1123514,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000ZS8GUS,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","It's November 2007 (released on DVD 17 March 2008) and I've just come back from an early evening showing of this film in our nearby multiplex on a wet and windy Saturday night in London. My mate and I were looking for something uplifting and light and decided on this. No one else did. We were the lone two in the cinema - literally. I suspect that's because ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" has received 3-star reviews almost everywhere - which is a damn shame - because it's so much better than that - and we both thought so.Here's the basic story: Six women of different ages and sexual persuasions form a book club to discuss something that unites and excites them all - Jane Austen's six period-piece novels. One will be tackled and talked about every month in the club in a different location. There's ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Sense & Sensibility"", ""Emma"", ""Northanger Abbey"", "" Mansfield Park"" and ""Persuasion"". The actresses are Amy Brennaman (who is married to and having trouble with Jimmy Smits), Emily Blunt (who is a married teacher lusting after an 18-year hunky student, while she gets nothing mentally or physically from her basic guy of a husband and mad hippy mum), Kathy Baker (the oldest in the group, who has been married six times and is happily looking for husband number seven), Maggie Grace who's Amy Brennaman's daughter and a lesbian in love with a manipulative writer - and finally Maria Bello - who loves dogs more than almost anything - including men.The Writer/Director Robin Swicord has sculpted their lives to mirror Austen's plots and as some reviewers have pointed out, these bits are a little too pat for comfort. But that doesn't stop the dialogue from being repeatedly touching and amazingly on the pulse of how love is in the complicated and confusing 2000s. There are rare insights here and beautifully observed snippets of life too (taking a tip from a device Austen uses in her books - dialogue by Kathy Baker's character titles this review).The actresses as you can imagine (given great material) are uniformly superb also - especially Emily Blunt - who looks ravishing every time the camera is pointed at her - a huge star in the making if ever there was one. Maria Bello is her usual classy self, bringing real gravitas and warmth to her character, who has to do the most 'growing' and Amy Brennaman adds a real earthiness to what would have been a little too frothy a crew. Maggie Grace is both lovely and sexy as the passionate and headstrong daughter. The warmth and sheer class of Kathy Baker combined with a brilliantly nutty fruitcake turn by Lynn Redgrave only add icing to an already fantastic ensemble cake.Then come the men who are excellent choices both as actors and eye-candy. The hugely likeable Hugh Dancy plays the hapless Grigg who fancies Maria Bello's character Jocelyn - but she only wants to pair him off with Amy Brennaman's character Sylvia. Sylvia is too much in love with/and hurt by her now parted/cheating husband Jimmy Smits to notice anyone. Jimmy Smits is excellent and so likeable - it's easy to see why Robin Swicord wanted to work with him. Emily Blunt's prim and proper Prudie is driven by her need to be neat, ordered and have everything just so - but she is wild inside for forbidden fruit - licking her rather delicious lips at the heartthrob that is Trey played by Kevin Zegers (""...he looks at me like he's the spoon...and I'm a dish of ice cream...""). But the unfolding surprise is Marc Blucas as Blunt's husband Dean - his performance is clever - he seems like a sap at first trapped in a marriage he no longer understands - but his growth back to his wife is beautifully handled and convincing.And then of course there's 'that' writer - the gorgeous Jane Austen - who generation-after-generation takes every heart by storm. Hearing each of Austen's novels discussed and critiqued and then hearing extracts from some of them only makes you want to run out and instantly buy all six - then go on a Jane-bender yourself.""The Jane Austen Book Club"" is not quite a rom-com - nor a full-on girly fest - it's much better than that. Like Austen's writing - it's properly romantic and wordy-delicious - and you want to return to it again and again. More importantly - you can't help but feel that real heart, belief and joy went into the making of this 'little film' and all concerned had a total blast doing it.""The Jane Austen Book Club"" is that rarest of things in Hollywood these days - a movie that gives you both romance and heart - and doesn't get cloying on either. Personally I think it's a bit of an unsung masterpiece. Ignore the so-so reviews and give it a whirl...PS: There now follows extracts from my all new 2007 in-the-real-world kickass street version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" - coming to a multiplex near you - just in time for Oscars 2008 next year. Mister Darcy (played by a bald Bruce Willis) has just emerged from the lake all clingy and wet and unable to control his ardor no more. He pulls Miss Bennett (played by Sharon Stone in a ludicrously tight rubber bodice) to his chest in a saucy-fellow Errol Flynn kind of way. There is a longing in his visage and it isn't for English tea and muffins. There is something in his eye and it isn't grit.MISTER DARCY(Looking down at her heaving bosoms)Oh Miss Bennett!ELIZABETH BENNETT(looking down at something else that's heaving)Oh Mister Darcy! What is `that' in your soggy breaches?(she now looks away to Pemberley's six hundred bedrooms - suddenly acquires a glint in her eye)Let's go back to your place!!",4,"""...Never Underestimate The

This story really isn't about the work of Jane Austen, but rather, it's about the people of the club coming from many different directions to form a believable bond.

It is based on the bookThe Jane Austen Book Clubby Karen Joy Fowler. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was funny, sad, dramatic and exciting all in one. It is a very well written, edited and directed movie. The movie is about a group of 6 people (1 man and 5 women) who form a book club dedicated to Jane Austen's novel. Each character then is in charge of discussing one book. The point of the movie is that each Jane Austen book depicts what is happening in that characters life.The cast is phenomenal.The performances in the movie are pretty darn good. Amy Brenneman, Maria Bello, Emily Blunt and all the actors do an amazing job. Blunt doesn't quite nail the American accent though. Regardless, Blunt is amazing at playing a very tortured woman who is a ""French teacher who has never been to France."" I've always loved Brenneman as the bit neurotic and depressed woman; really, that much be her forte.This DVD edition of the movie is pretty good.

It's not a great movie or an important movie, just a movie that I can watch over and over again and still love.The characters form a book club to try to help a friend through a separation/divorce.  To make it easy, they decide to read only books that they have already read.  Obviously, it has to be the Jane Austen club.As they read the books the characters respond to the emotional entanglements of their own lives.  Jocelyn (single)breeds dogs for a living. One character in frustration tells her that she has set up her life to always be in control... she breeds dogs because she likes to be obeyed.  Silvia (married then divorced)relates mostly to Mansfield Park because the heroine never wavers in her steadfast loyalty while her relations and male love interest walk all over her. Allegra (Silvia's lesbian daughter) is betrayed by her writer lover, but not in the physical sense.  Allegra's personal stories are taken and secretly rewritten for her partner's own purposes.  Bernadette (a serial divorcee with 7 notches on her belt) is just fun. Prudence (married incompatibly)... her husband cancels a planned business trip to Paris; he fails to understand her disappointment. As a French teacher who has never been to Paris, she takes it hard... but it just emphasizes their differences.  Grigg (single male) joins the book club in the hopes of getting closer to Jocelyn.As they read through the 6 Austen masterpieces the women reconsider the paths of their own lives. I love that they saved Persuasion for the last book, as it is about forgiveness, and persuading oneself to try again... as many of the characters do.This movie is just pure enjoyment.

1123532,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000ZS8GUS,RMurray847,"[18, 21]","My wife and I went to see this movie on kind of a whim.  We had taken our daughter and some friends to see a movie, and needed to kill some time.  We'd seen pretty much everything else of interest, so we agreed the cast of the movie looked like fun, so we went.  VERY GLAD WE DID!!I have seen a few Jane Austen movies and have enjoyed them.  I REALLY liked SENSE AND SENSIBILITY in particular.  But I have never read an Austen book...nor have I been particularly drawn to it.  I love to read...but haven't read Austen. Simple as that.  So I had a rudimentary knowledge...and that was plenty.  The movie is simply a delight, and the discussions and references to Austen would certainly heighten the enjoyment, but even without understanding the specific references...it's pretty easy to get the idea.I only hesitate to give the movie five stars because of it's overly-structured plot.  I totally realise that the movie is supposed to play out like an Austen novel...people working hard NOT to get with the person they're supposed to be with...then finally making it.  But I felt just a little too taken by the hand and let to one predictable (but usually fun) plot twist or device after another.  The surprises came in the performances...not in the plot.The basic premise is that these 5 women, and one very befuddled but completely charming man, meet once a month to discuss another of Austen's 6 books.  They all do their reading, they are all well-spoken and have inciteful opinions.  That isn't totally believable...but it is easy to just accept and move on.  These people are going through turmoils (mostly breakups and loneliness) that Austen sometimes relieves and sometimes echoes too perfectly.  At least the women know it...you can tell they kinda sense they're living out a modern-day Austen story.  This requires some suspension of disbelief...but it's easy to come by because all the characters are so likeable.Kathy Baker leads the group as a 60-something free-spirit, who organizes everyone into this club, mostly to help one younger friend (Maria Bello) overcome the death of her beloved Ridgeback dog.  Also in the group comes Amy Brennerman, recently split from her long-time husband Jimmy Smits.  Brennerman is joined by her daughter, played by Maggie Grace (of LOST).  Baker also happens to meet an exceedingly uptight high-school French teacher (DEVIL WEARS PRADA'S Emily Blunt) and invites her to attend.  Bello, on a whim of her own, invites a younger man named Grigg to attend...hoping he will have an interest in Amy Brennerman.  Suffice it to say, this is not where his interests end up.There's lots of juicy talk between the group. Grigg is a delightful character...totally unbelievable but so likeable that he really becomes the central focus...we root for him so completely.  Brennerman is always very good, and Baker is a force to be reckoned with no matter what she does.  She's like a softer Patricia Clarkson.  Bello is always good (despite her ignorant and reprehensible personal politics, she always draws me in with her talent), and Maggie Grace is a nice surprise after playing Shannon on LOST with such one-dimensionality.  Emily Blunt has the toughest role...because she goes through the biggest change...and starts our dreadfully unlikeable.  After we meet her mother (the wonderful Lynn Redgrave), we can begin to understand her troubles.  She evolves the most as a character...where the other ladies don't really change much, they just have things happen to them.  Seeing her in this movie and PRADA...I predict good, Oscar-winning things from her in the years to come.  She's very good.The movie is well-written and utterly engaging.  It is preposterous...but so full of fun that you really don't care much at all.  Only a few plot points caused any real groans of ""oh, you must be kidding.""

The film does retain some of the novel's verbal wit, and it has good acting, but it strips the characters of pretty much all background, so they emerge in it as only TV sitcom deep.Jane Austen herself may have written romances, but her vision was that of a satiric realist. Far from being a gentle-hearted chronicler of Regency order, she possessed a penetrating vision and wrote in a style that has been called ""regulated hatred.""  The film, in contrast, is by and large a sentimental comedy. Though some of its women occasionally deliver a zippy one-liner, they are all too afflicted with sensibility, generally whiny and far too lacking in sense. The men are equally TV deep, being weak sugarsticks or at worst unduly sentimental knaves.Austen herself described her character Emma as someone ""nobody but myself will much like.""

Meanwhile, they all have their problems and issues, and somehow, the 18th century English author becomes more and more relevant to them.  It is, of course, a chick flick, based on the novel of the same name by Karen Joy Fowler, with screenplay by Robin Swicord, who also directed, but it's sure a charming one.The Italian-born beauty Maria Bello gives a fully-imagined performance as Jocelyn, a woman who's preferred dogs to people, and Hugh Dancy is appropriately yummy as Grig Harris, too-young silicon millionaire who's got eyes for her.  Emily Blunt, so widely-noticed, and nominated, for ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" plays prissy Prudie Drummond, schoolteacher, whose husband is just not on the same plane.  Lynn Redgrave, veteran star of stage and screen, cuts quite a figure as Prudie's hippy-dippy mother.  Amy Brenneman, (""Judging Amy""), plays Sylvia Avila; Jimmy Smits, the handsome Latino husband who has just walked out on her.  Maggie Grace is their gay daughter, Allegra.  Kathy Baker is Bernadette, whose idea the club was, and the years are ganging up on her, California-style.The movie's as pleasant as they come; but did every single major character have to end it happily paired off?

1123539,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B000ZS8GUS,susannah,"[0, 0]","CONTAINS SPOILERS.........................................................This was just a good film. Not the best ever made, certainly, but a good solid film, whether an Austen fan or not. I haven't read Austen, or the book this film is based on, but I just really liked these women, well, except for Prudie. I too wish I had friends like these! While the film draws parallels between Austen's characters and these, anyone can draw such parallels to their own lives, since the women are living through the same life problems everyone has. I like that the women have such strength of feeling for each other and the things  in their lives they care about, yet each has flaws the others just accept. I could understand in a sense what Jocelyn was trying to do to set Sylvia up with Grigg the minute she had been left by Daniel, but a thinking person might question the wisdom of this, since surely Sylvia was in no way ready to think about seeing someone new, and Grigg wasn't one of Jocelyn's dogs. Additionally, it would be up to Sylvia to decide who she wanted to see, when she was ready. Bernadette was equally a little blind to others' feelings, as she planned her plans for them. She had kind of an Auntie Mame quality that must have grated on the others ONCE in a while!  I don't think Sylvia was flawed as such, except for being a little passive. Allegra was just a radiant, open, loving sweetheart who didn't think before she jumped..literally, but she was also very very young, and I think maturity could help there. Prudie, oh God, Prudie was just a mess.Yet Prudie's presence in the club demonstrated the women's real goodness and tolerance. All of them were extremely close, and Prudie a complete stranger, a prickly, pretentious, whiny know all, and not once did the other women even consider showing her the door, even when she took  shots at Allegra. They seemed to just take her in stride as one of them, as they did each other.  The scene in Starbucks when Prudie meets Allegra for the first time, Allegra being welcoming and friendly to Prudie, and immediately shot down, wasn't, IMO, because of the ""hippie"" jewelry, but because when Allegra arrived, Jocelyn and Bernadette rushed to hug and kiss her. Allegra was LOVED, as Prudie hadn't been, and she couldn't deal with that. Much has been made of the ""hippie"" aspect of Prudie's mother and upbringing, but hippies can live as they do and still love and cherish their children. I didn't see any of that from Prudie's mother, but total apathy and hatred, and that had nothing to do with her hippieness. Prudie had to hurt Allegra for having what she never had had. Poor Allegra knew none of this though.In addition to seeing this group of women live through real life problems, I also applaud any film or work that encourages literacy and critical thought.Not a perfect movie alas. There were a few parts that really stuck out to me. One being Sylvia's and Daniel's relationship. While she didn't see the problems that Daniel was apparently having, and therefore no discussion of the problems, merely getting back together without any sort of discussion or therapy, especially that Daniel had been with another woman for the better part of a year, and then just bounced back to Sylvia didn't ring true at all for me. Sylvia did address the fact that they had changed, but how? Why? What would it do for them? I also would have liked to see more of Sylvia's thoughts other than on her marital difficulties. She was a little one dimensional.I loved Sylvia's and Allegra's relationship, very loving and accepting and healthy, but I got the idea that the same wasn't true of Allegra's relationship with her father, and wondered if all her sports and accidents weren't in some way a cry for attention from him.Then, it was shown in the film that she would immediately fall in love with whoever rescued her. Allegra needed something, but didn't know what, or from who.  The film also didn't have the ending of Allegra's and Corinne's relationship make any sense, since the reason for the breakup wasn't talked about, and had only Allegra piecing together a letter. It doesn't say though how she would have even known about the letter. It was false that Allegra was in the hospital for days when she was fine. Also, with Bernadette on her 7th marriage at the end, hmm.  You see Allegra jumping from relationship to relationship at twenty years old and Bernie doing the same thing in her sixties! I wish also that there had been a little more of the trip between being a ""Neanderthal"" and an Austen fan shown for Dean. I did love that Bernie was giving Prudie maternal love and guidance, including holding her when they were knitting, that helped Prudie's own pain start to heal. It was good to see her feel part of a family. It would have been good to see her and Allegra form a friendship, since it was contentious between them at the beginning.Altogether a good film. some very funny lines also and the montage at the beginning of all the things that make is insane is just inspired!",4,LOVE it!,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,5045,"['CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'film', 'Not', 'best', 'ever', 'made',

Perhaps this is due to the subject matter, Jane Austen's novels.The only flaw I found with the movie was Prudie's husband's unrealistic personality switch, turning from an avid sports watcher into a Jane Austen reader.

""Mansfield Park""  ""Persuasion""The six novels of Jane Austen have experienced a renewed interest over the last 15  years with the BBC  masterful adaptaion of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  ""Emma"", ""Pride"", ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Mansfield Park"" have been TV mini-series or movies since 1995.Fast forward,  Jane Austen films and novels have fascinated female audiences for decades now.  Readers can and have identified with Mr Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny Brice, Mr Egerton and many of the lead characters.  What do these Victorian novels have to do with real life?That is the question that five women and one man discover over a period of 6 months.  The heartaches, heartbreaks, and hidden yearnings of the Jane Austen Book Club are reflected in the mirror of Austen literature.  Karen Joy Fowlers' book captures the eternal truth that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  The main characters of Austens' novels do exist today.  Sylvia, Prudie, Jocelyn, Grigg, and Allegra resonate strong central themes shared by Austen heroes/heroines.While it is a chick 'lit' film, it is also a strong relationship film.  The focus of the narrative is the complex lives of the book club members.  Sylvia is recovering from a split with her husband.  Jocelyn learns to accept the uncontrollable nature of people.  Prudie, is truly prudish, and a shared experience with Jane Austen salvages her marriage.  Allegra finds true love.  The matriarch, played by Lynn Redgrave, seeks to try marriage one more time while preserving balance in the group.  Grigg, learns to appreciate Jane Austen, Jocelyn, and Victorian literature.Even though we 'modern' folk are supposedly free from the shackles of convention and victorian ideals,  we can still learn a thing or two from classic Victorian novels and the far seeing vision of Jane Auten.Look for the ""Jane Austen Book Club"" at your local video store or onine at [...].I remain,A fan of adventure!",4,Austen-Is She Still Relevant?,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2046,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'Book', 'Club', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Emma', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Persuasion', 'six', 'novels', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'have', 'experienced', 'renewed', 'interest', 'last', '15', 'years', 'BBC', 'masterful', 'adaptaion', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Emma', 'Pride', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'movies', '1995.Fast', 'forward', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'films', 'novels', 'have', 'fascinated', 'female', 'audiences', 'decades', 'now', 'Readers', 'can', 'have', 'identified', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Fanny', 'Brice', 'Mr', 'Egerton', 'many', 'lead', 'characters', 'What', 'do', 'Victorian', 'novels', 'have', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'question', 'five', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'discover', 'period', '6', 'months', 'heartaches', 'heartbreaks', 'hidden', 'yearnings', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Book', 'Club', 'are', 'reflected', 'mirror', 'Austen', 'literature', 'Karen', 'Joy', 'Fowlers', 'book', 'eternal', 'truth', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'main', 'characters', 'Austens', 'novels', 'do', 'exist', 'today', 'Sylvia', 'Prudie', 'Jocelyn', 'Grigg', 'Allegra', 'resonate', 'strong', 'central', 'themes', 'shared', 'Austen', 'heroes/heroines.While', 'chick', ""'lit"", 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'relationship', 'film', 'focus', 'narrative', 'complex', 'lives', 'book', 'club', 'members', 'Sylvia', 'recovering', 'split', 'husband', 'Jocelyn', 'accept', 'uncontrollable', 'nature', 'people', 'Prudie', 'truly', 'prudish', 'shared', 'experience', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'marriage', 'Allegra', 'true', 'love', 'matriarch', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'try', 'marriage', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'preserving', 'balance', 'group', 'Grigg', 'appreciate', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Jocelyn', 'Victorian', 'literature.Even', ""'modern"", 'folk', 'are', 'supposedly', 'free', 'shackles', 'convention', 'victorian', 'ideals', 'can', 'still', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'classic', 'Victorian', 'novels', 'far', 'seeing', 'vision', 'Jane', 'Auten.Look', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Book', 'Club', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'onine', '[', ']', '.I', 'remain', 'A', 'fan', 'adventure']",N/A

The cast of characters comprise Sylvia [Amy Brennemann] who is horrified when her husband of more than 20 years, Daniel [Jimmy Smits] leaves her for another woman, Jocelyn[Maria Bello] who is single and seems content working as a dog breeder, Prudie [the delightful Emily Blunt in an emotionally complex role] a married french teacher who finds herself sexually attracted to a young stud at her school, the six times married Bernadette[Kathy Baker] who wishes for another shot at happiness, young, adventurous Allegra who is a lesbian and also Sylvia's daughter, and finally Grigg [Hugh Dancy] a computer whiz and the only guy in the club.The stories of these characters and their lives play out a la the stories in Jane Austen's novels, and it is quite convincingly done. There are many memorable lines of dialogue that tend to stick with you, and what truly makes this movie work is the strong, palbable chemistry between the cast. The acting is above average and very credible, and there is subtle humor throughout which adds to its charm and balances some of the serious themes explored.On the whole, I loved it for its very human portrayal of the complexities within relationships with Austen's works being the sort of manual of love and conduct. My only complaint [as with the book] is how everything is sorted out in the end, kind of like Austen's books themselves.",4,A strong cast and great screenplay make for a charming movie,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1878,"['Being', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'movie/series', 'adaptations', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'book', 'would', 'translate', 'screen', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'well-made.Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Karen', 'Jay', 'Fowler', 'movie', 'centers', 'love', 'lives', 'five', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'book', 'club', 'devoted', 'solely', 'discussing', 'major', 'works', 'Jane', 'Austen', '[', 'Emma', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Persuasion', ']', 'cast', 'characters', 'comprise', 'Sylvia', '[', 'Amy', 'Brennemann', ']', 'who', 'horrified', 'when', 'husband', 'more', '20', 'years', 'Daniel', '[', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', ']', 'woman', 'Jocelyn', '[', 'Maria', 'Bello', ']', 'who', 'single', 'content', 'working', 'dog', 'breeder', 'Prudie', 'delightful', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'role', 'married', 'french', 'teacher', 'who', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'young', 'stud', 'school', 'six', 'times', 'married', 'Bernadette', '[', 'Kathy', 'Baker', ']', 'who', 'shot', 'happiness', 'young', 'adventurous', 'Allegra', 'who', 'lesbian', 'also', 'Sylvia', 'daughter', 'finally', 'Grigg', '[', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', ']', 'computer', 'whiz', 'only', 'guy', 'club.The', 'stories', 'characters', 'lives', 'play', 'out', 'la', 'stories', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'done', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'tend', 'stick', 'what', 'truly', 'movie', 'work', 'strong', 'palbable', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'very', 'credible', 'subtle', 'humor', 'charm', 'serious', 'themes', 'explored.On', 'whole', 'loved', 'very', 'human', 'portrayal', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'Austen', 'works', 'being', 'sort', 'manual', 'love', 'conduct', 'only', 'complaint', '[', 'book', ']', 'how', 'everything', 'sorted', 'out', 'end', 'kind', 'Austen', 'books']",N/A
