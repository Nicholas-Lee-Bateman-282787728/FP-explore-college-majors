As a fan of The Amazing Race, I took a chance based on the reviews and ordered this set to watch with the kids over the break.  The show is engaging, intelligent, and a great mystery to follow (avoid reading spoilers or it will take some of the fun out of the show for you). The show is something of a cross between The Amazing Race and Survivor (more Amazing Race) but with its own uniqueness as well.  The contestants were amazingly well-grouped by the producers and you always think you know who the mole is, and then you don't! We even loved watching the recap show.  It was an intelligent show and I wish I'd caught it when it was on TV so it would still be on!

880623,A3GOJ0VNVZSZPQ,B0007GAEXK,Raymond C. Ruether,"[11, 11]","The Mole is hands-down the classiest of all reality TV shows, and it's great to see the first season of this fantastic show issued on DVD.  The game itself is brilliant, consisting of a group of individuals with a saboteur among them.  The goal is to identify The Mole and complete various challenges, earning money for a group jackpot along the way.  Of course the Mole is there to sabotage the challenges and to keep money from accumulating in the jackpot.  The contestants take a quiz at the end of each round, based on their observations and who they feel the Mole is.  Whoever answers the fewest questions correctly is ""executed"".  This continues round by round until three players remain for the final round:  the winner, the runner-up and The Mole.  A major factor of the game is the trust level among the contestants, many of whom try to cast suspicion upon themselves in order to throw the other competitors off.  The challenges are ingenious, the contestants are cool people who enjoy each other's company for the most part (you won't find any ""I wouldn't give you water if you were dying in the desert"" drama here, folks!) and Anderson Cooper is a class act as the host.  What also elevates this show above the reality TV pack is that the contestants ultimately determine their own fate; they may build coalitions to share information as the game progresses, but their knowledge (or lack thereof) of who the Mole is  determines whether they remain in the game or not (as opposed to the backstabbing and the duplicity of the ""popularity contests"" that are prevalent in virtually every other reality show).  The Mole also features a standout musical score, which fits the show perfectly (see my review for The Mole soundtrack CD).  Add to that the lush photography, picturesque locations, the ""strangers in a strange land"" element (language barriers, culture clashes, etc.) and the chance to guess along with the players and the end result is a fun, intriguing and sophisticated show that the whole family can enjoy.  The entire season is here, and the extras (including deleted scenes, post-execution reactions and audition tapes and casting interviews) are great too.  Unfortunately ABC-TV didn't realize what they had with The Mole, and their virtual lack of marketing and promotion of the show led to its demise, which is truly a shame.  Hopefully another network will rediscover this show for the gem that it is, and we can all look forward to The Return of The Mole (and, dare we dream, the return of Anderson Cooper) sometime soon...

880624,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B0007GAEXK,R. Jensen,"[1, 1]","This season is a gem in terms of how great it is. The tone felt very mysterious at the right times, dark at the right times and light harderd when needed. For a first season it actually doesn't feel like a first season, it's perfectly viewable after seeing any season of the mole (no mattter what country the show was made in). It does carry the cozy feel a first season has, but that allows familerarity with the cast to occur, thus allowing a better viewing expereince.The cast is very entertaining to watch, there isn't a boring person in the bunch, except those who leave to fast to learn completly. Also opinions of some of the cast may change as the show develops, keeping each person fresh and adding to the show. The attachment to the cast is done so well that you feel the same way the constants do. When they win against tough odds you feel happy and when they fail spectacuraly, you feel dissapointed.You should be able to formulate good guesses at the end for who wins the show and who the mole is, which helps the show as, when you can't guess who the winner/mole are the season is far less effective. I won't state who the winner and mole are but I will tell you the winner deserved to win and that the mole was a good mole (Espically since I thought the eventual winner was the mole and that the mole was the winner).All in all a great season of the mole it deserves all 5 stars and a good dvd release.

880625,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0007GAEXK,trebe,"[1, 1]","One of ABC's responses to the success of Survivor, was The Mole, a very different kind of reality show.  Ten contestants compete for a cash prize, but with a twist known to everyone.  One of the players was secretly acting not to win the game, but to mess things up, deceive the other players, and reduce the prize money.  Being able to identify The Mole, is the key to surviving and ultimately winning the game.Spoiler Warning!!!  If you have not watched the program and do not want to know the results, do not continue further.Those who saw the program when it originally aired in 2001, may recall that The Mode was lawyer Kathryn Price.  Even if the outcome is known, viewing the proceedings is still fun, as you observe how things unfolded, see Kathryn do her thing, and hear the speculations of the other contestants about who they believe is The Mole.The game begins in California with a tandem skydive.  The action then shifts to locations in France and Spain.  There the contestants face a variety of tests both as a group, and in smaller teams assigned separate tasks.  Tests include the rescues of other players, a maze challenge, sheep herding, and facing a charging bull.  Anderson Cooper's solemn demeanor adds credibility to the sometimes goofy proceedings.One of the more exciting challenges is the 'Fortress Test', where five contestants, armed with paintball guns, must prevent a team of unarmed attackers from achieving a goal.  At tests involving evasion or military tactics, the players repeatedly prove themselves inept, even though two contestants are involved in law enforcement.  Their dismal failure at the Fortress is no surprise, with Kathryn once again playing a key role in the fiasco.  It is odd that facing unarmed opponents, the players still wear facemasks.  Perhaps they needed protection in case they shot each other?In the game's final exercise, the three remaining players are locked into individual hotel rooms.  They must work together to accomplish a series of tasks, so that each one can exit their room.  A complicated and entertaining final task.With $510,000 as the final prize, the eliminated players are reunited, and the identity of The Mole is revealed.  A summary of The Mole's subversive activities is provided, but an extended detailed revelation would have been more fun.  The so-called `clues' to The Mole's identity are too obscure to be taken seriously.  Contestant audition tapes are included as bonus material.The Mole was very un-Survivorlike as neither direct competition nor teamwork was emphasized as part of the strategy.  Displaying a level of class, contestants stay in upscale hotels.  Food and shelter are of no concern.  The players face ceremonial dismissal, after partaking of a fine meal.  The action seems to proceed at a rather leisurely pace.  With tests sometimes spaced days apart, one wonders what the contestants did during their downtime.  While fun, the series apparently did not have staying power.  A variation on the theme featuring celebrity contestants, Celebrity Mole also fizzled out.",4,Covert operations . . .,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,3070,"['One', 'ABC', 'responses', 'success', 'Survivor', 'was', 'Mole', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'reality', 'show', 'Ten', 'contestants', 'compete', 'cash', 'prize', 'twist', 'known', 'everyone', 'One', 'players', 'was', 'secretly', 'acting', 'not', 'win', 'game', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'deceive', 'other', 'players', 'reduce', 'prize', 'money', 'Being', 'able', 'identify', 'Mole', 'key', 'surviving', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'game.Spoiler', 'Warning', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'program', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'results', 'do', 'not', 'continue', 'further.Those', 'who', 'saw', 'program', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '2001', 'may', 'recall', 'Mode', 'was', 'lawyer', 'Kathryn', 'Price', 'Even', 'outcome', 'known', 'viewing', 'proceedings', 'still', 'fun', 'observe', 'how', 'things', 'unfolded', 'see', 'Kathryn', 'do', 'thing', 'hear', 'speculations', 'other', 'contestants', 'who', 'believe', 'Mole.The', 'game', 'California', 'tandem', 'skydive', 'action', 'then', 'locations', 'France', 'Spain', 'contestants', 'face', 'variety', 'tests', 'group', 'smaller', 'teams', 'assigned', 'separate', 'tasks', 'Tests', 'include', 'rescues', 'other', 'players', 'maze', 'challenge', 'sheep', 'herding', 'facing', 'charging', 'bull', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'solemn', 'demeanor', 'credibility', 'sometimes', 'goofy', 'proceedings.One', 'more', 'exciting', 'challenges', ""'Fortress"", 'Test', 'where', 'five', 'contestants', 'armed', 'paintball', 'guns', 'must', 'prevent', 'team', 'unarmed', 'attackers', 'achieving', 'goal', 'tests', 'involving', 'evasion', 'military', 'tactics', 'players', 'repeatedly', 'prove', 'inept', 'even', 'two', 'contestants', 'are', 'involved', 'law', 'enforcement', 'dismal', 'failure', 'Fortress', 'surprise', 'Kathryn', 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'key', 'role', 'fiasco', 'odd', 'facing', 'unarmed', 'opponents', 'players', 'still', 'wear', 'facemasks', 'Perhaps', 'needed', 'protection', 'case', 'shot', 'other', 'game', 'final', 'exercise', 'three', 'remaining', 'players', 'are', 'locked', 'individual', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'accomplish', 'series', 'tasks', 'one', 'can', 'exit', 'room', 'complicated', 'entertaining', 'final', 'task.With', '510,000', 'final', 'prize', 'eliminated', 'players', 'are', 'reunited', 'identity', 'Mole', 'revealed', 'summary', 'Mole', 'subversive', 'activities', 'provided', 'extended', 'detailed', 'revelation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'so-called', 'clues', 'Mole', 'identity', 'are', 'too', 'obscure', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Contestant', 'audition', 'tapes', 'are', 'included', 'bonus', 'material.The', 'Mole', 'was', 'very', 'un-Survivorlike', 'direct', 'competition', 'teamwork', 'was', 'emphasized', 'part', 'strategy', 'Displaying', 'level', 'class', 'contestants', 'stay', 'upscale', 'hotels', 'Food', 'shelter', 'are', 'concern', 'players', 'face', 'ceremonial', 'dismissal', 'partaking', 'fine', 'meal', 'action', 'proceed', 'rather', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'tests', 'sometimes', 'spaced', 'days', 'apart', 'one', 'what', 'contestants', 'did', 'downtime', 'fun', 'series', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'staying', 'power', 'variation', 'theme', 'featuring', 'celebrity', 'contestants', 'Celebrity', 'Mole', 'also', 'fizzled', 'out']",The Mole - The Complete First Season
