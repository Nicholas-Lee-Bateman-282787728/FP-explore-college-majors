Limitless is Johnny Mnemonic with American Psycho minus the mediocrity and murder.  Ever see Strange Days with Ralph Fiennes?  Yeah, this is the movie it was supposed to be.Bradley Cooper, in his most tolerable role yet,  is a mumbling post modern hippy trying to finish a book.  One day an old friend gives him a skittle on steroids and he becomes a superhero Einstein, stealing a nooner with the landlords woman after impressing her with law speak. Great concept, mostly great execution.Director Neil Burger employs an inventive use of vanishing point zooms to draw us, and our Walter Mitty through the vortex of a speed freak with a bottomless diet of knowledge.  It's a fun ride all the way through.  The disappointments are few.  Robert de Niro  feels superfluous as does the ravishing Abbie Cornish.  Also, despite the hook and ""speed"" of the narrative, it feels like we get short changed in the end as if the story doesn't go as far as we want it too.

My best friend was ranting and raving over vacation about this movie being one of his favorites, and I kind of laughed because I just can't take Bradley Cooper seriously (this was before I finally saw `Silver Linings Playbook' yesterday, so bear with me).  That, and conceptually this just seemed so silly.It is silly, but that isn't the point.The basic premise is that an aspiring writer suffering from severe writer's block and lack of any funds falls into good luck (sort of) when he meets up with his ex-brother-in-law who was a former drug dealer and now is, allegedly, going legit for a pharmaceutical company pimping a drug that unleashes your brains full potential.  He gives our protagonist a free hit, which does its job remarkably well, and soon he's aching for more.  A murder and a burnout later and he's scrambling to keep his addiction, grow his funds and win back his girlfriend, all the while wooing a business prospect.  But things are falling apart, people are tracking him down and a certain thug is trying his hardest to get his hands on more pills.The key to this film working is turning off your brain and allowing the director, Neil Burger, to warp your mind.  The film is executed really well.  For an action thriller, this nails all the right moments to create something engaging and thrilling.  The lighting, the sets, the pacing, the edits and the use of music is all key to propelling the film along.  The cast is decent enough, with Cooper surprising me with the amount of depth he brought to a well written role.  Abbie Cornish is wasted entirely, and De Niro phones in every minute of his screen time, but like I said, the star of the show is Burger.I honestly wanted to hate this, but I liked it quite a bit.",4,"It has its limits, but this sure is fun...",1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,1922,"['far', 'better', 'film', 'gave', 'credit', 'being', 'Limitless', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'film', 'completely', 'flipped', 'seeing', 'finally', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'ranting', 'raving', 'vacation', 'movie', 'being', 'one', 'favorites', 'kind', 'laughed', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'seriously', 'was', 'finally', 'saw', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'yesterday', 'so', 'bear', 'conceptually', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'silly.It', 'silly', ""n't"", 'point.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'suffering', 'severe', 'writer', 'block', 'lack', 'funds', 'good', 'luck', 'sort', 'when', 'up', 'ex-brother-in-law', 'who', 'was', 'former', 'drug', 'dealer', 'now', 'allegedly', 'going', 'legit', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'pimping', 'drug', 'brains', 'full', 'potential', 'protagonist', 'free', 'hit', 'job', 'remarkably', 'well', 'soon', 'aching', 'more', 'murder', 'burnout', 'later', 'scrambling', 'keep', 'addiction', 'grow', 'funds', 'win', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'while', 'wooing', 'business', 'prospect', 'things', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'people', 'are', 'tracking', 'down', 'certain', 'thug', 'trying', 'hardest', 'get', 'hands', 'more', 'pills.The', 'key', 'film', 'working', 'turning', 'off', 'brain', 'allowing', 'director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'warp', 'mind', 'film', 'executed', 'really', 'well', 'action', 'thriller', 'right', 'moments', 'create', 'something', 'engaging', 'thrilling', 'lighting', 'sets', 'pacing', 'edits', 'use', 'music', 'key', 'propelling', 'film', 'along', 'cast', 'decent', 'enough', 'Cooper', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'brought', 'well', 'written', 'role', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'wasted', 'entirely', 'De', 'Niro', 'phones', 'minute', 'screen', 'time', 'said', 'star', 'show', 'Burger.I', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'hate', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit']",Limitless

But if you can get past that as most people do believe we use 10% of our brain, you will enjoy this movie.  Basically the point of it is, what if you became 90% smarter than you were before.Limitless is based off the 2001 book called ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn.  The story centers around Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper), a wannabe writer who somehow has a writing contract, yet he hasn't written one word of his expected novel, he is dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish), who as she put it was his ""cleaning lady"" and his ""bank"".  So basically Eddie is a washed up bum.  But then as a chance of fate, he runs into his ex brother-in-law, Vernon,(Johnny Whitworth) a drug dealer who gives him a pill nicknamed NZT that he says will enhance his creativity and cause him to use 100% of his brain.  At first Eddie seems skeptical but decides to take the pill.  Surprisingly the pill works, and Eddie becomes so smart he is able to write his entire novel in 4 days.Eddie comes to find Vernon to get more pills, and Vernon tells him to get his laundry and bring him breakfast first, Eddie finishes the errands and returns to Vernon's apartment to find the place torn apart and Vernon murdered.  Knowing whoever done this must have been looking for Vernon's stash, Eddie searches all over and finally finds the pill and some cash inside the oven.With his huge supply of pills and some starting capital, Eddie is able to find secret formulas in the stock market and make a ton of cash in just a few days.  A big investor, Carl Van Loon,(Robert De Niro) becomes very interested in him.  Eddie feels he is on top of the world, but there are still some problems.  The drug is highly addictive and if he stops taking it he realizes he loses his intelligence and he becomes very sick.  The drug has strange side effects such as loss of time, and black outs.  Also, a strange man keeps following him, and even tries to kill his girlfriend when she has the pills on her to bring to Eddie when he is suffering from NZT withdrawal.As the movie progresses, Eddie has to deal with all the people that want his drug, and he has to keep finding ways to get more.  He discovers billionaire investors that made all their money because of this incredible drug.

We're big Bradley Cooper fans and this was an exciting drama that kept you guessing throughout the film.  Quick synopsis for you without giving away too much...  Bradly Cooper is a struggling writer with a lack of drive and focus who is floundering through life.  There is a new drug in development that he is introduced to by way of his ex-brother-in-law which unlocks the other 90% of the brain which is not used.  With this increased awareness the user can live without limits as they become hyper aware and able to access all information that they have previously been exposed to.  Unfortunately, there are some terrible and debilitating side-effects and no shortage of people who would kill to get their hands on this drug for themselves.As this is presently under $10 (think I picked it up on super sale for $4), I think it's worth adding to your movie collection.  As someone who is working to move my movies into the cloud, I also picked this version up because it comes with a DigitalCopy code.  While I generally like both iTunes (we have AppleTV's) and UltraViolet (works via our BluRay streaming) codes, for whatever reason the Limitless code is what I can only describe as a handicapped digital version.The reason being you redeem it via iTunes, but the code does NOT entitle you to download or stream the movie through iTunes.  There is also no digital backup available to you to re-download direct from iTunes should you have an issue with the computer you redeem the code on.  Of the 50+ movies I have redeemed via iTunes, this is the ONLY MOVIE that is limited in this regard.  I reached out to iTunes thinking it was bugged, but they referred me back to the publisher as they control the rights to the  movie.  As it stands, the only way to get this to a portable device is to direct sync it with iTunes and there is NO streaming possible via AppleTV.  I know, first world problems... but still, it is extremely annoying if you want to have your digital content be as portable as possible.",5,"Great Movie, Bad Digital Redemption",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2065,"['As', 'far', 'movie', 'concerned', 'thought', 'was', 'great', ""'re"", 'big', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'fans', 'was', 'exciting', 'drama', 'kept', 'guessing', 'film', 'Quick', 'synopsis', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Bradly', 'Cooper', 'struggling', 'writer', 'lack', 'drive', 'focus', 'who', 'floundering', 'life', 'new', 'drug', 'development', 'introduced', 'way', 'ex-brother-in-law', 'other', '90', '%', 'brain', 'not', 'used', 'increased', 'awareness', 'user', 'can', 'live', 'limits', 'become', 'hyper', 'aware', 'able', 'access', 'information', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'exposed', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'terrible', 'debilitating', 'side-effects', 'shortage', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'get', 'hands', 'drug', 'themselves.As', 'presently', '10', 'think', 'picked', 'up', 'super', 'sale', '4', 'think', 'worth', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', 'someone', 'who', 'working', 'move', 'movies', 'cloud', 'also', 'picked', 'version', 'up', 'DigitalCopy', 'code', 'generally', 'iTunes', 'have', 'AppleTV', 'UltraViolet', 'BluRay', 'streaming', 'codes', 'reason', 'Limitless', 'code', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'handicapped', 'digital', 'version.The', 'reason', 'being', 'redeem', 'iTunes', 'code', 'NOT', 'entitle', 'download', 'stream', 'movie', 'iTunes', 'also', 'digital', 'backup', 'available', 're-download', 'direct', 'iTunes', 'should', 'have', 'issue', 'computer', 'redeem', 'code', '50+', 'movies', 'have', 'redeemed', 'iTunes', 'ONLY', 'MOVIE', 'limited', 'regard', 'reached', 'out', 'iTunes', 'thinking', 'was', 'bugged', 'referred', 'back', 'publisher', 'control', 'rights', 'movie', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'portable', 'device', 'direct', 'sync', 'iTunes', 'NO', 'streaming', 'possible', 'AppleTV', 'know', 'first', 'world', 'problems', 'still', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'want', 'have', 'digital', 'content', 'be', 'as', 'portable', 'possible']",Limitless

Overnight you could be about anything you wanted because your ability to absorb would grow a hundred fold. That's the premise of the movie and it does a great job of showing us a story of a writer that can't seem to get his life on track and get his book going. In steps his brother-in-law from a marriage that failed in a chance street meeting. He gives him a gift of a drug as described not FDA approved or properly studied. Therefore the only problem is the lack of background on the long term affects. The pressure of the writers block makes his decision whether to try it easier.Thirty seconds later he realizes he can recall anything he has read or seen and he can describe or do it with a Houdini like ability. He even has the ability to quickly learn languages. Not only does this attract the attention of those that can help him become successful in business, it attracts those that want a piece of whatever he has. In order to get ahead fast he has to borrow money and not from anyone he wants to owe anything. The movie is constantly going forward at a fast pace never looking back. He tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, but they are close behind and he must figure out who they work for and what they know.

Maybe the first 1/3 of the film. While this film was engaging and interesting with a very good idea, it ultimately went nowhere and was not emotionally satisfying. A man suddenly becomes brilliant and needs to borrow money from the Russian mob = FAIL. a hundred grand is not a lot to raise and if you are brilliant, well, what's an extra week of trading to get the money. The mob aspect is where I was lost and the film never really recovered. He became brilliant and finished his novel in 4 days. As a creative writer myself I can tell you, unequivocally and without the need for NZT, that becoming a stock broker and then a politician is not an option or a goal. Creative people don't do that. The idea of day trading to make cash was plausible. Beyond that it was ridiculous, especially given the main character was presented as a creative type. I also still can not get past the poor writing of the need for the MOB to be in this film at all. The film seriously lost me the moment I saw the writing peek through when the day trading was working but not fast enough. C'mon! Why this films good idea needed to be watered down and reduced to mob men attempting to chase and kill the protagonist is beyond me. I was engaged but ultimately let down by a clever idea with a TV show presentation.

He is virtually in every scene and he is magnificent at holding the attention of the viewer as this strange tale unwinds. This is not small feat because watching someone for two hours can certainly become a drag if the actor or actress is not able to constantly evoke energy and tension as the narrative develops. I have never seen the guy in a film before but he certainly convinced me of his skills in this film.The story is witty, a story of a deadbeat writer who can't write and who has run off his girlfriend, played to perfection by Abbie Cornish. I have never seen this lady in a film before but she holds her own. Back to the story - Eddie Morra, the dead-beat writer, is offered some pill by his ex-wife's drug dealing brother. The pill makes every synapse in the brain work overtime and thus every thought, fact, and memory are now accessible at lightening speed. However, like all drugs, what goes up must come down. This film is a nice parable about the actions of drugs, particularly the message that nothing is free in life. Before long, Eddie is involved in more dangerous situations than you can count, and this provides much of the drama of the film.I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending was too nicely wrapped up.

I watched the ""rated"" version, so I'm not sure what was different.Anyway, this is another movie that drew me in with its intriguing premise...a pill which facilitates/compels you to use 100% of your brain rather than just the small fraction that we normally use. It's intriguing to this about what to do with that unlocked potential ability.I felt like Bradley Cooper's character was well developed in such a way as to give us a good juxtaposition of just how far this pill could take you. I was glad it didn't take on a ""superhero"" aspect a la 'Matrix' or something like that, but it was cool to see his interactions and reactions to difficult situations. I also loved that the movie drilled down on the consequences. As the adage goes: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. It was cool to see everything fall apart due to his lack of respect/planning for the power he held.I felt like the movie really expanded on the idea of how much each of us could truly be capable of if we would just stretch ourselves to try and use our full potential (even without a magic pill). Taken back down to us ""normal brain users"", there are good messages there...we should stretch ourselves, we should live up to our own potential, we should set high expectations and try to achieve them, we should set goals, we should plan, we should get off our butts and do something worthwhile.

1436708,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B0051MKMNC,Christopher Engel,"[0, 2]","A premise of an ""ultimate"" drug that temporarily increases your cognitive skills literally exponentially (OK, so they use that stupid idea to explain the drug that we don't use 80% of our brains simply because we, uh, just can't--one of the dumbest myths ever spoken since people started believing Einstein failed math when he had understood it better than almost anyone by the time he was 10 years old--as the official explanation, but it's given by the dealer himself as the explanation, so he gets a pass for just selling it), given to a run-down, poor writer? A predictable, though satisfying, initial course of what happens when the drug wears off, and one needs more to sustain that? A hint that the drug's been around a very long time, and past events were influenced by this not-too-unbelievable ""ultimate"" drug?Just like the drug, sounds too good to be true, but you can't deny that everything is set up for something astonishing to happen.Yet, it doesn't. Around the beginning of the second-half, all character, interesting plot, sub-plots, and thematic developments comes to a near-complete stop. Common sense starts going out the window in a series of odd events in which the main character, and everyone around him, starts to behave in ways that aren't consistent with the events of the first half. They simply disappear from the screen, and by anti-climax, it's pretty much *all* gone except the trailer.It's almost poetic in how this film crashes harder than the not-even-close-to-outside-reality drug and the world on which it's based. It's impossible not to stop at some point during the film and start questioning what every single character is doing, which becomes increasingly more evident as the film's pages seem to stick together in places. All the stuff implicated about his past life being influenced by the drug beforehand? Once it's implicated, it's dropped. The romantic sub-plot? Gone after a point without any real explanation, and is never mentioned again. Even Robert De Niro's role, which starts off promising, takes an almost comedic backseat to astonishingly-implausible situations that lack basic movie coherence.By the time the credits roll, the whole film has changed from something genuinely interesting, provocative, and potentially deep, into a lighthearted, carefree, comedic, drug-infused fantasy that has successfully baited-and-switched what you thought you were going to get the whole time, which is, well, some sort of half-satisfying conclusion. Well, we get what's technically a conclusion, and it doesn't conclude all that much, then literally skips some (if not most) of the somewhat important plot points that you're led to believe are going to *be* the focal point of the climax.Instead, in place of an actual logical conclusion to the plot and the characters it's built up all this time, we get, uh, this screen:""Twelve months later...""And that's literally what happens right when you think the story needs to wind down. When the main character deals with the problems he's caused along with the successes he's created. They outright skip the part you've been anticipating was inevitable: The drop, the consequences, and the kind-of-significant things the character has inadvertently done to others as a result of his dependence, and even his whole life from then on. They cut to a year later, explain it in about two sentences with an absurd outro, and the credits roll, leaving every single answer to every meaningful question anyone could possibly have completely off-screen, with as little exposition as possible in as tight a time as possible.It's like all of a sudden, during the filming phase, a giant buzzer went off indicating they were out of time, the budget *just* hit zero, and everyone involved in making the film says they've got that thing to go to.The ""alternate ending"" provided is only marginally more sensible, but not even close to what one would at least consider courteously wrapping some things up, even if it skips a few minor details that aren't worth it (it happens). It's not exactly the original ""alternate"" or ""controversial"" endings to ""I Am Legend"", ""The Descent"", or ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"", all of which made the title of the film make sense (i.e., the title held all the original meaning in its climax), so don't expect anything like that.The title of the film apparently means something totally different when they coin it again at the end, but it's definitely not a meaning you'd expect (much less want) from a film that set up so much beforehand.",2,A staggeringly inconsistent and incomplete second-half utterly ruins the tension of the

I found the cinematography quite similar to Gaspar Noe's ""Enter The Void"" but still not quite as mesmerizing as Noe's work. The colors were bright and quite nice to look at I might add. The zoom motion that the film begins with and continues to do throughout the film is what I found most similar to Enter the Void. Anyone who enjoys watching trippy types of films (i.e. pi, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, fight club, donnie darko) I feel you'll enjoy this one as well.Entertaining? Yes, I'd say so..The movie picks right up and does not really let go of you once its started. The story is interesting, the visuals are nice to look at and what Cooper's doing is pretty sweet most of the time. There are thrills, suspense, fights and all. There is a hint of a romantic relationship with Bradley Cooper's girlfriend, but not much side stories in this film, which could do both good and bad to the film. You be the one to decide how you feel about it..Does it leave you hanging? In my opinion, yes. I feel the movie realized it was pushing an hour and forty five minutes and that they should wrap it up soon. I honestly would've rather had an extra ten or fifteen minutes so the story could be cleared up. I felt once De Niro and Cooper were starting to collide, the film was over. I really don't prefer to add spoilers to my reviews therefore I won't start, but if you go see the film after reading my comment I'd say just keep in mind...""Does this provide adequate information and answer everything"" Who cares, Go see the movie..I hope I've been helpful...-Cam",4,Entertaining I must say..,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1649,"['Unique', 'Original', 'Not', 'soo', 'much', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'easy', 'get', 'found', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'similar', 'Gaspar', 'Noe', 'Enter', 'Void', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'mesmerizing', 'Noe', 'work', 'colors', 'were', 'bright', 'quite', 'nice', 'look', 'might', 'add', 'zoom', 'motion', 'film', 'do', 'film', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'similar', 'Enter', 'Void', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'trippy', 'types', 'films', 'i.e', 'pi', 'requiem', 'dream', 'eyes', 'wide', 'shut', 'fight', 'club', 'donnie', 'darko', 'feel', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'well.Entertaining', 'Yes', ""'d"", 'say', 'so..The', 'movie', 'picks', 'right', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'once', 'started', 'story', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'are', 'nice', 'look', 'what', 'Cooper', 'doing', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'fights', 'hint', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'much', 'side', 'stories', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'good', 'bad', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'decide', 'how', 'feel', 'it..Does', 'leave', 'hanging', 'opinion', 'yes', 'feel', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'pushing', 'hour', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'should', 'wrap', 'up', 'soon', 'honestly', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'had', 'extra', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'felt', 'once', 'De', 'Niro', 'Cooper', 'were', 'starting', 'collide', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'add', 'spoilers', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'reading', 'comment', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'provide', 'adequate', 'information', 'answer', 'everything', 'Who', 'Go', 'see', 'movie..I', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'been', 'helpful', '-Cam']",Limitless

1436720,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0051MKMNC,C. Sawin,"[3, 7]","Have you ever been really intrigued by the concept of a film, but pretty much knew deep down that the movie would probably suck? That was my initial thought process going into Limitless. The concept of a drug (NZT) actually being able to unlock the maximum capacity of a person's brain with unlimited potential is extremely fascinating to me. Maybe it's because Bradley Cooper has mostly been in subpar films or the fact that Robert De Niro has been giving us ""okay"" to ""what the hell happened to De Niro?"" performances for over a decade, but trailers for Limitless just left you feeling empty like you knew ahead of time that they were going to blow it somehow. Surprisingly enough, Limitless isn't half as bad as expected and may be slightly better than you think.The camera work is probably the first thing you'll notice as the opening credits use a unique zoom-in technique that mostly has us traveling through the back windshield of a countless number of cars in the type of traffic you'd expect in New York. This zoom-in technique is used several times throughout the film and, to be honest, makes you a little nauseous. As intriguing as it was, it actually wound up making me feel like I was just trapped on a carousel stuck on full speed. The use of color was a nice touch, as well. Whenever somebody first used NZT, the world became brighter. It was like they were seeing the world through a new set of eyes. The choreography went on to stand out a few more times throughout the film, as well. When Eddie (Cooper) finally sits down to write his novel, letters begin to rain down from his ceiling. When he first starts the stock market game, he glances up at his ceiling at one point and the tiles begin flipping around as Eddie sees the stock market play out on his ceiling. Things like that were a nice touch to make what would otherwise be an ordinary scene more memorable.The cast seemed rather lukewarm though. Bradley Cooper seemed to give the strongest performance of the bunch, but that's probably because we spend the most time with his Eddie Morra character. Hearing Eddie's narrative throughout the film managed to add a bit more depth though. Hearing his thought process and him voicing how he felt helped add a little to the film and his character. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro were really disappointing though. Cornish was able to display fear in one scene and basically came off as indecisive the rest of the time while seemingly just going through the motions. Robert De Niro has one scene that's fairly memorable; the scene where his character, Carl Van Loon, gives his ""don't make me your competition"" speech. It honestly just seemed like De Niro was grossly misused the entire film while Van Loon felt like a watered down version of De Niro's Senator McLaughlin character in Machete without any sort of ridiculous fun injected into him.The film did seem a little slow to get the ball rolling, but is pretty decent once it picks up around the halfway point. Any film that gets the wheels turning in your head because of its concept or makes you think about what you'd do in their shoes while using this fictitious product isn't all bad, in my book. Films that make you think can be a good thing even if it's something entirely different from what's taking place on-screen. There is one scene involving blood that'll probably make you want to puke. If you were in Eddie's situation, you'd probably do the same thing. But in the meantime, it's really...REALLY disgusting.The biggest downfall for Limitless is that its concept is almost bigger than the rest of the film. The film is centered around this fantastic idea that doesn't seem to be fleshed out to its maximum potential. The final product though isn't all bad. With an intriguing storyline, a strong performance from Bradley Cooper, and some fairly captivating cinematography, Limitless comes off as an above average thriller that you won't feel entirely cheated on seeing that rainy day you decide to see it since nothing else looks good.",3,Better than expected,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,4026,"['Have', 'ever', 'been', 'really', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'deep', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'suck', 'was', 'initial', 'thought', 'process', 'going', 'Limitless', 'concept', 'drug', 'NZT', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'unlock', 'maximum', 'capacity', 'person', 'brain', 'unlimited', 'potential', 'extremely', 'fascinating', 'Maybe', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'mostly', 'been', 'subpar', 'films', 'fact', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'been', 'giving', 'okay', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'De', 'Niro', 'performances', 'decade', 'trailers', 'Limitless', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', 'were', 'going', 'blow', 'somehow', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Limitless', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'better', 'think.The', 'camera', 'work', 'probably', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'opening', 'credits', 'use', 'unique', 'zoom-in', 'technique', 'mostly', 'traveling', 'back', 'windshield', 'countless', 'number', 'cars', 'type', 'traffic', ""'d"", 'expect', 'New', 'York', 'zoom-in', 'technique', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'little', 'nauseous', 'As', 'intriguing', 'was', 'actually', 'wound', 'up', 'making', 'feel', 'was', 'just', 'trapped', 'carousel', 'stuck', 'full', 'speed', 'use', 'color', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'as', 'well', 'Whenever', 'somebody', 'first', 'used', 'NZT', 'world', 'became', 'brighter', 'was', 'were', 'seeing', 'world', 'new', 'set', 'eyes', 'choreography', 'went', 'stand', 'out', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Eddie', 'Cooper', 'finally', 'down', 'write', 'novel', 'letters', 'begin', 'rain', 'down', 'ceiling', 'When', 'first', 'stock', 'market', 'game', 'up', 'ceiling', 'one', 'point', 'tiles', 'begin', 'flipping', 'around', 'Eddie', 'stock', 'market', 'play', 'out', 'ceiling', 'Things', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'make', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'ordinary', 'scene', 'more', 'memorable.The', 'cast', 'seemed', 'rather', 'lukewarm', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'seemed', 'give', 'strongest', 'performance', 'bunch', 'probably', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'Eddie', 'Morra', 'character', 'Hearing', 'Eddie', 'narrative', 'film', 'managed', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'Hearing', 'thought', 'process', 'voicing', 'how', 'felt', 'helped', 'add', 'little', 'film', 'character', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'were', 'really', 'disappointing', 'Cornish', 'was', 'able', 'display', 'fear', 'one', 'scene', 'basically', 'came', 'off', 'indecisive', 'rest', 'time', 'seemingly', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'one', 'scene', 'fairly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'Carl', 'Van', 'Loon', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'competition', 'speech', 'honestly', 'just', 'seemed', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'grossly', 'misused', 'entire', 'film', 'Van', 'Loon', 'felt', 'watered', 'version', 'De', 'Niro', 'Senator', 'McLaughlin', 'character', 'Machete', 'sort', 'ridiculous', 'fun', 'injected', 'him.The', 'film', 'did', 'seem', 'little', 'slow', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'pretty', 'decent', 'up', 'halfway', 'point', 'Any', 'film', 'wheels', 'turning', 'head', 'concept', 'think', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'shoes', 'using', 'fictitious', 'product', ""n't"", 'bad', 'book', 'Films', 'make', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'on-screen', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'blood', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'make', 'want', 'puke', 'were', 'Eddie', 'situation', ""'d"", 'probably', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'meantime', 'really', 'REALLY', 'disgusting.The', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'Limitless', 'concept', 'almost', 'bigger', 'rest', 'film', 'film', 'centered', 'fantastic', 'idea', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'maximum', 'potential', 'final', 'product', 'though', ""n't"", 'bad', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'strong', 'performance', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'fairly', 'captivating', 'cinematography', 'Limitless', 'off', 'above', 'average', 'thriller', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'entirely', 'cheated', 'seeing', 'rainy', 'day', 'decide', 'see', 'nothing', 'else', 'good']",Limitless

Whatever you were thinking when you sat down in the theater, you're transported immediately to somewhere else... wherever that will turn out to be.  Amazing and outstanding!2) The overall plot is Hitchcock-esque.  You don't know what's going to happen, and cliches are out the window.

Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Limitless is a psychological thriller that has the feeling of Strange Days, The Illusionist, Pulp Fiction, and Crank; quite an odd mix of films. Limitless had a lot of style, excellent acting, and a story that I enjoyed.The film opens with an uncomfortable series of shots where the camera flows through the streets of New York City - at times the camera passes through cars and trucks, the color is highly saturated, and there is an odd repeating feel to some of the segments. The director, Neil Burger, uses this technique at exactly the right moments after Eddie takes the mind enhancing NZT drug. Eddie is seen standing on a ledge outside a modern apartment with somebody beating his door down. He is on the verge of jumping. The film then flashes back to how Eddie got there. The flashback story starts showing Eddie as a failure (he hasn't written one word of his novel), looking like a homeless person, and his girl friend breaking up with him. The film is about the effect of NZT on Eddie life and everybody around him.Bradley Cooper did a great job as Eddie Morra. He's come a long way since The Hangover. Cooper had a believable style and grace about him. Abbe Cornish is gorgeous has his girl friend. Robert DeNiro does a pretty good job as the CEO of a huge corporation. What I think made this film so good for me was the script and directing. Neil Burger directed The Illusionist, a film I enjoyed very much. He did a great job showing Eddie on the drug NZT, what his world might look like. There is a fine line trying to make drug induced euphoria look believable in a film; Burger succeeded.I watched the PG-13 version of the film. I can imagine that the R rated version is much better. There were a number of bedroom scenes that were tamed down to the PG-13 level, and would work much better at an R rated level. For parents considering watching this film with their children - this is a rough PG-13. There is a lot of violence, a lot of drug use, a character drinks blood off the floor, and some intense bedroom scenes (there is no nudity). Finally there is the message at the end of the film, I'm not sure a younger person should see this conclusion (essentially the short path is the successful path). A mature thirteen year old might be fine with this movie. It feels like the R rated version is the better choice.There were a few moments where I wondered, why did they do that? It doesn't make a lot of sense; they should have done this other thing. Mostly I could forgive those short lapses in logic; I bought into this film and the story.This was a good film.

1436725,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0051MKMNC,David A. Wend,"[1, 1]","Limitless is a great idea for a movie.  The idea of acquiring fantastic mental powers by simply taking a pill is probably appealing to most of us. The urge to be a genius instead of limited selves is a nice fantasy.  This is exactly where Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper) finds himself.  Eddie begins the film as a perennial looser. He has an advance to write a book but can't find a way to begin or even articulate what the book is about.  Enter Eddie's sleazy former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who has a pill that allows people to access 100% of their brain.(Some Spoiler Below)One doze of the drug (randomly named NZT-48 and definitely not FDA approved) allows Eddie to begin writing a fantastic book and is able to recall things long buried in his memory.  Eddie wants more of the drug and shows up at Vernon's apartment first a little beaten up then very dead and his apartment turned upside down.  Clearly, someone was looking for the NZT - but did they find it?  Eddie starts looking and just as he is about to give up, he discovers a bag filled with pills, money and a notebook with the names of clients.  With the drug, Eddie turns his life around.  He completes his book, becomes a successful investor and the love of his girlfriend Lindsey.  He is noticed by Carl van Loon (nicely played by Robert De Nero) who is a Warren Buffett-like mover and shaker.The story becomes cautionary. Eddie takes more of the NZT than he should and soon begins to experience period when the Hyde part of his personality takes over. He can't remember where he has been or what he has done.  He meets his once brilliant ex-wife who burned out taking the drug and we find out the taking it can lead to severe illness and death. So, who else is on NZT?(End Spoilers)Barry Cooper plays Eddie as a likeable average guy who has nothing but problems.  The drug eliminates his obstacles and he becomes dangerously overconfident as he learns Italian in minutes to impress a woman and understands complex financial data but simply looking at it. Limitless has a lot of suspense as Eddie's life becomes more complicated and he is threatened by someone who clearly knows he has the drug and then by a Russian loan shark named Gennady. Robert De Nero is his professional best in the supporting part of Carl Van Loon, who is impressed with Eddie but also has some reservations.  Abbie Cornish is good as Eddie's girlfriend and Andrew Howard makes an effective villain as Gennady.  The CG work that fills in Eddie's experience when he looses control of the drug pulls and twists what he sees effectively. Anyone who gets motion sickness easily will want to look away.Some reviewers wanted to have more of De Nero in the film but his role was not especially prominent.  The movie is well paced and holds your attention from the start.

Now onto what the film is about... its about a man named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) who is a depressed man that is a writer and struggles to make a living. His life changes when he comes across his ex brother in-law from about 10 years ago when he slips Eddie a pill named NZT that may or may not change his life forever. The purpose of this pill enhances the brains ability and capacity to 100%. Eddie of course takes the pill and he soon finds out that it elevates his ability to think and do things which opens up great possibilities for him.The Movie takes some twist and turns that at points I do not think it could even keep up with them, however this is truly worth watching if not owning then renting.Video QualityThis is a movie that MUST be seen on Blu-ray. We have 2 different looks to the film. One look as a cold, dull, dark and blue look to it while the other has a brighter look with somewhat elevated contrast. The scenes that Eddie is off the pill have the darker tone to it and the scenes when he is on the pill has the brighter look. While the brighter scenes do pop and look excellent, that does not mean that the scenes that are darker look bad. Strong detail and black levels are both exceptionally good in both parts. Moreover, the reason I mentioned that this film must be seen on Blu-ray is because of everything I just mentioned. The mood of the film depends on what exactly Eddie's mood is and we sort of follow him through a maze throughout the entirety of the film so to speak. Simply put, the experience here is quite awesome.Audio QualityThe DTS-HD track is exceptional. Dialogue for the most part is handled very well, except for a few scenes where I felt it was a tad softer. The score of the film is also very good. Music and other sounds throughout the film can be heard clearly. The sound stage does a nice job at whatever is thrown at it. I appreciated the parts that were ""faster"" so to speak with music and other sounds flying around the room.",4,Limitless,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,2368,"['MovieGoing', 'Limitless', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'saw', 'trailer', 'kind', 'brushed', 'off', 'thought', 'myself', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'average', 'thriller', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'nice', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'star', 'roll', 'excellent', 'job', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'acting', 'gig', 'yet', 'performance', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'Now', 'what', 'film', 'man', 'named', 'Eddie', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'depressed', 'man', 'writer', 'make', 'living', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'ex', 'brother', 'in-law', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Eddie', 'pill', 'named', 'NZT', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'purpose', 'pill', 'brains', 'ability', 'capacity', '100', '%', 'Eddie', 'course', 'pill', 'soon', 'out', 'ability', 'think', 'do', 'things', 'up', 'great', 'possibilities', 'him.The', 'Movie', 'twist', 'points', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'even', 'keep', 'up', 'however', 'truly', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'owning', 'then', 'renting.Video', 'QualityThis', 'movie', 'MUST', 'be', 'seen', 'Blu-ray', 'have', '2', 'different', 'looks', 'film', 'One', 'look', 'cold', 'dull', 'dark', 'blue', 'look', 'other', 'brighter', 'look', 'somewhat', 'elevated', 'contrast', 'scenes', 'Eddie', 'pill', 'have', 'darker', 'tone', 'scenes', 'when', 'pill', 'brighter', 'look', 'brighter', 'scenes', 'do', 'pop', 'look', 'excellent', 'not', 'mean', 'scenes', 'are', 'darker', 'look', 'bad', 'Strong', 'detail', 'black', 'levels', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'parts', 'Moreover', 'reason', 'mentioned', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'Blu-ray', 'everything', 'just', 'mentioned', 'mood', 'film', 'what', 'exactly', 'Eddie', 'mood', 'sort', 'follow', 'maze', 'entirety', 'film', 'so', 'speak', 'Simply', 'put', 'experience', 'here', 'quite', 'awesome.Audio', 'QualityThe', 'DTS-HD', 'track', 'exceptional', 'Dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'tad', 'softer', 'score', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Music', 'other', 'sounds', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'clearly', 'sound', 'stage', 'nice', 'job', 'thrown', 'appreciated', 'parts', 'were', 'faster', 'so', 'speak', 'music', 'other', 'sounds', 'flying', 'room']",Limitless

1436744,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0051MKMNC,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""Limitless"" belongs to the group of films that explore the effects of medication/drugs on human behavior, the most famous of which is, of course, ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde."" The best version of Jekyll/Hyde was the 1920 version with John Barrymore, but the idea is so striking that it is one of the most filmed of all of Robert Lewis Stevenson's novels.Other films that deal with this topic include ""Charly"" (1968), ""Awakenings"" (1990), and  ""The Lawnmower Man"" (1992). Intelligence enhancing drugs and their side effects have also be featured in TV's ""Lois and Clark"" and in ""Dune"" (1984).The central theme in all of these films is that whatever progress can be made comes as a cost, and the protagonist usually is seduced into the experiment without full knowledge of the long term consequences. The key point comes when the person realizes the trade off and then must decide how to proceed. Sometimes the decision is not left up to the person (e.g., ""Charly"", ""Awakenings""), although even in these circumstances the person can choose how to accept the consequences even if he is unable to alter them.""Limitless"" is a nice addition to this small group of films, although it tends to blend the illegal with the legal, which I think is an unnecessary addition. The hero, Bradley Cooper, gives a fine performance as the man who slowly comes to learn that his enhanced abilities come at a cost. Cooper is best known to us from his years as the investigative reporter on TV's Alias (2001-6) and from ""The Hangover"" films (2009, 2011).Robert de Niro puts in a brief appearance as an influential businessman and investor who wants Cooper's services as well as access to the miracle drug he uses. Cooper is also dogged by a Russian thug played amusingly by Andrew Howard. The real scene stealer is Anna Friel as Cooper's ex sister-in-law who was one of the first subjects to experiment with the drug.The film moves at a quick pace under the steady hand of Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Interview with the Assassin""). It's enhanced by the fine acting from everyone involved. This film may not be on the same level as ""Jekyll/Hyde"" nor even ""Charly"" and ""Awakenings"" (that also starred de Niro), but it is an entertaining film.",4,What price glory?,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,2219,"['Limitless', 'belongs', 'group', 'films', 'explore', 'effects', 'medication/drugs', 'human', 'behavior', 'most', 'famous', 'course', 'Dr.', 'Jekyl', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'best', 'version', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'was', '1920', 'version', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'idea', 'so', 'striking', 'one', 'most', 'filmed', 'Robert', 'Lewis', 'Stevenson', 'novels.Other', 'films', 'deal', 'topic', 'include', 'Charly', '1968', 'Awakenings', '1990', 'Lawnmower', 'Man', '1992', 'Intelligence', 'enhancing', 'drugs', 'side', 'effects', 'have', 'also', 'be', 'featured', 'TV', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Dune', '1984', '.The', 'central', 'theme', 'films', 'progress', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'cost', 'protagonist', 'usually', 'seduced', 'experiment', 'full', 'knowledge', 'long', 'term', 'consequences', 'key', 'point', 'when', 'person', 'trade', 'then', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'proceed', 'Sometimes', 'decision', 'not', 'left', 'up', 'person', 'e.g.', 'Charly', 'Awakenings', 'even', 'circumstances', 'person', 'can', 'choose', 'how', 'accept', 'consequences', 'even', 'unable', 'alter', 'Limitless', 'nice', 'addition', 'small', 'group', 'films', 'blend', 'illegal', 'legal', 'think', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'hero', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'fine', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'learn', 'enhanced', 'abilities', 'come', 'cost', 'Cooper', 'best', 'known', 'years', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'TV', 'Alias', '2001-6', 'Hangover', 'films', '2009', '2011', '.Robert', 'de', 'Niro', 'brief', 'appearance', 'influential', 'businessman', 'investor', 'who', 'Cooper', 'services', 'as', 'well', 'access', 'miracle', 'drug', 'Cooper', 'also', 'dogged', 'Russian', 'thug', 'played', 'amusingly', 'Andrew', 'Howard', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Cooper', 'ex', 'sister-in-law', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'subjects', 'experiment', 'drug.The', 'film', 'moves', 'quick', 'pace', 'steady', 'hand', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Illusionist', 'Interview', 'Assassin', 'enhanced', 'fine', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'level', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'even', 'Charly', 'Awakenings', 'also', 'starred', 'Niro', 'entertaining', 'film']",Limitless

Also intriguing, though I worried it would turn into a spinoff of the recent flood of superhero movies. Instead, ""Limitless"" is more down-to-earth and more layered.Cooper's character is an author with a book contract, but no ability or discipline to focus that talent. He is losing sleep, relationships, and peace. When he bumps into his former brother-in-law on the streets of New York, that all changes. He is introduced to a new drug, and soon he is flying high on the new energy and focus it gives him, allowing him to access the full potential of brain--but at a cost. If he stops taking the drug, he gets sick and discovers that even death could result. More immediately, though, there are others after this illegal substance and the effects it can produce.Mixing stylistic elements of ""Fight Club"" and story elements of ""Wall Street,"" this movie spins off into its own interesting take on the limits of the human mind and its potential for danger. It also comes across as a veiled expose of the prescription drug industry. Don't get me wrong, though. ""Limitless"" is not a message movie, at least not overtly.

For Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), this comes in the form of NZT, a pill that is designed to enhance a person's cognitive abilities and focus.  Eddie, a failed writer, sees that the possibilities are infinite, as he can become twice the writer he was, and has a newfound mental power that enables him to react to all life's dilemmas. Limitless takes this premise and runs with it, making it a quick-paced, thrilling ride, putting you right in Eddie Morra's world.The director uses both visual effects and quick-paced action along with an engaging script to come up with a film that works and keeps you glued to the screen. Eddie, an antihero or sorts, is a likable loser who drinks too much and has trouble finding jobs, the ability the write, or finding his place in life.  When he begins taking NZT, the positive results are instantaneous--he writes a book in a few days, he plays and wins at the stock market, he impresses his ex-girlfriend, he feels a newfound success. However, as you could probably guess, as things are going too good for Eddie, that things will eventually blow up in his face. He realizes that there are scary side effects and a dark nature to NZT, and that former users have had mysterious and sometimes violent ends. Things really take off as Eddie tries to figure out his world and the effects of the drug amid the chaos of being pursued by thugs.While Limitless does many things well, the ending, in my opinion, was a bit too safe, anticlimactic and tidy, and it's probably the weakest part of an otherwise engrossing film.

Nickles Jr.,"[0, 1]","First, I think it is confusing in the sense that it seems that this movie is basically an advertisement for a pill (i.e.  [...] - which featured Bradley Cooper, which apparently is no longer functioning - and a real clear pill available at webnutrients.com  - so it left me wondering what was real and what wasn't and how there could be a situation where you could take a drug this powerful without going through a doctor, etc..  Apparently there are drugs like this that you can take..  So, I'm wondering what is real and what isn't real...  This is sold as a work of fiction, but it might not be.Also it is confusing in that they have the ending of the movie and the alternative ending (which they should not have included) -  as it made you wonder if they really knew what they were doing when they made the movie.It has lots of action and it is enjoyable to watch.  I really didn't like the golddigger - she dumps him at the first part of the movie because he's down on his luck, but then he starts taking the drugs and starts making the $$$ - then suddenly she is interested in dating him again.  I really disliked this character greatly - and honestly since she dumped him, he should have forgotten about her.The movie really does a good job showing the dangers of taking a pill like this - but it does say that if you are one of these people who just can't pull it together then maybe there's a medication which could be an answer for you.  I would be one of these kind of people.I honestly thought the guy at the first part of the movie was much more likeable than the one at the end.To be honest.  It's almost like he sold his soul to the Devil.  What I didn't like about it is the false messages that money and power are good and being poor isn't good.  Dressing nice is good, not dressing nice isn't good, etc etc.  and you do whatever you need to do even if this drug hurts your body to get the money and the power and the women, even if you have people chasing you trying to kill you all the time - whatever the cost - it is worth it - when in truth it isn't worth it  I think the main character is a jerk.  But that's my opinion, which isn't worth much.It is a good action movie.  I liked the parts with Mr Taxi Driver himself as I think he did a great job in the movie and he spoke much wisdom during the movie..

1436758,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0051MKMNC,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns.  The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page.  He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient').  Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of  major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon  who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie  Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al.  Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York  Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States.  And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film.Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make  so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.

Because, no doubt about it, my end game would involve nothing less than total world domination. So it's maybe better all around that it's Eddie Morra what ends up with the almighty brain boost. Dude seems more altruistic.As LIMITLESS opens, Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) - unfocused, unkempt, and rocking a despicable haircut and a sickly pallor - is getting dumped by his more successful girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). Eddie is a writer suffering one of them horrid writer's blocks, and this is as kicked to the curb as he's ever felt. So who can blame him for ingesting a panacea to his woes - a top secret pill which supposedly unlocks 100% of one's brain power? (Well, yes, you can blame him; kids, don't do drugs, or whatever).And the pill performs as advertised, a happenstance director Neil Burger couldn't wait for because, on cue, he lets loose his first salvo of hyperkinetic, ridiculously inventive visual effects, translating on screen what Eddie must've been experiencing as his IQ is uplifted (to four digits, natch). And, best believe, while Eddie is under the influence, his perspective shifts to that of a warped, sharper-imaged reality. The film's first half is crazy awesome as we track Eddie's segue from hapless slacker to motivated genius. Eddie now can access all the bits of information that have lodged in his brain down the years. And he does what you and I would do. He lives out his wildest fantasies. He tackles foreign languages and tricky math equations and sordid philosophy. He takes on Wall Street with a ferociousness even Gordon Gekko would admire. He even finishes that book, and it looks to be a best-seller. Now, women are easy gets, money accumulated with the alacrity of belly button lint, respect and admiration raked in like leaves on a lawn. Eddie's meteoric rise in high finance soon gets him eyeballed by a ruthless Wall Street baron (Robet DeNiro). And DeNiro's no match for our guy, providing Eddie keeps on digesting them smart tablets on a daily basis. It's sweet that Eddie would want to get back with his ex-girlfriend Lindy. You like him better for it.And then the side effects begin manifesting. They aren't pretty. He begins suffering migraines and memory lapses. Director Neil Burger unveils a passage which breaks down one such memory skip, giving us a distorted quick edit taste of Eddie Morra's out-of-body experience. Maybe the best bit in there is when Eddie is accosted by thugs at a subway station, and Eddie uses memory aid gained from watching Bruce Lee films to whup some butt.And there's a scary Russian gangster.LIMITLESS is one of them films in which I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turns out to be a really good movie, a highly charged, twisty kind of escapism. Bradley Cooper had been in a bunch of ensemble casts; I think this is his first really lead role, and he doesn't waste the opportunity. He turns in a charismatic, self-assured performance. I think it's key that he's able to keep his character as a genuinely nice guy throughout the picture.The third act comes off weaker as the plot degenerates to routine chases and  confrontations. And, honestly, the film lost some of its humanity when it went away from Eddie and Lindy's love story. However, the coda - featuring Bradley Cooper's final run-in with DeNiro - brought back the bravado. I'm not sure how faded Robert DeNiro is from his glory days, but I will say that he and Cooper provide some really watchable moments in their scenes together. Mostly, you can't peel your eyes away from LIMITLESS, with its outrageous premise, its imaginative style and high wire act, and its sheer swagger.

Bonus stuff as follows: audio commentary with director Neil Burger; an alternate and less satisfying ending (00:05:14 minutes long); ""A Man Without Limits"" - focus on Bradley Cooper and what he brings to the role of Eddie Morra (00:04:27 minutes long); and the theatrical trailer.

1436766,A1DSHABB696NEP,B0051MKMNC,"honey and the moon ""hmmm""","[3, 4]","I guess my overall problem with this movie was less about what it's advocating/suggesting and just more about the story in general.  As a story, this movie failed to grip me from the very beginning.  I felt no connection to the main character.  When we first meet Bradley Cooper (at this point, I can't even remember his character's name, and I just finished watching the movie about 5 hours ago) he was down and out.  In the course of five minutes, we see him struggling to write a book (even though he oddly enough already has a contract for what I believe is a fiction--not normal), he loses his girlfriend, and we are told that he lost his first wife several years ago.  But that's it, within five minutes, he gets a drug, his life gets better, and all he ever has to struggle for again for the remaining 139 minutes is to maintain the steady dosages of the drug.  His entire life turns around pretty much.  He gets his girlfriend back, he gets millionaire friends, completes his book, begins trading stocks and hedge funds once he realizes that his life's calling.  I mean, at no point, are we really given a chance to feel for this guy.  As Robert de Niro most aptly pointed out, HE DIDN'T EARN ANYTHING.  He didn't put in work, he didn't put in effort, and yes, we are supposed to believe that his life sucked for a time before all of his success, but we barely see that.  There are a couple of instances where we are led to believe that he almost loses it all--the murder investigation, the sudden sickness, the thugs beating him up, but really, he doesn't even come close.  He's definitely not the standard protagonist and in 144 minutes, the writer's could not even develop his role so as to make him more human, more accessible, and somehow reconcile the person he became with the ""bum"" he once was.  If they had, I think we would get a character worthy of a movie.

In fact at the time, there wasn't even one rating. But the trailer was there. So, I watched it. Hmmm, I thought? Looks pretty good. Looks funny. Well of course, the only good parts are shown in the trailer. I know I sound harsh. I'm sorry. Believe it or not, I give most movies a pretty good rating. Really!

Alvi,"[5, 5]","The concept is intriguing: take a pill that massively increases brainpower to the extent that you far surpass nearly everyone else, and then seen how your life changes because of that.  The benefits are impressive: rapidly finishing challenging projects, learning new languages with ease, making big money by discerning patterns no one else can, becoming irresistible to attractive women, and generally moving up in the world.  But of course there's also no free lunch, since other people (including bad guys) will take notice and want a piece of the action, plus the pill itself turns out to be addictive and has serious side effects, including potential death.While I enjoyed the exploration of this concept, and the acting was also pretty good (De Niro stood out), my one complaint is that the plot construction seemed somewhat haphazard in an amateurish way, which really took away from the believability of the movie, so I found it hard to stay fully engaged.

1436770,A35FIQ83PE0E07,B0051MKMNC,Irikefe Okonedo,"[2, 3]","Techno-thriller in which Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a burnt-out writer whose life is at a dead-end: he has writers block so can't finish that book that should have been finished months ago, is behind on the rent and his girlfriend Lindy (played by Abbie Cornish) has dumped him. All of that changes after a chance encounter with his former brother-in-law Vernon Gant (played by Johnny Whitworth) who he hasn't seen in 9 years. His brother-in-law is a drug dealer and gives him a pill that enables one to access all of the mind's potential. The pill is an experimental drug called NZT-48. Whereas before you would only be using 10% of your brain now you would be using all of your brain. And this miracle drug changes Eddie's life, transforming him into a genius with hitherto unknown levels of motivation: in 4 days he finishes the book he has been trying to write for months, charms the landlord's wife so he doesn't get thrown out of his apartment (and sleeps with her), learns how to fight from recalling martial arts movies he saw on TV, lands a job as a stockbroker, gets back with his girlfriend, starts making new and wealthy friends, starts appreciating (and finding useful) mathematics, discovers he can quickly learn anything he puts his mind to and gains an appetite for culture. But all is dependent on the pill: when the effects of the pill wear off he goes back to being the old Eddie. Eddie has a stash of the NZT-48 pills because he retrieved them from Vernon's apartment after discovering that he had been murdered shortly after they met. But now the same people that killed his brother-in-law are after him because they want the drug. And NZT-48 has side-effects: Eddie has been having black-outs, spells of dizziness and even vomiting, perhaps because he has been taking too much of the drug. But Eddie is ambitious and wants to make his mark on the world. He cannot stop taking the drug. He wants to invest money but the banks won't lend so he borrows $100,000 from a Russian gangster / loan shark who threatens to `flay him alive' if he doesn't repay. When he meets with his ex-wife Melissa Gant (played by Anna Friel) who informs him that she used to also take NZT-48 and it nearly killed her, Eddie must decide: is risking his life worth becoming limitless? Furthermore an important business deal for business mogul Carl Van Loon (played by Robert De Niro) who he works for is in danger of going belly-up, and Eddie needs this deal to succeed if he is going to get to where he wants in life. And when the Russian gangster that lent him money comes to collect and gets Eddie's last NZT-48 pill off of him and takes it and becomes a genius himself, Eddie's life just might be forfeit because the gangster wants more of the drug and will kill Eddie if he doesn't get it. Will Eddie survive all of these challenges and achieve his goals? A most enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. The film is not perfect however: for instance where the NZT-48 drug comes from is never explained, it doesn't make sense that Eddie is the ultimate genius but doesn't think to make sure that he pays back on time the loan he owes to a vicious loan shark / Russian gangster, we do not see how Eddie lands a stockbroker's job and hence ends up working for Robert De Niro's character Carl Van Loon and the ending of the film is a bit contrived. Nonetheless the film holds your attention throughout and has a most fascinating premise: what would you do if you were limitless?

Really? The imagination of the writers were certainly limited, and that's too bad, because this film had its unlimited potential reach only about 5-20% of its capacity (depending on whom you believe).This isn't a smart film. It is a trick; a gimmick with no real substance.There are, however, few saving graces. Bradley Cooper (main character) is very convincing as an actor. I am convinced if he reaches 100% of his acting potential, he would be worthy of an Oscar, and he is far more than 20% there.Before anyone tries to copy the concepts of this film and make yet an another script of enhanced-brainpower person making riches in Wall Street, then I suggest such person take more NZT 48 and enhance his/her own brain function first.And how come the brother-in-law gets himself killed? Doesn't he know taking that pill will save his life from assasins? And how come he never gives it to those who want it? I mean it's for sale. Just sell it.

1436773,A13EQE9EY2ET93,B0051MKMNC,Jaime Moreno,"[0, 2]","""It works better when you're smart to begin with,"" (or something like that). This is one of the great lines in the movie and pretty much sums up the movie in one sentence although for me it goes more like this:""The movie works better when you're not too smart to begin with,"" (or something like that).The reason I say that is because first of all the initial premise of the movie i.e. you can utilize 100% of your brain is flawed. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we use only 10% of our brains. We already use 100% of our brains! The 10% statement may have been started with a misquote of Albert Einstein. If we didn't then we wouldn't have all these people that are crippled for life after a bullet to the brain or any other brain trauma for that matter since most of it isn't used anyways! Anyways, knowing this I still gave the movie a chance since it seems to be pretty popular so it must still be worth watching I figured.And it is worth watching for the entertainment value it provides and the special effects.I really dug how they did the drug effect's. Anyone who has come down off of a caffeine high, smokers high, or any other non natural drug should be able to relate to how Eddie Morra feels and the associated withdrawal of coming off drugs. Although, some of the effects did enter LSD/peyote territory with strange future like flashbacks.The film did a pretty good job of portraying what it feels like to be considered highly intelligent. Like they say knowledge is power and it's just like in the movie when you are smarter than all those around you first of all your confidence it greatly improved. If someone is trying to kill you as we see with his girlfriend in the park you don't cry like a baby because you see 10 different ways to defend yourself using your brain and instantly jump into action. You become fearless to a certain degree. Intelligence will tell you in 9 out of 10 cases best thing is to run away. That is why the fight scenes with Eddie weren't realistic at all because even if he knew all the moves from reading or watching movies he would still need practice to skillfully execute the moves. It'd be like being able to read music and know how an instrument works doesn't mean you can actually play one! Learning multiple languages was not far fetched since he would have the memory recall and mental speed to pick it up quick. Once again he would not come off as smooth sounding as in the movie unless he lived in those countries learning the language because there are some things you just can't pick up in books. For example, when I lived in Japan I decided to learn the language from a book it was easy enough but when I went out in the street and actually talked to the Japanese they thought some of the stuff I said was funny or archaic since it's not used it everyday speech. I guess a  As we saw with Eddie at a cocktail party no topic is off limits because your superior intellect allows you to store tons of vast amounts of useless but entertaining information. It can come in handy sometimes though like with the law school girl in his apartment complex and yes you are able to recall information you've skimmed or seen on tv years ago although sometimes you do have to dig a bit and it may not be as accurate as portrayed in the movie. The again the thing with being highly intelligent is that others rarely question your information because their limited recall of facts and figures rarely allows them to dispute these vast stores of information in your brain. I didn't find the whole getting laid due to intelligence credible in real life but in the movie Eddie is not only good looking but intelligence so I guess it's a win win situation for him.The other part I found believe and liked was how the movie showed that even though this guy is now super intelligent it doesn't mean he's going to take over the world nor does it even guarantee any sort of success at all. For example, just like in real life he has to go out and try to find someone willing to loan him some cash to really get his feet off the ground and if he was really smart I can't imagine him going to a shady person for it unless he did the risk/benefit ratio analysis beforehand and even then I don't think any benefit is worth getting cut at the waste as having your skin tied around your head as the Russian mafia guy mentioned. Also, later in the movie the DeNiro character mentioned gave him some wise advice and tried to show him intelligence is only a tiny part of the picture in being successfull in business telling him how backroom deals, networking, etc also play a big part.Now the downsides to being smart is that you see flaws everywhere and this is how it ties in to this probably being a better movie for those that aren't too smart because first of all you'll fall for the 100% brain thing and think geez wouldn't it be cool to be supersmart? Yeah it can be cool at times like I mentioned but then there are the downsides like the flaws which you try to ignore but cannot since they stick out like a sore thumb. It's just like when Eddie was looking over the documents DeNiro handed him in the limo and right away he was able to see all the flaws and errors. So it's the same when watching the movie. They aren't too bad but the twists don't work too good though since you already know way ahead how things will end.*** SPOILERS ***For example the lawyer stealing the pills out of coat.Other mysterious guy coming out of nowhere also taking pill.DiNiro character asking for favor.The film started off strong and did pretty good at being consistent till near the end where it seems that the writer got in over their head and so they started inventing stuff to conclude it. For example, Eddie almost killed by Russian mob because he ran out of pills but someone at last minute he stabs guy and drinks his blood and saves himself. Don't know how they left this flaw in film since even Russian guy explained that shooting up drug more faster since it goes straight to brain. Licking it up off floor would be same as swallowing tablet! Even after all this Eddie shrugs off all deaths in apartment as done by previous tenants although if cops even did basic job they would find his blood prints on knife, etc. which would easily implicate him in murders!  And after all these questionable deaths surrounding him he's still able to get himself elected to the senate? Finally, biggest flaw in movie is that we saw earlier in movie that anyone taking the pill would have shortened life and yet he comes out that oh yeah I found a way to keep myself smart without using the pill which isn't fully explained. Then again that's more how real intelligence works there is no off switch like a pill. I guess you need to read the book as someone mentioned to fill in the gaps.Finally, primarily because of Western cultures lack of esteem for intellectual values, Eddie Morra wouldn't be so happy and tend to be unhappier than average. I mean he loses his girlfriend and doesn't seem any the sadder compared to the start of the movie!Speaking of his girlfriend she seemed to be one of the more believable and sane characters in the movie. I mean she basically dumped him when he admitted he was doing drugs and didn't see anything wrong with that and using that to get ahead in life. Sort of like the recent string of steroid scandals. Looking back I guess some people could argue that the movie was just one big/long ad like those you see on television for anti-anxiety, viagra, etc.",4,"""It works better when you're smart to begin

With this new drug, you can literally do anything you can think or dream of, it opens and expands your mind and taps into that part of your brain that we supposedly never even use.  It's hard to see the downside of such a drug, at first.  Until our protagonist learns of long time users dying from addiction or even trying to stop.  When he tries to stop, he suffers first hand how sick he becomes and longs for another taste of the success the drug unleashes inside him.Such an amazing film with great special effects, great actors, and great life lessons and realism on drugs.(SPOILER ALERT) Alternate EndingI was a bit disappointed, however, with the alternate ending this DVD version offered, it was anticlimactic in comparison to the original, which of course is why it was cut and they went with the original, but I just expected more, all the same.

That being said, a lot of people will like it, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone.  The protagonist pursues drugs, money, sex, and power with little restraint while managing to escape a lot of natural negative consequences.  Five-word synopsis: Drug brings man material success.In a moment that almost gives hope to those of us with a sense of morality, Robert DeNiro's character cautions the protagonist about his rapid rise in status, saying that he did not earn it like others have.  At this point I felt like there might actually be a moral to the story, but as the movie continues the word of warning turned out to be hollow; the film scoffs at morality, paints a man who is not good as the good guy, and heaps material reward upon him.  Meanwhile, viewers are shown some rather disgusting violence.The acting and direction is done well enough, but it led me to a place I didn't want to go.  However, some people will enjoy this fancifully amoral fantasy.Note: I didn't see the Unrated Extended Cut, but I can only assume that it is even worse than the theatrical release.",1,Moral-less,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,1203,"['Limitless', 'only', 'irresponsibly', 'indulge', 'fantasies', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'rich', 'attractive', 'sexually', 'active', 'being', 'said', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'protagonist', 'pursues', 'drugs', 'money', 'sex', 'power', 'little', 'restraint', 'managing', 'escape', 'lot', 'natural', 'negative', 'consequences', 'Five-word', 'synopsis', 'Drug', 'brings', 'man', 'material', 'moment', 'almost', 'hope', 'sense', 'morality', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'character', 'protagonist', 'rapid', 'rise', 'status', 'saying', 'did', 'not', 'earn', 'others', 'have', 'point', 'felt', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'moral', 'story', 'movie', 'word', 'warning', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'hollow', 'film', 'scoffs', 'morality', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'good', 'good', 'guy', 'material', 'reward', 'Meanwhile', 'viewers', 'are', 'shown', 'rather', 'disgusting', 'violence.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'led', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'However', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fancifully', 'amoral', 'fantasy.Note', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'even', 'worse', 'theatrical', 'release']",Limitless

That is what Eddie Morra (played by Bradley Cooper) is presented with when his drug dealing ex brother in law hands him a pill to help him with his failing life. Feeling he has nothing to lose Eddie tries the pill and finds it works beyond his wildest imagination. Now armed with what he describes as ""Limitless"" capabilities to learn and use knowledge, Eddie quickly finds he effortlessly is able to navigate up the social-economic ladder. But the pill comes with side effects, as do most drugs, which threaten to not only derail his success but end his life.Every aspect of Limitless is interesting and creative. The director, Neil Burger, makes bold choices in camera angles and lightening that really draw the audience into the world of the lead character. The story follows a logical build up of its plot without holes or requiring the audience to take a giant leap of faith of plausibility. The casting was spot on, particularly Robert De Niro, who plays a heartless business tycoon. De Niro is at his very best in his supporting role. Bradley Cooper has a breakout performance as he capably shifts from your average uninspired burnout writer, to a man who has the world in the palm of his hand, to a drug addicted addict suffering from paranoia. It's a tough role and Cooper makes it seem effortless.The entire concept is thought provoking and Limitless treats it's concept well. The movie kept me guessing what may happen next the whole way through and the twists at its conclusion are great. There is really nothing not to like in this movie and I give it my highest recommendation.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 4]","Science fiction, action, and thrills work through a twisty plot finally to catapult Bradley Cooper into his rightful place as an actor who can hold a film equal with Robert DiNero. His grunge is as equally convincing as his brilliance (but, of course, his brilliant role shows handsome good looks to advantage and a good swoon to those who see).The sci-fi premise is revealed in a clear pill that contains ingredients that enhance brain power from the basic 20% we use to 100%. Imagine! As a man who has wasted years of his life trying to write and living the rejected writer's life, he is given a pill that can literally give him a new lease on life. Is this pill approved by the FDA, as the provider promises? At this point, who cares? Eddie Morra (Cooper) certainly doesn't and in a very limited time space, gulps it. At the initial use of this synaptic pulse that ignites a dynamo, the landlord's wife is berating him for rent abuse. Director Neil Burger brilliantly reveals visually the course this synaptic bursts take from one point to the next in expanding Eddie's brain. Everything he has ever heard or seen or read are ordered into a seemingly limitless variety of ways that can help Eddie achieve.And so he does. He writes that book, but in another moment of clarity, he sees the direction his life can take. Again, the director's message is that whatever personality traits a person has, that is where the drug reaches in to enhance. His girlfriend takes one pill to elude a strong-arm and learns that she has a sharp, scary side she does not want to revisit. Evil is personified through other characters who also take the drug. Eddie's ambition seems limitless. But then so do the after effects that the drug slams on the userOther reviewers criticized what they saw as plot holes. I saw them as eccentricities in a story of man's chance to really do something significant. For significance is the final direction Eddie Morra takes. The film has one of those really satisfying, pleasing endings that the viewer cannot predict.In a society in which women enhance their physical attributes, men enhance their sexual and athletic performances, ""Limitless"" asks us to study the effects of one man reaching the limits of his intelligence, and then some. It's a job well done: the movie, the performances, the visual effects, the action, the theme.",5,"Finally, Cooper gets a worthy film!",1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2355,"['Science', 'fiction', 'action', 'thrills', 'work', 'twisty', 'plot', 'finally', 'catapult', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'rightful', 'place', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'film', 'equal', 'Robert', 'DiNero', 'grunge', 'equally', 'convincing', 'brilliance', 'course', 'brilliant', 'role', 'handsome', 'good', 'looks', 'advantage', 'good', 'swoon', 'who', 'see', '.The', 'sci-fi', 'premise', 'revealed', 'clear', 'pill', 'ingredients', 'enhance', 'brain', 'power', 'basic', '20', '%', 'use', '100', '%', 'Imagine', 'man', 'who', 'wasted', 'years', 'life', 'trying', 'write', 'living', 'rejected', 'writer', 'life', 'given', 'pill', 'can', 'literally', 'give', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'pill', 'approved', 'FDA', 'provider', 'promises', 'point', 'who', 'Eddie', 'Morra', 'Cooper', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'very', 'limited', 'time', 'space', 'initial', 'use', 'synaptic', 'pulse', 'dynamo', 'landlord', 'wife', 'berating', 'rent', 'abuse', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'brilliantly', 'visually', 'course', 'synaptic', 'bursts', 'take', 'one', 'point', 'next', 'expanding', 'Eddie', 'brain', 'Everything', 'ever', 'heard', 'seen', 'read', 'are', 'ordered', 'seemingly', 'limitless', 'variety', 'ways', 'can', 'help', 'Eddie', 'achieve.And', 'so', 'book', 'moment', 'clarity', 'direction', 'life', 'can', 'take', 'Again', 'director', 'message', 'personality', 'person', 'where', 'drug', 'enhance', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'pill', 'elude', 'strong-arm', 'sharp', 'scary', 'side', 'not', 'want', 'revisit', 'Evil', 'personified', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'also', 'take', 'drug', 'Eddie', 'ambition', 'limitless', 'then', 'so', 'do', 'effects', 'drug', 'slams', 'userOther', 'reviewers', 'criticized', 'what', 'saw', 'plot', 'holes', 'saw', 'eccentricities', 'story', 'man', 'chance', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'significant', 'significance', 'final', 'direction', 'Eddie', 'Morra', 'film', 'one', 'really', 'satisfying', 'pleasing', 'endings', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'predict.In', 'society', 'women', 'enhance', 'physical', 'attributes', 'men', 'enhance', 'sexual', 'athletic', 'performances', 'Limitless', 'study', 'effects', 'one', 'man', 'reaching', 'limits', 'intelligence', 'then', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'performances', 'visual', 'effects', 'action', 'theme']",Limitless

I was glued to my seat the entire time, and appreciated the unique storyline, in a sea of predictable alien/robot/superhero action films. Bradley Cooper plays a down-and-out writer, actually a bit of a loser that can't quite get it together, who stumbles upon a new off-the-market drug that maximizes brain potential to such a degree that he (and other who have possession of it) can completely transform their lives. He becomes a 'master of the universe' - first writing his long-delayed book in 4 days, and then turning his sights to the financial markets. The action involves his battles with others trying to steal his stash of drugs, his attempts to understand the side-effects, and to figure out how to extend his limited supply. In the meantime, he is attempting to impress Robert DeNiro who plays a financial king, as part of his path to wealth and power.This is really the first time I have taken any real notice of Bradley Cooper, and I think he does a great job here. He is better suited for quirky, somewhat twisted roles like this one than standard leading man roles I think. Robert DeNiro is always fun to watch, and the supporting cast does what they need to do.There were minor weaknesses in the plot - how did Cooper's loser writer character ever get a book contract? Why isn't there some kind of adjustment period to achieving maximum brain potential? How is this drug kept secret except to a very few? etc. But overall, it delivers action, is not predictable, and Bradley Cooper gives it his all, so I think it deserves a 5-star rating.",5,A Great Surprise - Thoroughy Enjoyed,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1661,"['expectations', 'were', 'low', 'so', 'maybe', 'am', 'over-rating', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'glued', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'appreciated', 'unique', 'storyline', 'sea', 'predictable', 'alien/robot/superhero', 'action', 'films', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'down-and-out', 'writer', 'actually', 'bit', 'loser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'together', 'who', 'new', 'off-the-market', 'drug', 'brain', 'potential', 'degree', 'other', 'who', 'have', 'possession', 'can', 'completely', 'transform', 'lives', ""'master"", 'universe', 'first', 'writing', 'long-delayed', 'book', '4', 'days', 'then', 'turning', 'sights', 'financial', 'markets', 'action', 'battles', 'others', 'trying', 'steal', 'stash', 'drugs', 'attempts', 'understand', 'side-effects', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'extend', 'limited', 'supply', 'meantime', 'attempting', 'impress', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'financial', 'king', 'part', 'path', 'wealth', 'power.This', 'really', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'taken', 'real', 'notice', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'think', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'better', 'suited', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'twisted', 'roles', 'one', 'standard', 'leading', 'man', 'think', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'what', 'need', 'do.There', 'were', 'minor', 'weaknesses', 'plot', 'how', 'did', 'Cooper', 'loser', 'writer', 'character', 'ever', 'get', 'book', 'contract', 'Why', ""n't"", 'kind', 'adjustment', 'period', 'achieving', 'maximum', 'brain', 'potential', 'How', 'drug', 'kept', 'secret', 'very', 'few', 'etc', 'overall', 'action', 'not', 'predictable', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'think', '5-star', 'rating']",Limitless

1436819,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0051MKMNC,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[19, 57]","This is a drug film. It came across as a not even thinly veiled ode to the greatness of Methamphedamine (Speed) and/or Cocaine. Its compleatly unashamed in its message and it doesn't take one step back from it all the way to the end. The message is that drugs are great and that all the risks can be managed by a smart addict. All the scifi aspects of the film do is serve to exaggerate the real-world boost of drugs.All the hallmarks are here. The world becomes brighter when the drug is taken. He goes and parties continuously for days. He can crank out work. He suddenly starts cleaning his apartment compulsively in the middle of the night. he forgets to eat. He does damage to his body. He has blackouts. His woman friend who was on the drug for a long time is now prematurely aged. We even get the guys drug dealer disguised as a high-interest loan shark. And you get large numbers of contemporaries dying. There is even all the addict paranoia about hiding and losing a pile of drugs. They also have him so in love with his drugs that he literally licks them off the floor.And best of all, they use two professions in the film where drug use is rather common (wall street and writers).But what the film gets wrong is that drugs don't make people smarter or teach them foreign languages instantly. They speed you up and give you limitless energy and make you more confident. You can get more done, but not because your smarter. But because you can work 2x to 3x longer.Where the film falls down is in showing the long-term price. It didn't show his body wearing out. It didn't show the paranoia or the teeth falling out. It didn't show that as drug use goes on you get diminishing returns. You may be able to crank out pages in a book, but they cease to be good pages. They also miss the costs of not being able to properly sleep.On the positive side, right up to the happy ending its probably one of the best films I can think of in capturing the deluded mentality of a new heavy drug addict. But its not generally a good message to be out pushing. And the film doesn't capture at all what happens in the long term.The plans of the main character are fairly lame. He wants to get rich on wall street and the become president. Why? He has a plan to make everything better. And typical of drug logic, we never find out what that plan is. I also don't remember if we ever found out if he had or had not killed a woman during a blackout. But he clearly is involved in the murder of a lawyer for messing with his stash.I could have lived with the film minus the happy ending. But ending it in the way they did made a pro-drug film.Robert De Niro is in the film basically doing a character actor role as the big man on wall street. Its a completely workmanlike performance. His name on a film still sells tickets but you really wonder how many times can get away with it putting his name on something he has no personal investment in.Somebody came up with a new continous zoom effect for the film. Its an interesting effect and it communicates well to the viewer the sense of being trapping at full speed thats at the heart of the film. Its maybe used a little too much and they pulled it out way too early. But it was a nice original touch.The film is essentially told from the narrative point of view of the main character. Bradley Cooper pulls it off well. His girlfriend is basically a prop character.Technically and in terms of acting, its a good film. But the script and its message are rather questionable.-----Postscript:The alternate ending available on the DVD/BD is an improvement on the original. Rather than having him get everything for *free*, the alternate ending makes it clear that nothing has changed and he is still ruled by drug logic. As he himself says at one point, the answer to the drug is the drug. the drug will tell him how to get better or get off the drug. To me the ending as much as says that the spiral downward he has been on in the second half of the film will only continue. The alternate ending seems much truer to the overall concept of the film.The audio commentary is interesting. The final ending was apparently supposed to present more ambiguity than IMO it did. We were supposed to wonder if all his talk at the end was an enormous bluff. Though that seems to have been the intentions, what they did ultimately in my opinion didn't push that message. And the ""dinner"" ending undercut any ambiguous ending.The extras are not all that interesting. There is a uesless thing which seemed to be about how great Bradley Cooper is. Its only virtue was that it was short.

1436820,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0051MKMNC,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are movies made with fantastic premises that you just want to see. The previews make them out to be something new and original and thrilling. And then you see them and think wow...that was...okay. Unfortunately most movies just don't live up to the hype. Such was the case with LIMITLESS, a good movie but one that just wasn't great.Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a down on his luck writer with one mediocre novel published and a case of writer's block. Just when he thinks things can't get worse, his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) dumps him. Walking down the street after she turns him lose, he comes across an old ""friend"", the brother of his ex-wife (of one day) Vernon (Johnny Whitworth).Back in the day Vernon was a dealer and Eddie wants nothing to do with him. But he seems cleaned up, cleanly dressed and doing well for himself. During lunch he passes a new drug to Eddie, tells him that it's about to be FDA approved and that it will help him. The drug helps the person taking it use their entire brain potential. While its said human's only use perhaps 20% of their brain, this one kicks in the entire 100%.On his way to his apartment Eddie takes the drug thinking he has nothing to lose and runs into his landlord's girlfriend on the steps. As she berates him for not having the rent, the drug kicks in and he not only talks his way out of the chastising but beds the girlfriend as well. The drug actually works. So much so that Eddie changes his lifestyle, writes the book he was working on in 2 days and it turns out to be perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.Then he comes down off the drug. He finds Vernon to get more and Vernon now has Eddie where he wants him, doing his bidding. Eddie sets out to get Vernon's dry cleaning only to return and find Vernon with a hole in his head and the apartment trashed. Whoever showed didn't get what they came for, Vernon's stash of the drug. But Eddie figures out where it is and becomes a regular user.He gets his life back on track, learns languages in less than a day, wins back his old girlfriend and starts a new life for himself, all with this limited supply of pills. He cashes in on financing, goes to work for his broker and is introduced to one of the top moneymen in the country, Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). This leads to a job with Van Loon and the chance to turn what he's learned into millions if not billions for the company and himself. It also gives him access to possibly having someone make more of the drug.But it all comes at a cost. The loan shark who gave him the money to invest originally now is taking the drug and wants more. And whoever it was that killed Vernon is trying to find him as well. Eddie has risen from the worst position possible to the highest and yet still has problems, just different ones, ones that could cost him his life.The movie has a terrific look to it, clean and sleek and fast. When the drug kicks in we look through the eyes of Eddie as well as from the outside, seeing that things move so much faster in his mind that the world seems to be in slow motion. And while Eddie's brain increases in capability, he doesn't seek to do harm to anyone but rather intends to do nothing more than take care of himself and those that matter to him. But as they say the best intentions...Cooper does a great job, shifting in acting modes as well as appearances from the down and out Eddie to the more successful one. He carries off the performance well and is completely believable. Cornish feels as if she's just there and DeNiro makes the most of what is essentially a supporting role.For all the great story that is found here it just comes off as a decent flick that doesn't completely fulfill it's potential. Perhaps that's just my expectations not being met, but I just felt that the movie was nothing more than another in a long line of films that are entertaining but not memorable. And honestly, there don't seem to be that many being made any longer.Most will find the movie is an enjoyable film that will keep you guessing until the end. And the ending itself was one of the best I've seen in some time. So if you're looking for a solid movie to rent this week then by all means give this one a try. It may not stick in your mind forever but it will give you a pleasant night watching a movie.",3,THE EXPANDED MIND,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,4330,"['are', 'movies', 'made', 'fantastic', 'premises', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'previews', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'new', 'original', 'thrilling', 'then', 'see', 'think', 'wow', 'was', 'okay', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Such', 'was', 'case', 'LIMITLESS', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great.Bradley', 'Cooper', 'stars', 'Eddie', 'Morra', 'down', 'luck', 'writer', 'one', 'mediocre', 'novel', 'published', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'girlfriend', 'Lindy', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Walking', 'down', 'street', 'lose', 'old', 'friend', 'brother', 'ex-wife', 'one', 'day', 'Vernon', 'Johnny', 'Whitworth', '.Back', 'day', 'Vernon', 'was', 'dealer', 'Eddie', 'nothing', 'do', 'cleaned', 'up', 'cleanly', 'dressed', 'doing', 'well', 'lunch', 'new', 'drug', 'Eddie', 'be', 'FDA', 'approved', 'will', 'help', 'drug', 'person', 'taking', 'use', 'entire', 'brain', 'potential', 'said', 'human', 'only', 'use', 'perhaps', '20', '%', 'brain', 'one', 'entire', '100', '%', '.On', 'way', 'apartment', 'Eddie', 'drug', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'lose', 'runs', 'landlord', 'girlfriend', 'steps', 'not', 'having', 'rent', 'drug', 'kicks', 'not', 'only', 'talks', 'way', 'chastising', 'girlfriend', 'as', 'well', 'drug', 'actually', 'So', 'much', 'Eddie', 'lifestyle', 'book', 'was', 'working', '2', 'days', 'out', 'be', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'books', 'ever', 'written.Then', 'down', 'drug', 'Vernon', 'get', 'more', 'Vernon', 'now', 'Eddie', 'where', 'doing', 'bidding', 'Eddie', 'out', 'get', 'Vernon', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'only', 'return', 'find', 'Vernon', 'hole', 'head', 'apartment', 'trashed', 'Whoever', 'showed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'came', 'Vernon', 'stash', 'drug', 'Eddie', 'out', 'where', 'regular', 'user.He', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'languages', 'less', 'day', 'back', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'life', 'limited', 'supply', 'pills', 'financing', 'work', 'broker', 'introduced', 'one', 'top', 'moneymen', 'country', 'Carl', 'Van', 'Loon', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'job', 'Van', 'Loon', 'chance', 'turn', 'what', 'learned', 'millions', 'not', 'billions', 'company', 'also', 'access', 'possibly', 'having', 'someone', 'make', 'more', 'drug.But', 'cost', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'gave', 'money', 'invest', 'originally', 'now', 'taking', 'drug', 'more', 'was', 'killed', 'Vernon', 'trying', 'find', 'as', 'well', 'Eddie', 'risen', 'worst', 'position', 'possible', 'highest', 'yet', 'still', 'problems', 'just', 'different', 'ones', 'ones', 'could', 'cost', 'life.The', 'movie', 'terrific', 'look', 'clean', 'sleek', 'fast', 'When', 'drug', 'kicks', 'look', 'eyes', 'Eddie', 'as', 'well', 'outside', 'seeing', 'things', 'move', 'so', 'much', 'faster', 'mind', 'world', 'be', 'slow', 'motion', 'Eddie', 'brain', 'increases', 'capability', ""n't"", 'seek', 'do', 'harm', 'anyone', 'rather', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'take', 'care', 'matter', 'say', 'best', 'intentions', 'Cooper', 'great', 'job', 'shifting', 'acting', 'modes', 'as', 'well', 'appearances', 'down', 'Eddie', 'more', 'successful', 'one', 'performance', 'well', 'completely', 'believable', 'Cornish', 'feels', 'just', 'there', 'DeNiro', 'most', 'what', 'essentially', 'supporting', 'role.For', 'great', 'story', 'found', 'here', 'just', 'off', 'decent', 'flick', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'expectations', 'not', 'being', 'met', 'just', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'long', 'line', 'films', 'are', 'entertaining', 'not', 'memorable', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'many', 'being', 'made', 'longer.Most', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'ending', 'was', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'movie', 'rent', 'week', 'then', 'means', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'may', 'not', 'stick', 'mind', 'forever', 'will', 'give', 'pleasant', 'night', 'watching', 'movie']",Limitless

1436823,A4UM5DS14TSCO,B0051MKMNC,Matthew Warner,"[4, 12]","== Spoilers ahead ==Limitless made for a fun, Friday-night romp, but ten minutes after leaving the movie theater, I realized its plot relied on idiotic coincidences and presented a disturbing, pro-drug message.  It's too bad, really, that the writing was so questionable, because the acting and cinematography were quite strong.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling, non-household-name writer who nevertheless has been paid an advance on a book he hasn't written yet.  (Okaaay, but we'll let that one go for the moment.)  Just when he's about to drain down the toilet of despair, an old friend introduces him to NZT, a drug that allows him to utilize his brain's full potential.  You know the old wive's tale, of course: we mortals are cursed to only use a small fraction of our brain cells because the rest of it is preoccupied with things like pornography.  But NZT, the wonder drug, allows Eddie to fire up his full 100 percent.  Suddenly, he can place his order with a waiter in a foreign language; and gee, we've never ever seen that in a movie before.  He finishes his novel in four days -- four days! -- as computer-generated letters and numbers rain down upon him and his word processor to show us the miracle of this manna-from-heaven intelligence.Soon, he makes a killing on the stock market and meets the financial world's godfather, played by Robert De Niro, whose name, Carl Van Loon, is surely coincidental to the character's being a loon.  Eddie's ex-girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), falls in love with this new persona and rewards him with sex.Eddie also makes a killing in the form of a Courtney Love lookalike whom he murders during a drug-induced blackout.  So he uses his money to hire a high-rolling defense lawyer who -- coincidentally! -- works for Carl Van Loon's arch-nemesis, who employs a psycho henchman who -- coincidentally! -- has been following Eddie around all this time.More hijinks ensue.  The cameraman goes crazy with a continuous-zoom effect that travels the length of Manhattan island and ends up sprayed all over the seat in front of me.  Eddie beats his murder rap, the Loon is outsmarted, Eddie is on the road to the presidency, and he flawlessly orders another meal in a foreign language he doesn't know.And did I mention that the movie starts at the very climax of the story until Eddie jumps in as a voiceover to say that he'll now show us how he arrived at this point?What's most disturbing about this movie is that it validates the drug culture.  It shows, again and again, that we're not smart enough or athletic enough to solve our problems without pills.  Eddie is rewarded, repeatedly, for his habit: he becomes rich, he gets the girl back, he gets away with murder, and he's set onto the road of ""limitless"" fame and fortune.Oh, he says he's off the drug by the end of the movie -- he doesn't need it anymore -- presumably because he just thought his way out of it with his advanced intelligence.  After all, that's what Charlie Sheen teaches us, isn't it, that you can just blink your eyes and tap your ruby slippers to cure yourself of substance abuse.  Even if you believe that's possible -- and I hope by my tone you realize I don't -- Eddie's drug-free status at the end of the movie doesn't justify how he arrived there, which was by traveling the road of pharmaceutical assistance.Limitless is a slick-looking movie.  It's mostly fun to watch.  But it's kind of like a big candy bar -- maybe one laced with LSD.  The side effects and the bad aftertaste aren't worth it.",1,`Limitless' a Soulless Pro-Drug Thriller,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,3537,"['==', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', '==Limitless', 'made', 'fun', 'Friday-night', 'romp', 'ten', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'movie', 'theater', 'realized', 'plot', 'relied', 'idiotic', 'coincidences', 'presented', 'disturbing', 'pro-drug', 'message', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'writing', 'was', 'so', 'questionable', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'were', 'quite', 'strong.Eddie', 'Morra', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'struggling', 'non-household-name', 'writer', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'been', 'paid', 'advance', 'book', ""n't"", 'written', 'yet', 'Okaaay', ""'ll"", 'let', 'one', 'go', 'moment', 'Just', 'when', 'drain', 'down', 'toilet', 'despair', 'old', 'friend', 'NZT', 'drug', 'utilize', 'brain', 'full', 'potential', 'know', 'old', 'wive', 'tale', 'course', 'mortals', 'are', 'cursed', 'only', 'use', 'small', 'fraction', 'brain', 'cells', 'rest', 'preoccupied', 'things', 'pornography', 'NZT', 'wonder', 'drug', 'Eddie', 'fire', 'up', 'full', '100', 'percent', 'Suddenly', 'can', 'place', 'order', 'waiter', 'foreign', 'language', 'gee', ""'ve"", 'never', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'before', 'novel', 'four', 'days', 'four', 'days', 'computer-generated', 'letters', 'numbers', 'rain', 'down', 'word', 'processor', 'show', 'miracle', 'manna-from-heaven', 'intelligence.Soon', 'killing', 'stock', 'market', 'financial', 'world', 'godfather', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'name', 'Carl', 'Van', 'Loon', 'surely', 'coincidental', 'character', 'being', 'loon', 'Eddie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lindy', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'love', 'new', 'persona', 'rewards', 'sex.Eddie', 'also', 'killing', 'form', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'lookalike', 'whom', 'drug-induced', 'blackout', 'money', 'hire', 'high-rolling', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'Carl', 'Van', 'Loon', 'arch-nemesis', 'who', 'psycho', 'henchman', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'been', 'following', 'Eddie', 'time.More', 'ensue', 'cameraman', 'crazy', 'continuous-zoom', 'effect', 'length', 'Manhattan', 'island', 'up', 'sprayed', 'seat', 'front', 'Eddie', 'murder', 'rap', 'Loon', 'outsmarted', 'Eddie', 'road', 'presidency', 'flawlessly', 'orders', 'meal', 'foreign', 'language', ""n't"", 'know.And', 'did', 'mention', 'movie', 'very', 'climax', 'story', 'Eddie', 'jumps', 'voiceover', 'say', ""'ll"", 'now', 'show', 'how', 'arrived', 'point', 'What', 'most', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'drug', 'culture', 'again', 'again', ""'re"", 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'athletic', 'enough', 'solve', 'problems', 'pills', 'Eddie', 'rewarded', 'repeatedly', 'habit', 'rich', 'girl', 'back', 'away', 'murder', 'set', 'road', 'limitless', 'fame', 'fortune.Oh', 'drug', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'presumably', 'just', 'thought', 'way', 'advanced', 'intelligence', 'what', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', ""n't"", 'can', 'just', 'blink', 'eyes', 'tap', 'ruby', 'slippers', 'cure', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Even', 'believe', 'possible', 'hope', 'tone', 'realize', 'do', ""n't"", 'Eddie', 'drug-free', 'status', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'justify', 'how', 'arrived', 'there', 'was', 'traveling', 'road', 'pharmaceutical', 'assistance.Limitless', 'slick-looking', 'movie', 'mostly', 'fun', 'watch', 'kind', 'big', 'candy', 'bar', 'maybe', 'one', 'laced', 'LSD', 'side', 'effects', 'bad', 'aftertaste', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth']",Limitless
1436824,A244Z9GPMIFOGK,B0051MKMNC,McGill,"[2, 3]","Last movie I watched was ""Limitless,"" that one where Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" et al.) takes a little pill and becomes unspeakably brilliant. I'd give this movie (in Amazon terms) 4 out of 5 stars.As for the premise, it's not as insane (or cliched, even, I think) as you might guess. I thought that what would happen would be the typical ""Scarface""-ish, poor-hero-starts-from-bottom-makes-it-to-the-once-unimaginable-top-now-comes-crashing-down sort of plot, but really it seems that, despite what I'd say is the impossibility of this ever happening, realism sort of kicks in as soon as the protagonist in this movie gets into action. What I mean is, he starts having to deal with the consequences of his actions as soon as he gets rolling. He finds out pretty quickly that he's gotten involved with some pretty bad people. For example, the man he got the brain-and-senses-enhancing drug from is murdered a relatively short bit into the movie. The pill is dangerous on several grounds; not only does it become apparent that some other people want the drug and are willing to kill those that stand in their way in order to get it, the drug itself has some negative effects on its users. It's basically like heroin: you become very addicted to it very quickly; actually, the biological penalty for not getting more of the drug is death.What also surprised me is that Cooper's character, for the meat of the movie, never really makes it to the top. He seemingly has the ability to do so, but he has to start off working for other people that have more money than himself. Cue Robert De Niro (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Meet the Parents"" and, like, everything else), who of course in his later years makes for a pretty intimidating presence, that is, in the protagonist's life. I.e. De Niro's given such a short amount of time on the screen that all in all I felt his inclusion was wasted. He's actually more dangerous-seeming in ""Meet the Parents"" than he is in this movie. I'm not unhappy that he was in the movie though; I just hope he doesn't become one of those actors who are given these short little bits in movies to provide the film with a little more class and seriousness. (Like Marlon Brando in his later years; it's just sort of the sad evidence that these really powerful stars are beginning to fade.)The movie took some turns I wasn't expecting, like, for one, the foreign gangster who intimidates the main character into giving him some of the drug, which in turn makes him really powerful and dangerous for a time too. Didn't think his role was going to become that important, but it does. Um, what else. Oh, yes: Hollywood's gotten into this habit of starting the movie in medias res where the hero's on the verge of doing something drastic, at which point it goes back to show you how it all started. This is one of those movies, but for some reason the viewer knows it's not going to end as...ah, flatly...as it initially seems. One last point: all in all some pretty cool and perhaps mild seizure-inducing visuals in this film.I really don't want to tell you this, but really the only way this movie disappointed me was the ending. It was one of those ""We can't really get out of this any other way, so let's just do this because it's safe"" endings.

There are plenty of reviews that have already taken care of that. I will mention my thoughts on the premise though.This movie had already been out from quite awhile before I saw it. I hadn't seen a trailer or even knew what it was about. Perhaps that is why I enjoyed it, I had no preconceived expectations. I rarely enjoy Hollywood movies anymore. I watch mainly foreign an independent films. The reason for this, those films have a higher satisfaction rate of getting what you expect. Not over-hyped movies featuring overpaid actors where everything good to see in the movie is pieced together into a 30 second trailer!Bradly Cooper does in outstanding job in this ""what if"" film. What if I could be a success? What if it were possible to have my dreams come true? What if I became a different person ... good or bad? Most of us has experienced these what if or if only moments. If we had a magic pill that helped us achieve our dreams, would we take it? If we did, would it change our personality or affect our moral decisions? Bradly Coopers character gets to ask those questions and receive the answers. Will he like the answers he gets? Will he fly like Icarus or spiral out of control? Where will this sudden realization take him? Will he stay on that road or take another one? Will it change him for better or for worse? What happens when other people want what you have?This movie highlights what are each of us may be capable of under the right circumstances. How the choices we make and continue to make shapes our lives.If you found my review helpful, please vote.

I mean, how can you not be, the body, the eyes, the hair, the quirky sideways smile, love it!The movie starts off with Bradley standing on a roof about to take his life and someone banging at his door. How did  he get there? The movie takes a huge ""mother may I"" step backward and we find out. Bradley, or Eddie in this movie is a divorced ""after two seconds"" sad sack writer who can't even get people to believe he has a book contract because he is so pathetic.How do you make sexy Bradley Cooper look like he is pathetic? Well, give him crazy, lackluster, long hair and don't let him smile because it will crinkle and brighten his sexy blue eyes. Eddie is a slob who can't pay his rent, or come up with a sentence for his book until he runs into his ex-junkie-brother-in-law. His brother-in-law gives him a designer pill and tells him that all will be clear once he takes it. Like Alice in Wonderland he takes the pill and suddenly, Eddie has the gift of gab!  The drug kicks in as he is being screamed at by his landlords wife/girlfriend (I don't remember, she was unimportant) and suddenly he is in her apartment, helping her write and having sex with her. He can recall things he doesn't even remember, everything he ever read, things that he only saw but didn't even realize it had imprinted on his brain. He learns to play the piano in 3 days. He can speak any language. He suddenly knows everything about everything.He heads back to his brother-in-laws for more drugs. The BIL tells him he knew he would be back and that he needs to get his cleaning and some lunch for him and he will give him the drug. When he gets back his BIL is sitting on the couch after being shot in the head and the apartment is trashed. He calls 911, searches for the drugs and has a lot of explaining to do.The drugs change Eddie's life. He is back with his ex girlfriend, he is successful, has tons of cash and everyone is interested in him. Sounds great but his new fans are good and bad people. Eddie's stalkers want the drug and want him dead.Great movie for fans of dramatic thrillers or Bradley Cooper fans.

Imagine if the more you took the drug, the better you became.  You're still you, you're achieving your your full potential, not the slacker we all secretly fear we are. That's the plot of Limitless.Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer some potential, enough potential to get a book advance, but not enough to actually write it.  Wallowing in self-doubt after his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) breaks up with him, he bumps into the brother of his ex-wfe. Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth) slips Eddie an $800 gift in the form of a little translucent pill, NZT-48. Bored and frustrated with his life, Eddie turns to the drug and bangs out 40 amazing pages of his new book in three days.Things go south when Vernon ends up dead, leaving behind his stash of the illegal NZT. It's a drug addict's dream: an endless supply with no side-effects. Or is there?It turns out everyone is secretly using NZT and prolonged use kills people. With enough drugs to keep him clear for a long time, Eddie focuses his brilliant intellect on trying to figure out how to beat the drug's side-effects.  Along the way he will try to win his ex back, get an amazing job with a ruthless executive (Robert DeNiro as Carl Van Loon), and fight off the criminal underworld (Andrew Howard as Russian thug Gennady) who wants a piece of the action.Limitless is like a sci-fi version of Trainspotting - it glamorizes, then demonizes, then glamorizes drug use with a futuristic sheen that makes it palatable to modern audiences. The movie's ending stays true to the title...or does it?See, Limitless is a drug addict's tale told by a drug addict, a narrator reminiscent of Fight Club.  You can't trust a single thing he says, even as he confides in how he conned everyone else - except for you.  Of course.  But there is a price, and for those who pay attention, it's clear that NZT does extract a price: your soul.

The film features a great performance from Bradley Cooper with some help from resident acting guru Robert DeNiro.

Alas, this performance comes with a price.  The drug is not strictly legal, and he is not the only one who wants it.It's a good hook, and broadly speaking the movie does a decent job of wringing a thriller out of it, and on the way makes some commentary on addiction - whether it is to drugs or to power or to consumerism - though unfortunately loses a lot of the bite as it progresses to an increasingly predictable thriller denouement.  Effects and editing are cleverly (if rather flashily) used to emphasise the heightened awareness, creating an oddly hallucinogenic mood as he transitions from down and out to super perceptive charmer and wheeler dealer.  In a supporting role Abbie Cornish does fine, and Robert de Niro shows up and says his lines in a throwaway role which seems almost perfunctorily added on.  Presumably he does just enough to get on the front cover to help sales, but it helps neither his career, or the film.It's pretty exciting and relatively action packed, but with not too much violence.  All in all, any looming ridiculousness is staved off by a pace which doesn't allow you to think too much.  A shame perhaps, as with braver hands this might have been more of an interesting commentary rather than a thriller.. but it still works.  The directors name is Neil Burger.. perhaps if you consider the movie as cinematic fast food, it's a success.

This premise of course, exploits the common misconception that humans normally use only a small fraction of their brains. But in reality, the only people who normally use a small fraction of their brains are people with severe brain damage or those in persistent vegetative states and also Hollywood execs that green-light garbage like this. There should be some expectations, of course, for an audience to suspend their usual healthy dose of skepticism known commonly as the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" But audiences shouldn't be expected to become complete cretins just to enjoy a movie as seems to be the expectations of the film makers for this movie. The film leaves several logical loose ends. One keeps asking oneself why if the drug may be taken without many serious side effects as the film's ending hints at isn't everyone on the drug? for example.Unfortunately, this movie did not make for a very interesting cinematic experience. It could have been interesting if it focused on the ethical issues associated with such a drug for example but it took the low route and tried to make a conventional action thriller but containing little entertaining action and thrills.

1436860,A2GVM7RNS6ANZJ,B0051MKMNC,Paul Durgala,"[1, 1]","This film deals with a subject that hasn't often been addressed in films.  What if there was a drug that could enhance your intelligence and give you superior ability?  Would it be worthwhile to take it?  What would be the consequences to your livelihood, your relationships, your personality, your character?All of these issues are explored by the film and in a very realistic way.  The character development, in Eddie's case, is excellent.  Bradley Cooper(Eddie) does an outstanding job of going from a frumpy, down-and-out, aspiriring writer to a slick and competent human being. Then the crash he experiences when he goes through withdrawal from the drug is quite realistic.  I would also say that the script is excellent. I like the way it explores some of the more personal aspects of psychoactive drug use, like ""Am I really ME when I'm on the drug or am I someone else?"". The various scenarios (ie. Eddie and his girlfriend, Eddie and a Russian loan shark, Eddie in a day trading firm, Eddie and the corporate big wigs) all come across quite credibly and smoothly.  You know that this is the way that people act and talk.The film does have some plot holes, like1)  The police certainly would have searched Eddie's person and found the money and the stash of pills when they came tothe apartment.  That probably would have ended the story right there.2)  It's doubtful that someone would have framed Eddie for murder just so that they could get the pills.  Why would they thinkthat it would work?3)  It's not likely that a person as smart as Eddie would not have paid back the loan shark, knowing that his life dependedon it.4)  Why would Eddie even bother going to a loan shark at all?  With his enhanced abilities he could have made millions without that kind of help.These are just a few holes in the story but I'm sure there are others.What concerns me more is how the medication affected Eddie.  I'm concerned that he wasn't more upset about the murdered woman and the role (even unknowingly) he might have played in it.  I'm concerned that he didn't have more compassion for Hank Atwood and didn't try to save his life.  I'm concerned that while vacationing in the Carribean, he comes up with a ""vision"" for his life, but his ""vision"" basically involves making millions in day trading.  I'm wondering if this is actually part the cautionary tale and that one of the effects of enhanced ability is a lack of concern for others and for the betterment of society.  Does enhanced ability just turn a self-absorbed person into a more successful and adaptable self-absorbed person?  What are the consequences of that?  Maybe that gives some credence to him not paying the loan shark.  Perhaps he was so intoxicated with himself and his new abilities that he neglected to pay.What makes this subject interesting is that a certain class of this type of drug already exists.  They're called amphetamines.  Back in the early twentieth century when amphetamines were first introduced they were considered the wonder drugs of the century.  People who struggled with fatigue, depression, timidity and poor self image took these drugs and experienced an immediate turn-a-round.  They became more productive and successful at work.  They were able to work longer hours without fatigue.  They became more socially engaging and self-assured.  Their family lives became more stable.  But there was a price.  We eventually discovered that these drugs were highly addictive and that users had to keep upping the dose to get the desired effect.  We also discovered that if too much were taken it could cause psychosis.  The wonder drugs turned out to be not so wonderful.I suspect this is the case with most if not all performance enhancing drugs.  Sooner or later, there's going to be a reckoning to pay.  That's why I really didn't like the ending of the film.  Eddie's lab perfects the pill to such a degree that he doesn't have to take it any more.  The enhancing effects of the drug are now permanent and his life is now happy ever after.  Oh please!  Wouldn't it be better to have him come down off the meds and learn to cope with his natural imperfections?  I don't know.  I don't know what the ending should be, but I don't think it should be ""NZT solved all of my problems"".Unless, of course, there's going to be a Limitless 2.

'Limitless' is one of those movies that you can show to anyone and know they will be hooked from beginning to end. This movie has all the fun stuff in it, suspense, action, romance told at a brisk pace, but also lots of life and business lessons; Our hero Eddie gets access to 100% of his brain by using a smart pill called NTZ. He tells us via narration,&#34;Everything I'd ever read, seen and heard was now organized and available.&#34; After hooking up with higher caliber friends (his useless relationships are &#34;better forgotten and put away in mothballs,&#34; he says) and going to  Puerto Valletta, Eddie says,&#34;Mere lounging wasn't enough. Suddenly I knew what I needed to do. But it would take money to get there.&#34;In the beginning of the film, when Eddie is standing on the ledge of the building ready to jump, he talks about &#34;Wanting to make an impact on the world, instead of the pavement.&#34; When explaining his book in the bar, Eddie mentions a 'utopian society.'  So we can guess that his final goal might be helping the world. When Eddie is accused of having 'delusions of grandeur' he retorts with, &#34;I have an actual recipe for grandeur.&#34; Ah, a plan. Definite plans get definite results. Indefinite plans do not get 'indefinite results', they get NO results. Eddie says, &#34;I was clear. I knew what I needed to do, and how to do it.&#34;Eddie says, &#34;There are moments in your life when you cross a bridge and know that your old life is over.&#34; And while a high level of success is necessary to express our true selves, Eddie cautions us with, &#34;We are all wired to over reach. Look at history, all the countries that ruled the world. No one stopped and said, 'We've got France, Poland, a big Swiss bank account. Let's not invade Russia in the winter. Let's go home, pop a beer and live on the interest.'&#34; Yes, better not fulfill the Peter Principle and rise to our level of our incompetence.DeNiro makes a good point about earning your power by experience. He tells Eddie: &#34;Your super intellect is a gift from God, but you didn't earn it because you're careless with your power, flashing it around like a trust fund child. You never had to earn it year by year. You don't know how to assess your competition because you never had to compete.&#34;Finally, Eddie's success in now internalized and natural. When he speaks to a waiter in Chinese, his girlfriend looks at him in awe. Eddie turns to her, sees her expression and says, &#34;What?&#34;Leaving the theater after seeing 'Limitless' I heard some guy say, &#34;I wish I had the pill.&#34; But all that Eddie does in this movie can be accomplished without the pill.

1436877,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0051MKMNC,RMurray847,"[2, 6]","Sometimes movies have concepts so grand and large-scale that potential viewers can't help but imagine to themselves in advance what they would do with such technology, powers, knowledge, etc.  Imagine if you had the ability to travel through time.  What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access ""100% of his brain.""  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...""wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.""  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable ""corporate espionage"" kind of thing.Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The ""action"" shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.",3,3.5 stars for a film that does not deliver on the promise of its concept,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,3435,"['Sometimes', 'movies', 'have', 'concepts', 'so', 'grand', 'large-scale', 'potential', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'advance', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'such', 'technology', 'powers', 'knowledge', 'etc', 'Imagine', 'had', 'ability', 'travel', 'time', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'When', 'would', 'go', 'imaginations', 'are', 'sparked', 'thus', 'movies', 'time', 'travel', 'are', 'often', 'disappointing', 'reach', 'never', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'doing.LIMITLESS', 'suffers', 'as', 'well', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'author', 'serious', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'smart', 'messy', 'disorganized', 'handsome', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'take', 'care', 'appearance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'going', 'book', 'supposed', 'write', 'girlfriend', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'finally', 'tired', 'leaves', 'hope', 'arrives', 'form', 'new', 'drug', 'given', 'distant', 'acquaintance', 'will', 'allow', 'access', '100', '%', 'brain', 'Suddenly', 'got', 'phenomenal', 'cognitive', 'abilities', 'particularly', 'ability', 'take', 'random', 'scraps', 'past', 'things', 'encountered', 'put', 'together', 'patterns', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'recognize', 'chess', 'player', 'who', 'can', 'envision', 'possible', 'move', 'outcomes', 'moves', 'Cooper', 'book', 'brilliant', 'then', 'sets', 'making', 'serious', 'money', 'new', 'powers.With', 'such', 'incredible', 'powers', 'strive', 'accomplish', 'relatively', 'little', 'Yes', 'make', 'money', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'relatable', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'pattern', 'viewer', 'was', 'constantly', 'distracted', 'thinking', 'wow', 'had', 'HIS', 'abilities', ""'d"", 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'felt', 'little', 'bit', 'failure', 'imagination', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'Thus', 'felt', 'vaguely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'great', 'idea', 'boiled', 'down', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'kind', 'thing.Because', 'Cooper', 'drug', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'developed', 'approval', 'FDA', 'side-effects', 'particularly', 'not', 'taking', 'drug', 'day', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'even', 'murderous', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'drug', 'least', 'want', 'abilities', 'Cooper', 'now', 'work', 'advantage', 'Who', 'can', 'trust', 'How', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'following', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'stock', 'pills', 'out', 'interesting', 'bit', 'generic', 'Cooper', 'pretty', 'good', 'leading', 'man', 'here', 'little', 'chemistry', 'bland', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'invested', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'hand', 'collect', 'paycheck', 'big', 'shot', 'executive', 'trying', 'pull', 'most', 'ambitious', 'corporate', 'merger', 'history', 'talent', 'Cooper', 'table.The', 'most', 'amusing', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Cooper', 'borrow', 'initial', 'stake', 'stock', 'market', 'Russian', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'pill', 'Cooper', 'taking', 'Suddenly', 'thuggish', 'character', 'LOT', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Cooper', 'corporate', 'big-shots', 'showed', 'creativity', 'menace', 'humor', 'scenes', 'was', 'welcome.I', 'recommend', 'LIMITLESS', 'admiration', 'not', 'well', 'limitless', 'Cooper', 'good', 'basic', 'concept', 'intriguing', 'action', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'fairly', 'tense', 'feel', 'lifted', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'came', 'realize', 'lazy', 'thing', 'say', ""'d"", 'say', 'wait', 'out', 'DVD']",Limitless

Nothing better than a dealer who's high....Be high, convince Eddie to try! And Eddie Morra does indeed try.Turns out this highly addictive new favorite is an experimental drug that Eddie's old friend has somehow gotten his hands on and there are some rough and tough people that also want their hands on it. So when Eddie winds up with a significant stash of this new favorite these rough and tough people now want to get their hands on Eddie. But Eddie has an advantage over his foes you see...the new favorite unlocks the full (superhuman?) potential of the brain, which according to the movie humans only use 20% of. Ah...well that explains why I spend so much time writing reviews for no pay!Limitless was a pretty fast paced entertaining movie. Limited special effects are very good, and there are some very cool camera special effects at the start of the film (that actually get a little monotonous by the end of the film). While the pills that Eddie was taking were easy to swallow, a lot of the plot line was not. I mean for starters, this would be a pretty breakthrough, highly secret and tightly secured and scrutinized discovery. So let's say even if someone very high up in the pharma company manufacturing the drug was interested in the intentional or inadvertent leak to the public of the drug in such large quantities, it would not be as easy as Limitless makes it seem like it is. But if you don't think too much about this and some other plot line flaws and inconsistencies, you have pretty good movie here.So the movie all in all is a pretty fun ride and we see Eddie become an addict of perhaps the most irresistible narcotic to ever be discovered. If you don't think that you would ever get addicted to this drug, you can't understand a user's mind. You could try with your books and degrees, but if you let yourself go and open your mind I'll bet you'd be doing like Eddie.

1436899,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B0051MKMNC,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[4, 5]","""Limitless"" is one of those dopey thrillers that comes along every year, where the filmmaker tries to supplant ""smart"" with ""hip"" and ""stylish.""  It's not much of the latter two either, a ""Fight Club"" redux, only this time instead of a split personality focused on violence it's a no personality focused on super intelligence.  Or super memory.  I'm not sure because the story never really shows the character being smart so much as acting like a human version of a computer, accessing and processing ideas at the speed of light without really stopping to reason much out.  Bradley Cooper -- who looks like Matthew McConaughey and Larry Fine had a baby -- lopes along playing a loser named Eddie pretending to be a writer and generally letting his days slide out from under him effortlessly.  His life is a trainwreck until a chance encounter (aren't they all?) with his ex brother in law introduces him to a pill that boosts his mental abilities to the point that he's learning languages in hours and making millions in the stock market.  That attracts a lot of publicity, one of the first signs that he isn't too bright, along with loans from the Russian mob, another sign, that cause his life to spiral out of control.  ""Limitless"" dodges all the meaningful questions of what would happen if someone suddenly discovered his mind worked better than anyone else's, the sort of thing novels like ""Flowers for Algernon"" and its film adaptation tackled 40 years ago. when stories like these were imaginative . . . instead, it lets Eddie act like an out of control frat boy who suddenly discovers sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Robert DeNiro phones in a performance as a corporate raider type.  Worse are the women in the story.  Abbie Cornish, for instance, plays the standard shallow girlfriend who doesn't want anything more to do with Eddie when he is a loser but is immediately charmed when he becomes a winner -- a particularly unbelievable scene happens when Eddie, suffering from withdrawal, staggers into her workplace, to the understandable shock of everyone, and then remains on the floor while she goes to get his pills and is chased by a knife-wielding assassin . . . all while staying on her cell phone with him.  Just another day at the office I suppose.  It's worse later when Eddie has to get his hit of the drug from a disgusting source.  ""Limitless"" plays like a 20-year-old's understanding of the world, which is to say it is about chases and one-ups instead of anything meaningful.  No one expects a thriller nowadays to be particularly mature, but ""Limitless"" is, in fact, limitless in its childishness.",3,Not a Very Thrilling Thriller,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2623,"['Limitless', 'one', 'dopey', 'thrillers', 'along', 'year', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'supplant', 'smart', 'hip', 'stylish', 'not', 'much', 'latter', 'two', 'Fight', 'Club', 'redux', 'only', 'time', 'instead', 'split', 'personality', 'focused', 'violence', 'personality', 'focused', 'super', 'intelligence', 'super', 'memory', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'character', 'being', 'smart', 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'human', 'version', 'computer', 'accessing', 'processing', 'ideas', 'speed', 'light', 'really', 'stopping', 'reason', 'much', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'had', 'baby', 'playing', 'loser', 'named', 'Eddie', 'pretending', 'be', 'writer', 'generally', 'letting', 'days', 'slide', 'effortlessly', 'life', 'trainwreck', 'chance', 'encounter', 'are', ""n't"", 'ex', 'brother', 'law', 'introduces', 'pill', 'mental', 'abilities', 'point', 'learning', 'languages', 'hours', 'making', 'millions', 'stock', 'market', 'lot', 'publicity', 'one', 'first', 'signs', ""n't"", 'too', 'bright', 'loans', 'Russian', 'mob', 'sign', 'cause', 'life', 'spiral', 'control', 'Limitless', 'meaningful', 'questions', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'someone', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'mind', 'worked', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'sort', 'thing', 'novels', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'film', 'adaptation', 'tackled', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'stories', 'were', 'imaginative', 'instead', 'Eddie', 'act', 'control', 'frat', 'boy', 'who', 'suddenly', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'phones', 'performance', 'corporate', 'raider', 'type', 'are', 'women', 'story', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'instance', 'standard', 'shallow', 'girlfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'more', 'do', 'Eddie', 'when', 'loser', 'immediately', 'charmed', 'when', 'winner', 'particularly', 'unbelievable', 'scene', 'when', 'Eddie', 'suffering', 'withdrawal', 'staggers', 'workplace', 'understandable', 'shock', 'everyone', 'then', 'floor', 'get', 'pills', 'chased', 'knife-wielding', 'assassin', 'staying', 'cell', 'phone', 'Just', 'day', 'office', 'suppose', 'worse', 'later', 'when', 'Eddie', 'get', 'hit', 'drug', 'disgusting', 'source', 'Limitless', 'plays', '20-year-old', 'understanding', 'world', 'say', 'chases', 'one-ups', 'instead', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'one', 'thriller', 'be', 'particularly', 'mature', 'Limitless', 'fact', 'limitless', 'childishness']",Limitless

He looks like he sleeps on the streets and his girlfriend is his main source of income while he struggles to write a novel. He lives in a seedy apartment and is more likely to be eating pizza and drinking alcohol than working on his book. His girlfriend (Cornish) finally decides it's time to leave, but Eddie's life is about to change for the better.In a chance meeting with Vernon, the brother of his ex-wife, Eddie is offered a pill. He's suspicious because Vernon was dealing drugs the last time the two met. After thinking about it, Eddie decides that life can't get much worse and takes the pill. Within 30 seconds, he starts to feel different. The color palette changes from dull and muted to bright and clear and represents the change in Eddie.We are told that we use a fraction of our brain on a daily basis. The pill is supposed to enable us to use one hundred percent of our brain. Eddie finds that he can think clearly and work out solutions to difficult problems. He writes a book in four days without pausing to think how the plot should progress and his editor loves the result. We see him learn how to play piano and become fluent in the Italian language.Eddie feels like he suddenly knows everything.It's interesting how a positive mental attitude can change your life. Instead of living like a slob, he cleans his apartment. Then he focuses on ways to use his intelligence to make enough money to permanently change his life. His new confident attitude attracts the girlfriend who dumped him. Eddie's life is starting to look pretty good.After making the news with a series of shrewd investments, Eddie attracts the attention of Carl Van Loon (De Niro). Van Loon is an ambitious businessman who craves money and power. He has no time to waste on losers, but gives Eddie a chance to impress. He reminds me of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street.Eddie's main problem is securing a regular supply of pills. He also has to adapt to their effects and discover a way to moderate his reaction. Like any drug, there are side effects to deal with. I won't reveal anything else, but the plot is more complicated than I have made it sound.The movie is advertised as an action thriller and Rolling Stone describes it as a ""Full-tilt adrenalin rush."" Although there some action scenes, I wouldn't describe it as an adrenalin rush. There are chase scenes, but the focus is on Eddie's fortunes and there's always an element of mystery. I found it enjoyable because I wanted to see what would happen next, but I rarely found myself sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation.The acting is good across the board. Cooper pulls off his role well. He's serious when he has to be and whimsical in the lighter scenes. De Niro doesn't get a great deal of screen time, but his scenes are memorable. Cornish is effective as Eddie's girlfriend.I found Limitless to be an enjoyable way to spend 105 minutes. There are two versions included on the Blu-ray; the theatrical and the unrated extended version. There is only a few seconds difference in running time between the two.Video Quality 4.5/5Limitless looks very good on Blu-ray. Detail is strong throughout, although we see more during scenes where Eddie is feeling the effects of the drug. Contrast and brightness are boosted during such scenes. Although the other scenes appear drab by comparison, there's good detail and no problem with the transfer. Most viewers will be pleased with the look of the movie.Audio Quality 4.5/5The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is more than adequate. The action scenes are limited, but the track delivers when needed. Dialogue is crisp and clear and I didn't detect any problems with the sound. The commentary track uses English: Dolby Digital 2.0.Special Features 2.5/5The additional features all appear in full HD.Audio Commentary with Director Neil Burger.A Man without Limits (4:29)Taking it to the Limit: the Making of Limitless (11:38) - It would have been nice to see a more extensive feature.Alternate Ending (5:14) - I prefer the original ending, but it's nice to see another possibility.Digital copyTheatrical Trailer (2:25)Limitless has a few plot holes, but it works as a piece of entertainment. Cooper does a great job as Eddie and you'll want to see him succeed. It's hard to pin down the genre as it includes mystery, drama, action, sci-fi and comedy, but it's more of a thriller than anything. I didn't see the film in the theater, but I'm glad it found its way into my Blu-ray collection. It won't change your life, but few people will regret seeing it.Overall score 4/5",4,Everything is possible when you open your mind,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,5015,"['Limitless', 'thriller',

1436901,A2QHCXMFJPEIS1,B0051MKMNC,"Steven W. Cooper ""Steve""","[1, 1]","This Fincheresquely-filmed movie starring fellow barrel-maker Bradley is a lot of fun and deals with some very interesting ideas; but in order to preserve the mass-appeal necessary to make back its budget, the implications of these ideas are sometimes given short shrift.For example, how are people's motivations affected by increased brain performance?  Are we to assume that since Bradley was a 'good guy' to begin with he wants to use his 4-digit IQ (good lord) to help humanity as a politician, and that the Russian 'bad guy' only has the acquisition of filthy lucre as his aim after becoming smart?  In other words, that a person's deepest desires remain unaffected by intelligence?  This is too simple and black-and-white; but it's understandable because these kinds of questions are better handled along the arc of a TV series rather than a 2-hour film.  Even so, I'd have preferred to see Bradley's newfound cognitive skills lead him to the selfish core of what had been his writing ambition and turn him into a monstrous cult leader, and for the Russian to have become a philanthropic engineer bent on inventing a process to provide cheap renewable energy.Another more relevant issue, though, is why does big pharma seem to be more interested in turning off our thoughts and feelings than in turning them on?  One interpretation of the film is that turning them on would precipitate lost time, headaches, and eventual death; but really the film doesn't address this question at all.

I am a big sucker for that microcosm/ macrocosm stuff.Edward has writer's block. He has a book contract for some reason, yet hasn't written a word. His girlfriend, who was his meal ticket leaves him. Bummed out he decides to go live on a bunk bed at Dad's place in New Jersey, but then bumps into his ex-brother-in-law, who is a drug dealer. He offers Edward a pill that increases a person's use of their brain. They can recall everything they have seen or read and can correlate it to increase intelligence. The smarter a person is to begin with, the more data they have to work with. Edward is a smart guy to begin with, so he is able to start his book. The downside is that the pill wears off. Not only does one lose the abilities, but they get a little ADD, and throw up like a heroin addict. Too much of the pill causes a Mr. Hyde type of character including blackouts. Edward's supplier is murdered and Edward finds his stash of pills and a wad of cash.Edward uses his ability to make money on Wall Street. He catches the attention of big time corporations as well as the Russian mafia. He quickly finds out people who take the smart pill eventually die from either taking too much or running out.

Agree or disagree but it does seem to be true that most people strive after some thing or another, whether it's gasps of air and life or it's wealth or love or whatever.  How we go about obtaining what we seek, whether we earn it by our own hands and the sweat of our brow or it drops into our laps via being in the right place at the right time seems to us an importance.  Not so much to Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), the protagonist of the film &#34;Limitless&#34;, a failed writer and generally down on his luck bunko who can't seem to get things straight, until a miracle drug that unlocks the potential of his mind to absorb information through his physical faculties and to predict incredibly accurately near-future events.  It is, of course, too good to be true and the effects fade and so we follow what is essentially a junkie looking for his next fix throughout a film that sees him trying to keep ahead of the trouble that he's created in front of him.  There are some snazzy action pieces in this sci-fi lite plot premise but the film is mostly a character study, somewhat cerebral, and goes to lengths to baffle the audience at film's end as to whether or not Morra has conquered (controlled really) his demon in the form of a pill, a hit.  To this end he faces off against partner/ antagonist Carl van Loon (Robert DeNiro) who may be more like Morra than Morra knows.The film could have gone longer into the drug addicted persona of its star but it goes far enough and it offers itself as a thriller more than a sci-fi action movie.  It is definitely a visceral experience at points but the thing that troubles me are the messages of the film (it is a good discussion piece for a movie if you're into that sort of thing): the pursuit of power and potential by artificial means are justified by the ends; the fairy tale element of the addict overcoming (?) their addiction through pharmaceuticals; the mundanity of life made better through drugs.

It leaves me with many questions to ask.1. Why did Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) not pay back the Russian loan-shark? He made millions of dollars super fast (completely legally), and the loan was only $100,000. If the drug made him smarter, why did he forget to do this? More than half of his problems in this film would not have happened had he remembered to do this. But did he really forget? He couldn't have. Maybe he thought he could get away with the money without paying him back? Who knows?2. Why did he not immediately try to ration his limited supply of NZT? Or better yet, why didn't he immediately seek out a scientist to either make more of the drug or find out how to reverse engineer it? He starts deliberately taking more than he should. He should have known the bad effects that would have occurred.3. Why did Eddie allow Carl van Loon (Robert DeNiro) to convince him to continue working for him when Eddie politely told him his plans to go his own way? The only argument van Loon had was ""I know this business and have more experience."" Realistically speaking, this argument is useless considering the superior mental power that Eddie had and the superior rate at which HE was making money compared to van Loon.4. When Lindy took the NZT to escape the trench coat assassin, she immediately knew how to do parkour? She doesn't look like she's in shape to be running and hopping over everything. No drug makes you good at parkour without practice.5. Similar to note number 4, Eddie becomes a master fighter because the NZT helped him remember fighting videos he watched? Anyone who tries to do what they see in martial arts movies without any proper training ends up dead.

The NZT is a narrative device that is too convenient but serviceable enough.

It is regrettable that director Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"") didn't come up with a better way for Cooper's character to use such amazing abilities. What Eddie really wants to do is not always clear, and when it is clear, it is not very interesting.The thriller keeps a good pace.

1436919,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0051MKMNC,Turfseer,"[2, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Limitless' is one of those entertaining thrillers that (despite its ill-conceived ending), will appeal to the majority of ordinary males who have fantasies of becoming the kind of male women seem to automatically gravitate to: the alpha male. Indeed, the film's protagonist, Eddie Morra, the down and out novelist played by Bradley Cooper, represents an exaggerated version of the kind of situation, the average guy finds himself in, on a daily basis.While most guys aren't down to their last buck like Morra, they can certainly can identify with his great dissatisfaction in the inability to achieve success in a career. It's not like Morra is some bum off the street: he's got an agent but has writer's block; the average guy can relate to Morra's inability to reach his potential. The same applies to women: Morra does have a very good-looking girlfriend, Lindy--but because he doesn't reach his potential and ends up projecting a negative image, she has no guilt feelings about dumping him.'Limitless' allows the average male to indulge in the fantasy of becoming an instant alpha male without developing the skills. When Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who gives him the illegal medication, 'NZT', we're ready to break into Act 2 and watch how Eddie is transformed. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Eddie must turn his brow-beating landlady around after she constantly screams at him for not paying his rent. Instead of adopting the motivational social skills of the ordinary schlub, the NZT allows Eddie to tap his full cognitive potential. Not only does he help the landlady with her paper for law school but also ends up bedding her without even trying.A montage with voice-over allows us to see what else Eddie accomplishes 'under the influence', including learning how to play difficult classical music pieces on the piano as well as mastering multiple languages in a matter of a few days. Instead of turning into a mensch, Eddie decides to model himself after Gordon Gekko. He starts as a day trader and begins amassing some money and this is where perhaps the first plot hole appears in the film. If he's such a genius, why does he have to borrow $100,000 from a Russian loan shark? During a voice-over, Eddie claims he needs the money fast but given his talents, couldn't the newly transformed Eddie have made that kind of money in a week or two? His financial success leads Lindy to change her mind about him and she's back in his arms in no time. Eddie also insinuates himself into the business world of business tycoon Carl Van Loon (another average performance by Robert De Niro) and is on the verge of earning millions, advising Van Loon as he's about to complete a merger with Atwood, a business rival. Eddie's transformation now appears complete.Screenwriter Leslie Dixon manages to keep things moving even after Eddie's transformation is finished. Since there is a limited supply of NZT, all the really bad guys are after Eddie including the loan shark and a stalker. What's more there are very bad side effects to this medication. Eddie is shocked to see his ex-wife, who is going downhill from NZT's side effects as well as discovering previous users have either died or are physically debilitated. Eddie also can't recall where he is for 18 hours and later he's implicated in a murder of a woman in a hotel.There's also an exciting scene where the stalker goes after Lindy. She's seemingly cornered in Central Park (of all places) by the Stalker, but Eddie advises her to take one pill of NZT, which allows her to figure out how to stop her pursuer. Her escape is exciting but contains one ugly misstep: she grabs a little girl who's skating on an ice rink, and uses her as a human machete--slashing her pursuer with the blade of the little girl's skate (I wonder why no one chased her and why she wasn't initially charged with child endangerment).The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen. There a few twists and turns in this confrontation, especially when Eddie runs out of his NZT, stabs the loan shark and is forced to drink his blood in order to get NZT back into his system.While a good part of this is somewhat unbelievable, it all adds up to some breezy entertainment. Unfortunately, Leslie Dixon, the film's screenwriter opts for a typical Hollywood ending, which dilutes the film's overall impact. We're asked to accept that Eddie somehow overcomes the addiction to NZT and retains his mental abilities--even though everybody else becomes addicted and goes downhill after being unable resist, after taking one pill. I also wondered why Lindy did not succumb to the effects of NZT and become an addict (I guess since she's one of the 'good ones', she has the willpower to resist).Finally, why should we really root for Eddie? Has he done anything good to help humanity? In the end he's a politician who rejects Van Loon, who wants to control him, even after he becomes president. But Eddie still is sleazy--after all he is a politician (not a brain surgeon!). A better ending would have Eddie sacrificing himself to save Lindy--penitence for his decision to use drugs and suck up to bad guy Van Loon.I enjoyed 'Limitless' up to a point. It's a fast-paced thriller, undone mainly by a cheap ending, that makes little sense.",3,"Exciting and entertaining sci-fi-like thriller, undone by disappointing Hollywood-like ending",1370217600,"06

""Limitless"" doesn't lean heavily on a ""message"" but it's there along with the consequences for the characters in the film for their action.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)) does a terrific job of envisioning Eddie's world both with without the enhancement of the drug NZT-48 creating a thoughtful thriller that avoids being preachy.""Limitless"" looks extremely good in Blu-ray with lighting, textures and colors for Eddie's different stages of mind nicely reproduced--it's a strong representation of what it looked like in theaters.

We also get (in under 15 minutes) a brief discussion of location shooting, stunts and other related information. The alternate ending isn't quite as strong as the one we see in the film (it's a variation on it just not as tight). We also get the theatrical trailer.""Limitless"" is a well made entertaining popcorn thriller that has more substance than the average summer movie and that's to director Neil Burger's and writer Leslie Dixon's credit (as well as the actors).
