This series includes some of the most controversial issues of the American Experience. I did view the entire series and still the three episodes listed remain as a reminder of how easily an event or events can go terribly wrong. Perhaps that is a lesson to be learned from history!hsAnother interesting and informative series that is well presented and narrated. Recommended for those with a sense of curiosity and an interest in US history. There are those who frequently think that they know more than they do, this is a good reminder of what you just might not know!The Lobotomist: To manage what was not completely understood is a grim reminder within the history of medicine. Carried to an extreme by a single man's obsession for curing the mentally ill, Dr. Walter Freeman almost defines the limits between physician and surgeon. Faced with the wretched situation of those committed to facilities for the mentally ill,  one can but wonder how he was affected by those circumstances. Lobotomy was not an unprecedented procedure and was included in medical literature, observed as the result of an accident or in other documents. The ocular technique required little expertise/training and offered a simple approach to the frontal lobe of the brain. This documentary presents multiple facets and it is graphic in the extreme.  Unfortunately, all mental diagnoses cannot be treated with a single procedure. With the advent of thorazine, the necessity for a frontal lobotomy became a nightmare from the past.Exceptionally well presented and narrated with original footage and interviews. A lesson to be learned within the concept of modern medicine.The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer: J. Robert Oppenheimer was beyond a doubt the essence of a genius. His understanding and moral attitude, his concern for the potential of atomic energy came at a great cost. His life was fraught with contradictions and an uncertainty about himself as an individual. He represented the higher moral ethic of the use of atomic/hydrogen energy as a weapon of mass destruction.A most compelling documentary of power and knowledge, a recognition of the ultimate chaos these weapons would cause and a visionary of future events. A fascinating narration combined with interviews and original footage that give meaning to an earlier time and a simple question: What if? Don't miss this episode!My Lai: My Lai is gruesomely accurate. How could this have happened? Any answer has to recognize the psychological effect of killing, being killed and more importantly the devastating horror of seeing one's comrades killed and militated.  Guilt can be collectively assigned or action taken to lessen the impact on individuals. War encourages the best and the worst within humankind. Listen very carefully and learn.There are many lessons to be learned from history . . . recommended for original footage and the profiles that are portrayed!",5,A time to consider historic implications!,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,3053,"['25', 'February', '2014', 'series', 'review', 'was', 'first', 'Periodically', 'view', 'episode', 'documentary', 'second', 'time', 'read', 'review', 'series', 'most', 'controversial', 'issues', 'American', 'Experience', 'did', 'view', 'entire', 'series', 'still', 'three', 'episodes', 'listed', 'remain', 'reminder', 'how', 'easily', 'event', 'events', 'can', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Perhaps', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'history', 'hsAnother', 'interesting', 'informative', 'series', 'well', 'presented', 'narrated', 'Recommended', 'sense', 'curiosity', 'interest', 'US', 'history', 'are', 'who', 'frequently', 'think', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'good', 'reminder', 'what', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'Lobotomist', 'manage', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'understood', 'grim', 'reminder', 'history', 'medicine', 'Carried', 'extreme', 'single', 'man', 'obsession', 'curing', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Freeman', 'almost', 'limits', 'physician', 'surgeon', 'Faced', 'wretched', 'situation', 'committed', 'facilities', 'mentally', 'ill', 'one', 'can', 'wonder', 'how', 'was', 'affected', 'circumstances', 'Lobotomy', 'was', 'not', 'unprecedented', 'procedure', 'was', 'included', 'medical', 'literature', 'observed', 'result', 'accident', 'other', 'documents', 'ocular', 'technique', 'required', 'little', 'expertise/training', 'offered', 'simple', 'approach', 'frontal', 'lobe', 'brain', 'documentary', 'presents', 'multiple', 'facets', 'graphic', 'extreme', 'Unfortunately', 'mental', 'diagnoses', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'treated', 'single', 'procedure', 'advent', 'thorazine', 'necessity', 'frontal', 'lobotomy', 'became', 'nightmare', 'past.Exceptionally', 'well', 'presented', 'narrated', 'original', 'footage', 'interviews', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'concept', 'modern', 'medicine.The', 'Trials', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Oppenheimer', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Oppenheimer', 'was', 'doubt', 'essence', 'genius', 'understanding', 'moral', 'attitude', 'concern', 'potential', 'atomic', 'energy', 'came', 'great', 'cost', 'life', 'was', 'fraught', 'contradictions', 'uncertainty', 'about', 'individual', 'represented', 'higher', 'moral', 'ethic', 'use', 'atomic/hydrogen', 'energy', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction.A', 'most', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'power', 'knowledge', 'recognition', 'ultimate', 'chaos', 'weapons', 'would', 'cause', 'visionary', 'future', 'events', 'fascinating', 'narration', 'combined', 'interviews', 'original', 'footage', 'give', 'meaning', 'earlier', 'time', 'simple', 'question', 'What', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'episode', 'Lai', 'Lai', 'gruesomely', 'accurate', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'answer', 'recognize', 'psychological', 'effect', 'killing', 'being', 'killed', 'more', 'importantly', 'devastating', 'horror', 'seeing', 'one', 'comrades', 'killed', 'militated', 'Guilt', 'can', 'be', 'collectively', 'assigned', 'action', 'taken', 'lessen', 'impact', 'individuals', 'War', 'best', 'worst', 'humankind', 'Listen', 'very', 'carefully', 'learn.There', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'history', 'recommended', 'original', 'footage', 'profiles', 'are', 'portrayed']",American Experience: The Lobotomist

People flocked in droves to have this procedure done.Families,burdened with a loved one who was mentally imbalanced made decisions under a doctor's advice to have the lobotomy done.This documentary explores Walter Freeman,and at times villaifies and at times praises his work.This is how he was viewed by two camps in his lifetime.Was he a sane and rational scientist,or was he a egotistical maniac bent on fame?I first became aware of lobotomy when as an 11 year old I was driven through a Mental Institution near Philadelphia where you could view lobotomy patients caged in yards in full view! This was legal in 1966! I have NEVER forgotten it.The next time lobotomy was presented to me was in the famous filmFrancesstarring Jessica Lange (nominated for an Oscar) concerning the actress Frances Farmer who was forced against her will to be lobotomized.The other famous person that I recalled was Rosemary Kennedy,(yes of THE Kennedy's) who was lobotomized at 23 in order to avoid political scandal that might keep the Kennedy boys from being elected!(Kennedys of MassachusettsIn his 70's, Freeman,discredited and forced not to practice medicine by the very community that once hailed him as saviour,sought atonement or vindication by tracking down his thousands of patients seeking to verify that his work WAS scientifically successful.Crushed by his findings, he died a short while later in 1972.I recently wanted to have lazer surgery performed on my eyes.My physician advised against it with one brief statement: ""There simply has not been enough time to evaluate scientifically if this procedure is a cure or if it will have serious repercussions down the road"".I respected his scientifically conservative opinion and still wear glasses and contacts!!Thank God, also, that therapists are still around instead of lobotomy (although the postscript of this DVD states that lobotomies are still performed in ""most extreme cases""....now who decides that?)Walter Freeman-villain or saint?...Oh did I forget that lobotomy was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize?

1137957,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0012M1KWC,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[15, 18]","American Experience: The Lobotomist tells the not so pretty story of the rise and fall of Dr. Walter Freeman and his surgical lobotomy procedure, a controversial treatment even when it was done in large numbers in an attempt to treat patients with chronic and severe forms of mental illness. This type of surgery took place, for the most part, back in the 1930s, 1940s and even the 1950s when psychiatric hospitals were little more than warehouses for people with mental illness; the best of the best simply had no idea how to treat them besides observation.Enter Walter Freeman. The grandson of a doctor who was famous for the fist successful removal of a brain tumor on a living patient, Dr. Freeman wanted to prove himself a God. This wasn't all too hard at the time since doctors were generally regarded as Gods and almost nobody ever questioned their authority. In Dr. Freeman's time patients simply complied and there was no such thing as ""informed consent."" Freeman wanted solutions for chronic mental illness and he wanted them fast just as he also wanted fame and fortune for his efforts. He read so much that he finally discovered a crude form of lobotomy and after a few years of making this procedure a bit more sophisticated (not that it ever was an answer nor did it turn out to be sophisticated in any true way), lobotomies across the nation were occurring more and more frequently. Eventually thousands of people were having lobotomies and despite the fact that the results weren't really all that positive Dr. Freeman continued his surgery which was sometimes done outside a hospital in a most unprofessional way.Even then, when some of his medical peers strongly disapproved of the procedure, Freeman was able to do lobotomies because at that time doctors simply didn't badmouth a peer in public and they had to admit they themselves lacked any other way to try to help very ill people. The story moves on from here to examine other angles of the story (I don't want to spoil it for you) and we see and learn in detail what eventually happened to Dr. Freeman and his now infamous lobotomy procedure.The movie flows along well and the interviews with relatives, professionals and even one man who was lobotomized at the tender age of 12 really make this program on DVD fascinating. The archival footage is very well presented although some of it will be a bit tough to take for sensitive people.In addition, the DVD comes without extras unless you count the referral to the PBS website for more information on this topic. I would have loved a few extras; but the film is so well done with its interviews that I can overlook this disappointment.This film tells quite a story and I highly recommend it for students of psychology.

This PBS documentary is mesmerizing in its telling of not only the treatment of mental illness but the famed treator.  Dr. Walter Freeman, at the time considered a pioneer and innovator in the treatment of mental illness, is believed to have been a man who truly wanted to help patients of this disease during a time when America's asylums could only house them in deplorable conditions with no hope for cure or release.I really enjoyed how this documentary gave the history and circumstances that culminated in Dr. Freeman's decade of free reign to practice Prefrontal Orbital Lobotomy on mental patients with the blessings of the medical profession. His lobotomy procedure was hailed so convincingly as a cure-all by reputable medical organizations (Johns Hopkins) and print media that Joseph Kennedy, the millionaire father of future president John F. Kennedy, asked for and authorized Dr. Freeman to perform his groundbreaking procedure on daughter Rosemary Kennedy.  Rosemary would never be the same.You have to see this documentary to feel in your bones the chilling effects of the instruments and procedure Dr. Freeman used.  A tool that looked like an icepick was inserted right above the eyeball under the eyelid near the upper nasal area.  A small mallet was used to strike the icepick forcing it through bone and wedging it into the frontal lobe of the brain.  The good doctor then moved the device left to right and up and down scrambling the membrane known as the Thalamus.  Mind you Dr. Freeman came up with this procedure as a cost-effective alternative to his drilling holes in patient's skulls and scooping at the Thalamus.  The procedure could be done in four minutes flat.And take a guess at what pharmaceutical drug helped end the reign of Dr. Freeman's brain scrambling procedure?  Thorazine.  Thorazine was initially marketed as the ""chemical lobotomy.""Dr. Freeman's commitment to his beliefs as well as his drive for historical fame most likely blinded him to the reality of lobotomy as a failure.  As for the American Medical profession, who at first backed then abandoned their support of Dr. Freeman, we as sufferers of all illnesses in America should be forewarned.  When hearing of new groundbreaking medical procedures and medicines today we should stop, get the facts and then question those pushing the newly discovered breakthrough on us. It just may be a faster, cheaper way to treat the poor or those without healthcare.  But the real question is does it work?
