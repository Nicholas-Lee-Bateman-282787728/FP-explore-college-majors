A few minutes into it, I realized that I had seen the clips before on youtube, and I really wasn't that interested in it then. But, hey, I paid a couple bucks, I'm gonna watch this thing. It wasn't terrible. Is it real? Probably not. A lot of folks thought the Blair Witch Project was real. They went and watched it, enjoyed it, found out it wasn't real, and threw a fit. The fact that they got duped shouldn't factor in as to whether or not it was an enjoyable film to watch. Regardless of whether or not the validity of this video can be ascertained, it was entertaining to watch.

I've seen in other doc's proving with evidence that ghosts/spirits/demons are real and do live on this earth.  Its the seeing with one's own eyes that makes it hard to disbelieve in their manifestation and presence here on earth.  Make no mistake, they, like GOD, is real.  I say this because there is balance in nature.  If there is evil then there must be good to balance it.  This is not to say that all ghosts/spirits are evil but again, make no mistake, demons especially, are real and we should be aware of this fact so as not to be influenced by their presence in our lives.  They do endeavor to influence our behavior and lives.  I only bring this up to show that films like this one, brings their existence to light and thus making us aware that they are indeed real and have an agenda that is not of benefit to our souls and being.Just my thoughts on this film and its subject matter.GOD bless.D.A.

1660253,A391AS877NJKUB,B00DP6OTEE,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[0, 0]","Horror movies almost always disappoint me, but a few years ago I discovered some genuinely creepy shorts on YouTube that briefly satisfied my supernatural horror cravings.  The pantry ghost films were my favorites, hands down, so this mockumentary piqued my interest, but it was ultimately disappointing and, frankly, a waste of money.The concept is interesting.  In a documentary style, the videos are contextualized by a story arc that runs from the ghost's serendipitous discovery to a lackluster conclusion.  What I had hoped for was some unseen footage of the ghost, or at least some higher quality video, but neither is included.  Instead, we get repetitive, boring and poorly acted documentary scenes that fill the space between each video, but do little  else.  Even at a very short 40 minutes, the movie lagged.There are two major annoyances.  First, the video's creator has his identity concealed by blurring his image and modulating his voice - this, despite the fact that you can hear his voice in the YouTube videos!  Second, there's a message at the beginning of the movie recommending that you start the film at 11:55.  I suppose the reason for it is so the movie ends at about the same time the pantry ghost would open her door, but this assumes you don't pause the film and that you pay attention to the time.The movie's only real strengths are the original YouTube videos, but you can already watch all of those for free online.  I hope the videos' creator comes out with an original movie, because he seems to have a good sense of atmosphere and creep.
