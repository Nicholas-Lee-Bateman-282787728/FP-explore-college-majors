I remember watching this movie when I was young, maybe like 9 or 10.  I know I've seen it at least a dozen times.  It's one that a younger person would have to see a couple of times to get the gist of it.  But after you get the idea, it's still pretty entertaining.  I would recommend it for  children age 8 &amp; up.  You may have to explain things, but as far as adult content, there's virtually none that I can think of, maybe a swear word here and there, but I don't think it would be anything a kid these days hasn't heard.  Seems like it would be scary, but it's not, once they find out what the &quot;monster&quot; is.",4,too bad this isn't on dvd...,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,772,"['mentioned', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'condsidered', 'classic', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'think', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'only', 'quot', 'big', 'quot', 'name', 'remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'maybe', '9', '10', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'one', 'younger', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'couple', 'times', 'get', 'gist', 'get', 'idea', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'would', 'recommend', 'children', 'age', '8', 'amp', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'explain', 'things', 'as', 'far', 'adult', 'content', 'virtually', 'none', 'can', 'think', 'maybe', 'swear', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'kid', 'days', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Seems', 'would', 'be', 'scary', 'not', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'quot', 'monster', 'quot']",N/A

552078,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00004U9Q3,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 9]","Henry Thomas (Elliot in E.T.) stars in this film about an orphan, Cody, being raised in Australia by a friend of his parents. Cody is a very resourceful, imaginative, and creative lad who is constantly building things and doing daredevil stunts. One day while on a picinic, he and some friends discover a mysterious pond and the body of an old man that appears to have died from fright. Tales of Aborigine black magic and sea monsters lead Cody on a quest to find the truth.This film is not your typical movie. It moves rather slow and often lacks energy from many of the non-American actors and the effects are quite cheesy. However, Thomas and the other young actors in the cast are completely believable and add some emotional depth to the story. The scenery is breathtaking (it is Australia after all) and there are some rather interesting scenes (the opening shot is a classic in how to build suspense). Overall, a film that most American audiences will find rather boring, but has it's moments if your looking.",3,Not Your Typical Film.,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1016,"['Henry', 'Thomas', 'Elliot', 'E.T', 'film', 'orphan', 'Cody', 'being', 'raised', 'Australia', 'friend', 'parents', 'Cody', 'very', 'resourceful', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'lad', 'who', 'constantly', 'building', 'things', 'doing', 'daredevil', 'stunts', 'One', 'day', 'picinic', 'friends', 'discover', 'mysterious', 'pond', 'body', 'old', 'man', 'have', 'died', 'fright', 'Tales', 'Aborigine', 'black', 'magic', 'sea', 'monsters', 'lead', 'Cody', 'quest', 'find', 'truth.This', 'film', 'not', 'typical', 'movie', 'rather', 'slow', 'often', 'energy', 'many', 'non-American', 'actors', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'However', 'Thomas', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'cast', 'are', 'completely', 'believable', 'add', 'emotional', 'depth', 'story', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'Australia', 'are', 'rather', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'opening', 'shot', 'classic', 'how', 'build', 'suspense', 'Overall', 'film', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'will', 'find', 'rather', 'boring', 'moments', 'looking']",N/A
