For a start, the picture quality is terrible, like it's been taped straight off the TV.The programme has been badly researched - take for example Jean Michel Jarre's concert at the  Great Pyramids of Egypt. It's described as 'Gene Michael Jarrey's' concert  and they read comments from an earlier press release.As for the camera  work, let's take the pyramids again: it's dark, grainy and you can't even  see what's going on the stage let alone the lights on the pyramids. Instead  of paying to tap into Mike Mansfield's video feed they obviously decided  that a VHS camcorder 2 miles away would suffice!Avoid.

Now that the program is on DVD, I can relive the event like it was broadcasted on New Year's Eve back in 1999. This DVD focuses on New Year's Eve celebrations from across the world. I especially love the fireworks they shot in Sydney, Beijing, and London. The city of London, England put on an amazing fireworks show. The DVD was supposed to be approximately 2 hours long but it was actually between 70 to 80 minutes long.All in all, this is one of the best DVDs that focuses on the New Year's Eve Millennium celebrations.

As other viewers mentioned though, the quality is not top, many interesting towns are missing (like Saigon, where I was), and  in some instances four cities were on the split screens: HELLO, we are not  live anymore!
