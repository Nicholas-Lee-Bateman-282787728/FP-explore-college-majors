1287384,A1TBI0PSDYV75P,B002SQFZ68,"D. M. Nece ""ivojnob""","[1, 8]","This is a fairly decent concert blu-ray. The picture is beautiful...it really is? The 5.1 audio sound is really disappointing. The balance is terrible. The two channel sound sounds really good and the balance is beautiful, however in the HD age...who is lsitening to their blu-rays this way? That is the one draw back to a live concert that has a really good set list, especially for long time fans.To me, the biggest disappointment of this blu-ray release is the edited version of the documentary, ""When We Were Beautiful."" I watched this documentary when it aired on Showtime. As it turns out, this is so far the only time I have been able to truly enjoy it and watch it as it was intended to be seen. This is the second Bon Jovi package that I have bought since looking forward to watching it again. Both times, the other release being the Circle Deluxe CD, the documentary has been an edited version of the original piece. It is really irritating that the multi-million dollar machine that is Bon Jovi keeps squeezing money out of me for this subpar version of the documentary. If anyone, like I was, is purchasing this package mainly for the documentary I would really caution you to think before you do so. What should have been a really nice addition to this concert blu-ray really ends up a depressing let down.Just to be clear:Concert - 3.5 stars (losses points for the 5.1 audio quality)Documentary - 1.5 stars (absolutely NO reason to NOT release the authentic version)Together - 2 starsI've been a fan all my life and I believe that I am speaking for many...we deserve better.",2,The Documentary is still the edited version for some reason...why?,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,1588,"['fairly', 'decent', 'concert', 'blu-ray', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'really', '5.1', 'audio', 'sound', 'really', 'disappointing', 'balance', 'terrible', 'two', 'channel', 'sound', 'sounds', 'really', 'good', 'balance', 'beautiful', 'however', 'HD', 'age', 'who', 'lsitening', 'blu-rays', 'way', 'one', 'draw', 'back', 'live', 'concert', 'really', 'good', 'set', 'list', 'especially', 'long', 'time', 'fans.To', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'edited', 'version', 'documentary', 'When', 'Were', 'Beautiful', 'watched', 'documentary', 'when', 'aired', 'Showtime', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'second', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'package', 'have', 'bought', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'Both', 'times', 'other', 'release', 'being', 'Circle', 'Deluxe', 'CD', 'documentary', 'been', 'edited', 'version', 'original', 'piece', 'really', 'irritating', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'machine', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'squeezing', 'money', 'subpar', 'version', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'was', 'purchasing', 'package', 'mainly', 'documentary', 'would', 'really', 'caution', 'think', 'do', 'so', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'nice', 'addition', 'concert', 'blu-ray', 'really', 'up', 'depressing', 'let', 'down.Just', 'be', 'clear', 'Concert', '3.5', 'stars', 'losses', 'points', '5.1', 'audio', 'quality', 'Documentary', '1.5', 'stars', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'reason', 'NOT', 'release', 'authentic', 'version', 'Together', '2', 'starsI', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'life', 'believe', 'am', 'speaking', 'many', 'deserve', 'better']",Bon Jovi: Live at Madison Square Garden

1287389,AIO247KHD2O40,B002SQFZ68,James N Simpson,"[3, 14]","Live at Madison Square Garden is a lot better than the other Bon Jovi concert DVDs but it still doesn't quite capture the magic those of us who have been to a concert know is the Bon Jovi experience.  There is still no DVD out there that shows why Bon Jovi is the best live band in the world.  Plus the con of Bad Medicine not actually being a live performance but listed as such on the back cover is just plain wrong.  Anyway the tracks on Live at Madison Square Garden are -Lost Highway - still the same average country song no matter what they try.Born to Be My Baby - An all right version.Blaze of Glory - Slow, This Left Feels Right album like in style.  This is one of the best songs, especially the guitar intro they have in their repertoire. If I had paid money for concert tickets and had been looking forward to Blaze, and it was played like this, I'd be really annoyed.  Slow style nice for an alternative sounding album but not at a concert.It's My Life - The bar graph lights on the wall behind are really getting into this song.  Alas Jon pretty much just stood there and pointed at the roof a few times and did a few upper body frog/breaststroke actions.Keep the Faith - Jon whips out some Mexican shakers like he's in some primary school music lesson instead of playing in front of a crowd as an adult performer.  Wearing a vest and shaking the shakers around he looked just a tad foolish.  Some nice close ups of Richie's hands playing the guitar and showing how hard would be to do though.Raise Your Hands - Well when they started playing this we finally found out the crowd was alive and not just sitting there. Highlighting the poor choice of the way they were playing the songs before this one. Bon Jovi has been watching a few Wiggles DVDs (as is evident by that awful Fast Cars songs on Circle) and Jon copies the skivvy boys' moves.  Instead of the usual ""Give me a V"" shouts he usually does to the crowd, he and the crowd do starjumps but without the actual legs leaving the ground part of the move.Livin' in Sin - Not a Bad rendition.Chapel of Love - Going to the Chapel and We're Going to Get Married lyrics do add to the stalker vibe of Always that followed but they should have mentioned the words, who likes a good stalker song or Always is coming up or something as the crowd had no idea what was going on.Always - Jon starts mumbling a bit when talking about birds don't fly and words don't rhyme, then mumbles again at the end.  It's like he bit his tongue or something before telling his victim he will love her always.Whole Lot of Leavin' - Sounds all right but no huge fan of this song, better than the Lost Hwy album version though.In these Arms - Not bad but Jon's voice gets a bit winey during some of it.We Got it Going On - Enough with the Lost Hwy songs, I just pressed skip however if you were at the concert you'd have had to endure it.I'll Be There for You - Solo by Richie.  Actually probably sounded better than Jon would have with his deteriorating voice at this stage of the night.  David also backed up with the lyrics. Shows maybe what might happen if Jon died and Bon Jovi kept going with the tours.  Not sure why this happened, if it was just to rest Jon's voice or an admission that two hours is a long time for the ageing singer and his older bladder just can't last for two hours without being emptied.(You Want to) Make a Memory - Jon comes back on stage in a pink shirt for this ballad.Blood on Blood - Still wearing the pink shirt starts singing close to the crowd while some middle age woman yells a one sided conversation with him as he sings.  He then walks around a row in the crowd, so the cameras don't capture her being removed by security.Dry Country - Pretty good sounding but has back turned to the audience for a fair while.Have a Nice Day - Reawakens the crowd after the slower Dry County ballad.  Is a good choice for a concert playlist for this reason.Who Says You Can't Go Home - Many in the crowd wished they knew if this was the last song for the night or not as they would have done just that if it was.  Just as annoying live at Madison as on the ablum.Hallelujah - I skip any religious propaganda, Bon Jovi used to be about the religion of Rockn' Roll now he's singing Praise the Lord. What happened to the inflatable devils and half naked inflatable women of past decade concerts? So many good songs left out of the night's playlist for this.Wanted Dead of Alive - Just like Blaze of Glory, the cool guitar intro is not present.Livin' on a Prayer - Asks the Crowd ""So What?""  They don't have an answer let alone the usual ""We'll Give it a Shot"" reply.  Never understand why they get such un into it crowds on the nights they film these DVDs.Bad Medicine - Just the recorded version played over the credits.  A pretty big con, this is not mentioned on the DVD cover.  It implies it's part of the concert on there.  There really is no excuse for this it is just misleading.You Give Love a Bad Name - Very well done but not part of the concert DVD, you have to reach this by bonus track.  Clearly it was filmed at the concert and near the start due to costumes had on at time.  Why not just leave it where it was?Runaway - Again very well done, makes you also wonder what great songs and concert staples might have been played and left off the DVD such as Lay Your Hands on Me, Sleep When I'm Dead and the always interesting to see how the opening guitar rift is played this time round, Something for the Pain.Bed of Roses - Obviously from Pink Shirt part of the concert.  I don't really like this song but this is the best it's ever sounded.  Jon does the most crowed interaction of the night walking around with security and holding women's hands and things like this.Easily the best DVD of the live concerts but also some obviousness that they are getting on a bit at times with Jon's voice and so forth.",4,"Probably the Best Live Bon Jovi DVD, But There's a Few Negative Issues",1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,5884,"['Live', 'Madison',

1287391,AENRHAKDM5GMP,B002SQFZ68,"J. Lockridge ""jllx""","[6, 14]","I had to recheck my system and recalibrate it several times before I realized that this DVD is perhaps one of the worst mixed concert DVDs I've ever listened to. Everything is out of phase, there is no significantly directional low end, and the vocals are disembodied and do NOT fit into the sound stage. It's as if someone who never mixed 5.1 suddenly just threw in a plug in (ahem, Waves anyone?) that extrapolated a 5.1 mix from a 2.1 mix without doing the work that it actually takes to do it. I would believe that is the main problem, except that the 2.1 mix is almost as bad. Let me qualify my opinion by stating that I'm a professional audio engineer and musician, so, take it for what you will...Trust me, this DVD is already being used in MANY recording classes and mixing classes as an unfortunate example of How NOT to mix audio for a concert...Then there's all the ""jumping"" video---this is very unprofessional. There is absolutely no way the filmmakers wouldn't have known beforehand that some of the mounts they were using were NOT sturdy under the SPL's of a live show. OK, so maybe they didn't think about it---oh well, then WHY did the video mixer/editors include all that shaky crap? No excuse...ugh. And while we're on the video editing---could we NOT edit a little better when we're dealing with crowd shots? I mean, the 300 lb. grossness is not what I'm paying to see---I mean, c'mon--- jiggling sweat all over the place---out of time dancing---I'll have nightmares for a LONG time. For that reason alone, this film should've been rated ""F"" for ""Fugly"". I've never been a fan of crowd shots at all anyways, but especially not when they include the sagging, middle aged, drunk crosseyed sweaty obese women trying to dance and just stand up with their hamburgers dripping from their mouths. Don't think that's pretty? Didn't think so...Then there's the performances---well. Let's just say this wasn't one of the band's hottest nights. Lots of errors, lots of out of tune guitar, and lots of badness in the BG vox, lots of bass guitar flubs and several places where the drums get out of time with the SMPTE track...I was shocked. There was another rhythm guitarist backing up Ritchie, but because the mix was so bad, Ritchie (?sp.) was ""on his own"" (and not for the good) most of the night. As far Jon, he was, as usual, near perfect, vocally, but the mix covered him up and distracted from the quality of his voice. As well, the OBVIOUSLY overblown attempt to channel ""The Boss"" just seemed silly, from the V neck chest exposed leather to the out stretched hands gesturing the audience aimlessly, Jon is beyond this. Richie, bless him, still thinks he's the second coming of Stevie Ray, and between the two of them, you just sort of feel like you're watching an SNL skit...OK, the documentary is pretty good. But, man, I just get a sick feeling when Bon Jovi tells the band to ""just have fun"" at the beginning---it just seems so contrived, so paternalistic, so arrogant, so condescending all at once, when I'm sure he didn't intend it.I'm going to petition the company to allow a competent mixing engineer to redo this package. When/if that happens, I will consider rebuying it. For now, I am returning it. For all its flaws, most of which are acceptable (although the performances are nearly reasons to have NOT released this DVD), the amateurish, inept mix is most definitely NOT one of them.If you're a very big Bon Jovi fan, and you want a good documentary, then buy this disc. If you're just wanting the concert, then I'd suggest you wait on a better mix, or a new release that will hopefully employ more professional mixing engineers. If the mix were just acceptable, I would have given this at least 3 stars; however, it is nowhere near that and I was torn between a 1 and a 2 star rating, so I erred on the higher end but I don't feel good about it.",2,HORRID Mixing and some BAD photography for a show with a LOT of blemishes....,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,3876,"['had', 'recheck', 'system', 'recalibrate', 'several', 'times', 'realized', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'one', 'worst', 'mixed', 'concert', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'Everything', 'phase', 'significantly', 'directional', 'low', 'end', 'vocals', 'are', 'disembodied', 'do', 'NOT', 'fit', 'sound', 'stage', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'mixed', '5.1', 'suddenly', 'just', 'threw', 'plug', 'ahem', 'anyone', 'extrapolated', '5.1', 'mix', '2.1', 'mix', 'doing', 'work', 'actually', 'do', 'would', 'believe', 'main', 'problem', '2.1', 'mix', 'almost', 'bad', 'Let', 'qualify', 'opinion', 'stating', ""'m"", 'professional', 'audio', 'engineer', 'musician', 'so', 'take', 'what', 'will', 'Trust', 'DVD', 'already', 'being', 'used', 'MANY', 'recording', 'classes', 'mixing', 'classes', 'unfortunate', 'example', 'How', 'NOT', 'mix', 'audio', 'concert', 'Then', 'jumping', 'video', '-this', 'very', 'unprofessional', 'absolutely', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'beforehand', 'mounts', 'were', 'using', 'were', 'NOT', 'sturdy', 'SPL', 'live', 'show', 'OK', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', '-oh', 'well', 'then', 'WHY', 'did', 'video', 'mixer/editors', 'include', 'shaky', 'crap', 'No', 'excuse', 'ugh', ""'re"", 'video', 'editing', '-could', 'NOT', 'edit', 'little', 'better', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'crowd', 'shots', 'mean', '300', 'lb', 'grossness', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'paying', 'see', '-I', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'jiggling', 'sweat', 'place', 'time', 'dancing', '-I', ""'ll"", 'have', 'nightmares', 'LONG', 'time', 'reason', 'alone', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rated', 'F', 'Fugly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'crowd', 'shots', 'anyways', 'especially', 'not', 'when', 'include', 'sagging', 'middle', 'aged', 'drunk', 'crosseyed', 'sweaty', 'obese', 'women', 'trying', 'dance', 'just', 'stand', 'up', 'hamburgers', 'dripping', 'mouths', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'pretty', 'Did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Then', 'performances', '-well', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'band', 'hottest', 'nights', 'Lots', 'errors', 'lots', 'tune', 'guitar', 'lots', 'badness', 'BG', 'vox', 'lots', 'bass', 'guitar', 'flubs', 'several', 'places', 'where', 'drums', 'get', 'time', 'SMPTE', 'track', 'was', 'shocked', 'was', 'rhythm', 'guitarist', 'backing', 'up', 'Ritchie', 'mix', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'Ritchie', 'sp', 'was', 'own', 'not', 'good', 'most', 'night', 'far', 'Jon', 'was', 'usual', 'near', 'perfect', 'vocally', 'mix', 'covered', 'up', 'distracted', 'quality', 'voice', 'well', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'overblown', 'attempt', 'channel', 'Boss', 'just', 'seemed', 'silly', 'V', 'neck', 'chest', 'exposed', 'leather', 'out', 'stretched', 'hands', 'gesturing', 'audience', 'aimlessly', 'Jon', 'Richie', 'bless', 'still', 'second', 'coming', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'two', 'just', 'sort', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'SNL', 'skit', 'OK', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'man', 'just', 'get', 'sick', 'feeling', 'when', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'band', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'beginning', '-it', 'just', 'so', 'contrived', 'so', 'paternalistic', 'so', 'arrogant', 'condescending', 'once', 'when', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'petition', 'company', 'allow', 'competent', 'mixing', 'engineer', 'redo', 'package', 'When/if', 'will', 'consider', 'rebuying', 'now', 'am', 'returning', 'flaws', 'most', 'are', 'acceptable', 'performances', 'are', 'nearly', 'reasons', 'have', 'NOT', 'released', 'DVD', 'amateurish', 'inept', 'mix', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'one', 'them.If', ""'re"", 'very', 'big', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'fan', 'want', 'good', 'documentary', 'then', 'buy', 'disc', ""'re"", 'just', 'wanting', 'concert', 'then', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'wait', 'better', 'mix', 'new', 'release', 'will', 'hopefully', 'employ', 'more', 'professional', 'mixing', 'engineers', 'mix', 'were', 'just', 'acceptable', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'least', '3', 'stars', 'however', 'nowhere', 'was', 'torn', '1', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'erred', 'higher', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good']",Bon Jovi: Live at Madison Square Garden
