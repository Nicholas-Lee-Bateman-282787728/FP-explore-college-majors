204516,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6300184048,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[43, 46]","What better movie for a priest to review than 'Mass Appeal'?  Directed by Glenn Jackson, and co-starring veteran actors Jack Lemmon and Charles Durning with relative newcomer Zeljko Ivanek, this story has influenced me in interesting ways.Lemmon plays Father Farley, a jaded, settled Roman Catholic rector of a prominent parish, ultimately dis-satisfied with his lot in life but terrified nonetheless of losing it. Into this comfortable world steps an upstart seminarian Dolson (played by Ivanek), who has more principle than tact, and more passion than people skills.The rector and the seminarian end up being placed together in a mentoring situation by the seminary dean, Mons. Burke (Durning), an autocratic moralist with strict rules on priestly formation. Various issues resound in the relationships of each of these characters with each other, the seminary, the congregation, and ultimately with their own destinies. Farley's issues with past abuse, Dolson's life on the wild side prior to seminary, and Burke's paranoia all enter the interplay of church politics and the discernment of a spiritual calling.Farley is both irritated by and inspired by the seminarian. The seminarian takes a stand for honesty which costs him his appointment. The dean refuses to listen to anyone, including his friend Farley, and begins to question Farley's integrity as a priest as well.Farley learns that it is never to late to hear a call, and that what he thought was his call in fact was a facade. Dolson finally realises that the in-your-face approach to public relations is not very pastoral, but his listening skills far exceed those around him, and he becomes trusted by Farley. Alas, the dean--what becomes of him? We never know.Where God leads is a difficult question, with no easy answers, and we can spend much of our time following our version of that vocation without really ever touching the substance of it (as did Father Farley). We can be so overzealous for it that we might burn it out before it comes into being, rather like a forced hot-house flower that blooms prematurely and then dies too soon (similar to Dolson's experience).This is an interesting film which brings up issues of polity, morality, reconciliation and redemption, themes that are far more prevalent in life than we would ordinarily think. This movie may not have mass appeal but can be enjoyed and, perhaps, give insight to all viewers, be they Roman Catholic, other denominations of Christian, of other religions, or even no religion at all.",5,Apropos,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,2521,"['What', 'better', 'movie', 'priest', 'review', ""'Mass"", 'Appeal', 'Directed', 'Glenn', 'Jackson', 'co-starring', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'story', 'influenced', 'interesting', 'ways.Lemmon', 'Father', 'Farley', 'jaded', 'settled', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'rector', 'prominent', 'parish', 'ultimately', 'dis-satisfied', 'lot', 'life', 'terrified', 'nonetheless', 'losing', 'comfortable', 'world', 'upstart', 'seminarian', 'Dolson', 'played', 'Ivanek', 'who', 'more', 'principle', 'tact', 'more', 'passion', 'people', 'skills.The', 'rector', 'seminarian', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'placed', 'together', 'mentoring', 'situation', 'seminary', 'dean', 'Mons', 'Burke', 'Durning', 'autocratic', 'moralist', 'strict', 'rules', 'priestly', 'formation', 'Various', 'issues', 'resound', 'relationships', 'characters', 'other', 'seminary', 'congregation', 'ultimately', 'own', 'destinies', 'Farley', 'issues', 'past', 'abuse', 'Dolson', 'life', 'wild', 'side', 'prior', 'seminary', 'Burke', 'paranoia', 'enter', 'interplay', 'church', 'politics', 'discernment', 'spiritual', 'calling.Farley', 'irritated', 'inspired', 'seminarian', 'seminarian', 'stand', 'honesty', 'appointment', 'dean', 'refuses', 'listen', 'anyone', 'including', 'friend', 'Farley', 'question', 'Farley', 'integrity', 'priest', 'well.Farley', 'never', 'late', 'hear', 'call', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'call', 'fact', 'was', 'facade', 'Dolson', 'finally', 'in-your-face', 'approach', 'public', 'relations', 'not', 'very', 'pastoral', 'listening', 'skills', 'far', 'exceed', 'becomes', 'trusted', 'Farley', 'Alas', 'dean', 'what', 'never', 'know.Where', 'God', 'difficult', 'question', 'easy', 'answers', 'can', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'following', 'version', 'vocation', 'really', 'ever', 'touching', 'substance', 'did', 'Father', 'Farley', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'overzealous', 'might', 'burn', 'out', 'being', 'rather', 'forced', 'hot-house', 'flower', 'prematurely', 'then', 'too', 'soon', 'similar', 'Dolson', 'experience', '.This', 'interesting', 'film', 'up', 'issues', 'polity', 'morality', 'reconciliation', 'redemption', 'themes', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'prevalent', 'life', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'think', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'mass', 'appeal', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'perhaps', 'give', 'insight', 'viewers', 'be', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'other', 'denominations', 'Christian', 'other', 'religions', 'even', 'religion']",N/A

204522,A6FIAB28IS79,6300184048,Samuel Chell,"[18, 20]","Humphrey Bogart, Bing Crosby, Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Jack Lemmon--what do they have in common?  All played priests, but no one more convincingly  than Lemmon in this story about a popular, &quot;bourgeois,&quot; crowd-pleasing conservative priest who is suddenly challenged by a young liberal seminarian representing honesty, forthrightness, and social change.  The &quot;message&quot; primarily concerns the old dog, popular priest learning to change his ways, while the radical young seminarian also absorbs lessons about the real world and dealing with people.  But forget about the story and its themes.  As a movie, &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; is 3 stars; as a script 4; as a vehicle for one of the screen's most colorful, personable, irresistibly charismatic actors, it's 5 all the way.  Here's proof positive: though the story calls for Lemmon to play the part of the rather &quot;bad&quot; guy--someone who lies and schmoozes and sugar-coats the Gospel in order to fill the offering plates each Sunday--it's his character and not the seminarian's who rivets our attention, maintains our interest, and inhabits our memories long after the film is over.  The truth-telling, liberal, activist seminarian, on the other hand, is little more than a &quot;generic&quot; character  cast from a late 1960s mold.  The point is that neither of the parts is especially distinguished on the basis of the writing alone; rather, it's Lemmon's unique ability to give a &quot;face&quot; to his role that makes both his character as well as the film work.",5,Lemmon at his sourly best.,994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,1551,"['Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'common', 'played', 'priests', 'one', 'more', 'convincingly', 'Lemmon', 'story', 'popular', 'quot', 'bourgeois', 'quot', 'crowd-pleasing', 'conservative', 'priest', 'who', 'suddenly', 'challenged', 'young', 'liberal', 'seminarian', 'representing', 'honesty', 'forthrightness', 'social', 'change', 'quot', 'message', 'quot', 'primarily', 'old', 'dog', 'popular', 'priest', 'learning', 'change', 'ways', 'radical', 'young', 'seminarian', 'also', 'absorbs', 'lessons', 'real', 'world', 'dealing', 'people', 'forget', 'story', 'themes', 'movie', 'quot', 'Mass', 'Appeal', 'quot', '3', 'stars', 'script', '4', 'vehicle', 'one', 'screen', 'most', 'colorful', 'personable', 'irresistibly', 'charismatic', 'actors', '5', 'way', 'Here', 'proof', 'positive', 'story', 'Lemmon', 'play', 'part', 'rather', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'guy', 'someone', 'who', 'schmoozes', 'sugar-coats', 'Gospel', 'order', 'fill', 'offering', 'Sunday', 'character', 'not', 'seminarian', 'who', 'attention', 'interest', 'memories', 'long', 'film', 'truth-telling', 'liberal', 'activist', 'seminarian', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'more', 'quot', 'generic', 'quot', 'character', 'cast', 'late', '1960s', 'mold', 'point', 'parts', 'especially', 'distinguished', 'basis', 'writing', 'alone', 'rather', 'Lemmon', 'unique', 'ability', 'give', 'quot', 'face', 'quot', 'role', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'work']",N/A

This movie revolves around a priest who has become beloved by his congregation and compromises himself (to an extent) for the sake of keeping his status. Later, a hot headed Deacon who simply speaks his mind comes on the scene. We must not look upon this movie as merely the established priest learning a lesson in honesty. RATHER, we must see it as the established priest AND the hot headed deacon learning a lesson from EACH OTHER! The established priest eventually learns that status should not take priority over honesty and integrity. The hot headed deacon learns that even brutal honesty has to be conveyed in a civil way. I do not recommend this if you are questioning whether you should go to church or not. On the other hand, if you are well grounded in your faith, this is an interesting study.

204527,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6300184048,Westley,"[2, 2]","""Mass Appeal"" is one of Jack Lemmon's lesser known films; I hadn't heard much about it, so I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Lemmon plays Father Tim Farley, a popular Catholic priest in a wealthy area of Los Angeles.  His congregation adores him, often seeking out for advice and gifting him with wine.  His masses are softball feel-good affairs, although Father Tim likes to think that he challenges his congregration via occasional ""dialogue sermons,"" during which he takes questions about hot topics (e.g., female priests).  At one such sermon, Father Tim finds himself pressed by a young man (Mark Dolson played by Zeljko Ivanek); irritated, he's surprised to find out that Dolson is in the seminary.  When the local Monsignor announces that he is not letting Dolson continue on to become a Deacon, Father Tim (against his better judgment) argues that Dolson should get another chance.  However, he regrets it when the Monsignor agrees - as long as Dolson serves in Father Tim's church.Based on a play by Bill C. Davis, ""Mass Appeal"" sounds like heavy-going, but it's actually a warm, light comedy.  Dolson and Father Tim clash in amusing ways, but gradually they learn from each other, leading to the big if predictable conclusion.  Jack Lemmon is terrific as Father Tim, and even gets a drunk scene that allows him to stretch a bit.  Louise Latham also scores as Father Tim's loyal but rather neurotic housekeeper.  The obscurity of ""Mass Appeal"" is a pity, as it's really a quite good movie.  I think it would appeal (pun intended), for example, to fans of the Mitford book series.",4,Surprisingly good,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1613,"['Mass', 'Appeal', 'one', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Lemmon', 'Father', 'Tim', 'Farley', 'popular', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'wealthy', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'congregation', 'often', 'seeking', 'out', 'advice', 'gifting', 'wine', 'masses', 'are', 'softball', 'feel-good', 'affairs', 'Father', 'Tim', 'think', 'congregration', 'occasional', 'dialogue', 'sermons', 'questions', 'hot', 'topics', 'e.g.', 'female', 'priests', 'one', 'such', 'sermon', 'Father', 'Tim', 'pressed', 'young', 'man', 'Mark', 'Dolson', 'played', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'irritated', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Dolson', 'seminary', 'When', 'local', 'Monsignor', 'announces', 'not', 'letting', 'Dolson', 'continue', 'become', 'Deacon', 'Father', 'Tim', 'better', 'judgment', 'Dolson', 'should', 'get', 'chance', 'However', 'when', 'Monsignor', 'as', 'long', 'Dolson', 'Father', 'Tim', 'church.Based', 'play', 'Bill', 'C.', 'Davis', 'Mass', 'Appeal', 'heavy-going', 'actually', 'warm', 'light', 'comedy', 'Dolson', 'Father', 'Tim', 'clash', 'amusing', 'ways', 'gradually', 'learn', 'other', 'leading', 'big', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'terrific', 'Father', 'Tim', 'even', 'drunk', 'scene', 'stretch', 'bit', 'Louise', 'Latham', 'also', 'Father', 'Tim', 'loyal', 'rather', 'neurotic', 'housekeeper', 'obscurity', 'Mass', 'Appeal', 'pity', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'appeal', 'pun', 'intended', 'example', 'fans', 'Mitford', 'book', 'series']",N/A
