47656,A1TAWJ2PA3USVX,0783219598,,"[5, 5]","Babe is an endearing tale of a talking pig--an a lot of other talking animals--on an eccentric farm run by eccentric Farmer Hoggett.  The plot is quirky and funny, and, yes, rather heartwarming, though it has sad moments, too.Filmed in Australia, the film has enough of the 'place' taken out' that kids from many lands will watch this and think they are seeing their homeland.  That, and the sensational computer-aided talking animal effects, will make the film a must-see for kids under ten.But, wait; Babe is quirky and fun enough that adults will enjoy it, too.  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was caught sneaking out of the theater according to the Washington Post, if I recall!  If he can see Babe, so can you.As an adult, you'll probably love two things.  First, there's an inspiring sound track revolving around variations of Camille Saint-Saen's Organ Symphony.  Next, there's James Cromwell's Oscar-nominated performance as tight-lipped Farmer Hoggett.  If you have only become familiar with this wonderful actor for more recent roles such as the demented new husband in ""Six Feet Under"" or the crooked Irish police captain in ""LA Confidential,"" this role will surprise and delight you.  The scene where he hoofs and sings the theme song to cheer up Babe the Pig is a delight, evolving from a scratchy lullaby to a sailor's hornpipe, to a full symphonic rendition!  That alone is worth the price of the DVD.And, yes, one star off for sub-optimal DVD quality, but it isn't that bad.

47665,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783219598,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I know, I know; very bold statement, but I challenge you to watch `Babe' and not draw the same conclusion.  When I first saw `Babe' all those years ago I was like ten and I adored it.  But here is the true testament to the brilliance that is `Babe'; I watched it just this past week and LOVED it.Yes, `Babe' ages very, very well.  It is pure family entertainment that shines brightly, giving the audience laughs and tears and heartwarming moments of beauty and peace.  `Babe' is a monumental achievement in the world of family (or children's) entertainment for it reaches a level of overall satisfaction without ever having to spice the film with adult humor or forced maturity.  This is a children's film that appeals to adults without ever catering to adults, and that is a feat in itself.  Unlike `Shrek' and recent so-called children's films that have followed, `Babe' never goes over the child's head yet it always maintains the adult's attention.`Babe' tells the story a young orphan pig who escapes slaughter by displaying his ability to herd sheep.  His owner, Arthur Hoggett enters Babe into a sheep-herding contest despite everyone's disapproval.The beauty within `Babe' is not found in the plot (which is pretty simple) but in the underlying emotional connection between Hoggett and Babe and, well, Babe and everyone.  It really shows that family can never be defined and that you can be loved and show love to any and everyone, regardless of race or even species.  At its heart Babe is a story about acceptance and love.James Cromwell is amazing as Farmer Hoggett.  There is a beautiful scene where he nurses Babe back to health after a night spent in the rain and he does this little jig to try and cheer him up and his performance is so sincere and so genuine, which must be hard to muster when working with a mechanical pig.  It's a wonder to me why he didn't win that Oscar, I mean Spacey was good (albeit nominated for the wrong performance) but of the final five Cromwell was by far the most deserving.  The voiceover actors are all flawless as well and truly add to the cartoon-like vibe of the film.In the end there are few films this heartfelt and moving, at least in this genre.  It is not a sappy saccharine type film that plays too heavy on the heartstrings but this is a pure and emotionally balanced film that manages to appear real and raw despite its very fairytale like prose.",5,"It's like `Charlottes Web', only better...",1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,2405,"['know', 'know', 'very', 'bold', 'statement', 'challenge', 'watch', 'Babe', 'not', 'draw', 'same', 'conclusion', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Babe', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'like', 'ten', 'adored', 'here', 'true', 'testament', 'brilliance', 'Babe', 'watched', 'just', 'past', 'week', 'LOVED', 'it.Yes', 'Babe', 'ages', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'pure', 'family', 'entertainment', 'brightly', 'giving', 'audience', 'laughs', 'tears', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'beauty', 'peace', 'Babe', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'world', 'family', 'children', 'entertainment', 'level', 'overall', 'satisfaction', 'ever', 'having', 'spice', 'film', 'adult', 'humor', 'forced', 'maturity', 'children', 'film', 'appeals', 'adults', 'ever', 'catering', 'adults', 'feat', 'Shrek', 'recent', 'so-called', 'children', 'films', 'have', 'followed', 'Babe', 'never', 'child', 'head', 'yet', 'always', 'adult', 'attention.', 'Babe', 'story', 'young', 'orphan', 'pig', 'who', 'slaughter', 'displaying', 'ability', 'herd', 'sheep', 'owner', 'Arthur', 'Hoggett', 'enters', 'Babe', 'sheep-herding', 'contest', 'everyone', 'disapproval.The', 'beauty', 'Babe', 'not', 'found', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'underlying', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Hoggett', 'Babe', 'well', 'Babe', 'everyone', 'really', 'family', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'defined', 'can', 'be', 'loved', 'show', 'love', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'race', 'even', 'species', 'heart', 'Babe', 'story', 'acceptance', 'love.James', 'Cromwell', 'amazing', 'Farmer', 'Hoggett', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'where', 'Babe', 'back', 'health', 'night', 'spent', 'rain', 'little', 'jig', 'try', 'cheer', 'up', 'performance', 'so', 'sincere', 'so', 'genuine', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'muster', 'when', 'working', 'mechanical', 'pig', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'mean', 'Spacey', 'was', 'good', 'nominated', 'wrong', 'performance', 'final', 'five', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'deserving', 'voiceover', 'actors', 'are', 'flawless', 'as', 'well', 'truly', 'add', 'cartoon-like', 'vibe', 'film.In', 'end', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'least', 'genre', 'not', 'sappy', 'saccharine', 'type', 'film', 'too', 'heavy', 'heartstrings', 'pure', 'emotionally', 'balanced', 'film', 'appear', 'real', 'raw', 'very', 'fairytale', 'prose']",N/A

47668,A4IQXCCXDEAKW,0783219598,Anne P. Mitchell,"[13, 20]","I had a hard time with whether or not to recommend the movie ""Babe"" in this review. Overall, it is a cute movie, but it has a lot of issues, and so I would not recommend it readily, and certainly not for someone under the age of, say, 12, and then only with eyes wide open.It isn't the language (there is only one notable language issue - when one of the animals calls another a ""butt head"").It's the violence. This is a very violent movie; much more so than I had remembered from the first time I saw it, back when it first came out.It starts with the farmer taking the baby pig (""Babe"") out to shoot him for Christmas dinner. He carries a loaded shotgun, and you see him walk out with it, you hear the shot, and then you see him walking back to the house with a dead animal (which turns out to be a duck, not Babe).Then you see several animals looking through a window into the house, at the Christmas dinner scene, including a different duck, who is mourning the dead duck that they are eating.And that's only the beginning.As Babe becomes more of a favourite around the farm, and starts trying to herd sheep, one of the two real sheep dogs - the male - goes crazy, and attacks his mate (the female sheep dog - ""Mom"" - Babe's `adopted mother') in a fight which leaves her and the farmer wounded, and causes the male dog to be chained, muzzled, and drugged into a near comatose state.During this time, Babe is making friends with the sheep, whom the dogs consider stupid and worthy of contempt - a feeling which is returned by the sheep.The oldest sheep - Ma (or, in sheep, ""Ma-a-a-a"") - is a wise old female sheep, and is very sweet to Babe. In a horrific scene, she is attacked by a pack of wild dogs, brought down, and killed. The entire ruff around her neck is bloody. Babe, who drives the dogs off, sobs by her dead body, his own nose bloodied. That is how the farmer finds them, and he believes that Babe has killed the sheep. The next scene is of the dead sheep being driven back to the farm, on the back of a flatbed truck, her head flopping along the edge of the bed of the truck. The next scene is a very tense several moments of the farmer loading his shotgun, and taking Babe out to the shed, cocking the shotgun, and aiming it at Babe's head... finger on the trigger, slowly squeezing. (Because, you see, the rule is that any animal that kills a sheep has to be killed, and the farmer thinks that Babe killed Ma.)In addition to the violence, there is bullying and intimidation (dogs to the sheep, a cat to Babe), and, of course, the ""butt head"", which in contrast to the violence seems tame, but is, none the less, pretty objectionable.Perhaps I wouldn't have been so surprised and disappointed if ""Babe"" had garnered at least a PG rating, but these sorts of scenes are not what I expect - or want - in a G rated movie.Anne[...]",3,"A Crunchy Parental Review of ""Babe""",1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2843,"['had', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Babe', 'review', 'Overall', 'cute', 'movie', 'lot', 'issues', 'so', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'readily', 'certainly', 'not', 'someone', 'age', 'say', '12', 'then', 'only', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open.It', ""n't"", 'language', 'only', 'one', 'notable', 'language', 'issue', 'when', 'one', 'animals', 'butt', 'head', '.It', 'violence', 'very', 'violent', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'had', 'remembered', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out.It', 'starts', 'farmer', 'taking', 'baby', 'pig', 'Babe', 'shoot', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'loaded', 'shotgun', 'see', 'walk', 'hear', 'shot', 'then', 'see', 'walking', 'back', 'house', 'dead', 'animal', 'out', 'be', 'duck', 'not', 'Babe', '.Then', 'see', 'several', 'animals', 'looking', 'window', 'house', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'scene', 'including', 'different', 'duck', 'who', 'mourning', 'dead', 'duck', 'are', 'eating.And', 'only', 'beginning.As', 'Babe', 'more', 'favourite', 'farm', 'trying', 'herd', 'sheep', 'one', 'two', 'real', 'sheep', 'dogs', 'male', 'crazy', 'mate', 'female', 'sheep', 'dog', 'Mom', 'Babe', 'adopted', 'mother', 'fight', 'farmer', 'wounded', 'male', 'dog', 'be', 'chained', 'muzzled', 'drugged', 'near', 'comatose', 'state.During', 'time', 'Babe', 'making', 'friends', 'sheep', 'whom', 'dogs', 'consider', 'stupid', 'worthy', 'contempt', 'feeling', 'returned', 'sheep.The', 'oldest', 'sheep', 'Ma', 'sheep', 'Ma-a-a-a', 'wise', 'old', 'female', 'sheep', 'very', 'sweet', 'Babe', 'horrific', 'scene', 'attacked', 'pack', 'wild', 'dogs', 'brought', 'down', 'killed', 'entire', 'ruff', 'neck', 'bloody', 'Babe', 'who', 'dogs', 'off', 'sobs', 'dead', 'body', 'own', 'nose', 'bloodied', 'how', 'farmer', 'Babe', 'killed', 'sheep', 'next', 'scene', 'dead', 'sheep', 'being', 'driven', 'back', 'farm', 'back', 'flatbed', 'truck', 'head', 'flopping', 'edge', 'bed', 'truck', 'next', 'scene', 'very', 'tense', 'several', 'moments', 'farmer', 'loading', 'shotgun', 'taking', 'Babe', 'shed', 'cocking', 'shotgun', 'aiming', 'Babe', 'head', 'finger', 'trigger', 'slowly', 'squeezing', 'see', 'rule', 'animal', 'sheep', 'be', 'killed', 'farmer', 'Babe', 'killed', 'Ma', 'addition', 'violence', 'bullying', 'intimidation', 'dogs', 'sheep', 'cat', 'Babe', 'course', 'butt', 'head', 'contrast', 'violence', 'tame', 'none', 'less', 'pretty', 'objectionable.Perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'Babe', 'had', 'garnered', 'least', 'PG', 'rating', 'sorts', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'want', 'G', 'rated', 'movie.Anne', '[', ']']",N/A

It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand, a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster, three literate musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members, and best of all, Babe, a Hoy piglet, learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs, Rex and Fly, to win the annual sheep herding competition.Clever animation, well done animatronic creature-doubles by Jim Henson's studio, and a menagerie of superbly trained real farm animals makes the superior story of the little piggie who could more than just a cute bacon for breakfast situation.  A film for the entire family, it is simple and underscores the notion that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself are to be respected in the kingdom of all animals.  Babe brings to the screen through comedy and drama, life lessons that all ages can understand without being preachy or didactic.  One cheers for the farmer and his porker as they challenge the conventions and expectations with subtle humor and respect.As the piglet grows bigger through the great job of fattening up by Mrs. Hoggit, he makes friends with an elderly ewe who conveys much wisdom about the rules of farm life, where Rex is the dominant dog, and the sheep are considered ignorant. However, Farmer Hoggit and Babe share a special relationship that confounds his wife, the sheep dogs, and the sheep. He trains Babe how to herd sheep and he's a mighty smart and fast learner, ultimately changing the rules that dominated the pecking order of the barnyard motto - ""because that's the way it's always been"" with his good manners and friendship.James Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggit gives an understated, superb performance as the patient farmer who is willing to give a young pig a chance. This is one of the most delightful family films and perfect for seasonal get-togethers, or just because it's a nice change to see film devoid of inane car chases, mindless explosions, and peppered with four letter words, yet, adult in its message.

I strongly recommend 1995's ""Babe"".A live-action (enhanced with puppets and animation) tale of an orphaned pig (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), the understanding farmer who 'adopts' him (James Cromwell, who is FABULOUS!), and the barnyard animals who become his family, the film sparkles from the opening credits until the closing ones, enriched by a warm, wise narration by Roscoe Lee Browne. Chapters are introduced by three of the most lovable mice you'll ever encounter, and the chapter about Christmas, while only a small part of the story, is hilarious (the farm's somewhat paranoid duck, realizing what the main course of the holiday dinner will be, shrieks ""Christmas is CARNAGE!"").While most farm-oriented family films tend to be either too juvenile or too cloyingly saccharin, ""Babe"" never falls into either rut, succeeding in being cute enough to enchant children, and sly enough to appeal to adults...and it is very, very funny, to boot!

This particular video store has this deal where older films are only 99 cents, so I started thinking about what I've missed  over the past few years and I decided to rent the &quot;family&quot; film,  &quot;Babe&quot; from 1995.  &quot;The 'Citizen Kane' of talking pig  pictures,&quot; the cover promised.&quot;Babe&quot; is the name of a  pig, a &quot;worthless little runt&quot; who, unlike his mother early on,  is not destined to become bacon, but instead lands on a farm.  The farm is  run by Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell in a quiet, understated performance).  He takes a liking to the little pig and so does his wife, albeit for  different reasons.  The farm has many animals, all of whom it seems Babe  gets to know (all the animals talk).  There's lots of sheep because it's a  sheep farm and there are a couple of dogs, the authoritarian Rex and a  female collie Fly (who becomes a sort of surrogate mother to Babe).  There  are horses and a cat with a nasty disposition.  And then there's my  favorite - an anorexic duck named Ferdinand.  Even though Fly claims the  bosses eat only stupid animals, Ferdinand is no dummy; he's figured out  what &quot;Christmas dinner&quot; means.The plot has Babe working to  become a sheep dog (or &quot;sheep pig&quot;) and what with the National  Sheep Dog trials approaching, it doesn't take a genius to figure out where  the movie's headed.  But it's the small details, not the overall story that  I appreciated.  Take, for instance, the chapter titles, which are  punctuated by these tiny little musical mice.  One title features an  excerpt from &quot;Carmen&quot;, another a high-pitched rendition of  &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.

With gentle humor, engaging characters, and some truly lovely scenes, the movie strives to show that breaking out of the mold isn't always a bad thing.Babe longs to be a sheepdog and his quest makes for an excellent metaphor about following one's dreams and being true to one's self regardless of the opposition.  Perhaps the most wonderful thing about the movie is that Babe triumphs not because of his ambition or his ruthlessness but because of his sweetness and his genuinely nice nature.  It is his politeness and his considerateness that helps him to emerge victorious in the end and when couldn't the world use a little more kindness?  This is an ageless and wonderful message that is well worth sharing with children.James Cromwell is simply wonderful in this movie.  Though a man of few words, he expresses so much just by the look on his face.  One of the best scenes in the film, though, occurs when the farmer dances a jig to try to cheer up his little pig.

Babe (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh) is the runt of his litter, which may be what saves him from slaughter: he's donated to a country fair as the subject and prize of a guess-its-weight contest and won by Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell), a laconic fellow who slowly comes to feel that the little porker may be more than he seems.  Lonely for his litter-sibs, Babe is taken in by Fly (Miriam Margoyles), the farm's sheepdog bitch (rather against the better judgment of her drill-sergeant mate Rex (Hugo Weaving)), and raised as one of her pups.  It's Fly who explains the business of sheepherding to Babe, but it's Babe who makes friends with the old ewe Maa (Miriam Flynn)--dogs think sheep are too stupid to relate to as equals--and raises the alarm when a pair of sheep-rustlers and their dogs attempt to make off with Hoggett's flock.  He even saves the sheep from a trio of wild dogs.  Meanwhile he's begun to display a herding gift of his own, separating chickens in the farmyard by color, which is what first makes Hoggett wonder if a pig could be trained as a herder.  But when he learns the usual fate of pigs, it takes Hoggett, Rex, and Fly to save him before he can die of despair.  Then, entered into the sheepdog trials, he finds that the sheep he's supposed to herd refuse to talk to him.  How can he win the trial for Farmer Hoggett if he can't persuade them to move?The animatronic work in this movie is delightful, and the animals come across as definite individuals--even some of the sheep (and the dogs are right--domestic sheep are pretty brainless).  There's even a trio of mice who sing in falsetto!  I'm not sure where in the British Commonwealth the story is set (it was filmed in New Zealand), but even American viewers shouldn't have any trouble getting involved in it and understanding what's going on.

It has proved to be anything but a flash-in-the-pan. This movie will endure. It's also a beautiful film on DVD with brilliant colors and some very rich visuals. I can't wait for the high-def Blu-Ray to be made available.Filmed in rural Australia, the scenery is magnificent and so is the house that is featured in the film. It looks like some old-fashioned gingerbread house. The animals are entertaining, talking to one another like humans but not looking hokey in the process. In other words, the dubbing is well done.The main character, ""Babe,"" the little pig, is the nicest, most innocent ""character"" you could ever hope to find. Listening to him talk is heart-warming most of the time and sometimes it's heart-breaking. The best comic relief is provided by the goose who wants to be a rooster. That may sound like it's geared toward little kids, but it isn't. I haven't found an adult friend yet who didn't like this film.It also was good to see James Cromwell play a nice guy, too. Most other times he seems to play profane and corrupt cops or government officials. Here, he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings. His wife is a bit annoying, but not too bad.This is a wonderful, sweet-hearted comedy-drama with a nice ending, too, guaranteed to leave you with a smile or a tear, or both.

It is special in so many ways that I have to admit it is one of my favorite films.  My kids make fun of me for it, but I don't really care.I went to this movie in the theaters with no expectations beyond spending some time with my kids watching a goofy film.  And I have to admit that the first few minutes in the pig factory had me apprehensive about the motives of the film.  But when Hoggett (James Cromwell) and the pig regard each other at the fair, well, I started to be won over.  By the time Ferdinand the Duck crows like a rooster, I was with the movie 100%.  The whole look of the movie is unique.  The voices of the animals are all great and they are given fabulous lines.  Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski) is fab-u-lous as the silent farmer's ambitious and talkative wife.There are so many wonderful things about the movie that I cannot name them all, but when Hoggett sings and then dances(!) for Babe to try and inspire the recovery of the pig, well, that is a great scene of all time as far as I am concerned.  Magical.  How Cromwell created and embodied this character I will never understand.  Hoggett is a perfect character for the role he is playing as the man with the taciturn outside and the off the wall inside that can see the sheep pig where his wife sees only meals.  How many lessons for life are there in that?  They are hard to number.And who doesn't love Ferdinand leading Babe into the house to try and steal the alarm clock that Ferdinand sees as a threat to his life because it is a mechanical rooster.  Since he is a duck the farmer will eat he has become a rooster and now he won't even be needed as that.  The funniest bit is when, and you might miss it, all heck breaks loose later in the movie and Ferdinand says ""Rinnggg Rinnggg"" trying to be the mechanical rooster.And not enough good things can be said for the wonderful voice Christine Cavanaugh gives to Babe.

The video and audio quality are terrific.  Otherwise, the  &quot;no-widescreen&quot; decision doesn't make sense at all.Is this a  &quot;trend&quot; adopted by some home video divisions at the studios in  California to accommodate the still larger group of non-purists who prefer  seeing movies in the dumb pan and scan or what I laughably call the  &quot;HBO format?&quot;Go over to AMC and Turner Classic Movies on  cable and the trend over there, for people who are movie purists, is in a  completely opposite direction.  More of their films are being shown on  cable in the widescreen format.&quot;Babe&quot; is the second major  crtically acclaimed Universal studio release on DVD that is being offered  without the widescreen format.  The other, and you'll choke on this when  you hear this, is &quot;The Sting,&quot; the intricate &quot;con&quot; film  that WON the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.Even more puzzling  is Universal Studio's decision to release the sequel, &quot;Babe: A Pig in  the City,&quot; which was little seen in theaters, in full widescreen  format on DVD.Why widescreen on one and not the other?  I could  understand it if the studio released information indicating to consumers  that the awful 1:33:1 aspect ratio (the 35mm norm for nearly all films  released in the United States before 1953) was the original theatrical  issue, but I don't believe this was the case for 1995's masterful  &quot;Babe.&quot;Another atrocious miscue by another company, is being  commited by Fox Video for its DVD version of Alan Parker's gloriously  intoxicating film, &quot;The Commitments,&quot; another film that deserves  the widescreen treatment and not crummy pan and scan.Please, fellow  Amazonians out there, get on the bandwagon and clamor for the studios, at  the very least, to offer both formats on DVD, and not one at the exclusion  of the other!  This is the way most of the major DVD releases are done  right now anyway (widescreen on side A and pan and scan on side B).Perhaps Universal's handling of &quot;Babe&quot; was to cater to the  &quot;kiddie crowd.&quot;  But that's insulting if the film's popularity  hadn't crossed over to adults, it wouldn't have made as much money as it  did and just as important, it would not have been nominated for Best  Picture in 1995.But the lack of a widescreen DVD for &quot;Babe&quot;  is truly, truly a puzzle, a riddle, a baffling decision by Universal.  I  can think of no acceptable explanation other than they didn't want to spend  the money to treat one of its gems on DVD the way it treated it for the  currently available widescreen version of &quot;The Sting&quot; on VHS.

No, the original Babe's charm lies in the wonderful characterizations of Rex and Fly, the sweet yet prejudiced sheep dogs, lovable in nature, but with character flaws that make them as rich as any human character; it lies in the matter-of-fact Farmer Hoggett, played with sincerity and humour by James Cromwell; it lies in the impeccably tailored voice work, from the braying ewe Maa to the hilariously squeaky mice, the booming horse, and that oh-so-greasy cat; it lies in the beautifully rendered, pudgy voice work for Babe by Christine Cavanaugh, who was sorely missed in the second film; and it lies in the pure heart of moments like the slamming of the gate at the sheep dog trial at the end, Rex and Fly's endearing kiss against a soaring crane shot, the eerie dramatic irony of Babe facing Farmer Hoggett's rifle, and Fly's loss of her puppies.  And the film's famously ironic tone is the icing on the cake, spearheaded by a highly effective ""naive narrator"", which subverts the fairy-tale tone of the piece and adds dimensions that serve to add both humour and intellectual complexity to the story.This film was well deserving of its Best Picture and Best Screenplay Oscar nominations, a film smart enough for adults but joyful enough for children.",5,A top-notch movie that surpasses the children's milieu.,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,1675,"['Disappointed', 'Babe', 'Pig', 'City', 'went', 'back', 'watching', 'original', 'Ever', 'dozen', 'viewings', 'original', 'film', 'power', 'entertain', 'endear', 'raise', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'issues', 'uncommon', 'children', 'films.The', 'magic', 'was', 'details', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'production', 'design', 'busy', 'production', 'design', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'second', 'film', 'more', 'engaging', 'was', 'No', 'original', 'Babe', 'charm', 'wonderful', 'characterizations', 'Rex', 'Fly', 'sweet', 'yet', 'prejudiced', 'sheep', 'dogs', 'lovable', 'nature', 'character', 'flaws', 'make', 'as', 'rich', 'human', 'character', 'matter-of-fact', 'Farmer', 'Hoggett', 'played', 'sincerity', 'humour', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'impeccably', 'tailored', 'voice', 'work', 'braying', 'ewe', 'Maa', 'hilariously', 'squeaky', 'mice', 'booming', 'horse', 'oh-so-greasy', 'cat', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'pudgy', 'voice', 'work', 'Babe', 'Christine', 'Cavanaugh', 'who', 'was', 'sorely', 'missed', 'second', 'film', 'pure', 'heart', 'moments', 'slamming', 'gate', 'sheep', 'dog', 'trial', 'end', 'Rex', 'Fly', 'endearing', 'kiss', 'soaring', 'crane', 'shot', 'eerie', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'Babe', 'facing', 'Farmer', 'Hoggett', 'rifle', 'Fly', 'loss', 'puppies', 'film', 'famously', 'ironic', 'tone', 'icing', 'cake', 'spearheaded', 'highly', 'effective', 'naive', 'narrator', 'fairy-tale', 'tone', 'piece', 'dimensions', 'serve', 'add', 'humour', 'intellectual', 'complexity', 'story.This', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'deserving', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'smart', 'enough', 'adults', 'joyful', 'enough', 'children']",N/A

47712,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,0783219598,H. Snyder,"[0, 0]","Babe was a surprise contender for Best Picture in 1995. It has elements which make it sound like a formula for a cloyingly sweet kiddie film, namely talking animals, a pig that wants to be a sheepdog, singing mice, a farmer who seldom talks paired with a wife who seldom stops talking.  But the component parts were so skillfully crafted, so lovingly combined into a heart-warming and tear-inducing modern fairy tale, that they became a favorite movie for millions of people, a movie which will stand the test of time.The Blu-ray edition is an improvement over the DVD mostly because the resolution is increased for proper presentation on today's larger television screens. Fine detail is good but not spectacular, colors and contrasts are sharp.  The talking animals are consistently lifelike and smoothly believable.  Voice characterizations are remarkably well done, particularly Babe, the old sheep Maa, the sheepdogs Rex and Fly, and the self-described ""anorexic duck"" named Ferdinand.James Cromwell is Farmer Hoggett, who wins a piglet at the fair.  Because Hoggett is a man of very few words, playing the character made Cromwell worry that he wasn't really acting.  Director Chris Noonan assured him that he was doing more acting without words than most actors did with words, and his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor proved the point.The simple story is told with charm and emotion. The lyrically pastoral setting has at its center a farmhouse with an almost fantasy appearance, occupied by the farmer and his wife who are a comically matched pair of opposites.  And the animals are amazing, with the Jim Henson creatures being so lifelike that you have to watch the film two or three times to tell the mechanical creations from the live animals.Watch Babe with the kids.  Or maybe watch it on your own, so they don't see the moistening of your eyes when the little pig is told by the mean spirited cat that pigs are only kept by humans for use as food; or when Farmer Hoggett sings Babe out of his depression; or when the two of them together triumph at the sheepdog trials.

This is a fantastic movie, sure to delight children from 2-100.  Chris Noonan has created the modern farmyard parable.  He deftly brings you into his world of talking animals centered around that most amicable of pigs, Babe.  While the sheepdogs rule the farm, Babe warms the heart of sheep and dog alike, and eventually farmer Hoggett  much to the chagrin of his wife who is counting the days to the next big feast.  Ultimately Babe is spared as farmer Hoggett comes to realize he has a most unusual pig on his hands.  Babe finds himself welcomed into the fold, rising to the ultimately status of being able to come into the house on miserable nights, at the expense of the house cat.  All these animals are played wonderfully off each other.  The voices couldn't be better.  Farmer Hoggett eventually puts Babe to the ultimate challenge, the great sheepherding competition, which brings out a raucous reaction from the crowd.  But Babe soon silences them.

The farm animals speak to each other. The cat and dogs realize their value. The duck and pig are concerned that they have no role other than that of being eaten by humans.So the duck and pig each try nontraditional roles: The duck preempts the rooster in waking everybody up, and the pig makes friends with the sheep and makes them obey the pig's requests (not commands). Fearing that the ""mechanical rooster"" makes the duck superfluous, and liable to be eaten for a meal, the duck gets the pig to cooperate with him in the removal of the alarm clock from the farmer's house.The farmer gets to appreciate the pig more and more. The pig drives off a wolf attack on the sheep. The farmer decides to enter the pig in a sheep-dog contest, as there is nothing in the rules that explicitly says that the sheep-herding animal must necessarily be a dog. As he and the pig enter the field, the crowd roars in laughter and derision, thinking that he must be stark-raving mad, or some kind of practical joker.

I first saw in '95 in theater, then later on dvd (as bought here), but this blu is a revelation! Reference quality video (the outdoors especially, as filmed in South Wales, Australia). To sum up: I love a good movie, no matter age, genre, sound (or not), color (or not), or if in foreign tongue! I can't remember a film I've viewed a 3rd time, that I've had a smile on my face throughout! Simple, poignant storyline (as outlined elsewhere), oh-so-fine and subtle acting (esp. the human element!), a script that is clever w/o being syrupy nor condescending, absolutely gorgeous cinematography (jaw-dropping on blu), and a finale that is as near perfect in execution and subtle humor as I've ever seen (had to re-watch a few times, as I was laughing so hard! The editing and camera work alone ""worth the price of admission""). An eclectic film watcher, I watched this on heels of ""Sunset Boulevard"" (my all-around fave, from 1950), and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (bankheist caper, Pacino, 1972). 'Babe', however, I would highest-recommend for family viewing (and I do hate that designation, as it often equates to dumbed-down, trite and unimaginative fare, that is bottom-lined ""safe for all ages"").  ** I would NOT label this as a ""kids movie"": yes it is rated 'G' (eek!), but it is also incredibly nuanced. Just because it's makers could pull it off without inserting needless dreck does NOT mean it isn't intelligient enough for adults to appreciate.

The movie is targeted for young children, however, I found the references to slaughter too strong.  The story revolves around a runt pig named ""Babe.""  Her mother is sent to slaughter as soon as her piglets can be fed by machine.  Babe is only saved from her fate by being the runt and entered into a carnival contest of ""Guess the Weight?""  Farmer Hoggett guesses correctly and brings Babe home.  Farmer Hoggett and Babe seem to have a special connection as they size each other up.  Farmer Hoggett saves Babe's life at Christmas when he suggests to Mrs. Hoggett that they have duck instead of pig for Christmas dinner.  It should be noted that Babe is raised by ""Fly"" a mama sheep dog with a herd of puppies.  The father is tough ""Rex"" who is irritated that Fly takes such an interest in Babe.  After her puppies are sold by Farmer Hoggett Babe calls her ""Mom"" and this eases her sense of loss.  Mama dog gives Babe tips on sheepherding and Babe surprises everyone (except Farmer Hoggett) at the World Sheepherder's Contest.At any rate the movie is good, but somewhat dark.

The most notable feature of this film is personification of animals. Particularly, in the conversation of animals, a mouth moves. It supposed to be used special effects. It describes realistically like people&iexcl;s talking, by using the expression&iexcl;s changes as well. This film is based on the fairy tale, for that reason, a narrator appears and explains about the story during the film like an orally narrated fairy tale. In addition, it divides into several chapters, which is also like reading a fairy tale. And this film uses music quite appropriately, especially, when the incidents happen. For example, the music expresses the situation that makes tension or intimation. Interesting thing is the feature of animals, which are personified; they have a discipline in their own way like the human society. There is a leader who is a male sheepdog, named &iexcl;Rex&iexcl;. Like this, they are all like human. After Babe comes to the farm, it happens some chances that Babe break the rule. When he becomes a sheep-pig, he does not use his authority and threats to lamb like other sheepdogs, but he asks his favor to them politely. Finally, this film states humanity and morality. At the last happy ending scene, the bright sunlight talks this. As the whole, this seems to be like a fairy tale book, a farm, a hill and animals, all the background of this film are like one scene of the nursery story. The reason why this can be possible is the special effects. This film cannot be said except special effects, it is the most significant part of this work. For example, special effects are related to every animal&iexcl;s movement, features, expressions, in particular, when they have a conversation, the motion of their mouth and also singing mice. In fact, this film has a simple plot that one pig, named &iexcl;Babe&iexcl;, becomes a sheepdog and wins a first prize at the sheepdog contest.

I was admittedly surprised when I learned that James Cromwell, who played the farmer, Arthur Hoggett, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, but when I think back on the film, the nomination was well deserved.  Despite not having many lines throughout the film, Mr. Cromwell allowed his mere presence to do most of the talking, and through that, he spoke quite eloquently.  The rest of the cast, most of them voicing farm animals, made themselves similarly memorable in their own way.  Babe, the lead pig voiced by Christine Cavanaugh, had perhaps the greatest growth in the film (and not simply because he was the main character), allowing us to go with him on the journey where molded himself into his new, if unconventional, role.  Over a dozen other animals, including dogs, sheep, a horse, and a duck, supported or antagonized him throughout the plot, but you can't help but love them all...maybe it's their cuteness.

I also liked how each part of the movie had a title telling you what to expect.  And the singing mice...oh, they were so cute and funny!  I wish they would have shown more close-ups of them!Overall, though not worthy of an Academy Award, this is a great movie!  It was much better then I expected.  Some parts might disturb very small children, but other then that I think that this is a great family movie!

Kenneth Turan described it as ""the closest to perfection ever achieved in the making of a movie"". Dozens of other reviewers declared that it was the first time that a film from another producer had matched the charm and inspiration of the first Disney movies (Snow White, Pinocchio, etc.)This praise was wholeheartedly justified for a movie which deserves a place next to Disney's best and The Wizard of Oz among Hollywood's most beloved family perennials. What is truly marvelous is that the filmmakers had enough confidence in their story that they believe it can stand alone without the joke book jokes and phony Broadway type musical numbers that plague today's children's films. And that story concludes in a way so touching that it left tears in my eyes in a theater for the first time in my adult life.It was wonderful that it received a special effects Oscar, but it was a crime that one was not awarded to Christopher Noonan. His direction resulted in the staging of scenes of such charm and visual poetry that they, in their own sentimental way, leave images as memorable as those from Ford, Hitchcock and Scorsese.This is the first movie that my wife and I ever saw together, and I regard it as a once in a generation film that can create an atmosphere of love for anyone seeing it together.(You will see a lot of reviews here with complaints about the advertising content of earlier DVD packages from Universal.

The movie tells the story of an innocent piglet who befriends animals on a farm and becomes especially close to a sheepdog named Fly. With Fly's help and all of the animals on the farm, Babe enters a sheepherding competition. Will Babe win the competition even though he is just a piglet? Watch the movie for yourself! I liked this movie a lot because all of the animals are great actors and have personalities similar to people. At times I wondered if the animals were just extremely well-trained or if the use of animatronics was this effective. The dubbing was also wonderful. The format the movie uses to tell the story is like a children's storybook, with each chapter telling an interesting story with a moral. The movie is also well directed. I especially liked the scene where Babe is trying to steal the farmer's alarm clock because director Chris Noonan used suspenseful music to make the audience more anticipated. I recommend this movie to children ages 4 and up because very little kids will still be able to enjoy it. The movie delivers a positive message that you can do anything despite your appearance.

47764,A2VODABWSVHV8E,0783219598,"Ray ""A Reader""","[2, 2]","Is it pointless to write a review on a movie that was produced 15 years ago? Or that was nominated for a slew of Oscar awards, and has therefore already generated a litany of viewer reviews covering every aspect of the movie? Or whose simplicity belies a richness and intricacy that defies simple explanation? Indeed, it probably is. But as we approach the two-decade mark since Babe was released, I'd nevertheless like to take a moment to write just why this movie is one of the most powerful and touching I've ever seen.Babe is thought of as a kid's movie, and, in some ways, it is. But it's a mistake to sum this work up as solely a kid's movie. This is a movie that strikes deep into the soul and heart of the viewer, one that pricks at some of the basic undercurrents of life itself, and forces one to rethink these deep issues through the lens of innocence, honesty, and curiosity. Yes, it's delightful; yes, its funny; indeed, its charming. But it is far more than that. This work deeply challenges us to think about ""the way things are,"" and brings forth some of the realities of life in a way that few movies ever do. Yes, kids can watch this and enjoy it from beginning to end. But virtually any adult should be able to see within its first five minutes that this is not your typical movie ""fare"" - kid or otherwise - and that the story has an emotive power and subtext that is both completely unexpected and incredibly rich.The story in Babe is straightforward. A pig ends up on a farm, tries to figure out his ""place"" on that farm, eventually discovers that he, too, has a place there, in spite of his own fears that he might not. Oh, yes, and he's a talented creature, too. That's about it.Actually, that's the main storyline that supports a magical world of powerful, emotional, and thought-provoking events, a laboratory test tube of the greater world that has more the trappings of a gilded box than a rabbit's cage. But even the entertaining and unusual events of the movie are only the setting for the more important themes of the storyline.  Throughout of the story, Babe is faced with a series of realities that challenge his innocence at every turn and threaten to change his sweet nature into a cynical outlook towards all things human and animal.  Repeatedly, the pig must make a choice between trust and bitterness as his knowledge of his world expands. He is enticed by a duck trying to rescue his own life through a criminal act; is tormented by a self-serving cat undertaking revenge; and is threatened by a mean-spirited, jealous dog who is living with a life disappointment that colors his daily experience.Babe is befriended by a man, a quiet and diminutive sheep-herder farmer, an unexceptional person who nonetheless somehow senses something unusual about this pig. The sheep-herder-farmer becomes the laughing stock of his friends, family, and community, but is nonetheless undeterred via a ""common sense of destiny."" That destiny is threatened throughout the story, but although recognized only by Babe and the farmer, that destiny is seen by both through to the end, and we are all the wiser in seeing them do so.So what is ""Babe"" about? It is about innocence, openness, prejudice, kindness, belief, fairness, and acceptance. But it is about more than that. It is also about sadness, tragedy, endurance, and guilt. It's about ""the way things are."" And the way that, perhaps, things should be.So, let the kids watch it and enjoy, and enjoy they will. The talking animals, the cuteness of the characters, and the gorgeously played and recorded music is a delightful romp through a magical world of enchanted reality. But as you watch it yourself, be drawn into the thought and reflection surrounding the messages of the film, and reflect on what it means. You'll find it is not a simple, cute movie at all: it's the deepest of examinations of human experience masquerading as kids' entertainment. You'll thoroughly enjoy it, but I assure you, it won't end there.",5,One of the Rarest of Movies,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,3995,"['pointless', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'nominated', 'slew', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'therefore', 'already', 'generated', 'litany', 'viewer', 'reviews', 'covering', 'aspect', 'movie', 'simplicity', 'richness', 'intricacy', 'simple', 'explanation', 'Indeed', 'probably', 'approach', 'two-decade', 'mark', 'Babe', 'was', 'released', ""'d"", 'nevertheless', 'take', 'moment', 'write', 'just', 'why', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'touching', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Babe', 'thought', 'kid', 'movie', 'ways', 'mistake', 'sum', 'work', 'up', 'as', 'solely', 'kid', 'movie', 'movie', 'deep', 'soul', 'heart', 'viewer', 'one', 'basic', 'undercurrents', 'life', 'one', 'rethink', 'deep', 'issues', 'lens', 'innocence', 'honesty', 'curiosity', 'Yes', 'delightful', 'yes', 'funny', 'indeed', 'charming', 'far', 'more', 'work', 'deeply', 'think', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'forth', 'realities', 'life', 'way', 'few', 'movies', 'ever', 'do', 'Yes', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'beginning', 'end', 'virtually', 'adult', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'not', 'typical', 'movie', 'fare', 'kid', 'otherwise', 'story', 'emotive', 'power', 'subtext', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'incredibly', 'rich.The', 'story', 'Babe', 'straightforward', 'pig', 'up', 'farm', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'place', 'farm', 'eventually', 'too', 'place', 'there', 'spite', 'own', 'fears', 'might', 'not', 'Oh', 'yes', 'talented', 'creature', 'too', 'about', 'it.Actually', 'main', 'storyline', 'magical', 'world', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'thought-provoking', 'events', 'laboratory', 'test', 'tube', 'greater', 'world', 'more', 'trappings', 'gilded', 'box', 'rabbit', 'cage', 'even', 'entertaining', 'unusual', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'setting', 'more', 'important', 'themes', 'storyline', 'story', 'Babe', 'faced', 'series', 'realities', 'challenge', 'innocence', 'turn', 'threaten', 'change', 'sweet', 'nature', 'cynical', 'outlook', 'things', 'human', 'animal', 'Repeatedly', 'pig', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'trust', 'bitterness', 'knowledge', 'world', 'enticed', 'duck', 'trying', 'rescue', 'own', 'life', 'criminal', 'act', 'tormented', 'self-serving', 'cat', 'undertaking', 'revenge', 'threatened', 'mean-spirited', 'jealous', 'dog', 'who', 'living', 'life', 'disappointment', 'colors', 'daily', 'experience.Babe', 'befriended', 'man', 'quiet', 'diminutive', 'sheep-herder', 'farmer', 'unexceptional', 'person', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'somehow', 'senses', 'something', 'unusual', 'pig', 'sheep-herder-farmer', 'laughing', 'stock', 'friends', 'family', 'community', 'nonetheless', 'undeterred', 'common', 'sense', 'destiny', 'destiny', 'threatened', 'story', 'recognized', 'only', 'Babe', 'farmer', 'destiny', 'seen', 'end', 'are', 'wiser', 'seeing', 'do', 'so.So', 'what', 'Babe', 'innocence', 'openness', 'prejudice', 'kindness', 'belief', 'fairness', 'acceptance', 'more', 'also', 'about', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'endurance', 'guilt', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'perhaps', 'things', 'should', 'be.So', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'enjoy', 'will', 'talking', 'animals', 'cuteness', 'characters', 'gorgeously', 'played', 'recorded', 'music', 'delightful', 'romp', 'magical', 'world', 'enchanted', 'reality', 'watch', 'be', 'drawn', 'thought', 'reflection', 'surrounding', 'messages', 'film', 'reflect', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'not', 'simple', 'cute', 'movie', 'deepest', 'examinations', 'human', 'experience', 'masquerading', 'kids', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'assure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'there']",N/A

I rue that decision now, for I missed the chance to share it firsthand with dozens of undoubtedly delighted families. As the critics have duly noted, this movie is already a classic in every sense of the word. Far better than ""Charlotte's Web"" and indeed all the other ""animal"" films, it has inaugurated a cinematic genre. Neither the brooding parody of Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" nor the frivolous antics of Looney Tunes, ""Babe"" has shown that it is possible to entertain with animals while making one think about the unavoidable lessons of life. This movie succeeds on so many levels, as its many Oscar nominations indicated, that one has to believe that creative genius was behind it. The screenplay is accessible to children yet retains moments of adult wit reminiscent of ""Peanuts."" This careful use of language to convey simple truths may explain some of the film's broad appeal. But its heart-warming, life-affirming message, delivered as it is by the most unassuming of characters--a pig--explains the rest. If you've been hesitant like me to even watch, much less buy this film, do yourself a favor and rush out to rent it. (Indeed it has almost made me into a vegetarian, but that's another story).

And even the adults (me included) will find a box of tissues very handy.  The floodgates open every time I see it.  But nothing here is heavy-handed tragedy a la ""Old Yeller"" or ""The Yearling"".  And certainly none of the war and gore of ""Watership Down""--which is not for children at all.  This is ""G"" rated with all that the rating implies.So,  grab your family,  or watch it with your adult friends.  You can't go wrong with this fine example of cinematic magic and sheer joyousness. Can't wait for the BluRay!

The reason I buy DVDs is because of the superior picture, but one of the reasons DVD is superior is the fact that you can see the full--i.e., letterboxed--picture. This DVD chops off each side of one of the most visually beautiful films made in recent cinema. This decision was just a dreadful mistake. This is a film I would purchase on DVD if only it were available in letterboxed format.Still, I give BABE five stars because the film itself is just so delightful. I think most viewers focus on the story, and I am enough of a kid that I enjoyed it thoroughly. But other things seem to get overlooked. The human performances are just as charming as the animals, and if Magda Szubanski and James Cromwell (who received a well deserved Oscar nomination for his role as Farmer Hoggett) hadn't been so superb, the movie would have been nothing but a technical display. The art direction for this movie doesn't get the praise it deserves, probably because people perceive it to be a kid's film. But very, very few films look this good; the art directors created a unique, beautiful, and magical looking world.Interestingly, the person who did the voice for Babe is Christine Cavanaugh, who does the voice of Chuckie on Rugrats. The voice for Babe in BABE: PIG IN THE CITY was done by Elizabeth Daily, who does the voice of Tommy Pickles on Rugrats. Keeping it in the family. The voice of Rex, the Sheepdog, was by Hugo Weaving, who played the main Agent in THE MATRIX and Elrond in THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.",5,Five stars despite the fact that the DVD is Fullscreen only,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,1716,"['have', 'idea', 'what', 'corporate', 'dolt', 'made', 'decision', 'not', 'release', 'film', 'letterbox', 'edition', 'utterly', 'DVD', 'version', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'superior', 'picture', 'one', 'reasons', 'DVD', 'superior', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'full', 'i.e.', 'letterboxed', 'picture', 'DVD', 'side', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'films', 'made', 'recent', 'cinema', 'decision', 'was', 'just', 'dreadful', 'mistake', 'film', 'would', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'only', 'were', 'available', 'letterboxed', 'format.Still', 'give', 'BABE', 'five', 'stars', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'delightful', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'focus', 'story', 'am', 'enough', 'kid', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'other', 'things', 'seem', 'get', 'overlooked', 'human', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'charming', 'animals', 'Magda', 'Szubanski', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'who', 'received', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Farmer', 'Hoggett', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'superb', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'technical', 'display', 'art', 'direction', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'praise', 'probably', 'people', 'perceive', 'be', 'kid', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'look', 'good', 'art', 'directors', 'created', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'looking', 'world.Interestingly', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'Babe', 'Christine', 'Cavanaugh', 'who', 'voice', 'Chuckie', 'Rugrats', 'voice', 'Babe', 'BABE', 'PIG', 'THE', 'CITY', 'was', 'done', 'Elizabeth', 'Daily', 'who', 'voice', 'Tommy', 'Pickles', 'Rugrats', 'Keeping', 'family', 'voice', 'Rex', 'Sheepdog', 'was', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'Agent', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'Elrond', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'FELLOWSHIP', 'THE', 'RING']",N/A

I had seen the trailers, and they looked cute, but if I hadn't gotten the free passes, I might have skipped over this gem. This is far more than a  children's movie.The voice of the pig is absolutely perfect... sweet,  innocent and believable. Babe's tender heart will remind you of Wilbur from  E.B. White's &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; but this is a story in its own  right... and there is no talking spider.James Cromwell received an Oscar  nomination for his role as Farmer Hoggett, a sweet, somewhat hen-pecked  sheep farmer who wins the piglet as a prize in a county fair.Babe is a  lonely little piglet... he's had to say goodbye to his siblings and his  mother at a tender age and is thrust into a barn with all sorts of strange  animals he's never seen before. All of the animals, dogs, horses, the cows,  etc. feel sorry for Babe and look out for him. There is rivalry with the  top Border Collie, but Babe's sweet and innocent disposition wins the  hearts of all reluctant farm dwellers.The farmer's wife initially sees  Babe as just a ham on legs, but the farmer sees more and finds a friend  that changes his life.It is impossible to see this film and not get at  least a lump in your throat and many scenes will make you laugh outloud. I  wish the DVD included more features, like a behind-the-scenes featurette  outlining how they got the animatronics (which won a much deserved Oscar)  to work. Perhaps it was felt that children would be dismayed that the pig  really can't talk or that it took nearly 30 pigs to make the film due to  the speed in which they grow into 1-ton hogs... I'm not sure, but as an  adult, i would have enjoyed seeing more features on the DVD.

I often wondered how long it took to teach Mister Ed to just move his lips? The voice man stood in the wings and through his voice. Finally, this little gem came along. I never thought they could pull it off technically and visually adding voice and mouth movement to the animals. And the animals acted so well. Just as convincing as their human counterparts. 'Babe' was such a hit in 1995 that it was nominated in five categories and won one for the visual effects. A very worthy and well-deserved win. 'Babe' can be enjoyed by everyone young and old. I would recommended it as one of my top favorite children's film. As with some fate, Babe is saved from an unfortunate destiny, where all pigs must go. Babe and Farmer Hoggett paths cross at a country fair. Hoggett and Babe from that moment something passed between them. Hoggett guesses the weight of the little pig in a contest. Later that that week, Hoggett is notified as the winner. It's when Hoggett brings Babe to his new home, Babe meets a menagarie of farm animals that take a liking to their new addition to the Hoggett farm. Babe is adopted by Fly, an Australian border collie. Babe makes friends with a duck who thinks he's a rooster as cover from being a main course for Christmas dinner. Babe also makes friends with an ailing old ewe, Ma.One day, Farmer Hoggett allows Babe to accompany him and the sheepdogs in the fields where the sheep grazed. There Fly teaches Babe the art of being a sheep-pig. But, Babe also learns another valuable lesson in tending sheep. It's a test if Babe is cutout to be a good sheep-pig. With Ma's help the sheep co-operate with Babe. To Farmer Hoggett's amazement in Babe's special gift he enters Babe in annual sheepherding trials. In due time, Babe is put through the practice and confronts wolves who kill one of the sheep. Farmer Hoggett thinking Babe killed one of the sheep. Does it mean the death sentence for poor Babe? But Fly comes to Babe's rescue and saves the day for Babe. There's the jealous, bad cat out to get Babe when she snidely tells Babe of the pig's true purpose. Babe thinking that the Boss would in time eat him, Babe goes to Fly and ask if it were true. When Fly tells Babe the truth, Babe runs away in the rainy night. Next day, Fly and Farmer Hoggett find Babe taken by the cold rain and Hoggett nursed him back to health. Then the big day come and Hoggett and Babe go to the trials with a little surprise for the judges. Can Babe the sheep-pig prove himself good and be the next sheepherding champ? Bet you know the answer already. I'd recommend Babe to anyone of all ages, especially to parents with small children. It's a darling, captivating tale with a lesson for all. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something, until you prove them wrong.

While the Dolby Digital soundtrack (in English language) is clearly inferior to the DTS sound of this DVD here (the only time so far I've actually been able to determine an audible difference between DTS and DD 5.1), it needs to be said that the picture composition of this release does suffer from the pan&amp;scan 4:3 transfer.

It is a story about Babe, a pig who is raised by sheepdogs, and learns to herd sheep, with a little help from Farmer Hoggett, played by James Cromwell.I have never been able to forget that mean cat in this movie who said to Babe, ""You don't have a purpose.""Worse than that? The look on Babe's face when she realized she had no purpose - that was a killer. Babe was perfectly happy before being asked that question but suddenly was so deflated. That cat was really a rotten cat! Or was she? Maybe Babe needed this incident, cruel as it was, to make her desire a purpose!There is a wonderful barnyard filled with animals, all with a purpose. All delightful. Do you remember James Cromwell, the farmer?I am writing a story on Finding Your Purpose and using the song James Cromwell sang . . . If I Had Words. I think seeing this scene reminds me of how excited GOD might have been right after he created Adam. Having foreknowledge does not mean you can't be happy and excited (in the moment) when something wonderful happens.  Cromwell has dust on his finger nails from working on the farm; the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground so would he have had dust on his fingernails?  Imagine that!This movie, aside from entertaining, made me think a lot about having a purpose and what my purpose was. What a great teaching tool that was for me! Everyone is born with a purpose and gifted for that purpose from his or her mother's womb. We often miss it but we wander around a lifetime until we find it - that is,  if we keep seeking for happiness and being fully alive.God gave Adam a purpose right off - he gives us all a purpose built in - a chip?  maybe in the soul?  maybe?  But he gave us a purpose and will have given us the gifts to fulfill that purpose.  We should all look for that purpose!One day, maybe today,  he will rejoice over us with singing -  Zephaniah 3:17 The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you* in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.Surely he will when we find our purpose and use it.Go track down If I Had Words and be entertained by James Cromwell.",5,You Don't Have a Purpose - or do you?,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2283,"['Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'called', 'BABE', 'Maybe', '15', 'years', 'so', 'ago', 'story', 'Babe', 'pig', 'who', 'raised', 'sheepdogs', 'herd', 'sheep', 'little', 'help', 'Farmer', 'Hoggett', 'played', 'James', 'Cromwell.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'forget', 'mean', 'cat', 'movie', 'who', 'said', 'Babe', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'purpose', 'Worse', 'look', 'Babe', 'face', 'when', 'realized', 'had', 'purpose', 'was', 'killer', 'Babe', 'was', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'being', 'asked', 'question', 'suddenly', 'was', 'so', 'deflated', 'cat', 'was', 'really', 'rotten', 'cat', 'was', 'Maybe', 'Babe', 'needed', 'incident', 'cruel', 'was', 'make', 'desire', 'purpose', 'wonderful', 'barnyard', 'filled', 'animals', 'purpose', 'delightful', 'Do', 'remember', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'farmer', 'am', 'writing', 'story', 'Finding', 'Purpose', 'using', 'song', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'sang', 'Had', 'Words', 'think', 'seeing', 'scene', 'how', 'excited', 'GOD', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'created', 'Adam', 'Having', 'foreknowledge', 'not', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'excited', 'moment', 'when', 'something', 'wonderful', 'happens', 'Cromwell', 'dust', 'finger', 'nails', 'working', 'farm', 'LORD', 'God', 'formed', 'man', 'dust', 'ground', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'dust', 'fingernails', 'Imagine', 'movie', 'aside', 'entertaining', 'made', 'think', 'lot', 'having', 'purpose', 'what', 'purpose', 'was', 'What', 'great', 'teaching', 'tool', 'was', 'Everyone', 'born', 'purpose', 'gifted', 'purpose', 'mother', 'womb', 'often', 'miss', 'wander', 'lifetime', 'find', 'keep', 'seeking', 'happiness', 'being', 'fully', 'alive.God', 'gave', 'Adam', 'purpose', 'right', 'off', 'purpose', 'built', 'chip', 'maybe', 'soul', 'maybe', 'gave', 'purpose', 'will', 'have', 'given', 'gifts', 'fulfill', 'purpose', 'should', 'look', 'purpose', 'One', 'day', 'maybe', 'today', 'will', 'rejoice', 'singing', '3:17', 'LORD', 'God', 'midst', 'warrior', 'who', 'victory', 'will', 'rejoice', 'gladness', 'will', 'renew', 'you*', 'love', 'will', 'exult', 'loud', 'singing', 'day', 'festival.Surely', 'will', 'when', 'find', 'purpose', 'use', 'it.Go', 'track', 'Had', 'Words', 'be', 'entertained', 'James', 'Cromwell']",N/A

Having lived in a pen most of his young life, the pig (christened Babe) must quickly acclimate to life with other animals.  After viewing the sheep dogs and their respected place in the eyes of Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), Babe sets out on an unlikely quest to become a sheep-herder of his own.For kids, ""Babe"" will enthrall in nearly every scene.  There is oddball humor (always a favorite for the youngsters), crazy sight gags, and enough emotional moments to even make the kiddies care about little Babe.For adults, the film does juuuust enough to keep you interested.  Cromwell's performance as the farmer is very nuanced, while the overall farming atmosphere will appeal to many older viewers.Overall, then, I consider Babe to be a solid children's effort.
