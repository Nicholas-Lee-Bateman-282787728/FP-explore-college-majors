Hall-of-Famer Melinda Dillon desperately tries to hold the family together in the wake of dad's inebriated rampages.The film is pretty good (if vaguely TV-movie-ish), particularly when Martin Sheen tells his son that he's going into a bar to meet a buddy, and comes out six hours later! Was the &quot;buddy&quot; named Jack Daniels?However, I did resent watching the movie a bit--I sat next to the class cutie, and we'd struck up a nice little in-class friendship. So for three days, the lights were off and we weren't allowed to talk. Thanks a lot!Even so, it definitely opened up an important discussion about alcoholism.

Especially the younger boy because when the father gets into those drunken rages,he'll run and hide under his bed!

Ward ""horror and sci-fi fan..""","[6, 7]","although a bit dated (film made in '86)..the movie depicts very clearly what it is like to be an active alcoholic, and what that does to a person's family.  We see the legal problems, the work problems, the family problems that are caused because of someone's drinking.Also shown is the co-dependency of several family members, as they make excuses for and cover-up the father's behavior.  We see the verbal and physical abuse they have to endure.I found it very difficult to watch...had to hit pause and come back later and watch more of the film, a segment here, a segment there.  It's a very sad film, but an accurate one.

306382,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,6302296927,JJ,"[0, 0]","This movie is very realistic and should be seen by the families of alcoholics. Martin Sheen does an excellent job of the typical addict who blames everything on his problems, on his family, willing to sacrifice his son so that he won't have to take the blame for his drunkeness.  This is a man who is accustomed to getting away with anything because of his charm.  In court he even tries to charm the judge into believing his crap about their being nothing wrong with his family.  Needless to say, the judge isn't buying it. It's the best film I've ever seen that tells the truth about how a family can enable an alcoholic.  In a brief scene that you might miss, it is mentioned that the wife's father was an alcoholic. She is willing to protect her husband to the point of betraying her own son and it's hearbreaking.  The youngest boy staying under the bed all the time is a true picture of what life is like for a child in such a family.  All through the movie you see the daughter trying to take care of her father and make excuses for him as she sees her mother doing. She also tries to take care of the cooking, the housecleaning and the care of the other children. This happens to the point where the daughter is actually jealous of her mother when she finally steps up and starts taking care of things herself.  It is right there for anyone to see that the daughter will grow up to marry an alcoholic and the whole tragedy will continue. Even at the end you never really believe that the father is actually admitting to himself that he is an alcoholic.  He does enough to get his life back but you have the feeling that it won't last. And, you are never really sure that the wife has actually had enough and wont put up with it anymore.  She is as much an addict as he is but she is addicted to her role as he is to alcohol.  You can imagine the years of therapy it will take for the whole family and how futile it probably will be.  I'd love to have seen a follow up of this story in another movie. This is really a true story of what it looks like inside the family of an alcoholic.
