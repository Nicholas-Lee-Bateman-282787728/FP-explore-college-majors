453286,A22JR9ROYRPN7P,6305178429,ANAN KHALIQUE,"[0, 0]","This is a re-release of the VHS that was originally released in 1998. There are no extra features.These are not full matches. But the highlights cover the best parts of the matches. The highlights are accompanied by background music and sometimes, commentary. Before and after each match, there is a small narration by a voice that sounds very similar to Freddy Blassie so he could be the one who's doing it.Not only do the narrations fit well (they chose the right words), but they placed each narration where it fits perfectly. They are accompanied by an underscore of Taker's Volume 3 theme. The underscore makes that theme more iconic than it already is.The intro is one of the best intros I have ever seen in my life. And believe me, that is no exaggeration. It has a narration with an underscore of Taker's theme in the background. But after the narration, the underscore cut to the original version of Taker's theme. I'm not sure of this was his actual titantron at the time or not, but one amazing sight is the few shots shown of the individuals performing Taker's theme.After talking about each match, I will talk a bit about the BGM that is heard during the matches.Summerslam 96Taker and Mankind had one of the  best feuds in history back in 96, And this first ever Boiler Room Brawl match was part of of it. These two men battered each other with any object they got their hands on. It was amazing how they were able to stand, let alone walk from the Boiler Room to the ring. The clear winner was screwed via a very unexpected, shocking and bitter betrayal.BGM: Music was perfect. When Taker asked for the Urn, Paul turned his back & I saw a look in Taker's face and especially his eyes that I haven't seen before. His face & the background music together..it actually feel sorry for him because after all he went through, he was betrayed. The music used here was also used in The Best Of Survivor Series to highlight Bret's match with Backlund at Survivor Series 94.In Your House: Buried AliveAnother brawl. But objects were not used as much here as they were at Summerslam. Taker was stalking Paul, but turned and got a chair shot from Mankind who later on hit a piledriver on Taker on a chair. But Taker sat up, nailed Mankind in the back with the chair & then he placed the chair on Mankind and hit a legdrop. The Executioner debuted nailing Taker in the back of the head with a shovel & he and Mankind buried Taker. But after a lighting bolt struck, Taker's hand rose from the grave.BGM: Great music. Also used for HBK's Road To WM14 video package that they aired on RAW in 1998.In Your House: Badd BloodThe iconic, history making match. Hell In A Cell #1, a match which Taker himself has stated is his favorite. I can see why despite the fact that he lost. This is one of those matches where you have to see it who know why it's so great because people's opinions won't do the match any justice. The same can be said for the other Hell In A Cell match that will be highlighted here later on.BGM: One of my favorites. It was the same one used for the Royal Rumble 98 intro.Royal Rumble 1998The Casket Match that either caused the injury to HBK's back or just added fuel to the fire so to speak. In any case, it was a great match from these two. I love how unlike the Hell In A Cell match, this highlight has very little commentary. Don't get me wrong. The commentary in 98 was the best. But sometimes, it's nice to watch a match with everything (Music, crowd noise, etc) but the commentary. Kane appeared in the end.BGM: One of the best I've ever heard.Wrestlemania 14An all out physical war between two brothers with supernatural power. This has several months of build up, something rarely if ever, seen these days. Kane did what no one else has been able to - kick out of 2 Tombstone Piledrivers. Taker did kick out of Kane's though also. Taker missing the dive and crashing through the Spanish announce table was another highlight.BGM: They chose a great one here.Unforgiven 98The first ever Inferno Match. This is a match that was rarely seen just like the Buried Alive match. With WWE's current PG direction, I doubt we will see another Inferno match. The last was seen at Armageddon 2006 when Kane faced and defeated MVP. Out of all the Inferno matches, the first is still the best. Taker launching himself like a missile over the flames is a spectacular sight to see. Another great sight is when Taker walked the ropes & performed Old School while the flames went up. They also went up when Taker superplexed Kane, when Taker tried to leave the ring after tossing Kane to the outside (this was before he hit the Missile like suicide dive), and when they chokeslammed each other.BGM: I remember this highlight having two BGM's, not one. I think the second one started when Taker chokeslammed Kane. They were both great. They made the right choice in the second BGM because it fit Taker's suicide dive as well as JR's commentary while the move was being done.KOTR 98Not only is it an iconic match, it is an historical match. Perhaps more so than the first Hell In A Cell match. Like the first one, hearing or reading opinions and thoughts does not do this match justice. You have to see it. The King & JR's every word following the match really spoke volumes and just added this match even more.BGM: This also had more than one and while they were all good, I liked the one heard after the match the best because it fits JR & King's words well.There was another KOTR 98 highlight. It was the closing moments of The Austin/Kane WWF Title match where Taker hit Austin with a chair. The BGM was an underscore of Taker's theme. They seriously need to release an underscore of this theme!Summerslam 98A classic bout that emanated from the hallowed halls of MSG. Taker kept his word, doing everything he said he would. But thanks to a low blow, Austin retained the WWF Title. But just barely. If you saw the post0match interview with Austin, he'll pretty much confirm that himself.BGM: Great music. The one heard after the match as Taker is handing the belt to Austin really made that moment more special.IYH: Break-DownThis is the only highlight on the entire DVD not to have BGM. This was more or less a handicap match even though King constantly said this favored Austin in classic heel fashion. Taker & Kane turned on each other at certain times. But in the end, a double chokeslam from the two brothers caused Austin to lose the WWF Title.IYH: Judgment DayThe vacant WWF Title was on the line as both brothers waged war against each other. And Austin was the guest referee! In typical Stone Cold fashion, he let them do whatever they wanted. They did attack Austin too by the way. At one point, Austin fast counted Kane's pin, but would not count Taker's at all. In the end, Paul Bearer came out with a chair and struck Kane, who was then nailed again by a chairshot from The Undertaker.BGM: To me, the music heard while they made their entrances is a fantastic choice because I felt it fit their entrances best here. It's the same one heard in the KOTR 98 highlight after Taker pinned Mankind. The BGM for the match fit too. It was rock music & it worked well because it was a war between these two, a slugfest as JR or King called it.What followed was Taker's theme (not the underscore this time) and he and Paul Bearer making their way into the ring athe following Monday night on RAW. Words of the promo Taker gave on this night are heard as well. The one where he said that he would unleash a plague that the WWF has never seen and those who did not declare would be declared. And then there were various words which described Taker or the essence of Taker. Words were provided by the man who did all the narrations along with a female. As I said above, the narrator's voice sounds like Blassie's and the female sounds like Stephanie Mcmahon. The closing shot is one that is shown all the time so everyone must have seen it by now. It's the shot of a gravestone with a big white moon in the sky.Despite no special features or full length matches, this is as epic as epic can get.",5,A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF THE DARK SIDE,1330300800,"02
