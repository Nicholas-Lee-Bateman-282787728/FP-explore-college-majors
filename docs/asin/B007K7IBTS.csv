The plot is pretty in-depth with action, hand to hand combat, sword wielding, special ability fighters.

1532642,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B007K7IBTS,Coulter Rail,"[1, 3]","I looked at reviews and watched a clip online before buying. The reviews were either glowing with no gripes (which isn't the best indicator of real quality), or the gripes that were voiced had to do with the storyline being borrowed from X-Men, which I was sure I could get past (or so I thought).***PROS***ANIMATIONVery fluid, like they had a feature-film budget. The opening scene is mind-blowing. (This was the clip I came across on the net and bought the series with the quickness after viewing.) The fighting choreography is fast-paced and inventive. The powers the characters possess are not original by any means, but the choreography employs them in a graceful and effective way.MUSICWhile not abundant in variety, the music is powerful and driving. It helps the show reach for epic.That is all.***CONS***STORYIt's X-Men. There are kids with special abilities. The mean old authorities have it out for them. The main character owns a secret refuge where they can learn to control their powers and dodge prejudice. The episodes are only six in number, but each is longer than the norm. As a result, the narrative drags to a crawl. The storyline is two-dimensional and for kids. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if this is for children, then why the stellar animation and blood? Blood and gore are abundant, but the adult nature of the action seems out of place for a story that is open and shut, basic.CHARACTERSThese characters are pieced together from successful animes and formulas, and delivered unsuccessfully. *SPOILER - BUT NOT REALLY* When a cool bad guy with white hair and an attitude shows up, you know he's going to be part of the good team (Vegeta/Green Ranger syndrome). The good guy (Quan) has a past: He was brutal, but now he's nice and wears a girl's hair band so, okay. He also can't be killed (ingenious) and takes tons of damage hoping the audience feels for him. He'll heal. Who cares? There's a cool girl who cares but doesn't let people get too close. There's a kid with a beanie who pretends everything is lame but has the biggest heart of all. All the other kids with abilities cry ""They don't understand me!"" while causing a ruckus until Quan shows up to say ""We're in this together.""  Then they stop and smile. The finales are a jumble of fantastic action sequences and floating, nude characters touching fingers in a blinding limbo to attain POWER THAT CAN'T BE BEAT! I've seen it too much.In summation, this show has some noteworthy battles and beautiful animation, but the storyline demands patience while offering nothing new. I will say that kids haven't seen everything under the sun yet and might enjoy it. Fans of art, choreography, and animation quality are invited to watch it through once to admire some masters at work, but don't stay for the story; it falls victim to repetitive mediocrity fast. It just doesn't hold up well with all the good stuff out there, and that's a shame.I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",3,A Visual Treat to Watch but an Unoriginal Chore to Entertain,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,3109,"['looked', 'reviews', 'watched', 'clip', 'online', 'buying', 'reviews', 'were', 'either', 'glowing', 'gripes', ""n't"", 'best', 'indicator', 'real', 'quality', 'gripes', 'were', 'voiced', 'had', 'do', 'storyline', 'being', 'borrowed', 'X-Men', 'was', 'sure', 'could', 'get', 'past', 'so', 'thought', '***PROS***ANIMATIONVery', 'fluid', 'had', 'feature-film', 'budget', 'opening', 'scene', 'mind-blowing', 'was', 'clip', 'came', 'net', 'bought', 'series', 'quickness', 'viewing', 'fighting', 'choreography', 'fast-paced', 'inventive', 'powers', 'characters', 'possess', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'means', 'choreography', 'graceful', 'effective', 'way.MUSICWhile', 'not', 'abundant', 'variety', 'music', 'powerful', 'driving', 'show', 'reach', 'epic.That', '***CONS***STORYIt', 'X-Men', 'are', 'kids', 'special', 'abilities', 'mean', 'old', 'authorities', 'have', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'secret', 'refuge', 'where', 'can', 'learn', 'control', 'powers', 'dodge', 'prejudice', 'episodes', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'number', 'longer', 'norm', 'result', 'narrative', 'drags', 'crawl', 'storyline', 'two-dimensional', 'kids', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'children', 'then', 'why', 'stellar', 'animation', 'blood', 'Blood', 'gore', 'are', 'abundant', 'adult', 'nature', 'action', 'place', 'story', 'open', 'shut', 'basic.CHARACTERSThese', 'characters', 'are', 'pieced', 'together', 'successful', 'animes', 'formulas', 'delivered', 'unsuccessfully', '*SPOILER', 'BUT', 'NOT', 'REALLY*', 'When', 'cool', 'bad', 'guy', 'white', 'hair', 'attitude', 'up', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'part', 'good', 'team', 'Vegeta/Green', 'Ranger', 'syndrome', 'good', 'guy', 'Quan', 'past', 'was', 'brutal', 'now', 'nice', 'girl', 'hair', 'band', 'so', 'okay', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'ingenious', 'tons', 'damage', 'hoping', 'audience', 'feels', ""'ll"", 'heal', 'Who', 'cool', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'let', 'people', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'kid', 'beanie', 'who', 'everything', 'lame', 'biggest', 'heart', 'other', 'kids', 'abilities', 'cry', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'causing', 'ruckus', 'Quan', 'up', 'say', ""'re"", 'together', 'Then', 'stop', 'smile', 'finales', 'are', 'jumble', 'fantastic', 'action', 'sequences', 'floating', 'nude', 'characters', 'touching', 'fingers', 'blinding', 'limbo', 'attain', 'POWER', 'THAT', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'BEAT', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'much.In', 'summation', 'show', 'noteworthy', 'battles', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'storyline', 'patience', 'offering', 'nothing', 'new', 'will', 'say', 'kids', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everything', 'sun', 'yet', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Fans', 'art', 'choreography', 'animation', 'quality', 'are', 'invited', 'watch', 'once', 'admire', 'masters', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'story', 'victim', 'repetitive', 'mediocrity', 'fast', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'good', 'stuff', 'there', 'shame.I', ""'m"", 'animator', 'writer', 'frequently', 'pour', 'stacks', 'anime', 'was', 'helpful', 'tastes', 'seem', 'align', 'follow', ""'ll"", 'try', 'steer', 'straight']",Towanoquon Complete Collection

1532644,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007K7IBTS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","Intense action with every film, the ""Towanoquon"" six-film series is an exciting X-Men-like storyline from BONES.Directed by Umanosuke Iida (""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"", ""Hellsing""), written by Toshizo Nemoto (""Tokyo Majin"", ""Getbackers"", ""Chrome Shelled Regios"") and featuring music by world renown Kenji Kawai (""Eden of the East"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Ranma 1/2&#8243;, ""Mobil Suit Gundam 00&#8243;) are among the talented crew behind BONES sci-fi film series.And now the film series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.VIDEO:""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  And because these are films, not a TV series or OVA, I came into watching these films with very high expectations from BONES.  And I'm glad to say, that BONES delivered!Not only do you get the detailed backgrounds, vibrant colors but also wonderful character designs, awesome use of lighting and visual effects and great balance between CG and cel work. The Blu-ray features vibrant colors, black levels are nice and deep, shadowing is well-done and once again, wonderful detail when it comes to scenery, may it be city landscapes or lush environments.""Towanoquon"" is a wonderful accomplishment from BONES and awesome picture quality!  I didn't notice any banding or any artifact issues during my viewing of the six films.AUDIO:""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  And if I had one word to describe these films, the word would be immersive.  Because of the high level of action seen throughout each of the six films, your surround channels and subwoofer are put into use frequently.Rarely do you hear anime soundtracks this immersive, so I was impressed.  This is one of the better sounding anime lossless soundtracks on Blu-ray and audiophiles should be pleased!As for the voice acting, both Japanese and English soundtracks are well-done!  I watched the films with both soundtracks and they are well-acted.  If anything, it's about preference and whichever version you decide on watching, just know that both are equally fantastic when it comes to voice acting and overall soundtrack!Subtitles are featured in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Episode 6 commentary featuring various time dedicated for the English voice dub actors to talk about their characters and being part of the ""Towanoquon"" which include ADR director Steve Foster, Ty Doran (Yuma), Corey Hartzog (Quon), Elizabeth Bunch (Midori), Andrew Love (Kamishiro), David Matranga (Shun) and Emily Neves (Kiri).Trailers - Sentai Filmwork trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:""Towanoquon"" is an exciting, action-packed anime series that has many similarities to the Marvel Comics series ""X-Men"".  With the storyline of humans being born with special abilities and being hunted, it does resemble the X-Men and the mutants (humans with special abilities) who are being targeted by the government and the Sentinels.The first three films helps develop the storyline around the Accelerators vs. the Custos and how the Accelerators, or people born with their special abilities, are finding it difficult to deal with their powers and also dealing with their own kind who are very critical of their special abilities.  There are a lot of characters featured in the films, so the first three films focuses on developing the characters, showcasing their personalities and more.But also how relations are among the accelerators and how difficult a life one lives with their ability.For example, one episode features a boy who has the ability to talk to plants and can control them.  But he's also bullied by other accelerators who think it's stupid or don't believe he can talk to plants.  And the bullying becomes so bad  that he loses it and wants to show people he can be dangerous and deadly.  But things unfortunately get out of hand.And in the process, we see how Quon and the Accelerators grow their group but try to make sure people practice their special ability and have control over it.By the fourth film, things start to get more intense as we get to learn more about Quon's past.  Because he has lived for over a 1,000 years, we get to see how tragic of a life he had lived and why he is so determined to protecting other accelerators.And then, there is another storyline that involves the character Shun Kazami.  A member of the WTOC and an antagonist in the early films.  But you also learn about his tragic past and what led him to the WTOC.  For Quon, he knows the pain that Shun has lived with and wants to embrace his ability and have him join the group, but because he's from the other side, others are not as welcoming.While the films are action-packed, violent and has its share of a growing body count, what I found entertaining about ""Towano Quon"" is its characters and how they engage in battle against the WTOC while trying to save other accelerators.  They are literally the hunted and odds are often against them.The series also looks fantastic!  Featuring anime production by BONES, the character design and visual effects are fantastic.  The studio put a lot of time into making sure the special abilities of the characters are well-featured and lighting effects look amazing. The art backgrounds are gorgeous and full of detail. On Blu-ray, the films look vibrant, full of colors that really pop and a good blend with cel animation and CG.And the lossless soundtrack is equally impressive with LFE and the use of surrounds during those many action sequences to make ""Towanoquon"" quite immersive!  I do wish there were more special features aside from the one single commentary but at least a special feature was included.While the storyline is nothing new and fans who grew up reading or watching ""X-Men"" will find many similarities between the the well-known Marvel series and ""Towanoquon"", the main difference would be cultural sensibilities.  Because Quon has pretty much grown up during traditional Japanese times and his immortal status has taken him to Japan of the future, there is a good blend of traditional Japan and futuristic Japan featured throughout these episodes.The characters and their abilities are well-presented and thanks to the visual effects, lighting effects and beautiful animation and background art combined with an exciting storyline.An action-packed series with a heavy hitting storyline, beautiful animation and an immersive lossless soundtrack on Blu-ray, ""Towanoquon: Complete Collection"" is highly recommended!",4,Blu-ray: Looks and sounds amazing on Blu-ray!  An action-packed animated film series!,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,6597,"['Intense', 'action', 'film', 'Towanoquon', 'six-film', 'series', 'exciting', 'X-Men-like', 'storyline', 'BONES.Directed',

The main character wants to 'save' all of those with special powers from a secret organization bent of capturing/destroying them. Lots of the characters' powers has been done by (pick a comic book series)~ and this doesn't really take anything away from the series. The fight scenes and animation are AZZ-KICKING and the pacing is just right. The story is also one of it's strongest points. The soundtrack amazing too- as I watched it, I started to wonder whether an OST was available...It also has very likeable characters. The only minus this gets from me is the character development. There just wasn't quite enough of it. BUT the series doesn't have a DEFINITE FINAL ending (the 'bad guy' was dealt with but not the 'TRUE bad guys'), although if there wasn't anymore to this, it'd be ok still.
