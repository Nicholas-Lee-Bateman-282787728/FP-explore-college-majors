651094,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00005JPI2,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 2]","After three and four, this fifth installment is disappointing. Order of the Phoenix is too short and leaves out a little bit too much. Make that way, WAY too much by serious fans of the books, but when isn't that the case? At times the viewer is not provided with background and significant details which would make the story more interesting and sensible. All of these movies seem to made with an assumption that everyone has read the book. This movie should have included more and that it was shorter running than previous adaptations is inexcusable and the wrong decision by the filmmakers. This fifth story leaves you eager for six and seven while making many people concerned about the choice of David Yates (director of Phoenix) to be director of all three. However, what is very promising is Yates's desire to do the seventh and last book as two seperate films in order to do justice to the story.I had a problem with the bluish tint seen in much of the movie and that sort of digitale film look, I guess you could call it. Hagrid's giant half-brother was just sad. I mean, how could they accept that result? It's acceptable by mid-90s standards. Maybe they figured people wouldn't care.There are a few things that stand out in this movie, however.I liked the Department of Mysteries. You wondered what it would look like on the screen and it did not disappoint. Dolores Umbridge is evil incarnate. She is one of the most horrible, disgusting, unlikable, disturbing villains I've ever seen. Most of the time villains, particularly in the movies, are famous for having the best lines and great style. They have a stricking apperance and often more personality and charisma than the heros. Not the case with Dolores Umbridge. She has none of this going for her. No great lines but some slightly memorable ones like she confesses, ""You know, I really hate children."" That squeaky voice, the knit pink oufit, and torturing kids... It's Big Brother in pink with a bad hair-do as your worst nightmare teacher from grade school and ""a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket""(The Daily Mall). Well, truth is she is not as horrible as Margaret Thatcher. All the performances are good. Gary Oldman is great as Sirius Black as is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is the embodiment of the twisted, evil, cackling witch.The obvious highlight and climax of Order of the Phoenix is the battle at the Ministry culminating in the epic duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Out of all the wizard fights I've seen portrayed in the movies, this one was the most impressive. It was fierce and conveyed the two masters awesome abilities without seeming cartoonish or leaving you feeling like your favorite character was short changed. (I umm, have a couple movies in mind here. You guess what they are.)",3,Harry Potter and Big Brother,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,2818,"['three', 'four', 'fifth', 'installment', 'disappointing', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'too', 'short', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Make', 'way', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'serious', 'fans', 'books', 'when', ""n't"", 'case', 'times', 'viewer', 'not', 'provided', 'background', 'significant', 'details', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'sensible', 'movies', 'seem', 'made', 'assumption', 'everyone', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'was', 'shorter', 'running', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'inexcusable', 'wrong', 'decision', 'filmmakers', 'fifth', 'story', 'eager', 'six', 'seven', 'making', 'many', 'people', 'concerned', 'choice', 'David', 'Yates', 'director', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'director', 'three', 'However', 'what', 'very', 'promising', 'Yates', 'desire', 'do', 'seventh', 'last', 'book', 'two', 'seperate', 'films', 'order', 'do', 'justice', 'story.I', 'had', 'problem', 'bluish', 'tint', 'seen', 'much', 'movie', 'sort', 'digitale', 'film', 'look', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'Hagrid', 'giant', 'half-brother', 'was', 'just', 'sad', 'mean', 'how', 'could', 'accept', 'result', 'acceptable', 'mid-90s', 'standards', 'Maybe', 'figured', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'care.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'however.I', 'liked', 'Department', 'Mysteries', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'look', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'one', 'most', 'horrible', 'disgusting', 'unlikable', 'disturbing', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Most', 'time', 'villains', 'particularly', 'movies', 'are', 'famous', 'having', 'best', 'lines', 'great', 'style', 'have', 'stricking', 'apperance', 'often', 'more', 'personality', 'charisma', 'heros', 'Not', 'case', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'none', 'going', 'great', 'lines', 'slightly', 'memorable', 'ones', 'know', 'really', 'hate', 'children', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'knit', 'pink', 'oufit', 'torturing', 'kids', 'Big', 'Brother', 'pink', 'bad', 'hair-do', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'teacher', 'grade', 'school', 'cross', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Hyacinth', 'Bucket', 'Daily', 'Mall', 'Well', 'truth', 'not', 'as', 'horrible', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'great', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'embodiment', 'twisted', 'evil', 'cackling', 'witch.The', 'obvious', 'highlight', 'climax', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'battle', 'Ministry', 'culminating', 'epic', 'duel', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'wizard', 'fights', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'was', 'fierce', 'conveyed', 'two', 'masters', 'awesome', 'abilities', 'seeming', 'cartoonish', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'short', 'changed', 'umm', 'have', 'couple', 'movies', 'mind', 'here', 'guess', 'what', 'are']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651096,A3SZH5F79GKT18,B00005JPI2,Akimon Azuki,"[3, 3]","The fifth Potter movie is not as dark and not quite as funny as Cuaron's No 3, my favourite in the series so far, but it has excellent pace, strong performances, and well written script, plus really outstanding special effects, especially in the climactic final wand battle (rightfully described in the extras as ""Olympic level ninja wandage""). The question is, provided one already has a Blu-ray player or, as in my case, PS3, is the Blu-ray version worth the extra $$? In my opinion, very much so. The transfer has been done extremely well, and the picture is true 1080p, with quality that is outstanding, and it preserves the theatrical version's original 2.40:1 ratio. For once, even the blending in of the green screen fx shots is really good, and there is no trace of grain. And with uncompressed PCM 5.1 Surround, the sound quality, for me the big selling point of these new generation formats, is truly amazing.This version also has a large assortment of interesting extras, and they are presented in high definition as well. In Deleted Scenes, there is footage of Professor Trelawney at the big dining hall table, simply eating her food in very peculiar manner, that is by itself priceless. I also liked the ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" clips, with some good quotes from the cast. There is also a ""Trailing Tonks"" featurette, an interactive editing featurette, and a documentary called Focus Points. Plus a set of subtitles in just about every language known to Muggles.Overall, this is one of the best Blu-ray movies on the market, both in the content and presentation.",5,Magical Potter disc with shiny extras,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1587,"['fifth', 'Potter', 'movie', 'not', 'dark', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'Cuaron', '3', 'favourite', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'excellent', 'pace', 'strong', 'performances', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'really', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'climactic', 'final', 'wand', 'battle', 'rightfully', 'described', 'extras', 'Olympic', 'level', 'ninja', 'wandage', 'question', 'provided', 'one', 'already', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'case', 'PS3', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'extra', 'opinion', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'transfer', 'been', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'picture', 'true', '1080p', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'theatrical', 'version', 'original', '2.40:1', 'ratio', 'once', 'even', 'blending', 'green', 'screen', 'fx', 'shots', 'really', 'good', 'trace', 'grain', 'uncompressed', 'PCM', '5.1', 'Surround', 'sound', 'quality', 'big', 'selling', 'point', 'new', 'generation', 'formats', 'truly', 'amazing.This', 'version', 'also', 'large', 'assortment', 'interesting', 'extras', 'are', 'presented', 'high', 'definition', 'as', 'well', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'footage', 'Professor', 'Trelawney', 'big', 'dining', 'hall', 'table', 'simply', 'eating', 'food', 'very', 'peculiar', 'manner', 'priceless', 'also', 'liked', 'Hidden', 'Secrets', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'clips', 'good', 'quotes', 'cast', 'also', 'Trailing', 'Tonks', 'featurette', 'interactive', 'editing', 'featurette', 'documentary', 'called', 'Focus', 'Points', 'set', 'subtitles', 'just', 'language', 'known', 'Muggles.Overall', 'one', 'best', 'Blu-ray', 'movies', 'market', 'content', 'presentation']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

However, some essential parts, like the mystery element are completely lost and many key events can only be really understood if you read the book. As such, the movie is a great illustration for the book. Usually it is better to see the movie first then read the book- not so for this movie. Viewing it is like meeting old friends, ""aha! Here's this event"" ""There's this character"", etc.  If you already know what's going on, it's great to see it and what is not shown or discussed doesn't matter because you know it from the book. All the actor performances are excellent and the design is great, not to mention the 3D effects at Imax which are exciting without being gaudy (kitschy). Still, as a stand-alone experience the movie lacks depth, which might explain some viewer's disappointment with it. Could it have been done better? Yes, but you can't expect a ""Peter Jackson/Fran Walsh/ Philippa Boyens"" treatment for every book. Then again, why should the movie have to stand alone?

651105,A1Z7V65GIRXPIA,B00005JPI2,Amazon Customer,"[3, 9]","Having read all 7 Harry Potter books and seen this movie twice now, I conclude the movies are undoubtedly better than the novels. Why? Because they focus on the important bits of the story (the epic battle between good and evil) and eliminate the extraneous fluff that dragged the series down Book 4 on.Let's face it. JK Rowling was at her best in books 1-3. Books 4 & 5 meandered so much that a good 300 pages could have easily been chopped from each. (Something I thought at the time I read them hot off the press.)I for one am ecstatic the whole Quiddich thing is excluded. Those sequences always distracted from the books by being overly long and dumbing down the drama of Harry's quest. Facing torture at the hands of a sadistic teacher and imminent death from an evil wizard, I doubt the students of Hogwarts would get their knickers in a twist over a silly wizard soccer game. Those sequences belong in children's books to give the 9-12 year olds a break from the important and darker stuff. But the movies are aimed at an older crowd able to understand the angst of a 15 year old Harry.What does this movie do best? It picks up where GoF left off (in a way that minimizes the gaping plot hole left in the books). We have a Muggle world unwittingly caught in a magical war. We see Harry stewing in his enforced teen isolation because the adults think him only a child. We see his peers take a stand and one step closer to becoming recognized adults. (2 years from now they will be considered adults anyway.) Cho's story makes much more sense in the film than the book (breaking up over a friend is the sort of silly thing 12 year olds do not 15 y.o.) Neville gets out all that's truly important about his parents' story. And the finale with Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort works so much better in this dramatization than the confusing pages in the book.The only thing I can say was underdeveloped was Snape's teen memories. Specifically the bits involving Lily, Harry's mum.

651109,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B00005JPI2,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[2, 2]","My first viewing of this film in the cinema didn't leave a very positive impression. The lead actors are getting better with every film. Daniel Radcliffe is quite the leading man. I wish they'd given Rupert Grint more to do this time around. And Emma Watson is as luminous as always. What didn't work for me was the direction by David Yates. There's no doubting he's a competent director, but there's a sense of humor, flair and verve missing from his pedestrian direction.Fortunately, this film played much better on DVD. There are some great moments in this film. The Dementor attack. Loony...I mean Luna Lovegood's debut. Dumbledore's Army (a well-directed sequence). The battle between the Order and the Death Eaters. The climactic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end.The biggest problem I have with this film is that it's a series of great moments that can be enjoyed on a DVD. But they don't quite connect together for me to make a truly great film. What saves this film are the performances. The leads (obviously). Imelda Staunton as the odious Dolores Umbridge. But for me, the standout performance for best supporting actress this time around goes to Evanna Lynch. Where did they find this girl?!!? It's as though she fell out of the pages of the book.The other dissapointment with this DVD are the extras. I can't believe they wasted an entire extra disc on such threadbare offerings. We get 4 documentaries. Where are the cast interviews? The Directors Commentary? The spotlight on the new cast members? Compared to the great offerings on the Goblet of Fire disc, it's very dissapointing this time around.Still, if you're a fan of the films then this is going to be one you're adding to your collection, regardless.",4,Great moments that make a very good film,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1741,"['first', 'viewing', 'film', 'cinema', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'very', 'positive', 'impression', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'getting', 'better', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'quite', 'leading', 'man', 'wish', ""'d"", 'given', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'more', 'do', 'time', 'around', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'as', 'luminous', 'always', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'direction', 'David', 'Yates', 'doubting', 'competent', 'director', 'sense', 'humor', 'flair', 'verve', 'missing', 'pedestrian', 'direction.Fortunately', 'film', 'played', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'Dementor', 'attack', 'Loony', 'mean', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'debut', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'well-directed', 'sequence', 'battle', 'Order', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'end.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'series', 'great', 'moments', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'connect', 'together', 'make', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'What', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'leads', 'obviously', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'odious', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'standout', 'performance', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'time', 'around', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'Where', 'did', 'find', 'girl', 'fell', 'out', 'pages', 'book.The', 'other', 'dissapointment', 'DVD', 'are', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'wasted', 'entire', 'extra', 'disc', 'such', 'threadbare', 'offerings', 'get', '4', 'documentaries', 'Where', 'are', 'cast', 'interviews', 'Directors', 'Commentary', 'spotlight', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'Compared', 'great', 'offerings', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'disc', 'very', 'dissapointing', 'time', 'around.Still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'films', 'then', 'going', 'be', 'one', ""'re"", 'adding', 'collection', 'regardless']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651110,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00005JPI2,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[3, 3]","The movie was great, not perfect, but great.  You can read all about it elsewhere.This, meanwhile, is my honest, appalled, and feeling somewhat ripped-off review of the Two Disc ""Special"" Edition DVD.Where's the specialness?!  Where's the features?!  Why am I paying up to 75% more for an extra disc over the normal version!?For the sake of continuity with my other HP movies that come with two discs, and not wanting to be left out on the bonus features, I got the Special Edition.The bonus features are laughably minimal, and barely exceeding an hour in full.Magic of Editing: A very short documentary about the importance of editing in a scene, then a stupid game that lets you add music and sound effects to a scene from the movie.Deleted and Alternate Scenes: The totality of these scenes, minus the first one which seemed just a joke for the die-hard fans, added up to maybe five minutes or less.  Would it really have hurt the movie to include them in the final cut?  Most of the scenes were second-long add-ons to other scenes, such as Neville claiming The Daily Prophet really is full of crap after Seamus confronts Harry in the common room, or Harry passing by Dumbledore's office towards the end, and Dumbledore motioning for him to come in.  That's really it.  The first deleted scene was basically just focusing on the Divinations Professor (sorry, forgot her name) during Umbridge's speech to the students in the Great Hall, basically spilling her food, dropping cream in her water, and all in all making an idiot of herself during the entire 3-4 minute speech.  Clearly they had no intention of including this in the movie, simply because of the sheer ridiculousness and complete irrelevance of it.The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter:  Basically just describing Harry's journey through the first five movies, and ""speculating"" on what's to come, as if the books didn't exist.  The introduction tells us that there are clues all over the movies as to Harry's eventual fate with Voldemort, but the documentary didn't bother dealing too much with this.Trailing Tonks:  Possibly the only really fun part of this bonus.  Natalie Tena (who seems perpetually hopped up on caffeine in this documentary) dressed as Nymphadora Tonks (and occasionally appearing on screen as herself, sans makeup, talking about her experience during this scene or that) guides us around some of the set to show us how various things were done, from sound editing, catering, shooting, prop building, set building, and choreography for wand duels.  She also sings a song on a guitar, with a fabulous voice.  Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes.So basically, this ""special"" edition gives you a few random clips and bits of the movie that add nothing more to the story already missing large pieces according to the book readers, a documentary having little to do with the movie itself, Nat Tena giving us 10 minutes of a fun tour, and a stupid little game not even worth playing.  And they need a whole nother DVD to fit this 1 hour or less of content and package it as if it were the definitive version to own.  Clearly not worth it.",2,"5 Stars for Movie, 2 Stars for ""Special Edition"" DVD",1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,3115,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'not', 'perfect', 'great', 'can', 'read', 'meanwhile', 'honest', 'appalled', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'ripped-off', 'review', 'Two', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD.Where', 'specialness', 'Where', 'features', 'Why', 'am', 'paying', 'up', '75', '%', 'more', 'extra', 'disc', 'normal', 'version', 'sake', 'continuity', 'other', 'HP', 'movies', 'come', 'two', 'discs', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'bonus', 'got', 'Special', 'Edition.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'laughably', 'minimal', 'barely', 'exceeding', 'hour', 'full.Magic', 'Editing', 'very', 'short', 'documentary', 'importance', 'editing', 'scene', 'then', 'stupid', 'game', 'add', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'scene', 'movie.Deleted', 'Alternate', 'Scenes', 'totality', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'seemed', 'just', 'joke', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'added', 'up', 'maybe', 'five', 'minutes', 'less', 'Would', 'really', 'have', 'hurt', 'movie', 'include', 'final', 'cut', 'Most', 'scenes', 'were', 'second-long', 'add-ons', 'other', 'scenes', 'such', 'Neville', 'claiming', 'Daily', 'Prophet', 'really', 'full', 'crap', 'Seamus', 'confronts', 'Harry', 'common', 'room', 'Harry', 'passing', 'Dumbledore', 'office', 'end', 'Dumbledore', 'motioning', 'come', 'really', 'first', 'deleted', 'scene', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'focusing', 'Divinations', 'Professor', 'sorry', 'forgot', 'name', 'Umbridge', 'speech', 'students', 'Great', 'Hall', 'basically', 'spilling', 'food', 'dropping', 'cream', 'water', 'making', 'idiot', 'herself', 'entire', '3-4', 'minute', 'speech', 'Clearly', 'had', 'intention', 'including', 'movie', 'simply', 'sheer', 'ridiculousness', 'complete', 'irrelevance', 'it.The', 'Hidden', 'Secrets', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Basically', 'just', 'describing', 'Harry', 'journey', 'first', 'five', 'movies', 'speculating', 'what', 'come', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'introduction', 'are', 'clues', 'movies', 'Harry', 'eventual', 'fate', 'Voldemort', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'dealing', 'too', 'much', 'this.Trailing', 'Tonks', 'Possibly', 'only', 'really', 'fun', 'part', 'bonus', 'Natalie', 'Tena', 'who', 'perpetually', 'hopped', 'up', 'caffeine', 'documentary', 'dressed', 'Nymphadora', 'Tonks', 'occasionally', 'appearing', 'screen', 'herself', 'makeup', 'talking', 'experience', 'scene', 'set', 'show', 'how', 'various', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'sound', 'editing', 'catering', 'shooting', 'prop', 'building', 'set', 'building', 'choreography', 'wand', 'duels', 'also', 'song', 'guitar', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'Whole', 'thing', 'lasted', '10', 'minutes.So', 'basically', 'special', 'edition', 'few', 'random', 'clips', 'bits', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'story', 'already', 'missing', 'large', 'pieces', 'according', 'book', 'readers', 'documentary', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'movie', 'Nat', 'Tena', 'giving', '10', 'minutes', 'fun', 'tour', 'stupid', 'little', 'game', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'playing', 'need', 'whole', 'nother', 'DVD', 'fit', '1', 'hour', 'less', 'content', 'package', 'were', 'definitive', 'version', 'own', 'Clearly', 'not']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651112,A27EH1X1KIK2JA,B00005JPI2,Andres Escobar,"[3, 4]","It is no question that all of the movies on the Harry Potter series are amazing, and so is this one. Harry returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts more much grown up and with much more trouble that he expected, not worrying about losing Quidditch matches, death on a Triwizard Championship, or winning the cup for the year, but he still have some new worries and troubles that will keep him, and you, busy for the rest of the movie.The movie follows Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) one year after leaving Hogwarts School of Wizardry. First dealing with an expulsion after using magic in front of a Muggle when not supposed to reveals some new troubles that have been keeping Harry thinking all summer: Wondering why Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have stayed out of touch through the whole summer. After a long talk with Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and everybody else in between, he discovers that people at Hogwarts believe he, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), are crazy when they says that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back. From there on, is just a huge roller coaster for Harry and the only thing he, and his friends, want to do is defeat Voldermort whenever given the chance. Starting with the new Art against the Dark Teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the ""extensive leave"" from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), and the nightmares that wake Harry up cold sweating, it is not easy for Harry to deal with his biggest ""fears"". I will try not too give as much on the movie, since each character and ""thing"" make the movie so intense and this should give you a preview on what to expect and I don't really want to ruin it for you, and if you already read the book, then there is nothing I can ruin. Like Harry says "" Even though I am at Hogwarts, I have never felt more alone"", and that should tell you a lot.We have some new and old characters that really make the movie tense. First we have Dolores Umbridge. She is the most arrogant, meanest teacher that plays part at Hogwarts. She will make you hate her until the last minute, until then off course, she is taken away. Her pink clothing, her cold punishments, and her fancy office, make her the most annoying teacher ever to walk the halls and classrooms of Hogwarts. She is the one that denies all of Harry's accusation towards Lord Voldemort being back. Second we have Sirius Black, who finally comes into place in this movie. And third, the weird Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) the new ""witch"" that comes into the group where, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), and Neville (Matthew Lewis) have been for years.I have to admit that the movies get pretty dark as the go, and this one is probably the darkest one so far. The movie has GREAT effects, and I have to say that David Yates did a great job directing the movie and bringing the special effects coordinator that had part on this movie. I was amazed by the last few scenes from the movie, and I have to say that I wanted more. The only thing that threw me down was that the movie took its time to get intense, and since I have not read the book (which I will get the collection this September) I do not know how true the movie stayed to the book, and if the book actually takes its time to get intense. I did notice that some scenes were a bit rushed and that there wasn't much of the new characters development, and though the acting was for the most part good, I missed some of the old characters.I will let you judge it yourself, but please go see it (probably a must-see). Harry Potter fans will love it, and non-fans, will too. You don't have to be a wizard or witch to be accepted into Hogwarts school of wizardry, just see it, it will be staring right back at you.",4,"Harry Potter On His Fifth Year Is Dark, and Not What I Expected!!",1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,3707,"['question', 'movies', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'are', 'amazing', 'so', 'one', 'Harry', 'fifth', 'year', 'Hogwarts', 'more', 'much', 'grown', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'trouble', 'expected', 'not', 'worrying', 'losing', 'Quidditch', 'matches', 'death', 'Triwizard', 'Championship', 'winning', 'cup', 'year', 'still', 'have', 'new', 'worries', 'troubles', 'will', 'keep', 'busy', 'rest', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'one', 'year', 'leaving', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Wizardry', 'First', 'dealing', 'expulsion', 'using', 'magic', 'front', 'Muggle', 'when', 'not', 'supposed', 'reveals', 'new', 'troubles', 'have', 'been', 'keeping', 'Harry', 'thinking', 'summer', 'Wondering', 'why', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'have', 'stayed', 'touch', 'whole', 'summer', 'long', 'talk', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'everybody', 'else', 'people', 'Hogwarts', 'believe', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'are', 'crazy', 'when', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'back', 'there', 'just', 'huge', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Harry', 'only', 'thing', 'friends', 'want', 'do', 'defeat', 'Voldermort', 'whenever', 'given', 'chance', 'Starting', 'new', 'Art', 'Dark', 'Teacher', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'extensive', 'leave', 'Hagrid', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'nightmares', 'wake', 'Harry', 'up', 'cold', 'sweating', 'not', 'easy', 'Harry', 'deal', 'biggest', 'fears', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'too', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'character', 'thing', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'intense', 'should', 'give', 'preview', 'what', 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'ruin', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'nothing', 'can', 'ruin', 'Harry', 'Even', 'am', 'Hogwarts', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'more', 'alone', 'should', 'tell', 'lot.We', 'have', 'new', 'old', 'characters', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'tense', 'First', 'have', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'most', 'arrogant', 'meanest', 'teacher', 'part', 'Hogwarts', 'will', 'make', 'hate', 'last', 'minute', 'then', 'course', 'taken', 'away', 'pink', 'clothing', 'cold', 'punishments', 'fancy', 'office', 'make', 'most', 'annoying', 'teacher', 'ever', 'walk', 'halls', 'classrooms', 'Hogwarts', 'one', 'Harry', 'accusation', 'towards', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'being', 'back', 'Second', 'have', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'who', 'finally', 'place', 'movie', 'third', 'weird', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'new', 'witch', 'group', 'where', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Ginny', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Neville', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'have', 'been', 'years.I', 'have', 'admit', 'movies', 'get', 'pretty', 'dark', 'go', 'one', 'probably', 'darkest', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'movie', 'GREAT', 'effects', 'have', 'say', 'David', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'bringing', 'special', 'effects', 'coordinator', 'had', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'wanted', 'more', 'only', 'thing', 'threw', 'down', 'was', 'movie', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'intense', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'get', 'collection', 'September', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'true', 'movie', 'stayed', 'book', 'book', 'actually', 'time', 'get', 'intense', 'did', 'notice', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'rushed', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'new', 'characters', 'development', 'acting', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'missed', 'old', 'characters.I', 'will', 'let', 'judge', 'please', 'go', 'see', 'probably', 'must-see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'non-fans', 'will', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'wizard', 'witch', 'be', 'accepted', 'Hogwarts', 'school', 'wizardry', 'just', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'staring', 'right', 'back']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651115,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00005JPI2,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[25, 30]","It is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry, and things are about to go from bad to worse.  First, Harry and Dudley encounter a pair of dementors in Little Whinging, one of which almost manages to steal Dudley's soul.  Harry happens to have his wand on him, however, and repels both dementors using the Patronus charm.  That action causes him to get expelled from Hogwarts, but soon after, his expulsion is rescinded pending a trial hearing.  Mad-Eye and the rest of the Order come to break Harry out, and they head to the headquarters of the Order, formerly Sirius' childhood home.  From there, they speed onward to Hogwarts, where things are anything but how they've been.For starters, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, is absolutely resolute in denying that Voldemort is back.  Also, he uses the incident with Harry's Patronus to place more and more Ministry restrictions on Hogwarts, starting with the appointment of one of Fudge's own subordinates, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, as the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher.  Soon, under Umbridge's tutelage, DaDA becomes, not a place where magic is used, but a place where magic is taught, because, in the words of Umbridge, ""Who do you think would want to use magic against you out there?""  Not only that, but Umbridge (through Fudge) gets a whole load of Ministry Decrees passed, further tightening the Ministry's control over Hogwarts.A main part of the Order of the Phoenix movie is Harry's formation of Dumbledore's Army (DA).  Since Umbridge won't teach them defensive magic, Harry vows to do just that for anyone who is willing.  The DA originally consists of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but soon a whole slew of other characters join, including Neville, who, up until this point, had been lacking in the magical abilities department.  Also, Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape are included here, as is Voldemort's attempts to get into Harry's mind using Legilimency.  Finally, the Battle at the Ministry, where Voldemort finally reveals himself to the Ministry and the remainder of the Order.As my title says, Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of the five that have been released, but I have a few big problems with how they handled the transition from book to movie, the main one being time.  How can they justify taking the longest Harry Potter book yet and making into the shortest Harry Potter movie yet?  Many crucial scenes were cut out, including (not really crucial, but certainly enjoyable) Ron's Quidditch tryouts (and Quidditch in general is cut completely out), Harry and the gang's meeting with Neville and his Crucio-ed mother in St. Mungo's during Christmas break, Dumbledore's conversation with Harry at the end was cut by about 3/4, Harry's excursion into Snape's memory changed (in the book, he found out about his father's torturing Snape through the Pensieve, but in the movie, it's when Harry Protegos Snape's Legilimens spell)... I realize time constraints are a factor, but cutting an 870-page book down to a mere 2 and 1/2 hour movie is beyond me.In spite of the completely unsatisfactory length, I was very much satisfied with the actor choices for the new parts.  Coming in for her first ever movie role is the beautiful Evanna Lynch, who plays the eccentric Luna Lovegood.  Personally, Evanna is the best actor in the whole movie, not to mention my favorite actress; she really captures the personality of Luna very well.  Gary Oldman returns for his second stab at the character of Sirius Black, and pulls off a very convincing performance.  Michael Gambon is at his best this film, as he plays Dumbledore's character to a tee.  Another actress making her first Harry Potter movie debut is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the demented Bellatrix Lestrange; Imelda Staunton performs admirably as Professor Dolores Umbridge, the most hated character in the movie; and finally... returning for his fifth time is Alan Rickman, who once again shows the world that there can only be one true Severus Snape, and that is he.Also, character development is a key part that OotP and director David Yates pull off spectacularly.  We see Neville, who before couldn't do as much as a Disarming Spell, grow into quite the formidable wizard, even attempting to battle Bellatrix when they meet in the Ministry.  We see Hermione... okay, so no real change occurs in Hermione; she's still the brave know-it-all, except this time around, she's more accepting of breaking the rules (leading to Ron's classic line ""Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?""). And then there's Ron, who, unfortunately, is pretty much shunted to the back in favor of Hermione's more affable personality; his biggest scene (not including the battle scene) is his defending of Harry when Seamus rips him for believing that Voldemort is back.  Finally, Luna really gets her time in the spotlight, being one of the first to master Harry's teaching the Patronus spell; also, her relationship with Harry deepens alot (does anyone else besides me think that Luna's got a HUGE crush on Harry?) and she starts making friends with Ron and Hermione a bit more, too.To close... the innumerable omissions may irk many a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but don't let that discourage you from going to see Order of the Phoenix.  It's still the best Harry Potter movie to date- it just could have been a little bit longer and, by extension, a little bit better.",4,"by far, THE best of the movies to date... but it could be

651121,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B00005JPI2,A Reviewer,"[2, 2]","For the first 1 hour and a half, Order of the Phoenix is easily the best-made film in the series, not only making excellent use of flashbacks, dream sequences, and newspaper clippings to bring a new level of emotion, plot exposition, complexity, and realism to the movie, but also to provide the movie with a much more cinematic feel. For the first time in the series, we feel like we have real characters here, with real development and with real emotions and thoughts. These are not the ""cardboard cutouts based on the book characters"" who populated the previous installments of the series, but these are very real characters who develop. David Yates is the first director who really feels like a passionate fan of the books, and he brings this book to life in a very mature way...this is the first film to really capture the tone of the book almost completely, and it moves along at a very quick pace. There's a sense of building dread and tension in the movie that feels like it's all building up to a very powerful and intense ending...Which, unfortunately, never happens, because what should have been a huge and epic final battle in the Department of Mysteries turns out to fall completely flat, due to a combination of over-editing and a ""playing it safe"" approach that unfortunately single-handedly removes all the danger from these final scenes. The final battle scenes in the book in the Department of Mysteries were easily some of the most intense in the series, where Harry lead his friends (stupidly) into a near-fatal situation, and where they must flee for their lives. Unfortunately, very little of this comes across in the movie. The Death Eaters don't seem to pose much of a threat, and their pursuit of the kids seems to resemble a game of tag rather than the horrifying chase scenes portrayed in the book...the fact that the movie seems to imply that a bunch of kids could take on Voldemort's best ""soldiers"" with barely a scratch is ridiculous. The fact that they didn't even film Neville resisting Bellatrix's torture shows that these movies still play it way too safe, despite the PG-13 rating.But what ultimately hurts these scenes is their short length and over-editing. Each of the 3 battles that take place is over in less than a minute, and neither seem to flow particularly well, with characters seeming to jump from one place to another without any of it being SHOWN to us. It feels like David Yates hacked these battle scenes to the bare minimum in order to save time, which was unfortunate since he basically butchered some of the most intense moments of the series. Over-editing sometimes makes itself visible in other areas of the movie as well, such as when Grawp hands Hermione handlebars, and you can see her slowly reaching out to give them back, then suddenly Grawp's holding them again without them finishing showing them being handed back to him. Would it have really killed them to have those extra few seconds in there? Similarly, When Neville discovers the Prophecy, he calls Harry, who'se at the other end of the room, over, and then all of a sudden Harry's standing right in front of the prophecy. The sometimes disruptive editing isn't a particularly big deal, (although it's noticeable,) until the action scenes at the end, which feel very short and choppy as a result.It's unfortunate that David Yates dropped the ball with the action scenes at the end, because otherwise his movie's the best in the series. Unfortunately, the ""best"" still goes to Goblet of Fire, as we ended up with a movie that seem to be building (excellently) to something that just never really happens. Other small flaws, like Michael Gambon's angry and humorless Dumbledore and lack of impact of the death of a central character don't really help matters. Is there really nobody on set who'se noticed that Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is nothing like how he was in the books? There's very little sense of the fun and humor that Dumbledore is supposed to convey, what we have here is a grouchy old man who yells at his students and speaks in a low growl. It's too bad because Gambon got it right in Prisoner of Azkaban yet has been totally off ever since.David Yates is probably the biggest fan of the books of any director of this series and it shows. He got the characters just right and the movie's at it's best when it focuses on them. (The possession scene is excellently done.) He's also gotten the best performances out of the main characters, especially Harry and Ron. The sometimes corny dialogue from past movies is gone almost entirely, and the opening 30 minutes are really some of the most enjoyable in the series. Unfortunately, a combination of over-editing and lack of pacing really ruin what should have been one of the most exciting finale's of the series, and that was a big disappointment for me, since it was one of the best parts of the book. Still, I'm glad Yates is returning for the 6th movie, but I just hope he puts a little more punch into the action and doesn't try to edit so much; you don't need a short movie, dude, these are long books.Movie; 4 stars.DVD bonus features; 2 stars.And once again, I find myself complaining about the awful special features provided to us by Warner Bros on these DVD's. Despite the fact that this movie grossed more than any in this series other than the 1st one at the box office, we have possibly the weakest selection of bonus features since that one. We get a handful of deleted scenes, (none of which feel particularly significant, and the full Snape's Worst Memory, which was shot and completed, is nowhere to be found,) we get a pointless feature about where the series has been and where people think it's going...none of their predictions turned out to be right and since the final book was released a week after the movie hit theaters, I have no idea what the point was of throwing it on the DVD. We do get a fairly nice feature of the actress who plays Tonks showing us around on set... unfortunately she takes us away before they begin shooting, so we don't get to see any of that. Topping the features off is a feature with David Yates and his editor discussing the editing process, and giving us the ability to edit a scene. It's an interesting feature and it's nice to have watched it, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster features on the DVD. We get NO ""making of"" features this time around..nothing on the Thestrals, the entirely digital Hall of Prophecies, nothing on the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort fight at the end, the Ministry of Magic, the flight on the broomsticks and thestrals......no interviews with the cast or producers, nothing with the director aside from the editing feature, nothing on the filming of the movie....Rowling's nowhere to be seen (despite the fact that this was reportedly her favorite movie in the series so far,) and we don't even get anything as basic as a Director's Commentary. Unbelievably weak bonus features that WB should be ashamed of. Easily the worst in the series since the 1st movie's. Thanks a lot, guys.  The movie itself is the 2nd best, though, and fans as well as general moviegoers should check it out as it's a great (if a bit over-edited) movie.",4,Great movie that falls apart at the

As one would expect, Harry is getting older and so thankfully the story is maturing as well. The final confrontation is intense and visually spectacular. Other than the movie being a little too long, and that there wasn't much of the ""Order of the Phoenix"" (a little too strange for someone who have not read the book), I still enjoyed it.I can't wait for the next chapter.

651123,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B00005JPI2,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[1, 1]","Although this is the most watered down film in the series, it's not the worst, and it's not bad. Personally, I do agree with many of you that many essential plot developments were excised from OOTP, but after reading Deathly Hallows, I realized how unimportant some of those plotlines or revelations were. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I was left a little bewildered that they would cut out most of the prophecy made by Trelawney in the orb; the entire (spoiler alert) dialogue about Neville almost suffering Harry's fate (end spoiler) was left out, and I thought that that would be an essential revelation for DH, but after reading the book, I figured out, it wasn't. So, all in all, I felt the film was not missing anything as a film. Yes, if did not have the all-around action Goblet of Fire had (instead, it had an amazing finale where you see wizards wand-dueling). My only complaint with Order of the Phoenix was not its plot, but mainly its delivery. I think Yates is an outstanding director (especially after seeing Half-Blood Prince), but his transition from television film to Hollywood film could not have been made more apparent than in this film. There were parts that I felt Yates was not able to handle a Hollywood production as effectively as a more experienced director such as Alfonso Cuaron and Chris Columbus would. There were scenes that lacked the proper intensity or scenes that ruined the credibility of this medieval-looking fantasy world. An example would be a scene where Filch sits in front of the Room of Requirement to wait for the students to leave. While he waits, he is sitting on a chair with a foldable table in front and a thermus on top (two objects that seemed very out of place for this dark and surreal setting); but, then again, that might have been Yates's intention (bringing the real world to Hogwarts). Another example would be when the trio arrive at Hogwarts and are seated in the Great Hall; here, Dumbledore's speech is handled in too much of a mundane way. In all the other films prior, Dumbledore's speech marked the beginning of the adventure at Hogwarts, but here, it became too routine and slightly boring. Luckily, this was something Yates realized and fixed in Half-Blood Prince, where he gave Dumbledore the proper close-up he deserved as well as a moving, metallic owl to mark the beginning of his foreboding speech. On the up side, Yates is an amazing filmmaker, and he does some really great work here. In my opinion, this was the first Harry Potter movie to develop J.K. Rowling's strong themes of good and evil. The scenes where Harry is having internal struggles are very well-done; so well done that they brought to mind classic films such as the Star Wars pictures. When he confronts Voldemort at the end of this film, he doesn't do so physically, but it proves to be more of a psychological showdown; and it is done extremely well. In fact, Yates did this so well that I was left extremely satisfied after watching the film because I felt that the most importand aspect of J.K. Rowling's book was adapted masterfully onscreen. Could it have been done better? Maybe! But, all I know is that Yates was able to achieve it effectively, and that was good enough for me.I really recommend this movie. It's not perfect, but it's entertaining and it proves that children's entertainment can be challenging, thought-provoking, and powerful.",4,I really liked this movie!,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,3408,"['most', 'watered', 'down', 'film', 'series', 'not', 'worst', 'not', 'bad', 'Personally', 'do', 'agree', 'many', 'many', 'essential', 'plot', 'developments', 'were', 'excised', 'OOTP', 'reading', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'realized', 'how', 'unimportant', 'plotlines', 'revelations', 'were', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'was', 'left', 'little', 'bewildered', 'would', 'cut', 'out', 'most', 'prophecy', 'made', 'Trelawney', 'orb', 'entire', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'dialogue', 'Neville', 'almost', 'suffering', 'Harry', 'fate', 'end', 'spoiler', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'essential', 'revelation', 'DH', 'reading', 'book', 'figured', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'So', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'missing', 'anything', 'film', 'Yes', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'all-around', 'action', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'had', 'instead', 'had', 'amazing', 'finale', 'where', 'see', 'wizards', 'wand-dueling', 'only', 'complaint', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'not', 'plot', 'mainly', 'delivery', 'think', 'Yates', 'outstanding', 'director', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'transition', 'television', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'apparent', 'film', 'were', 'parts', 'felt', 'Yates', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'handle', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'as', 'effectively', 'more', 'experienced', 'director', 'such', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'would', 'were', 'scenes', 'lacked', 'proper', 'intensity', 'scenes', 'ruined', 'credibility', 'medieval-looking', 'fantasy', 'world', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'scene', 'where', 'Filch', 'front', 'Room', 'Requirement', 'wait', 'students', 'leave', 'sitting', 'chair', 'foldable', 'table', 'front', 'thermus', 'top', 'two', 'objects', 'seemed', 'very', 'place', 'dark', 'surreal', 'setting', 'then', 'again', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Yates', 'intention', 'bringing', 'real', 'world', 'Hogwarts', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'trio', 'arrive', 'Hogwarts', 'are', 'seated', 'Great', 'Hall', 'here', 'Dumbledore', 'speech', 'handled', 'too', 'much', 'mundane', 'way', 'other', 'films', 'prior', 'Dumbledore', 'speech', 'marked', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'Hogwarts', 'here', 'became', 'too', 'routine', 'slightly', 'boring', 'Luckily', 'was', 'something', 'Yates', 'realized', 'fixed', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'where', 'gave', 'Dumbledore', 'proper', 'close-up', 'deserved', 'as', 'well', 'moving', 'metallic', 'owl', 'mark', 'beginning', 'foreboding', 'speech', 'up', 'side', 'Yates', 'amazing', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'great', 'work', 'here', 'opinion', 'was', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'develop', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'strong', 'themes', 'good', 'evil', 'scenes', 'where', 'Harry', 'having', 'internal', 'struggles', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'brought', 'mind', 'classic', 'films', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', 'When', 'Voldemort', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'physically', 'be', 'more', 'psychological', 'showdown', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'fact', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'left', 'extremely', 'satisfied', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'most', 'importand', 'aspect', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'book', 'was', 'adapted', 'masterfully', 'onscreen', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Maybe', 'know', 'Yates', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'effectively', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'me.I', 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'children', 'entertainment', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'thought-provoking', 'powerful']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651125,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005JPI2,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","As with all the Harry Potter movies, it takes awhile for someone who has read the books over and over to adjust to the things that are left out. But also as with all the others, the cutting was neatly done. I won't bother to mention what is left out, but concentrate on what is in.We start with an attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley (yes, a muggle) by a pair of dementors. What the heck are dementors doing in Little Winging? Really good question, since they're all supposed to be at Azkaban, guarding the prisoners. That there is a massive breakout of convicted death eaters later in the movie suggests that something is very wrong indeed with Azkaban. Has the Ministry of Magic lost control? If so, who has gained it? Voldemort?Anyway, the Order of the Phoenix rescues Harry from Little Winging and takes him to their headquarters in London, a house Sirius Black inherited from his family. There's a family tree tapestry that has several burn marks on it, including where Sirius' entry was. We don't get much chance to see the rest of the tree, though. And Creature has only a very minor role.Harry discovers that the Daily Prophet has been cooperating with Cornelius Fudge in a campaign to blacken Harry's and Dumbledore's names, apparently because Fudge is worried that Dumbledore is raising an army to fight the Ministry because Dumbledore wants his job. That's nonsense, of course, although there eventually is a ""Dumbledore's Army"" in mocking response to Fudge's paranoia.There are a lot of sub-plots that are somewhat distracting, but they are all there for a reason. Harry's infatuation with Cho Chang, for example, becomes important when she [not her friend, as in the book] betrays the DA under veritaserum interrogation. And Hagrid is missing the first semester, but that becomes significant because he brings back his half-brother Grawp, who ends up being more significant to the elimination of Dolores Umbridge than he had in the book.Dolores Umbridge is the most obnoxious Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the school has ever had, which is saying something. She is what we used to call a pink and black witch. In fact, I don't recall that she ever wore robes like the other teachers. She wore pink fluffy things, mostly very silly-looking stuff. She talks in a high-pitched kindergarten teacher voice, and is enormously silly. But she is vicious, really vicious. I will leave it to the movie to express just how vicious she can be.Since Umbridge will not teach DADA correctly (she has them copying a beginner's book three times, so that they remember it, but does not teach any real spells), Hermione persuades Harry to teach those who want to learn for real, and creates the DA: Dumbledore's Army, named to mock Cornelius Fudge's paranoia. They discover the Room of Requirement, and learn a great deal until Umbridge discovers them and puts them out.Then there are Harry's dreams, and something which is more than a dream for him. He dreams about Mr. Weasley being attacked by a large snake, but he's aware of a point of view that suggests he IS the snake in the dream. When he wakes up, he wastes no time reporting this to Dumbledore, who moves fast to investigate through the portraits of former headmasters in his office, who can visit other portraits of themselves elsewhere and report back to Dumbledore within minutes. One goes to the Order's headquarters one to the Ministry, and then to the hospital where Mr. Weasley is taken after he is discovered in the Ministry, badly injured.But then Harry starts dreaming of other things, chiefly a closed door in the Ministry of Magic, and a long black corridor, and eventually a room full of glass globes. Finally, he dreams that Sirius Black is in that room and being tortured. He decides to go to London to rescue Sirius, and several members of the DA insist on coming along: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna Lovegood. And without going into detail, they recover the prophecy (that's what those glass globes were) that relates to Harry and Voldemort, and they fight the death eaters who show up with Voldemort to try to get the prophecy back from them. Then members of the Order of the Phoenix show up, and fight the death eaters, too. Sirius is killed in the process, by Bella Lastrange. [Who, by the way, looks nothing like what I imagined her, but is very effective.] Finally, Dumbledore shows up and fights Voldemort to the point where he is vanquished - not killed, but vanquished.It's a terrific movie, possibly the best of the series so far.

You would get the same exact people saying, ""oh this movie is tooooo long.  Why didn't they make it shorter?""  What do you people want, a 7 hr, movie?  If this were a mini-series we would get the spectaular scenes on the big screen, & they wouldn't make such an impact.  Ok, so maybe they could have added a scene or 2 of Quiddich just to give Rupert something more to do.  For all the critics saying the film was too dark,,(Ebert...who I respect as a critic,)what did you expect after the main villain of the books returns?  The dark tone of the movie is one thing I really enjoyed about this film.  No more cutesy, obnoxious stuff for the kiddies.  The performances, especially from the newcomers, are all incredible.  The actress who plays Umbridge steals every scene she is in.  Plus how did they find somebody who plays Luna so brilliantly?  For those who were panning Gambon's performance in Goblet, I think they will be suprised.  Even Dan gets his 15 minutes.  If I had to give a few complaint of this film it's that I would have liked to see Harry go at it with Dumbledore in his office.  Him talking just like he's saying ""nice day, isn't it?"" just didn't work for me.  It's like he didn't care his Godfather just died.  Plus, perhaps show the little fight with Harry & Bellatrix.  She just killed Harry's Godfather, there should be more to it than what there was.  Speaking of Sirius, the relationship between he & Harry just didn't work for me.  But I blame Newell for this, not Yates.  Yates did what he could to fix that mistake.  Finally, the possession scene looked like something that came out of The Exorcist rather than a HP movie.

651149,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005JPI2,Bookphile,"[6, 7]","I've been a rabid fan of Harry Potter for years now, ever since the imminent release of the first movie inspired me to start reading the books. That is a telling statement right there, in that I have always been the sort of person who prefers the book to the movie.  Yet with this particular movie, I may even have enjoyed the movie more than the book.  Of the seven books in the series, OotP is on the low end as far as which books I enjoyed the most.  As for the movie version, I found it dazzling.David Yates is the director for which this amazing series has been searching.  While Columbus's first two were cute (sometimes too cute) and imaginative, Cuaron's story-driven focus on the third was very well-done, and Newell's streamlined fourth was well acted with poor effects, Yates's vision of the fifth novel was exactly as I imagined everything in my head.  His pacing of the story was superb and his use of the rotating Daily Prophet headlines to propel the plot was frankly ingenious.  There is a lot of meat to the novel and Yates ensures that the plot is coherent and none of the important details are left out but does so in a very efficient manner.  Instead, he saves the lengthier scenes for the heart of the story and Harry's internal conflicts are given just as much play as his external conflicts.  Harry sometimes comes across as surly in the book but Yates did a wonderful job of portraying Harry's normal adolescent frustrations coupled with his dangerous position in the wizarding world.  Though the ending sequence in the Ministry of Magic was trimmed, it was simply stunning.  I can't say enough good things about Yates and I was ecstatic to hear that he will also be directing ""Half-Blood Prince"".  This is a real boon to Rowling as it is such a pivotal novel.  She will have a director who will do it right.There is also a great deal to be said about the acting.  One of the great strengths of this franchise is that the same actors have been with it all along (with the exception of the late Richard Harris).  It's been a thrill to watch the child actors grow and it really helps to keep me into the story given that one of the central themes of the novels is the evolution of these characters.  While I have always liked Radcliffe, he is simply phenomenal in this movie.  It's almost possible to physically feel Harry's reactions because Radcliffe imbues them with such obvious and yet restrained passion.  Another of the phenomenal acting treasures is the wonderful Evanna Lynch who is pitch perfect as Luna Lovegood.  Lynch is truly a talent and I loved every moment of watching her bring the character to life.  I look very forward to seeing more of her in future Potter films.  Alan Rickman is wonderful as usual and always leaves the viewer wanting more of Snape.  Imelda Staunton made Umbridge delightfully creepy.  Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary as Voldemort and sends a shiver down my spine whenever he's onscreen.The true strength of this movie is that it's character-driven, just as it was always meant by Rowling to be.  Yes there is a central plot that is important.  But what is really important is Harry's growth and development.  Throughout his life he has had to make many tough choices and his decisions aren't always the best but that is the point.  Harry learns from his mistakes and it is his choices that shape him as a character.  Rather than make a flashy movie about wizards casting lots of cool spells, Yates has let this theme shine through.  As in the books, in the end it all comes down to Harry's humanity.  The spells and objects and magical creatures are all just frill.  The real heart of the story is Harry's coming of age.",5,The best of the HP movies yet,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,3683,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'rabid', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'years', 'now', 'ever', 'imminent', 'release', 'first', 'movie', 'inspired', 'start', 'reading', 'books', 'telling', 'statement', 'right', 'there', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'book', 'movie', 'particular', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'book', 'seven', 'books', 'series', 'OotP', 'low', 'end', 'as', 'far', 'books', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movie', 'version', 'found', 'dazzling.David', 'director', 'amazing', 'series', 'been', 'searching', 'Columbus', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'cute', 'sometimes', 'too', 'cute', 'imaginative', 'Cuaron', 'story-driven', 'focus', 'third', 'was', 'very', 'well-done', 'Newell', 'streamlined', 'fourth', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'poor', 'effects', 'Yates', 'vision', 'fifth', 'novel', 'was', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'everything', 'head', 'pacing', 'story', 'was', 'superb', 'use', 'rotating', 'Daily', 'Prophet', 'headlines', 'propel', 'plot', 'was', 'frankly', 'ingenious', 'lot', 'meat', 'novel', 'ensures', 'plot', 'coherent', 'none', 'important', 'details', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'very', 'efficient', 'manner', 'Instead', 'lengthier', 'scenes', 'heart', 'story', 'Harry', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'are', 'given', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'play', 'external', 'conflicts', 'Harry', 'sometimes', 'surly', 'book', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Harry', 'normal', 'adolescent', 'frustrations', 'coupled', 'dangerous', 'position', 'wizarding', 'world', 'ending', 'sequence', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'was', 'trimmed', 'was', 'simply', 'stunning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Yates', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'hear', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'directing', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'real', 'boon', 'Rowling', 'such', 'pivotal', 'novel', 'will', 'have', 'director', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'right.There', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'said', 'acting', 'One', 'great', 'strengths', 'franchise', 'same', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'exception', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'been', 'thrill', 'watch', 'child', 'actors', 'grow', 'really', 'keep', 'story', 'given', 'one', 'central', 'themes', 'novels', 'evolution', 'characters', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Radcliffe', 'simply', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'almost', 'possible', 'physically', 'feel', 'Harry', 'reactions', 'Radcliffe', 'such', 'obvious', 'yet', 'restrained', 'passion', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'treasures', 'wonderful', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'who', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Lynch', 'truly', 'talent', 'loved', 'moment', 'watching', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'look', 'very', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'future', 'Potter', 'films', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'always', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'Snape', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'made', 'Umbridge', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'extraordinary', 'Voldemort', 'shiver', 'down', 'spine', 'onscreen.The', 'true', 'strength', 'movie', 'character-driven', 'just', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'Rowling', 'be', 'central', 'plot', 'important', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'Harry', 'growth', 'development', 'life', 'had', 'make', 'many', 'tough', 'choices', 'decisions', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'point', 'Harry', 'mistakes', 'choices', 'shape', 'character', 'Rather', 'make', 'flashy', 'movie', 'wizards', 'casting', 'lots', 'cool', 'spells', 'let', 'theme', 'shine', 'through', 'books', 'end', 'down', 'Harry', 'humanity', 'spells', 'objects', 'magical', 'creatures', 'are', 'just', 'frill', 'real', 'heart', 'story', 'Harry', 'coming', 'age']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651154,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPI2,Caleb Williams,"[3, 3]","Now let me be honest from the start and say that I've only read the first 4 Harry Potter books and have never really been interested in the rest. I must also be honest and say I've only ever really been a casual fan of the films, not getting overly excited about the upcoming release, nor being somewhat ashamed of even saying ""oh that looks good."" I simply ended up watching Order of the Phoenix on a whim and I must say I found it very enjoyable. The combination of the hidden magic world and believable characters, really allow the film to blend into one hell of a two hour ride.Harry's fifth year as a wizard doesn't start too well, he and Dudley are attacked by dementors which leads to Harry being expelled from Hogwarts. Through a series of random, craziness Harry discovers that Dumbledore is putting together an army to help fight Voldemorts army. The Order of the Phoenix involve the likes of Azkaban runaway Sirius Black, Godfather of Harry Potter and Sirius Black. The Ministry of Magic are the biggest problem facing the order at the moment as Dumbledore and Harry are constantly attacked in the daily prophet for spreading lies. The Ministry are in denial that the Dark Lord Voldemort is back and in order to stop the rumours, they must take Dumbledores power and remove him as Hogwarts headmaster. In his place is the old fashioned and quite evil Professor Delores Umbridge. She, like the ministry seems in complete denial about the dark lords return and seeks to bring order to Hogwarts. Harry on the other hand decides he must take teaching into his own hands and puts together his own army of students and prepares them for the impending war.I have to be honest and say Radcliffe has once again really pulled it off as a genuine actor. Although the Harry Potter label will stick with him forever, he continues to display genuine acting talent within the role. The supporting best friends of Emma Watson (Hermione) & Rupert Grint (Ron) provide the general emotional guidance that helps keep Harry going. Personally I found the Delores Umbridge character to be the more intimidating of characters from this year, she has the ability of being a bit too sweet giving the image that you know there's something more going on. She demands order, she wants peace without possibility of injury so she bans all magic in the classroom and insists all theory work is the correct way to teach wizardry. Well played part by Imelda Staunton.The special effects are as usual astonishing, they allow the truly magical Potter world to come alive. The Centaurs, Giants and general magical fights can only be done through the magic of computer animation and are simply flawless. There wasn't a single moment where I spotted a faulty special effect with which I could say ""that's done by computers."" If it did have that effect on someone then there's no denying it would have ruined the entire effect of the film.I do want to point something out and it's something that has been talked about time and time again. It's the darkness of the film, for a book aimed at kids the stories tend to get more and more adult as time progresses. This is a good thing for the older fan of the books, but isn't something I would really say should be seen by kids as they would possibly find it a bit terrifying. It's an amazing, honest and enjoyable picture that although there will be the complaints of cutting down too much from the book, I have no doubt that it's still a film the loyal book fans will thoroughly enjoy.",4,"Nothing Amazing, But Still Great",1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,3504,"['Now', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'start', 'say', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'first', '4', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'interested', 'rest', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'honest', 'say', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'really', 'been', 'casual', 'fan', 'films', 'not', 'getting', 'overly', 'excited', 'upcoming', 'release', 'being', 'somewhat', 'ashamed', 'even', 'saying', 'good', 'simply', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'whim', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'combination', 'hidden', 'magic', 'world', 'believable', 'characters', 'really', 'allow', 'film', 'blend', 'one', 'hell', 'two', 'hour', 'ride.Harry', 'fifth', 'year', 'wizard', ""n't"", 'start', 'too', 'well', 'Dudley', 'are', 'attacked', 'dementors', 'Harry', 'being', 'expelled', 'Hogwarts', 'series', 'random', 'craziness', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'putting', 'together', 'army', 'help', 'fight', 'Voldemorts', 'army', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'involve', 'likes', 'Azkaban', 'runaway', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Godfather', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'are', 'biggest', 'problem', 'facing', 'order', 'moment', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'are', 'constantly', 'attacked', 'daily', 'prophet', 'spreading', 'lies', 'Ministry', 'are', 'denial', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'back', 'order', 'stop', 'rumours', 'must', 'take', 'Dumbledores', 'power', 'remove', 'Hogwarts', 'headmaster', 'place', 'old', 'fashioned', 'quite', 'evil', 'Professor', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'ministry', 'complete', 'denial', 'dark', 'lords', 'return', 'bring', 'order', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'other', 'hand', 'decides', 'must', 'take', 'teaching', 'own', 'hands', 'together', 'own', 'army', 'students', 'impending', 'war.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'Radcliffe', 'once', 'again', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'genuine', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'label', 'will', 'stick', 'forever', 'display', 'genuine', 'acting', 'talent', 'role', 'supporting', 'best', 'friends', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Hermione', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'provide', 'general', 'emotional', 'guidance', 'keep', 'Harry', 'going', 'Personally', 'found', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'intimidating', 'characters', 'year', 'ability', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'sweet', 'giving', 'image', 'know', 'something', 'more', 'going', 'order', 'peace', 'possibility', 'injury', 'magic', 'classroom', 'theory', 'work', 'correct', 'way', 'teach', 'wizardry', 'Well', 'part', 'Imelda', 'Staunton.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'usual', 'astonishing', 'allow', 'truly', 'magical', 'Potter', 'world', 'come', 'alive', 'Centaurs', 'Giants', 'general', 'magical', 'fights', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'done', 'magic', 'computer', 'animation', 'are', 'simply', 'flawless', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'moment', 'where', 'spotted', 'faulty', 'special', 'effect', 'could', 'say', 'done', 'computers', 'did', 'have', 'effect', 'someone', 'then', 'denying', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'entire', 'effect', 'film.I', 'do', 'want', 'point', 'something', 'something', 'been', 'talked', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'darkness', 'film', 'book', 'aimed', 'kids', 'stories', 'tend', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'adult', 'time', 'good', 'thing', 'older', 'fan', 'books', ""n't"", 'something', 'would', 'really', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'kids', 'would', 'possibly', 'find', 'bit', 'terrifying', 'amazing', 'honest', 'enjoyable', 'picture', 'will', 'be', 'complaints', 'cutting', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'book', 'have', 'doubt', 'still', 'film', 'loyal', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Although I love the charm and innocence of the first couple movies, I respect the maturing and depth shown in the last two. In this movie we get to see good fight evil in a match up that is leading to the final great confrontation. It is quite clear sides are being formed based on loyalties to good or evil magic. The armies may not be large, but they are formidable. The introduction of a new creature was a nice touch, but the main theme is friendship. These undead looking horses with bat like wings that can only be seen by those that have witnessed death are friendly and play a key part in helping Harry. It is Harry's friendships that have now bonded those ties to fight Lord Valdemort and his allies. Initially we see that Ron and Hermione are still very much in Harry's corner.Harry isn't just preparing to fight Valdemort, he is fighting his own demons that make him wonder why the commonality of his life and that of Valdemort. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel when several school members join him to train in magic to fight Valdemort. Unfortunately they must hide in order to practice since the professor of the Defense Against the Dark Arts has taken over Hogwarts and forbidden the use of defensive magic. That's right I said the defense against the dark arts. There's irony for you. She is truly the worst person to have on your side if you are trying to prepare an Army to fight the dark lord. Fortunately Neville finds them a place to practice to get out of eyeshot of the puritanical pompous peacock in pink called Dalores Umbridge. I think she was the worst kind of muggle in sheeps clothing. She obviously doesn't believe the dark lord has returned, nor that they need to use magic. Does that sound like a professor you could learn from at Hogwarts? NOT!I enjoyed the movie on a number of levels. I think they have done a great job with how Harry has grown not only in age, but in attitude. The central theme of friendship is remarkably comparable how students feel when preparing to graduate high school. The same type of struggles they face when dealing with how to choose whether to lead a life of good or evil. I recommend it whether you have read the book or not. I think if you have read the book you will need to be tolerant of the parts that have not been included. I must admit I wish the movie had been a little longer and included a few parts pointed out by some of those that read the book.

Order of the Phoenix however is very different. It's more of the 'bare skin' version. The 'bones' if you will- the true story- is completely lost in this film. The visual side is wonderful- the characters are great- the sets are spot on (thus the two stars) but the storyline is truly trash. What should have been a very powerful story of Harry finally taking up arms against Voldemort is turned into a messed up action movie with almost no followable storyline. Virtually ALL the key elements that gave the entire book substance are not even 'improperly done'- they're just completely left out. Even when you watch the deleted scenes and behind the scenes on the bonus disk- it's as if the entire interview ensemble  are aimed at people who were too lazy to read the books or too dumb to follow the story. It's a bunch of adults acting like they're talking down to simple minded viewers. If a person watching the movie is one that's never picked up a book- they're simply there to think the movie is 'finally getting good' because of special effects and spell flinging. But the ilk that would actually READ and LOVE Harry Potter are not simpletons- they're literate kids AND adults and shouldn't have to be softly spoken to as if the finer points of the entire series are lost to them.I want to LOVE every Harry Potter movie the way I LOVE the books- and so far it's been a fulfilling and great experience to see the movies (no matter what they've had to leave out) but this is just a horrible adaptation of J.K.'s books. I can only assume that the screen writer, Michael Goldenberg,is who's truly to blame.If you've been putting off reading the books and strictly relying on the movies to follow the epic story of Harry Potter- this is a prime time to pick up the true version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the BOOK) and figure out all that you've missed by watching this wretchedly hollow interpretation. And as the 'bonus disk' is treated with so much recap nonsense and fluff that only a five year old would find acceptable (every 'bonus' is either done like an episode of Elmo meets: or softly speaking adults who act as if they're talking to either toddlers or an elderly person on their deathbed who can't focus long enough to watch a movie)- only buy the core version if you feel the NEED to own all the Harry Potter movies.",2,The worst movie of the greatest series.,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,2486,"['other', 'Potter', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'stripped', 'down', ""'bare"", 'bones', 'versions', 'incredible', 'book', 'series', 'same', 'names', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'however', 'very', 'different', 'more', ""'bare"", 'skin', 'version', ""'bones"", 'will-', 'true', 'story-', 'completely', 'lost', 'film', 'visual', 'side', 'wonderful-', 'characters', 'are', 'great-', 'sets', 'are', 'spot', 'thus', 'two', 'stars', 'storyline', 'truly', 'trash', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'powerful', 'story', 'Harry', 'finally', 'taking', 'up', 'arms', 'Voldemort', 'turned', 'messed', 'up', 'action', 'movie', 'almost', 'followable', 'storyline', 'Virtually', 'key', 'elements', 'gave', 'entire', 'book', 'substance', 'are', 'not', 'even', ""'improperly"", ""done'-"", ""'re"", 'just', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'Even', 'when', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'disk-', 'entire', 'interview', 'ensemble', 'are', 'aimed', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'too', 'lazy', 'read', 'books', 'too', 'dumb', 'follow', 'story', 'bunch', 'adults', 'acting', ""'re"", 'talking', 'down', 'simple', 'minded', 'viewers', 'person', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'book-', ""'re"", 'simply', 'there', 'think', 'movie', ""'finally"", 'getting', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'spell', 'flinging', 'ilk', 'would', 'actually', 'READ', 'LOVE', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'are', 'not', 'simpletons-', ""'re"", 'literate', 'kids', 'adults', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'softly', 'spoken', 'finer', 'points', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'lost', 'them.I', 'want', 'LOVE', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'way', 'LOVE', 'books-', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'fulfilling', 'great', 'experience', 'see', 'movies', 'matter', 'what', ""'ve"", 'had', 'leave', 'out', 'just', 'horrible', 'adaptation', 'J.K.', 'books', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'screen', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Goldenberg', 'who', 'truly', 'blame.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'reading', 'books', 'strictly', 'relying', 'movies', 'follow', 'epic', 'story', 'Harry', 'Potter-', 'prime', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'true', 'version', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'BOOK', 'figure', 'out', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'watching', 'wretchedly', 'hollow', 'interpretation', ""'bonus"", 'disk', 'treated', 'so', 'much', 'recap', 'nonsense', 'fluff', 'only', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'find', 'acceptable', ""'bonus"", 'done', 'episode', 'Elmo', 'meets', 'softly', 'speaking', 'adults', 'who', 'act', ""'re"", 'talking', 'toddlers', 'elderly', 'person', 'deathbed', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'focus', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'buy', 'core', 'version', 'feel', 'NEED', 'own', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

One of these, indeed, occurs even before term starts up, as he finds himself obliged to defend both himself and his Muggle cousin Dudley Dursley (harry Melling) from a couple of Dementors (whose presence is never fully explained)--which lands him on trial before a jury of his (adult) peers.  It also develops that the Ministry of Magic, headed by bureaucrat Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is unwilling to publicly admit that Lord Voldemort has regained his body and is making a second try at power.  The politics of this fact soon penetrate even unto the hallowed halls of Hogwarts as Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is wished upon the institution as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor--and not only refuses to teach anything useful but seems to take it as her mission in life to persecute Harry.  (That she genuinely believes she's in the right and that the ends justify the means could serve as a good lead-in to some important discussion with your kids, which is probably exactly why J. K. Rowling created her.)  Harry finds himself, somewhat reluctantly, forced to organize a clandestine class in magical self-defense, in which Hogwarts itself seems to support him even though caretaker Filch (David Bradley) and (expectably) most of Slytherin House don't.  He's also experiencing frightening dreams that lead him to believe his mind is somehow linked with Voldemort's.  More than any of the previous movies, this one is a story about loyalty, principles, and choices--just the kinds of subjects that become very real to kids of Harry's age.",4,Making tougher choices,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1657,"['fifth', 'year', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'faced', 'harder', 'choices', 'tougher', 'tasks', 'One', 'indeed', 'occurs', 'even', 'term', 'up', 'obliged', 'defend', 'Muggle', 'cousin', 'Dudley', 'Dursley', 'harry', 'Melling', 'couple', 'Dementors', 'presence', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'trial', 'jury', 'adult', 'peers', 'also', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'headed', 'bureaucrat', 'Cornelius', 'Fudge', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'unwilling', 'publicly', 'admit', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'regained', 'body', 'making', 'second', 'try', 'power', 'politics', 'fact', 'soon', 'penetrate', 'even', 'hallowed', 'halls', 'Hogwarts', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'wished', 'institution', 'new', 'Defense', 'Against', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'instructor', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'anything', 'useful', 'take', 'mission', 'life', 'persecute', 'Harry', 'genuinely', 'right', 'ends', 'justify', 'means', 'could', 'serve', 'good', 'lead-in', 'important', 'discussion', 'kids', 'probably', 'exactly', 'why', 'J.', 'K.', 'Rowling', 'created', 'Harry', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'forced', 'organize', 'clandestine', 'class', 'magical', 'self-defense', 'Hogwarts', 'support', 'even', 'caretaker', 'Filch', 'David', 'Bradley', 'expectably', 'most', 'Slytherin', 'House', 'do', ""n't"", 'also', 'experiencing', 'frightening', 'dreams', 'lead', 'believe', 'mind', 'somehow', 'linked', 'Voldemort', 'More', 'previous', 'movies', 'one', 'story', 'loyalty', 'principles', 'choices', 'just', 'kinds', 'subjects', 'become', 'very', 'real', 'kids', 'Harry', 'age']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651164,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPI2,Chris Pandolfi,"[19, 23]","At the very end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" Emma Watson says, ""Everything's going to change now, isn't it?"" I remembered that quote going into ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of the series; the films have greatly changed, especially in terms of heavy-handed subject matter. Not only is this film even darker than the last, it's also more mature. This is somewhat disappointing, but it is to be expected; the main characters, after all, are now fifteen years old. I have to admit that I was ready to give this film a lower ranking, simply because it lacks the bright, whimsical charm of Chris Columbus' brilliant ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" But then I realized that I was unfairly trying to compare two very different films. On its own, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is an incredibly well made fantasy film--well written, well acted, and great to look at, all while retaining the essence of J.K. Rowling's novel.The plot, while a bit complicated, is quite engrossing. In his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) will find that the odds against him are increasing. It begins when he's put on trail for breaking the rules and using magic outside of school (he had to save his cousin from a Dementor). Cornelius Fudge, the Head of the Ministry of Magic (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Harry never witnessed Lord Voldemort's resurrection. He also believes that he and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) are conspiring to take control of the Ministry. In response to this, Fudge gives the Ministry the power to enforce new rules at Hogwarts, rules so strict and unreasonable that they practically become dictatorial.As part of the regime change, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is introduced (as they have been in each of the films). Here enters Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a woman that truly redefines what it means to be the teacher from hell. She oversees a complete overhaul of Hogwarts' policies, from dress codes to class schedules to curriculums. Even social interaction is highly restricted, as seen when a kissing couple is forcefully separated. Her uncompromising attitude is only made worse when joined with bright smiles, girlish giggles, and frilly pink dresses. This woman is incredibly phony, a ruthless, seething control freak who unfairly demands respect and loyalty. Harry understands this all too well; while in detention, he's forced to write sentences with a special quill. Let's just say that it makes a definite impression.Fearing that their defensive skills aren't being challenged enough--and fearing that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is nearing--Harry and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) secretly form a rebellion of sorts. Harry teaches the students a number of spells, hoping to prepare them for battle with Voldemort's army. The youthful passion and naivety is just as fascinating as it is baffling; a group of teenagers are willing to fight against evil, even if they don't have what it takes. Of course, no one understands this more than Harry, who begins to have terrible dreams and disturbing visions directly related to Voldemort. Unfortunately, Professor Dumbledore is of little help; for as yet unknown reasons, he's been avoiding Harry the entire school year.The film progresses quite smoothly for something so convoluted. Consider the fact that the students still maintain social relationships while all this is going on. For Harry, a teenage romance between him and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) is alluded to, as is a strong bond with Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric yet understanding young girl. His enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), remains a force to be reckoned with. But his connection to Ron and Hermione has and always will be the strongest. It was a pleasure to see them continue to develop, both as friends and as individuals. There's a moment when Hermione says, ""It's quite exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?"" ""Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"" is Ron's reply, which I found amusing. Up until then, he only knew her as a perfect student, always keeping her nose stuck in a textbook, flaunting her intelligence to both students and professors.As with all the other ""Harry Potter"" films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" features a number of well-established British actors. These include: Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, and Jason Isaacs also reprise their roles. Helena Bonham Carter joins the cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' evil Death Eater cousin. All add dimension to the story without becoming overbearing, which is good because room was needed for special effects, all of which are incredible.Yes, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a top-notch movie, despite its dark tone. Having read the sixth book, I can only say that the next film adaptation will be even darker, which may be problematic for some viewers. Many--myself included--have to accept that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film has long since developed into something denser, less innocent. But in no way does it lack any of the imagination or style that brought the original story to life. This is a thoroughly entertaining film, full of magic and surging with energy.",5,The Magic is Maturing,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,5533,"['very', 'end', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Emma',

Benz ""CJB""","[2, 2]","As of yet, I haven't read this or any other Harry Potter novel, so I'm reviewing this movie purely as a movie and without any prior knowledge. I can whole hardheartedly say that on that level... it succeeds completely.I don't think it'll surprise anyone to hear that if you haven't seen the other films or read the novels presumably, then this film will be basically incomprehensible. One of the powerful aspects of the Harry Potter phenomenon is the increasing complexity, both in terms of plot, themes and complex world building that the franchise has to offer.This film offers a resoundingly superb, no holds barred 3rd act turning point to the whole series. The stakes are at the highest they've yet been. There is even time for some poignant teen angst, as if Harry has any time to deal with anything other than the survival of the  entire Wizard realm...  but he manages to squeeze in some gushing 'coming of age' experiences, including his (presumably) first kiss.Imelda Staunton's turn as Dolores Umbridge is one of the most memorable children's fantasy villains I've yet seen. You admire her performance so much that, if you met her in the street, you'd have to hold back from hurling abuse at her; the character is THAT nauseatingly cruel and frustrating to watch. It's a brilliant performance.Michael Gambon has finally settled into the Dumbledore role and is managing to portray some of the dotty, brilliant tenderness from Richard Harris's performance. This time, he really got to me and I've got to admit, his kick ass performance in the wizard duel with Voldemort would surely surpass Harris for physicality. It's a powerful interpretation, more outwardly canny than Harris's and he's now made it his own.Speaking of Voldemort, how good is Ralph Fiennes? He seems to relish the very heart of evil that he inhabits in this role with a despicable, almost erotic interpretation that is a miracle to behold. As he showed in Schindler's List, Fiennes can lift the performance of a villain to a work of art - horrifying and completely unexpected. He makes no concession to being in a 'children's story' whatsoever.Gary Oldman finally makes Sirius Black a powerful emotional presence with more solid screen time. Even Alan Rickman's Snape is given some fascinating development in his ever deflated attempts to teach Dark Arts at Hogwarts.And I have to mention Evanna Lynch, who is delightful and enigmatic as Luna Lovegood proving why she won the role over 15,000 other actresses!I've heard people snigger at why the whole world is watching Harry Potter films... well, it's simply because they're so damn good! Of course J K Rowling can take most of the credit. But her premise has been executed as soundly as you could wish for and the themes of magic, evil and growing up are rendered as cleverly and tenderly as one could ever expect from a mass market film. To have gotten the casting so right was a large reason for why the adaptations are so effective.Harry, Hermione and Ron are as steady as ever in their central performances. Radcliffe has somehow managed to keep his ego in check and embody the selfless, troubled soul of Harry Potter. Emma Watson is just perfectly charming and has cleverly portrayed the journey into understanding that books don't hold the answer to everything - her explanation for Cho's conflicted emotions in kissing Harry is hysterical. I enjoyed Rupert Grint particularly in this film too, he was given more voice and perhaps better directed than in the other films. His role in Harry's life is increasingly affecting.Somehow all of these characters, plots and themes have time to effectively breathe, evolve and also somehow effortlessly make sense as a whole adventure.There is action, laughter and tears in great measure here and all portrayed with quality and passion.Can't wait for more...",5,Dark Realms and Wizard Duels - Superb 5th Installment!,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,3836,"['yet', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'other', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'novel', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'movie', 'purely', 'movie', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'can', 'whole', 'hardheartedly', 'say', 'level', 'completely.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'hear', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'read', 'novels', 'presumably', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'basically', 'incomprehensible', 'One', 'powerful', 'aspects', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'phenomenon', 'increasing', 'complexity', 'terms', 'plot', 'themes', 'complex', 'world', 'building', 'franchise', 'offer.This', 'film', 'offers', 'resoundingly', 'superb', 'barred', '3rd', 'act', 'turning', 'point', 'whole', 'series', 'stakes', 'are', 'highest', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'been', 'even', 'time', 'poignant', 'teen', 'angst', 'Harry', 'time', 'deal', 'anything', 'other', 'survival', 'entire', 'Wizard', 'realm', 'squeeze', 'gushing', ""'coming"", 'age', 'experiences', 'including', 'presumably', 'first', 'Staunton', 'turn', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'children', 'fantasy', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'admire', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'met', 'street', ""'d"", 'have', 'hold', 'back', 'hurling', 'abuse', 'character', 'nauseatingly', 'cruel', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'performance.Michael', 'Gambon', 'finally', 'settled', 'Dumbledore', 'role', 'managing', 'portray', 'dotty', 'brilliant', 'tenderness', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'performance', 'time', 'really', 'got', ""'ve"", 'got', 'admit', 'kick', 'ass', 'performance', 'wizard', 'duel', 'Voldemort', 'would', 'surely', 'surpass', 'Harris', 'physicality', 'powerful', 'interpretation', 'more', 'outwardly', 'canny', 'Harris', 'now', 'made', 'own.Speaking', 'Voldemort', 'how', 'good', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'relish', 'very', 'heart', 'evil', 'role', 'despicable', 'almost', 'erotic', 'interpretation', 'miracle', 'behold', 'showed', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Fiennes', 'can', 'lift', 'performance', 'villain', 'work', 'art', 'horrifying', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'concession', 'being', ""'children"", 'story', 'whatsoever.Gary', 'Oldman', 'finally', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'presence', 'more', 'solid', 'screen', 'time', 'Even', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'given', 'fascinating', 'development', 'ever', 'deflated', 'attempts', 'teach', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'Hogwarts.And', 'have', 'mention', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'who', 'delightful', 'enigmatic', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'proving', 'why', 'won', 'role', '15,000', 'other', 'actresses', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'snigger', 'why', 'whole', 'world', 'watching', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'well', 'simply', ""'re"", 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'course', 'J', 'K', 'Rowling', 'can', 'take', 'most', 'credit', 'premise', 'been', 'executed', 'as', 'soundly', 'could', 'wish', 'themes', 'magic', 'evil', 'growing', 'up', 'are', 'rendered', 'cleverly', 'tenderly', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'expect', 'mass', 'market', 'film', 'have', 'gotten', 'casting', 'so', 'right', 'was', 'large', 'reason', 'why', 'adaptations', 'are', 'so', 'effective.Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'are', 'as', 'steady', 'ever', 'central', 'performances', 'Radcliffe', 'somehow', 'managed', 'keep', 'ego', 'check', 'embody', 'selfless', 'troubled', 'soul', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'just', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'cleverly', 'portrayed', 'journey', 'understanding', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'answer', 'everything', 'explanation', 'Cho', 'conflicted', 'emotions', 'kissing', 'Harry', 'hysterical', 'enjoyed', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'particularly', 'film', 'too', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'voice', 'perhaps', 'better', 'directed', 'other', 'films', 'role', 'Harry', 'life', 'increasingly', 'affecting.Somehow', 'characters', 'plots', 'themes', 'have', 'time', 'effectively', 'breathe', 'evolve', 'also', 'somehow', 'effortlessly', 'make', 'sense', 'whole', 'adventure.There', 'action', 'laughter', 'tears', 'great', 'measure', 'here', 'portrayed', 'quality', 'passion.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651173,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPI2,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","One of the things that I always liked about the Harry Potter book series was Rowling's writing, since, while at times simplistic and not as detailed as other fantasy writers, she was able to make it more accessible and reader-friendly as opposed to Tolkien who's one of the more clinical writers and very, shall we say, ""scholarly"" in his writing? However, I found the 5th book, the Order of the Phoenix, the most trying to read since the length didn't translate to pacing and Harry's caps lock-laden outbursts were quite annoying. So while we have the shortest movie based on one of the longest books, it's quite successful at the adapting of it...most of the time.Year 4 ended with Harry Potter being witness to Voldemort's resurrection and upon returning, the Ministry of Magic has been renouncing him and Dumbledore by saving they're all lies. With wizards disappearing and adults who don't want to include him despite his needed involvement, Harry finds the 5th year with an incredibly troublesome teacher, and having to teach his classmates how to protect themselves at what's coming.As far as plot progression goes, Order of the Phoenix is the least advancing of the stories so far since we do find out some things but, with knowledge of how the books end, they're not as substantial and it's the latter books that are the most plot heavy. But the main issue regarding Phoenix is that it's a bit too jumpy with many scenes getting at most a couple of scenes before we're off somewhere. For example, in the book when Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, the book gives us time to settle in and gives some breathing time; here it's a couple of scenes before we're off to Harry's hearing. While yes, the book does cut out some excess, it does so with almost breakneck pace as if someone was timed and had to get in as much as they could before the buzzer rang.However, the actors are more confident in the roles with several big name British actors such as Imelda Staunton nailing the perfect Umbridge as well as Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon still doing fine work. And while castmates Rupert Grint and Emma Watson feel even more""supporting character mode"" than ever, Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at doing that frustration of being too old to shrug off responsibility while being too young to ignore it without being a big crybaby like he was in the books (man I wanted to smack him when I was reading). The scene stealer is Evanna Lynch who probably does the perfect Luna Lovegood and the book's best new character was thankfully the best cast as well.With its exciting finale complete with some of the best effect work the series has had (but Grawp, the big giant is bad; not Scorpion King bad but still), the film may not be the best Potter but it's still an enjoyable watch anyway.",4,It's a kind of (flawed) magic,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,2810,"['One', 'things', 'always', 'liked', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'Rowling', 'writing', 'times', 'simplistic', 'not', 'as', 'detailed', 'other', 'fantasy', 'writers', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'reader-friendly', 'opposed', 'Tolkien', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'clinical', 'writers', 'very', 'shall', 'say', 'scholarly', 'writing', 'However', 'found', '5th', 'book', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'most', 'trying', 'read', 'length', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'pacing', 'Harry', 'caps', 'lock-laden', 'outbursts', 'were', 'quite', 'annoying', 'So', 'have', 'shortest', 'movie', 'based', 'one', 'longest', 'books', 'quite', 'successful', 'adapting', 'most', 'time.Year', '4', 'ended', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'being', 'witness', 'Voldemort', 'resurrection', 'returning', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'been', 'renouncing', 'Dumbledore', 'saving', ""'re"", 'lies', 'wizards', 'disappearing', 'adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'needed', 'involvement', 'Harry', '5th', 'year', 'incredibly', 'troublesome', 'teacher', 'having', 'teach', 'how', 'protect', 'what', 'coming.As', 'far', 'plot', 'progression', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'least', 'advancing', 'stories', 'so', 'far', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'knowledge', 'how', 'books', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'substantial', 'latter', 'books', 'are', 'most', 'plot', 'heavy', 'main', 'issue', 'regarding', 'Phoenix', 'bit', 'too', 'jumpy', 'many', 'scenes', 'getting', 'most', 'couple', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'off', 'somewhere', 'example', 'book', 'when', 'Harry', '12', 'Grimmauld', 'Place', 'book', 'time', 'settle', 'breathing', 'time', 'here', 'couple', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'Harry', 'hearing', 'yes', 'book', 'cut', 'out', 'excess', 'so', 'almost', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'someone', 'was', 'timed', 'had', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'before', 'buzzer', 'rang.However', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'confident', 'roles', 'several', 'big', 'name', 'British', 'actors', 'such', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'nailing', 'perfect', 'Umbridge', 'as', 'well', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'still', 'doing', 'fine', 'work', 'castmates', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'supporting', 'character', 'mode', 'ever', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'frustration', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'shrug', 'off', 'responsibility', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'ignore', 'being', 'big', 'crybaby', 'was', 'books', 'man', 'wanted', 'smack', 'when', 'was', 'reading', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'who', 'probably', 'perfect', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'book', 'best', 'new', 'character', 'was', 'thankfully', 'best', 'cast', 'well.With', 'exciting', 'finale', 'complete', 'best', 'effect', 'work', 'series', 'had', 'Grawp', 'big', 'giant', 'bad', 'not', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'bad', 'still', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Potter', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'anyway']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651176,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005JPI2,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 2]","If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying.The Order of the Phoenix isn't simply the exciting adventure, tinged with a bit of mystery and dread, that the other books and films were. With this one, the angst, worry and danger move front and center. The movie still works as entertainment, however, because it's not a stand-alone film. Those who may try to judge the relative worth of any one of the books or films needs to take into account that Harry Potter is one story, and each story in each book or movie builds on all the others before it. For me, trying to figure which is the ""best"" book or film would be like trying to determine which bite of pumpkin pie was most satisfying, the third bite, the fourth bite or the first bite.The movies, especially this one, do provide one satisfaction that the books can't. Before our eyes, literally, Harry Potter and his friends are growing up, changing from children to young men and women. We see it happen because all the original young actors, who must have signed long-term contracts or are getting a great deal of money to sign up picture by picture, also are growing up before our eyes. Harry Potter is now a young man because Daniel Radcliffe is becoming a young man. Hermione Granger's growing maturity is because Emma Watson is growing in maturity. It's odd in a pleasurable way to see small Neville Longbottom now towering over Harry, just as Mathew Lewis now towers over Radcliffe.Rowling's books are so good, and the movies are so accomplished as good cinema, that the ""Oh, no, I'd never read those Potter stories"" reaction set in sometime ago and is still prevalent among some. There is a category of individuals who automatically react condescendingly to anything which achieves great popular success. This isn't intellectual prejudice. Those who enjoy things of the mind - intellectuals - are driven as much by curiosity as by an appreciation of what rigorous things a mind can deliver. Those, however, who shiver in delight at Sondheim and only smile indulgently at Berlin, who swoon over Updike but find Dickens just adequate, who condescend to Rowling but preen over Goddard, miss the point: A good mind, a fine intellect, a curious person can find pleasure and value in all of the above. Why? Because they're all good at what they do. Intellectual appreciation of good work isn't a zero sum game.See the Potter movies, including this one, and be touched and entertained. Read the Potter books, including this one, and be touched and taught.",4,"Get to know Harry Potter, his friends and teachers, first in the books, then enjoy the movies.

Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeasurably as an actor, as have the other younger cast members, and John Williams' score has never sounded so fitting or so possessing. A strong balance was struck in this outing between atmospheric visuals and dialogue, something sometimes unreached in the last four Harry Potter movies, despite the fact that they, too, were classics. The final sequence wherein Dumbledore and Voldemort wage a wizards' battle was a special effects tsunami that swept aside all disbelief and left everyone I know convinced that should they ever truly witness two wizards in combat, it would look exactly like that!

Hamlow,"[3, 5]","As Hermione Granger spoke at the end of the Goblet of Fire, things weren't going to be the same at Hogwarts with the reemergence of Voldemort, the Dark Wizard who murdered Harry Potter's parents and was twice defeated (q.v. the first two movies).  Order of the Phoenix confirms Ms. Granger's words.  In it, the wizarding world has been torn apart between those who believe that Voldemort has returned, and the majority under Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge who has gone from being a pleasant but ineffective fuddy-duddy to a paranoid trying to hold onto power, thinking Dumbledore is using Voldemort as an excuse to rallying an army of supporters to overthrow him.Harry finds support in his usual circle of the red-headed Weasleys and Hermione Granger, but he also gains an ally in the loopy Luna Lovegood, a blonde girl who seems to be in her own world, dreamily speaking of charms against nurgles--presumably the wizarding equivalent of gremlins, and who like Harry, can see certain creatures.  She also skips down the corridors like a little girl--quite a character, that one.  But he starts to have a bit of an attitude, extremely trimmed down from the book, where he was very vitriolic at times.  Whether it's being a bit irritated at Ron or speaking out his mind against the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbrage, it's clear he's got the usual teenage issues.It's because of Umbrage, a stooge for the Ministry who doesn't seem too keen on properly educating Hogwarts's students in the Dark Arts, that Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to properly teach those who want to learn dueling and casting defensive spells.  He's qualified after all, given what he's gone through.  It also nets him a brief love interest with Cho Chang, the cute Chinese girl whose boyfriend Cedric was killed at the end of Goblet of Fire.  Umbrage has a typical sickeningly insincere sugary smile and voice, and dressed in pink and with a hat, she seems a demented version of Margaret Thatcher, especially in a form of torture she employs against the students who disobey her.Harry's reunion with his godfather, Sirius Black, provides a welcome relief of sorts, as he is the only kind of real family he has left.  While the two don't have many scenes together, it's clear that despite the limited amount of time the two spent in the third movie, there's a real family connection there.  Black and two ex-professors, sometimes werewolf Remus Lupin and Mad Eye Moody are members of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret countergroup against the reactionaries who don't believe Voldemort's resurrection.But Harry has been having more visions.  In his sleep, he sees Ron's father Arthur being attacked by a snake, which helps the attack from being fatal.  And he keeps seeing Voldemort, pretty menacing with that bald, noseless face of his.Certain interesting portions of the book have been excised, no Quidditch, and we don't see the screaming portrait of Sirius's racist mother, not to mention Harry's Aunt Petunia's knowledge of a few things in the wizard world.The regulars are...well, the regulars as usual.  Of the newcomers, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) steal the show from the regulars.  Though only having roughly ten minutes of screentime, Bonham-Carter really makes the long-haired, demented cousin of Sirius Black another memorably villainous creation.David Yates does a credible enough job on the Order of the Phoenix, but with the dark and serious tones of the movie, one might come away thinking the magic has gone in favour of character development, which is well done.  Only the Weasley twins, Fred and George, provide a brief reminder of this, when they mischievously bid farewell to Hogwarts with a superb pyrotechnic display while the students are taking their exams.  And a fiery Dumbledore escape leads a wizard to tell Cornelius Fudge, ""Dumbledore sure has style.""

The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it!After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power!There's even a Neville Chamberlain character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers, don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis, help can come when you least expect it!See:The Forgotten 500: The Untold Story of the Men Who Risked All for the Greatest Rescue Mission of World War IIandLost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II (P.S.)",5,By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1802,"[""'m"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'previous', 'films', 'found', 'be', 'combination', 'annoying', 'dull', 'confusing', 'last', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'finally', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'own', 'depth', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'thing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'storyline', 'order', 'enjoy', 'leaving', 'theater', 'dawned', 'story', 'truly', 'European', 'perspective', 'Anyone', 'Europe', 'who', 'lived', 'War', 'World', '2', 'knows', 'first', 'hand', 'what', 'powerful', 'monster', 'dictator', 'can', 'do', 'society', 'not', 'abstraction', 'vast', 'majority', 'Americans', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'physically', 'portrayed', 'devil', 'what', 'really', 'very', 'powerful', 'war', 'lord', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'happy', 'destroy', 'person', 'group', 'persons', 'institutions', 'stand', 'way', 'absolute', 'power', 'other', 'reason', 'not', 'wealth', 'glory', 'just', 'raw', 'power', 'even', 'Neville', 'Chamberlain', 'character', 'rather', 'clever', 'film', 'allies', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'threat', 'war', 'undermine', 'everything', 'profess', 'hold', 'dear', 'are', 'so', 'arrogant', 'foolhardy', 'become', 'caricatures', 'sheer', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'extracted', 'story', 'what', 'leader', 'wisdom', 'can', 'come', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places', 'importance', 'planning', 'ahead', 'strength', 'numbers', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'believe', 'what', 'read', 'improvise', 'crisis', 'help', 'can', 'come', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'See', 'Forgotten', '500', 'Untold', 'Story', 'Men', 'Who', 'Risked', 'Greatest', 'Rescue', 'Mission', 'World', 'War', 'IIandLost', 'Shangri-La', 'True', 'Story', 'Survival', 'Adventure', 'Most', 'Incredible', 'Rescue', 'Mission', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'P.S']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651192,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00005JPI2,D. A. Reed,"[1, 1]","As stated before, from the longest novel comes the shortest film. And I've no complaints. Again, the director cuts out most, if not all of the sub-plots, and just gives us a straight forward story with the main characters. Somethings have been altered as well, such as Cho Chang betraying Harry and the others from Cho's friend. Which in my opinion is the better dramatic angle as Cho's friend would've only been in this one movie and it wouldn't have had as much emotional impact on the characters. The main cast continues to improve and the older actors are still wonderful. Two of my new favorite characters, who practically stole the show for me when I saw this two years ago, are Helena Bonham Carter (who gets very good billing in this for being in it for a whole five minutes) as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Carter is wonderfully deranged as Bellatrix as the actress seems to be having a lot of fun being deliciously evil. Lynch is charmingly quirky and, despite this being her first film (I think), is excellent and I only hope that she continues to act several more films after the Potter series has wrapped. Imelda Staunton is very good as Umbridge but there's only so much I can take of the color pink and tedious crooked politician/sadistic teacher angle. I know that's how she is in the book but I find the character rather plain and not as interesting as some of the other plot-twist characters they've had before. Action wise, this is the one with the most of it, climaxing with a wizard's battle which is executed brilliantly (and one can only hope that the climatic battle in the final film will be just as exhilirating). Nicholas Hopper provides an excellent score, using Williams' themes to a minimum, utilizing some brilliant pieces of his own (the wizard battle being one of them).",5,I Hope There's Pudding,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,1829,"['stated', 'longest', 'novel', 'shortest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'complaints', 'Again', 'director', 'out', 'most', 'not', 'sub-plots', 'just', 'straight', 'forward', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'Somethings', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'well', 'such', 'Cho', 'Chang', 'betraying', 'Harry', 'others', 'Cho', 'friend', 'Which', 'opinion', 'better', 'dramatic', 'angle', 'Cho', 'friend', 'would', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'one', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'much', 'emotional', 'impact', 'characters', 'main', 'cast', 'improve', 'older', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'Two', 'new', 'favorite', 'characters', 'who', 'practically', 'stole', 'show', 'when', 'saw', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'billing', 'being', 'whole', 'five', 'minutes', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Carter', 'wonderfully', 'deranged', 'as', 'Bellatrix', 'actress', 'be', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'being', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'Lynch', 'charmingly', 'quirky', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'think', 'excellent', 'only', 'hope', 'act', 'several', 'more', 'films', 'Potter', 'series', 'wrapped', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'very', 'good', 'Umbridge', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'color', 'pink', 'tedious', 'crooked', 'politician/sadistic', 'teacher', 'angle', 'know', 'how', 'book', 'find', 'character', 'rather', 'plain', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'other', 'plot-twist', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Action', 'wise', 'one', 'most', 'climaxing', 'wizard', 'battle', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'climatic', 'battle', 'final', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'exhilirating', 'Hopper', 'excellent', 'score', 'using', 'Williams', 'themes', 'minimum', 'utilizing', 'brilliant', 'pieces', 'own', 'wizard', 'battle', 'being', 'one']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on the loose, although certain parties in the Ministry of Magic would have the public believe otherwise by publicly accusing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) of lying about his return.  When the detestable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) takes over Hogwarts, stripping the curriculum of practical spells, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to turn his back on Harry, the angry young man takes it on himself to train his friends for the coming conflict.Radcliffe turns in his best performance to date in the least of the Potter films.  I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps it was a mistake to make the longest book to this point into the shortest film.  The screenplay often seems to race from development to development and the huge cast has become positively unwieldy, with many incredible actors reduced to brief, unsatisfying walk-ons.  However, it was still very entertaining and its awkward nature is perhaps inevitable; like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the whole film essentially serves as a prelude to much bigger events to come.

651197,A15IQNTQX7QYQA,B00005JPI2,"David W. Shelton ""David W. Shelton is a write...","[2, 2]","Teen angst is a major part of everyone's life, but when it comes to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), angst explodes into magical proportions. Such is the premise of this fifth film in the popular series. Indeed, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film about a young boy's angst as much as it is about subversives in the face of a prevailing darkness.Since Chris Columbus left with his shucks-darn style of directing, the Potter series has taken a darker turn, mirroring their literary counterparts. In Azkaban, the third film, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n introduced the lightning-fast storytelling that would be seen in following films, a technique that director David Yates has used masterfully. The leading actors have all grown up, and thankfully, the films have matured as well.Phoenix begins with Harry being taunted by his muggle (non-magical folk) cousin, but the schoolyard bully is chased away by beings that are far more horrifying, dementors. Harry drives them away using magic, and as a result, he ends up on trial and risks expulsion from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry is clearly troubled by the recent murder of his friend Cedric Diggory, especially because Diggory was killed by the notoriously evil and dangerous Lord Voldemort. To make matters even more frustrating, the leaders of the wizarding world have completely ignored Harry's warnings that the Dark Lord has returned from apparent death fourteen years before.Even warnings from Hogwarts' headmaster, Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), have fallen flat and were even ridiculed in The Daily Prophet, the wizard world's magical newspaper. It seems that the head of the Ministry of Magic, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Dumbledore is after Fudge's job so therefore, anything he says is suspect.The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is the chillingly delicious Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who is a clear supporter of Fudge at any cost. Instead of actually teaching Hogwarts students how to defend themselves against the dark arts (after all, there is no real threat), she limits the students to textbook theories. Harry must somehow convince his classmates that the threat is real, and eventually is compelled to teach them how to defend themselves. Harry doesn't want any of this, he just wants a normal family.The political overtones of The Order of the Phoenix are so overt that they'd be hard to miss. Themes of subversion, extreme loyalty, punishment, and outright rebellion are broad slaps to governments on both sides of the pond. Yet Phoenix is able to rise above criticizing modern politics and becomes a timeless warning against maintaining the status quo. The film's lesson is that abuse of power is costly, no matter its goal or motives.The prevailing darkness that is evident in The Order of the Phoenix seeps through to the core of the film, making it probably too scary for small children. This is a film for everyone else though, whether or not we've read the book on which this film is based. Clearly much had to be excised from J.K. Rowling's excessively verbose novel, but even avid Potter readers will appreciate how much remains. The world that Rowling created is no longer a matter of ""oh, look! It's a goblin! Look there! It's a bunch of bricks that form a door! Wow! It's a talking hat!"" Instead, it's a living, breathing world that Harry must defend using any means necessary.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a complex yarn that is as subtle as it is sharp, and it's biting as it is soothing. Harry gets his first kiss, but it's moviegoers that get the real benefit: an escapist film that actually has the audacity to teach while it entertains.(9/10)",5,This Phoenix Soars!,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,3731,"['Teen', 'angst', 'major', 'part', 'everyone', 'life', 'when', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'angst', 'explodes', 'magical', 'proportions', 'Such', 'premise', 'fifth', 'film', 'popular', 'series', 'Indeed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'angst', 'as', 'much', 'subversives', 'face', 'prevailing', 'darkness.Since', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'left', 'shucks-darn', 'style', 'directing', 'Potter', 'series', 'taken', 'darker', 'turn', 'mirroring', 'literary', 'counterparts', 'Azkaban', 'third', 'film', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'introduced', 'lightning-fast', 'storytelling', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'following', 'films', 'technique', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'used', 'masterfully', 'leading', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'thankfully', 'films', 'have', 'matured', 'well.Phoenix', 'Harry', 'being', 'taunted', 'muggle', 'non-magical', 'folk', 'cousin', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'chased', 'away', 'beings', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'horrifying', 'dementors', 'Harry', 'away', 'using', 'magic', 'result', 'up', 'trial', 'risks', 'expulsion', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry.Harry', 'clearly', 'troubled', 'recent', 'murder', 'friend', 'Cedric', 'Diggory', 'especially', 'Diggory', 'was', 'killed', 'notoriously', 'evil', 'dangerous', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'frustrating', 'leaders', 'wizarding', 'world', 'have', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Harry', 'warnings', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'returned', 'apparent', 'death', 'fourteen', 'years', 'before.Even', 'warnings', 'Hogwarts', 'headmaster', 'Professor', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'were', 'even', 'ridiculed', 'Daily', 'Prophet', 'wizard', 'world', 'magical', 'newspaper', 'head', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Cornelius', 'Fudge', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'convinced', 'Dumbledore', 'Fudge', 'job', 'so', 'therefore', 'anything', 'suspect.The', 'new', 'Defense', 'Against', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'teacher', 'chillingly', 'delicious', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'who', 'clear', 'supporter', 'Fudge', 'cost', 'Instead', 'actually', 'teaching', 'Hogwarts', 'students', 'how', 'defend', 'dark', 'arts', 'real', 'threat', 'students', 'textbook', 'theories', 'Harry', 'must', 'somehow', 'convince', 'classmates', 'threat', 'real', 'eventually', 'compelled', 'teach', 'how', 'defend', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'normal', 'family.The', 'political', 'overtones', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'are', 'so', 'overt', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'miss', 'Themes', 'subversion', 'extreme', 'loyalty', 'punishment', 'outright', 'rebellion', 'are', 'broad', 'slaps', 'governments', 'sides', 'pond', 'Phoenix', 'able', 'rise', 'criticizing', 'modern', 'politics', 'timeless', 'warning', 'maintaining', 'status', 'quo', 'film', 'lesson', 'abuse', 'power', 'costly', 'matter', 'goal', 'motives.The', 'prevailing', 'darkness', 'evident', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'seeps', 'core', 'film', 'making', 'probably', 'too', 'scary', 'small', 'children', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'not', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'Clearly', 'much', 'had', 'be', 'excised', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'excessively', 'verbose', 'novel', 'even', 'avid', 'Potter', 'readers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'how', 'much', 'world', 'Rowling', 'created', 'no', 'longer', 'matter', 'oh', 'look', 'goblin', 'Look', 'there', 'bunch', 'bricks', 'form', 'door', 'Wow', 'talking', 'hat', 'Instead', 'living', 'breathing', 'world', 'Harry', 'must', 'defend', 'using', 'means', 'necessary.Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'complex', 'yarn', 'as', 'subtle', 'sharp', 'biting', 'soothing', 'Harry', 'first', 'kiss', 'moviegoers', 'get', 'real', 'benefit', 'escapist', 'film', 'actually', 'audacity', 'teach', '9/10']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651199,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JPI2,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","Director David Yates and writer Michael Goldberg lead us through the fith year of Hogwarts of J.K Rowling's beloved teen wizard.Shortly before the start of term, a dazed and traumatized Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe) sits on a swing at a neighborhood playground, staring into space until confronted by his cousin, Dudley(Harry Melling), now the leader of a gang of bullies.Still failing to learn the lesson about not hacking off Harry, Dudley does exactly that. But when the sun disappears and a sudden storm sets in, the torment ceases, and everyone runs for cover. The cousins flee through a tunnel where they are suddenly attacked by dementors, which Harry fends off, although Dudley is now the one left incapacitated and staring into space. Harry helps him home, with the assistance of Mrs. Arabella Figg(Kathryn Hunter), a squib that Dumbledore( Michael Gambon)  sent to discreetly supervise Harry in the wake of the previous year's tragedy involving Cedric Diggory(Robert Pattinson).Harry's aunt and uncle(Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths) are devastated at the discovery of Dudley's condition. Before they take him to the doctor, a howler from the Ministry of Magic arrives to inform Harry of his expulsion from Hogwarts for performing magic away from Hogwarts as an underaged wizard. Before leaving the house, Uncle Vernon gloats at the news. But after the Dursley's departure, Harry is spirited away, escorted by members of the Order of the Phoenix, including his Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Remus Lupin(David Thewlis), Nymphadora Tonks(Natalia Tena), and Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris).Traveling through London by broom, they arrive at 12 Grimmauld Place, the  magically hidden Headquarters of the Order, where Harry is reunited with his beloved cohorts, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger(Emma Watson), as well as the Weasley Twins, Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), Mr. and Mrs. Weasley(Mark Williams and Julie Walters), the latter of whom takes a protective stance on Harry's behalf during the Order members' meeting when the idea of Harry's having to fight is considered, as well as his beloved godfather, Sirius Black(Gary Oldman).Harry is introduced to Ravenclaw student Luna Lovegood( spacey and etheral Evanna Lynch)during the final leg of the journey to Hogwarts. It's a relationship of great significance.But  prior to that,we learn that the Order, of which Harry's parents had once been members had disbanded but had currently recovened to combat the forces of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Harry learns that Corneilius Fudge(Robert Hardy)has been smearing both him as well as Dumbledore due to his refusal to accept the fact of Voldemort's return. The newspaper, ""The Daily Prophet"" has been reflective of this view.Arthur Weasley escorts Harry to a hearing on whether or not Harry will be able to stay in school. With helpful tesitimony from Mrs. Figg, and input from Dumbledore himself, he is reinstated.Once back at Hogwarts, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, appointed by the Ministry, is introduced. The pink-clad, toad-like, outwardly pleasant but inwardly sinister Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton), who was a juror at Harry's hearing, makes a cheerful, optimistic sounding speech about the new school curriculum. Hermione rightfully perceives the ministry's intention of taking over Hogwarts and imposing an inept curriculum on the students.Umbridge shouts down Harry's statements about the return of Voldemort from the start, and inflicts torturous punishment on him for clashing with her.Ron and Hermione urge him to report this to Dumbledore, but the hallowed headmaster has distanced himself from the boy.The belief (as stated in the ""Daily Prophet"") that Harry was repsonsible for Cedric Diggory's death at the Triwizard Tournament the previous year creates tension between Harry and his roomate Seamus(Devon Murray).Eventually, amid a mounting array of school restrictions,including the prohibition of the practice of magic itself, each being posted in writing at the entrance of the great hall by Filch(David Bradley)the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw students agree on the need to combat the situation.Teachers who clash with Umbridge, including McGonnagal(Maggie Smith), are threatened with dismissal. Dumbledore arrives from a leave of abscence in time to spare the Divination Professor, Sybill Trelawney(Emma Thompson)who failed Umbridge's evaluation test, from being evicted from her campus home in a scene of immense pathos.Students of Slytherin House of which Umbridge is an alumnus, including Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) become even more menacing, and their bullying goes unchecked.Ironically, the head of Slytherin House, Professor Snape(Alan Rickman), is willing to help Harry fight the Dark Lord by giving him private occulancy lessons. Using a device called the pensieve, in which one's memories are revealed. Harry learns the private thoughts of others. But Snape warns him that Voldemort can use the contents of his mind against him in a duel. During one such session, Harry penetrates Snape's mind and learns an unfortunate truth about Snape's relationship with his father(Robbie Jarvis) during their schooldays.The students find a place at Hogsmeade to meet to discuss their situation and how to improve it.Besides Luna, Cho Chen(Katie Leung) gives some relevant input, and although she is still grieving the loss of her boyfriend, Cedric, a relationship between her and Harry grows.Despite Umbridge's ever-watchful eye, Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis) finds the Room of Requirement, in which Harry begins to teach the students, who now constitute Dumbledore's Army how to form a patronus, using what Professor Lupin taught him two years earlier.Harry proves to be an adept, encouraging, and amiable instructor during the sessions, which are highly productive. In the meantime, Umbridge recruits students (mostly Slytherins, of course) for an Inquisitorial Squad, which will purportedly put and end to the activities of Harry and the others.Filch and the squad members are unable to get into the Room of Requirement, and Fred and George Weasley even use their illicit joke shop creations to waylay Filch. Among the young magical practitioners, there is a feeling of optimism at the last pre-Christmas session, which ends with a kiss between Harry and Cho, whom Harry comforts during a private chat about Cedric's death.Back at 12 Grimmawauld Place for Christmas, Harry is toasted for the use of the perceptiveness he recieved in a dream, which helped save Mr. Weasly's life. But he confides to Sirius that he feels he is going bad due to the feeling of Voldemort's possession of him, and constant feelings of anger. Sirius reassures him, and shows him the tapestry of the Black's family tree including his mad cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) who, with other high security prisoners, escaped from Azkanban Prison. The ""Daily Prophet"" wronfully accuses Sirius Black, another escapee, of assisting her.A relevant meeting with Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)who had been away for a while, introduces Harry, Ron and Hermione to Hagrid's gigantic half-brother, Grawp(Tony Maudsley)in the woods takes place during that term. Hermione does an impressive job of asserting herself when dealing with him.Ultimately, Umbridge, and the Inquisitorial Squad break into the Room of Requirement and apprehend those partaking in ilicit activities. Before Harry, Fudge, and Shacklebot, Dumbledore takes the blame for Harry's activities and with his phoenix, Fawkes in tow, manages to avoid arrest.Cho becomes an outcast for disclosing information about the goings-on in the Room of Requirement. But it will later be revealed that an illegal curse was used on her to get her to talk.While students struggle through their OWL (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exams, for which they were ill-prepared due to the school's refusal to teach students how to pass them,before an imperiously corrupt Umbridge, who is now Headmistress of the school, Fred and George Weasley bolt from the school an a moment of impressive rebellion, amid the cheers of the students and a few staff members. At that moment,another burning sensation on the scar Voldemort gave him, along with various images will reveal to Harry that his godfather is in danger.Harry, Ron, Hermione, et. al try to get to London to confront the villianous forces in the Ministry by way of the chimney in Umbridge's office. But they are caught. In a maneuver in which she proves herself to be too slick for the room, Hermione devises a plan to get Umbridge out of the way once and for all by recalling an earlier rendevous with an acquaintance from the Forbidden Forest.Along with Luna, Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright), Neville, Ron, and Hermione, Harry flies to London on thestrals( inside-out horses with wings) where the main drama of the story takes place. Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs) is the first death-eater to confront the young wizards, who while, surrounded, find members of the Order of the Phoenix in their corner.Before the dramatic battle ends, and Harry and Dumbledore vindicated, Harry will lose one more person he has come to love.After his temporary possession by the Dark Lord ends, he tells off his great archnemesis, reminding him that he is weak because he will never know love or friendship.Harry accepts the consolation of his friends and mentors once again, and as we anticipate the ultimate and final confrontation between the young wizards and their would-be destroyer, the youngsters know they are on the side of right, and on that hopeful note, we leave them.",5,Combat With Wands!,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,9651,"['Director',

651207,A1NC477I5AHP2H,B00005JPI2,D,"[4, 4]","(MINOR spoilers)This is an odd film, and I'm not quite sure how to feel about it.  Somehow it manages to feel rushed but too long at the same time.  But to be fair, the book wasn't my favorite either - I found it mostly very good, but overinflated and occasionally poorly plotted.I can't imagine trying to watch this film without having read the book.  The scenes aren't fleshed out and rush by so fast that I think it would be hard to keep track and understand everything that's happening.  Is that necessarily a bad thing?  I don't know - you could argue that all of the films exist as companions to the books, but I still tend to think that they should work on their own.I question some choices that were made in the adaptation.  Why introduce the giant?  I don't understand why he's in the book (unless he plays into a later installment - I'm just now starting Book 6).  But I understand even less why he's in the film, where he serves little (or no) purpose to the plot...and visually, he's the worst special effect the series has ever seen.  Likewise, Sirius's encounter with ""the arch"" is poorly explained in both the book and the film.  I expect that plot point to be revisited in a later book, but in the meantime it's just confusing.Another complaint is that this film, unlike some of the prior installments, spends nearly every second on critical plot.  There's little time spent on additional flourishes that exist only to please the eye or immerse us in the wizarding world.  As a result, the film feels forced and incomplete.Finally, the movie's ending doesn't at all bear the emotional weight of the book.  A very major event in Harry's life is glossed over, which is both surprising and disappointing.As with all the films, this one is well acted, has some great special effects (love the hall of prophecies), and is ultimately worth seeing for fans of the books.

651213,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005JPI2,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","This 5th entry in the Harry Potter series sits comfortably in what has now become a much darker and more mature series.  Though this is not be intended as violent and unappropriate at all, it is however much more than what began as a simple children's tale.  Voldomort - the evil dark Lord, is back in force, and assembling his armies of darkness while on the other hand, the armies of good are preparing for battle as well.  Hogwarts, though present throughout the film, focuses very little on actual school this time around.  The events going on in the world around Hogwarts, specifically the battle of good vs evil raging, has infiltrated the institute and placed heavy burdens on everyone inside.  And though Phoenix doesn't have all the action and humor that supplied some fo the eariler Potter films (and not a mention of Quidditch), the impressive story still makes this a superb film.A very serious tone surrounds the air in this film, as is a sense that there is no time for play (the overall lack of fun and humor adds to that feeling).  Still, it is a very mature and well told story, that keeps the interest of events high and suspenseful.  And though there is an overall lack of action, the climax makes up for it with an incredible visual feast of effects in an impressive duel between Dumbledore and Voldomort himself.The reality of death is back again, after the loss of Cedric in the previous film.  The loss of a fellow Hogwarts student looms the air, and forces Harry to come to some sort of terms with the facts, and with his crush, who had a relationship with Cedric - Cho.  In Phoenix, another dies by the end of the film, and this time it someone much closer to Harry, and the death is not taken so lightly this time, as the incredible feelings of anger begin to take over Harry.I say this every time I write a review for the Potter films, but we have come so far since the first int he series.  Each film adds more and more to the story, being more reality and more emotion in a very grown-up situation for simple teenagers.  The children have indeed grown up by far, but that just makes it more fun for the adults who are watching these great films.Acting - 4.5Action - 4Characters - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5",4,[4.5] The time for war has finally arrived,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,2236,"['5th', 'entry', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'comfortably', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'mature', 'series', 'not', 'be', 'intended', 'violent', 'unappropriate', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'began', 'simple', 'children', 'tale', 'Voldomort', 'evil', 'dark', 'Lord', 'back', 'force', 'assembling', 'armies', 'darkness', 'other', 'hand', 'armies', 'good', 'are', 'preparing', 'battle', 'as', 'well', 'Hogwarts', 'present', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'school', 'time', 'around', 'events', 'going', 'world', 'Hogwarts', 'specifically', 'battle', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'raging', 'infiltrated', 'institute', 'placed', 'heavy', 'burdens', 'everyone', 'inside', 'Phoenix', ""n't"", 'have', 'action', 'humor', 'supplied', 'fo', 'eariler', 'Potter', 'films', 'not', 'mention', 'Quidditch', 'impressive', 'story', 'still', 'superb', 'film.A', 'very', 'serious', 'tone', 'air', 'film', 'sense', 'time', 'play', 'overall', 'lack', 'fun', 'humor', 'feeling', 'Still', 'very', 'mature', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'interest', 'events', 'high', 'suspenseful', 'overall', 'lack', 'action', 'climax', 'up', 'incredible', 'visual', 'feast', 'effects', 'impressive', 'duel', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldomort', 'himself.The', 'reality', 'death', 'back', 'again', 'loss', 'Cedric', 'previous', 'film', 'loss', 'fellow', 'Hogwarts', 'student', 'air', 'forces', 'Harry', 'come', 'sort', 'terms', 'facts', 'crush', 'who', 'had', 'relationship', 'Cedric', 'Cho', 'Phoenix', 'dies', 'end', 'film', 'time', 'someone', 'much', 'closer', 'Harry', 'death', 'not', 'taken', 'so', 'lightly', 'time', 'incredible', 'feelings', 'anger', 'begin', 'take', 'over', 'Harry.I', 'say', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'Potter', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'int', 'series', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'story', 'being', 'more', 'reality', 'more', 'emotion', 'very', 'grown-up', 'situation', 'simple', 'teenagers', 'children', 'have', 'indeed', 'grown', 'up', 'far', 'just', 'more', 'fun', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'great', 'films.Acting', '4.5Action', '4Characters', '4.5Story', '4.5Overall', '4.5']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

I've read all the books and while I'm disappointed with some of the cuts I must say they've done wonderfully in capturing the spirit of the books.

651230,A1ROYTFVKXZUY5,B00005JPI2,E. Smith,"[2, 2]","Okay, let me preface this by saying that I am a massive Harry Potter fan. I've read all of the books multiple times and I'm a huge lover of all things Potter.Usually, I'm a bit peeved when I read a book and then go see the movie that is supposed to be based on the book only to find that the movie has been completely butchered. That being said, with Potter, I can accept that the movies are simply an interpretation of these fantastic books, and that in reality, they are two separate entities. I also really don't feel like they truly ""ruined"" this movie or any of the Potter films for that matter.Like all movies, there were good things and bad. I'll go over the things I didn't enjoy first:Fans of the book will notice huge changes and many things left out. I won't lie; some of those things were annoying and frustrating. I felt like they minimized a lot of very important details and plot lines that really needed to be there to make the movie what it should be. It just felt very different from the book. I also feel like they may have an issue or two with the plot when they go to make the 7th movie because they left out a few things that NEEDED to be there in this one! Note that the movie focuses more on Dumbledore's Army rather than the Order of the Phoenix (which is really what the book focuses on because it's important in the grand scheme of things).Another issue is that for those who haven't read the book, the story may be difficult to follow. Important details and parts of the story may be missed by those who don't know the story from reading the book. I watched this with Potter fans AND people who haven't read the books, and found that the ""non-readers"" felt a bit confused at times and were asking me what was going on.ALL OF THAT BEING SAID...this is still a fantastic movie. I really, really enjoyed it. It's much, much darker than the previous movies and much more adult(hence the PG-13 rating on this one!). You follow Harry through his mental and emotional struggles and his mysterious connection to Voldemort. It's quite an intense film, and like I said, very dark, but still fantastic. I felt like there were fewer ""bright and happy"" moments and fewer comic relief moments because the movie is so intense.New members of the cast are amazing. Three Words: Helena. Bonham. Carter. She is FANTASTIC as Bellatrix Lestrange but they underused her severely. They left out so many great moments that should have been hers. I really, really hope they use her more in the last two films. She was great. The actress who plays Luna Lovegood was perfect too! So well casted! She played the part exactly as I had envisioned that character!As far as the DVD goes, I was really hoping for more Extras. I don't feel like this DVD has enough. They should have included the scenes with Sirius and Bellatrix dueling that they cut from the movie. That would have been great. The ""Trailing Tonks"" section is pretty fun though.

651231,A2EBKJDM0QBLK6,B00005JPI2,Esteemed Protector,"[0, 0]","A vicious attack!An unfair accusation!These incidents are just the start of the challenges Harry must face in The Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore has warned everyone Voldermort is on the loose yet not every one believes him, or, to be more precise, wants to.  Some go so far as to question his competency.  Harry is also under suspicion - ""THE BOY WHO LIES"" cries the Daily Chronicle.  Indeed, after a near fatal dementor attack poor Harry finds himself facing the Ministry of Magic.  It is only the timely intervention of Dumbledore that prevents Harry's expulsion from Hogwarts!  There are changes at Harry's alma mata, not all good.  The new defense against the dark arts teacher is one Delores Umbridge, a ministry of magic troubleshooter and troublemaker who's sweet exterior hides an unpleasant persona with equally unpleasant plans for Hogwarts.  Harry finds himself suspected of foul play.  After all he was the only one that saw Cedric die, right?  Finally, there is Voldermort himself who is very much alive, and very, very dangerous.  He has freed several former death eaters from Azkabahn, the most vicious being the twisted Bellatrix LaStrange, responsible for the torture and murder of Neville Longbottom's parents.  Voldermort and Harry seem to have developed some sort of psychic connection.  Harry fears Voldermort may be able to read his thoughts, maybe even control his action.Yet there is still good.  Harry meets Luna Lovegate, a strange girl who seems strangely at peace. Harry's friends are back, as loyal as ever. In addition to Ron and Hermione, Sirius Black has returned along with Mad-Eye Moody and Remus Lupin.  They introduce Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, a group they formed to stop Voldermort when he first came to power.  As Umbridge's hold over Hogwarts becomes an iron grip, Hogwarts students rally around Harry and form the landestine ""Dumbedore's army"".  Will they be able to stop Umbridge and her lackey minions?  Will Harry learn the secret of his Voldermort connection?  Finally, what creature is Hagrid hiding this time?This movie, like its predecessors, is an excellent adaptation of the book.  Similar to The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix has a noticeably grim, serious feeling about it.  The actors are again allowed to act their age and their characters are developed accordingly.  Neville Longbottom's character has undergone the greatest change.  The yahoo of yesteryear has matured into a loyal friend and formidable fighter.  Most importantly, examples can be applied from The Order of the Phoenix to present day society.  In The Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore says, ""The time will soon come when we will have to choose between what is right and what is safe.""  The Order of the Phoenix shows the mistake of trying to do what is safe for the simple sake of doing so.  Neutering Hogwarts does not stop Voldermort nor does denying his existence make him go away. There will always be Voldermorts that have to be dealt with, and to deny their existence only makes them grow stronger.",4,THIS PHOENIX FLIES!!!,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3042,"['vicious', 'attack', 'unfair', 'accusation', 'incidents', 'are', 'just', 'start', 'challenges', 'Harry', 'must', 'face', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Dumbledore', 'warned', 'everyone', 'Voldermort', 'loose', 'yet', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'question', 'competency', 'Harry', 'also', 'suspicion', 'BOY', 'WHO', 'LIES', 'Daily', 'Chronicle', 'Indeed', 'near', 'fatal', 'dementor', 'attack', 'poor', 'Harry', 'facing', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'only', 'timely', 'intervention', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'expulsion', 'Hogwarts', 'are', 'changes', 'Harry', 'alma', 'mata', 'not', 'good', 'new', 'defense', 'dark', 'teacher', 'one', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'ministry', 'magic', 'troubleshooter', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'sweet', 'exterior', 'hides', 'unpleasant', 'persona', 'equally', 'unpleasant', 'plans', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'suspected', 'foul', 'play', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'saw', 'Cedric', 'die', 'right', 'Finally', 'Voldermort', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'very', 'very', 'dangerous', 'freed', 'several', 'former', 'death', 'eaters', 'Azkabahn', 'most', 'vicious', 'being', 'twisted', 'Bellatrix', 'LaStrange', 'responsible', 'torture', 'murder', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'parents', 'Voldermort', 'Harry', 'seem', 'have', 'developed', 'sort', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Harry', 'Voldermort', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'thoughts', 'maybe', 'even', 'control', 'action.Yet', 'still', 'good', 'Harry', 'Luna', 'Lovegate', 'strange', 'girl', 'who', 'strangely', 'peace', 'Harry', 'friends', 'are', 'back', 'as', 'loyal', 'ever', 'addition', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'returned', 'Mad-Eye', 'Moody', 'Remus', 'Lupin', 'introduce', 'Harry', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'group', 'formed', 'stop', 'Voldermort', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'power', 'Umbridge', 'hold', 'Hogwarts', 'iron', 'grip', 'students', 'rally', 'Harry', 'form', 'landestine', 'Dumbedore', 'army', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'Umbridge', 'lackey', 'minions', 'Will', 'Harry', 'learn', 'secret', 'Voldermort', 'connection', 'Finally', 'what', 'creature', 'Hagrid', 'hiding', 'time', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Similar', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'noticeably', 'grim', 'serious', 'feeling', 'actors', 'are', 'again', 'allowed', 'act', 'age', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'accordingly', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'character', 'undergone', 'greatest', 'change', 'yahoo', 'yesteryear', 'matured', 'loyal', 'friend', 'formidable', 'fighter', 'Most', 'importantly', 'examples', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'present', 'day', 'society', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Dumbledore', 'time', 'will', 'soon', 'come', 'when', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'safe', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'mistake', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'safe', 'simple', 'sake', 'doing', 'so', 'Neutering', 'Hogwarts', 'not', 'stop', 'Voldermort', 'denying', 'existence', 'make', 'go', 'away', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Voldermorts', 'have', 'be', 'dealt', 'deny', 'existence', 'only', 'grow', 'stronger']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651232,A1XWQ13VJDOQ7C,B00005JPI2,"eternal now ""roejoerrer""","[0, 2]","If you're a die hard, cutthroat Harry Potter fan, then the motion picture adaption of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" will raise quite a few flags. Much was cut out due to time constraints and to appeal to a wider audience, instead of only the ""fans"" of the book series.However, that is not to say that the film adaption of the 5th book in the Harry Potter series falls along the ranks of box office duds ""Super Mario Brothers"", or the horribly mistaken ""Johnny Mnemonic"". ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a fine film that, while shifting the emphasis of certain parts in the book, creates a captivating film that only falters a few times.Dark dreams ravish Harry Potter in his sleep, dreams of Voldermort's return, and Cedric Diggory's death.In his 5th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, things are once again taking a turn for the worse. Voldermort has returned, and he is bent on eliminating the one person that can defeat him, Harry Potter. Dark dreams plague Harry's mind. The school comes under fire when a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is announced. control of the school is soon wrenched away from Headmaster Professor Dumbledore and into the hands of Ministry of Magic stooge Professor Umbridge, who bans defensive magic in her eager attempt to disable Hogwarts. The students, in rebellion form Dumbledore's Army. Meanwhile Voldermort is amassing his own army...If you're an avid fan or the casual reader, I'm quite positive there is much to enjoy here; if not for the themes then for the amazing picture quality and engrossing audio quality. The video quality is pristine, making every detail, every imperfection stand revealed. Its not really all that big of a deal, but I really enjoy the fact that I can make out the finest detail in every scene. You can see the minute detail on the castle walls, cracks, dents, and the general wear and tear on wood, and the pores and imperfections on the faces of each actor. Again, not a HUGE deal, but 1 more level of ambiance that really makes the film come alive.Colors are vibrant (especially the greens, reds, pinks and blues), the blacks are black (sometimes they get a little too black) and the whites are white. It is a treat alone to admire the amazing video transfer and the awesome audio. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is by no means a ""demo disc"", but it will probably turn some heads, especially during the blue screen shots, and the CGI-infused scenes. At times there is a noticeable amount of picture fuzz, mostly on faces and bright special effects, but it is so minute that it doesn't detract from the experience.The audio is excellent, especially if you have a nice surround system. I'm using a cheap RCA one, and it sounds amazing. Lots of bass heavy moments, very reminiscent of movie theater audio quality.The Harry Potter books have translated very well to the silver screen, and these films are a must for the avid Fantasy fan. The acting is of pretty high quality, especially noteworthy since the cast is mostly kids.The one problem with the Harry Potter motion picture film series is that, the only way to truly understand the story arc, you really need to start with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" and work your way up. As far as character development in this series, it is constant and ever changing, but the primary groundwork for most of the characters was established in the first three films. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" doesn't delve too far into any of the main characters, aside from their feelings, and the casual dabbler may get lost in the intertwining story arcs.",4,Entertaining,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,3586,"[""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'cutthroat', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'then', 'motion', 'picture', 'adaption', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'will', 'raise', 'quite', 'few', 'flags', 'Much', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'instead', 'only', 'fans', 'book', 'series.However', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'adaption', '5th', 'book', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'ranks', 'box', 'office', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'horribly', 'mistaken', 'Johnny', 'Mnemonic', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'fine', 'film', 'shifting', 'emphasis', 'certain', 'parts', 'book', 'captivating', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'times.Dark', 'dreams', 'ravish', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'sleep', 'dreams', 'Voldermort', 'return', 'Cedric', 'Diggory', 'death.In', '5th', 'year', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'things', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'taking', 'turn', 'worse', 'Voldermort', 'returned', 'bent', 'eliminating', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'defeat', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Dark', 'plague', 'Harry', 'mind', 'school', 'fire', 'when', 'new', 'Defense', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'teacher', 'announced', 'control', 'school', 'soon', 'wrenched', 'away', 'Headmaster', 'Professor', 'Dumbledore', 'hands', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'stooge', 'Professor', 'Umbridge', 'who', 'defensive', 'magic', 'eager', 'attempt', 'disable', 'Hogwarts', 'students', 'rebellion', 'form', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'Meanwhile', 'Voldermort', 'amassing', 'own', 'army', ""'re"", 'avid', 'fan', 'casual', 'reader', ""'m"", 'quite', 'positive', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'not', 'themes', 'then', 'amazing', 'picture', 'quality', 'engrossing', 'audio', 'quality', 'video', 'quality', 'pristine', 'making', 'detail', 'imperfection', 'stand', 'revealed', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'finest', 'detail', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'minute', 'detail', 'castle', 'walls', 'cracks', 'dents', 'general', 'wear', 'tear', 'wood', 'pores', 'imperfections', 'actor', 'Again', 'not', 'HUGE', 'deal', '1', 'more', 'level', 'ambiance', 'really', 'film', 'come', 'alive.Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'especially', 'greens', 'reds', 'pinks', 'blues', 'blacks', 'are', 'black', 'sometimes', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'black', 'whites', 'are', 'white', 'treat', 'alone', 'admire', 'amazing', 'video', 'transfer', 'awesome', 'audio', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'demo', 'disc', 'will', 'probably', 'turn', 'heads', 'especially', 'blue', 'screen', 'shots', 'CGI-infused', 'scenes', 'times', 'noticeable', 'amount', 'picture', 'fuzz', 'mostly', 'bright', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'minute', ""n't"", 'detract', 'experience.The', 'audio', 'excellent', 'especially', 'have', 'nice', 'surround', 'system', ""'m"", 'using', 'cheap', 'RCA', 'one', 'amazing', 'Lots', 'bass', 'heavy', 'moments', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'theater', 'audio', 'quality.The', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'have', 'translated', 'very', 'well', 'silver', 'screen', 'films', 'are', 'must', 'avid', 'Fantasy', 'fan', 'acting', 'pretty', 'high', 'quality', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'cast', 'mostly', 'kids.The', 'one', 'problem', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'motion', 'picture', 'film', 'series', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'understand', 'story', 'arc', 'really', 'need', 'start', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'As', 'far', 'character', 'development', 'series', 'constant', 'ever', 'changing', 'primary', 'groundwork', 'most', 'characters', 'was', 'established', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Order', 'Phoenix', ""n't"", 'delve', 'too', 'far', 'main', 'characters', 'aside', 'feelings', 'casual', 'dabbler', 'may', 'get', 'lost', 'intertwining', 'story', 'arcs']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651233,A2VEY1TSG8P1PM,B00005JPI2,Ethan Gorham,"[2, 2]","A great Blu Ray release. Sound and picture is excellent. Didn't notice any Digital Noise or sound dropping during scenes. A great looking movie to show off the power of your HD TV and Surround Sound system. Even if you don't have those, the Special Features are more than worth the buy. They don't just feature everybody patting each other on the back, but really get into the meat of how this Movie was made.Regarding the movie, as a movie (!), I found it to be one of the most entertaining of the series. As an adaptation, however, I'll say its sorely lacking, which brings me to a slight feeling of disappointment regarding its length. It could've been a better adaptation. This isn't to say its a bad adaptation, but to say it could've definitely been better, which brings me to something I feel should be addressed: the notion of an Extended Cut of the film.The Extended Cut doesn't exist, folks, or at least not the one you're looking for. I've read the screenplay (The Shooting Script), and with the exception of a scene in Professor Trelawney's classroom, which was filmed and is included as a Deleted Scene here, and Professor McGonagall's Stunning Spell scenes (which, as written, were completely over the top and might've killed the overall tone of the film), there is nothing else to add save for a bunch of scenes that would be remarkably hindering of the film's pacing (like Harry skipping stones or the Threstrals scene with Hagrid). The film is actually better than the script, as Director David Yates, together with Mark Day, improved on the film's pacing by shortening some scenes, jump cutting (like during the climax and during Harry's dreams/premonitions) and using newspaper montages. That supposed 40 minutes of cut-footage? Outside of maybe 20 minutes of Deleted Scenes which wouldn't add anything, it was cut FOOTAGE. Alternate takes, unused coverage, and cut lines- the stuff that proves useless in making a movie better, and can in fact make a movie worse (The Director's Cut of The Chronicles of Riddick). Its like that one famous unused shot from The Dark Knight showing Heath Ledger as The Joker cackling on the school bus while the Hospital blows up outside of the bus windows = completely unnecessary.The Extended Cuts that certain people are looking for in the series couldn't exist, anyways. After all, Rowling's books were still being released when the films were, and she famously refused to cue in Steve Kloves and the directors on where the series was headed, given her fear that they may spoil important plot points of later books before their release. The only films in the series that could've had proper Extended Cuts are The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, and rather than do that, David Yates set about finishing the series as its own separate being from the books (including things like Flying Death Eaters, the burning Weasley home, and the like). There still could be solid Extended Cuts of those films, but those probably wouldn't improve the films as better adaptations.Sorry I spent so much time on that aspect, but it needed to be addressed, and badly, seeing the many comments and reviews trashing The Ultimate Editions of the films over the lack of Extended Cuts. If you're a complete Potter Movie nut, this is the set to buy.

The film is debuting on both Blu-ray and HD DVD day-and-date with the standard DVD version, and though there are some notable differences in terms of audio and extras, the one area where both high-def editions match up is this 1080p/VC-1 encode (framed at the film's original 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio). Warner has certainly delivered the goods, and even with the startling number of reference-quality high-def titles I've reviewed in recent weeks, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' easily stands tall, boasting yet another a five-star video presentation.I've often used the term &#34;picture window effect&#34; in my reviews, but right from the film's opening sequence, 'Order of the Phoenix' boasts some of the most three-dimensional images I've yet seen on a next-gen title. This continues throughout the film, with the level of detail and depth to this Blu-ray disc truly fantastic. Sharp, resplendent in fine texture and perfectly balanced in terms of balance and contrast, 'Order of the Phoenix' is absolutely top tier.Of course, any 'Harry Potter' film is one of fantasy, and as such it's clear throughout that we are in a surreal and vibrant world. Colors are pushed to the max of saturation, but always stay one millimeter away from oversaturation. Hues remain rock solid and free of noise or other defects, so despite obvious skews in terms of color (blues and yellows are particularly accentuated), the presentation still feels surprisingly natural. Warner has also done a terrific job with compression, and I had no problems with any artifacts -- no edge enhancement, macroblocking or banding (even in heavily CGI'd sequences). Simply put, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is a stunner.The Audio: Rating the SoundWarner has been much better recently with their support of high-res audio on the majority of their next-gen releases, and this Blu-ray edition of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' continues the trend with a stellar uncompressed PCM 5.1 Surround mix (48kHz/24-bit). It's easily on par with the Dolby TrueHD track on the HD DVD -- in fact, any audible differences are so marginal it's a wash. Both rate as a sparkling sonic experience. (Note that the Blu-ray does outgun the HD DVD when it comes to foreign language options. Although the HD DVD contains only English, French and Spanish tracks and subtitles, this Blu-ray edition contains a wealth of additional options -- check out the left sidebar for the complete list.)It's no surprise that Warner spared no expense in bringing the latest Harry Potter adventure to the big screen. This is the best sound design you're likely to hear this year -- bold, highly immersive and unflagging in its sustained aggressiveness. There are so many fantastic sequences that you can just pick a chapter for instant demo material (the film's final 45 minutes in particular are a true aural delight). The rear soundfield is alive throughout, with sounds bounding all around with a transparency that's as close to the movie theater as you're going to get. Minor ambiance is not ignored either, with quieter scenes boasting a palpable surround presence. Even a simple whoosh of Harry's wand is often accompanied by a delightful subtle wisp of sound in the rears.All other aspects of the source are equally excellent. Integration of music, dialogue and effects is pitch-perfect. Even with so many younger actors (and their sometimes thick English accents), I made out every word without ever reaching for my remote's volume controls. The score (by Nicholas Hooper, subbing for John Williams) is also impressively dispersed, with the appropriate majestic quality. And although 'Order of the Phoenix' may not be the subwoofer juggernaut of a film like 'Transformers,' when bass is needed, believe me, you'll feel it. There is not one aspect of this mix that disappoints.",5,Hi Def Digest said it best: Order Of The Phoenix is the best of the Harry Potter films on Blu-ray...,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3988,"['Video', 'Sizing', 'Up', ""Picture'Harry"", 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'certainly', 'flagship', 'next-gen', 'title', 'Warner', 'film', 'debuting', 'Blu-ray', 'HD', 'DVD', 'day-and-date', 'standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'are', 'notable', 'differences', 'terms', 'audio', 'extras', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'high-def', 'editions', 'match', 'up', '1080p/VC-1', 'encode', 'framed', 'film', 'original', '2.40:1', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Warner', 'certainly', 'delivered', 'goods', 'even', 'startling', 'number', 'reference-quality', 'high-def', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'recent', 'weeks', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'easily', 'tall', 'boasting', 'yet', 'five-star', 'video', 'presentation.I', ""'ve"", 'often', 'used', 'term', '34', 'picture', 'effect', '34', 'reviews', 'right', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', ""'Order"", 'Phoenix', 'most', 'three-dimensional', 'images', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'next-gen', 'title', 'film', 'level', 'detail', 'depth', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'Sharp', 'resplendent', 'fine', 'texture', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'terms', 'balance', 'contrast', ""'Order"", 'Phoenix', 'absolutely', 'top', 'tier.Of', 'course', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', 'film', 'one', 'fantasy', 'such', 'clear', 'are', 'surreal', 'vibrant', 'world', 'Colors', 'are', 'pushed', 'max', 'saturation', 'always', 'stay', 'one', 'millimeter', 'away', 'oversaturation', 'Hues', 'remain', 'rock', 'solid', 'free', 'noise', 'other', 'defects', 'obvious', 'skews', 'terms', 'color', 'blues', 'yellows', 'are', 'particularly', 'accentuated', 'presentation', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'natural', 'Warner', 'also', 'done', 'terrific', 'job', 'compression', 'had', 'problems', 'artifacts', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'macroblocking', 'banding', 'even', 'heavily', 'CGI', ""'d"", 'sequences', 'Simply', 'put', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'stunner.The', 'Audio', 'Rating', 'SoundWarner', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'recently', 'support', 'high-res', 'audio', 'majority', 'next-gen', 'releases', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'trend', 'stellar', 'uncompressed', 'PCM', '5.1', 'Surround', 'mix', '48kHz/24-bit', 'easily', 'par', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'track', 'HD', 'DVD', 'fact', 'audible', 'differences', 'are', 'so', 'marginal', 'wash', 'rate', 'sparkling', 'sonic', 'experience', 'Note', 'Blu-ray', 'outgun', 'HD', 'DVD', 'when', 'foreign', 'language', 'options', 'HD', 'DVD', 'only', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'tracks', 'subtitles', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'wealth', 'additional', 'options', 'check', 'out', 'left', 'sidebar', 'complete', 'list', 'surprise', 'Warner', 'spared', 'expense', 'bringing', 'latest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'adventure', 'big', 'screen', 'best', 'sound', 'design', ""'re"", 'likely', 'hear', 'year', 'bold', 'highly', 'immersive', 'unflagging', 'sustained', 'aggressiveness', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'fantastic', 'sequences', 'can', 'just', 'pick', 'chapter', 'instant', 'demo', 'material', 'film', 'final', '45', 'minutes', 'particular', 'are', 'true', 'aural', 'delight', 'rear', 'soundfield', 'alive', 'sounds', 'bounding', 'transparency', 'as', 'close', 'movie', 'theater', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'Minor', 'ambiance', 'not', 'ignored', 'either', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'boasting', 'palpable', 'surround', 'presence', 'Even', 'simple', 'whoosh', 'Harry', 'wand', 'often', 'accompanied', 'delightful', 'subtle', 'wisp', 'sound', 'rears.All', 'other', 'aspects', 'source', 'are', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Integration', 'music', 'dialogue', 'effects', 'pitch-perfect', 'Even', 'so', 'many', 'younger', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'thick', 'English', 'accents', 'made', 'out', 'word', 'ever', 'reaching', 'remote', 'volume', 'controls', 'score', 'Nicholas', 'Hooper', 'subbing', 'John', 'Williams', 'also', 'impressively', 'dispersed', 'appropriate', 'majestic', 'quality', ""'Order"", 'Phoenix', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'subwoofer', 'juggernaut', 'film', ""'Transformers"", 'when', 'bass', 'needed', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'not', 'one', 'aspect', 'mix', 'disappoints']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651238,A38JWSLCF9AYOZ,B00005JPI2,Fluffy's Owner,"[0, 0]","This was the only Harry Potter film that, when I first saw it, I thought merited only a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star one. I thought that at the time because they had cut so much of the book out. The longest Harry Potter book was the shortest Harry Potter film! However, watching it again today and other times after my first viewing made me re-evaluate my original score. Why? There are several reasons (as usual). First off, the acting was some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The regulars were all perfect, as usual (for my reasons why, see my review of Harry Potter 1). Despite that, the thing that made the film perfect was the newcomers. I've never found anyone who disagrees with me when I say that Luna and Umbridge were flawlessly cast. Luna just seemed so ... Luna! And Umbridge fooled you into thinking she was kind and sweet and then revealed her twisted nature, in acting so flawless that we viewers forgot it was just a role. Going back to Luna, I thought she sometimes stole the show. Neville also made you see another side of him. Another reason I changed my rating was that I understood that a film should be judged in its own right, and not as an adaptation of the book. Judging it as a film in its own right, it certainly earns a 5-star rating. Some characters had virtually no screen time (Malfoy), but this overall strengthened the film because in spite of Malfoy's flawless performance, the character itself would have hindered the development of the film. Filch was just downright funny. The scene with Dumbledore and Voldemort dueling is terrifying and riveting. It also shows great special effects. It was also nice to see Harry and his friends venture outside Hogwarts grounds. The Ministry of Magic was particularly interesting. I still can't believe what an hilarious buffoon Fudge is! He hires Umbridge who is clearly a twisted maniac (I DON'T CARE HOW MANY KITTEN PHOTOS SHE HAS!) and doesn't believe Dumbledore, who has never failed him before. Fudge is really quite dumb. I'm glad he was replaced as Minister of Magic. I could go on with reasons why I loved this film, but I think you get the point. So, I shall simply thank you for reading this review and give Harry Potter - The Order of the Phoenix 5 stars.P.S.

651239,A16IRCKUPASG2R,B00005JPI2,"F. Ramirez ""F Ra""","[18, 26]","My favorite book has become my least favorite movie in the series. Director David Yates seemed to borrow from Alfonso Cuaron's style of directing and failed miserably.  Rushed and too short by Potter movie standards, this movie left me scratching my head, wondering what the heck just happened. Two of the strongest female characters in the series, Tonks and Bellatrix, were given nothing more than a few seconds of screentime. Huge disappointment. Daniel Radcliffe, though a good actor, seemed a bit too stretched at times. All of the actors simply look exhausted. Gone was the chemistry of past movies. The writers and directors of the series really have to scramble to play into Rowlings book series, but it only makes the movies more and more lackluster, especially to those who do not read the books (most moviegoers). I miss Cuaron's style, his interpretation of the series was brilliant and cannot be topped in my opinion. I'm not looking forward to the rest of the movie series, since the ending was the biggest disappointment in fiction I have ever known. The only brightside to this movie, Helena Bonham Carter. The few seconds she got onscreen were absolutely brilliant. Other than that, this movie was a huge letdown.And regarding the special 2 disc set - don't waste your money!

651240,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,B00005JPI2,Furio,"[1, 1]","Confronted with the huge fifth episode of the Potter's series the authors did the only thing possible: they cut, mercilessly.I know, I know, most of Rowling's fans will hate me for saying this and I am not saying that they could not have cut differently, but there is no way the whole of the book could have come into the movie even if the movie had been an hour longer. Even in the first movie there were no menial cuts despite the first episode being short and straight forward.Personally speaking I disagree about the choice of making this fifth episode the classical, all American instance of the all American underdog, e.g. Harry who at the start of the movie is laughed at or condescended upon even by his protectors and then shows everybody how right he was. Some seeds of this are in the book itself but Ms Rowling was so much more interested (too interested unfortunately) in underlining his isolation, his solitude, his desperation.I disagree with the choice of making a complete fool of Sybil Cooman: she knows very well she is not a greet seeress, she is frustrated, not ridiculous. Ms Thompson of course is a superb actress, even in the questionable and questionably deleted scene of the dessert.I disagree with the decision of making a raving lunatic of Bellatrix: in the books she is obsessed and evil, not ranting. The capabilities of Ms Bonham Carter are wasted.The cuts to the insufferable love ramblings of the characters (the thing I hated in the book) are merciful as, for different reasons, are those to the character of Umbridge. Ms Staunton is a distinguished actress and because of this she perfectly conveys the repulsive character she is playing: more of it would have been too much to bear.All in all the movie was good but not breathtaking: it renders the gloom atmosphere allright but it has no cutting edge. When Fred and George leave the school the real sense of a school which, because of the ministry, has failed to educate two young men who are better off by themselves than in such a setting should be unbearably bitter. What do we have instead? Very nice special effects and a laughter or two.Only when Luna Lovegood is in the spotlight things change: she was the most exquisite character of the book and she is the main feature here: the authors managed to render her being an outsider and the actress is so good as to give her lines their full meaning. Only her permed hair does not make any sense. Of course... could Luna be played by a girl with wavy hair? I think not... ...

In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" Harry and his friends are faced with the fact that the Dark Lord, Voldemort, is back. While they and a group organized by Albus Dumbledore, the Order of the Phoenix, are trying to fight him, they're thwarted by the Ministry of Magic, who first sends Harry to a hearing for using magic to defend himself against Dementors, and then installs Dolores Umbridge as ""High Inquisitor of Hogwarts."" Umbridge does her best to try to take rigid control of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but Harry and his friends mount an active rebellion in the form of Dumbledore's Army -- a secret group in which Harry teaches his friends and classmates powerful Defense Against the Dark Arts.Overall, I found the film solid enough, but as has been mentioned, the longest book in the series was compressed into the smallest ""Harry Potter"" film to date. It seemed to me like they tried to include small bits of just about everything from the book into the film, save Quidditch. Still, while I wasn't entirely satisfied with the film in the theatre, I found I enjoyed it more watching it on DVD. I agree with what's been said about the subtitling, though, in that this should always match what's said word-for-word, not shortened, as so many films seem to have taken to doing lately.I bought the Two-Disc Special Edition of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and I'm glad that I did. The extra features are well worth the additional price. One of the best features is ten minutes of additional scenes, which include Umbridge's interrogation of Trelawney, among others. A lot of fun to watch. You'll also find ""Trailing Tonks."" This is a wonderful feature in which Natalia Tena (the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks) takes you on an exploration of the set for the ""Harry Potter"" movies. You get to visit everywhere from the special effects department to her trailer. There's also ""The Magic of Editing,"" in which the film's director David Yates and editor Mark Day show how editing choices such as music selection and camera angles help to make the film the best it can be. And finally, there's ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter."" This was a TV special that aired on a pay cable/satellite network not long before the film came out. If you saw it before, well worth watching again. If not, enjoy this exploration of past films and this current one for clues to where the series of going.One of the most interesting special features on this DVD is something I haven't seen before, but is really quite cool --- a bonus digital copy of the film!

651248,A26S7BZS9UU3W1,B00005JPI2,Geri,"[1, 1]","This movie had some great special effects and I still love the gang from Hogwarts, but it was also very disappointing.  The story was shortened so badly that elements that should have been emphasized got lost in translation.  If you read the book you could probably follow along, but I feel sorry for those people who just wanted to see the movie.  Too many things weren't explained.The dreams that Harry had about the ministry of magic were a key element in the story, yet they were barely shown in the film.  The attack on Mr Weasley and the ""hunt"" for the prophecy were much too vague in the movie, yet the prophecy and Voldemort's desire for it was the key point of the story.At Hogwarts, the appointment of Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor, and later as the replacecment for Dumbledore, was also a key story line.  She banned groups of three or more students from meeting, which is why they needed a secret place to train together.  She didn't want them to learn defense, so she taught them the book.  She passed one decree after another making life miserable for the stundents, yet that was relegated to simply showing Filch hanging one frame after the other.This movie had very little impact on the understanding of the continuing story of Harry, Hermione and Ron.  The important of the OWLS for the students was downplayed, as was the intense scrutiny of the teachers by Umbridge and her dismissal of Trelawny.  Let's don't forget about the departure of the Weasley twins.  In the film it wasn't much more than a quick fireworks scene and them flying away...not the impact that their leaving should have had.And where the heck was the Order of the Phoenix in all this???  There were very few hints at the Order throughout the film...kinda of defeats the purpose of the title.All in all, I wasn't very satisfied at the end of the film.

651249,A1Q8KFCJOJAHBS,B00005JPI2,Gina,"[1, 1]","This fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is the first that doesn't quite hang together as a movie for me.  Parts of it seem like a dramatization of scenes from the book rather than part of a narrative whole.  That said, it is overall an enjoyable movie and, if you've read the book, you should be able to follow it as such.As usual, the story has been streamlined by cutting characters (Mundungus Fletcher, Rita Skeeter, Marietta) and subplots (house elves at Hogwarts, everything at St. Mungo's, the Quibbler).  This works, although I would have liked to see just a bit of character development for Tonks and Shacklebolt and Mrs. Figg -- it isn't even made clear that she's a squib.  These character just appear, sort of like -- ok, you read about them, so here they are.  Same goes for Kreecher, who shows up muttering twice but whose role in Harry's attempt to rescue Sirius is totally left out.  It was nice to see more of the Weasley twins, though.  The acting is superb, particularly Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry's reaction to Sirius's death and his possession by Voldemort near the end. The sets are wonderful, and the special effects -- as expected -- are spectacular.  I particularly enjoyed Dumbledore's sudden departure from his office, but the Weasley twins' rampage and the Thestrals were also great.  The confrontation in the Hall of Mysteries lived up to all expectations, particularly the breaking glass globes and the chaotic battle scenes, through which Death Eaters flow at will.That said, I really didn't like a lot of the costuming.  Too many characters were dressing like muggles and the Dementors are much scarier when they're shrouded.  In the tunnel scene, they looked like human thestrals.  And the scene between Hermione and Grawp was way too King Kong.

651250,A21XVS00AIENLX,B00005JPI2,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[8, 11]","I didn't read any of the Potter books, and I thought this was a great movie!  This was much better than the other four put together!  I don't know what was left out from the story, but I don't flipping care.  The same happened to Lord of the Rings (which I read), and people still loved it.  When will people learn that books and film are TWO different forms of story-telling media?  You can't put a concentrated, action-packed 3D story onto a two dimensional screen for ten hours straight.  People can barely sit through a ten-hour flight without getting ansy let alone a movie.The acting all around, including the kids of Dumbledore's Army, was superb.  The Luna Lovegood girl was excellent.  The interpretation of Delores Umbridge was delightfully scary to me, especially the way she disciplined her students.  How freakishly calm and distressingly evil she was in her bureacratic pink and prim, Stepford Nazi kind of way.  Give that lady an Oscar.  She was creepy.I hope to see Helena Bonham Carter again as Beatrix LeStrange.  She was scary crazy...and cool!Daniel Radcliffe: He upped the ante.  Those trigger dream sequences and mental struggles were spot on, realistic and much better than what we saw in Goblet of Fire.  Good job!  Going on stage must have really helped.And who can discount the Wizard and Witches Battling--What incredible special effects!  I'll have to admit that does give Lord of the Rings a run for its money, and Lord of the Rings is a classic.  This movie is pretty intense emotionally and suspense wise.  It could classify as an action horror flick on its own.  It's sinster, sinister, sinister.  So Parents, it would be easy for me to say I'd be wary about bringing your little ones to this flick, but it's a Harry Potter film--which is a story about kids.  Go with them to watch it; there are some pretty intense and frightening scenes.Finally, hats off to director David Yates.  Excellent job and great editting.  At first I was not keen on the whole switching director thing, but it's really worked for the Potter series.  Potter endures a tremendous life change, and each director is able to bring out a particular significant vulnerability in Potter's life with each particular story.  Order needed an intense director for an intense storyline.

651251,A1BU237PT26N5J,B00005JPI2,"glo ""glo""","[0, 1]","I got a very very slow start on the HP series, that includes the movies.  I just never seemed to be interested until I got bitten by the bookworm last summer. I've been reading nonstop ever since and my favorite books are the HP books.  The first two HP movies followed the storylines pretty accurately in terms of physical details but couldn't really capture the necessary dark tone that is felt in the later movies.  However, I found the third and fourth movies very flawed because the storylines were significantly changed and/or important characters and scenes were omitted.For a book that is over 800 pages, the fifth HP movie was able to set a balance with the right tone, cinematography, character development, and story line.  I liked that the Deatheaters were given a more gothic appearance with rustic masks, not the tacky silicone looking ones like in the 4th HP movie.  In, the 4th movie, I was highly disappointed by the Voldemort graveyard scenes.  I couldn't take them seriously..everything looked too artifical, the colors looked too saturated.  The battle scenes in the 4th HP movie were laugable.  In this movie, the Dept. of Mysteries's scenes were perfect.  Sure, I wished the movie would have included 10 minutes more during the Dept. of Mysteries for more climax but I understand that there were budget restrictions and what not.  I actually thought that the movie was in some ways better than the book.  I loved the book, don't get me wrong but there were parts of the book that needed condensing and editing.  I like how the movie made Cho (instead of Cho's friend) the culprit for giving away the Room of Requirement and DA.  I also like how the scenes with Grawp and the conflict with the centaurs wasn't drawn out more than necessary.  Also, I think the movie did a good job in portraying the Ministry's control over Hogwarts over a few scenes(i.e. making more Ministry decrees and showing all the DA students scratching painfully away with quills in Umbridge's detention).

651252,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B00005JPI2,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[0, 10]","This was a huge disappointment. The first and third movies gave the most entertaining ride, I think, because they had positive elements that had some hope to offset the overshadowing of evil magicians, death, abusive parents, and school bullies. Phoenix seems like a moneymaker, not an attempt at giving fans a real value for their money.In addition, there was *no* positive influence in this film. Harry looses his godfather before his eyes, learns that Thestrals (demon-horses to students of the occult) are only visible ""if you have seen death"" and are what pull the coaches for the school. The inquisitor tortures Harry and classmates with written punishment that also writes the words in their flesh. He doesn't get to hear the whole prophecy about himself. It breaks and vaporizes. Yet again, he gets into trouble because he refuses to involve good adults, and the plot goes accordingly.There was little humor. Alot of darkness. Which might be expected, since JK said as much...and she is a respected (and rich!) black witch, after all. Her knowledge and oversight over the books and films are absolute, BTW, per contract. So we know there is much realism from a practitioner's POV.What audiences do with that knowledge is up to them. I only think it fair to let people know the ideology of the author, and what they are ingesting mentally as a result. She takes it seriously, it's not ""mere Hollywood"" to her. She is serious about her religion, and her occult worldview. What does that imply about content? Is it possible she is indoctrinating people who don't recognize her faith as readily as they would, say, Roman Catholicism or Islam? So they don't filter it out?I don't recommend HP to God-fearing people for those reasons. And for spiritual purity. The Lord, YHWH, hates witchcraft in all forms.

651256,A2N3N439PRGV3I,B00005JPI2,Gregory Bravo,"[23, 29]","I love Harry Potter, OK?  So before you freak out, let me get that out of the way.  The book version ""Order of the Phoenix"" was oustanding.  I also think that previous directors have done pretty good to great jobs of translating the books to film (though I must say things went a little downhill once Chris Columbus left.)All that being said, here's the kicker:The movie ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" played like a Cliff's Notes adaptation of the book.It lopped off a lot of the charm and romance and heartfelt pathos of the book--- as well as a lot of the pure creative touches--- in order to get the main arc of the story down.  On top of that, it made ""adaptations"" to the book in order to get the story moving along--- yet all these ""compromises"" were actually worse than what JK Rowling originally wrote!Don't believe me?  Here is only SOME of what is wrong with this movie:--Poor devlopment of the Harry/Cho Chang arc (The kiss is about all you get.  No real feeling behind it at all.  No devlopement of Harry's crush.  No final break up argument on Valentine's Day.)--Making Cho into an evil snitch (which is why she and Harry broke up in the movie.)  In the movie SHE is the one who betrays Harry. Stupid.--No hospital scenes.  No meeting of Neville's parents.--Perfunctory explanation of Grimmaud Place--Perfunctory development of Occlumency--Harry gets to hear the prophecy while standing in the Department of Mysteries rather than later with Dumbledore.  On top of this, he gets to hear the prophecy just by holding it in his hand.  That makes no logical sense at all!--The Department of Mysteries itself is compressed down into one room (the room with the prophecies.)  All the cool rooms (with the blue lights, the 12 doors, the clocks, the brains, and so on) are all just ignored.  Those were such tremendous inventions by JK Rowling--perhaps some of the most creative stuff in all the books-- that I can't believe they just cut them!--The room with the arch is made into a really boring place.--The battle scene is really short and rather stupid.--Snape's memory of being tortured by James Potter and his argument with Lily Potter is compressed into literally a total of 4 seconds of film.  That scence is so PIVOTAL to the rest of the book series that I can't believe they got away with not fully developing the scene.On top of all these plot issues, the WORST part about this movie is that there was really no FEELING in it.  The whole range of emotional arcs that are so well-developed in the book are done absolutely terribly in the movie.  Yeah, Sirius dies.  In the book, it is a devatating moment. In the movie, it's like ""Oh, well.""  Harry, Ron and Hermione don't have many moments together.  There is no laughing in the movie.  There are no lighthearted moments.  Almost every scene except one or two that could have developed the emotional attachment we feel to the characters has been summarily excluded.Like one other reviewer said: The movie is too short, yet it feels too long.That is, sorry to say, a perfect description of a hack job.I am quite disappointed.",2,Cliff's Notes Adaptation of the Book,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,3103,"['love', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'OK', 'So', 'freak', 'out', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'book', 'version', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'oustanding', 'also', 'think', 'previous', 'directors', 'have', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'great', 'jobs', 'translating', 'books', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'things', 'went', 'little', 'downhill', 'once', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'left', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'kicker', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'played', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'adaptation', 'book.It', 'lopped', 'off', 'lot', 'charm', 'romance', 'heartfelt', 'pathos', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'pure', 'creative', 'touches', 'order', 'get', 'main', 'arc', 'story', 'down', 'top', 'made', 'adaptations', 'book', 'order', 'get', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'yet', 'compromises', 'were', 'actually', 'worse', 'what', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'originally', 'wrote', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Here', 'only', 'SOME', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Poor', 'devlopment', 'Harry/Cho', 'Chang', 'arc', 'kiss', 'get', 'real', 'feeling', 'devlopement', 'Harry', 'crush', 'final', 'break', 'up', 'argument', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Making', 'Cho', 'evil', 'snitch', 'why', 'Harry', 'broke', 'up', 'movie', 'movie', 'SHE', 'one', 'who', 'Harry', 'Stupid.', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'meeting', 'Neville', 'parents.', 'Perfunctory', 'explanation', 'Grimmaud', 'Place', 'Perfunctory', 'development', 'Occlumency', 'Harry', 'hear', 'prophecy', 'standing', 'Department', 'Mysteries', 'rather', 'later', 'Dumbledore', 'top', 'hear', 'prophecy', 'just', 'holding', 'hand', 'logical', 'sense', 'Department', 'Mysteries', 'compressed', 'down', 'one', 'room', 'room', 'prophecies', 'cool', 'rooms', 'blue', 'lights', '12', 'doors', 'clocks', 'brains', 'so', 'are', 'just', 'ignored', 'were', 'such', 'tremendous', 'inventions', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'perhaps', 'most', 'creative', 'stuff', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'cut', 'room', 'arch', 'made', 'really', 'boring', 'place.', 'battle', 'scene', 'really', 'short', 'rather', 'stupid.', 'Snape', 'memory', 'being', 'tortured', 'James', 'Potter', 'argument', 'Lily', 'Potter', 'compressed', 'literally', 'total', '4', 'seconds', 'film', 'scence', 'so', 'PIVOTAL', 'rest', 'book', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'away', 'not', 'fully', 'developing', 'scene.On', 'top', 'plot', 'issues', 'WORST', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'FEELING', 'whole', 'range', 'emotional', 'arcs', 'are', 'so', 'well-developed', 'book', 'are', 'done', 'absolutely', 'terribly', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'Sirius', 'book', 'devatating', 'moment', 'movie', 'Oh', 'well', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'moments', 'together', 'laughing', 'movie', 'are', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'scene', 'one', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'feel', 'characters', 'been', 'summarily', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'movie', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'long.That', 'sorry', 'say', 'perfect', 'description', 'hack', 'job.I', 'am', 'quite', 'disappointed']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOW""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" works very well in spite of a rushed script, and a gripping climax pushes it into very nice maintenance of the series' extraordinarily high standards of quality.  First-time series director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg present largely top-notch work.The movie's titular 'Order of the Phoenix' is an honor guard of highly decorated Hogwarts teachers and associates who have sworn to protect Harry from the growing threat of a strengthening Lord Voldemort.  In a choppy movie from a narrative point of view, the Order of the Phoenix itself is somewhat a victim of fast cuts and general shortcomings.  It does provide a window into Grimmauld Place, the expressively dark family manse of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  Gary Oldman again delivers a nuanced performance in what is a very important film for his character.Simultaneously one of this movie's strengths and weaknesses, The Ministry of Magic ensures Harry will have enemies inside Hogwarts as well as outside of it.  Due to creative shortcuts, the Ministry is often glossed over in the film.  Ironically, in the book Ms. Rowling spends too much time expounding on it.  A balance could have and should have been achieved.  In the person of Dolores Umbridge, though, falsely sweet insincerity has a monstrous voice.  The name itself can mean 'painful offense.' Esteemed actress Imelda Staunton plays the character very well.Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint again deliver natural camaraderie and acting skills, and are joined by returning colleagues Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Messrs Radcliffe and Rickman have an impressive scene together as Professor Snape ruthlessly attempts to train Harry to resist Voldemort's violent encroachments into his mind.Series newcomer Evanna Lynch makes a positive impression as Luna Lovegood, the offbeat sweetheart whose odd pronouncements always carry an ironic kernel of wisdom.

651258,A1TYKGNEBYLWSG,B00005JPI2,Grimes,"[0, 2]","A great deal of the community has been complaining that the Ultimate Editions have not been extended films after the release of the second film. In the case of Order of the Phoenix, an extended edition is virtually pointless. Before we get to that, let's discuss the packaging:The Ultimate editions come housed in a sleek slip cover that holds a small box. Inside this box we have a little hardcover photo album featuring behind the scenes captions, two lenticular cards (Lovegood and Umbridge) and two discs. One disc has the film while the other has the special features. As for special features, there aren't really any additional ones on top of the two-disc collector's edition from 2007. The newest addition is the hour long documentary part Evolution which is another great installment of the eight part documentary series that can only be found in the Ultimate Editions. The picture quality is wonderful on the Blu-Ray editions. The special feature disc is also Blu-Ray which is a nice touch.As for the film. Order of the Phoenix is the longest Potter book and the shortest film (until Deathly Hallows Part II comes out). The important plot points have all been carried over from the book but it lacks the extra detail that allows us to feel immersed in the wizarding world. There are a few changes that were for the better (in terms of what works on film) and some for the worst. In short, I like the Order of the Phoenix film but I do not think it is the best in terms of adaptation.As for the question of waiting out for an extended edition that is not coming. If we review the removed scenes from Order of the Phoenix we only find ONE scene that is worthy of being integrated into the film. It is an extended look at Umbridge inspecting Trelawney's classroom. It would add a couple minutes to the running time but I do not think it is worth making an extended edition over.The film: 3/5The set: 5/5",5,The Ultimate Edition is Fantastic,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1909,"['great', 'deal', 'community', 'been', 'complaining', 'Ultimate', 'Editions', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'extended', 'films', 'release', 'second', 'film', 'case', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'extended', 'edition', 'virtually', 'pointless', 'get', 'let', 'discuss', 'packaging', 'Ultimate', 'editions', 'come', 'housed', 'sleek', 'slip', 'cover', 'small', 'box', 'box', 'have', 'little', 'hardcover', 'photo', 'album', 'featuring', 'scenes', 'captions', 'two', 'lenticular', 'cards', 'Lovegood', 'Umbridge', 'two', 'discs', 'One', 'disc', 'film', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'additional', 'ones', 'top', 'two-disc', 'collector', 'edition', '2007', 'newest', 'addition', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'part', 'Evolution', 'great', 'installment', 'eight', 'part', 'documentary', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Ultimate', 'Editions', 'picture', 'quality', 'wonderful', 'Blu-Ray', 'editions', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', 'also', 'Blu-Ray', 'nice', 'touch.As', 'film', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'longest', 'Potter', 'book', 'shortest', 'film', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'II', 'out', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'book', 'extra', 'detail', 'feel', 'immersed', 'wizarding', 'world', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'were', 'better', 'terms', 'what', 'film', 'worst', 'short', 'like', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'best', 'terms', 'adaptation.As', 'question', 'waiting', 'out', 'extended', 'edition', 'not', 'coming', 'review', 'removed', 'scenes', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'only', 'find', 'ONE', 'scene', 'worthy', 'being', 'integrated', 'film', 'extended', 'look', 'Umbridge', 'inspecting', 'Trelawney', 'classroom', 'would', 'add', 'couple', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'worth', 'making', 'extended', 'edition', 'over.The', 'film', '3/5The', 'set', '5/5']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651263,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPI2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","Welcome to this long-winded mess of words. And, if you haven't read the book, there's plenty of plot SPOILERS.Having read all of the books at least three times each, I'm a bonafide fan of Harry Potter. And, as the end draws near for this book series, I'm starting to wonder what life would be like without a new Potter entry to look forward to. For years now, with each additional chapter in the life of the Boy Who Lived, J.K. Rowling has brought anticipation and glee into my life. But it's almost done now. It's a reality which looms ever closer, even as Warner Brothers, already looking ahead and thirsting for that next blockbuster franchise, stakes its claim on children's author Angie Sage's Septimus Heap series. Life will go on, of course, because, in the scheme of things, it's really not that big of a deal. And, sure as rain, something'll come to fill in that void, although I doubt it'll be Septimus Heap. Meanwhile, there's this movie that just came out.HARRY POTTER & THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, at a running time of 2 hours and 18 minutes, dares to be briefer than the other Potter films. It's also even darker as it deals quite heftily with Harry's volatile teenaged angst, as well as the steadily worsening climate in the Potter universe. In the prior film,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 4), Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returned to the flesh and celebrated the act with murder. He even had a magical tussle with Harry. But, as ORDER OF THE PHOENIX commences, it's evident as hell that no one but a loyal few believes Harry's story. As Harry later pens to his godfather Sirius Black, even though Harry is back at Hogwarts, he has never felt more alone.The movie begins, of course, with Harry pining and resenting away in sweltering London (his buds have been incommunicado). When he's forced to utilize his Patronus charm on two Dementors to save himself and his bullying cousin Dudley, this becomes a frowned-upon feat deemed worthy of expulsion from Hogwarts. He does get out of that scrape, thanks to a strangely distant Dumbledore, who pleads Harry's case to the Ministry of Magic and then stalks away, leaving Harry futilely calling out his name. Reinstated at Hogwarts, Harry continues to have nightmares about a mysterious door, which then leads him to believe that he has a frightening mental link to Lord Voldemort. Too, Harry's hormones are raging and he persists in a foul mood until an unexpected new friend straightens him out.Meanwhile, all is not right at Hogwarts. The head of the Ministry of Magic, paranoid in these nerve-wracking times and fearing Dumbledore's vast influence, gets a foot in Hogwarts' door by assigning a toadie as the school's new  teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. This person is Dolores Umbridge, officious and pink-clad. Professor Umbridge, breathily vile and prim-and-properly vindictive, does away altogether with practical, hands-on magic learning and, in one quietly chilling scene, punishes Harry for being outspoken. As her status at Hogwarts grows, it becomes clear that, with apologies to Lord Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is the true centerpiece villain of the film.Somewhat lurking in the background, the Order of the Phoenix - the secret society formed to combat and foil Lord Voldemort - continues to affect Harry's life, as more than a few of its members consist of folks near and dear to Harry. The Order makes noise in the beginning and in the climax, but disappears somewhat in the film's middle as the focus shifts to the doings in school. Hermione, alarmed that the students are rendered vulnerable with the lack of training, convinces a reluctant Harry to become, on the sly, their new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. These students call themselves Dumbledore's Army, the core members of which will be later severely tested in a life-or-death wizardly struggle. But, before that, they still have to pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) exams.I went into this screening pretty stoked but not as excited as I perhaps could've been. I was much aware that this film is the lesser of the two upcoming, back-to-back Harry Potter events. Make no mistake, the seventh book is the BIGGER deal and the knowledge of its imminent release took some gloss away from my excitement in this film.Yet, I liked this film, and very much. I like it almost as much as the 3rd and 4th installments, which I thought were the best ones. So, with a few caveats, HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is a very worthwhile entry in the series. The innocence is gone in this series, of course, having been irrevocably crushed with Cedric Diggory's murder in the GOBLET OF FIRE. Absolutely, the films faithfully echo the progressively grimmer tone and mood of the books. And this one is the darkest yet. However, the film still carries moments of zest, such as the Weasley twins' liberating final act of defiance (but where were the swamps?). On occasion, it still cavorts in enchanted whimsy (Umbridge's commemorative plates of cats, the students' Patronus guises). The special effects remain spectacular and, particularly in this movie, serve to briskly move the plot along.The kids are growing up. What we have here is a Harry who's portrayed as realistically as you can get, given the fantastic world he inhabits. Daniel Radcliffe flexes his acting chops and simmers and glowers as young Harry, now fifteen but feeling more isolated than ever and going thru what every fifteen-year-olds go thru, except more so. The rest of the kids are maturing nicely, with Emma Watson still leading the pack in terms of presence and quality of performance. Rupert Grint, he ain't bad, either. Newcomer Evanna Lynch as the wonderfully wonky Luna Lovegood is a welcome addition (but, what is a ""nargle,"" exactly?). The last of the kids to make an impression is Matthew Lewis as the hapless Neville Longbottom, for whom I believe J .K. Rowling has plans.All Shakespearean stage and film adaptations in England must've been put on the backburner as just about every middle-aged Brit actor seems to have poked his or her head thru this particular door (What's Patrick Stewart waiting for?). Not enough of the old reliables get decent screen time, mind you, but Imelda Staunton as  Dolores Umbridge does much to make up for that. I haven't seen anyone convey such sadistic, yet oh-so-polite bureaucractic malice since the last time I was at the DMV. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter, also a freshman here, simply revels in gothic villainy as the unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange. More of her would've been a very good thing.No, it's not a perfect film. It's definitely not for newcomers to the Harry Potter mythos or for those who haven't read the books. The scene transitions are sometimes choppy and disconcerting. People show up without an intro and move in and out of the screen, leaving the audience to follow along, which is no biggie for the constant reader/viewer but might leave rookies to the series scratching their heads. I walked away with this feeling that the film was too short and a bit abrupt. With the book nearly at 900 pages, there's simply no way to include and then amply cover all the fun stuff and the key moments. Frankly, I expected more of the Weasly twins' final rebellious prank at Hogwarts, but, alas, there wasn't enough all-out anarchy in their festivities. Also, an important element - Sirius's growing recklessness and feelings of moroseness and futility - is barely touched on. Not to mention, the film deals differently with the ferreting out of Dumbledore's Army. And not enough Room of Requirement. But the most galling thing about this film (and the book, too, come to think of it): no friggin' Quidditch! But, you do get to see Harry and Cho snogging under a mistletoe.Enough of my yak. This is a four star motion picture, leaner and meaner, starring your favorite, lightning scarred boy wizard. The film series has now gotten to that stage where sleeves are tugged up and knuckles are cracked, all in preparation for some serious work ahead. Time to get down and dirty. So, climb onboard. The end may be around the corner, but, for now, the series is picking up some serious momentum.Meanwhile, make sure the nargles are kept away, whatever they are.",4,I didn't realize pink was the color

We are definitely rental people since there are very few movies I want to see more than once but this one we own.  I have probably seen this one about five times and think it's great each and every time.My view is that you have to look at the movie as if it's a movie - not the book come to life.  A movie cannot possibly contain all that is in a massive book and the viewer shouldn't expect that.  As a stand-alone movie, it's wonderful!  My husband and one of my best friends have never read a HP book and still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  My daughter and I are avid HP fans reading all the books multiple times and we love the movie -- that's pretty high praise in my book.  Once you view the movie after reading all seven books, you can see where there are subtle hints of what is to come but those would be almost impossible to notice if you haven't completed the series.The books get darker as the series progresses and that is reflected in the movies.

651268,A29UO9GBSQXS72,B00005JPI2,Horror Spooky,"[0, 0]","The tagline might have your jaw drop, but I stand by the statement and it is completely and utterly true. I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I always found Order of the Phoenix to be a downright drag that was far too long and far too boring. However, this film adaptation really takes the best and most important parts of the book and puts it on the big screen in quite the perfect fashion.What I really like about this film is the dialogue is really well written and all of the actors play their parts spectacularly. Umbridge is an evil witch and she's the perfect antagonist throughout the story, and everyone from Dumbledore to Fudge does a great job during their screen time. The famous and memorable musical score created for the first film is intact for Order of the Phoenix and it's still just as awesome as it has been for the previous four years.But what keeps this film from being perfect? The CGI is still not the best. Granted, the Potter films stay away from CGI for a majority of the films (WHICH I LOVE...THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!), but when there is CGI, it generally looks rather pathetic. Still, there are some cool special effects to enjoy that will astonish you, even if you're some big film buff that thinks they've seen it all.The plot moves along at a rather quick pace, but not quick to the point that it's jarring. I'd say the plot moves perfectly, with enough action and emotion mixed in with some humor and character development. One of the most shocking moments of the film is, for some reason or another, really not given that much importance or screen time. Missed opportunity, but it doesn't ruin the film in the least.You'll love this film whether you're a Harry Potter fan or not. It was done masterfully, with my gripes being some untaken chances with the plot and the poor CGI in some areas. Still, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of magic and mayhem in the kind of way that only Potter can provide.",4,The movie's better than the book,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,1979,"['tagline', 'might', 'have', 'jaw', 'drop', 'stand', 'statement', 'completely', 'utterly', 'true', 'have', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'always', 'found', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'downright', 'drag', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'far', 'too', 'boring', 'However', 'film', 'adaptation', 'really', 'best', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'perfect', 'fashion.What', 'really', 'like', 'film', 'dialogue', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'spectacularly', 'Umbridge', 'evil', 'witch', 'perfect', 'antagonist', 'story', 'everyone', 'Dumbledore', 'Fudge', 'great', 'job', 'screen', 'time', 'famous', 'memorable', 'musical', 'score', 'created', 'first', 'film', 'intact', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'awesome', 'been', 'previous', 'four', 'years.But', 'what', 'film', 'being', 'perfect', 'CGI', 'still', 'not', 'best', 'Granted', 'Potter', 'films', 'stay', 'away', 'CGI', 'majority', 'films', 'WHICH', 'LOVE', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'when', 'CGI', 'generally', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'Still', 'are', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'enjoy', 'will', 'astonish', 'even', ""'re"", 'big', 'film', 'buff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'all.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'rather', 'quick', 'pace', 'not', 'quick', 'point', 'jarring', ""'d"", 'say', 'plot', 'perfectly', 'enough', 'action', 'emotion', 'mixed', 'humor', 'character', 'development', 'One', 'most', 'shocking', 'moments', 'film', 'reason', 'really', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'importance', 'screen', 'time', 'Missed', 'opportunity', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'least.You', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', ""'re"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'not', 'was', 'done', 'masterfully', 'gripes', 'being', 'untaken', 'chances', 'plot', 'poor', 'CGI', 'areas', 'Still', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'magic', 'mayhem', 'kind', 'way', 'only', 'Potter', 'can', 'provide']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651275,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B00005JPI2,James Duckett,"[4, 5]","A lot of my annoyances in previous Harry Potter movies have been the changes, diversion, and other ""artistic privileges"" taken while adapting the book into a movie.Of the five Harry Potter movies thus far, I think this one stayed more true to the book than any of the others.  And let me tell you, that means a lot to me.Otherwise, there were very few other flaws.The acting was fantastic.  These kid actors have really graduated into true actors.  Of all of them, I think there was only one who was a little bit too over-the-top still.  But Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter was spot-on.  Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley could not have done a better job as Harry's most noble friend and protector.Two performances really stood out for me.  The first was Gary Oldman who has always been a standout performer.  I think he really outdid himself as Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black.  It is too bad that this will be his last appearance in these films unless there is something I don't know about in the seven book (9 more days!!!  I can't wait!).  The other performance was by the newcomer of the series, Evanna Lynch, who could not have played the ""dreamy"" Luna Lovegood any better.  She did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing her throughout the rest of the series.The special effects were awesome, especially with the showdown between Dumbledore and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the end of the movie.  I think the entire theater were on the edge of their seats!  Also, the training of Dumbledore's Army was beautifully done.Like the books and the other movies, there was a lot of good humor throughout the movie.  The scene I was most looking forward to was the scene involving the twins when they can't take the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher anymore.  The entire theater was laughing their heads off.  It was great and couldn't have been done better.  That scene was one of the highlights this gem of a movie.I now remember one of my frustrations when I reviews this book when it first came out, and that was how emotionally charged Harry Potter was.  I thought he spent the first half of the book just being a jerk.  The movie actually did a better job than the book of showing WHY he was upset and angry and overly emotional.  Again, I think the fine talents of Gary Oldman helped with this.  But the director did a fantastic job of actually SHOWING us what Harry Potter was going through and why he was so emotionally charged.I think in the end, this will be one of the stronger movies.  Those who have read the book will finally have a movie to see they won't be groaning to throughout.  I was glad to hear the same director (David Yates) will helm the next movie and I hope he continues the excellent work he put into this movie.This easily deserves five stars!",5,A True Adaption,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,2780,"['lot', 'annoyances', 'previous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'changes', 'diversion', 'other', 'artistic', 'privileges', 'taken', 'adapting', 'book', 'movie.Of', 'five', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'thus', 'far', 'think', 'one', 'stayed', 'more', 'true', 'book', 'others', 'let', 'tell', 'lot', 'me.Otherwise', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'flaws.The', 'acting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'kid', 'actors', 'have', 'really', 'graduated', 'true', 'actors', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'still', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'spot-on', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Harry', 'most', 'noble', 'friend', 'protector.Two', 'performances', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'first', 'was', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'standout', 'performer', 'think', 'really', 'outdid', 'Harry', 'Godfather', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'too', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'appearance', 'films', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'seven', 'book', '9', 'more', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'other', 'performance', 'was', 'newcomer', 'series', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'played', 'dreamy', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'better', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'series.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'awesome', 'especially', 'showdown', 'Dumbledore', 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named', 'end', 'movie', 'think', 'entire', 'theater', 'were', 'edge', 'seats', 'Also', 'training', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'was', 'beautifully', 'books', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'lot', 'good', 'humor', 'movie', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'looking', 'forward', 'was', 'scene', 'involving', 'twins', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'new', 'Defense', 'Against', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'teacher', 'anymore', 'entire', 'theater', 'was', 'laughing', 'heads', 'was', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'gem', 'movie.I', 'now', 'remember', 'one', 'frustrations', 'when', 'reviews', 'book', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'thought', 'spent', 'first', 'half', 'book', 'just', 'being', 'jerk', 'movie', 'actually', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'book', 'showing', 'WHY', 'was', 'upset', 'angry', 'overly', 'emotional', 'Again', 'think', 'fine', 'talents', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'helped', 'director', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'actually', 'SHOWING', 'what', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'going', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'emotionally', 'charged.I', 'think', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'stronger', 'movies', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'finally', 'have', 'movie', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'groaning', 'was', 'glad', 'hear', 'same', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'will', 'helm', 'next', 'movie', 'hope', 'excellent', 'work', 'put', 'movie.This', 'easily', 'five', 'stars']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

The imagination of this director and the author is out of this world.One drawback though - the books are popular for children as we all know.

Though Harry potter V  lacks some of intensity of the last film Goblet of Fire had midway through it. It makes up however with decent acting and phonimal special effectss. But some parts needed to be removed or shorten to speed up the movie.  Th scene when harry is put on trial for using a protnaus charm when he and his mean cousin doudley are attacked by dementors. Unfortunately some of the vitally important scene like Harry going to the department of Minstry was drastically altered from the book and sirus blacks role was drastically reduce to speed up the plot. As well which may have spoiled this film for some of Fans of the series who had to high expectatios. Other than several other changes and some other parrts that were cut out including Harry being banned from Quiditch as one of his punishments for try to tell the truth. Depsite this the film is still phonimally good or a stinko ro depending on how high your expectations are. So you will either fall in love with this film our you'll want to take a flamethrower to it depends on what your expantations are. After Harry break the laws of underage sorcery he is put on trial and almost thrown out of school. But the charges are over thrown he goes back to school. In the book this scene went on forever. Cornelous Fudge is so desperate to keep his job and to keep Harry quiet he even uses past magical violations of Harry Potter's including the infamous floating cake done by Dobby the house elf to get Harry Potter convicted. Unfortunaely he fales to persuade enough of the Jury in both the film and book. We also get a new teacher Proffesor Umbrige from Harry's trial becomes the new defense against the dark arts teacher she makes life miserable for the students especialy Harry Potter. Even though at least half of her cruel and sinster rules and tutor scenes were cut out you will loave her from beginning to end making her the perfect villian. You actually barely see Voldermort in any of the movies he usually does not appear until the finally of ever movie except Prizonner of Askaban in which he was excluded and replace with Wormtail instead at the end of the finally. You she him sliglyt more in this one and in the Goblet of Fire but not much. Can Harry figure out what the vision he is seeing are and what Voldermort is up to before its to late. Will the school find away to ride it of the  vile and wretched Proffesor Umbridg and hat fate lies in store for the current Secret society or Order of the phonix members? To find out these answers read Harry Potter and the half blood prince and the Deathly Hallows to find out what becomes of the order. To find out if Voldermort's plains for this installement succeds find out in the thrilling action packed and tear jerking conclusion to this 2005 clasic movie. Will Harry stop Voldermort and what terrible price will he have to pay stop the mysterious item located deep in the depths of the Depapartment of Mysters from falling into Voldermort's filth, vile, and wrinkly hands.",5,A phonominal film despite the massive alturations and abriging of scenes.,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,3201,"['movie', 'been', 'drastiucally', 'cut', 'book', 'still', 'scenes', 'not', 'cut', 'are', 'phonimally', 'well', 'couragraphed', 'musice', 'awasome.The', 'best', 'five', 'scores', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'far', 'Harry', 'potter', 'V', 'intensity', 'last', 'film', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'had', 'midway', 'up', 'however', 'decent', 'acting', 'phonimal', 'special', 'effectss', 'parts', 'needed', 'be', 'removed', 'shorten', 'speed', 'up', 'movie', 'Th', 'scene', 'when', 'harry', 'put', 'trial', 'using', 'protnaus', 'charm', 'when', 'mean', 'cousin', 'doudley', 'are', 'attacked', 'dementors', 'Unfortunately', 'vitally', 'important', 'scene', 'Harry', 'going', 'department', 'Minstry', 'was', 'drastically', 'altered', 'book', 'sirus', 'blacks', 'role', 'was', 'drastically', 'reduce', 'speed', 'up', 'plot', 'As', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'spoiled', 'film', 'Fans', 'series', 'who', 'had', 'high', 'expectatios', 'Other', 'several', 'other', 'changes', 'other', 'parrts', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'including', 'Harry', 'being', 'banned', 'Quiditch', 'one', 'punishments', 'try', 'tell', 'truth', 'Depsite', 'film', 'still', 'phonimally', 'good', 'stinko', 'ro', 'depending', 'how', 'high', 'expectations', 'are', 'will', 'either', 'fall', 'love', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'take', 'flamethrower', 'what', 'expantations', 'are', 'Harry', 'break', 'laws', 'underage', 'sorcery', 'put', 'trial', 'almost', 'thrown', 'school', 'charges', 'are', 'back', 'school', 'book', 'scene', 'went', 'forever', 'Cornelous', 'Fudge', 'so', 'desperate', 'keep', 'job', 'keep', 'Harry', 'quiet', 'even', 'past', 'magical', 'violations', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'including', 'infamous', 'floating', 'cake', 'done', 'Dobby', 'house', 'elf', 'get', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'convicted', 'Unfortunaely', 'persuade', 'enough', 'Jury', 'film', 'book', 'also', 'get', 'new', 'teacher', 'Proffesor', 'Umbrige', 'Harry', 'trial', 'new', 'defense', 'dark', 'life', 'miserable', 'students', 'especialy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Even', 'least', 'half', 'cruel', 'sinster', 'rules', 'tutor', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'will', 'loave', 'beginning', 'end', 'making', 'perfect', 'villian', 'actually', 'barely', 'see', 'Voldermort', 'movies', 'usually', 'not', 'appear', 'finally', 'ever', 'movie', 'Prizonner', 'Askaban', 'was', 'excluded', 'replace', 'Wormtail', 'instead', 'end', 'finally', 'sliglyt', 'more', 'one', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'not', 'much', 'Can', 'Harry', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'vision', 'seeing', 'are', 'what', 'Voldermort', 'up', 'before', 'late', 'Will', 'school', 'find', 'away', 'ride', 'vile', 'wretched', 'Proffesor', 'Umbridg', 'hat', 'fate', 'lies', 'store', 'current', 'Secret', 'society', 'Order', 'phonix', 'members', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'half', 'blood', 'prince', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'Voldermort', 'plains', 'installement', 'succeds', 'find', 'out', 'thrilling', 'action', 'packed', 'tear', 'jerking', 'conclusion', '2005', 'clasic', 'movie', 'Will', 'Harry', 'stop', 'Voldermort', 'what', 'terrible', 'price', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'stop', 'mysterious', 'item', 'located', 'deep', 'depths', 'Depapartment', 'Mysters', 'falling', 'Voldermort', 'filth', 'vile', 'wrinkly', 'hands']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Voldemort is back, but not in the open, and the ministry is ignoring it. The Minister of Magic feels threatened by Dumbledore and Potter and has been exerting control over the wizarding press to make it seem like they are both insane liars. This somber turn of events allows Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to discuss deeper topics than in previous Harry Potter installments; topics like government corruption and control, freedom of the press, corporal punishment, etc. The film also examines public responsibility in the midst of totalitarian government through the lens of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron's underground Defense of the Dark Arts class known as Dumbledore's Army. Hefty material for a series most people look at as children's fantasy fiction, huh?Teens approaching Harry Potter's age already deal with issues of rebellion and angst, but in times as hard as those facing Harry in Phoenix, those feelings are heightened. When I first read the book I thought that Harry was being a bit of a brat throughout this installment, but now I realize is the magnitude of what he was dealing with. He saw the most dangerous wizard of all time rise from a place between death and life and watched him murder a fellow classmate, yet no one believes him when he recounts this information.  Dumbledore, Harry's mentor and father figure, seems to completely ignore him, and the government interferes with the dealings of Hogwarts, the one place Harry holds sacred. Radcliffe does a great job at giving life to Harry's turmoil during this installment, and it seems that the entire youthful cast is continuously growing as actors. I'm sure working with several directors and brilliant veteran actors helped them through the process.Once again, a new director takes over the reigns of the series in Phoenix. The choice of David Yates as the fourth and final director of the series was kind of a surprise. Prior to Order of the Phoenix Yates had only directed television movies, so many people were unsure about this somewhat untested talent. There was no need to worry in my opinion. Not only did Yates make one of the best movies of the series, he also turned the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest movie without making it feel rushed or leaving any plot holes.Mostly featuring returning cast members that were basically absent for an installment (Gary Oldman has a much bigger part, and David Thewlis is back after being absent from Goblet of Fire), Order of the Phoenix doesn't contain very many new characters, but the few that are there represent quite a coup d'etat in casting. Finding newcomer Evanna Lynch for the role of Luna Lovegood was a brilliant feat in and of itself, and the role of Professor Umbridge is brilliantly played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Freedom Writers), who brings Umbridge's toad-like qualities to life. Also joining the cast is the always marvelous Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Hamlet) as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange.I find this film to be better than Goblet of Fire, but it's still not without its failings. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore still doesn't match up to J.K. Rowling's description of the character. While better than he was in the previous film, Gambon's Dumbledore still  doesn't create an impression of being the greatest wizard alive. I was also disappointed that certain details concerning the prophecy didn't make it into the film. In the book, you learn that the prophecy didn't explicitly mean that Harry would be Voldemort's enemy, but that it could have applied to another student at Hogwarts. It's not central to the plot, but I felt this was an interesting fact that viewers of the movie who haven't read the books missed out on.Critically, Order of the Phoenix is at the low end of the Potter films, tied for last place with Philosopher's Stone. At the box office, it continued the rise in box office receipts started with Goblet of Fire, surpassing it to become the second- highest grossing film of the series and of the year, with $938.2 million grossed worldwide. As this occurred with a summer release, those who thought that Prisoner of Azkaban grossed lower due to the release date were proven wrong. Of course, with its shorter run time and what is arguably the most brilliant scene of the series, Order of the Phoenix turned into quite the overall success.",4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,4468,"['lot', 'changed', 'wizarding', 'world', 'summer', 'Harry', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'years', 'Hogwarts', 'Voldemort', 'back', 'not', 'open', 'ministry', 'ignoring', 'Minister', 'Magic', 'feels', 'threatened', 'Dumbledore', 'Potter', 'been', 'exerting', 'control', 'wizarding', 'press', 'make', 'seem', 'are', 'insane', 'liars', 'somber', 'turn', 'events', 'allows', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'discuss', 'deeper', 'topics', 'previous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'installments', 'topics', 'government', 'corruption', 'control', 'freedom', 'press', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'etc', 'film', 'also', 'public', 'responsibility', 'midst', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'lens', 'Harry', 'Hermoine', 'Ron', 'underground', 'Defense', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'class', 'known', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'Hefty', 'material', 'series', 'most', 'people', 'look', 'children', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'huh', 'approaching', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'age', 'already', 'deal', 'issues', 'rebellion', 'angst', 'times', 'as', 'hard', 'facing', 'Harry', 'Phoenix', 'feelings', 'are', 'heightened', 'When', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'thought', 'Harry', 'was', 'being', 'bit', 'brat', 'installment', 'now', 'realize', 'magnitude', 'what', 'was', 'dealing', 'saw', 'most', 'dangerous', 'wizard', 'time', 'rise', 'place', 'death', 'life', 'watched', 'murder', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'yet', 'one', 'when', 'information', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'mentor', 'father', 'figure', 'completely', 'ignore', 'government', 'dealings', 'Hogwarts', 'one', 'place', 'Harry', 'sacred', 'Radcliffe', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'life', 'Harry', 'turmoil', 'installment', 'entire', 'youthful', 'cast', 'continuously', 'growing', 'actors', ""'m"", 'sure', 'working', 'several', 'directors', 'brilliant', 'veteran', 'actors', 'helped', 'process.Once', 'again', 'new', 'director', 'reigns', 'series', 'Phoenix', 'choice', 'David', 'Yates', 'fourth', 'final', 'director', 'series', 'was', 'kind', 'surprise', 'Prior', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Yates', 'had', 'only', 'directed', 'television', 'movies', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'unsure', 'somewhat', 'untested', 'talent', 'was', 'need', 'worry', 'opinion', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Yates', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'series', 'also', 'turned', 'longest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'shortest', 'movie', 'making', 'feel', 'rushed', 'leaving', 'plot', 'holes.Mostly', 'featuring', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'basically', 'absent', 'installment', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'much', 'bigger', 'part', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'back', 'being', 'absent', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Order', 'Phoenix', ""n't"", 'contain', 'very', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'few', 'are', 'there', 'represent', 'quite', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'casting', 'Finding', 'newcomer', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'role', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'was', 'brilliant', 'feat', 'role', 'Professor', 'Umbridge', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Vera', 'Drake', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'who', 'Umbridge', 'toad-like', 'qualities', 'life', 'Also', 'joining', 'cast', 'always', 'marvelous', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Hamlet', 'evil', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange.I', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'better', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'still', 'not', 'failings', 'Gambon', 'portrayal', 'Dumbledore', 'still', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'description', 'character', 'better', 'was', 'previous', 'film', 'Gambon', 'Dumbledore', 'still', ""n't"", 'create', 'impression', 'being', 'greatest', 'wizard', 'alive', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'certain', 'details', 'concerning', 'prophecy', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'book', 'learn', 'prophecy', 'did', ""n't"", 'explicitly', 'mean', 'Harry', 'would', 'be', 'Voldemort', 'enemy', 'could', 'have', 'applied', 'student', 'Hogwarts', 'not', 'central', 'plot', 'felt', 'was', 'interesting', 'fact', 'viewers', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'missed', 'out', 'on.Critically', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'low', 'end', 'Potter', 'films', 'tied', 'last', 'place', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'box', 'office', 'continued', 'rise', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'started', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'surpassing', 'become', 'second-', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'series', 'year', '938.2', 'million', 'grossed', 'worldwide', 'occurred', 'summer', 'release', 'who', 'thought', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'grossed', 'lower', 'due', 'release', 'date', 'were', 'proven', 'wrong', 'course', 'shorter', 'run', 'time', 'what', 'arguably', 'most', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'series', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'turned', 'overall', 'success']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended Cut.What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.Then Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblit of fire Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for Order of the phonex and Half blood prince. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want,AN EXTENDED CUT.I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want?

The rapidity with which the action developed and new characters appeared with little or no exposition was unsettling. My husband, a slight HP fan who enjoyed the previous movies, remarked on the way home he'd understood very little of the plot. When I explained the relationships between some of the characters and provided a little basckground, he asked irately, ""And I was supposed to know this how?"" Exactly. Even I, devoted HP reader and movie watcher, had the sense that ""Order of the Phoenix"" was 128 minutes of previews for the REAL movie--which I'd love to see!

Still, that doesn't mean they hold back on spectactular acting.The parts of Umbridge and Voldemort were played so well that any fan of great acting should not miss this film.With respect to Voldemort, his physical play of the role is spectacular, the way he taunts, tortures, and relishes in the torment of his victims--like he's bursting with joy with each shriek of horror.Umbridge is also one who meticulously has played her part as sweet to the point of bitterness, defiling the world with a fresh coat of pink paint, a gallon too much of perfume, about five layers over made up, and with no moral conscience as she makes daily life a seething hell of unjust rules and punishments.Both are utterly convincing.I suppose if the movie lacks anything, it's a good bit of comic relief.  The Weasley Twins provide proper mischief as their farewell to academia, but perhaps they could have added something--since they took such liberties with all the other books with negative effect--to make, say, the scene where Umbridge is lead into the woods to be taken away by its residents a bit more of a laugh.  As it was, such scenes that should have been humorous were just cogs in the story.Setting and scenery are the best yet in this film.  Everything seems real, nothing contrived, every act of magic made so that it doesn't appear the least bit cartoonish or 'Disney.'BOTTOM LINE: An excellent film.

This book should never have been compressed into a two hour film.  It is simply cut way too short.  Although the storyline was great, if Ihadn't read the book, I might not even know what is going on.  The pace is choppy and too fast.2.  Dolores Jane Umbridge was as good as you could have hoped for.  But again, the film cut things too short.  There was hardly any time to get the gist of her character or appreciate what is going on.  Alot of good parts of the book are left out altogether.3.  Ron hardly said anything.  It seemed to me like he didn't even want to be in the film this time.4.  Alas, the first Dumbledore was just plain better.  I say this not because Dumbledore 2 is a bad actor.  Just that the very character of Dumbledore doesn't fit guy #2.  Dumbledore was always calm, smiling, courteous.....in control, no matter how tough the situation.  The new guy is a firecracker- tempermental, worried, quick to anger.  It just misses the charm that the Dumbledore character had, and what made him an extraordinary person.5.  Great special effects as usual.6.  There is some kind of tension among the ""kids"".  They just don't seem relaxed around each other.

651304,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B00005JPI2,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[4, 7]","There is always a ""black sheep"" to every movie franchise. We've seen many examples in recent times. Unfortunately, even successful ones like Harry Potter are not immune to this sequel ""curse."" Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably the dullest of the series. What happened to the Magic? Where is the charm and sense of adventure of previous installments? It is inexcusably long with very little magical moments, but plenty of dialogue and full of political themes. The whole thing feels tiresome, forced, and distant. I'm sorry if I say this, but Harry Potter movies are played out.Brief Story Intro:Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) gets in deep trouble with the Ministry of Magic for underage magic--he had to use his powers because two Dementors came out of nowhere and attacked him and his cousin. Fortunately Harry is not alone for this trial, professor Mad-Eye (Brendan Gleeson) along with many friends take him to Sirius`s home which is also the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix--a secret organization who is getting ready for a war against Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). They know they have to be prepared. The day of the trial, Harry is exonerated with the help of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and her charismatic neighbor who saw part of what happened. But Harry has bigger problems than this.There is a sense of paranoia and uncertainty in the wizard community. The Ministry of Magic led by Cornelius Fudge strongly denies the return of Voldemort and does everything to neutralize anyone who believes in it--apparently they operate like a socialist government. He even appoints the evil Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to be a member of Hogwarts' staff, so she can easily spy on the students. She uses her influences to ban all use of magic. Meanwhile Harry and his friends are getting ready to fight Voldemort's army--by secretly practicing their magic--but he feels that there is an evil connection between him and the Dark Lord. Will he be able to face Voldemort one more time?Review:Unfortunately there are things that simply do not work this time around. The magical discoveries, the lovely friendship and the adventures are almost nonexistent. All replaced with political issues, hateful new characters, few special effects and an insecure Potter.Some might argue saying things like the franchise is maturing to a higher level. It is an excuse and I must disagree. Of course the series can evolve, but it doesn't mean that it has to ""sacrifice"" the very reason the audience--especially the fans--come to see these films. Just to be entertained by watching Potter's adventures. The story is right on the money though--it is an interesting chapter indeed--but the way it is presented is where the problem begins. Phoenix is just a tiresome affair. It is long, slow-paced, soapy and draggy. Even some of the actors look tired of playing their roles, including Daniel Radcliffe whose character is very insecure and mostly angry throughout the film.Frustrating are those moments where I desperately wanted something exciting or ""cool"" to happen. Sadly those moments are few and far between. Let's talk about the ""training"" scenes where Harry and company are preparing to go to war with Voldemort. Director David Yates, who has done mostly TV movies, misses a great opportunity here. Instead of providing an exciting display of magic acts, he--somehow--manages to create the dullest moment of the series (I've seen every film). How are we supposed to get excited about a bunch of teenagers playing with their magic wands? The ""rebellion"" scene against Dolores Umbridge is another letdown of the film. It feels forced and has the Pink Floyd the Wall flavor to it.Not everything is lost in Phoenix. There are some good moments of tension between Dolores (probably the most hated character of the franchise) and Harry. Also the giant--who strikingly resembles Alfred from Mad Magazine--shows up and gives us some charming moments. But one of the best highlights of the film is the final battle.

651306,A164D2I3CT3LLF,B00005JPI2,J. Silberman,"[3, 5]","While Goblet of Fire was a coming of age film, OOTP is the first adult film of the Harry Potter series. The three kids are now teens forced to grow up quickly as has always been true in times of war. Given the ending of the last film with the death of Cedric, this film is necessarily dark. Harry and his friends are now playing for keeps in an adult world. The growing complexity of Rowling's plot line is making each film much more challenging than its predecessor. Film can never satisfy in the same way as a book because the decisions regarding imagery are left to the reader, while it is the director who decides for his audience. No film can capture in less than two hours the content of a 700 plus page book. Nevertheless, OOTP was satisfying and on a second viewing, I reconciled myself to the frequent jump cuts which David Yates employed to squeeze in as much content as possible. Potter fans will enjoy OOTP, but those who have not read the books may find the film not much more than eye candy. Yates did a serviceable job, but of all the directors who have been associated with a Potter film, my favorite was Alfonso Curion, director of Prisoner of Azkaban. That film flowed seamlessly; beautifully integrating the complexities of plot line and character development. His directorial style grasped the intrinsic charm of the Potter fantasy. Curion's flair for fantasy was even more famously demonstrated in the oscar nominated Pan's Labyrinth released last year. I know that David Yates has already been selected to do the next film, The Half Blood Prince,  but perhaps Curion could be hired to do the Deathly Hallows, which will naturally be the most important one of the lot.",3,OOTP Is The First Adult Film of the HP Series,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1689,"['Goblet', 'Fire', 'was', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'OOTP', 'first', 'adult', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'three', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'teens', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'quickly', 'always', 'been', 'true', 'times', 'war', 'Given', 'ending', 'last', 'film', 'death', 'Cedric', 'film', 'necessarily', 'dark', 'Harry', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'playing', 'keeps', 'adult', 'world', 'growing', 'complexity', 'Rowling', 'plot', 'line', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'predecessor', 'Film', 'can', 'never', 'satisfy', 'same', 'way', 'book', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'imagery', 'are', 'left', 'reader', 'director', 'who', 'audience', 'film', 'can', 'capture', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'content', '700', 'page', 'book', 'Nevertheless', 'OOTP', 'was', 'satisfying', 'second', 'viewing', 'reconciled', 'frequent', 'jump', 'cuts', 'David', 'employed', 'squeeze', 'as', 'much', 'content', 'possible', 'Potter', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'OOTP', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'did', 'serviceable', 'job', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'associated', 'Potter', 'film', 'favorite', 'was', 'Alfonso', 'Curion', 'director', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'film', 'flowed', 'seamlessly', 'beautifully', 'integrating', 'complexities', 'plot', 'line', 'character', 'development', 'directorial', 'style', 'grasped', 'intrinsic', 'charm', 'Potter', 'fantasy', 'Curion', 'flair', 'fantasy', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'famously', 'demonstrated', 'oscar', 'nominated', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'know', 'David', 'Yates', 'already', 'been', 'selected', 'do', 'next', 'film', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'perhaps', 'Curion', 'could', 'be', 'hired', 'do', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'will', 'naturally', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'one', 'lot']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

But on the other hand, it's so empty.Remember the delight you felt watching the earlier films? It's gone! There's no joy in this one, and without it the fact that nothing much happens to advance the plot makes the whole thing kind of a drag. In the other movies I especially liked the charisma of Hermione and Ron, and in this film I don't know if either of them smiled once. Even Harry's first kiss has had the fun sucked out of it. Perhaps that's all inevitable, as of course everything here is based on the book. But in this case the 800-page novel didn't become the 2-hour movie without losing much of its appeal.That said, of course I bought it! I'm a huge fan of this series, and know the characters so well that even these mediocre moments are still entertaining to watch.

651309,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B00005JPI2,Justin G.,"[4, 4]","My expectations were quite high for the film adaptation ofHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5), especially given the previous Harry Potter films extraordinarily high quality, so this movie had a lot to live up to. How did it measure up? Read on...Adaptation - Adapting a nearly 900 page novel for film has to be a daunting task. There is just too much going on in the novel to fit cleanly into a 2+ hour movie, so of course there are some omissions that will no doubt infuriate some Harry Potter fanatics. The main events are all there, but they've all been modified somewhat to cover for the elements that are missing. This is the first time I've felt that the story was changed significantly for the film adaptation, and while it may not be noticeable to those who haven't read the book, for the rest of us it seems a bit like the Reader's Digest version of Order of the Phoenix.Acting - The acting in this film is first rate as always. Daniel Radcliffe seems surer of himself this time around, and while Rupert Grint and Emma Watson don't have as prominent a role this time around, they still give admirable performances. All of the regulars are great, but they're completely overshadowed by a pair of newcomers, Imelda Staunton as the delightfully devilish Professor Umbridge and Evanna Lynch's completely charming Luna Lovegood.Direction - David Yates does a great job in his initial foray into the world of Harry Potter. The fast pace keeps viewers engaged (blink and you'll miss something) while constantly moving forward to the confrontation we all know is coming. In keeping with both the book and the previous films, Order of the Phoenix is a very dark movie. It gives the impression that things can only get worse from here.Everything Else - There were a lot of highlights to this movie. The Dumbledore's Army scenes were fantastic, as were the flights over London. The Thestrals are far and away the best creatures used in the films. The chemistry between Harry and Luna was so intense that if you didn't know better you'd swear they were setting up a romantic storyline for those two. Ginny Weasley may not have said much, but her sideline glances, particularly towards Harry and Cho, spoke volumes. And of course there is the final battle at the Ministry of Magic. I've visualized it in my head so many times that no movie could ever completely satisfy, but it sure came close. The constant smoky apparations were a bit distracting, and I'd have preferred to see more one-on-one attention to the Death Eater/Dumbledore's Army/Order of the Phoenix battles, but as a whole I thought it was as good as any recent Star Wars lightsaber battle, particularly the showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort. That was one seriously intense encounter!DVD Extras - The 2-disc version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix offers up the typical array of unused scenes, documentary footage, etc. I was hoping for more in terms of deleted scenes (say another 2 hours or so!), but I guess that was wishful thinking. The most promising extra feature ended up being the most frustrating. A flyer inside the box offers a free digital version of the film that you can store on your computer or portable device - but the small print goes on to inform you that if you have a Mac or an iPod this feature will not work. What a way to take a great bonus feature and exclude nearly all of the people who would be likely to benefit from it!That frustration aside, I was quite pleased with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It seemed a bit rushed at times, and serious disciples of the novels may be a bit distracted noting all of the differences between the book and the movie, but as a whole I think the movie works quite well, and is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter DVD library.",4,"Great movie, but not for your iPod!",1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3803,"['expectations', 'were', 'quite', 'high', 'film', 'adaptation', 'ofHarry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Book', '5', 'especially', 'given', 'previous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'extraordinarily', 'high', 'quality', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'How', 'did', 'measure', 'up', 'Read', 'Adaptation', 'Adapting', 'nearly', '900', 'page', 'novel', 'film', 'be', 'daunting', 'task', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'novel', 'fit', 'cleanly', '2+', 'hour', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'omissions', 'will', 'doubt', 'infuriate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fanatics', 'main', 'events', 'are', 'there', ""'ve"", 'been', 'modified', 'somewhat', 'cover', 'elements', 'are', 'missing', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'changed', 'significantly', 'film', 'adaptation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'noticeable', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'rest', 'bit', 'Reader', 'Digest', 'version', 'Order', 'Phoenix.Acting', 'acting', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'always', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'surer', 'time', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'prominent', 'role', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'give', 'admirable', 'performances', 'regulars', 'are', 'great', ""'re"", 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'pair', 'newcomers', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'delightfully', 'devilish', 'Professor', 'Umbridge', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'completely', 'charming', 'Luna', 'Lovegood.Direction', 'David', 'great', 'job', 'initial', 'foray', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fast', 'pace', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'something', 'constantly', 'moving', 'forward', 'confrontation', 'know', 'coming', 'keeping', 'book', 'previous', 'films', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'impression', 'things', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'here.Everything', 'Else', 'were', 'lot', 'highlights', 'movie', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'scenes', 'were', 'fantastic', 'were', 'flights', 'London', 'Thestrals', 'are', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'creatures', 'used', 'films', 'chemistry', 'Harry', 'Luna', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'swear', 'were', 'setting', 'up', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'two', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'said', 'much', 'sideline', 'glances', 'particularly', 'towards', 'Harry', 'Cho', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'course', 'final', 'battle', 'Ministry', 'Magic', ""'ve"", 'visualized', 'head', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'completely', 'satisfy', 'sure', 'came', 'close', 'constant', 'smoky', 'apparations', 'were', 'bit', 'distracting', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'one-on-one', 'attention', 'Death', 'Eater/Dumbledore', 'Army/Order', 'Phoenix', 'battles', 'whole', 'thought', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'recent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'lightsaber', 'battle', 'particularly', 'showdown', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'was', 'one', 'seriously', 'intense', 'encounter', 'DVD', 'Extras', '2-disc', 'version', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'up', 'typical', 'array', 'unused', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'footage', 'etc', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'terms', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'say', '2', 'hours', 'so', 'guess', 'was', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'most', 'promising', 'extra', 'feature', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'frustrating', 'flyer', 'box', 'free', 'digital', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'store', 'computer', 'portable', 'device', 'small', 'print', 'inform', 'have', 'Mac', 'iPod', 'feature', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'What', 'way', 'take', 'great', 'bonus', 'feature', 'exclude', 'nearly', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'benefit', 'frustration', 'aside', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'seemed', 'bit', 'rushed', 'times', 'serious', 'disciples', 'novels', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'distracted', 'noting', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'whole', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'DVD', 'library']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Like the text the franchise is progressively darker, set in an almost post-911 world, following the disturbing events of the Goblet of Fire. Everything's changed... But not the superb casting with more Oscar Winners than you can shake a wand at, Oldman delivers again as Harry's Godfather Sirius Black aka Padfoot (the nickname is actually referenced in this one). Of course, this one has a climatic full scale battle of wands (the largest yet ) and Michael Gambon successfully dispenses Dumbledore's final duel with the Dark Lord a.k.a Tom. If you have the chance to see this in IMAX, by all means do so, oh yes!The story...Before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can even start their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is attacked by Dementors, then placed on trail for underage magic  in front of a muggle. He isn't the only one under fire from a Minstry of Magic in denial, so is Hogwarts itself, when loathsome Dolores Umbridge, new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, played by Oscar winning actress Imelda Staunton, appears to oppress the place.  Failing to be taught actual defensive magic Harry and crew form a secret class of their own, but the newly revived Voldemort, again played by Ralph Fiennes, along with a face-full of Death Eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter (who I had in mind when I first read the book) and Lucius Malfoy (still Jason Isaacs), are plotting something nasty.Harry's rage and isolation is effectively portrayed, as is his edited relationship with Cho. Some of the novel's best lines remain intact here, like Ron and Hermione's assessment of Harry's kissing. Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts isn't altered enough to lose it's punch, neither is the film's exploration of teen rebellion and the consequences of becoming adults. Some of the films real heart comes from not only the brief moments between Harry and his godfather (Sirius gives volumes of exposition when refers to Harry as James during the climax), but moments between Harry and quirky Luna Lovegood, as they reflect on life, death and nargles.The effects are brilliant even though the CGI centaurs return, but thankfully do not speak or leave the shadows (see Sorcerer's Stone, yikes!), the other magical creatures look good, house-elves and horses alike.

I know they went to the Ministry, and that's about it!  I wish I had seen it the regular way without the 3-D glasses, then I might have been able to understand it better.  We take along Mark, an expert at Harry Potter, every time we go to one of these shows, and we are the irritating ones in the row ahead of yours who are always turning to the expert and asking, ""Now who is that tall girl with the red hair?  Was she in the movie before?""The plot is so complicated now that ordinary notions of character development must have been the first thing the screenwriters chucked out.  We know Harry is angry, angry, angry all the time, for not only is he in a funk through most of the movie but he even has a scene where he says, ""I'm angry, angry all the time!""  Everyone's trying to help, but Harry just can't see that.  He's still traumatized, I think, by witnessing the death of Cedric Diggory in the previous movie.  Pity in a way Cedric didn't stick around for book 5, isn't it, because he might have raised the beauty quotient a little.  The producers must be fairly sick the way that they bet on a whole crew of child actors and now they have to watch them turn into awkward, plain galoofs of teens, barring Emma Watson, Dan Radcliffe and one or two others (like that tall girl with the red hair).  If Emma Watson loses one more ounce however, she is going to be able to squeeze through the eye of a needle no matter how much money she has.  Rupert Grint?

651325,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPI2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","No one who has stated that this film feels like a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the wonderful J.K. Rowling novel, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is wrong.  They are 100% correct.  With that said, however, I must admit that I still enjoyed this film.  For fans of the books (like myself), this film could be very brutal at times, eliminating the bulk of the tale in order to swiftly move to the primary story.  In essence, this film paid lipservice to most of the parts of the book that didn't deal directly with Harry.As a film, this movie is enjoyable.  It moves at a very swift pace and never gets too boring.  The action scenes are well done and the acting is, as a whole, very good.  The music was also very good, although it isn't too hard to emote ""dark and gloomy"" when it's all over a film.  The special effects were, as expected, brilliant.  It was nice to see the Dursleys back on the screen, no matter how brief their moment was.It's nowhere near five-star quality, but it does progress the film series along fairly well.  I have a few gripes that I believe need to be addressed.  Firstly, the film seems to be lacking heart, which was central to all of the previous films.  As highly developed as these characters were through the other movies, this one seemed to detach the viewer from the players on the screen.  Another problem is that key moments that were included were often treated lightly or in a careless fashion.  There are also a few editing choices that give the film a disjointed feel.  My biggest gripe was the treatment of some of the new characters like Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and Bellatrix Lestrange.  These are three of the most imaginative characters that Rowling put on paper and of them only Luna gets decent screentime.  Tonks, played by the lovely Natalia Tena, pops up, says a few lines, winks at Harry, and then makes a few funny faces before being brushed by the wayside.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfectly cast as the wicked Bellatrix, but she snarls at the camera, does the ""deed"" she's expected to do in the film, and the sings her way off into the sunset.  I completely understand that the director and screenwriter were trying to compound a very big book into a reasonable running time, but I felt as if they just tossed a coin to decide what stayed and what had to go.Could the movie have been better, yes, but it's still not as bad as a lot of films out there.  Like I stated before, a lot of the story was cut from the book to give this film a reasonable time limit.  I just feel as if the parts that were excluded were done so rather carelessly.  Compared to the other Potter films, it's a three star movie.  Compared to other fantasy flicks that have come out lately, it's three-and-a-half stars.If you're a Potter fan, buy it and enjoy it for what it does have in it.

My favorite of the Harry Potter movies so far is the Prisoner of Azkaban and this one. I know this is where alot of parents and younger audiences think the movies get worse and worse. I disagree. I do think they are leaving too much out of the movies but that is mostly credited to the changing of the directors and writers of the movies, the movies themselves still have incredible effects, storyline and acting. Alot of parents also don't like how the ratings in the movies are now PG-13 and are darker, people need to crack open those Harry Potter books again, these books are dark and I was happy to have movies 3-5 show what the books convey.

Sozaeva ""Obsessive bibliophile""","[5, 6]","While a good bit of the story does get whittled out in order to pare the story down enough to fit to movie length, the screen-play writer and director have managed to maintain overall the integrity of the story.After witnessing Cedric Diggory's murder by Voldemort, and just barely escaping himself, Harry is understandably a bit traumatized.  When he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors, Harry has to use a Patronus charm.  This leads to receipt of a letter announcing that he has been expelled from Hogwart's.  Understandably upset, Harry is surprised that night to receive a visit from several old friends, including Mad-Eye Moody and Tonks, who have come to ""rescue"" him from the ""loving"" arms of his relatives, and take him to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, where Harry learns that the reason he hasn't heard from anyone all summer is because they have been trying to protect him from learning about how the Ministry of Magic and the magical press are attacking him, and claiming that Harry is wrong, Voldemort is not back, and all of this is just a ploy by Dumbledore to take over the Ministry.  After a trial that was an obvious set-up for Harry to lose - which was thwarted by the timely arrival of both Dumbledore and Mrs. Figg, a squibb who lives near Harry's relatives - Harry finally gets back to Hogwarts, only to find many of his former friends are regarding him with suspicion, if not outright disdain.Enter Dolores Umbridge - with her pink clothing, pink office furniture, pink china - I mean, sweet Goddess, even her SUGAR that she stirs into her pink tea is PINK!  While I was a bit disappointed that they chose to hire someone to play Umbridge who was much more attractive than she is described in the book, nonetheless this actress did a fabulous job of playing the ""smiling while I stab you"" evil vileness of Umbridge.  I especially loved the scene where she had practically everyone in detention, all writing with her ""special"" quills, while she sat upon a golden, throne-like chair, a smile of intense satisfaction upon her face.  It was beautiful.For those who want some wizarding, you won't be disappointed.  Dumbledore's Army provides a lot of wizarding action, as the students, under Harry's tutelage, learn to defend themselves with practical spells.  Also, in the final climactic scenes - especially the ones with Voldemore and Dumbledore - there are some truly wonderful special effects.  Also some very good acting from (at least my) favorite evil Death eater Bellatrix played by Helena Bonham Carter.  She does the joyfully evil persona perfectly.Let's not forget Grawp!  A lovely CGI brother for Hagrid, who sadly we don't get to see much of in this movie.  The Centaurs make a very brief appearance, and we only see them in fast action, so it is difficult to make much of a comment on their appearance, as I couldn't see them very well.Overall, I loved it.  It advanced the story nicely, it kept to the overall flavour of the series as well as the story of the book, and the acting was superb.

651336,A39HI3CKVEXV1I,B00005JPI2,KTFaye,"[6, 6]","Saw it in the theatre and now again on DVD and all in all, it's my least favorite of the Harry Potter films.  Steve Kloves did as good a job as anyone could of taking the densely plotted books and paring them down to filmable length.  Unfortunately, he didn't do the adaptation for this film.  However, whatever good work his successor may have turned out turned out was negated by some of the most ham-fisted editing choices I've ever seen on a film.  In fairness, this was a tough, tough book to adapt, but while I'm sure the effort was made, in the end, it's just not as good as the other adaptations.For example, viewers shouldn't notice editing; it shouldn't be so obvious that scenes and dialog have been severely cut for time.  But you notice ALL these things here.  Scenes just end abruptly, scenes clearly have huge chunks of dialog cut for time, the climactic battle sequence was a hatchet job with gaps big enough to throw a cat through.  Some of the cuts made no sense at all.  Honestly, in some parts it feels like the old days in school where the film would break and just be spliced back together. Yes, all films are cut for time, but not usually in such a heavy-handed manner.  It is possible to do it well.  For example, the shorter versions of Lord of the Rings are still coherent, they flow, they're not jarring.  OOTP just feels like the film was edited by a food processor.I'm concerned that the next film also features the same director/editor combination.  Granted, I understand that Steve Kloves has returned, but I'm not sure that he can overcome what  David Yates can do to it.On the upside, the acting is first class, Especially Daniel Radcliff whose timing has just gotten better and better as he's gotten older.  The visuals are amazing, and of course the general story can still be gleaned, if you've read the book.  Otherwise, it might be confusing to those who only see the films.  All in all, the cast really turn in a good show, that was brought to its knees by bad editing and direction choices.  It makes you wonder what the same performances in the hands of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, Mike Newell would have been like.As others have mentioned,  the extras are not worth the extra money.  You got deleted scenes that just roll one right after the other with not intro or reason as to why they were deleted.  There's a mildly interesting behind the scenes tour lead by the actress who plays Tonks who apparently thinks she's in a episode of romper room.  But there's nothing really behind the scenes to see unless you think the food commissary is all that interesting.There's a story so far extra that features talking heads all of whom wrote books speculating on the real meaning of harry potter.  Of course now that we all KNOW the meaning of Harry Potter, so the entire extra is rendered pretty moot.  It can't be that they were unaware that the 7th book came out this summer can it??  What was the point?Oh, and amusingly, they devote on entire extra to the ""magic"" of editing - ironically presented by David Yates and his editor, both of whom are responsible for one of the worst editing jobs ever put to film.  you do get to edit your own scene, which is a bit entertaining and I'm sure your average 8 year old is better than Yates.  It would be my recommendation to skip the extras and buy the single disk.",3,"Good Acting, Poor Direction, Terrible Editing",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3344,"['Saw', 'theatre', 'now', 'again', 'DVD', 'least', 'favorite', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'Steve', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'anyone', 'could', 'taking', 'densely', 'plotted', 'books', 'paring', 'down', 'filmable', 'length', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'adaptation', 'film', 'However', 'whatever', 'good', 'work', 'successor', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'negated', 'most', 'ham-fisted', 'editing', 'choices', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'fairness', 'was', 'tough', 'tough', 'book', 'adapt', ""'m"", 'sure', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'end', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'adaptations.For', 'example', 'viewers', 'should', ""n't"", 'notice', 'editing', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'cut', 'time', 'notice', 'things', 'here', 'Scenes', 'just', 'end', 'abruptly', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'have', 'huge', 'chunks', 'dialog', 'cut', 'time', 'climactic', 'battle', 'sequence', 'was', 'hatchet', 'job', 'gaps', 'big', 'enough', 'throw', 'cat', 'cuts', 'made', 'sense', 'Honestly', 'parts', 'old', 'days', 'school', 'where', 'film', 'would', 'break', 'just', 'be', 'spliced', 'back', 'together', 'Yes', 'films', 'are', 'cut', 'time', 'not', 'usually', 'such', 'heavy-handed', 'manner', 'possible', 'do', 'well', 'example', 'shorter', 'versions', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'still', 'coherent', 'flow', ""'re"", 'not', 'jarring', 'OOTP', 'just', 'feels', 'film', 'was', 'edited', 'food', 'processor.I', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'next', 'film', 'also', 'same', 'director/editor', 'combination', 'Granted', 'understand', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'returned', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'overcome', 'what', 'David', 'can', 'do', 'it.On', 'upside', 'acting', 'first', 'class', 'Especially', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'timing', 'just', 'gotten', 'better', 'better', 'gotten', 'older', 'visuals', 'are', 'amazing', 'course', 'general', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'gleaned', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'films', 'cast', 'really', 'turn', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'brought', 'knees', 'bad', 'editing', 'direction', 'choices', 'wonder', 'what', 'same', 'performances', 'hands', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'like.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'extra', 'money', 'got', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'just', 'roll', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'not', 'intro', 'reason', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'tour', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'Tonks', 'who', 'apparently', 'episode', 'romper', 'room', 'nothing', 'really', 'scenes', 'see', 'think', 'food', 'commissary', 'story', 'so', 'far', 'extra', 'talking', 'heads', 'whom', 'wrote', 'books', 'speculating', 'real', 'meaning', 'harry', 'potter', 'course', 'now', 'KNOW', 'meaning', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'entire', 'extra', 'rendered', 'pretty', 'moot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'were', 'unaware', '7th', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'summer', 'can', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'Oh', 'amusingly', 'devote', 'entire', 'extra', 'magic', 'editing', 'ironically', 'presented', 'David', 'Yates', 'editor', 'whom', 'are', 'responsible', 'one', 'worst', 'editing', 'jobs', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'do', 'get', 'edit', 'own', 'scene', 'bit', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'sure', 'average', '8', 'year', 'old', 'better', 'Yates', 'would', 'be', 'recommendation', 'skip', 'extras', 'buy', 'single', 'disk']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

To Harry's frustration, Dumbledore doesn't help alleviate those doubts and suspicion because he keeps evading Harry.  To keep a tight rein on Hogswarts, the Ministry has sent Delores Umbridge, the Senior Undersecretary, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  However, she soon appoints herself as the High Inquisitor when she perceives things at Hogswarts as out of control and unnecessary.  Meanwhile, Voldemort and his army are getting stronger.Like other reviewers, I was surprised to learn that the largest book of the Harry Potter series has been reduced to the shortest movie of the series.  Both the Harry Potter books and movies are formulaic.  However, in this movie, some were deleted (like the quidditch game) and some were ""fast-forwarded"" (like the Christmas break from school & Kreacher).  Naturally, I was a bit disappointed.  However, I still enjoyed the movie very much even though I thought there was more dialogue than action.However, I just have 3 issues.  First, I enjoyed Umbridge in the book.  Her ""hem, hem"" has caused my friends and I to say that to each other, especially on AIM.  So, I was expecting that line to be the thing of this movie.  Instead, it was just replaced with some regular unoriginal coughs.  Other than that, Umbridge was just freakingly good.  Second, Gwarp looks more like the Jolly Green Giant than anything else.  Third, as the title says 'the order of the phoenix', there was hardly much on the order.Nonetheless, I liked it even though others felt it was so-so.  I do have to agree that there less action than the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I'm already surprised that there is a movie poster for the 6th installment.

Bernabo,"[285, 332]","I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favorite scenes on the screen.  For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king"").  So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life.  The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him.  As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors.  Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle.  The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge,  Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.  However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practice because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from.  Then things get progressively worse.""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge.  As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means.  She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical.  If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her.  Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films.  Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy.  Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish.  We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not.  Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of thebookand starting cataloguing things that had been cut.  Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book.  At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor.  The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in thefinal book, which gets released in just ten more days.  I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts.  My favorite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.  Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more.  Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison.  Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book.",4,The longest Harry Potter book gets whittled down to the shortest Harry Potter film,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,4819,"['think', 'when', 'take', 'longest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'turn', 'shortest', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'large', 'number', 'complaints', 'fans', 'what', 'been', 'cut', 'will', 'be', 'inevitable', 'watch', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Not', 'legions', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'version', 'rather', 'will', 'be', 'regrets', 'not', 'getting', 'see', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'screen', 'example', 'Quidditch', 'completely', 'film', 'denying', 'Ron', 'best', 'moments', 'sun', 'start', 'singing', 'Weasley', 'king', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'mind', 'shifting', 'what', 'been', 'cut', 'distracting', 'time', 'time', 'watching', 'summer', 'latest', 'blockbuster.When', 'last', 'left', 'hero', 'Harry', 'fell', 'victim', 'trap', 'bring', 'back', 'Lord', 'Voldermort', 'cost', 'Cedric', 'Diggory', 'life', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'things', 'hushed', 'up', 'Dumbledore', 'students', 'Hogwarts', 'Diggory', 'was', 'murdered', 'Lord', 'Voldermort', 'murdered', 'fifth', 'film', 'Harry', 'wicked', 'cousin', 'Dudley', 'are', 'attacked', 'Dementors', 'Harry', 'wand', 'defend', 'summarily', 'expelled', 'Hogwarts', 'using', 'magic', 'front', 'muggle', 'good', 'news', 'Harry', 'reinstated', 'bad', 'news', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'opportunity', 'appoint', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Senior', 'Undersecretary', 'Ministry', 'school', 'new', 'Defense', 'Against', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'professor', 'However', 'Umbridge', 'only', 'theory', 'not', 'practice', 'Harry', 'liar', 'nothing', 'students', 'need', 'learn', 'defend', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'progressively', 'worse', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'most', 'maddening', 'book', 'read', 'not', 'was', 'longest', 'detest', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Voldermort', 'look', 'good', 'evil', 'wicked', 'bad', 'mean', 'nasty', 'inside', 'Umbridge', 'ends', 'justify', 'means', 'puritanical', 'sadistic', 'hypocritical', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'children', 'reading', 'review', 'would', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'Suffice', 'say', 'sick', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'take', 'pleasure', 'loving', 'hate', 'why', 'only', 'requirement', 'going', 'film', 'Weasley', 'Twins', 'get', 'moment', 'glory', 'when', 'become', 'disloyal', 'opposition', 'new', 'order', 'Hogwarts.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'have', 'tote', 'heavy', 'load', 'films', 'Harry', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'being', 'reduced', 'more', 'more', 'often', 'reaction', 'shots', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Mistress', 'Exposition', 'films', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'also', 'joy', 'watch', 'discovered', 'film', 'really', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'performance', 'Dumbledore', 'mainly', 'always', 'up', 'character', 'intelligence', 'find', 'prefer', 'interpretation', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'forgive', 'heresy', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'much', 'toad', 'Umbridge', 'book', 'character', 'detestability', 'start', 'finish', 'are', 'always', 'painfully', 'aware', 'how', 'dangerous', 'not', 'Also', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'more', 'scenes', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Katie', 'Leung', 'Cho', 'Chang', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'see', 'Neville', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'towering', 'everybody', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'silent', 'strong', 'role', 'pivotal', 'sextet.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'raced', 'home', 'got', 'out', 'copy', 'thebookand', 'starting', 'cataloguing', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'Such', 'comparisons', 'are', 'suggested', 'up', 'top', 'inevitable', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'point', 'what', 'missed', 'most', 'were', 'conversations', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'Umbridge', 'where', 'Minerva', 'verbally', 'Inquisitor', 'omission', 'am', 'focusing', 'most', 'whole', 'bit', 'why', 'Neville', 'family', 'was', 'target', 'Voldermort', 'agree', 'Harry', 'always', 'say', 'name', 'thereby', 'reduce', 'power', 'implications', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'thefinal', 'book', 'released', 'just', 'ten', 'more', 'days', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'reaction', 'Harry', 'discovering', 'father', 'bullied', 'Snape', 'Hogwarts', 'favorite', 'part', 'up', 'being', 'impressive', 'wizard', 'duel', 'Voldermort', 'Dumbledore', 'Screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Goldenberg', 'good', 'job', 'whittling', 'down', 'Rowling', 'book', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'competent', 'job', 'fans', 'will', 'simply', 'want', 'more', 'Also', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'book', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'seem', 'inconsequential', 'comparison', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'distracted', 'mining', 'film', 'clues', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'last', 'book']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651343,A383PPSVXNB0NB,B00005JPI2,Leigh Fitzpatrick,"[4, 6]","Sometimes you have wonderful movie experiences when you least expect them and that happened last night.  HP:OOTP, the movie, blew me away with its complexity and brilliant acting delivered in a tight, fast moving pace.  What a journey from the Christmas-y first movie (which I enjoyed).  It captured exactly the themes that Rowling laid out in the 5th book.  It is the best Harry Potter movie (with Prisoner of Azkaban a close second).And yes, I liked it better than the book.  My problem with book five was not so much with the length but with the editing and feeling like I'd read a lot of it before. I went back to the first book and it was tightly written and fun. The Order of the Phoenix was rough and bloated; it felt about two drafts away from being complete (Rowling hinted that was the case: she said she eventually ran out of time and energy at the end.).Whereas the book had a signifcant deja vu aspect (The Dursley's are still despicable, the Slytherins continue to snicker and make fun of the gang with Rowling continuing to use the same descriptors-how many times can Pansy Parkinson shriek before she loses her vocal chords?-- and Snape still unfair.  It also seems to have set certain rules in stone that I thought were open questions such as: Are all Slytherin's evil? That wasn't the original premise.) the movie felt fresh and advanced the story in ways that surpassed the book.What makes the movie so good is that it manages to put in play very quickly important themes such as the overall tension (using the heat wave and washed out colors), Harry's co-mingled anger and sadness, romance, the rocky state of Harry's friendship with Hermione and Ron which they overcome by film's end, the twisted psychological state of Dolores Umbridge (a true sadist), the fear and denial of the wizarding world (via swooping, swirling visions of newspaper headlines), and the growing bond between Harry and Sirius.  It's a credit to the director, the cinematographer and most especially the actors that they can convey these thoughts, emotions and themes so quickly.But what ultimately tipped this movie into the area of greatness is how it fearlessly explored the themes of good and evil so honestly--astonishing for a movie based on a children's book.  The scene between Sirius and Harry where Harry confesses the troubling evil tendencies and anger in himself and Sirius' response made me really feel for Harry instead of being irritated at him as I was reading the book.  And Harry's final triumph where he kicks Voldemort out of his mind by flashing on scenes of love and friendship--and even finds it in himself to express pity for his mortal enemy--well, I'll admit it brought a tear to my eye---it was that powerful.",5,Best of the HP movies.....and better than the book,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,2731,"['Sometimes', 'have', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'experiences', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'happened', 'last', 'night', 'HP', 'OOTP', 'movie', 'blew', 'away', 'complexity', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'delivered', 'tight', 'fast', 'moving', 'pace', 'What', 'journey', 'Christmas-y', 'first', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'captured', 'exactly', 'themes', 'Rowling', 'laid', 'out', '5th', 'book', 'best', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'close', 'second', '.And', 'yes', 'liked', 'better', 'book', 'problem', 'book', 'five', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'length', 'editing', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'read', 'lot', 'went', 'back', 'first', 'book', 'was', 'tightly', 'written', 'fun', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'rough', 'bloated', 'felt', 'two', 'drafts', 'away', 'being', 'complete', 'Rowling', 'hinted', 'was', 'case', 'said', 'eventually', 'ran', 'time', 'energy', 'end', '.Whereas', 'book', 'had', 'signifcant', 'deja', 'vu', 'aspect', 'Dursley', 'are', 'still', 'despicable', 'Slytherins', 'continue', 'snicker', 'make', 'fun', 'gang', 'Rowling', 'continuing', 'use', 'same', 'descriptors-how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'Pansy', 'Parkinson', 'shriek', 'vocal', 'chords', 'Snape', 'still', 'also', 'have', 'set', 'certain', 'rules', 'stone', 'thought', 'were', 'open', 'questions', 'such', 'Are', 'Slytherin', 'evil', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'premise', 'movie', 'felt', 'fresh', 'advanced', 'story', 'ways', 'surpassed', 'book.What', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'put', 'play', 'very', 'quickly', 'important', 'themes', 'such', 'overall', 'tension', 'using', 'heat', 'wave', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'Harry', 'co-mingled', 'anger', 'sadness', 'romance', 'rocky', 'state', 'Harry', 'friendship', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'overcome', 'film', 'end', 'twisted', 'psychological', 'state', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'true', 'sadist', 'fear', 'denial', 'wizarding', 'world', 'swooping', 'swirling', 'visions', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'growing', 'bond', 'Harry', 'Sirius', 'credit', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'most', 'especially', 'actors', 'can', 'convey', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'themes', 'so', 'quickly.But', 'what', 'ultimately', 'tipped', 'movie', 'area', 'greatness', 'how', 'fearlessly', 'explored', 'themes', 'good', 'so', 'honestly', 'astonishing', 'movie', 'based', 'children', 'book', 'scene', 'Sirius', 'Harry', 'where', 'Harry', 'troubling', 'evil', 'tendencies', 'anger', 'Sirius', 'response', 'made', 'really', 'feel', 'Harry', 'instead', 'being', 'irritated', 'was', 'reading', 'book', 'Harry', 'final', 'triumph', 'where', 'Voldemort', 'mind', 'flashing', 'scenes', 'love', 'friendship', 'even', 'express', 'pity', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'well', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', '-it', 'was', 'powerful']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651344,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B00005JPI2,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","As other reviewers have noted, by necessity a lot of book 5 is left out of this movie, in order to keep the length manageable, but I think that is OK. Just watch it as a movie in a movie series, not as a play-by-play of the book, and you will be able to appreciate it. The focus is on the most essential aspects of the story - the growing threat of Voldemort, the denial of the ministry and media to accept this, including their smearing of Potter and Dumbledore, the evolution of the Order of the Phoenix, the growing authoritarian repression at Hogwarts under Professor Umbridge, and Harry's struggles with Voldemort's increasing presence in his mind. That's  A LOT to cover, and the movie does it well.This is a dark movie - the death of Cedric at the end of book and movie 4 marks the turning point in this series. From this point forward it is an out-and-out battle between good and evil, and the darker mood - and look - of this film reflects that. There is a lot of tension, and a lot of repressed (and expressed) anger, in the form of Umbridge, and, of course, Harry. Everyone is struggling to come to terms with what is happening, and many are denying it. Harry's status as an outsider is cemented, and yet, he rediscovers the importance of love and friendship in the form of Dumbledore's Army. This is a lot of psychoological complexity, coupled with adolescent angst, and everyone manages to pull it off.The final climactic scene, in which Dumbledore helps Harry 'expel' Voldemort from his mind, is critical to understanding the themes of this entire series, and I think it is done justice here. That in and of itself is enough to make me love this movie. So my advice is to forgive what is not covered, and assess it according to what is really most important to the series - if everything had been put in, some of the subtler scenes that drive the psychological drama would have been more rushed. Choices were made, and it's all to the good in my view.",5,"Alot is Left Out, But the Essentials Are Handled Beautifully",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1965,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'necessity', 'lot', 'book', '5', 'left', 'movie', 'order', 'keep', 'length', 'manageable', 'think', 'OK.', 'Just', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'series', 'not', 'play-by-play', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'focus', 'most', 'essential', 'aspects', 'story', 'growing', 'threat', 'Voldemort', 'denial', 'ministry', 'media', 'accept', 'including', 'smearing', 'Potter', 'Dumbledore', 'evolution', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'growing', 'authoritarian', 'repression', 'Hogwarts', 'Professor', 'Umbridge', 'Harry', 'struggles', 'Voldemort', 'increasing', 'presence', 'mind', 'LOT', 'cover', 'movie', 'well.This', 'dark', 'movie', 'death', 'Cedric', 'end', 'book', 'movie', '4', 'marks', 'turning', 'point', 'series', 'point', 'forward', 'out-and-out', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'darker', 'mood', 'look', 'film', 'lot', 'tension', 'lot', 'repressed', 'expressed', 'anger', 'form', 'Umbridge', 'course', 'Harry', 'Everyone', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'happening', 'many', 'are', 'denying', 'Harry', 'status', 'outsider', 'cemented', 'yet', 'importance', 'love', 'friendship', 'form', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'lot', 'psychoological', 'complexity', 'coupled', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'everyone', 'manages', 'pull', 'off.The', 'final', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', ""'expel"", 'Voldemort', 'mind', 'critical', 'understanding', 'themes', 'entire', 'series', 'think', 'done', 'justice', 'here', 'enough', 'make', 'love', 'movie', 'advice', 'forgive', 'what', 'not', 'covered', 'assess', 'according', 'what', 'really', 'most', 'important', 'series', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'subtler', 'scenes', 'drive', 'psychological', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'rushed', 'Choices', 'were', 'made', 'good', 'view']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended. Cut.These are the words that sold me in the beginning. The promise of seeing extended cuts of the HP films was enough for me (and many, MANY other fans) to double dip and get the Ultimate SS and CoS Blu-rays. And you know what? There were worth it. Not because of the endless array of worthless swag packed into over-size boxes. I mean, seriously... Anybody out there framing their lenticular cards and hanging them over their mantles? I didn't think so. But I digress...What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.Then PoA and GoF Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for OotP and HBP. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want: An official ultimate collector's replica of a square of Hogwart's Toilet Paper.Oh, I meant AN EXTENDED CUT.Now, I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want?

651359,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JPI2,magellan,"[0, 1]","Since there are already over 600 reviews of this movie I'll just keep my comments brief and touch on a few points that I wanted to discuss.I enjoyed this movie overall but I have to say that it's the weakest and most problematic of all the Harry Potter movies, although it's not without some great high points, too. I note that many of the fans were disappointed in how much was cut from the original book, making the story arc somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. But then this was the longest, if I remember right, of all the Harry Potter novels and you just can't cram everything in even a modest sized book, let alone one this long, into a movie. But many characters who featured prominently in the book get very little screen time in this adaptation.But the movie does have its good points. The best thing is how you get to see the young wizards growing in their magic skills as they learn to do magical tricks like discharge energy, repulse an attacker by knocking him back through the air, perform stunts similar to psychokinesis by manipulating objects from afar, and so on. This aspect of the movie is the most fun.The problem is that there's a new, evil senior professor by the name of Ms. Umbridge who is almost bad enough to bring the whole movie screeching to a halt every time she appears. She will only teach the young magicians the theory, not the actual practical techniques of magic. This puts the students in a bind, because they still need to protect themselves from evil magicians like Voldemor and also pass their exams. There's also no explanation in the movie for this inexplicable policy of Umbridge's except she's a very bad person. But the young people show some grit and determination in their desire to learn no matter who or what gets in their way by forming an outside study group, which meets in secret to learn what they can on their own.But Umbridge is such a low, despicable character that the whole move suffers as a result. Not the least of these problems is that she runs around with a rigid, unchanging rictus of an expression on her face that's sort of like smug, arrogant complacency combined with a somewhat pinched, pained grimace as if she has terminal hemorrhoids. It's too extreme an affectation and caricature and makes every scene with this character hard to watch. I don't think I've ever had a more negative reaction to a character in a movie, and I usually don't even have much of a reaction to characters in movies. But her whole persona is an embarrassingly bad idea and low point for what was already a problematic Harry Potter movie. The only good thing you can say about the Umbridge character  is at least the name was a clever idea because of the allusion to the word, ""umbrage."" Well, I guess I take umbrage with Ms. Umbridge.Although there are some fun and enjoyable parts to the movie, and I still enjoyed it for the most part, again, the movie suffers from some bad characterization, a patchy and difficult to follow plot, and the loss of some important story elements from the book. It seems now that the Harry Potter kids are almost grown-up teenagers the Hogwarts Academy has lost its warts and gotten a bad case of acne. I still enjoyed the movie for the most part but in comparison with the other great movies in this series I can only give this one three stars at most.",3,A brief comment,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,3340,"['are', 'already', '600', 'reviews', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'keep', 'comments', 'brief', 'touch', 'few', 'points', 'wanted', 'discuss.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'overall', 'have', 'say', 'weakest', 'most', 'problematic', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'not', 'great', 'high', 'points', 'too', 'note', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'disappointed', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'cut', 'original', 'book', 'making', 'story', 'arc', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'hard', 'follow', 'then', 'was', 'longest', 'remember', 'right', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'novels', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cram', 'everything', 'even', 'modest', 'sized', 'book', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'many', 'characters', 'who', 'featured', 'prominently', 'book', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'best', 'thing', 'how', 'get', 'see', 'young', 'wizards', 'growing', 'magic', 'skills', 'learn', 'do', 'magical', 'tricks', 'discharge', 'energy', 'repulse', 'attacker', 'knocking', 'back', 'air', 'perform', 'stunts', 'similar', 'psychokinesis', 'manipulating', 'objects', 'afar', 'so', 'aspect', 'movie', 'most', 'fun.The', 'problem', 'new', 'evil', 'senior', 'professor', 'name', 'Ms.', 'Umbridge', 'who', 'almost', 'bad', 'enough', 'bring', 'whole', 'movie', 'screeching', 'halt', 'time', 'will', 'only', 'teach', 'young', 'theory', 'not', 'actual', 'practical', 'techniques', 'magic', 'students', 'bind', 'still', 'need', 'protect', 'evil', 'magicians', 'Voldemor', 'also', 'pass', 'exams', 'also', 'explanation', 'movie', 'inexplicable', 'policy', 'Umbridge', 'very', 'bad', 'person', 'young', 'people', 'show', 'grit', 'determination', 'desire', 'learn', 'matter', 'who', 'what', 'way', 'forming', 'outside', 'study', 'group', 'secret', 'learn', 'what', 'can', 'own.But', 'Umbridge', 'such', 'low', 'despicable', 'character', 'whole', 'move', 'suffers', 'result', 'Not', 'least', 'problems', 'rigid', 'unchanging', 'rictus', 'expression', 'face', 'sort', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'complacency', 'combined', 'somewhat', 'pinched', 'pained', 'grimace', 'terminal', 'hemorrhoids', 'too', 'extreme', 'affectation', 'caricature', 'scene', 'character', 'hard', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'more', 'negative', 'reaction', 'character', 'movie', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'much', 'reaction', 'characters', 'movies', 'whole', 'persona', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'idea', 'low', 'point', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'problematic', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Umbridge', 'character', 'least', 'name', 'was', 'clever', 'idea', 'allusion', 'word', 'umbrage', 'Well', 'guess', 'take', 'umbrage', 'Ms.', 'Umbridge.Although', 'are', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'parts', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'again', 'movie', 'suffers', 'bad', 'characterization', 'patchy', 'difficult', 'follow', 'plot', 'loss', 'important', 'story', 'elements', 'book', 'now', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'kids', 'are', 'almost', 'grown-up', 'teenagers', 'Hogwarts', 'Academy', 'lost', 'warts', 'gotten', 'bad', 'case', 'acne', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'comparison', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'most']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

I'm even starting to get used to the new guy as Dumbledore (although Richard Harris was amazing).  Harry, Ron, and Harmione are all back in full form for their fifth year.  The only problem that I can see with this movie is that it missed a lot of the really fun things about the 5th HP book.  Let me get one thing out before I move on... I loved the 5th book.  I know some people hated it mostly because of Umbridge, but I really enjoyed it.  So, moving on from there, there are some things that the book had but the movie really lacked.  For example; the scene in the book where Harry takes Dumbledore's Army into the Department of mysteries was so much more interesting in the book.  There was more effects, more magic, and a whole lot more to that scene in general.  One more example; they could have played up the Room of Requirement a bit.  Now I understand that this was the longest HP book, and I can't be angry at them for cutting some of the scenes to make the transfer to the silver screen.  I'm sure the movie would have been 6 hours long if they put in everything.  But you'd think that they might try to play out the most interesting scenes of the book (ie. the end before Harry Meets Voldemort and the training sequences) just a bit.

651363,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JPI2,Mark Baker,"[1, 2]","This movie marks the first time I've seen a Harry Potter film after reading the book.  As a result, I was curious how I'd like it.  I found the book long and repetitive, but I still couldn't see how they'd cut 850 pages down to a decent film.  While there were some cuts I didn't like, for the most part they pulled it off.Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back.  Or at least that's what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) claim.  But the Ministry of Magic is denying these claims and the ""Daily Prophet"" is backing them up.As if that weren't bad enough, the Ministry has appointed the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is going to teach the subject by textbook only.  There will be no practical part of the course.Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are kept out of much of what is happening in the fight against Voldemort.  They know that Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix to fight the dark lord again, but they aren't allowed to join.  Yet Voldemort seems to be trying to communicate something to Harry.  What does he want?  Is Harry in danger?One thing that helped this movie was the art of the montage.  They used that several times to cut out the repetition from the book.  They also cut out a couple sub-plots, one I really loved, and some of the funny scenes from the book.  It was disappointing, but I could see the need to make room for important things.Still with all those cuts, they also cut out most of the Order of the Phoenix scenes.  What is there is great, and fans of the character Tonks especially won't be disappointed with what they see during her too short screen time.  And the ending was rushed, taking away the emotional impact while still covering all the important details.The only change that really bothered me was one near the middle that changed a character.  I know they had to cut out some characters, but the resulting damage to this remaining charater one really bothered me.If all this talk concerns you because you haven't read the books, don't let it.  I saw it with a friend who hasn't read any of the books, and he followed everything perfectly.But enough of my picking apart the plot.  What about the rest of the film?

651375,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JPI2,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 0]","Personally, the films are never going to live up to expectations, no one would simply sit on their backsides for long enough to see Order Of The Phoenix put into a film, scene for scene. You'd be there all day. So yes there are a lot of reviews that are going to say that it's the weakest movie, cos it's the shortest movie, made from the longest book. And I'm shocked at myself that I'm actually going to say I agree.I recently re-watched the films, and re-read the last three books. Re-watching the films, I discovered that however I much I liked the second movie first time round, Dobby annoyed me every time, and I found myself pressing the skip button. To me, the second movie is the weakest. But now Order Of The Phoenix is following closely behind. But I still like it.Order of the Phoenix the book had simply had too much filler in, and although I enjoy reading it, I do find myself skipping bits, particularly when Dolores Umbridge opens her mouth. She was by the worst character, but not a bad character, just dreadful the way she's portrayed. I was shocked when it was announced that Imelda Staunton would be playing her, and I couldn't imagine how this would work. Until she burst onto screen wearing an array of pink. From the nurse in Shakespeare In Love, to this, certainly a defining career highlight.Lots of stuff has obviously been cut, from important plot points to unnecessary bits. I did find myself watching the movie, and thinking about what had been cut, cos it was really disjointed at times. Dobby was completely cut (thank God for that!), so instead of him telling Harry about the Room of Requirement, it's Neville who finds out. We have to put up with Kreacher, but he barely features. We completely lose Quidditch in this movie, not even a glimpse of Ron letting in a goal (is it still a goal?) The ending seems to be slightly changed, and it's Cho who this time who tells Dolores about the Room of Requirement, and not her best friend, as it was in the book. St Mungo's is all but virtually cut out as well, as are Hermione & Ron's new roles as prefects.I'm disappointed to say that Ron is virtually non-existent in this film, which is a pity, he seems to be shunted aside to introduce Luna Lovegood, and give her more of a role. It's not a good thing that Ron is basically hardly in the film at all. Other reviewers seem to be raving about his comedic timing, he's hardly there!!!The finale seems very tame compared to the book, and I wasn't impressed. I thought the scene where Remus Lupin was holding Harry back, was well done, as it was completely silent apart from a truly brilliant score behind it. And I've always loved the main Harry Potter 'theme' ever since the first film, but there was a whole new dimension added to it to this time, bringing a darker, more haunting theme.I have to say I was not keen on Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore in this film. Stepping into the late Richard Harris' shoes was very brave, but what Dumbledore does during this film is explained at the end, but I still didn't like Michael Gambon.There were some excellent casting decisions in this film - Helena Bonham Carter put in a surprising appearance as Bellatrix Lestrange, a witch-like but incredibly sexy woman, who's a cousin or something to Sirius, but has gone over to the bad side. She was just simply not on screen enough. Neither was the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks, or just Tonks if you will, part of the Order, who can change her hair, clothes, facial features with her flick of her wand. She was a brilliant character in the book, but is sadly underused in this. Apart from a glimpse at the start, and at the end. She was gorgeous too, and I loved how her hair changed when Mad Eye Moody called her Nymphadora! I'm not sure about Luna, played by Evanna Lynch. She was a great little character, but she was just too kooky, and she seemed to have a bit more interaction in the book.I can imagine there's a few people out there who will be very disappointed with Order Of The Phoenix, but personally, I'm counting down the days the next film!

651376,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,B00005JPI2,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[3, 3]","Like a good wine, the Harry Potter film series are something that grow better with age and the fifth adaptation of the book series does not fail to impress. As many have said before, Order of the Pheonix is by far the darkest (and shortest, go figure) film to date. It's hard to imagine the days of the light and frothy Sorceror's Stone, with its wonderous surprises, colorful displays, and an eleven year olds joy. Now, the series, likes the books, have aged into more mature subject matter, dealing with the likes of goverment conspiracies, war, death, and sinister villians. Now, i will say that this is not my favorite HP film (that honor still goes with Prisoner of Azkaban), but it is still a rather solid adaptation of the book as a whole.We join Harry after the events of Goblet of Fire, the beginning setting the tone for the entire film. Harry is angry, confused, and plain frustrated for everything that's happened the previous year. And to make matters worse, this year is no better. The Ministry has already begun a full out smear campaign on our young hero and the wise wizard Dumbledore, absolutly refusing to believe Voldemort is back, who is already assembling his army once more to strike the defensless wizadring community. And just when he thinks he can find solace with his friends Ron and Hermione and the school he loves so much, in walks Dolores Umbridge, a manic, power-hungry woman out to do the Ministry's bidding and restore supposed 'order' to Hogwarts school. On top of that, Harry must also deal with the frightning dreams he has begun to experince, that may very well be a clue to what Voldemort is planning next.All the performers bring there A game here. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, much like their characters, have matured with age and put to rest any doubts about there acting skills. Returning actors like Rickman, Gambon, Smith, Oldman, and Coltrane are all supurb, making the most of there sometimes small roles. But its truley the newcomer's who deserve the kudos. Evanna Lynch is absolutly brillinat as the spacey Luna Lovegood, while Helena Bonham Carter turns such a tiny role into a firecracker of a performance as the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. And finally, Imelda Staunton brings the best performance in the film as the diabolical Professor Umbridge. An absoulty horrid woman, disguised by a too sweet fascade that makes your skin crawl. Oh and she also does the laugh justice.As usual, HP fans will have a lot to complaign about with the substantial cuts from the book, especially the whole 'Weasley is our King', so for those who are extremly touchy over this, Order of the Pheonix will most likely dissapoint you. And to those who feel the film may be to dark, it does have some rather clever comidic parts. But for the others, people should be rather pleased with the evenly paced flow of the movie cause i have to say, though i loved Goblet of Fire, i felt it was very choppy at parts, seemingly jumping from one scene to the next in a frentic hurry, almost to try and fit in as much as possible into the time. So for me, i say the cuts were necesarry, cause this film hardly felt cluttered or rushed.So, in closing, to all those picky HP fans, this movie will not satisfy.

The significance of most of the characters was not exemplified and the only thing anyone could have gotten out of it was Voldemort was evil and tricked Harry into getting a glowing sphere. There were many things missing in which the movie could benefitted more by following the book.

651379,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JPI2,Melissa Niksic,"[7, 8]","I was apprehensive about going to see ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" because I was very disenchanted by the last film in the series, ""Goblet of Fire."" However, ""Phoenix"" surpassed all my expectations. There are a few small things about the movie that bothered me, but overall, I think it was brilliant.This film is based on the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot, but basically this is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and it gets off to a very crappy start. The Ministry of Magic attempts to expel Harry from school because he used magic to defend himself when dementors attacked him and his cousin, Dudley. Also, the majority of people think that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are lying about the return of Lord Voldemort, and everyone treats Harry like he has the plague. To top it all off, the Ministry has appointed one of its own members, Dolores Umbridge, to fill the vacant position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. Umbridge wastes no time wreaking havoc in the school and using all means necessary to put the Ministry's stamp on things. Meanwhile, Harry is distraught over mysterious dreams and visions that disturb him in his sleep. The film builds up to Harry's discovery of a new connection he has to Voldemort, and everything culminates in a violent encounter deep within the confines of the Department of Mysteries.I was blown away by this movie. It was just as dark and gritty as I'd hoped it would be, and as it needed to be in order to stay true to the book. Obviously, a lot of material had to be cut for the film adaptation, but I think the screenwriters did an excellent job editing the unnecessary parts and making the story flow together so smoothly on screen.Here are some of my favorite things about the film, along with a few gripes. (Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers, so continue reading at your own risk!)+ The new additions to the cast were amazing, especially the actresses who played Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, and the first time I read ""Phoenix,"" I knew she had to play Bellatrix...I just wish she had a bit more screen time! Staunton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge. I would have enjoyed seeing Umbridge's character be slightly more sinister at times, but really, I have no complaints. And as for Lynch, she was born to play the part of Luna Lovegood, hands down!+ The thestrals looked awesome, as did Kreacher the house elf.+ I thought Harry's relationship with Cho Chang was very sweet and well done. Their kiss under the mistletoe was so cute!+ The appearance of the Dark Mark tattoo on the Death Eaters was very well done: super creepy!+ The Ministry of Magic looked incredible in the film: it was just like I imagined it while reading the book. I was also quite impressed with the scene depicting the jailbreak from Azkaban: very slick!+ Generally, most of the plot changes were very slight and only served to better enhance the story for the screen (Harry seeing the memory of his father and Snape by using occlumency instead of spying in the pensieve; the Weasley twins only causing one major disturbance for Umbridge; etc.)- The character of Tonks (Natalia Tena) was introduced for the first time in this film. She looked really cool, but we didn't get to see much of her, which was a shame.- Speaking of missing characters, where the heck was Mundungus Fletcher?! His absence didn't really affect the plot of the movie too much, but I'm sure there were many fans of the book that were disappointed Mundungus was cut out altogether.- Rita Skeeter and Professor Lockhart were also missing from the film. Again, their absences didn't hurt the movie, but I was really hoping for a brief Kenneth Branagh cameo.- I don't understand why Kreacher's role in the whole trick involving Sirius wasn't played up more. We saw Kreacher twice, and Sirius even gave him the order to ""go away,"" but no one ever explained how Kreacher was the one who helped Voldemort lure Harry into coming to the Ministry.- There was no Sirius/Snape confrontation. Major bummer!- We never saw Dumbledore instruct Snape to meet up with Voldemort and the rest of the Death Eaters. This is the one omission from the film that bothered me the most. The significance of that event plays a big part in book seven, so I wonder how it will be explained in the next film.- Although the final scenes at the Ministry were good, I was a little disappointed with the way Sirius was killed. He never really dueled it out with Bellatrix: she just sort of appeared and mumbled ""avada kedavra"" under her breath, and it was all over. It should have been much more dramatic with more build-up to it. Also, it was never explained how Dumbledore and the other members of the Order knew that Harry and his friends were at the Ministry that night. Finally, the whole Harry/Voldemort possession thing at the end was kind of weird. I guess all these things were done in the essence of time and to make things look more dramatic on screen, but I think it could have been a bit better.Despite a few minor flaws, ""Phoenix"" is possibly the best Harry Potter film yet. I think the movie really stayed true to the spirit of the book, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll probably go back to see it in the theatre at least once more.",5,"""Phoenix"" rises to the occasion",1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,5453,"['was', 'apprehensive', 'going', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter',

I find the films extremely complex themselves, yet I love them just for the fantasy elements and the characters and their situations, plus also the fact that as time goes on, the series gets progressively darker and disturbing.

The book to movie translation of Order of the Phoenix was seamless. Daniel,Rupert,and Emma all give their best performances of the 1st 5 films in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. All 3 have settled into their main roles quite nicely by this point and their performance gives the movie a solid foundation. Then the connection between Harry and Voldemort is well done. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is largely a story about the connection between Harry and Voldemort and the film carries this out well. Then the scenes between Harry and Snape provide us with some fantastic acting. I've always liked Alan Rickman's Snape,and those Occlumency scenes,especially in the later ones where Snape is criticizing Harry's father and Harry is defending his father,show some real tension between Harry and Snape. You can truly feel the tension between Harry and Snape in these scenes. And I LOVED Luna Lovegood. Luna is a character who I became a far bigger fan of after the movies came out. Evanna Lynch is a PERFECT Luna. And the movie does a good job of showing you,especially in that scene towards the end in the corridor,that Harry and Luna are true friends and not just ""buddy buddy."" The harry-Luna friendship is one of my favorites in the Harry Potter series because it transcends age,year,gender,and even house. Luna became the closest friend Harry ever had outside of Gryffindor house and I really appreciate the Harry-Luna friendship for this reason. As for the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel in the Department of Mysteries,well that greatness of that scene speaks for itself. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix does a fantastic job of book to movie translation,as unimportant things such as Qudditch are left out and important things such as Dumbeldore's Army,the battles in the Department of Mysteries,and the prophecy are included. My only criticism is that Marietta Edgecombe should have been in the movie and been the D.A. traitor. Marrieta was the traitor in the book and she should have been the traitor in the movie. Cho Chang should have been cut from the movie herself,not given Marietta's role. Still,I felt so fulfilled and satisfied when I walked the theatre for the 1st time after seeing this movie that I can't give it anything less than 5 stars.

Yes, the deleted scenes are included in the special features, but it would be nice to see them incorporated into the movie itself.Harry Potter is a series that (for the most part)got progressively better with each movie.  Due to the fact that the actors got better as they grew up, and the books got better as they transitioned from being kids books to the darker books they became.  This one has a lot more violence and death than all the others.  Including one of the first central characters.  And unlike Cedric in the previous movie, it is a character that has been developed more, so there is some emotional investment there.This movie introduces the characters of Luna Lovegood and Delores Umbridge.  Both parts are cast perfectly in my opinion.  They very much conveyed the sense that Umbridge was borderline evil, definitely sadistic and always up to no good.  I liked the final battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore, but I think they could have made it longer.  Given that this was the shortest of the films, they should have put as much as possible into that battle.  Plus, they certainly could have added in some other elements from the books, like fleshing out the Snape and Lilly Potter storyline.The movie does set up a lot, but not as much as the book does.  The extras on the special feature disc are again top notch.  I got them mainly for the Making of series that spanned the entire set of Ultimate Editions.  It was not a double dip for me since I had not purchased the theatrical editions before.

Not only they have parted completely from the light and happy world created by the first two films, but they've also ignored any type of film summary. There's no synopsis of everything that's gone before. And good for that, I say. Go rent the other four if you need to catch up.Year five at Hogwarts begins with our hero Harry angrier than ever. Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.You will find that these are indeed ""darker"" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.The movie shows us the ""weird"" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters.

After Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the life-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization sworn to combat the forces of the Dark Lord. Soon he is back at Hogwarts School, having barely escaped expulsion for the underage use of magic in self-defense. But defamatory press against his allies and protectors, the insistence by well-meaning adults that Harry be kept in the dark about matters that most concern him, and a new insidious Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), put Harry in a persistently foul mood. If that were not enough, Harry is plagued by visions of Voldemort's scourge.The most fun in the Harry Potter movies is often found in the extravagant behavior of Hogwarts teachers, and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" pulls another coup on that front. Megalomania has never been so entertaining as when coupled with Delores Umbridge's sweetness and pastels. The film doesn't make light of the dire situation suffered by students and staff. Umbridge's spying and prying at Hogwarts is a thinly veiled Inquisition. Her efforts to stamp out individualism through Draconian policies are condemned as products of fear and egotism. A stark message made more than palatable by Imelda Staunton's gift for caricature. Evanna Lynch gives an especially charming performance among the students, as the eccentric, spacey Luna Lovegood. A new set, the interior of the Ministry of Magic is eye-catching but too CGI for my taste. The movie isn't as brooding as the book, but a shadow is unmistakably spreading over the wizarding world.",4,An Irritable Harry and the Seeds of Rebellion.,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,1843,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'menacing', 'tone', 'Voldemort', 'influence', 'wizarding', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'cousin', 'Dudley', 'are', 'attacked', 'dementors', 'life-sucking', 'creatures', 'guard', 'Azkaban', 'prison', 'Harry', 'whisked', 'away', 'headquarters', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'secret', 'organization', 'sworn', 'combat', 'forces', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Soon', 'back', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'having', 'barely', 'escaped', 'expulsion', 'underage', 'use', 'magic', 'self-defense', 'defamatory', 'press', 'allies', 'protectors', 'insistence', 'well-meaning', 'adults', 'Harry', 'be', 'kept', 'dark', 'matters', 'most', 'concern', 'new', 'insidious', 'Defense', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'teacher', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'put', 'Harry', 'persistently', 'foul', 'mood', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'Harry', 'plagued', 'visions', 'Voldemort', 'scourge.The', 'most', 'fun', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'often', 'found', 'extravagant', 'behavior', 'Hogwarts', 'teachers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'coup', 'front', 'Megalomania', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'entertaining', 'when', 'coupled', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'sweetness', 'pastels', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'light', 'dire', 'situation', 'suffered', 'students', 'staff', 'Umbridge', 'spying', 'prying', 'Hogwarts', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'Inquisition', 'efforts', 'stamp', 'out', 'individualism', 'Draconian', 'policies', 'are', 'condemned', 'products', 'fear', 'egotism', 'stark', 'message', 'made', 'more', 'palatable', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'gift', 'caricature', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'especially', 'charming', 'performance', 'students', 'eccentric', 'spacey', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'new', 'set', 'interior', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'eye-catching', 'too', 'CGI', 'taste', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'brooding', 'book', 'shadow', 'unmistakably', 'spreading', 'wizarding', 'world']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651401,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B00005JPI2,"MK ""Hussar""","[1, 2]","That age-old method by which a viewer or reader dismisses an interpretative form of art--based upon the superiority of its alter-ego--has personally always mystified me, as comparing a book to a movie seems inherently illogical.  The internal monologue character's have with themselves can never be adequately transmitted onto the silver screen without extending the movie to a running time of several days.  Likewise, facial expressions and nuances of body language portrayed by actors can only be transferred to the page by the most gifted of authors.  In other words, saying that ""the book was better"" seems a bit off, rationally-speaking.Well, this time the book is not better.  J.K Rowling's fifth book in the popular ""Harry Potter"" series was a bloated, rambling affair which entertained only if you were able to ""buzz"" through the chaff.  Director David Yates cuts through the fluff, strengthens the plotline, and improves the focus of a story which desperately required such changes.  Fans need not worry--although there are some noticeable changes, the movie remains true to the book.The film opens with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his semi-relative Dudley again about to lock horns when the duo is attacked by Dementors, those demonic Azkaban guards capable of instilling everlasting ennui in the minds of their victims.  Harry uses the Patronus charm to dispel the fiends, thus saving his own and Dudley's souls.  Unfortunately, the usage of magic off the grounds of Hogwarts in the presence of Muggles is strictly forbidden for underage spellcasters, thus provoking Harry's immediate expulsion from school.  Luckily, he is permitted an appeal before the Ministry of Magic, where he possesses as ace-in-the-hole the most influential wizard alive:  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).  From there, the protagonist is thrust into a dazzling game of political brinksmanship, where the players are willing to evade facts to retain a feeling of security.  However, the fate of the world remains unclear, ignored by those seeking to play their games and hide from one, terrible truth:  Lord Voldemort has returned.Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors are changed as rapidly as ""Harry Potter"" movie directors, and we find the same in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), an associate of Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, has accepted the position, and quickly reveals herself to be short on instruction and long on malice.  In the name of efficiency, she enacts as series of increasingly-stifling edicts, targets Harry for punishment whenever he professes that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gathering his forces, and attempts to undermine Professor Dumbledore's authority.  The truly vile nature of this character does not come across as clearly in the movie as in the text, and that is probably a good thing--this creation from Rowling's imagination is a near-sociopath who inflicted many readers with a desire to reach through the pages to strangle her.  The lengths to which she and Fudge go to suppress the truth conjure up the ghosts of Neville Chamberlain and Joe McCarthy in the mind of the viewer.  That she believes she is a force of good in the struggle against the dark is a terrifyingly subtle commentary on the real nature of delusion.  As an aside, if you would enjoy seeing a situation in which not one, but two characters like Umbridge do not get their comeuppance, may I gingerly suggest watching ""Funny Games.""Of course, Harry is not without allies as he remains stalwart.  His twin pillars of fortitude, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), provide much-needed reservoirs of strength to our hero as he confronts Umbridge, Voldemort, and a deadly new horror:  first love.  Heroism itself is examined thoroughly in the film, and is shown to contain several sharp edges us mundane citizens may never understand.  He sees that his peers expect him to lead, to save others, to sacrifice his normal life, and to triumph against the forces of night.  Indeed, he is coming closer to an ultimate epiphany:  that his life is, figuratively and literally, not his own to live.  His existence is irrevocably tied to his duty, and coming to gripes with this fact is something with which Harry struggles constantly.  Unfortunately, his personal demons are sharing space with some real-world evil entities--one of which who may just be able to read Harry's thoughts.""The Order of the Phoenix"" is dark without being dreary.  Harry's relationship with his fugitive uncle Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his bittersweet attempt at romance, and the antics of the Weasley twins help balance the tone of the film.  The set design is uniformly impressive, and the realism of the otherworldly creatures can easily suspend one's disbelief.  There were a few sections from the book that I would have preferred included in the film; nevertheless, one's enjoyment is preserved throughout the entirety of the movie, despite the disappearance of a certain screaming portrait.  The acting is quite good, with the exception of some of the actors portraying Aurors and Deatheaters.  In summary, all of our favorite friends have returned to populate a realm which exists only in Rowling's mind, yet Yates makes them seem real enough to the rest of us Muggles.  This is one of the better film translations thus far, and well-worth the time of any aficionado of mysteries from the magical world.",4,Harry realizes how fear of evil's return acts as rot upon even

If you're reading this without starting at the beginning, you need to stop here and go back.  There's really no point in starting in the middle of things.  As for this movie, I think they really did great in the beginning with the series, but starting with the fourth movie, things seem to be slipping a bit.Harry Potter doesn't start off his fifth year very well.  After defending himself against Dementors, he is almost expelled for using magic while underaged.  Even worse, Voldemort is back and noone seems to believe him outside of those closest to him.  In fact, the Ministry is making him look like a fool and actually posting one of their own within Hogwarts school.  And she's a terrible nightmare, who just seems to have it in for Harry.  With Voldemort growing stronger and the kids at Hogwarts not as protected as they should be, it's a recipe for disaster.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe: Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ron WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerHelena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix LestrangeRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus hagricRalph Fiennes: Lord VoldemortBrendan Gleeson: Mad Eye MoodyMichael Gambon: Albus DumbledoreGary Oldman: Sirius BlackEvanna Lynch: Luna LovegoodAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeI had noticed in the fifth book that Harry seemed much much angrier than ever before.  I think Radcliffe pulled that off in this movie, but due to the limited scenes we never really know why he's as angry as he is.  Sure there's some stuff that happens that would make anyone angry, but it wasn't nearly as well explained as it was in the book.  Watson and Grint still backed him up well, and it just wouldn't be the right movie without the three of them in it.  Gambon as Dumbledore I still have mixed feelings about.  That warmth is still missing from him, although he does have that commanding presence.  I do have to say I absolutely loved Lynch as Luna Lovegood and though she did a fantastic job; spacey yet caring.The plot somewhat follows the book, but once again certain elements are missing that just really make the story.  Sometimes you need a little backstory on things and it was sadly lacking here.  Those scenes that were included were rushed and jumbled and didn't really give a good feel on what the whole story is all about.  A lot of it would have just been easy to make conversation scenes too, but would have held so much information that they would sitll have been important.  Still, the action scenes were well done and they returned a little of the detail in this book, especially within the Ministry of Magic itself.  So I did appreciate that they tried to make the scenes look as authentic as possible.  I just wish they would have spent as much time as that on the story too.The scenes, as said before, were well done.  Lots of detail and the use of magic was visually stunning.  I especially liked the battles scenes and the way they zipped about the screen.  Very neat way of showing that.  The moving pictures are always fantastic, although in the case of Umbridge, the evil teacher, her kitty pictures were almost as loathsome as they sounded in the book, and I even like cats!  They did a good job of recreating that.  The music was still good, but not at the forefront like it is with most of the other movies.

Johnson,"[1, 3]","I will not bore you by recapping the story or the performances, since many people appear to like assuming that role.However, I would like to make two observations about this and HP4.First, as many people have noted, there is a lot of material not included in the movie. This is inevitable given the length and all the subplots that are in the book.  However, I think they really missed something important here and in HP4 by dropping the storyline about Fred and George and their preoccupation with gags and tricks, leading to their joke shop. This could have given some much needed light hearted scenes to help counterbalance the dark and evil aspects of the movies.Second, is my personal belief that in most cases excessive wealth leads people (whether they are millionaire athletes, actors, or writers) to evil ways and usually the belief that they are somehow above normal humans. The first HP books were enjoyable stories with a reasonable balance of good times and bad. The later books are entirely devoted to the dark side (even if the theme is fighting the dark side) and, as such, were not nearly as enjoyable to read.  Of couse, that did not affect the author's ability to make more millions.

Herum ""Movies Hate You Too""","[0, 1]","Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixUltimate Blu-ray EditionYear:  2007Rating:  PG-13Runtime:  2 HRS, 18 MINDirector:  David YatesStarring:  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Imelda Staunton, Bonnie Wright, Tom Felton, Evanna Lynch, Matthew Lewis, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Jason Isaacs, and Ralph FiennesFilm Rating:  3 out of 5 starsVideo Rating:  5 out of 5 starsAudio Rating:  5 out of 5 starsExtras:  3 out of 5 starsOverall Rating:  4 out of 5 starsThe FilmThe Dark Lord returned, a boy died, and Harry was at the center of it all.  That's where we left off when Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ended.  We're now past the midway point in the franchise.  At the time of this film's release six years had passed since the release of Sorcerer's Stone and that film feels a world away now.  Harry's world continues down its dark path that was laid down in Prisoner of Azkaban, the growing pains that emerged in Goblet of Fire continue, and now the magical world is taking on a more political feel.Harry is despondent; he's stuck again at the Dursley's (his Aunt and Uncle), cut off from his friends, and is still reeling from the death of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and the rise of  Voldemort at the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  No one wants to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned and the Ministry of Magic (Wizard Government to all that are uninformed) and press are working hard to discredit him in the eyes of the public.  Much to Harry's dismay the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is a Ministry official that's hell bent on controlling Hogwart's and its students.  To make matter worse, Harry is experiencing strange nightmares that seem tied to the mysterious object that Voldemort is searching for.I have very mixed feelings about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  There are several aspects of the film that I really like and there are several things about the film that annoy me considerably.  Do I like the film?  Yes.  Do I love the film?  No.  Is it a film that personifies the term ""Missed Opportunity?""  Absolutely, possibly more than any film in the entire series.  I try not to judge the Harry Potter films against the Harry Potter novels; I'm not an avid reader by any means so I always try to judge a film just as a film since that's my area of ""expertise.""  That's hard to do with this film; Order of the Phoenix is the longest Potter book but is the shortest of the first seven films.  It feels rushed, some of that has to do with the new screen writer Michael Goldenberg.  This is the only Potter film including the soon to be released Deathly Hallows Part 2 not to have Steve Kloves as its screenwriter.  He does an admirable job considering he's coming into the franchise halfway through but the film feels rushed and strangely convenient.  There's so much going on in the book, I know sacrifices have to be made to turn an 870 page book into a film of reasonable length.  With that said, I feel that too much was excised from the final product and while the movie moves along at a brisk pace I get the constant feeling that something's missing.  So much of the film is focused on just advancing the story forward that there's not a lot of opportunity to enjoy what's going because you're being hit over the head with lots of exposition.  What do I think led to this rushed feeling?  I believe that Order of the Phoenix might have fallen prey to penny pinching executives at Warner Brothers that wanted to get the maximum amount of showtimes per day by cutting this film to a paltry 2 hour 18 minutes which is quite short by Potter standards.  In addition to the new screenwriter a new director takes over as well; David Yates, who was best known as a gritty TV movie director steps into his first major theatrical film.  While I definitely wouldn't use the word ""overwhelmed"" I would say he made some rookie mistakes by imploring some lazy film making techniques namely in the form of montages.  There are two montages in the film; by comparison there are zero montages throughout the first four films.  They just don't fit into the flow of the film well and feel out of place in the series as a whole.  I can't help but think that replacing the five minutes of montages with 15-20 minutes of actual story would have benefited this film immensely.I don't want you to think that I don't like Order of the Phoenix because I do.  The film succeeds in many ways and sets up the second half of the Harry Potter saga well.  You can look at the Harry Potter films individually, in pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8), or in halves (1-4, 5-8).  If you can remember back to Sorcerer's Stone, that film had the huge task of introducing the audience to Harry's world.  The first four films dealt with the prospect of Voldemort returning.  Order of the Phoenix has a similar task to Sorcerer's Stone because it has to introduce the audience to Harry's world with Voldemort in it and the the next three films deal with that.  Order of the Phoenix introduces the audience to the politics of the Wizarding World.  Harry is not widely believed after finishing the Tri-Wizard Tournament and his fight against Voldemort and is being accused of being a liar and is being smeared in the news.  I find the political aspect of Phoenix's story to be one of its best strong points and its nice to get a larger glimpse of the world outside of Hogwarts.  Another strong point of the film is it's final forty-five minutes because it has some of the most exciting scenes of the series so far and almost makes me forget about some of the other shortcomings I mentioned earlier.  The CGI used in Order of the Phoenix continues to impress.  There's the occasional moment in the film where the CGI isn't perfect which I think comes from them over reaching what could be accomplished with computer effects in 2007.  95% of the effects are outstanding and the remaining 5% are good; there wasn't anything that made me cringe so please don't take my criticism too seriously.  While series newcomer David Yates made some mistakes in regard to pacing he does a great job creating a wonderful look for this film.  I've praised Alsonso Cuar&oacute;n and Mike Newell's direction in the past two films, I would say David Yate's would fall somewhere in between their looks.  I don't think Cuar&oacute;n's looked could be topped but Yate's does a great job and gives Order of the Phoenix a wonderful look that is both dark and haunting while still beautiful.As much as Prisoner of Azkaban was a film that changed the tone of the franchise, Order of the Phoenix changed how we perceive the cast.  The Harry Potter films at their heart have always focused on Harry, Ron, and Hermione with most of the remaining focus being on the adult characters (i.e. Dumbledore, Snape, or McGonagall) relationships with the trio.  That however changes to some degree in Order of the Phoenix; Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, the Weasley twins, newcomer Luna Lovegood, and other students become more integral to the plot.  Most of these characters have been with the series since the beginning but now have a little more to do than just stand around.  Harry also gets his first girlfriend in the form of Cho Chang (Katie Leung) which creates a cute moment that reminds the audience that Harry isn't quite all grown up yet.  The main newcomer to the cast is Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake) as Dolores Umbridge the new Defense Against the Dark Arts and the film's secondary villain.  She's an absolute treat but is also terribly infuriating which is sort of the point of her character.  She's wears pink and wants to believe she's sweeter than sweet but she's the complete opposite.  Stephen King described her character in the book as the ""greatest make-believe villain to come along since Hannibal Lecter.""  While she doesn't eat her victims liver with fava beans and a nice butterbeer she does live up to King's praise because she's quite horrible and you really root against her.  In a smaller supporting role is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort's most loyal and dangerous Death Eaters.  I've never been a big fan of Helena (aside from Fight Club) but she plays Bellatrix, it's not a glamorous role but she embraces it and she seems properly strange and crazy.  Alan Rickman of course returns as Severus Snape and is finally given more to do than just scowl at Harry in his most important role since Azkaban.  Speaking of Azkaban; Gary Oldman and David Thewlis return which was an extremely welcome addition since they're two of my favorite characters.  Due to the plot Michael Gambon's role as Dumbledore is smaller than in past films and that loss is felt throughout the film but by the end who'll almost forget he was gone.While not the strongest entry into the Harry Potter series Order of the Phoenix isn't the weakest entry either. The new screenwriter and new director combined to make the perfect storm of film making mistakes in the form of pacing and montages that keep Order of the Phoenix from reaching is highest potential which is unfortunate because it had the makings of being one of the best film entries.  Director David Yates does a nice a job creating a very pretty yet haunting film and it does advance the story along and sets up the remaining films up nicely.  It's nice to see the younger cast taking on a larger role in the film and the two new cast additions are both effective villains.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is sort of mixed bag but it's still a decent film that ranks somewhere in the middle of the Harry Potter pack.The Blu-rayThis is getting very infuriating; the Ultimate Edition sets come out in pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and each release has slightly different packaging than the last pair to be released.  If you remember back to my review of Prisoner of Azkaban I talked about how the UE's (Ultimate Editions) for Azkaban & Goblet were slightly taller and had a lenticular cover instead of an embossed cardboard cover.  This pissed me off since I like everything to match on my DVD racks and now the most recent UE's don't match either of the previous releases.  So what changed this time?  Instead of being three disc releases like the first four UE releases, Order of the Phoenix (and Half Blood Prince) only have two discs.  They only have two discs because unlike previous films they were released on Blu-ray and DVD at the same time and didn't have to port over the DVD extras to the Blu-ray releases so there's not as much overflow.  That means that the boxes are skinnier than the three disc UE releases and therefore don't match the previous sets in a new way.  I would have preferred them to stuff a blank piece of cardboard in the box to pad out the width of the set so that they would match the previous four sets.As I stated in the Azkaban review this isn't a deal breaker for me but it's frustrating that Warner Brothers can't stick with box design so my UE Collection would look nice and match instead of being a mismatched mess.  I can only assume that the final UE releases for Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2 will differ from these sets in one way or another.  Any guesses on how they'll differ; height, width, discs, cover art?Just like previous sets you get the character cards (Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge), a digital copy of the film, and the 48 page collectible book.  Continuing the trend of the past several Ultimate Editions there isn't an Extended Cut of the film.  Considering how much extra footage I've heard was shot it's disappointing not to see any new footage added back into shortest of the first seven films.  I'm going to be quite annoyed if in a year or two Warner Brothers releases this film with an extended or director's cut after not offering it here.Sizing up the video transfer for this release is quite easy, it's perfect.  I gave Goblet of Fire a 5 out of 5 video score which I feel was fair but Order of the Phoenix looks even better.  It's a stunning transfer that looks exactly like it did when I saw the film projected digitally in 2007.  Black levels are great, detail is astonishing, and colors are appropriately represented.  It's perfection in the form of a Blu-ray.Though not as outright impressive as the video the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is also wonderful.  Order of the Phoenix may not have as many action sequences as its predecessor but it's no less impressive when given the chance.  Rumbling bass and some great directionality are present when the action picks up and in the quieter scenes you'll be impressed with the subtlety the track can provide.  No matter if it's a dementor attack, a classroom scene, or a fight to the death you'll find the dialogue crystal clear and easy to understand even at low volume levels.Disc One features a PiP track hosted by Daniel Radcliffe.  The track is quite informative and Daniel Radcliffe genuinely seems interested in presented the information to the audience.  There's a lot of good information presented in the track but there are some long gaps that could annoy anyone that's just watched the movie straight through and is now watching the film with the commentary track on.  All the major points are able to be viewed via the ""Focus Points"" feature that plays the PiP segments on their own individually or in a ""Play All"" mode.  Disc two features the Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 5: Evolution documentary.  This is a major improvement over the dull as dishwater Part 4 segment from Goblet of Fire.  This segment dives into how everything from the actors, the castle, the logo, the effects, and the franchise as a whole has evolved since the first film.  It's a fascinating segment and there are lots of before and after comparisons to be seen and it's one of my favorite segments so far.  There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes presented in HD, none are exactly mind blowing and they're the same scenes that were on the original Blu-ray release in 2007.  From what I've heard there's a lot more extra footage that still hasn't seen the light of day so it's disappointing not to see any of it presented here in this ""Ultimate"" Edition release.  Two short featurettes are also presented in HD:-Building the Magic: Behind the Sets of Harry Potter is 20 minutes long and goes in great detail on what goes into making the sets of the Harry Potter films special.-Trailing Tonks is 19 minutes long and follows actress Natalia Tena as she gives a tour of Leavesden Studio where much of the Potter films are shot.There are three SD featurettes; The Rebellion Begins, Behind the Magic, and Fullfilling a Prophecy.  I took a quick peek at them and they're OK but we all know how I feel about standard definition extras and I think most fans will get most of what they need to know from the HD special features.  Last but not least is a collection of Order of the Phoenix trailer presented in HD.Impersonating a snake... pay no attention to my arms.ConclusionI consider this film to be the biggest missed opportunity of the franchise.  It's not a bad film, it just never reaches the level of greatness that I think it could have reached.  It's still better than the first two Potter films and this release has flawless video and audio presentations.  I'm still pretty upset by the continuing packaging changes but the Creating the World of Harry Potter documentary is one of the series best so far so those almost balance each other out.  If you just want to pick up the film you can purchase the single disc release that has almost identical video & audio and many of the special features (excluding the documentary) for about $10.",4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Blu-ray Edition,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,15742,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'PhoenixUltimate', 'Blu-ray', 'EditionYear', '2007Rating',

651422,A8Y520XGRYSY7,B00005JPI2,NineseveN,"[0, 0]","As a mostly macho male who's been converted to the world that is the Harry Potter films, I entered into the first movie with a bit of reluctance (and only did so at the behest of my better half). Much to my surprise, I was completely entertained and rather surprised as to how much I liked the first film. Since I'd bought her the entire series up to that point (films 1-4), I decided to give The Chamber of Secrets a chance as well. Again, I was pleasantly entertained and found myself actually caring about the story. So on I went, taking in the third and subsequent fourth film in the series to date and at the end, I was eager to see what happened next, which is the mark of any solid film series.And what happened next was a very surprising, yet welcome turn. Things in the Harry Potter universe got serious. Yes, the death of Cedric and the locked wand scene with Voldemort from The Goblet of Fire were serious, but those moments also purposefully lacked the level of gravity that we're greeted with right up front with the Order of the Phoenix. Up until this installment in the franchise, Harry Potter is portrayed as a child with grown-up problems; an individual that's unfairly tossed into a world he doesn't fully understand and into a conflict that he wants no part of, save for the temptation of vengeance for his slain parents. When Professor Umbridge puts the kibosh on magic, Hermione senses what needs to be done, but she also realizes that she needs Harry to pull it off. This is where Harry turns into a man. He sees the conflict beyond his struggle with Voldemort, he accepts that this battle and those that will come are about more than his vendetta against the dark lord; it's about the world of magic and the people within it. Harry confronts the problems he and his peers face and begins to climb over the obstacles and front of him, leading others in the process (albeit a little reluctantly at first).But there's also the larger point, which I'm not sure Rowling intended to make, or at least didn't intentionally craft it to parallel some of the current societal topics such a rights relating to self defense and the bearing of arms, which are almost completely absent in the UK. One of the points that is driven home throughout the second half of film is that sometimes things that are dangerous are best left in the hands of the just, otherwise the just will be defenseless against the unjust, who will not abide by any rules prohibiting dangerous things or nefarious conduct. The Ministry of Magic, through Umbridge, pulls of a complete parallel to an overbearing nanny-state government the removes objectionable things from the hands of the good in order to try and hold back the tides of evil (in this case by taking the teaching and use of magic away from the student body). Of course, as often happens in real life, this is a total failure, the only thing Umbridge and the Ministry end up accomplishing is leaving the children naked and vulnerable to the real evil in the world; one they flat out refuse to see in Voldemort's return.As someone who won't read the books until I've seen all of the films, I can't say that I was disappointed by what was left out of the movie, as I have no idea what I am missing. While the overall story of the film does seem dead in spots where mostly benign but key pieces of information or character development appear to be missing, and though overall the film seemed a bit rushed and crammed together, it's still an entertaining ride and left me wanting more, which again is the mark of any great film series. The final battle scene, which is wonderfully done and occurs as the most impressive, powerful and unique display of magic to date, left me with a sense that this was a transitional film for Harry Potter, that the next time we meet him, the boy who's been the subject of rumors, whispers, prophecies and legend will be coming into his own and wielding that great power that everyone has spoken of since the first film.",4,The boy wizard becomes a man,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,3996,"['mostly', 'macho', 'male', 'who', 'been', 'converted', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'entered', 'first', 'movie', 'bit', 'reluctance', 'only', 'did', 'so', 'behest', 'better', 'half', 'Much', 'surprise', 'was', 'completely', 'entertained', 'rather', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'first', 'film', ""'d"", 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'films', '1-4', 'decided', 'give', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'chance', 'as', 'well', 'Again', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'entertained', 'found', 'actually', 'caring', 'story', 'went', 'taking', 'third', 'subsequent', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'date', 'end', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'mark', 'solid', 'film', 'series.And', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'was', 'very', 'surprising', 'yet', 'welcome', 'turn', 'Things', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'universe', 'got', 'serious', 'Yes', 'death', 'Cedric', 'locked', 'wand', 'scene', 'Voldemort', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'were', 'serious', 'moments', 'also', 'purposefully', 'lacked', 'level', 'gravity', ""'re"", 'greeted', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Up', 'installment', 'franchise', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'portrayed', 'child', 'grown-up', 'problems', 'individual', 'unfairly', 'tossed', 'world', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'conflict', 'part', 'save', 'temptation', 'vengeance', 'slain', 'parents', 'When', 'Professor', 'Umbridge', 'kibosh', 'magic', 'Hermione', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'also', 'Harry', 'pull', 'off', 'where', 'Harry', 'man', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'Voldemort', 'battle', 'will', 'come', 'are', 'more', 'vendetta', 'dark', 'lord', 'world', 'magic', 'people', 'Harry', 'problems', 'peers', 'face', 'climb', 'obstacles', 'front', 'leading', 'others', 'process', 'little', 'reluctantly', 'first', '.But', 'also', 'larger', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Rowling', 'intended', 'make', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'intentionally', 'craft', 'parallel', 'current', 'societal', 'topics', 'such', 'rights', 'relating', 'self', 'defense', 'bearing', 'arms', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'absent', 'UK', 'One', 'points', 'driven', 'home', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'sometimes', 'things', 'are', 'dangerous', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'hands', 'just', 'otherwise', 'just', 'will', 'be', 'defenseless', 'unjust', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'abide', 'rules', 'prohibiting', 'dangerous', 'things', 'nefarious', 'conduct', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Umbridge', 'pulls', 'complete', 'parallel', 'overbearing', 'nanny-state', 'government', 'removes', 'objectionable', 'things', 'hands', 'good', 'order', 'try', 'hold', 'back', 'tides', 'evil', 'case', 'taking', 'teaching', 'use', 'magic', 'away', 'student', 'body', 'course', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'total', 'failure', 'only', 'thing', 'Umbridge', 'Ministry', 'end', 'up', 'accomplishing', 'leaving', 'children', 'naked', 'vulnerable', 'real', 'evil', 'world', 'one', 'flat', 'out', 'refuse', 'see', 'Voldemort', 'return.As', 'someone', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'am', 'missing', 'overall', 'story', 'film', 'seem', 'dead', 'spots', 'where', 'mostly', 'benign', 'key', 'pieces', 'information', 'character', 'development', 'appear', 'be', 'missing', 'overall', 'film', 'seemed', 'bit', 'rushed', 'crammed', 'together', 'still', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'again', 'mark', 'great', 'film', 'series', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'most', 'impressive', 'powerful', 'unique', 'display', 'magic', 'date', 'left', 'sense', 'was', 'transitional', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'next', 'time', 'meet', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'subject', 'rumors', 'whispers', 'prophecies', 'legend', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'own', 'wielding', 'great', 'power', 'everyone', 'spoken', 'first', 'film']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651428,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JPI2,Only-A-Child,"[0, 2]","Normally I don't wait several years to comment on a recent film,  simply because it is unlikely that many will read my comment.  But the comments and reviews for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value.  And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release.As has already been said this chapter of the story is a relatively small-scale one.  The Ministry of Magic is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk, and so it plants a mole (Dolores Umbridge - slickly played by Imelda Staunton) to discredit Dumbledore and to prevent him from training students to defend themselves against the dark arts.  The Ministry is in denial about the return of ""he who must not be named""  (i.e. Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack).Personally ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is my favorite of all the films up to now.  I have a lot of reasons.  For one, while the three principle actors by 2007 had begun to look a bit too old for their characters (Rupert Grint especially so),  the disparity is not so great that a lot of energy must be expended suspending disbelief;  as is the case with the later films.  And Daniel Radcliffe uses his maturity as a actor to bring a sophisticated internal life to Harry; something he could not quite manage in the earlier films.  Another reason is that it represents the midway point of the overall story and therefore strikes the best balance between serious elements and elements of whimsy.  And things stay fresh with the introduction of new characters like Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helen Bonham Carter) who fit the film's dark/light balance by being evil characters who are amusingly overplayed.But I suspect that the biggest reason I favor this particular film is that it does not flinch from the book's theme of existential despair.  And they economically pull this off through the inspired casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, my all-time favorite Potter character.  Harry suffers a lot inside, which is one of the things that makes him different from the other students at Hogwarts, most of whom tend to avoid him.  And he in turn tends to isolate himself, even from his close friends Ron and Hermione.  The film version of Luna is the only friend who really gets Harry and he is energized by their interactions.  And she has the most profound line of the whole franchise:  ""The things we lose have a way of coming back to us, even if it is not always in a way that we expect"".Rowling and others have pointed out that Luna is Hermione's alter ego; an illogical and impulsive counterpart to Hermione's analytical realist. Both process more information than their fellow students, but Hermione has filters to define and dispense with the information.  Luna is less judgmental, for her processing is experiencing.While these comparisons help define Herminone, Luna herself is important because of her similarity to Harry. The subtle similarities regularly amaze him and they allow her to repeatedly demonstrate to him that he is not alone.  She is his bridge to everyone else in a story where he must subordinate his desire to go it alone if he hopes to successfully engage the forces of the Dark Lord. The film was especially focused on illustrating this special quality of their relationship.Overall, what has most amazed me about the whole Harry Potter series is the evidence that Rowling had the entire story pretty much outlined in detail at the beginning and engaged in considerable foreshadowing; something you do not appreciate with the first reading of each book.  The ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" adaptation provides an interesting example of how this foreshadowing can be done visually.  Ginny Weasley is destined to become Harry's love interest but up until this point it has been mostly a little sister / big brother type relationship (Bonnie Wright was only 10 when featured in ""Chamber of Secrets"").  In ""Order of the Phoenix""  Harry is still preoccupied with Cho Chang (Katie Leung who looks considerably older than Wright).  What to watch for are the scenes in which the Harry - Cho relationship progresses; each time the editor goes out on a static shot of a grim Ginny observing their interaction.I am quite happy with the two-disc special edition DVD, since it did not promise to include an extended version of the film and the current $2 price for a used copy is quite affordable.  The second disc includes a number of special features.  ""Trailing Tonks"", a tour of the film sets hosted by offbeat Natalia Tena is especially good.  There are also a number of humorous deleted scenes of Emma Thompson portraying Professor TrelawneyThen again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",5,My Favorite of the Franchise,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,4824,"['Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'several', 'years', 'comment', 'recent', 'film', 'simply', 'unlikely', 'many', 'will', 'read', 'comment', 'comments', 'reviews', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', '2007', 'are', 'generally', 'so', 'off-the-mark', 'few', 'supplemental', 'comments', 'could', 'be', 'value', 'hopefully', 'comments', 'gain', 'useful', 'perspective', 'distance', 'few', 'years', 'release.As', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'chapter', 'story', 'relatively', 'small-scale', 'one', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'worried', 'presents', 'security', 'risk', 'so', 'plants', 'mole', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'slickly', 'played', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'discredit', 'Dumbledore', 'prevent', 'training', 'students', 'defend', 'dark', 'arts', 'Ministry', 'denial', 'return', 'who', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'named', 'i.e', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'back', 'preparing', 'attack', '.Personally', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'favorite', 'films', 'now', 'have', 'lot', 'reasons', 'one', 'three', 'principle', 'actors', '2007', 'had', 'begun', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'characters', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'especially', 'so', 'disparity', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'lot', 'energy', 'must', 'be', 'expended', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'case', 'later', 'films', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'maturity', 'actor', 'bring', 'sophisticated', 'internal', 'life', 'Harry', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'manage', 'earlier', 'films', 'reason', 'midway', 'point', 'overall', 'story', 'therefore', 'best', 'balance', 'serious', 'elements', 'elements', 'whimsy', 'things', 'stay', 'fresh', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'Umbridge', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'fit', 'film', 'dark/light', 'balance', 'being', 'evil', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'amusingly', 'overplayed.But', 'suspect', 'biggest', 'reason', 'favor', 'particular', 'film', 'not', 'flinch', 'book', 'theme', 'existential', 'despair', 'economically', 'pull', 'off', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Potter', 'character', 'Harry', 'lot', 'one', 'things', 'different', 'other', 'students', 'Hogwarts', 'most', 'whom', 'tend', 'avoid', 'turn', 'tends', 'isolate', 'even', 'close', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'film', 'version', 'Luna', 'only', 'friend', 'who', 'really', 'Harry', 'energized', 'interactions', 'most', 'profound', 'line', 'whole', 'franchise', 'things', 'lose', 'have', 'way', 'coming', 'back', 'even', 'not', 'always', 'way', 'expect', '.Rowling', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Luna', 'Hermione', 'alter', 'ego', 'illogical', 'impulsive', 'counterpart', 'Hermione', 'analytical', 'realist', 'process', 'more', 'information', 'fellow', 'students', 'Hermione', 'filters', 'define', 'dispense', 'information', 'Luna', 'less', 'judgmental', 'processing', 'experiencing.While', 'comparisons', 'help', 'define', 'Herminone', 'Luna', 'important', 'similarity', 'Harry', 'subtle', 'similarities', 'regularly', 'amaze', 'allow', 'repeatedly', 'demonstrate', 'not', 'alone', 'bridge', 'everyone', 'else', 'story', 'where', 'must', 'subordinate', 'desire', 'go', 'alone', 'successfully', 'engage', 'forces', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'film', 'was', 'especially', 'focused', 'illustrating', 'special', 'quality', 'relationship.Overall', 'what', 'most', 'amazed', 'whole', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'evidence', 'Rowling', 'had', 'entire', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'outlined', 'detail', 'beginning', 'engaged', 'considerable', 'foreshadowing', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'first', 'reading', 'book', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'adaptation', 'interesting', 'example', 'how', 'foreshadowing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'visually', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'destined', 'become', 'Harry', 'love', 'interest', 'up', 'point', 'been', 'mostly', 'little', 'sister', '/', 'big', 'brother', 'type', 'relationship', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'was', 'only', '10', 'when', 'featured', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Harry', 'still', 'preoccupied', 'Cho', 'Chang', 'Katie', 'Leung', 'who', 'considerably', 'older', 'Wright', 'What', 'watch', 'are', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'Cho', 'relationship', 'time', 'editor', 'out', 'static', 'shot', 'grim', 'Ginny', 'observing', 'interaction.I', 'am', 'quite', 'happy', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'promise', 'include', 'extended', 'version', 'film', 'current', '2', 'price', 'used', 'copy', 'quite', 'affordable', 'second', 'disc', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'Trailing', 'Tonks', 'tour', 'film', 'sets', 'hosted', 'offbeat', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'especially', 'good', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'humorous', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'portraying', 'Professor', 'TrelawneyThen', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651430,A2PDPPIQ3SZ29V,B00005JPI2,"Pamela Correa ""peanut gallery""","[1, 1]","Disc 1 - the movie.I gave the movie only 3 stars.  I am a fan of the books, so it was inevitable that I was disappointed with the movie, but not for the reasons you might think.  Much was cut out, but that isn't what bothered me.  As the longest book in the series, it was a given that many things would be cut.  My main gripe is that the 5th movie installment didn't stay true to the story.  The other four movies managed to do that, despite all the subplots, etc that were left out.First and foremost, this book is ALL about Harry's emotions; his frustration, his anger.  He is at the breaking point after years of being loved one minute and hated the next.  In the beginning, he is furious with Ron and Hermione, throughout the book he constantly battles with Umbridge, and at the end he explodes in Dumbledore's office.He lands himself in detention with Umbridge several times because he just can't control his temper.  He struggles throughout the book with Dumbledore's apparent lack of caring.  He is worried about Sirius being locked up in Grimmauld Place, and he hates Snape for constantly antagonizing Sirius.  Harry begins to alienate himself from eveyone after the attack on Arthur Weasley because he think Voldemort might be possessing him.  None of this was portrayed adequately in the film, not to mention that he is both tormented and enthralled by the reoccuring dreams of the door to the department of mysteries.  All of these things lead up to Harry's explosion of rage in Dumbledore's office at the end.  It was not a quiet conversation.  Harry screams, yells, and smashes up the office.  He loses complete control and all his emotions come spilling out.  After which, Dumbledore proceeds to explain to Harry that it is all his fault, that he has known of the prophecy all along and that he should have told Harry sooner than he did.  He tells him that he was trying to protect him because he had come to care for Harry so much.  The true essence of that scene was lost in the film.It just seems that directors are caving in to special effects and movie theatrics and losing sight of what the story is all about.*On the plus side, I did think Umbridge was very well cast and I thought the possession scene with Harry was really great!  There were a few good moments in the film.*Disc 2 - special features.  I don't know what else to say except that they sucked!  The deleted scenes were nothing, just 20 second fillers.  I had hoped that there would be some really great scenes in there that they just didn't have time for.  The Tailing Tonks segment was terrible, didn't really show any of the behind the scenes operations in depth enough to give us any idea of how the movie was made.  There were no cast interviews, no explanation of script writing/changes - nothing.

651433,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B00005JPI2,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[1, 2]","From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far.From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and ""Goblet of Fire"", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think ""Prisoner of Azkaban""'s shrunken heads), but this movie--""Order of the Phoenix""--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike ""Goblet of Fire""--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is how a book should be adapted.Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted...

651436,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B00005JPI2,Paul J. Moade,"[2, 5]","I'll open Pandora's box on this and risk the raves of outraged fans.Anyway ....There are those of us who have not read all of the books in the set and therefore depend on the film to convey what is going on in Harry Potter's world. While I enjoyed the movie for it's whimsical content and some very well done scenes/characterizations, I find this particular installment to be rather diffuse and confusing (no, I have not read the book - didn't realize that was a prerequisite).Scenes just kinda pop up with no real rhyme or reason as to why they are there. I am sure the written work explains everything, but the movie should stand-alone and not rely on its audience having read the author's work. I can understand the need to cut from a book to preclude a film that might easily be over four hours long, but then the cuts have to be very selective and intelligently done.Couple examples: Why the opening scenes with Dudley and why are the dementors attacking Harry? Were they sent by the Ministry? By Voldemort? Why is the Ministry taking extremes in this case with Harry using magic outside of school? He has done so before with the Ministry just shrugging their shoulders (""The Ministry of Magic does not send one to Azkaban for blowing up their Aunt"", from Prisoner).Why is Minister Fudge concerned with Dumbledore vying for his job? Nothing was hinted at this in earlier films, nor was it addressed in the beginning of this film. Why would the Minister deny the return of Voldemort as a tool to use against Dumbledore? This makes no sense for a politician and turns out to work against him. Seems like the Minister Fudge has suddenly taken a dislike to Harry and those who support him. Was this V's work?More development was needed on Prof. Snape's encounters with Harry's father while a student himself. While explaining some of Snape's attitude towards Harry in earlier films, it is too shallow. Ditto for L. Malfoy's encounter with Harry in the Hall of Mysteries. We learned in Goblet that he was a Death Eater and follower of Voldemort, but too little was detailed on his role here.And the list goes on. Certainly more film time could have been allocated for this movie to make it more coherent. After all, this is not a test of the market place. Harry Potter films have proven themselves (Phoenix grossed 44.2 million on its opening day in the US) and a larger investment (by the producer) will certainly be returned as the film is released. I felt like I was watching the `Cliff Notes' version of the story when I viewed this episode.Character studies, which have always been a strong point in the series, were mostly lacking here. A notable exception was Delores Umbridge who was deliciously detestable and sufficiently developed to give a `feel' for the character.Madeye Moody, Lupus and others had cameo appearances. Would have loved to see why they were there. All were part of the original Order of the Phoenix, but again, this was not explained but briefly. Harry Potter's group of students was called ""Dumbledore's Army"" and not ""Order of the Phoenix"" so why the title of the film?I have always enjoyed openings with the Dursley's. They set the theme of a social outcast for Harry, hence his strong ties to Hogwarts and the world of magic where he is not only accepted but acclaimed. These have always had some development or pertinance to the main story, though.In ""Sorcerer's Stone"" we are introduced to Harry's adopted family and shown how he is treated. It is a lead-in to the rest of the film and is well done. In ""Chamber"" we see progress. Although still badly treated, Harry is moved from the cupboard to Dudley's spare bedroom. And while it is not plainly stated, Vernon and company now have a grudging respect/fear of Harry's abilities and friends. In ""Prisoner"" the Dursley family is extended to include a visit from the Aunt -- who turns out to be every bit as petty and hateful as the base family. A bit of comic relief when Harry becomes annoyed with her and 'blows her up'. We can also see the fear Vernan and Petunia have of Harry (Dudley is too stupid and just keeps eating in front of the television) as Marge insults Harry's mother and father, and the lights begin to flicker/wind blow. They know something is coming. Here, Harry has also had enough and moves out of the house in a snit.""Goblet"" has no sequence with the Dursley's, so we assume that Harry has moved in with his Godfather, Sirius. (Hadn't read the book so I don't know if the Dursleys are there or not).In ""Phoenix"", Harry is back with the Dursleys. We don't know why. Interaction between Harry and the family is minimal other than Harry's rescue of Dudley and Uncle Vernan's gleeful announcement of 'Justice' when the message arrives from the Ministry about Harry's expulsion from school. This scene really needed more development in 'Phoenix'. It's like the director put it in just to move us to the scenes at the Ministry of Magic.Short of it all is that this installment was a disappointment to me in that I do not feel it measures up to the previous chapters. Too much was cut from the novel. This seems to have disappointed those who read the book, and for those of us who did not, it left us in the dark about a lot of events and scenes. And while some editing is necessary to keep the film from being too long, the cut sequences should not detract from the pace of the movie or introduce ambiguity. In OOTP they do exactly that.Yes, I would recommend this film as part of the ongoing saga, but not as a stand-alone. For someone just getting started with the Potter series, this is not the one to see.Luke-warm addition to an otherwise outstanding series.Grudgingly Recommended.~P~",3,Weakest HP film of the five

651441,A3C1N5QS5I0XFE,B00005JPI2,Peter T. Kupfer,"[4, 4]","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a good addition to the Harry Potter film library. I have a hard time watching the films after reading the book because I prefer a literal interpretation, but I suppose the books are little too long for that. The first movie was pretty literal, but it was also pretty short. The first part of the movie really seems to jump around. The screenwriter seems to have chosen random samples from the book to show. When they do show a scene from the book they are fairly literal but they make some often frustrating choices of what to cut and what to add that is not in the book.An example of this is when Harry and the advance guard fly from Privot Drive to headquarters. They fly close to the river's surface and almost hit and boat (meaning muggles would like see them) whereas in the book, Moody is adamant about flying high so as not to be seen. Also, when the students get off the train they are not in their robes whereas in the book it always a staple of the end of the train ride to put on their robes. Also, the statue in the Ministry of Magic didn't seem to match the description in the book with just one fountain in the middle. I think it had the same statues, but this seems like a simple touch that a set designer or film director would be able to correct. It was almost like the screenwriter didn't read the whole book series and only skimmed the 5th book.There are other examples of this idea, but these are some that stuck with me now. The movie spends a lot of time at the DA meetings which is fun and the film does a good job of showing Harry grow up and into his role as a leader. As I said, I found the rest of the time at Hogwart's jumpy and rushed. I get the feeling, as I did with the third and fourth movie, that if you hadn't read he book you wouldn't be able to follow the story. Maybe that is okay though given the audience.Hands down the best part of the movie is the time in the Department of Ministries. The sets are well done and the action is really exciting and captures the adventure of the novel. It is faced paced, gripping, and good ride. The final battle in the Ministry of Magic between Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry is very exciting, and in this case the few lines Harry adds I liked and I think illustrates why being good is better than being bad. Dumbledore's speech at the end leave a lot to be desired, but I guess they were trying to keep to a schedule.Acting wise, Alan Rickman (Snape), Jason Issacs (Lucious Malfoy), and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) all gave stellar performances as usually. You really want to loathe Malfoy in the film and he is very convincing in the DoM. Snape is detestable and lovable at the same time especially when he is challenging Harry during occlumency. Voldemort is very calm and confident and you really fear him throughout the movie. Helena Bonham Carter does a quality job as Bellatrix Lestrange portraying a truly horrible witch. Finally, even though you hate her, Imelda Staunton gives a true to the book performance portraying Dolores Umbridge.The score in the movie is very moving. The music during at the end of the battle with Voldemort is really puts a point on the moment and truly makes you feel Harry's pain.In end, if you like Harry Potter you should see this movies. It diverts from the book a lot, but if you know the story, you will have not trouble following it. There are several excellent performances given in the film and the movie making elements are all very well done.",4,Good complement to the novel,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,3510,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'good', 'addition', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'library', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'films', 'reading', 'book', 'prefer', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'suppose', 'books', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'literal', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'short', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'really', 'jump', 'around', 'screenwriter', 'have', 'chosen', 'random', 'samples', 'book', 'show', 'When', 'do', 'show', 'scene', 'book', 'are', 'fairly', 'literal', 'make', 'often', 'frustrating', 'choices', 'what', 'cut', 'what', 'add', 'not', 'book.An', 'example', 'when', 'Harry', 'advance', 'guard', 'fly', 'Privot', 'Drive', 'headquarters', 'fly', 'close', 'river', 'surface', 'almost', 'hit', 'boat', 'meaning', 'muggles', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'whereas', 'book', 'Moody', 'adamant', 'flying', 'high', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'Also', 'when', 'students', 'get', 'train', 'are', 'not', 'robes', 'whereas', 'book', 'always', 'staple', 'end', 'train', 'ride', 'put', 'robes', 'Also', 'statue', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'match', 'description', 'book', 'just', 'one', 'fountain', 'middle', 'think', 'had', 'same', 'statues', 'simple', 'touch', 'set', 'designer', 'film', 'director', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'correct', 'was', 'almost', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'whole', 'book', 'series', 'only', 'skimmed', '5th', 'book.There', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'idea', 'are', 'stuck', 'now', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'DA', 'meetings', 'fun', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'Harry', 'grow', 'up', 'role', 'leader', 'said', 'found', 'rest', 'time', 'Hogwart', 'jumpy', 'rushed', 'get', 'feeling', 'did', 'third', 'fourth', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'story', 'Maybe', 'okay', 'given', 'audience.Hands', 'down', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'time', 'Department', 'Ministries', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'really', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'novel', 'faced', 'paced', 'gripping', 'good', 'ride', 'final', 'battle', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'very', 'exciting', 'case', 'few', 'lines', 'Harry', 'liked', 'think', 'illustrates', 'why', 'being', 'good', 'better', 'being', 'bad', 'Dumbledore', 'speech', 'end', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'guess', 'were', 'trying', 'keep', 'schedule.Acting', 'wise', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'Jason', 'Issacs', 'Lucious', 'Malfoy', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Voldemort', 'gave', 'stellar', 'performances', 'usually', 'really', 'want', 'loathe', 'Malfoy', 'film', 'very', 'convincing', 'DoM', 'Snape', 'detestable', 'lovable', 'same', 'time', 'especially', 'when', 'challenging', 'Harry', 'occlumency', 'Voldemort', 'very', 'calm', 'confident', 'really', 'fear', 'movie', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'quality', 'job', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'portraying', 'truly', 'horrible', 'witch', 'Finally', 'even', 'hate', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'true', 'book', 'performance', 'portraying', 'Umbridge.The', 'score', 'movie', 'very', 'moving', 'music', 'end', 'battle', 'Voldemort', 'really', 'point', 'moment', 'truly', 'feel', 'Harry', 'pain.In', 'end', 'like', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'should', 'see', 'movies', 'book', 'lot', 'know', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'not', 'trouble', 'following', 'are', 'several', 'excellent', 'performances', 'given', 'film', 'movie', 'making', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651448,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00005JPI2,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[6, 6]","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest Potter film to date.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his fellow Hogwarts students continue to fight evil as well as hone their skills as wizards.  In his unrelenting attempt to avenge the death of his parents by the demonic Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who appears in and out of the film, Harry never gives up his untiring efforts.  For the premise of this film, Hogwarts's leadership is under scrutiny that involves accusations against Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and one of the new characters, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the annoying and sinister teacher who is after the coveted title as headmaster.The film is extremely long.  But as with the other four Potter films, the cinematography and special effects are exceptional.  The pyrotechnics are loud and shattering, especially the concluding scenes where Dumbledore battles it out with Voldemort, which resonates duel-like scenes from very well known sci-fi film, such as Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.Thus far, the storyline is complex and intense as the characters battle good and evil.  And another interesting observation is how Harry and his friends continue to grow before our eyes. Yet again, Harry experiences one of his first pubescent encounters with his ongoing romance with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and the two share an unavoidable intimate kiss under the mistletoe, which he describes somewhat immaturely to Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) as very wet; we also see the ever so delicate and sensitive Neville (Matthew Lewis) slowly mature with confidence.Harry and the Order of the Phoenix has fantasy and adventure that many Potter fans have grown accustomed to.

651451,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JPI2,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[82, 107]","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - the movie version - IS missing lots of content from its book counterpart. Also, the screenplay has wrought a lot of big changes on the book's content and chronology. If you're a book-to-film conversion purist, or a HP Book fanatic, this fact, before anything else, might well keep you from enjoying the movie to the full. That said, if you can go into this one with an open mind (and I had to force myself to do just that, HP Book fanatic that I am), you might find yourself enjoying this movie version of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" for what it is - a fast-paced, well-made, beautiful-looking ride through Harry & co's fifth year at Hogwarts.The good: Acting-wise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint keep improving, and this movie is no exception, they're very, very good in their roles. Michael Gambon is still an excellent Dumbledore and Alan RIckman's Snape is absolutely brilliant during the Occlumency scenes. It's nice to see the Dursleys back again at the start of the movie, and Harry Melling is excellent - loathsome and bullying - in his short turn as Dudley. Katie Leung is a great Cho - certainly we'll see more of her as an actress once the HP series is finished - and the rest of the cast, the heavyweights like Dame Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, David Thewlis and so forth - don't really get enough screen time to show off, but are perfectly plausible all the same.The newcomers are fantastic, too - Evanna Lynch makes for a great, believable Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham-Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange is absolutely brilliant (let's hope she gets more screen-time in the ""Half Blood Prince"" adaptation!).But it's Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge who absolutely steals the show - she's brilliant. Turning on a dime from saccharine-sweet condescension to malevolent power-hungry bully, I can't imagine J.K. Rowling's original character being brought more wholly and satisfyingly to life. Okay, she may not look as much like a Toad as the book's character, but in the face of Staunton's excellent performance and faithful characterisation, that becomes immaterial. She's the best element of what must be the strongest set of performances in a HP movie to date.Direction by David Yates is superlative - this is a suitably adult-looking movie to reflect the changes in the HP characters' personalities and situations - and from the tense and frightening opening scenes, to the breathtaking and exciting close, Yates' talent and apparent love of this story is very palpable. Harry's ""dream"" sequences when Voldemort is invading his mind are brilliant - lovely to watch and very interesting from an artistic point of view - and the special effects, particularly during the closing scenes, are indescribably good.Production design by Stuart Craig is the absolute best in a HP movie since the original, and every element of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", Umbridge's non-toadishness notwithstanding, is nigh-on perfect. The initial scenes at the Ministry for Magic made me sit up and go ""wow!"", the death eaters and dementors are more menacing than before, there's one panoramic shot of Azkaban that makes that place absolutely terrifying in its believability. No. 12 Grimmauld Place doesn't get enough air time but what's there is gold, and the character of Grawp is a lot more human and fitting than I had imagined him from the book.The bad elements of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" all stem from the fact that this film's running time really is too short to capture every great aspect of the original novel, and the missing scenes will, for fans of the book, cause some distress. Also, the Malfoy-Crabbe-Goyle trinity isn't particularly worthwhile or believable, and there are a couple of montage scenes, particularly involving the Educational Decrees and Argus Filch, that feel too comic, too flimsy, to belong properly to the movie. Also, there are some overconvenient events (such as Cho and the Veritaserum, and Arthur Weasley's recovery) that could have used some rewriting to get them up to par with the rest of the screenplay.But that said, as a movie in its own right, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is across-the-board the most satisfying HP movie to date. Best performances, outstanding direction, excellent effects and some spectacular set and costume design have restored my faith in this series, and I for one left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Definitely a must-see for fans: newcomers; watch the others before this one - it's vital to understand what's going on. As a short adaptation of a VERY long book it works on many levels, as an entry to the movie series it's outstanding, and as a film in its own right, it's a thrilling, well-made fantasy tale that will certainly satisfy you if you don't mind the cuts.Highly ecommended!!",4,"Outstanding, best HP movie to date.",1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,4908,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'movie',

651455,A1LE79HKL5G9C6,B00005JPI2,Rob6965,"[1, 2]","If one thing will be remembered about the Harry Potter film series, it is that the films accurately portray maturity and age. As the beloved characters get older, the films get darker. Unfortunately, maturity is not always a good thing, and Harry Potter fans will wonder what happened to the whimsical, nonchalant days of old, when magic was the focus. Here, the plot is too confusing, and the characters less enjoyable than the previous films. Still, it is rather interesting to observe Harry put all that magical training into action.Order of the Phoenix puts Harry at odds with the Ministry of Magic, as shown in an early scene when Harry and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors in their town. Harry uses the Patronus Charm to get rid of them, and so must face a full criminal hearing to determine whether or not he will be expelled from Hogwarts. When Harry tries unsuccessfully to convince the Ministry of the Dementors, Dumbledore comes to his aid, the first of many times Harry and Dumbledore will face off against Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry.In this film, Lord Voldemort finally becomes a full-fledged villain, haunting Harry in his dreams and gathering armies to his command. This, of course, does not bode well for the rest of the series, as the dark tone established in OOTP will inevitably continue.To the plot: Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), after witnessing the return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), finds that he has become a ""persona non grata"" in the Wizarding world. The Ministry has convinced the citizens that he and Dumbledore are scheming to overthrow the Ministry, and that Voldemort is not back. Meanwhile, the deliciously evil Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is tormenting Harry at school as the High Inquisitor, the representative of the Ministry's interference at Hogwarts.Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) have all the same characteristics as their counterparts in the previous films, but something seems to have been lost along the way. No longer do we get to enjoy watching the mischief caused by the trio (aside from some comic relief from Ron's twin brothers Fred and George), but they seem to talk of darkness and death the whole time, as if the writers really want us to know how serious the situation is, to convince us that the ""times are changing"", or rather going back to how they were when Voldemort ruled earlier, a recurring theme of the film.A good side to the movie is the often change in setting. To be honest, the constant scenes within Hogwarts Castle were getting tiresome, and it is nice to see London, and the Ministry of Magic, and Harry back at old Number 4, Privet Drive. Also, the production and cinematography are nicely done, with exciting action sequences and interesting CGI characters. Speaking of the characters, there are some good additions here, notably Helena Bonham Carter as Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, who does a good job as the maniacal murderer.So, I think the Harry Potter series has gotten too dark and too mature for its own good. Still, I suppose it would have been boring to watch the cute little owls flying around all the time, so I have to marginally recommend it.",3,Too Dark for Its Own Good,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,3175,"['one', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series', 'films', 'accurately', 'portray', 'maturity', 'age', 'beloved', 'characters', 'get', 'older', 'films', 'get', 'darker', 'Unfortunately', 'maturity', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'will', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'whimsical', 'nonchalant', 'days', 'old', 'when', 'magic', 'was', 'focus', 'Here', 'plot', 'too', 'confusing', 'characters', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'previous', 'films', 'Still', 'rather', 'interesting', 'observe', 'Harry', 'put', 'magical', 'training', 'action.Order', 'Phoenix', 'Harry', 'odds', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'shown', 'early', 'scene', 'when', 'Harry', 'cousin', 'Dudley', 'are', 'attacked', 'Dementors', 'town', 'Harry', 'Patronus', 'Charm', 'get', 'rid', 'so', 'must', 'face', 'full', 'criminal', 'hearing', 'determine', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'expelled', 'Hogwarts', 'When', 'Harry', 'unsuccessfully', 'convince', 'Ministry', 'Dementors', 'Dumbledore', 'aid', 'first', 'many', 'times', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'will', 'face', 'off', 'Cornelius', 'Fudge', 'Ministry.In', 'film', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'finally', 'full-fledged', 'villain', 'haunting', 'Harry', 'dreams', 'gathering', 'armies', 'command', 'course', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'rest', 'series', 'dark', 'tone', 'established', 'OOTP', 'will', 'inevitably', 'continue.To', 'plot', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'witnessing', 'return', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'become', 'persona', 'non', 'grata', 'Wizarding', 'world', 'Ministry', 'convinced', 'citizens', 'Dumbledore', 'are', 'scheming', 'overthrow', 'Ministry', 'Voldemort', 'not', 'back', 'Meanwhile', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'tormenting', 'Harry', 'school', 'High', 'Inquisitor', 'representative', 'Ministry', 'interference', 'Hogwarts.Harry', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'have', 'same', 'characteristics', 'counterparts', 'previous', 'films', 'something', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'way', 'No', 'longer', 'do', 'get', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'mischief', 'caused', 'trio', 'comic', 'relief', 'Ron', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Fred', 'George', 'seem', 'talk', 'darkness', 'death', 'whole', 'time', 'writers', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'serious', 'situation', 'convince', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'rather', 'going', 'back', 'how', 'were', 'when', 'Voldemort', 'ruled', 'earlier', 'recurring', 'theme', 'film.A', 'good', 'side', 'movie', 'often', 'change', 'setting', 'be', 'honest', 'constant', 'scenes', 'Hogwarts', 'Castle', 'were', 'getting', 'tiresome', 'nice', 'see', 'London', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Harry', 'back', 'old', 'Number', '4', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'Also', 'production', 'cinematography', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'interesting', 'CGI', 'characters', 'Speaking', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'additions', 'here', 'notably', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Death', 'Eater', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'maniacal', 'murderer.So', 'think', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'gotten', 'too', 'dark', 'too', 'mature', 'own', 'good', 'Still', 'suppose', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'watch', 'cute', 'little', 'owls', 'flying', 'time', 'so', 'have', 'marginally', 'recommend']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the ""lax"" standards at the academy and, in so doing, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has most of what any installment in the series needs to be a success:  strong performances, dazzling special effects, and generous helpings of spells and magic.  Yet, there seems to be something missing in this episode that prevents it from soaring into that world of enchantment familiar to us from those earlier films.  For one thing, too many of the likable secondary characters - Ronald, Hermione, Hagrid etc. - take a back seat to Umbridge, who gets way more time on screen than the interest generated by the character warrants (even though Imelda Staunton is just fine in the role).  Or perhaps it's that the movie lacks the tremendously exciting action set pieces that distinguished some of the earlier editions.  And why, come to think of it, does the cinematography in a fantasy film have to be so drab, colorless and dreary?It's admirable that both the filmmakers and the original author are willing to go darker and deeper in exploring the psyche of Harry now that he`s become quite a bit older, but depth of theme really doesn't matter all that much if the magic of the series itself gets lost in the process (Michael Goldenberg has replaced Steve Kloves in the writing department and David Yates has taken over as director).Daniel Radcliffe still makes for a tremendously appealing hero, but one senses that the perhaps inevitable fatigue factor may finally be settling into this series.

David Yates had it all, a stellar cast, plenty of  base material from JK Rowling's second longest book, and special effects at his disposal and what did he and Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter taking the place of HP veteran Steve Kloves) do? They trimmed away everything interesting whatsoever about the book and left the remaining awkward shards jumbled together. For God's sake, you've got Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson sitting around doing nothing. I kept shouting at the screen ""Use them! Use them!"" How is it that one of the longest novels is turned into the shortest movie? Now, I wasn't a big fan of the 3rd or 5th books in the HP series but I was hoping that Yates, like Cuaron, would go past the source material and make the film into a triumphant masterpiece. He didn't. The payoff of the film would have to be Imelda Staunton's dead-on portrayl of the most evil Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher yet, Occlumency Lessons with Snape, of course, the trip to the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's duel with Dumbledore. But, we all knew that those would be great. It would have been nice if the film didn't act that all it needed was a whiff-bang end and the audience would forget the shlocky job up until then. The dementors here have NONE of the atmosphere that Cuaron's did, no screaming in Harry's ears, etc, what about the Quibbler Interview, Ron's Quidditch debut, Ron and Hermione becoming prefects, the disappointment is crushing. I don't know whose fault it is, David Yates or Michael Goldenberg. I only hope that the David Yates crew (thankfully this time with Steve Kloves) will not screw up the 6th movie.

Rowling is an outstanding author and has created what in my opinion is a masterpiece.  I have now read all of the books and have seen all of the movies -- and I have enjoyed every one.  This latest film was a huge challenge to the screenwriter and director due to the sheer size of the book.  In this film we see Harry, Hermione, and Ron as near adults -- ready to graduate and certainly with much greater maturity and mastery of magic.  Certainly each movie gets darker and darker as do the books as Harry and friends encounter the growing evil of Valdemort.This was not the best of the series of films but it keeps the story moving.  The director has clearly elected to capture the essence of the story rather than to follow all of the details, which would have made an impossibly long movie.  However, for those who have never read the book, the movie moves along well.  For those who have read the book, they can fill in the details without having to see them on the screen.  The result is many of the major characters have relatively small parts in this movie.  In fact outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione virtually all of the characters have small parts -- still the story moves along very well and you don't see the time pass.  I really liked the movie, I highly recommend it, it is probably not a movie for very young children because it shows the characters in some dangerous and threatening situations.

These killjoys need to take to heart Anton Ego's soliloquy on criticism at the end of Pixar's ""Ratatouille"" and remember how hard it is to create something, but how easy it is to criticize.This is by far the most difficult adaptation of Ms. Rowling's beloved series of novels.  ""Phoenix"" is the darkest and longest of the first five novels, easily containing enough material for two films if one took the same stance as Chris Columbus and threw everything from the books into the movies.  Yates didn't have that luxury, and so drastic cuts were needed.  For devoted fans, this movie likely feels like ""highlights from Harry"" instead of a true movie, but such is the fate of most film adaptations.The question is, how good an adaptation is it?  For the most part, the movie triumphs brilliantly.  Harry is traumatized by Voldemort's murder of Cedric Diggory at the close of ""Goblet of Fire,"" but it seems that only (some) Griffindors and Albus Dumbledore are willing to admit that Voldemort is back.  The Ministry of Magic sticks its head in the sand and questions both Harry's and Dumbledore's credibility, leading to a dark analysis in the story of media manipulation and government paranoia.Not for nothing is there not a single mention of Quidditch in the entire movie.The acting is all top-notch, particularly from the three kids we've seen grow up before our eyes in this series.  The cast of experienced British actors is at their typical excellent best.  But the movie is practically stolen from our favorite heroes by a villain, and not Lord Voldemort.  Insead, Imelda Staunton swipes the movie with her evil schoolmarm, Dolores Umbridge.  This lady says more about evil with a polite 'hem-hem' and a glassy stare than any number of foam-mouthed rants by lesser actors - she is a riveting, horrible pleasure to watch.Special kudos also go out to newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Harry's spacy classmate.  This moon-unit's a charmer.The DVD is also chock-full of the usual DVD extras we've grown to appreciate from the Harry Potter series.  While nothing rises to the level of Peter Jackson's four-DVD sets for the Lord of the Rings movies, these are excellent additions for the kiddies (lots of games and whatnot).A must-see for any fan of Harry Potter, although die-hard fans will likely grab their dog-eared copy of ""Phoenix"" to see what exactly Yates left out.",4,"Dark ""Phoenix"" captures essence of fifth Harry Potter story",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2528,"['Many', 'arm-chair', 'quarterbacks', 'have', 'slammed', 'David', 'Yates', 'turn', 'helm', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'killjoys', 'need', 'take', 'heart', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'soliloquy', 'criticism', 'end', 'Pixar', 'Ratatouille', 'remember', 'how', 'hard', 'create', 'something', 'how', 'easy', 'criticize.This', 'far', 'most', 'difficult', 'adaptation', 'Ms.', 'Rowling', 'beloved', 'series', 'novels', 'Phoenix', 'darkest', 'longest', 'first', 'five', 'novels', 'easily', 'containing', 'enough', 'material', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'took', 'same', 'stance', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'threw', 'everything', 'books', 'movies', 'Yates', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'so', 'drastic', 'cuts', 'were', 'needed', 'devoted', 'fans', 'movie', 'likely', 'feels', 'highlights', 'Harry', 'instead', 'true', 'movie', 'such', 'fate', 'most', 'film', 'adaptations.The', 'question', 'how', 'good', 'adaptation', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'triumphs', 'brilliantly', 'Harry', 'traumatized', 'Voldemort', 'murder', 'Cedric', 'Diggory', 'close', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'only', 'Griffindors', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'are', 'willing', 'admit', 'Voldemort', 'back', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'head', 'sand', 'questions', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'credibility', 'leading', 'dark', 'analysis', 'story', 'media', 'manipulation', 'government', 'paranoia.Not', 'nothing', 'there', 'not', 'single', 'mention', 'Quidditch', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'particularly', 'three', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'grow', 'up', 'eyes', 'series', 'cast', 'experienced', 'British', 'actors', 'typical', 'excellent', 'best', 'movie', 'practically', 'stolen', 'favorite', 'heroes', 'villain', 'not', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Insead', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'movie', 'evil', 'schoolmarm', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'lady', 'more', 'evil', 'polite', ""'hem-hem"", 'glassy', 'stare', 'number', 'foam-mouthed', 'rants', 'lesser', 'actors', 'riveting', 'horrible', 'pleasure', 'watch.Special', 'kudos', 'also', 'go', 'out', 'newcomer', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Harry', 'spacy', 'classmate', 'moon-unit', 'charmer.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'chock-full', 'usual', 'DVD', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'appreciate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'nothing', 'level', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'four-DVD', 'sets', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'additions', 'kiddies', 'lots', 'games', 'whatnot', 'must-see', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'grab', 'dog-eared', 'copy', 'Phoenix', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'left', 'out']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651478,A2OCAHFWBWB6T6,B00005JPI2,Shredd,"[5, 9]","Let me just say that I have not read any of the other reviews so if I duplicate, forgive me. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS WILL BE CONTAINED HEREIN*For a massive Harry Potter fan as myself, to have to give this movie a bad review is akin to having Snape for Potions (you get that sick feeling in your stomach), but it was truly awful. Since I've read the series several times it's obviously hard to forget how it was in the book. However, when watching the movies I try to distance myself from that for the reason in the title of the review. This particular movie is not Harry Potter. It is Harry Potter-esque. The characters have the same names and the movie very vaguely resembles the book but if you are a Harry purist you will need to STAY FAR AWAY from this movie. If you like well written plots and a decent viewing flow, you will need to avoid this movie.This movie made no sense. I was completely relieved that I didn't buy it but only borrowed from a friend. I found it to be a bit boring and my attention kept slipping away. I felt the acting to be terribly uninspired. Case in point is Arabella Figg. When the dementors attack Harry and Dudley and he's trying to hide his wand so she doesn't see it, she comes up to him all calm and says gently, ""Don't put your wand away. They may come back."" I mean, this is DEMENTORS....creatures that suck out your soul through your FACE! Wouldn't you be JUST a litte panicked???? especially if they show up in your home town MILES away from Azkaban...even more especially because you are a Squib with no wand??? Wouldn't you be a little flustered even, not all cool and calm as if you've just had a terrific relaxing massage at a day spa?It was also rather confusing because the scenes seemed to be so choppy, and I found myself having to rewind the DVD several times in order to catch some scenes. Blink, and you appear to miss a pivotal moment. eg. the thestrals. I figure the director thought he'd got to put in a brilliant flying scene so he had to leave the thestrals in. Fair enough but we only see them twice in the movie. The first is when Harry asks what's pulling the carriages and Hermione says that they just pull themselves like always. She looks at him all worried like he's lost his marbles. Luna tells him that he's not crazy. She sees them too. Thestrals are never mentioned again until Luna suggests that they fly to the Ministry of Magic. Um...wouldn't you protest (especially if you were RON!) if you had to get on a creature only visible to Luna and Harry? Not a word of this in the movie. Everyone is happily flying on invisible thestrals. Since we barely see Hagrid in this movie, we would've missed his Care of Magical Creatures lesson when he talks about the thestrals etc.So, BAM! they're talking about getting to the Ministry, then BAM! they're on thestrals, then BAM! they're running to the Ministry, then BAM! they're in the Dept. of Mysteries. Phew! All this happens in about two minutes! This was one of the sections I had to rewind. Silly me. I blinked. It would've been faster and simpler to have them apparate. Forget the Decree for the Restiction of Underage Magic (or the fact they haven't learnt to apparate yet). What's the point of trying to stick to SOME facts hard and fast when most of the movie doesn't conform to the book anyway?Some scenes were pointless and added nothing to the movie - Grawp and the centaurs in the forest with Umbridge..what was that about? Hagrid could've just said that he brought his brother back. Sirius showing Harry the family tree...huh? why? I would rather have seen Mrs. Black's picture screaming foul things. The thestral references could've been cut. What can I say in the director's defence? To be fair, it's a rather LONG book to condense. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you'll be disappointed by the movie; and in order to GET the movie (or at least some parts of it) you'll have to have read the book.Michael Gambon is STILL a terrible Albus Dumbledore although he's gotten better since his first appearance (R.I.P Richard Harris...he had it down pat) - Dumbledore is a gentle, unassuming character that very rarely raises his voice to get what he wants. He uses words and logic as his weapons mostly. Michael still seems to think he's theatre acting and although there is much less flinging himself about and shouting, he is still acting too ""big"" in this role.The biggest surprise for me was the casting of Luna (Evanna Lynch). She is rather brilliant in this role. Very airy fairy and sweet. Could've been a little more oddball but altogether the perfect Luna. She's the saving grace of this movie. I only wish we saw her more.It goes without saying that I've been disappointed since Chris Columbus left this project because he's been truest to the books but even if this movie wasn't true to the book, it still isn't very good. I was quite surprised to see hundreds of people give it 4 and 5 stars.

The former films have omitted details; this one changed the plot pretty significantly. I can accept a film in a different universe than its book, but this is unsettlingly different. Cho was wronged by the screenwriters, much as I can't stand the character. There is no real explanation for the twins sudden dramatic departure. The relevance of Harry's insight into Snape is without anchor. Lucius' role is... well out of proportion (though easy on the eyes). Neville's parents are glossed over, as is the sharing of his birthday with Harry. Sirius' madness is overlooked, thus the later misnomer has little impact. Sirius is aveda'ed. It ended on a way too hopeful note. I am very disappointed with the way Sirius' death was handled. It was anticlimactic. It was too subtle. Part of that was Helena Bonham Carter seeming quite blas&eacute; in her role. She didn't seem like she really wanted to be there so I wasn't really vested in her wrongly cast spell against Sirius. I do feel the silence following Sirius' parting worked against the scene, not for it, creating levity rather than tragic density of emotion. All of the core actors have grown in their roles except Emma. She is mostly heaving chest and eyebrows in this film. She is a beauty, though, and certainly dedicated. Everyone else, though, was wonderful. Dan has come a long way in his acting ability. In this film he comes into his own as an actor. Rup rules, as usual. Draco was under used. This is the first time I thought any of the young ones looked older than their character's ages, specifically Dan and the twins. Evanna Lynch is wonderful. Visually the film is stunning. It is non stop movement, physically and emotionally. The chemistry between Daniel and Gary is spot on. They are very physically comfortable with each other and the little aside touches were in that way more telling than the many embraces that we were to assimilate as ""family."" There wasn't as much tight writing in this one. Clearly the emphasis had refocused to deepening the emotional range of the characters and actors. I love Rickman and Isaacs.My favorite moment of the film (apart from the ""LOOK AT ME"" bit) was when Sirius tells harry that when this is all over they will be a proper family, then closes the door on his own family tree. So symbolic, that.The extras on this DVD were not as unwieldy to navigate as with the other DVD releases, but they still would be entertaining to little ones.

If you have not seen Harry Potter #'s 1-4 then I suggest that you should start there and work your way up to Harry potter and the order of the phoenix.Now here is some detail about the movie Harry's cousin is always picking on him until they are attacked by dominators and Harry knows how to beat them. Later he gets picked up by an old Hogwarts professor mad eye moony and some other people from the order of the phoenix pick him up. Then after they got off the train at Hogwarts Draco, say's that he sees a cell in Azkaban and Harry wants to kill him but Ron was holding him back from attacking Draco Malfoy. I think that everyone needs to at see the first to movies of Harry Potter, and the first two books. Now a little more about the movie Harry Potter has to take occlumency to stop from seeing visions about Voldemort and a snake every time he goes to sleep and then wakes up all sweaty and exalted. One night he had a dream that Voldemort's snake attacking Arnold Weasly and he was taken to the headmaster by Ron and McGonagall and then the Weasly kids were sent home early before Christmas break because there dad is in very bad condition because whatever they do it just gets dissolved because of the snake venom. The stitches kept dissolving like they were not there because the venom.

There will always be variation from page to screen.  In terms of the film itself, it's really the most entertaining of the 6 that have so far been released.  The younger actors seem to find their stride a little more in this film.  They are all becoming a little more ambiguous, and therefore more interesting.  I also find this story to have been the best of the books because the Severus Snape character becomes so controversial, and he was always my favorite, and when played by my favorite actor, Alan Rickman, the universe makes sense for one shining moment.Regarding the DVD release:  If you haven't heard, Ultimate Editions of the Harry Potter films are going to be released beginning with the first two films on 8 December.  These movies are longer and have the deleted scenes added back into the films themselves - much like the versions that crop up on ABC Family.

651488,AG7SA3TYL1AQ3,B00005JPI2,sundance,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by saying that I am one of millions that agree too much was cut from the book when the movie was made. To me, it's completely idiotic to take the longest book of the series and make it into the shortest of all 8 movies. Especially considering how horrible a job they did with HP & the Deathly Hallows Pt 1 & 2. And they spilt the movie into two parts! There was so much they could've done with this movie. One of the long standing arguements has always been there's no way they could have put out a 3-4 hour movie. BS! Show me one HP fan who would not have willingly sat through a four hour HP movie! LOL. That said, here are my vies on the movie. I've broken them down into different sections.CASTING: Overall, I've almost always agreed with the casting for the characters for the movies, not just this one. Umbridge/Imelda Staunton= Brilliant! I actually had to remind myself it was the character I detested and not Staunton herself, she played the character so well. Luna/Evanna Lynch= One of the best casting choices in all eight movies! Lynch IS Luna! Sirius/Gary Oldman= I'll just come out and say it. Everything Gary is involved in turns to gold. Actors like Gary Oldman only come around once in a lifetime. Snape/Alan Rickman= The reason this man is a magnificent actor, one of the best in history, in the world, is because he's a camilleon. No two roles he plays are the same. Rickman drowned himself in the character of Snape. So well, he played it perfectly. Some of my other choices for great casting were: McGonagall/Maggie Smith, Dumbledore/Michael Gambon, Trelawney/Emma Tompson, Voldemort/Ralph Fiennes, Kingsley/George Harris, Lucius Malfoy/Jason Isaacs, Hagrid/Robbie Coltrane. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, perhaps the best casting choice, Bellatrix Lestrange/Helena Bonham Carter! She was outstanding! As for the poor choices, or the ones that I think could have been played a bit differently, not necessarily a different actor. Harry's parents, the Dursley Family, Tonks and Remus, Fred and George Weasley, Draco, Neville and Molly Weasley.CG: Let's face it, the jury is not out on this. All the animated scenes, such as the Ministry of Magic with the globes, the flying scenes, Grawp, when the centaurs run off with Unbridge, exc.CUT SCENES: Lets face it, they butchered the book. This was a book where everything changed, a pivotal book. The movie was in essence a slap in the face to all HP fans. The cutting of certain scenes were very poor choices. Such as: Hermione's attempt at freeing all house elves, quidditch, the St Mungo's scenes, the Occlumency scenes between Snape and Harry, everything that is Grimmauld Place and the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore's escape when accused by Fudge and Umbridge of forming the D.A., and so on. But the worst of all, is the simple dismissing of Sirius. In the book it's a truly heartbreaking scene. But in the movie? His death barely gets acknowledged, you can't hear Harry's anguished screaming, using the Avada Kedavra curse on Bellatrix, Lupin's attempt at calming Harry.In all, the book got a 6 out of 5 stars.

I also would have liked to have seen Neville visiting his parents at St. Mungo's though that might have been too poignant of a scene for this all ready quite dark movie and the Longbottoms's situation is discussed.  One of the greatest pleasures of this series is seeing the child actors  growing up from kids to teenagers and all the major players both teens and adults  do a great job.  Imelda Staunton is comically loathsome as Dolores Umbridge and I think we've all known her slightly less exaggerated counterparts in the muggle world.

I for one say director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have done an admirable job in delivering the next satisfying installment of the Harry Potter saga.Considering the directorial revolving door since Chris Columbus' departure after the second filmHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I'm impressed at the consistency and coherency represented by the films to date.  Five movies in, I've stopped obsessing about what was left out from the books, and have mostly agreed with what plot elements were left in.  The one exception in this fifth movie was the total absence of Quidditch, which I've always viewed as something that helps tie all the books together.Visually the film was yet another stunning experience.  By now the magical effects are so well integrated that it's easy to just accept them and not be distracted from the story.  Fred and George's grand exit from Hogwart's was all I expected, and just when I was afraid their magical novelties were no more interesting than a Muggle fireworks display, they kicked it up a notch and came through with an outlandish finale.We also got our first look at the Ministry of Magic, again well executed with appropriately varied costumes and magnificent sets.

651499,A3T2G352GLIEZZ,B00005JPI2,"The Legend Of Megadon ""MEGAN""","[1, 1]","As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie as much as the book.",4,Don't expect the movie to be like the book,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1797,"['fan', 'book', 'movies', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'OoTP', 'was', 'long', 'book', 'more', 'lighter', 'funnier', 'better', 'story', 'lines', 'could', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'making', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'Many', 'details', 'were', 'changed', 'such', 'Sirus', 'calling', 'Harry', 'James', 'Cho', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'ratted', 'out', 'DA', 'Luna', 'Harry', 'meeting', 'woods', 'discuss', 'Thestrals', 'Harry', 'drawing', 'wand', 'front', 'Dudley', 'friends', 'so', 'Professor', 'Trewlany', 'who', 'delight', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'disappointing', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'disappointing', 'was', 'fact', 'Sirius', 'was', 'barely', 'film', 'Luna', 'had', 'barely', 'screen', 'time', 'Weasly', 'Luna', 'made', 'book', 'more', 'interesting', 'cutting', 'down', 'Luna', 'story', 'line', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'tense', 'Im', 'am', 'non', 'plussed', 'point', 'thought', 'first', '2', 'films', 'stayed', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'had', 'pun', 'magic', 'movie', 'great', 'loved', 'fact', 'third', 'forth', 'films', 'were', 'darker', 'certain', 'details', 'were', 'changed', 'omitted', 'much', 'fifth', 'film', 'acting', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'different', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'try', 'acting', 'flowed', 'made', 'more', 'natural', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'casting', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'then', 'actress', 'had', 'such', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'made', 'seem', 'meek', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'trio', 'previous', 'films', 'Hermoine', 'Ron', 'are', 'important', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'film', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'new', 'Dumbledore', 'actor', 'Dumbledore', 'seem', 'tense', 'uncaring', 'harsh', 'times', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'loved', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'love', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'book']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651501,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00005JPI2,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","For fans of Harry Potter, reviews are beside the point.  They will adore ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth film in the lucrative Warner Brothers franchise based on the enormously popular J.K. Rowling books.  But for average, non-Potter addicted movie goers, this installment will have a strong sense of deja vu.The current film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) concluding a summer among the Muggles.  As his cousin and his cousin's sneering posse taunt Harry and try to provoke a fight, they are set upon by a couple of Dementors.  Harry uses magic to vanquish them, a feat that lands him in hot water at Hogwarts.  He has used magic in the presence of a Muggle.  Put on trial, Harry is exonerated only by the intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).The theme of the film is established in this opening sequence:  The potential for good and evil exists in everyone.  The path to either is fraught with consequences.  The person you become rests with the choices you make.Harry and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) discover changes at Hogwarts that are detrimental and destructive, and must covertly develop their powers to combat them.  The fascistic Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) has been sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to fix everything that's wrong.  She installs a new, useless curriculum that contains no means for the student wizards to defend themselves against threats from the Dementors and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).Unlike earlier Potter films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" devotes surprisingly little screen time to the Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship.  In fact, Ron and Hermione are more like supporting than main characters.  Director David Yates and screenwriter Andrew S. Walsh have streamlined the novel to avoid an overly long running time, but the movie suffers in the details, some visuals, subplots (especially of Ron), and character development.Radcliffe is lankier and with more of a brooding quality than in previous Potter films, and his acting has matured.  He keeps his Harry grounded, even though a world of fantasy is the film's milieu.  His ability to make Harry a young Everyman is a key element in the movie series' success.  Radcliffe gives Harry a darker coloring this time so that he becomes less the fun-loving kid, amazed and thrilled at every new experience.  As an almost-adult, he sees real danger in the world around him.  Rather than leaving these dangers to the adults to reckon with, he is at the fore in confronting them himself.  His sense of responsibility to a greater good is being tested in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" and this growth of character draws us in.Next to Radcliffe, Ms. Staunton has the most central role in ""Order of the Phoenix.""  Her Dolores Umbridge is every child's nightmare of the authoritarian figure from hell.  Self-righteous, power-hungry, toadying to her superiors, nit picking and petty, she has been armed with carte blanche from on high to destroy all independent thinking and competence at the school.  Dressed in assorted suits of flamingo pink hues and chirping with ominous cheer, she is everywhere, sticking her nose in corners, taking notes on teachers' performance and evaluating the school's efficiency as one might check on a factory's assembly line output.  Ms. Staunton, nominated for her moving performance as ""Vera Drake,"" gives a broad, over-the-top performance that sometimes renders her Umbridge a bit cartoonish, but it is nonetheless fun to watch this veteran chow down on the scenery.Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, becomes Harry's ally in battling the forces of evil and comes off as a sort of young Ben Kenobi as he mentors and fights beside Harry.  Ralph Fiennes, in horrid make-up and prosthetics, is unrecognizable as Voldemort, but succeeds in infusing him with both stature and menace.  Fiennes' screen time is brief, but his Voldemort commands every scene he's in.Special effects are present in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" of course, but they're not as frequent or impressive as in the earlier Potter films.  When we do have an effects sequence, it is welcome, and usually fits well into the unfolding story.  There is a sense of wonder, for instance, when the young wizards secretly practice their spells and apparition-like animals dart hither and yon.  There is also a wonderful sequence of winged creatures transporting Harry and his friends over the countryside, and one of the mysterious, shadowy centaurs grouped menacingly in the dark of the woods.The Catch-22 of the Harry Potter movies is the belief that if not all of the book's sequences are included in the movie, loyal fans will rise up in protest.  On the other hand, if every sequence is included, the movie becomes a three-hour exercise in bladder control.Director Yates understands this dilemma and has gone the route of a tight running time, though at 138 minutes, it could still stand some trimming.  I have always felt that a movie should stand on its own and not depend on every viewer knowing every plot turn or slavishly including every sequence.  No movie can provide the detail that a book can, nor do movies have the time to do it.""Order of the Phoenix"" comes off as a less-than-stellar adaptation of the Rowling book.",2,A Brooding Harry

651502,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPI2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","Harry Potter nirvana this summer, the film based on the fifth book has just been released and the seventh and last (?) book has just been published. I have yet to finish the book, but I have seen ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".The fifth book in the series; ""Order of the Phoenix"" is not my favorite entry by author Rowling. Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to downplay many of the elements that made the book slightly unpleasant and put more focus on the characters. ""Phoenix"" is the longest book and the shortest film, so far, so some elements have been removed completely, for good and bad. But the increased dramatic skills of the three leads, fantastic set design and special effects and a supporting cast of every British character actor ever to appear in film, combine to make this a most enjoyable installment in the film series.My main problem with the book was Harry was portrayed as too typical a teenager. Yes, he was at that age, so show a little of it, but Harry is supposed to be above such things. He fought with Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione, and this went on and on. Worse, he ignored the advice and instructions of his friends, making him seem a little dumb.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is spending another summer with the Dursleys (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their nincompoop son, Dudley (Harry Melling). Sitting on a swing, trying to avoid the heat, Dudley comes up with two friends and tries to pick a fight. The weather turns and Dudley and Harry run into an underground tunnel to escape the downpour. Two aurors immediately descend and attack Harry and Dudley. Harry quickly uses his wand and fights them off. Before you know it, he is called before the Ministry of Magic to answer the charge of using magic in front of Muggles. Mad Eye Mooney (Brendan Gleeson) and other members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive to take Harry to their secret headquarters. There, he spots Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his godfather, and the rest of his faithful friends and supporters. He is a bit petulant about Ron and Hermione's lack of communication, but softens up when he hears they were ordered by Dumbledore to remain silent. The next morning, at his hearing, Harry is surprised to see Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) appear in his defense. The matter is quickly settled, but Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to appoint Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton, ""Vera Drake"") as the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Upon their arrival, Harry, Ron and Hermione are amazed to learn they will be learning no practical magic, just theory; no one seems to believe Lord Voldemort has returned, so they form a study group of their own, under Harry's tutelage. But will Professor Umbridge, now appointed a sort of Hogwarts High Inquisitor, be able to find out their plans. Will Professor Snipe (Alan Rickman) be able to help Harry defend himself against He Who Must Not Be Named (Ralph Fiennes)?Directed by David Yates (HBO's ""The Girl in the Caf&eacute;"", lots of British television) and written by Michael Goldenberg (""Peter Pan"", ""Contact""), ""Order of the Phoenix"" moves at a fast clip, combining nice tongue in cheek humor with good, believable moments of the kids taking matters into their own hands. Add some great set design and some amazing special effects and you have a really enjoyable movie.""Harry Potter 5"" is the darkest film to date, which is appropriate because the books get progressively darker as the stakes become higher for Harry and his friends and associates. As the danger increases, people die and Harry has to live with that; in ""Phoenix"", he still deals with the death of Cedric during the Tri Wizard Finals in ""Goblet of Fire"". But as Harry is growing up, he also has other things to contend with, mainly puberty, and he can't seem to keep his eyes off Cho Chang (Katie Leung), who is also grieving over the death of Cedric, her boyfriend. Will Harry and Cho give in to their temptations and enjoy a little kiss?Hogwart's Professor of Defense of the Dark Arts has proven to be a difficult position for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to staff. Each year, the professor runs into problems and leaves the position. This allows Rowling and the filmmakers to introduce new characters and give a variety of great British actors a good role to sink their teeth into. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is no exception and introduces us to Professor Dolores Umbridge. Played by Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"", ""Freedom Writers""), Umbridge is a prissy woman, always dressed in pink, who has a lot of cats. Yet, when crossed, she can be extremely nasty, while always maintaining a sickly sweet demeanor. Umbridge is appointed to the position by the Minister of Magic, to keep an eye on Dumbledore, who he suspects is trying to take his job. At Hogwarts, she immediately decorates her office in pink and hangs many plates depicting her favorite pet cats. But don't let the grandmotherly exterior fool you. If you cross her, she is not above having you write lines with a special quill that will also write the words in your flesh, providing a permanent reminder of your impertinence.There has been a bit of press in the last year about Daniel Radcliffe's debut in ""Equus"" on the London stage. Apparently, he disrobed in one scene and was so self conscious about the role that he worked out a lot to make sure he looked good. What does this mean to this film? Not a lot, except Radcliffe has matured and become a bit more buff since even the last film.Perhaps his stage debut has helped in another way. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", Radcliffe, and for that matter, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, have all significantly developed their acting ability. Radcliffe, who as the main character, appears in virtually every scene, has really become a very good actor and brings all of this talent to this story. As Harry Potter, Radcliffe has to show the most range of emotion, conflict, joy and character development. He has always been good, but in the last few films, his skill has developed exponentially and he finally appears to be a natural actor, giving the character traits and ideals we didn't necessarily get in the first few films.Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, Harry's best friend, is the actor who has developed the most during the series. He no longer relies on bugged out eyes and comical mannerisms and has relaxed, allowing his character to become more natural.Because the three kids have grown up playing these roles, they seem to finally be comfortable with the characters. As they have grown, so have the three friends, each bringing their own personalities to the role and making them unique and interesting.It seems with each of the films, the various adult actors have their moments in the sun and then fade into the background, providing a rich background for the kid actors. In ""Phoenix"", Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney and David Thewlis' Remus Lupin have the briefest of roles. Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall has a few choice moments, including a showdown with Professor Umbridge.But the real star of the supporting cast is, as always, Alan Rickman. Despite the relatively few scenes featuring Professor Snape, his character is too important to the overall fabric of these stories to fade into the background. In his first scene, Rickman only has to stare at Umbridge, as she questions him about his history at Hogwarts to perfectly exhibit every trait of his character. He utters a single word, ""Obviously"", eliciting laughter from the audience. When he speaks, his voice rolls off his tongue in a decidedly sticky manner, providing the character with all of the conflict it needs.Helena Bonham Carter also makes a first appearance as Bellatrix Lastrange, the sister of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and an ally of Voldemort. She breaks out of Azkaban prison and then makes her way back to London to aid Voldemort, using her hatred of Muggles and half-breeds as fuel. The role is very over the top, but nonetheless interesting to watch.In ""Phoenix"", the filmmakers introduce us to Sirius' house, a property he has donated to the Order of the Phoenix, for their use as a headquarters. They also show us to the Ministry of Magic for the first time. Each of these locations is fantastic. The attention to detail really helps both seem real and add to the ever-growing world of ""Harry Potter"". I don't want to go into too much detail, because you should experience them for yourself.Each of the film translations has trimmed bits of story here and there. It is a necessity; there is no way they could film everything in any single book and make a single movie. There was talk about making ""Goblet of Fire"" into two movies, one of which would be released in the summer with the conclusion released at Thanksgiving. But they decided against that. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", they chopped out entire stories, making the resulting film leaner, faster and perhaps even a little darker. Gone is the Quidditch match in which Ron leads his team to victory. Gone is Doby the house elf and Hermione's efforts to help the house elves organize against their oppressors. These would have added time to the film and the film doesn't seem to suffer extraordinarily due to their absence. It just seems odd to have a Harry Potter film with no references to Quidditch. None. Zero. Zilch.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" proves to be yet another example of the trend this entire series of films has established. Much like the actors playing the three leads, the films just keep getting better and better.",4,"No Quidditch, But One of the Better Films",1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,9588,"['Harry', 'Potter',

651503,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPI2,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Picking up whereHarry Potter and the Goblet of Firelet off, the fifth Harry Potter flick is the dark tale of maturing students thrust into some very adult conflicts. After he sees the murder of his friend Cedric by the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry finds himself at the brunt of a smear campaign. Seems the head of the Ministry of Magic doesn't like the fact that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are talking about Voldemort's return and is doing everything he can to discredit their reputations. Sort of like the Fox News of magic.As such, Fudge contrives to have the persnickety policy stooge Delores Umbridge (a perfectly cast Imelda Staunton) to makes sure that Hogwarts operates in the manner the ministry deems most fit, even if it means playing dirty. Dissent is callously stifled, relationships are prudishly regulated and students are forced to take equivalency exams that drive Hermione to gripe ""We're not learning how to defend ourselves; we're learning how to pass our O.W.L.s."" (No wizard left behind, maybe?) The movie then shifts into high gear, driving Harry and a select group of students into an underground mission, to train against Lord Voldemort and protect Hogwarts from not just the evil without but from the conservatives within.Where ""The Order of The Phoenix"" significantly differs from the other Harry Potter films is in its seriousness. Snape (Alan Rickman finally getting to reassert his character away from buffoonery) reveals why his animosity for Harry runs so deep. Ron and Hermione are acting as young adults, with new characters (Cho, Nymphadora and Luna) sparking Harry's adolescent hormones. Draco Malfoy is not a caricature in this film, and his father Luscious returns as a malevolent force. Helena Bonham Carter brings villainy to Bellatrix Lestrange (shrieking ""You Half Blood!"" at Harry at one moment). The whimsical tone ofHarry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsandHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stoneis replaced (and is kind of a loss) by the darkening of the mood and themes. But after all, it is hard to stay young and cute after 6 years and with an Evil Lord jamming your mind and seeking to destroy you.""Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix"" is a transitional movie in a series gradually forging into maturity. In fact, this is a difficult movie to recommend for younger children because of the darker themes and political intrigue (torturing students is pretty darn dark, even as fantasy goes). But as Daniel Radcliff shows that his acting skills are advancing beautifully and the series refuses to bland out, this is a highly recommendable DVD.",4,Harry Potter Gets Political,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,2596,"['Picking', 'up', 'whereHarry', 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Firelet', 'fifth', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'flick', 'dark', 'tale', 'maturing', 'students', 'thrust', 'very', 'adult', 'conflicts', 'murder', 'friend', 'Cedric', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'brunt', 'smear', 'campaign', 'head', 'Ministry', 'Magic', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'Harry', 'Professor', 'Dumbledore', 'are', 'talking', 'Voldemort', 'return', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'discredit', 'reputations', 'Sort', 'Fox', 'News', 'magic.As', 'such', 'Fudge', 'have', 'persnickety', 'policy', 'stooge', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'sure', 'operates', 'manner', 'ministry', 'most', 'fit', 'even', 'playing', 'dirty', 'Dissent', 'callously', 'stifled', 'relationships', 'are', 'prudishly', 'regulated', 'students', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'equivalency', 'exams', 'drive', 'Hermione', 'gripe', ""'re"", 'not', 'learning', 'how', 'defend', ""'re"", 'learning', 'how', 'pass', 'O.W.L.s', 'wizard', 'left', 'behind', 'maybe', 'movie', 'then', 'high', 'gear', 'driving', 'Harry', 'select', 'group', 'students', 'underground', 'mission', 'train', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'protect', 'Hogwarts', 'not', 'just', 'evil', 'conservatives', 'within.Where', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'significantly', 'other', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'seriousness', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'finally', 'getting', 'reassert', 'character', 'away', 'buffoonery', 'why', 'animosity', 'Harry', 'so', 'deep', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'are', 'acting', 'young', 'adults', 'new', 'characters', 'Cho', 'Nymphadora', 'Luna', 'sparking', 'Harry', 'adolescent', 'hormones', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'not', 'caricature', 'film', 'father', 'Luscious', 'malevolent', 'force', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'villainy', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'shrieking', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Harry', 'one', 'moment', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'ofHarry', 'Potter', 'Chamber', 'SecretsandHarry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stoneis', 'replaced', 'kind', 'loss', 'darkening', 'mood', 'themes', 'hard', 'stay', 'young', 'cute', '6', 'years', 'Evil', 'Lord', 'jamming', 'mind', 'seeking', 'destroy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'transitional', 'movie', 'series', 'gradually', 'forging', 'maturity', 'fact', 'difficult', 'movie', 'recommend', 'younger', 'children', 'darker', 'themes', 'political', 'intrigue', 'torturing', 'students', 'pretty', 'darn', 'dark', 'even', 'fantasy', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'advancing', 'beautifully', 'series', 'bland', 'out', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'DVD']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

651505,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00005JPI2,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 2]","When last we left our hero, Harry Potter, he had just faced a newly repowered Voldemort 2.0.  So it's a puzzling turn of events when Harry returns to Hogwarts only to discover that he has been branded a liar and that Voldermort's existence has been vehemently denied by the Ministry of Magic.  Harry's role as an inventor of canards has turned him into an outcast at Hogwarts where the other students look at him askance and openly doubt his story.  But even as the Ministry denies the impeding threat, a secret organization called The Order of the Phoenix has set out to defend itself against Voldemort and the Death Eaters.There are duel villains in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Not only must Harry worry about Voldermort from without, but he must also contend with the Ministry of Magic from within.  As is often the case with a new Harry Potter film, there is also a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  This time the new professor, Delores Umbridge, has been generously provided by the Ministry, and she immediately sets changes in the curriculum and the school rules.  The Ministry is fearful that Dumbledore is amassing an army of teenagers, so Umbridge does away with all experiential learning, prohibiting the students from using magic in class and relying on textbooks alone.Delores Umbridge is the type of villain who appears tailor made to get under your skin.  She wears bright pink outfits that seem to have been shipped from the early 1960s.  She always doles out punishment with a healthy smile on her face.  And, she covers the walls of her office with the kinds of collectible plates you can buy at 2am on the Home Shopping Network.  Of course, each plate depicts a mewling kitten that actually mewls.  As far as movie villains go, Umbridge is once removed from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nests's Nurse Ratchett.  Characters like these are so self-satisfied with their type of oppression, often branded with a smiley face, that the audience cannot help but anticipate their downfall.In response to Umbridge's restriction on using magic, the Hogwarts students set up their own secret club where Harry, who has the most experience in battle, teaches his peers how to attack with and defend against magic.  After years of Harry being used as a game piece in a series of long cons, it's refreshing to see him and his fellow students actively prepare themselves against Voldermort and his minions.  Not only does this underground magic club help groom Harry into a leader, but it also heals rifts between Harry and his classmates who had come to doubt his warnings about Voldemort.Harry's preparation for the battles ahead does not stop with a secret student organization.  Dumbledore tasks Professor Snape with preparing Harry against mental incursions by Voldemort.  It is still unclear exactly what the connection between Harry and Voldermort is, but it results in a psychic connection between the two enemies that may be used as a weakness.  Snape's training takes on the form of torture, similar to those in the military who undergo different ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques in order to inoculate them when they are employed by the enemy.Snape has always been one of my favorite professors at Hogwarts, and it's not only because of Alan Rickman's commanding vibrato.  Even in the earlier installments, where the line between good and evil was much starker, Snape was a character who ultimately did the right thing despite whatever darkness lingered in him.  Here we are given a reason for why Snape is always in such a foul mood.  During one of their interrogation sessions, Harry turns his powers against Snape and discovers, hidden in his memories, that a much younger Snape used to be an object of teasing and torture for Harry's father.  Instead of demystifying the character, this bit of back story actually further connects him with Harry.  We understand that the two have a shared past, which extends before Harry was even born, and we now know both characters have similar demons festering inside of them.As Harry admits to his godfather, Sirius Black, he has an anger growing in him.  Sirius explains to Harry that there is no such thing as pure good and pure evil, that both exist within us and we must sort them out ourselves.  This is a particularly touching scene because not only does it showcase a family connection between Sirius and Harry, but it allows Sirius to explain that he comes from a family of purists who looked down on mudbloods, children who are gifted with magical abilities but one or more of their parents are not magical.  Sirius's speech to Harry can be viewed as defining the difference between the first two Harry Potter films and the subsequent, darker installments.The tighter structure of The Order of the Phoenix allies it with The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had a similar blockbuster feel.  At times, however, it becomes apparent that The Order of the Phoenix had to amputate parts of the book in order to fit the film within the relatively short (for a Harry Potter film, that is) running time.  There are many characters who are introduced but never fully positioned within the world.  Many of these characters are members of the Order of the Phoenix, and because they serve as Easter eggs for the true fan and to supply depth to the universe of Harry Potter, reminding us that much more is going on beyond the halls of Hogwarts, these characters add rather than subtract from the film.  (Although, in one awkward exchange a Goth looking witch tells Mad Eye Moody, without explanation, not to call her Nymphona for reasons that surely can only be deciphered by J.K. Rowling acolytes).  However, other characters who occupy more running time appear to be shoehorned into the proceedings.  Luna Lovegood, a witch who is a bit touched in the head, serves as a mirror to Harry's own troubled past, but she's lumped conspicuously into the story seemingly without reason.  Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's turn as Bellatrix Lestrange, the cousin of Sirius Black, is too small a part for such a well recognized actress.  Both characters may be building towards something more important, but their inclusion here reminds the viewer that we are always receiving part of the story.Despite the consistent quality of the Harry Potter films, they will always be, in part, companion pieces to the original books.  The filmmakers are at once too deferential to the source material, afraid to discard with too much, and incapable of fully realizing the immensity of the books themselves.  The Order of the Phoenix is as guilty of this as the other films, but ultimately it showcases one of the most propulsive plots in the series and ends with the most exciting climax yet.  Perhaps it would be more than a tad greedy to ask for anything more.",4,Training a Battalion of Young Wizards and Witches,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,6814,"['When', 'last', 'left', 'hero', 'Harry',

651508,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B00005JPI2,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[3, 5]","The fifth instalment of the Harry Potter series is not an easy read. It deals with death and loneliness and the ""age of nobody understands me"". Despite facing death for the first time in the fourth book, this is the first time Harry is facing the aftermath of death and learning how to deal with death itself. The theme was clear right from the beginning when he saw the ""winged creatures with bones on their bodies"" drawing the carriage and nobody except Luna, who had seen death, could see it.David Yates managed to capture all these very well in his vision of the Harry Potter world. It is dark all through and the loneliness of the boy wizard that creeps in from time to time does show that the audience should now be ready for something more epical and drastic coming. Book five is a bridging book of the series and it is not easy to please anyone. So is the film. Critics have not been easy on the movie itself but a more closely look to the book, and then you will be able to appreciate more about the movie. There were lots of details from the book that were left out because of the natural confinement of the movie medium itself, but it does keep a lot of the originalities inside. The rendenz-vous with Luna is more memorable as compared to the book, but the whole nerdiness of the character was gone. Luna became a creepy, calm but very interesting character and Evanna Lynch did a fair job, considering the substantial change to the character in the script. The importance of the Order itself was shifted in the movie. As a result they became side line story instead and all the relationships among the people in the Order became unimportant in the movie. So if you are up for the Order you might be disappointed. However, it seems like the new Order is formed under the Dumbledore Army is being the new theme of the movie. The passing of the baton became very important as compared to the book. The more mentioned character in the Order is undoubtedly Sirius Black but that is understandable, considering his pivotal role in the book itself. However, the way he showed up in the flame this time is different as compared to Goblet of Fire. That might be the sort of details producers need to look at - how can the same magic performed by the same person in the same space look completely different between the two movies?Daniel, Rupert and Emma gave a fair performance but really in this movie they didn't really shine. Daniel looks angry all the time. Yes, the character is supposed to be angry but not superficially with an angry face and just panting heavily with a few water drops on his face. If his performance as an actor in Equus receives critical acclaim, sure he should be able to deliver more in Half Blood Prince. But again, is Harry a demanding character to perform? The screen stealer is no doubt Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. Her appearances showed a well interpretation of aggressive gentleness - and she is not shy to deploy that on her students. Emma Thompson brief appearances were still very enjoyable although in the book her character is more important than in the movie. But again, the movie is now more about the younger generation.The special effects are up to standard as usual but a lot of familiar things are back, e.g. the moving staircases and of course the centaurs. The battle at the Ministry is a well orchestrated end to the movie and the swift movements between the Death Eaters and the Order certainly are cool eye candies for the movie. The youngster also played out well as the successors of the Order for the future. The battle between the opposites - light and darkness, fire versus water, were well done, though a bit obvious. The score of the movie is spectacular and captures the emotion of the movie extremely well. That added a lot of substance to the movie itself. For the well, kissing scene, it is just really overrated. Maybe it is an impact for kids, but for adults, it is just another kissing scene.Squeezing the book into a 2 hours or so movie is not an easy task. David Yates sure did a good job for the book. The book itself was not an easy read, so the movie will not be an easy watch for a lot of people, especially if you are expecting a standard Harry formula of just imaginary fantasy, because the fantasy is over. What is in stall for the audience this time is some serious action that will cause the lives of a number of characters in the upcoming finale. The Potter movie has grown out of the kids premises and like all teenagers' coming of age, it is not easy to handle and appreciate.",4,A fair transition for the series.,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,4567,"['fifth', 'instalment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'not', 'easy', 'read', 'death', 'loneliness', 'age', 'nobody', 'facing', 'death', 'first', 'time', 'fourth', 'book', 'first', 'time', 'Harry', 'facing', 'aftermath', 'death', 'learning', 'how', 'deal', 'death', 'theme', 'was', 'clear', 'right', 'beginning', 'when', 'saw', 'winged', 'creatures', 'bones', 'bodies', 'drawing', 'carriage', 'nobody', 'Luna', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'death', 'could', 'see', 'it.David', 'Yates', 'managed', 'capture', 'very', 'well', 'vision', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'world', 'dark', 'loneliness', 'boy', 'wizard', 'time', 'time', 'show', 'audience', 'should', 'now', 'be', 'ready', 'something', 'more', 'epical', 'drastic', 'coming', 'Book', 'five', 'bridging', 'book', 'series', 'not', 'easy', 'please', 'anyone', 'film', 'Critics', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'easy', 'movie', 'more', 'closely', 'look', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'more', 'movie', 'were', 'lots', 'details', 'book', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'natural', 'confinement', 'movie', 'medium', 'keep', 'lot', 'originalities', 'rendenz-vous', 'Luna', 'more', 'memorable', 'compared', 'book', 'whole', 'nerdiness', 'character', 'was', 'gone', 'Luna', 'became', 'creepy', 'calm', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'considering', 'substantial', 'change', 'character', 'script', 'importance', 'Order', 'was', 'shifted', 'movie', 'result', 'became', 'side', 'line', 'story', 'instead', 'relationships', 'people', 'Order', 'became', 'unimportant', 'movie', 'So', 'are', 'up', 'Order', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'new', 'Order', 'formed', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'being', 'new', 'theme', 'movie', 'passing', 'baton', 'became', 'very', 'important', 'compared', 'book', 'more', 'mentioned', 'character', 'Order', 'undoubtedly', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'understandable', 'considering', 'pivotal', 'role', 'book', 'However', 'way', 'showed', 'up', 'flame', 'time', 'different', 'compared', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'might', 'be', 'sort', 'details', 'producers', 'need', 'look', 'how', 'can', 'same', 'magic', 'performed', 'same', 'person', 'same', 'space', 'look', 'completely', 'different', 'two', 'movies', 'Daniel', 'Rupert', 'Emma', 'gave', 'fair', 'performance', 'really', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'shine', 'Daniel', 'angry', 'time', 'Yes', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'angry', 'not', 'superficially', 'angry', 'face', 'just', 'panting', 'heavily', 'few', 'water', 'drops', 'face', 'performance', 'actor', 'Equus', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'sure', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'deliver', 'more', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'again', 'Harry', 'demanding', 'character', 'perform', 'screen', 'stealer', 'doubt', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'appearances', 'showed', 'well', 'interpretation', 'aggressive', 'gentleness', 'not', 'shy', 'deploy', 'students', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'brief', 'appearances', 'were', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'book', 'character', 'more', 'important', 'movie', 'again', 'movie', 'now', 'more', 'younger', 'generation.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'up', 'standard', 'usual', 'lot', 'familiar', 'things', 'are', 'back', 'e.g', 'moving', 'staircases', 'course', 'centaurs', 'battle', 'Ministry', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'end', 'movie', 'swift', 'movements', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'Order', 'certainly', 'are', 'cool', 'eye', 'candies', 'movie', 'youngster', 'also', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'successors', 'Order', 'future', 'battle', 'opposites', 'light', 'darkness', 'fire', 'versus', 'water', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'bit', 'obvious', 'score', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'emotion', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'added', 'lot', 'substance', 'movie', 'well', 'kissing', 'scene', 'just', 'really', 'overrated', 'Maybe', 'impact', 'kids', 'adults', 'just', 'kissing', 'scene.Squeezing', 'book', '2', 'hours', 'so', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'David', 'sure', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'book', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'read', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'watch', 'lot', 'people', 'especially', 'are', 'expecting', 'standard', 'Harry', 'formula', 'just', 'imaginary', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'over', 'What', 'stall', 'audience', 'time', 'serious', 'action', 'will', 'cause', 'lives', 'number', 'characters', 'upcoming', 'finale', 'Potter', 'movie', 'grown', 'kids', 'premises', 'teenagers', 'coming', 'age', 'not', 'easy', 'handle', 'appreciate']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
651509,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPI2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","I don't know why, but ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of Harry Potter films is by far the shortest of the series. Considering the numbers of the characters and the events that happen to them, the film's 138 minutes is too short. It needs three hours and the content deserves that length.Plot thickens here. No more delightful Quidditch can be seen. In spite of the occasional comical moments and Harry's romance, the film's tone gets darker than ever and even Ron's mother looks more worried. If you remember what happened at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" she should be more worried about her children. That means some scenes might be too scary for kids.New characters (and talent) enter the story - newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is most impressive - and some regular characters like Draco Malfoy are almost forgotten. I don't know how many of you miss Draco, but with additional 20 or 30 minutes this kind of thing could be avoided. Helena Bonham Carter's villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is introduced a bit too abruptly in the story, which lessens the impact of the final battle scene and its consequences.The visuals themselves are fantastic as always, but director David Yates is no Alfonso Cuaron. The special effects such as Harry and friends flying over Themes River are, technically, just wizardly, but not imaginative. The scenes are beautiful, but no wicked humor of Shrunken Head.

'Order of The Phoenix' was a real step up in the Harry Potter saga. A story that originated around magic spells and fairytales became a real world of war and politics. Harry Potter knew that this year at Hogwarts was going to be no different than the previous. Witnessing a fellow student die at the hands of his enemies the previous year things have gone from bad to worse. The Wizadering World has been torn between believers of the dark lords' return and those who just want to live in denial. Unfortunatly the second side is the side with all the power as the Ministry is trying to keep everyone in line including the children at Hogwarts. With a new teaching on the grounds insituting new rules to keep Harry's mouth shut, Harry and his friends are not going to take it lightly.This film was going to be a challenge for whomever took the directors chair. Small time director David Yates created a great film rich in the detail of the story. Eventhough a great amount of the books material was cut it was just like 'Goblet of Fire' There is a lot of pointless side story which really has no reference to the meat of the story and that is why you do not see those in the film. The characters have really come a long way acting wise. The children have really evolved since the begining and new commer Imelda Staunton nailed Umbridge. What David Yates did that was very different from the previous directors was that he made these characters real. With all the wizardry and magic there was a real sense of realisim through the diologue and the emotions expressed by the characters.

Really, she should get a best-supporting actress nod or something for this - the only problem is, who can watch it?It seems to me that if you're making a fantasy film and you have a character who is this vile, you need to balance her out in some way, like with some more teen romance, or a nice game of quidditch, or whatever.

651517,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JPI2,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 4]","Fidelity can be overrated. When it comes to adapting a book into a movie, it's difficult to know what to cut and keep in. For ""Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix"" directed David Yates has streamlined Rowling's book in favor of the main plot. While it is missing some of the character of Rowling's book, it makes up for it with non-stop action and terrific acting particularly from Daniel Ratcliffe who has really blossomed as an actor in this film. Yates and the screenwriter Michael Goldenberg (""Contact"", ""Peter Pan"")manage to condense a thick novel into a shorter, action packed sequel. That means they sometimes have to introduce characters on the fly without much background on them but the performances by the actors help fill us in a bit as well as their actions on screen.Video & Audio:As if by magic we get a sharp, crisp and colorful transfer. Featuring moody cinematography (unlike the candy floss cinematography of the first two Potter films) ""Phoenix"" captures the mood of the novel quite well.You can hear all those spells with all their detail intact as the 5.1 mix makes nice use of the format putting effects around the various speakers as necessary. This is the second film liberated from John Williams' too cutesy themes (I love Williams but his score did not work well for the ""Potter"" films) and has one of the best scores as well. Nicholas Hooper's score sounds marvelous in its presentation here.Extras:""Phoenix"" is a bit light in the special features department. Well, that's not totally true, it's just that the special features aren't all that...special. We get 10 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film. Sometimes these are bits and pieces that just didn't fit into the film (and they didn't) other times they are extensions of scenes already in the film but cut for good reason (they overstayed their welcome).""Trailing Tonks"" features actress Natalia Tena (who plays Nymphadora Tonks in the film hence the title) giving us a tour of the studios and the sets.""Harry Potter and the Magic of Editing"" is short and to the point. Director Yates and editor Mark Day discuss how only minor edits can alter the pacing and feel of a film and gives us some brief examples.I've saved the biggest but not necessarily the best for last. ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" is an Electronic Press Kit in everything but name only. It's not bad it just could have gone more into depth about the challenges of condensing one of the bigger Potter books, reception from fans to the changes, etc.Fans may not be happy with the abridged version in the shortest Potter film yet but I found this to be entertaining and in the spirit of Rowling's book. I try never to compare books to films simply because one can handle multiple narratives while the other handles imaginative action better. Highly recommended even though the extras are a bit on the weak side and hey, it's the movie that matters after all. Just be aware that there will probably be a double dip somewhere down the line.",4,One of the best Potter films yet!,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,3008,"['Fidelity', 'can', 'be', 'overrated', 'When', 'adapting', 'book', 'movie', 'difficult', 'know', 'what', 'cut', 'keep', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'directed', 'David', 'Yates', 'streamlined', 'Rowling', 'book', 'favor', 'main', 'plot', 'missing', 'character', 'Rowling', 'book', 'up', 'non-stop', 'action', 'terrific', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Daniel', 'Ratcliffe', 'who', 'really', 'blossomed', 'actor', 'film', 'Yates', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Goldenberg', 'Contact', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'manage', 'condense', 'thick', 'novel', 'shorter', 'action', 'packed', 'sequel', 'sometimes', 'have', 'introduce', 'characters', 'fly', 'much', 'background', 'performances', 'actors', 'help', 'fill', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'actions', 'screen.Video', 'Audio', 'magic', 'get', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'colorful', 'transfer', 'Featuring', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'candy', 'floss', 'cinematography', 'first', 'two', 'Potter', 'films', 'Phoenix', 'mood', 'novel', 'quite', 'well.You', 'can', 'hear', 'spells', 'detail', 'intact', '5.1', 'mix', 'nice', 'use', 'format', 'putting', 'effects', 'various', 'speakers', 'necessary', 'second', 'film', 'liberated', 'John', 'Williams', 'too', 'cutesy', 'themes', 'love', 'Williams', 'score', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'Potter', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'as', 'well', 'Nicholas', 'Hooper', 'score', 'marvelous', 'presentation', 'here.Extras', 'Phoenix', 'bit', 'light', 'special', 'features', 'department', 'Well', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'get', '10', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', 'times', 'are', 'extensions', 'scenes', 'already', 'film', 'cut', 'good', 'reason', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'Trailing', 'Tonks', 'actress', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'who', 'Nymphadora', 'Tonks', 'film', 'hence', 'title', 'giving', 'tour', 'studios', 'sets', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Magic', 'Editing', 'short', 'point', 'Director', 'Yates', 'editor', 'Mark', 'Day', 'discuss', 'how', 'only', 'minor', 'edits', 'can', 'alter', 'pacing', 'feel', 'film', 'brief', 'examples.I', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'biggest', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'last', 'Hidden', 'Secrets', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Electronic', 'Press', 'Kit', 'everything', 'name', 'only', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'depth', 'challenges', 'condensing', 'one', 'bigger', 'Potter', 'books', 'reception', 'fans', 'changes', 'etc.Fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'abridged', 'version', 'shortest', 'Potter', 'film', 'yet', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'spirit', 'Rowling', 'book', 'try', 'never', 'compare', 'books', 'films', 'simply', 'one', 'can', 'handle', 'multiple', 'narratives', 'other', 'handles', 'imaginative', 'action', 'better', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'even', 'extras', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'side', 'hey', 'movie', 'matters', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'double', 'dip', 'somewhere', 'line']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Now with the books getting bigger and the stories more involved, we start to see key elements from the book missing from the movies.For that reason, I can only really recommend this movie to HP fans, as someone who watches it without the literary exposure to the book may miss a lot and not really appreciate the pace of the story and the events which unfold.

OOTP as a book was long but didn't really have much of a plot. Oh, it sure did ridicule the government and offered a lot of teen angst moments, but the story was more less non-existent. Ironically, OOTP was the longest book yet it is the shortest of the HP films, perhaps WB's reaction to criticism of the first two films being too long & slow.Well, Daniel Radcliffe is still a fine Harry, better than his sidekicks anyway. Grint wasn't as annoying as he was in past films, but he has nothing to do and nothing funny to say (granted, Ron was nothing but an emotional punching bag for Harry by this point). Emma Watson as usual is just plain annoying, coming off as a spoiled school princess instead of a well meaning book worm.Imelda Stanton is well cast as the obnoxious Umbridge, and Evanna Lynch is spot on as Luna Lovegood.

651522,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPI2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","Though undoubtedly a bit drawn out, the novel version of ""Order of the Phoenix"" does contain its share of epic moments.  I thought that this movie version would be an improvement, as it would be able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"", so to speak, and keep the action flowing.  What actually happens, however, is that the movie never slows down enough to savor those great moments, instead pushing forward relentlessly from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""Phoenix"" begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) defending himself at the Ministry of Magic after using a Patronus Charm to defeat some Dementors near Privet Drive.  Upon returning to Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the school is slowly being turned into a mouthpiece of Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) with the appointment of Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as a central figure.  Soon, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) get some first-hand experience dealing with the ""politics of magic"", so to speak.The film version of ""Phoenix"" is basically a class-A example of a movie not living up to the novel.  It is just a little odd for this series considering that all the previous movies were very favorably toward their books' source materials.  The trouble here is that director David Yates doesn't quite know when to ""slow down"" and savor the moment (or even what those right moments are).For example (spoilers ahead)...-Some very interesting material regarding why Harry must always stay with the Dursleys is completely excised.  This was a key portion of the book that really ties up some loose story ends.-Also gone is a very touching ""Weasley is our King"" Quidditch angle from the book.  Instead, Grint's Ron is given nothing to do in this one.-Umbridge is treated with a comical air instead of the malice she should personify.  in fact, her first appearances in the Hogwarts halls are set to a sort of music video montage totally unbecoming of what her character should be.-The final climactic battle featuring Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) carries none of the gravitas of the novel (or even lives up to the Potter/Voldemort scenes at the end of ""Goblet of Fire).  It just falls flat.One thing that the movie does get right, however, is spending a least a bit more time (though still far less than the book) rounding out the auxiliary cast.  The Weasley Twins (James & Oliver Phelps), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), & Cho Chang (Katie Lueng) get more screen time than ever before, while newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is a great new addition to the cast.Thus, while ""Order of the Phoenix"" isn't a terrible movie by any means, it is the first of the Potter movies to significantly be worse than its source-material novel.  Too many key moments are missing, while the ones that do show up aren't allowed to be savored like they should.",3,Never Fully Captures The Epic Moments From the Book,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2904,"['undoubtedly', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'novel', 'version', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'contain', 'share', 'epic', 'moments', 'thought', 'movie', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'improvement', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'separate', 'wheat', 'chaff', 'so', 'speak', 'keep', 'action', 'flowing', 'What', 'actually', 'however', 'movie', 'never', 'down', 'enough', 'savor', 'great', 'moments', 'instead', 'pushing', 'forward', 'relentlessly', 'beginning', 'end.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Phoenix', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'defending', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'using', 'Patronus', 'Charm', 'defeat', 'Dementors', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'returning', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'school', 'slowly', 'being', 'turned', 'mouthpiece', 'Cornelius', 'Fudge', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'appointment', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'central', 'figure', 'Soon', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'get', 'first-hand', 'experience', 'dealing', 'politics', 'magic', 'so', 'speak.The', 'film', 'version', 'Phoenix', 'basically', 'class-A', 'example', 'movie', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'novel', 'just', 'little', 'odd', 'series', 'considering', 'previous', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'favorably', 'books', 'source', 'materials', 'trouble', 'here', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'when', 'slow', 'down', 'savor', 'moment', 'even', 'what', 'right', 'moments', 'are', '.For', 'example', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '-Some', 'very', 'interesting', 'material', 'regarding', 'why', 'Harry', 'must', 'always', 'stay', 'Dursleys', 'completely', 'excised', 'was', 'key', 'portion', 'book', 'really', 'up', 'loose', 'story', 'ends.-Also', 'gone', 'very', 'touching', 'Weasley', 'King', 'Quidditch', 'angle', 'book', 'Instead', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'one.-Umbridge', 'treated', 'comical', 'air', 'instead', 'malice', 'should', 'personify', 'fact', 'first', 'appearances', 'Hogwarts', 'halls', 'are', 'set', 'sort', 'music', 'video', 'montage', 'totally', 'unbecoming', 'what', 'character', 'should', 'be.-The', 'final', 'climactic', 'battle', 'featuring', 'Dumbledore', 'Micheal', 'Gambon', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'none', 'gravitas', 'novel', 'even', 'up', 'Potter/Voldemort', 'scenes', 'end', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'just', 'flat.One', 'thing', 'movie', 'get', 'right', 'however', 'spending', 'least', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'still', 'far', 'less', 'book', 'rounding', 'out', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'Weasley', 'Twins', 'James', 'Oliver', 'Phelps', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Neville', 'Longbottom', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'Cho', 'Chang', 'Katie', 'Lueng', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'ever', 'newcomer', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'great', 'new', 'addition', 'cast.Thus', 'Order', 'Phoenix', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'movie', 'means', 'first', 'Potter', 'movies', 'significantly', 'be', 'worse', 'source-material', 'novel', 'Too', 'many', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'missing', 'ones', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'be', 'savored', 'should']",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
