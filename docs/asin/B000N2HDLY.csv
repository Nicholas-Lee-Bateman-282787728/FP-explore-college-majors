For major league fans, a must see, for those who are on the fence, you won't be after you see this very unguarded, relaxed, insightful, and at times intimate interview.  My only beef is that the actual interview was almost 6 hours long, but only 1.4 hours made it to the DVD...what a huge shame.  I am a medium BS fan, but find myself now even more in awe of her accomplishments and looking at and enjoying her work from a new perspective thanks to this interview.",5,Must have/see for all Barbra fans,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,470,"['Wow', 'major', 'league', 'fans', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'fence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'see', 'very', 'unguarded', 'relaxed', 'insightful', 'times', 'intimate', 'interview', 'only', 'beef', 'actual', 'interview', 'was', 'almost', '6', 'hours', 'long', 'only', '1.4', 'hours', 'made', 'DVD', 'what', 'huge', 'shame', 'am', 'medium', 'BS', 'fan', 'find', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'awe', 'accomplishments', 'looking', 'enjoying', 'work', 'new', 'perspective', 'thanks', 'interview']",Inside The Actors Studio: Barbra Streisand

However, in the Amazon Editorial Description of this product there is a misprint or type O. Here is what Amazon wrote:""Product DescriptionOver four decades, Barbra Streisand has reached the pinnacle of every art form she has encountered. She is the first artist ever to earn a Grammy, a Tony, an Emmy and an Oscar. In this program, this beloved entertainer speaks revealingly about herself and her craft.......""The statement that Barbra is the first artist to have won all four awards is not correct.

1052439,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000N2HDLY,Ed Uyeshima,"[25, 25]","I will state the obvious and say your enjoyment of this DVD will depend entirely on how much admiration you have for Barbra Streisand, an inarguable legend, a multi-hyphenated megatalent and a most polarizing figure among the general public. James Lipton has been conducting these substantive, non-controversial interviews for over a dozen years and consistently infiltrates each show with the sometimes mind-numbing depth of research he gathers in preparation, i.e., his voluminous stack of blue index cards. His approach to interviewing Streisand in 2003 is no different, and in response, after a tentative beginning, she is forthcoming in her particularly idiosyncratic manner - sometimes erudite, sometimes abrupt, and sometimes snappily funny. In other words, a pure, unfettered Streisand is presented here, and at 61, she looks terrific.He starts the conversation by probing her about her origins in Brooklyn and tracking her professional history chronologically through documented milestones and achievements. The difference between Lipton and other talk show hosts - in particular, Mike Wallace's infamously harsh profile on60 Minutesin 1991 - is that he does not dwell on tabloid gossip or personal expos&eacute;s but rather draws out what it took for Streisand to achieve certain noteworthy performances or accomplishments. Given the time he spends explaining the hurdles he had to overcome to get her to come on the show, Lipton seems particularly worshipful and has her discuss her singing career and politics as much as her acting and filmmaking ventures. Of course, she is subjected to the familiar Bernard Pivot questionnaire, which yields some insightful responses despite its veneer of pretense, and this is followed by a more open-ended Q&A; with the drama school students. This one is truly for her fans.",4,Streisand More Documented Than Revealed But Still a Most Enjoyable Interview,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,1823,"['will', 'state', 'obvious', 'say', 'enjoyment', 'DVD', 'will', 'depend', 'entirely', 'how', 'much', 'admiration', 'have', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'inarguable', 'legend', 'multi-hyphenated', 'megatalent', 'most', 'polarizing', 'figure', 'general', 'public', 'James', 'Lipton', 'been', 'conducting', 'substantive', 'non-controversial', 'interviews', 'dozen', 'years', 'consistently', 'show', 'sometimes', 'mind-numbing', 'depth', 'research', 'preparation', 'i.e.', 'voluminous', 'stack', 'blue', 'index', 'cards', 'approach', 'interviewing', 'Streisand', '2003', 'different', 'response', 'tentative', 'beginning', 'forthcoming', 'particularly', 'idiosyncratic', 'manner', 'sometimes', 'erudite', 'sometimes', 'abrupt', 'sometimes', 'snappily', 'funny', 'other', 'words', 'pure', 'unfettered', 'Streisand', 'presented', 'here', '61', 'terrific.He', 'conversation', 'probing', 'origins', 'Brooklyn', 'tracking', 'professional', 'history', 'chronologically', 'documented', 'milestones', 'achievements', 'difference', 'Lipton', 'other', 'talk', 'show', 'particular', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'infamously', 'harsh', 'profile', 'on60', 'Minutesin', '1991', 'not', 'dwell', 'tabloid', 'gossip', 'personal', 'expos', 'eacute', 'rather', 'out', 'what', 'took', 'Streisand', 'achieve', 'certain', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'accomplishments', 'Given', 'time', 'explaining', 'hurdles', 'had', 'overcome', 'get', 'come', 'show', 'Lipton', 'particularly', 'worshipful', 'discuss', 'singing', 'career', 'politics', 'as', 'much', 'acting', 'filmmaking', 'ventures', 'course', 'subjected', 'familiar', 'Bernard', 'Pivot', 'questionnaire', 'insightful', 'responses', 'veneer', 'pretense', 'followed', 'more', 'open-ended', 'Q', 'A', 'drama', 'school', 'students', 'one', 'truly', 'fans']",Inside The Actors Studio: Barbra Streisand
