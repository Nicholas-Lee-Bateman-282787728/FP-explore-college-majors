874329,A2WS6FMF750EI9,B0006U3SY4,"Amy Steele ""quirky one""","[0, 0]","Degrassi JH was a PBS show made in the late eighties that addressed and dramatized problems kid might face in their middle school years. We are so overjoyed to have DJH at our home and at our beck and call. Since my daughter got sex ed classes last year in the fourth grade, I figured, ""What the heck?"", and decided to enter the portal of preteen angst, crushes, and tough quizzes. My daughter will be entering middle school next year (2014-2015) anyway. Any topic that comes up in a DJH episode that I or a teacher has not covered as of yet can be discussed if desired- I have a mouth for a reason! If my daughter does not ask, I leave it for another time, because there is time. Let me stroll down memory lane here for a sec...""How I loved Degrassi JH at age fifteen...better late than never. PBS was my secret love. No one knew I watched this show. I wanted to be punker than Spike, drunker than Stephanie, smarter than Voula, chicer than Lucy, and have hair more luscious than Ms. Avery's. O.K., so I did eventually get drunker than Stephanie. This show challenged me, enlightened me, and delighted me. I now pass on its legacy to an early preteen who is very sassy and saavy."" -Amy Steele, age fortyHere are some of the topics dealt with on this superb show: Divorce, alcoholism, unwanted touches, depression, drug use and its consequences, dissing of friends, lying, stealing, teen pregnancy, death, different forms of sexuality, racism, physical abuse, boobs, rumors, facing illnesses, fears, failure, censorship, bullies, love gone wrong, parties gone wrong, eating disorders, runaways, braces, remarriage, choices, and  wet dreams. A cornucopia of subjects that we parents do not always know how to broach with our kids...I sat with my daughter through 90% of the episodes and kept the ""pause"" button on the remote within easy reach so we could talk while watching. She has already experienced a few of the above listed topics, and I hope that this show acting as a conduit to other life events will make her feel less alone and confused.Extras: When a bit older, some of the actors from Degrassi went across Canada and interviewed teens, young adults, and even their fellow actors on various topics. The hourish show was called ""Degrassi Talks"". Interesting and informative, with humor interspersed via honest humans. Topics are: Sex, sexuality, drugs, alcohol, depression, and abuse.Other extras are a few pop quizzes on the show, and printable materials for educators that my computer will not let me access. DVDs have scene selection, wallpaper, and closed captions.I disagree with the top negativeish reviewer; I feel that the quality of the film is fine and crisp.Now, onto the price...getting the three seasons separately rather than in one mega-set is way cheaper. I cannot tell ya what extras are on the mega-set, but it was the show I was after, not the extras. I spent a little over twenty bucks instead of about double that by going with the separate seasons.If you are an edgy, sometimes wistful adult with curious preteens, share this show. Then move on to ""Degrassi High"" when deemed fit (subject matter gets more intense).""Everybody face up to the the facts as they are...""  -The Zit Remedy (Degrassi's house band)",5,Degrassi is De-Best,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,3239,"['Degrassi', 'JH', 'was', 'PBS', 'show', 'made', 'late', 'eighties', 'addressed', 'dramatized', 'problems', 'kid', 'might', 'face', 'middle', 'school', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'overjoyed', 'have', 'DJH', 'home', 'beck', 'call', 'daughter', 'got', 'sex', 'ed', 'classes', 'last', 'year', 'fourth', 'grade', 'figured', 'What', 'heck', 'decided', 'enter', 'portal', 'preteen', 'angst', 'crushes', 'tough', 'quizzes', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'entering', 'middle', 'school', 'next', 'year', '2014-2015', 'anyway', 'Any', 'topic', 'up', 'DJH', 'episode', 'teacher', 'not', 'covered', 'yet', 'can', 'be', 'discussed', 'desired-', 'have', 'mouth', 'reason', 'daughter', 'not', 'ask', 'leave', 'time', 'time', 'Let', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'here', 'sec', 'How', 'loved', 'Degrassi', 'JH', 'age', 'fifteen', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'PBS', 'was', 'secret', 'love', 'one', 'knew', 'watched', 'show', 'wanted', 'be', 'punker', 'Spike', 'drunker', 'Stephanie', 'smarter', 'Voula', 'chicer', 'Lucy', 'have', 'hair', 'more', 'luscious', 'Ms.', 'Avery', 'O.K.', 'did', 'eventually', 'get', 'drunker', 'Stephanie', 'show', 'challenged', 'enlightened', 'delighted', 'now', 'pass', 'legacy', 'early', 'preteen', 'who', 'very', 'sassy', 'saavy', '-Amy', 'Steele', 'age', 'are', 'topics', 'dealt', 'superb', 'show', 'Divorce', 'alcoholism', 'unwanted', 'touches', 'depression', 'drug', 'use', 'consequences', 'dissing', 'friends', 'lying', 'stealing', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'death', 'different', 'forms', 'sexuality', 'racism', 'physical', 'abuse', 'boobs', 'rumors', 'facing', 'illnesses', 'fears', 'failure', 'censorship', 'bullies', 'love', 'gone', 'wrong', 'parties', 'gone', 'wrong', 'eating', 'disorders', 'runaways', 'braces', 'remarriage', 'choices', 'wet', 'dreams', 'cornucopia', 'subjects', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'know', 'how', 'broach', 'kids', 'sat', 'daughter', '90', '%', 'episodes', 'kept', 'pause', 'button', 'remote', 'easy', 'reach', 'could', 'talk', 'watching', 'already', 'experienced', 'few', 'above', 'listed', 'topics', 'hope', 'show', 'acting', 'conduit', 'other', 'life', 'events', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'alone', 'confused.Extras', 'When', 'bit', 'older', 'actors', 'Degrassi', 'went', 'Canada', 'interviewed', 'teens', 'young', 'adults', 'even', 'fellow', 'actors', 'various', 'topics', 'hourish', 'show', 'was', 'called', 'Degrassi', 'Talks', 'Interesting', 'informative', 'humor', 'interspersed', 'honest', 'humans', 'Topics', 'are', 'Sex', 'sexuality', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'depression', 'abuse.Other', 'extras', 'are', 'few', 'pop', 'quizzes', 'show', 'printable', 'materials', 'educators', 'computer', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'access', 'DVDs', 'have', 'scene', 'selection', 'wallpaper', 'closed', 'captions.I', 'disagree', 'top', 'negativeish', 'reviewer', 'feel', 'quality', 'film', 'fine', 'crisp.Now', 'price', 'getting', 'three', 'seasons', 'separately', 'rather', 'one', 'mega-set', 'way', 'cheaper', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'ya', 'what', 'extras', 'are', 'mega-set', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'extras', 'spent', 'little', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'instead', 'about', 'double', 'going', 'separate', 'seasons.If', 'are', 'edgy', 'sometimes', 'wistful', 'adult', 'curious', 'preteens', 'share', 'show', 'Then', 'move', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'when', 'deemed', 'fit', 'subject', 'matter', 'more', 'intense', 'Everybody', 'facts', 'are', 'Zit', 'Remedy', 'Degrassi', 'house', 'band']",Degrassi Junior High - Season 1

The series was a bold spinoff from the short-lived afterschool series THE KIDS OF DEGRASSI STREET, and was groundbreaking in that it approached topics like peer pressure, teen violence, suicide, sex and pregnancy with well-written and intelligent storylines.  This series remains, 15 years later, quality television for the pre-teens and teens sets (adults will appreciate the writing and amazing acting from the talented cast), and stands up well to repeat screenings.Season One introduces some of the most-loved characters like Caitlin (Stacie Mistysyn), Yick (Siluck Saysanasy), Wheels (Neil Hope), Melanie (Sara Ballingall),  Joey Jeremiah (Pat Mastroianni), Spike (Amanda Stepto), Stephanie Kaye (Nicole Stoffman) and Snake (Stefan Brogren).Episodes included:""Kiss Me Steph"" - Stephanie Kaye decides to use her newfound popularity to run for School President, personally ensuring every male vote of the school, and  using her brainy best friend Voula (Niki Kemeny) to run the campaign.""The Big Dance"" - It's time for the annual Fall Dance, but Voula's father has forbidden her to attend.  Stephanie gets drunk at Lucy's house and barely makes it to the event.""The Experiment"" - Yick and Arthur (Duncan Waugh) try out for the basketball team, and Joey gets Kathleen (Rebecca Haines) and Megan into trouble when he sells them some `vitamins'.""The Cover-Up"" - Joey discovers that Rick (Craig Driscoll) gets beaten up by his father.""The Great Race"" - Melanie bemoans the fact that she's flat-chested and joins LD (Amanda Cook) in some bra-shopping.  The girls challenge the boys to a swimming competition.""Rumor Has It"" - Kathleen starts spreading the vicious lie that Miss Avery (Michelle Goodeve)  is a lesbian, and Caitlin considers her own sexual orientation.""The Best Laid Plans"" - Wheels musters up the courage to accompany Stephanie on a date...but will they or won't they?...""Nothing to Fear"" - LD's life turns upside down when her father has to go to hospital, stirring up a lot of old memories about her mother's death.""What a Night"" - Voula discovers why Lucy's (Anais Granofsky) wardrobe is so stylish.  When the two are arrested shoplifting, Voula's relationship with her father becomes even more strained.""Smokescreen"" - Rick starts taking an interest in the school environmental group, and Caitlin decides to take him under her wing.""It's Late!"" - Spike's period is late, following a night of recklessness with Shane (Bill Parrott).""Parents' Night"" - Wheels must confront a lot of old demons when his birth father shows up virtually out of the blue.""Revolution"" - In order to get Wheels' attention, Stephanie appoints Joey as the new Sports Rep., despite the fact that he's completely wrong for the job (it's a 7th grade post and Yick's dream job).  The 7th grade starts a revolt on Miss Stephanie Kaye...which may end in her downfall as School President.  This episode also marked the official debut of The Zit Remedy, Degrassi's legendary rock band sensation!For it's legion of 80s' fans who used to race home from school every afternoon for their daily dose of DEGRASSI drama, knowing the series is now on DVD is a dream come true.",5,a fantastic trip back to the 80s...,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,3312,"['Everyone', 'favourite', 'angst-ridden', 'teens', 'finally', 'come', 'DVD', 'DEGRASSI', 'JUNIOR', 'HIGH.All', '13', 'episodes', 'groundbreaking', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'featured', 'set', 'series', 'was', 'bold', 'spinoff', 'short-lived', 'afterschool', 'series', 'THE', 'KIDS', 'OF', 'DEGRASSI', 'STREET', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'approached', 'topics', 'peer', 'pressure', 'teen', 'violence', 'suicide', 'sex', 'pregnancy', 'well-written', 'intelligent', 'storylines', 'series', '15', 'years', 'later', 'quality', 'television', 'pre-teens', 'teens', 'sets', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'writing', 'amazing', 'acting', 'talented', 'cast', 'up', 'well', 'repeat', 'screenings.Season', 'One', 'most-loved', 'characters', 'Caitlin', 'Stacie', 'Mistysyn', 'Yick', 'Siluck', 'Saysanasy', 'Wheels', 'Neil', 'Hope', 'Melanie', 'Sara', 'Ballingall', 'Joey', 'Jeremiah', 'Pat', 'Mastroianni', 'Spike', 'Amanda', 'Stepto', 'Stephanie', 'Kaye', 'Nicole', 'Stoffman', 'Snake', 'Stefan', 'Brogren', 'included', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Steph', 'Stephanie', 'Kaye', 'use', 'newfound', 'popularity', 'run', 'School', 'President', 'personally', 'ensuring', 'male', 'vote', 'school', 'using', 'brainy', 'best', 'friend', 'Voula', 'Niki', 'Kemeny', 'run', 'campaign', 'Big', 'Dance', 'time', 'annual', 'Fall', 'Dance', 'Voula', 'father', 'forbidden', 'attend', 'Stephanie', 'drunk', 'Lucy', 'house', 'barely', 'event', 'Experiment', 'Yick', 'Arthur', 'Duncan', 'Waugh', 'try', 'out', 'basketball', 'team', 'Joey', 'Kathleen', 'Rebecca', 'Haines', 'Megan', 'trouble', 'when', 'vitamins', 'Cover-Up', 'Joey', 'Rick', 'Craig', 'Driscoll', 'beaten', 'up', 'father', 'Great', 'Race', 'Melanie', 'fact', 'flat-chested', 'LD', 'Amanda', 'Cook', 'bra-shopping', 'girls', 'challenge', 'boys', 'swimming', 'competition', 'Rumor', 'Kathleen', 'spreading', 'vicious', 'lie', 'Miss', 'Avery', 'Michelle', 'Goodeve', 'lesbian', 'Caitlin', 'own', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Best', 'Laid', 'Plans', 'Wheels', 'musters', 'courage', 'accompany', 'Stephanie', 'date', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Nothing', 'Fear', 'LD', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'father', 'go', 'hospital', 'stirring', 'up', 'lot', 'old', 'memories', 'mother', 'death', 'What', 'Night', 'Voula', 'why', 'Lucy', 'Anais', 'Granofsky', 'wardrobe', 'so', 'stylish', 'When', 'two', 'are', 'arrested', 'shoplifting', 'Voula', 'relationship', 'father', 'even', 'more', 'strained', 'Smokescreen', 'Rick', 'taking', 'interest', 'school', 'environmental', 'group', 'Caitlin', 'take', 'wing', 'Late', 'Spike', 'period', 'late', 'following', 'night', 'recklessness', 'Shane', 'Bill', 'Parrott', 'Parents', 'Night', 'Wheels', 'must', 'confront', 'lot', 'old', 'demons', 'when', 'birth', 'father', 'up', 'virtually', 'blue', 'Revolution', 'order', 'get', 'Wheels', 'attention', 'Stephanie', 'Joey', 'new', 'Sports', 'Rep.', 'fact', 'completely', 'wrong', 'job', '7th', 'grade', 'post', 'Yick', 'dream', 'job', '7th', 'grade', 'revolt', 'Miss', 'Stephanie', 'Kaye', 'may', 'end', 'downfall', 'School', 'President', 'episode', 'also', 'marked', 'official', 'debut', 'Zit', 'Remedy', 'Degrassi', 'legendary', 'rock', 'band', 'sensation', 'legion', '80s', 'fans', 'who', 'used', 'race', 'home', 'school', 'afternoon', 'daily', 'dose', 'DEGRASSI', 'drama', 'knowing', 'series', 'now', 'DVD', 'dream', 'come', 'true']",Degrassi Junior High - Season 1

874334,A24DPZKZOEHHCA,B0006U3SY4,"Dawn E. Michalek ""Dawn""","[0, 0]",I watched this show as a child in the 1980's. It was thought provoking in its own right to a child of the 80's. It may not hit close to home for children of a different era but it was spot on for those of us growing up at that time. The shock of teenage pregnancy and drug/alcohol use made this show a great tool to help with growing pains. The producers and writers of this show were excellent in catching the feelings of the characters and the struggles each one endured in regular life. I can recommend this show to anyone who has the ability to look past the clothes and the dated language to the subject matter beyond it. In a few years I will let my kids watch it. The lessons learned are timeless and I will enjoy following the life of the students again and maybe have a laugh at myself and the style of clothing I grew up with. I recommend this show just based on the impact it had on my life as a pre-teen in the 80's.,4,Review from watching it on Air in 1987,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,928,"['watched', 'show', 'child', '1980', 'was', 'thought', 'provoking', 'own', 'right', 'child', '80', 'may', 'not', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'children', 'different', 'era', 'was', 'spot', 'growing', 'up', 'time', 'shock', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'drug/alcohol', 'use', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'tool', 'help', 'growing', 'pains', 'producers', 'writers', 'show', 'were', 'excellent', 'catching', 'feelings', 'characters', 'struggles', 'one', 'endured', 'regular', 'life', 'can', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'ability', 'look', 'clothes', 'dated', 'language', 'subject', 'matter', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'lessons', 'learned', 'are', 'timeless', 'will', 'enjoy', 'following', 'life', 'students', 'again', 'maybe', 'have', 'laugh', 'style', 'clothing', 'grew', 'up', 'recommend', 'show', 'just', 'based', 'impact', 'had', 'life', 'pre-teen', '80']",Degrassi Junior High - Season 1

This series featured teens that real teens could identify with. These teens dealt with real life issues like sex, dating, teen pregnancy, parental abuse, divorce, shoplifting and other serious issues were addressed in a realitic manner. This groundbreaking series has never appeared on DVD until now.All of the kids on the show were memorable characters. There was Steph, the popular girl who had her fair share of problems. There was Voula, the girl with the strict parents who wanted so badly to just fit in. Wheels has to deal with the fact that he was adopted and Lucy seems to have it all but her parents aren't there for her when she needs them. Joey, was a popular kid who was dedicated to his band. Kathleen is the quirky girl with a big crush on Snake.  L.D. is the tomboy and Caitlen is a little on the prissy and proper side.  These kids were so regular this could have been any junior high in the world.One of the most memorable storylines on the show was the relationship between Spike and Shane. These opposites attracted and as season 1 comes to a close Spike has to deal with the fact that her period is late and she may be pregnant. This story line carries on throughout the seasons. Most of the Degrassi story lines weren't completly solved in the half hour format. Each characters story was well developed and viewers wanted to keep watching. One such storyline was of Wheels and the fact that he was adopted. This storyline was very important to the series, and in one episode during season 1, Wheels comes face to face with his birth father-who also happens to be a musician.Season 1 of Degrassi Junior High arrives on three discs. Each disc is enclosed in it's own protective case. Season 1 includes 13 episodes.If you are a teen, you will enjoy taking a trip back in time to the 80's and watching how teens back then dealt with many of the issues that you may be facing today.If you are a parent or an educator now is your chance to get this groundbreaking television series on DVD. Priced much more reasonably than the VHS sets, this is an affordable collection that will be a great addition to your classroom. The picture quality is awesome and these episodes look and sound better than ever.Degrassi Junior High was spawned from the Canadian series The Kids of Degrassi Street. When Degrassi Junior High ended, Degrassi High began it's run. Degrassi is still growing strong with the popular series Degrassi-The Next Generation.The DVD also includes segments from the ""Degrassi Talks"" series.  The ""Degrassi Talks"" segments seem quited dated in comparison to the series.  The ""Degrassi Talks"" educational segments which include commentary from the shows actors and regular teens touch on subjects addressed in the show like drugs and sexuality.

Another episode I like was when Joey found out that Rick was been beaten by his dad. The one were Spike got pregnant was also great.

Gelwasser,"[3, 4]","I'll never forget how in the late '80s, I would end each day with a snack in front of the TV, while taking in another episode of the educational, teenage soap opera, ""Degrassi Junior High"" on PBS. The show's school bell would ring and that endlessly addictive pop theme song would begin, meaning the start of another great show. Each episode would look at a single problem or issue, that confronted teenagers in our modern society. This included discussions about a variety of topics such as dating, child abuse, drugs, women's rights, teen sex, homosexuality, adoption, teen pregnancy and even the ability to just fit in. The show took place in a fictional, Canadian Junior High and showed kids from all walks of life, ethnicity and social groups. Each episode would feature an issue, while weaving together in a soap opera-ish style, the interests, problems and relationships of the large cast. Just some of the popular characters included the underachieving & sneaky, Joey Jeramiah (Pat Mastroianni), the sexually assertive school President, Stephanie (Nicole Stoffman) her nerdy little brother, Arthur (Duncan Waugh), the caring and concerned, Caitlin (Stacie Mistysin), tough guy, Rick (Craig Driscoll) rock guitarist, Snake (Stephan Brogan) and his friend and fellow bass player, Wheels (Neil Hope). The adults in their world included two teachers, the strict and rather condesending, Mr. Raditch (Dan Williams) and the  always caring, dream of a teacher, Ms. Avery (Michelle Goodeve). In the first season we are just being introduced to the many characters, episode by episode. Interesting story arcs include Stephanie becoming school President, Wheels coming to terms with adoption and meeting his biological father and most importantly, Spike finding out, that she has become pregnant. The show is far from perfect. Some of the plots strayed into ""ABC After School Special"" territory and some of dialogue didn't exactly sound realistic to the way teenagers actually talk. Also, some of the kids are a little shakey in their acting skills, sounding like they were giving stilted line readings from a 'Charlie Brown' cartoon. But this would all greatly improve in later seasons. The thing about this show is that it's both endlessly addictive and entertaining as each plot and story arc progresses. It's sort of like eating potatoe chips ... you can't just eat one. Viewing one episode, leads to the need to see the next one. This is an excellent show, that I would recommend to both teenagers and adults alike!",4,"Rrringgg!!

874342,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B0006U3SY4,Kevin Caffrey,"[4, 5]","Where oh where to begin!  When ""Degrassi Junior High"" first came out in the late 80s, I was about 11 and loved it for the fact that the actors were real kids.  Add that to the fact that the budget for this show had to be miniscule at best--it was truly a guilty pleasure.  However, the show *did* portray everyday tween/teenager problems in a realistic, if sometimes heavy-handed, way.  And even though at times the viewer feels like they're watching something from a movie that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" would be lampooning, the messages of ""Degrassi Junior High"" resonate much, much more than nearly any other high school-set series (""Feaks and Geeks"" is at the top of that list).Clearly ahead of its time in trying to reach a young crowd with issues ranging from sexuality, child abuse, and teen pregnancy, ""Degrassi Junior High"" definitely contains realistic and believable situations.  The DVD set comes with teaching supplements that would be helpful for any jr.high/hs teachers that are thinking of showing episodes in class.  I give this series an A+ for having its heart in the right place and not talking down to its audience.Now--the REAL reason I enjoyed this DVD is because...man...it is SO late 80s/early 90s.  ESPECIALLY, the feature ""Degassi Talks..."" which features the cast members as themselves travelling around Canada and asking people on the street about drugs, sex, and sexuality.  I could listen to the Stacy Mistyrn-penned theme song all day long (""Degrassi talks...Degrassi listens..."").  Also a blast to watch are just the clothes, the endless abOOts, the haircuts, and the lamest teacher or all time -- Mr. Raditch.So, you can't go wrong with this DVD.  You'll appreciate its honest portrayal of 12-15 year olds, but find much to laugh at in terms of the production values and overall 80s nostalgia.
