506026,A11ETZZ75RJC1W,B00000JFBV,"Amazon Customer ""Jeffrey Sweet""","[2, 2]","HELLCAB ran for three minutes short of forever as a late-night play in Chicago.  It featured Chicago rock'n'roll acting at its best: simple set, talented ensemble playing multiple parts, juxtaposition of drama and comedy, respect for a working person's perspective.  The film retains much of this.  Yes, instead of a handful of actors constantly slipping into different skins you have a larger cast playing a series of cameos -- but these are almost all acting gems.  The cab driver becomes a representative of us in the audience: trying to make our way through a complex world without being swallowed up by it, trying to salvage moments of honor and grace in an environment oblivious to both.  Would make -- yes -- a terrific companion piece to TAXI DRIVER.",5,preserves a legendary Chicago project,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,758,"['HELLCAB', 'ran', 'three', 'minutes', 'short', 'forever', 'late-night', 'play', 'Chicago', 'featured', 'Chicago', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'acting', 'best', 'simple', 'set', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'playing', 'multiple', 'parts', 'juxtaposition', 'drama', 'comedy', 'respect', 'working', 'person', 'perspective', 'film', 'much', 'Yes', 'instead', 'handful', 'actors', 'constantly', 'slipping', 'different', 'skins', 'have', 'larger', 'cast', 'playing', 'series', 'cameos', 'are', 'almost', 'acting', 'gems', 'cab', 'driver', 'representative', 'audience', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'complex', 'world', 'being', 'swallowed', 'up', 'trying', 'salvage', 'moments', 'honor', 'grace', 'environment', 'oblivious', 'Would', 'make', 'yes', 'terrific', 'companion', 'piece', 'TAXI', 'DRIVER']",Hellcab VHS

506028,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00000JFBV,Joshua Koppel,"[3, 4]","Hellcab is an independent film based upon the play by the same name.  Unfortunately, Vidmark must have thought the title meant it was a horror film and packaged it as such.  It is not horror.The story, what little there actually is, follows a hardworking and honest cabdriver during the Winter Solstice, the day with the longest night.  A newspaper blurb points out that many cultures had believed the world would be swallowed by the cold and the dark.The driver starts his day early by taking a family to church (on Thursday).  After they try to convert him, his day progresses through high and lows and gives glimpses into the lives of dozens of colorful characters.  From a pregnant woman, to a drunk lady who says she loves him; from druggies to lawyers; from jerks to generally nice people.  We see all kinds climb into this cab.But all is not rosy on this darkest of days.  Many issues are looked at, especially racism.  At one point the driver becomes scared of the South Side and heads North only to pick up a white guy who is his scariest customer of the day.  But in the end, when he at what might be his lowest, the driver takes a fare from a man who offers him some sound advice.Paul Dillon shines as the cabdriver.  His excellent performance is backed up by such talents as Gillian Anderson, John Cusack, Michael Ironsides, Laurie Metcalf and Julianne Moore.  While sometimes disturbing and sometimes touching, this is not a film you will forget.",4,AKA Chicago Cab,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,1459,"['Hellcab', 'independent', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Unfortunately', 'Vidmark', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'title', 'meant', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'packaged', 'such', 'not', 'horror.The', 'story', 'what', 'little', 'actually', 'hardworking', 'honest', 'cabdriver', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'day', 'longest', 'night', 'newspaper', 'blurb', 'points', 'out', 'many', 'cultures', 'had', 'believed', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'swallowed', 'cold', 'dark.The', 'driver', 'day', 'early', 'taking', 'family', 'church', 'Thursday', 'try', 'convert', 'day', 'high', 'lows', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'dozens', 'colorful', 'characters', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'drunk', 'lady', 'who', 'druggies', 'lawyers', 'jerks', 'generally', 'nice', 'people', 'see', 'kinds', 'climb', 'cab.But', 'not', 'rosy', 'darkest', 'days', 'Many', 'issues', 'are', 'looked', 'especially', 'racism', 'one', 'point', 'driver', 'scared', 'South', 'Side', 'heads', 'North', 'only', 'pick', 'up', 'white', 'guy', 'who', 'scariest', 'customer', 'day', 'end', 'when', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'lowest', 'driver', 'fare', 'man', 'who', 'sound', 'Dillon', 'shines', 'cabdriver', 'excellent', 'performance', 'backed', 'up', 'such', 'talents', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Michael', 'Ironsides', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'forget']",Hellcab VHS

506030,A1AIJX4W864HIY,B00000JFBV,"""rhettbutler2""","[3, 10]","If you pick up this film expecting a horror movie, you will be disappointed.  What you will get is an artsy cameo filled flick.  HellCab follows a Chicago cab driver as he makes his rounds, picking up junkies, freaks and rape victims.  You should know that you can pick up a helluva alot of fares in an hour and a half film.  Most of the actors are on screen no more than 5 minutes and often less.  So, if you see Gillian Anderson or John Cusack on the cover and that's your reason for choosing this film, you will (again) be sadly disappointed.  At first I felt like there is no way that I will be able to stay awake long enough to see the credits roll.  But honestly, I just had to see who climbed into the cab next.  Also, I felt like all of this must tie in together somehow.  Well, it doesn't.  There is no resolution to any of the scenerios that are set up.  Worth 2 stars for the fact that I didn't just turn it off.  If you like Taxi Cab confessions, you may get some enjoyment out of this, but its different since you don't truly feel like a voyeur.",2,"I'm repulsed, but I can't look away",973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,1058,"['pick', 'up', 'film', 'expecting', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'artsy', 'cameo', 'filled', 'flick', 'HellCab', 'Chicago', 'cab', 'driver', 'rounds', 'picking', 'up', 'junkies', 'freaks', 'rape', 'victims', 'should', 'know', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'helluva', 'alot', 'fares', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'screen', 'more', '5', 'minutes', 'often', 'less', 'So', 'see', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Cusack', 'cover', 'reason', 'choosing', 'film', 'will', 'again', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'first', 'felt', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'awake', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'credits', 'roll', 'honestly', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'who', 'climbed', 'cab', 'next', 'Also', 'felt', 'must', 'tie', 'together', 'somehow', 'Well', ""n't"", 'resolution', 'scenerios', 'are', 'set', 'up', '2', 'stars', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'like', 'Taxi', 'Cab', 'confessions', 'may', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'feel', 'voyeur']",Hellcab VHS
