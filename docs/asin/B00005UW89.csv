The love story is kept clean and the background is so authentically done that one really feels like it is taking place in Italy.

Based on a true story, Hallmark manages to draw us into the lives of one soldier and his attempt to avoid capture, and those who put themselves at risk to hide and protect him.  There's a love story in the midst of the hardship that encourages us to cheer the soldier on.

A choice of events of WW II are the stage for this documentary about a young British soldier, who was captivated and transported to Italy during the war, and the family who protects him from the Germans for as long as they possibly can. The communist Italians start a man hunt. The people willing to hide him in their houses are a heart warming confirmation that the people were not enemies, their governments were. The events making this story so remarkable are tumbling quickly from one scene to another, never boring and educational at the same time.

When it was released on DVD I had to have it (my wife likes love stories). After my second veiwing I noticed more drama and action than before (which I like). The third veiwing I noticed great comedy. ' In Love and War', which is based on actual events, has all these attributes and more. I have often felt that stories based on actual events make the best movies. 'In Love and War' is proof of this. As said earlier this movie has drama, action, comedy, and a true love story.
