754423,A2P74CBEV72PP4,B00009MECJ,H. Huang,"[1, 4]","Everything about this movie is a monstrosity.  The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line.  How does a machine/human have the ability to cry?  Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all.  Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop?  What was up in adding Star Wars into the mix?  The dual electrical weapon?  Do they really think incorporating other movie's elements would make it better?  Then how the world would you make something about the same?  15 years later, technology would be better and that would mean that improvements would be there when building another one.  How about a rocket launcher or a laser weapon?  Guess that's too smart to do.  I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on.  The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors.

754425,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00009MECJ,JRP,"[0, 0]","Now this part of the mini series is the weakest part. Anyway you kick it off with OCP being broken into by Ann R Key & her team. The Scientist Edwin has set off an alarm. Ann has hacked into the security system which sets off these laser beams & tears these SWAT guys in half. Robocop responds to the call & he takes out Ann's 2 lackies. Then he gets pwned by Ann & Robo gets own a lot in this part of the series. Also to me it feels like they didn't use much of the budget on this part of the mini series. Robo is put down by Ann then Abby goes & kicks him in the head. Sara Cable sends out the new Robocop which is what is left of John Cable. The President of OCP is leaving Robo Cable comes drags her out of the limo along with her driver. Robo Cable's look is bada  s  s it's the same look as Robocop but it has a metallic, crome, Platinum shine to it. He also has 2 guns & 2 targeting systems. OCP recalls Robocop on Media Net there running stories on The Robocop Recall & there is this kid upset that Robocop beat him up & totaled his Dad's car. He says sorry Dad it's not my fault. I failed to mention that Media Net replaced Media Brake. The commercials are still there too & they are funny. Robocop is at this mal or whatever it is & you have this SWAT Team open fire on Robocop he pulls out his gun & they run off he grabs that Negotiator lady that you saw at the beginning of Dark Justice. he asks her who has ordered my death she tells him that it was Sara Cable. Robo Cable comes in & he pwns Robocop. Robocop jumps out of a window escapes in his car. Then you have a pretty good chase on the ship yard which results in Robo's car flipping over & going into the river. I don't know how he survived cause Rbob's a machine wouldn't he fry in water that deep. I'll give it the pass. Robocop ends up in Old Detroit. He is trying to get this chip where he can contact Cable. Then you are introdunced to Ann R Key's daughter Jordan. I have a little nit pick that Ann doesn't keep an eye on her daughter. Anyway the kid goes with Robocop to the old Metro South PD. Then he is attacked by Ann with that tazer thing. Keep an eye on your kid b  i  t  c  h! Now by this point Damien has sent in a Rehab Team to take down Robocop. Cable finds Robo & Robo gets owned some more Robocop fights back a little he tries to tell him that he's a man not a machine. So Cbale just stands there remebering. Jordan went back to get a toy that she had left behind. Roboccop tells her that she needs to get out of here when she shows up. Then you have a bunch of Rehabs show up Robocop guns a lot of them down & there's no blood at all CGI or squibs. It felt like they were just saving the money for bigger action set pieces. Anyway Robo gets shot with these electrical weapons. Ann R Key comes in she fights The Rehabs decent fights. Until she gets shot with 1 of the electrical weapons. When Robo shoots 1 The Rehabs the electrical weapon he was firing hits Jordan. I didn't like the slow mo in this scene at all Julian Grant used it way too much & it felt melodramatic. Cable who was just standing there finally takes some action he fightsThe Rehabs & helps Robo up. The Rehab Commander runs off. Damien Lowe was fired cause he sent The Rehab Team in without OCP's permission. Damien goes to the basement tells Edwin to go home & he has SAINT lock the doors to the board room & kill The OCP Board. James Murphy finds out that his Father is Robocop. It goes back to Murphy & Cable. Robo says that they will come looking for us. It might have sounded like I am ranting I'm not but this part is the weakest part of the mini series. But the next I'll get into the 3rd part of The Prime Directives Mini Series Resurrection.",4,Robocop Prime Directives review 7.5/10 Meltdown,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3708,"['Now', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'weakest', 'part', 'Anyway', 'kick', 'off', 'OCP', 'being', 'broken', 'Ann', 'R', 'Key', 'team', 'Scientist', 'Edwin', 'set', 'off', 'alarm', 'Ann', 'hacked', 'security', 'system', 'laser', 'beams', 'tears', 'SWAT', 'guys', 'half', 'Robocop', 'call', 'out', 'Ann', '2', 'lackies', 'Then', 'pwned', 'Ann', 'Robo', 'own', 'lot', 'part', 'series', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'much', 'budget', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'Robo', 'put', 'down', 'Ann', 'then', 'Abby', 'head', 'Sara', 'Cable', 'out', 'new', 'Robocop', 'what', 'left', 'John', 'Cable', 'President', 'OCP', 'leaving', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'drags', 'limo', 'driver', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'look', 'bada', 's', 's', 'same', 'look', 'Robocop', 'metallic', 'crome', 'Platinum', 'shine', 'also', '2', 'guns', '2', 'targeting', 'systems', 'OCP', 'Robocop', 'Media', 'Net', 'running', 'stories', 'Robocop', 'Recall', 'kid', 'Robocop', 'beat', 'up', 'totaled', 'Dad', 'car', 'sorry', 'Dad', 'not', 'fault', 'failed', 'mention', 'Media', 'Net', 'replaced', 'Media', 'Brake', 'commercials', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'too', 'are', 'funny', 'Robocop', 'mal', 'whatever', 'have', 'SWAT', 'Team', 'open', 'fire', 'Robocop', 'out', 'gun', 'run', 'Negotiator', 'lady', 'saw', 'beginning', 'Dark', 'Justice', 'who', 'ordered', 'death', 'was', 'Sara', 'Cable', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'Robocop', 'Robocop', 'window', 'car', 'Then', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'chase', 'ship', 'yard', 'results', 'Robo', 'car', 'flipping', 'going', 'river', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'survived', 'cause', 'Rbob', 'machine', 'would', ""n't"", 'fry', 'water', 'deep', ""'ll"", 'give', 'pass', 'Robocop', 'up', 'Old', 'Detroit', 'trying', 'get', 'chip', 'where', 'can', 'contact', 'Cable', 'Then', 'are', 'introdunced', 'Ann', 'R', 'Key', 'daughter', 'Jordan', 'have', 'little', 'nit', 'pick', 'Ann', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eye', 'daughter', 'Anyway', 'kid', 'Robocop', 'old', 'Metro', 'South', 'PD', 'Then', 'attacked', 'Ann', 'tazer', 'thing', 'Keep', 'eye', 'kid', 'b', 'i', 't', 'c', 'h', 'Now', 'point', 'Damien', 'sent', 'Rehab', 'Team', 'take', 'down', 'Robocop', 'Cable', 'Robo', 'Robo', 'owned', 'more', 'Robocop', 'fights', 'back', 'little', 'tell', 'man', 'not', 'machine', 'So', 'Cbale', 'just', 'there', 'remebering', 'Jordan', 'went', 'back', 'get', 'toy', 'had', 'left', 'behind', 'Roboccop', 'get', 'here', 'when', 'up', 'Then', 'have', 'bunch', 'Rehabs', 'show', 'up', 'Robocop', 'lot', 'down', 'blood', 'CGI', 'squibs', 'felt', 'were', 'just', 'saving', 'money', 'bigger', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'Anyway', 'Robo', 'shot', 'electrical', 'weapons', 'Ann', 'R', 'Key', 'Rehabs', 'decent', 'fights', 'shot', '1', 'electrical', 'weapons', 'When', 'Robo', '1', 'Rehabs', 'electrical', 'weapon', 'was', 'firing', 'hits', 'Jordan', 'did', ""n't"", 'slow', 'mo', 'scene', 'Julian', 'Grant', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'felt', 'melodramatic', 'Cable', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'finally', 'action', 'Rehabs', 'Robo', 'up', 'Rehab', 'Commander', 'Damien', 'Lowe', 'was', 'fired', 'cause', 'sent', 'Rehab', 'Team', 'OCP', 'permission', 'Damien', 'basement', 'Edwin', 'go', 'home', 'SAINT', 'doors', 'board', 'room', 'kill', 'OCP', 'Board', 'James', 'Murphy', 'out', 'Father', 'Robocop', 'back', 'Murphy', 'Cable', 'Robo', 'will', 'come', 'looking', 'might', 'have', 'sounded', 'am', 'ranting', ""'m"", 'not', 'part', 'weakest', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'next', ""'ll"", 'get', '3rd', 'part', 'Prime', 'Directives', 'Mini', 'Series', 'Resurrection']",RoboCop: Prime Directives - Meltdown
