I have to admit and preface though, I'm completely fascinated by all things Polynesia, including the various cultures.  If you don't share this interest, you might not enjoy. In short, the movie tells the story of 4 Samoan guys (living in New Zealand) who are part of a large, yet intensely tight Samoan community.  These 4 guys are playful, yet ignorant to the effect their antics have on their families, which leads to them being banned (by the community elder/priest) from attending any future weddings.  The rest of the movie revolves around them trying be good, find girlfriends and thereby regain permission.If I weren't so interested in all things Polynesia, I'd probably say the acting and story are subpar.  In actuality, they are, but in my experience, one element that a viewer finds intriguing can be enough to turn a would-be failure into a personal favorite.  Not sure this is a would-be failure, but its certainly not an outstanding movie.  Nonetheless, there are some very funny moments and some actually heart touching ones as well, all done within Samoan culture.  If any of this sounds appealing, you might like.",4,"Cutely entertaining, but probably need to be into polynesian culture to enjoy",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1210,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'discovered', 'did', 'really', 'few', 'watchings', 'have', 'admit', 'preface', ""'m"", 'completely', 'fascinated', 'things', 'Polynesia', 'including', 'various', 'cultures', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'interest', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'short', 'movie', 'story', '4', 'Samoan', 'guys', 'living', 'New', 'Zealand', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'large', 'yet', 'intensely', 'tight', 'Samoan', 'community', '4', 'guys', 'are', 'playful', 'yet', 'ignorant', 'effect', 'antics', 'have', 'families', 'being', 'banned', 'community', 'elder/priest', 'attending', 'future', 'weddings', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'find', 'girlfriends', 'thereby', 'regain', 'permission.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'interested', 'things', 'Polynesia', ""'d"", 'probably', 'say', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'subpar', 'actuality', 'are', 'experience', 'one', 'element', 'viewer', 'finds', 'intriguing', 'can', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'would-be', 'failure', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Not', 'sure', 'would-be', 'failure', 'certainly', 'not', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'actually', 'heart', 'touching', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'Samoan', 'culture', 'appealing', 'might', 'like']",Samoan Wedding

He has decided that he does not want his brother Michael, and his three party-boys mates, to attend.They have nearly ruined every wedding they have attended. But they are given a chance to attend - they must bring real girl-friends,not party-girls, to the wedding and they have one month to pull it together. This comedy set in Auckland about first generation SamoanNew Zealanders, starts a bit slow, but by the time of the wedding, it gains speed and really becomes the urban romantic comedy it ismeant to be. If you are not Samoan, nor familiar with Samoan New Zealanders, you might not appreciate the inside humour, butthe writing and acting is good enough to make this light-hearted romp a winner for most.

1039656,AG0U4ASWBUWVJ,B000LP5D7Y,Lee McQueen,"[1, 1]","Samoan Wedding for this North American female created an interesting contrast to Once Were Warriors. Both movies provided a much-needed slice-of-life look at New Zealand culture as lived by those descended from natives of the island. Like Rabbit-Proof Fence does for Australia, these two movies alert the rest of the world that there's more Down Under than Guy Pierce, Nicole Kidman, and Russel Crowe.Once Were Warriors is a heavy-hitting drama whereas Samoan Wedding is romantic comedy.Important to the film is a careful mixture of personalities, family dynamics, and maturity levels to guard against stereotype.Surprising is the close similarities between Samoan culture and African American culture. Those who've seen and enjoyed The Brothers (2001), The Best Man (1999), and The Wood (1999) will enjoy Samoan Wedding.",4,Reminds Me,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,821,"['Samoan', 'Wedding', 'North', 'American', 'female', 'created', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'movies', 'provided', 'much-needed', 'slice-of-life', 'look', 'New', 'Zealand', 'culture', 'lived', 'descended', 'natives', 'island', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'Australia', 'two', 'movies', 'alert', 'rest', 'world', 'more', 'Down', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Russel', 'Crowe.Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'heavy-hitting', 'drama', 'Samoan', 'Wedding', 'romantic', 'comedy.Important', 'film', 'careful', 'mixture', 'personalities', 'family', 'dynamics', 'maturity', 'levels', 'guard', 'stereotype.Surprising', 'close', 'similarities', 'Samoan', 'culture', 'African', 'American', 'culture', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'Brothers', '2001', 'Best', 'Man', '1999', 'Wood', '1999', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Samoan', 'Wedding']",Samoan Wedding
