Poor Hawk is relegated to bumbling comedy relief, others are just drawn badly and you're thankful when characters don't appear as it means they are safe from this terror. BUT, its the only chance you'll have to watch certain characters in action.  The Eco Force episodes are a welcome relief as not only are they not butchered, but those are good episodes.

This was not produced by Sunbow, but DiC and it shows in the animation quality. Also to be noted is the change in voice cast that took place. It also focuses on new characters for the most part. A few original characters are left including General Hawk, Duke, Storm Shadow, Snake Eyes, Cobra Commander, and Destro.Gone is the familiar ""A Real American Hero"" theme song, which is replaced by one that mentions America once instead of several times. The ""A Real American Hero"" tagline is missing from the show's logo as well. This was obviously done to sell the show easier to other countries.The picture quality is probably the best Shout Factory could get using the original video source material. It still looks a lot better than any video cassette copies enthusiasts have been watching up until now. The audio is mono but has good clarity.

The animation is not as comic book-like/detailed, all voice actors (except Cobra Commander's) have changed. Characters have came and gone,ect... I was born in 1980...So I grew up to where I was able to enjoy both series. The DIC series offers some interesting/different characters. It offers the Ninja Force (which Storm Shadow is on the Joe's side),Eco Warriors (a group w/ Flint in charge, taking on polution & a toxic sludge group ran by a guy name Sess Pool), a drug lord which Cobra & the Joes team up to defeat! They have added a more humorous side to the G.I. Joe series too. General Hawk has been dumbed down & clumsy often throughout the series. There are 20 episodes in this season. The quality definitely shows it's age a bit. But on this DVD it's definitely quite a bit better than VHS versions,recorded episodes on VHS, or even bootlegs! I bought a bootleg complete DIC set for $20.00 2 & a half years ago (before the real DIC DVD's were out). And though the bootleg version wasn't horrible (it was VHS quality) this is better for sure!!!! I recommend this DVD to anyone that liked the DIC series. Anyone that's interested in it. Or someone trying to complete their Joe collection. The DIC Joe series has mixed reviews. Many people that grew up with the older Sunbow series don't really like this one.
