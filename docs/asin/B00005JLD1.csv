It seems to me that we must have been watching a different movie.  As &quot;implausable&quot; and &quot;unrealistic&quot; as Pumpkin seemed to be in the views of some of the other reviewers, I found a humourous delicate black comedy that pokes at the world of self obsorbtion and arrogance.Christina Ricci known for her bold choices in her career and for her ability as an actress plays the main character Carolyn-  A sorority sister dating a very popular and &quot;studly&quot; tennis star at a major college in southern california.  What more could a girl ask for?  What could be more perfect?  To Carolyn this was perfection, outside of her competition with a neighboring sorority, life couldn't get any better.All of this is portrayed in the movie with tongue and cheek glee (think Brady Bunch mixed with 90210).  Carolyn's life is turned upside down when she meets up with Pumpkin, a mentally challenged young man who is emmidiatly smitten with her.  Carolyn resents her own feelings towards him but eventually she realizes they are &quot;soul mates&quot;.The rest of the movie is about these two very different people finding love with eachother- or so it seems.  This is the cleaver part- the story is a twist on all of those sappy &quot;our-love-will-heal-the-world&quot; Cinderella type stories.  The director leads the viewer up to the very end dabbing cliches here and there to keep the viewer assuming, but then, subtly there is a twist- and then the end.The movie is a success on many levels- and for me it did what I always look for art to do- entertain and provoke.

This story is about a sorority girl who has what some people would percieve as the perfect life until she meets a mentally retarded boy named pumpkin who is creative open and sweet- nothing like her boyfriend. She ends up falling in love with pumpkin and then her life starts to fall apart and everyone is against thier relationship because of the sterotypes that go along with a girl like her being with a retarded boy. She can see how special pumpkin is and how creative and open he is and how much he really loves her back -even though hes retarded he knows how to show his feelings for her in many creative and thoughful ways. Her life starts to fall apart and she becomes the outkast because she follows her heart and decides to go with pumpkin. The problem i have with this movie is the way it made fun of itself - i didnt know what to think at times, i liked the story but some parts were strange like the fight scene but like i said the movie was making fun of itself- i got the point.

I wanted to be enraged and get pissed off by the treatment of the disabled people shown during Pumpkin, especially it was a major Hollywood film. But there is no use of that. Simply, I've ranked the film as third worst film I've seen in my life. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Pumpkin. The use of the word ""retarded"" thrown around freely was inappropriate. When the boy challenged the young man with mental retardation, I was astounded to see no chaperones present in the ring although there were some present, prior to the fight, in the dance. I read the comments on the DVD cover and that the film was ""hysterically funny."" Excuse me, what's so funny about the mistreatment of the disabled? Exactly what in the film was funny? I was thoroughly appalled and insulted. Admittedly, I am no expert of people when it comes to mental retardation, but I don't sincerely believe many of them acted correctly. But I know disabled. Pumpkin makes a total mockery of this inclusive population. Coming from my experience of working with challenged people, especially the ones who were emotionally disturbed, it was the most fun period of my life; I've always looked back to my time with them the most satisfying. Yet when I saw in the introduction of Pumpkin, they are portrayed as zombies from Night of the Living Dead? Is that the most accurate view? Of course, pretty girls do work with challenged people, but that doesn't mean that sexual affairs emerge out of them consensually. Of course, it could happen, but that's purely restricted to the point of view in terms of illegal teacher-student relationships. When they, although rarely, occur, the students and challenged people (that are incapable of understanding sex) are the ones that are being taken advantage of. I actually don't want to get political and philosophical further at this point. I am just saying, it's immorally wrong and unethical. Why is it that nearly every scene with Christina Ricci has her tits bulging out through her clothes? I can't imagine Kent Woodlands surviving a car crash like that, and if he did jump out of the car before it went off the cliff, then I can't believe the intactness of his facial features. All in all, Pumpkin is a blatantly offensive, insensitive picture, and I am more shocked that people thought Pumpkin was great. I've lost respect for everybody involved in the picture, most notably for Christina Ricci. Having USC and sororities in the mix for Pumpkin gave me a very low opinion of both.

Pumpkin begins with the arrival of Carolyn McDuffy, played by a blonde Christina Ricci, to her sorority house of Alpha Omega Pi at the start of her senior year.Julie, played by Marisa Coughlan, is the head of the sorority with the intent on winning the Sorority of the year, known throughout the movie as SOY. The sorority that beat them out last year consists of tall blonde beauties so she decides to impress the Greek Council by picking as the charity a group of mentally challenged athletes from Riverside that are competing for the Challenged Games, comparable to Special Olympics.The thought of being paired up with a retarded type person freaks Carolyn out as well as some of the other sorority sisters. It just so happens the guy she is to mentor arrives off the school bus riding in a wheelchair with her photo, seeking her out. Their first few practices on the field are not comfortable for Carolyn, as she cannot understand what Pumpkin, played by Mark Harris, is trying to say. It seems to affect her because she cannot get in bed with her boyfriend, Kent who is the star tennis player for USCS. The pairing of these two did not work well for me, it seemed more comical at times and he came off as pathetic with no redeeming qualities.The casting for Pumpkin was superb as I immediately took a liking to him having no previous knowledge of this actor until I prepared for this review and read his bio. The roles of the mothers for both Pumpkin and Carolyn were excellent, and they both really had no clue to their children and their personalities. It seemed Carolyn's mother expected her to be a certain way and not have friends that were the slightest bit different. Pumpkin's mother seemed to think he could not amount to much besides winning the Challenging Games and seemed surprised that he could stand instead of sitting in his wheelchair.Carolyn is confused with the feelings she is starting to have for Pumpkin and how she and Kent are going off in different directions. Pumpkin told her she was the smartest person he knew. Carolyn had never heard this before from those that cared for her and it got her thinking about life. She starts to feel pain for the first time in her perfect life and compares it to a shattered mirror. Carolyn admires Pumpkin for being able to handle pain and to feel happy despite his obstacles.Each time she lies in her bed she pulls out of a drawer a photo of Pumpkin and then adds to the drawer a drawing he did of her looking at the stars and moon. He is starting to affect her in many ways and that becomes clear over the course of time in the movie Pumpkin.Pumpkin explores a girl who thought she had the perfect life until she met an extraordinary guy that showed her what happiness was from the inside. She had to leave town for Long Beach first before she realized she could accept him into her life. There are some interesting moments with Carolyn and other students that happen to be the other sorority members and ones from hers in a class that is about poetry. She also sees a counselor to discuss how she can stop falling in love with someone she does not want to have a sexual relationship with.One thing that I found lacking was no mention of employment opportunities for these college seniors and where they were headed once they graduated. It seemed to focus more on beating the other sorority and winning the Challenged Games. The music fit along with the darkness at times of the movie, perhaps getting a bit louder than I had expected. This runs almost two hours and at one point you might think the movie is over but things turn for the worse for Kent, who seems to be jealous of Pumpkin and unable to let go of Carolyn.",4,Pumpkin is beautiful on the inside,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,3771,"['Christina', 'Ricci', 'performance', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'accurately', 'showcased', 'Pumpkin', 'arrival', 'Carolyn', 'McDuffy', 'played', 'blonde', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'sorority', 'house', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'Pi', 'start', 'senior', 'year.Julie', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Coughlan', 'head', 'sorority', 'intent', 'winning', 'Sorority', 'year', 'known', 'movie', 'SOY', 'sorority', 'beat', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'tall', 'blonde', 'beauties', 'impress', 'Greek', 'Council', 'picking', 'charity', 'group', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'athletes', 'Riverside', 'are', 'competing', 'Challenged', 'Games', 'comparable', 'Special', 'Olympics.The', 'thought', 'being', 'paired', 'up', 'retarded', 'type', 'person', 'freaks', 'Carolyn', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'just', 'so', 'guy', 'mentor', 'arrives', 'school', 'bus', 'riding', 'wheelchair', 'photo', 'seeking', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'practices', 'field', 'are', 'not', 'comfortable', 'Carolyn', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'Pumpkin', 'played', 'Mark', 'Harris', 'trying', 'say', 'affect', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'bed', 'boyfriend', 'Kent', 'who', 'star', 'tennis', 'player', 'USCS', 'pairing', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'seemed', 'more', 'comical', 'times', 'came', 'off', 'pathetic', 'redeeming', 'qualities.The', 'casting', 'Pumpkin', 'was', 'superb', 'immediately', 'took', 'liking', 'having', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'actor', 'prepared', 'review', 'read', 'bio', 'roles', 'mothers', 'Pumpkin', 'Carolyn', 'were', 'excellent', 'really', 'had', 'clue', 'children', 'personalities', 'seemed', 'Carolyn', 'mother', 'expected', 'be', 'certain', 'way', 'not', 'have', 'friends', 'were', 'slightest', 'bit', 'different', 'Pumpkin', 'mother', 'seemed', 'think', 'could', 'not', 'amount', 'much', 'winning', 'Challenging', 'Games', 'seemed', 'surprised', 'could', 'stand', 'instead', 'sitting', 'wheelchair.Carolyn', 'confused', 'feelings', 'starting', 'have', 'Pumpkin', 'how', 'Kent', 'are', 'going', 'off', 'different', 'directions', 'Pumpkin', 'told', 'was', 'smartest', 'person', 'knew', 'Carolyn', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'cared', 'got', 'thinking', 'life', 'feel', 'pain', 'first', 'time', 'perfect', 'life', 'shattered', 'mirror', 'Carolyn', 'Pumpkin', 'being', 'able', 'handle', 'pain', 'feel', 'happy', 'obstacles.Each', 'time', 'bed', 'drawer', 'photo', 'Pumpkin', 'then', 'drawer', 'drawing', 'did', 'looking', 'stars', 'moon', 'starting', 'affect', 'many', 'ways', 'clear', 'course', 'time', 'movie', 'Pumpkin.Pumpkin', 'girl', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'perfect', 'life', 'met', 'extraordinary', 'guy', 'showed', 'what', 'happiness', 'was', 'inside', 'had', 'leave', 'town', 'Long', 'Beach', 'first', 'realized', 'could', 'accept', 'life', 'are', 'interesting', 'moments', 'Carolyn', 'other', 'students', 'happen', 'be', 'other', 'sorority', 'members', 'ones', 'hers', 'class', 'poetry', 'also', 'counselor', 'discuss', 'how', 'can', 'stop', 'falling', 'love', 'someone', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'with.One', 'thing', 'found', 'lacking', 'was', 'mention', 'employment', 'opportunities', 'college', 'seniors', 'where', 'were', 'headed', 'once', 'graduated', 'seemed', 'focus', 'more', 'beating', 'other', 'sorority', 'winning', 'Challenged', 'Games', 'music', 'fit', 'darkness', 'times', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'getting', 'bit', 'louder', 'had', 'expected', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'point', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'things', 'turn', 'worse', 'Kent', 'who', 'be', 'jealous', 'Pumpkin', 'unable', 'let', 'go', 'Carolyn']",N/A

The second thing was that this was the best movie I've seen in a while.

She has made big budget films (Addams Family, Sleepy Hollow) and smaller independent films (The Opposite of Sex).  In all her roles, she is always intriguing and fun to watch.

This is the most bizarrely surreal film I've ever seen and I don't mean that in a good way.Here's the scoop. Christina Ricci plays a rich-ish co-ed at U.S.C. Her sorority always comes in 2nd in the 'soroity of the year' awards. This year, to bolster p.r., the sorority agrees to help 'challenged' athletes. most of the girls are somewhat aghast but agree to do it. Christina takes charge helping ""Pumpkin"" who is mentally challenged, is in a wheelchair and has an over-protective mom. At first she's put off and thinks she can't handle it. But she comes to like, then love him. This causes big problems for everyone, including her tennis star, Christian boyfriend. Everything explodes and Ricci manages the situation as best she can.This is simply unbelievable. How Coppola put his name on this is beyond me. Were the writer and directors related to him? When the movie starts out the set-up is fairly obvious. You're introduced to some smarmy trust-fund brats who never go deeper than appearances. It's all played very tongue in cheek. Then it moves into the meat of the matter and, either they tried, unsuccessfully, to keep the tongue in cheek, or simply didn't know how to play it. Stuff happens in the first act that shouldn't, given the set-up, happen until way into the second act. It was so rushed I thought a lot of scenes might have been edited out. I thought Hank Harris, as Pumpkin, was simply awful. Some of the characters didn't stay true to themselves throughout the proceedings. Kent's character, Ricci's boyfriend, does something so weird near the end of the film you could feel the writer's hand descending. This is also an early effort for Melissa McCarthy whom I like very much. Here she is a pivotal character in the proceedings and they simply drop her. They make no effort to resolve her situation with Ricci. Simply incomprehensible.I could go on but why bother? All I can say is this is so surreal, I simply cannot imagine what was going on with this project. But let it be noted that this was made in 2002 and neither the writer or directors has worked since.

Driscoll,"[7, 8]","Carolyn McDuffy (Christina Ricci) is a girl who assists her sorority by helping a bunch of mentally challenged adults for the ""Challenged Games"".  Carolyn's training partner is Pumpkin Romanoff.  The sheltered and superficial Carolyn is not used to situations like this and she often violates social norms and offends people without even realizing why certain actions and comments would be offensive.  Unlike her sorority sisters, Carolyn has a good heart but she is still ignorant enough that she doesn't automatically earn any respect from the film's audience.  She is a unique character that conveniently slips under our radar as such.  At first apprehensive about dealing with Pumpkin, Carolyn soon comes to the realization that Pumpkin is at least genuine, which is completely unlike anyone else in her world, especially the girls in her sorority.  Carolyn falls deeply in love with Pumpkin.  This has a dramatic effect on the lives of both Carolyn and Pumpkin and that is essentially what this film focuses on.Christina Ricci is almost always great in anything she has ever done.  She takes on unique roles for the most part and only surfaces up to the mainstream in flashes these days. Pumpkin is not a mainstream film as it was hardly even released in the United States.  Unfortunately it is roles like this that can showcase just how talented Ricci really is.  Making characters we are not supposed to like enjoyable and entertaining is when she is at her best.  Hank Harris plays Pumpkin and does a great job at a kind of role that is easy to compliment in most films, but he somehow manages to make Pumpkin fit appropriately even in this unusual environment.  Brenda Blethyn plays Pumpkin's mother and is outstanding as always.Pumpkin's overtones are primarily pretty serious ones in the way of a Romeo and Juliet kind of story.  So why is this comedy?  Why should we be laughing?  Answering that honestly may extort some guilt but don't worry, you're not alone.  That does not however make Pumpkin any less bold in its basic storyline and it is probably even bolder in its very existence as a comedy.  Few films are as dry and demented as this.  I couldn't help but think of Todd Solondz's Storytelling and Happiness while I watched Pumpkin.  It seemed to contain the same provoking elements and bizarre dark humor.  I never thought that was possible again after seeing Happiness but here it is. Perhaps Solondz is an influence.

Unfortunately, these relatively short lived insights are completely overwhelmed by poor plot development, shallow characterization, and a general aimlessness in the movie's construction.  Although grounded in an interesting and thought provoking idea, the story just doesn't really do anything except for play around with people's common conceptions and stereotypes.  The potential was there...but directors Broder and Adams appear to have never actually thought it through.To be fair, Christina Ricci's acting chops are excellent in her portrayal of Carolyn McDuffy, an incredibly naive debutante experiencing her first realizations that the world just isn't fair (just remember that this is satire, and not a serious story).  The character of Pumpkin, while convincingly played by Hank Harris, is poorly written, with the level of his ""disability"" jumping haphazardly, at times being only mildly speech impaired, and at others being fully semi-comatose.

It was a unique comedy concept then, but why drag it out now once again?  They should have just called this REVENGE OF THE NERDS 5: CHANGE OF HEART and strapped Anthony Edwards or Robert Carradine into that wheelchair, had them acting autistic.  Christina Ricci's boyfriend Kent here is obviously based on Ted McGinley's ""Stan Gable"" (""Those nerds are a threat to our way of life!""

Christina Ricci has played in a number of unusual films from the ""Adams Family"" to ""Casper.""  This performance is another that pushes her boundaries.  She does a great job as the self-centered sorority woman who thinks that working with the handicapped would be yucky.  Somehow, after meeting Pumpkin, her mind does a 180-degree turn to where she is now an advocate for the mentally retarded.  One of the flaws in the picture is that Pumpkin Romanoff as played by Hank Harris may have some eccentricities, but he hardly seems profoundly retarded.  As he seeks to impress Ricci's Carolyn, he starts walking and throwing a discus.  We're expected to believe he was sitting around all those years waiting to get motivated?  On the other hand, I did appreciate that it demonstrates that the mentally retarded have hormones just like regular folk.  As Carolyn's boyfriend Kent, Sam Ball is a handsome hunk who can fly over a cliff in car that bursts into flames and come out with only a spinal chord injury.  As the sorority sister who is put off by the retarded, Dominique Swain does a nice job & deserves a frizzy hair award.  Brenda Blethyn almost gets rid of her Irish accent as Pumpkin's mother.

Christina Ricci plays a snooty sorority girl who falls in love with a handicapped boy, much to the dismay of her family and friends.  The film does an excellent job of portraying sorority stereotypes (Ricci is ostracized from her sorority sisters when she begins socializing with a ""retard"").  Some people have criticized the movie for being ""insensitive"" toward handicapped people, and that's just not true.  It's a COMEDY, people!  A parody!  And it's HYSTERICAL!There are so many great moments in this film, such as the ""West Side Story""-esque streetfight between Pumpkin and Kent; the rival sorority house where every single skanky girl wants to sleep with Kent (and does); and poor Pumpkin being stranded on the beach for what seems like ten hours.My favorite dialogue exchange in the film:MRS.

Christina Ricci plays Carolyn, a senior in college who so far has had the illusion of life being painless.  In hopes of winning Sorority Of the Year, her house attempts to give themselves an edge by working with handicapped/ retarded atheletes.  This leads to Carolyn meeting the title character, played by Hank Harris.  Although Carolyn already has a boyfriend, Kent, she is taken by Pumpkin's tenderness and comes to find Kent shallow and unappealing by comparison.There is also some really funny stuff in here.  Harry J. Lennix in particular, who plays Carolyn's poetry teacher, really livens things up and practically steals every scene in which he appears--it's unfortunate that his part wasn't a bit bigger.""Pumpkin"" seems torn between wanting to be a touching unconventional love story and a spoof on what they call 'teen sex comedies', and it ends up suffering significantly as a result.  The most glaring example...  After building up serious momentum and interest, the movie gets to the part where Kent is involved in a catastrophic fiery car crash, and then a few moments later we see him in a hospital bed injured, but still alive and without any visible burns.  Obviously this is supposed to be funny, but it's horrendously out of whack with so much of what's come before and makes you feel like you've been taken for a sucker.Another thing that's unsettling is that the Pumpkin character tends to come across as someone who isn't really handicapped, and is only pretending to be handicapped.  In the end, it becomes clear this was an intentional move and not simply bad acting on Harris' part.The movie also loses points for using a couple of appallingly bad, lame-brained songs in the soundtrack.  What the hell were they going for with these songs, poignancy???

598234,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00005JLD1,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[8, 12]","This satire tells a truly unique tale and Christina Ricci does a wonderful acting job proving easy on the eyes.  There are some missteps along the way that keep this from rising like the Great Pumpkin on Halloween night.The portrayal of sorority life on Greek Row is a scream and gives countless fodder for satire.  The script-writer proves in-tune with what gets an audience laughing out loud.  Though the humor can be black at times, the movie does not forego a happy wrapped up ending to carry the black satire through to the end.Unlike some other reviewers, I found the use of disabled characters in the story humanizing and not at all exploitive.  Pumpkin is a &quot;challenged&quot; athlete that garners the assistance of Christina Ricci's privileged &quot;everything's perfect in life&quot; sorority girl, Carolyn McDuffy.  Once the two cross paths, there's no turning back and neither's life will be the same.McDuffy's all-star tennis stud of a boyfriend ends up in car accident along the way with a fantastic Hollywood off the cliff explosion reminiscent of a MOAB (Mother of all Bombs) going off.  The viewer must seriously suspend reality to swallow the shape he is in after the crash.  Small thing, but there are other areas in the film like that, that prove detracting.Good entertainment in Pumpkin and recommended viewing for a quirky, edgy, and downright funny satire with a heart.",4,The Great Pumpkin Patchwork of Laughs,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1396,"['satire', 'truly', 'unique', 'tale', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'job', 'proving', 'easy', 'eyes', 'are', 'missteps', 'way', 'keep', 'rising', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Halloween', 'night.The', 'portrayal', 'sorority', 'life', 'Greek', 'Row', 'scream', 'countless', 'fodder', 'satire', 'script-writer', 'proves', 'in-tune', 'what', 'audience', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'black', 'times', 'movie', 'not', 'forego', 'happy', 'wrapped', 'up', 'ending', 'carry', 'black', 'satire', 'end.Unlike', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'use', 'disabled', 'characters', 'story', 'humanizing', 'not', 'exploitive', 'Pumpkin', 'quot', 'challenged', 'quot', 'assistance', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'privileged', 'quot', 'everything', 'perfect', 'life', 'quot', 'sorority', 'girl', 'Carolyn', 'McDuffy', 'Once', 'two', 'cross', 'paths', 'turning', 'back', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'same.McDuffy', 'all-star', 'tennis', 'stud', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'car', 'accident', 'way', 'fantastic', 'Hollywood', 'cliff', 'explosion', 'reminiscent', 'MOAB', 'Mother', 'Bombs', 'going', 'off', 'viewer', 'must', 'seriously', 'suspend', 'reality', 'swallow', 'shape', 'crash', 'Small', 'thing', 'are', 'other', 'areas', 'film', 'prove', 'detracting.Good', 'entertainment', 'Pumpkin', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'quirky', 'edgy', 'downright', 'funny', 'satire', 'heart']",N/A

598236,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JLD1,Only-A-Child,"[2, 4]","The featured sorority in ""Pumpkin"" is referred to as AOPi, which is the abbreviation of an actual national sorority-Alpha Omicron Pi. But in the movie ""Omega"" is substituted for ""Omicron"". This little detail pretty much sums up this little film. ""Pumpkin"" ALMOST crosses the legal, politically correct, and taboo topic line many times but always stops short. Unable to decide if it wants to be a satire, a political commentary, or a serious message movie it waffles back and forth. All this is very frustrating plus it's never a good idea to flaunt where you could have gone had you not gutlessly backed off.The result is far less satisfying than if the screenwriter had just maintained a consistent direction. For example, the satire elements actually work pretty well. The visual imagery of films is spoofed as sorority girl Ricci's first bump on the road of life is followed by a montage of imperfection-rats, decaying garbage, a dead bird, etc. which have always been there but which she is just seeing for the first time. Then there are the repeated condescending references to the Chinese sorority sister. And Ricci's attempted suicide using the entire contents of the medicine cabinet, including contact lens solution and Pepto-bismol. Good bits that let you know this thing is being played for laughs but far too isolated to turn the movie into a good satire or to even convince you that it is a satire.Toward the end you begin to wonder where they can go with this thing. Which they must have wondered too because the last 30 minutes seems thoughtless tacked on to provide some kind resolution for a direct-to-video release that would get back at least some of the production costs. Actually this thing had a theatrical release but was pulled after a few weeks when it failed to generate much interest. It did about $300,000 at the box office and I am not leaving off any zeros.Christina Ricci fans probably should check this out. She plays the same sorority airhead as Reese Witherspoon did in ""Legally Blonde"" and Witherspoon's is pretty sorry by comparison. Actually most of the execution is good and Marisa Coughlin is ravishing as the sorority president who throws one of the best hissy fits in film history. Four years after staring in ""Girl"", Dominique Swain has a moderate size part as Ricci's roommate.  Appearance-wise those four years were not kind.If you have always wondered what it would be like to combine elements of ""Rainman"", ""Lucas"", and ""Breaking Away"" into the same movie, ""Pumpkin"" shows you why that would be a bad idea.Here is Mr. Cranky's all-time classic comment about this movie:""I'm sure everyone else with a p.... will notice this too, but Christina Ricci's nipples are poking through virtually every single piece of clothing she wears. There's one scene where she's wearing a shirt and a coat and you can still see her nipples poking through the coat. Has anybody heard of tape? There's a real thin line between perky and deadly. Usually nipples that hard in a porn film are an indication of an impending silicone rupture. This is really a practice that ought to stop and it's discriminatory to boot. I mean, if Russell Crowe is doing a scene and his ..... happens to be straining out of his trousers, the director is going to stop and make him watch Carnie Wilson's liposuction tapes until his ..... turns inside out. Why? Because it's distracting.""",2,"""ill"" Legally Blonde",1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,3389,"['featured', 'sorority', 'Pumpkin', 'referred', 'AOPi', 'abbreviation', 'actual', 'national', 'sorority-Alpha', 'Omicron', 'Pi', 'movie', 'Omega', 'substituted', 'Omicron', 'little', 'detail', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'little', 'film', 'Pumpkin', 'ALMOST', 'legal', 'politically', 'correct', 'taboo', 'topic', 'line', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'short', 'Unable', 'decide', 'be', 'satire', 'political', 'commentary', 'serious', 'message', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'very', 'frustrating', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'flaunt', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'had', 'not', 'gutlessly', 'backed', 'off.The', 'result', 'far', 'less', 'satisfying', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'just', 'maintained', 'consistent', 'direction', 'example', 'satire', 'elements', 'actually', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'visual', 'imagery', 'films', 'spoofed', 'sorority', 'girl', 'Ricci', 'first', 'bump', 'road', 'life', 'followed', 'montage', 'imperfection-rats', 'decaying', 'garbage', 'dead', 'bird', 'etc', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'just', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'Then', 'are', 'repeated', 'condescending', 'references', 'Chinese', 'sorority', 'sister', 'Ricci', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'using', 'entire', 'contents', 'medicine', 'cabinet', 'including', 'contact', 'lens', 'solution', 'Pepto-bismol', 'Good', 'bits', 'let', 'know', 'thing', 'being', 'played', 'laughs', 'far', 'too', 'isolated', 'turn', 'movie', 'good', 'satire', 'even', 'convince', 'satire.Toward', 'end', 'begin', 'wonder', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'thing', 'must', 'have', 'wondered', 'too', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'thoughtless', 'tacked', 'provide', 'kind', 'resolution', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'least', 'production', 'costs', 'Actually', 'thing', 'had', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'pulled', 'few', 'weeks', 'when', 'failed', 'generate', 'much', 'interest', 'did', 'about', '300,000', 'box', 'office', 'am', 'not', 'leaving', 'off', 'zeros.Christina', 'Ricci', 'fans', 'probably', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'same', 'sorority', 'airhead', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'did', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'Witherspoon', 'pretty', 'sorry', 'comparison', 'Actually', 'most', 'execution', 'good', 'Marisa', 'Coughlin', 'ravishing', 'sorority', 'president', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'hissy', 'fits', 'film', 'history', 'Four', 'years', 'staring', 'Girl', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'moderate', 'size', 'part', 'Ricci', 'roommate', 'Appearance-wise', 'four', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'kind.If', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'combine', 'elements', 'Rainman', 'Lucas', 'Breaking', 'Away', 'same', 'movie', 'Pumpkin', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'idea.Here', 'Mr.', 'Cranky', 'all-time', 'classic', 'comment', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'else', 'p', 'will', 'notice', 'too', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'nipples', 'are', 'poking', 'virtually', 'single', 'piece', 'clothing', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'coat', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'nipples', 'poking', 'coat', 'Has', 'anybody', 'heard', 'tape', 'real', 'thin', 'line', 'perky', 'deadly', 'Usually', 'hard', 'porn', 'film', 'are', 'indication', 'impending', 'silicone', 'rupture', 'really', 'practice', 'ought', 'stop', 'discriminatory', 'boot', 'mean', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'doing', 'scene', '..', 'be', 'straining', 'trousers', 'director', 'going', 'stop', 'make', 'watch', 'Carnie', 'Wilson', 'liposuction', 'tapes', '..', 'inside', 'out', 'Why', 'distracting']",N/A

I hadn't heard of the majority of these songs or for that matter of Jacques Brel, but when I listened to the songs I liked them except for one or two. There's some really good stuff on the cd, so if you want the Emiliana track and don't mind shelling out the money, don't be worried about the rest of the tracks sucking.

Christina Ricci was interesting to wacth, as always, and any film with Brenda Blethyn already has a few points in its favor.

For example, the vain star tennis player drives off a cliff, his car burst into flames, then he is next seen in the hospital, unscathed, but paralyzed.  Within a month, he is coaching the very special needs individuals he loathed.  Hmm.  Don't waste your time or money on this drivel.  Sorry, Brenda.

But what I got exceeded all expectations.  I'll not go into the plot, as you can read a (albeit unflattering) plot summary put together by the fine people at Amazon.com.  What I will say is that this film is deceptively deep, wildly romantic, unapologetically witty, and ultimately a piece of compassionate humanity.  Contrary to the opinions of the well-meaning offical Amazon reviewer, I felt the execution of this film was spectacular, even if not completely flawless (and how many films can claim that?).  Under the hands of less capable actors or productions crew, the premise of this movie might easily been completely absurd.  However, luckily for us this is not the case.  ""Pumpkin"" is certainly Christina Ricci's best performance to date, as we are finally shown the true depth of her apparently considerable skill as an actress.  The male lead Hank Harris was also fantastic, making the growth of his character both believable and touching.  Combine that with one of the smartest scripts in recent history and you have yourself a fine movie.""Pumpkin"" is multifaceted, and draws some of its inspirations from Cinderella (as seen in the title), Romeo and Juliet, and classic ""triumph-of-the-human-spirit"" type films (&agrave; la ""Gattaca"", another fantastic film).  However, Pumpkin warps these themes into its own, and emerges as a truly wonderful piece of extraordinary filmmaking.",5,Magnifico!  5 enthusiastic stars far beyond expectations,1032480000,"09 20, 2002",2002,1590,"['went', 'see', 'Pumpkin', 'expectation', 'teen', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'edgy', 'agrave', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'director', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'fine', 'film', 'what', 'got', 'exceeded', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'not', 'go', 'plot', 'can', 'read', 'unflattering', 'plot', 'summary', 'put', 'together', 'fine', 'people', 'Amazon.com', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'deceptively', 'deep', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'unapologetically', 'witty', 'ultimately', 'piece', 'compassionate', 'humanity', 'Contrary', 'opinions', 'well-meaning', 'offical', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'felt', 'execution', 'film', 'was', 'spectacular', 'even', 'not', 'completely', 'flawless', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'claim', 'hands', 'less', 'capable', 'actors', 'productions', 'crew', 'premise', 'movie', 'might', 'easily', 'been', 'completely', 'absurd', 'However', 'luckily', 'not', 'case', 'Pumpkin', 'certainly', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'are', 'finally', 'shown', 'true', 'depth', 'apparently', 'considerable', 'skill', 'actress', 'male', 'lead', 'Hank', 'Harris', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'making', 'growth', 'character', 'believable', 'touching', 'Combine', 'one', 'smartest', 'scripts', 'recent', 'history', 'have', 'fine', 'movie', 'Pumpkin', 'multifaceted', 'inspirations', 'Cinderella', 'seen', 'title', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'classic', 'triumph-of-the-human-spirit', 'type', 'films', 'agrave', 'Gattaca', 'fantastic', 'film', 'However', 'Pumpkin', 'themes', 'own', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'extraordinary', 'filmmaking']",N/A

We've finally reached the point in our society where the love that dare not speak its name is that between a hot babe and a [  ]!The reason why I mention these two Directors in my title is because this film is lush with color and beautiful music, I specially liked the Belle & Sebastion tune, and is quite purposely melodramatic to an absurd degree(remember the car crash sequence that Roger Ebert hated so much?).If you watch carefully Pumpkin and Caroline actually spend very little time together. Caroline is obviously projecting onto Pumpkin her desires because he is a blank slate to her. The revealing scene is at the end of the film when she asks him if he was speaking literally or metaphorically about something and he answers ""what?"".Cliche's abound in this film, the overprotective mother, the jock who becomes a better man after losing the use of his legs, the ""blond"" sorority, the fight at the dance(is that music from Rebel Without A Cause?). The symbolism is so in your face, the rats, the rotting fruit covered with flies, the dead bird. Christina Ricci was very wise to get this future cult film under her belt before moving on to adult fare.The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is because ultimately it has no message. Love conquers all is a childish concept and I can't believe that women will be flocking to the special olympics looking for dates after seeing this film.
