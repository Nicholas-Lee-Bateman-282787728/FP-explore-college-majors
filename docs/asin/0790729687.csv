According to ppl they almost make biological stuff in their pants because of the fright of this movie. However once I was abble to see it I knew that People was exagerating. This movie is a peace of art in vampiric proportions.It had been made with elegance and a gentle touch. Even tough there is quite some blood especially when Lestat gets hungry it also looks tempting and subtle.I highly recommend this movie.

I read the book two years later, and suprisingly, I love both just as much!  I was also glad that Anne Rice that did the screenplay, since not a lot of authors get that chance.  By her doing that, she brought what she wrote to life instead of someone else.Tom Cruise: Best performance I've ever seen, since he's very diverse in his career. I haven't looked at him the same way since, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  Very chilling, likeable and sexy!Brad Pitt: Another great performance of Louis! I love the humanity still portrayed after he's turned, and adds a bit of light to the film.Kirsten Dunst: Scared the life out of me!  Just as scary, and sick, as in the novel.  She touches the surface of her love for Louis, which made her such a great performer.Antonio Banderas: In the book, Armand is much younger, but hey when you get someone sexy like Banderas, you can't complain!  Just the way he looks at the characters makes you wish you weren't really there.Another thing I absolutely loved was the dark, beautiful soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal.  That is one any vampire lover must have in their music library.  The opening song sucks you right in until the very end.  But one thing I didn't like, since I'm religious, was the nudity and torture to the girl on the stage.  It was in the novel, and I'm glad they stayed faithful to it, but it was hard to watch.  But otherwise, the blood and dark atmosphere was amazing to watch.

91903,A24B06IPXG2BL8,0790729687,"""aldahia905""","[1, 1]","Interview With The Vampire, is the film adaptation of Rice's Novel, originally written in the mid '80s.  The film explores the psychological makeup of the vampire mind.  A creature once mortal turned vampire, lurking the streets in the night, only to feed on those who cross his path.  This movie shatters all stereotypes of the vampire.  This creature does not jump from behind bushes only to mutilate one's neck and ferociously bleed his victim dry.  This movie demonstrates the truth of the vampire, that like all creatures, including humans, they are emotional, thinkers, intellects, compassionate, lovers, and some even befriend mortals.  The vampire Louis, brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt, is the central character whose very actions depict a sudden transformation from human to immortal.  He must re-evaluate what he deems &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;good&quot; to put into perspective his new found life or death depending upon how you see vampire existence and is remarkably emotional as Rice describes Louis in her novel.  Kirsten Dunst is a extraordinary Claudia, a child vampire, who must also come to grips with her immortality as child having been made a vampire as a child, never to mature physically.  Tom Cruise, was a brilliant blond, blue-eyed, Lestat, he is the true spoiled brat prince, arrogant vampire as Rice intended him to be.  Louis (Pitt), reeks hatred against Lestat (Cruise) for not being able to explain the meaning of their existence as creatures of Dark.  This movie is brilliant, complex, intelligent, and destroys the vampire stereotypes.  The vampire, having once been mortal, is more human than us all, having lost the luxuries of walking the daylight.  A spell-binding journey for the mind.

Yes, the production values are astonishing in parts and Kirsten Dunst delivers a remarkable child performance, but outside of those two aspects I found the delivery of what could have been an intriguing and unique story to be so uneven and calculated that it lost all impact and become underwhelming and unbearable.And stupid.Personally, I found this really hard to get into.  I know many fans of the novel, and Rice's contributions to literature in general.  I'm not her target audience, I know that.  I'm not a follower, I've never read her work and the whole vampire craze is lost on me.  That being said, I do enjoy movies of all genres and so for me the themes and subject would not be an issue if the film were constructed well.  Instead, this brooding piece of boredom misses so many golden opportunities and winds up being a nonsensical mess that fails to capitalize on all the potential it has.  The story itself is rather intriguing, but Neil Jordan fails to do anything exciting with the material.  Instead, he cuts back and forth and serves up segments of scenes that are supposed to create a whole but wind up becoming rather lost in this sea of mundane.  The tone of the film is so low-key that it winds up being horribly boring and uneventful, even in the moments of supposed high intensity.Another detractor is the uneven performances.  Brad Pitt plays Louis as if he was sleepwalking through the film, and Tom Cruise is so over the top eccentric that the two feel as if they were in two separate films altogether.  As mismatched as they are, Antonio Bandaras takes the film to a whole new low when he pops up.  A truly ridiculous performance and in fact, his whole segment just feels so soap opera cheap.  At least Kirstin Dunst serves up some savage realness.

91914,AB4F6UHL20U95,0790729687,Anne Rice,"[29, 36]","This is the author talking. The film is shattering. For me, and of course I lack objectivity, it is The Red Shoes of Horror Films.  It got my book, it got my script, and the person responsible was the producer David Geffen. He is the one who drew together the finest talent in every field to do this film. He asked me to write the screen play. Was I part of ""the finest talent?"" I hope so.  He is the one who sent me a video of the film even though I objected to casting and might have screamed. I loved it. I called him to tell him. When he sent a print of the film to New Orleans for a private viewing for me and my family and friends, I was so overwhelmed by this picture that I came out of it crying helplessly in the arms of my editor Victoria Wilson. I stood there sobbing, holding onto Vicky, as the whole crowd of concerned people looked on. I couldn't snap out of it. I went out, got in the back of my car, and was driven home.  The film took me back to the night I finished the book -- 4 a.m. in the morning in the year 1973 -- in Berkeley, California, in a shabby ground floor apartment full of junk shop furniture, a beautiful place, where I sat on the couch utterly overwhelmed by the experience of ""the novel,"" a coherence that had come out of me -- vowing to myself that if no one published it, I'd sell it out of shopping bag to people on the street.  The film took me back even further, into the soul that had exposed itself in the writing. Darkness. No grace. No salvation.  The film got it. It got ""the glamor of evil"" and that darkness, that hopelessness, that despair.  It is -- and I say this now as a film buff -- a great film. Forget me. Forget the book. It's a piece of sublime work in which genius ""happened"" as it can in film when great directors like Neil Jordan, and great actors, and great professional on all levels are giving it everything that they can -- when  they have but one goal and that is to be true to something in which the author was true to himself or herself.

Some love it, (not necessarily fans of the books), some find it a fluffy piece of fun and still others find it a dark  piece of horror. I have read all of the books in Anne Rice's vampire  chronicles. And I agree with the author's delight with the cinematic  version of her story. It captured the sensuous mood of her book perfectly.If you want to know a little bit more about the novel then check  out the area I have put aside for it in the Authors page. The vampires are  portrayed less as demons and more as tormented artists in the medium of  predation. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is depicted from the  point of view of Louis, (Brad Pitt). He is a young vampire, made by Lestat,  (Tom Cruise), who is portrayed as a capricious, self centered, secretive  and powerful figure that dominates Louis's life.Lestat, with  Louis, is trying to live a normal, semi-human existence but the urgency of  this desire is like a prison for the tormented Louis. Just as Louis seems  ready to break free, Lestat uses a momentary weakness, on the part of  his  partner, to create a vampiric daughter for the pair of them.In  the end even this is not enough. Louis and his &quot;daughter&quot;,  Claudia attempt to destroy their creator and flee New Orleans to seek the  legendary vampires of Europe. There they find a coven, lead by the  charismatic Armand, who tries, (due to very complex motivation, not shown  in the movie), to seduce Louis. This event climaxes in an orgy of  destruction as the coven is destroyed by Louis in revenge for the murder of  his Daughter.The movie version of &quot;Interview with the  Vampire&quot;, is very close to the novel but it does have a completely  different ending which will force further divergences from Anne Rice's work  as the movies continue. I look forward to the sequel, as the second book,  &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, was even better than the first.",5,"God kills indiscriminately, and so shall we.",957744000,"05 8, 2000",2000,2011,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'certain', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'reactions', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'love', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fans', 'books', 'find', 'fluffy', 'piece', 'fun', 'still', 'others', 'find', 'dark', 'piece', 'horror', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'vampire', 'chronicles', 'agree', 'author', 'delight', 'cinematic', 'version', 'story', 'captured', 'sensuous', 'mood', 'book', 'perfectly.If', 'want', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'novel', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'area', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'Authors', 'page', 'vampires', 'are', 'portrayed', 'less', 'demons', 'more', 'tormented', 'artists', 'medium', 'predation', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'depicted', 'point', 'view', 'Louis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'young', 'vampire', 'made', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'portrayed', 'capricious', 'centered', 'secretive', 'powerful', 'figure', 'Louis', 'life.Lestat', 'Louis', 'trying', 'live', 'normal', 'semi-human', 'existence', 'urgency', 'desire', 'prison', 'tormented', 'Louis', 'Just', 'Louis', 'ready', 'break', 'free', 'Lestat', 'momentary', 'weakness', 'part', 'partner', 'create', 'vampiric', 'daughter', 'pair', 'them.In', 'end', 'even', 'not', 'enough', 'Louis', 'quot', 'daughter', 'quot', 'Claudia', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'creator', 'flee', 'New', 'Orleans', 'seek', 'legendary', 'vampires', 'Europe', 'find', 'coven', 'lead', 'charismatic', 'Armand', 'who', 'due', 'very', 'complex', 'motivation', 'not', 'shown', 'movie', 'seduce', 'Louis', 'event', 'climaxes', 'orgy', 'destruction', 'coven', 'destroyed', 'Louis', 'revenge', 'murder', 'Daughter.The', 'movie', 'version', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'very', 'close', 'novel', 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'ending', 'will', 'force', 'further', 'divergences', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'work', 'movies', 'continue', 'look', 'forward', 'sequel', 'second', 'book', 'quot', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'quot', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'first']",Interview With the Vampire

And all of them had one thing in common. They said that it wasn't a good horror movie.Indeed, this is not much of a horror movie.It was never intended to be.Making it into a horror movie would be an insult to the book, which was sensual, intensive and (a bit sloppily, I must admit) philosophical. That is much more than can be said for horror movies. The movies that manage to be this just don't fit the box anymore. And it is ridiculous to call them bad just because they do not fit certain standards or expectations.The actors were great, although the full potential of Banderas was not taken advantage of. Kirsten Dunst astonished me - a child with the ability to play such a complicated role seemed impossible to be, yet here she was, as good as her co-stars Pitt and Cruise, who were simply stunning. What was missing in the movie was the chilling cruelty of the child, Claudia, which was certainly the most frightening aspect of the book - in the movie she just seems a lost little girl, growing into a teenage girl, not a woman, really - but this is not the fault of the actress, certainly.If I could change a few things in the movie, these would be: 1) making Claudia seem more like the cold-blooded doll she was in the book, 2) using the charisma and mysterious nature of Banderas to its full potential, and 3) changing the scenes that take place in the modern times - these, I feel, lack the style and taste of the rest of the movie, especially the end, which was so typically Holywood I positively hated it.This movie, however, was a fine one.

Detail is good in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows. Blacks are unstable and milky, and there is motion judder and blur of in motion detail in shadows. Skin tone and texture show the waxy effect of DNR (digital noise reduction). Grain appears to be tele-cine noise, more than actual grain in the original material. Bandwidth is moderate at about 15 mbs. The sound is mediocre with only a Dolby 5.1 48k mix provided. This is hard to understand, as a previous DVD edition of this film boasted a DTS sound track.

But Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas are almost as desirable to me as Johnny Depp, so when I got a bargain on it, I bought it. I'm not sure whether I'm glad or not.It's a horror film, alright, although it's beautifully filmed. The actors, set designers, location scouts, special effects men, costume designers, lighting men (oh, yes; many problems with light in the film, artfully solved) all did their jobs well.One of the reasons I avoided this film was the vampire Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst, who is only a child. Rather small child, in fact, maybe 7 or 8 years old. People who become vampires never age past the day they were bit. But their minds mature, they can learn things, and so she seems to be a child prodigy, playing the piano like an expert, dancing majestically, talking like an adult (way too much like an adult), and having the passions of an adult. But not the body.This disturbed me, and was the main reason I avoided the book and movie all these years. After all, this little girl (who must obviously be played by a child actress) is traveling with two very adult, very sensuous men. She eventually screams at them, ""Which one of you did this to me?"" and throws a considerable tantrum over the whole thing.Claudia turns out to be the most vicious and heartless of the three. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is bold and unapologetic, but points out he was not given a choice when he was made a vampire, the way he gave Louis (Brad Pitt) a choice. Eventually we meet the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas) who ""created"" Lestat. But Louis has a conscience, and tries to survive on the blood of ""rats and poodle dogs,"" as Lestat sneeringly described it. But as Lestat predicted, he eventually got over that.They started in New Orleans, then went traveling, especially to Paris. There Armand followed Louis one day and, to prove he was a real vampire, danced on the ceiling of an archway. He gives Louis a card announcing the Vampire Theater, and Louis & Claudia go see it.

91938,A3N94LNED0IF0R,0790729687,Charles S. Tashiro,"[4, 10]","On a whim, I recently picked up a bargain copy of ""Interview with the Vampire."" Familiar with the controversy surrounding the casting, I was perhaps most interested in judging that question for myself. To get that issue out of the way, while I do think that Cruise is miscast as Lestat, he does a creditable job and gives some of his more comical lines a nice turn. The real disgrace is Pitt, who is just awful as Louis, moping around in a constant funk, like a mobile grey cloud of angst and self-recrimination.Having said that, however, dare I suggest he was only doing what the part demanded? And having made that suggestion, dare I go further and remark that maybe the big problem with this film is less one of casting than of whether or not the Vampire Chronicles make good material for movies? I like Rice's novels, but when I read them, I wondered how they could be filmed because they achieve their power through a combination of introspective characters and rich descriptions of sensual experience. The latter are certainly within the power of film to convey, and the handsome production design and cinematography demonstrate that the makers of ""Interview"" were attentive to the need. For the introspection to work, however, the scenarist and actors would have to find externalized equivalents to Rice's subjective passages that an audience can understand.To put it mildly, they do not. Rice is a gifted novelist, but that's no guarantee she's a dramatist. The fact that she was employed to adapt the novel to the screen suggests a misplaced deference to the material that is testified to throughout by the lush, expensive over-production. ""Interview"" feels like nothing so much as one of those reverent bio-pics from the early sixties, about a Pope or a King at the very least, or an adaptation of something like ""War and Peace"" or ""Finnegan's Wake"" or the Bible. Which, when you think about it, is pretty silly when dealing with a popular novel about vampires. When the horror moments come, inevitably the filmmakers fall back on loud music, shock cuts, lots of gore, in short all the standard ingredients of cheap horror. Inevitably, the effects seem out of keeping with the pseudo-importance of the rest of the production.A first rate director might be able to find a way to bring all these contradictions together, melding the ingredients into a vibrant totality akin to the novels' excitement. Neil Jordan's films tend to be one mark above ordinary. He seems to have a knack for recognizing interesting material, but not enough dramatic imagination to make it compelling.

91942,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0790729687,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 7]","Few films could match the pre-release hoopla of the 1994 vampire epic ""Interview With the Vampire."" Based on the now-classic Anne Rice novel and starring Hollywood big guns Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, this goth horror fantasy lived up to expectations in amazing fashion due to terrific period detail, superb performances and the always-interesting direction of the talented Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game"").Granted, much of the fascinating Rice Novel (the first of her Vampire Chronicles) was forsaken, but so much is followed verbatim that even the most dedicated devotee was - for the most part - pleased. Pitt makes a perfect Louis and, surprisingly, Cruise is terrific as Lestat. Their verbal and eventually physical warfare makes for great fireworks along the recreated riverfront of 18th and 19th century New Orleans French Quarter.This is arguably the greatest vampire film ever made, though fans of Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Hammer's ""Horror of Dracula"" may disagree. But the look, the emotion and the angst of these stylish and oh-so-beautiful vampires (Antonio Banderas' Armand is also a memorable character) should capture the imagination of just about any moviegoer with a taste for the unusual.After viewing ""Queen of the Damned,"" a sad and utterly moronic version of the third Anne Rice novel from her Vampire Chronicles, one can't help but appreciate this thoughful celluloid portrayal. Rarely hitting a bad note - with the exception of a tacked on Hollywood-Guns-and-Roses ending which nearly capsizes the entire film, ""Interview With the Vampire"" is a great example of what big money moviemakers and producers can create when they take supernatural material seriously. A fine film based on a fine novel.

91948,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0790729687,C. Middleton,"[12, 13]","This would have to be one of the better vampire films.Anne Rice authored the famous novel over a relatively short time after the tragic death of her daughter. In this case, the creative process aided the grieving process and turned her into one of the most read gothic novelists in twentieth century history.Rice's screenplay is true to form, and the production value of the film is first rate. Before the film's release, there was a lot of noise regarding the casting. When Tom Cruise heard about the film, he lobbied hard, contacted his influential connections, and pulled a few strings, landing the coveted role of The Vampire Lestat. All the noise came from Anne Rice, because she didn't want Cruise to play the part. In so many words, Anne believed he was not capable of playing the charismatic vampire, as the character of Lestat is a complex one, requiring a certain cosmopolitan class and aplomb. Cruise won the role anyway as writers in Hollywood, as is well known, hold little power. In the end, however, surprisingly, Cruise managed to put in one of the best performances of his career. Lestat came to life and the film has slowly turned into a cult classic that can be viewed time and time again.Rice's novel and the screenplay are exceedingly clever because the vampire is used as a metaphor for the human condition. The character of Louie is a representative of everyman - angry at the seeming absurdity of our existence. He loses his beloved wife and child and falls into a deep grief, hates the world and wishes only to die. The Vampire Lestat, in search of a companion out of his own loneliness, offers Louie a new lease on life...or death. Emotionally and physically at rock bottom, Louie accepts Lestat's offer of immortality and takes the plunge. Louie becomes a reluctant vampire because killing, he believes, is against his nature. This is the human condition: our moral inclinations and our basic instincts constantly at war. Louie rejects his new nature as a killer, however, he's no longer human - he now exists in no-mans land neither human or vampire, but as Lestat constantly reminds him, he must make a choice. This is existentialism in its purist representation, that there is no such thing as ""human nature"", and what we are, and what it means to be human, (or vampire) are always a matter of decision - there's no correct choice - only choices. In other words, man is nothing else but what he makes himself. Louie made a choice to join the dark side and then could not take responsibility for that choice, hence his angst about his true identity. Brad Pitt put in a believable performance as the reluctant vampire as we could feel his angst, his frustration concerning his new identity.This is one of those films that can be pulled off the shelf occasionally and enjoyed, no matter how many times it's seen. This is an excellent story from an entertaining as well as philosophical point of view.",4,Existentialism and the Reluctant Vampire,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2927,"['would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'vampire', 'films.Anne', 'Rice', 'authored', 'famous', 'novel', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'tragic', 'death', 'daughter', 'case', 'creative', 'process', 'aided', 'grieving', 'process', 'turned', 'one', 'most', 'read', 'gothic', 'novelists', 'twentieth', 'century', 'history.Rice', 'screenplay', 'true', 'form', 'production', 'value', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'lot', 'noise', 'regarding', 'casting', 'When', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'heard', 'film', 'lobbied', 'hard', 'contacted', 'influential', 'connections', 'pulled', 'few', 'strings', 'landing', 'coveted', 'role', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'noise', 'came', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Cruise', 'play', 'part', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'Anne', 'believed', 'was', 'not', 'capable', 'playing', 'charismatic', 'vampire', 'character', 'Lestat', 'complex', 'one', 'requiring', 'certain', 'cosmopolitan', 'class', 'aplomb', 'Cruise', 'won', 'role', 'anyway', 'writers', 'Hollywood', 'well', 'known', 'hold', 'little', 'power', 'end', 'however', 'surprisingly', 'Cruise', 'managed', 'put', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'Lestat', 'came', 'life', 'film', 'slowly', 'turned', 'cult', 'classic', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'time', 'time', 'again.Rice', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'clever', 'vampire', 'used', 'metaphor', 'human', 'condition', 'character', 'Louie', 'representative', 'everyman', 'angry', 'seeming', 'absurdity', 'existence', 'beloved', 'wife', 'child', 'deep', 'grief', 'world', 'only', 'die', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'search', 'companion', 'own', 'loneliness', 'Louie', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'death', 'Emotionally', 'physically', 'rock', 'bottom', 'Louie', 'Lestat', 'offer', 'immortality', 'plunge', 'Louie', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'killing', 'nature', 'human', 'condition', 'moral', 'inclinations', 'basic', 'instincts', 'constantly', 'war', 'Louie', 'new', 'nature', 'killer', 'however', 'no', 'longer', 'human', 'now', 'no-mans', 'land', 'human', 'vampire', 'Lestat', 'constantly', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'existentialism', 'purist', 'representation', 'such', 'thing', 'human', 'nature', 'what', 'are', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'vampire', 'are', 'always', 'matter', 'decision', 'correct', 'choice', 'only', 'choices', 'other', 'words', 'man', 'nothing', 'else', 'what', 'Louie', 'made', 'choice', 'join', 'dark', 'side', 'then', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'responsibility', 'choice', 'hence', 'angst', 'true', 'identity', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'put', 'believable', 'performance', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'could', 'feel', 'angst', 'frustration', 'concerning', 'new', 'identity.This', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'shelf', 'occasionally', 'enjoyed', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'seen', 'excellent', 'story', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'philosophical', 'point', 'view']",Interview With the Vampire

91952,AE12AEJFCOGGY,0790729687,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[100, 119]","I haven't cared very much for Anne Rice's recent books, but her earlier work was outstanding. I loved &quot;Interview&quot; in particular, so I was really looking forward to this movie. There is always a risk in adapting  such a vivid and powerful-not to mention beloved-book into a film. Director  Neil Jordan and his collaborators have succeeded marvelously, though. This  is an exciting, engaging film; remarkably faithful to Rice's original text.The story opens in present day San Francisco. Louis (Brad Pitt), a 200  year-old vampire, is telling his life story to an interviewer (Christian  Slater), who is shocked by his supernatural revelation. &quot;I am flesh  and blood,&quot; Louis tells him, &quot;but not human.&quot;His story  takes us back to late 18th century New Orleans where Louis first  encountered the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Desiring a companion, and in  love with his beautiful looks, Lestat gives Louis the &quot;Dark  Gift&quot;-that is, he makes him into a vampire. They live together for  many years, roaming the streets at night, united by their common quest for  blood.Eventually, though, Lestat fears that Louis is going to leave him.  Desperate, he makes a vampire of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a beautiful young  child, knowing the Louis would never leave the girl. Thus they are bonded  together as &quot;one big, happy family.&quot; As it turns out, though,  they are not so happy after all.The story takes the vampires to Paris,  where they finally encounter some more of their own kind. The coven of  vampires is led by the stunningly handsome Armand (Antonio Banderas) who  quickly falls in love with Louis. Louis is enamored of him as well, but he  will never leave little Claudia, something Armand realizes.The film ends  back in the present in a departure from Rice's book. The new twist is  exciting, though, and sets up the story for an inevitable sequel. It hasn't  been made yet, but if it ever is, I'm looking forward to it.The big  question, of course, is, how is Tom Cruise as Lestat? In one word:  brilliant. This is one of his best performances ever, heightened by the  fact that he is playing a role so different from his typical screen  persona. Cruise has always been an underrated actor, but hopefully that  will start to change after people see him here. He is terrific.The rest  of the performances are also quite good. Brad Pitt does very well as the  tortured, guilt-ridden Louis. Antonio Banderas is extraordinary as the  seductive, young master of darkness. His is the most convincing portrayal  of a vampire, filled with power and charisma.Neil Jordan's direction is  top-notch. Visually, &quot;Vampire&quot; is stunning, helped considerably  by Dante Ferretti's superb production design. Anyone who has read the  book-and anyone who has not-is sure to enjoy this haunting, erotic treat.",4,"A Haunting, Erotic Treat",960681600,"06 11, 2000",2000,2850,"['have', ""n't"", 'cared', 'very', 'much', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'recent', 'books', 'earlier', 'work', 'was', 'outstanding', 'loved', 'quot', 'Interview', 'quot', 'particular', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'always', 'risk', 'adapting', 'vivid', 'powerful-not', 'mention', 'beloved-book', 'film', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'collaborators', 'have', 'succeeded', 'marvelously', 'though', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'film', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'Rice', 'original', 'text.The', 'story', 'present', 'day', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Louis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '200', 'year-old', 'vampire', 'telling', 'life', 'story', 'interviewer', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'shocked', 'supernatural', 'revelation', 'quot', 'am', 'flesh', 'blood', 'quot', 'Louis', 'quot', 'not', 'human.', 'quot', 'story', 'back', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'Louis', 'first', 'encountered', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Desiring', 'companion', 'love', 'beautiful', 'looks', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Gift', 'quot', 'vampire', 'live', 'together', 'many', 'years', 'roaming', 'streets', 'night', 'united', 'common', 'quest', 'blood.Eventually', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'going', 'leave', 'Desperate', 'vampire', 'Claudia', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'beautiful', 'young', 'child', 'knowing', 'Louis', 'would', 'never', 'leave', 'girl', 'are', 'bonded', 'together', 'quot', 'one', 'big', 'happy', 'family.', 'quot', 'out', 'though', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'all.The', 'story', 'vampires', 'Paris', 'where', 'finally', 'encounter', 'more', 'own', 'kind', 'coven', 'vampires', 'led', 'stunningly', 'handsome', 'Armand', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'quickly', 'love', 'Louis', 'Louis', 'enamored', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'little', 'Claudia', 'something', 'Armand', 'realizes.The', 'film', 'back', 'present', 'departure', 'Rice', 'book', 'new', 'twist', 'exciting', 'up', 'story', 'inevitable', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'been', 'made', 'yet', 'ever', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'it.The', 'big', 'question', 'course', 'how', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'one', 'word', 'brilliant', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'heightened', 'fact', 'playing', 'role', 'so', 'different', 'typical', 'screen', 'persona', 'Cruise', 'always', 'been', 'underrated', 'actor', 'hopefully', 'will', 'start', 'change', 'people', 'see', 'here', 'terrific.The', 'rest', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'very', 'well', 'tortured', 'guilt-ridden', 'Louis', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'extraordinary', 'seductive', 'young', 'master', 'darkness', 'most', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'vampire', 'filled', 'power', 'charisma.Neil', 'Jordan', 'direction', 'top-notch', 'Visually', 'quot', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'stunning', 'helped', 'considerably', 'Dante', 'Ferretti', 'superb', 'production', 'design', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book-and', 'anyone', 'who', 'not-is', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'haunting', 'erotic', 'treat']",Interview With the Vampire

Wong,"[0, 0]","When it was reported in the media that Tom Cruise was to play the lead part of Lestat, the legendary vampire, in Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"", the author herself was dead set against casting the famous movie star as her lead character.  However after seeing the completed version of the film, Rice revised her opinion of Cruise and pronounced the performance ""brilliant"".  This role, keep in mind, was passed over originally by Daniel Day Lewis and Jeremy Irons and in retrospect, they would've been too old to play the ever youthful Lestat so I think Cruise was an excellent choice.  Also excellent are Brad Pitt as the doomed Louis and a very young Kirsten Dunst as the little girl who never ages.  Neil Jordan, coming off his recent hit, ""The Crying Game"", also delivered with an involving psychological horror film of the first caliber. I am now renting this film in Blu-ray and will comment on its quality which is in debate by some of the customers here.  Nevertheless, Blu-ray or standard, this is a film worth seeing if you're a fan of the book or an Anne Rice.  I think Cruise is an under-rated actor who has also given brilliant performances in ""Born on the 4th of July"" and ""Magnolia"" but because of his good looks is often ignored (The Cary Grant fate!!) as Michael Caine has stated in an interview.

Ms. Rice adds a lot more to vampire legendry than do many of the gothic novels of contemporary times. We are taken back in time with a mind that seems to have actually been there. All the characters are given such life &amp; personality, that the story gives the impression that it could actually be feasble. There is a mysticism here, a deep fascination for the fantasy, that gives it a life all its own.The brilliance of a truly vampiric talent, resurrects the folklore into a way of existance. Many of they who feel they are born too late in this dull age of mass-consumerism. Finally, we elect are experiencing a menagerie of gothic masterpieces remade to please, &amp; inspire one to dig up the original classics from their cobwebbed &amp; dusty shelves of libraries &amp; parlours.The movie is very accurate to the book, the characters dramatically animate on screen, more than enough to delight audiences, impress the fantoms, &amp; even sufficiently please the authoress, &amp; it is quite rare to please an author, unless the production is pretty much identical to the original. The movie was not terribly &quot;hollywood-ized&quot; as some other vamp films were. The book &amp; the genre's integrity is kept intact. The world portrayed therin seems to come alive from within, a part of one's soul projected onto the screen.Tom Cruise makes for an excellent Lestat {who would have known?}, &amp; the others do not dissapoint either. Sure, there really is no substitute for curling up on a dark &amp; stormy night, with candlelight illuminating a good horror novel, but I think it is finally time to intigrate such marvellous movies by the darkness of a black candle's flicker. For many of us, it has already been long as such.Interview With The Vampire is top quality entertainment for vapire lovers. It contains much emotional/situational relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic &amp; enthralling.

91962,A20KFJ5RIZ0ELW,0790729687,Eddie Munster,"[1, 2]","For those who are uninitiated your knowledge of Vampire Movies is in no way complete until you have seen the master of them all, Interview with the Vampire . It is the exception to every rule and the rule to every exception . Lush, powerful, poetically charged with emotion and overwhelming in its portrayal of what it means to have everything yet be left wanting by the sheer tedium of perpetuity & immortality - it is a movie that deservedly embodies the meaning of the word 'Epic', so often overused as a descriptive modifier yet very apt herein . There are films of its kind that achieve the status of Cruise Ship but 'Interview' is truly the only Oceanliner out there, the QM2 of its time and its kind . Heavy, calculating, intricately layed out - yet never resting for a moment in its potent ability to storytell . The first half of 'Interview' provides the interviewer (Christian Slater) with the poignant background of who Louis (Brad Pitt) is and where he came from, the arrival of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) who plays the protagonist human epicenter of the dynamics between the living and the undead, and LeStat (Tom Cruise) who has brought Louis and Claudia, unwillingly, into his world - from which only sunlight, beheading or fire can provide final escape . In the second half of 'Interview' we arrive in Paris circa 1870, Louis & Claudia searching for LeStat's maker and in so doing hoping to find out more about themselves and the knowledge of the dark gifts LeStat has denied them . What they find instead is Armand (Antonio Banderas), at four-hundred years of age he is the World's oldest living Vampire, Claudia & Louis will be torn asunder after crossing paths with the seductive one - Louis's existence will never be the same again .

Maze Sallas ""The Author's Mentor""","[3, 3]","I recently watched a youtube video of Anne Rice approving the jobs done by Crusie, Pitt, Dunst and Banderas in playing her beloved characters. See, Anne created these guys, so when she approves how you play them, you are pretty close to perfect.After I watched that interview with Anne, I thought it might be fun to revisit the movie. So tonight I rented INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. I had seen it when it was released and it did not impact me much back then. But I was reading the novels and I did not give them the separate attention they deserved. I want to correct that now.This movie fulfilled the vision of the author as much as possible. Anne wrote the screenplay, which aided the production immensely, but also the actors really got well into their roles.Tom Cruise took a lot of heat for his acting in this movie, but it is unwarranted. His acting -- pretending to be Lestat -- is actually superb. I can't imagine anyone doing it better. The haughtiness, the arrogance, and yes, the smooth good looks. Cruise made a great Lestat.Brad Pitt is the only actor I can imagine to play Louis, the 'forever lamenting' and beautiful vampire. He looked tortured and miserable throughout the movie because he was tortured and miserable throughout the book. Think about it. If Pitt played him any differently, he wouldn't be Louis!Banderas was also perfect as Armand. Of course, Anne's readers know Armand a whole lot better than this movie allows the viewers to know him, but he does a great job with the small face-time he is given.All in all, I have to commend the entire production.

While not knowing if the second film is any good or not, it would have to do a fantastic job to keep pace with the original.

I have read most of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, and this movie captures the essence of this world to a &quot;T&quot;.The biggest coup was probably getting Tom Cruise to play Lestat, and he delivers.  Ann Rice had her initial objections to him, but they were later recanted.  What Cruise does best is to play the arrogance of Lestat, while still making him somehow likeable.And the supporting cast makes me think that &quot;Queen...&quot; is going to be a real stinker, as none of the originals appear in the next film.  Brad Pitt doesn't shake up the screen, but his job is to be narrator, and in this he performs well.  Kirsten Dunst shows how she was going to be a star in the future with remarkable poise.  Stephen Rea plays the vampire you just want to strangle, and Antonio Bandaras shows enough Charisma as Armand that it could have spun off into it's own movie.But alas, it doesn't look like any of these are going to be in any future Rice movies, and I get the feeling that the whole franchise may have been stopped in it's tracks.

However, I thought that this film lacked a lot.  Mainly because of their  choice of actors and the fact that some of the story was changed.  I hate  it when Hollywood does that.  Why mess with perfection?  As I was saying,  the actors, though talented, were just not right for the parts.  I will  admit that Tom Cruise surprised me as Lestat, but I still think he was just  wrong for the role.  Brad Pitt did fine and was almost believable as the  incarnation of the famous Louis.  But even he probablly could have been  replaced.  I actually think he might have made a better Lestat...He  certainly looks better blonde that's for sure.  And what's with Antonio  Banderas?!  Who ever said he could play a vampyre who was suppose to have  been 17 when he died, who looked like an angel with long red hair?  They  might have just as well cast Marlon Brando, it would have been no less  believeable and he is a much better actor than Banderas could ever be.  In  short, the film was purely Hollywood capitalizing on the sensationalism and  sex-appeal of it's then most popular male stars.  Too bad DiCaprio wasn't  hot then.  Perhaps they might have gotten closer to the original  characters...Unless of course they cast him as Santiago or some other  insane thing as they are generally prone to do.

I have been a fan of Anne's anti-hero the vampire Lestat and his blood-drinking companions since high school. When ""Interview With the Vampire"" was going to be turned into a movie, I was a bit wary of the film as was Anne Rice, especially with Tom Cruise in the lead role. I can't blame Anne for being wary of Tom Cruise as Lestat. Much to my surprise, Tom Cruise put in a pretty decent performance as the devilish Lestat. Brad Pitt on the other hand wasn't nearly convincing as the tortured Louis. He wasn't bad but his performance didn't stand out with me. Kirsten Dunst was the perfect Claudia. She was perfect as the demonic child-vampire. Her debut performance was definitely an indication to what to come for this delightful actress. Antonio Banderas as Armand was so miscast. In the books, Armand was much younger when he became a vampire. That was the biggest miscast, not Tom Cruise as Lestat. Armand was only 17 when he became a vampire and Antonio Banderas doesn't exactly look anywhere near 17 years old. I also didn't think Christian Slater was right for the role of Daniel, the mortal that Louis encounters. The film itself was pretty much faithful to the book although the introduction of the film was not nor did the film ended like the novel did. The cinematography was gorgeous. Ten times better than what was in that crudfest called ""Queen of the Damned"" (which did not follow the books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" as it was supposed to be). The film was visual eye candy. It was what I imagined what New Orleans looked like in the early 19th century. I have to admit I have always thought that ""Interview With the Vampire"" was not nearly as good as ""Vampire Lestat"" or ""Queen of the Damned"" but nevertheless, it is still a good book and classic too. Overall I like the film adaptation. Too bad ""Queen of the Damned"" was a complete mess no thanks in part of the bad script, and awful directing. ""Interview With the Vampire"" may not be flawless but I still enjoy it.

Such obsession can only bring disappointment, and this movie certainly did that, for me. Though the production values are lavish, I found it was totally mis-cast. Tom Cruise is, I'm sure, a nice person, as his constant gleeful grimace would suggest. But, in my opinion, he is just not that good of an  actor. He has done some decent roles, and says all of his lines with all the conviction he can muster. But his casting as &quot;Lestat&quot; totally ruined this movie for me. You are never not aware that this is Tom Cruise you are watching. I also found Brad Pitt awful as &quot;Louis&quot;. He says his lines as if he's very uncomfortable with the words coming from his mouth, as if he's reading them from a monitor. I really don't blame these stud-muffins for being cast, as this is what sells movies to the general public. But I would much rather have seen two excellent unknowns, of which there are many, play these roles. Antonio Banderas is laughable as &quot;Armand&quot;, not only mis-cast, but he says his lines as if his mouth is full of marbles. Stephen Rey, cast hot off the heels of his role in &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, acts insane. There are also several roles, such as one of the female vampires in &quot;The Theatre de Vampires&quot;, which could have been beautifully developed into a brief but memorable, sensual, horrifying role. Instead, we get some blousy redhead who cavorts like Joan Rivers. This movie needed to be crafted with skill and depth, and it just wasn't. It has all the mystique of almost any rock video, glossy, glamorous, and disposable. It should have had the atmosphere of a film such as, say,  the original &quot;Cat People&quot;, a film made with a small budget, before special effects, but which still weaves such dark suspense and horror with its skill and subtlety. Again, when a movie is made from a hugely popular book such as this one, it's almost always bound to be a disappointment, and, for me, this movie is no exception. I really wanted to like it, and went into its viewing with the upmost of anticipation and optimism, despite the casting. But, as it progressed I slowly had to concede that this film had no &quot;soul&quot;, it was made to please the masses, most of whom  have no taste. A lousy movie, made to be cast into video oblivion, where it now lies.",2,No &quot;bite.&quot;,1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,2505,"['very', 'much', 'looked', 'forward', 'movies', 'release', 'Having', 'read', 'famous', 'book', 'publication', 'many', 'had', 'own', 'vision', 'who', 'should', 'play', 'whom', 'how', 'should', 'unfold', 'Such', 'obsession', 'can', 'only', 'bring', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'lavish', 'found', 'was', 'totally', 'mis-cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nice', 'person', 'constant', 'gleeful', 'grimace', 'would', 'suggest', 'opinion', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'done', 'decent', 'roles', 'lines', 'conviction', 'can', 'muster', 'casting', 'quot', 'Lestat', 'quot', 'totally', 'ruined', 'movie', 'are', 'never', 'not', 'aware', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'are', 'watching', 'also', 'found', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'awful', 'quot', 'Louis', 'quot', 'lines', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'words', 'coming', 'mouth', 'reading', 'monitor', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'stud-muffins', 'being', 'cast', 'movies', 'general', 'public', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'excellent', 'unknowns', 'are', 'many', 'play', 'roles', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'laughable', 'quot', 'Armand', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'mis-cast', 'lines', 'mouth', 'full', 'marbles', 'Stephen', 'Rey', 'cast', 'hot', 'heels', 'role', 'quot', 'Crying', 'Game', 'quot', 'insane', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'roles', 'such', 'one', 'female', 'vampires', 'quot', 'Theatre', 'de', 'Vampires', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beautifully', 'developed', 'brief', 'memorable', 'sensual', 'horrifying', 'role', 'Instead', 'get', 'blousy', 'redhead', 'who', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'crafted', 'skill', 'depth', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'mystique', 'almost', 'rock', 'video', 'glossy', 'glamorous', 'disposable', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'such', 'say', 'original', 'quot', 'Cat', 'People', 'quot', 'film', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'such', 'dark', 'suspense', 'horror', 'skill', 'subtlety', 'Again', 'when', 'movie', 'made', 'hugely', 'popular', 'book', 'such', 'one', 'almost', 'always', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'exception', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'went', 'viewing', 'upmost', 'anticipation', 'optimism', 'casting', 'progressed', 'slowly', 'had', 'concede', 'film', 'had', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'please', 'masses', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'taste', 'lousy', 'movie', 'made', 'be', 'cast', 'video', 'oblivion', 'where', 'now']",Interview With the Vampire

91980,A1TSNQP8PENS3,0790729687,"George Antonio ""The Crimson Idol""","[1, 1]","I just want to go on record and say, this is my favorite movie of all time!  (Based on movies I have seen.)  I saw this movie when it was first released back in 1994, and being as young as I was, I didn't understand it.Flash foward to now.  After buying and reading all of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, I was instantly heel-bent on getting my hands on a copy of this movie!  I was able to watch it again, and I must say I believe this movie is a true work of art, and an instant classic.The adaptation from the novel to the on-screen story is changed ever so slightly (omitting some parts as most book-to-movies often do) but keeps the whole thing flowing seemlessly together, while also maintaining the substance the viewer needs to fully appreciate the film.The acting is beyond amazing.  Many people called into question Tom Cruise playing the character of Lestat (I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan either) but I can honestly say he did an amazing job with such an important role.  Having Brad Pitt play alongside Cruise as the character of Louie only caused Cruise to step his game up as well.  Pitt was still fairly young in this movie and he shows a dark energy about him that gelled naturally with the movie.Who can forget the young Kirsten Dunst, as the loveable and innocent Claudia!  A break-out role for the (at the time) young star that propelled her to future A-list status.  (What if Leelee Sobieski had gotten the part?)  Dunst plays her role so well, you do actually forget that she is just a child in the movie!  Add the incredible acting by Antonio Banderas, and you do have a young all-star cast!The story itself remains true to the novel.  A tale of lonliness, friendship, immortality, loss, grief, and acceptance.  This movie never over-does the story to make it more ""Hollywood,"" they just seem to let the movie take a course of its own and let the characters do the story-telling.  This movie will leave you with many questions, as well as a feeling that everything is settled and the end course has been set.This movie is well worth every penny you spend to rent or buy it.

91983,ALZ5Y1CE0DWQ1,0790729687,G. Guberlal,"[2, 2]","Of all movies, novels, and lore surrounding Vampires, Anne Rice explores sides of culture that one would think unimaginable in early times. Her unrestricted work examines homosexuality, the pain of immortality, and the elegance of vampires in a way that breaks any traditional boundaries a vampire story ever had.Interview with a Vampire is a clever, elegant, and deeply engaging story of myth versus realism (though, it has not been proven that vampires exist, however if they did, Anne Rice portrays them on the human scale.) The movie wavers from the book, that is to be expected, but not in the ways that doomed ""Queen of the Damned."" I believe there was one review I read where the person was disappointed that there weren't stakes, garlic, and all the other things that associate us with Vampyric Legend. Well, for that, those came out of Dracula and if that's what your seeking, that is the movie you need to buy.This movie is more of an erotic tale set in the most beautiful of areas with, of course, some of the vampire lore. It centers on Louis (Brad Pitt), a wealthy man who having lost his wife and child seeks death as an answer. Hence, he becomes the victim and love of the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the choice between death and eternal life. Louis rejects his fate afterward and doesn't share the passion of Lestat, the homosexual passion which is never really brought forward in the movie. Louis' love is Claudia, a young girl prey that he thought he killed, but Lestat turned to a vampire. The movie follows Louis over a few centuries and culminates in a spellbinding ending with the Vampire Armand (Antonio Banderos) and the return of a vampire that was thought to have been dead.The interview is Louis' recollection of events to a reporter (Christian Slater,) which in turn creates the entire story. There is more involved in this movie than ever could be written in a review, but it is one of those movies that keeps you locked in and headed to the bookstore. Sadly, the movie wasn't followed by ""The Vampire Lestat,"" instead the powers that be opted for ""Queen of the Damned."" Cruise, Pitt, Banderas, and Slater are nowhere to be seen in the newest movie.

91988,AVO9QQWRRXESK,0790729687,Heather Hays,"[1, 2]","This film, adapted from Anne Rice's novel, Interview with The Vampire, still manages to do it justice. Tom Cruise, I thought, made an excellent Lestat. He adds lots of interesting touches to the film and Lestat's character. For instance, how he hits the piano keyboard right before he tells Claudia that &quot;she's been a very, very naughty little girl&quot; Or pulling the lace out of his cuffs at the end when he ambushes Christian Slater in his car. I can't imagine the kind of Lestat everyone else was picturing because he matched my mental Lestat pretty well.Brad Pitt, I thought, did an excellent job as well. He brought out the dilemma Louis faced everyday pretty accurately, and not insensitively. The quiet, cold Louis that we meet at the beginning of the film is far from the tormented individual we meet in his flashbacks. He skillfully portrays his transformation.Kirsten Dunst, as everyone else says, did just fine. But I disagree with the critics on the point that her performance so overshadowed Tom Cruise's and Brad Pitt's performance. Antonio Banderas cracks me up in this movie.The DVD comes with a couple special features. It offers a french language track and a documentary on the behind the scenes making of the film. It also offers full commentary by Neil Jordan. He helps you catch some of the small details that he worked very hard to incorporate into the movie. (Things like how they made the veins appear underneath the skin of the vampires, and how much time they spent making that sculpture of ash. He also spends a lot of time explaining the scene with Lestat and how they made the blood drain from his body.)",5,One of my all-time favorites,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,1640,"['film', 'adapted', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'novel', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'still', 'do', 'justice', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'thought', 'made', 'excellent', 'Lestat', 'lots', 'interesting', 'touches', 'film', 'Lestat', 'character', 'instance', 'how', 'piano', 'keyboard', 'right', 'Claudia', 'quot', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'naughty', 'little', 'girl', 'quot', 'pulling', 'lace', 'cuffs', 'end', 'when', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'car', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'kind', 'Lestat', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'picturing', 'matched', 'mental', 'Lestat', 'pretty', 'well.Brad', 'Pitt', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'brought', 'out', 'dilemma', 'Louis', 'faced', 'everyday', 'pretty', 'accurately', 'not', 'insensitively', 'quiet', 'cold', 'Louis', 'meet', 'beginning', 'film', 'far', 'tormented', 'individual', 'meet', 'flashbacks', 'skillfully', 'transformation.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'just', 'fine', 'disagree', 'critics', 'point', 'performance', 'so', 'overshadowed', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'cracks', 'up', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'couple', 'special', 'features', 'french', 'language', 'track', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'full', 'commentary', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'catch', 'small', 'details', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'incorporate', 'movie', 'Things', 'how', 'made', 'veins', 'appear', 'skin', 'vampires', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'making', 'sculpture', 'ash', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'explaining', 'scene', 'Lestat', 'how', 'made', 'blood', 'drain', 'body']",Interview With the Vampire

Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise star in this pathetic attempt at a horror movie.  If this movie scares you, you must be a total wuss.The plot of this horrible film originates from the premise of good vampires v. bad and the audience is really persuaded to sympathize with Brad Pitt's vampire character.  The problems with this movie are numerous and this movie does fail miserably to evoke any horror within any sophisticated horror movie audience.First, the story is really kind of stupid and Rice really attempts to focus on the ""romantic qualities"" of the vampire, which I really hate because it almost suggests that these vampires are not really monsters.  Vampires do not have consciences like human beings!!!Vampires are evil demons that feed on human blood and any romantic gestures by the vampire are utilized towards an evil end, namely to suck the blood of its victim!!  Hence, any vampire movie that suggests that vampires are more romantic creatures than monsters is absurd in my opinion.Second and perhaps even more importantly is the vampire played by Tom Cruise. I mean Tom Cruise people, as a vampire!!  Tom Cruise, that P*$$Y!!  I mean Tom Cruise!!  Howard Stern was right on the nose about Tom Cruise in this film!!  Tom Cruise, I just can't imagine him as a vampire, I am terribly sorry!!  To her credit, I heard that Anne Rice was enraged at the idea that Tom Cruise was chosen to play this vampire and I wholeheartedly agree.Nothing else really needs to be said about this romantic attempt to make a ""vampire"" movie...I don't know what these creatures are in this movie, but you can't call them vampires.

That's how Tom Cruise moved into the picture. It is a remarkable film with beautiful actors. And yet the story does not get onto the rails of any sequel. Why ? Because it does not reach the mythical level Anne Rice is so great at bringing out in her Vampires Chronicles. It does not even give us the deep feeling of historical time that we get in the book and that is the discriminating touch of those Vampire Chronicles. So it is reduced to an action and adventure film, which does not correspond at all to Anne Rice's project. For instance the voodoo scene is essential to link the vampires to the deepest layers of human consciousness, history and fears. In the film it is reduced to some folkloric panic and some rebellion against a nearly insignificant course of events. The film is beautiful but it betrays Anne Rice and it does not open the door to the sequence of events and points of view.

Isn't that what a movie about vampires is supposed to be? Dark Shadows in the 60s was scarier than this piece of junk. I agree with whoever wrote the review about feeling sorry for them and yes we should feel sorry for them getting in this movie. ( ditto to whoever said this) I think the poeple that wrote such good reveiews were just dazzled by Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise's good looks. I think also the book was more gay oriented so if it had included that, none of these straight people would have written such great reviews and if there had been unknowns in this movie nobody would have cared about this movie. Brad Pitt's character is a little sympathetic and you do feel a little sorry for him Kristen Dunst does a great job in her role.

92000,A133XVTILE3HA8,0790729687,Jeremy Hanson,"[2, 16]","I just watched this film for the umpteenth time on DVD and haven't tired of it one bit. Never one to be easily impressed by a film or won over by gore or special effects, my love of this particular film is rather deep.  To start with Neil Jordan is a marvellous director, who has brought us such classics as The Company of Wolves, The Crying Game and The Butcher Boy. This man is a genius of vision and brings out the most honest performances from his cast. I don't think that we will ever see a better performance from any of the actors. It was, unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst's zenith of credibility at such a young age, nothing that she has done since has come close to her brilliantly painful, evocative performance here as the tortured Claudia. Nor is it likely that Brad Pitt's morose Louis will be outdone with any of his other roles (nay, I think Louis even outdoes Pitt's portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys). And Tom Cruise has never been so powerful in a role. All three bring wonderfully nuanced subtlties to their roles as the vampire trio and it is enormously compelling and emotionally touching to watch them on their journey.  Every detail of this film, from Philippe Rousselot's award-winning cinematography to the wonderfully detailed art direction and Stan WInston's always reliable makeup and effects, are exceptionally created and add to the brooding mood of this film. Without Elliot Goldenthal's sombre, beautiful score which was shamelessly beaten at the oscar's by Hans Zimmer's score from THe Lion King, the film would been very different. The moving string and choral melodies and horns provide such a marvellous atmosphere.  The story itself is so heart-breaking and involving. If you let yourself into the world of the vampire (which is rather accessible through the afforementioned cinematic techniques) Interview with the Vampire proves to be a beguiling and unique experience. It is a soaring emotional journey, a quest to not only find the meaning of immortal life, but the very reason for existence.  I am greatly moved and satisfied by Interview with the Vampire each time I watch it. It is a great shame that the sequels (which were obviously originally planned to follow on closely from this film - or so the ending suggests) were not handled by the same crew. Queen of the Dammed (actually the third book in the Vampire CHronicles - they skipped The Vampire Lestat) is rather pitiful and lacks the depth and intelligence of Interview with the Vampire. Hopefully if others are to be made, Neil Jordan, or someone at his level, will take the helm. If not, at least we are left with this beautiful film, for there is no other vampire film quite like it.",1,beautiful,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2692,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'tired', 'one', 'bit', 'Never', 'one', 'be', 'easily', 'impressed', 'film', 'won', 'over', 'gore', 'special', 'effects', 'love', 'particular', 'film', 'rather', 'deep', 'start', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'marvellous', 'director', 'who', 'brought', 'such', 'classics', 'Company', 'Wolves', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'man', 'genius', 'vision', 'out', 'most', 'honest', 'performances', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'better', 'performance', 'actors', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'zenith', 'credibility', 'young', 'age', 'nothing', 'done', 'come', 'close', 'brilliantly', 'painful', 'evocative', 'performance', 'here', 'tortured', 'Claudia', 'likely', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'morose', 'Louis', 'will', 'be', 'outdone', 'other', 'roles', 'nay', 'think', 'Louis', 'even', 'Pitt', 'portrayal', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'powerful', 'role', 'three', 'bring', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'subtlties', 'roles', 'vampire', 'trio', 'enormously', 'compelling', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'watch', 'journey', 'detail', 'film', 'Philippe', 'Rousselot', 'award-winning', 'cinematography', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'art', 'direction', 'Stan', 'WInston', 'always', 'reliable', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'created', 'add', 'brooding', 'mood', 'film', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'sombre', 'beautiful', 'score', 'was', 'shamelessly', 'beaten', 'oscar', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'THe', 'Lion', 'King', 'film', 'would', 'been', 'very', 'different', 'moving', 'string', 'choral', 'melodies', 'horns', 'provide', 'marvellous', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'so', 'heart-breaking', 'involving', 'let', 'world', 'vampire', 'rather', 'accessible', 'afforementioned', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'be', 'beguiling', 'unique', 'experience', 'soaring', 'emotional', 'journey', 'quest', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'meaning', 'immortal', 'life', 'very', 'reason', 'existence', 'am', 'greatly', 'moved', 'satisfied', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'time', 'watch', 'great', 'shame', 'sequels', 'were', 'obviously', 'originally', 'planned', 'follow', 'closely', 'film', 'so', 'ending', 'suggests', 'were', 'not', 'handled', 'same', 'crew', 'Queen', 'Dammed', 'actually', 'third', 'book', 'Vampire', 'CHronicles', 'skipped', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'rather', 'pitiful', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'Hopefully', 'others', 'are', 'be', 'made', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'someone', 'level', 'will', 'take', 'helm', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'left', 'beautiful', 'film', 'other', 'vampire', 'film', 'quite']",Interview With the Vampire

92009,A2KW8K3Q5PAO2F,0790729687,John Peter O'connor,"[6, 7]","This film, based on a novel and screenplay by Anne Rice is rather different from most vampire movies. This is a film told from the point of view of the vampire rather than from that of his victims or those who set  out to destroy him.It is not a traditional horror film and, unlike the  majority of vampire films, it is not really frightening. This is mostly  because we never actually get to relate to any of the victims of the  vampires. They are all just unknown, anonymous people playing convenient  walk on parts.Instead, the film focuses on the life of a vampire. What  is it like to be immortal? How to reconcile former human feelings with the  constant need to kill in order to achieve immortality? What does it mean to  select another person to be initiated as a vampire? These are the major  preoccupations for the vampires in the film.The film concentrates on  Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) and follows him from his vampire  beginnings in New Orleans to modern San Francisco. Unlike most vampire  films, he is depicted as a person with feelings of his own as are his  creator Lestat (Tom Cruise), their joint creation the child vampire Claudia  and Armand, the oldest vampire (Antonio Banderas).The story is told  through the means of an interview with a young journalist played by  Christian Slater.The phrase &quot;star studded&quot; hardly begins to  describe the cast list for this film and the whole movie has a feel of a  large budget which has been well spent. The only thing lacking seemed to be  that, while the film had a lot of action, it had little real atmosphere of  the sort found in, for example, &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; by Werner  Herzog.The film is fast paced with action all the way but there is  little in the way of plot or mystery. You know pretty well all the time  what is likely to happen next. That only detracts a little from what is one  of the best vampire films around.

While I'm still not, the film adaptation of Anne Rice's novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE does provide an evening's worth of above average entertainment.It's a tough job being a vampire, but in Rice's lurid world somebody has to do it. The film opens in modern day San Francisco where bloodsucker Louis (Brad Pitt) gives an interview to a journalist (Christian Slater). For the record (and for the audience in an extended flashback), Louis begins his story in 1790s New Orleans where he was a plantation owner, who crosses paths with the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Lestat is looking for a bud to hang out with, and seduces Louis with immortality's allure. Louis has nothing better to do with his idle life, and so allows himself to be transformed into one of the Undead. After a period of knocking around together, the boys decide that their N'Awlins flat needs, I guess, the feminine touch. So, Louis stumbles upon (and bites the neck of) a 12 year-old plague-orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). The girl is so fetching that our heroes decide to keep her around, and Lestat subsequently transforms her into an addition to their mini-coven. The trio are thick as thieves for years until bad things start to happen.I can't really award more than 4 stars because, for me, other vampire films have been more impressive. SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE (2001) was more cleverly done by far. And DRACULA (1979), starring Frank Langella, while not considered a great film, had scenes of cinematic artistry not matched here. Indeed, much of the power of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE comes from visuals perhaps composed for their shock value.The plot of this film is largely the commendable revelation that vampires' lives are lonely, wretched affairs. An eternity of sleeping in coffins, avoiding sunlight without some serious sunblock, and biting the jugulars of nubile, scantily-clad maidens isn't really a glamorous lifestyle. However, it's great fun watching one of this era's greatest Silver Screen hunks, Tom Cruise, be so amorally menacing in a charming sort of way. Dunst is captivating as the willful Claudia, who never physically matures beyond her young age, but whose inner self hardens as we watch. Squinting at Claudia's curls through half-closed eyes, I could almost see Shirley Temple. But America's Princess never wielded a knife like this! Pitt's Louis is so burdened with guilt over his misguided career move that he's a constant wet blanket. By the film's final scene, which is the essence of Lestat, it's apparent he too wishes Louis would just get over it.",4,Slather on the SPF 50 sunblock,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,2638,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'obsessed', 'even', 'mildly', 'fascinated', 'concept', 'vampires', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'novel', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'provide', 'evening', 'worth', 'above', 'average', 'entertainment.It', 'tough', 'job', 'being', 'vampire', 'Rice', 'lurid', 'world', 'somebody', 'do', 'film', 'modern', 'day', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'bloodsucker', 'Louis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'interview', 'journalist', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'record', 'audience', 'extended', 'flashback', 'Louis', 'story', '1790s', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'was', 'plantation', 'owner', 'who', 'paths', 'vampire', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'looking', 'bud', 'hang', 'out', 'seduces', 'Louis', 'immortality', 'allure', 'Louis', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'idle', 'life', 'so', 'be', 'transformed', 'one', 'Undead', 'period', 'knocking', 'together', 'boys', 'decide', ""N'Awlins"", 'flat', 'needs', 'guess', 'feminine', 'touch', 'So', 'Louis', 'neck', '12', 'year-old', 'plague-orphan', 'Claudia', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'girl', 'so', 'fetching', 'heroes', 'decide', 'keep', 'around', 'Lestat', 'subsequently', 'addition', 'mini-coven', 'trio', 'are', 'thick', 'thieves', 'years', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happen.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'award', 'more', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'other', 'vampire', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'impressive', 'SHADOW', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', '2001', 'was', 'more', 'cleverly', 'done', 'far', 'DRACULA', '1979', 'starring', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'not', 'considered', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'scenes', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'not', 'matched', 'here', 'Indeed', 'much', 'power', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'visuals', 'perhaps', 'composed', 'shock', 'value.The', 'plot', 'film', 'largely', 'commendable', 'revelation', 'lives', 'are', 'lonely', 'wretched', 'affairs', 'eternity', 'sleeping', 'coffins', 'avoiding', 'sunlight', 'serious', 'sunblock', 'biting', 'jugulars', 'nubile', 'scantily-clad', 'maidens', ""n't"", 'really', 'glamorous', 'lifestyle', 'However', 'great', 'fun', 'watching', 'one', 'era', 'greatest', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'hunks', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'be', 'so', 'amorally', 'menacing', 'charming', 'sort', 'way', 'Dunst', 'captivating', 'willful', 'Claudia', 'who', 'never', 'physically', 'young', 'age', 'inner', 'self', 'hardens', 'watch', 'Squinting', 'Claudia', 'curls', 'half-closed', 'eyes', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'America', 'Princess', 'never', 'wielded', 'knife', 'Pitt', 'Louis', 'so', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'misguided', 'career', 'move', 'constant', 'wet', 'blanket', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'essence', 'Lestat', 'apparent', 'too', 'Louis', 'would', 'just', 'get']",Interview With the Vampire

Actually, I would classify it as a Dramatic Horror because that's simply what it is. Interview tells the story of a 200 year old vampire (Brad Pitt) who isn't happy with being what he is. A vampire. In the present day, we see him telling his life story to a man (Christian Slater). As he tells it, we see the story play out. How he, Louie, became the vampire he is, and how it almost destroyed him. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is the vampire who made Louie. Their relationship is shown as a love / hate type thing where it seems as if Lestat only puts up with Louie because he has too. Not being a respectable vampire, Louie only wants to drink the blood of animals and not harm a human being, but the first person he does harm, puts a burden on not only him but Lestat also. It was a little girl (Kirsten Dunst), and Lestat decides to change her into one of them, and make her their &quot;daughter.&quot; That, and what occurs after that, is a very interesting and never dulls. It keeps your attention, and the characters take your emotions.The actors who portrayed the characters in the film were astounding. I believe this is Tom Cruise's best part to date. He brought life to an undead character, and a character who would not die. Brad Pitt's eyes brought soul to the character of Louie, there was real depth there. But the most superb is the acting of Kirsten Dunst. Only at the tender age of 11, her acting spoke volumes as the role of Claudia. In the movie, her soul aged but her faced never changed, and Kirsten worked very well with that.The mood is set just right in every scene. The tone of the movie is dark, and mostly all of the colors are dark. Sometimes a dull bright green will contrast with the colors, but it only makes the tone better.Interview with the Vampire is a beautiful, if twisted, story of love and faith that can even be given by the darkest of souls.",5,A Beautiful Dramatic Horror,997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,1950,"['Interview', 'Vampire', 'pure', 'example', 'what', 'good', 'horror', 'should', 'be', 'Actually', 'would', 'classify', 'Dramatic', 'Horror', 'simply', 'what', 'Interview', 'story', '200', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', ""n't"", 'happy', 'being', 'what', 'vampire', 'present', 'day', 'see', 'telling', 'life', 'story', 'man', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'see', 'story', 'play', 'out', 'How', 'Louie', 'became', 'vampire', 'how', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'vampire', 'who', 'made', 'Louie', 'relationship', 'shown', 'love', '/', 'hate', 'type', 'thing', 'where', 'Lestat', 'only', 'up', 'Louie', 'too', 'Not', 'being', 'respectable', 'vampire', 'Louie', 'only', 'drink', 'blood', 'animals', 'not', 'harm', 'human', 'being', 'first', 'person', 'harm', 'burden', 'not', 'only', 'Lestat', 'also', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Lestat', 'change', 'one', 'make', 'quot', 'quot', 'what', 'very', 'interesting', 'never', 'dulls', 'attention', 'characters', 'take', 'emotions.The', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'astounding', 'believe', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'best', 'part', 'date', 'brought', 'life', 'undead', 'character', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'die', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'eyes', 'brought', 'soul', 'character', 'Louie', 'was', 'real', 'depth', 'there', 'most', 'superb', 'acting', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Only', 'tender', 'age', '11', 'acting', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'role', 'Claudia', 'movie', 'soul', 'aged', 'faced', 'never', 'changed', 'Kirsten', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'that.The', 'mood', 'set', 'just', 'right', 'scene', 'tone', 'movie', 'dark', 'mostly', 'colors', 'are', 'dark', 'Sometimes', 'dull', 'bright', 'green', 'will', 'contrast', 'colors', 'only', 'tone', 'better.Interview', 'Vampire', 'beautiful', 'twisted', 'story', 'love', 'faith', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'given', 'darkest', 'souls']",Interview With the Vampire

Based on the first novel in The Vampire Chronicles, by Anne Rice...Interview is directed by Oscar winner Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game') and scripted by Rice herself. I remember the first time I saw this movie, 6 years ago, and immediately reading the first book. Not only is it a great vampire film, but it's also a terrific literary adaptation. Rice only removed things from the novel that weren't completely necessary and, in doing so, created a brilliant, passionate script. The film stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, and Christian Slater. Seeing these names doesn't really shout ""masterpiece."" Incredibly, every actor is suited very well for their role.The film opens in modern day New Orleans, where a vampire named Louis (Pitt) has agreed to give a reporter (Slater) an interview. The story then jumps back to the late 1700's, where Louis was a 24-year-old, suicidal plantation owner who had recently lost his wife and child in childbirth. His invitation to death is open to anyone, but it is Lestat (Cruise) who accepts his offer. Lestat kills Louis and, before he dies, offers him the chance to live forever. Louis accepts. This offer means that Louis will live forever and stay eternally youthful, but must stay away from sunlight and must feast on the blood of others. Unable to take the lives of humans (something Lestat does with ease), Louis begins feasting on rats and other animals; When Louis ends up taking the life of a young girl, Lestat turns her into a vampire and she becomes Claudia (Dunst), the daughter/lover of Louis and Lestat. Louis and Claudia become a kind of Romeo & Juliet type, but they remain complete opposites. Claudia is more like Lestat, deadly and cruel...Odd, since she hates Lestat. Jumping ahead a bit, Louis and Claudia eventually end up in Europe where they meet Armand (Banderas), the self-proclaimed ""oldest living vampire"" and head of a theatre troupe called The Theatre de Vampyre. I don't want to say much more about the plot to avoid spoilers. When Cruise was cast as Lestat, Rice publicly critisized the decision but later recanted her comments when she saw the film. On the DVD, in the bonus features, she rants about how good Cruise was. And he is incredible, this is one of his best performances. I've only read the first book (I'm currently reading ""The Vampire Lestat""), but Cruise captures this character so well. He's charismatic, good-looking, but capable of being cruel and evil as well. Pitt delivers one of his best performances too as Louis. Louis is a complex character, who needs to a complex performance to really capture him. Pitt handled that completely; Watch his eyes throughout the film and watch how they go from young and youthful to world weary and sad. Dunst, who was thirteen when she made the film (I think), also delivers a spectacular performance. Since the character begins as a child and, by the end of the film, is still a child but with an adult mind; Dunst showed incredibly maturity in the role. Few child actors could have captured the emotion she did. I can not rave enough about this movie. Vampire/Dracula movies are the most cliched and overly used stories out there, but ""Interview with the Vampire"" is bursting with originality. It's not a horror film, despite it's subject matter. It's really a drama and much of Louis's story is heartbreaking. The gothic look that Jordan gave the film works very well to set the tone and atmosphere of the film. Even if you're a person who despises horror films or movies about vampires, I highly recommend this movie.GRADE: A",5,A Masterpiece,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3666,"['Interview', 'Vampire', 'bar', 'none', 'one', 'best', 'vampire', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Based', 'first', 'novel', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Interview', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Neil', 'Jordan', ""'The"", 'Crying', 'Game', 'scripted', 'Rice', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'immediately', 'reading', 'first', 'book', 'Not', 'only', 'great', 'vampire', 'film', 'also', 'terrific', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'Rice', 'only', 'removed', 'things', 'novel', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'necessary', 'doing', 'so', 'created', 'brilliant', 'passionate', 'script', 'film', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Seeing', 'names', ""n't"", 'really', 'shout', 'masterpiece', 'Incredibly', 'actor', 'suited', 'very', 'well', 'role.The', 'film', 'modern', 'day', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'vampire', 'named', 'Louis', 'Pitt', 'agreed', 'give', 'reporter', 'Slater', 'interview', 'story', 'then', 'back', 'late', '1700', 'where', 'Louis', 'was', '24-year-old', 'suicidal', 'plantation', 'owner', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'lost', 'wife', 'child', 'childbirth', 'invitation', 'death', 'open', 'anyone', 'Lestat', 'Cruise', 'who', 'offer', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'chance', 'live', 'forever', 'Louis', 'offer', 'Louis', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'stay', 'eternally', 'youthful', 'must', 'stay', 'away', 'sunlight', 'must', 'feast', 'blood', 'others', 'Unable', 'take', 'lives', 'humans', 'something', 'Lestat', 'ease', 'Louis', 'feasting', 'rats', 'other', 'animals', 'When', 'Louis', 'up', 'taking', 'life', 'young', 'girl', 'Lestat', 'vampire', 'Claudia', 'Dunst', 'daughter/lover', 'Louis', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'Claudia', 'become', 'kind', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'type', 'remain', 'complete', 'opposites', 'Claudia', 'more', 'Lestat', 'deadly', 'cruel', 'Odd', 'Lestat', 'Jumping', 'ahead', 'bit', 'Louis', 'Claudia', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'Europe', 'where', 'meet', 'Armand', 'Banderas', 'self-proclaimed', 'oldest', 'living', 'vampire', 'head', 'theatre', 'troupe', 'called', 'Theatre', 'de', 'Vampyre', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'When', 'Cruise', 'was', 'cast', 'Lestat', 'Rice', 'publicly', 'critisized', 'decision', 'later', 'recanted', 'comments', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'how', 'good', 'Cruise', 'was', 'incredible', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'first', 'book', ""'m"", 'currently', 'reading', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Cruise', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'charismatic', 'good-looking', 'capable', 'being', 'cruel', 'evil', 'as', 'well', 'Pitt', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'too', 'Louis', 'Louis', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'complex', 'performance', 'really', 'capture', 'Pitt', 'handled', 'completely', 'Watch', 'eyes', 'film', 'watch', 'how', 'go', 'young', 'youthful', 'world', 'weary', 'sad', 'Dunst', 'who', 'was', 'thirteen', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'think', 'also', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'character', 'child', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'child', 'adult', 'mind', 'Dunst', 'showed', 'incredibly', 'maturity', 'role', 'Few', 'child', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'captured', 'emotion', 'did', 'can', 'not', 'rave', 'enough', 'movie', 'Vampire/Dracula', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'cliched', 'overly', 'used', 'stories', 'there', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'bursting', 'originality', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'really', 'drama', 'much', 'Louis', 'story', 'heartbreaking', 'gothic', 'look', 'Jordan', 'gave', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'set', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Even', ""'re"", 'person', 'who', 'horror', 'films', 'movies', 'vampires', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie.GRADE']",Interview With the Vampire

The film also featured up and coming actors Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn with film veteran George C. Scott as the Commandant of Bunker Hill Military Academy. I've been a huge fan of Cruise ever since I saw that 1981 film.About a month or so prior to the release of Interview with a Vampire, a coworker told me the film was a best-selling Anne Rice Novel. After learning this, I borrowed the dramatized audio version from my local library to get the extra details I knew the film would leave out. If I could only use two words to describe my experience they would be BLOWN AWAY!In fact, I was so taken in by the dramatized audio version of the book that I knew there was no way the Warner Brothers film could capture the essence of what I had already experienced. But, since I'm such a big fan of Cruise, I plunked down my hard earned greenbacks like everyone else, expecting a mediocre visual experience at best.Could Cruise become the Vampire Lestat I had experienced? Could new comer Brad Pitt actually become Louis? And what of Claudia? How in the world could a young Kirsten Dunst ever hope to pull off such a well defined character?Well, not only did Cruise bring to life the Vampire Lestat, but Pitt and Dunst were equally enthralling in their roles as well. The casting was flawless. This is one to see as director Neil Jordan did an excellent job of bringing the pages of the best-seller to the big screen.The 1994 film was shot on location in New Orleans, San Francisco, England, Paris, and also offers excellent performances from Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, Christian Slater, and new comer, Thandie Newton, who later starred opposite cruise in Mission Impossible 2.This film has everything: love, hate, life, death, ecstasy, terror, and murder. Check this one out, y'all! If you've already seen it, see again, or get the audio version and get a different experience.

92032,A26OGZZJC764CC,0790729687,"Lawanda Bell ""Lawanda B.""","[0, 0]","I can't even begin to explain how incredible this Spellbinding movie from Anne Rice is. I'm very glad she has written it. She has a very workable imagination. Anybody can join in to work with her.(almost.) Well, let's get with the cast of this movie,now we have: Tom Cruise as Lestat, Brad Pitt as the remorseful vampire, Louis, Kirsten Dunst as the precocious Claudia and Antonio Banderas as Armand. The movie starts with a character played by Christian Slater, readying his tape recorder,beginning to interview a...vampire. The human-like creature turns to him,revealing himself to be..Louis, Brad's character. He begins to tell his story from his P.O.V. When he was human, he had a wife who died of childbirth, his baby boy or girl never made it either. So, he was already ready for death.That's when a vampire named Lestat decided to answer his prayers. The first time he taken his blood,he asked him,has he had enough. The second time he taken his blood, he told him, "" I'm going to give you the choice,I've never had."" Lestat gave him another life, ETERNAL LIFE. And for that,Louis sees the last sunrise for himself. I gotta admit, Brad's character has never looked so handsome and beautiful before. What a sexy-looking vampire! Anyway, the vampire saying went, ""In order to survive, you must feed!"" Louis couldn't bring himself to feed on the blood of humans,leading Lestat to do all the killing. Louis always fed on the blood of poodles, chickens and rats. Lestat found it funny for some reason. When push came to shove, they had their arguments and petty disagreements,talking about survival and being a killer vampire vs. morality. Lestat knew that Louis didn't like the way of survival, but he didn't care. While feeling stressed out, Louis found a little girl named Claudia, with her dead mother. He held her tight and sucked her blood. Lestat found them and started laughing and dancing with the dead corpse,celebrating the triumph of Louis's first taste of human blood. Louis was very depressed with himself and ran off to a sewer drain. Later on, Lestat found him, and told him he had a surprise for him. He took Louis back home and found Claudia, lying on the bed. Louis thought he killed her, but she was half-dead in vampire limbo. So, Lestat gives her a taste of his blood from his cut, she drinks until he shouted enough, and Claudia is transformed to the point of looking like a curly-haired doll with a savage bloodthirst to match. So, without giving the whole movie away, they tried living together, but, being that Lestat's rules were too much, they turned on him and ran, thinking he's dead. Together, Louis and Claudia searched the world for vampires just like them. And they did. First, they found a vampire named Santiago and then a leader named Armand. Armand welcomes them into his theatre and his underground Lair. Claudia doesn't trust Armand and his crew,but Louis says he has no choice but to stay where they are. Meanwhile,he was looking for a new mentor. I believe he found it in Armand, the oldest vampire he never met until that very moment. There's something else that's bugging Claudia, she needs a mother figure. After Louis feeds on the woman, believing himself a heartless vampire,Claudia kisses him. Spolier Alert: If you've never seen this movie and don't want the ending given away,then please read no further! Needless to say Armand's theartre troupe vampires including Santiago turn on Louis,Claudia, and for no real reason the woman 'cause they read their thoughts about they're incident between them and Lestat. So they wall up Louis to put him out of the way, and then they throw Claudia and the woman in a room where the sun comes through over-head. Sadly they both die ""burnt to a crisp"" with Louis unable to help them. So enraged about what had happened Louis seeks vengance by slicing up and burning those evil theatre troupe vampires. After that Louis not only decides that he was only going to get the worst end of the deal staying with Armand but also dubbed himself as ""self-sufficient. After that, he could deal with light, he seen Lestat for the last time,told the ending to Christian's character to publish and also told him that he doesn't want eternal life. When Christian's character drives off into the dawn, Lestat scares him by surprise and takes his blood. He drives the car, listens to the tape and says to him, ""I'm going to give you the choice,I never had.""

92036,AFOK05KDCHSHL,0790729687,Libretio,"[14, 16]","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES(USA - 1994)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / SDDSINTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES is that rarity in modern Hollywood terms: A star-driven blockbuster which uses the theme of eternal life to explore the meaning of existence and the nature of death and grieving. Based on Anne Rice's bestselling 1976 novel (itself written as a response to the death of a beloved child), the movie features two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars - Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt (both astonishingly beautiful here) - as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world changes around them. Cruise plays a seasoned bloodsucker who revels in his own outrageous decadence, and his wilful excesses are roughly contrasted with Pitt's horror at the necessity of consuming human blood, until Cruise is forced to create another 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Kirsten Dunst) who subsequently refuses to grow old gracefully, leading to betrayal and tragedy.Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal (TITUS, FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN), and beautifully designed (by Dante Ferretti, GANGS OF NEW YORK) and photographed (Philippe Rousselot, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT), the film's epic sweep carries its central characters through the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore.But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Anne Rice herself - allows the story to unfold at a leisurely pace, providing us with a deliberate insight into the monsters at the heart of the story and the catastrophic events which shape their destinies. The film concludes ironically, with a 20th century invention (motion pictures) which allows Pitt to see his 'beloved sunrise' once more (illustrated with clips from the likes of SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS, GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and there's an incredibly moving sequence involving a once-proud vampire laid low by his own vanity.The mood is somewhat spoiled, however, by a silly trick ending which upsets the delicate balance established during the first half of the film. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of the late and much-lamented River Phoenix who died during pre-production, and his role (as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title) was taken by Christian Slater.Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002).",5,"Sumptuous, magnificent and mournful",1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,2907,"['INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'VAMPIRE', 'CHRONICLES', 'USA', '1994', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'SDDSINTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'VAMPIRE', 'CHRONICLES', 'rarity', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'terms', 'star-driven', 'blockbuster', 'theme', 'eternal', 'life', 'explore', 'meaning', 'existence', 'nature', 'death', 'grieving', 'Based', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'bestselling', '1976', 'novel', 'written', 'response', 'death', 'beloved', 'child', 'movie', 'two', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'here', 'vampire', 'willing', 'victim', 'remaining', 'eternally', 'young', 'world', 'Cruise', 'seasoned', 'bloodsucker', 'who', 'own', 'outrageous', 'decadence', 'wilful', 'excesses', 'are', 'roughly', 'contrasted', 'Pitt', 'horror', 'necessity', 'consuming', 'human', 'blood', 'Cruise', 'forced', 'create', ""'companion"", 'Pitt', 'shape', 'little', 'girl', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'subsequently', 'grow', 'old', 'gracefully', 'leading', 'betrayal', 'tragedy.Scored', 'melancholy', 'grace', 'composer', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'TITUS', 'FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'SPIRITS', 'WITHIN', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'Dante', 'Ferretti', 'GANGS', 'OF', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'photographed', 'Philippe', 'Rousselot', 'A', 'RIVER', 'RUNS', 'IT', 'film', 'epic', 'sweep', 'central', 'characters', 'social', 'upheavals', '17th', '18th', 'century', 'America', 'horrors', '19th', 'century', 'Europe', 'where', 'nest', 'ancient', 'vampires', 'led', 'scene-stealer', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'miscast', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'wreak', 'terrible', 'revenge', 'who', 'transgress', 'vampire', 'lore.But', 'spectacle', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'COMPANY', 'OF', 'WOLVES', 'working', 'script', 'credited', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'story', 'unfold', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'providing', 'deliberate', 'insight', 'monsters', 'heart', 'story', 'catastrophic', 'events', 'shape', 'destinies', 'film', 'ironically', '20th', 'century', 'invention', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Pitt', 'see', ""'beloved"", 'sunrise', 'once', 'more', 'illustrated', 'clips', 'likes', 'SUNRISE', 'SONG', 'TWO', 'HUMANS', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'SUPERMAN', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'sequence', 'involving', 'once-proud', 'vampire', 'laid', 'low', 'own', 'vanity.The', 'mood', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'however', 'silly', 'trick', 'ending', 'delicate', 'balance', 'established', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'novel', 'homoerotic', 'undercurrent', 'mere', 'window-dressing', 'unconsummated', 'tease', 'filmmakers', 'Rice', 'refuse', 'explore', 'detail', 'mainstream', 'crowd', 'Sadly', 'film', 'dedicated', 'memory', 'late', 'much-lamented', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'died', 'pre-production', 'role', 'interviewer', 'who', 'one', 'half', 'film', 'title', 'was', 'taken', 'Christian', 'Slater.Followed', 'QUEEN', 'OF', 'THE', 'DAMNED', '2002']",Interview With the Vampire

92040,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,0790729687,Little Roy Blue,"[3, 5]","I recently read Anne Rice's famous book, and enjoyed it immensely; then I rented this movie version, and enjoyed it ... not so much.The trouble is that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a very cerebral book that deals with tough topics like existential dread, our right (or lack thereof) to kill, the nature of ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the existence (or lack thereof) of God. Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has never been very good at addressing such tough topics, particularly not in blockbuster movies like this one. Mainstream Hollywood also isn't that good at doing sex scenes, which is another big problem when you're adapting a sexy book.With most of the novel's philosophy hacked out, and the sensuality toned down, ""Interview with the Vampire"" ends up being a movie with not much to say, and not much reason to exist. Sure, the movie makes a few short forays into philosophical territory, but I think it's fair to say that 90-95% of the book's thoughtful content is absent. Also missing are a couple of my favorite sequences from the book - namely, Louis' attempt to confess to a priest, and the creepy Eastern Europe segment with the revenant.But even if I hadn't read the (far) superior book, I still think I would've disliked this movie. At least half of the cast is all wrong, for example. Brad Pitt gives an awful, lethargic performance as Louis (no, introspective characters don't have to be so dull), and Antonio Banderas is positively cheesy as Armand. Fortunately, Kirsten Dunst and the not-at-all-miscast Tom Cruise lend considerable energy to the film, capturing the essence of their characters far more successfully than Pitt.On the plus side, the film is very lavish, with beautiful sets and costumes and a suitably eerie music score. The makeup is also awesome, and there is a refreshing lack of stupid digital effects (which, of course, have completely taken over all contemporary ""event"" movies). With all the impressive attention to detail on display, I'm surprised that the filmmakers got so much of the substance wrong.Honestly, I'm also surprised to see so many positive reviews of this film, particularly coming from fans of Rice. If you think that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is only about *depressed vampires*, then this is the movie adaptation for you. But, as I said above, I think the novel is really about the search for morality and meaning in human life ... the bored vampires are just window-dressing for Rice's exploration of big philosophical issues.

92046,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,0790729687,Marc Cabir Davis,"[4, 4]","Visually and atmospherically, &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; is a beautiful film and it is great to see that this DVD from Warner Home Video is bringing the film to life like never before. In a direct comparison to the 1997 DVD release of the film - it was one of the first DVDs in the market, actually - it becomes obvious that technology has made big strides. While the image quality of the original release was outstanding at the time, the new transfer exhibits a notably higher definition. Although the master from which this DVD has been created appears to be the same that was used for the DVD release three years ago, the film looks remarkably better on this DVD. The movie is presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen presentation in a 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.The color reproduction is more faithful to the film's original presentation without any signs of discoloration. The level of detail is incredible and edges are sharply defined without the signs of edge-enhancement that were evident in the earlier release. Blacks are deep and always maintain enough detail without breaking up. The highlights are beautifully rendered while contrasts are perfectly balanced, restoring all of Jordan's ominously dark and atmospheric imagery. Color reproduction is very faithful with strong hues and tones, never bleeding, and free of noise. The compression of the movie is virtually flawless without any signs of compression artifacts in the presentation, leaving all the details, and colors fully intact. Interestingly however, the menus found on this disc, are riddled with compression artifacts like pixelation and banding, which is quite surprising given the overall stellar presentation of the movie itself.The disc contains 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio tracks in English and French as well as an English DTS audio track. Just as in the video department, Warner Home Video brings out some spectacular quality in the movie's audio presentation. The Dolby Digital track is beautifully an engaging without the slightest signs of noise or distortion. With its good use of the surrounds, the track exhibits a beautiful spatial integration and flawless imaging. Even the subtlest ambient effects are evident in the presentation, adding to the haunting beauty of the film. A good bass extension adds to the movie's visceral punch, which helps giving some of the more dramatic action scenes the necessary impact.The DTS track that can be found on the disc is equally impressive and actually manages to outperform the Dolby Digital mix on a number of occasions. The dynamics of the track, the clarity and natural reproduction of the score is simply breathtaking. The spatial integration creates a sound image that is extremely lively and boasts of the most subtle sonic nuances and timbres. Dialogues are well integrated in all versions and always understandable.Director Neil Jordan has also contributed a commentary track to this release, which is very engaging and full of valuable information. Jordan covers a plethora of aspects surrounding the production of the movie. Without notable pauses, Jordan easily coves the entire 2 hours of the movie's running length and manages to remain interesting, entertaining and informative over the entire course. You will walk away from this commentary with a new-found appreciation for the movie and the people involved. The faithfulness and efforts that went into making this the atmospheric film it ultimately is, is impressive and full of exciting tidbits.When starting up &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; a 1-minute introduction will greet you, which helps to set the right mood and expectations for the film. The introduction can also be found in the disc's &quot;Special Features&quot; section where you will also find &quot;In The Shadow Of The Vampire,&quot; a new 30-minute documentary featuring interesting interviews with Anne rice, director Neil Jordan, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stan Winston and many others. Not only does it cover different aspects of the movie and the novels themselves, but also the peripheral area of vampirism in general. It is a great piece that you shouldn't miss to watch. The disc also contains the movie's theatrical trailer and a link to a special feature on Warner's website, called &quot;History Of The Vampire.&quot;Warner Home Video has prepared a spectacular package for &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; with this DVD. Given the quality of all the content it is surprising Warner managed to squeeze four audio tracks in top notch quality on the disc, together with a beautiful anamorphic transfer and even supplements like the documentary. All in all, this DVD turns out to be an incarnation of the movie like you have never experienced it, so don't miss out on this one.",5,The Best Vampire DVD out there,1009324800,"12 26,

92047,A18XTPXBGQ26UD,0790729687,"Marcus Damanda ""author of The Forever Show""","[0, 1]","It's no exaggeration.A careful observation of previous reviews will show that I labeled Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" as the vampire masterpiece, and I stand by that, as far as books go; however, comparing ""Interview"" the movie with Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (or other, infinitely worse, adaptations) is an entirely different goblet of blood. This is due, in part, to the fact the ""Dracula"" is just more suited to reading. But it's also true that Rice wrote one monster of a story that Neil Jordan absolutely nailed on film, and that Tom Cruise was incredible as Lestat.Interestingly, Rice initially objected to the casting of Cruise, preferring someone more like Rutger Hauer in his youth. She recanted after she saw the movie--and so did I, having harbored similar ""Top Gun""-based misgivings. And so did the academy, nominating Cruise for a well-merited Oscar that he should have won. It's as though, in defiance of all common sense, a film was carried by its least-likely leading man.Others are terrific as well, including Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, and Antonio Bandaras--but Lestat, as delivered by Cruise, does the difficult trick: that is, he becomes the sympathetic character, the one we relate to, when he has no conscience about killing whatever. We begin to feel contempt for Pitt's simpering vampire, thinking, ""You're a vampire, for crying out loud! Go suck someone's neck and shut up!""And Neil Jordan was the perfect choice for director. Unlike others who came before him--several who did a decent job--Jordan never forgets that vampires are not simply COOL; they're scary as all get-out, and mystical, magical, and tragic. There's also a high degree of eroticism in the movie, but I've got to throw that back to Rice, the lord mistress of that genre ...Brilliant!(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel, ""Teeth: A Horror Fantasy."")",5,The Greatest Vampire Movie Ever,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1882,"['exaggeration.A', 'careful', 'observation', 'previous', 'reviews', 'will', 'show', 'labeled', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'vampire', 'masterpiece', 'stand', 'as', 'far', 'books', 'go', 'however', 'comparing', 'Interview', 'movie', 'Coppola', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'other', 'infinitely', 'worse', 'adaptations', 'entirely', 'different', 'goblet', 'blood', 'due', 'part', 'fact', 'Dracula', 'just', 'more', 'suited', 'reading', 'also', 'true', 'Rice', 'wrote', 'one', 'monster', 'story', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'absolutely', 'nailed', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'incredible', 'Lestat.Interestingly', 'Rice', 'initially', 'objected', 'casting', 'Cruise', 'preferring', 'someone', 'more', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'youth', 'recanted', 'saw', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'having', 'harbored', 'similar', 'Top', 'Gun', '-based', 'misgivings', 'so', 'did', 'academy', 'nominating', 'Cruise', 'well-merited', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'though', 'defiance', 'common', 'sense', 'film', 'was', 'carried', 'least-likely', 'leading', 'man.Others', 'are', 'terrific', 'well', 'including', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Antonio', 'Bandaras', 'Lestat', 'delivered', 'Cruise', 'difficult', 'trick', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'relate', 'when', 'conscience', 'killing', 'whatever', 'begin', 'feel', 'contempt', 'Pitt', 'simpering', 'vampire', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'vampire', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Go', 'suck', 'someone', 'neck', 'shut', 'up', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'director', 'others', 'who', 'came', 'several', 'who', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'Jordan', 'never', 'vampires', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'COOL', ""'re"", 'scary', 'get-out', 'mystical', 'magical', 'tragic', 'also', 'high', 'degree', 'eroticism', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'throw', 'back', 'Rice', 'lord', 'mistress', 'genre', 'Brilliant', 'review', 'been', 'posted', 'Marcus', 'Damanda', 'author', 'vampire', 'novel', 'Teeth', 'Horror', 'Fantasy']",Interview With the Vampire

92049,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0790729687,Martin Asiner,"[1, 1]","The vampire movie has a long history in films whose focus ranges from the sardonic to the comic to the thriller.  But it took INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE to show the undead as having day to day problems not unlike those of their mortal victims.  Director Neil Jordan has taken Anne Rice's novel and glitzed it up with a kaleidoscope of color to present a three century leisurely flashback related by a vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) to a reporter Daniel (Christian Slater), who becomes more involved in the tale than at first he thought.  Though Louis does the telling, he shares center stage with his mentor vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise), who gives him the gift of eternal life.  During the long years of a life that stretches from the French Revolution to modern day America, Louis never loses sight of what it meant to be human, even with all its failings. Louis kills and kills again, but he hates who he is and shares a strange hate-love relationship with Lestat, who keeps trying to remind Louis that he is what he is and ought to take joy in that.  Much of the film revolves around a home-erotic relation between Lestat and Louis, and later between Louis and another French vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas).  There is a further subtext of incest between Louis and a very young girl Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Louis turns into a fellow vampire.As in many vampire movies, the dramatic thrust is often equally divided between the frequent scenes of neck biting and the equally obvious eroticism enacted between vampire and victim.  In INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, both Louis and Lestat combine the historical bloodiness of earlier vampire movies with the pulsing sexuality that was raging in all concerned.  And while all of Louis' story is being recounted to David, the focus begins to shift ever so slightly from the one being interviewed to the one doing the interviewing.  During the course of the tale, David learns that human beings often present themselves to known vampires in the hope of joining the ranks of the undead, thus assuming their mantle of power.  David learns that it is not enough to wish to become a vampire.  One must be deemed worthy to become one.  This wish to stalk the living during the night is a potent one, yet the frequent films like this one portray the vampire as weaker than his victim.  In the world of the vampire, might does not make right, and INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE emphasizes this painful lesson only too well.",5,Don't Forget: This is an Interview,1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,2455,"['vampire', 'movie', 'long', 'history', 'films', 'focus', 'sardonic', 'comic', 'thriller', 'took', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'show', 'undead', 'having', 'day', 'day', 'problems', 'not', 'mortal', 'victims', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'taken', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'novel', 'glitzed', 'up', 'kaleidoscope', 'color', 'present', 'three', 'century', 'leisurely', 'flashback', 'related', 'vampire', 'Louis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'reporter', 'Daniel', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'more', 'involved', 'tale', 'first', 'thought', 'Louis', 'telling', 'shares', 'center', 'stage', 'mentor', 'vampire', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'gift', 'eternal', 'life', 'long', 'years', 'life', 'French', 'Revolution', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'Louis', 'never', 'sight', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'human', 'even', 'failings', 'Louis', 'kills', 'kills', 'again', 'who', 'shares', 'strange', 'hate-love', 'relationship', 'Lestat', 'who', 'trying', 'remind', 'Louis', 'what', 'ought', 'take', 'joy', 'Much', 'film', 'around', 'home-erotic', 'relation', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'later', 'Louis', 'French', 'vampire', 'Armand', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'further', 'subtext', 'incest', 'Louis', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'Claudia', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'whom', 'Louis', 'fellow', 'vampire.As', 'many', 'vampire', 'movies', 'dramatic', 'thrust', 'often', 'equally', 'divided', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'neck', 'biting', 'equally', 'obvious', 'eroticism', 'enacted', 'vampire', 'victim', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'Louis', 'Lestat', 'combine', 'historical', 'bloodiness', 'earlier', 'vampire', 'movies', 'pulsing', 'sexuality', 'was', 'raging', 'concerned', 'Louis', 'story', 'being', 'recounted', 'David', 'focus', 'shift', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'one', 'being', 'interviewed', 'one', 'doing', 'interviewing', 'course', 'tale', 'David', 'human', 'beings', 'often', 'present', 'known', 'vampires', 'hope', 'joining', 'ranks', 'undead', 'thus', 'assuming', 'mantle', 'power', 'David', 'not', 'enough', 'wish', 'become', 'vampire', 'One', 'must', 'be', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'become', 'one', 'wish', 'stalk', 'living', 'night', 'potent', 'one', 'frequent', 'films', 'one', 'portray', 'vampire', 'weaker', 'victim', 'world', 'vampire', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'right', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'painful', 'lesson', 'only', 'too', 'well']",Interview With the Vampire

It was about a man named Louis(Brad Pitt), who was bit and turned into a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Louis is having a hard time coping with drinking blood and murdering people.  However, he can't fight his urges any longer and he bites a little girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), which turns her into a vampire as well.  Soon, Lestat, Louis and Claudia become a little family and shares a house.After a considerable amount of time, Louis and Claudia can no long bear to live with Lestat any longer.  So, Claudia tricks Lestat into drinking blood from a corpse, which causes him to rot and sort of go into a coma.  At that, Louis and Claudia run away together and live a pretty happy life for a while.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I am going to stop talking.

I am however of fan of this movie and enjoyed it a lot.Interview with the Vampire is not a horror movie. It is anything but it. The movie tells us the story of Louis.(Brad Pitt) He's over 200 years old and he's telling his life story to a reporter played by Christian Slater. He's tells us how he became a Vampire from the bite of Lestat(Cruise) and how he hates being what he is. You see the child they have played by Kirsten Dunst. He tells about his good times and his low times. It's a tragic story.Brad Pitt is great as Louis. You can argue this as the best performance that he as ever made. He holds his own with Tom Cruise. It's a believable performance. You actually think he is the Vampire and he plays the emotions well.Tom Cruise is simply fantastic. Lestat is a very arrogant character and Tom plays it to perfection. He shows lots of energy and the role is very well acted. Like Pitt he becomes the character and he's no longer Tom Cruise. It's a shame to see &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and watch Stuart Townsend play a horrible Lestat.Kirsten Dunst is great. She's so creepy and scary in the movie. I heard an interview with her a couple of months ago, in which she was mad that she hated the scene in the movie where she gets to kiss Pitt. It's a memorable performance and it's her humble beginning.I liked Interview with the Vampire.

92054,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790729687,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","""Interview With the Vampire"" is a grand, spectacular, over the top movie, based on the first book in Anne Rice's seemingly endless ""Vampire Chronicles"". When it was released in 1994, it was reviled by some critics and audiences members. But I suggest that Ms. Rice's books are the types that do not lend themselves easily to being translated to the screen. Consider, for example, the feeble, atrocious movie made from Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" in 2002. I think the producers of ""Interview"" took the right approach by using the old-fashioned, overblown approach. In this sense, it reminds me of older `classics' like ""The Ten Commandments"" [1956], ""Ben-Hur"" [1959] and ""Dr. Zhivago"" [1965] - movies so sumptuous that any attempt to debate their `literary' merits is virtually pointless. Such epics are designed to amaze and to entertain. That is exactly what ""Interview"" does.To me, it's main fault is its casting of Tom Cruise as Lestat, a move the author public decried, although she later retracted her criticism. But she was heavily invested in the project, both as its script writer and as a profit participant. I, of course, am not, being just a simple moviegoer. I really like Mr. Cruise in certain roles, but, in my mind's eye, Lestat he is not. Though he wasn't quite old enough or famous enough at the time, I can picture Jude Law as Lestat. Or Ethan Hawke, perhaps. Maybe even Nicholas Cage. This casting error is partially offset by Brad Pitt's Louis. He is absolutely the right actor. In fact, he, too, would have been a decent Lestat. Nearly stealing the movie from the two megastars is Kirsten Dunst. About twelve years old at the time, she is unbelievable good as Claudia, the child vampire. Time has proven that Ms. Dunst's performance was no fluke. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea are fun as Santiago and Armand.I think director Neil Jordan had a rough time on the set of this movie. While he did an admirable job, I think his forte is rightly smaller, character driven pictures such as ""Mona Lisa"", ""The Crying Game"" and ""The End of the Affair"". Composer Elliot Goldenthal contributed a powerful music score. Much of the dazzling look of the film is the work of cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot, whose other work includes ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""The Emerald Forest"" and ""La Reine Margot"". Production designer Dante Ferretti also worked on ""Titus"", ""The Age of Innocence"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"".I think that the people who conceived ""Interview"" as a movie were determined to give it a both an expensive look and a timeless quality. If so, they succeeded. This helps enormously to overcome something that is inherent to all ""The Vampire Chronicles"": The characters and their tales are both hauntingly beautiful and decidedly repulsive. It is this contradiction in both the books and this movie that makes one either an ardent fan or a detractor.",5,"A sumptuous, over the top movie",1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,2884,"['Interview', 'Vampire', 'grand', 'spectacular', 'top', 'movie', 'based', 'first', 'book', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'When', 'was', 'released', '1994', 'was', 'reviled', 'critics', 'audiences', 'members', 'suggest', 'Ms.', 'Rice', 'books', 'are', 'types', 'do', 'not', 'lend', 'easily', 'being', 'translated', 'screen', 'Consider', 'example', 'feeble', 'atrocious', 'movie', 'made', 'Rice', 'Queen', 'Damned', '2002', 'think', 'producers', 'Interview', 'took', 'right', 'approach', 'using', 'old-fashioned', 'overblown', 'approach', 'sense', 'older', 'classics', 'Ten', 'Commandments', '[', '1956', ']', 'Ben-Hur', '[', '1959', ']', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', '[', '1965', ']', 'movies', 'so', 'sumptuous', 'attempt', 'debate', 'literary', 'merits', 'virtually', 'pointless', 'Such', 'epics', 'are', 'designed', 'amaze', 'entertain', 'exactly', 'what', 'Interview', 'does.To', 'main', 'fault', 'casting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'move', 'author', 'public', 'decried', 'later', 'retracted', 'criticism', 'was', 'heavily', 'invested', 'project', 'script', 'writer', 'profit', 'participant', 'course', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'just', 'simple', 'moviegoer', 'really', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'certain', 'roles', 'mind', 'eye', 'Lestat', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'old', 'enough', 'famous', 'enough', 'time', 'can', 'picture', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Lestat', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'perhaps', 'Maybe', 'even', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'casting', 'error', 'partially', 'offset', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Louis', 'absolutely', 'right', 'actor', 'fact', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'Lestat', 'Nearly', 'stealing', 'movie', 'two', 'megastars', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'Claudia', 'child', 'vampire', 'Time', 'proven', 'Ms.', 'Dunst', 'performance', 'was', 'fluke', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'are', 'fun', 'Santiago', 'Armand.I', 'think', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'had', 'rough', 'time', 'set', 'movie', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'think', 'forte', 'rightly', 'smaller', 'character', 'driven', 'pictures', 'such', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Crying', 'Game', 'End', 'Affair', 'Composer', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'contributed', 'powerful', 'music', 'score', 'Much', 'dazzling', 'look', 'film', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'Phillipe', 'Rousselot', 'other', 'work', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'Emerald', 'Forest', 'La', 'Reine', 'Margot', 'Production', 'designer', 'Dante', 'Ferretti', 'also', 'worked', 'Titus', 'Age', 'Innocence', 'Adventures', 'Baron', 'Munchausen', '.I', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'conceived', 'Interview', 'movie', 'were', 'determined', 'give', 'expensive', 'look', 'timeless', 'quality', 'so', 'succeeded', 'enormously', 'overcome', 'something', 'inherent', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'characters', 'tales', 'are', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'decidedly', 'repulsive', 'contradiction', 'books', 'movie', 'one', 'ardent', 'fan', 'detractor']",Interview With the Vampire

Charming monsters perhaps, but still monsters.As with the book the film tells of Louis, a grieving and morose landowner from New Orleans centuries ago turned into a vampire by Lestat, it then tells the story of his life over the centuries. Brad Pitt does a reasonable job of the ever miserable Louis, as in Meet Joe Black he plays the urbane monster well.Tom Cruise wouldn't have been my first choice to play Lestat, he lacks the stature for starters.

92066,A228JH8V9Y700G,0790729687,MortensOrchid,"[0, 2]","There were a series of things around this movie that turned me off when it was first released.  Firstly, I can admit I was not framiliar with Anne Rice's work before she met mainstream success.  Couple that with the fact that they had chosen Tom Cruise to play Lestat and Anne Rice was vehemiently opposed to it made me question both this movie's integrity and quality.  I was pleasently surprised, however, that this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Brad Pitt, in perhaps his best preformance (double for Tom Cruise), plays the broading, reflective Louis, a two hundred year old vampire who is telling his story to an interviewer, played by Christian Slater (in perhaps his last noteworthy role, ironically).  Louis is lonely, that's for sure, and hopes that by telling his tale that he will somehow atone for all the good and bad he's been through as well as caused during his two hundred year exile.Louis takes us through a sweeping epic, crossing time and history.  Already depressed over the death of his wife and child, he is hoping for death when he meets Lestat and is given the gift/curse of eternal life.  Lestat, obviously lonely for a companion as well, makes Louis immortal yet keeps him at his side without being the best teacher because he wants Louis to stay dependent on him.  Later on, they create a sort of odd family when they bring an orphaned girl whose mother had died in some sort of epidemic, Claudia.  This family is dysfunctional, to say the least.  Eventually tired of Lestat's codependency and controlling nature, Claudia and Louis eliminate him and flee to France to start anew.  Here in France they meet another group of vampires in a macabre theater.  Claudia, as she did Lestat, grows weary of Louis and craves a new companion, but when the new companion is created the theater vampires take their revenge.  Claudia and her new companion are fried up in the sunlight, and Louis, deprived of his lady love, is left truly alone.This is a tradgic tale as much as it is a fantasy.  Louis is an unusual vampire, as he seems to have more respect for human life than his counterparts.  He chooses to go through eternity alone, as it's best for him and the world around him.  I liked the aspect of being able to live forever, slogging through time and seeing the world as it changes.  But, Louis is still a monster, he's not the hero of the story even though he's the main character.  And the acting on all parties is a little on the hokey side, but then again the dialogue is preachy and a little silly too.  Kristen Dunst, although only a child when she made this movie, stood out as the femme fatale innocent child, an immortal Lolita if there ever was such a thing.  The sets, make up and wardrobe make for a lush atmosphere.I've never been a goth girl, still am not, and have no desires to be, but this was right on in the most mainstream of horror / gothic movies as you can get.

Cruise is simply magnificent as Lestat, the vampire who bites the grieving Louis (Pitt), and thus begins Lestat's formation of an immortal family.  Cruise shines like no one (not even Rice herself) could have imagined as Lestat.  Stuart Townshend has nothing on Cruise as Lestat as he carries the dark and seductive vampire trademark of the vampire, and this remains one of the best performances of his career.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis conveys all the remorse and melancholy that goes along with anyone stricken with immortal bloodlust.  The rest of the cast includes a young Kirstin Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, and Christian Slater (in a role originally planned for River Phoenix, Slater replaced him after his untimely death), all of whom give great performances.

Louis and Lestat have a challenging friendship, as Louis is at first a reluctant vampire, and this leads to many confrontations between the two of them.

92078,AYUKN4YNJV4ST,0790729687,nightwwolf,"[1, 2]","This movie was initially a disappointment as it deviated quite a bit from the book by Rice. It totally skipped Lestat's tortured, painful childhood, and missed out on much of the other subtleties that Rice created in the character, turning a three-dimensional, very realistic (given that it's a fantasy creature) character into a stereotype vampire. Frankly, Tom Cruise was totally uninspiring in his role as Lestat such that until the closing scene of the movie I didn't even realise that the part had such 'stellar' casting.Given the nature of the book and plot, with its chronological timeframe spanning hundreds of years, it's impossible for the movie to be fast-paced as an action flick, as criticized by some reviewers, but I think that in its slower pace it has remained true to the book's Gothic, brooding atmosphere.Although Brad Pitt does /not/ look the part of Louis (at all!), he has managed to do a wonderful job portraying the adolescent, conflicted vampire and Kirsten Dunst shows her talent in her portrayal of a woman trapped in a child's body, two major redeeming points for the movie.But perhaps the best touch to the movie, IMO, is the last scene where Lestat regains life. It was this scene which totally revised my opinion of the movie, though it was not in the book. Perhaps because it was so symbolic of the undead's clasping greed for life that is the core of Anne Rice's vampire, the vitality, exuberance and speed as evinced by Lestat and showed such promise for a movie of the next book.",3,"Could be better, but passable",1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,1515,"['movie', 'was', 'initially', 'disappointment', 'deviated', 'quite', 'bit', 'book', 'Rice', 'totally', 'skipped', 'Lestat', 'tortured', 'painful', 'childhood', 'missed', 'out', 'much', 'other', 'subtleties', 'Rice', 'created', 'character', 'turning', 'three-dimensional', 'very', 'realistic', 'given', 'fantasy', 'creature', 'character', 'stereotype', 'vampire', 'Frankly', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'totally', 'uninspiring', 'role', 'Lestat', 'such', 'closing', 'scene', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realise', 'part', 'had', 'such', ""'stellar"", 'casting.Given', 'nature', 'book', 'plot', 'chronological', 'timeframe', 'spanning', 'hundreds', 'years', 'impossible', 'movie', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'flick', 'criticized', 'reviewers', 'think', 'slower', 'pace', 'remained', 'true', 'book', 'Gothic', 'brooding', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '/not/', 'look', 'part', 'Louis', 'managed', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'adolescent', 'conflicted', 'vampire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'talent', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'trapped', 'child', 'body', 'two', 'major', 'redeeming', 'points', 'movie.But', 'perhaps', 'best', 'touch', 'movie', 'IMO', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'Lestat', 'life', 'was', 'scene', 'totally', 'revised', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'so', 'symbolic', 'undead', 'clasping', 'greed', 'life', 'core', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'vampire', 'vitality', 'exuberance', 'speed', 'evinced', 'Lestat', 'showed', 'such', 'promise', 'movie', 'next', 'book']",Interview With the Vampire

Another thing this movie has going  for it is the art direction, the sets, and the music, they are all  wonderful and add the the dark mood of the movie.  Tom Cruise does a nice  acting job.  It is obvious that Brad Pitt has improved since his  performance in this (such as Fight Club).

92087,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0790729687,Paperbackstash,"[0, 1]","Interview with the vampire was based on the mega seller with the same name by the gothic styled author Anne Rice. Being a big hit for the fans, many scripts were rejected before she finally decided to give in on this one. Some key points of IWTV are very daring but I'll discuss them below.The plot is simple yet it's also not. No classic vampire tale here, folks. ""It's fun to be a vampire"" is proven to be a lie. Instead the more realistic outlook is taken. Living centuries through death and massive change must take a toll on the mind. Taking blood and killing to sustain ones existence robs one of 'life'. Through the ages the human side slowly dissolves, and you grow colder despite the warmth of your 'drink', until one day everything about you that existed before is dead and won't be coming back.So goes the woes of the main character, Louis, who spends the movie mourning his existence. He was a depressed human being and once brought to the other side by Lestat, not much changes. Some light in his life is brought with the birth of Claudia, but even that doesn't last, as the viewer is sure to know.The depressed vamp wafts through the ages full of sorrow and regret, never enveloping the onster he has to be. His creator, Lestat, long ago accepted the killer mode (in fact, embraced it), and is shown for the majority of the first half of the long flick. The big shocker here is all are played by big names, not something usual for a horror picture.  Brad Pitt oozes sex appeal as Louis and mourns like no one else. His bare chest, long hair, and deep green eyes is enough to make me pop in this flick. Tom Cruise kicks out the comedy and action roles to play a conniving, twisted vampire longing for a companion. While his character was not as 'nice', it was the most addictive. Antonio Banderas stars as the long haired, overly pale Armando.Claudia...well, everyone seems to love her. I didn't. Kirsten Dunst has Claudia written all over her, yet her character annoyed me to no end. I don't care about her being a child vampire, her actions came off spoiled and bitter. Sure, I can understand to a point, and even sympathize, but overall she came off as a manipulative little bitch who thought only of herself. Lestat may have been 'hardened', but I didn't see him display the capability for cruelty that this little child did.The film is absolutely riveting, and if I could think of just one word to describe it, I'd choose this one: beautiful. Beautiful colors, beautiful scenery, beautiful music, beautiful dialogue, beautiful clothing, beautiful men. Through the ages we see everything in a Gothic, polished style. The clothing, manner, and poise of the characters sent me senses reeling. It cannot be said for many horror films, or movies in any genre, that the environment is this darn 'pretty.'Elliot Goldenthall's music score for the film is amazing and helped enriched what all the film represents: beauty, betrayal, hunger, rage, and loss. I've played the soundtrack countless times, all of them being classical except one (Sympathy for the devil.) The music inspires me like no other instrumental collection ( so far ).Pacing wise, the movie's a trifle slow. Eventful but in that lazy, lethargic manner that allows character development. Overall a bleak and grey existence for everyone in the end, and the film certainly takes the time to let the viewer know this. For a vampire flick the violence isn't extreme, but it counts as a realistic gesture once shown. Some cruel (particularly the tortured woman over the coffin), but none of the 'splatter -mainstream' stuff seen in Lost Boys or Near Dark.The ending is dark, bleak, but fit the rest of the production perfectly. It's hard to imagining a horror fan not liking this film at all, but I can understand how Louis's whining can grate on the nerves. He overdoes it at times and after awhile you just want the guy to get drunk and take a few prozacs, find a hot woman, and take a vacation. Surely there's something in life to be found somewhere for him! I also mourned the loss of Lestat in the second half, as he really spiced things up more. He had a sick, ironic humor and made things a bit more exciting. When he vanished, so did some of the entertainment value. When he does show up again, there are several gaping questions left hanging in the air concerning him.So, obviously this movie is far from perfect. Not all the characters were sympathetic. However, it's still more than worth a watch and a gorgeous piece of horror cinema that remains faithful to the book, showcasing all the genuine human emotion and angst.",2,"Gorgeous soundtrack and cinematography, but a bit dull and whiny",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4603,"['Interview', 'vampire', 'was', 'based', 'mega', 'seller', 'same', 'name', 'gothic', 'styled', 'author', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Being', 'big', 'hit', 'fans', 'many', 'scripts', 'were', 'rejected', 'finally', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'key', 'points', 'IWTV', 'are', 'very', 'daring', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'below.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'yet', 'also', 'not', 'No', 'classic', 'vampire', 'tale', 'here', 'folks', 'fun', 'be', 'vampire', 'proven', 'be', 'lie', 'Instead', 'more', 'realistic', 'outlook', 'taken', 'Living', 'centuries', 'death', 'massive', 'change', 'must', 'take', 'toll', 'mind', 'Taking', 'blood', 'killing', 'sustain', 'ones', 'existence', 'robs', 'one', ""'life"", 'ages', 'human', 'side', 'slowly', 'grow', 'colder', 'warmth', ""'drink"", 'one', 'day', 'everything', 'existed', 'dead', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'back.So', 'woes', 'main', 'character', 'Louis', 'who', 'movie', 'mourning', 'existence', 'was', 'depressed', 'human', 'being', 'once', 'brought', 'other', 'side', 'Lestat', 'not', 'much', 'changes', 'light', 'life', 'brought', 'birth', 'Claudia', 'even', ""n't"", 'last', 'viewer', 'sure', 'know.The', 'depressed', 'vamp', 'wafts', 'ages', 'full', 'sorrow', 'regret', 'never', 'enveloping', 'onster', 'be', 'creator', 'Lestat', 'long', 'ago', 'accepted', 'killer', 'mode', 'fact', 'embraced', 'shown', 'majority', 'first', 'half', 'long', 'flick', 'big', 'shocker', 'here', 'are', 'played', 'big', 'names', 'not', 'something', 'usual', 'horror', 'picture', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Louis', 'mourns', 'one', 'else', 'bare', 'chest', 'long', 'hair', 'deep', 'green', 'eyes', 'enough', 'make', 'pop', 'flick', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'out', 'comedy', 'action', 'roles', 'play', 'conniving', 'twisted', 'vampire', 'longing', 'companion', 'character', 'was', 'not', ""'nice"", 'was', 'most', 'addictive', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'long', 'haired', 'overly', 'pale', 'Armando.Claudia', 'well', 'everyone', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Claudia', 'written', 'yet', 'character', 'annoyed', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'being', 'child', 'vampire', 'actions', 'came', 'off', 'spoiled', 'bitter', 'Sure', 'can', 'understand', 'point', 'even', 'sympathize', 'overall', 'came', 'off', 'manipulative', 'little', 'bitch', 'who', 'thought', 'only', 'Lestat', 'may', 'have', 'been', ""'hardened"", 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'display', 'capability', 'cruelty', 'little', 'child', 'did.The', 'film', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'could', 'think', 'just', 'one', 'word', 'describe', ""'d"", 'choose', 'one', 'beautiful', 'Beautiful', 'colors', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'music', 'beautiful', 'dialogue', 'beautiful', 'clothing', 'beautiful', 'men', 'ages', 'see', 'everything', 'Gothic', 'polished', 'style', 'clothing', 'manner', 'poise', 'characters', 'sent', 'reeling', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'movies', 'genre', 'environment', 'darn', 'Goldenthall', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'amazing', 'helped', 'enriched', 'what', 'film', 'beauty', 'betrayal', 'hunger', 'rage', 'loss', ""'ve"", 'played', 'soundtrack', 'countless', 'times', 'being', 'classical', 'one', 'Sympathy', 'devil', 'music', 'other', 'instrumental', 'collection', 'so', 'far', '.Pacing', 'wise', 'movie', 'trifle', 'slow', 'Eventful', 'lazy', 'lethargic', 'manner', 'character', 'development', 'bleak', 'grey', 'existence', 'everyone', 'end', 'film', 'certainly', 'time', 'let', 'viewer', 'know', 'vampire', 'flick', 'violence', ""n't"", 'extreme', 'realistic', 'gesture', 'once', 'shown', 'cruel', 'particularly', 'tortured', 'woman', 'coffin', 'none', ""'splatter"", '-mainstream', 'stuff', 'seen', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Dark.The', 'ending', 'dark', 'bleak', 'fit', 'rest', 'production', 'perfectly', 'hard', 'imagining', 'horror', 'fan', 'not', 'liking', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'Louis', 'whining', 'can', 'grate', 'nerves', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'guy', 'get', 'drunk', 'take', 'few', 'prozacs', 'find', 'hot', 'woman', 'take', 'vacation', 'Surely', 'something', 'life', 'be', 'found', 'somewhere', 'also', 'mourned', 'loss', 'Lestat', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'spiced', 'things', 'up', 'more', 'had', 'sick', 'ironic', 'humor', 'made', 'things', 'bit', 'more', 'exciting', 'When', 'vanished', 'so', 'did', 'entertainment', 'value', 'When', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'are', 'several', 'gaping', 'questions', 'left', 'hanging', 'air', 'concerning', 'him.So', 'obviously', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'Not', 'characters', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'However', 'still', 'more', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'piece', 'horror', 'cinema', 'faithful', 'book', 'showcasing', 'genuine', 'human', 'emotion', 'angst']",Interview With the Vampire

The storyline, script, editing and special effects are all superb in this blood-sucking classic, but what made me give it a ""3"" rating on a scale of ""5"" was Tom Cruise.  I spent the entire time trying to make Cruise ""fit"" into a vampire film.  Though he is convincing, I couldn't help but picture him in ""Top Gun"", ""Rain Man"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Cocktail"" while I was viewing this flick.  When the dust settled...and the last ""stake"" had been planted, I came to the realization that if a horror fan watched this film with no past knowledge of Cruise, it would be a classic.  For example, Jack Nicholson was cast in the horror flick ""Wolf"" with Michelle Pfeiffer.  He was the most horrific werewolf I had ever seen on the big screen.  Trying to adapt the ""cool"" Cruise...the macho womanizer...to a vampire role, was not quite as easy a task.  It works, but true Cruise fans will look beyond his evil spirit and never truly believe that this guy could be a relative of Dracula.  Don't get me wrong, this is one of the best vampire flicks I have ever seen.  However, I would have cast someone like Willem Dafoe (of ""Spider-man fame) or Matt Dillon (aka his role in ""Wild Things"") for a more believable film.  If you are a true vampire flick fan...add this to your library.

After she saw the film, to say the least, she was very pleased. Neil Jordan and crew created an incredible rendering of the Novel. Interview with the Vampire manages to capture and ignite the screen with nearly the same passion as the novel had. Cruise and Pitt proved to be not only good in the roles, but sort of reinvented their characters while still giving the audience what it had hoped for, a rendering true to the novel. Some who have seen the film were not pleased with Antonio Banderas being cast as Armand. This is obviously because the Armand of the book is visualized as looking very different. But as it turns out Banderas delivers probably the best performance in the entire film. His portrait of Armand is absolutely brilliant. Also his custumes and makeup made him truly freightening and believable. After I saw the film the first time I remember remarking to my fellow film goers that the film was ""The Gone With the Wind of vampire movies"". After seeing this movie the other day for the fourth of fifth time I think that statement might be very well true the more I think about it even if it seemed silly at the time.

92101,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,0790729687,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[10, 16]","Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are sensual and voluptuous books, full of heavy gothic prose and powerful images. The movie of her first novel, 'Interview With The Vampire' is none of the above, but still manages to be a decent enough film, although it lacks any resemblance to the mood of Rice's original writing.The plot follows the adventures of fledgeling Vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), as told to a reporter (Christian Slater), one night in New Orleans. He starts from the beginning of his undead life and brings us right up to the present day, and introduces us to a host of grim characters along the way, the most prolific of which is Lestat, played with horrible boyishness by the hopelessly miscast Tom Cruise.The movie has many good points. Neil Jordan's style of direction suits the mood of the film very well, and in some places, excels (the Theatre Des Vampires sequence is particularly memorable). Also excellent is Pitt, in his role as Louis. He remains as faithful as he can to Rice's pedantic, melancholic Vampire as the oddly lacklustre script allows. The soundtrack is also deserving of a mention, as its lavishness complements the gothic mood of the film beautifully.The majority of glowing reviews for 'Interview', however, don't take into account the original novel, and it's here that the film fails. The character of Lestat DeLioncourt is that of a tortured and malevolent boy-monster, and yet Tom Cruise plays it with such high-camp gusto that we wonder if Warner Bros. gave Anne Rice money to retract her Tom Sawyer comments when she saw the initial screen tests. In Cruise's hands, Lestat becomes something like a Leslie-Nielsen style vampire, all fangs and drama and no substance. Similarly, Kirsten Dunst, who has now matured into a good actress, gives an overstated and hammy performance as Claudia, who, in the novel, is wise beyond her years, an unnatural and immortal monstrosity who eventually brings about the destruction of both Lestat and herself. And Antonio Banderas should never have been given the role of the Ayrean 16-year old Armand. He still speaks with a heavy Latino accent and is clearly a hispanic man in whiteface. He's nothing to do with the character of Armand.That said, 'Interview' is still a very good movie, though it fails to deliver the same punch and atmosphere as the original novel. It's a solid story, with many good points, but for anyone who's read the book, it's a shame that so much potential was cast aside in favour of Hollywood-style Overstatement.",3,Almost excellent...,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2529,"['Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'are', 'sensual', 'voluptuous', 'books', 'full', 'heavy', 'gothic', 'prose', 'powerful', 'images', 'movie', 'first', 'novel', 'Vampire', 'none', 'above', 'still', 'be', 'decent', 'enough', 'film', 'resemblance', 'mood', 'Rice', 'original', 'writing.The', 'plot', 'adventures', 'fledgeling', 'Vampire', 'Louis', 'Pointe', 'du', 'Lac', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'told', 'reporter', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'one', 'night', 'New', 'Orleans', 'beginning', 'undead', 'life', 'right', 'up', 'present', 'day', 'introduces', 'host', 'grim', 'characters', 'way', 'most', 'prolific', 'Lestat', 'played', 'horrible', 'boyishness', 'hopelessly', 'miscast', 'Tom', 'Cruise.The', 'movie', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'style', 'direction', 'suits', 'mood', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'places', 'excels', 'Theatre', 'Des', 'Vampires', 'sequence', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Also', 'excellent', 'Pitt', 'role', 'Louis', 'as', 'faithful', 'can', 'Rice', 'pedantic', 'melancholic', 'Vampire', 'oddly', 'lacklustre', 'script', 'allows', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'deserving', 'mention', 'lavishness', 'gothic', 'mood', 'film', 'beautifully.The', 'majority', 'glowing', 'reviews', ""'Interview"", 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'original', 'novel', 'here', 'film', 'character', 'Lestat', 'DeLioncourt', 'tortured', 'malevolent', 'boy-monster', 'yet', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'such', 'high-camp', 'gusto', 'wonder', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'gave', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'money', 'retract', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'comments', 'when', 'saw', 'initial', 'screen', 'tests', 'Cruise', 'hands', 'Lestat', 'something', 'Leslie-Nielsen', 'style', 'vampire', 'fangs', 'drama', 'substance', 'Similarly', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'now', 'matured', 'good', 'actress', 'overstated', 'hammy', 'performance', 'Claudia', 'who', 'novel', 'wise', 'years', 'unnatural', 'immortal', 'monstrosity', 'who', 'eventually', 'destruction', 'Lestat', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'role', 'Ayrean', '16-year', 'old', 'Armand', 'still', 'heavy', 'Latino', 'accent', 'clearly', 'hispanic', 'man', 'whiteface', 'nothing', 'do', 'character', 'Armand.That', 'said', ""'Interview"", 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'deliver', 'same', 'punch', 'atmosphere', 'original', 'novel', 'solid', 'story', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'shame', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'was', 'cast', 'aside', 'favour', 'Hollywood-style', 'Overstatement']",Interview With the Vampire

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[3, 3]","It's strange to think that (at the time of this review) the film adaptation of Anne Rice'sInterview with the Vampireis nearly twenty years old. Looking back at the likes of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst, it's funny to see where they've ended up since the release of this film! But most people, even big fans of the book, seem to generally agree that this is a good adaptation of the original novel, remaining faithful to the source material whilst still making the necessary changes in order to transfer it from page to screen (no doubt helped by the fact that it was Anne Rice herself who wrote the screenplay).In a darkened apartment in San Franciso, the vampire Louis tells his life story to a captivated journalist, divulging details on how he became a vampire, what it was like to make the transition, the companions that he spend years of his immortal life with, the struggle with his bloodlust and his quest to find answers as to the history and meaning of vampirism. Key players in his tale are the charismatic and selfish Lestat, the vampire who made Louis like him in body if not spirit, and Claudia, the little girl turned into a vampire and so doomed to spend all of eternity in a child's body.In the 18th century Louis was a wealthy plantation owner mourning the loss of his wife and child when he's approached by the vampire Lestat, who promises an end to his suffering. But unbeknownst to Louis, Lestat's motives are hardly altruistic. He's interested in the estate and lifestyle that Louis can provide him with, as well as in need of some companionship. Louis agrees to the change and in due time is transformed into a vampire. At first the two immortals get along well, with Lestat teaching Louis about how to drink blood and conceal himself in a coffin come daybreak, but eventually Louis becomes disillusioned with his companion's cruelty toward humans and his refusal to divulge any information on how he in turn became a vampire.In a bid to keep Louis by his side, Lestat turns a five year old girl that Louis (in a fit of despair and bloodlust) has drunk from into a vampire, thus binding the little family of three together forever. But as the years pass by and Claudia does not grow into a woman, she begins to question and then rail against the authority that Lestat holds over them. Of course, domestic arguments in a house full of vampires are significantly more murderous and bloody than what human beings are used to, and soon Louis and Claudia are on the run to Europe, seeking out other vampires in their search for answers.Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt initially seem like bizarre casting choices as vampires considering their All-American Golden Boy personas, yet by some miracle they actually pull off the roles. Brad Pitt embodies a permanent air of sadness and thoughtfulness that brings depth into what is now a clich&eacute;: the broody, introspective, tormented vampire. His gloom and despondency is offset by Lestat's mockery and enjoyment of vampiric life, and though these days he's better known for scientology, multiple divorces and jumping on Oprah's couch, Cruise's performance as Lestat demonstrates that whatever else is going on in his life - the man can act. At different stages Lestat can be capricious, self-absorbed, charming, dangerous, terrifying, pathetic and hilarious. His interactions with Louis and Claudia as the patriarch of their strange little family forms the crux of the film, and his absence in the film's second half (due to the necessities of the plot) is sorely felt.Kirsten Dunst is the real standout though. On paper it may sound relatively easy to play a vampire child (just look and sound creepy, right?) but Claudia is more than just that - she's a woman in a child's body. It really is extraordinary how well someone as young as Dunst was at the time could pull this off: that you can actually see her age from a child to a thirty-year old even though her appearance doesn't change at all. Yet in the first half of her appearance she has a child's mannerisms and speech patterns; in the second it's not difficult to imagine her as a very sophisticated young adult. And on top of all that, she has to capture the inherent creepiness of a bloodsucking fiend, reminding the audience that she's also someone to be scared of as well as fascinated by.In the final act we are introduced to Antonio Banderas as Armand, said to be the oldest living vampire in existence, and his coven of vampires which embody the dismal nature of immortality, alternating between clownish cruelty on the stage and lethargy in the underground crypt. It is these Parisian vampires that provide the fiery climax to the film, followed by Louis's gentle summing up of the most recent years of his life to the gob-smacked interviewer.It's a wholly unique storyline, yet it is the visual style of the whole thing that really raises the bar. Neil Jordan has always been good at crafting beautiful films, and he's completely at home in the supernatural genre. The period costumes, the opulent settings, the liters of crimson blood - it's all depicted in lavish detail and infused with a wickedly dark sense of humor. The artistry of the hair and makeup crew turn the cast into legitimately uncanny looking creatures of the night, and as the film was made on the cusp of computer graphics, in many ways it's a last hurrah for old school special effects.Sure, there are a few odd choices: Lestat biting Louis for the first time whilst levitating up through the air, and the blinking statue (to demonstrate the vividness of vampire senses) didn't work out as well on screen as it did in the book, but what Jordan really excels at is the depicting these unchangeable vampires passing through a variety of environments across the course of history.All in all, this is a surprisingly good film adaptation of a novel that changed the course of the vampire genre. With an intoxicating visual flair and better-than-expected performances from its cast, ""Interview with the Vampire"" flips the perspective on vampires - no longer existing as a cautionary tale to human beings, but as characters in their own right.",4,"""Drink From Me and Live Forever...""",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,6149,"['strange', 'think', 'time', 'review', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Anne',

But this film has to be the most beautiful, most truthful, and most amazing vampire movie ever created, and I can't thank Geffen and Warner enough for it. Even now, when I watch all these horrid vampire films that are continually made, I always know there was at least one vampire film that took my heart as well as my breath. The movie is darkly and seductively lit, just like the mood always is, and the actors fit the setting perfectly. No obnoxious, idiotic vamps here, but actually serious, compassionate and real characters. If you are a lover of vampires, and even more, a lover of the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice who wrote the novel to this movie, you will absolutely love both the actors and the way the movie is shown. Unlike other vamp movies, the vampires act their age- you know, mature- and the actors are supremely gorgeous. Even Tom Cruise with all that makeup on and blonde locks still appears just as sexy as ever- and do I even have to mention Antonio Banderas with that long hair? Well despite my drooling, there are many great actors playing in this movie. There's Tom Cruise as I've said, but at first glance you'll probably not even know because he has molded himself almost to the perfection of the character Lestat the way Anne made him appear in the novel, and has the exact personality of the vain and careless Lestat. And then there's the everlasting Brad Pitt who plays the sad, mournful Louis, and honestly, when you see this film, you'll see Brad Pitt is the best man to play this role. Antonio Banderas is spectacular as Armand- honestly, despite his age, Antonio is the splitting image of the ancient regretless vampire, and there's Christian Slater who is Malloy, the boy who interviews Louis as he pours out his whole story on tape. Then who can forget the cynical yet witty Stephen Rea who plays a head vampire actor in Armand's Parisian theater,and little Kirsten Dunst, who played the tormented child? All perfect actors who made the movie a gorgeous gem. You will not be disappointed with them I assure you.This film is a lovely and yet exhilerating piece of work that speaks of the vampire Louis who has lived many decades and wishes just out of sheer want to tell his story. So he picks an interviewer who is nameless in this movie but if you read the Chronicles will know as Malloy. Up in an apartment in San Francisco these two sit in the room, Malloy taping Louis as he tells his long and sordid tale. He goes right to the punch and tells you how he was 'born to darkness'. It appears that for time sake they change the story around a bit at the beginning and instead of telling you his brother died and he blamed himself for it as Anne wrote in the novel, they tell you he lost his wife in childbirth, and it deeply upsets him and places him in a deep state of depression that is just teetering on he being suicidal.Then Tom Cruise comes in as the striking character he is and instantly you are watching Lestat convert Louis to what he is, a vampire. Then the movie goes deep as the duo fight constantly and then convert a daughter, Claudia, that Louis loved ultimately, possibly an outlet for the pain he felt by losing his real child years back. Then as he travels the world, seeking for vampires, Armand comes to his life and tells him the facts of life from a vampire's angle, entrancing Louis ever more deeply and yet also leaving him more bitter than before, but always still feeling.This movie tells a story not just of vampires, but also of humans as well. It tells the truth of human life and how sensitive it truly is, and that some people see life much more differently than others. It also teaches you though about vampires and how if they exist this is how they would be. There are a few that are rude and vain like Lestat, and then there are some that are compassionate and loving like Louis, and then there are some that are just tormented and lost like Armand.The makeup and costume affects were excellent, the settings were lovely, and the story is perfect for just a relaxing night alone on the couch. And although I did hear some rumors that there were a few disputes between the actors on set, especially between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, they sure hid it well and made this a movie to be proud of.I recommend this movie to all viewers alike, for it's a movie meant for everyone to see, not just supernatural lovers. I guarantee you, you'll be laughing, gasping, and crying throughout the entire movie. It's just that good.",5,Best Vampire Movie Ever Made- Bar None!,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,4632,"['have', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'consisted', 'vampires', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'lousy', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'tears', 'line', 'eyes', 'film', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'most', 'truthful', 'most', 'amazing', 'vampire', 'movie', 'ever', 'created', 'ca', ""n't"", 'thank', 'Geffen', 'Warner', 'enough', 'Even', 'now', 'when', 'watch', 'horrid', 'vampire', 'films', 'are', 'continually', 'made', 'always', 'know', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'vampire', 'film', 'took', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'breath', 'movie', 'darkly', 'seductively', 'lit', 'just', 'mood', 'always', 'actors', 'fit', 'setting', 'perfectly', 'obnoxious', 'idiotic', 'vamps', 'here', 'actually', 'serious', 'compassionate', 'real', 'characters', 'are', 'lover', 'vampires', 'even', 'more', 'lover', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'movie', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'actors', 'way', 'movie', 'shown', 'other', 'vamp', 'movies', 'vampires', 'act', 'age-', 'know', 'mature-', 'actors', 'are', 'supremely', 'gorgeous', 'Even', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'makeup', 'blonde', 'locks', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'sexy', 'ever-', 'do', 'even', 'have', 'mention', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'long', 'hair', 'Well', 'drooling', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'playing', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""'ve"", 'said', 'first', 'glance', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'molded', 'almost', 'perfection', 'character', 'Lestat', 'way', 'Anne', 'made', 'appear', 'novel', 'exact', 'personality', 'vain', 'careless', 'Lestat', 'then', 'everlasting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'sad', 'mournful', 'Louis', 'honestly', 'when', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'best', 'man', 'play', 'role', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'spectacular', 'Armand-', 'honestly', 'age', 'Antonio', 'splitting', 'image', 'ancient', 'regretless', 'vampire', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'Malloy', 'boy', 'who', 'Louis', 'out', 'whole', 'story', 'tape', 'Then', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'cynical', 'yet', 'witty', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'head', 'vampire', 'actor', 'Armand', 'Parisian', 'theater', 'little', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'played', 'tormented', 'child', 'perfect', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'gem', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'assure', 'you.This', 'film', 'lovely', 'yet', 'exhilerating', 'piece', 'work', 'speaks', 'vampire', 'Louis', 'who', 'lived', 'many', 'decades', 'wishes', 'just', 'sheer', 'want', 'tell', 'story', 'interviewer', 'who', 'nameless', 'movie', 'read', 'Chronicles', 'will', 'know', 'Malloy', 'Up', 'apartment', 'San', 'Francisco', 'two', 'sit', 'room', 'Malloy', 'taping', 'Louis', 'long', 'sordid', 'tale', 'right', 'punch', 'tells', 'how', 'was', ""'born"", 'darkness', 'time', 'sake', 'change', 'story', 'bit', 'beginning', 'instead', 'telling', 'brother', 'died', 'blamed', 'Anne', 'wrote', 'novel', 'tell', 'lost', 'wife', 'childbirth', 'deeply', 'places', 'deep', 'state', 'depression', 'just', 'teetering', 'being', 'suicidal.Then', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'striking', 'character', 'instantly', 'are', 'watching', 'Lestat', 'convert', 'Louis', 'what', 'vampire', 'Then', 'movie', 'deep', 'duo', 'fight', 'constantly', 'then', 'convert', 'daughter', 'Claudia', 'Louis', 'loved', 'ultimately', 'possibly', 'outlet', 'pain', 'felt', 'losing', 'real', 'child', 'years', 'back', 'Then', 'world', 'seeking', 'vampires', 'Armand', 'life', 'facts', 'life', 'vampire', 'angle', 'entrancing', 'Louis', 'ever', 'more', 'deeply', 'yet', 'also', 'leaving', 'more', 'bitter', 'before', 'always', 'still', 'feeling.This', 'movie', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'vampires', 'also', 'humans', 'well', 'truth', 'human', 'life', 'how', 'sensitive', 'truly', 'people', 'see', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'differently', 'others', 'also', 'vampires', 'how', 'exist', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'rude', 'vain', 'Lestat', 'then', 'are', 'are', 'compassionate', 'loving', 'Louis', 'then', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'tormented', 'lost', 'Armand.The', 'makeup', 'costume', 'affects', 'were', 'excellent', 'settings', 'were', 'lovely', 'story', 'perfect', 'just', 'relaxing', 'night', 'alone', 'couch', 'did', 'hear', 'rumors', 'were', 'few', 'disputes', 'actors', 'set', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'sure', 'hid', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'be', 'proud', 'of.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'viewers', 'alike', 'movie', 'meant', 'everyone', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'supernatural', 'lovers', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'gasping', 'crying', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'good']",Interview With the Vampire
92113,AK1OBVI54SY73,0790729687,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[5, 8]","I have never watched a film so beautiful, so in- depth, and so mature on vampires. Anne Rice did a great job on picking the right people to make this film. And unlike the film version of Queen of the Damned, a very disgrace to the Chronicles it came from, Interview was very faithful to the story Anne wrote a long time ago. A thing or two was changed, but nothing that affected the movie from it's original storyline.The actors were amazingly strong and believable and I don't care what anyone says Tom Cruise was the greatest as Lestat. That guy on Damned didn't even take the time to color his hair blonde, for he refused to even look the part of Lestat, while Tom Cruise did everything he could to act and look like him and Tom Cruise poured on Lestat's charm while the guy on Damned was dull and wooden. Tom Cruise did a great job on Lestat, Anne Rice even said so. Brad Pitt was fantastic as Louis and so miserable, exactly like Louis. Armand was played beautifully in Antonio Banderas and yes he was older than Armand actually is but everyone has to admit Antonio did a great job playing the seductive and manipulative Armand. Kirsten Dunst...wow was she a strong character for someone so young. I thought she would hardly be anything, yet as a child she was strong in this film surprisingly. She played Claudia flawlessly. Rea only had a short time in Interview but indeed he stood out as a great actor and of course Slater as the ever curious boy taping the entire story of Louis' held good ground.Aside from the actors who all did a superb job there was the excellent job on scene and costume and music. All of this was done very well and made this one unforgettable film. The one thing I love about this film though is how it respected the work of Anne Rice's and obviously worked hard to put it in the right mood and put the right actors in to protray the certain personalities. I really respect everyone for doing that, for Interview is a great story that deserved a great film. Anne Rice said she wept when she saw the film, and I didn't weep but I certainly am moved by it. It's my favorite vampire film, and none other has matched up to it for me.You want cheesy teen fluff you watch Queen of the Damned, but if you want a serious, moving and grown- up look at vampires this is your movie: Interview with the Vampire. It's about a vampire who tells a human a story, about his own life, right at the time when he was born into his life as a vampire. The rest of the film is a rollarcoaster of the vampire's ups and downs and the interesting people he meets along the way with his never ending question: What is the meaning of it all? Sit back and watch a truly amazing tale; if there are vampires, this I believe would be the reality of their lives.",5,The Best Vampire Film I Have Ever Watched,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,2764,"['have', 'never', 'watched', 'film', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'in-', 'depth', 'so', 'mature', 'vampires', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'picking', 'right', 'people', 'make', 'film', 'film', 'version', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'very', 'disgrace', 'Chronicles', 'came', 'Interview', 'was', 'very', 'faithful', 'story', 'Anne', 'wrote', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'thing', 'two', 'was', 'changed', 'nothing', 'affected', 'movie', 'original', 'storyline.The', 'actors', 'were', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'greatest', 'Lestat', 'guy', 'Damned', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'time', 'color', 'hair', 'blonde', 'refused', 'even', 'look', 'part', 'Lestat', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'act', 'look', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'poured', 'Lestat', 'charm', 'guy', 'Damned', 'was', 'dull', 'wooden', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Lestat', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'even', 'said', 'so', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Louis', 'so', 'miserable', 'exactly', 'Louis', 'Armand', 'was', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'yes', 'was', 'older', 'Armand', 'actually', 'everyone', 'admit', 'Antonio', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'seductive', 'manipulative', 'Armand', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'wow', 'was', 'strong', 'character', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'thought', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'anything', 'yet', 'child', 'was', 'strong', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'played', 'Claudia', 'flawlessly', 'Rea', 'only', 'had', 'short', 'time', 'Interview', 'indeed', 'stood', 'out', 'great', 'actor', 'course', 'Slater', 'ever', 'curious', 'boy', 'taping', 'entire', 'story', 'Louis', 'held', 'good', 'ground.Aside', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'was', 'excellent', 'job', 'scene', 'costume', 'music', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'film', 'though', 'how', 'respected', 'work', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'obviously', 'worked', 'hard', 'put', 'right', 'mood', 'put', 'right', 'actors', 'protray', 'certain', 'personalities', 'really', 'respect', 'everyone', 'doing', 'Interview', 'great', 'story', 'deserved', 'great', 'film', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'said', 'wept', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'weep', 'certainly', 'am', 'moved', 'favorite', 'vampire', 'film', 'none', 'other', 'matched', 'up', 'me.You', 'want', 'cheesy', 'teen', 'fluff', 'watch', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'want', 'serious', 'moving', 'grown-', 'up', 'look', 'vampires', 'movie', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'vampire', 'who', 'human', 'story', 'own', 'life', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'life', 'vampire', 'rest', 'film', 'rollarcoaster', 'vampire', 'ups', 'downs', 'interesting', 'people', 'way', 'never', 'ending', 'question', 'What', 'meaning', 'Sit', 'back', 'watch', 'truly', 'amazing', 'tale', 'are', 'vampires', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'reality', 'lives']",Interview With the Vampire

It follows the adventures of Louis de Pont du Lac (Brad Pitt), a 200-year-old vampire hailing from Louisiana, as he recounts the story of his life (and unlife) to interviewer Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater). Along the way we meet his maker Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise), his &quot;daughter&quot; Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), and Armand (Antonio Banderas), leader of the Parisian vampires.Tom Cruise, in my mind, perfectly portrays the elder vampire Lestat...beautiful, cunning, selfish, a seducer, many of the same qualities present in Armand, and possesses an excess of dark humour. Brad Pitt's Louis still clings to the last shreds of his humanity...his sense of right and wrong, the value of life, the horror of killing in order to survive (angstmaster Nick Knight from &quot;Forever Knight&quot; springs to mind). There is a lack of onscreen romantic tension between Cruise and Pitt...something that makes their relationship seem less immediate and binding. However, there is definitely a spark between Louis and Armand (Antonio Banderas), and it was easy to believe that Louis was tempted to stay as a companion to such an intelligent, beautiful vampire who could teach him the answers to his questions. Kirsten Dunst is phenomenal as Claudia, the vampire with the mind and desires of a woman eternally trapped in the body of a doll-child.The visuals are lavish, moody, stunningly brilliant, especially the world of 1800's New Orleans with its brocades, silks, and elaborate dresses. The atmosphere is appropriately dark, with plenty of fog and menacing nighttime damp. Elliot Goldenthal's score is string-driven, pulsing, tense, and underscores the action perfectly, the crowning piece being &quot;Libera Me&quot;.Yes, this film is graphic at times, including two very graphic scenes involving mutilation, numerous &quot;feedings,&quot; homoeroticism, and brief nudity, but &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is an unconventional drama that probes the meaning of life, death, love, seduction, and regret.

92123,A2VX0PZ1ZDWVDR,0790729687,ScottDel,"[1, 1]","You've read Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice haven't you? If not don't watch this movie until you've read it!It took me along time to accept the idea of Tom Cruise playing a vampire. A very long time. It seemed ridiculous. I couldn't possibly picture him doing it in any good way. But eventually I ended up watching the movie.Tom Cruise looked totally unlike himself in this movie. The film was made in the mid 90s so that might have something to do with it. But it was more than that. He looked totally unlike himself and he did an incredible job acting for this movie. I don't know how this came to be. Somehow he set aside his type mediocre acting for exceptional acting in this film.Enough about Tom Cruise though.This movie begins, as the book does, with a young man asking the vampire Louis for an interview. Louis agrees to tell his life story. Louis has his own personal reasons for doing this. He feels a need to tell his story and that the time is right to do so.The film skips the details of Louis' background. From there it stays fairly close to the book while leaving out a large amount of detail. For example, the wealth that Louis brought with him that allowed him to lead the lifestyle that he had.(Not to mention loot from dead victims.)The characterization and character development of the movie is very strong. Philosophical questions are explored and discussed. That is largely what the book is all about and Anne Rice was involved in the project to make sure he vision was realized.The cinematography of this film is very good. I didn't notice it lacking at all. And poor cinematography and directing is what often kills otherwise good stories. But that wasn't the case here so I was pleased.It was a fun and moving film to watch even though I knew the story.

I will point out that fans of the book may be disappointed as significant changes have been made (most notably the homoeroticism that was the backbone of the book is seriously underplayed) but I still enjoyed the movie. It is important to point out the performance of Kirsten Dunst, at the age of 12, (Claudia) she establishes herself quite strongly as a fantastic young actress. Christian Slater as the interviewer is equally great.Louis rather than choosing the death he desires makes the conscience decision to become a vampire joining forces with Lestat in what is obviously a ""partnership"". Unlike Louis, Lestat is unable to reconcile himself to everything involved in being a vampire and soon his erstwhile mortal morals begin to get the best of him much to the disdain of Lestat.This is a tale of love, desire, betrayal, lonliness, desperation and hunger.Seeking more, they become ""parents"" to a disillusioned child/vampire. Claudia brings a flash of innocence to the story while making it clear that she is deadly, a doll cuddling vampire that will forever remain a child. Louis and Claudia immediately form a bond (perhaps because of the loss of Louis' wife and child during childbirth). Slowly, deliberately, she drives a wedge between Louis and Lestat by taking Louis' love and attention away from Lestat. As can be imagined, the results are devastating.Free of Lestat, Louis and Claudia depart for Paris, where Louis seeks out other vampires ( he has no choice now but to go on). He comes upon Antonio Banderas (the vampire Armand), who quietly helps him, quite seductively I might add. Armand asks Louis to join him, to be by his side, to allow him to teach him (ok, homoeroticism is clearly evident here). There is a brief scene where the viewer is positive Louis is about to kiss Armand but the moment is lost.Anne Rice does a beautiful job with the screenplay (one would expect that since she is the author of the book). And even though she originally was against the casting of Tom Cruise, this statement was later recanted publicly after she saw his performance first-hand. She felt that he did do justice to the character she created.Cruise, Pitt, Dunst, Banderas and even Slater all performed superbly and derserve credit for a job well done.Alright, the dialogue does get a little cheesy at times and Brad Pitt underplays his character just a little. But, as vampire movies go, this is one of the best ever made. Director Neil Jordan gives us a dark, dramatic epic tale that is stunningly directed.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in a great vampire movie or just a well written drama.",5,Vampire Love Betrayal and Beyond,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,2753,"['As', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Louis', 'must', 'admit', 'Both', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'were', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'fans', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'significant', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'most', 'notably', 'homoeroticism', 'was', 'backbone', 'book', 'seriously', 'underplayed', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'important', 'point', 'out', 'performance', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'age', '12', 'Claudia', 'quite', 'strongly', 'fantastic', 'young', 'actress', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'interviewer', 'equally', 'great.Louis', 'rather', 'choosing', 'death', 'conscience', 'decision', 'become', 'vampire', 'joining', 'forces', 'Lestat', 'what', 'obviously', 'partnership', 'Louis', 'Lestat', 'unable', 'reconcile', 'everything', 'involved', 'being', 'vampire', 'soon', 'erstwhile', 'mortal', 'morals', 'begin', 'get', 'best', 'much', 'disdain', 'Lestat.This', 'tale', 'love', 'desire', 'betrayal', 'lonliness', 'desperation', 'hunger.Seeking', 'more', 'become', 'parents', 'disillusioned', 'child/vampire', 'Claudia', 'flash', 'innocence', 'story', 'making', 'clear', 'deadly', 'doll', 'cuddling', 'vampire', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'child', 'Louis', 'Claudia', 'immediately', 'form', 'bond', 'perhaps', 'loss', 'Louis', 'wife', 'child', 'childbirth', 'Slowly', 'deliberately', 'wedge', 'Louis', 'Lestat', 'taking', 'Louis', 'love', 'attention', 'away', 'Lestat', 'can', 'be', 'imagined', 'results', 'are', 'devastating.Free', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'Claudia', 'depart', 'Paris', 'where', 'Louis', 'out', 'other', 'vampires', 'choice', 'now', 'go', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'vampire', 'Armand', 'who', 'quietly', 'quite', 'seductively', 'might', 'add', 'Armand', 'Louis', 'join', 'be', 'side', 'allow', 'teach', 'ok', 'homoeroticism', 'clearly', 'evident', 'here', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'viewer', 'positive', 'Louis', 'kiss', 'Armand', 'moment', 'lost.Anne', 'Rice', 'beautiful', 'job', 'screenplay', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'author', 'book', 'even', 'originally', 'was', 'casting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'statement', 'was', 'later', 'recanted', 'publicly', 'saw', 'performance', 'first-hand', 'felt', 'did', 'do', 'justice', 'character', 'created.Cruise', 'Pitt', 'Dunst', 'Banderas', 'even', 'Slater', 'performed', 'superbly', 'derserve', 'credit', 'job', 'well', 'done.Alright', 'dialogue', 'get', 'little', 'cheesy', 'times', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'vampire', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'epic', 'tale', 'stunningly', 'directed.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'great', 'vampire', 'movie', 'just', 'well', 'written', 'drama']",Interview With the Vampire
92129,A1QWWT367BZC9D,0790729687,Shellie,"[2, 2]","Interview with the Vampire is probably the most intelligent vampire movie ever made, and if not, then it is certainly my favourite because Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles have the most well rounded and complex vampire characters ever put to pen. Characters like Lestat, Louis or Armand are charismatic, flawed and mysterious and always engage the reader... or in the case of this film, the viewer. This is a compellingly romantic movie that draws one inevitably into its rich and colourful tapestry of two codependent vampire's journey through time. Anne Rice's vampires are unique, to become a vampire you have to be given ""the dark gift"" not just bitten by a vampire; they are not afraid of crucifixes or holy water, garlic does not affect them, and not even a stake through the heart will kill them... they are afraid only of the sun. I really like the fact that Anne Rice has dispensed with most simplistic traditional vampire lore; and that her bewitching creations are not as two dimensionally evil as Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, or those overly charactertured vampires seen in B Grade movies.We first meet Louis (Brad Pitt) the narrator of this film in a sparsely decorated room in San Francisco, he is being interviewed by budding journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) who thinks he might be onto the story of his life. Louis was born in the late 18th Century as a southern plantation owner; he has just lost his beloved wife and child, and thus the will to live. One fateful night while out drunk in New Orleans he meets Lestat... and his life changes forever. Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him two choices: drink from me so you can live forever, or you can die... Louis having nothing to lose chooses to become an immortal. Unlike most vampires Louis stubbornly holds on to the last vestiges of his humanity, refusing to hunt people he feeds off animals. After burning down his plantation manor he and Lestat move into a stylish townhouse in New Orleans, where they set about creating a new life for themselves. Louis and Lestat have a love-hate relationship; for they spend most of their time together bickering, fighting and arguing. Louis thinks Lestat is arrogant and spoilt (indeed he is called the brat prince!) and Lestat thinks Louis is moralistic and sentimental, so to heal the rift between them Lestat ""adopts"" a little girl whose mother has died of the plague. To make a vampire so young is a grave offence in vampire culture; and if Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) is found by other vampires she will most certainly be killed, but Lestat gives her ""the dark gift"" anyway. At first this calculated ploy works; Louis is happy with their ""daughter"" but as Claudia matures and her body doesn't grow she begins to ask questions, and to ultimately resent and despise Lestat. She convinces Louis to help her murder Lestat and dump his inert body in the Louisiana swamps; they then flee to 19th Century Europe, however Lestat is not so easily killed. When they arrive in The Old World they begin their search for other vampires in earnest; and their journey takes them throughout Eastern Europe, but sadly they have no luck... finally after much fruitless searching they end up in Paris. One evening while Louis is wandering through the dark Paris streets he finally meets another vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) leader of a gothic vampire coven. Armand and his followers run The Theatre Des Vampires where they mount plays that mock and parody mortals, even though it is the mortal bourgeoisie that make up its unsuspecting audience. This encounter has tragic consequences for the pair; Armand falls in love with Louis and has Claudia and her new vampire nanny killed so that he can have Louis to himself, but his plan backfires. Stricken with grief Louis takes bloody revenge on the vampire coven, destroying their corrupt and decadent way of life forever. It is now the late 20th Century and Louis has returned to America; and finds himself back in his old hometown of New Orleans, he senses something in a dilapidated old building, enters and finds Lestat... alive but frail and scared, they talk all to briefly and then part ways again.This beautiful, melancholy and sad film is one of those rare movies that is almost as good as the novel it was based on, I only wish it had been a little longer. The movie remains for the most part faithful to the book, for after all it was Anne Rice who wrote the screenplay. Sure Louis in the books has dark hair; Lestat (who was originally meant to be played by Julian Sands) is six foot tall, and Armand is an eternal teenager... but these are only minor quibbles that don't mar the film. And if you have ever seen the pretty average Queen of the Dammed, the lack lustre sequel, then you will realize what a truly wonderful film Neil Jordan has crafted. This highly romantic film is for me the ultimate chickflick with its hunky three lead actors, I mean they are all so broodingly handsome! So if you enjoyed Interview with the Vampire; I strongly urge you to begin exploring Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and New Tales of the Vampires, or even her Lives of the Mayfair Witches which is also set in the same parallel world of seductive vampires, ghosts and secret societies.

92130,A1JDDX70A0XUFO,0790729687,shivatrance,"[5, 5]","Can't say enough about this film.I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles from Interview up until Memnoch, and I was very excited when I first heard that this movie was being made.The film mirrored the book perfectly with exception to the ending.  No spoilers here, but for those in the know, I felt they did the ending because there was never any hope for making the Vampire Lestat novel into a film.  If they did, it would have to be like three hours long, and they don't do that for horror/dramas.The cast was amazing.  I remember at the time hating Brad Pitt for having to endure watching Legend of the Fall with the girlfriend.  I just didn't see him as a serious actor.  And then I saw his performance as Louis.He was brilliant and I don't think that there is any other actor who could have captured the tortured soul of Louis better.And Tom Cruise. . . .I never liked him before either.  What did a guy who did [...] like Cocktail and Days of Thunder have any right to be granted the role of Lestat?  But he was perfect.  He exactly matched Louis's description of his character and mannerisms.  Although as the readers of the series will know, Lestat is a much different character than in this movie as we later see in the Vampire Lestat.When you saw this movie upon its release and were presented with Kirstin Dunst, you knew instantly that she was going to be a star for generations.  I have never seen, even to this day and even counting Haley Joel Osment's turn in the Sixth Sense and better acting performance in a young person.  Never.  And when you see this film, you have to be in agreement.  To go from playing the part of a nine year-old girl to playing an ageless vampire with the wisdom seen in her many years is a daunting task, and the way she handled it left you with the feeling that she will have much more to show us in her years to come.The only disappointment I had was in Antonio Bandaras.  Armand is supposed to be a teen when he died, not a slightly overweight forty year old.

It's a rare thing for hollywood to stick closely to the authors story.Another thing that amazed me was how good Tom Cruze and Brad Pitt where in the movie. Like a lot of people I thought Tom would not be cut out to play such a dark role and Brad well I did not really have a thought on him at the time. Brad shows such depth in the role of Louis the vampire of regret and sorrow for all things pasted. And Tom really did surprise the hell out me and after reading the book I felt he kept true to the feel of Lesta.  One thing I can say that will blow you away about this movie is Claudia played by Kristin Dunst, a young vamp like maybe the age of 10 when Lesta turned her. Cursed to remain forever the child. Given that the matter of this movie is dark and not really a movie you would normaly think of a child playing a role in it. After all we all grew up thinking vamps were growning ups. Any way Claudia was a prowerful character and I think Kristin at times out shined even Brad and Tom's characters. You had no problem believeing she was a vamp and that this was a first for her to play. She played it well and held her own in this movie.Really ladies and Gents this is a good movie and its just a shame Hollywood and Ann could not have gotten Neil Jorden to direct the last vampire movie Ann let hollywood do.

92136,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0790729687,S. Schell,"[3, 3]","Very rarely do films compare with their literary counterparts, being that movies simply cannot reach the psychological perimeter that first and third-person novels attain. There is no delving into the plotting brains of  the conniving villains and even the whole-hearted protaganists. We're left  wondering what they're thinking, no matter how good an actor it is that's  playing their part. This movie, however, kept my attentions without falling  short of expectation or accuracy in adaptation. The cinematography, set  design, special effects make-up and immaculate 19th-century attire were  luscious and realistic. The time period is vivid and beautiful, even when  we are viewing it in the darkest of midnights throughout the movie. Colors  are slightly neutralized and the faces are as clean and beautiful as we  would expect them to be.Tom Cruise is sensational as the debonaire and  malevolent Lestat, an other-worldly creature with lingering grace, extreme  vanity and a zealous motivation for murder. A velvet tongue and feminine  sophistication, he lures both men and women alike into his arms, whispering  sweet nothings and seducing their lives away.Kirsten Dunst is sheer  perfection as Claudia, the ageless angel of death with the visage of a  doll-like porcelain beauty. Her voice was literally the sweet tinkle of a  silver bell, a description recited quite a few times in the novel. Beneath  her powdery complexion and innocent, rosy-lipped smiles lies a gratuitous  penchant for blood, the core of her survival and ultimately her outlet for  her hatred of Lestat.Louis is the tortured soul, a remorseful creation  full of woes and self-loathing. Brad Pitt definetely had the beauty the  character called for - the long, silky brunette hair, the chiseled features  and the sorrowful but lovely gaze with his brilliant viridian eyes (they're  actually blue, but the green contacts were interesting). Pitt did a  wonderful job with his role, but I think Cruise and Dunst blew him out of  the rink. The villians are always more fun, anyway.Where the story line  comes into play, there is no falling short of detail, with a few minor  exceptions in the beginning. People who have read the re-popularized novel  by Anne Rice will know what those fine details are, but in the end they  aren't of any significance to what rightfully remained. There are quotes  pulled directly from the book that fall in just the right places without  sounding trite or contrived. The old superstitions (stake in the heart, no  reflection in mirrors) are stamped out with more realistic beliefs, such as  the undead being consumed by flames and sunlight, but there are some  interesting twists added, such as the imbibing of blood with inactive red  and white cells, or blood from corpses, to put it simply (&quot;dead  blood&quot;).Now, a compliment to the heart-racing and emotionally  driven soundtrack, orchestrated by a collossal talent named Eliot  Goldenthal. The soundtrack for this movie, I think, is his greatest  achievement so far in musical composition and originality. It has the glory  of a ballroom scene in late 1800's New Orleans with the suffocating  corsets, rouged cheeks and blanched wigs. The score stabs and swipes in  harmony with moments of tension, the perfect example being Claudia's  explosion of rage, accompanied by Goldenthal's piece entitled  &quot;Claudia's Allegro Agitato&quot;. Listen and watch, and you'll be  amazed at how perfectly the score compliments each scene.I have only one  qualm with this film, and this is why I only rank it four and three-quarter  stars - Antonio Banderas. This was the only casting mistake. Don't get me  wrong, he wasn't bad, but he wasn't a good character representation for  Armand. Armand is almost a child. He was seventeen when he was created,  therefore has a very child-like face. Plus, he's Italian. Why a  30-year-old, Spanish-speaking actor? I don't get it...I imagine in her  personal viewing of the film before it hit theaters, Anne Rice had only one  regret: the letter she personally penned to Tom Cruise begging him to pull  out of the role of Lestat. Now that's egg on her face...or should I say  blood?",5,Exquisite Visual Mold of Modern Literature (4.75 stars),963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,4183,"['Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'films', 'compare', 'literary', 'counterparts', 'being', 'movies', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'psychological', 'perimeter', 'first', 'third-person', 'novels', 'attain', 'delving', 'plotting', 'brains', 'conniving', 'villains', 'even', 'whole-hearted', 'protaganists', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'movie', 'however', 'kept', 'attentions', 'falling', 'short', 'expectation', 'accuracy', 'adaptation', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'immaculate', '19th-century', 'attire', 'were', 'luscious', 'realistic', 'time', 'period', 'vivid', 'beautiful', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'viewing', 'darkest', 'midnights', 'movie', 'Colors', 'are', 'slightly', 'neutralized', 'are', 'clean', 'beautiful', 'would', 'expect', 'be.Tom', 'Cruise', 'sensational', 'debonaire', 'malevolent', 'Lestat', 'other-worldly', 'creature', 'lingering', 'grace', 'extreme', 'vanity', 'zealous', 'motivation', 'murder', 'velvet', 'tongue', 'feminine', 'sophistication', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'arms', 'whispering', 'sweet', 'nothings', 'seducing', 'lives', 'away.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'Claudia', 'ageless', 'angel', 'death', 'visage', 'doll-like', 'porcelain', 'beauty', 'voice', 'was', 'literally', 'sweet', 'tinkle', 'silver', 'bell', 'description', 'recited', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'novel', 'powdery', 'complexion', 'innocent', 'rosy-lipped', 'smiles', 'gratuitous', 'penchant', 'blood', 'core', 'survival', 'ultimately', 'outlet', 'hatred', 'Lestat.Louis', 'tortured', 'soul', 'remorseful', 'creation', 'full', 'woes', 'self-loathing', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'definetely', 'had', 'beauty', 'character', 'called', 'long', 'silky', 'brunette', 'hair', 'chiseled', 'features', 'sorrowful', 'lovely', 'gaze', 'brilliant', 'viridian', 'eyes', ""'re"", 'actually', 'blue', 'green', 'contacts', 'were', 'interesting', 'Pitt', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'role', 'think', 'Cruise', 'Dunst', 'blew', 'rink', 'villians', 'are', 'always', 'more', 'fun', 'anyway.Where', 'story', 'line', 'play', 'falling', 'short', 'detail', 'few', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'beginning', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'read', 're-popularized', 'novel', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'fine', 'details', 'are', 'end', 'are', ""n't"", 'significance', 'what', 'rightfully', 'remained', 'are', 'quotes', 'pulled', 'directly', 'book', 'fall', 'just', 'right', 'places', 'sounding', 'trite', 'contrived', 'old', 'superstitions', 'stake', 'heart', 'reflection', 'mirrors', 'are', 'stamped', 'out', 'more', 'realistic', 'beliefs', 'such', 'undead', 'being', 'consumed', 'flames', 'sunlight', 'are', 'interesting', 'twists', 'added', 'such', 'imbibing', 'blood', 'inactive', 'red', 'white', 'cells', 'blood', 'corpses', 'put', 'simply', 'quot', 'dead', 'blood', 'quot', '.Now', 'compliment', 'heart-racing', 'emotionally', 'driven', 'soundtrack', 'orchestrated', 'collossal', 'talent', 'named', 'Eliot', 'Goldenthal', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'think', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'so', 'far', 'musical', 'composition', 'originality', 'glory', 'ballroom', 'scene', 'late', '1800', 'New', 'Orleans', 'suffocating', 'corsets', 'rouged', 'cheeks', 'blanched', 'wigs', 'score', 'stabs', 'swipes', 'harmony', 'moments', 'tension', 'perfect', 'example', 'being', 'Claudia', 'explosion', 'rage', 'accompanied', 'Goldenthal', 'piece', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Claudia', 'Allegro', 'Agitato', 'quot', 'Listen', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'perfectly', 'score', 'compliments', 'scene.I', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'qualm', 'film', 'why', 'only', 'rank', 'four', 'three-quarter', 'stars', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'was', 'only', 'casting', 'mistake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'character', 'representation', 'Armand', 'Armand', 'almost', 'child', 'was', 'seventeen', 'when', 'was', 'created', 'therefore', 'very', 'child-like', 'face', 'Italian', 'Why', '30-year-old', 'Spanish-speaking', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'imagine', 'personal', 'viewing', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'regret', 'letter', 'personally', 'penned', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'begging', 'pull', 'role', 'Lestat', 'Now', 'egg', 'face', 'should', 'say', 'blood']",Interview With the Vampire

This was much better then Queen of the Damned.  I  really like vampire stuff, because it keeps me interested in the genre, reading  books about them, not only that this film takes you into a different time, into a world of darkenss beyond the one we live day by day. I thought Brad, Tom, Antonio, made a great blood sucking team.  Kristin Dunst did a job well done for her first bite, on film.  She pulled it off so well, that she freaked me out the first time I saw her in it. The setting in New Orleans, and the farm, was setting the mood right. The cemitery scenes were, really creepy. It was really cool, how they showed you, as the years pasted, and how they survived and how they must feed to keep on living. This movie was a thrill ride, its perfict for the Halloween season.  Even thou it had alot of blood, hey whats a vampires life with out blood? This is not a kids movie, so be ""warned"".  It's a story mix with every element in it, love, betrayal, death, and mystery, and action. This film will be on top along with the rest of  my vampire/Dracula movie collection.

Then there was Cruise shrieking about the homo-eroticism being too much (from the man who made locker room love Top Gun this is bizarre!) and so on.By all accounts, it should have been a disaster, but thanks to a great director, cinematography to die for (scuse the pun), staggering sets and an extraordinary cast, IWTV stands up as one of the best vamp films ever.Yup, the book is better, but as far as translating to screen goes, a lot of the narrative tries to be faithful.  Let's face it, if it followed the book, we'd have been sitting through a lot longer film!Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are two of my most disliked actors.  Yet Cruise's smarmy grin is perfect for narcissistic Lestat, all the pomp and splendor and ego of the character isn't much of a stretch for Tom... And Pitt's pretty boy looks and peculiar way of talking strangely ends up exactly as I had always pictured Louis.  He may have had a rotten time filming, but as it seems to have given him the chops to turn Louis into the tortured anti-hero, I'm very glad it wasn't all chocolate boxes and roses for the fellow.The muted colours of New Orleans and Paris are stunning and quite decadent, with tinges and splashes of red throughout reminding us what flows throughout the film.  Apart from a couple of dodgy looking backdrops, the sets are fairly staggering scale wise and lend brilliantly to the telling.  The effects, the teeth, the veins and the iridescent eyes, are wonderful (making the Buffy cast look like they've been mucking about with modelling clay) and give the vampires a natural (rather than full out preternatural)look to remind us that the Dark Gift really isn't about turning into bats and wolves, but being anchored to the earth by the cruellest means possible.The falldown is Armand who, with Antonio Banderas looking rather embarrassed to be sloping about candlelit dungeons, is not at all the angel-faced, auburn haired charmer I'd hoped for.  But the relationship between Dunst (Claudia) and Pitt more than makes up for this little disappointment - the full thrust of the grown woman in a child's body and the horror of it is excellently portrayed.  The hair chopping scene is quite, quite jarring and Louis's discovery of her body sums it all up.IWTV has a rubbishy end for the book lover, but ties in neatly if you think about it.

However, I really enjoyed this movie!  Tom Cruise was very impressive as Lestat, along with Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst giving passionate performances.  For those who aren't familiar with the story, here's an extremely abridged version.A landowner in the 1700's, (Pitt), wife dies.  He's understandably sad, even has a death wish.  A vampire, Lestat, (Cruise), takes him up on his wish and makes him immortal.  The story is what takes place over the next 200 years in their undead existence, uncluding a trip to Paris' underworld, the creation of a child-vampire, (Kirsten Dunst), and the never ending search for ""what's it all mean?""  As a wraparound piece, the vampire Louis, (Pitt), is being interviewed by a reporter in modern day San Fransisco, hence the title.It's a very engaging story, told from the vampire's point of view, kind of an autobiography.I remember when the movie was first released Oprah Winfrey did a studio audience screening, and her guest for the day was Tom Cruise.  I remember audience members asking Cruise questions like, ""How could you possibly play such an evil character?""Tom kept replying, ""It's only a movie, and only a fictional character.""  I think it was a testament to his evolving talent and a great leap of faith on his part.  Kudos Mr. Cruise!It's a great movie.

Rice's incantation conjured up such names for the casting of this high-profile role as Alexander Godunov, Cher and Peter Weller, who probably had scheduling problems anyway doing films like THE NEW AGE and cable movies with actors like Robert Hays. Then, director Neil Jordan announced Tom Cruise would play the tall, blond European vampire -- it was as if he had uttered Richard Grieco -- and the realized film was reduced to an assessment of Cruise's Lestat. What everyone missed, while hanging on to Tom's every ""mon Dieu,"" was Jordan's ability to turn a novel with a flaccid film premise into something worth watching.INTERVIEW is not the greatest idea for a movie -- the dozens of aborted screenplay attempts and the 17 years it took to finally reach the big screen are evidence enough -- because it's neither suspenseful nor scary. Because it is told through the eyes of a vampire, we are asked to identify with a predator. We stalk the helpless. We don't feel frightened, we feel guilty. The examination of a sourpuss lamenting his fate for two centuries may make for good reading, but the idea doesn't exactly put you at the edge of your seat. Vampire movies told through the eyes of the predator are best-suited for comedy, as in Love at First Bite -- well, maybe not best-suited -- or metaphor, as in The Hunger. So what about Interview? Jordan said, ""What fascinates me about [the film] is the absence of moral responsibility."" Well, he's hinting at the truth. For our money, Interview is about the torment of being a celebrity.Brad Pitt says, ""I'm flesh and blood, but not human."" Pick a star, any star. Christian Bale? Nicolas Cage? Flesh and blood, sure. But human? Pitt's tale reads as that of a celebrity thrust into the limelight searching for the secrets of how to be a headliner. Cruise, the biggest superstar in town, chose Pitt as his lifetime co-star -- for his beauty? Definitely. Because he owns a sprawling plantation? Couldn't hurt. The pretty boys live the high life, but Pitt can't snip his ties to the little people and so resorts to common junk food binges. If Cruise has any tricks on handling fame, he's sure as hell not sharing them with the whiny, I-don't-want-to-be-a-star Pitt; so he figures to shut him up by biting him a gift -- child actor Kirsten Dunst. This is Cruise's fatal mistake, for he should know better than to have a kid for a co-star. Just ask W.C. Fields or anyone who had to share screen time with Macaulay Culkin.As with most child stars, Dunst's fans won't let her grow up. When she lops off her trademark locks in hopes of changing her image, those precious curly Q's just grow back -- Shirley Temple forever. This clearly explains why Zac Efron won't be seen in NATURAL BORN KILLERS II anytime soon. But then Dunst does what child stars do best: she upstages the headliner. With Cruise out of the spotlight, Pitt is forced to carry the burden of fame on his own. He decides he needs guidance. So why not go to Paris?In Paris, Pitt finds his counselor in the form of Antonio Banderas, who appears to have been a big deal in his day but now hosts a lame television show -- metaphorically speaking, of course. Banderas tells Pitt, ""You have to be powerful, beautiful and have no regrets."" (Is he referring to Sharon Stone?) Being a show-biz veteran, Banderas has the good sense to can the child actor, cancel the TV show and jump-start his career with the new hot star, Pitt. Although coming very close to kissing Banderas, Pitt won't have this has-been riding his coattails. So, he's off yet again, this time to America.Back home, Pitt catches a foul aroma only celebrities can smell -- the scent of a dead career. He follows the stench to find Cruise in the Jon Voight Home of Former Leading Men. Cruise pathetically recalls his salad days, forcing Pitt to flee because failed stardom is catchy. Still somewhat of an ingenue when it comes to fame management, Pitt fails to take into account the possibility of the ever-elusive comeback. Too bad Travolta wasn't around to tip him off. Interview ends on the hopeful note that anyone can return to glory once more -- Kevin Costner, Burt Reynolds, The Two Coreys... (well, maybe not anyone.)While there are plenty of films about celebrities -- Sunset Boulevard, A Star Is Born -- none get deeper in the skin, or more inside the head, of the immortal superstar than

92150,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0790729687,Themis-Athena,"[10, 16]","""Libera me, Domine, de vitae aeterna"" - ""Free me, Lord, from eternal life"":  If a movie begins with a choir and boy soprano singing these words, in a requiem's style and overlaying the camera's sweeping move over nightly San Francisco bay, zooming in on a Victorian building's top-floor window after having followed the life on the street below like a hunter follows its prey - if a movie begins like this, you know you're not looking at your average flick, whatever its subject.  (And if the first thing you catch is the Latin phrase's grammatical mistake, this is probably not your kind of movie to begin with).Much-discussed even before its release, due not least to Anne Rice's temporary withdrawal of support and her no less sensational subsequent 180-degree turn, Neil Jordan's adaptation of the ""Vampire Chronicles""' first part, based on Rice's own screenplay, is a sumptuous production awash in luminous colors, magnificent period decor and costumes, rich fabrics, heavy crystal, elegant silverware and gallons of deeply scarlet blood, supremely photographed by Phillippe Rousselot, with a constant undercurrent of sensuality and seduction; an audiovisual orgy substantiated by one of recent film history's most ingenious scores (by Elliot Goldenthal).  Although the book only gained notoriety after the publication of its sequel ""The Vampire Lestat,"" followed in short order by the ""Chronicles""' third installment, ""The Queen of the Damned,"" by the time this movie was produced, Rice had acquired a large and loyal fan base, who would have been ready to tear it to shreds had it failed to meet their expectations.  That this was not unanimously the case is in and of itself testimony to Neil Jordan's considerable achievement (only underscored by the botched 2002 realization of ""Queen of the Damned"").  Sure, some decry the plot changes vis-a-vis the novel and the fact that some of the protagonists (particularly Louis and Armand) look different from Rice's description.  But others have embraced the movie wholeheartedly; praising it for remaining faithful to the fundamentalities of Rice's story and for its production values as such.  I find myself firmly in the latter corner; indeed, in some respects I consider this one of the rare movies that are superior to their literary originals - primarily because the story's two main characters, Louis and Lestat, gain considerably in stature and complexity compared to Rice's book.While both film and novel are narrated by Louis (Brad Pitt), giving an interview to a reporter (Christian Slater) in the hope of achieving some minimal atonement for 200 years of sin and guilt, and while Lestat (Tom Cruise) appears on screen barely half the movie's running time, Lestat is much more of a central character than in Rice's novel; and vastly more interesting.  For Anne Rice's Lestat only comes into his own in the ""Chronicles""' second part, which is named for him and where we truly learn to appreciate him as the vampire world's aristocratic, arrogant, wicked, intelligent and unscrupulous ""brat prince,"" who although completely lacking regret for any of his actions nevertheless shows occasional glimpses of caring, even if he would never admit thereto.  *This*, however, is exactly the movie's Lestat; not the comparatively uninformed and, all things considered, even somewhat brutish creature of Rice's first novel.  It is no small feat on Tom Cruise's part to have accomplished this; and in my mind his portrayal has completely eclipsed the character's original conception, which was reportedly based on Rutger Hauer's Captain Navarre in ""Ladyhawke.""Similarly, while every bit as guilt-ridden as the character created by Anne Rice, Brad Pitt's Louis regains more inner strength - and more quickly so - than the narrator of Rice's book, rendering him more of an even foil for Lestat, and equally lending greater credibility to his initial selection as Lestat's companion, his actions to ensure his and Claudia's escape to Europe, and his later decision not to stay with Armand.  (Indeed, Louis's and Armand's separation after the burning of the Theatre of the Vampires makes perfect sense in the movie's context; it would have undercut both characters', but especially Louis's credibility had they gone on to share years of companionship like in the book.)Kirsten Dunst's Claudia was not only this movie's biggest discovery - not surprisingly, in an interview included on the DVD Dunst calls this ""the most prominent role"" of her career so far - she, too, embodies the novel's child vampire to absolute perfection; capturing her eternally childlike features as well as her Lolitaesque seductiveness and the ruthless killer hidden under her doll-like appearance.  Doubtlessly furthest from the novel's character is Antonio Banderas's powerful and charismatic Armand:  But while I do somewhat miss Rice's auburn-haired ""Botticelli angel,"" I always had a problem imagining him as the leader of the Paris coven, in control even of the quicksilver-like Santiago (marvelously portrayed by Stephen Rea in one of his most overtly theatrical performances).  Here, too, the movie - if anything - gives the story greater credibility; although it's admittedly hard to reconcile with parts of the ""Chronicles""' later installments, particularly Armand's own biography.In interviews, Neil Jordan and Brad Pitt particularly have mentioned the emotional strain that this movie put on all its participants; due its almost exclusively nightly shooting schedule, and even more so because of its incessant exploration of guilt, damnation and, literally, hell on earth.  Anne Rice's vampires truly are the ultimate outsiders; no longer part of human society, they feed on it, can neither be harmed by sickness nor by methods the world has taken for granted ever since Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" (which are in fact merely ""the vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman,"" as Louis explains, simultaneously amused and contemptuous) and are thus, if not killed by fire and/or beheading, condemned to walk the earth forever, without any hope of redemption.  It is primarily this element which has given Rice's novels their lasting appeal, and which is perfectly rendered in Jordan's adaptation.  I'm still not sure I'd ever want to meet them in person, though ...Also recommended:Complete Vampire Chronicles (Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the Damned, The Tale of

And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in ""...Vampire"", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)...

I would have liked to see the complex relationship of Louis and Claudia displayed in more detail, but overall I have to say that I was extremely pleased with the way that this movie portrays this magnificent, seductive (and sometimes erotic) story of the genuine charatcter of Louis the vampire.
