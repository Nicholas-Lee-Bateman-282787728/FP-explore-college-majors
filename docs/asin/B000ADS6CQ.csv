926269,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000ADS6CQ,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This is a great entry into the realm of indy film making. The producers used much of the money they garnered for the actors and writer. The sets are few and sparce. Much of the lighting appears natural. The music score, as nifty as it is, is played by a very few instruments. No razzle dazzle. Just good writing and acting.Here's the scoop. Albert is challenged but he can ice fish better than the best. He wins serious amounts of money in contests. His mother, however, is overbearing. She does whatever she has to, including lying to him, to keep him down. She gets killed by a hit and run and all of the sudden a couple of people come out of the woodwork to be his ""friend"" (or father) because they want to ""help"" him. The schemes don't go as planned.This is kind of intense. You feel for this guy because he's an innocent and there are people trying to take advantage of him. And these people are creepy. Randy Quaid's performance (particularly in light of his recent troubles) will really make you want to take a shower. Alison Folland as Tuey Stites, along with her hypochondriac brother, is another one. She'll do or say what is necessary to get her hands on his money. Generally speaking, the story plays out quite well. There are a couple of things that might make it more than a bit difficult to suspend your disbelief, and the ending will probably leave you scratching your head. But this is a solid effort that won't tax the 95 minutes it asks of you. The veterans turn in fine performances. Folland's performance is a bit uneven but she has a few really good scenes.If you like traveling down indy road stop at Milwaukee Minnesota, You'll probably enjoy your stay.",4,Not of Hollywood Stuff,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1677,"['great', 'entry', 'realm', 'indy', 'film', 'making', 'producers', 'used', 'much', 'money', 'garnered', 'actors', 'writer', 'sets', 'are', 'few', 'sparce', 'Much', 'lighting', 'natural', 'music', 'score', 'as', 'nifty', 'played', 'very', 'few', 'instruments', 'razzle', 'dazzle', 'Just', 'good', 'writing', 'acting.Here', 'scoop', 'Albert', 'challenged', 'can', 'ice', 'fish', 'better', 'best', 'serious', 'amounts', 'money', 'contests', 'mother', 'however', 'overbearing', 'including', 'lying', 'keep', 'down', 'killed', 'hit', 'run', 'sudden', 'couple', 'people', 'come', 'woodwork', 'be', 'friend', 'father', 'want', 'help', 'schemes', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'planned.This', 'kind', 'intense', 'feel', 'guy', 'innocent', 'are', 'people', 'trying', 'take', 'advantage', 'people', 'are', 'creepy', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'particularly', 'light', 'recent', 'troubles', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'want', 'take', 'shower', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'Tuey', 'Stites', 'hypochondriac', 'brother', 'one', ""'ll"", 'do', 'say', 'what', 'necessary', 'get', 'hands', 'money', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'story', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'might', 'make', 'more', 'bit', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'solid', 'effort', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tax', '95', 'minutes', 'veterans', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'Folland', 'performance', 'bit', 'uneven', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'scenes.If', 'traveling', 'down', 'indy', 'road', 'stop', 'Milwaukee', 'Minnesota', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'stay']",N/A
926270,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ADS6CQ,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","MILWAUKEE, MINNESOTA has everything you'd hope to find in an Indie film - good offbeat story, strong cast mixing established actors with new talent that brings out the best in both, a director who lets the story unfold naturally, enough messages to cast away any doubts that the world is lacking in spirit and caring, and an impressive list of contributors that demonstrates that there are many people who appreciate and love fine film.  Writer Richard Murphy and Director Allan Mindel have shaped a tale about a mentally challenged young man and his inner strengths that allow him to make his mark on the world through sheer courage: they have succeeded in creating a memorable, touching, warmly human film.Albert Burroughs (Troy Garity) is a twenty-something sweet lad, mentally challenged but able to maintain a job as a copy clerk for old man McNally (Bruce Dern) while he is closely overprotected by his mother Edna (Debra Monk).  Troy's one pastime is ice fishing and because he is sensitive to the language of the fishes he has become the champion ice fisher of Wisconsin, earning prizes that amount to considerable savings!  Worried that the outside world (outside of Milwaukee!) might be abusive to her son, Edna has prevented his entering contests in such places as neighboring Minnesota, places where Albert could truly become a star.Quite suddenly Edna is killed in by a hit and run driver and Albert is left to his own devices for survival.  News of his inheritance and contest winnings seeps into the world and characters begin to appear to take advantage of 'the retard': the smarmy Jerry (Randy Quaid) tries to convince Albert he is his real father; Tuey (Allison Folland) and her cancerphobic younger brother Stan (Hank Harris) are cheap con artists who try to steal his money; a transvestite (Holly Woodlawn) and her bodyguard Gary (Josh Brolin) wiggle into the stew created by Tuey and Stan and further go after Albert's money; and McNally posts his own agenda for 'care' of Albert and his 'fortune'.  How each of these attempts to take advantage of Albert play out forms the line of the story, with an ending that finds Albert leading his life as an ice fisherman who is a champion in more ways than one.Though obviously shot on a low budget this film succeeds on the important levels of communication and goes beyond the ordinary with some stunning photography by Bernd Heinl and a wonderful musical score by Michael Convertino and Robert Muzingo.  Troy Garity (son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden) holds his own in a role that could fall into parody and demonstrates that he is growing into a fine actor. And it helps to have the likes of Bruce Dern and Randy Quaid in the mix! This is the kind of film that is refreshing to see made. Would that Hollywood would invest in stories of this caliber!

Director Allan Mindel and screenwriter Richard Murphy don't appear to know much about the chilly milieu where ice-fishing is the sport of the day, nor do they seem to connect with the guileless young man at the heart of the story. Many of the performances--and every bit of the hopelessly clich&eacute;d dialogue--are equally lousy. Troy Garity has a handsome, welcoming face, but he seems to have been cast solely for his resemblance to a young Dustin Hoffman--and the cadence of his voice is kept too similar to Hoffman's in ""Rain Man"" for Garity to carve out a convincing portrayal. Veterans Randy Quaid and Bruce Dern give it some vigor, but Alison Folland's opportunistic tramp seems to have wandered in from a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch.

926272,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000ADS6CQ,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 1]","Small independent movie with a story about the ways that fate protects the weak.  Our main character is a young man who is mentally challanged and lives with his mother.  When he is not working in a copy shop, he is ice fishing.  His devoted mother taught him how to fish, but it seems that our young man has a talent for them too.  A state champion who won 17 consecutive competitions, he has accumulated significant amount of money.  But when his mother gets killed in the car accident, this young man has no family to lean and depend on.  Before long, hangers on are everywhere looking for a way to fleece him of his money.  Shy, trusting and unable to care for himself, this young man is left to his own devices to fend for himself.Most young actors still have to learn about acting, but there are some professionals here too that give a wonderful performance.  Bruce Dern plays copy shop owner who turns out to be our young man's father and Josh Brolan gives a magnificent performance in his small, supporting role of a midwestern drifter who likes to wear ladies undergarments (halters and stockings to be exact).Wonderful story about the hope and redemption, but still feel a little bit amateurish.
