Some of it was downright cheesy.-Characters are typical, almost like stock characters.-There are a few boring bits.It's a B-rated movie that's not as bad as it could have been.  The characters and plot are a little bland, but it is pretty exciting and has some interesting ideas and scenes.  It's not as great as ""RoboCop"" or the ""Matrix,"" but would be a good compliment to something like ""The Lawnmower Man"" or ""Virtuosity.""The disc is only in fullscreen and has no special features.

You either liked this movie or you did not. No classic performances. No Oscar nominations. Just good old fationed actioned and superpowers.This would have been a great lead off movie for a series. The fight scenes were great, just the right amount of romance, but there could have been a little less of the shootouts. Joe Lara is one of those actors that should have been a bigger star, but since he is imprisoned in these B-Rated movies, at least he is doing good work.

374484,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,6303439705,Jeffery Mingo,"[1, 2]","It turns out that this film was made the same year as ""Virtuosity.""  They say Hollywood scriptwriters come up with ideas at the same time.  That is so true here.  I don't know which film imitated which, but they have much in common.  This film also takes much from ""Robocop.""Evan Lurie not only acted in the film, but directed and produced it.  He played the villain and I would imagine that most people so involved would put themselves in the hero's role.  I'm surprised that a B-movie actor had enough clout to make a film.  Good for him!  Still, he was cowardly in not showing as much of his body as his female love interest shows of hers.The villain and the hero look so much alike, I had to watch the credits to make sure they weren't the same person, identical twins, or brothers.  During the course of the film, the hero gets promoted but his hair gets longer and his beard gets shaggier.  I can't imagine a public office that would allow a superior to look so ragged.In this futuristic film, LA is run by a corporation.  Sound fascist to me.  The villain is trying to overthrow it.  Though he's supposed to be the bad guy, I didn't have a problem with someone overthrowing that type of government.This film had two themes:  what should cops do when a ""bad guy"" has a hostage? and should cops break regulations?  Unfortunately, it never resolves those matters.This film was just one shootout then an explosion and repeat.  It's tedious after awhile.I loved that many blacks had roles in this film.  I appreciated the biracial diversity.  However, this is supposed to take place in Los Angeles, a city that is at least 1/3 Latino now and will only be more so in the future.  It made no sense that this film did not give Latino actors a chance to perform.To the film's credit, it pioneers elements that big-budget Hollywood films may have stolen.  Inmates get frozen:  this tactic was later used in Spielberg's and Cruise's ""Minority Report.""  A mole helps out the bad side just as it would happen in Reeves' ""Matrix.""  The film starts with an unethical black supervisor and his ethic, white trainee just like Denzel Washington's ""Training Day.""  I have to give Lurie points for this.",2,A B-movie with Pioneering Ideas,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,2189,"['out', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'Virtuosity', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'scriptwriters', 'come', 'up', 'ideas', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'true', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'imitated', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'Robocop', 'Evan', 'Lurie', 'not', 'only', 'acted', 'film', 'directed', 'produced', 'played', 'villain', 'would', 'imagine', 'most', 'people', 'so', 'involved', 'would', 'put', 'hero', 'role', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'B-movie', 'actor', 'had', 'enough', 'clout', 'make', 'film', 'Good', 'Still', 'was', 'cowardly', 'not', 'showing', 'much', 'body', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'shows', 'hers.The', 'villain', 'hero', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'watch', 'credits', 'make', 'sure', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'person', 'identical', 'twins', 'brothers', 'course', 'film', 'hero', 'promoted', 'hair', 'longer', 'beard', 'shaggier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'public', 'office', 'would', 'allow', 'superior', 'look', 'so', 'ragged.In', 'futuristic', 'film', 'LA', 'run', 'corporation', 'Sound', 'fascist', 'villain', 'trying', 'overthrow', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'someone', 'overthrowing', 'type', 'government.This', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'themes', 'what', 'should', 'cops', 'do', 'when', 'bad', 'guy', 'hostage', 'should', 'cops', 'break', 'regulations', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'matters.This', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'shootout', 'then', 'explosion', 'repeat', 'tedious', 'awhile.I', 'loved', 'many', 'blacks', 'had', 'roles', 'film', 'appreciated', 'biracial', 'diversity', 'However', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'city', 'least', '1/3', 'Latino', 'now', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'future', 'made', 'sense', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'Latino', 'actors', 'chance', 'perform.To', 'film', 'credit', 'elements', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'stolen', 'get', 'frozen', 'tactic', 'was', 'later', 'used', 'Spielberg', 'Cruise', 'Minority', 'Report', 'mole', 'out', 'bad', 'side', 'just', 'would', 'happen', 'Reeves', 'Matrix', 'film', 'unethical', 'black', 'supervisor', 'ethic', 'white', 'trainee', 'just', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Training', 'Day', 'have', 'give', 'Lurie', 'points']",Hologram Man VHS
374485,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303439705,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","HOLOGRAM MAN is a film from the early nineties that tried to envision a ""Big Brother"" kind of world, with funky looking cars, a biodome over Los Angeles and a nasty corporation running the government.  It's full of hectic shootouts and explosions but doesn't have much of cast or any kind of cohesive plotting.  Joe Lara sleepwalks through his role as Decoda, the cop on a mission, and co-writer/producer/co-star Evan Lurie, muscles ablazing, tries to be a Sylvester Stallone clone, with about as much acting ability.  The effects are cheesy and there's no real logic behind the whole process of holographing these criminals.  And the movie has the most incompetent police force on screen.
