1108659,AJ8CBMFSPRKQU,B000WCDI64,&#60;/&#62;&#60;,"[1, 1]","This was a fantastic 2007 concert by the late Amy Winehouse. She gives one excellent performance and shows the amazing true vocal talent she had.  Filmed in her home town, her Dad and step-Mom and Husband were in the audience and Amy was feeling it. I read some reviews on this DVD that say it's sad to watch this because she was drunk, slurred her words and was out of control. Nothing can be farther from the truth! in between songs Amy talks and jokes with the audience, she talks in a low voice and many misconstrueded she was slurring her words, in the 5.1 mix you can her her spoken words much better. Amy slips some wine through the show but she is in full control here and gives a command performance! The only bad thing through the show is her voice does give a tad, she even admits it but continues on and fires through the numbers. This DVD has her biggist hit ""Valerie"" (Number 2 in the UK) along with ""Rehab"", ""Black to Black"", ""Love is a losing Game"" and more. Filmed in a small but very plush concert hall that has a feel to royalty about it, the cameras have great close ups all through the evening, a truly great filmed event!",5,An intimate night with the late Amy Winehouse,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1143,"['was', 'fantastic', '2007', 'concert', 'late', 'Amy', 'Winehouse', 'one', 'excellent', 'performance', 'amazing', 'true', 'vocal', 'talent', 'had', 'Filmed', 'home', 'town', 'Dad', 'step-Mom', 'Husband', 'were', 'audience', 'Amy', 'was', 'feeling', 'read', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'say', 'sad', 'watch', 'was', 'drunk', 'slurred', 'words', 'was', 'control', 'Nothing', 'can', 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'songs', 'Amy', 'talks', 'jokes', 'audience', 'low', 'voice', 'many', 'misconstrueded', 'was', 'slurring', 'words', '5.1', 'mix', 'can', 'her', 'spoken', 'words', 'much', 'better', 'Amy', 'wine', 'show', 'full', 'control', 'here', 'command', 'performance', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'show', 'voice', 'give', 'tad', 'even', 'fires', 'numbers', 'DVD', 'biggist', 'hit', 'Valerie', 'Number', '2', 'UK', 'Rehab', 'Black', 'Black', 'Love', 'losing', 'Game', 'more', 'Filmed', 'small', 'very', 'plush', 'concert', 'hall', 'feel', 'royalty', 'cameras', 'have', 'great', 'close', 'ups', 'evening', 'truly', 'great', 'filmed', 'event']",N/A
1108660,A3D2DJEHR4U7HC,B000WCDI64,"D. Hinson ""D. Hinson""","[58, 58]","Not since Madonna appeared on the music radar has an artist captivated my eye, ear, and heart the way Ms. Winehouse has.  I realize they are worlds apart musically, but the presence and panache that they both exhibit are what makes me draw the parallel.  Amy has the f-you attitude that Madonna had when she was starting out.  She seems more concerned with doing her thing than warming up to those who would criticize her.  Her delivery comes across as spontaneous, her in-between ramblings as extemporaneous--without any thought or concern for what people will think.  Madonna was never this natural or uncalculated, but just as brash.  And then there is that voice...like Etta James, Billie Holliday, Bettye LaVette, and all The Supremes rolled into one beautiful confection--chased with a shot of Tequila.  Just listen to ""Back To Black"", ""Love Is A Losing Game"", and ""You Know I'm No Good"" and you will see an artiste/icon in the making.  I hope and pray that her time in treatment will bring her back to the road she should be ruling.  It would be a great tragedy for her to fall prey to the same habits that have robbed us of so many of our greatest talents.  Don't let the reviews that talk about her supposed drunkenness dissuade you from buying this dvd--she may be tipsy, but she stays on top of her game, and lets the songs speak very clearly for themselves.  The documentary is fascinating--with her demo performance included alongside observations from her fans, a record label exec (very articulate in respecting her awe inspiring talent) and her father (charming in his own way).  One suggestion: Turn the subtitles on during the documentary to catch all that Amy (who speaks very fast in a heavy British accent--one of the reasons people always think she's drunk) has to say.  She is funny, charming, smart, self-effacing, and--that rarest of qualities in someone in posession of such brilliance and success--REAL!  I, for one, can't imagine the world without her!BTW--Anyone knowing what the ""Back to Black And White Extra Option"" is on the dvd--please share it here.  Did I miss something?  God, I hope so!!!UPDATE: To anyone out there wondering abut the blu-ray disc of this concert that has a bonus concert from another date, I've seen it.  I bought a region free blu-ray disc from an individual on a popular auction site, and was disappointed to see Amy in a sad state throughout the video, but most especially toward the end.  I had to stop it--it just really hurt to see her looking so vulnerable and seemingly dazed.  She was still great--even in this state, but sadly, she's just not at her best.  Even so, I did enjoy watching some of it, but Amy just seems checked out to some extent, and seems to be finding it difficult to stay focused and soldier on.  With the hindsight of July, it's especially poignant watching it.I kept hoping and praying Amy would stay on course and survive her demons, but nothing can bring her back now, and I'd prefer to remember her as she'd probably like to be remembered--when she was on her game.  So, I watched the original concert instead, and it was nice to have a new and improved copy of that monumental concert.  The picture is wonderfully clear, and she seems even more as if she's in the flesh and blood on a stage in front of you when you watch her here.  In my estimation, it's really worth tracking down a copy of this just so you have the London performance in this much improved blu-ray presentation.  I'm so grateful that we have this amazing account of who Amy was as an artist--truly original, amazingly soulful, and altogether brilliant.  My, but I can't help but think what else we would have seen and heard from her.

If ever a video cried out for subtitles, its this one. The documentary has them, but the concert does not. And, yes, as ""Back to Black"" proved, Winehouse is a British blue-eyed soul talent in the mold of - if not necessarily the level of - a Dusty Springfield. She has talent and promise. But, she is pathetically out of control in the concert, drunk and drunker throughout the evening, and possibly, stoned as well. I don't want to seem holier-than-thou, but when I see teens singing ""No, No, No"" to rehab to a person clearly in need of just that - when I see that it was actually her enabling cab driver Dad who inspired that refrain, when I see the music industry types, featured in the doc, who apparently only care about wnat the singer can do for the label.... well, it's off-putting to say the least.  So, talent aside, it's just too painful to watch someone self-destruct before one's eyes. If this concert existed in a vacuum, I'd give it 5 stars. But it doesn't. So, a somewhat generous 3 stars for a disquieting disc that will remain in my seldom played collection.
