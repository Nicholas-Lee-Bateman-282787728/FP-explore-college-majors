I have to say any horror movie that takes place in an Old West ghost town is good in my book. Plus it's an early 80's slasher. I can't hate 80's slashers. Anyway before I gush too much I want to get to the best feature on this disc. The audio commentary. The director explains what happens and who is doing the killing in this sometimes confusing movie. I used to get what happened in this movie when I was a teen renting this movie over and over from the video store. But I hadn't seen this movie over 15 years and I just watched it again recently and I was a little confused over who the killer was. The director explained who it was and why they were doing the killing. It may be a little far-fetched but it made me appreciate the movie even more. The story is about a group of vacationing water rafters who happen to take a little excursion to a deserted ghost town in Texas. They decide to stay overnight (big mistake because it is a spooky old ghost town). Soon they are being killed off one by one from some mysterious killer. Bad or good, you decide. For me I am going to stay away from any deserted Old West town at night.",5,Is it really that bad?,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,1270,"[""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'movie', 'are', 'fans', 'movie', 'including', 'who', 'flaws', 'have', 'say', 'horror', 'movie', 'place', 'Old', 'West', 'ghost', 'town', 'good', 'book', 'early', '80', 'slasher', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', '80', 'slashers', 'Anyway', 'gush', 'too', 'much', 'want', 'get', 'best', 'feature', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'what', 'who', 'doing', 'killing', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'movie', 'used', 'get', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'teen', 'renting', 'movie', 'video', 'store', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'director', 'explained', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'were', 'doing', 'killing', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'made', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'group', 'vacationing', 'water', 'rafters', 'who', 'happen', 'take', 'little', 'excursion', 'deserted', 'ghost', 'town', 'Texas', 'decide', 'stay', 'overnight', 'big', 'mistake', 'spooky', 'old', 'ghost', 'town', 'Soon', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'Bad', 'good', 'decide', 'am', 'going', 'stay', 'away', 'deserted', 'Old', 'West', 'town', 'night']",Scream
