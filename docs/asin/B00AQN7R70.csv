Even though it is subtitled in English, it is entertaining and full of twists, turns, and surprises!We would recommend this series for anyone who finds mystery and solving the crime of murder socially redeeming.Our only disatisfation is that there are no more available...",5,Beck Murder Mysteries,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,377,"['have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Swedish', 'police', 'investigating', 'murders', 'Stockholm', 'Even', 'subtitled', 'English', 'entertaining', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'would', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'mystery', 'solving', 'crime', 'murder', 'socially', 'only', 'disatisfation', 'are', 'more', 'available']",Beck: Episodes 16-18

We are shown a different setting--Sweden.  The characters are all realistic and believable as they are well-written and perfectly-acted by the outstanding cast.  We get to know hard-working Inspector Beck, his volatile deputy, the long-suffering boss, the female police officers who have to prove themselves, Beck's crisis-prone daughter, and his weird but affable neighbor.  The viewer truly cares about what happens next to these characters because the series is well thought-out.  I recommend &#34;Beck&#34; to mystery fans.",5,Excellent Swedish mystery,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,632,"['Swedish', '34', 'Beck', '34', 'police', 'mysteries', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'plots', 'are', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'are', 'shown', 'different', 'setting', 'Sweden', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'believable', 'are', 'well-written', 'perfectly-acted', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'get', 'know', 'hard-working', 'Inspector', 'Beck', 'volatile', 'deputy', 'long-suffering', 'boss', 'female', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'have', 'prove', 'Beck', 'crisis-prone', 'daughter', 'weird', 'affable', 'neighbor', 'viewer', 'truly', 'what', 'next', 'characters', 'series', 'well', 'thought-out', 'recommend', '34', 'Beck', '34', 'mystery', 'fans']",Beck: Episodes 16-18

You may also want to consider Dalziel & Pascoe, the BBC's excellent police procedure.  Warren Clarke, the detective superintendent, plays his character as the kind of guy you either accept and laugh at or despise.  Coarse, rude, arrogant, self serving, unsympathetic, he's completely the opposite of Colin Buchanan, his sidekick.  Taciturn and almost morose, seething with resentment towards his boss, you want him to bust out of that famous English reserve straitjacket and bring his boss down a few notches.",5,Always enjoyable,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,642,"['See', 'review', 'Beck', '13-15', 'Beck', 'Wallander', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'contribution', 'DVD', 'library', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'consider', 'Dalziel', 'Pascoe', 'BBC', 'excellent', 'police', 'procedure', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'detective', 'superintendent', 'character', 'kind', 'guy', 'accept', 'laugh', 'despise', 'Coarse', 'rude', 'arrogant', 'self', 'serving', 'unsympathetic', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Colin', 'Buchanan', 'sidekick', 'Taciturn', 'almost', 'morose', 'seething', 'resentment', 'towards', 'boss', 'want', 'bust', 'famous', 'English', 'reserve', 'straitjacket', 'bring', 'boss', 'down', 'few', 'notches']",Beck: Episodes 16-18
