A few highlights of this season are the whole group singing to John, cameos by Boz Scaggs and Mariah Carey, and Ling as a judge is just a laugh riot! The writing is muddled as you can tell they werent sure where to go when Robert Downey Jr. fell off the wagon in season 4.

1275318,AMJD1O36COKZU,B002KQ6UE2,Bruce J Carper,"[2, 2]","I bought seasons 1-3 recently because I LOVE this show. Never saw seasons 4 and 5, so I got them from the library. Glad I did (and this review is NO reflection on Amazon or its PERFECT service for me to date) Season 4 was fantastic. Season five started off okay, but sank quickly. Like the last seasons of Smallville and Charmed, it was like the writers were all killed in a tragic train crash...and the custodians were called in to quick-finish the series. What's with the purple-haired dike and the watered down dialogues of Rikki and the cleverly-inserted daughter? I started fast-forwarding through the purple-hair scenes and finally quit 4 shows before Season 5 ended. Too much damage for a recovery. Even the music was overall ineffectively interjected and not as effective as prior seasons (except Todd Rundgren's ""We Gotta Get You a Woman""). It was a sad finish...but that's just my take. Anyone else have any coherent thoughts?
