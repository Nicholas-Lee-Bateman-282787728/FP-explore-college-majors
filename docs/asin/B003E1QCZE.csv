1337625,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B003E1QCZE,Anthony Pittore,"[4, 7]","Five years ago, Robert Englund starred in one of the most entertaining of the modern remakes, '2001 Maniacs.' That film did what I believe most remakes should do: It took a somewhat forgotten film, Herschell Gordon Lewis's 'Two Thousand Maniacs!,' and did something a bit different with it. It was a change from other remakes like that take already great & well known films and ruin them.Now in 2010, the Maniacs of Pleasant Valley, Georgia, return for '2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams.' In this installment, the undead Southerners head out on the road and meet up with a spoof version of the brainless duo Paris Hilton & Nicole Ritchie's show 'The Simple Life.' The crew of the show is lured into the town's centennial celebration where they, like many other Yanks before them, become the revenge sacrifices of the town's evil leaders.Before the release of 'Field of Screams,' many wondered why Robert Englund decided to drop out for this sequel. However, after viewing the film, the only wonder I had was why horror legend Bill Moseley decided to replace him in the film. The first film, while it was far from perfect, had a certain charm about it that made some of the flaws of the film easy to look past. However, 'Field of Screams' loses that charm, making the absolutely unbearable writing and acting just about impossible to watch. There is plenty of great gore, crazy kills, and over-the-top humour to make the film watchable, and that will please plenty of horror fans. However, the script and actors, even for a film like this, are just too awful to look past.Final Verdict: 4/10, boosted a bit due to Bill Moseley & Lin Shaye.-AP3-",2,"Not even the blood, boobs, and violence can save this one (unbiased review)",1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1641,"['Five', 'years', 'ago', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'starred', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'modern', 'remakes', 'Maniacs', 'film', 'did', 'what', 'believe', 'most', 'remakes', 'should', 'do', 'took', 'somewhat', 'forgotten', 'film', 'Herschell', 'Gordon', 'Lewis', ""'Two"", 'Thousand', 'Maniacs', 'did', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'was', 'change', 'other', 'remakes', 'take', 'already', 'great', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'ruin', 'them.Now', '2010', 'Maniacs', 'Pleasant', 'Valley', 'Georgia', 'return', ""'2001"", 'Maniacs', 'Field', 'Screams', 'installment', 'undead', 'Southerners', 'head', 'out', 'road', 'meet', 'up', 'spoof', 'version', 'brainless', 'duo', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Nicole', 'Ritchie', 'show', ""'The"", 'Simple', 'Life', 'crew', 'show', 'lured', 'town', 'centennial', 'celebration', 'where', 'many', 'other', 'Yanks', 'become', 'revenge', 'sacrifices', 'town', 'evil', 'leaders.Before', 'release', ""'Field"", 'Screams', 'many', 'wondered', 'why', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'decided', 'drop', 'out', 'sequel', 'However', 'viewing', 'film', 'only', 'wonder', 'had', 'was', 'why', 'horror', 'legend', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'decided', 'replace', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'had', 'certain', 'charm', 'made', 'flaws', 'film', 'easy', 'look', 'past', 'However', ""'Field"", 'Screams', 'loses', 'charm', 'making', 'absolutely', 'unbearable', 'writing', 'acting', 'just', 'about', 'impossible', 'watch', 'plenty', 'great', 'gore', 'crazy', 'kills', 'over-the-top', 'humour', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'will', 'please', 'plenty', 'horror', 'fans', 'However', 'script', 'actors', 'even', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'awful', 'look', 'past.Final', 'Verdict', '4/10', 'boosted', 'bit', 'due', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Lin', 'Shaye.-AP3-']",N/A

While it may not have been the breakthrough hit it could have been, 2001 MANIACS has grown a steady cult following in select Horror crowds. Fans of the original will be sorely disappointed with this poor follow-up, however, as the script lacks what little substance the first film may have had in place of an absurd amount of nudity and even cheaper gags. FIELD OF SCREAMS brings back many familiar characters, although several of the leading actors have been replaced (including the role of Mayor Buckman, with Bill Moseley standing in for Robert Englund). These returning characters are only shells of their former selves, written and acted from the gutter with very little humor left to be found in any of the performances.

My review is nothing, but honest.2001 MANIACS: FIELD OF SCREAMS** Out of 5Tagline- Guess Who's Coming for Dinner?Release Date- July 20th, 2010Running Time- 86-MinutesRating- NRScreenplay- Chris Kobin, Tim Sullivan & Christopher TuffinDirector- Tim SullivanStarring- Bill Moseley, Lin Shaye, Christa Campbell, Nivek Ogre, Ryan Fleming, Katie Marie Johnson, Asa Hope, Ahmed BestReleased on the festival scene in 2005 and DTV in 2006 Tim Sullivan's feature film debut 2001 Maniacs was a remake of the HG Lewis shocker 2000 Maniacs and while 2001 Maniacs may not go down as one of the all time greats it was a highly entertaining film that might offend some, but it's all done and good fun and I quite enjoyed the movie.Now in 2010 the South Will Rise Again in Tim Sullivan's follow up 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams. The budget for the movie is a lot lower than the first and this does in some ways hurt the movie and I feared the movie would have that camcorder look and it doesn't quite have that look, but it is very cheap looking and while at times it does hurt the biggest problem was the audio. At times the audio is ok, but other times it sounds as if it was recorded on a tape recorder and played back. Tim Sullivan stated that he could have waited in hopes of getting more money or he could make the best movie he could and what we end up getting is a very mixed bag.2001 Maniacs is what Tim Sullivan called ""splat-stick"" which is a mixture of a splatter flick and slapstick comedy and these elements worked very well and made for a nice modern exploitation flick that like I said could be highly offensive, but it's all done in such a way that I doubt anyone could get really offended by it. Field of Screams stays true to that, but what worked so well in the first at times comes across as poor filmmaking.The screenplay was written by Chris Kobin, Tim Sullivan & Christopher Tuffin and unlike the first part the script here is a little bit of a mess at times and it seems as if the writers tried too hard and unlike the first part everything here at times seems forced; the characters are rather annoying aside from the Maniacs, but with that said there were some good ideas that spoof the culture we live in where anybody can somehow become famous even if devoid of any talent.The characters are a spoof of Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie as well as Kevin Federline. The Paris Hilton character is named Rome Sheraton (Katie Marie Johnson), which I personally found rather hysterical and at one point Paris and Nicole had a reality show called The Simple Life and the two characters here have a reality show called Road Rascals. This idea was actually quite good and it does lead to some entertaining moments, but outside of that as a whole it just seems a bit forced; it's like ok how do we one up the first film? And that is what really hurts the script since in the first it felt natural, but here like I said forced.As director Tim Sullivan delivers a very uneven film; some of the flaws like I said were due to the budget. The first film didn't exactly have a huge budget, but the movie looked good with strong production values, but here Sullivan's budget was far lower and it makes the movie look to fake; the pacing of the film was a bit slow despite the movie only running at 85-minutes. 2001 Maniacs was the feature film debut for Tim Sullivan and I really liked his style and he showed some great promise so what went wrong here?Again I think the lack of budget did play a part, but it almost seems like a different director. The splat-stick style that worked so well in the original doesn't work nearly as well and at times it borders on poor filmmaking. There are moments where Sullivan shows what made 2001 Maniacs a well made and entertaining film, but in Field of Screams he's unable to sustain that and for the most part it just comes off as poor. I still think Sullivan has the potential to be a solid horror filmmaker and at times he does show that in Field of Screams, but again overall the film just comes out poor for the most part and some of this was clearly the low budget, but some of the blame is on Tim Sullivan, but I'm still interested in seeing what he can do in the future and hopefully it's better than this and more along the lines of 2001 Maniacs.I think the problem is that Sullivan's style, which is a throwback to the splatter flicks of exploitation cinema is a style that can be hit or miss from film to film and while this splat-stick style worked well in 2001 Maniacs it doesn't work as well with Field of Screams and like I said this style can be hit or miss from film to film and sadly here it's a miss for the most part. The gore level here is alright; there was enough gore to please gore-hounds, it could have used some more.The biggest change here is Robert Englund doesn't return as Mayor Buckman and Bill Moseley steps into the role. Like most horror fans I'm a fan of Robert Englund and I'd go as far to say that his performance in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the best in the horror genre up there with Karloff as the Monster, Lugosi as Dracula and Chaney, Jr as the Wolf-Man. But I also really love Bill Moseley and the guy is seriously under-rated. His take on Mayor Buckman isn't all that different than Robert Englund's, but Moseley doesn't have the material that Englund had. So far Moseley's performance has drawn mixed reviews, but I quite liked him in the role. This isn't Otis from Rejects or Chop-Top from Chainsaw 2, but Moseley again delivers a fin performance.Lin Shaye returns as Granny and once again is solid, but as I stated earlier the material isn't as strong, but Shaye provides another winning performance and along with Moseley helps keep Field of Screams from totally sinking. The rest of the cast was ok; the Maniacs were the strongest of the movie, but the rest the performances were a bit weak, but hey it's a horror flick and the actors are earlier in their careers so I can easily overlook it.Overall 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams is far inferior to the first film and one has to wonder what went wrong here? The film is what it is and there are some fairly decent moments, but overall Field of Screams is rather poor, but I still think Tim Sullivan can end up being a decent horror filmmaker despite the

1337634,ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B003E1QCZE,Fred Adelman,"[0, 0]","2001 MANIACS: FIELD OF SCREAMS (2010) - This film was shot in 12 days for $400,000, but it has the look and feel as if it was filmed in one night on a drunken dare for $1.99. This sequel to director Tim Sullivan's 2001 MANIACS (2004), which was also directed and co-written by Sullivan, doesn't have one redeeming quality or an ounce of originality. Even Robert Englund refused to return as deadly Mayor George W. Buckman; this time replaced by Bill Moseley, who is beginning to appear on a lot of bad films lately. The story is simple: When the Southern sheriff of Pleasant Valley refuses to cooperate with Buckman and his Confederate Civil War era cannibalistic group (Which includes an Asian woman and a black man. What the?), taking down the detour sign (spelled &#34;Detore&#34;, which I guess is supposed to be funny because Southerners can't spell) to lure Northerners to their deaths, Buckman has the sheriff killed (the old nails in the rolling barrel gag, which was missing from the first remake) and decides if the North won't come to Pleasant Valley, they will come to the North. They all hop on a bus and end up in Iowa (Is that even the North?) where a reality show called &#34;Road Rascals&#34;, about two spoiled and dumb Paris Hilton/Nicole Ritchie-wannabe sisters, is traveling in an RV, when it hits the &#34;Detore&#34; sign, giving them two flat tires. Only having one spare tire and no cell phone service (No cell phone service in Iowa? C'mon now!), this aggravating group, which includes the two snotty rich girls (one of them walks around holding the taxidermied remains of her small dog), their boyfriends (one of them is a closeted gay man), a lesbian European producer, a Jewish director, an Hispanic driver and his black girlfriend (How's that for diversity?), are met by Mayor Buckman, Granny Boone (Lin Shaye, one of the few returning cast members from the first film) and their clan. They hold their annual &#34;Guts 'N' Glory Jamboree&#34;, where they slowly (and I mean slowly) beging murdering and eating the cast and crew of the reality show. One girl is strapped to a table and has a buzzsaw rip her in half from her nether regions to her head. The lesbian producer has her face ripped off by a contraption in the Milk Maiden's (Christa Campbell, another returning cast member) chastity belt. The black girl is hanged by the old throwing tomatoes (instead of baseballs) at a bullseye gag, which releases a trap door under her feet (Hey, hasn't this been done before, but more effectively in director H.G. Lewis' original TWO THOUSAND MANIACS - 1964?). The Hispanic guy is impaled on a pitchfork, only to survive (he acts like it is only a minor flesh wound) and end up decapitated when Buckman slams the bus' hood on his head. Another guy is electrocuted until his eyes explode out of his skull. And so one and so one. Truth be told, there is not one original death in the film that we haven't seen done better a hundred times before, but we have to put up with some of the worst cases of humor (a lot of it setting Civil Rights back 200 years) ever committed to film, including a cringeworthy bit where Granny Boone leads her cannibal ladies in a song and dance routine based on the film FLASHDANCE (1983), substituting the song &#34;Maniac&#34; with one called &#34;Cannibals&#34;, which leads to the question: How would cannibalistic Civil War Southerners, who rise only one day a year, know anything about FLASHDANCE? Everything about this film is below par, from the photography, editing, music, performances (Bill Moseley is horrible [he sings a song of his own composition over the end credits] and Lin Shaye looks embarrassed, which she should be. The rest of the cast, including returning actor Ryan Fleming as the gay Hucklebilly, who likes to #*%! his stuffed sheep, are annoying as heck and there is not one victim that has any redeeming quality, so we don't care if they live or die.) and especially the sound. The dialogue sounds like it was entirely looped later in a studio, as it really doesn't match the acoustics of the settings. The finale, where a pregnant Granny Boone delivers a black baby (Clearly, they used a young black boy about two years-old for the baby!), is about as funny as watching people jump to their deaths from a burning building. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this, but if your must watch it for masochistic reasons, stay away from the R-Rated version and rent the Unrated Version, as it doesn't cut away from the gory deaths, adds an entire cannibal dinner scene not seen in the R-Rated version, extends other scenes and offers more copious nudity (the only reason I stayed watching till the end), adding over three minutes to the running time. Unlike director Tim Sullivan's (DRIFTWOOD - 2006) first remake, Eli Roth and Scott Spiegel are not listed as one of the 14 producers here, although the late David F. Friedman (who passed away in 2011) and the still-living Hershell Gordon Lewis are listed as Executive Producers. I bet they were both wincing in pain when they saw how badly this film turned out. At least the first remake had a professional sheen to it. This sequel offers none of that. Also starring Nivek Ogre, Morgan Phan, Andrea Leon, Ahmed Best, Asa Hope, Katy Marie Johnson, Alex Luria, Larayia Gaston, Trevor Wright, Miles Dougal, Alana Curry, Jordan Yale Levine and Earl Roesel.

This film has met both criteria on my rare scale. It's really not hard to tell where this film went wrong-everywhere. It's been years since the first film in this series came out and I have to say-that was a humdinger. Inventive kills, over the top humor, just enough offensiveness to be a rocking good time. When I heard that a sequal was in the works I was as happy as a gorehound could be. YOU CRUSHED MY HAPPINESS. While I understand that this was filmed on a limited budget, does it have to so thouroughly look like it? Second of all-what's with the sound? The entire movie seems to be overdubbed(WAY overdubbed) after the fact. I understand a little sweetening here and there but all major dialogue? It's especially jarring when the ""Greek chorus"" (who for some strange reason is not overdubbed) can barely be heard and Granny Boone or the Mayor yells at them to shut up. The offensive, un-pc humor of the first was on a more subtle did-they-really-just-do/say-that vein. No luck here. The maniacs (actually, nearly all the characters) seem to exist merely to spout the most racist put down they can think of. The subtle yet in your face humor of the first is also destroyed completely in this film. It's so heavy handed that I'm sure it was just an afterthought that a pie fight wasn't included. Honestly-what was with Lester toting around a stuffed animal sheep? Did anyone think that was funny? The less said about the acting the better(I'm looking at you Li...no wait-I'm looking at all of you). The gore was good enough but nothing special. That's really all the time I can give this mess.

The writing is cheap. Heck, the writing is below cheap. To say it's sophomoric is an insult to sophomoric writers everywhere. The directing is cheap, dreadful and uncreative. The acting is... It was so bad there's no point in even describing it. On the whole, it was like Tim Sullivan and his friends had an extra $58.60 around and decided to make a film. They gathered a lot of ninth-rate fetish show performers and wanna-be actors who were turned down for roles in YouTube fan films, and they were able to blackmail Bill Moseley with something to get him on-board. They collected set pieces from the trash dump after the circus left town, and then they wrote a script on the back of a Waffle House receipt.

This one left me speechless it was so bad. There isn't any comparison between the two. The first one is good, this one is not. I do not blame First Look Pictures, and I like some of their films. It is the script. Wow, it was so so bad. Alot of the original actors returned for this sequel, except Robert Englund (SMART MOVE ROBERT. YOU SAW THE SCRIPT AND RAN.lol), but the script was so bad, it made their acting terrible. It is so bad, you really don't want to watch it, making it boring, and you really don't care what happens. I was just wishing it would finish. I have no problems if they come out with a third one, but make it more like the original. Another thing is, alot of the returning character's personalities have changed. The whole film dosen't feel right at all. It dosen't look like they used a big budget for this film either. Low budget would be fine tho, if it were a good movie. This movie is 100 times worse than Cabin Fever 2. I wish people would stop releasing bad sequels to movies. It so unfair for them to make a quick buck thaty way and trick people. This movie isn't even worth $4.00, and I paid $8.70 shipped. I truly feel sorrier tho for the people at Wal-mart and Best Buy that paid $19.99 for this DVD when it first came out. They have to still be fuming.",1,I HATE IT!

Be specific, people!  Let's see if we can dissect this POS (oops, gave that one away, didn't I?) a little bit.  What!-a politically correct horror movie?  Believe it.  Sure there are some superficial racial slurs to add some verisimilitude, but the sheen is not unlike the united nations of rascals that made the Pirates of the Caribbean movies so sickening to watch.  If you're going to do a movie about angry, bitter southern cannibals who have no inhibitions about offending anyone, then do it right!  I mean, come on, these are supposedly Civil War era southerners and the N-word isn't used once?  To top it off, it isn't even a particularly violent movie!  The gore is before and after implied.  You don't actually see anyone get buzz-sawed, or anyone's face get ripped off.  Whoa, one of the victims is pitchforked.  To use the southern parlance this film crew should be familiar with, it's the coward's way out.  There were some potential spots for  interesting gags, like the idea of two completely moronic blondes outwitting a whole community of bloodthirsty cannibals by mistake.  Too bad the well-thought out ending ruins that.  The lead actors, however, are actually almost good.  Bill Mosley adequately fills Englund's shoes from the first film (the remake, that is).  Why hasn't anyone commented about how his eye patch changed eyes??  Lin Shaye is also good, though a bit over the top in this one.  Her best moment was in that bizarre video clip.  Everything in this is over the top.  The remake proved itself to be an interesting balance between yucks and an underlying menace, not to mention an interesting dig at southern manners.  This film just tries to pile on the yucks.  The victims are easy and obviously in need of their respective comeuppances:  Paris Hilton clones, overachieving British producers, non-colored blacks, gays, erudite Hispanics and stuffed animals.  In other words, the kinds of people who wouldn't be missed by anyone, safe targets.
