This birth of Christ fable was reenacted each December until 1954, and then revived for the 1964 and '65 holiday seasons. Since the early '50s, the ""Hall of Fame"" has brought superior entertainment to television (236 broadcasts, as of 5/09). ""Hallmarks"" of this nearly 60 year series are fine casts and production values.AN AMERICAN STORY is no exception. (Original airdate: 11/29/92)Set in Texas but based on incidents that occurred in Athens, TN in August of 1946, ""American Story"" concerns a half-dozen WWII vets who return to a town practically ruined by a corrupt and extortionate mayor and fascist sheriff. They organize a political party to force these men out of office, never realizing to what extent their opponents will go to retain power. The ex-soldiers soon find themselves literally fighting a different kind of war.""American Story"" is available in limited quantities onDVD.A related ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" item--DECORATION DAY (1990) is a contemporary drama that features James Garner as a retired Southern judge/WWII hero trying to reconcile with a boyhood friend (Bill Cobbs) who refuses to accept his long-delayed Medal of Honor.

The Hallmark price is $19.98 but it appears to be temporarily out of stock at the moment. The movie is based on an event that took place in Athens, Tennessee in 1946. The DVD version is powerful and tells a very important story about personal responsibility. Veterans returning from WW II discovered they had one more battle to fight; this time against corruption at home. If you want to check the story out put Battle of Athens, 1946 in your search engine and you will discover many references to the battle including some clips from the movie on YouTube.I first became aware of the movie and the story by way of an email that was forwarded to me. It had a YouTube clip which I watched and was touched. With a little research I discovered the movie was still available directly from Hallmark and ordered it on line. We watched it last night and were both deeply moved by the movie and its message. In retrospect I'm still amazed that I had not heard anything about this event as a boy in Houston, Texas. I would have thought something that significant would have become a part of the history books on this country.There are a number of interesting special features which tell about the making of the movie and the cast.

We, as a people, forget the past and need to be reminded of  what can happen when power can take over, even in a small town, and take away your Constitutional rights.  This is happening right now in our country.  The current confiscation of guns is a way of disabling the population of a way to fight back.  The Second Amendment is not about hunting, it is about being able to defend ourselves from our own government.  This story really happened and we must continually be reminded of what happened when governments took away the guns and people left defenseless.  Remember Germany?  This is what happened and will happen again if you don't heed our history.  It is not guns that kill, it is people and if you remove guns, they will go to other means.  England is a perfect example!

I had no idea. But it clearly demonstrates why the right to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by our Second Amendment,  cannot be limited to just personal protection. It is also there as a way for us to act against homegrown tyranny.Others here have no doubt already described the plot in detail, so I'll just share a brief summary. Although the movie is set in Texas, the actual events occurred in Athens, Tennessee. It seems the mayor and his thug crew had a tight grip on the town, and were routinely extorting money from the citizens. Some WWII vets returning home saw the situation and decided to run their own reform candidate in the next mayoral election. On election day, running true to form, the tyrant mayor literally steals the ballot boxes from the voting site and whisks them off to be stuffed with fake votes to secure his power for yet another term of office.Well it seems that doing this so brazenly, so brutally, right in broad daylight, was too much to bear. The town got organized, got their guns, and laid siege to the Sherriff's building where the vote stuffing was going on. Many shots were fired. Amazingly, no one was hurt. Ultimately, the mayor made his way out the back door and skipped town, and the townspeople got back their ballot box, their freedom, and their dignity.
