906222,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B0009IW8A8,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.This is series three as the series progresses they take more chances and opportunity to parody just about everyone. There are six episodes that are over before you know it. The episodes are too large for one DVD so they filled the second one with the standard extras. Unfortunately the extras add nothing to the series. I am afraid that we will have to wait some time for the next series.------------Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.I will not go though this series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.The series two includes the introduction of an English officer that thinks he can speak French and comes out with statements like ""she has great Fartitude""This is the series where they also nick Helga's knickers with the little swastikas.One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.I was surprised to see Lt. Hubert Gruber (Guy Siner.) in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003.)'Allo, 'Allo!

906226,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B0009IW8A8,Mr John Haueisen,"[7, 7]","This is more of the most brilliantly-written comedy series ever. From the very first episode to the last, all the characters are consistent and hilarious. The plots are clever and each builds on previous episodes. Not a single word is wasted; each is carefully chosen to add something to the story.It is set in France during WWII. The main character is Rene, played by Gorden Kaye, who owns a cafe, and occupies his days trying to balance getting along with the Germans, the French Resistence, the Communist Resistence, his wife, who thinks she can sing, his mother-in-law, British airmen, various onion-sellers, the Gestapo, and the two lovely waitresses with whom he is having affairs. As the episodes progress, you meet additional characters, who are always consistently hilarious.As you may have read from other reviews, the ""extras"" here do not really add much, except additional glimpses of several of the Allo Allo actors on British TV game shows. They are worth watching once, but you will prefer watching the hilarious episodes of Allo Allo.In some ways it's like the British series, ""Are You Being Served."" If you have ever enjoyed a single episode, you'll want to see all of them.
