Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[2, 8]","I couldn't help noticing the reviewer ""Meqabeilin"" and the rendered analogy of Gulda coming off as a sort of ""spastic Joe Cocker at Woodstock"" which, alas, I not only must concur forthwith but it seemed to me to be more of an amalgam consisting of Harpo Marx with the horn, 'Curly' Howard and the 'machine-gun derby' routine [You know, bop, bop, bop, bop, left hand derby 'bop' to the head and concurrent criss-cross right arm thing] all followed by the vocalized TAH, TAH, TAH, TAH mutterings of a Glenn Gould on a particularly bad 'chair' day as it were. What's that? Louder! Oh, I agree! Clarabell and the seltzer bottle too! Double whew!The attempt at 'conducting' [!?] while playing was a complete and total farce! I mean the guy is literally trotting back and forth to the piano bench at times to hit the correct notes after his rotating arm swings [think Apollo Creed in the Rocky flick when the Rock was against the ropes and Apollo, wearing the Uncle Sam hat, made with the old full arm rotation thing for the 'here it comes' knock-out punch !] to the orchestra and then when the clinkers show up after Gulda's rush back to the piano, he simply smiles! So too, I do think the 'classical' recitals mandate some semblance of a classical recital demeanor so when the pianist shows up looking more like the piano 'mover' versus the 'interpreter', well, hey, and to those who would immediately counter, 'but what about the playing!', I can't say it was pleasing.Between the antics, the mutterings, the 'conducting' [!?], the running around the stage, the sometimes 'been on the pipe' look and those clinkers a la mode in a constant struggle between key positioning and arm swinging, nah. And again nahhhh! I honestly think the orchestra was 'embarrassed' by the performance and, quite frankly, I don't think Gulda could have cared less! Note too when the 3rd movement of the 5th piano concerto was concluded came the rather sparse applause and Gulda makes with the sort of palm of the hand wave-off as if to say, hey, take it or leave it!What's that? That's me! The one who did 'not' embrace 4'33"" or the ""prepared piano"" thing with the spoons, bolts, marbles, et al , on the piano 'strings' as the veritable 'wave of the future' or 'imagined voice [!?] of the Muse itself"" or, as another wag put it, the 'Second Coming', so call me a traditionalist but as duly distinct from an 'ultra purist'! There 'is' a difference! Switching: It also helps to know something about Friedrich Gulda [1930-2000] and his background where along the way on the initially more traditional path he simply said 'the hell with it' [sic] and, IMO, acted accordingly! In effect, a demeanor of 'take it or leave it' with a follow up on-stage caveat of 'like it or lump it', stage antics inclusive. OK, fine, to each their own thing ... so I 'lumped' it!Doc Tony",2,"A recital ...or another analogous 4'33"" thing ""event""  ?!",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2840,"['could', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'reviewer', 'Meqabeilin', 'rendered', 'analogy', 'Gulda', 'coming', 'off', 'sort', 'spastic', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'Woodstock', 'alas', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'concur', 'forthwith', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'amalgam', 'consisting', 'Harpo', 'Marx', 'horn', ""'Curly"", 'Howard', ""'machine-gun"", 'derby', 'routine', '[', 'know', 'bop', 'bop', 'bop', 'bop', 'left', 'hand', 'derby', ""'bop"", 'head', 'concurrent', 'criss-cross', 'right', 'arm', 'thing', ']', 'followed', 'vocalized', 'TAH', 'TAH', 'TAH', 'TAH', 'mutterings', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'particularly', 'bad', ""'chair"", 'day', 'were', 'What', 'Louder', 'Oh', 'agree', 'Clarabell', 'seltzer', 'bottle', 'too', 'Double', 'whew', 'attempt', ""'conducting"", '[', ']', 'playing', 'was', 'complete', 'total', 'farce', 'mean', 'guy', 'literally', 'trotting', 'back', 'forth', 'piano', 'bench', 'times', 'hit', 'correct', 'notes', 'rotating', 'arm', 'swings', '[', 'think', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'Rocky', 'flick', 'when', 'Rock', 'was', 'ropes', 'Apollo', 'wearing', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'hat', 'made', 'old', 'full', 'arm', 'rotation', 'thing', ""'here"", 'knock-out', 'punch', ']', 'orchestra', 'then', 'when', 'clinkers', 'show', 'up', 'Gulda', 'rush', 'back', 'piano', 'simply', 'So', 'too', 'do', 'think', ""'classical"", 'recitals', 'mandate', 'semblance', 'classical', 'recital', 'demeanor', 'so', 'when', 'pianist', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'piano', ""'interpreter"", 'well', 'hey', 'who', 'would', 'immediately', 'counter', ""'but"", 'what', 'playing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'pleasing.Between', 'antics', 'mutterings', ""'conducting"", '[', ']', 'running', 'stage', 'sometimes', ""'been"", 'pipe', 'look', 'clinkers', 'la', 'mode', 'constant', 'struggle', 'key', 'positioning', 'arm', 'swinging', 'nah', 'again', 'nahhhh', 'honestly', 'think', 'orchestra', 'was', ""'embarrassed"", 'performance', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Gulda', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'Note', 'too', 'when', '3rd', 'movement', '5th', 'piano', 'concerto', 'was', 'concluded', 'came', 'rather', 'sparse', 'applause', 'Gulda', 'sort', 'palm', 'hand', 'wave-off', 'say', 'hey', 'take', 'leave', 'What', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""'not"", 'embrace', ""4'33"", 'prepared', 'piano', 'thing', 'spoons', 'bolts', 'marbles', 'et', 'al', 'piano', ""'strings"", 'veritable', ""'wave"", 'future', ""'imagined"", 'voice', '[', ']', 'Muse', 'wag', 'put', ""'Second"", 'Coming', 'call', 'traditionalist', 'duly', 'distinct', ""'ultra"", 'purist', ""'is"", 'difference', 'Switching', 'also', 'know', 'something', 'Friedrich', 'Gulda', '[', '1930-2000', ']', 'background', 'where', 'way', 'initially', 'more', 'traditional', 'path', 'simply', 'said', ""'the"", 'hell', '[', 'sic', ']', 'IMO', 'acted', 'accordingly', 'effect', 'demeanor', ""'take"", 'leave', 'follow', 'up', 'on-stage', 'caveat', 'lump', 'stage', 'antics', 'inclusive', 'OK', 'fine', 'own', 'thing', 'so', ""'lumped"", 'Doc', 'Tony']",N/A
548382,A1THJ5GJF9NLCS,B00004REWB,"BLee ""bpslee""","[4, 8]","This is a LIVE recording, but the Beethoven and Mozart were recorded at different times with a lapse of 10 years or so.Moreover, when the Mozart pieces were recorded, Gulda's was far from his top form, and when the camera changed one is rather shocked seeing how old he had become-- he could hardly stand on his feet firm enough albeit his fingers were still going and his wizardry was still amazing. However, viewers would easily notice that this time round, and for obviuos reasons, it's Mozart's pathos that has got the upper hand.I find the wood winds of Munich Orchestra most appealing, particularly the clarinet, which compares favourably with the present Berlin Philharmonic. Needless to say, the strings as well as the other sections are all upfront. Here you can see that Gulda the solist/conductor competes well, had he chosen to be a conductor, with his masterclass pupil, Abbado and note their striking similarirties. And as a painist, he had even better control over the piano than his pupil, Martha Argerich and his understanding of music as well as his sense of structure and rhythm is so much stronger. Again, note the similarities between these two pianists, their touch or even their hands.The recording may not be as good as some of the best labels, but photography pianistically is very good and would be able to satisfy the most fastidious viewers. The music Gulda made is a rarity and anyway there are only a few such films available.  For those who find the Viennese School fascinating, they couldn't afford to miss it.",5,Gulda compares favourably with Argerich and Abbado,1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,1542,"['LIVE', 'recording', 'Beethoven', 'Mozart', 'were', 'recorded', 'different', 'times', 'lapse', '10', 'years', 'so.Moreover', 'when', 'Mozart', 'pieces', 'were', 'recorded', 'Gulda', 'was', 'far', 'top', 'form', 'when', 'camera', 'changed', 'one', 'rather', 'shocked', 'seeing', 'how', 'old', 'had', 'become', 'could', 'hardly', 'stand', 'feet', 'firm', 'enough', 'fingers', 'were', 'still', 'going', 'wizardry', 'was', 'still', 'amazing', 'However', 'viewers', 'would', 'easily', 'notice', 'time', 'round', 'obviuos', 'reasons', 'Mozart', 'pathos', 'got', 'upper', 'hand.I', 'find', 'wood', 'winds', 'Munich', 'Orchestra', 'most', 'appealing', 'particularly', 'clarinet', 'favourably', 'present', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Needless', 'say', 'strings', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'sections', 'are', 'upfront', 'Here', 'can', 'see', 'Gulda', 'solist/conductor', 'well', 'had', 'chosen', 'be', 'conductor', 'masterclass', 'pupil', 'Abbado', 'note', 'striking', 'similarirties', 'painist', 'had', 'even', 'better', 'control', 'piano', 'pupil', 'Martha', 'Argerich', 'understanding', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'structure', 'rhythm', 'so', 'much', 'stronger', 'Again', 'note', 'similarities', 'two', 'pianists', 'touch', 'even', 'hands.The', 'recording', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'labels', 'photography', 'pianistically', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'satisfy', 'most', 'fastidious', 'viewers', 'music', 'Gulda', 'made', 'rarity', 'anyway', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'such', 'films', 'available', 'who', 'find', 'Viennese', 'School', 'fascinating', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'miss']",N/A

548384,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B00004REWB,R. Nicholson,"[8, 9]","A very good DVDI'd been looking for a DVD of Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto  when I came across this disc that featured two independent recordings; Beethoven's Emperor Concerto in 1989 with the Munich Philharmonic, and then 3 Mozart piano sonatas in 1995.(also recorded in Munich).I must admit I was unfamiliar with the name  Friedrich Gulda (1930-2000) until this time. Initially, I was somewhat surprised by his causal attire when he arrived on stage; the concert appeared to have very  laid-back  atmosphere. However, Mr. Gulda proved to be a pianist extraordinaire, as was evident by his interpretation and skill with both the Beethoven and the Mozart. The playing is enthusiastic and passionate  throughout, and despite looking decidedly older and more frail in the 1995 recordings, I liked the Mozart sonata in D major K 576 best of all the works on this disc.The only negative is that the recording has picked up some of Mr. Gulda's humming and mutterings that occurred while he was playing. This was not particularly distracting to me but I mention it for the sake of completeness.There is only scant information on the disc case and there is no booklet with this DVD but the disc has extra material on it giving some biography info on Mr. Gulda and a brief history of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. There is also an option to have some on screen musical analysis done while you're watching this recording.All in all, a fine DVD to add to one's library of classical music.",5,Friedrich Gulda plays Beethoven and Mozart,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,1484,"['very', 'good', 'DVDI', ""'d"", 'been', 'looking', 'DVD', 'Beethoven', '5th', 'Piano', 'Concerto', 'when', 'came', 'disc', 'featured', 'two', 'independent', 'recordings', 'Beethoven', 'Emperor', 'Concerto', '1989', 'Munich', 'Philharmonic', 'then', '3', 'Mozart', 'piano', 'sonatas', '1995', 'also', 'recorded', 'Munich', '.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'name', 'Friedrich', 'Gulda', '1930-2000', 'time', 'Initially', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'causal', 'attire', 'when', 'arrived', 'stage', 'concert', 'appeared', 'have', 'very', 'laid-back', 'atmosphere', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Gulda', 'proved', 'be', 'pianist', 'extraordinaire', 'was', 'evident', 'interpretation', 'skill', 'Beethoven', 'Mozart', 'playing', 'enthusiastic', 'passionate', 'looking', 'decidedly', 'older', 'more', 'frail', '1995', 'recordings', 'liked', 'Mozart', 'sonata', 'D', 'major', 'K', '576', 'best', 'works', 'disc.The', 'only', 'negative', 'recording', 'picked', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Gulda', 'humming', 'mutterings', 'occurred', 'was', 'playing', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'distracting', 'mention', 'sake', 'completeness.There', 'only', 'scant', 'information', 'disc', 'case', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'disc', 'extra', 'material', 'giving', 'biography', 'info', 'Mr.', 'Gulda', 'brief', 'history', 'Munich', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'also', 'option', 'have', 'screen', 'musical', 'analysis', 'done', ""'re"", 'watching', 'recording.All', 'fine', 'DVD', 'add', 'one', 'library', 'classical', 'music']",N/A
