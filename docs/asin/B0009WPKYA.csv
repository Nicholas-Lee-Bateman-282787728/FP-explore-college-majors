(We didn't let her watch anything at all till she was 2 as the AAP recommends and I didn't even hear about Classical Baby until just this month.) I rented it from the library to see if she would like it, which is what I do now with everything before buying because there are a lot of popular programs she doesn't care for, such as Baby Einstein. But she really likes it so I bought it.After only seeing it a few times, as we were decorating our Christmas tree she heard ""Dance of the Reed Flutes"" from the Nutcracker ballet on my Christmas music mix, and she rushed over to the TV because that's one of the songs used in the Music video.I love classical music myself so I'm really glad for anything that will help her appreciate it too! And these videos have a very good selection of pieces, pleasant enough for even non-classical fans to be okay with. I'm even going to be buying some of the renditions used in the videos that I like better than what I have, such as ""Clair de Lune"" featuring clarinet (which I play), and ""O mio babbino caro"" as sung by Ying Huang. They only play short clips from most of the pieces, which jars me sometimes because I know they're not supposed to stop yet. But that's no biggie and the animated shorts are very cute. While she's watching it she'll give a really cute running narration of what's happening (like, ""cow singing!"").Speaking of animating to classical music, this has inspired me to play some of the lighter fun selections from Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 for her too.",4,Great way to help toddlers learn to appreciate classical music,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1603,"['showed', '2', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'first', 'time', 'past', 'weekend', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'watch', 'anything', 'till', 'was', '2', 'AAP', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'Classical', 'Baby', 'just', 'month', 'rented', 'library', 'see', 'would', 'like', 'what', 'do', 'now', 'everything', 'buying', 'are', 'lot', 'popular', 'programs', ""n't"", 'care', 'such', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'really', 'so', 'bought', 'it.After', 'only', 'seeing', 'few', 'times', 'were', 'decorating', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'heard', 'Dance', 'Reed', 'Flutes', 'Nutcracker', 'ballet', 'Christmas', 'music', 'mix', 'rushed', 'over', 'TV', 'one', 'songs', 'used', 'Music', 'video.I', 'love', 'classical', 'music', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'anything', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'too', 'videos', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'selection', 'pieces', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'even', 'non-classical', 'fans', 'be', 'okay', ""'m"", 'even', 'going', 'be', 'buying', 'renditions', 'used', 'videos', 'like', 'better', 'what', 'have', 'such', 'Clair', 'de', 'Lune', 'featuring', 'clarinet', 'play', 'O', 'mio', 'babbino', 'caro', 'sung', 'Ying', 'Huang', 'only', 'play', 'short', 'clips', 'most', 'pieces', 'sometimes', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'stop', 'yet', 'biggie', 'animated', 'shorts', 'are', 'very', 'cute', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'give', 'really', 'cute', 'running', 'narration', 'what', 'happening', 'cow', 'singing', '.Speaking', 'animating', 'classical', 'music', 'inspired', 'play', 'lighter', 'fun', 'selections', 'Fantasia', 'Fantasia', '2000', 'too']","Classical Baby 3-Pack - Music, Art & Dance"

I was surprised they did not recognize any of the pieces, totally unfamiliar. That's not the way we were raised, as we had 78s then 33 LPs by the dozens, and we kids put on albums and conducted the speakers in the living room.So, if you have a senior who can't get out much, try putting on these videos. Studies have found that dementia patients will respond to the deeper aspects of music and art even when other facilities fade away.Really these three are all classical music videos, but some feature clever dance sequences, the art one features unique inspiration from dozens of pieces of famous art.

The shows feature absolutely amazing images of music, art and dance and also show all kinds of important concepts - linking the beat of a musical piece to action, linking music to images, showing cause and effect, showing images of friendship, creativity, parental love, etc. There's really nothing in these shows that doesn't stimulate the mind or the senses in some way. I also love that the music pieces are real music by real musicians, and are not just classical pieces - the shows feature snippets of jazz songs, opera, etc.We want to expose our son to art and music from an early age, both to develop his aesthetic sense but also to encourage him to make art and music of his own. I really can't think of a better way to introduce concepts of art and music appreciation than by showing Classical Baby.

Nor did I know there was a 3 pack available.  However, I bought them anyway because my daughter LOVES music and I thought she might love these dvds.  Well, she does love them!  She sits through and watches them straight which she tends to prefer to play instead of pay attention to anything on tv.The music and colors are beautiful.  It helped me rediscover my love of classical music.  This is a wonderful buy and I have already began to recommend it to people I know and even customers with small children!  My daughter doesn't watch or own any baby einstein but these HBO movies were perfect for her and I am glad I decided to buy these over anything else.Thank you HBO!",5,Absolutely amazing!,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,803,"['came', 'dvds', 'opening', 'up', 'boxes', 'had', 'put', 'shelf', 'work', 'then', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'existed', 'did', 'know', 'was', '3', 'pack', 'available', 'However', 'bought', 'anyway', 'daughter', 'LOVES', 'music', 'thought', 'might', 'love', 'dvds', 'Well', 'love', 'watches', 'straight', 'prefer', 'play', 'instead', 'pay', 'attention', 'anything', 'tv.The', 'music', 'colors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'helped', 'rediscover', 'love', 'classical', 'music', 'wonderful', 'buy', 'have', 'already', 'began', 'recommend', 'people', 'know', 'even', 'customers', 'small', 'children', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'watch', 'own', 'baby', 'einstein', 'HBO', 'movies', 'were', 'perfect', 'am', 'glad', 'decided', 'buy', 'anything', 'else.Thank', 'HBO']","Classical Baby 3-Pack - Music, Art & Dance"

What I saw was cheesy animation depicting bad performances of gutted versions of the repertoire's master works, defiling and trivialising the names of Bach, Bart&oacute;k, and others. ""Fantasia"" was bad enough, featuring horrendous, out-of-sequence, appallingly abbreviated performances of everything from Stravinsky to Tchaikovsky, but this really takes the cake.If you twisted my arm, and if you paid me a huge wad of money, and if you threatened me with my life, I MIGHT use this as an introduction to the arts, and nothing more.Avoid this.

914927,ATA4C19SIHWVY,B0009WPKYA,Woodrough,"[4, 6]","It is hard to compare these videos to Einstein because they are totally different. I have four BE's (Galileo, Monet, Neptune and McDonald). I like that BE uses real stuff. Even the puppets are ""real"". Classical Baby is all animation, and after only 2 months of BE it was an adjustment to watch CB. That said, there are many things I like about CB. They use the actual musical pieces with full orchestras. They are short segments. If you or your baby don't like the one that is on, wait 90 seconds at the most and another one is playing. I like the ""audience"" made of animals and the animal sounds you hear while they are shown. I like the wide variety of music that is used (classical, opera, big band and others). Once I got past the different style from BE, I do like the animation. It reminds me very much of the first half of Fantasia, very light and easy to watch. I like that when you first put the DVD in there is not a bunch of ""junk"" to go through before the menu comes up, and once you push play the actual show starts (not more ads). But...I still don't know how my 14 month old daughter is going to take to them. It took her 3 weeks to get into BE and sit still to watch them. We have only had CB for a few days. So far, CB has been background TV and music during play time. If she decides she likes them, I would raise my rating to a 5, but the jury is still out (napping, really).",4,the jury is still out...,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1394,"['hard', 'compare', 'videos', 'Einstein', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'have', 'four', 'BE', 'Galileo', 'Monet', 'Neptune', 'McDonald', 'like', 'BE', 'real', 'stuff', 'Even', 'puppets', 'are', 'real', 'Classical', 'Baby', 'animation', 'only', '2', 'months', 'BE', 'was', 'adjustment', 'watch', 'CB', 'said', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'CB', 'use', 'actual', 'musical', 'pieces', 'full', 'orchestras', 'are', 'short', 'segments', 'baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'wait', '90', 'seconds', 'most', 'one', 'playing', 'like', 'audience', 'made', 'animals', 'animal', 'sounds', 'hear', 'are', 'shown', 'wide', 'variety', 'music', 'used', 'classical', 'opera', 'big', 'band', 'others', 'Once', 'got', 'different', 'style', 'BE', 'do', 'animation', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'Fantasia', 'very', 'light', 'easy', 'watch', 'like', 'when', 'first', 'put', 'DVD', 'not', 'bunch', 'junk', 'go', 'before', 'menu', 'up', 'once', 'push', 'play', 'actual', 'show', 'not', 'more', 'ads', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', '14', 'month', 'old', 'daughter', 'going', 'take', 'took', '3', 'weeks', 'get', 'BE', 'sit', 'still', 'watch', 'have', 'only', 'had', 'CB', 'few', 'days', 'So', 'far', 'CB', 'been', 'background', 'TV', 'music', 'play', 'time', 'would', 'raise', 'rating', '5', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'napping', 'really']","Classical Baby 3-Pack - Music, Art & Dance"
