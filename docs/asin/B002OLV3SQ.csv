1281128,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B002OLV3SQ,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[5, 5]","I'm not a big fan of Pilates, but love this routine. The 55 minutes routine is done completely on the floor and is more of a flowing routine with deep stretching after each segment. It is broken into several segments, although the DVD menu does not include menu items (wish it did). There is a deep psoas and hip stretch on the last segment which is absolutely wonderful. Even though the DVD is titled core strength, it is actually an all over workout.This is one in a series of four DVDs by Trudie Styler, although Jame D'Silva is the star of the show. He voice over's the routine and has the ability to take you away with his lovely voice and beautiful aura!There is an extra that shows Sting and Trudie's Tuscan estate. It is a beautiful place and they are beautiful people, but..... It made me sad, this beautiful big bass fish dead on the plate as they seasoned him up for cooking...for their life that is so wonderful. They have their own cooks and more resources that most of us. It seemed more of bragging than anything. I did not mark down on my 5-star rating of the video since the routine was so great!See many of my other review on Amazon, includes the others in this series.",5,"Excellent, unique flowing Pilates + stretching routine!",1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1187,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Pilates', 'love', 'routine', '55', 'minutes', 'routine', 'done', 'completely', 'floor', 'more', 'flowing', 'routine', 'deep', 'stretching', 'segment', 'broken', 'several', 'segments', 'DVD', 'menu', 'not', 'include', 'menu', 'items', 'wish', 'did', 'deep', 'psoas', 'hip', 'stretch', 'last', 'segment', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Even', 'DVD', 'titled', 'core', 'strength', 'actually', 'workout.This', 'one', 'series', 'four', 'DVDs', 'Trudie', 'Styler', 'Jame', ""D'Silva"", 'star', 'show', 'over', 'routine', 'ability', 'take', 'away', 'lovely', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'aura', 'extra', 'Sting', 'Trudie', 'Tuscan', 'estate', 'beautiful', 'place', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people', 'made', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'big', 'bass', 'fish', 'dead', 'plate', 'seasoned', 'up', 'cooking', 'life', 'so', 'wonderful', 'have', 'own', 'cooks', 'more', 'resources', 'most', 'seemed', 'more', 'bragging', 'anything', 'did', 'not', 'mark', 'down', '5-star', 'rating', 'video', 'routine', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'See', 'many', 'other', 'review', 'Amazon', 'others', 'series']",N/A

1281130,A175N19FS2B4J,B002OLV3SQ,Poppyx,"[42, 43]","If you're looking for a classic Pilates matwork tape, this isn't that.  What it is, though, is a superb combination of Kundalini yoga rolling back exercises, the main Pilates abdominal exercises, and a Pilates side-lying leg series with ending-yoga-stretch-combination that will kick, well, something.So, if you approach this with the idea that it's a Pilates-and-other-disciplines-class, it's beautiful.  It begins with the Pilates roll-up, repeated with stretching forward, like a dance class or a Kundalini yoga class.  It moves into side stretches, and bridge pose with many, many variations of the leg extensions.  Continuing with Pilates abdominal exercises repeated with a lot of flowing breath and circular arm additions, it moves into a long Pilates side-lying leg series, followed by yoga leg stretches.  It ends with Pilates Rolling Like a Ball, and downward dog with the legs extended into the air, Pilates Swan with the arms circling, and then a final hip stretch and standing prayer pose.Who would have trouble with this:  There are no modifications.  You need to be aware of the limitations of your back, neck, and wrists, because a fair amount of stress is put on each at points in some of the exercise.  You should also have some idea of basic yoga and Pilates form to protect your neck and back.(However, if you're strong and kinesthetically intuitive, you can probably get away with doing this right out of the box.  Just be aware that it's doing more of a number on your neck than you think it is, unless you're really careful to keep your stomach pulled in on the abdominal exercises.)As a bonus at the end, there is a song from Sting's more recent repertoire. I left the DVD to play while I was writing the review, and right now there is an incredibly beautiful early music version of ""Message in a Bottle"" playing.(For reference, I taught Pilates professionally for seven years.)Highly recommended.",4,Superb--But Only About 1/3 Pilates,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1921,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'tape', ""n't"", 'that', 'What', 'though', 'superb', 'combination', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'rolling', 'back', 'exercises', 'main', 'Pilates', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'Pilates', 'side-lying', 'leg', 'series', 'ending-yoga-stretch-combination', 'will', 'kick', 'well', 'something.So', 'approach', 'idea', 'Pilates-and-other-disciplines-class', 'beautiful', 'Pilates', 'roll-up', 'repeated', 'stretching', 'forward', 'dance', 'class', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'class', 'side', 'stretches', 'bridge', 'pose', 'many', 'many', 'variations', 'leg', 'extensions', 'Continuing', 'Pilates', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'repeated', 'lot', 'flowing', 'breath', 'circular', 'arm', 'additions', 'long', 'Pilates', 'side-lying', 'leg', 'series', 'followed', 'yoga', 'leg', 'stretches', 'Pilates', 'Rolling', 'Ball', 'downward', 'dog', 'legs', 'extended', 'air', 'Swan', 'arms', 'circling', 'then', 'final', 'hip', 'stretch', 'standing', 'prayer', 'pose.Who', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'are', 'modifications', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'limitations', 'back', 'neck', 'wrists', 'fair', 'amount', 'stress', 'put', 'points', 'exercise', 'should', 'also', 'have', 'idea', 'basic', 'yoga', 'form', 'protect', 'neck', 'back', 'However', ""'re"", 'strong', 'kinesthetically', 'intuitive', 'can', 'probably', 'get', 'away', 'doing', 'right', 'box', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'doing', 'more', 'number', 'neck', 'think', ""'re"", 'really', 'careful', 'keep', 'stomach', 'pulled', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'bonus', 'end', 'song', 'Sting', 'more', 'recent', 'repertoire', 'left', 'DVD', 'play', 'was', 'writing', 'review', 'right', 'now', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'early', 'music', 'version', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'playing', 'reference', 'taught', 'Pilates', 'professionally', 'seven', 'years', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1281132,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B002OLV3SQ,YogaGirl,"[20, 21]","I just finished doing this dvd and I absolutely loved it!  In general, I don't like pilates.  It bores me to tears.  However this dvd is a pilates blend of yoga and dance stretches that are simply wonderful. It flows like a choregraphed dance.  Every part of body is stretched out and my hips were worked in places that yoga doesn't reach. If you are a pilates expert then you may have qualms with this dvd.  But if you are like me, a yogini that loves to stretch and needs more ab work then this dvd is for you.  The music is jazz and is gorgeous and relaxing.  The class is done in voiceover and the instruction is superb.  I can't give enough platitudes to this dvd. I finished the class with a smile.  Out of the 4 that were released, this is by far the best! I wish that they would come out with a dancer's stretch dvd.  Although I was able to do all of exercises with some ease, there is always room for improvement and I will add it to my rotation.
