I have to say, outside of Lester Berry who was somewhat funny the rest was not really funny.  I certainly wasn't rolling on the floor and won't rush to watch again and again.  If you are looking for clean comedy that will have you laughing out loud and rolling on the floor a much better choice is Steve Harvey's ""Don't trip he aint through with me yet"".

Like other gospel comedies, it features comedians & comediennes featured on BET's Comic View, Def Comedy Jam, Saturday Night Live, etc.  Small Frie is the MC/host for an hour of laughs.  Joining her to keep the laughs rolling is Vyck Cooley, Lester Barrie (who is the host of The Gospel Comedy All-Stars) and former In Living Color cast member, sometimes actor and comedian, A.J.
