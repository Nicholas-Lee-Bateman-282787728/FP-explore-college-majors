I FOUND OUT THIS PAST FEBRUARY AT WALMART THAT THE UNEDITED VERSION WAS RELEASED. I WAS SHOCKED. I LOOKED ON THE BACK OF THE COVER 2 CHECK THE RUNNING TIME. IT SAID APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS. SO I BOUGHT IT, DROVE HOME, AND LOOKED AT THIS VERSION SINCE I NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SHORT VERSION. I'VE SEEN THE SHORT VERSION NUMEROUS TIMES AND I WAS ABLE 2 TELL WHAT SCENES WERE CUT OUT, AND WHAT SCENES WERE KEPT IN. I MUST SAY, I WISHED I HAD SEEN THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN 1989. I WAS 19 THEN. I'M NOW 41. I'M KEEPING BOTH VERSIONS. I JUST WISHED THE PEOPLE WHO RESTORED THIS FILM HAD REFORMATTED IT 2 WIDESCREEN AND PUT THE SOUND IN 5.1 SURROUND. THIS FILM WOULD DEFINITELY BE BETTER WITH THOSE FORMATS. OH, THERE,S BEEN A MISTAKE. THE BACK COVER SAYS THE FILM CONTAINS 32 MINUTES MORE FOOTAGE. ACTUALLY, IT'S 29 MINUTES MORE. THE EDITED VERSION RUNS 2 HOURS AND 28 MINUTES. THE ENTIRE VERSION RUNS 2 HOURS AND 57 MINUTES.

437659,A2I7PIEDIVES6F,6304846126,Charlie Griffin,"[1, 1]","Several reviewers gave this VHS version a poor rating or only 1 star.  Most complained that this version was edited and chopped up and missing several key scenes of the original movie.  They are incorrect.  This is the full, unedited version of the original TV movie.  I would prefer to have it on DVD, but after reading the reviews, I'll just keep this copy and have it converted to DVD myself.I don't need to go into detail about the movie, as probably anyone interested in buying it would have already seen it.  Needless to say, this is one of my all time favorite TV mini series movies.  The cast is stellar.  Every woman and man gives a superb performance, even the very young Larenz Tate did a wonderful job as one of Cora Lee's brood. I especially enjoyed Jackee Harry as Etta Mae Johnson.  One of my favorite scenes is where she is in attendance at the tenants' association meeting when she tells Miss Sophie, who had just insulted her, ""What's that supposed to mean?  You old prune pit!  Get on my nerve!""One of the most emotional scenes is between Mattie and Ceil, after Ceil loses her baby to electrocution. Ceil is catatonic with grief and depression.  Mattie is determined to bring her back out of her darkness and tells her, ""Ceil, you can leave this world, but it will be over my dead body!""  The way Mattie forces Ceil to break down and sob is just heart wrenching and touching at the same time.  That scene is a testament to feminine compassion, strength and love. I can just feel the warmth and love in Mattie's embrace and rocking Ceil, commanding her to, ""Come on! Come on! Come on back, chile!  That's right. Come on back!""  I lose it every time...To clarify:  BUY THE VHS version of this mini seriers, NOT THE DVD!  There is a huge difference.  The DVD is trash.  Key scenes are deleted.  Many folks probably don't even own a VCR or player anymore, but I strongly urge them to buy the VHS and then have it converted to DVD.  If you buy the DVD already edited, you will not be getting the full TV version and will miss many good and important scenes.",5,"This is the full, unedited version of the TV movie.",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2071,"['Several', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'VHS', 'version', 'poor', 'rating', 'only', '1', 'star', 'Most', 'complained', 'version', 'was', 'edited', 'chopped', 'up', 'missing', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'original', 'movie', 'are', 'incorrect', 'full', 'unedited', 'version', 'original', 'TV', 'movie', 'would', 'prefer', 'have', 'DVD', 'reading', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'just', 'keep', 'copy', 'have', 'converted', 'DVD', 'myself.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'detail', 'movie', 'probably', 'anyone', 'interested', 'buying', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Needless', 'say', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'movies', 'cast', 'stellar', 'woman', 'man', 'superb', 'performance', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'one', 'Cora', 'Lee', 'brood', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Jackee', 'Harry', 'Etta', 'Mae', 'Johnson', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'where', 'attendance', 'tenants', 'association', 'meeting', 'when', 'Miss', 'Sophie', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'insulted', 'What', 'supposed', 'mean', 'old', 'prune', 'pit', 'Get', 'nerve', 'One', 'most', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Mattie', 'Ceil', 'Ceil', 'baby', 'electrocution', 'Ceil', 'catatonic', 'grief', 'depression', 'Mattie', 'determined', 'bring', 'back', 'darkness', 'Ceil', 'can', 'leave', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'body', 'way', 'Mattie', 'forces', 'Ceil', 'break', 'down', 'sob', 'just', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'touching', 'same', 'time', 'scene', 'testament', 'feminine', 'compassion', 'strength', 'love', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'warmth', 'love', 'Mattie', 'embrace', 'rocking', 'Ceil', 'commanding', 'Come', 'Come', 'Come', 'back', 'chile', 'right', 'Come', 'back', 'lose', 'time', 'clarify', 'BUY', 'THE', 'VHS', 'version', 'mini', 'seriers', 'NOT', 'THE', 'DVD', 'huge', 'difference', 'DVD', 'trash', 'Key', 'scenes', 'are', 'deleted', 'Many', 'folks', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'own', 'VCR', 'player', 'anymore', 'strongly', 'urge', 'buy', 'VHS', 'then', 'have', 'converted', 'DVD', 'buy', 'DVD', 'already', 'edited', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'getting', 'full', 'TV', 'version', 'will', 'miss', 'many', 'good', 'important', 'scenes']",Women of Brewster Place VHS

If anybody loves women's issues in any context, it's yours truly, and this movie made a huge impact on me.Oprah Winfrey always has her heart in the right place, even if she often seems to choose projects that come up short in the eyes of others.  Hey, I like Oprah, but I don't love her like others seem to do, and she CAN act.  I found her performance as Mattie Michael both touching and strong.  In fact, I wanted to beat her daddy with something worse than the broom he attacked her with, and I think Mattie was an amazingly strong woman in the face of all her woes.  Hell, I would have crumpled in 20 minutes!The Women of Brewster place shows a community of people--not just the women--who have little materialistically, but are rich in friendship and concern for each other.  My favorite characters would have to be Luciela (played by the underrated and extremely talented Lynn Whitfield) and her sad situation with a selfish husband, and the middle class girl Kiswana (Robin Givens) who really tries hard to make a difference as she turns her back a bit unfairly on her priviledged upbringing.  Cicely Tyson is only in the movie for 5 minutes, but what a great performance she turns in as she tells her daughter Kiswana/Melanie  what's what.  Her performance made me want to stand up and cheer, but I also understood that Kiswana had to follow her heart and try to make that difference.The movie made me laugh, cry, and think, but most of all it brought across one crucial point:  people can tear down the walls of oppression if they stand together rather than just let a few people do it alone in vain.  That is a very good, encouraging message indeed.",4,I Liked it for What it Is.,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1845,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'never', 'saw', 'uncut', 'version', 'movie', 'have', 'gotten', 'reading', 'book', 'yet', 'bought', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'tear', 'away', 'anybody', 'women', 'issues', 'context', 'yours', 'truly', 'movie', 'made', 'huge', 'impact', 'me.Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'always', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'even', 'often', 'choose', 'projects', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'eyes', 'others', 'Hey', 'like', 'Oprah', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'others', 'seem', 'do', 'CAN', 'act', 'found', 'performance', 'Mattie', 'Michael', 'touching', 'strong', 'fact', 'wanted', 'beat', 'daddy', 'something', 'worse', 'broom', 'attacked', 'think', 'Mattie', 'was', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'woman', 'face', 'woes', 'Hell', 'would', 'have', 'crumpled', '20', 'minutes', 'Women', 'Brewster', 'place', 'community', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'materialistically', 'are', 'rich', 'friendship', 'concern', 'other', 'favorite', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Luciela', 'played', 'underrated', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'sad', 'situation', 'selfish', 'husband', 'middle', 'class', 'girl', 'Kiswana', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'who', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'difference', 'back', 'bit', 'unfairly', 'priviledged', 'upbringing', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'only', 'movie', '5', 'minutes', 'what', 'great', 'performance', 'daughter', 'Kiswana/Melanie', 'what', 'what', 'performance', 'made', 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'also', 'understood', 'Kiswana', 'had', 'follow', 'heart', 'try', 'make', 'difference.The', 'movie', 'made', 'cry', 'think', 'most', 'brought', 'across', 'one', 'crucial', 'point', 'people', 'can', 'tear', 'down', 'walls', 'oppression', 'stand', 'together', 'rather', 'just', 'let', 'few', 'people', 'do', 'alone', 'vain', 'very', 'good', 'encouraging', 'message', 'indeed']",Women of Brewster Place VHS

437681,A170QM825KM60W,6304846126,rmcrae,"[1, 1]","Being too young to watch Brewster Place when it originally aired in 1989, I had the pleasure of seeing it when I was older and it's one of my favorite tv miniseries ever. Based on Gloria Naylor's award winning 1982 novel, The Women of Brewster Place chronicles the lives and struggles of seven black women in the bleak, 60's era inner city neighborhood Brewster Place.Daytime talk diva Oprah Winfrey (who also served as producer) stars as Mattie Michael, a middle aged woman  who's had her fair share of pain and disappointment. Shunned by her parents after becoming a teen mom, Mattie is forced to move once more to the rundown housing project after her young son is accused of murder and flees authorities, causing her to lose her home. She quickly becomes the matriarch of the community, viewed as a source of strength and comfort to the other women.Jackee Harry (of 227 and Sister, Sister fame) is Mattie's man hungry, love starved friend Etta Mae Johnson. Desperately longing for security and stability, she moves from one louse to the next until she settles into Brewster Place. Robin Givens portrays Melanie ""Kiswana"" Browne, a naive, idealistic girl who abandons her privileged middle class upbringing and college education to find her ""black roots"" in Brewster Place. She makes it her mission to bring social change to the neighborhood, no matter how challenging and impossible it seems. Screen legend Cicely Tyson has a short scene as Kiswana's dissaproving mother, but she uses her time to shine with an amazing monologue.Ciel Turner (Lynn Whitfield), the granddaughter of a kind woman who took Mattie and her son into her home many years ago, is a young wife and mother struggling to keep her family together. However, she loses it all in order to find herself. Cora Lee (Phyllis Yvonne Stickney) is the neglectful mother of a brood of rowdy kids (think the 60's version of Octomom) always causing a ruckus for the neighbors. Obsessed with baby dolls since childhood, the woman thinks of her own children as dolls when they're infants, but loses interest in them once they're older.Lorraine (Lonette McKee) is one half of a lesbian couple who feels unwelcomed by many in the community. Her partner Theresa (Paula Kelly) couldn't care less about being judged, but Lorraine's need for acceptance is consuming and she befriends Ben (Moses Gunn), friendly older man who genuinely cares for her. Unfortunately the mean and spiteful gossip Miss Sophie (Olivia Cole) enjoys causing trouble for the couple by spreads all kinds of vicious rumors about them. She gets put in her place soon enough though.A shocking act of violence brings everyone in the community together and gives them the power to fight back against racism, homophobia, violence against women, drugs, and other struggles of inner city life.The acting is truly remarkable. You feel for all of the characters (even Miss Sophie to a degree) and root for them to overcome the corruption and hopelessness surrounding them. It's painful to see Lorraine yearning for acceptance from the other tenants and being shot down at every turn. Poor Ciel about to lose her sanity when all that is near and dear to her is destroyed, but Mattie does everything in her power to pull her back from the brink.My only gripe (and a very big one) is that many key scenes are cut out of this DVD edition. I won't rehash them all, but it's annoying and plain unfair to pay for a movie you love with certain scenes missing. Instead of buying this edition, look for the Original Uncut Version released this past February. It's much better when you get to see this moving drama in its entirety.",4,"Excellent movie, but awful dvd",1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,3637,"['Being', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'Brewster', 'Place', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '1989', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'one', 'favorite', 'tv', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'Based', 'Gloria', 'Naylor', 'award', 'winning', '1982', 'novel', 'Women', 'Brewster', 'Place', 'lives', 'struggles', 'seven', 'black', 'women', 'bleak', '60', 'era', 'inner', 'city', 'neighborhood', 'Brewster', 'Place.Daytime', 'talk', 'diva', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'producer', 'Mattie', 'Michael', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'pain', 'disappointment', 'Shunned', 'parents', 'becoming', 'teen', 'mom', 'Mattie', 'forced', 'move', 'once', 'more', 'rundown', 'housing', 'project', 'young', 'son', 'accused', 'murder', 'flees', 'authorities', 'causing', 'lose', 'home', 'quickly', 'matriarch', 'community', 'viewed', 'source', 'strength', 'comfort', 'other', 'women.Jackee', 'Harry', '227', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'fame', 'Mattie', 'man', 'hungry', 'love', 'starved', 'friend', 'Etta', 'Mae', 'Johnson', 'Desperately', 'longing', 'security', 'stability', 'one', 'louse', 'next', 'Brewster', 'Place', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'Melanie', 'Kiswana', 'Browne', 'naive', 'idealistic', 'girl', 'who', 'privileged', 'middle', 'class', 'upbringing', 'college', 'education', 'find', 'black', 'roots', 'Brewster', 'Place', 'mission', 'bring', 'social', 'change', 'neighborhood', 'matter', 'how', 'challenging', 'impossible', 'Screen', 'legend', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'short', 'scene', 'Kiswana', 'dissaproving', 'mother', 'time', 'shine', 'amazing', 'monologue.Ciel', 'Turner', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'granddaughter', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'Mattie', 'son', 'home', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'young', 'wife', 'mother', 'struggling', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'However', 'order', 'find', 'Cora', 'Lee', 'Phyllis', 'Yvonne', 'Stickney', 'neglectful', 'mother', 'brood', 'rowdy', 'kids', 'think', '60', 'version', 'Octomom', 'always', 'causing', 'ruckus', 'neighbors', 'Obsessed', 'baby', 'dolls', 'childhood', 'woman', 'own', 'children', 'dolls', 'when', ""'re"", 'infants', 'interest', 'once', ""'re"", 'older.Lorraine', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'one', 'half', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'unwelcomed', 'many', 'community', 'partner', 'Theresa', 'Paula', 'Kelly', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'being', 'judged', 'Lorraine', 'need', 'acceptance', 'consuming', 'Ben', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'friendly', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Unfortunately', 'mean', 'spiteful', 'gossip', 'Miss', 'Sophie', 'Olivia', 'Cole', 'causing', 'trouble', 'couple', 'spreads', 'kinds', 'vicious', 'rumors', 'put', 'place', 'soon', 'enough', 'though.A', 'shocking', 'act', 'violence', 'brings', 'everyone', 'community', 'together', 'power', 'fight', 'back', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'violence', 'women', 'drugs', 'other', 'struggles', 'inner', 'city', 'life.The', 'acting', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'feel', 'characters', 'even', 'Miss', 'Sophie', 'degree', 'root', 'overcome', 'corruption', 'hopelessness', 'surrounding', 'painful', 'see', 'Lorraine', 'yearning', 'acceptance', 'other', 'tenants', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'turn', 'Poor', 'Ciel', 'lose', 'sanity', 'when', 'near', 'dear', 'destroyed', 'Mattie', 'everything', 'power', 'pull', 'back', 'brink.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'very', 'big', 'one', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'cut', 'DVD', 'edition', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'annoying', 'plain', 'unfair', 'pay', 'movie', 'love', 'certain', 'scenes', 'missing', 'Instead', 'buying', 'edition', 'look', 'Original', 'Uncut', 'Version', 'released', 'past', 'February', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'moving', 'drama', 'entirety']",Women of Brewster Place VHS

I did not read the book so I was not disappointed.And Oprah was great.,5,I loved it,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,221,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'book', 'should', 'not', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.And', 'Oprah', 'was', 'great']",Women of Brewster Place VHS

I just got the DVD and was surprised that scenes were missing that i remember when it came on tv years ago.  One scene I distinctly remember was when her son went to jail and he was complaining about how bad conditions were.  What I can't understand is why they would take out scenes.  My only guess is that they did not want to use a dual layer disc and they did not want to use 2 discs.  I think it would have been well worth it to put out a version with all of the scenes and maybe even extras.  I think it just stinks as it stands.  They need to re-release the disc properly.  Right now, I feel gypped.Oh yeah, I just thought of another scene that is missing, when Eva died and the kids were left outside after school.  Why did they leave that out?  Oh well, I am sure there are other scenes, I just can't remember them all.  What a bummer!",3,Don't bother buying the DVD!,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,965,"['Rest', 'assured', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'actual', 'movie', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'terrible', 'DVD', 'just', 'got', 'DVD', 'was', 'surprised', 'scenes', 'were', 'missing', 'i', 'remember', 'when', 'came', 'tv', 'years', 'ago', 'One', 'scene', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'was', 'when', 'son', 'went', 'jail', 'was', 'complaining', 'how', 'bad', 'conditions', 'were', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'take', 'out', 'scenes', 'only', 'guess', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'use', 'dual', 'layer', 'disc', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'use', '2', 'discs', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'put', 'out', 'version', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'even', 'extras', 'think', 'just', 'need', 're-release', 'disc', 'properly', 'Right', 'now', 'feel', 'gypped.Oh', 'yeah', 'just', 'thought', 'scene', 'missing', 'when', 'Eva', 'died', 'kids', 'were', 'left', 'outside', 'school', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'out', 'Oh', 'well', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'What', 'bummer']",Women of Brewster Place VHS
