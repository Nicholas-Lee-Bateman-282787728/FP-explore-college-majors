1091357,A1VIWPHBMTUWJV,B000TLTCNG,C. M. Street,"[67, 68]","If you asked fans of old TV western series to recall the names of 5 or even 10 series from the heyday of the era in the late 50's ,early 60's it is unlikely thatCimarron City would be one of those mentioned. Not because it was bad series, more likely because it ran only one season of 26 episodes at a time when the airwaves were dominated by over 20 westerns per week. It is also sometimes confused with the later Stuart Whitman series `Cimarron Strip'Surprising, but welcome therefore, that Timeless Media have released a dozen of those episodes along with several other western series recently.Cimarron City appeared in the 50 minute format from 1958/60. Starring George Montgomery, an excellent western hero from many features in the late 40's/50's.It was a `Mont Production' indicating Montgomery had a hand in the production.Montgomery played Matt Rockford cattle rancher & mayor of Cimarron City in the 1890's. His father had been the founder of the town & Rockford was anxious for it to grow & prosper. Also in the regular cast were Audrey Totter as hotel owner Beth Purcell & John Smith (later star of Laramie) as Deputy Sheriff Lane Temple. Also appearing was Dan Blocker of Bonanza fame who had a recurring role as Tiny Buddinger, a townsman & slight comic relief. Curiously in an early episode Blocker played a villain of the same name.Montgomery does not appear in every episode.Cimarron City was very much an adult western. relying on strong plotlines & characterisation rather than fights, chases & gunplay. Numerous guest stars included Fred MacMurray in the pilot (sadly not included in this set) the always menacing Dan Duryea, Elizabeth Montgomery, Dorothy Provine & J Carrol Naish. Seasoned western aficionados will also spot Don Megowan & the ever sneering Robert Wilke in familiar roles. Interesting plots include the tracking of a mysterious beast & the outbreak of bubonic plague, along with the usual western fare.The episodes in this set comprise2 Terror Town3  To Become a Man5  Medicine Man6  Hired Hand8 Beast of the Cimarron10 The Bloodline13 The Bitter Lesson18 Beauty & the Sorrow19  Return of the Dead22 The Ratman23 Have Sword, Will Duel26 The Evil OneIt appears that the deal struck between Timeless Media & NBC relates only to the `rights' to issue these series, not the supply of original prints which apparently are very costly to remaster. Accordingly Timeless have to track down their own prints which seem to come from 16mm sources. They do seem to have found some decent masters here & although they are not as sharp & detailed as studio prints, are still quite clean & clear. Do not expect the same quality obtainable from some other black & white series such as `Gunsmoke' or `Rawhide' currently available from Paramount. There are the odd flecks & scratches & they are not as `sharp as some but perfectly watchable. Sound seems fine & quite distinct.There are 3 discs (4 episodes per disc), each in its own case in an outer slip case.If you prefer the `Roy Rogers' style western with lots of action then these may disappoint, on the other hand if you like `Gunsmoke' with its more involved storylines then I'm sure this will appeal. I think TV western fans familiar with the genre should enjoy.I was unsure whether to award 4 or 5 stars, based on the print quality, but all things considered & knowing the problems involved I have given it 5. It is pleasing that Timeless have released Cimarron City as the major studios would never consider it & it is probably the only opportunity we will get to revisit some of these vintage shows.",5,Vintage TV Western,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3579,"['asked', 'fans', 'old', 'TV', 'western', 'series', 'recall', 'names', '5', 'even', '10', 'series', 'heyday', 'era', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'unlikely', 'thatCimarron', 'City', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'mentioned', 'Not', 'was', 'bad', 'series', 'more', 'likely', 'ran', 'only', 'one', 'season', '26', 'episodes', 'time', 'when', 'airwaves', 'were', 'dominated', '20', 'westerns', 'week', 'also', 'sometimes', 'confused', 'later', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'series', 'Cimarron', ""Strip'Surprising"", 'welcome', 'therefore', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'have', 'released', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'several', 'other', 'western', 'series', 'recently.Cimarron', 'City', 'appeared', '50', 'minute', 'format', '1958/60', 'Starring', 'George', 'Montgomery', 'excellent', 'western', 'hero', 'many', 'features', 'late', ""40's/50's.It"", 'was', 'Mont', 'Production', 'indicating', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'hand', 'production.Montgomery', 'played', 'Matt', 'Rockford', 'rancher', 'mayor', 'Cimarron', 'City', '1890', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'founder', 'town', 'Rockford', 'was', 'anxious', 'grow', 'prosper', 'Also', 'regular', 'cast', 'were', 'Audrey', 'Totter', 'hotel', 'owner', 'Beth', 'Purcell', 'John', 'Smith', 'later', 'star', 'Laramie', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'Lane', 'Temple', 'Also', 'appearing', 'was', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'Bonanza', 'fame', 'who', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'Tiny', 'Buddinger', 'townsman', 'slight', 'comic', 'relief', 'Curiously', 'early', 'episode', 'Blocker', 'played', 'villain', 'same', 'name.Montgomery', 'not', 'appear', 'episode.Cimarron', 'City', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'adult', 'western', 'relying', 'strong', 'plotlines', 'characterisation', 'rather', 'fights', 'chases', 'gunplay', 'Numerous', 'guest', 'stars', 'included', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'pilot', 'sadly', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'always', 'menacing', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Dorothy', 'Provine', 'J', 'Carrol', 'Naish', 'Seasoned', 'western', 'aficionados', 'will', 'also', 'spot', 'Don', 'Megowan', 'ever', 'sneering', 'Robert', 'Wilke', 'familiar', 'roles', 'Interesting', 'plots', 'include', 'tracking', 'mysterious', 'beast', 'outbreak', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'usual', 'western', 'fare.The', 'episodes', 'set', 'comprise2', 'Terror', 'Town3', 'Become', 'Man5', 'Medicine', 'Man6', 'Hired', 'Hand8', 'Beast', 'Cimarron10', 'Bloodline13', 'Bitter', 'Lesson18', 'Beauty', 'Sorrow19', 'Return', 'Dead22', 'Ratman23', 'Have', 'Sword', 'Will', 'Duel26', 'Evil', 'OneIt', 'deal', 'struck', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'NBC', 'only', 'rights', 'issue', 'series', 'not', 'supply', 'original', 'prints', 'apparently', 'are', 'very', 'costly', 'remaster', 'Accordingly', 'Timeless', 'have', 'track', 'down', 'own', 'prints', 'seem', 'come', '16mm', 'sources', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'decent', 'masters', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'sharp', 'detailed', 'studio', 'prints', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'clean', 'clear', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'same', 'quality', 'obtainable', 'other', 'black', 'white', 'series', 'such', 'Gunsmoke', 'Rawhide', 'currently', 'available', 'Paramount', 'are', 'odd', 'flecks', 'scratches', 'are', 'not', 'sharp', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'Sound', 'fine', 'quite', 'are', '3', 'discs', '4', 'episodes', 'disc', 'own', 'case', 'outer', 'slip', 'case.If', 'prefer', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'style', 'western', 'lots', 'action', 'then', 'may', 'disappoint', 'other', 'hand', 'like', 'Gunsmoke', 'more', 'involved', 'storylines', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'appeal', 'think', 'TV', 'western', 'fans', 'familiar', 'genre', 'should', 'enjoy.I', 'was', 'unsure', 'award', '4', '5', 'stars', 'based', 'print', 'quality', 'things', 'considered', 'knowing', 'problems', 'involved', 'have', 'given', '5', 'pleasing', 'Timeless', 'have', 'released', 'Cimarron', 'City', 'major', 'studios', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'probably', 'only', 'opportunity', 'will', 'get', 'revisit', 'vintage', 'shows']",Cimarron City

I'm not sure how the 12 episodes were picked. It's hard to judge the quality of a show when you have only a third of the episodes on which to base your opinion. The setting for the show is in Oklahoma post Civil War era. Matt Rockford is the mayor of Cimmaron City and is the central character who solves all the town's problems and mysteries. Although the show is set in the Wild West, many of the plots are not really traditionally western in nature. For example, there is one show where Matt Rockford is a prisoner in a silver mine. Another show is something out of horror movie which features a severely deformed many who travels down the Oklahoma territory killing innocent people. There are a few good shows that fit with the western style genre. For example the episode To Become a Man is classic for it's portrayal of honor, courage, manhood, and western style shootouts. I guess you can say that Cimmaron City is an action/mystery show that is set in the west.The quality of the video and audio is less than desirable and the acting is not as good as you would see in other westerns such as Gunsmoke and the Rifleman. I love westerns from the 1950s era but I really struggle with this one. It is no where near a 5 star rating but I'm not sure it is a low as a three either.
