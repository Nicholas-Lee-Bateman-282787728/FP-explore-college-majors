688494,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005Y1UV,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 25]","There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal ""nothing"" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the ""Revenge Thriller"".After watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clich&eacute; reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clich&eacute;?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the ""Revenge Thrill"" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.

In 1996, Kiefer returned to the silver screen, starring in the role that chilled me to the very bone: EYE FOR AN EYE, co-starring Sally Field, Ed Harris, Joe Montegna, & Beverly D'Angelo.KAREN McCANN (played by Sally Field) is a happy woman with her 17-year-old daughter named JULIE (played by Olivia Burnette) and an 8-year-old daughter named MEGAN (played by Alexandra Kyle). Karen is married to MACK McCANN, her second marriage, making Julie the stepdaughter of Mack. It is Megan's birthday. While Karen is on her way home from work. She stops at a balloon shop to pick balloons for Megan's birthday and drives on her way into a huge traffic jam. While stuck in the jam, Karen calls home and finds that Julie is home early, trying to help out with the party decorations. Karen and Julie talk until they are interrupted by Julie having to answer the door, after someone rings the doorbell. Suddenly, someone busts into the house and begins beating on Julie. Karen jumps out of her car and screams for someone to call 911 as she tries to stay on the line with Julie. This man rapes Julie, then picks up a shattered piece of an ice sculpture and smashes it over Julie's face, killing her.Karen enters a deep depression and paranoia. Karen is now experiencing what no parent wants to ever experience. SGT. DENILLO (played by Joe Montegna), who is also a Detective, is on the hunt for Julie's killer. He even recommends that Mack and Karen go to a group for parents who have lost their children. Denillo contacts Karen and informs her that they've caught a matching suspect, after doing a DNA test on Julie's body. The suspect is ROBERT DOOB (played by Kiefer Sutherland). He is held in custody, but he is released on a technicality. Justice sucks, doesn't it?Karen knows Robert is the one and he is getting away free. She begins following him and spying on him. Robert works at the supermarket as a delivery boy. He frequently delivers groceries to a Spanish woman, so Karen follows him the delivery. He hands the Latino lady her groceries and pisses on her house, sort of marking his territory, making note of his next supposed victim.Over the course of the next three weeks, Karen begins taking self-defense classes as well as learning how to shoot a gun, but she drops out after realizing that tracking down Robert and shooting him like this is not self-defense, but premedatated murder.Karen then finds out that Robert has now killed his Spanish customer and is being held for 48 hours and is being released. Karen wants Robert dead. She wants him to pay for the lives of her daughter and that Spanish woman. Knowing she can't kill him just like that, she figures out another way. As Mack and Megan head off to a vacation spot, where Karen will be heading up in a day or so, Karen enters Robert's appartment and ransacks the place. Robert finds the place a mess and realizes that Karen is responsible.Karen is in the shower, not knowing that Robert has now entered her house, ready to murder her as he did her daughter. He opens the shower curtain, to find the shower empty and Karen behind him. They have a short-lived brawl, ending with Karen shooting and killing Robert in self-defense, since he did break-in with the intentions of harming and killing Karen.Now, as I said many times before, Kiefer Sutherland is my favorite actor. His portrayal of Robert Doob in this film was seriously terrifying. I'm not kidding. Everytime I watch this film, I have to leave the room when Kiefer's scenes come up, since he scared the sh*t out of me in this movie. That only goes to show how amazing of an actor Kiefer is. Another amazing thing about Kiefer is that his appearance in this movie made him look like another celebrity: JAMES HETFIELD, Lead singer of the Heavy Metal band, METALLICA. He seriously looked like James of METALLICA. I would know since I am both a huge fan of Kiefer and METALLICA. Sally Field is a very good actress and she displays it her.

The film follows Karen (Sally Field) as she seeks revenge against the man that murdered her daughter Julie.  After the case against this man is botched he is set free to roam the streets and kill other innocent women.  Karen won't have that, and so she sets out to take care of the matter herself.  She first begins attending a help group, a group made up of parents mourning the death of their children due to violence, and it's at these meetings that she's given hope, for here is where she's given the support and the opportunity to take matters into her own hands and end the life of a man who shouldn't be free.  Sally Field does a great job of portraying a woman slowly driven mad by the death of her seventeen year old daughter, and Ed Harris does a brilliant job playing her concerned husband, trying to keep his family together in this difficult time.  That said, the true star of this film is non other than Kiefer Sutherland who plays the killer with such arrogance and nonchalance that your shaking in your skin with every movement, every word, and sight and sound of this man.  This killer has no care in the world.  ""It's nothing personal"" and he proves that with his lack of care or concern for what he's done, and the fact that there's no rhyme or reason to his random crime.  As he states... ""She could have been anyone...I didn't even know her name.""

When rapist/murderer Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland) is released on a technicality, the parents are rightfully appalled.  Understandably enraged, Mack lunges at Doob while Karen sinks into a deep depression.  Karen later joins a support group for parents whose children have been murdered, and she finds some solace in the company.  What she doesn't find is a resolution, however, and it's not until she meets Sidney Hughes (Phillip Baker Hall) - a fellow parent who believes in harsh retribution outside the courthouse - that she can channel her inner Charles Bronson and seek vengeance.One of the best acting duos I've seen on film, Field and Harris emote like no other pair.  Their commitment to the grief feels completely real, and the effort exudes from each anguished wrinkle in their faces.  Similarly, Kiefer Sutherland is superb in his role as revolting sociopath.  Sandwiched between his deranged pervert fromFreewayand his rapist racist combo inA Time to Kill, it's easy to see this as his evil virtuoso period.The entire second act is tense, as Karen's obsession takes over her life.  It's how most with a murdered family member would want to seek revenge. The plot is not terribly original, but it's performed with enough conviction that it is easily overlooked.

688531,A2W1TK5CJXKH5U,B00005Y1UV,Jon Linden,"[0, 0]","This movie was extremely interesting.  It casts Sally Fields in a type of role that heretofore I have never seen her play.  In this particular picture, Sally Fields is the mother of a 17 year old child who is raped and murdered by a relative stranger.  The rapist/murderer gains access to the house in a legitimate manner, as a delivery person.  But shortly after the entrance, he attacks the unexpecting daughter, raping and murdering her without a single bit of remorse.  In fact, it turns out that this criminal is a serial rapist/murderer and he uses the same modus operandi every time.He is in fact caught by the police.  However, as a result of the police failing to comply with the proper legal procedures regarding DNA evidence and the provision of same to the defense, the incriminating evidence is disallowed by the Judge and the rapist/murderer's attorney thus makes a motion for the case to be dismissed as a result of lack of evidence to convict.  The Judge grants the order and the criminal goes free.This point in the movie is where Sally Fields truly takes on a new kind of role.  Shortly after this event in Court, the rapist/murderer commits another similar crime.  Fields had warned the police that the victim of this second crime was on the criminals list for attack.  However, the police are unable to protect her from the inevitable rape and murder.  And, as a result of his experience in Court with Fields' daughter, he is able to cover any incriminating evidience by using a condum during the rape, so as not to leave and incriminating DNA evidence.  Thus, Fields is faced with the prospect of definitive knowledge of this criminal's serial nature and the fact that he has learned precisely how to perform his dastardly deeds without ever getting caught and prosecuted successfully.  Thus, Fields must consider basically a vigilante act of Justice.The problem for Fields is how to perform this act of vengeful Justice without herself becoming a person whom the police can arrest and convict of murder.  That is the part that I will leave to this review's readers to imagine until they see the film.  As an Amazon Prime member, I was able to view this film on my iPad for no cost whatsoever, a wonderful benefit of Prime membership which I have now often availed myself of in the recent past as I am a new Apple user.  Nonetheless, however one wishes to view this film, either via their computer as an Amazon Prime member or on their VCR as a purchaser of the DVD, they should avail themselves of the opportunity.  It is definitely worth their time to see Fields in this unique perspective and to see how she manages to pull off the role in a fully convincing manner.While the subject of this film is somewhat mature, I would recommend it to all viewers over the age of 18 years of age.  Yet, it is clearly worth the investment of time, and even money to see this masterful performance by Fields who does a wonderful job in a uniquely different form of role from her past performances.  I highly recommend viewers to take the time and/or cost to view this picture.  It is worth the watch!",4,Sally Fields As A Vigilante!!!,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,3111,"['movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'type', 'role', 'heretofore', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'particular', 'picture', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'mother', '17', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'who', 'raped', 'murdered', 'relative', 'stranger', 'rapist/murderer', 'gains', 'access', 'house', 'legitimate', 'manner', 'delivery', 'person', 'shortly', 'entrance', 'unexpecting', 'daughter', 'raping', 'murdering', 'single', 'bit', 'remorse', 'fact', 'out', 'criminal', 'serial', 'rapist/murderer', 'same', 'modus', 'operandi', 'time.He', 'fact', 'caught', 'police', 'However', 'result', 'police', 'failing', 'comply', 'proper', 'legal', 'procedures', 'regarding', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'provision', 'same', 'defense', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'disallowed', 'Judge', 'rapist/murderer', 'attorney', 'thus', 'motion', 'case', 'be', 'dismissed', 'result', 'lack', 'evidence', 'convict', 'Judge', 'grants', 'order', 'criminal', 'free.This', 'point', 'movie', 'where', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'truly', 'new', 'kind', 'role', 'Shortly', 'event', 'Court', 'rapist/murderer', 'similar', 'crime', 'Fields', 'had', 'warned', 'police', 'victim', 'second', 'crime', 'was', 'criminals', 'list', 'attack', 'However', 'police', 'are', 'unable', 'protect', 'inevitable', 'rape', 'murder', 'result', 'experience', 'Court', 'Fields', 'daughter', 'able', 'cover', 'incriminating', 'evidience', 'using', 'condum', 'rape', 'so', 'not', 'leave', 'incriminating', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'Thus', 'Fields', 'faced', 'prospect', 'definitive', 'knowledge', 'criminal', 'serial', 'nature', 'fact', 'learned', 'precisely', 'how', 'perform', 'dastardly', 'ever', 'getting', 'caught', 'prosecuted', 'successfully', 'Thus', 'Fields', 'must', 'consider', 'basically', 'vigilante', 'act', 'Justice.The', 'problem', 'Fields', 'how', 'perform', 'act', 'vengeful', 'Justice', 'becoming', 'person', 'whom', 'police', 'can', 'arrest', 'convict', 'murder', 'part', 'will', 'leave', 'review', 'readers', 'imagine', 'see', 'film', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'member', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'film', 'iPad', 'cost', 'whatsoever', 'wonderful', 'benefit', 'Prime', 'membership', 'have', 'now', 'often', 'availed', 'recent', 'past', 'am', 'new', 'Apple', 'user', 'Nonetheless', 'however', 'one', 'wishes', 'view', 'film', 'computer', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'member', 'VCR', 'purchaser', 'DVD', 'should', 'avail', 'opportunity', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'see', 'Fields', 'unique', 'perspective', 'see', 'how', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'fully', 'convincing', 'subject', 'film', 'somewhat', 'mature', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'age', '18', 'years', 'age', 'clearly', 'worth', 'investment', 'time', 'even', 'money', 'see', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Fields', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'uniquely', 'different', 'form', 'role', 'past', 'performances', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'take', 'time', 'cost', 'view', 'picture', 'watch']",N/A

Thanks to a gruesomely powerful turn by Kiefer Sutherland as a killer/rapist, the audience cannot help but stand with Sally Field in her quest for justice.  Whether this justice comes through our legal system (which is never truly just), or whether it comes at her hands, Kiefer is definitely not an addition to the social world.

Both are different stories, but both reflect the realty of our justice system failing to protect the innocent and convict a psychopath. ""We can't do anything unless ""he""(Keifer)"" does something else. And even when he does commit rape and murder again, he is still a free man due to lack of evidence. I think forensic technology has come a long way since this movie was made, but the justice system hasn't changed much. I highly disagree with what one reviewer said about the film about a woman unjustly killing a man. First off, they say if you sell drugs once and only once or if it's your last time, or if someone convinced you, it doesn't matter, you're still guilty of the crime and you are labeled a DEALER. You're responsible for your own actions. Keifer breaks into Sally Field's house at the end with intent to do her bodily harm. The fact that she provoked him, or made him angry by trashing his house and leaving her hat on purpose is irrelevant. There is so such law that states, if a person is provoked can come and kill you justifiably. She had every right in the world to kill him. It was still self defense. But the revenge motive is where it gets tricky. We all would agree with her. He raped and killed her daughter and got away with it, as well as another woman. He was a unremorseful pyschopath who needed to be locked up or killed. But the fact that she planned it, as messed up as our judicial system is, wouldnt care what he did to her daughter. But once again, no one can make you do anything. He broke into her house and she defended herself. I'm sure the law would not recommend that everyone pulls a stunt like this when the justice system fails you. To take the law into your owns hands is merely a risk on your own freedom. But we must remember it's just a movie.My only critism is there is a little bit of what is called OVER-ACTING in which we all know Sally Field is known for I.E.(Soapdish)But the thing is, she is one of very few actresses that can get away with it. It isnt at all like Jennifer Lopez's horrible wanna be actress, make you ashamed you spent the money to see such a hideous performance, type of over acting. Sally DOES know how to act, she is talented, and knows how to go all the way with her emotions. Another example is when she finds out her ex husband is the maid (Mrs. Doubtfire) and she is first in shock, then it turns to anger, and then acceptance. The director left it in, because even though it was a little over the top, she was brilliant. I mean, it isnt an everyday situation you find out your ex dressed up as a woman to be the nanny for your kids.",5,"Realistic, entertaining, and underated",1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,2696,"['seeing', 'movie', 'ENOUGH', 'one', 'might', 'presume', 'Enough', 'copied', 'Eye', 'Eye', 'are', 'different', 'stories', 'reflect', 'realty', 'justice', 'system', 'failing', 'protect', 'innocent', 'convict', 'psychopath', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'Keifer', 'something', 'else', 'even', 'when', 'commit', 'rape', 'murder', 'again', 'still', 'free', 'man', 'due', 'lack', 'evidence', 'think', 'forensic', 'technology', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'justice', 'system', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'highly', 'disagree', 'what', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'woman', 'unjustly', 'killing', 'man', 'First', 'off', 'say', 'sell', 'drugs', 'once', 'only', 'once', 'last', 'time', 'someone', 'convinced', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'re"", 'still', 'guilty', 'crime', 'are', 'labeled', 'DEALER', ""'re"", 'responsible', 'own', 'actions', 'Keifer', 'breaks', 'Sally', 'Field', 'house', 'end', 'intent', 'do', 'bodily', 'harm', 'fact', 'provoked', 'made', 'angry', 'trashing', 'house', 'leaving', 'hat', 'purpose', 'irrelevant', 'so', 'such', 'law', 'person', 'provoked', 'can', 'come', 'kill', 'justifiably', 'had', 'right', 'world', 'kill', 'was', 'still', 'self', 'defense', 'revenge', 'motive', 'where', 'tricky', 'would', 'agree', 'raped', 'killed', 'daughter', 'got', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'was', 'unremorseful', 'pyschopath', 'who', 'needed', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'killed', 'fact', 'planned', 'messed', 'up', 'judicial', 'system', 'care', 'what', 'did', 'daughter', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'do', 'anything', 'broke', 'house', 'defended', ""'m"", 'sure', 'law', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'stunt', 'when', 'justice', 'system', 'take', 'law', 'hands', 'merely', 'risk', 'own', 'freedom', 'must', 'remember', 'just', 'movie.My', 'only', 'critism', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'called', 'OVER-ACTING', 'know', 'Sally', 'Field', 'known', 'I.E', 'Soapdish', 'thing', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'actresses', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'like', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'horrible', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'actress', 'make', 'ashamed', 'spent', 'money', 'see', 'such', 'hideous', 'performance', 'type', 'acting', 'Sally', 'DOES', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'talented', 'how', 'go', 'way', 'emotions', 'example', 'when', 'out', 'ex', 'husband', 'maid', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'first', 'shock', 'then', 'anger', 'then', 'acceptance', 'director', 'left', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'was', 'brilliant', 'mean', 'everyday', 'situation', 'find', 'out', 'ex', 'dressed', 'up', 'woman', 'be', 'nanny', 'kids']",N/A

It is a tale of a rape-murder and a legal system gone mad with ridiculous rules.  The 17 y.o. daughter of the Sally Field character is brutally raped and murdered in her own house.  The mother is appropriately grief-stricken but the father--the Ed Harris character--is weak with shallowness of emotion.  This hurts the film.  After the murder is caught and released on a technicality, the father is even confused about the appropriateness of the death penalty.The Sutherland character is convincing in his remarkable evil.  He is, in fact, a serial sexual murderer although only two of his sadistic acts are shown.  Retribution is perhaps predictable but entirely justified.  Still, for me, the movie lacked the deep emotional pathos almost always accompanying such detestable crimes.  I rather imagine that this is a problem with direction rather than acting.The movie explores punishment for vigilante activity--for applying an 'eye for an eye.'  An FBI agent says that such an act would be punishable by life in prison.....maybe not.  In Louisiana, some years ago, TV News people were filming the return of a pedophile following extradition from California.  The pedophile had kidnapped a man's son and taken him to California.  The pedophile was now being filmed, handcuffed, walking beside a Federal marshal in the Baton Rouge airport.A man making a phone call on the wall stepped out and shot the pedophile to death--all on TV.  In one smooth motion he turned the pistol over to the Federal Marshal.  The shooter was the father of the abducted boy.  The father was placed under arrest and a Grand Jury was convened.  The Grand Jury REFUSED to bring charges against the father.  They thought an 'eye for an eye' perfectly appropriate.

Julie McCann (Olivia Burnette) daughter/stepdaughter of Karen (Sally Fields) and Mack (Ed Harris) by Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland) and the legal systems failure to convict. The lead detective Sgt. Denillo (Joe Mantegna) assures the family that they have no worries that Doob will be convicted with all the evidence they have against him.Mack and Karen join a support group of fellow families and friends of murdered loved ones. Mack seems to be dealing with the loss fairly well while Karen's emotions are simmering until they boil over. At one the meetings Karen overhears a coulpe and Sidney Hughes (Philip Baker Hall) discussing killing the man responsible for their childs murder.  Karen won't let go of her loss nor will she let go of the fact that Doob's walked away from being held accountable for Julie's rape/murder by the legal system after being assured that the case was a sure conviction.The story/plot aren't new by any means as there have been many TV/Movies made before and since this one's release in 1996.The thing that sets this movie appart from the legions of other stories for me was the cast and their acting as well as the direction. The other factors that help to separate this movie from the others is the locations and the cinematography that help tell this story.There are a few things that hindered this story for me somewhat like the overtly used cliches describing Doob's personality like him throwing a cigarette on the ground when ask for a smoke by a homeless lady (Patricia Belcher) and him abusing a dog (implied), but my favorite was his choice of vehicles a US Mail delivery jeep. There are a few twists and turns in the story, but they are pretty transparent and can be seen  early on.Overall this is a good movie with great acting, but the over use of cliches and the lack of really creative writing can't raise this production above the already flooded market of revenge genre movies. Is this movie worth the time to watch? You Bet It Is!!! It just doesn't have that little extra to set it apart (except for the cas and acting) from the others out there.There is a fair anount of cursing including the F&#8230;word here and there, but nothing excessive.  There were two scenes of rape (fully clothed) of the daughter and a young woman and there were a few scenes of violence including the rape scenes, court room and home invasion. There was one scene of partial nudity without showing breasts, buttocks or genitals and there was some alcohol use in a casual setting.4+ stars for performances and casting, but 3+ stars overall for story.",3,"""YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN MAMA'S GIRL AWAY""",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,2775,"['EFAE', 'short', 'type', 'movie', 'most', 'anyway', 'hate', 'love', 'watch', 'brand', 'justice', 'out', 'evil', 'doer.The', 'story', 'rape', 'killing', '17', 'yo', 'Julie', 'McCann', 'Olivia', 'Burnette', 'daughter/stepdaughter', 'Karen', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'Mack', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Robert', 'Doob', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'legal', 'systems', 'failure', 'convict', 'lead', 'detective', 'Sgt', 'Denillo', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'family', 'have', 'worries', 'Doob', 'will', 'be', 'convicted', 'evidence', 'have', 'him.Mack', 'Karen', 'join', 'support', 'group', 'fellow', 'families', 'friends', 'murdered', 'loved', 'ones', 'Mack', 'be', 'dealing', 'loss', 'fairly', 'well', 'Karen', 'emotions', 'are', 'simmering', 'boil', 'one', 'meetings', 'Karen', 'coulpe', 'Sidney', 'Hughes', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'discussing', 'killing', 'man', 'responsible', 'childs', 'murder', 'Karen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'loss', 'will', 'let', 'go', 'fact', 'Doob', 'walked', 'away', 'being', 'held', 'accountable', 'Julie', 'rape/murder', 'legal', 'system', 'being', 'assured', 'case', 'was', 'sure', 'conviction.The', 'story/plot', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'means', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'TV/Movies', 'made', 'one', 'release', '1996.The', 'thing', 'movie', 'appart', 'legions', 'other', 'stories', 'was', 'cast', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'direction', 'other', 'factors', 'help', 'separate', 'movie', 'others', 'locations', 'cinematography', 'help', 'tell', 'story.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'hindered', 'story', 'somewhat', 'overtly', 'used', 'cliches', 'describing', 'Doob', 'personality', 'throwing', 'cigarette', 'ground', 'when', 'ask', 'smoke', 'homeless', 'lady', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', 'abusing', 'dog', 'implied', 'favorite', 'was', 'choice', 'vehicles', 'US', 'Mail', 'delivery', 'jeep', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'are', 'pretty', 'transparent', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'early', 'on.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'over', 'use', 'cliches', 'lack', 'really', 'creative', 'writing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'raise', 'production', 'already', 'flooded', 'market', 'revenge', 'genre', 'movies', 'movie', 'time', 'watch', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'little', 'extra', 'set', 'apart', 'cas', 'acting', 'others', 'out', 'there.There', 'fair', 'anount', 'cursing', 'including', 'F', '8230', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'excessive', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'rape', 'fully', 'clothed', 'daughter', 'young', 'woman', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'violence', 'including', 'rape', 'scenes', 'court', 'room', 'home', 'invasion', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'partial', 'nudity', 'showing', 'breasts', 'buttocks', 'genitals', 'was', 'alcohol', 'use', 'casual', 'setting.4+', 'stars', 'performances', 'casting', '3+', 'stars', 'overall', 'story']",N/A

Though the opening is brilliant, and Field's performance is flawless, it's the morally simplistic storytelling that really grates. What's missing - what's shunted aside presumably in the interests of the thriller mode - is surely the most interesting part of this kind of story: the impact of senseless murder on the lives of those left behind.

688583,A3GN5N99RJ62H3,B00005Y1UV,vincent r meglis,"[9, 10]","Wow, Kiefer Sutherland delivers one of the most powerful performances ever to come to the big screen.  I always loved Kiefer's films, and always thought he played a great villan.  Freeway, A Time To Kill, and even in A Few Good Men he played a nasty s.o.b., but never had I seen him this downright horrible.  He is such a brilliant actor and can play a wide range of characters(as we have seen in the tv show 24).  Kiefer plays Robert Doob in the film Eye For An Eye, a white trash serial rapist who prays on women of all ages.  Doob is a truely evil person and has no conscience what so ever, which makes him all the more scary.  The movie opens with us being introduced to the McCann family.  Karen(Sally Field) and Mack(Ed Harris) live in a big house with their two daughters Julie(Olivia Burnette) and Ashley.  They are getting the house ready for Ashley's birthday party.  Julie is left alone in the house and is putting up decorations, when Karen calls.  Karen tells her that she is going to be late because she is stuck in traffic.  Then the doorbell rings, and Julie tells her mom to hold on and opens the door.  The scene that follows is quite upsetting, and is where we are introduced to Robert Doob.  Doob brutally attacks Julie while Karen is still on the phone and can hear everything.  The physical violence isn't that bad since the scene jumps around a lot, but the emotional tension is unbearable.  I think that the helpless feeling Karen experiences as she runs up to every car around her to ask for help, and for someone to call the police, is what hits us the hardest.  The vision of the balloons floating away from inside Karens car, out the open door, then to the sky, while Doob is raping and killing the helpless girl is, in my opinion, a subliminal reference to the end of innocence and the loss of life.  It is something that you won't soon forget.  The story moves foward to an investigation of the crime by Det. Denillo(Joe Mantegna), as Karen and Max try to deal with what has happened.  The Det. calls them one morning and tells them they have a suspect in custody, Robert Doob.  But when he goes to trial, he is dismissed on an error of the state.  But before he leaves the courtroom, he assures the McCann's that he is definately responsable by mimicing their daughter's stutter saying, sasasasa...sorry.  After that, Karen becomes obsessed with catching him in another crime so he could finally be brought to justice.  She begins to follow him, and at one point see's him peeping on a lady and urinating on her lawn.  She goes to the Det. to tell him that they have to pick this guy up, but the Det. tells her to stay away from Robert Doob and that there is nothing they can do right now.  Karen then seeks help from a couple men at her counciling sessions.  They are a vigilante group that takes justice into their own hands, when the system fails to.  They teach Karen to shoot a gun and set up the hit for her, but she has to pull the trigger herself.  At first she says she can do it, but then she backs out when she finds out that a friend of hers at the meetings is really a undercover FBI agent investigating vigilante activity.  Then she finds out that Robert Doob has been talking to her other daughter Ashley.  She goes to his apartment to send a message and finds a ceramic cookie that Ashley had made at school in his dresser.  So she trashes his apartment in an attempt to lure him to her house for a final showdown.  I won't tell you how the movie ends, you have to see it for yourself.  I didn't mention Ed Harris much because he really has a small role in the film, although he does a great job with the parts he has.  Everyone in this movie is excellent, even Beverly D'Angelo who plays Dolly Green, Karen's friend at her job, is great.
