I most always work out at home and aim to complete at least 30 minutes of yoga/pilates-type workout, combined with a true cardio/strength workout. This DVD is great for the daily yoga/pilates stretching & toning mix. The description boasts that it will provide a cardio workout as well, but as a consistent intermediate exerciser, I wouldn't really agree.The DVD is 45 minutes long and while you will work up a bit of a sweat, it is a bit too slow-paced to truly get you breathing hard. But - it is absolutely perfect for delivering the ""long & lean"" toning that Ellen Barrett is known for. Your thighs get a great work-out with a lot of standing work, especially your inner thighs with a lot of what she calls ""breathing plies"".As always, Ellen Barrett is a great, non-annoying instructor who cues perfectly without an excess of praise or unnecessary motivational speeches, which tend to appear too often on fitness DVDs.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to incorporate yoga/stretching into their routine, but wants something faster-paced & results-driven than the standard Hatha/Ivengar practices on the market.",5,Great addition to your Mind-Body fitness collection!,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1209,"['definitely', 'turned', 'one', 'favorite', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'most', 'always', 'work', 'out', 'home', 'aim', 'complete', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'yoga/pilates-type', 'workout', 'combined', 'true', 'cardio/strength', 'workout', 'DVD', 'great', 'daily', 'yoga/pilates', 'stretching', 'toning', 'mix', 'description', 'will', 'provide', 'cardio', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'consistent', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'agree.The', 'DVD', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'will', 'work', 'up', 'bit', 'sweat', 'bit', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'truly', 'get', 'breathing', 'hard', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'delivering', 'long', 'lean', 'toning', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'known', 'thighs', 'get', 'great', 'work-out', 'lot', 'standing', 'work', 'especially', 'inner', 'thighs', 'lot', 'what', 'breathing', 'plies', '.As', 'always', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'great', 'non-annoying', 'instructor', 'who', 'perfectly', 'excess', 'praise', 'unnecessary', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'tend', 'appear', 'too', 'often', 'fitness', 'DVDs.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'incorporate', 'yoga/stretching', 'routine', 'something', 'faster-paced', 'results-driven', 'standard', 'Hatha/Ivengar', 'practices', 'market']",Yogini Workout

1165719,A1YMZC2G7XCB9L,B001AGZJ0E,H. Gardner,"[71, 73]","Just like Ellen Barrett's other two Buff Girl releases, this is a barefoot mat workout that lasts approximately forty-five minutes and will give you a thorough workout for your time spent.  The video is shot inside The Studio, Ellen's workout space, which means the background is fairly boring.  The moves are demonstrated by Ellen and two assistants, one of whom demonstrates modifications of the moves.I particularly like Ellen Barrett as an instructor, and own almost all of her videos.  Her cueing is excellent and easy to follow, she has a pleasant and calm voice, and she gives you encouragement and motivation to keep going when the going gets tough.  She also has the type of lean, dancer-like (very feminine) body that I am working toward rather than a chiseled or muscular body like many other fitness instructors.As you can probably tell from the title, this particular workout is more yoga oriented than her other Buff Girl Fitness videos (which involve more pilates), and includes poses that should be familiar to anyone with even the most basic yoga background:  downward facing dog, Warrior I and II, etc.  Some knowledge of basic yoga positions would be helpful when trying this video, but is not required in order to follow the exercises and get a good workout.  The poses here are relatively simple to follow, and even people who are inflexible and/or out of shape (like me) should be able to follow along.  One caveat:  There were more inverted poses in this workout than what I am generally used to doing, which left me a little light-headed afterwards.The workout itself is not simply a yoga workout either, but incorporates stretching, toning, pilates posture and an emphasis on flexibility.  The exercises, including the yoga poses, include unique twists by the instructor to make them more effective and interesting.  The first thirty minutes of exercise are standing, and the last fifteen are spent on the floor.  In particular, this workout is geared toward toning and strengthening the female trouble areas of the abs, thighs, and hips.In short, I can't say enough good things about Ellen Barrett.  As an advanced beginner/intermediate exerciser, I recommend this workout highly to any level of exerciser, and believe you will find it to be both challenging and invigorating, no matter what your fitness level.

Ellen stretches you and works you at the same time, I really felt the area she was working. So many other videos I hear... ""do you feel that burn in your legs"" and often I do not, not the case with this video.

Yoga normally really bores me and I have a hard time continuing but this takes it to a new level where I am not counting the minutes until it is over.  I have Ellens Fusion Fat burning and I can testify that these are not for the faint of heart.  I have worked out most of my life and am in great shape so its really saying something when I say that these workouts have me in a puddle of sweat.  The music is just great and soothing which helps you concentrate on the moves and makes you feel centered.  I feel really calm and at peace when I do these workouts and to me that is worthwhile to have such good feelings.  I highly recommend this.  I thought I would comment again on this after using it for a while and I have to say that since using this and Fat Burning Fusion I am seeing phenomonal toning in my upper thighs, saddle bags, buttocks and area under buttocks.  I have always been fit but these areas were hard for me to perfect and I cannot believe how well I am doing and also sleeoing better!",5,Amazing!,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1129,"['have', 'just', 'started', 'working', 'out', 'am', 'finding', 'amazing', 'very', 'graceful', 'fluid', 'whilst', 'kicking', 'butt', 'Yoga', 'normally', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'continuing', 'new', 'level', 'where', 'am', 'not', 'counting', 'minutes', 'have', 'Ellens', 'Fusion', 'Fat', 'burning', 'can', 'testify', 'are', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'most', 'life', 'am', 'great', 'shape', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'when', 'say', 'workouts', 'have', 'puddle', 'sweat', 'music', 'just', 'great', 'soothing', 'concentrate', 'moves', 'feel', 'centered', 'feel', 'really', 'calm', 'peace', 'when', 'do', 'workouts', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'feelings', 'highly', 'recommend', 'thought', 'would', 'comment', 'again', 'using', 'while', 'have', 'say', 'using', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Fusion', 'am', 'seeing', 'phenomonal', 'toning', 'upper', 'thighs', 'saddle', 'bags', 'buttocks', 'area', 'buttocks', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fit', 'areas', 'were', 'hard', 'perfect', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'well', 'am', 'doing', 'also', 'sleeoing', 'better']",Yogini Workout

This is one of the very best exercise videos I have ever owned, and I really enjoy doing it:  the moves feel good, but they really push you, especially if you are body-conscious (making the whole body participate, instead of just 'going through the motions'). Honestly you just cannot go wrong with this video.  There are modifications for the less-able exerciser (but I tend to go the other way, doing leg-raises with no fingers on the mat, for example), but most people will find that the challenge Ellen provides is just about right, especially as they continually return to the workout.
