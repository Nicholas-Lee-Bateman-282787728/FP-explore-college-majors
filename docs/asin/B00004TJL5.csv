But if you're like me, and  you love horribly made, but entertaining films, this ones for you. I'm  sorry to say I had a great time watching this, basically because I love  seeing bad films and having a great time laughing at them. But if you want  to see a good horror film, or some good acting, please, please, do not  watch this. You will be very disapointed. I just have to note I don't know  where in the hell Full Moon finds these actors.",2,terrible but enjoyable,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,562,"['Personally', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'being', 'terrible', 'actually', 'very', 'frustrating', 'watch', ""'re"", 'love', 'horribly', 'made', 'entertaining', 'films', 'ones', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'basically', 'love', 'seeing', 'bad', 'films', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'laughing', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'please', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disapointed', 'just', 'have', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'hell', 'Full', 'Moon', 'actors']",N/A

Depending on how long you've been watching their movies or how familiar you are with the company, then you'd also know that while their earlier stuff was just awesome (Puppet Master,Subspecies) they also have some clunkers in their collections. The fun of Full Moon is that even when the stuff is bad by their standards, it is usually so bad that it is good. Sideshow manages to lie smack in the middle of the Full Moon schlock scale, which is part of what made it a little disappointing.Sideshow follows a group of teens that decide to attend a local freak show, hoping for some fun & laughs. They all get their fortunes told, each one having ominous undertones. As the night goes on & the teens get an all access pass into the sideshow, the group begins to realize that this show needs a few new exhibits- THEM!This isn't the worst I've seen from Full Moon, but it isn't the best. It's good enough that I got a copy of it & I've watched it more than once. It's just not something that I've watched as much as the other stuff they've put out. When I realized that this was put out by the producer of the Puppet Master series (my favorite of all the Full Moon films), I got even more disappointed.What makes this worth watching? The story line is pretty decent & it has the fabulous Phil Fondacaro (the sinister sideshow ringmaster) in it- he's pretty much the sole reason I purchased this movie at all. He's never played a role where he isn't entertaining, with this movie being no exception. If Linnea Quigley is a scream king, then Fondacaro is very much a scream king.Where does the movie go wrong? The sideshow freaks are a little farfetched, but still entertaining. It's the cast aside from Fondacaro that is just lacking. I'm used the whole ""18 going on 30"" thing in horror movies, so I'm not going to entirely fault them on that. It's just that at times they all seemed to just sleepwalk through their roles, which made for scenes that just lagged. Overall it is a fun enough film, but when the movie drags you notice it.I'm kind of torn between recommending this for a purchase or not. It is definitely worth a rental if you like the schlocky stuff, but for many it might be only worth a rental. If you've never seen a Full Moon picture before, then I don't recommend that you start with this one. Start with Subspecies or Puppet Master- those are Full Moon at it's best.",3,Schlocky fun!,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2481,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'company', 'Full', 'Moon', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'type', 'stuff', 'expect', 'Depending', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'how', 'familiar', 'are', 'company', 'then', ""'d"", 'also', 'know', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'was', 'just', 'awesome', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'Subspecies', 'also', 'have', 'clunkers', 'collections', 'fun', 'Full', 'Moon', 'even', 'when', 'stuff', 'bad', 'standards', 'usually', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'Sideshow', 'lie', 'smack', 'middle', 'Full', 'Moon', 'schlock', 'scale', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'little', 'disappointing.Sideshow', 'group', 'teens', 'decide', 'attend', 'local', 'freak', 'show', 'hoping', 'fun', 'laughs', 'get', 'fortunes', 'told', 'one', 'having', 'ominous', 'undertones', 'night', 'teens', 'get', 'access', 'pass', 'sideshow', 'group', 'realize', 'show', 'few', 'new', 'exhibits-', 'THEM', ""n't"", 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Full', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'best', 'good', 'enough', 'got', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'just', 'not', 'something', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'put', 'out', 'When', 'realized', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'producer', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'favorite', 'Full', 'Moon', 'films', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed.What', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'line', 'pretty', 'decent', 'fabulous', 'Phil', 'Fondacaro', 'sinister', 'sideshow', 'ringmaster', 'it-', 'pretty', 'much', 'sole', 'reason', 'purchased', 'movie', 'never', 'played', 'role', 'where', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'movie', 'being', 'exception', 'Linnea', 'Quigley', 'scream', 'king', 'then', 'Fondacaro', 'very', 'much', 'scream', 'king.Where', 'movie', 'go', 'wrong', 'sideshow', 'freaks', 'are', 'little', 'farfetched', 'still', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'aside', 'Fondacaro', 'just', 'lacking', ""'m"", 'used', 'whole', '18', 'going', '30', 'thing', 'horror', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'entirely', 'fault', 'just', 'times', 'seemed', 'just', 'sleepwalk', 'roles', 'made', 'scenes', 'just', 'lagged', 'Overall', 'fun', 'enough', 'film', 'when', 'movie', 'notice', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'kind', 'torn', 'recommending', 'purchase', 'not', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'like', 'schlocky', 'stuff', 'many', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'rental', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Full', 'Moon', 'picture', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'start', 'one', 'Start', 'Subspecies', 'Puppet', 'Master-', 'are', 'Full', 'Moon', 'best']",N/A
550582,A1IRBYOY6E72NT,B00004TJL5,Joshua S. Johnson,"[5, 6]","I gave this film a rating of two out of five stars. I think the idea of a circus sideshow, complete with grotesque freaks is a terribly wonderful idea. Although there are fewer and fewer traveling circus' displaying freaks these days, the topic is wide open for horror interpretations. I enjoyed a couple of the characters, but thought that overall this film could have been given a little more life with better writing and directing. This film should have had a grittier atmosphere and more gore. For a superior film about traveling circuses, I would recommend Something Wicked This Way Comes. I gave this film two stars out out five, although ti was somewhat closer too a 1.5 on a five star scale.

He has been at I guess doing it for a long time and does a pretty good job at it. Some of the effects are not real good but they are different. Not great acting but I've seen oscar winning movies with worse.
