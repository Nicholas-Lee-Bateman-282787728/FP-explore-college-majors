682243,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00005TPKY,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 1]","Initially when I watched this series in it's fansub form, I was only mildly intrigued. I'd had it recommended by a online friend of mine & decided to give it a try for the first 2-3 volumes. While I thought it was cute, I immediately dismissed it after a few episodes as a cutesy anime that I'd complete if I had the time. A few weeks later I was looking for something new to watch & picked the episodes back up to view. Boy was I glad that I did! I immediately became enthralled with the series & collected the rest of the episodes. When I discovered that the series was coming to DVD, I immediately preordered my copy of the first volume.The story surrounds a cute little girl Noelle who is discovered in a very fanservicey fashion by plain everyman Yuusuke. After some initial confusion, she immediately proclaims that she's his bride & soon after declares that she'll be an angel just for him. Along for the ride is her very eccentric & colorful family, some of which are supportive of her goal, some who are not. Meanwhile, a very mysterious boy and interesting enemy both watch her progress with interest.The show is very cutesy & could initially be mistaken for just a children's show (which is what I did at first). However, as the plot moves along, the more adult elements of the show begin to appear in the last few story arcs (which unfortunately never made it to dvd).  Sadly, due to the terrible marketing & distribution, the final episodes are unavailable in any official format in the US.Would I recommend this? Yes, but only if you are into very strange, cute, or quirky animes. Some won't be willing to give it the chance (assuming that this just isn't their type of anime to begin with). I would somewhat recommend it to older children, but only if the parents watch it first. The series is harmless, but full of semi-risque jokes & fanservice.",5,Worth a second look...,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1862,"['Initially', 'when', 'watched', 'series', 'fansub', 'form', 'was', 'only', 'mildly', 'intrigued', ""'d"", 'had', 'recommended', 'online', 'friend', 'mine', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'first', '2-3', 'volumes', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'immediately', 'dismissed', 'few', 'episodes', 'cutesy', 'anime', ""'d"", 'complete', 'had', 'time', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'watch', 'picked', 'episodes', 'back', 'view', 'Boy', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'immediately', 'became', 'enthralled', 'series', 'collected', 'rest', 'episodes', 'When', 'discovered', 'series', 'was', 'coming', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'preordered', 'copy', 'first', 'volume.The', 'story', 'cute', 'little', 'girl', 'Noelle', 'who', 'discovered', 'very', 'fanservicey', 'fashion', 'plain', 'everyman', 'Yuusuke', 'initial', 'confusion', 'immediately', 'bride', 'soon', 'declares', ""'ll"", 'be', 'angel', 'just', 'ride', 'very', 'eccentric', 'colorful', 'family', 'are', 'supportive', 'goal', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Meanwhile', 'very', 'mysterious', 'boy', 'interesting', 'enemy', 'watch', 'progress', 'interest.The', 'show', 'very', 'cutesy', 'could', 'initially', 'be', 'mistaken', 'just', 'children', 'show', 'what', 'did', 'first', 'However', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'more', 'adult', 'elements', 'show', 'begin', 'appear', 'last', 'few', 'story', 'arcs', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'made', 'dvd', 'Sadly', 'due', 'terrible', 'marketing', 'distribution', 'final', 'episodes', 'are', 'unavailable', 'official', 'format', 'US.Would', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'only', 'are', 'very', 'strange', 'cute', 'quirky', 'animes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'assuming', 'just', ""n't"", 'type', 'anime', 'begin', 'would', 'somewhat', 'recommend', 'older', 'children', 'only', 'parents', 'watch', 'first', 'series', 'harmless', 'full', 'semi-risque', 'jokes', 'fanservice']",N/A
682244,AV3DGOXMP4NAV,B00005TPKY,hotarutomoe,"[2, 2]","First of all, this DVD is very cute, the opening theme song is very catchy, and the english dub voices are great. I enjoyed this DVD, and when volume 2 comes out, I'm gonna buy it. It all starts when Yuusuke starts living on his own. On his way to school, he find a naked Noelle sleeping in the forest. When he comes home, he finds out that Noelle's family has come from the monster world to live with him! Everybody keeps calling Yuusuke Noelle's &quot;husband&quot; because he accidentally kissed her. All this is getting to be too much for poor Yuusuke. Noelle wants to be an angel just for Yuusuke, but there are many things required. This dvd cotains the first 5 episodes:&quot;Kisses Mean I like you, I think,&quot; &quot;Patched Up Love is Okay with Me!&quot;, &quot;Hug Me, Squeeze Me,&quot; &quot;Precious Things are.....Precious!&quot;, and &quot;Not There, But Still There.&quot; This series would be great for children ages 8 and up!",5,"I'm Gonna Be An Angel For you, Yuusuke!",1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,945,"['First', 'all', 'DVD', 'very', 'cute', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'very', 'catchy', 'english', 'dub', 'voices', 'are', 'great', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'when', 'volume', '2', 'out', ""'m"", 'gon', 'buy', 'when', 'Yuusuke', 'living', 'own', 'way', 'school', 'naked', 'Noelle', 'sleeping', 'forest', 'When', 'home', 'out', 'Noelle', 'family', 'come', 'monster', 'world', 'live', 'Everybody', 'calling', 'Yuusuke', 'Noelle', 'quot', 'husband', 'quot', 'accidentally', 'kissed', 'getting', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'poor', 'Yuusuke', 'Noelle', 'be', 'angel', 'just', 'Yuusuke', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'required', 'dvd', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Kisses', 'Mean', 'think', 'quot', 'quot', 'Patched', 'Up', 'Love', 'Okay', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hug', 'Me', 'Squeeze', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Precious', 'Things', 'are', '..Precious', 'quot', 'quot', 'Not', 'Still', 'There.', 'quot', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'children', 'ages', '8', 'up']",N/A

Knox ""QuackJak""","[12, 13]","I saw this at the AnimeExpo in New York recently, and bought it soon after.The plot (understand, Japanese cartoons sometime have quirky and erratic plots)is: A stork carrying a new angel is attacked, and the angel inside splits into 3 parts. We won't know what happened to the other 2 parts for a while, but one apparently ends up in the demon world and raised by the Munsters, for want of a better description.A teenage boy whose parents have left him in Japan while they work overseas is enjoying his first day of independance when he comes across a girl naked in the park; this girl is Noelle, one of the pieces of the complete angel. She immediately falls for Yu-ske and declares him her husband. He considers her nuts and runs away to school, where she ends up at later as a student.Later, when Yu-ske rides his bike home, he finds the Munsters have re-decorated his house (did they ever), and Noelle is part of this family. He's introduced to them as her future husband, and they inform him they're moving in, having left the demon world. Strange stuff, and not just the obvious. The family has dances for practically every occasion.Meanwhile, there's an evil...Harliquin that desires Noelle because she's imperfect (he has a thing for imperfection) and stops at nothing to have her in his possession. Of course, this involves numerous kidnap attempts by his minions and the family's battles against them. Again, funny and wierd.I'm glossing over a LOT of stuff, but that's the beauty of Anime; so much goes on in just 1 episode you look at it more than once.The disc comes with both the original Japanese and English dubbed. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the better dubbing efforts by far, sticking very close to the original translation. Moreover, Noelle's voice actress for English is a dead ringer for the Japanese one, which is great.The animation is clean and smooth, with abstraction only when the story calls for it.This series is great for kids 8 and up; just a tad risque in some places, but always in good taste and never overt. Parents who are already into similar things will enjoy the quirkiness.Definately worth purchasing.",4,Great Title For New Viewers of Anime,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,2151,"['saw', 'AnimeExpo', 'New', 'York', 'recently', 'bought', 'soon', 'after.The', 'plot', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'cartoons', 'sometime', 'have', 'quirky', 'erratic', 'plots', 'stork', 'carrying', 'new', 'angel', 'attacked', 'angel', 'splits', '3', 'parts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'other', '2', 'parts', 'while', 'one', 'apparently', 'up', 'demon', 'world', 'raised', 'Munsters', 'want', 'better', 'description.A', 'teenage', 'boy', 'parents', 'have', 'left', 'Japan', 'work', 'overseas', 'enjoying', 'first', 'day', 'independance', 'when', 'girl', 'naked', 'park', 'girl', 'Noelle', 'one', 'pieces', 'complete', 'angel', 'immediately', 'Yu-ske', 'husband', 'nuts', 'away', 'school', 'where', 'up', 'later', 'student.Later', 'when', 'Yu-ske', 'bike', 'home', 'Munsters', 'have', 're-decorated', 'house', 'did', 'ever', 'Noelle', 'part', 'family', 'introduced', 'future', 'husband', 'inform', ""'re"", 'moving', 'having', 'left', 'demon', 'world', 'Strange', 'stuff', 'not', 'just', 'obvious', 'family', 'dances', 'practically', 'occasion.Meanwhile', 'evil', 'Harliquin', 'Noelle', 'imperfect', 'thing', 'imperfection', 'nothing', 'have', 'possession', 'course', 'numerous', 'kidnap', 'attempts', 'minions', 'family', 'battles', 'Again', 'funny', 'wierd.I', ""'m"", 'glossing', 'over', 'LOT', 'stuff', 'beauty', 'Anime', 'so', 'much', 'just', '1', 'episode', 'look', 'more', 'once.The', 'disc', 'original', 'Japanese', 'English', 'dubbed', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'better', 'dubbing', 'efforts', 'far', 'sticking', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'translation', 'Moreover', 'Noelle', 'voice', 'actress', 'English', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Japanese', 'one', 'great.The', 'animation', 'clean', 'smooth', 'abstraction', 'only', 'when', 'story', 'it.This', 'series', 'great', 'kids', '8', 'up', 'just', 'tad', 'risque', 'places', 'always', 'good', 'taste', 'never', 'overt', 'Parents', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'similar', 'things', 'will', 'enjoy', 'quirkiness.Definately', 'worth', 'purchasing']",N/A
682246,A2YOA7S4KLXEQU,B00005TPKY,"Lee Jackson ""ljfnord""","[30, 32]","This is an unbelievably incredible series which has yet to really receive its due from American anime fans. The original Japanese title is &quot;Tenshi ni Narumon!&quot;, which roughly translates to, &quot;I'm Gonna Be an Angel!&quot; The title is appropriate, but at the same time pretty deceptive. This series is definitely NOT your run-of-the-mill cutesy kid anime. While it does have more than its share of kawaii elements, it also has a very deep and very dark subplot which is foreshadowed in the opening seconds of the first epsiode. This darkness erupts in the middle episodes, and it practically explodes in the final story arc.Describing the show is a little tricky. It features a high school boy named Yuusuke and a girl named Noelle, who just happens to wear a halo. As the series starts, Yuusuke is on his first day of living by himself, and he's quite happy about his freedom. On his first day alone, and on the way to school that morning, no less, he &quot;stumbles&quot; across Noelle in the woods (okay, he falls off of a bank and lands on her). She is naked and unconscious, for reasons that are too complicated to explain. Suffice it to say that when Yuusuke lands on her, he accidentally kisses her, and this of course wakes her up. She immediately assumes that Yuusuke is now her husband (so will her family - more on that later). Yuusuke runs away in a blind fear, but his problems have just begun.  So has the series, in fact - all of this takes place in just the opening minutes of the first episode!By the end of the first episode, we learn that Noelle is now a student in Yuusuke's class, and that her &quot;family&quot; has moved themselves (and their entire house!) to the spot where Yuusuke's house had been. We also learn that Yuusuke has a crush on another girl (Natsumi), even though she won't spare him the time of day because of several unfortunate and embarrassing incidents. It is during his attempt to apologize for one such incident that we hear Yuusuke compare Natsumi to an angel: Noelle, upon overhearing this, later pledges to become an angel for Yuusuke.  The series centers upon this pledge and how everyone handles the consequences it creates.The dramatic side of the series is excellently offset by its comedic side. By far, the funniest part of the show involves Noelle's &quot;family.&quot; They're from the &quot;Demon World,&quot; and they can only be described as a cross between The Munsters, Bewitched, and a Fisher-Price commercial. The father is especially funny in the original Japanese series: he's an enormous Frankenstein's monster who wears glasses and a business suit, and he speaks in an *extremely* polite Japanese dialect. The mother and grandmother are witches, the brother is a vampire, the little sister is a mad scientist in training, and the big sister is invisible. The whole family is extremely naive as to the ways of the &quot;human world,&quot; which invariably results in trouble for all (usually at the expense of the humans involved). As strange as these characters may seem, they're mild when compared to the &quot;villains&quot; of the show. All of the characters are eventually developed to a degree that you normally won't see in a series like this, and none of them (especially the &quot;villains&quot;) are what they would at first seem to be.The first 7 or 8 episodes (out of 26 total) are heavily laden with slapstick, but like I mentioned earlier there is a very deep plot that stirs slowly throughout. There are two major story arcs later on in the series that must be seen to be believed: one happens right in the middle, and another that spans the last 5 episodes. The ending arc is especially impressive, and is in fact the only piece of anime that has ever moved me emotionally. Seriously - it is REALLY that good.In short, this is a series that you can't afford to miss, and one that is bound to go down as a classic of the genre. Incredibly good stuff, and a must have for any serious anime fan.",5,An Incredible Series,1008201600,"12 13, 2001",2001,3988,"['unbelievably', 'incredible', 'series', 'yet', 'really', 'receive', 'due', 'American', 'anime', 'fans', 'original', 'Japanese', 'title', 'quot', 'Tenshi', 'ni', 'Narumon', 'quot', 'roughly', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'na', 'Be', 'Angel', 'quot', 'title', 'appropriate', 'same', 'time', 'pretty', 'deceptive', 'series', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'run-of-the-mill', 'cutesy', 'kid', 'anime', 'have', 'more', 'share', 'kawaii', 'elements', 'also', 'very', 'deep', 'very', 'dark', 'subplot', 'foreshadowed', 'opening', 'seconds', 'first', 'epsiode', 'darkness', 'middle', 'episodes', 'practically', 'final', 'story', 'arc.Describing', 'show', 'little', 'tricky', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'named', 'Yuusuke', 'girl', 'named', 'Noelle', 'who', 'just', 'wear', 'halo', 'series', 'Yuusuke', 'first', 'day', 'living', 'quite', 'happy', 'freedom', 'first', 'day', 'alone', 'way', 'school', 'morning', 'less', 'quot', 'stumbles', 'quot', 'Noelle', 'woods', 'okay', 'bank', 'naked', 'unconscious', 'reasons', 'are', 'too', 'complicated', 'explain', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'Yuusuke', 'accidentally', 'course', 'wakes', 'up', 'immediately', 'Yuusuke', 'now', 'husband', 'so', 'will', 'family', 'more', 'later', 'Yuusuke', 'away', 'blind', 'fear', 'problems', 'have', 'just', 'begun', 'So', 'series', 'fact', 'place', 'just', 'opening', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'learn', 'Noelle', 'now', 'student', 'Yuusuke', 'class', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', 'moved', 'entire', 'house', 'spot', 'where', 'Yuusuke', 'house', 'had', 'been', 'also', 'learn', 'Yuusuke', 'crush', 'girl', 'Natsumi', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spare', 'time', 'day', 'several', 'unfortunate', 'embarrassing', 'incidents', 'attempt', 'apologize', 'one', 'such', 'incident', 'hear', 'Yuusuke', 'compare', 'Natsumi', 'angel', 'Noelle', 'overhearing', 'later', 'become', 'angel', 'Yuusuke', 'series', 'pledge', 'how', 'everyone', 'consequences', 'dramatic', 'side', 'series', 'excellently', 'offset', 'comedic', 'side', 'far', 'funniest', 'part', 'show', 'Noelle', 'quot', 'quot', ""'re"", 'quot', 'Demon', 'World', 'quot', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'cross', 'Munsters', 'Bewitched', 'Fisher-Price', 'commercial', 'father', 'especially', 'funny', 'original', 'Japanese', 'series', 'enormous', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'who', 'glasses', 'business', 'suit', '*extremely*', 'polite', 'Japanese', 'dialect', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'are', 'witches', 'brother', 'vampire', 'little', 'sister', 'mad', 'scientist', 'training', 'big', 'sister', 'invisible', 'whole', 'family', 'extremely', 'naive', 'ways', 'quot', 'human', 'world', 'quot', 'invariably', 'results', 'trouble', 'usually', 'expense', 'humans', 'involved', 'strange', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', ""'re"", 'mild', 'when', 'compared', 'quot', 'quot', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'eventually', 'developed', 'degree', 'normally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'series', 'none', 'especially', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'first', 'seem', 'be.The', 'first', '7', '8', 'episodes', '26', 'total', 'are', 'heavily', 'laden', 'slapstick', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'very', 'deep', 'plot', 'slowly', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'story', 'arcs', 'later', 'series', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'one', 'right', 'middle', 'last', '5', 'episodes', 'ending', 'arc', 'especially', 'impressive', 'fact', 'only', 'piece', 'anime', 'ever', 'moved', 'emotionally', 'Seriously', 'REALLY', 'good.In', 'short', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'miss', 'one', 'bound', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'genre', 'Incredibly', 'good', 'stuff', 'must', 'have', 'serious', 'anime', 'fan']",N/A
