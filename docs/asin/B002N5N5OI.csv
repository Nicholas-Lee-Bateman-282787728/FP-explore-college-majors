The stories are just as heart-wrenching as they have always been, and this one delves a bit more into the personal lives of the detectives, particularly Stabler.  Mischa Barton makes a nice getaway from spoiled rich girl Marissa as a young and overwhelmed mother.The one weakness of the season deals with the ADA.  Alex Cabot is back.  She's sort of like a cockroach, she just won't die!  First she leaves then she comes back and then leaves and now she's back again!  The show has struggled to find a decent ADA since Casey Novak was disbarred two seasons ago.  Just as we're getting comfortable with Cabot again, she decides all of a sudden that she wants to go prosecute bad guys in Africa.  Ummmm, what?  Okay, so she's gone again, and they bring in Sharon Stone.  Sharon Stone is just painful to watch.  She's just awful.  It's hard to believe this is the same actress who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Casino.

1279364,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B002N5N5OI,Lisa Siegel,"[8, 9]","This has been, for more than a decade now, my favorite show on television.  The stories are powerful and they stick with you.  Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni are the heart of this show.  I honestly don't think the show would do as well without them.  I would, however, like to see more of Munch and Fin.  They seem to have sort of dropped into the background and are only in a few scenes of each episode.  I remember earlier seasons when there would be an episode or two (or more) when they were the central characters.The addition of Christine Lahti for the first few episodes was great.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like her, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm glad she didn't stick around for the entire season though.  It was great to see Stephanie March back for several episodes.  I wish she was back for good, but the way in which she was written out this time (unlike last time when she was put into the witness protection program) was very well done.  Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite seasons of the show.Also, even though the price is (or was...not sure if the current price is what it originally was) a little high, at least the season was released fairly quickly after the season aired on TV.  I remember when the show first went on DVD, it wasn't until the 5th season was aired.  And even then season 1 wasn't released first.

1279367,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B002N5N5OI,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","After eleven seasons it's hard to write some original content in this review.  I could go over the characters again, the episodes, and what SVU is really all about, but those who are already fans (which you must be if you're looking at season eleven) will already know everything that I put down here.  Still, this is a good series, and this particular season had a few little gems.Law and Order SVU deals with the special crimes.  The crimes that make your stomach turn and a tear come out of your eye because they are so brutal and heartbreaking.  In this season we have a couple of episodes that are especially heartbreaking.  ""Anchor"" is said because it involves children, but it also handles the topic of immigration, which is a conflicting one for a lot of people.  ""Quickie"" I sympathized with the grandfather of the suspect and it was a hard one to watch as a result.  Again in this season there is kind of a cliffhanger ending involving the medical examiner.  But it wasn't quite as gut wrenching as the tenth season's cliffhanger.I was once again disappointed with how much screentime Belzer and Ice-T get.  They really aren't used that effectively.  Don't get me wrong, I love Meloni and Hargitay, but just to have some fresh faces on the scene now and then would be nice.  Use everybody to their best abilities.  Florek doesn't make as many appearances as Cragan either.  I was also a little less than impressed with the ADA's this season.  When comparing them to March and Neal they just don't relate to the audience as well.  In fact, I find myself wishing that they didn't have more screentime than Belzer and Ice-T and that we stay out of the courtrooms and in the policework areas so we don't have to watch them.  But the way this show runs through ADA's I shouldn't have to contend with them too long.This is a hard show to watch because of all the violence and rape and other traumatizing things.  There is a lot of legwork by the detectives which takes up screen time, but it doesn't mean that there isn't something hard to watch in every episode.  A kind of viewer beware type of thing if hard topics are not what you like to watch.I'm eager to see what the twelfth season brings.  Despite this season having a couple flaws it is still immensely watchable and one of the most popular shows on television.Review by M.

However the price of Year 11 has my love of Law & Order SVU fading fast.  To price Season 11 L&O; SVU so high is just absolutely insane.  It appears the price for this set of DVD's was made somewhere outside of human reality.  The Episodes were pretty good but they were slightly modified retreads of plots we have already seen many times before.  The Alcoholism subject has been worn out in Law & Order SVU please move on is all I can say.  Law & Order SVU Year 11 is proof that the writers are not only running out of creative steam, I think the poor dears are running on half baked fumes.  The plots have few unexpected twists and turns.  The acting is just getting tedious and boring.I just happen to be a real Law & Order Junkie so I am happy I brought this set.  Also I can afford my Law & Order SVU Habit so while the price is crazy., I'll pay for these last few Seasons.  However I won't sit still for these astronomically high prices much longer not even for Law & Order SVU.  Now that the quality of episodes in Year 11 has deteriorated, I don't get the pure rush of excitement I used to get when the L&O; \ SVU stories were fresh, novel and engaging.
