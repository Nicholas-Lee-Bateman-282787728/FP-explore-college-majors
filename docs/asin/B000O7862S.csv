Polar bears stalk his sleeping area.Mountain - Shelter building and fire making at its best.Winter Plane Crash - My favorite. Les fakes a broken arm to reflect a real plane crash situation. He builds a nice shelter from the busted up airplane, and traps rabbits with a snare.Canyonlands - The loneliness of the canyons grates on Les's nerves as he smokes out a living quarters and catches small animals for food.Lost at Sea - Les takes flight in a rubber raft and gets hit by a nasty unexpected storm.I can't wait to see what Les has planned for Season Two.

They're all experienced instructors whom I look up to for inspiration and leadership.But my cover statement says a great deal about the means by which Les Stroud executed his missions - truly surviving. No camera crew, no sound man, no producer. No assistance, no one to work with or with whom he could rely on. No companionship. No stunts. Just him and the situation.After reading critiques that Survivorman is boring, that Les is just showing how to die slower, I would argue that attempting a self-rescue using skills that most people do not have, cannot learn, or cannot successfully attempt is a surer suicide. I would argue that surviving does not mean going gung-ho; charging up, down and thru environments that most average people could not do in a controlled wilderness training course. Surviving means getting back to your loved ones, not earning props from veterans of the special forces.Unlike some other survival-type programs, there is only the truth about Les and his week-long missions. Again, it's not a stunt show.It still amazes me to watch his productions - always stunned one person could do all of that and still deliver an effective presention. This is, in my opinion, the videography equivalent of pitching a baseball, running to home base, and hitting it into play. Crazy incredible stuff.For those who missed Les when his program was on the air - 'Survivorman' drops off one man with odd bits-n-ends to survive a perilous situation for an entire week. Part documentary, part entertainment, part teaching video.Some of the most challenging episodes are often some of the most amusing. Typically, at the start of his week-long expedition, I find myself laughing when he looks into his vagabond 'kit' - materials scrounged and cobbled together, searching for potential survival items. Now, obviously, some of it is set-up for demonstration purposes. But it teaches you to think outside of the box; that sometimes throwaway junk can be repurposed for something that will aid you in an unexpected situation. Nothing is truly 'trash' when you're desperately trying to survive.Example: When he made fire by hitting a rock he found in a stream against a shovel with a piece of char-cloth he made from the skin of a crashed plane - all while it was snowing! That was just about the most bleeping incredible thing I have ever seen. And I'll be bluntly honest: If you told me that were possible - I would've said someone was having fun at your expense. But he did it. Just bleeping amazing. {:-oAnd I love that he pulls away the curtain with the bonus behind-the-scenes episode. No stranger as a student, the DVD contains important and revealing outtakes not included in the show. Including his own need to learn from local specialists before entering into unfamiliar territory; men and women not unlike himself, who regularly face the challenges of living off the land with little resources other than what you carry in your bag of experience. I appreciate his honesty. He doesn't present himself as a global-any-situation-any-time expert, he's a student too. And I really, really respect that.Important Note: Episodes from the Discovery Channel are edited slightly different than the versions offered by Les himself via his website.

Without a camera crew, without any way to get access to outside help, he has to last for seven days in the wild.  And most of the time seems to do a great job of it.But other times he will do something completely unplanned and stupid.  For example, he was on the shore of Latin America, doing OK, but decided to go inland.  He got lost, bitten by every insect alive and ended up following a river back to the sea anyway.  Why?  Because that's the best place to look out for passing boats and civilization.  Then WHY leave the beach in the first place?

I was channel surfing one night and caught Les Stroud curled up inside a lean-to surrounded by old, used fuel drums in the Arctic Tundra.The show just looked so cool.No pun intended.BACKGROUNDLes Stroud has said in an interview that he was inspired to make ""Survivorman"" by the show, ""Survivor.""  He said that when ""Survivor"" came out, he said to himself, ""I can do that.""  Starting in 2001, he made a five-part series entitled ""Stranded,"" that was very similar in scope with ""Survivorman.""  He would be in an isolated location and, well,  have to survive.In 2004, Discovery Channel green lit and broadcast the first season of ""Survivorman.""SURVIVORMANAs I said, the premise of the show is that Les Stroud is dropped off by his camera crew/safety team at an isolated location armed with only what he has on him.  He does NOT get anything extra given to him during the week--and he stays at the location--completely alone--for seven days.It is amazing just how well a job he does of filming himself.  The show never feels like you are watching ""The Blair Witch Project.""  The quality of his filming is that good.And, the shots he gets are breath-taking.Les generally will pick a spot he wants to stay at for the night and go through, one by one, all of his belongings.  He then usually sets up a base camp, giving tips all the while, and settles in.  He also hunts for food, in the form of game or vegetation, shows us various ways of making fire, and always gives tips on we should--and should not--do if we ever find ourselves in the same situation.  In cold weather locales, Les always comments on how you have to be careful never to sweat:  ""You sweat, you die.""Many people, who found themselves in a ""Survivorman"" predictament, have credited the show with saving their lives.FURTHERMOREI think I am such a big fan of the show because of just how real it seems.  Les is very honest with his viewers, too.  He admits he does carry a global satellite phone with him in case of emergency; he has a safety camp located not all that far from his location; and that he does prep his location in advance before going in (which plants are edible, which are poisonous).Also, Les Stroud will struggle with getting a fire going.  Not every show has him making one in just a couple of minutes.  Sometimes it takes a while.  He also isn't always successful in hunting/fishing game.  In many episodes of the series, he won't catch a thing.  Again, this authenticity is why I enjoy the show as much as I do.I highly recommend it.THE EPISODESThere are nine episodes in all, contained on two discs.They are also ""extended episodes,"" containing more footage than the original televised broadcasts.DISC ONEBoreal Forest, Northern OntarioArizona, Sonoran DesertGeorgian Swamp, GeorgiaCosta Rica, Marooned on the Osa PeninsulaDISC TWOCanadian ArcticRocky Mountains (Canadian)Utah CanyonsPlane Crash, Temagami, OntarioBelize (an island off the coast of Belize)There is also a tenth ""Making Of"" episode, but I believe you only can get it through the Season One package offered on Les Stroud's website, which is:[...]DISC SPECSFormat: Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Full Screen, NTSCLanguage: EnglishAspect Ratio: 1.33:1Run Time is 404 MinutesThere is no rating but Discovery Channel rates the televised episodes TV-PGPHOTOGRAPHYWhether it is:A spooky, mist-filled swamp at dawn; a lush, tropical paradise; night view close-ups of an absolutely miserable Les Stroud in the jungle--sweaty, exhausted and bug-eaten; lively rolling brooks throughout the cold weather--but green--Canadian  Boreal Forest; rail line in the middle of nowhere which seem to run on forever; the sun peeking through the canyons of Utah...This collection has it all.  Beautifully photographed.FINAL THOUGHTSI feel this is the most ""real"" of all the reality shows out there.  It has depth. You can learn quite a bit from each episode. As said, the photography of each episode is beautiful. And who knows?  Watching this show may one day save your life.My strongest reason to recommend this show, however, is Les Stroud, himself.  Seeing as how he has to carry the show by himself, he succeeds greatly--and is very likable, to boot.I'm sure that when you check the show out you'll agree.Five Stars",5,"""There's something big out there...""",1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,4493,"['Survivorman', 'Canadian', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'outdoorsman', 'who', 'out', 'much', 'varying', 'locales', 'world', 'there', 'alone', 'seven', 'days', 'filming', 'experiences', 'well', 'survives.I', 'first', 'discovered', 'show', 'quite', 'accident', 'was', 'channel', 'surfing', 'one', 'night', 'caught', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'curled', 'up', 'lean-to', 'surrounded', 'old', 'used', 'fuel', 'drums', 'Arctic', 'Tundra.The', 'show', 'just', 'looked', 'so', 'cool.No', 'pun', 'intended.BACKGROUNDLes', 'Stroud', 'said', 'interview', 'was', 'inspired', 'make', 'Survivorman', 'show', 'Survivor', 'said', 'when', 'Survivor', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'can', 'do', 'Starting', '2001', 'made', 'five-part', 'series', 'entitled', 'Stranded', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'scope', 'Survivorman', 'would', 'be', 'isolated', 'location', 'well', 'have', 'survive.In', '2004', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'green', 'lit', 'broadcast', 'first', 'season', 'Survivorman', 'SURVIVORMANAs', 'said', 'premise', 'show', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'dropped', 'off', 'camera', 'crew/safety', 'team', 'isolated', 'location', 'armed', 'only', 'what', 'NOT', 'get', 'anything', 'extra', 'given', 'week', 'location', 'completely', 'alone', 'seven', 'days.It', 'amazing', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'job', 'filming', 'show', 'never', 'feels', 'are', 'watching', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quality', 'filming', 'good.And', 'shots', 'are', 'breath-taking.Les', 'generally', 'will', 'pick', 'spot', 'stay', 'night', 'go', 'one', 'one', 'belongings', 'then', 'usually', 'up', 'base', 'camp', 'giving', 'tips', 'while', 'settles', 'also', 'food', 'form', 'game', 'vegetation', 'various', 'ways', 'making', 'fire', 'always', 'tips', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'ever', 'find', 'same', 'situation', 'cold', 'weather', 'locales', 'Les', 'always', 'comments', 'how', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'never', 'sweat', 'sweat', 'die', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'Survivorman', 'predictament', 'have', 'credited', 'show', 'saving', 'lives.FURTHERMOREI', 'think', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'real', 'Les', 'very', 'honest', 'viewers', 'too', 'carry', 'global', 'satellite', 'phone', 'case', 'emergency', 'safety', 'camp', 'located', 'not', 'far', 'location', 'prep', 'location', 'advance', 'going', 'plants', 'are', 'edible', 'are', 'poisonous', '.Also', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'will', 'struggle', 'getting', 'fire', 'going', 'Not', 'show', 'making', 'one', 'just', 'couple', 'minutes', 'while', 'also', ""n't"", 'always', 'successful', 'hunting/fishing', 'game', 'many', 'episodes', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'thing', 'Again', 'authenticity', 'why', 'enjoy', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'do.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.THE', 'EPISODESThere', 'are', 'nine', 'episodes', 'contained', 'two', 'discs.They', 'are', 'also', 'extended', 'episodes', 'containing', 'more', 'footage', 'original', 'televised', 'broadcasts.DISC', 'ONEBoreal', 'Forest', 'Northern', 'OntarioArizona', 'Sonoran', 'DesertGeorgian', 'Swamp', 'GeorgiaCosta', 'Rica', 'Marooned', 'Osa', 'PeninsulaDISC', 'TWOCanadian', 'ArcticRocky', 'Mountains', 'Canadian', 'Utah', 'CanyonsPlane', 'Crash', 'Temagami', 'OntarioBelize', 'island', 'coast', 'Belize', 'also', 'tenth', 'Making', 'episode', 'believe', 'only', 'can', 'get', 'Season', 'One', 'package', 'offered', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'website', '[', ']', 'DISC', 'SPECSFormat', 'Color', 'Dolby', 'DVD-Video', 'Full', 'Screen', 'NTSCLanguage', 'EnglishAspect', 'Ratio', '1.33:1Run', 'Time', '404', 'MinutesThere', 'rating', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'rates', 'televised', 'TV-PGPHOTOGRAPHYWhether', 'spooky', 'mist-filled', 'swamp', 'dawn', 'lush', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'night', 'close-ups', 'absolutely', 'miserable', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'jungle', 'sweaty', 'exhausted', 'bug-eaten', 'lively', 'rolling', 'brooks', 'cold', 'weather', 'green', 'Canadian', 'Boreal', 'Forest', 'rail', 'line', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'seem', 'run', 'forever', 'sun', 'peeking', 'canyons', 'Utah', 'collection', 'Beautifully', 'photographed.FINAL', 'THOUGHTSI', 'feel', 'most', 'real', 'reality', 'out', 'there', 'depth', 'can', 'learn', 'quite', 'bit', 'episode', 'said', 'photography', 'episode', 'beautiful', 'who', 'Watching', 'show', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'save', 'life.My', 'strongest', 'reason', 'recommend', 'show', 'however', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'Seeing', 'how', 'carry', 'show', 'greatly', 'very', 'likable', 'boot.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'when', 'check', 'show', ""'ll"", 'agree.Five', 'Stars']",Survivorman
