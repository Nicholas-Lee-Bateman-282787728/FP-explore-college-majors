889557,A37CC2I37GI7Z2,B0007TKHFM,A Reviewer,"[7, 8]","This second season of ""Touched By An Angel"" is very good. They don't make shows like this anymore. And so far, there aren't anymore reruns of this show. Therefore, I recommend that all fans of this show should buy this set, along with Seasons 1 and 3. The only downfall about this set is that this is not it's best season. There are some good episodes, but most episodes aren't as good as the later seasons. Season 3 has better episodes. However, I still recommend this set to all fans.  Now, as far as the picture quality is, it's ok. It's not the best transfer. The main problem with the picture is that it's slightly grainy and looks muddy at times. Overall, it's not a bad transfer, so it doesn't bother me. As far as the sound quality is, it is alright. In my opinion, the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo sound is quite weak. It doesn't have much bass to it.

889560,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007TKHFM,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[24, 25]","Nominated for 3 Golden Globes and 12 Emmys, including two by Della Reese for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Touched By An Angel built a sizeable and loyal audience with its upbeat themes and inspirational storylines. The brainchild of John Masius, creator of Providence (1999) and writer for such hit series as St. Elsewhere (1982) and LA Law (1986), Touched By An Angel follows in the footsteps of Michael Landon's successful series Highway To Heaven, which chronicled the exploits of a single angel who wandered across the United States providing support for lost souls in need of aid. Touched By An Angel is quite similar, but the series uses multiple angels to achieve its purpose. Like Highway To Heaven the series utilizes a contemporary setting and modern problems, allowing the show reach a broad audience who enjoy its themes of love, hope, and redemption...Touched By An Angel follows the exploits of several angels sent to Earth as ""caseworkers"" so as to bring God's message of love, peace, and hope to the distressed people of the world. When the series begins, Monica (Roma Downey) is a novice caseworker still in training (having just been promoted from ""search & rescue""). Assisting Monica, and a caseworker in her own right, is Tess (Della Reese) who lends the wisdom of her many years of experience in dealing with the problems afflicting humanity at large. Together, these two angels interact with people on Earth, easing the burden of each soul with which they come into contact. In later seasons, Monica and Tess would be joined by Andrew (John Dye), the Angel of Death who also fills in as a caseworker to help lighten the load, and in the final two seasons (2001-2003), Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli) would join the trio as a regular recurring angel character... Overall, Touched By An Angel filled a desperately unmet need along the TV programming landscape. With much of today's programming fixated on sex, violence, and ""reality,"" the hour-long CBS drama provided deeply probing family-oriented content which always left its viewers with a positive and upbeat feeling...The Touched By An Angel (Season 2) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Interview with an Angel"" in which Monica is given the task of granting an interview to a journalist writing a piece on human encounters with angels. The reporter, Callie, is quite skeptical, but when Monica recounts the story of a couple that granted forgiveness to another person, Callie unwittingly becomes the subject of an angelic encounter herself... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Big Bang"" in which Monica reveals herself to a married couple intent on robbing a bank and exacting revenge on its president, and ""Lost And Found"" in which Monica and Andrew come to the aid of a troubled detective haunted by his failures while working for the Centre for Missing Children...Below is a list of episodes included on the Touched By An Angel (Season 2) DVD:Episode 12 (Interview with an Angel)Episode 13 (Trust)Episode 14 (Sympathy for the Devil)Episode 15 (The Driver)Episode 16 (Angels on the Air)Episode 17 (In the Name of
