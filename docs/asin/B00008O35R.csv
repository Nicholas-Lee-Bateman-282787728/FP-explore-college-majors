Which makes you wonder why they did not agree to a state of their own when Barak offered them 98% of the land through Clinton's initiatives.The movie, upon closer review, makes you think that Palestinians would rather suffer under occupation then to allow Israel to exist. You see hatred to Israel in everything they do; instead of focusing how to get their own state they focus on how to destroy Israel in their everyday lives. Kids throwing stones at tanks is meant to show in a shameless propaganist way how powerless Palestinians are against Israeli military might. Meanwhile, each of those stones can kill because how heavy they are; kids risk their lives on a daily basis digging underground tunnels to smuggle Hizballah/Iranian made weapons from Egypt into Gaza and then distribute these weapons to terrorists instead of going to school to prepare themselves for an independent Palestinian state someday. Kids are being brainwashed by ruthless, heartless Hamasnicks so they can achieve their goal.. to destroy Israel someday. Do you ever see Israelis shouting ""Death to Arabs"" in the streets of Tel-Aviv?? Ever??? Once??? People in Israel want to live in peace - is that too much to ask for?Everyone points at Israel when it acts in self-defense, but noone asks why a democratic, liberal state is forced to obtain its Supreme Court permission to destroy peoples homes.. This movie is propaganist they way it was shot and edited, however it reveals a true face of Palestinians today.P.S. Can you imagine something like that in Israel??11/15/05 ""Saudi court: 750 lashes for praising Jews.

Filmmaker James Longley doesn't dwell on the ""who started what"" aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian question--instead the focus is to show glimpses of life in the Gaza Strip. And the scenes in the film are grim. The documentary conveys chaos, unrelenting poverty, and hopelessness in each frame The film begins in the spring of 2001, and a great deal of the footage focuses on Mohammed, a 13 year-old boy who sells newspapers to help support his family. He left school at the seasoned age of 8. Mohammed discusses many of the friends he had who are now dead, and he also admits that he likes to throw stones ""to defend the homeland.""Street scenes include gunfire which sends schoolchildren scattering, but some children are so inured to it, they seem merely curious. Some children express a desire to grow up and become martyrs. In one scene, the appearance of an Israeli vehicle shows men smashing the nearest boulder (and there's plenty due to the piles of rubble laying all over the place), and then loading sling-type devices with stones to fling at the Israelis. In amongst the men, there are younger boys who clearly feel the excitement at hand.Other scenes show beaches heavy with traffic--vehicles stuck in the sand, and a long line of pedestrians who are forced to use the beach after the roads are closed. Palestinians express their frustration and the belief that ""the only left is to push us into the sea."" Other scenes show hospitals chaotic with casualities. One scene in particular is extremely gruesome. Officials from Doctors without Borders are interviewed in the film, and DVD extras include commentary from the director, a map of the Gaza Strip, and a slideshow. The saddest element to the film remains the children who nurse strong political opinions and exhibit the pitiful maturity that comes with daily violence and poverty.

The most horrifying scenes for me are when Palestinians get seriously wounded and injured and are taken to a hospital and there is no medical equipment!  This is a heart wrenching - must see documentary. I'm neither a Palestinian nor Muslim but when I see another human being living in desolate poverty and violence, and it is encouraged and brought on by our government, I feel horribly upset.Even me, for the last couple of years I read our newspapers, I would read that today 10 Israelis died in a suicide bombing and I would say damn, why is there all that fighting over there?  Thanks to religion fanatics, unfettered aid and our government ignoring the Palestinians, we are never shown the Palestinian struggle.  Most Americans don't realize this because daily our media leads us to believe that Palestinians are simply terrorists. I urge you - please refer to [...] or [...] or even [...] for real news.  Many people think Fox news is biased - that is the tip of the iceberg. CNN, NBC, Time magazine, I could go on and on about how one-sided, agenda pushing and hate filled the media and government is.[...] is a great site about the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  If this DVD is too expensive for you - borrow it from the library, buy it used or go here:[...] At his website, you can ask PBS to play this movie for you.Every American should see this movie and see that their tax dollars are being spent on illegal and immoral weapons of oppression.  Whether a person is Muslim, Jew or anything in between, it is in everyone's interest to stop the hatred, open your eyes and see this documentary. I am ashamed that our government and media in this day and age can turn a blind eye to what is going on.  As long as people continue to be narrow-minded in thinking and say well these people are Muslims, we are Jews or vice versa, there will not be peace.

No one asks who started the war, or whose fault are the deaths. James Longley follows the daily routine of a kid in Gaza and the camera witnesses nothing staged, but the daily challenges and thereats to his life which the kid must navigate in order to survive.What impressed me the most about the main child in the documentary (but also about children I have met in developing world in general) is the amazing breadth of knowledge of world affiars he has. He is barely literate and sells papers to help support his fmaily, but still he is well aware of the world leaders and international organizations that have contibuted to his living circumstances either by instituionalizing discriminatory policies or by doing nothing while Israel breaks international law.Only those who are very secure can exist in ignorance of foreign leaders and international polcies. Those whose lives are insecure are very aware of the world palyers, because it is the decisions made overseas that jeopardize their way of life. The US gives more aid to Israel than to any other developing country. Most of it is received in the form of weapons.This week is the anniversary of the liberation of Aushwitz when the world is saying never agin will we have the horrors that we saw in World War II, but it is empty rhetoric. Entire communities continue to be attacked by states; excpet at least in the Nazis paid for their own horrows, more and more often in modern times the US funds other states' attrocities. The Palestinians are living in increasingly ghettoized communities, on land being illegally taken away from them at the hands of the Isralei state (which should not be confused with all Israeli people, because there are many Israeli human rights groups that deplore such policies and fight them).However, this film does not analyze policy, or poit fingers at where the weaopons come form. it does not talk about the water and land still being grabbed. It merely follows one kid around and introduces the viewer to the kid's immediate circle of acquaintances. The violence and politics are only background characters. Occasionally a friend is killed, but the incident is as if an unseen boogey man killed him, because the film does not attempt to explain the why and how such conditions were created to permit children to die so easily.No child should ever have to live in such circumstances.

I have no doubt that the death and destruction portrayed in the film took place. However, the microcosm of the Strip, as seen in this DVD, needs some explaination.The events in this film took place in 2000, following Sharon's defeat of Barak. Why was Barak defeated in the Israeli elections? Because Yassir Arafat consistently and deliberately failed to meet any of the obligations he incurred in the agreement which set up the Palestinian Authority. Mostly, he failed to prevent terror attacks from being launched from PA territory.So, Fatah and Hamas were actively attacking innocent Israelis with bombs and weapons given to the PA for use by its police. The Gaza Strip is not, and for all practical purposes at the time of this filming, was not occupied by Israeli forces. Gaza was the responsibility of the PA.I live in Egypt. The old-timers here tell me that 12 or 15 years ago, before Arafat was allowed to enter the Gaza Strip, you could drive from the Sinai to Tel Aviv by way of Gaza. Now we have to take a rather longer route. Before the Palestinian Authority, when the Israelis administered the Strip, the population there enjoyed one of the highest per-capita incomes in the region.

This is basically raw footage in the sense that the camera is roaming the streets following people as they go about their daily life.One might argue that you don't get to hear the Israeli side of the story, a valid argument. However, I don't think the movie is trying to analyse the conflict; it is just showing the people living in Gaza and their ever changing reaction to what's going on in their life from despair to the hope of a better tomorrow.The main character, a boy, summarises it all at the end when he says that he would rather die then continue on living like this.

745983,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00008O35R,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 3]","Already a little dated, this documentary still packs a wallop. American filmmaker James Longley went to Gaza in early 2001, unwittingly catching a kind of time-capsule picture of this part of the Muslim world just before 9/11 and the war in Iraq. Released in 2002, it is a mostly cinema-verite portrayal of a population under siege. Though we never see the Israeli defense forces that were at the time engaged in protecting the (illegal) Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, we hear their gunfire, witness their night-time rocket attacks, and see the aftermath of bulldozing the homes of Palestinians with the misfortune of living too close to the settlements. Longley follows a 13-year-old school dropout who sells newspapers in the streets and gathers with other boys to throw stones at the Israeli checkpoints. He also enters the emergency rooms and wards of hospitals where the injured (many of them children) are brought with gunshot and shrapnel wounds. For a brief moment we see the mangled body of a boy blown apart by a booby-trapped boxing glove planted, we are told, by Israeli soldiers.There is grief, despair, and anger all around, as these Palestinians describe themselves as a people with their backs to the sea and no place to go. ""What country would have us?"" a young woman asks. Meanwhile, the young newspaper-carrier recounts the loss of his friends, remembers his father who was taken prisoner during the First Intifada, and muses on the release from anguish that death would bring him. It is obviously not the complete story of the Israeli Occupation - and much has happened there since then, including the closure of the settlements and the rise of Hamas, which figures briefly but portentously at the end of the film as Longley's camera slowly pans in 360 degrees around a neighborhood leveled and blown apart by Israeli bulldozers and tanks.The tone of some scenes is underscored by a minimal music track, and some portions of the film become a frenzy of flash frames to suggest the chaotic nature of what Longley was filming, but there is no narrator explaining to us what we are seeing. However, the DVD includes a commentary by Longley, in which he describes in greater depth what his film shows. That he knew virtually nothing about Palestine, as he claims, before he went there with his camera suggests that a better grounded filmmaker would likely have produced a very different film, but even with that caveat it is certainly worth watching just for the visual images and the sounds that it captures (""crackle of automatic gunfire"" takes on a whole new character when you hear it in this film and see school children ducking for cover).",4,The crackle of gunfire . . .,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2668,"['Already', 'little', 'dated', 'documentary', 'still', 'wallop', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'James', 'Longley', 'went', 'Gaza', 'early', '2001', 'unwittingly', 'catching', 'kind', 'time-capsule', 'picture', 'part', 'Muslim', 'world', 'just', '9/11', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Released', '2002', 'mostly', 'cinema-verite', 'portrayal', 'population', 'siege', 'never', 'see', 'Israeli', 'defense', 'forces', 'were', 'time', 'engaged', 'protecting', 'illegal', 'Jewish', 'settlements', 'Gaza', 'Strip', 'hear', 'gunfire', 'witness', 'night-time', 'rocket', 'attacks', 'see', 'aftermath', 'bulldozing', 'homes', 'Palestinians', 'misfortune', 'living', 'too', 'close', 'settlements', 'Longley', '13-year-old', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'newspapers', 'streets', 'gathers', 'other', 'boys', 'throw', 'stones', 'Israeli', 'checkpoints', 'also', 'emergency', 'rooms', 'wards', 'hospitals', 'where', 'injured', 'many', 'children', 'are', 'brought', 'gunshot', 'shrapnel', 'wounds', 'brief', 'moment', 'see', 'mangled', 'body', 'boy', 'blown', 'apart', 'booby-trapped', 'boxing', 'glove', 'planted', 'are', 'told', 'Israeli', 'grief', 'despair', 'anger', 'around', 'Palestinians', 'describe', 'people', 'backs', 'sea', 'place', 'go', 'What', 'country', 'would', 'have', 'young', 'woman', 'Meanwhile', 'young', 'newspaper-carrier', 'recounts', 'loss', 'friends', 'remembers', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'First', 'Intifada', 'muses', 'release', 'anguish', 'death', 'would', 'bring', 'obviously', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'Israeli', 'Occupation', 'much', 'happened', 'then', 'including', 'closure', 'settlements', 'rise', 'Hamas', 'briefly', 'portentously', 'end', 'film', 'Longley', 'camera', 'slowly', '360', 'degrees', 'neighborhood', 'leveled', 'blown', 'apart', 'Israeli', 'bulldozers', 'tanks.The', 'tone', 'scenes', 'underscored', 'minimal', 'music', 'track', 'portions', 'film', 'become', 'frenzy', 'flash', 'frames', 'suggest', 'chaotic', 'nature', 'what', 'Longley', 'was', 'filming', 'narrator', 'explaining', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'However', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Longley', 'greater', 'depth', 'what', 'film', 'shows', 'knew', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'Palestine', 'went', 'camera', 'better', 'grounded', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'produced', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'even', 'caveat', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'visual', 'images', 'sounds', 'crackle', 'automatic', 'gunfire', 'whole', 'new', 'character', 'when', 'hear', 'film', 'see', 'school', 'children', 'ducking', 'cover']",N/A
