Your little girl will learn that when you try to take shortcuts in getting a job done, you will end up with disaster and it will take more time and effort to fix the problems you made. I love the lesson that this teaches our children - something we are already trying to instill in our daughter.What I do not like about the Princesses is that life is oftentimes centered around them rather than others. I want my daughter to be others centered not self centered. When you are others centered and you come last, you will have a joy and happiness that things can not give you.The music was as always cute and very catchy.",3,Great storyline - a little self-centered,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,870,"['will', 'admit', 'kid', 'love', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'adult', 'raising', 'very', 'impressionable', 'young', 'daughter', 'look', 'little', 'differently.This', 'limited', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Princess', 'Jasmine', 'Princess', 'Aurora', 'fun', 'musical', 'filled', 'adventure', 'little', 'girl', 'will', 'learn', 'when', 'try', 'take', 'shortcuts', 'getting', 'job', 'done', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'disaster', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'fix', 'problems', 'made', 'love', 'lesson', 'children', 'something', 'are', 'already', 'trying', 'instill', 'daughter.What', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'Princesses', 'life', 'oftentimes', 'centered', 'rather', 'others', 'want', 'daughter', 'be', 'others', 'centered', 'not', 'self', 'centered', 'When', 'are', 'others', 'centered', 'come', 'last', 'will', 'have', 'joy', 'happiness', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'you.The', 'music', 'was', 'always', 'cute', 'very', 'catchy']",N/A
1262665,A1JEE6BMU0F6D8,B002CLBJP0,"Amazon Customer ""Savanah""","[0, 0]","My 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter both LOVE this movie. I see a lot of reviews complaining that the DVD is geared for a younger audience but that is exactly what I've been trying to find.Last summer my daughter saw a princess Sleeping Beauty baby doll in the park and suddenly was obsessed with my Disney classic collection. I let her watch them with me but had to fast forward and skip the scary parts and Cinderella was the only film I could let her sit all the way through! I started buying the princess DVD's so my just turning toddler could indulge her infatuation with pretty princesses and flowing dresses. Unfortunately all of those movies were about Jasmine and Ariel, and not the feisty, brave characters from the movies, but whining, selfish, outspoken, and rude little versions that seemed geared towards bratty teens who share their angst issues with these ""princesses."" Teenagers have the Disney channel, Hannah Montana, Wizards etc. They don't want to see the princesses and I was beginning to realize that the the Disney princess line was being herded toward teenage allowance money in the area of video games, barbie dolls and sexed up concepts.Luckily for us Disney FINALLY stepped in and saved the Princess legacy. This DVD actually appeals well to the little girls who are loving the new baby princess dolls, the tea sets and the new princess dress up and bath time play lines.The Animation matches the quality you'll find in Cinderella III, a twist in time. I don't mind it and the babies love the color and attention to detail that was given to the film. Case in point, the animated sequence for the song ""Keys to the Kingdom"" is done impeccably and the artsy feel of the 1951 original is placed secondary to the modern story but it's there just the same. The backgrounds in the first story are beautiful and the princess has been given the leading role this time. The first story opens with the kings, queen and the the prince leaving for a conference and leaving Aurora ""in charge"" for two days. She learns that the job is much more difficult than she first believed but the moral to the story ultimately maintains that by doing a job right the first time and avoiding the easy way out you will succeed. A perfect lesson for girls today and who better to deliver that lesson than Mom with the help of a pretty and graceful princess?The second story shows Jasmine as a young woman dissatisfied with being a ""Peacock Princess"" which is yet another fun and well produced song sequence. Jasmine convinces her father to give her ""important"" jobs, but learns that perseverance is more important than the job and that anyone can do anything if they believe and try again. I was much happier with this version of Jasmine. Another great song is ""Eyes on the Prize"" (I think that's the name) where Jasmine tries to bring her deceased mother's horse back to her father. She is vivacious and as pretty as she was in Aladdin, she also has a main role. We get to see the same brave and spirited character we learned to love in the film instead of the spoiled, ""arm candy"" of the recent Princess story collections.The bonus disk includes a ""sneak peak"" of The Princess and the Frog, which is more what we're going to find on the special features portion of the up and coming DVD release. You can find six minutes of actual footage for The Princess and the Frog on the Diamond release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The disk also includes two songs, one by Cinderella and one by Mulan.Overall I would purchase this again and I'm planning to gift this to other little princesses in my life. I'm looking forward to further installments and highly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a film for young princesses.",5,Hoping for more in this series!,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,3747,"['4', 'year', 'old', 'son', '2', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'see', 'lot', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'DVD', 'geared', 'younger', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'find.Last', 'summer', 'daughter', 'saw', 'princess', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'baby', 'doll', 'park', 'suddenly', 'was', 'obsessed', 'Disney', 'classic', 'collection', 'let', 'watch', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'skip', 'scary', 'parts', 'Cinderella', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'could', 'let', 'sit', 'way', 'started', 'buying', 'princess', 'DVD', 'so', 'just', 'turning', 'toddler', 'could', 'indulge', 'infatuation', 'pretty', 'princesses', 'flowing', 'dresses', 'Unfortunately', 'movies', 'were', 'about', 'Jasmine', 'Ariel', 'not', 'feisty', 'brave', 'characters', 'movies', 'whining', 'selfish', 'outspoken', 'rude', 'little', 'versions', 'seemed', 'geared', 'towards', 'bratty', 'teens', 'who', 'share', 'angst', 'issues', 'princesses', 'Teenagers', 'have', 'Disney', 'channel', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Wizards', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'princesses', 'was', 'beginning', 'realize', 'Disney', 'princess', 'line', 'was', 'being', 'herded', 'teenage', 'allowance', 'money', 'area', 'video', 'games', 'barbie', 'dolls', 'sexed', 'up', 'concepts.Luckily', 'Disney', 'FINALLY', 'stepped', 'saved', 'Princess', 'legacy', 'DVD', 'actually', 'appeals', 'well', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'loving', 'new', 'baby', 'princess', 'dolls', 'tea', 'sets', 'new', 'princess', 'dress', 'up', 'bath', 'time', 'play', 'lines.The', 'Animation', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Cinderella', 'III', 'twist', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'babies', 'love', 'color', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'given', 'film', 'Case', 'point', 'animated', 'sequence', 'song', 'Keys', 'Kingdom', 'done', 'impeccably', 'artsy', 'feel', '1951', 'original', 'placed', 'secondary', 'modern', 'story', 'there', 'just', 'same', 'backgrounds', 'first', 'story', 'are', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'been', 'given', 'leading', 'role', 'time', 'first', 'story', 'kings', 'queen', 'prince', 'leaving', 'conference', 'leaving', 'Aurora', 'charge', 'two', 'days', 'job', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'first', 'believed', 'moral', 'story', 'ultimately', 'doing', 'job', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'avoiding', 'easy', 'way', 'will', 'succeed', 'perfect', 'lesson', 'girls', 'today', 'who', 'better', 'deliver', 'lesson', 'Mom', 'help', 'pretty', 'graceful', 'princess', 'second', 'story', 'shows', 'Jasmine', 'young', 'woman', 'dissatisfied', 'being', 'Peacock', 'Princess', 'yet', 'fun', 'well', 'produced', 'song', 'sequence', 'Jasmine', 'father', 'give', 'important', 'jobs', 'perseverance', 'more', 'important', 'job', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'believe', 'try', 'again', 'was', 'much', 'happier', 'version', 'Jasmine', 'great', 'song', 'Eyes', 'Prize', 'think', 'name', 'where', 'Jasmine', 'bring', 'deceased', 'mother', 'horse', 'back', 'father', 'vivacious', 'as', 'pretty', 'was', 'Aladdin', 'also', 'main', 'role', 'get', 'see', 'same', 'brave', 'spirited', 'character', 'learned', 'love', 'film', 'instead', 'spoiled', 'arm', 'candy', 'recent', 'Princess', 'story', 'collections.The', 'bonus', 'disk', 'sneak', 'peak', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'more', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'special', 'features', 'portion', 'up', 'coming', 'DVD', 'release', 'can', 'find', 'six', 'minutes', 'actual', 'footage', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'Diamond', 'release', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'disk', 'also', 'two', 'songs', 'one', 'Cinderella', 'one', 'Mulan.Overall', 'would', 'purchase', 'again', ""'m"", 'planning', 'gift', 'other', 'little', 'princesses', 'life', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'further', 'installments', 'highly', 'recommend', 'product', 'anyone', 'looking', 'purchase', 'film', 'young', 'princesses']",N/A
1262666,A3P9MJ7903DX2H,B002CLBJP0,"Clifton Dillon ""Cliff""","[0, 0]","While a lot of Disney animated DTV titles are nothing more than &#34;sequels and prequels&#34;  this title gives us two heartwarming tales from two of Disney's favorite princesses Aurora and Jasmine.  Aurora makes her first animated appearance since the classic Sleeping Beauty ;  the story follows Aurora as she gets &#34;the keys to the kingdom&#34; and performs all the task that her mother and father would do. (everyone went to a royal conference but Aurora) .  Aurora does a great job but when things a little tough for her she uses a little magic provided via left behind fairy wand, will Aurora fix everything before the King and Queen arrive back ?  With charming songs and alluring music this is sure to be a favorite for your little Sleeping Beauty.In the second half of the movie Princess Jasmine takes the reigns with her story.  The animation in this story is perhaps closer to or better than the original film, but it definitely out shines that of the both Aladdin sequels.  The music is not Alan Menken style  or up to par with the original but the songs are indeed catchy and fun to hear, the music is also a subtle treat if you listen closely .  Jasmine being fed up with her daily duties ( camel shows, cutting ribbons at carpet shops and having paintings of herself done ).  She feels she is &#34;more than a peacock princess&#34; and asks her father for a more challenging role to help out with.The Sultan lets her help her cousin as Royal Assistant Educator.  The day does not go as planned or as well as she would have hoped but she decides to go back.  Elsewhere on the palace grounds we find that the Sultan takes an apple to his beloved wife's horse Sahara , (whom only she could ride, let alone get close to. )  We meet a young boy named Hakeem who is a stable worker, (also he looks ironically identical to a very young Aladdin, who btw is nowhere in this story nor is Genie ! )  The following day Jasmine finds that her mothers favorite horse is missing and goes in search of it. When she sees finds Sahara its a task that will take all of determination as she sings &#34; I wont give up&#34;  ...  Two refreshing stories that will capture your love for these two leading ladies all over again,  music that is pleasing to the ears, and animation that is just as well done as the originals.This titles is for young children of all ages and for any older girls who loved being a princess.  The stories teach lessons of never giving up, and perseverance .  The film gets 5 stars because both stories are original and the songs and music are very catchy. The sound and picture are also very nice and we get to see what would have been of the series in a sing along song with Belle from Beauty and the Beast called &#34; You'll never loose this love&#34;  which was a story that was in development until cancelled by the wonderful John Lassetter .  (2D animation killer MHO)We also are treated to see what would have become of two stories of two more princesses.  Cinderella and Mulan .Also we are treated to another preview of the original trailer for this series which was called &#34;Kingdoms of Caring&#34;The stories in there focused on Belle and Aurora.This is a wonderful title and deserves much more respect that it get.  If you have any love for the Disney Princesses you owe it to yourself to at least give this a rental shot,  I don't think you will be left disappointed.",5,A wonderful set of new stories for the little princess(s) in your life,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,3406,"['lot', 'Disney', 'animated', 'DTV', 'titles', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', '34', 'sequels', 'prequels', '34', 'title', 'two', 'heartwarming', 'tales', 'two', 'Disney', 'favorite', 'princesses', 'Aurora', 'Jasmine', 'Aurora', 'first', 'animated', 'appearance', 'classic', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'story', 'Aurora', '34', 'keys', 'kingdom', '34', 'performs', 'task', 'mother', 'father', 'would', 'do', 'everyone', 'went', 'royal', 'conference', 'Aurora', 'Aurora', 'great', 'job', 'when', 'things', 'little', 'tough', 'little', 'magic', 'provided', 'left', 'fairy', 'wand', 'will', 'Aurora', 'fix', 'everything', 'King', 'Queen', 'arrive', 'back', 'charming', 'songs', 'alluring', 'music', 'sure', 'be', 'favorite', 'little', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty.In', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Jasmine', 'reigns', 'story', 'animation', 'story', 'perhaps', 'closer', 'better', 'original', 'film', 'definitely', 'shines', 'Aladdin', 'sequels', 'music', 'not', 'Alan', 'Menken', 'style', 'up', 'par', 'original', 'songs', 'are', 'indeed', 'catchy', 'fun', 'hear', 'music', 'also', 'subtle', 'treat', 'listen', 'closely', 'Jasmine', 'being', 'fed', 'up', 'daily', 'duties', 'camel', 'shows', 'cutting', 'ribbons', 'carpet', 'shops', 'having', 'paintings', 'done', '34', 'more', 'peacock', 'princess', '34', 'father', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'help', 'out', 'with.The', 'Sultan', 'help', 'cousin', 'Royal', 'Assistant', 'Educator', 'day', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'go', 'back', 'Elsewhere', 'palace', 'find', 'Sultan', 'apple', 'beloved', 'wife', 'horse', 'Sahara', 'whom', 'only', 'could', 'ride', 'let', 'alone', 'get', 'close', 'meet', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Hakeem', 'who', 'stable', 'worker', 'also', 'ironically', 'identical', 'very', 'young', 'Aladdin', 'who', 'btw', 'nowhere', 'story', 'Genie', 'following', 'day', 'Jasmine', 'mothers', 'favorite', 'horse', 'missing', 'search', 'When', 'finds', 'Sahara', 'task', 'will', 'take', 'determination', '34', 'wont', 'give', 'up', '34', 'Two', 'refreshing', 'stories', 'will', 'capture', 'love', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'over', 'again', 'music', 'pleasing', 'ears', 'animation', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'originals.This', 'young', 'children', 'ages', 'older', 'girls', 'who', 'loved', 'being', 'princess', 'stories', 'teach', 'lessons', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'perseverance', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'stories', 'are', 'original', 'songs', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'sing', 'song', 'Belle', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'called', '34', ""'ll"", 'never', 'loose', 'love', '34', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'development', 'cancelled', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Lassetter', '2D', 'animation', 'killer', 'MHO', 'also', 'are', 'treated', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'two', 'stories', 'two', 'more', 'princesses', 'Cinderella', 'Mulan', '.Also', 'are', 'treated', 'preview', 'original', 'trailer', 'series', 'was', 'called', '34', 'Kingdoms', 'Caring', '34', 'stories', 'focused', 'Belle', 'Aurora.This', 'wonderful', 'title', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'get', 'have', 'love', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'owe', 'yourself', 'least', 'give', 'rental', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'disappointed']",N/A

Ocasio,"[1, 1]","Many of us who bought this DVd were expecting to see a sequel to Sleeping Beauty in the same manner as the Disney studios did Cinderella II and Cinderella III and the Aladdin other two Aladdin movies, but this is NOT the case.These two stories of Aurora(Sleeping Beauty) and Jasmine(from Aladdin)are real cute little stories of what is a day or days in the life of a regular princess. These are their lives in happy ever after, we get to take a peek. There are no villains (no Maleficent, no Jafar).Both stories are cute, funny, simple to understand, have good short songs on them, and a moral or lesson to be learned in each one.Both were made in the same artistic style of the respective feature films where we first saw these princesses. But I must point out that Jasmine's story is a little bland after seeing her in the Aladdin TV series and two other Aladdin movies where she had more of an action role. Aurora's story fits her like glove.I highly recommend this DVD to all parents with young daughters who like Disney films (the main target audience for this direct to DVD release), (sorry, but boys won't like it, haha) and for the adults who wanted to see more of what the Disney studios can produce outside their feature film dept.As always Disney DVDs include other languages in their language tracks (with superb translations and wonderful acting in the other two dubs as well), closed captions and other features that enchace the viewers experience.",5,The Lives of Living Happy Ever After,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,1462,"['Many', 'who', 'bought', 'DVd', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'sequel', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'same', 'manner', 'Disney', 'studios', 'did', 'Cinderella', 'II', 'Cinderella', 'III', 'Aladdin', 'other', 'two', 'Aladdin', 'movies', 'NOT', 'case.These', 'two', 'stories', 'Aurora', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Jasmine', 'Aladdin', 'are', 'real', 'cute', 'little', 'stories', 'what', 'day', 'days', 'life', 'regular', 'princess', 'are', 'lives', 'happy', 'ever', 'get', 'take', 'peek', 'are', 'villains', 'Maleficent', 'Jafar', 'stories', 'are', 'cute', 'funny', 'simple', 'understand', 'have', 'good', 'short', 'songs', 'moral', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'one.Both', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'artistic', 'style', 'respective', 'feature', 'films', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'princesses', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'Jasmine', 'story', 'little', 'bland', 'seeing', 'Aladdin', 'TV', 'series', 'two', 'other', 'Aladdin', 'movies', 'where', 'had', 'more', 'action', 'role', 'Aurora', 'story', 'like', 'glove.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'parents', 'young', 'daughters', 'who', 'Disney', 'films', 'main', 'target', 'audience', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'sorry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'haha', 'adults', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'Disney', 'studios', 'can', 'produce', 'feature', 'film', 'dept.As', 'always', 'Disney', 'DVDs', 'include', 'other', 'languages', 'language', 'tracks', 'superb', 'translations', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'other', 'two', 'dubs', 'well', 'closed', 'captions', 'other', 'features', 'enchace', 'viewers', 'experience']",N/A

1262680,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B002CLBJP0,Monty Moonlight,"[61, 71]","Disney Princess DVDs take a new turn with ""Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams."" This 56 minute program, the first in a new DVD line, does something totally different: it offers entirely new and fully animated content. Finally, people get what they originally wanted and expected from the Disney Princess Collection DVDs. This disc features two all new animated stories starring Princess Aurora from ""Sleeping Beauty"" and Princess Jasmine from ""Aladdin."" What's more, Disney doesn't take advantage of the all-new animation by false advertising. They make no attempt to call this a ""sequel"" or ""Aurora Meets Jasmine,"" (they don't interact, by the way, so don't have a geek-gasm), though ""Tales of Perseverance"" would have made more sense than ""Follow Your Dreams."" I suppose the latter is more appealing to the younger set though.The program starts rather abruptly, as the closest thing there is to any opening credits are part of the main menu. To explain, as the DVD menu is kicked up for the first time, a proper English narrator introduces you to a magical castle in which a very special book is kept. The book is full of stories of Disney Princesses (and Mulan), sans the lovely Eilonwy (hmph), and when you select Play (or if you are simply entrusting Fast Play with full power), it immediately turns to a page featuring Aurora. The page comes alive, as Aurora greets the viewer and begins to talk about perseverance leading into the first story, ""Keys to the Kingdom.""In ""Keys to the Kingdom,"" Princess Aurora is left in charge of the land for two days while her parents, along with Prince Phillip and King Hubert, are away at a conference. Left in charge, she is determined to do everything well and on her own, no matter how long it takes. However, when the princess must send the three good fairies away with a speech King Hubert mistakenly left behind, Merryweather leaves her magic wand with Aurora in case she needs help. As the workload of signing papers and hearing villagers' grievances gets out of hand, Aurora finally does turn to the wand with disastrous results. One mistake leads to another, and Aurora soon decides she will have to find a way to solve the problems she has created on her own.After some closing comments from Aurora, the book turns pages again and we are introduced to Princess Jasmine. She begins her tale, ""More Than a Peacock Princess,"" which is about Jasmine wanting a more important role in the kingdom. Her father sets her up with a teacher's assistant gig, and Jasmine is quite excited about it, but this quickly goes bad as the students simply have no respect. Of course, she turns this around by the end of the story, thanks to the events that follow involving the royal family's beloved horse, Sahara. The horse belonged to Jasmine's mother who was the only one he would allow to ride him, so he is a very special animal to the sultan, if a disagreeable one. Sahara escapes one day though, and his young keeper (a grade-school Aladdin lookalike) is distraught. His family depends on the money he earns by keeping the horse. It's all up to Jasmine to retrieve Sahara before Sultan knows the horse is gone.Well, enough with the synopsis. Let's talk about how good this program really is. For starters, this is better than expected, in my opinion. Of course, I'm constantly surprised by the complaints of consumer after consumer who is frustrated when they buy a direct to video release that isn't at the same quality level of a theatrical release. I guess I have come to know what to expect. So, when I say this is better than expected, I am comparing it to past releases of the kind. The animation is pretty darn good for a direct-to-video non-feature. I mean, I was expecting something in the vein of the Aladdin TV series, but this was better than that. Not in terms of the writing, but in terms of the animation. And, while the characters weren't always on model to the extent one hopes, they did a fairly decent job, as with the backgrounds. Of course, the bigger shock to the senses throughout is Aurora's story, as this is our first time to see an Aurora story since her feature film back in the 1950's. This makes the drop in art quality more disturbing. In addition to that, none of the voices are the same and Aurora's is extremely different. In Jasmine's case, you have the original voices and we're used to seeing her in varying qualities on the TV series and DVD sequels. As for the writing, and you should really pay attention for this part, this program is really strongly targeted at small children. There are those out there who don't realize how many teen and adult fans these characters have. For those of us in that older category, realize before you buy that these DVDs are made for little kids. That's hardly something to complain about, either. Yes, I wish they made more animated programs aimed at the whole family, in true Disney tradition, but I also wish Disney Channel had this type of stuff running in its Playhouse Disney line-up rather than so many computer animated shows and other stuff. Disney is focusing its direct-to-video content on preschooler titles, and I'm just glad they are able to squeeze a few classic character subjects into that model. Think of this as a modern take on the old Jiminy Cricket shorts. They were made to teach little kids too, and the animation wasn't exactly ""Pinocchio"" quality. The thing that probably makes these a little harder to enjoy is that the princesses are overly sweet throughout and talk down to the audience in the intros since they are intended to be talking to little ones. But, getting on with discussing the writing, the first story is a cutesy story that is about on the level of something from ""Cinderella 2,"" if not a tad better. That's the dreaded 2nd film, not the much loved 3rd. Make what you want out of that. I feel that those stories would have been better received if they had been released in a format more like this one. At least this one doesn't have those horrible pop songs. There ARE songs in these stories though, but they're none too special and in the vein of ""Cinderella 3."" Yeah, that's the better one. There's also a new character in the Aurora story called the Duke, and he is supposed to be comic relief but isn't very successful at it. Perhaps he's funnier to little kids. Still, the Aurora story is tolerable because the visuals are better than TV animation, it's the first animated Aurora story in decades so it's a treat for Aurora fans, and magic wand play is always entertaining. And, of course, Aurora is a hottie. So is Jasmine when she's drawn right though, and her story is the more adventurous one. Not sure I'm going to side with the other opinions I've heard and say I like it better, as I enjoy the magic of the first, but the Jasmine tale is stronger overall with its story and songs, and one Jasmine bath scene, ha. Unfortunately, there is no appearance by Aladdin and the Genie in this one. It's just Jasmine, Abu, Iago, Rajah, Carpet, the Sultan and the guards, plus some new characters. And, while Jasmine's story is more adventurous, it doesn't come close to the material from the ""Aladdin"" animated series.Naturally, these stories are great for kids, and there's nothing scary in them if you're one of THOSE parents. Not a villain to be seen. It's all kept very cutesy and unthreatening. Definitely, the main reason to buy this is if you have kids or if you're a Disney completist, but please don't buy this expecting a feature film, especially not a theatrical quality one. It's two kid-aimed stories about two Disney princesses meant to teach perseverance. The animation quality is good compared to TV stuff, but it's not feature quality. For the sort of product it is though, it's about right. If you know what to expect, you may be happy with your purchase or know to avoid it, but you can't get them for false advertising this time around.Extra Features: These are hardly worth mentioning, but I will anyway. In addition to trailers for other stuff, you get two games and a music video. Actually, the music video IS worth mentioning. It's a Belle music video that also features all new animation (from an upcoming release in this line of DVDs). The song is called ""You'll Never Lose This Love,"" and the release is to be called ""Enchanted Tales: Kingdom of Kindness."" That is, if Lasseter doesn't pull the plug on this DVD line, as I heard he was supposed to have done already. As for the games, they are very short and can't have much replay value. One is an Aurora Dress Up game, the other is a Find Sahara game. You probably will only play each of these once, but I don't know how kids would feel about them.",3,"Better than you might expect, but aimed at the little ones.",1188864000,"09 4,
