While the production values were very high and the acting good, I have a few complaints.  First, its slower than it needs to be.  I appreciate the movie's attempt to create thick atmosphere by purposely going slow, but I think it goes a bit too slow.  Some elements are repeated/reinforced more than they need to be.  Second, and my largest complaint, the movie ends up being like a David Lynch production - lots of dream-like sequences, exaggerated characters and sequences, confusion between reality and twilight-zone like situations, etc, but without Lynch's brilliance.  With Lynch, you can accept the lack of clearly understandable plots because of the dazzling visual display.  In this case, not so much.  Quite a bit happens without a cohesive answer, but this is not the type of movie that lends itself to extensive ambiguities.  Anyway, its definitely worth a watch when you're in a pensive, dark-ish mood, just don't expect a groundbreaking movie.",3,"Had promise, but fell a bit short",1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1064,"['was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'ultimately', 'fell', 'bit', 'short', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'very', 'high', 'acting', 'good', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'First', 'slower', 'be', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'attempt', 'create', 'thick', 'atmosphere', 'purposely', 'going', 'slow', 'think', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'elements', 'are', 'repeated/reinforced', 'more', 'need', 'be', 'Second', 'largest', 'complaint', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'David', 'Lynch', 'production', 'lots', 'dream-like', 'sequences', 'exaggerated', 'characters', 'sequences', 'confusion', 'reality', 'twilight-zone', 'situations', 'etc', 'Lynch', 'brilliance', 'Lynch', 'can', 'accept', 'lack', 'clearly', 'understandable', 'plots', 'dazzling', 'visual', 'display', 'case', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bit', 'cohesive', 'answer', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'extensive', 'ambiguities', 'Anyway', 'definitely', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'pensive', 'dark-ish', 'mood', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'groundbreaking', 'movie']",N/A

Sure, it's not a big budget movie, but it's not poorly made at all.It's almost 2 hours long, but it kept me interested the whole time. There was not a single moment when I thought: ""Is this ever going to end?"" or ""This has been done before"". The movie develops slowly but there aren't any dry moments or moments that don't add anything to the plot. I think the plot was quite clever without being pretentious. Two different women who may or may not be the same person and who are determined to find out the truth about their real identity. Of course, don't expect a life-changing movie that raises questions or features existentialist messages.If you have watched Giuseppe Tornatore's ""The Unknown Woman"" or Franois Ozon's ""Swimming Pool"" and liked them, you will definitely like this one as well. It's a whole different plot, but developed in the same way.Besides, it was refreshing to see a movie where the two leading actresses, while being considered two of the most beautiful women in cinema, played a serious role and there was no need to show them half naked or in unneccesary soft porn scenes, as it seems to be the trend lately in movies.The movie takes place in Paris and Lecce without making the movie an excuse to show french or italian clich&eacute;s or picture-perfect scenes. It was also refreshing to see a movie set in Lecce, since a lot of film makers seem to think that Rome, Venice, Tuscany and Sicily are the only places in Italy where a movie should be set.I am giving this movie 5 stars for being clever, unpretentious and because it focuses on telling a story rather than showing skin and expensive cinematography.",5,"Underrated, Clever and Unpretentious",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1672,"['think', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Sure', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'not', 'poorly', 'made', 'all.It', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'kept', 'interested', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'when', 'thought', 'ever', 'going', 'end', 'been', 'done', 'movie', 'slowly', 'are', ""n't"", 'dry', 'moments', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'think', 'plot', 'was', 'quite', 'clever', 'being', 'pretentious', 'Two', 'different', 'women', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'real', 'identity', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'life-changing', 'movie', 'questions', 'features', 'existentialist', 'messages.If', 'have', 'watched', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'Unknown', 'Woman', 'Franois', 'Ozon', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'liked', 'will', 'definitely', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'different', 'plot', 'developed', 'same', 'way.Besides', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'leading', 'actresses', 'being', 'considered', 'two', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'cinema', 'played', 'serious', 'role', 'was', 'need', 'show', 'naked', 'unneccesary', 'soft', 'porn', 'scenes', 'be', 'trend', 'lately', 'movies.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Paris', 'Lecce', 'making', 'movie', 'excuse', 'show', 'french', 'italian', 'clich', 'eacute', 'picture-perfect', 'scenes', 'was', 'also', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'set', 'Lecce', 'lot', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'think', 'Rome', 'Venice', 'Tuscany', 'Sicily', 'are', 'only', 'places', 'Italy', 'where', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'set.I', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'clever', 'unpretentious', 'telling', 'story', 'rather', 'showing', 'skin', 'expensive', 'cinematography']",N/A

You see a woman getting ready, but you don't see her face as she does.  For instance, you see her take a shower but can only see her body through shiny shower tiles, which distort her image.  You see her looking in the bathroom mirror, but the mirror is covered with steam from the shower, and so on.The reason for this, you soon find out, is because this woman is experiencing an identity crisis.  As her true identity is slowly unravelled in this movie, it's unravelled in a very bizarre way.  Her surroundings and the people in it gradually morph before her eyes.  The special effects in this movie are well done and lend a creepy vibe to this movie.As these changes occur, you're just as bewildered as this woman.  It's as if she's entered some alternate universe that's meant to reveal some memories she's repressing, but you don't know what those memories are so they don't quite make sense.When it's finally revealed at the end, it may or may not be clear to some people.

1379624,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0040QYRT0,Eric Sanberg,"[4, 4]","This isn't an out and out horror movie. It's more of a psychological thriller, but it's about as scary as anything I've ever seen.Here's the scoop. Sophie Marceau is an author of biographies and wants to get into writing fiction. Her first book isn't working. It's based on her life but contains only dry details. She can't find the life in it. Now she's beginning to unravel. Things around her aren't looking the same. Her face and body seem to be changing. Her husband doesn't seem to be her husband. Is she going nuts? Clues send her from France to Italy where it begins to come together.As any number of writers and directors bust their humps to find ways to scare people, this came as a huge surprise. This is far and away the creepiest movie I've ever seen. And there are no jump scares or gore effects. Just a great sense of things not being right. What's happening to her? Is she going nuts? Is she being gas-lighted? Somehow I felt all this was happening to me because it was all so ""every day"" in its setting. No creepy house or external, malevolent force. Just a person starting to unwind. There is a transformation scene that has got to be one of the most unsettling scenes ever filmed.Sophie Marceau handles the first half of the film. Monica Bellucci handles the second half. Both do a terrific job. The first half is the set up and, as much as it made my skin crawl, it kept me wondering where this was all going. Then in the second half, when it starts to come together, it's still really creeped me out.At just over 2 hours this might be a bit long and slow for some viewers but it didn't bother me in the least. And maybe not everything added up at the end but it satisfied me.

What starts as Sophie's beautiful persona devolves into a different woman entirely, eventually morphing into Monica Bellucci's ageless self. The special effects used for this process create quite a disturbing visual feast of what I hope is never attempted again: taking these two and making them virtually unrecognizable through various scenes. To further describe the plot as it continues (in multiple languages) with intricate emotional scenes and twists would do a disservice.The production had a high value look to it, with only one or two significant flaws in effects. The acting is well performed and believable and I enjoyed the twists thrown at you as truths are uncovered. Some of the scenes are long and give both actresses a chance to utilize their minimalist skills, but the pacing eventually pays off. Not everything is explained openly, so the critiques of being unfulfilled in certain outlets are understandable, but this is worthy of a watch.The video clarity is solid as is the 5.1 sound.

I was instantly intrigued with the two names involved, and hopes something differnet in Marina de Van's latest work. Sadly, my hope soon faded, as the flat narrative went on and on.The film opens with Jeanne played by Sophie Marceau, a journalist and mother of two, who notices (so she thinks) that something is not quite right about what she is seeing. The furniture in her family's apartment looks less familiar. Her loving husband and children start to look like strangers. She is losing the comfort she has felt in her family before. Something is happening to Jeanne, who feels less and less at home among what surrounds her including her own children.""Don't Look Back"" starts with an interesting premise about one heroine, confused, and unsure about what is going on around her. Jeanne's confusion that develops into anxiety and panic is convincing with some unsettling visuals and effective acting from the leads. However, the film takes so much time setting up everything - with minute details of Jeanne's daily life and repressed memories - that once you realize where the film is going, it has very little else to offer. And for those who have noticed several hints dropped in the earlier part of the story, that is not a difficult task.In thrillers or mysteries, as you know, into the main story are woven subtexts, social or political, which I couldn't find in ""Don't Look Back."" Maybe I have missed it. Maybe I didn't. Whichever it is, as a mystery or a drama the film offers disappointingly little.
