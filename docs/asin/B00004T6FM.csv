550164,AIS6C91V0UJN,B00004T6FM,A Customer,"[8, 8]","I have been Jane Fonda's Yoga Workout for the past year or two, but decided I needed a little bit of a change.  I saw the DVD for this workout and thought I would give it a try.  I must say, I am glad I did.  I still do Jane Fonda's Yoga Workout, but do this one also as an added bonus to further improve my fitness.This is very good yoga workout.  I really like the idea of having four different people doing different levels of the same workout.  This way, it can be accessible to people of all levels of fitness, flexibility, etc.  There is also a feature on it called the Personal Instructor.  This is great if one is not sure how to do a position.  It was filmed in a very beautiful location in Arizona which makes it that much more relaxing.  Suzanne Deason is a great instructor.  She has done voice-over which takes you all the way from beginning to end without leaving you hanging wondering what to do next. There is a warm-up period, the workout period that includes a variety of poses, then there is a 14 minute cool-down ending in the Relaxation Pose.  Suzanne tells you to stay in Relaxation Pose as long as you like.  Really good for reducing stress, etc. I highly recommend this workout for anyone no matter what one's level of fitness may be.  Each instructor does great with each level of the workout.  There is fully modified for people with that are not flexible.  There is 1/2 modified for people with some flexibilty (which I do).  There is 1/4 modified for people that are a bit more flexible.  Then there is the full pose workout for experienced yoga practitioners.",5,My Second Yoga Workout!,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,1588,"['have', 'been', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'decided', 'needed', 'little', 'bit', 'change', 'saw', 'DVD', 'workout', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'still', 'do', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'do', 'one', 'also', 'added', 'bonus', 'further', 'improve', 'fitness.This', 'very', 'good', 'yoga', 'workout', 'really', 'idea', 'having', 'four', 'different', 'people', 'doing', 'different', 'levels', 'same', 'workout', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'accessible', 'people', 'levels', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'etc', 'also', 'feature', 'called', 'Personal', 'Instructor', 'great', 'one', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'do', 'position', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'beautiful', 'location', 'Arizona', 'much', 'more', 'relaxing', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'great', 'instructor', 'done', 'voice-over', 'way', 'beginning', 'end', 'leaving', 'hanging', 'wondering', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'warm-up', 'period', 'workout', 'period', 'variety', 'poses', 'then', '14', 'minute', 'cool-down', 'ending', 'Relaxation', 'Pose', 'Suzanne', 'stay', 'Relaxation', 'Pose', 'as', 'long', 'like', 'Really', 'good', 'reducing', 'stress', 'etc', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'anyone', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'level', 'fitness', 'may', 'be', 'instructor', 'great', 'level', 'workout', 'fully', 'modified', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'flexible', '1/2', 'modified', 'people', 'flexibilty', 'do', '1/4', 'modified', 'people', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'flexible', 'Then', 'full', 'pose', 'workout', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'practitioners']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS

550166,A1TP78YKYTQKMP,B00004T6FM,"alimac ""alimaacd""","[8, 8]","This was the first Yoga tape I ever purchased over a year and a half ago and it is the one that I always come back to! This one is the most relaxing and I feel I get the best stretch. The length of the stretch is key for me as I have other yoga tapes that don't hold the stretch for long enough in my opinion and that's where the work is. For those that feel it is not a workout there is a difference between simply holding up your arms and doing the postures and stretching and reaching and adding your own natural resistance. Only you will know if you are doing that and you can lower and deepen into the stretches more. If you don't feel it I don't think you are doing it properly.For others that feel the pace of the tape is too slow maybe power yoga is just more what they are looking for. The emphasis on this tape is to relax, let go of tension, and feel the stretch. The workout is in holding the stretch and building up that endurance.  Suzanne's voice is very soothing. She is heard as a backround with very light music and she gently guides you into each pose and breath. You just can't help but relax....even though you are still working hard.As for the weight loss marketing Suzanne pretty much explains in the beginning that weight loss will come naturally when you have a better connection between mind, body and spirit which is what Yoga is all about, so in that respect it's true. I have the VHS version which shows all four modifications and I like it that way. Some postures I can do in the complete form and others I do In one of the slightly modified forms.whether you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced, all levels are shown here. This is definitely a tape you could start with...grow into...and use, as I plan to, for a very very long time.",5,My all time favorite yoga video!!!,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1769,"['was', 'first', 'Yoga', 'tape', 'ever', 'purchased', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'one', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'one', 'most', 'relaxing', 'feel', 'get', 'best', 'stretch', 'length', 'stretch', 'key', 'have', 'other', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'stretch', 'long', 'enough', 'opinion', 'where', 'work', 'feel', 'not', 'workout', 'difference', 'simply', 'holding', 'up', 'arms', 'doing', 'postures', 'stretching', 'reaching', 'adding', 'own', 'natural', 'resistance', 'Only', 'will', 'know', 'are', 'doing', 'can', 'lower', 'deepen', 'stretches', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'doing', 'others', 'feel', 'pace', 'tape', 'too', 'slow', 'maybe', 'power', 'yoga', 'just', 'more', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'emphasis', 'tape', 'relax', 'let', 'go', 'tension', 'feel', 'stretch', 'workout', 'holding', 'stretch', 'building', 'up', 'endurance', 'Suzanne', 'voice', 'very', 'soothing', 'heard', 'backround', 'very', 'light', 'music', 'gently', 'pose', 'breath', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'relax', '.even', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'hard.As', 'weight', 'loss', 'marketing', 'Suzanne', 'pretty', 'much', 'explains', 'beginning', 'weight', 'loss', 'will', 'come', 'naturally', 'when', 'have', 'better', 'connection', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'what', 'Yoga', 'about', 'so', 'respect', 'true', 'have', 'VHS', 'version', 'four', 'modifications', 'like', 'way', 'postures', 'can', 'do', 'complete', 'form', 'others', 'do', 'one', 'slightly', 'modified', 'forms.whether', 'are', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'levels', 'are', 'shown', 'here', 'definitely', 'tape', 'could', 'start', 'grow', 'use', 'plan', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS

The user is advised to read the guide and listen to all the introductions before the actual exercise portion. It recommends further reading on weight loss by respected authorities.Contrary to the Amazon review which states, ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss isn't likely to promote weight loss any more than lots of other videos will,"" I have practiced yoga with this DVD many times and YES it *does* promote weight loss.The music feels appropriate to the desert setting, which is really beautiful to see. (Suggestion to Gaiam: it could be further enhanced in future videos by subtley adding another sound layer of the natural sounds of that environment.) Overall, the production value has greatly progressed from DVDs from this company of previous years and is one of my favorites.Suzanne Deason, an excellent teacher with beautiful yogic form, has a gentle, pleasant voice and guides the user on how to do each pose safely & effectively. There are women of different body shapes to guide the viewer through different levels of the exercises. This is a user-friendly DVD which for viewers of varying levels --and not only for those who want to lose weight, but also for those like me who want to maintain a healthy weight as I age.

I usually skip through much of the first part where she gives breathing instruction because it is just painfully slow. The conditioning part of the workout is actually not bad, and as many others have mentioned the ability to see the workout modified for your level is a fantastic addition. Overall though, I enjoy Alan Finger's Yoga Zone workouts much more than Suzanne Deason.  I feel he gives much better instruction, and provides superior guidance on each section of his programs. I also do not care for the new age style comments she uses throughout the routine. I love Yoga for the physical and relaxation aspects, but don't care for the &quot;whole being&quot; comments so much. I do also like that the other participants in the video are real women with normal bodies, and not totally buff supermodels as you often see in exercise videos.",3,Some good and bad features,1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,925,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'bad', 'routine', 'usually', 'skip', 'much', 'first', 'part', 'where', 'breathing', 'instruction', 'just', 'painfully', 'slow', 'conditioning', 'part', 'workout', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'ability', 'see', 'workout', 'modified', 'level', 'fantastic', 'addition', 'Overall', 'enjoy', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'much', 'more', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'feel', 'much', 'better', 'instruction', 'superior', 'guidance', 'section', 'programs', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'new', 'age', 'style', 'comments', 'routine', 'love', 'Yoga', 'physical', 'relaxation', 'aspects', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'quot', 'whole', 'being', 'quot', 'comments', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'also', 'other', 'participants', 'video', 'are', 'real', 'women', 'normal', 'bodies', 'not', 'totally', 'buff', 'supermodels', 'often', 'see', 'exercise', 'videos']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS
550170,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B00004T6FM,atisheh,"[2, 2]","This video spent some time gathering dust on my shelf before I finally tried it. When I finally did, I loved it, and this may well become my ""go to"" yoga video for busy days.I happen not to like ""flow"" videos so much, and it seems most yoga DVDs out there are exactly about that. I love the feeling of breathing into a pose, and the challenge of using my muscles to maintain a strong pose for a little while. Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss gives me just what I need: a good combination of standing, sitting, and lying poses; lots of twisting poses (which I've also found lacking in flow videos); a few poses which gently, but powerfully, build abdominal strength.The video allows you to do the workout at different levels of modification, which means that you can measure yourself to someone at your level as you check your position. It's hard to know if you're doing a pose right if the only model you get a yoga master, or if the modified pose is somewhere behind the yoga master (hard to see on a small screen). Almost every breath is cued, which I also appreciate, and Deason keeps up a running commentary with advice on what you should be feeling and doing during each pose. Her voice is soft enough that you can ignore it if you wish, but I found her suggestions very useful for working on strength and balance, especially during standing poses.And, the entire thing is only forty-five minutes long! It really fits into a busy day, and is wonderfully restorative. I'm not sure what it does for weight loss, but I can tell you that I feel physically good after doing the video, with just the right combination of energy and pleasant fatigue.",5,"A great, manageable yoga DVD for daily practice",1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,1649,"['video', 'spent', 'time', 'gathering', 'dust', 'shelf', 'finally', 'tried', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'loved', 'may', 'well', 'become', 'go', 'yoga', 'video', 'busy', 'days.I', 'happen', 'not', 'like', 'flow', 'videos', 'so', 'much', 'most', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'are', 'exactly', 'love', 'feeling', 'breathing', 'pose', 'challenge', 'using', 'muscles', 'maintain', 'strong', 'pose', 'little', 'while', 'Conditioning', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'good', 'combination', 'standing', 'sitting', 'lying', 'poses', 'lots', 'twisting', 'poses', ""'ve"", 'also', 'found', 'lacking', 'flow', 'videos', 'few', 'poses', 'gently', 'powerfully', 'build', 'abdominal', 'strength.The', 'video', 'do', 'workout', 'different', 'levels', 'modification', 'can', 'measure', 'someone', 'level', 'check', 'position', 'hard', 'know', ""'re"", 'doing', 'pose', 'right', 'only', 'model', 'get', 'yoga', 'master', 'modified', 'pose', 'somewhere', 'yoga', 'master', 'hard', 'see', 'small', 'screen', 'breath', 'cued', 'also', 'appreciate', 'Deason', 'up', 'running', 'commentary', 'advice', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'doing', 'pose', 'voice', 'soft', 'enough', 'can', 'ignore', 'wish', 'found', 'suggestions', 'very', 'useful', 'working', 'strength', 'balance', 'especially', 'standing', 'poses.And', 'entire', 'thing', 'only', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', 'busy', 'day', 'wonderfully', 'restorative', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'weight', 'loss', 'can', 'tell', 'feel', 'physically', 'good', 'doing', 'video', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'energy', 'pleasant', 'fatigue']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS

Each of the three students shows a different level of modifications, from slightly to completely modified.  I particularly liked how the two larger models displayed the more flexible versions of the poses, showing that yoga postures can be performed by anyone, regardless of body type.The practice begins with some basic breathing instruction in both seated and standing positions.  Suzanne then leads your through a nice variety of standing poses, including a warrior series, lunges, triangle, and wide legged forward bend.  The practice concludes on the floor with abdominal work, twists, bridge, and relaxation pose to finish, for a total of 47 minutes.  If you are doing modified versions of the poses, props are recommended:  as a beginner, I was able to get by with a single yoga block (a sturdy book could be subsituted), and now that I have been practicing yoga for several years, I no longer need the props when using this video.I still enjoy this tape now that I've been doing it for awhile; it's both relaxing and energizing.  More advanced yoga students may find the routine to be too slow and the moves to be too easy, but that's exactly what I like about it, as it's a nice change from my more challenging yoga videos.  Finally, this is the number one video that I recommend to those new to yoga:  the four different levels of modifications not only make the routine extremely accessible, but also they provide plenty of room to grow as you continue your home practice.  (I've heard that the DVD version is even better for this purpose, as it allows you to focus directly on the instructor who is doing your particular level of modifications.)Do you think that you're not flexible enough to do yoga?  So did I; this video changed my mind.

I don't use it for the purpose of  calorie burning, but rather as a gentle alternative to the more intense vinyasa (flow) yoga that I do several times a week.While this program probably won't make you sweat, it should certainly strengthen and tone your body as well as give you more body awareness. By having greater body awareness you'll be less likely to overstuff yourself mindlessly. You may also start to have a greater awareness of what causes you to overeat or eat junk in the first place.A special feature of this DVD is an interview with Suzanne Deason in which she talks about the principles of losing weight and how Yoga can help.For an excellent guide to losing weight, check out Yoga Teacher Baron Baptiste's book ""Journey Into Power"". It's a Yoga book which has twenty or so pages of the most sound approach to eating I've ever come across. I've been using it for years and have been at a healthy weight since implementing his approach. No fad diet stuff there, just a sound nutritional and mental approach to eating.Getting back to the program at hand. ""Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss"" is an excellent tool to help those who are out of shape get themselves moving again. It will help you build confidence that you are going forward rather than backwards.Suzanne Deason is an excellent teacher and the program is set up so that you can follow one of four teachers on the DVD at a level that is suitable for you even if you are a stone beginner. Also, two of the women on the program (who actually show the harder versions of the poses) aren't skinny stick figures but actually look like real women who have some meat on their bones (which is refreshing).Even for someone with my experience with yoga, I find this to be a wonderful program and I feel great every time I do it. When you are ready to get a bit more intense physically, check out Rodney Yee's excellent ""Power Yoga For Beginners, Stamina"" program as well as Baron Baptiste's ""Journey Into Power"" level one.Another series that I always highly recommend are ""Yoga Zone's Basics"" five VHS/DVD series or their ""Ultimate collection"" which has six DVD/VHS's, each containing two-twenty minute complete programs which are quite excellent and easy to fit into most anyone's schedule.Highly Recommended!",5,Not Power Yoga But Still Powerful Nonetheless!,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2428,"['particular', 'program', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'several', 'years', 'rotation', 'large', 'library', 'Yoga', ""DVD's/VHS"", 'really', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'purpose', 'calorie', 'burning', 'rather', 'gentle', 'alternative', 'more', 'intense', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'yoga', 'do', 'several', 'times', 'week.While', 'program', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sweat', 'should', 'certainly', 'strengthen', 'tone', 'body', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'more', 'body', 'awareness', 'having', 'greater', 'body', ""'ll"", 'be', 'less', 'likely', 'overstuff', 'mindlessly', 'may', 'also', 'start', 'have', 'greater', 'awareness', 'what', 'overeat', 'eat', 'junk', 'first', 'place.A', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'interview', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'principles', 'losing', 'weight', 'how', 'Yoga', 'can', 'help.For', 'excellent', 'guide', 'losing', 'weight', 'check', 'out', 'Yoga', 'Teacher', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'book', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'book', 'twenty', 'so', 'pages', 'most', 'sound', 'approach', 'eating', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'healthy', 'weight', 'implementing', 'approach', 'fad', 'diet', 'stuff', 'there', 'just', 'sound', 'nutritional', 'mental', 'approach', 'eating.Getting', 'back', 'program', 'hand', 'Yoga', 'Conditioning', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'excellent', 'tool', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'shape', 'get', 'moving', 'again', 'will', 'help', 'build', 'confidence', 'are', 'going', 'forward', 'rather', 'backwards.Suzanne', 'Deason', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'program', 'set', 'up', 'can', 'follow', 'one', 'four', 'teachers', 'DVD', 'level', 'suitable', 'even', 'are', 'stone', 'beginner', 'Also', 'two', 'women', 'program', 'who', 'actually', 'show', 'harder', 'versions', 'poses', 'are', ""n't"", 'skinny', 'stick', 'figures', 'actually', 'look', 'real', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'meat', 'bones', 'refreshing', '.Even', 'someone', 'experience', 'yoga', 'find', 'be', 'wonderful', 'program', 'feel', 'great', 'time', 'do', 'When', 'are', 'ready', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'physically', 'check', 'out', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'excellent', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'Stamina', 'program', 'as', 'well', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Power', 'level', 'series', 'always', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Basics', 'five', 'VHS/DVD', 'series', 'Ultimate', 'collection', 'six', 'DVD/VHS', 'containing', 'two-twenty', 'minute', 'complete', 'programs', 'are', 'quite', 'excellent', 'easy', 'fit', 'most', 'anyone', 'schedule.Highly', 'Recommended']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS

This particular video is great in that it both soothes you and energizes you at the same time!  Although I am fairly flexible to begin with, I find that this video helps me to improve on that, and I am impressed by Suzanne Deason's attention to all levels of yoga practicioners by providing 3 other modifications to her routine so everyone can follow along (provided they have the yoga props, which you can easily purchase).  For people who fear that yoga involves far more contortion than they can muster, you will be relieved to find that none of the poses in the routine are at all complicated, and Suzanne throws in reminders/suggestions every step of the way to make sure you're doing them correctly.Clearly, you won't see a dramatic loss of weight after your first couple times using this tape.  However, you will get a renewed sense of satisfaction in taking time for yourself, and I believe that weight loss and fitness in general is not just about huffing and puffing, but also involves your emotional state.  &quot;Look good, feel good&quot; should be reversed to &quot;Feel good, look good&quot;!What this tape WILL do for you, and you will feel it right away, is begin to tone your major muscle groups simply by holding the positions.

Now, I've been doing it consistently 4X a week for three months. I'm building muscle, I'm breathing better, my balance is much better, my cortisol levels are down (cortisol tells your body to store fat.) I've lost a size. (nothing like pulling off those previously tight jeans while they are still zipped and snapped.)  My husband can feel I'm thinner. My chiropractor can tell my spine is more flexible (more flexible than him ;heh;), with improved posture. I hold an adjustment longer and move into one more easily.

I have more energy on the days I do yoga.I orginally purchased this for stretching along with a traditional cardiovascular program.  I liked this much better and ditched the other, and with better results.  yoga is supposed to be slow - because slower and controlled movements require muscle so you will build muscle.  moving faster relies on momentum and doesn't build muscle.  muscle will burn calories even when you're asleep.This has been great for building muscles in balance with each other, both large and small muscles, surface and deep.  Because the dvd shows all three levels of modification as well as the full poses, you can grow with the program as you become stronger and more flexible. most poses develop muscles - even mt pose if done correctly uses abdominals, glutes and triceps.I've a friend who is a personal trainer. she's always been thin, but when she started training she gained 10 lbs - and lost a dress size.  because muscle has 1/3 the volume of fat, you can lose fat and gain muscle, but not actually lose weight all while getting thinner. the only diet changes I've consciously made are drinking more water and eating more protein. regular yoga practice has helped me get thinner by being consistent, but it's not an overnight fix.",5,great for building lean muscle and overall health,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1996,"[""'ve"", 'used', 'off', 'several', 'years', 'far', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'consistently', '4X', 'week', 'three', 'months', ""'m"", 'building', 'muscle', ""'m"", 'breathing', 'better', 'balance', 'much', 'better', 'cortisol', 'levels', 'are', 'down', 'cortisol', 'tells', 'body', 'store', 'fat', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'size', 'nothing', 'pulling', 'off', 'previously', 'tight', 'jeans', 'are', 'still', 'zipped', 'snapped', 'husband', 'can', 'feel', ""'m"", 'thinner', 'chiropractor', 'can', 'tell', 'spine', 'more', 'flexible', 'more', 'flexible', 'heh', 'improved', 'posture', 'hold', 'adjustment', 'longer', 'move', 'one', 'more', 'easily', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'often', 'saving', 'money', 'have', 'hypothyroid', 'poses', 'stimulate', 'thyroid', 'increasing', 'metabolism', 'naturally', 'have', 'more', 'energy', 'days', 'do', 'yoga.I', 'orginally', 'purchased', 'stretching', 'along', 'traditional', 'cardiovascular', 'program', 'liked', 'much', 'better', 'ditched', 'other', 'better', 'results', 'yoga', 'supposed', 'be', 'slow', 'slower', 'controlled', 'movements', 'require', 'muscle', 'will', 'build', 'muscle', 'moving', 'faster', 'relies', 'momentum', ""n't"", 'build', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'will', 'burn', 'calories', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'been', 'great', 'building', 'muscles', 'balance', 'other', 'large', 'small', 'muscles', 'surface', 'deep', 'dvd', 'three', 'levels', 'modification', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'poses', 'can', 'grow', 'program', 'become', 'stronger', 'more', 'flexible', 'most', 'poses', 'develop', 'muscles', 'even', 'mt', 'pose', 'done', 'correctly', 'abdominals', 'glutes', 'triceps.I', ""'ve"", 'friend', 'who', 'personal', 'trainer', 'always', 'been', 'thin', 'when', 'started', 'training', 'gained', '10', 'lbs', 'lost', 'dress', 'size', 'muscle', '1/3', 'volume', 'fat', 'can', 'lose', 'fat', 'gain', 'muscle', 'not', 'actually', 'lose', 'weight', 'getting', 'thinner', 'only', 'diet', 'changes', ""'ve"", 'consciously', 'made', 'are', 'drinking', 'more', 'water', 'eating', 'more', 'protein', 'regular', 'yoga', 'practice', 'helped', 'get', 'thinner', 'being', 'consistent', 'not', 'overnight', 'fix']",Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss VHS
550186,A238VS1K7S85CQ,B00004T6FM,"K. L. Hanson ""Peace Monger""","[1, 1]","First of all, let's get one thing clear - yoga, per se, was NOT designed for &#34;weight loss&#34; in the sense of cardiac/calorie burn.  As a 30-some year practitioner, I tried one of those &#34;yoga burn&#34; videos and nearly myself.  I still don't think they're safe and don't recommend them at all.However, yoga IS the perfect exercise for both mind AND body, and practiced regularly, it WILL provide wonderful improvements in body tone, strength, balance and flexibility, not to mention increased calmness of mind.  It was intended to be practiced as a smooth progression of poses, to be held for periods of time, that require concentration, strength, balance and flexibility.  It was meant to strengthen both the body AND the mind and to assist connection with spiritual practices.To me, as an experienced practitioner, this workout is absolutely perfect.  The postures are sequenced perfectly and held for a reasonable amount of time.  But the big plus over other videos I've tried is that there are other women (of various shapes and sizes) in the background performing each posture at a different level - beginner, intermediate and ultra advanced.

I have a very basic understanding of yoga, and though this workout is challenging, it wasn't too tough for a relative beginner, like me. The best part about it is that four different ladies are doing the workout, each at a different level - from fully modified to regular workout - and with the DVD, you get to choose which lady you'd like to follow! I enjoy this feature tremendously, as I look forward to moving up the levels.There is also the &quot;personal instructor&quot; feature - during the different poses, an icon will appear in the bottom right corner of your screen, telling you the personal instructor feature is available -- all you have to do is hit enter on your remote and it takes you to the &quot;yoga studio&quot; where Suzanne Deason shows you the correct positioning. Then it takes you back to the workout! Neat!The workout is 45 minutes, but it takes place in 3 sections, and you can choose if you want to do all 3 sections, or any one of them alone.Some yoga programs move too fast, but this one moves at just the right pace. The explanations of the positions are thorough enough that your eyes don't have to be glued to the TV the whole time. Suzanne Deason is gentle, respectful, and sincere.

Right from the start, the imagery and sounds are relaxing and beautiful (what a wonderful setting!) and help to place your mind in just the right zone.

Both during and after the workout - if that is the right term? - I felt relaxed and rejuventated and had no trouble following Suzanne Deason's intruction even when I wasn't able to look at the TV. Even though I was able to do the 1/4 modified workout first time, I can see myself continuing to use this DVD for a long time to come because of the effect I feel on my mind and my body. I'll definitely be integrating this one into my usual workout schedule.The DVD itself should get 10 stars. There are 4 different versions of the workout and the chaptering is placed at sensible intervals. The four versions are aimed at different fitness and flexibility levels and have different soundtracks customised for the version you are doing. I wish all fitness DVDs were like this!Suzanne is clear about what this DVD is really about; it's more about getting you onto the road to a healthier lifestyle not about shedding pounds - shame on those marketing people!

I recently tried it again and this time, I could. It is definitely for beginners, which is great because I wasn't too flexible to start. Deason is soothing, not annoying, and I find the poses challenging if I apply myself and pay attention to Deason's directions. If you have done yoga before, you will be bored and probably hate this video. But if you are just starting out, this video is perfect. It targets the major muscle groups and focuses on smooth, regulated breathing. The reviewer who complained about Deason telling students to inhale then forgetting to say &quot;exhale&quot; before she started talking should have thought about maybe breathing for themselves. Deason does not always tell you when to inhale and exhale but she did say at the beginning to concentrate on &quot;smooth regulated breathing&quot; and if you pay attention to the flow of breathing as she directs you the first few times, you can keep it up on your own. I did it on my own and found I was pretty much in sync with her. I did start to feel my core warming up a bit in the middle of the workout, but what I love the best is the relaxation at the end.

The blue mats are just striking against the background and that makes this quite visually pleasing.If you love exercising in the evening, this workout is perfect to promote a general feeling of well-being and relaxation. Suzanne Deason has created a calming escape.I have recently discovered that it is my yoga and pilatesworkouts that are helping me lose the weight. I was walkingforever and it wasn't until I started to take my yogaand pilates seriously, that I saw great results. When youdo yoga, your entire life changes for the better. So, youmake better choices for your entire body, exercise, spiritualchoices, food choices. It all flows together.I like the combination and have many DVDs and videos. So, I recommend this in addition to all the other workouts you own. Variety seems essential in keeping us all motivated!The theory behind this workout is that yoga can be used for therapeutic applications. Being overweight has a lot to do with an imbalance in your body's physiology and an internal disconnection between the mind and body.If you think about when you overeat it might be when you are feeling stressed. It is much easier to keep to your healthy nutrition plan when you feel calm and in control. I also have come to believe that when we are stressed, our bodies pack on the pounds.So, this workout gives a calmness to your being and in this way you help to control the bodies healing process.There is a 10 minute ""Body and Breath"" warm-up section to loosen the muscles and heat the core. The breathing cues are excellent and you will find yourself enjoying the deep cleansing breaths.This is followed by ""Active Yoga Conditioning."" A mirror behind you is helpful at first until you learn to moves. Or you can just do some backwards and still see the screen. Many of the poses where chosen with larger bodies in mind. This is great for people who are just starting yoga. You will notice that three of the instructors are definitely more like the ""normal size"" woman.It was comforting to me to see women who modified various poses as I often have to modify them. Instead of feeling like I could not do the poses, I felt I was reaching a level that was comfortable for me. You may also find you can do some of the poses from the advanced level and some from the modified. You feel so proud of yourself when you can finally feel comfortable doing most of the advanced poses.Finally you enter the 14 minute cool down phase called: ""Balance and Relaxation.""I find that my yoga and Pilates workout ""moments"" have become so healing and nurturing. If you wish to make your setting even more comfortable and are familiar with yoga, I would recommend a nice duvet/comforter covered in a soft fabric.

She seems to know just when you are tensing things up to achieve the best that you can, and she reminds you to relax mind, face and neck.
