1445399,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0058UHRCG,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[5, 5]","This DVD is led by Lisa Hubbard.  It offers two Pilates routines, one 20 minutes and one 30 minutes (different footage), both using the small inflatable mini ball that is included as part of the kit.  (If you happen to obtain the DVD separately, you can use any type of Pilates mini-ball or similar, such as this one:Body Back Ball.)  Hubbard instructs both routines via voiceover cuing.  She is teaching in the same outdoor set featured in the other Element workouts--a pretty garden overlooking the ocean in the background.The Main Menu offers the option to choose either the 20 or the 30 minute routine; I have described each in detail below.20 MINUTE TOTAL BODY PILATESHubbard begins this routine seated with the ball between the knees for partial rollbacks.  Moving the ball to between the shoulder blades, she performs chest lifts, adding in a twist, and a version of the single leg stretch.  She then switches the ball to between the feet for the hundred.  Following this, Hubbard completes a sequence with the ball placed under the sacrum:  exercises here include the scissors, helicopter, and bicycle.  After a brief mermaid/side stretch and a set of tricep push-ups (hands on the ball), Hubbard transitions to lying on her stomach for back extensions and butt lifts.  She concludes the workout with single leg Teaser 2 and a hip flexor stretch.30 MINUTE TOTAL BODY PILATESHubbard starts this workout standing, transitioning to the floor with a hamstring stretch.  With the ball between the knees, she performs a modified rollback, hip raises, knee drops, and pendulum.  Moving the ball to under the shoulder blades, Hubbard moves through several modified series of five exercises.  She then returns the ball to between the knees/feet for rollover, corkscrew, and rolling like a ball.  Coming to a seated position, Hubbard performs the spine twist, spine stretch forward, saw, and open-legged rocker.  She then moves into a side series which includes oblique lifts, clam, and additional glute work with the ball behind one knee.  The final series is performed face-down with the ball placed under the sternum for breast stroke prep, moving into full breast stroke.  Hubbard concludes with push-ups and the same hamstring stretch from the beginning of the routine.I really enjoyed both of these routines.  Hubbard uses the mini ball much more effectively than some of the other Pilates workouts I've tried; I found that the 30-minute routine incorporated the ball particularly well into the movements.Hubbard teaches both workouts on this DVD in a steady flow.  I have been doing Pilates for years and am at an intermediate level; I found the pace ideal, but it would probably be too fast for beginners who are unfamiliar with the exercises.  Therefore, I would recommend this DVD for advanced beginners/low intermediates and beyond.",5,Two very nice intermediate Pilates routines featuring the mini ball,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,2841,"['DVD', 'led', 'Lisa', 'Hubbard', 'two', 'Pilates', 'routines', 'one', '20', 'minutes', 'one', '30', 'minutes', 'different', 'footage', 'using', 'small', 'inflatable', 'mini', 'ball', 'included', 'part', 'kit', 'happen', 'obtain', 'DVD', 'separately', 'can', 'use', 'type', 'Pilates', 'mini-ball', 'similar', 'such', 'one', 'Body', 'Back', 'Ball', 'Hubbard', 'routines', 'voiceover', 'cuing', 'teaching', 'same', 'outdoor', 'set', 'featured', 'other', 'Element', 'workouts', 'pretty', 'garden', 'overlooking', 'ocean', 'background.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'option', 'choose', '20', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'have', 'described', 'detail', 'below.20', 'MINUTE', 'TOTAL', 'BODY', 'PILATESHubbard', 'routine', 'seated', 'ball', 'knees', 'partial', 'rollbacks', 'Moving', 'ball', 'shoulder', 'blades', 'chest', 'lifts', 'adding', 'twist', 'version', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'then', 'ball', 'feet', 'hundred', 'Following', 'Hubbard', 'sequence', 'ball', 'placed', 'sacrum', 'exercises', 'here', 'include', 'scissors', 'helicopter', 'bicycle', 'brief', 'mermaid/side', 'stretch', 'set', 'tricep', 'push-ups', 'hands', 'ball', 'Hubbard', 'transitions', 'lying', 'stomach', 'back', 'extensions', 'butt', 'lifts', 'workout', 'single', 'leg', 'Teaser', '2', 'hip', 'flexor', 'stretch.30', 'MINUTE', 'TOTAL', 'BODY', 'PILATESHubbard', 'workout', 'standing', 'transitioning', 'floor', 'hamstring', 'stretch', 'ball', 'knees', 'modified', 'rollback', 'hip', 'raises', 'knee', 'drops', 'pendulum', 'Moving', 'ball', 'shoulder', 'blades', 'Hubbard', 'several', 'modified', 'series', 'five', 'exercises', 'then', 'ball', 'knees/feet', 'rollover', 'corkscrew', 'rolling', 'ball', 'Coming', 'seated', 'position', 'Hubbard', 'spine', 'twist', 'spine', 'stretch', 'forward', 'saw', 'open-legged', 'rocker', 'then', 'side', 'series', 'oblique', 'lifts', 'clam', 'additional', 'glute', 'work', 'ball', 'one', 'knee', 'final', 'series', 'performed', 'face-down', 'ball', 'placed', 'sternum', 'breast', 'stroke', 'prep', 'moving', 'full', 'breast', 'stroke', 'Hubbard', 'push-ups', 'same', 'hamstring', 'stretch', 'beginning', 'routine.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'routines', 'Hubbard', 'mini', 'ball', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'other', 'Pilates', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'found', '30-minute', 'routine', 'incorporated', 'ball', 'particularly', 'well', 'movements.Hubbard', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'steady', 'flow', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'years', 'am', 'intermediate', 'level', 'found', 'pace', 'ideal', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'too', 'fast', 'beginners', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'exercises', 'Therefore', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'advanced', 'beginners/low', 'intermediates']",Element: Total Body Pilates w/ Toning Ball Kit

1445403,A3DI1MPX0SR87J,B0058UHRCG,livvie,"[34, 38]","I am a very picky person when it comes to working out. I only like a few pilates instructors and I just stick with them. I discovered Lisa Hubbard however, watched a few clips, and decided I wanted to try this instructor + this workout. A very good decision by me because I love Lisa's instructional style and this workout.One thing I love about element is that it takes you outside. You are working in a beautiful garden, and then out comes Lisa to explain what we're about to do. [this opening sequence is skippable if you do this workout a lot]. You have a choice between 20 minutes and a 30 minute practice - unfortuntatly, there is no 'play-all' practice.The 20 minute practice has most of my favourite workouts, the hundred, the scissors, the helicoptor, and by incorporating the ball, you can actually get into a lot of deeper moves. I love it when mermaid is done as a workout, not a stretch and Lisa uses it here as well.The 30 minute practice is a bit more challenging, including the rollover (something I mastered earlier this year), and more toning elements for the lower body, including clams and single leg pulses. The saw is also included.The ball is not something just ""tossed"" in to market a gadget, Lisa expertly uses it to mimic the reformer and the barrel. I had to put it aside sometimes because I was personally uncomfortable (I am still slightly overweight, even losing a considerable amount of weight).Lisa talks a lot, but not prattle, just constantly reminding you what you are working, how to adjust, how to breathe (CRITICAL in pilates practices!) and why you are working with the ball. It kept me focused, and reminded me of a live class.It's not overly difficult, but not quite beginner, I'd put this in a solid intermediate with some challenging moves because of the ball, and I suggest you get it. (I got a light burn in some workouts but that's the beauty of pilates. it always smacks you not when you do it, but the next day).(and the winner is, it's short enough to use as an accent to a walk/dance workout, or long enough to have a great lengthy one).",5,A Real Gem of a Workout,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2087,"['am', 'very', 'picky', 'person', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'only', 'few', 'pilates', 'instructors', 'just', 'stick', 'discovered', 'Lisa', 'Hubbard', 'however', 'watched', 'few', 'clips', 'decided', 'wanted', 'try', 'instructor', 'workout', 'very', 'good', 'decision', 'love', 'Lisa', 'instructional', 'style', 'workout.One', 'thing', 'love', 'element', 'are', 'working', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'then', 'out', 'Lisa', 'explain', 'what', ""'re"", 'do', '[', 'opening', 'sequence', 'skippable', 'do', 'workout', 'lot', ']', 'have', 'choice', '20', 'minutes', '30', 'minute', 'practice', 'unfortuntatly', ""'play-all"", 'practice.The', '20', 'minute', 'practice', 'most', 'favourite', 'workouts', 'hundred', 'scissors', 'helicoptor', 'incorporating', 'ball', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'lot', 'deeper', 'moves', 'love', 'when', 'mermaid', 'done', 'workout', 'not', 'stretch', 'Lisa', 'here', 'well.The', '30', 'minute', 'practice', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'including', 'rollover', 'something', 'mastered', 'earlier', 'year', 'more', 'toning', 'elements', 'lower', 'body', 'including', 'clams', 'single', 'leg', 'pulses', 'saw', 'also', 'included.The', 'ball', 'not', 'something', 'just', 'tossed', 'market', 'gadget', 'Lisa', 'expertly', 'mimic', 'reformer', 'barrel', 'had', 'put', 'aside', 'sometimes', 'was', 'personally', 'uncomfortable', 'am', 'still', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'even', 'losing', 'considerable', 'amount', 'weight', 'talks', 'lot', 'not', 'prattle', 'just', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'what', 'are', 'working', 'how', 'adjust', 'how', 'breathe', 'CRITICAL', 'pilates', 'practices', 'why', 'are', 'working', 'ball', 'kept', 'focused', 'reminded', 'live', 'class.It', 'not', 'overly', 'difficult', 'not', 'quite', 'beginner', ""'d"", 'put', 'solid', 'intermediate', 'challenging', 'moves', 'ball', 'suggest', 'get', 'got', 'light', 'burn', 'workouts', 'beauty', 'pilates', 'always', 'not', 'when', 'do', 'next', 'day', 'winner', 'short', 'enough', 'use', 'accent', 'walk/dance', 'workout', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'great', 'lengthy', 'one']",Element: Total Body Pilates w/ Toning Ball Kit

Don't get me wrong, you are still working out, but the instructor's voice and the setting is very calming and peaceful.
