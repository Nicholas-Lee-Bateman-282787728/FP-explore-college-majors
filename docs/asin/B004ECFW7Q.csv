1397890,AEY5XSICMGU39,B004ECFW7Q,Amazon Customer,"[8, 14]","I listened to the radio broadcast of this performance, the day it was streamed to theaters and recorded for television and DVD release.  I found it satisfactory, but not particularly outstanding Metropolitan fare.I have only today seen the production, and I found that the music was sacrificed in favor of gimmickry.  I have no great problem with minimalistic stagings, in general.  The Met's ""Romeo et Juliet"" and ""Eugene Onegin,"" for example, were quite believable.  But, in this case, the constant moving of screen panels back and forth, often without apparent reason, became very confusing as well as distracting.  Black shadows behind the screens, sometimes of characters about to appear, but often with no rhyme or reason, also drew attention from the play's action.  Black clad ""stage hands,"" sometimes waving flying birds, lanterns, or whirling streamers, sometimes moving the screen panels, and sometimes just there, further took attention away from the story.  I will grant, however, that the arrivals of characters from back stage was a good touch.While Patricia Racette's Butterfly was neither great nor terrible musically, I did feel that dramatically her interpretation missed the boat.  If I had not been familiar with the sense of ""Un bel di,"" I would have presumed from her actions and facial expressions that she had given up hope Pinkerton would ever return.The biggest disappointment to me came in Act II, with the entrance of the puppet Trouble.  I felt that all of this section was designed, not for the music or the story line, but to display the artistry of the puppeteers.  Much of the movement was unrealistic and jerky, distracting from the reality of Butterfly's dilemma.  The visibility of the puppeteers added to the lack of believability.I recognize from other reviews that this was an attempt to simulate Japanese theater.  But, if I want Japanese theater, I will look for it in other places than the opera house.Just a year before this production was recorded, the New York City Opera televised a production with Shu-Ying Li and James Valenti, which was at least the equal musically to this one, and far superior in realism.  Perhaps someone will provide this on DVD.Addendum December 17, 2011:  I just listened to the Saturday broadcast with Liping Zhang and Robert Dean Smith.  Far superior musically to the Racette/Giordano.",2,Musicality overshadowed by gimickry,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2360,"['listened', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'performance', 'day', 'was', 'streamed', 'theaters', 'recorded', 'television', 'DVD', 'release', 'found', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'Metropolitan', 'fare.I', 'have', 'only', 'today', 'seen', 'production', 'found', 'music', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'favor', 'gimmickry', 'have', 'great', 'problem', 'minimalistic', 'stagings', 'general', 'Met', 'Romeo', 'et', 'Juliet', 'Eugene', 'Onegin', 'example', 'were', 'quite', 'believable', 'case', 'constant', 'moving', 'screen', 'panels', 'back', 'forth', 'often', 'apparent', 'reason', 'became', 'very', 'confusing', 'as', 'well', 'distracting', 'Black', 'screens', 'sometimes', 'characters', 'appear', 'often', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'also', 'drew', 'attention', 'play', 'action', 'Black', 'clad', 'stage', 'hands', 'sometimes', 'waving', 'flying', 'birds', 'lanterns', 'whirling', 'streamers', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'screen', 'panels', 'sometimes', 'just', 'there', 'further', 'took', 'attention', 'away', 'story', 'will', 'grant', 'however', 'arrivals', 'characters', 'back', 'stage', 'was', 'good', 'touch.While', 'Patricia', 'Racette', 'Butterfly', 'was', 'neither', 'great', 'terrible', 'musically', 'did', 'feel', 'dramatically', 'interpretation', 'missed', 'boat', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'familiar', 'sense', 'Un', 'bel', 'di', 'would', 'have', 'presumed', 'actions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'Pinkerton', 'would', 'ever', 'return.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'came', 'Act', 'II', 'entrance', 'puppet', 'Trouble', 'felt', 'section', 'was', 'designed', 'not', 'music', 'story', 'line', 'display', 'artistry', 'puppeteers', 'Much', 'movement', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'jerky', 'distracting', 'reality', 'Butterfly', 'dilemma', 'visibility', 'puppeteers', 'added', 'lack', 'believability.I', 'recognize', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'attempt', 'simulate', 'Japanese', 'theater', 'want', 'Japanese', 'theater', 'will', 'look', 'other', 'places', 'opera', 'house.Just', 'year', 'production', 'was', 'recorded', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Opera', 'televised', 'production', 'Shu-Ying', 'Li', 'James', 'Valenti', 'was', 'least', 'equal', 'musically', 'one', 'far', 'superior', 'realism', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'will', 'provide', 'DVD.Addendum', 'December', '17', '2011', 'just', 'listened', 'Saturday', 'broadcast', 'Liping', 'Zhang', 'Robert', 'Dean', 'Smith', 'Far', 'superior', 'musically', 'Racette/Giordano']",Puccini: Madama Butterfly

1397896,AYDW2AFFLN2QH,B004ECFW7Q,"Cy Reese ""screenwriter""","[66, 69]","Since I generally prefer traditional productions, I was somewhat skeptical as I sat down to watch and hear Anthony Minghella's production of the most performed opera in the Unites States, and perhaps the world - Madama Butterfly.  Adding to my concern and curiosity was the advertised use of puppetry in this Metropolitan Opera HD series event. Let me come right to the point in this critique: this opera pulls you in! I was totally mesmerized and after three beautiful hours, felt like I should feel after hearing and viewing an opera. My reaction is not surprising when I review the different facets of this production:(1) THE SETS: yes, they are minimalist, but, when you think about it, this is one opera which doesn't really need elaborate sets; most of the drama occurs inside a Japanese house, which does indeed make use of sliding screens. The use of these screens in this production was actually quite clever and did reinforce the notion that the setting is Japan.(2) COSTUMES: credited to Han Feng; just a glorious display of color. Easily, the best costuming I've seen in any production of this opera, at least, those available on DVD.(3) THE MUSIC: Maestro Patrick Summers conducts a flawless performance of the Met's Orchestra; the music never overpowers the singers and yet, reaches our ears with the power to move us as the composer intended. Puccini would have applauded.(4) THE SINGERS: Let's begin with the title role. Cio-Cio-San (Butterfly) can be compared with that of Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet"". Ideally, one would cast a mid-teen young lady, and yet, to date, there has never been a young female actress/singer capable of expressing all the emotions that their character calls for. In the PAST world of opera, one had to be content with a soprano up to the demands of a role such as Madama Butterfly, that calls for an almost continuous stage presence from the middle of the first act until the end of the third and final act. Historically, singing ability was the criterion, making factors such as age and appearance, irrelevant.  (Examples: a grossly overweight Pavarotti as a ""handsome"" Radames in Aida; a sixty-year old Sutherland as ""the Daughter"" of the Regiment in an Australian Opera production.) BUT, in TODAY'S world, where operatic productions are being filmed as well as recorded - where the visual aspects of a production will be important to the sale of DVDs and Blu Ray discs - singers are being groomed who cannot only sing but who are believable as the characters they represent. Thinks of handsome tenors such as Florez, Villazon and Kaufmann; beautiful sopranos like Netrebko, attractive mezzos like Garanca and baritones like Keenlyside, etc. I submit that Patricia Racette strikes a good balance between youth and experience and is here a very convincing Butterfly. I do not agree with those reviewers who found some faults with her voice; I, for one, did not detect any, and indeed, of the seven DVDs I own of this opera, her death scene is the best both vocally and dramatically.All of the principal singers were in good form the day they recorded this production.  Tenor Marcello Giordani, whose rendition of ""Nessun Dorma"" in the Met's last production of ""Turandot"", compared with Pavarotti's, impresses me here with his clarity of tone and ability to portray Pinkerton, not as a villain but as a flawed human being who does not realize the tragic consequences of his amorous affair with his Japanese bride. Dwayne Croft, a veteran of the Met, as Sharpless, is a good example of why baritones today are being afforded the prominence once reserved to their tenor colleagues.  As Suzuki, Maria Zifchak, another Met stalwart, is able to bring out all the nuances in her character; she is not just Butterfly's servant, but companion in suffering. I was particularly impressed by her actually coming to tears when she is about to inform her mistress of Pinkerton's new wife.(5) THE USE OF PUPPETS: Easily, this is the most controversial aspect of this production. It shouldn't be. A cardinal rule in criticism is that one shouldn't condemn a work one hasn't read, seen or heard. That rule applies here. Even though several puppets were employed in this production (several servants and one of Butterfly in a ballet scene), the one puppet who manages to captivate the audience is Butterfly's young son. Of all the child actors who have been cast in this part, THIS PUPPET IS THE FINEST OF THEM ALL! No three-year old would be capable of portraying awe, happiness, wonderment, sadness, and affection in the way that this three-foot tall ""artificial child"" has managed to do it. Great credit, of course, must be given to his three black-clad handlers, but after a while, they seem to disappear in the viewer's eye and mind. Please do not let the idea of puppets deter you from experiencing this magnificent production. You will be captivated by their use and might just forget that they are in the production.(6) BUTTERFLY'S DEATH SCENE: has been described by other reviewers. Such a simple idea: use red cloth to symbolize blood. But add light effects and I could have sworn that the entire stage was covered with Cio-Cio-San's blood. Very effective, and coupled with Puccini's dramatic music, a powerful ending.",5,Puppets?

Patricia Racette is wonderful as Butterfly.  Her voice is easy to hear with a nice squillo - she never sounds pushed or fatigued all the way to the end.  She is strong throughout all her registers.  She looks small enough and her costumes help in adding a small look to her.  The Suzuki, Maria Zifchak, is wonderful.  Giordani as Pinkerton is in good voice, and he strikes a very handsome officer.  Croft is in good enough voice to execute Sharpless without problem.The puppets are wonderful.  You generally have a real little boy playing the child and he's usually a bit out of place because there is quite a bit of stage-time but nothing for him to do as he is never a trained actor.  But these skilled puppeteers have the little boy moving about displaying emotions by the movement of the puppet's body that is completely enchanting, and the child's emotions add rather than detract from the drama.The second puppet is a representation of Butterfly dancing with a real human dancer representing Pinkerton in a short ballet.  (Yes, the puppets are so charming, they can make a ballet in an opera seem too short. Hopefully, the 'Butterfly' puppet will get larger roles as her career blossoms. ;0) )The sets are nice and so are the costumes.  Butterfly and Pinkerton could not be made to look better.

1397900,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B004ECFW7Q,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[35, 38]","When I first read about Minghella's production I had serious doubts, but everyone I knew (well, almost) who saw it in London, then here, had nothing but raves. I still had doubts going in, but was instantly won over by every element of it.  The lighting, costumes, unit set and the never less than startling use of color is breathtaking.Racette's Butterfly is one of the finest I've encountered and here she is positively shattering.  (Special kudos go to her for rescuing this performance at the last minute, coming in from Washington, DC where she was in final rehearsals for ""Peter Grimes."")  Yes, she can flat a little, or start a note less than dead center of pitch, but in this performance there is almost none of that.  Several moments are, in fact, so vocally perfect I find myself completely overwhelmed; most notably ""Che tua madre"" and the end of her great narration before the Cherry Blossom duet. In the latter Racette holds the final note for near eternity, the voice growing in a crescendo that nearly covered the orchestra (I've never heard this from her before) and as she let go of the note, she collapsed, fainting to the floor (in an earlier performance,  the house erupted into a huge ovation).Giordani is having a good day, as well, and always believable as Pinkerton.  In Minghella's stunning setting he and Racette exploit two violently clashing cultures: Butterfly all delicate movement, darting and hiding all over the stage - behind lanterns, in the shadows, etc. creating a shy, excitable child while Pinkerton, barely controlling his passion, hunted her, grabbing her passionately as she jumps into his arms, then catching and holding her aloft, removing her outer garments, etc.  Two vastly different worlds colliding and trapped perfectly in Puccini's inescapable web.  If there is a more erotically charged romantic duet in all of opera than Butterfly & Pinkerton's, I don't know itThe Puppet Sorrow.  I'd adopt him if I could (but would go broke trying to feed and clothe his handlers!)  Racette's interactions with him were infinitely more touching than I've seen with any ""real"" child, lending a certain heightened hyper-realism I've not experienced before.  (During intermission Racette, (unaware the camera was on her)  prepares for the final act, climbing down onto the floor and addressing him ""Okay, Baby . . . sleepytime, baby!"" as she placed his head onto her lap positioning herself for curtain's rise.  (At the HD presentation the entire theatre cracked up here and earlier when Giordani carried her offstage, Racette finally breaking character chortled ""Thanks for carrying me ass first towards the camera, Marcello!"")Racette is a throwback to the style of singing of generations ago, singers willing to cross the line and ""become"" the character, using ""old school diva tricks"" like whispering, muttering, crying, giggling, groaning - all manner of ""extramusical"" devices which were pretty much all but  eliminated from opera since the late 70's.Dwyane Croft has grown to become perhaps the finest Sharpless in my experience.  Gorgeous of voice, and offering a richly nuanced portrayal, evoking a worldly, but sympathetic masculinity while remaining impotent - an outsider who understands but is unable to prevent the tragedy he finds himself a part of.Even the way the bows are presented is theatrical, and when the stage is bare, Cio Cio San appears at the top of the set an absolute ROAR went up from the house - and as she slowly made her way down to the footlights almost the entire house stood cheering. Breathtaking moment and Racette was visibly moved by the response.This is a unique and special Butterfly and I'm thrilled to see it being released on DVD where it should do well.",5,Minghella's Marvelous Met Butterfly,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,3733,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'Minghella', 'production', 'had', 'serious', 'doubts', 'everyone', 'knew', 'well', 'almost', 'who', 'saw', 'London', 'then', 'here', 'had', 'nothing', 'still', 'had', 'doubts', 'going', 'was', 'instantly', 'won', 'over', 'element', 'lighting', 'costumes', 'unit', 'set', 'never', 'less', 'startling', 'use', 'color', 'breathtaking.Racette', 'Butterfly', 'one', 'finest', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'here', 'positively', 'shattering', 'Special', 'kudos', 'go', 'rescuing', 'performance', 'last', 'minute', 'coming', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'was', 'final', 'rehearsals', 'Peter', 'Grimes', 'Yes', 'can', 'flat', 'little', 'start', 'note', 'less', 'dead', 'center', 'pitch', 'performance', 'almost', 'none', 'Several', 'moments', 'are', 'fact', 'so', 'vocally', 'perfect', 'find', 'completely', 'overwhelmed', 'most', 'notably', 'Che', 'tua', 'madre', 'end', 'great', 'narration', 'Cherry', 'Blossom', 'duet', 'latter', 'Racette', 'final', 'note', 'near', 'eternity', 'voice', 'growing', 'crescendo', 'nearly', 'covered', 'orchestra', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'let', 'go', 'note', 'collapsed', 'fainting', 'floor', 'earlier', 'performance', 'house', 'erupted', 'huge', 'ovation', '.Giordani', 'having', 'good', 'day', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'believable', 'Pinkerton', 'Minghella', 'stunning', 'setting', 'Racette', 'exploit', 'two', 'violently', 'clashing', 'cultures', 'Butterfly', 'delicate', 'movement', 'darting', 'hiding', 'stage', 'lanterns', 'shadows', 'etc', 'creating', 'shy', 'excitable', 'child', 'Pinkerton', 'barely', 'controlling', 'passion', 'hunted', 'grabbing', 'passionately', 'arms', 'then', 'catching', 'holding', 'aloft', 'removing', 'outer', 'garments', 'etc', 'Two', 'vastly', 'different', 'worlds', 'colliding', 'trapped', 'perfectly', 'Puccini', 'inescapable', 'web', 'more', 'erotically', 'charged', 'romantic', 'duet', 'opera', 'Butterfly', 'Pinkerton', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'itThe', 'Puppet', 'Sorrow', ""'d"", 'adopt', 'could', 'would', 'go', 'broke', 'trying', 'feed', 'clothe', 'handlers', 'Racette', 'interactions', 'were', 'infinitely', 'more', 'touching', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'child', 'lending', 'certain', 'heightened', 'hyper-realism', ""'ve"", 'not', 'experienced', 'intermission', 'Racette', 'camera', 'was', 'final', 'act', 'climbing', 'down', 'floor', 'addressing', 'Okay', 'Baby', 'sleepytime', 'baby', 'placed', 'head', 'lap', 'positioning', 'curtain', 'rise', 'HD', 'presentation', 'entire', 'theatre', 'cracked', 'up', 'here', 'earlier', 'when', 'Giordani', 'carried', 'offstage', 'Racette', 'finally', 'breaking', 'character', 'chortled', 'Thanks', 'carrying', 'first', 'camera', 'Marcello', 'Racette', 'throwback', 'style', 'singing', 'generations', 'singers', 'willing', 'cross', 'line', 'become', 'character', 'using', 'old', 'school', 'diva', 'tricks', 'whispering', 'muttering', 'crying', 'giggling', 'groaning', 'manner', 'extramusical', 'devices', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'eliminated', 'opera', 'late', ""70's.Dwyane"", 'Croft', 'grown', 'become', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'Sharpless', 'experience', 'Gorgeous', 'voice', 'offering', 'richly', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'evoking', 'worldly', 'sympathetic', 'masculinity', 'remaining', 'impotent', 'outsider', 'who', 'unable', 'prevent', 'tragedy', 'part', 'way', 'bows', 'are', 'presented', 'theatrical', 'when', 'stage', 'bare', 'Cio', 'Cio', 'San', 'top', 'set', 'absolute', 'ROAR', 'went', 'up', 'house', 'slowly', 'made', 'way', 'footlights', 'almost', 'entire', 'house', 'stood', 'cheering', 'Breathtaking', 'moment', 'Racette', 'was', 'visibly', 'moved', 'response.This', 'unique', 'special', 'Butterfly', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'see', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'where', 'should', 'do', 'well']",Puccini: Madama Butterfly
1397901,A3O991G7YKUEWS,B004ECFW7Q,Jaydoggy,"[53, 58]","Anthony Minghella's new staging of Madama Butterfly is a fascinating mix of traditional theater from both Europe and Japan. This new production seems to have finally been released on DVD due to its online popularity and requests. This is the third production of a Madama Butterfly I've seen (I'm still pretty new to opera), and currently stands at my favorite.The role of Butterfly is rather infamous; it's one of the most difficult roles both on a physical and psychological level (even the great Leontyne Price said she found the tragic role almost too painful to continue). The physical element requires a much more mature voice and powerful voice, thus nearly all people who play the role will have to be older than a 16-year-old girl. Racette may not be 16, but her body language, costume and makeup certainly make her look young, naive, and innocent. Though she doesn't look Japanese, this is definitely not the first opera I've seen in which a particular ethnicity is not matched by the performer (others include Otello, Turandot, or Atilla). Turn on the suspension of disbelief.Her acting, body language and emotion were all there, but as another reviewer pointed out, her voice was not entirely there. As she went higher, her vibrato got too wide and even wobbly to the point that the center note was not as distinguishable. I found Act I to be the best part while Act II (sadly including Un bel di) to be the most wobbly and thin. Though it was a bit of a let-down, I was still fully immersed in the story and could see (and hear as the case may be) past the issues. Act III improved from Act II, though yes still the top notes wobbled. All in all though, I cannot say I was disappointed; it still shook me up.Marcello Giordani's Pinkerton had a different sound and interpretation as others before him. It appears his Pinkerton is not necessarily cold or evil, but rather he's totally ignorant of exactly how terrible a thing he's doing. Giordani's interpretation has Pinkerton entering as a man filled with pride, thinking his culture is simply better while taking advantage of another culture guilt-free. He only suddenly feels guilt when he realizes he has his son, in which case he almost goes in for self-pity. Having interacted with people with similar vain self-pity issue, I found this interpretation very believable. It's different, but still a psychologically fascinating and realistic approach. Like Racette, his upper register was a disappointment. His voice was full, but the sound itself didn't seem to match his current emotion; the first act he sounded tragic too soon, which made his guilt and self-pity in Act III a little less powerful. Still, his acting and performance was enough to make him believable and conniving as any Pinkerton.Dwayne Croft's Sharpless was probably the best I've seen and heard. Voice, face, emotion, acting, all of it was there. He's the only voice of reason, and he really shows his character as feeling a deep guilt for not speaking up or doing more to prevent the tragedy from happening. Maria Zifchak's Suzuki was the only real let-down for me. I don't know enough of her singing to know whether this is normal or just a bad day, but her voice seemed to have a lot of problems centering on a note. Though her character is a pessimist, I found her acting a little over-the-top and hard to believe. Still, her character still provides a good contrast to the naivety of Butterfly which Racette displays very well.The use of puppets in this production seemed to stir a lot of controversy, especially with the role of Dolore (Butterfly and Pinkerton's son). I simply am confused with the controversy, perhaps I'm missing something because it is not in the least bit tasteless. The suspension of disbelief allows us to accept that Japanese and American people are singing back and forth to each other in Italian. Further, the portrayal of Japan in this opera (and the original short story and other adaptations of the tale) has a warped vision of Japan. The fact that the leading character has ""san"" at the end as an actual part of her name (rather than the fact that it's a title, thus not part of her name) shows some ignorance. If the suspension of disbelief allows this, then it can allow us to accept that the puppet is the boy. Perhaps the controversy was because of the West's image of puppetry. In Japan, puppet theater is essential, and it was done here accurately; three people shrouded in black control the puppet.Traditionally in puppet theater the whole show is puppets rather than a single character. But I found the juxtaposition really fascinating and above all: tasteful. I've seen a lot of obnoxious regietheater productions (all of which claim they're trying to bring in a new audience, yet I'm in this new audience and they confuse me more than anything. Of course when I say that, they immediately change my position and accuse me of conservative snobbery! Cognitive dissonance in the artistic world). Nothing was over-the-top in this production with the one exception being the end of Act I (the ""long duet"" as it seems to be referred to) where Pinkerton and Butterfly were surrounded by floating, dancing lanterns. The addition of short mimed moments were also nice touches. It begins with a woman dancing with a pair of fans to pure silence on an empty, red stage. It immediately immerses you in in this foreign world.All in all, I found this to be an astounding performance. Madama Butterfly is not a personal favorite show of mine (perhaps I am biased because I studied a lot of its history and art). Incidents similar to the events in Madama Butterfly though did happen, and certainly show a shameful moment in the West's History. The visually stunning production with an accurate mix of traditional theater from both a Western perspective (proper costumes and acting) and Eastern one (proper costumes, puppet theater, mime/gestures, and certain uses of props) make this a unique treat to watch. The voices were a let-down at times, but it didn't stop me from enjoying it by any means.I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone. It must be entered with a bit of background information on Puppet Theater, but that could be something as simple as a search for a video on Youtube. If the idea is foreign to you, give it a try. Traditional Japanese Theater has some fascinating elements, and perhaps this interesting production will spark some more interest in it. The performance was believable nearly the entire time, and the singing throughout was mostly perfect. There may have been rough patches, but it definitely didn't ruin it for me.",4,A melting pot of traditional theaters and a mixed bag of voices.,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,6619,"['Anthony',

1397904,AEGYKCHYY809X,B004ECFW7Q,John Chandler,"[8, 10]","Butterfly is always difficult to cast - mature caucasian sopranos just cannot look the part and of course the rest of the Japanese roles are similar. In recent years a large number of brilliant Asian singers, mostly from China and Korea, have appeared and it is disappointing they do not get selected more often for operas like Butterfly abd Turandot, particularly when Blu-ray discs are planned as they just make the visual side so much more realistic. It is no longer acceptable to say visual appearances don't matter. Having said that, this production makes a good attempt to disguise their Italian cast through skilled costume design and mostly one can overlook the obvious. Butterfly herself however is more difficult. Angeletti has a huge nose, rather large feet and in close ups her dental structure is very prominent. She tries hard and sings well but just does not remotely look like a 15 year old geisha. In the interlude between the two scenes in the second act, a short ballet appears that I felt added nothing to the production, but it was just odd and not a serious distraction.The sets, lighting and sound were excellent considering this is an open air theatre. Full marks to the producers. This is thankfully a traditional production set in old Japan. No transfer to a bordello in Genoa or other modern nonsence! Sharpless was well sung and Pinkerton a really nasty cad as he is of course depicted in the story.

1397905,A1DNGEVLPD4ALH,B004ECFW7Q,Juan Morales,"[1, 1]","I wasn't going to write a review but after reading some of the ""bad"" reviews here, figured I would put in my two cents.  In my opinion, this is will probably be ""the"" Madama Butterfly against which future productions of this opera will be rated against.  I have to say I am not a huge fan of minimalist productions, but sometimes they work and sometimes they dont. My biggest problem is when those productions take liberties with the libretto in order to make it fit. This production though I must say it worked perfectly.  How can you not be moved when they were singing the love duet at the end of the first act!  All I kept thinking was God I need to go to New York and see this live!!.  I do have to say that for all her popularity - Patricia Racette might not be ""the"" best Butterfly ever vocally, but she was not as awful as some reviewer here makes her out to be.  You do have to admit her acting was incredible, which is more than you can say for some singers these day that feel that all they need to get by on the opera stage is hit a few high notes and look pretty while doing it.  One thing I must mention and this holds true of any telecast.  What looks good on the stage while you are sitting a few feet away from it, does not necessarily look good close up.  When they decide to tape these performances,  they need to have some sort of rehearsal and make changes or study screen shots.  No matter how good these are, there are instances when the camera comes too close for comfort and it is not a pretty sight!!",5,A Butterfly for the Ages,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1526,"['was', ""n't"", 'going', 'write', 'review', 'reading', 'bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'figured', 'would', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'opinion', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', 'future', 'productions', 'opera', 'will', 'be', 'rated', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'minimalist', 'productions', 'sometimes', 'work', 'sometimes', 'dont', 'biggest', 'problem', 'when', 'productions', 'take', 'liberties', 'libretto', 'order', 'make', 'fit', 'production', 'must', 'say', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'when', 'were', 'singing', 'love', 'duet', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'God', 'need', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'live', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'popularity', 'Patricia', 'Racette', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Butterfly', 'ever', 'vocally', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'awful', 'reviewer', 'here', 'out', 'be', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'singers', 'day', 'feel', 'need', 'get', 'opera', 'stage', 'hit', 'few', 'high', 'notes', 'look', 'pretty', 'doing', 'One', 'thing', 'must', 'mention', 'true', 'telecast', 'What', 'good', 'stage', 'are', 'sitting', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'not', 'necessarily', 'look', 'good', 'close', 'up', 'When', 'decide', 'tape', 'performances', 'need', 'have', 'sort', 'rehearsal', 'make', 'changes', 'study', 'screen', 'shots', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'are', 'instances', 'when', 'camera', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight']",Puccini: Madama Butterfly
1397906,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B004ECFW7Q,Keris Nine,"[3, 4]","I know it's one of the most performed and most popular crowd-pleasers in the opera repertoire, but so perfect an opera is Madama Butterfly, that it doesn't need any modern revisionism or high concept staging, since it already works on multiple levels.  If you just want it to see it as a straightforward clash between Japanese and American culture that inevitably results in tragedy, then that's more than enough for it to work successfully.  There are however other clashes, divisions and incompatibilities brought out in the opera - from the division of imperialism and isolationism, destiny or self-determination, modernity versus tradition to simply the clash of ideals between men and women in respect of what each of them hope to gain from a relationship.  All these ideas exist in Madama Butterfly, and some of them can be tweaked for emphasis in individual productions, but they are all there to be drawn out by the listener in even the most basic of stagings.Directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi, this production for the Sferisterio Opera Festival in Macerata in 2009 isn't exactly basic, but it is fairly traditional, aiming for a stylised Japanese setting with silk kimonos, bamboo and paper houses on wooden struts and a cherry tree in bloom.  Puccini's Madama Butterfly can bear such idealism, since in many respects, there is an unrealistic idealism in the minds of the two main protagonists, the American sailor B.F. Pinkerton and the young 15 year-old Japanese bride he has bought, Cio-Cio-San, known as Butterfly - both clearly have different ideas about what they expect to gain out of this arrangement.  This production makes use of the interlude music after the Humming Song to introduce a dreamlike ballet sequence that depicts this idealised version of the relationship, perhaps in Butterfly's mind as she sleeps awaiting the return of Pinkerton, and it's a nice touch that works very well with this idea.The other notable thing about this production is the open-air performance at the arena which is not traditionally theatre shaped.  The long wings to the side of the stage however are well used for processional marches, as well as giving a greater sense of isolation of Cio-Cio-San from the world outside.  The walls behind the stage however do add to the reverb on the voices, but not in any overly detrimental way.  It does tend to lend a stridency to the singing of Raffaella Angeletti who can certainly hold the high notes as Butterfly, but doesn't have the delicacy that is required in other passages.  She does however certainly deliver where she needs to.  Massimiliano Pisapia is a robust and traditional Pinkerton, alternating between confidence and cowardice, between being arrogant and being loving.  I liked the tone of his voice here throughout.  Claudio Sgura's Sharpless demonstrates good clear diction, but the microphone or the mixing gives his voice too much reverb, and consequently both his voice and Angeletti's can occasionally be a little piercing in places.Overall however, the singing is good and this is a fine production of Madama Butterfly, presented on a fine Blu-ray with a strong picture and - allowing for the slight extra reverb of the open-air location - good sound-mixes in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.",4,Fine Butterfly,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,3266,"['know', 'one', 'most', 'performed', 'most', 'popular', 'crowd-pleasers', 'opera', 'repertoire', 'so', 'perfect', 'opera', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', ""n't"", 'need', 'modern', 'revisionism', 'high', 'concept', 'staging', 'already', 'multiple', 'levels', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'straightforward', 'clash', 'Japanese', 'American', 'culture', 'inevitably', 'results', 'tragedy', 'then', 'more', 'enough', 'work', 'successfully', 'are', 'however', 'other', 'clashes', 'divisions', 'incompatibilities', 'brought', 'out', 'opera', 'division', 'imperialism', 'isolationism', 'destiny', 'self-determination', 'modernity', 'versus', 'tradition', 'simply', 'clash', 'ideals', 'men', 'women', 'respect', 'what', 'hope', 'gain', 'relationship', 'ideas', 'exist', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', 'can', 'be', 'tweaked', 'emphasis', 'individual', 'productions', 'are', 'be', 'drawn', 'out', 'listener', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'stagings.Directed', 'Pier', 'Luigi', 'Pizzi', 'production', 'Sferisterio', 'Opera', 'Festival', 'Macerata', '2009', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'basic', 'fairly', 'traditional', 'aiming', 'stylised', 'Japanese', 'setting', 'silk', 'kimonos', 'bamboo', 'paper', 'houses', 'wooden', 'struts', 'cherry', 'tree', 'bloom', 'Puccini', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', 'can', 'bear', 'such', 'idealism', 'many', 'respects', 'unrealistic', 'idealism', 'minds', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'American', 'sailor', 'B.F.', 'Pinkerton', 'young', '15', 'year-old', 'Japanese', 'bride', 'bought', 'Cio-Cio-San', 'known', 'Butterfly', 'clearly', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'what', 'expect', 'gain', 'arrangement', 'production', 'use', 'interlude', 'music', 'Humming', 'Song', 'introduce', 'dreamlike', 'ballet', 'sequence', 'idealised', 'version', 'relationship', 'perhaps', 'Butterfly', 'mind', 'awaiting', 'return', 'Pinkerton', 'nice', 'touch', 'very', 'well', 'idea.The', 'other', 'notable', 'thing', 'production', 'open-air', 'performance', 'arena', 'not', 'traditionally', 'theatre', 'shaped', 'long', 'wings', 'side', 'stage', 'however', 'are', 'well', 'used', 'processional', 'marches', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'greater', 'sense', 'isolation', 'Cio-Cio-San', 'world', 'walls', 'stage', 'however', 'do', 'add', 'reverb', 'voices', 'not', 'overly', 'detrimental', 'way', 'tend', 'lend', 'stridency', 'singing', 'Raffaella', 'Angeletti', 'who', 'can', 'certainly', 'hold', 'high', 'notes', 'Butterfly', ""n't"", 'have', 'delicacy', 'required', 'other', 'passages', 'however', 'certainly', 'deliver', 'where', 'Massimiliano', 'Pisapia', 'robust', 'traditional', 'Pinkerton', 'alternating', 'confidence', 'cowardice', 'being', 'arrogant', 'being', 'loving', 'liked', 'tone', 'voice', 'here', 'Claudio', 'Sgura', 'Sharpless', 'good', 'clear', 'diction', 'microphone', 'mixing', 'voice', 'too', 'much', 'reverb', 'consequently', 'voice', 'Angeletti', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'little', 'piercing', 'places.Overall', 'however', 'singing', 'good', 'fine', 'production', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', 'presented', 'fine', 'Blu-ray', 'strong', 'picture', 'allowing', 'slight', 'extra', 'reverb', 'open-air', 'location', 'good', 'sound-mixes', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'DTS', 'HD-Master', 'Audio', '5.1']",Puccini: Madama Butterfly

Here is an opera which brings me to tears, just relating its plot, but watching this incisive, dehumanized treatment does not get any tears from me.  Not a solitary tear, and I tried it two times live.  This opera is like onions, I always cry.Why is there a puppet for the child?  I know ..  authentic Japanese art form.  Come on man, this is an Italian opera.  This is Puccini.  He's trying to make you feel for the woman and the child, and sympathise with their plight.  This is an opera where you are supposed to feel, and to think about feelings, and to think about people you love.  How am I supposed to feel about a puppet with three guys running around it, administering its movements?  I wind up marveling at their dexterity, and totally distracted.They've done a nice job with the pretty dresses.  Very colorful.The Met has gone downhill so fast.  Why couldn't they take out the failed productions, instead of overrun the successful ones?The previous production of this, as for so many operas, didn't distract me with cleverness or starkness, mixed media, or other overwrought random surprises, but focused my attention on the drama by faithfully and natively creating a visual for me which I could sink my mind into and asborb the plot.Another mindless extravagance is the new Traviata, w bare wall, the oversized clock, and staring man bearing down on us, signifying 'Time'.  Every bit of these things serves to isolate my compassion, and beat it like a slave to be mastered.It would be appropriate to pair sets like this w Lulu or Die Frau Ohne Shotten, or something from Reich or Kraftwerk which suggests a disconnected, dehumanized society.  Not this opera, a sensitive human drama.Clearly, WW1 really got into Europe's nerves.  The Dada movement, and ever since, it's been about desecrating, destroying, stripping down, reassembling.  Meanwhile, these Europeans will fret about 'authentic' instrumentation, while they're reimagining Carmen as a gas station attendant.  Gratuitous novelty, intellectual immaturity, and cynicism.On top of that, we have the Met now pushing for some more Broadway flavored shtick, for people w attention deficit disorder or simpler standards.  They're trying to wow the crowd w affects.  I'm not going to waste my time or my money until I hear about a change.The Met used to be a good bargain.

1397911,A2NS79048TBDPF,B004ECFW7Q,"Paul Pelkonen ""Superconductor""","[2, 6]","This innovative staging of Madama Butterfly was the first staging of Peter Gelb's tenure as general maager of the Met. Staged by Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) set the tone for much that has followed: bright colors, stripped-down sets, and above all, a Big Name at the helm of a much-hyped new production of a repertory staple. But whatever weird turns the Met has taken in the last five years, this remains the visual record of an important Butterfly that marked the start of a new artistic era.This two-disc set, released on Sony Classics earlier this year, preserves the Met Live in HD broadcast of Butterfly, starring Patricia Racette as Cio-Cio San and Maria Zifchak as her faithful housemaid Suzuki. It also serves as a fitting memorial to Mr. Minghella, who died one year before this telecast was filmed. Happily, this is a brilliant rendering of Puccini's opera, with dramatic and scenic focus on the tragedy at hand.Rather than some attempt to recreate the landscape of pre-atomic Nagasaki on the Met's vast stage, Mr. Minghella took this work back to its Japanese roots, incorporating elements of Noh theater. Butterfly's hillside house becomes a ""zoned"" acting space, cut through with small, sliding shoji. Black-clad kuroko stagehands move, ghost-like through its movable walls. Colorful, authentic Japanese costumes are very much a feature, from the elaborate kimonos to Goro's bobbing kanmuri hat, worn to inappropriate, (and hilarious) effect by this glorified pimp. The most famous effect though, is the controversial use of bunraku puppets, most notably to play Butterfly's son, ""Trouble.""This is a high-level performance of the opera, anchored by the veteran soprano of Ms. Racette. She understands every aspect of the character, creating a Buttrfly who rapidly travels the downward slide from innocent geisha bride to unwed mother and suicide. Her potent ""Un bel di"" is the keystone of the entire performance, but it is the seemingly spontaneous moments like her Act II interactions with Sharpless (Dwayne Croft) and Yamadori (David Won) that help this Butterfly soar.Mr. Giordani is in good voice as Pinkerton, portraying one of the most ungrateful louses to grace the operatic stage. The Act I interactions with Goro (Greg Fedderly) and Butterfly's large family show the character's blithe ignorance of Japanese culture, which contrast with his noble, ringing tenor with just the right amount of squillo for ""America, Forever!"" Mr. Fedderly is just right as Goro, an absolute sleaze, decked out an overdone costume complete with bobbing kanmuri hat. As Sharpless, Dwayne Croft is a fine actor, although his once keen baritone sounds faded and dull.When Butterfly's child is unveiled, the performance jumps to a higher energy level. Ms. Racette draws on new reserves of power as Butterfly's downward skid gets steeper. The fact that she is focusing all her maternal and musical energies on a puppet makes the scene even more moving and disturbing. The flawlessly sung flower duet with Suzuki acquires a demented, surreal aspect as the flowers are plucked from silent, black-clad stagehands. The image underscores the difference between Butterfly's forced optimism and the harsh reality of the final scene.When Lt. Jerkwad (excuse me, Pinkerton) shows up with his wife in tow, the bottom drops out of Butterfly's heart. Ms. Racette sings the hollow realization with dark, dusky tones, undercut with terrible resolve as she sings her farewell to Suzuki. Patrick Summers is particularly good here, letting the silence speak for itself after leading two hours of stellar music in the orchestra pit.

The karajan/Freni held up for the above mentioned time very well, despite slow conducting and a grainy picture. Still, if you don't like the new one, it is probably still tops on the video scene. Regarding the Butterfies, Racette outdid herself, and is very close to Freni in performance. The supporting cast is also very good.

1397913,A3DT7D2KEJLR38,B004ECFW7Q,R. Ramon,"[5, 6]","I saw the summer re-run of Madame Butterfly, having unfortunately missed the original HD broadcast. It was actually rather nice that they did away with the original intermission(s), as this helped maintain the dramatic flow of the evening. Minghella was such an intelligent, thoughtful and poetic director, one of my favorites, and I eagerly looked forward to his production. He did not disappoint. His stagecraft, and what has been referred to as ""minimalist"" style, were potent without being either over- or under-done and made excellent use of the space on stage. The beautiful and vibrant costuming also added much to his visual style. I liked his use of the smooth-moving screens and also the lanterns. I thought his use of a puppet for Butterfly's son was brilliant. The puppeteers expertly gave him fine nuance and gesture and succeeded in creating a credible and dramatic performance. Some reviewers said the black-clad figures operating him were a distraction, but one must remember that opera is a distance medium; it's not likely a viewer in the audience (especially in the cavernous Met) would have noticed their movements nearly as much as the closeup view given by the camera on the lip of the stage gave. I found it amazing that the inanimate face of the puppet almost seemed to take on different expressions according to the subtle movements of his head and neck, in harmony with the rest of his body. It was mesmerizing.The singing was uniformly good to very good, with Patricia Racette outstanding as Butterfly. Her lovely voice has a clarity and thrust which allows her to be heard at any dynamic, but one never sensed her applying vocal technique for emphasis on top of her touching characterization. When her voice bloomed in arching phrases, it was always with expressive emotion. Singing and acting were absolutely fused together in her performance, and she was rightly rewarded with a huge ovation at the end. Yes, she is nowhere near fifteen hears old, and she is neither trim or slender; but when she sang in a voice like springtime, those details mattered much less to me. She really captured the spirit and naivete of a young girl coming into adulthood under tragic circumstances. Maria Zifchak was a solid and sympathetic Suzuki, and also offered a voice of beauty and clarity, blending well with Racette. The men's roles were slightly less satisfying to me. Marcello Giordani is one today's front ranking tenors and Puccini's music suits his soaring voice well. However, I found his characterization a bit pale in comparison to Racette's, and at times his top notes sounded rough and oversung. Dwayne Croft as Sharpless was a sympathetic actor and dramatically held his own with the rest of the cast; sadly, his voice seems to have the lost some of its point and sheen, although he always phrases with beauty and musicality. Greg Fedderly as Goro was sharp in both characterization and voice. The steely quality of his tenor would probably serve him well in a Wagner role such as Mime.The theatre audience to seemed genuinely enjoy the performance, often joining the Met audience in moments of applause. For me, it was everything I'd hoped for. I have seen Butterfly at the San Francisco Opera house with Catherine Malfitano, another fine singing actress, as Butterfly, and I've come to realize how crucial it is to have a singer of these qualities in this demanding role. When you get artists of the caliber of Racette and Minghella, you can be sure you will experience a performance of superior quality and artistic excellence. The world of cinema and theatre lost a treasure when Minghella passed away in 2008.

I have nothing to complain about the quality of the recording, its crystal clear resolution and the performance from the players. Very good sets, the costumes though tacky, are passable and the ambiance created on stage is lovely. Introduction of the ballet before last scene was actually quite pleasant and innovative.What spoils this production is the clarity of the blu ray!!!!This medium is for people to enjoy in their living rooms with close ups unimaginable in the hall, and the freedom to see and listen to the disc or parts of it repeatedly. It is a pure visual experience which has to be chosen with some sensitivity to its viewing public as well as the visual experience itself. Otherwise, a well recorded CD would do the job superbly.Angeletti is certainly qualified and gives a mature display of her talents, but unfortunately in this blu ray, she looks closer to 50 than 15. That itself is a put-off...thoroughly unconvincing to say the least to a blu ray viewer. She would be and will be magnificent on the stage any day, even today to those sitting beyond 15 rows in the theater. But don't 'shoot' her for close-ups please.All the others do their job quite very well, but the above factor by itself makes one want to switch off the screen and listen to the performance rather than view it.The make-up is shoddy to say the least, and makes the girls look as though the talcum-powder ran out midway through the process.A GOOD PERFORMANCE DOTH NOT A GOOD BLU-RAY MAKE, is my verdict on this.

Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[3, 4]","""Madame Butterfly"" is one of Puccini's greatest operas, which says a lot considering most of his operas are so utterly brilliant. It's loaded with emotion from outrageous passion to unquenchable grief. I cannot imagine anyone seeing Butterfly, especially this production, keeping a dry eye. It's just heart wrenching. No one since Puccini has been able to evoke such emotion in music.Of course, he had a whopper of a tragic story. And it is the story that I find annoying because the tragedy is so blatantly the result of utter selfishness on the part of a lead love interest. None of it had to happen. But then, Puccini wouldn't have had such a great vehicle for his outstanding talent.So I love ""Butterfly"" and hate it at the same time! It is totally bittersweet.I've seen several performances, and I think THIS one at the Met is absolutely outstanding. However, you have to get used to some very innovative and emotionally unsettling theatrical approaches.Since most people know the story of Butterfly and its strengths and weaknesses, I'll forgo that to focus on why this is a great DVD to own of this amazing Metropolitan Opera Production. It's all about the production!Not only is it an exciting live stage performance, it also takes advantage of  striking videography. I don't know how the production must have looked to the live audience (we get a few glimpses from the audience perspective perhaps for reference), but to me, watching the DVD, and getting the benefit of the close ups and excellent camera work and direction, I felt I got an excellent video performance designed to be a video performance, not a record of a live performance.So it is a two in one production, showing great sensitivity on the part of the producers. It raises the bar for all other performances because these days, with the importance of video (i.e. going straight to DVD), theater is challenged with staging in a way that moves a live audience, who cannot see in closeup, and a video audience who CAN see in close up-- at the same time. It's one thing to pop a camera onto a tripod and point it at the stage, it's another to move with the performance, zooming in and out as needed while never interfering with that performance. The latter takes added direction, and improves the quality and outreach of the production to a wider audience. Bravo MET for this production's video direction and quality, you got it all right! It is thrilling to watch on DVD.Now let's talk about some really spectacular stuff, the singers and the orchestra!They are amazing! All of them. No question. Very moving. Not only are they beautiful to hear, they are wonderful to watch. They make this opera performance a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. Even if you don't like the staging, this version is worth it just for the fantastic musical performances and the acting.Opera can fail when it is a bunch of people standing on stage not doing anything, or it can soar when even in their ""off time"" while still on stage, characters are interacting or showing emotions and responses to what others are doing and singing. The cast of this production get it all spot on, making the opera much more intriguing. You sometimes aren't sure just where to look. That's what's great about having the DVD, I can watch over and over, shifting my focus each time. Re-play value counts!The music would fail if it didn't have the power of a grand orchestra and a sensitive conductor. No worries in this MET production!The brilliant Metropolitan orchestra delivers with a one-two knockout punch. The dynamic range and control is excellent, moving, and deeply emotional. Timing and pacing seems perfect. The singers are never overwhelmed by the full orchestra, and yet when the orchestra diminishes, it never becomes weak. The sound is crisp, precise, and exciting. Absolutely top notch. Another Bravo.So sonically, the opera is a big hit with me, it represents all the power and passion of Puccini with a great deal of impact. Puccini, like Wagner, needs to be driven, loud and in-your-face, because that was what he was going for. The Met Orchestra and singers deliver and then some. Spectacular!Now on to the staging, the production. Personally, I loved it, but not everybody may.This is very controversial among reviewers. Yes, it is minimalist, but I think I understand why. By reducing the sets to screens and using traditional Japanese treatments, they kept the focus on the emotions of the characters (and could they POSSIBLY be MORE emotional?) Puccini's music is all about emotion, gobs and gobs of it. So I think they gave the music the lead and the sets were to follow. The use of the minimal sets also allowed the brilliant costumes to shine, and gave the actors and singers plenty of freedom of movement. I thought it was a great way to stage the opera.The costumes are absolutely outstanding. Not only are they traditional Japanese (and let's face it, nothing compares to a well decked out Kimono) they are very colorful and dramatic on stage, a feast for the eyes and inspiration for the imagination. Naturally, the hair and make up are of the same quality. This whole production is top notch quality.There is SO MUCH to see and enjoy, again and again. Total re-play value.There is one thing that I found utterly fascinating and a bit of a conundrum. It's a point of some contention among some reviewers -- and that is the use of traditional Japanese puppets, and some unexplained ballet.For example, the opera opens in silence (except for the noise of the audience - who are very noisy for some reason) as a Japanese fan dancer slowly comes down the stage. That's one of the ""Huh?"" moments of the production, but one heck of a way to start things off. John Cage would have loved it! I'm still trying to figure it out. I appreciate it, it's beautifully done, and an amazing way to start things off. I KNOW there's a message in it, but I haven't quite got it. I shall have to watch it again and see if I can figure it out. Innovative? Absolutely. Risky? Definitely. Memorable? Obviously.The second outstanding innovation in the production is the use of traditional Japanese Bunraku puppets.What? Puppets?YES, and they work brilliantly. The direction and performance of these silent characters is haunting.They show up in the most unexpected places.First we see a pair as house servants. These puppets have little to do, but are probably just a way of introducing the audience to the idea that there will be puppets in the performance.We get a very touching puppet performance in what I think is a type of puppet ballet/dream sequence during an extended intermezzo. It is a tableau and encapsulation scene.There are two main characters; a strikingly handsome, stylized bald dancer who represents Pinkerton, and a puppet who represents Butterfly.The Butterfly puppet is expertly managed by the puppeteers and she (they?) are dance ""partners"" to Pinkerton's dream surrogate.  These great performers convey deep emotion through movement, and their dance really tells us, in a nutshell what we already know.They drive home the point, that Pinkerton is an indifferent betrayer as a lover, out for his own interests and lusts, while Butterfly is a hopeless romantic, desperately in love and dependent upon him. The power of dance.Of course we know this to be the case, but to have it so graphically displayed through such simple and elegant dance adds to the impact of the whole story. It's so tough and moving to watch at the end of the sequence when Pinkerton rejects Butterfly and in a swirl of brilliant blue satin, she is drawn off and away into darkness, lost to him and to us. Really heady stuff and brilliantly done!They could have done only this and it would have been outstanding, but they did even more in the production with the puppets.There is the final uber puppet - almost the star of the show - and the least expected character of all, ""Sorrow"", Butterfly's child.The directors and producers decided to cast the role of ""Sorrow"" as a Japanese puppet. It's brilliantly done, if totally unexpected, especially for an American traditional audience. And that's the conundrum.""Sorrow"" has no lines, and a mask for a face, yet he (like his Butterfly puppet counterpart in the ballet) is the one of the MOST expressive characters in the opera, almost overshadowing the wonderfully powerful lead singers! It's ironic that in an opera, the one character who never sings a note, moved me to tears with his silent emotions. He steals the show!I have seen performances using live children who just can't touch what goes on here. How can a piece of wood out perform a live human being? What do the producers of this MET performance know that everyone else is missing?Much of the credit for ""Sorrow"" naturally goes to his brilliant puppeteers. Working in traditional Japanese style, they are hidden, yet present. They are the shadow, and the soul, of the silent child.And what a soul they display. It's all about body language and intense intimacy. It is deeply moving, emotionally disturbing and total cognitive dissonance. I cannot figure out why this performance moves me so deeply, but I see the mechanical child as desperately fragile, a perfect reflection of his doomed mother, who herself is a ""puppet"" dancing to Pinkerton's manipulative play on the strings of her innocent and naive heart.Here's where having the DVD or a video copy of the performance comes into its greatest strength. You really have to watch these talented artists closely as they work the puppet. THEIR faces and THEIR eyes give the child expression. I doubt that the live audience was able to catch this. And if the director was only concerned with them (the live audience), the puppeteers probably would have done well enough manipulating the boy and remaining truly anonymous.But the fact that they ARE so emotionally involved and brought INTO the performance on the video level, and that we can SEE it on the DVD makes me feel that the directors and producers of this opera were very sensitive to a wide audience and delivered on all counts. BRAVO!At the end, in the final scene, this magnificent performance is so heartbreaking, I dove for the box of tissues.The puppets were made by Blind Summit Theater, but no credit is given to the exact designers, (although the puppeteers are identified on their website). So it is impossible to know who to thank for these wonderful creations. Whoever made these puppets was (were, are?) a genius, from sculpture through costume. These ""little people"" are very much alive!When Patricia Racette is singing and holding the child, DANG, it seems more alive than a REAL child! Tragically so, heartbreakingly so. The same is true of the dream ballet. Gosh, it is so mind blowing!There is a scene during another long orchestral intermezzo (actually just after the dream sequence, when Buttrerfly and ""Sorrow"" are awake) where Racette (Butterfly), ""Sorrow"", and his puppeteers look with wonder at a flock of birds, which are also puppets.I have had to watch that scene over and over because it amazes me so much. The birds are so simple, origami in style, yet so well managed by their puppeteers that they look like they really are in flight. And Racette and ""Sorrow"" are absolutely convincing as a mother sharing the wonder of her child discovering this simple beauty of nature. She plays off the puppet like he is a real boy and he plays off her like he is a real boy in a way I have never seen a real boy do on stage. Shades of Pinocchio! It's brilliant.Stuff like this doesn't come along every day. It is true art.Now, for some this may be too much, too much in the abstract, too much mixture of Japanese puppet theater with Italian grand opera (yes, it is grand). But for me, it raised the already high art form of opera to a new level, which I think is very hard to do.I admit, there is plenty of the ""Huh?"" in this production because it is so daring, innovative and different. It takes some getting used to. I found it easy to do so, and discovered it to be deeply disturbing on an emotional level. I think it really does match what Puccini was doing with his music. It isn't just tragic, it is disturbingly tragic.For example, in the scene where Pinkerton shows up with his American wife, they play it all for sympathy. That wife could have been haughty and proud, arrogant, rude, demanding. But instead she is tender and touching as she looks helplessly upon the tragic scene as Pinkerton demands his child in spite of what it will do to Butterfly. She, like Butterfly, is a victim of this terribly selfish and arrogant, indifferent traitor of a man. The feeling I got was that she will spend the rest of her life living with the guilt of what she was a party to. Of course, there's nothing she can do, and that's part of the tragedy.The puppet ""Sorrow"" is a significant part of this scene, and we aren't done with him yet! For those who CAN appreciate the use of puppets backing amazing musical singing, I have a warning.The final scene is awesome, just awesome, and AWFUL - as in AWE - FULL.Awe-Full because it is so brilliantly done that the tragedy is hideous, almost unbearable.Get out the tissues, you WILL need them. Here is why:When Butterfly must release her child to Pinkerton, then decides to commit suicide, and is interrupted by the child ""Sorrow"" -- dang, it is just too much to bear. Once again everything gels.The brilliant Racette acts and sings her heart out (at this point, she OWNS Butterfly), the puppet, ""Sorrow"" is so masterfully manipulated and she interacts with him so tenderly that it makes intensely compelling theater.Take advantage of what the DVD provides, those closeups, and watch the puppeteers closely; they are the child's soul and their expressions and body language themselves are fantastic. They enhance the amazing music and the emotional impact is profound. It is actually haunting! I wanted to rescue the pair of them! Of course, that can't happen, ever. No one can rescue these two, they have been doomed by their creator, Puccini, to torment audiences forever with their tragic circumstances.Sniff.Conclusion:B R A V O  M E T!This is a quality production in very high and somewhat abstract stage style on top of brilliant musical performances, costuming, and acting that offers a unique perspective for video viewers. The singing is top rate, the orchestra is outstanding, the costumes are brilliant.If you can work with the unorthodox staging (which I really enjoyed) and can get into the puppets (which I adored), I think you will find new meaning in this greatly loved opera.It may give you two reactions, as it did me.I hate it for what happens -- it is hideously cruel. That's not really the MET, that's the story and Puccini. Always was. It's a tear jerker. What the MET did was kick it up so high, it is in the artistic stratosphere. That's a major accomplishment with such a well known 100 year old opera. Totally new life!I love it for how this MET production makes it all unfold, how it drew me in, how it captured me and my heart as much as Pinkerton captured Butterfly's heart. The ""feel"" is amazing, the sense of ""theater"" - even in video - is pure magic. It is hauntingly beautiful on so many levels, even though it is so painfully tragic.The production is pure inspiration, food for thought, and the images and performances will haunt me for quite some time, especially ""Sorrow"" and his puppeteers.My mind is reeling from the experience. I feel I have been to another world and come back.When a production can pull that off, it is a major success.Oh, and I needed a lot of tissues!A+PLUS!B R A V O!",5,Brilliant and Bizarre - Touching and

1397918,A1PXA18XT1SM5Q,B004ECFW7Q,Ultrarunner,"[11, 15]","The first performance of Butterfly was a failure at its premiere at La Scala in 1904, even though it had Storchio as Butterfly,Toscanni's lover at the time. The youthful Zenatello as Pinkerton and De Luca as Sharpless. A dream cast. The problem was that Butterfly was devided into two long acts. Also, many people in Milan wanted Puccini to fail. He was not their favourite composer and getting too big for his pants they thought. When the curtain finally fell there was total silence. Toscanni had predicted such a failure when he saw the score at Storchio's home. He had left La Scala by this time because the audience were too noisy. Puccini withdrew the opera, changed parts of the opera and divided the opera into three acts. Three months later Butterfly was presented at Brescia,between Milan and Turin. Butterfly was  Salomea Kruszeinicka  with a deeper voice. The other principal singers and conductor were the same. The success the opera received was due to the changes and a more open minded audience. Puccini fiddled with the opera until 1906, when Butterfly had its premiere at the Paris opera-Comique. Albert Carre, director of the opera Comique wanted changes to suit his bourgeois audience. This 1906 version is the one we hear today. Madama Butterfly was converted from a Japanese tragedy, to a Melodrama. In the original version of 1904,from the moment the child is born, he is the reason for Butterfly's existence,the reason for her independence. In the final scene, after she bids farewell to the child, she wilfully commits suicide as befits the dignity of the daughter of a Samurai. Only by her death can Butterfly give her child to the  Pinkerton's , because the maternal bond is too strong. This is a part of her destiny, the path she has followed and what has been delivered to her. She was not a victim as she became in the 1906 version. But this 1906 version as well as the 1904 version conforms to Puccini's wish"" I shall make you weep""  The 1904 La Scala Version can be found on Vox classics, conductor, Rosekrans with the Hungarian State opera house orchestra. The Butterfly is Maria Spacagna. You can programme the Brescia and 1906 Paris version to play as well from these 4 CD's.Also, included is the original texts. You might be interested in hearing the original 1904 singers, Storchio, Zenatello and De Luca,also Kruszeinicka on CD. EMI Classics Vol 1,1878-1914,La Scala edition. Also, EMI, Les introuvables du chant Verdien. (Rarities of Verdi Singers). I believe it is wise to know your history, so you can understand the present.The current Butterfly is produced at the Sferisterio opera Festival Macerata This open air stadium was opened in 1829 as a home for Italian handball game, but used as a music venue since the 1920's. Pier Luigi Pizzi is the Stage Director,set and Costume designer. The production is traditional with its pretty little Japanese House, blossom covered cherry tree and silk kimonos. Many of Pinkertons less likeable characteristics are shown. His thoughtless juggling of the statues of Buddha, and his doling out dollar bills to show money can buy you love. The Fondazione Orchestra Regionala delle marche is conducted by Daniele Callegari. The music is swift and captures the emotion and sadness in this piece. Bravo.  One of Italy's favourite Butterfly's is singing the part, Raffaella Angeletti, who has deep chest notes, more like a Kruszelinicka ,then a Storchio. She captures the emotional impulse. My stiff upper lip dropped for a while, I was almost in tears at the end.Puccini, you got me. Suzuki is Annunziata Vestri the mezzo, who is marvellous. Sharpless is Pisapia. Strong voice. The rest of the cast is equally fine. I think the reason why this opera succeeds, is because the orchestra, director and much of the cast are Italian. If you like Italian opera and Puccini, this is a must for your Blu Ray collection.This review is by a person who also likes Modern productions.This opera is traditionally staged.
