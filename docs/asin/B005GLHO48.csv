When the legal system fails to deliver justice, Sean takes to the streets to eliminate evil doers while searching for his mother's killer. Forget Spider-man and Batman. This is who every kid wishes he could be. BOY WONDER drops a real world hero into a real world setting. Sean has no super powers, no costume, no million-dollar mansion... He is just a kid with a punching bag and a personal vendetta on his hands. Director Michael Morrissey creates a somber mood and grimy aesthetic as he places his character in the dark and dangerous streets of downtown Brooklyn. The gritty violence is unyielding as Sean mercilessly beats drug dealers, pimps, and gangsters to the ground, but not before taking plenty of hits, himself. Caleb Steinmeyer is excellent in his first feature role, selling Sean's sad, empty existence with his cold-eyed expressions and restrained performance. He truly becomes the character. BOY WONDER plays on the deeper psychological aspects of what it means to be a hero, and where the line between right and wrong is drawn.

I liked the story but didn't find it quite as great as some of these other reviewers.Here's the scoop. Sean witnessed his mothers brutal death when he was just ten years old. Now he's a withdrawn senior in high school. He studies and gets good grades but doesn't mix with others. He has an arms length relationship with his dad who is an ""on the wagon"" alcoholic. Dad used to beat him and his mother. Sean now spends some evening hours killing people who take advantage of those unable to defend themselves. A feisty female detective takes an interest in him and it leads to an unraveling of things.I liked the plot line and some of the nifty turns in this movie. The sweet and sour ending was a big surprise to me and rather clever to boot. But it was generally sub-par in execution. Caleb Steinmeyer, as Sean, does a good job as does Bill Sage as his father. But Zulay Henao as the female detective, and pretty much everyone else, was mediocre. Part of it, I think, was the writing. Though I liked much of the plot, the dialogue, I found to be lackluster. It didn't have the zing or music I'm used to seeing in feature films. By some standards there might have been a bit too much coincidence in the story. It bothered me a bit but not enough to write it off. The production values and directing were good.

Although it shares a similar origin story to many of our favorite superheroes, Boy Wonder is about a kid, Sean, that witnesses his mother get murdered. He is haunted by this memory and decides to hunt down the man that killed his mom. Throughout the story, he'll seek justice for others usually in a violent way (often fist-fighting or shooting). There are other psychological aspects that you begin to notice during the second half of the film when you realize Sean may actually be mentally ill. The ending has some decent twists. The emotional story, the thrilling action, and even the comedy between the cops make this film a great one. The acting was great, and the music really stood out to me. Definitely one of the better films released recently. Is it a pure superhero film? No. Don't expect a huge budget with amazing special effects and mutated villains. This is a realistic film of a young man seeking justice.There is some violence and blood throughout the film, and there is no sex or nudity.

1460159,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005GLHO48,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Boy Wonder (Michael Morrissey, 2010)Imagine that, as a child, you saw your mother murdered. Imagine that the police have come up with nothing in the twelve years between then and now, no matter how much you stick around. (One character in the movie says that lead character Sean Donovan has become the precinct's unofficial mascot). Imagine you think you could do better. What would you do?Variations on the theme have populated any number of recent movies, from various attempts at the Batman franchise to Super to Kick-Ass. The best of the bunch, though, you may not have heard of: Boy Wonder, a low-key thriller that came right out of left field. First time writer/director Michael Morrissey got his start in Hollywood as a producer of reality TV shows, mostly centered around home renovation (First Time Flippers, Ten Grand in Your Hand, etc.). As of this writing, Boy Wonder is his only fictional effort. I know reality TV probably pays the bills better, but for my money, Morrissey needs to ditch the networks and start doing this stuff full-time, because his debut movie knocks one out of the park.This is normally where I would put the plot summary, but I kind of did that in the first paragraph. I'm sure you concluded from what I wrote up there that Sean Donovan (TV character actor Caleb Steinmeyer in his first feature appearance, and as of this writing, last&#8212;he seems to have gone behind the camera as a production assistant) turns to vigilantism both as an outlet for his pent-up rage and as a way of tracking down his mother's killer. Thus, Sean is playing both sides of the field&#8212;enlisting the help of the police department by day while evading them at night.When it comes right down to it, there's not a great deal of plot to this, but that helps the movie stay on track, and it also leaves ample room for Morrissey to develop his characters. That's what takes the movie from standard revenge thriller into the stratosphere. Ironically, it's also most likely why the movie went nowhere upon its initial release.

1460163,A23FDMTREBQC7P,B005GLHO48,Todd O'Rourke,"[2, 4]","""Wonder Boy"" is not your run of the mill movie about a young vigilante hero, like ""Super"" or ""Kick Ass"".  The main character doesn't fight crime because he read comic books, nor is he out stopping bad guys because he is bored with life.  Rather, Sean (Caleb Steinmeyer) is driven to extremes in order to find his mother's killer.Sean, after witnessing his mother's murder, comes to live in a truce with his father (Bill Sage), a recovering alcoholic, who used to beat Sean and his mother when she was still alive.  His father has changed over the years, as well as apologized, but the damage has been done.Sean's violence builds up throughout the years until he can no longer contain his anger.  He begins to prowl the streets, unleashing violence on individuals who abuse people weaker than themselves.  For Sean, he sees someone being violently abusive and decides to take a stand where most people would not.  His violence is unique, because Sean seems to absorb enough pain to demonstrate the other person's savagery, and then beat his enemy into a pulp or worse.  He gets no satisfaction from his victories, yet he feels obliged to continue this duty.Although this film has ties with comic books, premiering at Comic Con, it has no real connection with other comic book films.  Because of the marketing strategy, this film will more than likely draw in comic oriented fans, yet it must be known that this movie has nothing to do with comics, besides writer-director Michael Morrissey's noir lighting and framing.  I watched this film with low expectations; I honestly knew nothing about it, but I was surprised to find a very emotional driven film that works on many different levels.  Although Sean may not always be the most plausible of characters, yet for the length of the film, I was interested in the way things would play out.I give this film 5 stars.",5,A Unique Look At Vigilantism,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1864,"['Wonder', 'Boy', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'movie', 'young', 'vigilante', 'hero', 'Super', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'fight', 'crime', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'out', 'stopping', 'bad', 'guys', 'bored', 'life', 'Rather', 'Sean', 'Caleb', 'Steinmeyer', 'driven', 'extremes', 'order', 'find', 'mother', 'killer.Sean', 'witnessing', 'mother', 'murder', 'live', 'truce', 'father', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'used', 'beat', 'Sean', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'father', 'changed', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'apologized', 'damage', 'been', 'done.Sean', 'violence', 'up', 'years', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'contain', 'anger', 'prowl', 'streets', 'unleashing', 'violence', 'individuals', 'who', 'abuse', 'people', 'weaker', 'Sean', 'someone', 'being', 'violently', 'abusive', 'take', 'stand', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'violence', 'unique', 'Sean', 'absorb', 'enough', 'pain', 'demonstrate', 'other', 'person', 'savagery', 'then', 'beat', 'enemy', 'pulp', 'worse', 'satisfaction', 'victories', 'yet', 'obliged', 'continue', 'duty.Although', 'film', 'ties', 'comic', 'books', 'premiering', 'Comic', 'Con', 'real', 'connection', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'marketing', 'strategy', 'film', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'draw', 'comic', 'oriented', 'fans', 'must', 'be', 'known', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'comics', 'writer-director', 'Michael', 'Morrissey', 'noir', 'lighting', 'framing', 'watched', 'film', 'low', 'expectations', 'honestly', 'knew', 'nothing', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'very', 'emotional', 'driven', 'film', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Sean', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'most', 'plausible', 'characters', 'yet', 'length', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'way', 'things', 'would', 'play', 'out.I', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars']",Boy Wonder

Happily I was completely wrong - this owes as much to revenge films as any other genre. We meet Sean (played with considered poise by Caleb Steinmeyer - `Lost'). He witnessed the brutal murder of his mother as a child and has since become something of a recluse. His alcoholic father with a history of domestic abuse and is ambiguous in his paternal role but it is quite clear from the start that Sean aint exactly crazy about pops.He maintains the guise of a straight `A student' at school and spends his spare time going through mug shots of ne'er do wells at the local Police precinct who handled the murde - ostensibly to identify his mothers killer. Then a new female detective comes along and takes a big professional interest in our reclusive teen who seems to be always `falling over' and getting bruised etc. What he is hiding is that he has become a night stalker, vigilante who wants to take out bad guys. This is not a `Death Wish' he actually comes across as genuinely scared at what he is doing; but he goes ahead anyway. The violence is the realistic sort - not stylised rubbish that owes more to choreography and as such it all adds to lend authenticity to the film.I kept thinking this was going to verge into clich&eacute; as it has the feel of a low budget indie film, but it keeps you guessing right up till the end and the more I saw, the more I really liked it. It has also stayed with me which is no bad thing at all. God acting, great script, genuine twsits and an actual thriller of a plot. The only thing they appear to have got wrong was the lack of publicity as I only happened across this by chance - absolutely recommended.",5,"Vigilante, Thriller Flick that Will keep you guessing",1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1808,"['have', 'been', 'spate', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'personal', 'fave', 'being', 'Super', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'indeed', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'same', 'Happily', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'as', 'much', 'revenge', 'films', 'other', 'genre', 'meet', 'Sean', 'played', 'considered', 'poise', 'Caleb', 'Steinmeyer', 'Lost', 'witnessed', 'brutal', 'murder', 'mother', 'child', 'become', 'something', 'recluse', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'history', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'ambiguous', 'paternal', 'role', 'quite', 'clear', 'start', 'Sean', 'aint', 'exactly', 'pops.He', 'guise', 'straight', 'student', 'school', 'spare', 'time', 'going', 'mug', 'shots', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'wells', 'local', 'Police', 'precinct', 'who', 'handled', 'murde', 'ostensibly', 'identify', 'mothers', 'killer', 'Then', 'new', 'female', 'detective', 'along', 'big', 'professional', 'interest', 'reclusive', 'teen', 'who', 'be', 'always', 'falling', 'getting', 'bruised', 'etc', 'What', 'hiding', 'become', 'night', 'stalker', 'vigilante', 'who', 'take', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'Death', 'Wish', 'actually', 'genuinely', 'scared', 'what', 'doing', 'ahead', 'anyway', 'violence', 'realistic', 'sort', 'not', 'stylised', 'rubbish', 'more', 'choreography', 'such', 'lend', 'authenticity', 'film.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'verge', 'clich', 'eacute', 'feel', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'film', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'till', 'end', 'more', 'saw', 'more', 'really', 'liked', 'also', 'stayed', 'bad', 'thing', 'God', 'acting', 'great', 'script', 'genuine', 'twsits', 'actual', 'thriller', 'plot', 'only', 'thing', 'appear', 'have', 'got', 'wrong', 'was', 'lack', 'publicity', 'only', 'happened', 'chance', 'absolutely', 'recommended']",Boy Wonder
