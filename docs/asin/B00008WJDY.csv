Though, true, this film is historically inaccurate, the production values are first rate!  It is true that the Mormons were run out of every town they tried to settle in.  It is beyond reproach the way these people were treated just because ""they were Mormons"".  The cinematography is superb!!  The musical score in unforgettable and the acting is excellent, particularly Vincent Price as Joseph Smith.  Jane Darwell has another memorable mother role as Eliza Kent.  The struggles portrayed during their pioneering movement is inspiring and edifying.  The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some nice extras in here namely, a great commentary and an A&E biography of Linda Darnell.  Truly a great, inspirational film, no matter what your faith is!!",5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,878,"['love', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'Mormon', 'am', 'Catholic', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'values', 'true', 'film', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'true', 'Mormons', 'were', 'run', 'town', 'tried', 'settle', 'reproach', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'treated', 'just', 'were', 'Mormons', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'musical', 'score', 'unforgettable', 'acting', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'memorable', 'mother', 'role', 'Eliza', 'Kent', 'struggles', 'portrayed', 'pioneering', 'movement', 'inspiring', 'edifying', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'are', 'nice', 'extras', 'here', 'namely', 'great', 'commentary', 'A', 'E', 'biography', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Truly', 'great', 'inspirational', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'faith']",Brigham Young: Frontiersman

Whilst the story theme is necessarily simplistic to accommodate its telling within the confines of a movie script, it allows an ignorant viewer to gain a basic & very shallow understanding of the historic background in the formation of the Morman faith & I personally enjoyed that.The direction is adequate with some scenes over acted with the Director trying to emphasise a particular situation however overall it is a good movie & well worth the effort to watch.I was impressed with Karl Malden's characterisation of Brigham Young & I also enjoyed Vincent Prices brief performance in his portrayal of Joseph Smith however Tyrone Power was a little disappointing for me & I am a fan of his.Finally, DVD quality was good & it arrived on time so no problems with the service.",4,Entertained & Enlightened,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,868,"['have', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', 'awareness', 'Morman', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'story', 'theme', 'necessarily', 'simplistic', 'accommodate', 'telling', 'confines', 'movie', 'script', 'ignorant', 'viewer', 'gain', 'basic', 'very', 'shallow', 'understanding', 'historic', 'background', 'formation', 'Morman', 'faith', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'that.The', 'direction', 'adequate', 'scenes', 'acted', 'Director', 'trying', 'emphasise', 'particular', 'situation', 'however', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'effort', 'watch.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'characterisation', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Vincent', 'Prices', 'brief', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'however', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'am', 'fan', 'his.Finally', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'arrived', 'time', 'problems', 'service']",Brigham Young: Frontiersman
748781,A2UO4Y0063LNBX,B00008WJDY,"R. C. Harris Jr. ""Norway""","[23, 25]","Considering that this movie was made in 1939 and 1940 it is an amazing achievement. The special effects are quite impressive for the time: The birds-eye view of the wagons leaving Nauvoo with the temple in center screen, Crossing the Missouri frozen river, Nauvoo homes and temple burning in the background across the river, all of the wagons and oxen crossing plains, rivers, climbing mountains, etc. But especially the near-final scene of the locusts and the seagulls (which were mostly all real).Dean Jagger does a remarkable job as Brigham Young. He resembles him closely and even has a similar voice, according to a crew-member who was hired for coaching because he knew Brigham personally, and was around 16 when Brigham died in 1877 (50 years before filming this picture). Interesting trivia note: Dean Jagger was not LDS when he made this film but later married a Mormon woman and subsequently joined the church.Vincent Price respected Joseph Smith greatly and had great reverence and admiration for him while playing the role of the prophet. His screentime is minimal but he does a fine job (in spite of being 10 years older than the man he was portraying).The LDS first presidency approved the script, even though it veered from the truth on many points. They did this because they agreed that it helped make the picture more dramatic and exciting. Personally, I would prefer historical accuracy over romance or excitement, but that's how it was back then. Successful movies had a sort of recipe, and they wanted this one to follow that recipe as close as it could.But all-in-all it paints an accurate picture of America in the 1840's and 50's and the trek of the early Mormon pioneers.I recommend it, but if you can, watch the excellent commentary afterwards. It clears up fact from fiction and is very enlightening.Film: 3 starsDVD extras: 4 starsWeighted average score: 4 stars",4,"Definitely worth watching, but not all true to the facts",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,1890,"['Considering', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1939', '1940', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'time', 'birds-eye', 'view', 'wagons', 'leaving', 'Nauvoo', 'temple', 'center', 'screen', 'Crossing', 'Missouri', 'frozen', 'river', 'Nauvoo', 'homes', 'temple', 'burning', 'background', 'river', 'wagons', 'oxen', 'crossing', 'plains', 'rivers', 'climbing', 'mountains', 'etc', 'especially', 'near-final', 'scene', 'locusts', 'seagulls', 'were', 'mostly', 'real', '.Dean', 'Jagger', 'remarkable', 'job', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'closely', 'even', 'similar', 'voice', 'according', 'crew-member', 'who', 'was', 'hired', 'coaching', 'knew', 'Brigham', 'personally', 'was', 'around', '16', 'when', 'Brigham', 'died', '1877', '50', 'years', 'filming', 'picture', 'Interesting', 'trivia', 'note', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'was', 'not', 'LDS', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'later', 'married', 'Mormon', 'woman', 'subsequently', 'joined', 'church.Vincent', 'Price', 'respected', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'greatly', 'had', 'great', 'reverence', 'admiration', 'playing', 'role', 'prophet', 'screentime', 'minimal', 'fine', 'job', 'spite', 'being', '10', 'years', 'older', 'man', 'was', 'portraying', '.The', 'LDS', 'first', 'approved', 'script', 'even', 'veered', 'truth', 'many', 'points', 'did', 'agreed', 'helped', 'make', 'picture', 'more', 'dramatic', 'exciting', 'Personally', 'would', 'prefer', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'romance', 'excitement', 'how', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'Successful', 'movies', 'had', 'sort', 'recipe', 'wanted', 'one', 'follow', 'recipe', 'as', 'close', 'all-in-all', 'accurate', 'picture', 'America', '1840', '50', 'trek', 'early', 'Mormon', 'pioneers.I', 'recommend', 'can', 'watch', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'afterwards', 'up', 'fact', 'fiction', 'very', 'enlightening.Film', '3', 'starsDVD', 'extras', '4', 'starsWeighted', 'average', 'score', '4', 'stars']",Brigham Young: Frontiersman
