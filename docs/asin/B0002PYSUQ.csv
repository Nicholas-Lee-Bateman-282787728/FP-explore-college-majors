Okay so after watching it I can say It wasn't true to the comic.  Jon is not as much of an idiot, he gets the girl in the end and he lives in a nice house instead of a broken down place with ripped up furniture!!However, being untrue to the comic did not make it terrible, just the oposite in fact I love it!!  I love who they picked to play my charactures and Nermal was great even though in the comic he is a striped grey kitty and they made him a slightly unintellegant siamese.

The big problem for me is why does Hollywood always have to involve criminals in their films. What has a criminal have to do with Garfield - Nothing at all. Bill Murray is the perfect voice for Garfield and without him this really wouldn't be a good film. I think they get the basic characteristics of Garfield although not all of them. The character of Jon is nothing like the comics but where could you find an actor to play that loser. This is more based for the children but adults (like myself) will enjoy it but will maybe be a bit disappointed as I expected more of the great and sophisticated Garfield humour to appear.

843359,A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,B0002PYSUQ,Antoinette Klein,"[30, 36]","Having been a fan of Garfield for as long as I can remember, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie for months.  I was not disappointed and can hardly wait to see it again as soon as possible.Garfield's voice has passed from the late Lorenzo Music to Bill Murray with great success.  Murray has successfully captured all the subtle nuances of the tubby tabby as Garfield reveals his love/hate relationship with Odie, his disdain of Jon balanced with his desire to be #1 in his care-giver's life, and, of course, his love of lasagna, tv, and self.What we loyal readers of Garfield may not have realized is that the Fat Cat is a smooth dancer as he gyrates, swings his tail, and even does an astonishingly good imitation of Elvis.The plot takes us back to the day Odie came into Garfield and Jon's lives and of the jealousy that Garfield felt for the intruder in his happy home.  Also present are Pooky, Nermal, and Arlene. Though Nermal is far different from the cute little kitten who appears in the strips, he still is the butt of Garfield's not-so-nice little tricks.  On the other hand, the animation of Garfield is just right as is the moviemaker's ability to integrate a cartoon cat into a world of real humans and animals. Speaking of humans, Jon and Dr. Liz the Vet have had personality upgrades from the strip.  Jon loses much of the geekiness but retains the innocence and even gets a chance with Dr. Liz---something that's never happened in the daily strip.There are plenty of laughs in this and I had a totally good time watching the full hour and twenty-five minutes.",5,The Lasagna-Loving Cat Dances His Way Into Your Heart,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,1580,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'Garfield', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'have', 'been', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'movie', 'months', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'possible.Garfield', 'voice', 'passed', 'late', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'great', 'success', 'Murray', 'successfully', 'captured', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'tubby', 'tabby', 'Garfield', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Odie', 'disdain', 'Jon', 'balanced', 'desire', 'be', '1', 'care-giver', 'life', 'course', 'love', 'lasagna', 'tv', 'loyal', 'readers', 'Garfield', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'Fat', 'Cat', 'smooth', 'dancer', 'swings', 'tail', 'even', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'imitation', 'Elvis.The', 'plot', 'back', 'day', 'Odie', 'came', 'Garfield', 'Jon', 'lives', 'jealousy', 'Garfield', 'felt', 'intruder', 'happy', 'home', 'Also', 'present', 'are', 'Pooky', 'Nermal', 'Arlene', 'Though', 'Nermal', 'far', 'different', 'cute', 'little', 'kitten', 'who', 'strips', 'still', 'butt', 'Garfield', 'not-so-nice', 'little', 'tricks', 'other', 'hand', 'animation', 'Garfield', 'just', 'right', 'moviemaker', 'ability', 'integrate', 'cartoon', 'cat', 'world', 'real', 'humans', 'animals', 'Speaking', 'humans', 'Jon', 'Dr.', 'Liz', 'Vet', 'have', 'had', 'personality', 'upgrades', 'strip', 'Jon', 'much', 'geekiness', 'innocence', 'even', 'chance', 'Dr.', 'Liz', '-something', 'never', 'happened', 'daily', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'had', 'totally', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'full', 'hour', 'twenty-five', 'minutes']",N/A

As a baby boomer, I loved Jerry Lewis movies like ""The Big Mouth"" when I was a kid.  Today, I find it too silly to watch, even for nostalgia's sake.  Garfield is the same.  It relies on the physical antics of the animated cat to carry the day.  I think the directors and animation artists were far more excited about it than I was.  One time in the movie: okay.  Twice: you're pushing it.  More than that is just plain tiresome.  So this goes well beyond tiresome.  Gone is the edginess of the character in the strip.  Instead, we have a piece of fluff that never comes close to its potential.  Even the Saturday morning Garfield and Friends cartoon was closer to the strip.  This movie is to the strip what Super Friends were to JLA: a watered-down version guaranteed not to offend anyone.

843361,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0002PYSUQ,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[3, 3]","Just about everybody in the country seemed to dislike this movie when it was in theaters.  The famous tv critic duo couldn't stand the weird, fake look of the CGI fat cat dropped into the filmed background with other (real) animals and people.  It bombed in theaters when the adult children of the 80s who grew up loving the sassy feline thought that this just didn't do him justice.  But for some reason, the consensus from my kids (boys aged 2 and 6) is that it was pretty good, maybe even good enough to see a few times.  I have a feeling that they would be up for the sequel if it ever gets made.Garfield (for those of you who haven't read the funnies in about 25 years) is a fat, wisecracking orange cat that is constantly getting the better of his innocent owner Jon, the milkman, the neighborhood dogs and anybody else that gets in the way of his pursuit of pleasure.  One day Jon agrees to adopt Odie, a smallish and not-so-bright dog that annoys Garfield no end.  On top of the indignity of having to put up with a dog, now our hero has to share the spotlight.  Clearly, somebody has to move out!  Thus begins a little adventure of the two as they make their way through town trying to find each other and eventually becoming friends.  It's a cute, simple story that children will appreciate along with the various talking and dancing animals, things getting knocked over and broken, etc.  This is a movie about on a kid's level to be sure.Adults, esp. longtime fans of the comic strip, will no doubt be annoyed at the unnatural-looking version of Garfield waltzing around with filmed cats, dogs and humans.  This Garfield seems to have a nonstop running commentary which is at times funny, but it seemed to me that the comic strip Garfield was more selective with his one-liners delivered at just the right moment, so I felt that the spirit of the original character was not here.  Another departure from the printed version was Liz, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt; she was a drier wit in the comic, but here she's  sweet and crushing on Jon.  That's just my cynical adult point of view however, and because this movie was so obviously not made with me and my ilk in mind, I learned to disregard my expectations and see it through a kids' eyes.  It wasn't bad, after all.Oh, and a little secret - to avoid being forced to watch the irritating previews at the beginning, hit your fast forward button as soon as they start (no, menu doesn't work) and it will take you to the menu.  At least it worked that way on my dvd player.Three stars from me, five stars from the kids = four stars overall.

I was predisposed to avoid it. I didn't rent it, but was talked into it.What we've got is a famous comic strip cat hamming it up on film. The premise in the film is that Garfield, an overweight and lazy, and occasionally witty cat, lives with Jon Arbuckle, a human. Jon's got a crush on Garfield's vet (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt), whom he's had eyes on since high school. The vet talks Jon into talking on a dog (Odie).Garfield objects to Odie's innocent presence in their home, and puts him out for the night. Odie runs off, is captured by an evil TV animal entertainer. Garfield realizes he's in the wrong, and tries to chase down him down before Odie is brought to New York City.Jon, in turn, feels awful, because as he sees it, he's lost both his dog and his cat. Worse than that, he's convinced his vet girlfriend looks down on him as a result.The plot isn't so bad, especially when this is considered a children's movie. It is a little less complicated than other recent animated kids movies, like ""Jonah the Veggie Tales Movie"" or any of the message-heavy Disney song and dance cartoons. And it is less edgy than the Spiderman, X-Men or Hulk movies. How could it go wrong?Poor scripting. Poor acting. Poor casting. Poor editing.Poor scripting.Good movies have good scripts. The classic Peanuts cartoons are classics not just because of the wholesale goodness of Charlie Brown, but because smart writers thought the project through. They did not, as Garfield's team does, rely on a cat dancing for laughs with a dog, or cheap one-liners. Even Michael Jordan's ""Space Jam"" went beyond this.Poor acting.Isn't Bill Murray funny? Can't Jennifer Love Hewitt actually act? Maybe Murray was just given bad lines, but he hardly seemed to care. Hewitt is cute, but that was it. She too wasn't there. Breckin Meyer was only OK. It seemed like an unrehearsed reading of a play.Poor casting.Murray as Garfield is predictable. Like Adam Sandler, Murray seems to only pick roles he has played before.Poor editing.We never saw the parts when Garfield made friends with a big nasty dog he previously tormented.

I'll tell you this. I never really liked the Garfield comics very much. I found them not very funny. I preferred Get Fuzzy or Dilbert. I did like Garfield's TV show, Garfield and Friends. I have one of his many half-hour videos. I was very cautious to going to this.First of all, in the newspaper, it gave it a big fat 1 with the headline, ""A Garfield For All of Us to Hate."" But, the paper also gave Elf a 1 and Around the World in 80 Days a 3 1/2, so I gave it a shot.I'm glad I did. The movie starts out with you seeing Jon's house. (Ugh, it's so ugly.) The camera goes inside and you see many pictures of Jon and Garfield. You see Garfield sleeping with Pooky. Garfield wakes up and talks to Pooky a little and tries to wake Jon up. (I remember that from the comics.)After Jon gets jumped on, he wakes up and gives Garfield some food. Later on, it's off to the vet's office. There are 2 major things that are really weird at this part. A. The vet says she LIKES Jon. In the comics, she hates him. B. Liz the vet gives Odie to Jon!?!?!? I recall Jon getting him at a pet store.There are many things that do not relate to the TV show and the comics in the movie. It's like they just took the characters from a popular comic and made them completely different people!In Garfield the movie, they make Garfield a sort of more-clay-animated cat rather than just a 2-D comic book cat. Odie is a real dog that has no resemblance to the comic Odie. You couldn't even know that Nermal (the 'cutest' cat ever) and Arlene  (the cat that Garfield likes) were even Nermal and Arlene unless Garfield said their names. Nermal doesn't boast one word on how cute he is and neither of those cats (they're real too) look anything like their comic counterparts.Next, the movie is highly predictable except for 5 year olds. Also, at the very beginning of the movie (before the movie even starts) is a clip of that chipmunk from Ice Age. Like people came to see the chipmunk from Ice Age in a Garfield movie.But, Garfield is still an okay movie. It puts Garfield in the hero spot after Odie runs away and Garfield has to keep a greedy TV guy from bringing him to New York and making him a movie star. I don't even need to tell you if it works or not.When you see Garfield, you'll either really like it or really hate it. You can hate everything Garfield and still find something to like in this movie. Despite my many complaints about the animation and the predictability of this movie, I give it a 3 and a half. Since you can't rate 3 and 1 half, I'm nice enough to give Garfield a 4.

843371,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B0002PYSUQ,Brian J Hay,"[0, 0]","This movie could have been much better but it still gets a strong recommendation.The plot is pretty simple but that's as it should be. This is a cartoon brought to the screen. The strip itself was never intended to be complex; it was just supposed to show the different facets of daily living with pets in a way that touched the funny bone. The film stays true to that idea.The casting is great. Breckin Meyer is good looking enough to avoid looking like a nerd but has the right type of shy appeal to fit the role of Jon (Garfield's beleaguered owner) who's supposed to be decent but not particularly charismatic. Jennifer Love Hewitt has the right sort of appeal for the part of Liz as well. She's pretty, and very sexy, but it comes across in a way that's demure as opposed to sultry. Stephen Toblowsky makes a great heavy. His character isn't really evil as much as bitter. He's not a criminal. He just feels cheated and wants a better shake. Toblowsky has both the appearance and the demeanour to project that sort of aura. All of them are characters every viewer could identify with.This is one of the areas where the movie falls short, and the blame has to lie with the writers, Joel Cohen and Alex Sokolow. The only emotional depth they give to the parts played by Meyer or Hewitt is an obvious affection for the pets and for each other. Beyond that these characters are barely even one-dimensional. Their lives are void of friction, problems, any sort of genuine happiness, frustration, basically anything to do with anything that could have passed as character development. They smile. They have the occasional frown and they have starry-eyed looks for each other but that's about it. Steven Toblowsky doesn't fare any better. He's allowed to show a conniving side but doesn't get to deliver any glassy-eyed looks of love. These aren't characters--they're paper dolls in people suits.The CGI work in this film is wildly erratic. The best parts are so good it's easy to forget that it's a cartoon. The worst portions look exactly like what they are; a cartoon combined with live action. In scenes where either Meyer or Hewitt lift the flabby feline the work is seamless. In a scene where an animal handler picks Garfield up the human hands aren't even close to the ""fur"". When the latter happens it jars the viewer back to the reality of what's on the screen.The saving grace for this film is Bill Murray. His voice is perfect for the role of Garfield and he appears to have to have embraced the part for all it was worth. He turns the corners of the emotional and psychological turns of the role as if he's walking on a thread. When he boots Odie off the couch his remarks make it convincing. When he comments as he bounces off Jon it's the character come to life. This may be one of his best performances in a while. He certainly lifts this project way above the mediocre ground the rest of the project was treading on.But for Murray this would have been disappointment in a cat-suit. In many ways it still is.

(more on the list later)What wind up with this adaptation other than that the story which went on for the movie is not so well thought-out - it's that a lot of the characters have turned into a pale depiction against the comic strip basis. Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle (played here by one i thought was the same guy who played Shaggy in that yet-another disappointing cartoon movie adaptation SCOOBY DOO) could've been well portrayed by John Lithgow, whilst Jon's love interest, the grumpy vet Liz (portrayed here by Jennifer Love Hewitt) would've been well if they maintained the character faithful to what the strips are.Odie don't look like Odie. Nermul (that kitten who'd often steal the show from Garfield), is just not Nermul. And like a spoiled brat.. er, kid who just didn't get what he wants! I'm just so totally disappointed of this movie to the point of temper tantrums.It's clever that they have Bill Murray to play the voice of Garfield - when its peculiar that Bill Murray's character in the cartoon rendition of the GHOSTBUSTER flick is voiced by Lorenzo Music who also did the voice for Garfield on the cartoon features, including that good cartoon series GARFIELD & Friends.Musical-wise, this should've incorporated what they have started in the company of the cartoon features, and even more so - those that level well with Bacharach. But I guess the  people who created this movie adaptation dont really know the material that they have in their hands.There's a scene where GARFIELD sang a song rendered as 'New Dog State of Mind' which is a very lame alteration of a BILLY JOEL song called 'New York State of Mind' -- totally it went flat (no pun intended).However, the DVD contains the following features =* feature lenght audio commentary Peter Hewitt (director) and John Hewitt (producer)* behind-the-scenes feature: GARFIELD- Bringing the Cat To Life* Multi-angle content: Jim Davis talks about creating Garfield* ""Gone Nutty"" (ICE AGE spin-off featurette)* Inside Look ( a featurette from the creators new project ROBOTS)* Deleted Scenes* Multi-language subtitles* Scene Access menuand ~ * Two 'virtual' gamesAs for the other disappointing comic/cartoon based movie adaptations - we have =POPEYE (starring Robin Williams)THE SHADOWJUDGE DREDD (Stallone said so himself)SPIDERMAN (late 70's TV)CAPTAIN AMERICARICHIE RICH (this is one the most above it all)STEELTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (where the Turtles' personalities turned into some bunch of homies from brooklyn; and at worst! there's Vanilla Ice)SCOOBY DOODENNIS THE MENACEDAREDEVIL (put ELEKTRA as well on its side)THE HULK (where good-ol' greenbag turns as big as King Kong (talk about over-doing))and THE MASKI guess for these movie adaptations whether based from another source such as a tv or movie feature, including those that've taken their sources from other cartoon, comics, or books series - one of the best adaptation that've surfaced is that of THE LITTLE RASCALS - I don't care what the detractors and/or critics would have to say, but whatever it is they stank to smell only from the stench of them purists.RATING:Movie Feature= 2 out of 10DVD Extra features= 3 out of 5",2,GARFIELD The Movie on DVD,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,4189,"['1978', 'cartoonist', 'Jim', 'Henson..', 'rather', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'came', 'up', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'strip', 'cat', 'named', 'Garfield.In', '1983', 'cat', 'lover', 'boyhood-', 'confined', 'hospital', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'rather', 'the-kid-right-beside', 'lend', 'VIEW', 'MASTER', 'viewer', 'know', 'snap', 'slide', '3d', 'picture', 'viewer', 'back', 'seventies', 'loaded', 'GARFIELD', 'disc', 'eventually', 'got', 'hooked', 'great', 'fat', 'cat', 'even', 'creation', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'became', 'really', 'popular', '..', ""'87"", 'was', 'peak', 'being', 'Garfield', 'fanatic', 'back', 'then.And', 'thus', 'finally', 'see', 'GARFIELD', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'pic', 'quite', 'treat', 'then', 'again-', 'so', 'turned', 'out', 'movie', 'rendition', 'beloved', 'cat', 'so', 'bland', 'granted', 'nothing', 'more', 'commercial', 'foil', 'line', 'likes', 'many', 'disappointing', 'cartoon/comic/strip', 'adaptations', 'such', '80', 'Dennis', 'Menace-', 'where', 'talent', 'late', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'completely', 'wasted', 'fitting', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'more', 'list', 'later', 'What', 'up', 'adaptation', 'other', 'story', 'went', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'lot', 'characters', 'have', 'turned', 'pale', 'depiction', 'comic', 'strip', 'basis', 'Garfield', 'owner', 'Jon', 'Arbuckle', 'played', 'here', 'one', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Shaggy', 'yet-another', 'disappointing', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'well', 'portrayed', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'whilst', 'Jon', 'love', 'interest', 'grumpy', 'vet', 'Liz', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'well', 'maintained', 'character', 'faithful', 'what', 'strips', 'are.Odie', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Odie', 'Nermul', 'kitten', 'who', ""'d"", 'often', 'show', 'Garfield', 'just', 'not', 'Nermul', 'spoiled', 'brat..', 'er', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'just', 'so', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'point', 'temper', 'tantrums.It', 'clever', 'have', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'play', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'when', 'peculiar', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'cartoon', 'rendition', 'GHOSTBUSTER', 'flick', 'voiced', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'cartoon', 'features', 'including', 'good', 'cartoon', 'series', 'GARFIELD', 'Friends.Musical-wise', 'should', ""'ve"", 'incorporated', 'what', 'have', 'started', 'company', 'cartoon', 'features', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'level', 'well', 'Bacharach', 'guess', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'really', 'know', 'material', 'have', 'hands.There', 'scene', 'where', 'GARFIELD', 'sang', 'song', 'rendered', ""'New"", 'Dog', 'State', 'Mind', 'very', 'lame', 'alteration', 'BILLY', 'JOEL', 'song', 'called', ""'New"", 'York', 'State', 'Mind', 'went', 'flat', 'pun', 'intended', '.However', 'DVD', 'following', 'features', '=*', 'feature', 'lenght', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Hewitt', 'director', 'John', 'Hewitt', 'producer', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'GARFIELD-', 'Bringing', 'Cat', 'Life*', 'Multi-angle', 'content', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'talks', 'creating', 'Garfield*', 'Gone', 'Nutty', 'ICE', 'AGE', 'spin-off', 'featurette', '*', 'Inside', 'Look', 'featurette', 'creators', 'new', 'project', 'ROBOTS', '*', 'Deleted', 'Scenes*', 'Multi-language', 'subtitles*', 'Scene', 'Access', 'menuand', '~', '*', 'Two', ""'virtual"", 'gamesAs', 'other', 'disappointing', 'comic/cartoon', 'based', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'have', '=POPEYE', 'starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'THE', 'SHADOWJUDGE', 'DREDD', 'Stallone', 'said', 'so', 'SPIDERMAN', 'late', '70', 'TV', 'CAPTAIN', 'AMERICARICHIE', 'RICH', 'one', 'most', 'STEELTEENAGE', 'MUTANT', 'NINJA', 'TURTLES', 'where', 'Turtles', 'personalities', 'turned', 'bunch', 'homies', 'brooklyn', 'worst', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'SCOOBY', 'DOODENNIS', 'THE', 'MENACEDAREDEVIL', 'put', 'ELEKTRA', 'as', 'well', 'side', 'HULK', 'where', 'good-ol', 'greenbag', 'as', 'big', 'King', 'Kong', 'talk', 'over-doing', 'THE', 'MASKI', 'guess', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'based', 'source', 'such', 'tv', 'movie', 'feature', 'including', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'sources', 'other', 'cartoon', 'comics', 'books', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'surfaced', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'RASCALS', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'detractors', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'stank', 'smell', 'only', 'stench', 'purists.RATING', 'Movie', 'Feature=', '2', '10DVD', 'Extra', 'features=', '3', '5']",N/A

I'm surprised that critics didn't like it too - it's very cute for what it is and the removal of Jon's geekiness and the fact that he has a chance with Dr. Liz was a great improvement in my book.  It was quite cute how Garfield goes off to save Odie, especially since it was his fault he became lost anyway. Garfield is the hero in the end again as usual, but it's really cute how he gets there.My only complaint about this movie is that although they used Bill Murray to do Garfield's voice, you get this feeling that there's a ""lid"" on him.  Murry is so funny to start with but it seems like he's not able to ad lib at all in this film.  Meaning, this could have been tremendously funny with him at the helm.  I'm also not too sure that he was exactly the right choice for the voice either.  I almost wanted to hear Eddie Murphy doing Garfield, sorta laid back and cool, but hysterically funny at the same time.  That's a cat - cool but funny.  I think it's hard to combine cool and funny but I can think of quite a few artists that would have been good choices.  How about Chevy Chase or Steve Martin?  Or how about Will Smith?!  I don't know.  Disney learned that a few years ago with Robin Williams when he did Aladdin.  They just ""let him go!"" Most of what he did in Aladdin was not scripted at all but just Williams' own talent coming out.When you put a lid on an actor's humor, it just doesn't transpire nearly as good as it could have and I think that is the whole problem with this movie.

I read all the damning reviews and heard all the negative word of mouth, but clung to my belief that it would be better than everyone seemed to be saying.So, after all the bad press what's the verdict? Well, I am a loss to understand why the first Scooby Doo was successful enough to get a sequel and yet this cute vehicle starring the lovable, lazy kitty got slammed both critically and commercially.Don't get me wrong, I like Scooby and the Mystery Inc. group. But any movie that features the (still) incredible looking Jennifer Love Hewitt and Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield is definitely far from as bad as people say.Okay, let me put in a disclaimer here. I have a weakness of anything with JLH in it - how else can the fact that I liked ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" be explained?Back on subject, produced by Garfield's creator Jim Davis and starring Breckin Meyer of ""Road Trip"" and ""Rat Race"" fame as Garfield's owner Jon, this movie faithfully sticks to the formula that has made Garfield a cultural icon.The voice of Bill Murray seems to flawlessly fit into the previous Garfield voice of the late Lorenzo Music. Murray triumphs in so perfectly capturing the qualities that Music endowed in the characters television appearances that, put side-by-side one simply cannot tell that the same person didn;'t do the voice of Garfield.Here we have what could be considered an beginning story. The movie opens with Garfield as ruler of the roost, comfortable and content to be Jon's sole pet. This set of circumstances is soon threatened however when Jon smitten with sexy veterinarian Liz (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt) asks him to take in the talented pooch Odie.Horror-stricken Garfield does everything to make Odie unhappy, but the dog remains committed to trying to be friends with Garfield - even joinging him on the porch once Garfield is banished from the house.It is here that GARIFIELD takes a page out of TOY STORY in which a shunned Garfield is forced to rescue Odie from the clutches of an evil television host Happy Chapman who uses an electric shock-collar on Odie to make him perform tricks.Special mention here goes to Stephen Tobolowsky who plays Chapman. He plays the part just right for the material here, nicely overacted with just the right amount of sneering menace. For the life of me I could not remember what I had seen him in, until I remembered his part of the nerdy game developer whose voice provides the team in one of my favorite spy movies SNEAKERS with access to the villains lair.The movie is played with such good humor, some true laughs and such a likeable cast of characters (both human, animal and CGI) that its impossible for me to resist its charm. I was caught up in the entire plot and It made me a happy camper. And at a short 82 minutes my only regret was that it was not longer.Far better than you may have thought, give this DVD a spin and see for yourself.",4,"If this is a turkey, then I'll take a triple portion :)",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2966,"['desperately', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'read', 'damning', 'reviews', 'heard', 'negative', 'word', 'mouth', 'clung', 'belief', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'saying.So', 'bad', 'press', 'what', 'verdict', 'Well', 'am', 'loss', 'understand', 'why', 'first', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'was', 'successful', 'enough', 'get', 'sequel', 'yet', 'cute', 'vehicle', 'starring', 'lovable', 'lazy', 'kitty', 'got', 'slammed', 'critically', 'commercially.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'Scooby', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'group', 'movie', 'still', 'incredible', 'looking', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'definitely', 'far', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say.Okay', 'let', 'put', 'disclaimer', 'here', 'have', 'weakness', 'anything', 'JLH', 'how', 'else', 'can', 'fact', 'liked', 'Still', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'be', 'explained', 'Back', 'subject', 'produced', 'Garfield', 'creator', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'starring', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Rat', 'Race', 'fame', 'Garfield', 'owner', 'Jon', 'movie', 'faithfully', 'formula', 'made', 'Garfield', 'cultural', 'icon.The', 'voice', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'flawlessly', 'fit', 'previous', 'Garfield', 'voice', 'late', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'Murray', 'triumphs', 'so', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'qualities', 'Music', 'endowed', 'characters', 'television', 'appearances', 'put', 'side-by-side', 'one', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'same', 'person', 'didn', 'do', 'voice', 'Garfield.Here', 'have', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'beginning', 'story', 'movie', 'Garfield', 'ruler', 'roost', 'comfortable', 'content', 'be', 'Jon', 'sole', 'pet', 'set', 'circumstances', 'soon', 'threatened', 'however', 'when', 'Jon', 'sexy', 'veterinarian', 'Liz', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'take', 'talented', 'pooch', 'Odie.Horror-stricken', 'Garfield', 'everything', 'make', 'Odie', 'unhappy', 'dog', 'committed', 'trying', 'be', 'friends', 'Garfield', 'even', 'joinging', 'porch', 'once', 'Garfield', 'banished', 'house.It', 'here', 'GARIFIELD', 'page', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'shunned', 'Garfield', 'forced', 'rescue', 'Odie', 'clutches', 'evil', 'television', 'host', 'Happy', 'Chapman', 'who', 'electric', 'shock-collar', 'Odie', 'make', 'perform', 'tricks.Special', 'mention', 'here', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'who', 'Chapman', 'part', 'just', 'right', 'material', 'here', 'nicely', 'overacted', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sneering', 'menace', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'remembered', 'part', 'nerdy', 'game', 'developer', 'voice', 'team', 'one', 'favorite', 'spy', 'movies', 'SNEAKERS', 'access', 'villains', 'lair.The', 'movie', 'played', 'such', 'good', 'humor', 'true', 'laughs', 'likeable', 'cast', 'characters', 'human', 'animal', 'CGI', 'impossible', 'resist', 'charm', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'entire', 'plot', 'made', 'happy', 'camper', 'short', '82', 'minutes', 'only', 'regret', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'longer.Far', 'better', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'give', 'DVD', 'spin', 'see']",N/A

As a die-hard Garfield fan, I just didn't know how this movie could compare with the comics.  It seemed like the director was merely out to get some cheap laughs; however, when I saw the film it was rather refreshing to me to see that there was quality in the film.

843385,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0002PYSUQ,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 9]","I blame myself for this.  I knew from the trailers that the movie is going to be bad, and I wanted to avoid this movie with as much common sense as I have, but no. No, I just had to not resist my gaff obsessions with the comic strip character I grew up and love for years, and like a geeky fanboy that I am, rushed to the nearest cinema and see it.  And now, I want to beat the snot out of my fanboy-ish self![REVIEW]20th Century Fox, I ask of you: why?  Why did you do this to me, and to the fans?  Do you think this is suppose to be funny?  Okay, Garfield: The Movie suppose to be, but I'm not laughing.  Sure, a theatrical Garfield film is a good idea...if it's 2-D animated, or maybe a 5-minute short for a much better family film.  But a live-action/3-D animation resembling the style of  ""Scooby Doo"", right away, it leads to personal negative presumptions.  So I watched this movie, presuming it's going to be bad, but no way was I aware how this movie has sunk even deeper into the kitty litter.Garfield was the pet of the house, owned by Jon, until another pet comes around named Odie, and from then gains attention to the crowd more than the cat.  The fat feline became jealous, and just kicked the dog out of house, and later the dog was captured by a notorious newscaster named Happy.  Jon was sad that the dog was missing, and it soon affect Garfield, so the cat was set out the find the dog and--blahdda-blahdda-slab, yeah, it's the same plot coming straight from ""Toy Story.""  The movie could've just add some energy and some devoting fun to excuse the poor overused storyline, unfortunately, none of those, not even a hint of, exist in this movie, even if Garfield and Odie were reduced to follow the clich? G-rated dance-a-thon in one scene and another.  It's a family comedy, and I was leaving the theater sobbing instead of laughing.  That's a bad thing.This is suppose to be a movie based on a comic strip, right?  So why is it that the comic-strip part seems lost in the movie translation?  Speaking of ""lost in translation"", Bill Murray really isn't the right guy to voice a character like Garfield.  He got the smart-aleck thing right, but the tone is entirely different.  Bill's voice seem uplifting and sleek, while Garfield has a more pessimistic, stuffy vocal (Okay, I'm comparing Bill's voice with the one from the 80s cartoon series, but I believe the cartoon Garfield's voice much relates to the comic-strip character).  And speaking of the voices, that's one of many problems on the comic-to-movie translation: the pets don't speak in the comics, they thought-spoke; there's a big difference between those two.  The pets THEMSELVES are another big screw-up: they just don't look like there comic counterparts; Nermal isn't the cute Nermal I know, and Odie is not close of being the laughable mutt. Using real pets is just the crew's way of being cheap; if your gonna make a crappy CG version of Garfield, why not make a crappy CG version of the other pets?  The same problem goes with the brain-dead cast.  Breckin Meyer as Jon...who hired this guy?  He's the biggest screw-up in the transition of comic-strip to movie.  The Jon I read in the comics isn't hot, he's a total dork, he doesn't get any girl, especially not to Jennifer Love Hewitt, and he doesn't sleep with Amy Smart on ""Road Trip.""  I can continue bragging, but you get the idea.This cat got my tongue, but not only that, it got my dignity, my childhood enjoyment, and 90 minutes of my life that I'll never gain back.  It's not funny, it's empty, annoying, and even worse to a Garfield fanatic like myself, Garfield: The Movie nays almost anything from its comic-strip  ounterpart...except for Garfield hating mondays and having a teddy bear named Pookie, but is that enough to save this disaster?  Oh, what am I saying?  For all I said, I'm sure that a certain audience would find something to love with this movie...and that certain audience is under ten, sugar-obsessed, and mostly illiterate who are unfamiliar with its origins (no offense to your children, loving parents).  It could be just me not enjoying this movie because I might be a little unfair and serious with it.  Nah, it's the movie; it's terrible.  Do yourself a favor, fans and individualists alike, avoid this like Garfield avoids raisins.(I wouldn't like to see how the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" fans react if their movie is going to be like this.  They should be thankful that's not gonna happen anytime soon.)",1,"Like Nermal, someone shouldn't send this movie to Abudahbi",1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,4473,"['blame', 'knew', 'trailers', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'common', 'sense', 'have', 'No', 'just', 'had', 'not', 'resist', 'gaff', 'obsessions', 'comic', 'strip', 'character', 'grew', 'up', 'love', 'years', 'geeky', 'fanboy', 'am', 'rushed', 'nearest', 'cinema', 'see', 'now', 'want', 'beat', 'snot', 'fanboy-ish', 'self', '[', 'REVIEW', ']', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'ask', 'why', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'fans', 'Do', 'think', 'suppose', 'be', 'funny', 'Okay', 'Garfield', 'Movie', 'suppose', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'laughing', 'Sure', 'theatrical', 'Garfield', 'film', 'good', 'idea', '2-D', 'animated', 'maybe', '5-minute', 'short', 'much', 'better', 'family', 'film', 'live-action/3-D', 'animation', 'resembling', 'style', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'right', 'away', 'personal', 'negative', 'presumptions', 'So', 'watched', 'movie', 'presuming', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'way', 'was', 'aware', 'how', 'movie', 'sunk', 'even', 'deeper', 'kitty', 'litter.Garfield', 'was', 'pet', 'house', 'owned', 'Jon', 'pet', 'around', 'named', 'Odie', 'then', 'gains', 'attention', 'crowd', 'more', 'cat', 'fat', 'feline', 'became', 'jealous', 'just', 'kicked', 'dog', 'house', 'later', 'dog', 'was', 'captured', 'notorious', 'newscaster', 'named', 'Happy', 'Jon', 'was', 'sad', 'dog', 'was', 'missing', 'soon', 'affect', 'Garfield', 'cat', 'was', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'dog', 'blahdda-blahdda-slab', 'yeah', 'same', 'plot', 'coming', 'straight', 'Toy', 'Story', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'add', 'energy', 'devoting', 'fun', 'excuse', 'poor', 'overused', 'storyline', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'exist', 'movie', 'even', 'Garfield', 'Odie', 'were', 'reduced', 'follow', 'clich', 'G-rated', 'dance-a-thon', 'one', 'scene', 'family', 'comedy', 'was', 'leaving', 'theater', 'sobbing', 'instead', 'laughing', 'bad', 'thing.This', 'suppose', 'be', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'strip', 'right', 'So', 'why', 'comic-strip', 'part', 'lost', 'movie', 'translation', 'Speaking', 'lost', 'translation', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'really', ""n't"", 'right', 'guy', 'voice', 'character', 'Garfield', 'got', 'smart-aleck', 'thing', 'right', 'tone', 'entirely', 'different', 'Bill', 'voice', 'seem', 'uplifting', 'sleek', 'Garfield', 'more', 'pessimistic', 'stuffy', 'vocal', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'Bill', 'voice', 'one', '80s', 'cartoon', 'series', 'believe', 'cartoon', 'Garfield', 'voice', 'much', 'comic-strip', 'character', 'speaking', 'voices', 'one', 'many', 'problems', 'comic-to-movie', 'translation', 'pets', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'comics', 'thought-spoke', 'big', 'difference', 'two', 'pets', 'THEMSELVES', 'are', 'big', 'screw-up', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'there', 'comic', 'counterparts', 'Nermal', ""n't"", 'cute', 'Nermal', 'know', 'Odie', 'not', 'close', 'being', 'laughable', 'mutt', 'Using', 'real', 'pets', 'just', 'crew', 'way', 'being', 'cheap', 'gon', 'make', 'crappy', 'CG', 'version', 'Garfield', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'crappy', 'CG', 'version', 'other', 'pets', 'same', 'problem', 'brain-dead', 'cast', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Jon', 'who', 'hired', 'guy', 'biggest', 'screw-up', 'transition', 'comic-strip', 'movie', 'Jon', 'read', 'comics', ""n't"", 'hot', 'total', 'dork', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'especially', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Road', 'Trip', 'can', 'continue', 'bragging', 'get', 'idea.This', 'cat', 'got', 'tongue', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'dignity', 'childhood', 'enjoyment', '90', 'minutes', 'life', ""'ll"", 'never', 'gain', 'back', 'not', 'funny', 'empty', 'annoying', 'even', 'worse', 'Garfield', 'fanatic', 'Garfield', 'Movie', 'almost', 'anything', 'comic-strip', 'ounterpart', 'Garfield', 'hating', 'mondays', 'having', 'teddy', 'bear', 'named', 'Pookie', 'enough', 'save', 'disaster', 'Oh', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'said', ""'m"", 'sure', 'certain', 'audience', 'would', 'find', 'something', 'love', 'movie', 'certain', 'audience', 'ten', 'sugar-obsessed', 'mostly', 'illiterate', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'origins', 'offense', 'children', 'loving', 'parents', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'not', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'unfair', 'serious', 'Nah', 'movie', 'terrible', 'Do', 'favor', 'fans', 'individualists', 'alike', 'avoid', 'like', 'Garfield', 'avoids', 'raisins', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'how', 'Calvin', 'Hobbes', 'fans', 'react', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'not', 'gon', 'happen', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

Curious, I decided to pick up a copy of the movie the other day, and was actually pleased at the way he was presented, although the other characters lacked the same substance they do in the said comic and cartoon.First off, I noticed the house was not Jon's. Odie is depicted as a regular sort of dog, and no use of that slurping tongue which is his primary characteristic was used. In My opinion, he should have also been rendered in CGI animation to capture that full effect. Nermil is not the cute and cuddly kitten either - just an onlooker hanging out with the neighborhood cats. And even Jon himself was rather dissappointing - he seemed to lack the personality of the original, and really ends up being presented like a milksop, who actually has good fortune with a pretty young thing, instead of the steady strems of failed dates he usually experienced.Here, Garfield is introduced to Odie when Jon adopts him in an effort to impress a female vet, but ends up establishing a genuine rapport for the dog, taking attention away from Garfield, who will have none of that. Odie eventually impresses a judging panel at a dog show {using moves Garfield taught him!}, and becomes coveted by a gameshow host, seeing him as a possible ticket to the big time. So, after Garfiield uses his wiley ways to trick Odie out of the house, he runs away - Jon, distressed, places Lost signs about the neighborhood, which is brought to the gameshow host's attention, and basically ends up dognapping Odie after lying to an impressionable old lady who finds the pup on her porch. Feeling guilty, Garfield embarks upon a trek to the Big City to rescue Odie from the clutches of Mr. ""Happy Chapman"" who had actually affixed the pooch with an shock collar, but is himself imprisoned by Animal Control, but this is only a temporary setback. With the help of a street-talking rat, Garfield eventually employs the aid of some other animals to punish Chapman while implementing some poetic justice. And finally, Garfield learns the value of Odie's friendship, but still enjoys pushing him off the couch, instead of the kitchen table.Bill Murray did do a good job with the voice {although I still would have liked to have heard Lorenzo Music instead}, and the Garfield kinematics were actually smooth and worked well to create the illusion of a living being. I believe the film would have been better produced using total CGI. The film does not match the cartoon strip or show, but is still an amusing movie for fans of this orange feline lasagnaphile.",3,Please pass the lasagna...,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2821,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Garfield', 'ever', 'followed', 'comics', 'local', 'newspaper', 'then', 'subsequent', 'cartoon', 'excellent', 'timelessly', 'amusing', 'so', 'imagine', 'My', 'delight', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'be', 'film', 'based', 'feline', 'icon', 'time', 'completely', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'Curious', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'was', 'actually', 'pleased', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'other', 'characters', 'lacked', 'same', 'substance', 'do', 'said', 'comic', 'cartoon.First', 'off', 'noticed', 'house', 'was', 'not', 'Jon', 'Odie', 'depicted', 'regular', 'sort', 'dog', 'use', 'slurping', 'tongue', 'primary', 'characteristic', 'was', 'used', 'My', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'animation', 'capture', 'full', 'effect', 'Nermil', 'not', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'kitten', 'just', 'onlooker', 'hanging', 'out', 'neighborhood', 'cats', 'even', 'Jon', 'was', 'rather', 'dissappointing', 'seemed', 'lack', 'personality', 'original', 'really', 'up', 'being', 'presented', 'milksop', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'fortune', 'pretty', 'young', 'thing', 'instead', 'steady', 'strems', 'failed', 'dates', 'usually', 'experienced.Here', 'Garfield', 'introduced', 'Odie', 'when', 'Jon', 'effort', 'impress', 'female', 'vet', 'up', 'establishing', 'genuine', 'rapport', 'dog', 'taking', 'attention', 'away', 'Garfield', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'Odie', 'eventually', 'judging', 'panel', 'dog', 'show', 'using', 'moves', 'Garfield', 'taught', 'becomes', 'coveted', 'gameshow', 'host', 'seeing', 'possible', 'ticket', 'big', 'time', 'So', 'Garfiield', 'wiley', 'ways', 'trick', 'Odie', 'house', 'away', 'Jon', 'distressed', 'places', 'Lost', 'signs', 'neighborhood', 'brought', 'gameshow', 'host', 'attention', 'basically', 'up', 'dognapping', 'Odie', 'lying', 'impressionable', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'pup', 'porch', 'Feeling', 'guilty', 'Garfield', 'trek', 'Big', 'City', 'rescue', 'Odie', 'clutches', 'Mr.', 'Happy', 'Chapman', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'affixed', 'pooch', 'shock', 'collar', 'imprisoned', 'Animal', 'Control', 'only', 'temporary', 'setback', 'help', 'street-talking', 'rat', 'Garfield', 'eventually', 'aid', 'other', 'animals', 'punish', 'Chapman', 'implementing', 'poetic', 'justice', 'finally', 'Garfield', 'value', 'Odie', 'friendship', 'still', 'pushing', 'off', 'couch', 'instead', 'kitchen', 'table.Bill', 'Murray', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'voice', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'instead', 'Garfield', 'kinematics', 'were', 'actually', 'smooth', 'worked', 'well', 'create', 'illusion', 'living', 'being', 'believe', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'produced', 'using', 'total', 'CGI', 'film', 'not', 'match', 'cartoon', 'strip', 'show', 'still', 'amusing', 'movie', 'fans', 'orange', 'feline', 'lasagnaphile']",N/A

843390,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0002PYSUQ,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[0, 1]","Unless your a baby or have been in a coma for the last 25 years, Garfield is America's favorite comic book strip cat. He appears in newspapers, and there are comic room treasuries that are all about him. They finally decided to release it into a movie, in the ""Scooby Doo"" fashion. Make everything except the title character real, and then have the title character been created by using computers. The reason why this movie isn't as good as it could of been is for two reasons. The first reason is the plot. Last summer, Disney and Pixar came out with a movie called ""Finding Nemo"" which was about a fish trying to find his son in the middle of the ocean. Garfield has the plot about finding his dog in the city. The two aren't exactly the same, but they are similar. The second problem is Jennifer Love Hewitt. The women just cannot act, and she's proven so already in almost every movie that she's been in. She should quit while she's ahead.The movie is about Garfield, who is voiced by Bill Murrey, good call. Garfield is a ""happy, fat, lazy, cat"" who only wants to eat, sleep, and watch television. He wakes up ""his human"" Jon every mourning to make sure he is fed, and he speads his days doing just about nothing. That is, until Jon becomes attracted to the vet, Liz, who he had a crush on in high school. Garfield's life changes when Liz gives Jon a dog named Odie. Garfield senses competition, and locks him outside, causing him to run away. He is found by an old women, who puts up posters claiming that she found a dog. The TV host Happy Chapman tells the women that the dog is his, so he could expand his career. Garfield decides to go find Odie, after seeing how upset Jon is, embarking himself on a quest around the city with the help of rats, cats, and dogs.""Garfield"" had a ""been there, done that"" storyline. The movie shouldn't have had a story. The best parts in the movie come from the beginning, or the first twenty fine minutes, before Odie comes into the story. We get to see more of Garfield's life, and his relationship with the other animals around the cul-de-sac. Those are the most entertaining scenes, but once the dog and the story started, the movie started going downhill. Billy Murrey was good as the voice of Garfield, and he brought the very laziness of the cat that mostly all of us know and love. ""Garfield"" was a good movie, but it can't be seen more than once.Before the movie was an animated short called ""Gone Nutty"", which is also featured on the ""Ice Age"" DVD. It is about Scrat, the squrrel, who loses his big collection of acorns, eventually having him trying to catch them all in the air, and leading to him getting hurt, hit, and finished. The short is also entertaining, but it's nothing to talk about.Garfield 3/5Gone Nutty 3/5ENJOY!Garfield-Rated PG for brief mild language.Gone Nutty-Rated G",3,"A ""Been Used to Death"" Plot in a Not So Bad Movie!",1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,2839,"['baby', 'have', 'been', 'coma', 'last', '25', 'years', 'Garfield', 'America', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'strip', 'cat', 'newspapers', 'are', 'comic', 'room', 'treasuries', 'are', 'finally', 'decided', 'release', 'movie', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'fashion', 'Make', 'everything', 'title', 'character', 'real', 'then', 'have', 'title', 'character', 'been', 'created', 'using', 'computers', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'could', 'been', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'reason', 'plot', 'Last', 'summer', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'called', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'was', 'fish', 'trying', 'find', 'son', 'middle', 'ocean', 'Garfield', 'plot', 'finding', 'dog', 'city', 'two', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'same', 'are', 'similar', 'second', 'problem', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'women', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'proven', 'so', 'already', 'almost', 'movie', 'been', 'should', 'quit', 'ahead.The', 'movie', 'Garfield', 'who', 'voiced', 'Bill', 'Murrey', 'good', 'call', 'Garfield', 'happy', 'fat', 'lazy', 'cat', 'who', 'only', 'eat', 'sleep', 'watch', 'television', 'up', 'human', 'Jon', 'mourning', 'make', 'sure', 'fed', 'days', 'doing', 'just', 'nothing', 'Jon', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'vet', 'Liz', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'high', 'school', 'Garfield', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'Liz', 'Jon', 'dog', 'named', 'Odie', 'Garfield', 'competition', 'outside', 'causing', 'run', 'away', 'found', 'old', 'women', 'who', 'up', 'posters', 'claiming', 'found', 'dog', 'TV', 'host', 'Happy', 'Chapman', 'women', 'dog', 'could', 'expand', 'career', 'Garfield', 'go', 'find', 'Odie', 'seeing', 'how', 'upset', 'Jon', 'embarking', 'quest', 'city', 'help', 'rats', 'cats', 'dogs', 'Garfield', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'storyline', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'story', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'come', 'beginning', 'first', 'twenty', 'fine', 'minutes', 'Odie', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Garfield', 'life', 'relationship', 'other', 'animals', 'cul-de-sac', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'once', 'dog', 'story', 'started', 'movie', 'started', 'going', 'downhill', 'Billy', 'Murrey', 'was', 'good', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'brought', 'very', 'laziness', 'cat', 'mostly', 'know', 'love', 'Garfield', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'animated', 'short', 'called', 'Gone', 'Nutty', 'also', 'featured', 'Ice', 'Age', 'DVD', 'Scrat', 'squrrel', 'who', 'big', 'collection', 'acorns', 'eventually', 'having', 'trying', 'catch', 'air', 'leading', 'getting', 'hurt', 'hit', 'finished', 'short', 'also', 'entertaining', 'nothing', 'talk', '3/5Gone', 'Nutty', '3/5ENJOY', 'Garfield-Rated', 'PG', 'brief', 'mild', 'language.Gone', 'Nutty-Rated', 'G']",N/A

Considering that Lorenzo always was just a cheap substitute for Bill Murray anyway (think of the Ghostbusters cartoon series), and considering that he's dead now, this is not really such a big deal.The problem also does not lie in their choice of what to do with CGI and what to do with live-action. In the comic/cartoon, Garfield looked more or less like an actual cat, while Odie looked more like a boot with legs than like a dog; this apparently did not stop the movie's creators from counterintuitively doing Garfield in CGI and Odie as a real dog. However, such a tremendous lapse in logic is perfectly understandable, since the movie's creators have probably never actually seen the comic/cartoon, as evidenced by Garfield's lack of black stripes.No, the problem with this movie lies deeper. Like everyone else, I loved the Garfield comics and cartoons. But this movie is the epitome of everything that I've come to hate about hollywood: the rampant abuse of CGI that is plaguing the industry, and the recent habit of making live-action movies of things that should NEVER be seen in live-action format (think Inspector Gadget, Mr. Magoo, George of the Jungle, Scooby Doo 1 and 2, Dennis the Menace, Super Dave, the very shortly-lived The Tick series, etc.)The only movie more fundamentally wrong than this would be a live-action Bobby's World or Ren and Stimpy. No wait, Howie Mandel is still alive to do the voice of a CGI Bobby Generick, so that would be only slightly less wrong.

Having Bill Murray voice Garfield was a good move, since Lorenzo Music had also voiced Murray's old GHOSTBUSTERS character Venkman for the cartoon continuation of that film, but Garfield himself wasn't as anthropomorphic as he is in the strip and animated shows.  Breckin Meyer was a good call for Jon, but Jennifer Love Hewitt is far too nice a person to be the usually cranky Liz.  Naturally they couldn't find real cats and dogs to portray Arlene and Odie as they appear in the strip, but making Nermal a Siamese with the Brooklynish voice of David Eigenberg rather than a gray tabby with a high-pitched chirpy voice like Desiree Goyette did for the cartoons was a really bad move.

When the movie came out, I wasn't sure how this was going to work as it was a blend of animation and live-action.

In the movie, the writers seem compelled to force all the most famous one-liners into the movie.

843406,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0002PYSUQ,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 7]","I finally sat down with my kids on this one and it was just ridiculous to me. The kids love it of course because they found the cat funny. I have to agree on what some critics have said: Garfield is old and busted. The movie is, sadly, 10 years overdue. Just look at the long listing of Garfield TV specials, most of which are 1982-1992, and ""Garfield and Friends"" began in 1988. It was delayed, I read, because Jim Davis believed the technology wasn't there. It was; it's called regular animation. Garfield is a 2-D medium, either on the comics page or on animated cells. But, I guess, since no one does that anymore, 2004 couldn't have a 2-D Garfield.The problem is not necessarily with the CGI Garfield and his actions, although some of the characteristics displayed are not those I associate with the cat. The problem is with the supporting cast who look, by and large, not like their animated counterparts. Who made Odie a wiener dog with talent? Why is Nermal Siamese and not the ""world's cutest kitty-cat""? Shouldn't Arlene be a lot nicer to Garfield? (By the way, since Odie has no speaking lines in either the strip or show, the movie's similar lack is accurate.)The set design, in bright hues, can't decide whether it's in the real world or in a real-life comic strip. Breckin Meyer (""Inside Schwartz"") is just not the right fit for Jon. He's too likable to be our comic-strip loser. While I can accept the whole high-school-crush of Jon and Liz on each other (something definitely not in the comic strip), the payoff would have been better had the tension not vanished prematurely.The plot arc is not necessarily departed from all of Garfield. It fits more in the mid-1980s, when the strip actually did have week-plus-long plots. In one series, for example, Odie DID leave home, and Garfield DID follow him, and they ended up running away from the circus together. Those citing rip-offs from ""Toy Story"" and other similar movies should note the 1982 TV special ""Here Comes Garfield"" shares many elements of both movies and so this movie doesn't take from Pixar, but rather from itself 20 years ago.I wish that the networks would put ""A Garfield Christmas"" and some of his other specials back on the air; it would build more interest in him. I still love the character. The movie doesn't deserve to be ranked as low as it is by the critics. At the same time, though, it reminds you of how good it might have been. As Garfield has attempted to extend its ""brand"" by licensing to Cub Scouts and 4-H, you can't help but think it's grasping for an audience that never became fans like the previous generation did.I can't bring myself to demolish a character that still makes me laugh, even if his best work was from when I was young enough to be in the target audience. And even that rating is being nice compared to those who want this cat and its empire put to sleep.Better luck next time kitty.",2,Oh Man.......Are you Kidding Me?......They destroyed my cat!,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,2903,"['finally', 'sat', 'down', 'kids', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'kids', 'love', 'course', 'found', 'cat', 'funny', 'have', 'agree', 'what', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'Garfield', 'old', 'busted', 'movie', 'sadly', '10', 'years', 'overdue', 'Just', 'look', 'long', 'listing', 'Garfield', 'TV', 'specials', 'most', 'are', '1982-1992', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'began', '1988', 'was', 'delayed', 'read', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'believed', 'technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'called', 'regular', 'animation', 'Garfield', '2-D', 'medium', 'either', 'comics', 'page', 'animated', 'cells', 'guess', 'one', 'anymore', '2004', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', '2-D', 'Garfield.The', 'problem', 'not', 'necessarily', 'CGI', 'Garfield', 'actions', 'characteristics', 'displayed', 'are', 'not', 'associate', 'cat', 'problem', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'look', 'large', 'not', 'animated', 'counterparts', 'Who', 'made', 'Odie', 'wiener', 'dog', 'talent', 'Why', 'Nermal', 'Siamese', 'not', 'world', 'cutest', 'kitty-cat', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Arlene', 'be', 'lot', 'nicer', 'Garfield', 'way', 'Odie', 'speaking', 'lines', 'strip', 'show', 'movie', 'similar', 'lack', 'accurate', 'set', 'design', 'bright', 'hues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'real', 'world', 'real-life', 'comic', 'strip', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Inside', 'Schwartz', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'fit', 'Jon', 'too', 'likable', 'be', 'comic-strip', 'loser', 'can', 'accept', 'whole', 'high-school-crush', 'Jon', 'Liz', 'other', 'something', 'definitely', 'not', 'comic', 'strip', 'payoff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'tension', 'not', 'vanished', 'prematurely.The', 'plot', 'arc', 'not', 'necessarily', 'departed', 'Garfield', 'more', 'mid-1980s', 'when', 'strip', 'actually', 'did', 'have', 'week-plus-long', 'plots', 'one', 'series', 'example', 'Odie', 'DID', 'leave', 'home', 'Garfield', 'DID', 'follow', 'ended', 'up', 'running', 'away', 'circus', 'together', 'citing', 'rip-offs', 'Toy', 'Story', 'other', 'similar', 'movies', 'should', 'note', '1982', 'TV', 'special', 'Here', 'Garfield', 'shares', 'many', 'elements', 'movies', 'so', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'Pixar', 'rather', '20', 'years', 'ago.I', 'wish', 'networks', 'would', 'put', 'A', 'Garfield', 'Christmas', 'other', 'specials', 'back', 'air', 'would', 'build', 'more', 'interest', 'still', 'love', 'character', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'ranked', 'as', 'low', 'critics', 'same', 'time', 'though', 'how', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Garfield', 'attempted', 'extend', 'brand', 'licensing', 'Cub', 'Scouts', '4-H', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'grasping', 'audience', 'never', 'became', 'fans', 'previous', 'generation', 'did.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'demolish', 'character', 'still', 'even', 'best', 'work', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'target', 'audience', 'even', 'rating', 'being', 'nice', 'compared', 'who', 'want', 'cat', 'empire', 'put', 'sleep.Better', 'luck', 'next', 'time', 'kitty']",N/A

843414,A19N15QU7VHM0F,B0002PYSUQ,Joshua M. Guillemette,"[1, 1]","My son is a pretty typical 10 year old, and he asked me to rent Garfield for our Friday night movie. Needless to say, because I am writing this review, that his request was granted. As this movie was chosen by a child and watched by the whole family I will present two views: my son's, and my own.My son thought the movie was amusing. I choose my words carefully here because there were no guffaws during the whole movie from my son. He likes talking animals and dancing pets and is entertained by the usual knocking things over and breaking things required in this type of movie. However, he did not get as excited about this movie as ""Sinbad"" which we watched two weeks ago. I think he is growing up and dancing dogs just do not make the cut anymore. So if you have a typical 10-12 year old do not look for great enthusiasm for this movie.That said, I found the movie dull. Sure, it was cute. Yes, the dancing pets made me smirk. Yes, Bill Murray did a great job and was perfect for the voice. However, the movie was extremely predictable from the first frames to the last and was somewhat slow for a movie aimed at youngsters. The only thing that was out of the ordinary, I felt, was Jennifer Love Hewitt's character's forwardness.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 1]","He's orange, fat, rude, and has a cravin' for lasagna, and in the movie so aptly named for him, ""Garfield"" manages to entertain a broad demographic.  There's something cute and cuddly about having the overweight CGI cat intermingle with live-action dogs and cats.  All of the scenes involving real animals were funny, and were downright hilarious to my three year-old.  My little daughter laughed at Garfield and Odie as they danced to the Black-Eyed Peas.  She laughed when Stephen Tobolowsky and Garfield had it out at the train station.  She loved watching Nermal go flying out of the bucket so that Garfield could get a shot of milk without leaving the ""cul-de-sac."" All of these antics worked well to bring in the youngsters.What made ""Garfield"" appealing to the older crowd was the fat cat's attitude.  He's lazy, hateful, and a huge underachiever.  That's what makes him so fun to watch on the screen.  He managed to be just offensive enough to bring in the adults, but remained soft and fluffy enough for the kids at the same time.Bill Murray is great as the voice of our obese feline.  Jennifer Love Hewitt does a pretty good job as the sexy vet who has a thing for Jon.  Stephen Tobolowsky who, in my opinion, is very underrated, stole the show as the jealous brother of a big-time TV anchor.  He plans to use Odie as his new meal-ticket to success.  The only shortcoming of this movie is Breckin Meyer, who seems to be severely miscast as Jon Arbuckle.  He's just too gooey-gooey good.  I know that Jon's always been a nervous wreck around women, and that he loves Garfield and Odie more than anything, but Meyer just came across as too much of a loser instead of the shy geek I remembered Jon to be.  Luckily for us, the humans in this flick are used sparingly, so he doesn't become too much of a nuisance.I recommend this flick to anybody looking for a good family flick that appeals to all age groups.

843419,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,B0002PYSUQ,K. Jump,"[3, 4]","Fans of the long-running comic strip get to see their favorite fat cat come to bold life in this pleasant family film featuring Bill Murray as the voice of the one-and-only Garfield.  The story:  Garfield's owner (um, primary caregiver--sorry Garfield), love-struck Jon Arbuckle, takes his favorite feline to the sexy local vet Liz for yet another unnecessary check-up so he can strike out one more time. But Garfield's easy life as the apple of Jon's eye is about to get unceremoniously upended--when Liz asks Jon to adopt a homeless dog named Odie, the lovestruck guy just can't turn her down, much to Garfield's chagrin.  Garfield goes out of his way to roll out the unwelcome wagon, but somehow Odie just never gets the hint.  But if Garfield doesn't want Odie a local TV personality does, and when Happy Chapman kidnaps the hapless canine Garfield surprises everyone--most of all himself--by setting out to rescue him.Granted, this is not high drama, but it is a harmless, fun picture that is particularly good for kids and which adult fans of the classic strip should enjoy as well.  There's nothing even remotely offensive in the whole movie, with some nice messages about family and friendship to boot.  Murray's laconic, self-indulgent inflections are perfect for the narcissistic Garfield, and it's easy to imagine most of his lines coming right from the comic.  Breckin Meyer does a good job as the rather backward Jon, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is highly appealing as the seemingly unattainable object of his affections.  The only film element I question is the decision to make Garfield the only animated character in the whole cast.  It would've probably been better to either make all the animals animated or, better yet, use a real cat for Garfield.  As it is, Garfield certainly stands out--but maybe too much.  But after all, isn't that how Garfield himself would want it?  No, ""Garfield:  The Movie"" is not the best thing since ""Macbeth"" and it won't win any Academy Awards, but it is positive cinematic fun the whole family can watch together--and that makes it a winner in my book.",3,GARFIELD HAS LEFT THE CUL-DE-SAC!,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,2101,"['Fans', 'long-running', 'comic', 'strip', 'get', 'see', 'favorite', 'fat', 'cat', 'come', 'bold', 'life', 'pleasant', 'family', 'film', 'featuring', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'voice', 'one-and-only', 'Garfield', 'story', 'Garfield', 'owner', 'um', 'primary', 'caregiver', 'sorry', 'Garfield', 'love-struck', 'Jon', 'Arbuckle', 'favorite', 'feline', 'sexy', 'local', 'vet', 'Liz', 'yet', 'unnecessary', 'check-up', 'can', 'strike', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Garfield', 'easy', 'life', 'apple', 'Jon', 'eye', 'get', 'unceremoniously', 'upended', 'when', 'Liz', 'Jon', 'adopt', 'homeless', 'dog', 'named', 'Odie', 'lovestruck', 'guy', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'down', 'much', 'Garfield', 'chagrin', 'Garfield', 'way', 'roll', 'out', 'unwelcome', 'wagon', 'somehow', 'Odie', 'just', 'never', 'hint', 'Garfield', ""n't"", 'want', 'Odie', 'local', 'TV', 'personality', 'when', 'Happy', 'Chapman', 'hapless', 'canine', 'Garfield', 'everyone', 'most', 'setting', 'out', 'rescue', 'him.Granted', 'not', 'high', 'drama', 'harmless', 'fun', 'picture', 'particularly', 'good', 'kids', 'adult', 'fans', 'classic', 'strip', 'should', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'offensive', 'whole', 'movie', 'nice', 'messages', 'family', 'friendship', 'boot', 'Murray', 'laconic', 'self-indulgent', 'inflections', 'are', 'perfect', 'narcissistic', 'Garfield', 'easy', 'imagine', 'most', 'lines', 'coming', 'right', 'comic', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'good', 'job', 'rather', 'backward', 'Jon', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'highly', 'appealing', 'seemingly', 'unattainable', 'object', 'affections', 'only', 'film', 'element', 'question', 'decision', 'make', 'Garfield', 'only', 'animated', 'character', 'whole', 'cast', 'would', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'been', 'better', 'make', 'animals', 'animated', 'better', 'yet', 'use', 'real', 'cat', 'Garfield', 'Garfield', 'certainly', 'out', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'how', 'Garfield', 'would', 'want', 'No', 'Garfield', 'Movie', 'not', 'best', 'thing', 'Macbeth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'positive', 'cinematic', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'winner', 'book']",N/A

843421,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B0002PYSUQ,Kyle Slayzar,"[2, 2]","I purposely went in with very few expectations of this film.  I grew up with Garfield as a kid in the 80s, reading the comics in the daily newspaper, watching Garfield and Friends on TV and getting the comics at my school book fair.  Garfield was a part of me while growing up, much like Ninja Turtles and GI Joe was for other kids during that time.  So I knew meeting up to the legend would be difficult, especially without the original voice of Garfield, however, that could not be helped since Lorenzo Music died 3 years ago.Bill Murray did an good job for what he had to work with.  He had to fill the shoes of Lorenzo Music, who was THE embodiment of Garfield and many of us veteran Garfield fans would be critical of his performance.  He had the saracsm and cynicism down almost perfectly, which is what Garfield is known for and why his popularity spread amongst kids and adults alike.I remember Breckin Meyer for his nice-guy role in Rat Race and was not surprised to see him playing almost the exact same character in Garfield; nice and shy.  Now the original John was nice but NOT shy... just really, really, really dorkish.  He wore disco outfits, dressed up his animals and cat-called every girl he saw.  I liked the ol' dorky John that never seemed to get a break... or a clue.Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Liz, the vet.  In the old comics, Liz didn't show any interest in John whatsoever... to his face at least, but you get hints of it here and there since she keeps reappearing.  In the movie, she's all flirty with John and practically hits on him.  Not to mention she seems kinda ditzy, especially the outfits she wears, I can't tell if she's dressed up for work or for prom.Nermal and Arlene were characters that the director skewed beyond recognition.  Nermal's schitck in the comics and in the cartoon was the annoying, cute grey kitten that always got shipped to Abu Dhabi.  Why didn't they include THAT?!  I loved it when Garfield would torture poor Nermal, that was what Nermal was all about.  You do not get any of that in the movie and I was greatly disapointed.  Arlene was supposed to be Garfield's girlfriend that lacked all the attention despite her advances on him... didn't get that in the movie either.Last but not least of my complaints; the villian.  Um... lame.  I agree with many reviewers here that an evil Binky the Clown would've fit... well, maybe a bit over the top, but the one they chose was really lame.  I think Bill O'Reilly or Michael Moore would've made a better villian.There were some complaints about Garfield being the only CG character, and I think they should've made Odie in CG just to capture his tongue attack, something many Garfield fans have come to know and love to hate at the same time.However, if you strip away the legend of Garfield prior to this movie's release, it wasn't all that bad.  I enjoyed the movie personally, they stuck to several old jokes from the comics and even though I saw them coming a mile away, it rekindled my childhood memories of Garfield and that's what counts to me.  This movie could've been incredible, however, Jim Davis seems to be losing his touch and it's really a shame.",3,"Didn't meet up to the Legend, but still a good movie",1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,3167,"['purposely', 'went', 'very', 'few', 'expectations', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'Garfield', 'kid', '80s', 'reading', 'comics', 'daily', 'newspaper', 'watching', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'TV', 'getting', 'comics', 'school', 'book', 'fair', 'Garfield', 'was', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'much', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'GI', 'Joe', 'was', 'other', 'kids', 'time', 'So', 'knew', 'meeting', 'up', 'legend', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'especially', 'original', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'died', '3', 'years', 'ago.Bill', 'Murray', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'had', 'fill', 'shoes', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'who', 'was', 'THE', 'embodiment', 'Garfield', 'many', 'veteran', 'Garfield', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'critical', 'performance', 'had', 'saracsm', 'cynicism', 'down', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'what', 'Garfield', 'known', 'why', 'popularity', 'spread', 'amongst', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike.I', 'remember', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'nice-guy', 'role', 'Rat', 'Race', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'playing', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'character', 'Garfield', 'nice', 'shy', 'Now', 'original', 'John', 'was', 'nice', 'NOT', 'shy', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'dorkish', 'wore', 'disco', 'outfits', 'dressed', 'up', 'animals', 'cat-called', 'girl', 'saw', 'liked', 'ol', 'dorky', 'John', 'never', 'seemed', 'get', 'break', 'clue.Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Liz', 'vet', 'old', 'comics', 'Liz', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'interest', 'John', 'whatsoever', 'face', 'least', 'get', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'reappearing', 'movie', 'flirty', 'John', 'practically', 'hits', 'Not', 'mention', 'kinda', 'ditzy', 'especially', 'outfits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'dressed', 'up', 'work', 'prom.Nermal', 'Arlene', 'were', 'characters', 'director', 'skewed', 'recognition', 'Nermal', 'schitck', 'comics', 'cartoon', 'was', 'annoying', 'cute', 'grey', 'kitten', 'always', 'got', 'shipped', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'loved', 'when', 'Garfield', 'would', 'torture', 'poor', 'Nermal', 'was', 'what', 'Nermal', 'was', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'greatly', 'disapointed', 'Arlene', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Garfield', 'girlfriend', 'lacked', 'attention', 'advances', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'either.Last', 'not', 'least', 'complaints', 'villian', 'Um', 'lame', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'evil', 'Binky', 'Clown', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fit', 'well', 'maybe', 'bit', 'top', 'one', 'chose', 'was', 'really', 'lame', 'think', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'Michael', 'Moore', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'better', 'villian.There', 'were', 'complaints', 'Garfield', 'being', 'only', 'CG', 'character', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Odie', 'CG', 'just', 'capture', 'tongue', 'attack', 'something', 'many', 'Garfield', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'hate', 'same', 'time.However', 'strip', 'away', 'legend', 'Garfield', 'prior', 'movie', 'release', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'personally', 'stuck', 'several', 'old', 'jokes', 'comics', 'even', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'rekindled', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Garfield', 'what', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'incredible', 'however', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'be', 'losing', 'touch', 'really', 'shame']",N/A

Trouble arises one day when, under the influence of the beautiful veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield's owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) stuns him by bringing home a cuddly dog, Odie.

The interaction between the animated Garfield and the real actors and sets is subtle, rather than the eye-popping wow! of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Unlike better family films such as Shrek or Finding Nemo, this one is strictly for kids as there is little to keep an adult's interest.The movie starts out with a few scene-setting vignettes, brief unconnected tales much like the Jim Davis comic strip the movie was lifted from.  But right away something is amiss.  Jon, Garfield's human, isn't presented as a complete loser.  He lives in a very nice house in an unspecified part of the midwest that looks suspiciously like Oak Park or a similar John Hughes location.  The furnishings are tasteful and reasonable quality.  And Jon isn't completly incompetent in his day to day actions.And what's worse, Jon's unrequited feelings for Garfield's veterinarian, Liz, are not thrown in his face (as per the strip) but returned within the first 20 minutes.  The vet character is just as wrong as Jon; both are cute, thin, and dress well.  Jon should be a zhlub, Liz should be strictly business.  Here, Jon's a heartthrob and Liz dresses like she's on her way to a disco.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!The major plot point is okay (evil cable-TV animal show host kidnaps Odie after dog wins a blue ribbon, Garfield rescues him), the animated Garfield is done well, and the status quo is preserved.

I've been hooked on the feline since the first time I saw the classic cartoon show as a kid in the late eighties and early nineties. I was kind of excited to hear about the upcoming movie version. I orignialy had very high expectations but realized that would of have ruined the movie for me. I'm glad I lowered because I really did enjoy this moive.Garfield(Murray) is a fat lazy happy cat. He hates Mondays and loves lasagna. He lives with his happy owner Jon(Meyer). They have a pretty simple life and both seem to be happy.One day when Jon takes Garfield to see the vet. He's been doing it a lot lately because of the veternarian Liz(Jennifer Love Hewitt) who he has a crush on and has had since high school. Liz likes Jon and thinks he's a good pet owner. She gives him a dog Odie to take care of alongside his feline Garfield.Garfield protests to the dog and does everything he can to make it leave. One day Jon and Liz go to a dog show. Odie under the chaotic circumstances that Garfield causes at the show ends up winning first prize as the best dog. Odie is spotted there by Happy(Tobolowsky) whos is a tv personality looking for a dog for his big act. He wants Odie for his own and is upset when Jon won't sign with him.Garfield being jealous of Odie has a small accident at the house when they get home. Jon is made and throws hime out. Odie feeling bad for Garfield goes outside to comfort him, and that where Garfield traps him outside. Odie runs away from home and the search for him is on. He is found by Happy who plans on using the dog for his own good. It's now up to Garfield to save the day and find Odie so Jon can stay with Liz.I liked the CGI that they used for Garfield. It reminds me a lot of Scooby Doo, though this is a much better movie. Bill Murray is the perfect guy to voice Garfield. Garfield is the epitome of sarcasm and nobody in the world is as sarcastic as Murray. He does a perfect job with as the voice and I love it when he sings.I liked Meyer as Jon. He wasn't quite enough of a loser, but he did a good job. I loved Jennifer Love Hewitt. She's hot and she really is in the movie. Jon in the comic strip would never have gotten a girl like her, but I'm not going to complain that she was in this.This is a great family movie. My broters and sisters liked it a lot. Hardcore Garfield fans aren't going to like this one a lot. However if you want to take the kids to a good clean movie than this is it. It's a fun 90 minutes at the movies.

843430,A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ,B0002PYSUQ,"Matt Russell ""superk23""","[3, 4]","CGI has allowed another classic character to come alive on the big screen.  This time it comes in the form of that fat cat, Garfield.  Even though Garfield cannot compare to CGI created armies of humans, an ex-hobit Gollum, or stampeding dinosaurs, Garfield is probably the best animal character I have seen (compared to the likes of Scooby Doo, Kangaroo Jack, etc.).  It would have been nice to have seen a CGI Odie to make him look more like the cartoon strip, but I suppose that would take away from the star, and the real dog grows on you anyways.As for the story, here it goes.  The film starts out with pictures of the life of Garfield from small kitten to the cat he has become.  A fan of the franchise could not help but smile during this panning of pictures.  We are quickly introduced to Jon Arbuckle (Brekin Meyer) and the surprisingly attractive veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) that just happens to be the love of Jon's life, aside from Garfield of course.  Here, Jon takes in Odie.Odie is quickly introduced to his new home, shown the ropes, and treated very well.  This makes Garfield feel a little like he has been left out and decides he doesn't really care much for the canine.  One night, Odie is lost and a search and rescue must take place.  It turns out that Odie has been picked up by the movie's villain Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky).  Happy is a struggling cat food marketer who needs a dog, Odie, to become more famous.  So, Garfield, Jon, and Liz each try to find Odie on a chase of tricks, turns, and laughs.Garfield is not a great movie in any way.  However, the movie did make me smile and there were a couple of parts that had me laughing.  One was the dance sequence that can be seen on the trailers.  One reason I may have been laughing was because the rest of the audience was laughing.  I have been told it is contagious.  Nonetheless, it was one of the better scenes.  There is also cute scenes involving Garfield in his bed with his teddy bear, Pookie.  Garfield also provides some one-liners and little spots that I won't discuss in order not to ruin them.One thing I must praise is hiring Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield.  There is just something about Bill Murray that can make a person laugh.  It doesn't matter how bad the movie is, something about him draws a person to his character, even if he is disguised as an overweight, orange cat.  The way he can deliver a line really gives Garfield the personality that he needs.  Even if the movie has pepped him up a little from his normal eat, sleep, watch tv day.A problem with the film is the running time, at a short 85 minutes.  Of course, some of this is the ending credits.  Anyhow, that's not enough to not recommend seeing it at least once.  As mentioned, some parts can't help make fans smile, kids will love it, and it should introduce the cat to new young fans.",3,A Cute Feline,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2878,"['CGI', 'allowed', 'classic', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'big', 'screen', 'time', 'form', 'fat', 'cat', 'Garfield', 'Even', 'Garfield', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'CGI', 'created', 'armies', 'humans', 'ex-hobit', 'Gollum', 'stampeding', 'dinosaurs', 'Garfield', 'probably', 'best', 'animal', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'compared', 'likes', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Kangaroo', 'Jack', 'etc.', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'seen', 'CGI', 'Odie', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'cartoon', 'strip', 'suppose', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'star', 'real', 'dog', 'grows', 'anyways.As', 'story', 'here', 'film', 'out', 'pictures', 'life', 'Garfield', 'small', 'kitten', 'cat', 'become', 'fan', 'franchise', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'smile', 'panning', 'pictures', 'are', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'Jon', 'Arbuckle', 'Brekin', 'Meyer', 'surprisingly', 'attractive', 'veterinarian', 'Liz', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'just', 'be', 'love', 'Jon', 'life', 'aside', 'Garfield', 'course', 'Here', 'Jon', 'Odie.Odie', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'new', 'home', 'shown', 'ropes', 'treated', 'very', 'well', 'Garfield', 'feel', 'little', 'been', 'left', 'out', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'canine', 'One', 'night', 'Odie', 'lost', 'search', 'rescue', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'out', 'Odie', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'villain', 'Happy', 'Chapman', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'Happy', 'struggling', 'cat', 'food', 'marketer', 'who', 'dog', 'Odie', 'become', 'more', 'famous', 'So', 'Garfield', 'Jon', 'Liz', 'try', 'find', 'Odie', 'chase', 'tricks', 'turns', 'laughs.Garfield', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'way', 'However', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'smile', 'were', 'couple', 'parts', 'had', 'laughing', 'One', 'was', 'dance', 'sequence', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'trailers', 'One', 'reason', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'laughing', 'was', 'rest', 'audience', 'was', 'laughing', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'contagious', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'scenes', 'also', 'cute', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Garfield', 'bed', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Pookie', 'Garfield', 'also', 'one-liners', 'little', 'spots', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'order', 'not', 'ruin', 'them.One', 'thing', 'must', 'praise', 'hiring', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'just', 'something', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'can', 'make', 'person', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'something', 'draws', 'person', 'character', 'even', 'disguised', 'overweight', 'orange', 'cat', 'way', 'can', 'deliver', 'line', 'really', 'Garfield', 'personality', 'Even', 'movie', 'pepped', 'up', 'little', 'normal', 'eat', 'sleep', 'watch', 'tv', 'day.A', 'problem', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'short', '85', 'minutes', 'course', 'ending', 'credits', 'Anyhow', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'mentioned', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'fans', 'smile', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'should', 'introduce', 'cat', 'new', 'young', 'fans']",N/A

I love Garfield, and he's so cute, but the movie doesn't live up to expectations. The trailer doesn't really make you want to see it, and if you read and still own the books, then you'll have very high expectations.The film starts off well - with Garfield sitting up in bed (with Pooky!), and saying his infamous line &quot;I hate Mondays&quot;. Even from then, despite being the fattest cat ever, there's something just not quite right about the whole CGI of Garfield. He looks completely different, although the bug eyes are down pat.Odie isn't the brown floppy eared, bright yellow dog he is in the books - is there even such a dog? He's something like a jack russell, and it totally doesn't work. If they'd made a CGI version of Odie as well, it probably would have worked much better. And as for Nermal & Arlene don't seem quite right - Nermal is the cute little fluffykins s/he is the books, and Arlene comes off OK I suppose.Jon doesn't seem to have much screen time in this, and when he does, it's the unbelieveable romance between him and the 'vet', played by Jennifer Love Hewitt. Bleurgh. In the books, I remember (maybe I need the excuse to re-read the ones I have?) the vet having the bobbed hair, but looking nothing like Jennifer Love Hewitt. And the romance just doesn't do anything for the audience. Jon was a lot more neurotic, super nerd, who couldn't get a date, and not that good looking in the books, whereas Breckin Meyer is alright on the eye, but not trembling knees gorgeous.Garfield in the books didn't move very much, but in this, he dances and shakes his fat booty to the Blackeyed Peas &quot;Hey Mama&quot; - which he does well. Until Odie joins in - you can practically see someone holding a treat above his head, and the moves are very repetitive.Bill Murray is perfect as the voice of Garfield. He has the dry sarcasm and wit of the book Garfield, although the singing voice isn't really up to scratch!Maybe I remember the days of rushing home after school, and watching endless repeats of Garfield on TV - OK, I only vaguely remember it, but they were better than this. If the movie had been similar to that, or more along the lines of Shrek (more CGI for the animals etc), I probably would prefer it.

The only CGI animation in the movie is the character of Garfield, which might sound a little odd but works very well within the context of the film.

Garfield is horrified to find that he is no longer the sole recipient of Jon's affections, and he does everything in his power to mess with Odie and convince Jon to get rid of him. However, a crazy man named Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky) is intent on putting Odie on television to advance his own struggling career. Chapman ends up kidnapping Odie and it's up to Garfield to save the dog that he loathes but has somehow come to miss having around.""Garfield: The Movie"" is a really cute story that stays true to the spirit of Davis' comic.

Jim Davis' beloved feline has since been memorialized in several marketing forms and the comic strip goes on and on.  In spite of the over-exposure, however, Garfield remains a classic comic character.  Transferring him to the big screen and using CGI effects was a risk, and for me, it paid off, simply because it's an entertaining and harmless romp.

It's another attempt from Hollywood to cash in on an old money maker and let anybody script it.I'm with the people who say this movie doesnt do any justice of the Garfield we knew in the comic or cartoon. Pretty much only the names, and Garfields look are recignisable. Much like THUNDERBIRDS & LOST IN SPACE they have just used the names and props and given it a completly different story line to what your used to. Garfield i can let pass, but John is not protrayed well, john was supposed to be a looser who couldnt score with the chicks, but in this movie he is a sucsessfull in love kinda guy. Odie was a dopey slobbering pup who was Garfields bash toy, in the movie Garfield is very jeloous when John brings Odie home, but the dog it self is a real live dog, and does very smart things. Nermal is supposed to be Garfeilds little cute Nefue or something that Garfield can not stand, but the movie shows it as being another normal cat in the neigbourhood, why even bother putting Nermal's name in it then? And Arleine was Garfields girlfriend, least he wanted it to be, but again, it's just another cat in the neigbourhood. There wasnt even a scene on the fence that was always int he comics.The plot was pretty thin and predicatble, and you know what will happen between Garfield and Odie from the begining.The kids will enjoy this movie, they most likely wont know who Garfield is, so they will think it's just a new movie with a cat, which is obviously what Hollywood decided to do when making this film instead of getting a script that does justice to the Garfield that people grew to love int he first place.But seeing as how the kids wont know who he is, and they will like this movie, expect 100 seaqulls from Hollywood to cash in on the franshice that they have now made new for themselves.",2,"Kids will like it, Adults might, originalsfans probably wont",1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1842,"['wasnt', 'impressed', 'movie', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'cash', 'old', 'money', 'maker', 'let', 'anybody', 'script', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'people', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'do', 'justice', 'Garfield', 'knew', 'comic', 'cartoon', 'Pretty', 'much', 'only', 'names', 'Garfields', 'look', 'are', 'recignisable', 'Much', 'THUNDERBIRDS', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'have', 'just', 'used', 'names', 'props', 'given', 'completly', 'different', 'story', 'line', 'what', 'used', 'Garfield', 'i', 'can', 'let', 'pass', 'John', 'not', 'protrayed', 'well', 'john', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'looser', 'who', 'score', 'chicks', 'movie', 'sucsessfull', 'love', 'kinda', 'guy', 'Odie', 'was', 'dopey', 'slobbering', 'pup', 'who', 'was', 'Garfields', 'bash', 'toy', 'movie', 'Garfield', 'very', 'jeloous', 'when', 'John', 'Odie', 'home', 'dog', 'real', 'live', 'dog', 'very', 'smart', 'things', 'Nermal', 'supposed', 'be', 'Garfeilds', 'little', 'cute', 'Nefue', 'something', 'Garfield', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'movie', 'being', 'normal', 'cat', 'neigbourhood', 'why', 'even', 'bother', 'putting', 'Nermal', 'name', 'then', 'Arleine', 'was', 'Garfields', 'girlfriend', 'least', 'wanted', 'be', 'again', 'just', 'cat', 'neigbourhood', 'wasnt', 'even', 'scene', 'fence', 'was', 'always', 'int', 'comics.The', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'thin', 'predicatble', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Garfield', 'Odie', 'begining.The', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'wont', 'know', 'who', 'Garfield', 'will', 'think', 'just', 'new', 'movie', 'cat', 'obviously', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'do', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'instead', 'getting', 'script', 'justice', 'Garfield', 'people', 'grew', 'love', 'int', 'first', 'seeing', 'how', 'kids', 'wont', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'expect', '100', 'seaqulls', 'Hollywood', 'cash', 'franshice', 'have', 'now', 'made', 'new']",N/A

843438,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0002PYSUQ,Monty Moonlight,"[12, 13]","Garfield the cat is a fat, lazy, self-centered, and entirely lovable ball of orange fur. He lives with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, a good-hearted young man who has up to now been unlucky in love, but has a huge crush on Garfield's beautiful vet, Liz. One day, after Jon finds Garfield has eaten himself silly on his favorite dish, lasagna, Jon uses it as an excuse to take him to see Liz. This is a happy turn of events for Liz, who has been looking for someone to unload an unwanted dog on; an adorable little pooch named Odie. Soon, Odie is Jon's favorite pet, while Garfield is finding himself in the doghouse. But when an unscrupulous TV personality from the nearby city spies Odie's dancing skills at a local dog show, the simple minded little pup suddenly turns up missing. With feelings of guilt forced upon him by his neighborhood friends and his own conscience, Garfield decides he must go on a quest to the big city to rescue his new friend. From here on out it's a typical Garfield adventure with all the feel of his wonderful animated series and specials, full of excitement, danger, comedic antics, and fun!In 2001 we lost Lorenzo Music, the true voice of Garfield. Bill Murray (one of the genuinely funniest guys around) fills his shoes in this live-action feature, and he does it well! No, he doesn't sound EXACTLY the same, but there is something very familiar in their voices and deliveries. In fact, Lorenzo voiced Bill Murray's character, Peter Venkman, for the first part of the ""Real Ghostbusters"" animated series' run. Bill has exactly the right dry, sarcastic, and disinterested wit needed for the role of Garfield. One reviewer complained that he sounded bored. PERFECT! In this movie Bill Murray IS Garfield. I usually have complaints about CGI. I still don't think it's as perfected as the industry seems to think it is, but the fact remains, Garfield looks great. He looks real, yet he looks just like Garfield. Bill does him perfectly. His personality is totally intact. I read a review that complained about Garfield going on an adventure to save Odie, saying Garfield would never do something like that because he's too selfish and self-centered. Folks, if you are not a fan of Garfield's animated exploits, perhaps you may feel the way that reviewer did. The comic strip only gives us a few moments in Garfield's life each day, just enough for a simple gag or sarcastic remark. In the animated series and specials we see all the aspects of Garfield's personality. Under all that selfish fur and flab lurks a warm-hearted, loving cat that would do anything for his family (complaining the whole time, I'll grant you). Therefore, if you only love the brief, sarcastic moments of Garfield you read in the comics, perhaps you just won't get it. Fans of Garfield in animation will understand this film much better. After all, Jim Davis had a hand in this too, he didn't just completely turn things over to Hollywood.Many complaints about ""Garfield: The Movie"" are from those who have prejudged this film without seeing it, or from folks who simply don't dig family entertainment. True, Garfield and the other animals move their ""lips"" when they talk, unlike in the cartoons and comics. The fact is, as long as the humans can't hear what they say, it doesn't matter. According to Jim Davis, they chose to do this because it just looks better on screen, and he's right. Movies like ""Homeward Bound,"" that rely on animal telepathy, can still be great films, but there's something a little more comfortable (oddly enough) about films where the animals actually ""speak"" when they speak. It's a very minor complaint, even to this long time Garfield fan. A more worthy complaint is over the fact that Garfield is the only CG character. This is also blown out of proportion. It's not that bad for the most part. CGI effects are far more distracting in movie previews, before you are engrossed in the films that feature them. In fact, the only visual aspect that I found really distracting was the fact that Nermal was a Siamese cat instead of a cute gray kitten. Contrariwise, Arlene looked more like a full grown Nermal. I really felt they should have reversed the cats that played these rolls, and I'm still not sure why Nermal wasn't a kitten. Perhaps these two should have been CG too. But overall it was a visually pleasing Garfield experience, with a perfect Garfield and Odie.But let's not overlook the human characters. Breckin Meyer plays Jon, and one of my personal dreamgirls, Jennifer Love Hewitt, is the veterinarian, Liz. While the actors were nicely cast, their roles were not perfectly written. Jon was still a nice guy and almost on the mark, but he wasn't quite dorky enough. Where was the tacky clothing? Liz was just a little too sweet and into Jon. I guess it wouldn't have made for much of a romance angle, which was cute in the movie, but it would have been more true to the characters if she had been mostly uninterested in Jon. Overall, I'd have to say this is the only SOLID flaw in the film, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. The villain of the story was very ""Garfield the animated series,"" but I often think it would have been nice if he had been portraying Binky the Clown instead of an all new character. But all in all, this is a wonderful, family friendly movie that really keeps the spirit of the fat cat intact and should be enjoyable to all Garfield fans if they don't prejudge or limit themselves to the world of the comics. This DVD edition, however, offers little more to enjoy than the film itself. You are given the option of viewing in full or widescreen, but there are no extra features related to the film. All the disc boasts is a behind the scenes featurette, but it isn't even about Garfield; it's about ""Because of Winn Dixie,"" a dog movie that was not yet in theaters at the time of the DVD release. I highly recommend getting a copy of this fun family film, but you may want to wait for the upcoming ""Purrrfect Collector's Edition.""

The movie is funny; not in a ""haw haw"" way but rather in a ""ahhh, that's cute"" sort of way. It is a great family film. It does not have any of the superfluous silliness or the disgusting toilet humor that so many kids' films have. Nothing to embarrass adults here. It is rather slow at times but just being able to see Garfield in the fur is a treat for any fan.The plot: Jon is the devoted owner of a fat, self-absorbed cat. He often takes his pet to see the vet as much due to his concern for his beloved cat's health as for the cute veterinarian Liz on whom he's had a crush since high school. Impressed by Jon's devotion to Garfield, Liz presents him with a little dog Odie who is in need of a home. Jon takes the dog and smothers him with attention causing his orange cat to turn green with envy; especially when Jon and Liz take off to a dog show with Odie with no intention of taking the cat along. Odie shows an extreme talent for physical acrobatics at the dog show catching the eye of television personality Happy Chapman. Chapman offers Jon a television career for the dog but Jon refuses. That night, the jealous Garfield locks Odie out of the house. Odie runs away where he is soon in the hands of the diabolical Happy Chapman who wishes to use Odie as his television sidekick. Without the time to train him, Chapman plans on using an electric dog collar to shock Odie into various stunts. The guilt-ridden cat, with the help of his mouse friend, leaves his beloved cul de sac in search of his canine pal.Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt were good choices for Jon and Liz, but they have just supporting roles as the star is the computerized cat. As far as showing Garfield's comic strip personality (hating Mondays for whatever reason, loving lasagna, being too lazy to chase a mouse) it is a success. Garfield also encounters other animals from the strip like Nermal, Arlene (although there is no indication she is his girlfriend), and his mouse friend. Garfield is the only computerized animal. All the other animals ""talk"" except for Odie. At first I wished that Odie was computerized too, but the physical comedy of the dog actor is more impressive than any computerized stunts plus the real dog cannot detract from the true star of the film. In the comic strip, Odie was Lymon's dog (Jon's friend with the goofy mustache at the beginning of the series). Most people do not remember that short-lived character so it does not bother me that they changed the origins of Odie in the film. We also get the treat of seeing Garfield smashed against the car window like so many of those stuffed Garfields with suction cups on their paws we've all seen staring out of car windows through the years. As far as extras go, this DVD offers sneak peaks at upcoming films Robots and Because of Winn-Dixie"" A Dog's Tale. It also has the music video ""Holla!"" by Baha Men.

843446,ACGNP00TEIEV3,B0002PYSUQ,Pat Dewees,"[1, 1]","It is interesting that the comic strip ""Garfield"" got its first TV special ""Here Comes Garfield"" in less than five years but it was over 25 years until there was a Garfield movie.  From the start, the producers had to choose how to make the movie; whether to make Garfield a cartoon character in a live action background, use a live cat for Garfield (cats are very hard to train), make the whole movie a cartoon, etc.  There has been debate over which would have been best, but the computer generated Garfield works fine.The story is one in which Garfield loves to bully Odie but nonetheless comes comes to his rescue when the pup becomes lost and captured.  This plot is hardly original.  Indeed it is similar to that of ""Here Comes Garfield.""  Here are some other problems I had with the movie.It is not true enough to the comic strip.  In the strip, Jon does not get Odie from Liz.  Jon acquired Odie when he took Lyman, an old friend, into his home.  Odie belongs to Lyman who after the first two years of the comic strip mysteriously stops appearing in the strip.  I guess Lyman had served his purpose of introducing Odie.  In the comic strip, Garfield does not talk as he does in this movie.  Even in animated cartoons, such as the aforementioned TV special and the animated TV series that came later, Garfield does not speak.  Instead his thoughts are heard.Jennifer Love Hewitt is a trendy choice to play Liz, Garfield vet, but perhaps not the best.I would have liked for them to have used the same voice for Garfield as in the animated series ""Garfield and Friends.""  But I did a little research and found that it wasn't their fault.  Sadly, Lorenzo Music, who supplied that voice, has died.  Bill Murray is adequately convincing as the voice of Garfield.In spite of the negative comments, I watched with interest because it is mildly humorous and I kept wanting to know what would happen next.",3,Enjoyable but not faithful to the comic strip,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,1903,"['interesting', 'comic', 'strip', 'Garfield', 'got', 'first', 'TV', 'special', 'Here', 'Garfield', 'less', 'five', 'years', 'was', '25', 'years', 'was', 'Garfield', 'movie', 'start', 'producers', 'had', 'choose', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'make', 'Garfield', 'cartoon', 'character', 'live', 'action', 'background', 'use', 'live', 'cat', 'Garfield', 'cats', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'train', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'etc', 'been', 'debate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'computer', 'generated', 'Garfield', 'fine.The', 'story', 'one', 'Garfield', 'bully', 'Odie', 'nonetheless', 'rescue', 'when', 'pup', 'lost', 'captured', 'plot', 'hardly', 'original', 'Indeed', 'similar', 'Here', 'Comes', 'Garfield', 'Here', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'had', 'movie.It', 'not', 'true', 'enough', 'comic', 'strip', 'strip', 'Jon', 'not', 'get', 'Odie', 'Liz', 'Jon', 'acquired', 'Odie', 'when', 'took', 'Lyman', 'old', 'friend', 'home', 'Odie', 'Lyman', 'who', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'comic', 'strip', 'mysteriously', 'appearing', 'strip', 'guess', 'Lyman', 'had', 'served', 'purpose', 'introducing', 'Odie', 'comic', 'strip', 'Garfield', 'not', 'talk', 'movie', 'Even', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'such', 'aforementioned', 'TV', 'special', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'later', 'Garfield', 'not', 'speak', 'Instead', 'thoughts', 'are', 'heard.Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'trendy', 'choice', 'play', 'Liz', 'Garfield', 'vet', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'used', 'same', 'voice', 'Garfield', 'animated', 'series', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Sadly', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'who', 'supplied', 'voice', 'died', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'adequately', 'convincing', 'voice', 'Garfield.In', 'spite', 'negative', 'comments', 'watched', 'interest', 'mildly', 'humorous', 'kept', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next']",N/A

I think kids would like it, although I don't know if you can really appreciate the movie unless you are familiar with the comic. The basic premise is that Garfield lives with Jon and he is a fat lazy cat, no surprise. Jon has been taking Garfield to the vat a lot so he can flirt with the veterinarian, Liz (played by the ALWAYS gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt). Liz needs to find a home to a less than intelligent dog, Odie. Garfield gets very jealous of Odie and eventually locks Odie out. Well, Odie runs away and Garfield feels bad. Liz & John (who of course are developing a relationship) go out searching for the two animals. All the while, Garfield knows who has kidnapped Odie (a deranged pet performer who saw Odie dance at a dog show) is chasing after Odie. The chase ends up at the train station and a cat at the controls. Good, clean fun.Overall, as I said, a good flick. I don't know that I would buy it or see it again, but I was glad to rent it. The chase story reminded me a lot of Toy Story 2, but that is okay. If you liked the comic, I think you will like the movie.

After watching the movie, I can say that even though it wasn't the best movie that I saw, it certainly isn't that bad as people claim it to be.The story is about Garfield, the lovable cat, enjoying his life as usual, with his food and TV (and Jon to an extent). Jon (Breckin Meyer) has a crush on Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield's veterinarian, who asks him to take Odie the dog and watch over him. Garfield feels threatened by Odie, as Odie is loved by everyone and seems to be invading Garfield's space, so Garfield decides to get rid of him. But once gone, Garfield feels guilty and goes on a mission to save his friend.The credit firstly should go to the special effects people who created the 3d version of Garfield. I think they did a terrific job in making Garfield look as realistic as possible. Furthermore, people ridiculing the cast such as Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt should stop and consider the fact that these people had to portray emotions to a cat and a dog that actually didn't exist, and were created digitally. It's not easy acting out a role against an imaginary cat on set, and I think the cast did an excellent job on it! Sure, it's not an Oscar performance, but it should certainly not be mocked at. I think Bill Murray did a good job on providing the voice for Garfield. What does everyone expect? Garfield is supposed to sound bored and sarcastic, not yodel for everyone, and I think Bill Murray did a good job on that. The rest of the cast acted sufficiently.Probably the only disappointment that I had in this movie was the dancing showdown between Garfield and Odie, which became a little annoying after a few seconds.

843462,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0002PYSUQ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 6]","Bill Murray stars in the world's first ""shaggy cat"" movie.  The plot of ""Garfield"" isn't as much a bunch of old ""Garfield"" strips stitched together as a single strip stretched to about 90 minutes.  In the story, Garfield and Jon live an idyllic existence in a small house in a sunny suburban cul-de-sac of somewhere-in-America (a huge metropolis looms at the edge of the cul-de-sac, sort of like ""The Emerald City"").  We don't know what Jon does but it doesn't require that he ever have to leave home.  Flamboyantly pathetic in the cartoon, Jon here is just a soft-spoken wimp, pining for Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a girl Jon's yearned for for years, and is now Garfield's vet.  When Liz foists Odie, a stray dog, on Jon, he accepts, and now Garfield has some competition at home.  At first ""Garfield"" follows ""Toy Story"" - with Garfield as a meaner version of Woody battling the new pet for his owner's devotion.  Though Odie hasn't any lines (he's one of the few animals who doesn't speak at all) he soon proves he's no push-over.  Unfortunately, in stealing Garfield's fire, Odie attracts the unwanted attentions of an amoral pet-show host (Stephen Tobolowsky - also playing his more successful brother), and it's Garfield to the rescue.""Garfield"" is light fun for the kids.  It doesn't have any of that subversive, frightening or just plain crude fun that marked ""Cat in the Hat"", and yet it's breathlessly edited so that it never slows down for those adults who have to sit through it with them.  Bill Murray, playing the voice of Garfield, has fun with the role - adding his lounge-singer routine from SNL to the original voice as done by Lorenzo Music and updating it for the 21st century.

Considering how difficult it likely was to bring this strip to the big screen, I guess it's ok as it is. But I noted some strip-to-screen inconsistencies. Like for instance, the fact that Nermal should be a kitten sized cat, that Jon (John?) isn't supposed to be decent looking (he'd have more normal dates in the strip wouldn't he?), and Liz the vet doesn't want to date Jon, yet in the movie, tsk, she does.

Garfield, that egoistic, fat, lazy cat which is created with the magical CGI techniques.  I say 'magical,' and that's not exaggeration because among the flood of the numerous CGI tricks in Hollywood, the images of this cat are impeccable, seamlessly fit into the surrounding scenery.Forget the story, for it's just another poor excuse for the producers to make a feature film (and that barely exceeds 80 minutes).  Garfield, the fat lazy cat, is happy with his lazy life with his master Jon (Breckin Meyer, 'Road Trip').  But Jon decides to keep a dog, the emeny for all the cats, just to impress Liz (Jeniffer Love Hewitt), a beautiful vet at the animal hosptal.  Now, Garfield does not like it.  He hates the dog, he hates the new life.After this rather contrived premise, some adventures for the cat follow.  The cast include Stephen Tobolowsky as a TV host of animal show who tries to use Jon's dog for his promotion, and voices by Alan Cumming and Nick Cannon.  You can easily recognize them.But the most wonderful things of the film all belong to the creation and personality of Garfield, voiced by perfectly cast Bill Murrey.  His casting is the main reason for the success in establishing the credible, lovable character of Garfield, whose weary, cynical voices hide warm humanity.  And the Garfield's images are so real, without losing the comic touch of its origin. It's worth Oscar.Director Peter Hewitt may be best known for 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey' but in this film you just can't expect originality in the story.  The occasional wacky humor and slapstick gags are amusing, but all remain in the safe territory.In short, the only reason I can recommend 'Garfield: The Movie' is its title role: Garfield, and its personality.

The story is generic and not very inventive. Bill Murray voices the feline bore effectively, but not even his presence doesn't help the film overall. One of the decision lapses of the film is that the creators use a CGI Garfield cat acting against live action cats and his nemesis Odie  (the dog) and it doesn't work. One cannot suspend disbelief because its as if there is a dimensional riff and two worlds are colliding. Also, on a technical standpoint, the CGI is not seamless.  There is a scene where Garfield is at an animal control shelter and one of the handlers takes out Garfield from a cage. It looks clunky and and unrealistic. Overall, a generally flat film based on a comic strip that all ready makes too much money from merchandising etc. (i.e. Remember those enoying GARFIELD stuffed dolls holding on to automobile windows with suction cups on the limbs).
