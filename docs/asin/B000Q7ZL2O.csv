We couldn't get over the quality animation and the funny and interesting storyline and dialogue of this Discovery Channel Kids production.  My grandsons came over  and after watching it just begged to borrow it.  So I got on good old Amazon and found the rest of the series.  I purchased (from Amazon, of course)  the three set for my 9 year old grandson's birthday.  I'm 62 years old and I love to watch them!  Also, the Discovery Channel gives you a real lesson in ancient Egypt as a bonus with every DVD in the series so it is educational!  Then there is a fun QUIZ with little sassy Tutenstein to play along with Cleo.  The character Tutenstein is a cute little monster of a Pharaoh who,  if he doesn't get his way, deems it a &#34;blasphemy&#34; against his exalted person!  Consequently,  it gets himself and Cleo into all kinds of hilarious trouble.  You won't regret buying this one.",5,TUTENSTEIN ROCKS EGYPTIAN STYLE!,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,991,"['found', 'first', 'series', '1.50', 'drugstore', 'bargain', 'bin', 'took', 'home', 'son', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'quality', 'animation', 'funny', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Kids', 'production', 'grandsons', 'came', 'watching', 'just', 'begged', 'borrow', 'So', 'got', 'good', 'old', 'Amazon', 'found', 'rest', 'series', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'course', 'three', 'set', '9', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'birthday', ""'m"", '62', 'years', 'old', 'love', 'watch', 'Also', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'real', 'lesson', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'series', 'educational', 'Then', 'fun', 'QUIZ', 'little', 'sassy', 'Tutenstein', 'play', 'along', 'Cleo', 'character', 'Tutenstein', 'cute', 'little', 'monster', 'Pharaoh', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', '34', 'blasphemy', '34', 'exalted', 'person', 'Consequently', 'Cleo', 'kinds', 'hilarious', 'trouble', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'one']",Tutenstein: The Fearless Pharaoh Vol. 3
