I think there were only 3 times that I did not get exactly what was said though, it wasn't a struggle through the whole series.  Gillian Anderson was great but I think overacted the part a bit.

1527627,A5BX6WP8XMC59,B0077PBPGO,"Bibliophile One ""Alicia""","[0, 0]","I am a huge Dickens fan and teach this book to my 8th graders every year.  I am also a big fan of BBC and period drama.  David Suchet is one of my all-time favorite actors. Therefore, I had great expectations for a new film version, but this one is not it.  My teenage sons, who are also big BBC and period drama fans and have happily watched many other Dickens and Austen mini-series, made me turn this one off after about twenty minutes because it was so awful.  I struggled through it to the end on my own and wish I hadn't wasted the time. The casting is frequently unconvincing: Mrs. Joe is stout rather than bony and angular, Orlick looks like a zombie, Wopsle is not in the film, Mr. and Mrs. Pocket are not in the film, Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham is haunting but far too fragile and child-like, David Suchet's role as Jaggers is minimized, we don't get to see Wemmick's castle or the Aged Parent ... I could go on and on).  The film capitalizes on the idea of Miss Havisham's decay as a living death by making everyone looked like they've stepped out of a zombie or vampire flick.  While this is creative in some ways, it just doesn't feel like a faithful Dickens film.  Several plot elements have been altered as well.  A backstory has been added about Miss Havisham's brother hunting down beautiful butterflies and sticking a pin through the heart of beauty (she displays his huge collection to Pip early in the first episode).  When Pip first meets Herbert at Satis House, Herbert behaves as a status-proud prig and fights Pip out of pride -- this is a far cry from the delightfully quirky and gentlemanly bout that earns Pip's admiration in the novel.  Harry Lloyd as the grown-up Herbert is delightful, but he says he was disinherited because of his engagement to Clara (who was actually a secret from his parents in the novel), and his marriage occurs much earlier in the film than in the book.  I particularly disliked the oversimplification of the characters' complex and competing motives.  While the novel leaves the reader in doubt as to whether Magwitch somehow deliberately killed Compeyson in the boat/ship collision, this film has Magwitch brutally stab Compeyson (with lots of blood spurting from Compeyson's mouth) -- this difference is important to Pip's overall evaluation of Magwitch, and to the reader's.  Overall, Ray Winstone is excellent as Magwitch -- his was the most convincing performance in this film.  The scenes between Magwitch and Pip near the end are moving, but they are not enough to justify struggling through an otherwise disappointing adaptation.  This was not up to the standards I expect from Masterpiece Classics or from period drama.  If you want a mostly accurate and delightful version, the David Lean (1946) film is still the best.",1,"If you know and love the book, don't waste your time with this film.",1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,2791,"['am', 'huge', 'Dickens', 'fan', 'teach', 'book', '8th', 'graders', 'year', 'am', 'also', 'big', 'fan', 'BBC', 'period', 'drama', 'David', 'Suchet', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Therefore', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'new', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'not', 'My', 'teenage', 'sons', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'BBC', 'period', 'drama', 'fans', 'have', 'happily', 'watched', 'many', 'other', 'Dickens', 'Austen', 'mini-series', 'made', 'turn', 'one', 'off', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'struggled', 'end', 'own', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'time', 'casting', 'frequently', 'unconvincing', 'Mrs.', 'Joe', 'rather', 'bony', 'angular', 'Orlick', 'zombie', 'Wopsle', 'not', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Pocket', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'haunting', 'far', 'too', 'fragile', 'child-like', 'David', 'Suchet', 'role', 'Jaggers', 'minimized', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Wemmick', 'castle', 'Aged', 'Parent', 'could', 'go', 'film', 'idea', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'decay', 'living', 'death', 'making', 'everyone', 'looked', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'zombie', 'vampire', 'flick', 'creative', 'ways', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'faithful', 'Dickens', 'film', 'Several', 'plot', 'elements', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'well', 'backstory', 'been', 'added', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'brother', 'hunting', 'down', 'beautiful', 'butterflies', 'sticking', 'pin', 'heart', 'beauty', 'huge', 'collection', 'Pip', 'early', 'first', 'episode', 'When', 'Pip', 'first', 'Herbert', 'Satis', 'House', 'Herbert', 'status-proud', 'prig', 'fights', 'Pip', 'pride', 'far', 'cry', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'gentlemanly', 'Pip', 'admiration', 'novel', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'grown-up', 'Herbert', 'delightful', 'was', 'disinherited', 'engagement', 'Clara', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'secret', 'parents', 'novel', 'marriage', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'book', 'particularly', 'disliked', 'oversimplification', 'characters', 'complex', 'competing', 'motives', 'novel', 'reader', 'doubt', 'Magwitch', 'somehow', 'deliberately', 'killed', 'Compeyson', 'boat/ship', 'collision', 'film', 'Magwitch', 'brutally', 'stab', 'Compeyson', 'lots', 'blood', 'spurting', 'Compeyson', 'mouth', 'difference', 'important', 'Pip', 'overall', 'evaluation', 'Magwitch', 'reader', 'Overall', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'excellent', 'Magwitch', 'was', 'most', 'convincing', 'performance', 'film', 'scenes', 'Magwitch', 'Pip', 'end', 'are', 'moving', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'struggling', 'otherwise', 'disappointing', 'adaptation', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'standards', 'expect', 'Masterpiece', 'Classics', 'period', 'drama', 'want', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'delightful', 'version', 'David', 'Lean', '1946', 'film', 'still', 'best']",N/A

1527634,AB34G6VKP28L,B0077PBPGO,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[71, 82]","Some books are just purely cinematic. Great Expectations is one of them, with all the elements of a perfect gothic story: the mad woman, the creepy old house full of cobwebs and bitter memories, the stretch of the forge and the sinister man who arises from the mud to slam the young hero to the ground and threaten his life. This recent adaptation by the BBC is a visual masterpiece, full of understated and wonderful performances, as atmospheric a tale as Charles Dickens could have imagined.The solitary Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) has not been seen by any of the locals in many years, not since she was jilted on her wedding day. Now shut up in her great old house, which still bears the ghosts of wounded memories in the form of a moth-eaten wedding gown and rat-infested marriage cake, she decides to enlist the assistance of a forge boy, young Pip (Oscar Kennedy), in entertaining her ward, Estella (Izzy Meikle-Small). Hoping to raise the girl to avenge the sins of her former lover, her innocent appeal causes Pip's family, which includes his unhappy sister, her good-natured husband, and their greedy uncle, to think that perhaps they might rise in society as a result of it. Miss Havisham encourages Pip to be ambitious and hints that he may have great expectations for the future, only to turn around and deprive him of the one thing he wants most, condemning him to the life of a bond servant learning the trade as a blacksmith.But that is not the end of Pip's journey, nor his relationship with Miss Havisham... for seven years later, Pip (Douglas Booth) is informed by a London solicitor (David Suchet) that he has inherited a great sum of money. It requires abandoning his current life and becoming a gentleman in society... a plan that will reintroduce him to Estella (Vanessa Kirby) once more.I have enjoyed this adaptation. It is different from the source material in some respects (and that certainly will give book enthusiasts reason to complain) but it avoids the over theatricality of the roles and instead chooses a far more natural approach. Gillian Anderson chooses to play Miss Havisham both as a woman fully aware of what she is doing and as such, dedicated to evil (though she may not truly know it) and as a vulnerable child in a mature body, forever stuck in one place with no hope of moving forward. The acting here is really remarkable from everyone involved, but particularly so from the young lead. His Pip is all at once a lovely child and one we feel deeply for, yet we are similarly fascinated with Estella and her grim companion.While certain elements are dramatically different from the book (in order to create a more modern ending) and the second episode stumbles a bit in maintaining the pace of its other parts, this is an enjoyable adaptation that avoids some of the sins of its predecessors while also offering romantics an ending that will make them happy. It is not perfect but it is quite good, and well worth the three hours required to discover its mysteries.",5,A Haunting Miss Havisham,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3014,"['books', 'are', 'just', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'one', 'elements', 'perfect', 'gothic', 'story', 'mad', 'woman', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'full', 'cobwebs', 'bitter', 'memories', 'stretch', 'forge', 'sinister', 'man', 'who', 'mud', 'slam', 'young', 'hero', 'ground', 'threaten', 'life', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'BBC', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'full', 'understated', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'atmospheric', 'tale', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'could', 'have', 'imagined.The', 'solitary', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'locals', 'many', 'years', 'not', 'was', 'jilted', 'wedding', 'day', 'Now', 'shut', 'up', 'great', 'old', 'house', 'still', 'ghosts', 'wounded', 'memories', 'form', 'moth-eaten', 'wedding', 'gown', 'rat-infested', 'marriage', 'cake', 'enlist', 'assistance', 'forge', 'boy', 'young', 'Pip', 'Oscar', 'Kennedy', 'entertaining', 'ward', 'Estella', 'Izzy', 'Meikle-Small', 'Hoping', 'raise', 'girl', 'avenge', 'sins', 'former', 'lover', 'innocent', 'appeal', 'Pip', 'family', 'unhappy', 'sister', 'good-natured', 'husband', 'greedy', 'uncle', 'think', 'perhaps', 'might', 'rise', 'society', 'result', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'Pip', 'be', 'ambitious', 'hints', 'may', 'have', 'great', 'expectations', 'future', 'only', 'turn', 'around', 'deprive', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'condemning', 'life', 'bond', 'servant', 'learning', 'trade', 'blacksmith.But', 'not', 'end', 'Pip', 'journey', 'relationship', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'Pip', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'informed', 'London', 'solicitor', 'David', 'Suchet', 'inherited', 'great', 'sum', 'money', 'abandoning', 'current', 'life', 'becoming', 'gentleman', 'society', 'plan', 'will', 'reintroduce', 'Estella', 'Vanessa', 'Kirby', 'once', 'more.I', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'adaptation', 'different', 'source', 'material', 'respects', 'certainly', 'will', 'give', 'book', 'enthusiasts', 'reason', 'complain', 'theatricality', 'roles', 'instead', 'far', 'more', 'natural', 'approach', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'play', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'woman', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'doing', 'such', 'dedicated', 'evil', 'may', 'not', 'truly', 'know', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'mature', 'body', 'forever', 'stuck', 'one', 'place', 'hope', 'moving', 'forward', 'acting', 'here', 'really', 'remarkable', 'everyone', 'involved', 'particularly', 'so', 'young', 'lead', 'Pip', 'once', 'lovely', 'child', 'one', 'feel', 'deeply', 'are', 'similarly', 'fascinated', 'Estella', 'grim', 'companion.While', 'certain', 'elements', 'are', 'dramatically', 'different', 'book', 'order', 'create', 'more', 'modern', 'ending', 'second', 'episode', 'bit', 'maintaining', 'pace', 'other', 'parts', 'enjoyable', 'adaptation', 'sins', 'predecessors', 'also', 'offering', 'romantics', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'happy', 'not', 'perfect', 'quite', 'good', 'well', 'three', 'hours', 'required', 'discover', 'mysteries']",N/A

Having said that, this first episode introduces us to a spooky, otherworldly atmosphere for the great Dickens novel. Sarah Phelps has adapted Dickens for this triptych presentation and the piece is directed with style and great attention to atmospheric detail by Brian Kirk.The orphan Pip (Oscar Kennedy) works for blacksmith Joe Gargery (Shaun Dooley) and his Dickinsonian shrew of a wife Mrs. Joe (Clair Rushbrook) whose relative Pumblechook (Mark Addy) has designs on the future.  Working with Pip is the evil Dolge Orlick (Jack Roth).  Pip is wandering the foggy flatlands, comes across escaped criminal Abel Magwitch (Ray Winstone) and befriends him  - an act that obviously bodes well for Pip's future.  Mr and Mrs Joe receive notice from a Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) that she wishes to have Pip, and the Gargery family sees a way out of the drudgery in which they live. Pip is off to Miss Havisham's cobwebbed home where she remains secluded from the world since her jilted wedding day.  She `adopts' Estella (Izzy Meikle-Small) and seeks a playmate for her  - her reason for bringing Pip into the strange home.  Bad derring-does happen - Mrs. Joe is practically killed by Orlick, some strange vibrations occur in the Havisham household, etc.  Seven years pass and solicitor Jaggers (David Suchet) visits the home and informs the household that Pip has inherited a great sum of money form an unknown benefactor and wants Pip (now the strikingly handsome Douglas Booth) to go to London to become a  gentleman with great expectations, following in the steps of Estella (now Vanessa Kirby).  And that is where we leave the group at the end of episode 1.In this amount of time the moods of the flatlands and the poverty of the poor class have been beautifully drawn as has the bizarre home and disheveled mind of Miss Havisham. The seeds for the rest of the story have been sown and it is with great interest that the following two episodes will carry this version.  It is recommended to use subtitles with this series as the various dialects are tough to translate for the American ear.  But Dickens this is and a fine beginning.  Highly recommended viewing.

1527657,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B0077PBPGO,janebbooks,"[1, 3]","Approximately twenty adaptations for film and the theater have been made of Charles Dickens' fictional novel GREAT EXPECTATIONS. I have not read the novel, but I have seen the 1998 film with screenplay by Mitch Glazer that is set on Florida's Gulf Coast and in the 1980's SoHo art world several times. And I watched this 2012 PBS period drama with its more traditional British setting just recently. Both productions follow the general plot of the novel. Although many characters have been omitted in both versions-more in the film, the story remains as a timeless tale, a love story between a young man of modest circumstance who falls for a rich and coldhearted girl. Both versions have a crumbling large house, an eccentric jilted bride...an inspiring success story, and an improbable warm-hearted convict...At its core, the plot of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is fairly simple. While roaming the countryside, Pip, an orphan of about seven who lives with his abusive sister and her husband, encounters an escaped convict who scares him into stealing food for him and a file to grind away his shackles. The next day the convict is captured. A neighbor, Miss Havisham, a wealthy spinster jilted at the altar, asks Pip's uncle to find a boy to play with her adopted daughter Estella. Pip begins to visit Miss Havisham and Estella, with whom he falls in love. Some years later, Pip, as a young apprentice in his uncle's business, is approached by a lawyer who tells him he is to receive a large sum of money from an anonymous benefactor. Pip believes Miss Havisham to be his benefactress and visits her and Estella, who has returned from studying on the Continent. Then he leaves for the big city to spend his inheritance and lead a grand lifestyle. While in the big city, Pip meets his benefactor and encounters his true love Estella married to another man.Dickens wrote two endings for his story. Both these adaptations have the happier second ending.As a timeless love story, I liked the modern version, the 1998 film, better...the actors especially and isn't that the crux...great performance? Since I didn't read the book, I didn't miss the characters that were not in either adaptation.  Here's some comparison of character and setting:MISS HAVISHAM: Everything I've read says that Miss H. had been jilted at the altar several years before the time of the story. So Gillian Anderson is not too young for the role...although I didn't care for her fey, weird and often spooky rendition.  Anne Bancroft plays Miss H. as eccentric, slightly mad, yet she danced amid the ruins of her palazzo in beautiful flowing costumes. Bancroft was the wondrous age of 67 when she played Miss H. and is absolutely stunning in her madness.PIP AND ESTELLA: Ethan Hawke is handsome and really shines as Pip in the film - he's highly underrated as an actor. Pip in the traditional production is too much of a pretty boy. But the British actress is a better Estella than Gwyneth Paltrow...an all American girl, lovely to look at...but hard to imagine coldhearted (There's something inherently cold in a trained British accent).UNCLE JOE: Chris Cooper had won no acting awards when he portrayed Uncle Joe in the 1998 film...but he gives a stellar performance. And his character is a widower...Pip's sister was a grim, bitter woman, and the film did not suffer for lack of her appearance.THE CONVICT: Both Ray Winstone and Robert deNiro were very good in this role. The PBS production did drag a bit with too much of his escape and capture... Having an actor of deNiro's reputation play a cameo role in the film was a pleasant surprise.THE LAWYER: David Suchet gave another great PBS performance...he has such a magnificent voice. The lawyer in the film had an understated role with few scenes so the whole bit about Estella's parentage was lost in the updated version.SETTING: The 1998 film shows Miss Havisham's crumbling, but light and airy, mansion as a vast Italian palazzo in coastal marshes with a symbolic water fountain. Satis House in the novel is a massive place...and its construction as a dark, old house in the PBS production was fascinating. (Read about it at the PBS website.)Have I made a case for the updated version - the 1998 film ofGreat Expectations?Comments welcome...Jane",3,Great adaptations?

1527663,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B0077PBPGO,lily t.,"[1, 1]","Interesting, artistic, too rushed with an uneven cast yet even in this compressed version the story is enthralling and I was riveted.When young orphan Pip helps an escaped convict in the fens, his destiny will be forever altered, and he will be raised from apprentice blacksmith to gentleman only to realize that his great expectations have fallen short of delivering the happiness, warmth, love and joy he thought his due when he embarked on 'bettering' himself. His illusion is furthered by his adoration of the girl Estella, the adopted daughter of a brewery heiress, Miss Havisham, who jilted on her wedding day, plans revenge on the male gender by raising Estella to break hearts. Estella embodies everything in the fine world Pip aspires to and yet is tainted and twisted through no fault of her own. How Dickens pulled together the threads of this story through an amazing series of coincidences is quite interesting.As many have pointed out, the child Pip was excellent, adult Pip, far too pretty and Estella suffers by comparison. Sometimes I felt as if I was watching Adonis pay court to a catatonic Minnie Driver! Ray Winstone was a great choice for Magwitch and the child actor who played young Pip was superb. But the show belonged to a bewitching Gillian Anderson as the iconic Miss Havisham.Anderson has given some fascinating performances--as the chilly Madam in The Crimson Petal, Lily Bart in House of Mirth, Lady Dedlock in Bleak House, The Duchess of Windsor is Any Human Heart  and here she is a marvel --humanizing and making explicable  Miss Havisham's deeds and motivation. She is at once mentally deranged, vulnerable, childlike, punitive and self punishing--and makes the viewer suspect she was unbalanced even before she was jilted- which put her over the edge. The casting of a beautiful younger woman in the role was brilliant, after all Compeyson was not an old man, so why do we all assume white haired Miss Havisham was necessarily old [though both she and her house grow more decrepit and wasted as time went by].The first part with young Pip was very good, the second fairly good, the third far too rushed. It's been decades since I read the book, so I can't account for the dialogue, though in a version this short I would imagine it was cut considerably--but still the series hits all the salient points of the story.

1527678,AMX4202M7D7HV,B0077PBPGO,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[69, 87]","As an ardent fan of Charles Dickens, I am always open to any film adaptation in this day and age of his work, and have to admit that I was quite excited for this new 2011 production of ""Great Expectations"". While not my favorite of his novels, it nonetheless has a plethora of possibilties when dramatized for the screen, be it big or small. Nonethless, after viewing, I couldn't help but feel a trifle let down.I've watched several BBC/Masterpiece productions and found them all to be enjoyable, but this one was a chore to watch, even in installments. It wasn't just the rushed pacing, the artsy, color-drained cinematography that feels more appropriate for a horror movie than Dickens, the brutal watering down of his brilliant prose into bland, almost inanely simplified dialogue, or the dropping of important chunks of the novel in favor of inserting newly-imagined scenarios that add nothing but smuttiness to the story (i.e., the inappropriate and unnecessary brothel scene, or the completely travestuous ""lake"" moment between Pip and Estella) that made me give this film one star; it was the fact that it just felt too modern to be a really good adaptation of Dickens, and that the very spirit of the book was conspicuously absent throughout the entire three hours.While it's something very hard to explain, it simply never struck me as feeling ""authentic"", either in a historial sense or a dramatic one. Everything felt forced, like the filmmakers didn't really believe in what they were creating, and the actors just wanted to get through their lines as quickly and painlessly as they could. Honestly, I might never have known this was supposed to be ""Great Expectations"" aside from the occasional appearance of Miss Havisham. Sure, the sets look authentic and the costumes are beautiful, but the script feels like a soap-opera styled parody of the book, with acting to match. Douglas Booth, who plays Pip, along with Vanessa Kirby as Estella, never seem to really grasp that they are supposed to be living in the 19th century instead of modern-day, and give stilted, unoriginal performances. I did mildly enjoy Gillian Anderson as the quite mad and ethereal Miss Havisham, though I think Helena Bonham-Carter can do better.One thing that Charles Dickens' books are well known for is their wittiness and whimsical humour. Even his darkest tales have pepperings of light scattered throughout to lift the mood and create a style uniquely his own. This film has left those credos by the wayside and opted for a far more bleak, shadowy, and humourless rendition, with nothing left but dull and depressing scenes of boring, colorless characters with nothing even remotely interesting to do or say. Character development doesn't happen as often as it should, and in consequence leaves you with little emotional connection to the characters themselves by the end of the film. Pip and Estella's complicated relationship is reduced to a cliched collection of invented scenes, and that between Joe Gargery and Pip, both as a youngster and as an adult, is almost nonexistent.As I mentioned before, the biggest con for me was the fact that the dialogue has been so oversimplified that you might not know if it was Dickens or not. With other BBC productions, at least of few quotes come verbatim from the pages of the book, helping to bring the world of Victorian England to life, but not so here. The glorious, fanciful language of the time is diminished so heavily that it might just as well been written yesterday instead of in 1860. Without his words, Dickens just isn't Dickens; but apparently Sarah Phelps, the screenwriter, didn't quite comprehend that.A bit too artsy and modern for my own taste, I was disappointed in the BBC for allowing this to be their Charles Dickens bicentennial production, knowing that they can do and have done much better than this in the past.

Douglas Booth does a nice if slightly one-dimensional Pip, but is overall likeable, and let's admit it, not too bad on the eye:) I know Gillian Anderson's casting was somewhat debated because she is still quite young, but I felt she played the role well.  I know Estella is not supposed to be the most likeable or lively person, but I found her extremely bland and there was zero chemistry between her and Pip, which made this intense love he apparently felt for her hard to believe.

After watching the first installment on Masterpiece, I said there's something missing here. Before the second installment, I decided to review an earlier production from the BBC from 2004. It had been many years since I read Great Expectations, and that production had left me wondering, how good was it?  After watching it again, I realized how good it was. For me, there is no comparison between the 2012 and the 2004. The Rampling/Waddell production is all Dickens, filled with turns and twists that naturally flow out of the story, nothing forced, nothing artificial. The acting is wonderful, the sets wonderful. All the elements are there for a great story.  Most of all, there are the wonderful Dickens characters, complex and human, people you care about for good or bad. It is richly Dickens, in only the way he can tell.As for the other, it is flat, stale, cliched, and forced. I found the characters two dimensional and undeveloped with no depth or complexity, rather the production of a hurried Hollywood screenwriter on a timetable. No amount of good acting brings this story to life. Exploitive, rather, it seems.

All the versions of this movie that I've seen portray the character as being very elderly and bent over.  Like another reviewer remarked, it would be understandable for her to be in her 40s when she first meets Pip.  I just liked the almost ethereal way she looked--the white makeup, white, disheveled hair, and the wedding dress that becomes shabbier and dirtier each time she makes an appearance and her seemingly innocent, ""deer in the headlights"" look mixed with absolute bitterness and hatred of all things masculine.  The other actor that played his role with all the gusto of a ""bad guy"" was Drummle, the lecherous, abusive man who becomes Estella's husband.  I'm not sure about Pip's character.  I liked the younger version better than the adult version.  Douglas Booth just seemed a little too pretty for that role and didn't really give it much depth.

Because such accolades came from people whose opinions I may not always agree with but do trust I was really excited to get my hands on this. I had seen two versions prior to this and although I much preferred the newer Masterpiece adaptation of the two, neither one gripped me in the way that so many Dickens productions have. That is primarily the reason I was so anxious to get my hands on this version.Young Pip only has one protector. Orphaned, the boy lives with his stern sister but her kind-hearted blacksmith husband, Joe (Shaun Dooley) has always been Pip's hero. Following an odd encounter with an escaped convict named Magwitch (Ray Winstone) on a cold Christmas day, Pip's whole world is about to change. Everything he thought he wanted is now nothing but a past. The recluse and mysterious Miss Havisham wishes for a young boy to come once a week as a kind of playmate to her young impetuous adopted daughter. The locals are still intrigued by the wealthy matron whose past has caused her to lock herself away in a dilapidated old estate. Choosing to go, Pip is swept into the strange woman's world. Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) is a woman still used to getting what she wants - her home is shrouded in more than dust and shadows as she walks around bare-footed in a ratty old wedding gown. It is young Estella that Pip quickly loses his young heart to. The teenage beauty is nearly as cold as her mother but the nave Pip is drawn into their world to the point of wanting to live it. Assuming Miss Havisham wants to settle money on Pip, his sister couldn't be more thrilled but much to Pip's disappoint after weeks that turned into months of weekly visits, instead the woman pays for his apprenticeship to train in the trade of balcksmith effectively putting an end to his visits with Estella.Years pass and Pip (Douglas Booth) grows into a fine-looking man with little potential to become a gentleman. Out of nowhere, a well-known London attorney named Jaggers (David Suchet) informs Pip that a mysterious benefactor has settled a large fortune on him. There are stipulations: Including never inquiring who his benefactor is until he reaches his majority but Pip immediately assumes it is Miss Havisham. Being a man now with prospects, Pip leaves for London but is still ensnared in her web - he is pulled back to the house and into the dark secrets surrounding it when Estella (Vanessa Kirby) returns from finishing school in Paris needing an escort... leading Pip to again pine for Estella.It is hard to know where to begin in a production such as this. The opening frame - and beyond of this mini-series is pure brilliance. It puts every single one of our senses alert. The filming and set creates a dangerous, mysterious scene only intensified set on the dark, dank marsh land with characters whose purpose and intent we do not yet understand. Naturally if one is privy to the book, everyone is not just familiar with the players but who they will become - for me that did not lessen the intrigue even being familiar with the story via film adaptations. The direction and acting were still beyond compare. If you are unfamiliar with the plot, much of this will seem a tad... um... perhaps, crazy but the strange thing about Dickens is that his novels are so complex and mysterious but each always have points, meanings to every motivation. He was truly a brilliant author.Having seen two prior versions to this one, this is - by far, the best of the lot. Although I've not read the novel (am I the only one who finds the language... difficult?), a 3-hour miniseries is probably cutting a lot of corners but it felt ""complete"" and authentic to its purpose. Pacing comes across as a bit ""off"" or rushed a time or two but then cramming a lengthy, droning novel into a time slot cannot be an easy feat. For that, scripter's deserve slack. One thing production did not skimp on was casting. The acting is brilliant in this movie - particularly from Gillian Anderson. She owns the role of Miss Havisham. The character is a ghostly shell of a woman whose disappointment has been allowed to rule her life - it has manifested into misery at the least and suicidal tendencies at the worse. Her fragile passive-aggressive attitude is a prison of her own making, instead of moving on and ""being happy"" as Pip once tells her she could have been. Her portrayal of the woman is not likely to be beat in the near future - not even the talented Helena Bonham-Carter will be likely surpass her interpretation. Sometimes, when there is one domineering performance, everyone else pales in comparison, that is fortunately not the case here. Everyone holds their own including newcomers Booth and Kirby. He is nave and conceited to be a strong version of Pip while Kirby is appropriately alluring and cold in a two-dimensional act. Each of the performances is unforgettable in their own right.It is hard to ""like"" any Dickens-esque story because of its themes, and this is not different. It shows how deeply flawed human nature can be - at its worst. It reflects on the sorrows, regrets and tragedies that make life... life. It re-counts the choices that lead to despair and ruin, and leads us to believe that no one is going to be happy because of the choices they have made. Despite having something to live for, Miss Havisham turns her back not just on life but a young girl who could have used love and the affection of a mother instead of the training to become a woman who would grow up to hate men, and consequently be nearly as miserable as the woman who raised her. Despite this being my favorite adaptation of this story, it's not my favorite Dickens film. Anyone who has experienced his works knows each are merely quirky at best but innately depressing and sometimes pure evil lives within the story. Dickens seems in a class that was all his own. Paid by the word, the author wrote characters that strangely nearly always resembled their surnames and were always ""weird"" but curiously loveable - even if his villains were strictly nasty. This production does not have the same ""bite"" as prior movies. There aren't the usual troubling shivers Dickens can sometimes cause and fortunately, for the audience, despite its ending still being ambiguous, and slightly seeming to have been cut short, it will make romantics sigh with pleasure. Not to mention, the costuming is gorgeous and even in some instances, breathtaking. That alone gives this film ""five stars.""Whatever you think of him or his style, know this: Great Expectations, whether changed from the novel or not is distinctively Dickens. Make no mistake.

1527691,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0077PBPGO,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 4]","Great Expectationsis my favourite Charles Dickens novel (at least of the ones I've read) mainly because he endeavoured to subvert many of his trademark plots and stock characters. What results is one of his most intriguing and suspenseful plots, as well as a cast of unforgettable characters, namely a protagonist that goes through serious character development, and two haunting female leads that could easily have carried a novel by themselves.Orphaned Pip leads an uneventful life, in which the most exciting thing to ever befall him is running across an escaped convict on the moors that surround his house. Out of fear he brings the man a file; out of kindness he also brings him a bit of mutton pie. When the man is recaptured, he doesn't give Pip's complicity away. Though Pip never forgets the man, there are soon more interesting developments to monopolize his attention: the eccentric and reclusive Miss Havisham has asked for Pip's presence at her ramshackle Satis House, to serve as a playmate for her adopted daughter Estella. Eager to change the family's fortunes, Pip's sister sends him along, though her husband Joe has reservations.Years pass and Estella is sent to London to become a lady, whilst Pip is apprenticed to Joe as a blacksmith. And then, another surprise: a lawyer appears out of nowhere to bestow upon Pip a fortune, telling him that a secret benefactor wishes him to go to London and become a gentleman. Off he goes, determined to become worthy of Estella's hand in marriage. But naturally, there is more than meets the eye to Pip's abrupt change of fortunes, and throughout the novel Dickens plays with the familiar tropes of the Mysterious Benefactor and the Rags to Riches plot, leading Pip to heartbreak and self-discovery before ending on a rather ambiguous note.Such a story makes for great cinema, and so far the novel has been adapted into so many versions (in1946,1974,1998,2004,2005, as well as a forthcoming one directed by Mike Newell starring Helena Bonham Carter) that it's difficult to keep track of them all. Rich in Gothic imagery (the desolate moors, the embittered mad woman, the criminal underbelly, the forsaken house) and surprising twists, this version of the tale certainly makes the most of its evocative atmosphere. Everything seems to have been shot through a blue filter or else is awash with mist, lending the entire production a cold and bleak air.Stand outs among the cast are Oscar Kennedy and Izzy Meikle-Small as the young Pip and Estella. They're so beguiling in their roles and performances that it was a disappointment when the inevitable switch to their adult selves came. Couldn't we have just stuck with the kids? Unfortunately Douglas Booth as Pip looks ridiculously modern in the role (he's a dead ringer for Robert Pattison), and Vanessa Kirby as Estella is rather bland. Estella makes for a fascinating character in the book, so much so that you often find yourself wishing that *she* was the main character, and is a gift to any actress, whether they choose to play her as an ice-queen or a vulnerable girl-child. Kirby simply isn't given enough time or material to present Estella as anything other than a rather lost-looking doll. Harry Lloyd as Herbert Pocket and Shaun Dooley as Joe Gargery bring some much needed levity to the proceedings, and David Suchet makes for a striking Jaggers (though it's funny to hear him without thePoirotaccent!)But any viewer settling down to watch ""Great Expectations"" will naturally be most interested in its two most memorable characters: Magwich and Miss Havisham. Ray Winstone puts on an admirable show as Magwich, showing his affection for Pip without losing the inherent threat of violence that he poses to those around him, and Gillian Anderson has a unique take on Miss Havisham. It was with interest that I noticed some complaints that she was too young to play the role, when in actuality, Dickens is never clear on Miss Havisham's exact age. Because of her circumstances, many can't help but picture Miss Havisham as an elderly woman, when in fact her contemporary Compeyson is described in the text as a relatively young-looking man - it logically follows that Miss Havisham is too. As such, I wasn't bothered by Anderson's age (in fact, I think it's closer to Dickens's intent than most people realize) and her performance of Havisham as a ghostly, child-like figure with a lisp and a lack of understanding as to what she's really doing is intriguing. There are a few moments of sharp and cunning clarity, such as when she whispers to Estella: ""practice on him..."" or when she looks at Pip with a sort of grotesque fascination, as a cat might look at a mouse before playing with it, but for the most part, one gets the sense that her mind is too undeveloped for her to really be held accountable for her actions. Anderson also adds a habit of scratching or pinching the skin at the back of her hand (scratching to denote agitation, pinching for excitement), suggesting a woman who suffered from some sort of mental affliction long before she was jilted at her wedding. Anderson's take may divide viewers, but I enjoyed the performance, and it's certainly the most memorable part of the production: her bare-footed glide, her gradually degenerating appearance, the way she disappears and reappears like a ghost - it all makes for a great character study.It strikes me that any retelling of ""Great Expectations"" will either focus on the love story between Pip and Estelle, or the Magwich storyline. Most concentrate on the former, but this one definitely favours Magwich, to the point where (as I mentioned earlier) Estella is given rather short shrift. We learn very little about her, and Miss Havisham's plans for her are never quite spelt out to their devastating conclusion. Once past childhood, it's difficult to understand why Pip is so besotted, and Kirby's low-key performance gives off the sense that she's being played as a young Miss Havisham - already a ghost despite being in the bloom of youth. Expect no cruel or vivacious heartbreaker here; this Estella simply goes through the motions whilst Pip is busy with the more important plot developments elsewhere.The production can't help but add some gratuitous ""modern"" sensibilities, such as a scene in which Drummond takes Pip to a brothel and mocks him for his virginity, and a scene in which oh-so-oppressed Estella kicks off her shoes and stockings and goes wading in a lake while her chaperone sleeps, and - as is to be expected - these deviations from Dickens's text do the adaptation absolutely no favours.Yet this is still a fine adaption and I enjoyed it. It moves at a brisk pace, it ticks all the important plot-points, it's well acted by all (even if the leads a tad dull) and it's sensible in focusing on what's important whilst discarding some of the more extraneous bits of Dickens's novel. I was sad to lose some of the supporting cast as well as Dickens's own dialogue (let's face it, no matter how good the adaptation, it'll never hold up to the original novels) but it's ultimately an elegantly filmed and performed bit of entertainment.",4,"""Your Eyes Have Been Opened and Now You Cannot Close Them...""",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,7144,"['Great', 'Expectationsis', 'favourite',

1527692,A14JRNU2JVRBPA,B0077PBPGO,Robert K. Pavlick,"[0, 0]","I think that this is absolutely one of the best versions of ""Great Expectations"" that I have seen to date. I know that some professional reviewers have labeled this made for TV version as pretty bleak and uninspiring, but I guess that depends on what you are looking for. There is nothing ""pretty"" or ""festive"" about Dicken's book, so why would a director want to turn it into some kind of pretty and elegant extravaganza like a Jane Austin novel ?""Great Expectations"" IS bleak and it is almost as much about the jilted bride, Miss Havisham, as it is about young Pip. I think that Gillian Anderson does a marvelous job at portraying Miss Havisham as a woman who has been totally destroyed by love and now has devoted her entire life to grooming her young prodigy, Estella ,to win the hearts of men and then destroy them. I find her blank stare and listlessness and her delivery of those incredible lines about love and beauty and deception, remarkable. I have actually known people like her, suffering from clinical depression, who act exactly like that.  Her line: ""Time stands still here, yet everything turns to dust"", is a classic line, which exemplfies her feelings that even if you could stop time, beauty will ultimately age and wither and turn to dust.The plot, as in most Dickens works, is complex and convoluted with plots within plots so one does need to pay attention. I think that the director delt accurately with the class distinctions of those days and the abject poverty of uneducated rural people. And he,interestingly enough, displayed that there was good and evil at both ends of the spectrum. This is a marvelous study in human nature, showing how people tend to do themselves in by spending their lives in passivity, merely reacting to situations rather than taking charge of their lives and creating situations that will lead to their success and happiness.",5,More Than I Expected,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1880,"['think', 'absolutely', 'one', 'best', 'versions', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'know', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'have', 'labeled', 'made', 'TV', 'version', 'pretty', 'bleak', 'uninspiring', 'guess', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'festive', 'Dicken', 'book', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'director', 'want', 'turn', 'kind', 'pretty', 'elegant', 'extravaganza', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'novel', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'IS', 'bleak', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'jilted', 'bride', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'young', 'Pip', 'think', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'marvelous', 'job', 'portraying', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'love', 'now', 'devoted', 'entire', 'life', 'grooming', 'young', 'prodigy', 'Estella', 'win', 'hearts', 'men', 'then', 'destroy', 'find', 'blank', 'stare', 'listlessness', 'delivery', 'incredible', 'lines', 'love', 'beauty', 'deception', 'remarkable', 'have', 'actually', 'known', 'people', 'suffering', 'clinical', 'depression', 'who', 'act', 'exactly', 'line', 'Time', 'still', 'here', 'yet', 'everything', 'dust', 'classic', 'line', 'feelings', 'even', 'could', 'stop', 'time', 'beauty', 'will', 'ultimately', 'age', 'wither', 'turn', 'dust.The', 'plot', 'most', 'Dickens', 'works', 'complex', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'plots', 'so', 'one', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'director', 'delt', 'accurately', 'class', 'distinctions', 'days', 'abject', 'poverty', 'uneducated', 'rural', 'people', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'displayed', 'was', 'good', 'evil', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'marvelous', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'showing', 'how', 'people', 'tend', 'do', 'spending', 'lives', 'passivity', 'merely', 'reacting', 'situations', 'rather', 'taking', 'charge', 'lives', 'creating', 'situations', 'will', 'lead', 'success', 'happiness']",N/A

Somewhat disappointing was the actress who portrays Estella however.She didn't possess (as the older Estella) what we've come to expect as the physical beauty nor the convincing emotional vacant-ness we want to see in the performance.
