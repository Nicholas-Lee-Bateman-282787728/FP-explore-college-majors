He's handsome, divorced (or about to be as the movie opens), has a 15-year-old daughter he hardly knows, usually has his way with women, and is about to get a promotion. He fancies himself quite the charmer. To his surprise, however, he doesn't get the promotion. Instead, the company brings in Darcy, played by Helen Hunt, from another firm. They're trying to attract more advertising aimed at women. To complicate matters, Nick accidentally electrocuted and suddenly finds that he can hear what women are thinking. It's not usually what he thought they were thinking, but he sees how it might help him get the job he wants, after all.Gibson and Hunt work very nicely together, and the supporting cast is fine, too. Gibson even comes through with a surprisingly nice solo dance routine early in the story. Shades of Fred Astaire! Who knew? Most of the laughs are in the first half of the movie, though. There is a nice scene between Nick and his daughter near the end, but otherwise the last thirty or forty minutes of this one are a little slow. Overall, there are some funny moments.

You got Mel Gibson playing a chauvanistic ad executive whose only primary goal in life is to get ahead in the business world, be a mediocre father, and nail every woman he possible can. Doesn't sound that appealing actually, does it? But alas, it makes for a brilliantly funny movie.Gibson plays Nick, who lives each day to his Frank Sinatra records. He's crude and brash, but those baby blues are hard to resist. When he thinks he's about to be promoted, he learns that his boss hired a woman named Darcy (played by Helen Hunt)for the job he desperately wanted. The first thing she does is assign a fun project for all her fellow advertisers-- try out several women's products (mascara, lipstick) and come up with a tag line for them. Nick is, of course, totally annoyed, but he does it anyway, falling in the bathtub after slipping on little bath pearls and electrocuting himself with a hair dryer. And BAM! He can suddenly hear what women think. What he at first sees as a curse, a therapist (played by a funny Bette Midler) tells him he's got a power most men dream of-- he knows what women want! So the story unfolds with Nick learning about the women in his life and even having an actual relationship with Darcy.This movie is funny and smart, and I never pictured Gibson in this role, although he fits it like a glove. The best kind of movie is the one where you actually believe the actors to be the people they're playing. Gibson has that effect nailed. The movie could have, however, done without the romance actually. Yes, perhaps that's odd of me to say considering that many people will class this movie as a romantic comedy. It would have been just fine with Nick learning about himself and seeing what exactly he could do to make the women around him feel less offended.Bottom line-- this movie is definitely worth seeing. I recommend it to any man who doesn't know what women want at all to perhaps get a few pointers from a fellow clueless man. And those baby blues of Gibson's will have women swooning.

The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking.I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie.

The other bad thing, is Helen Hunt is as dry and unappealing as always (she sleepwalks through her performance, I'm not sure she ever felt pain at all when she was ""acting"" emotionally distraught). In addition, there aren't enough laughs to keep a guy interested when his girlfriend/wife makes him watch this. In addition, the ""thoughts"" that women have in the movie are both far too PG and PC to be believable, and any man who swallows that crap is doomed. This is what women would like to think of themselves thinking, not what they really think about most of the time (not that I would know, which is the point, right?). Alan Alda smarms his way through another role where he can't stop calling attention to the fact that he is Alan Alda. Would someone take up a collection for some acting classes for this lame-O, please?The good things: Mel Gibson gives a stunning performance as a man's man advertising executive who must reinvent himself as a meterosexual when his new boss arrives (Hunt) and starts dropping the Swedish Bikini Team advertising techniques to go after women-customer target accounts. This is delightful tension and a delightful plot twist.Director Nancy Meyers does a superb job, both in framing shots and making the visual narrative match the script and tone setting of the dialogue. There is some flavor of Chicago in the film which adds to the aura.But the best thing Meyers did, other than her mistakes with Alan Alda and Helen Hunt, is the casting. All the secondary women characters have real women's bodies, not the faux emaciated size zero everyone has defaulted to expect in films nowadays. For example, Delta Burke is featured in a role where her curves are simply normal both in relative and absolute terms to all other women characters. This was an excellent decision, and Meyers is amply rewarded with excellent performances from cameo and secondary characters alike. No one need ever fear that this film will promote body type anxiety.The movie is a bit overly long, and therefore the rather abrupt closure of the film appears a bit tacked on in response to going over budget or beyond shooting schedule.

His boss (Alan Alda) is concerned about his company losing the women's market, so he hires the tough and beautiful Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) instead of promoting Nick to the position.  Nick is jealous and sets out to prove that he does understand women, but only with the aid of a supernatural gift that allows him to hear women's thoughts.This is a different role for Gibson unlike the tough guy image he usually portrays.  He does a Sinatra song and dance routine with flair, puts on a pair of pantyhose, and adds a little makeup in one segment.  He is totally out of character, but his performance will impress you; furthermore, Helen Hunt is simply one of the best in the business.

The audience is delivered quite a good insight into his moral -- compared to his workmates, who are astonished, what a man Nick actually can be.  Yet, as soon as he falls in love with Darcy, the whole film is drawn slowly but irresistibly towards a drama losing much of its potential.

The bad word on it was incredible so I'd been avoiding it. I figured hubby wouldn't last at all through it if even I was skeptical about it.  I said my famous opening line to him to get him to watch it, &quot;Let's just give it the 15 minute test.  If it's not even good for that, we'll go onto something else.&quot;  The opening was quite good about the male lead's childhood and I said, &quot;Gee, usually films aren't real bad with that good an opening.&quot;  (When they open with endless minutes of driving around with credits superimposed over the driving, I know that I'm usually in for a real bad time, by contrast.) Fifteen minutes into this film, we were both equally charmed by it and Mel Gibson, whose talent as a romantic lead is not dimmed by age.  Every fifteen minutes one or the other of us muttered about how had this gotten such bad reviews.  I had heard Gibson was too old for this role too.  That is not true either and he is a lot younger than Cary Grant was when he bowled everyone over romantically in &quot;North By Northwest.&quot;  Both hubby and I were also thinking back to the romantic comedies of decades ago and were delighted to see its resurrection here.  Need I say this had Doris Day and Rock Hudson type charm?  I guess I better and remind viewers that &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; were huge, engaging hits with similar material.  The gist of the story is that top ad man Gibson does not get the top job at his agency because it goes to Helen Hunt.  He gets the ability to read women's minds by accident and schemes to get Hunt's job with this newest gift.  He starts falling in love with Hunt though as he steals her ad ideas right out of her head. He has a brief patient-shrink visit with Bette Midler and one of his funniest bits is finding out that women really think he is an incredible jerk! He didn't have a clue, thinking that he was God's gift to women instead. Gibson has some solo moments in the movie which are just great.  He tries on all of a woman's cosmetic products at home one night to learn how to sell them.  This was hilarious, especially watching him wriggle into panty hose.  He also dances with a hat rack a la Fred Astaire and is surprisingly good at it.  This film was directed by a woman, Nancy Meyers, and we both thought that showed in the best sense possible as it was a pleasure to see Gibson not being beaten up or used as action-adventure fodder for a change.  In fact, I haven't enjoyed seeing him in a movie this much in a long, long time and I can remember back to seeing him in his original &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie in the 1970s when it opened in the USA and loving it and seeing him in &quot;Tim&quot; shortly after that and loving that too.  Helen Hunt does a very solid job here too as the female lead but it is obviously a lesser part to Gibson's starring role.  They have very good chemistry together.",5,Almost Didn't See This Film Because of Bad Reviews,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,2992,"['actually', 'waited', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'public', 'library', 'see', 'bad', 'word', 'was', 'incredible', 'so', ""'d"", 'been', 'avoiding', 'figured', 'hubby', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'even', 'was', 'skeptical', 'said', 'famous', 'opening', 'line', 'get', 'watch', 'quot', 'Let', 'just', 'give', '15', 'minute', 'test', 'not', 'even', 'good', ""'ll"", 'go', 'something', 'else.', 'quot', 'opening', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'male', 'lead', 'childhood', 'said', 'quot', 'Gee', 'usually', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'bad', 'good', 'opening.', 'quot', 'When', 'open', 'endless', 'minutes', 'driving', 'credits', 'superimposed', 'driving', 'know', ""'m"", 'usually', 'real', 'bad', 'time', 'contrast', 'Fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'equally', 'charmed', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'talent', 'romantic', 'lead', 'not', 'dimmed', 'age', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'one', 'other', 'muttered', 'how', 'had', 'gotten', 'such', 'bad', 'reviews', 'had', 'heard', 'Gibson', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'too', 'not', 'true', 'either', 'lot', 'younger', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'when', 'bowled', 'everyone', 'romantically', 'quot', 'North', 'Northwest.', 'quot', 'hubby', 'were', 'also', 'thinking', 'back', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'decades', 'ago', 'were', 'delighted', 'see', 'resurrection', 'here', 'Need', 'say', 'had', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'type', 'charm', 'guess', 'better', 'remind', 'viewers', 'quot', 'Pillow', 'Talk', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Back', 'quot', 'were', 'huge', 'engaging', 'hits', 'similar', 'material', 'gist', 'story', 'top', 'ad', 'man', 'Gibson', 'not', 'get', 'top', 'job', 'agency', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'ability', 'read', 'women', 'minds', 'accident', 'schemes', 'get', 'Hunt', 'job', 'newest', 'gift', 'falling', 'love', 'Hunt', 'though', 'ad', 'ideas', 'right', 'head', 'brief', 'patient-shrink', 'visit', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'one', 'funniest', 'bits', 'finding', 'out', 'women', 'really', 'think', 'incredible', 'jerk', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'thinking', 'was', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'instead', 'Gibson', 'solo', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'woman', 'cosmetic', 'products', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'learn', 'how', 'sell', 'was', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'watching', 'wriggle', 'panty', 'hose', 'also', 'hat', 'rack', 'la', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'woman', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'thought', 'showed', 'best', 'sense', 'possible', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Gibson', 'not', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'used', 'action-adventure', 'fodder', 'change', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'much', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'back', 'seeing', 'original', 'quot', 'Mad', 'Max', 'quot', 'movie', '1970s', 'when', 'opened', 'USA', 'loving', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Tim', 'quot', 'shortly', 'loving', 'too', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'very', 'solid', 'job', 'here', 'too', 'female', 'lead', 'obviously', 'lesser', 'part', 'Gibson', 'starring', 'role', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together']",N/A

More importantly, what do members of the opposite sex think about you? And if you knew, what could you do with that information?These are the questions posed to Nick (Mel Gibson). A self professed &quot;ladies man&quot; he waltzes through life from one sexual conquest to another, all the while confident that he is a handsome, well liked, object of affection to women everywhere. But soon Nick's world comes crashing down. He is passed over for a promotion, and his job is given to woman (Helen Hunt). Through a series of comical event Nick is blessed (or cursed... you decide) with the ability to hear the thoughts of the females (not specifically human) around him. He soon learns that he in not the end all, be all object of desire to the female community that he thought he was.  After he re-groups, what Nick decides to do with his new found powers makes for some very funny moments. What does he do you ask? Well, I'm not going to be the one to spoil it for you.Overall, &quot;What Women Want&quot; is a very good movie. It has all the makings of a fine romantic comedy; A handsome man, a beautiful woman, and a great deal of conflict. The only real flaw to the film is towards the end when it starts to become a little too heavy and takes itself just a little too seriously. Those are the times when the movie seems to drag and has trouble getting started again.Gibson and Hunt are actually quite good together, and really have some good on screen chemistry. In addition, the use of Alan Alda, Bette Midler, Delta Burke, and Marisa Tomei in supporting roles is terrific.  The soundtrack is also top notch with a great collection of classic standards by the Chairman of the Board, mixed with a few modern Top 40 tunes.  Gibson really surprises with a small homage to Fred Astaire, and shows that he actually quite light on his feet.If you haven't seen this yet, then you really should, but I would suggest renting before buying... just in case.",3,"Funny Story, Good Cast, and a Great Soundtrack!",989539200,"05 11, 2001",2001,2039,"['not', 'new', 'premise', 'actually', 'old', 'one', 'What', 'do', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'More', 'importantly', 'what', 'do', 'members', 'opposite', 'sex', 'think', 'knew', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'information', 'are', 'questions', 'posed', 'Nick', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'self', 'professed', 'quot', 'man', 'quot', 'life', 'one', 'sexual', 'conquest', 'while', 'confident', 'handsome', 'well', 'liked', 'object', 'affection', 'women', 'everywhere', 'soon', 'Nick', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'passed', 'promotion', 'job', 'given', 'woman', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'series', 'comical', 'event', 'Nick', 'blessed', 'cursed', 'decide', 'ability', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'females', 'not', 'specifically', 'human', 'soon', 'not', 'end', 'be', 'object', 'desire', 'female', 'community', 'thought', 'was', 're-groups', 'what', 'Nick', 'do', 'new', 'found', 'powers', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'What', 'do', 'ask', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'spoil', 'you.Overall', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'makings', 'fine', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'handsome', 'man', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'great', 'deal', 'conflict', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'become', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'drag', 'trouble', 'getting', 'started', 'again.Gibson', 'Hunt', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'together', 'really', 'have', 'good', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'addition', 'use', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'supporting', 'roles', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'great', 'collection', 'classic', 'standards', 'Chairman', 'Board', 'mixed', 'few', 'modern', 'Top', '40', 'tunes', 'Gibson', 'really', 'small', 'homage', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'actually', 'quite', 'light', 'feet.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'then', 'really', 'should', 'would', 'suggest', 'renting', 'buying', 'just', 'case']",N/A
532987,AX8SWWB9837TA,B00003CXQR,Chris Peters,"[5, 5]","What can I say?  Ladies will most likely love this movie, and men will most likely not.  Funny, romantic, but ultimately sexist and insulting, ""What Women Want"" is not the movie you should suggest on your first date.  Cheer it on with your girlfriends, but spare your boyfriend or husband this ""relationship test"" and watch ""When Harry Met Sally"" instead.Mel Gibson plays a charming yet chauvanistic man who suddenly finds he has the ability to read women's minds.  At first overwhelmed, Mel uses his gift for his own personal gain, yet gradually he learns to understand and love women, and in the end he is stripped of his undesirable male qualities and falls for the film's ""every-woman"", Helen Hunt.  Gibson's subtle performance provides the only personality in this entire film,  keeping it from becoming a dry, sexist political statement.  This includes a beautiful dance number to Sinatra which recalls Estare and Crosby (this scene was entirely Gibson's idea).  The other performances, including Helen Hunt's, all fall along the lines of ""the universal woman"" vs. ""the universal man.""  Basically, all the women Gibson interacts with are the same woman, just at different stages in her life.  All the men are deceitful, uncaring, or clueless, save for gorgious hunk Gibson who ""changes"".Fans of this movie might claim that Gibson's highly chauvanistic character lends some balance to the male-bashing, but they fail to realize that healthy men and women are offended by both.  Consider: not only does this film's ""perfect man"" look like Mel Gibson, but he can read minds as well.  Not even the real Mel Gibson can meet those standards.  The ""romantic"" ending of this film has Gibson kissing the heroine right after she fires him.  Our hero. I find it funny that the trailers for this movie showed some derrogatory scenes against Arab women which were cut from the film (pre-Sep 11) for obvious reasons.

532991,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00003CXQR,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[6, 7]","Mel Gibson is charming, and funny, but the film turns away from it's clever premise too early and opts for being a corny predictable mediocre romantic drama rather than an edgy comedy.The good news is, Mel Gibson is one heck of a likeable charismatic charming guy.  He does a nice little throw-away dance number as sort of an homage to Fred Astaire (to Sinatra's Don't Dance). He also does a funny impression of Sean Connery.The funniest moments are mostly the one's you've seen in the commercials (they're a bit less polite in the film then they were in the commercial).  There's a few other amusing ones and plenty of charm and likeable performances from Gibson, Helen Hunt, Alan Alda and Marisa (remember her?) Tomei.  Delta Burke, Valerie Perrine and other actors you might recognize show up but are given very little to do.After setting up the characters like a high class sit-com with bigger stars, the best the writers can come up with is to have Mel Gibson's character nearly electrocute himself in the bathtub with a hair dryer and wake up several hours later with uncanny ability to hear what women are secretly thinking.  The writers (Josh Goldsmith, Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake get the credit) at first manage to keep the premise  from being a bad 70's Disney Comedy in new clothing.  They manage with Nancy Meyer's direction to construct some not quite predictable and amusing scenes which allow Mel Gibson to show off his comic timing.  Helen Hunt has had a lot of practice reacting to goofy male hijinks in her t.v. series Mad About You and does a good job here reacting and playing off Mel Gibson.  She shines in a few moments where she's got the laugh lines.The film drops most of its comedy at about the half-way point and becomes a straight romantic film.  A predictable, corny, tired romantic film which offers no surprises, interesting twists or anything funny during it's last half hour.  The only reason it stays afloat is because of the charm and charisma or the lead actors.But what do I know? It's doing well at the box-office, a lot of people will tell their friends it's a pretty good film with some very funny scenes in the beginning before it turns into a mushy corny film at the end.Awwwww mushy and corny ain't so bad is it?Well, no... there's nothing with some romance and even corniness in a film, but not one that starts out in a different direction and then decides that audiences really want a nice romantic film to go to over the holiday season so we'll play everything as safe and predictable as a t.v. sit-com that suddenly gets serious to deliver a message about doing the right thing and telling the truth.I hope women (and men too) want more from their movies than this one delivers.

If anything this movie is more about &quot;what if&quot; male fantasy. The premise is; you could read the oh so complex mind of a woman, how easy, and tempting it would be to misuse that information.Mel Gibson seems to have as much a gift for physical comedy as he does for doing action pictures.  The scenes where he tries out womens products as a work assignment are priceless.  In this movie he has good chemistry with Helen Hunt, and it helps fill out the romatic side of the story well.  One of his other films:  Bird on a Wire was pretty flat because there was just no apparent attraction between him, and costar Goldie Hawn.  In this one the romantic chemistry works fine.If the movie can be faulted its because its a little too short.  I would like to see Hollywood put a little more film in the can when they come up with a good idea like this.  Its not like they were spending a lot on special effects and car chases here.

532994,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00003CXQR,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","The basic premise for this movie - a man that gains the power to read women's minds - is such an obvious plotline that I can't believe there aren't a dozen movies out there like it.  Mel Gibson's character is the &quot;lucky&quot; recipient of this power.  At first he can't deal with it, but soon learns (after a chat with Bette Midler as a psychiatrist in a juicy cameo) he can use the power to become great in bed, patch things up with his daughter, and undercut his new boss (who &quot;stole&quot; his promotion), played by Helen Hunt.It's true that the characters are a little thin and two-dimensional, but who cares?  You don't watch a movie like this for deep meaning, who watch because it's fun, energetic, and funny, much like the old Cary Grant comedies.Overall the performances in this film are excellent.  Mel has a lot of fun with the role, that of a misogynist ad executive that eventually learns to become a new age sensitive guy.  Hunt is good as well, starting off as a foil who eventually falls in love with him; their romantic chemistry is very good.  Marissa Tomei's aspiring actress who is seduced by Gibson is the worst of the two-dimensional characters (not her fault, she does her best with the material), while the best supporting character is the suicidal clerk played by Judy Greer.  The interaction between Gibson's executive and the clerk is the turning point in the exec's transformation between jerk and good guy.There are a few extras on the DVD.  There are two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes, one of which is in the irritating &quot;extended trailer&quot; style that I hate, but the other is interesting, if short, and includes some interview clips with the actors talking about working with the other members of the cast and crew.  The commentary by director Meyers (along with the production designer, but he doesn't say much) is interesting as it ranges over a wide variety of topics, including the actors, the sets, and technical details like audio dubbing.All in all, it's a fun movie for an evening where you just want to sit back and be entertained.",4,Fun and funny,994032000,"07 2, 2001",2001,2092,"['basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'man', 'gains', 'power', 'read', 'women', 'minds', 'such', 'obvious', 'plotline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'dozen', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'quot', 'quot', 'recipient', 'power', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'soon', 'learns', 'chat', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'psychiatrist', 'juicy', 'cameo', 'can', 'use', 'power', 'become', 'great', 'bed', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'daughter', 'undercut', 'new', 'boss', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'promotion', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt.It', 'true', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'thin', 'two-dimensional', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'deep', 'meaning', 'who', 'watch', 'fun', 'energetic', 'funny', 'much', 'old', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'comedies.Overall', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'Mel', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'misogynist', 'ad', 'executive', 'eventually', 'become', 'new', 'age', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'Hunt', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'starting', 'off', 'foil', 'who', 'eventually', 'love', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'very', 'good', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'seduced', 'Gibson', 'worst', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'not', 'fault', 'best', 'material', 'best', 'supporting', 'character', 'suicidal', 'clerk', 'played', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'interaction', 'Gibson', 'executive', 'clerk', 'turning', 'point', 'exec', 'transformation', 'jerk', 'good', 'guy.There', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'two', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'featurettes', 'one', 'irritating', 'quot', 'extended', 'trailer', 'quot', 'style', 'hate', 'other', 'interesting', 'short', 'interview', 'clips', 'actors', 'talking', 'working', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentary', 'director', 'Meyers', 'production', 'designer', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'interesting', 'wide', 'variety', 'topics', 'including', 'actors', 'sets', 'technical', 'details', 'audio', 'dubbing.All', 'fun', 'movie', 'evening', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'entertained']",N/A

Nancy MeyersI'm glad to discover a woman directed it, for she ought to know what women want.A Mel Gibson vehicle. Also a Helen Hunt vehicle. Also a vehicle for the numerous women in the film. Also a vehicle for men whose obscure mental processes don't know what women want.An interesting premise: through an accident (a near electrocution), Gibson's mind acquires the ability to hear women's thoughts. At first this puzzles him, enervates him, and he is left clueless as to what to do. He is insulted to hear the vile things women think about him. He thinks this is a curse, not a gift. Soon, however, a therapist (Bette Middler) suggests that he take advantage of this unexpected talent--and become a mind reader. He steals an idea from his boss (Helen Hunt) about an advertising campaign--and he gets a big job while she is fired.They begin a romance, of course. Gibson also has trouble with his teenage daughter (Ashley Johnson), but through mind reading their relations smooth. He also has a girl friend, Lola (Marisa Tomei), reads her mind, knows she wants sex with him; he has sex with her, and of course also with Hunt (whose first name is Darcy), for she too desires him. Eventually, through another near electrocution, he becomes cured of this aberration--and normal again. Now he is happy, having secured Hunt's job again, having gotten rid of Lola, and reconciled himself with his daughter--who thinks him a caring parent now.No a bad premise, but a pretty ordinary story comes out of it. It would have been more interesting if Gibson and Hunt engaged in a battle of wits (or battles of the sexes) as Beatrice and Benedict do in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. This actually starts when Marshall steals an idea from McGuire's head; it would have been interesting if she had understood his game and exposed him. By remaining ignorant, she plays the game at a disadvantage, and her status in the story is reduced. In other words, both Hunt and Gibson play a more or less dumb plot--and roles. The script, clever up to a point, falls back into the trodden paths--romantic plots--and loses whatever punch it had. It reduces two competent actors (not to mention some of the others in the ensemble cast) to repeating worn out trivialities instead of engaging them in a truly ingenious contest of mind and feeling.This role is especially painful for Gibson, who looks older (he is) and capable of going beyond the trivial roles that his profession imposes upon him. After Braveheart (so-so to me), the masculine monster of the Lethal Weapon series, and, above, all the two movies he made with Australian auteur Peter Weir--Galipolli and The Year of Living Dangerously--this movie is a fall-off in status. Helen Hunt, too, is reduced to unintelligence, though she manages a slithering sexiness and a presence that only a mature actress can project. Overall, though, this is not as much a bad movie as a lost opportunity. Actors, like everyone else, age, and their glory passes.",3,"Not a bad idea, but...",1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,3014,"['What', 'Women', 'Want', '2000', 'dir', 'Nancy', 'MeyersI', ""'m"", 'glad', 'discover', 'woman', 'directed', 'ought', 'know', 'what', 'women', 'want.A', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'vehicle', 'Also', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'vehicle', 'Also', 'vehicle', 'numerous', 'women', 'film', 'Also', 'vehicle', 'men', 'obscure', 'mental', 'processes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'women', 'want.An', 'interesting', 'premise', 'accident', 'electrocution', 'Gibson', 'mind', 'ability', 'hear', 'women', 'thoughts', 'first', 'left', 'clueless', 'what', 'do', 'insulted', 'hear', 'vile', 'things', 'women', 'think', 'curse', 'not', 'gift', 'Soon', 'however', 'therapist', 'Bette', 'Middler', 'take', 'advantage', 'unexpected', 'talent', 'become', 'mind', 'reader', 'idea', 'boss', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'big', 'job', 'fired.They', 'begin', 'romance', 'course', 'Gibson', 'also', 'trouble', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'mind', 'reading', 'relations', 'smooth', 'also', 'girl', 'friend', 'Lola', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'mind', 'sex', 'sex', 'course', 'also', 'Hunt', 'first', 'name', 'Darcy', 'too', 'Eventually', 'near', 'electrocution', 'cured', 'aberration', 'normal', 'again', 'Now', 'happy', 'having', 'secured', 'Hunt', 'job', 'again', 'having', 'gotten', 'rid', 'Lola', 'reconciled', 'daughter', 'who', 'caring', 'parent', 'now.No', 'bad', 'premise', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'Gibson', 'Hunt', 'engaged', 'battle', 'wits', 'battles', 'sexes', 'Beatrice', 'Benedict', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'actually', 'when', 'Marshall', 'idea', 'McGuire', 'head', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'understood', 'game', 'exposed', 'remaining', 'ignorant', 'game', 'disadvantage', 'status', 'story', 'reduced', 'other', 'words', 'Hunt', 'Gibson', 'play', 'more', 'less', 'dumb', 'plot', 'roles', 'script', 'clever', 'up', 'point', 'back', 'trodden', 'paths', 'romantic', 'plots', 'punch', 'had', 'two', 'competent', 'actors', 'not', 'mention', 'others', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'repeating', 'worn', 'out', 'trivialities', 'instead', 'engaging', 'truly', 'ingenious', 'contest', 'mind', 'feeling.This', 'role', 'especially', 'painful', 'Gibson', 'who', 'older', 'capable', 'going', 'trivial', 'roles', 'profession', 'Braveheart', 'so-so', 'masculine', 'monster', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'two', 'movies', 'made', 'Australian', 'auteur', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Galipolli', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'movie', 'fall-off', 'status', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'too', 'reduced', 'unintelligence', 'slithering', 'sexiness', 'presence', 'only', 'mature', 'actress', 'can', 'project', 'Overall', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'movie', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'Actors', 'everyone', 'else', 'age', 'glory', 'passes']",N/A

ANTIL,"[0, 0]","I was really looking forward to this movie when I saw the previews, mainly because it starred two of my favorite actors; Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.  I must say I was slightly disappointed...  but only slightly.  It is a very funny movie.  Mel plays Nick, a shallow womanizer who suddenly has the ability to hear what females are thinking (all females, including dogs).  Nick, while a basically decent sort of guy, is not altogether likeable, especially if you have strong values about feminism.  Mel's portrayal is excellent, especially during scenes of outrageousness (like the scenes where he tries the feminine products).  But, his character is too superficial to feel for.  Helen Hunt's character Darcy, on the other hand, is real and down to earth, and very likeable.  There is one poignant moment when Nick uses his &quot;gift&quot; to help a girl who might commit suicide.  If there were more moments like this in the film, it would have been much more substantial and enjoyable movie.  There was one whole area of the film that made no sense to me -- there's a girl in a coffee shop with whom Nick had always flirted... she had always made it clear that she was interested... but, only after Nick gets his new ability does he ask her out.  But, he's too preoccupied with Darcy to take their relationship seriously.  I was left thinking, &quot;What was the point of that?&quot;  Overall, it's a very funny, but superficial romantic comedy (with a somewhat predictable ending).",3,Very funny... on the surface,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,1483,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'mainly', 'starred', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'only', 'slightly', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'Mel', 'Nick', 'shallow', 'womanizer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'ability', 'hear', 'what', 'females', 'are', 'thinking', 'females', 'including', 'dogs', 'Nick', 'basically', 'decent', 'sort', 'guy', 'not', 'altogether', 'likeable', 'especially', 'have', 'strong', 'values', 'feminism', 'Mel', 'portrayal', 'excellent', 'especially', 'scenes', 'outrageousness', 'scenes', 'where', 'feminine', 'products', 'character', 'too', 'superficial', 'feel', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'character', 'Darcy', 'other', 'hand', 'real', 'down', 'earth', 'very', 'likeable', 'one', 'poignant', 'moment', 'when', 'Nick', 'quot', 'gift', 'quot', 'help', 'girl', 'who', 'might', 'commit', 'suicide', 'were', 'more', 'moments', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'substantial', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'whole', 'area', 'film', 'made', 'sense', 'girl', 'coffee', 'shop', 'whom', 'Nick', 'had', 'always', 'flirted', 'had', 'always', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'interested', 'only', 'Nick', 'new', 'ability', 'ask', 'out', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'Darcy', 'take', 'relationship', 'seriously', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'quot', 'Overall', 'very', 'funny', 'superficial', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'ending']",N/A
532998,A1GALZCXD8FHOR,B00003CXQR,Daniel L Edelen,"[10, 15]","I was able to watch ""What Women Want"" free of charge.And that is the only way to watch it since it is quite disposable as a romantic comedy. This is one of those films the wife begs to see - if you catch my drift.Now I am not saying I despise romantic comedies. Great ones do exist. This is simply not one of them.The film starts out promisingly enough. The anti-Cary Grant character that Mel Gibson plays finds it necessary to clue his playboy self into what women want materially in order to keep up with the new female boss (Helen Hunt) at his ad agency. Due to a freakish accident (in one of the few genuinely funny scenes in the movie), he receives the gimmick of being able to actually hear women thinking. Blessed/cursed by this gift, he surmises that he can use it to get exactly what HE wants. Wronged by his new outsider boss who stole the position he was due, he subtly begins to undermine her career. But even as he does, he finds her to be more than he imagined, falling in love with her along the way. Think of it as an update of a film in the manner of ""His Girl Friday"".But where that film is a classic, this one is a lesson in how to suffocate a movie. Each minute of running time draws a noose around the neck of the film so by the time it ends its finale is impossible to write. In fact, this movie has one of the most contrived and poorly-penned endings in the history of romantic comedies. My wife and I just looked at each other and said, ""Aw, c'mon!"" To the director/writer, I simply give the advice that it is essential to make the audience buy the ending in any romantic comedy. She failed miserably in this regard and just killed the movie. Sadly, the DVD's commentary track exposes her own trepidations concerning the ending, but she never listened to those nagging doubts and the ending is a mess because of that.Oscar-winning actress Marisa Tomei is wasted in the film. Mel is often forced to do schtick while Oscar-winning Helen is simply lifeless compared to her turn in ""As Good As It Gets"". So much high-caliber talent, yet such torture to watch them flail within their caricatures. When you see the gears grinding, you know the film just isn't working.The DVD offers no great redemption, either. Usually a director's commentary provides some insights, but the director is so self-important it is hard to listen. I feel for the male production designer who joined her on the commentary track because she interrupts him mercilessly.

What a shame he flourished in the wrong century, for otherwise he would have discovered courtesy of this finely untuned film. The answer to what women what is: well, actually the question is phrased wrongly. The question we should be asking is: what do Nike want women to want? And the answer, of course, is: Nike sportswear. Easy!Never has product placement been more shameless. And never has Helen Hunt seemed more at sea, which isn't her fault as she has an impossible role: the women who outsmarts the man with every single possible advantageous loading the film can get him. Even his flaws work in his favour: thus he's the ultimate womaniser yet - and this is a tad strange, you might think - has a sexual technique that would make a rhino look leisurely. This is the big brother of the 'ha, you may have ruined our lives but you have small genitals' school of writing, in which all patriarchal power is pretty much left in place, apart from a small genital gag which somehow makes everything all right. Anyway, Marisa Tomei cures Mel of his rhinoceros loving, and after that... Well, nothing much really. He pays attention to his daughter, he falls in the least convincing love to hit our screens for a few weeks, and he stops a geek-slash-wallflower from killing herself. Our hero!But the main point of the film: he gives a really cool presentation to the Nike team, about the forthcoming campaign which is shown in all its virtuosity.

He plays Nick Marshall, a Chicago ad executive whose male chauvinism, we are led to believe, is the inevitable result of his upbringing by a Las Vegas showgirl mother and her rather unsavory cohorts. The relationships with the women in his life are distant and unhealthy, until one night,after a splendid dance number, an accident with a hairdryer, which takes place in time to a well-orchestrated waltz, changes his life. After the electric shock renders him able to hear women's thoughts, he finds himself at a loss, realizing how much he is resented by the opposite sex, but takes advantage of his new boss, Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt whose natural beauty, wit, and intelligence make her the perfect foil for Gibson, and of a lonely coffee shop clerk played with pathos by Marisa Tomei. The scene in which he spends an ilicit evening with Tomei's character, Lola, is a hilarious one in which Gibson once more displays the powerfully muscular physique that could have inspired Michaelangelo's &quot;David&quot;. In contrast, the scenes where he hams it up on an outing with his long-neglected daughter, Alex, played by a doll-faced but fashionable-looking Ashley Johnson, are a bit more poignant when at one point, his fatherly pride stands revealed on his face. Of all the females whose minds he is able to read, it is the stinging evaluation of his teenage daughter, whose boyfriend treats women the same way he does, that wounds Nick Marshall the most. Alan Alda's role as Nick's equally chauvinistic mentor is an ironic one, given Alda's well-known real-life support of women's issues. Mark Feurstein is funny as Nick's protege who becomes baffled by his mentor's chane of heart. We can't write Nick off completely because his new found ability gradually makes him a better person, even compelling him to personally reconcile with a spurned employee with a suicidal bent, and sparing the feelings of a former fling, even though he resorts to lying. Darcy Maguire is strong enough to appropriately penalize Nick for using her. But in Movieland, there are few women whom the spreading of Gibson's lazily-formed, sharp-cornered Cupid's Bow mouth into a dazzling smile can't disarm. Lauren Holly, and Bette Midler as Nick's ex-wife and ex-marriage counselor, and Valerie Perrine and Delta Burke as Nick's mindless office mannequins provide intersting counterparts. While it probably could have been a little less crass, and certain scenes are definitely not for children, &quot;What Women Want&quot;, arguably 2000's answer to &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, is a stylish charmer that I'd recommend to anyone, male or female.",5,An Elegantly Comic and Twilight-Zonish Masterpiece,997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,2771,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'superb', 'comic', 'timing', 'rougish', 'charm', 'drippingly', 'gorgeous', 'looks', 'are', 'largely', 'reponsible', 'making', 'film', 'winner', 'Nick', 'Marshall', 'Chicago', 'ad', 'executive', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'inevitable', 'result', 'upbringing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'mother', 'rather', 'unsavory', 'cohorts', 'relationships', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'distant', 'unhealthy', 'one', 'night', 'splendid', 'dance', 'number', 'accident', 'hairdryer', 'place', 'time', 'well-orchestrated', 'waltz', 'life', 'electric', 'shock', 'renders', 'able', 'hear', 'women', 'thoughts', 'loss', 'realizing', 'how', 'much', 'resented', 'opposite', 'sex', 'advantage', 'new', 'boss', 'Darcy', 'McGuire', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'natural', 'beauty', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'make', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Gibson', 'lonely', 'coffee', 'shop', 'played', 'pathos', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'scene', 'ilicit', 'evening', 'Tomei', 'character', 'Lola', 'hilarious', 'one', 'Gibson', 'once', 'more', 'displays', 'powerfully', 'muscular', 'physique', 'could', 'have', 'inspired', 'Michaelangelo', 'quot', 'David', 'quot', 'contrast', 'scenes', 'where', 'up', 'outing', 'long-neglected', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'played', 'doll-faced', 'fashionable-looking', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'poignant', 'when', 'one', 'point', 'fatherly', 'pride', 'revealed', 'face', 'females', 'minds', 'able', 'read', 'stinging', 'evaluation', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'women', 'same', 'way', 'Nick', 'Marshall', 'most', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'role', 'Nick', 'equally', 'chauvinistic', 'mentor', 'ironic', 'one', 'given', 'Alda', 'well-known', 'real-life', 'support', 'women', 'issues', 'Mark', 'Feurstein', 'funny', 'Nick', 'protege', 'who', 'baffled', 'mentor', 'chane', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'Nick', 'off', 'completely', 'new', 'found', 'ability', 'gradually', 'better', 'person', 'even', 'compelling', 'personally', 'reconcile', 'spurned', 'employee', 'suicidal', 'bent', 'sparing', 'feelings', 'former', 'fling', 'even', 'lying', 'Darcy', 'Maguire', 'strong', 'enough', 'appropriately', 'penalize', 'Nick', 'using', 'Movieland', 'are', 'few', 'women', 'whom', 'spreading', 'Gibson', 'lazily-formed', 'sharp-cornered', 'Cupid', 'Bow', 'mouth', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disarm', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Nick', 'ex-wife', 'ex-marriage', 'counselor', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Nick', 'mindless', 'office', 'mannequins', 'provide', 'intersting', 'counterparts', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'less', 'crass', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'arguably', '2000', 'answer', 'quot', 'First', 'Wives', 'Club', 'quot', 'stylish', 'charmer', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'male', 'female']",N/A

533005,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXQR,D. Litton,"[4, 7]","&quot;What Women Want&quot; tells the story of a man who thinks he's God's gift to women, until he receives a little gift of his own: the ability to hear what women think. The movie stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, both of whom give excellent performances and have a unique chemistry which is not explosive but still convincing. The movie has everything going for it, but the third act fizzles out and the laughs die too quickly, which takes away from the luster of the genuinely funny scenes in the beginning and mid- sections.Gibson was the ideal choice for Nick Marshall, a hotshot advertising executive whose company has just hired Darcy McGuire instead of him as the new creative director. Her approach to boosting sales focuses on marketing products to women, and each of the meeting attendees are given a box full of women's products. As Nick tries out the products in order to get a feel for the ideas Darcy is looking for, a freak accident gives him the unthinkable power of hearing womens' thoughts and feelings.At first intimidated by his newfound ability, Nick soon gains control over his fear and is able to use it to his advantage, hoping that stealing Darcy's ideas and making them his own will get him the position and her out of the company. But he soon starts falling in love with her, and finds out that what he is doing isn't such a good idea after all, especially when she is fired.The comedy of the film has a certain sophistication which rises above such comedies as &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Scary Movie.&quot; It never goes into the gross-out category, nor does it push the envelope. Our protagonist, Nick, goes through everything a normal man would avoid: waxing his legs, applying mascara to his eyes, nail polish, and listening to Meredith Brooks' &quot;Bitch&quot; while trying on black pantyhose and a push-up bra. His awkwardness in taking on these tasks is absolutely hilarious. More comic relief comes when he hears womens' thoughts, especially that of the guard at his building, who has a hidden attraction for him.The movie is a subconscious battle of the sexes, with Nick trying to mold himself into what each of the women he comes in contact with wants. The men in the audience will agree with the confusion he goes through as he turns himself into a sex machine for the girl in the coffee shop, while putting on the sensitive charm and man-oriented jokes for the women at work. This is some of Gibson's best work, and his ability to go from emotion to emotion is a testament to that ability and stamina.His supporting cast includes a lot of well-knowns, most of whom have small cameos. Helen Hunt has all the look, charm and appeal of a real advertising creative director; she's the kind of actress who you could believe in a role like this. Marisa Tomei is a riot in her role as the coffee shop waitress, while Lauren Holly gives a small yet winning performance as Nick's ex-wife. Alan Alda makes an appearance as the head of the company, while Delta Burke and Bette Midler appear as well. This is one of those sparkling casts that shines no matter what the material, and their interactions are natural and make the movie enjoyable.The only thing preventing this movie is its length, which will certainly have an effect on the overall movie after it ends. The first two thirds of the movie are comedic brilliance, helmed by Gibson, but once the awkwardness of his situation gives way to the budding romance between Nick and Darcy, the movie slows down considerably, dragging out over the course of almost an hour as Nick debates whether or not to tell her about sabotaging her job. The comedy also comes to a halt, and while there are a few laughs left over, the chuckles and side-splitting laughter which comes with earlier moments is lost to the lengthy melodrama.Still, &quot;What Women Want&quot; is a funny movie which does succeed in delivering laughs. Gibson does some of his best comedic work here, and this will be remembered as one of his best roles. Though the film lacks a solid ending, within the overall film lies an intriguing look at the battle of the sexes and how it shapes our lives.",3,"A pretty funny movie, but too long.",990316800,"05 20, 2001",2001,4149,"['quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'little', 'gift', 'own', 'ability', 'hear', 'what', 'women', 'think', 'movie', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'whom', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'have', 'unique', 'chemistry', 'not', 'explosive', 'still', 'convincing', 'movie', 'everything', 'going', 'third', 'act', 'out', 'laughs', 'die', 'too', 'quickly', 'away', 'luster', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'mid-', 'sections.Gibson', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'Nick', 'Marshall', 'hotshot', 'advertising', 'executive', 'company', 'just', 'hired', 'Darcy', 'McGuire', 'instead', 'new', 'creative', 'director', 'approach', 'boosting', 'sales', 'marketing', 'products', 'women', 'meeting', 'attendees', 'are', 'given', 'box', 'full', 'women', 'products', 'Nick', 'out', 'products', 'order', 'get', 'feel', 'ideas', 'Darcy', 'looking', 'freak', 'accident', 'unthinkable', 'power', 'hearing', 'womens', 'thoughts', 'feelings.At', 'first', 'intimidated', 'newfound', 'ability', 'Nick', 'soon', 'gains', 'control', 'fear', 'able', 'use', 'advantage', 'hoping', 'stealing', 'Darcy', 'ideas', 'making', 'own', 'will', 'get', 'position', 'out', 'company', 'soon', 'falling', 'love', 'out', 'what', 'doing', ""n't"", 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'especially', 'when', 'fired.The', 'comedy', 'film', 'certain', 'sophistication', 'such', 'comedies', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'quot', 'Scary', 'Movie.', 'quot', 'never', 'gross-out', 'category', 'push', 'envelope', 'protagonist', 'Nick', 'everything', 'normal', 'man', 'would', 'avoid', 'waxing', 'legs', 'applying', 'mascara', 'eyes', 'nail', 'polish', 'listening', 'Meredith', 'Brooks', 'quot', 'Bitch', 'quot', 'trying', 'black', 'pantyhose', 'push-up', 'bra', 'awkwardness', 'taking', 'tasks', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'More', 'comic', 'relief', 'when', 'womens', 'thoughts', 'especially', 'guard', 'building', 'who', 'hidden', 'attraction', 'him.The', 'movie', 'subconscious', 'battle', 'sexes', 'Nick', 'trying', 'mold', 'what', 'women', 'contact', 'men', 'audience', 'will', 'agree', 'confusion', 'sex', 'machine', 'girl', 'coffee', 'shop', 'putting', 'sensitive', 'charm', 'man-oriented', 'jokes', 'women', 'work', 'Gibson', 'best', 'work', 'ability', 'go', 'emotion', 'emotion', 'testament', 'ability', 'stamina.His', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lot', 'well-knowns', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'small', 'cameos', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'look', 'charm', 'appeal', 'real', 'advertising', 'creative', 'director', 'kind', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'believe', 'role', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'riot', 'role', 'coffee', 'shop', 'waitress', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'small', 'yet', 'winning', 'performance', 'Nick', 'ex-wife', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'appearance', 'head', 'company', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'appear', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'sparkling', 'casts', 'matter', 'what', 'material', 'interactions', 'are', 'natural', 'make', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'preventing', 'movie', 'length', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'effect', 'overall', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'are', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'helmed', 'Gibson', 'once', 'awkwardness', 'situation', 'way', 'budding', 'romance', 'Nick', 'Darcy', 'movie', 'down', 'considerably', 'dragging', 'out', 'course', 'almost', 'hour', 'Nick', 'not', 'tell', 'sabotaging', 'job', 'comedy', 'also', 'halt', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'left', 'over', 'chuckles', 'side-splitting', 'laughter', 'earlier', 'moments', 'lost', 'lengthy', 'melodrama.Still', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'funny', 'movie', 'succeed', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'Gibson', 'best', 'comedic', 'work', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'film', 'solid', 'ending', 'overall', 'film', 'intriguing', 'look', 'battle', 'sexes', 'how', 'lives']",N/A

Nick feels betrayed by his boss, played by Alan Alda, and threatened by Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt.  Darcy is hired to fill the position of creative director at an advertising firm.  This job was, in Nick's mind, his for the taking.Now here's the twist.  Nick, while intoxicated, was trying on pantyhose and a waxing his legs in an effort to get in to the minds of women.  While doing this, he fell into the tub while holding a hairdryer.  After he woke, he could hear the inner-most thoughts of all females.  Be it a little girl, adult woman, and even a French poodle.  This gives him the ability to steal the ideas straight out of the heads of women.  He uses this to his advantage (after the shock of this ""gift"" wears off).

533015,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXQR,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","Clearly what women want is as much Mel Gibson as they can get.  This combination comedy and love story starts smartly, but unravels when the love story attempts to take itself seriously.  However, that didn't keep the film from topping $200 Million worldwide at the box office.Nick Marshall is a ""man's man"", a self-absorbed chauvinist who has little respect for women.  When his big promotion is given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), Nick plots for a way to bring her down.  In the course of trying out women's products to get ""the female perspective"", he accidentally electrocutes himself, giving himself the power to read women's minds.  Though highly contrived (why only women's thoughts?), the comedic gimmick is novel and produces numerous hilarious moments.  Nick decides he is going to use his special powers to undermine Darcy in her position and seduce her in the process.  Predictably, they fall in love, which leads to a soulless, but schmaltzy romance that throws a cold bucket of water on the merriment.Director Nancy Meyers has written a number of successful lightweight comedies (""Private Benjamin"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""The Parent Trap""), often teaming with her husband, director Charles Shyer.  This is her second directorial project after ""The Parent Trap"" and is by far the most ambitious project she has undertaken.  It is clear here that comedy is her strong suit.  The comedy bits are well done and the gimmick is liberally explored with good results.  In contrast, the romance is stilted and unnatural (due in part to the abysmal chemistry between Gibson and Hunt) and Meyers doesn't know when to quit, pouring it on ad nauseam.Mel Gibson is the right actor for the comedy and the wrong actor for the romance.  He has always done well at wry macho comedy (See Lethal Weapon 1-4), but when it comes to romance, he's a dud.  Though intoxicating to the female eye, Gibson is all thumbs when it comes to sensitive and sentimental interchanges.  Like Nick, Gibson is a ""man's man"" and he is unable to bring the character to the proper transition.Helen Hunt often reminds me of Jody Foster in that she seems like a man trapped in a woman's body.  However, unlike Foster, Hunt doesn't seem comfortable in that prison and always comes across as if she is having a gender crisis.  Whereas Foster is an electrifying actor who is obviously at ease with her no-bull personality, Hunt feels compelled to force out her sensitive side, making her constantly appear awkward and unnatural.  This disconnect is particularly grating here, especially given Gibson's handicap in the sentimentality department.  The one compensation is that Hunt's deadpan seriousness is a comedic asset in her role as straight-woman (which is one of the primary reasons ""Mad About You"" succeeded on TV).Once again, Marisa Tomei proves that she is one of the most underrated actors in film with a show stopping performance as Lola.  I have often wondered why she doesn't get meatier roles.  She has mostly been relegated to quirky character roles, where she invariably outshines the leads.  Her confrontation with Nick here is one of the highlights of the film.This film is easy to like.  It can be forgiven its abortive attempt at matchmaking between Gibson and Hunt simply because the comedy bits are so funny.  I rated it a 7/10.

I was kind of interested by the trailer at the concept of mind reading but like UNBREAKABLE there is not enough of it.The plot is schmaltzy and clich&eacute;d and is presented in the most boring and unoriginal way. Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, an executive at an advertising company (lead characters in these type of comedies are always high-fliers, think of Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, Tim Robbins in Nothing To Lose, Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights or even Nic Cage in Family Man) who is very male-chauvinistic and is generally disliked by women. Then one night he is electrocuted in the bath while wearing panties and make-up, he wakes up the next morning with the ability to hear women's thoughts.This could have been cool but in a 127 minute movie (overlong) there is a window of about 40 minutes in which Mel is able to read minds and only 10 minutes of that is devoted to actually doing it. What a waste, it turns the movie into a totally pointless experience. If it had been different, if the main characters were younger, didn't have the clich&eacute;d &quot;high-flier&quot; jobs or if the plot had more on it's mind than a man and a woman falling in love there could have been a cool movie here. Even the photography is bad, too many shades of brown and most of the picture out of focus with exception for the actors.Marisa Tomei is criminally underused. She is shunted into a sidecar role that fades further away as the movie progresses more and more into schmaltzy clich&eacute;. I know there are... sub-plots about Nick's estranged daughter (clich&eacute;d) and his attempts to abuse his &quot;powers&quot; to better himself at work but these are really just there to boost the &quot;man and woman falling in love&quot; story. Let's be honest, how many movies are out there are about a man and woman falling in love? Too many. Do we need any more? No. But because Mel is in it WWW has become a success.If David Schwimmer played Nick Marshall...?The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is undermatted at 1.78:1 instead of the theatrical 1.85:1.",1,NOT GOOD,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2142,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'quot', 'much', 'quot', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'was', 'kind', 'interested', 'trailer', 'concept', 'mind', 'reading', 'UNBREAKABLE', 'not', 'enough', 'it.The', 'plot', 'schmaltzy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'presented', 'most', 'boring', 'unoriginal', 'way', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Nick', 'Marshall', 'executive', 'advertising', 'company', 'lead', 'characters', 'type', 'comedies', 'are', 'always', 'high-fliers', 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Nothing', 'Lose', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'even', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'Family', 'Man', 'who', 'very', 'male-chauvinistic', 'generally', 'disliked', 'women', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'electrocuted', 'bath', 'wearing', 'panties', 'make-up', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'ability', 'hear', 'women', 'thoughts.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cool', '127', 'minute', 'movie', 'overlong', 'window', '40', 'minutes', 'Mel', 'able', 'read', 'minds', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'actually', 'doing', 'What', 'waste', 'movie', 'totally', 'pointless', 'experience', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'younger', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clich', 'eacute', 'quot', 'high-flier', 'quot', 'jobs', 'plot', 'had', 'more', 'mind', 'man', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'movie', 'here', 'Even', 'photography', 'bad', 'too', 'many', 'shades', 'brown', 'most', 'picture', 'focus', 'exception', 'actors.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'criminally', 'underused', 'shunted', 'sidecar', 'role', 'further', 'away', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'schmaltzy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'know', 'are', 'sub-plots', 'Nick', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'attempts', 'abuse', 'quot', 'powers', 'quot', 'better', 'work', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'there', 'boost', 'quot', 'man', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'quot', 'story', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'are', 'man', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'Too', 'many', 'Do', 'need', 'more', 'No', 'Mel', 'WWW', 'become', 'success.If', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'played', 'Nick', 'Marshall', 'DVD', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'undermatted', '1.78:1', 'instead', 'theatrical', '1.85:1']",N/A

Nick Marshall was raised by a showgirl mother, and has always been pampered by women, of whom he takes advantage.  His ex-wife gets remarried and his teenaged (high school sophomore) daughter comes to visit while the ex-spouse is on honeymoon.Nick works for a large ad agency and expects to be named Creative Director, but instead the agency head (Alan Alda) hires Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) to fill the position because they need to address the women's market.  Simultaneously, Nick gets the shock of his life when he falls in a bathtub full of water with a hairdryer, resulting in his ability to hear women's thoughts.This is truly a funny situation comedy.  I would never have expected Gibson to do so well in comedy.  Helen Hunt, of course, is great.  The film has a large cast, and the director (a woman, naturally) Nancy Meyers does a superb job.

While at first he almost goes crazy, he soon learns, with the help of an odd therapist, to take advantage of the situation and improve his relationships with the various women he is in contact with.  Three women are his main targets.  Marisa Tomei is a simple sexual conquest.  Helen Hunt is the woman who became his boss.  And a quiet office worker who may need more help than anyone.Mel Gibson does an excellent job as the man with the power.  Helen Hunt does a passable job as a love interest but the script just does not show her as qualified for her new job.  She is shown as being a good advertiser but not as a Creative Director.  This is the fault of the script and not the actress.  I was a little put off by the Bette Midler character who basically convinces Mel to take advantage of women.  This is probably not really what was intended but it is what the script results in.  But still, the acting is pretty good throughout with Gibson really shining during his solo scenes.A pretty good movie for couples although the final resolution may be a little weak for couples looking for a really good romance story.

He is divorced, has a distant relationship with his teenage daughter and is only interested in what HE wants.  He expects to get a promotion in the advertising agency where he works, but instead a woman (Helen Hunt) is hired to fill the spot.  Mel decides that he will do whatever he can to undermine her and reclaim the job that he thinks is rightfully his.  He is challenged by his new boss to come up with an ad campaign for a variety of female products. Because he is so out of touch with his female side, he decides to try out some of the products.  When his daughter and her boyfriend arrive at his apartment he is decked out in pantyhose, nail polish, and a wonderbra (Braveheart in a bra?  What a concept.)  A freak accident with a hair dryer occurs, he is electrocuted, and is suddenly able to read women's minds.  As if this isn't a hard enough concept to swallow, this sudden insight into women's minds turns him into a caring, sensitive man.  He patches up his relationships with his daughter and all the women around him.  The whole idea was so far out that I had difficulty enjoying any comedy or romance which occurred.

We all know that the man's life will change because of this accident.  The concept of hearing what women think, as far-fetched as it is, is interesting.  I only wish someone could have been a little more creative with it.The movie also goes to great extremes to waste good talent.  Marisa Tomei plays a mindless woman worring about petty things.

All I can say is that Mel Gibson still has what it takes to be a leading man in a romantic comedy.The movie certainly opens promisingly enough with a hilarious sneak preview into the childhood of the main character, Nick, a top advertising agency executive that Mel Gibson plays with great aplomb. Nick is a divorced, male chauvinist who thinks that he is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, as so many men of this type are, he is dead wrong. He is just a man's man who thinks that he is a ladies' man.He begins to get his comeuppance when the coveted job of Creative Director, to which he is expecting to be promoted, is offered to someone outside the agency, another advertising whiz named Darcie, affectingly played by Helen Hunt. She gets the job, rather than he, so that the agency might be better able to  tap into the women's market. She is now his new boss, and Nick is not happy.After their first meeting, the disgruntled Nick goes home and drinks himself into a stupor. Look for the wonderful dance routine done in best Fred Astaire style. It is a charming salute to an all time great. While in his inebriated state, however, Nick has a shocking accident (pun intended) that enables him to be able to read women's minds.This ability causes him some distress, as he is amazed to find out what women really think of him, and it is not always flattering. It also enables him to please women as never before, as he is able to read their innermost thoughts and anticipate their needs. It even helps him repair his relationship with his fifteen year old daughter who is undergoing teenage angst.He uses this ability, however, to trump Darcie, unbeknownst to her, as he has every intention of getting the job he coveted. What he does not anticipate is falling in love with her. This certainly puts a kink into his plans. The question is whether love will triumph. Watch the movie and find out.The contrivance of being able to read women's minds creates some very funny scenes and interesting situations. It also allows Nick's character to grow as a person and become more three dimensional. There is a strong supporting cast that includes Delta Burke, Marisa Tomei, and an unbilled cameo by by Bette Midler. This is an engaging film that, oddly enough, is sure to delight both men and women, and Mel Gibson, with his easy going charm, is definitely what women want.",4,THE CRITICS WERE WRONG...,993772800,"06 29, 2001",2001,2470,"['movie', 'surprisingly', 'charming', 'given', 'fact', 'critics', 'pilloried', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'can', 'say', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'still', 'what', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'certainly', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'hilarious', 'sneak', 'preview', 'childhood', 'main', 'character', 'Nick', 'top', 'advertising', 'agency', 'executive', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'great', 'aplomb', 'Nick', 'divorced', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'who', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'type', 'are', 'dead', 'wrong', 'just', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'ladies', 'man.He', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'when', 'coveted', 'job', 'Creative', 'Director', 'expecting', 'be', 'promoted', 'offered', 'someone', 'agency', 'advertising', 'whiz', 'named', 'Darcie', 'affectingly', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'job', 'rather', 'so', 'agency', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'able', 'tap', 'women', 'market', 'now', 'new', 'boss', 'Nick', 'not', 'happy.After', 'first', 'meeting', 'disgruntled', 'Nick', 'home', 'drinks', 'stupor', 'Look', 'wonderful', 'dance', 'routine', 'done', 'best', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'style', 'charming', 'salute', 'time', 'great', 'inebriated', 'state', 'however', 'Nick', 'shocking', 'accident', 'pun', 'intended', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'women', 'minds.This', 'ability', 'distress', 'amazed', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'women', 'really', 'think', 'not', 'always', 'flattering', 'also', 'please', 'women', 'never', 'before', 'able', 'read', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'anticipate', 'needs', 'even', 'repair', 'relationship', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'undergoing', 'teenage', 'angst.He', 'ability', 'however', 'trump', 'Darcie', 'unbeknownst', 'intention', 'getting', 'job', 'coveted', 'What', 'not', 'anticipate', 'falling', 'love', 'certainly', 'kink', 'plans', 'question', 'love', 'will', 'triumph', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.The', 'contrivance', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'women', 'minds', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'situations', 'also', 'Nick', 'character', 'grow', 'person', 'become', 'more', 'three', 'dimensional', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'unbilled', 'cameo', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'engaging', 'film', 'oddly', 'enough', 'sure', 'delight', 'men', 'women', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'easy', 'going', 'charm', 'definitely', 'what', 'women', 'want']",N/A

I liked the film when it first came out, but I think it's aged well.  Director Nancy Meyers likes does a tremendous job putting together the talent and keeping the pace brisk. She's directed ""Something's Gotta Give"" &The Holiday.  She gets that comedy is means, but telling a good story is the end.  Nick Marshall's becoming a man who has compassion is a lovely story, well told.  Mel Gibson plays the lead character with charm, wit and moxie.  I particularly love the scene where he puts Sinatra on the phonograph and dances joyfully around the room.  The panty hose scene had me in hysterics.  In the DVD extras, Gibson comments on how Hunt is SO good that you feel that she is in the whole movie, even though her screen time is limited.  As Darcy Macguire, Hunt delivers a blockbuster, nuanced performance, comic, romantic and dazzling.  Hunt won the Oscar & Golden Globe for ""As Good as It Gets.""  In this film, I particularly like the moment where she fires Nick.  I've seen this film before, yet find myself continually surprised.  Helen Hunt raves about Marisa Tomei's performance in the film in the DVD extras.  As Lola, Tomei comes on like a whirlwind as the coffee shop girl who doesn't want to be romantically hurt.  Tomei won her Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"" and was nominated for ""In the Bedroom.""  She is superb.Smaller roles also offer strong support.  Alan Alda plays the head of the advertising agency, Dan Wanamaker.  Alda got his Oscar nomination forThe Aviator.  His brief screen appearances are filled with energy.  Mark Feuerstein who was in ""Defiance"" plays Nick's coworker Morgan Farwell.  Bette Midler has a cameo as Nick's psychiatrist.  Delta Burke plays Eve and Valerie Perrine plays Margo, Marshall's office assists.  They have one of the great gags of the film when Nick tries to read their minds, but no thoughts are going on.  Ashley Johnson from TV's ""Growing Pains"" plays Nick's daughter.  His increasingly close relationship with her is another heartwarming element that makes this film worth revisiting.  Lauren Holly from ""Ace Ventura"" has a brief cameo as Ashley's mother Gigi.  Judy Greer from ""27 Dresses"" &The Amateurshas a moving role as the shy office girl Erin who thinks of ending her life.  ""What Women Want"" is a great film because it is life affirming, showing us that understanding and compassion never fall out of fashion.

Helen Hunt plays Gibson's boss, and she's so sweet and helpless you wonder how she ever got to be a tea-lady,let alone a top executive in a ruthless business like advertising.  Gibson stitches her up by stealing her ideas, and naturally she can't do a thing to help herself, poor little thing, until he takes pity on her.

533051,A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B00003CXQR,"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!""","[2, 4]","I have a confession to make. I am a dyed in the wool Mel Gibson fan, and I have been since Mad Max. Okay, despite hating most mainstream movies with everything from Adam Sandler to Joel Schumacher making me nauseous beyond compare, I like movies like this. However, I usually make an effort to see most Gibson movies, with the Lethal Weapon series being at the top of the heap. So my natural aversion to the so-called `chick flick' kicked it when my wife suggested we watch `What Women Want' on pay per view. This is a good movie.Nick Marshall (Gibson) is an misogynist advertising executive at Sloan-Curtis, the women he works with despise him for it, and who finds himself turned down for the top marketing job at his firm when it's given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt...okay, okay, I like her, too!), who is everything to advertising that Nick isn't. And now she has the job that he feels he should have had. And when she announces that the company is missing out on billions of dollars of advertising revenue from women, Nick decides to prove to her that he knows what women want. He does this by waxing his legs, wearing nylons, wearing nail polish in one of the funniest scenes as he all but kills himself in the process. The waxing agony leads to accident that causes him to fall into the bathtub and electrocutes himself with a hair dryer. Being electrocuted in Chicago gives misogynist advertising executives receptive telepathy.He can hear what women are thinking and this unnerves him. In fact it scares the hell out of him. If the strangers on the way to work was bad, he just isn't prepared for the barrage of hatred from his female coworkers. He goes to see Bette Midler who plays a marriage councillor, who also hates him. He lays it out for her, he knows what women are thinking, then proves it. She explains that he has a gift, and if he knows what women want, he can rule. He begins to play a game- learning how and what women think and using it to get the better of them. All of them, including his estranged daughter. Effortlessly, by listening to their thoughts then formulating his responses based on that, he quickly becomes their best friend, confident and go-to man for advice. He also begins undercutting Darcy's position with their boss. He also notices Erin, an intern who feels that no one notices her and wonders if anyone would notice if she just killed herself.Things start to fall apart for Nick when he realizes that he cares for Darcy, becomes closer with his daughter and even ingratiates himself to most of the female staff at Sloan-Curtis, even Erin. Nick wants to succeed and get the job that Darcy has, but can't change the fact that he's falling for her big time. She's sweet, honest, down to earth- all the things he hates in women, and she's hooked him. Despite being selfishly motivated, Marshall gets more than he bargained for. `What Women Want' is hilarious, but it's also got some messages that it subtly gets across. Maybe if we said good-bye collectively to the games and [stuff] we play between each other, then perhaps we could get down to what's really important.",4,What Men Get,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,3115,"['have', 'confession', 'make', 'am', 'dyed', 'wool', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Okay', 'hating', 'most', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'everything', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'making', 'nauseous', 'compare', 'like', 'movies', 'However', 'usually', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'most', 'Gibson', 'movies', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'being', 'top', 'heap', 'natural', 'aversion', 'so-called', 'chick', 'flick', 'kicked', 'when', 'wife', 'suggested', 'watch', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'pay', 'view', 'good', 'movie.Nick', 'Marshall', 'Gibson', 'misogynist', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Sloan-Curtis', 'women', 'despise', 'who', 'turned', 'down', 'top', 'marketing', 'job', 'firm', 'when', 'given', 'Darcy', 'McGuire', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'okay', 'okay', 'like', 'too', 'who', 'everything', 'advertising', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'now', 'job', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'when', 'company', 'missing', 'out', 'billions', 'dollars', 'advertising', 'revenue', 'women', 'Nick', 'prove', 'what', 'women', 'want', 'waxing', 'legs', 'wearing', 'nylons', 'wearing', 'nail', 'polish', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'process', 'waxing', 'agony', 'accident', 'fall', 'bathtub', 'hair', 'dryer', 'Being', 'electrocuted', 'Chicago', 'misogynist', 'advertising', 'executives', 'receptive', 'telepathy.He', 'can', 'hear', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'thinking', 'fact', 'hell', 'strangers', 'way', 'work', 'was', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'barrage', 'hatred', 'female', 'coworkers', 'see', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'who', 'marriage', 'councillor', 'who', 'also', 'out', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'thinking', 'then', 'gift', 'what', 'women', 'want', 'can', 'rule', 'play', 'game-', 'learning', 'how', 'what', 'women', 'think', 'using', 'get', 'better', 'including', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Effortlessly', 'listening', 'thoughts', 'then', 'formulating', 'responses', 'based', 'quickly', 'best', 'friend', 'confident', 'go-to', 'man', 'advice', 'also', 'undercutting', 'Darcy', 'position', 'boss', 'also', 'Erin', 'intern', 'who', 'one', 'wonders', 'anyone', 'would', 'notice', 'just', 'killed', 'herself.Things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'Nick', 'when', 'Darcy', 'closer', 'daughter', 'even', 'most', 'female', 'staff', 'Sloan-Curtis', 'even', 'Erin', 'Nick', 'succeed', 'get', 'job', 'Darcy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'falling', 'big', 'time', 'sweet', 'honest', 'down', 'earth-', 'things', 'women', 'hooked', 'being', 'selfishly', 'motivated', 'Marshall', 'more', 'bargained', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'hilarious', 'also', 'got', 'messages', 'subtly', 'Maybe', 'said', 'good-bye', 'collectively', 'games', '[', 'stuff', ']', 'play', 'other', 'then', 'perhaps', 'could', 'get', 'down', 'what', 'really', 'important']",N/A

533055,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXQR,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","I didn't like What Women Want very much, but it's only fair to say that this boxoffice hit entertained a lot of moviegoers, as well as a number of critics. Sometimes a reviewer, like anybody else, finds himself at odds with the majority. Because my opinions are published months after a movie's initial release, I at least know when mine is a minority voice.What Women Want is a satirical romantic comedy about a guy named Nick [Mel Gibson] who discovers he can read women's minds. This occurs after a night during which Nick, attired in panty hose, slips and falls, along with the hairdryer he is holding, into a bathtub full of water. [You'll have to see the movie to find out why he is dressed the way he is.] Stunned by a mighty electric shock, he passes out. His new psychic ability is revealed to him the following morning.Nick is a hot commodity at a big advertising agency. He is quite the charmer, but he treats women like objects. Now that he can hear their thoughts, however, he learns that - surprise! - many women are rational, intelligent beings. He quickly learns that his ex-wife thinks he's an idiot, his daughter thinks he is a lousy father, and at work, the girls' opinions range from indifference to outrage. To make matters worse, his new boss, Darcy [Helen Hunt], now has the position he thinks he should have been given. People rarely change overnight, so the conniving Nick decides to use his new talent to his own advantage. He will use it to seduce women and to get Darcy's job by artfully stealing her ideas and making them his own. Too bad for Nick that he also finds Darcy so attractive.What Women Want is Gibson's first romantic comedy in nearly a decade. Ms. Hunt had a much better role as a woman who reforms a man in As Good as it Gets. Marisa Tomei and Bette Midler are very effective in small parts. The best character is Nick's daughter Alexandra, who is undergoing major teen angst. Ashley Johnson does a remarkable job of playing her.Why did I have problems with the movie? In part, it's because producer and director Nancy Myers, whose work [Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, I Love Trouble] I've never cared much for, is in charge of a story idea that seems to be too clever for her abilities. Also, with a woman at the helm, you might expect that the female characters would think some interesting thoughts. Sadly, what these women have on their minds is so stereotypical and mundane that we wind up learning nothing new about what women want. Certainly some of the thoughts are hysterically funny, but I anticipated at least one or two fresh insights. Lastly, What Women Want is way too long. There is a silly pseudo-Freudian flashback used to explain why Nick is the way he is with women. It's unnecessary and pointless, as is a subplot concerning Nick and a female file clerk who thinks everyone ignores her. These scenes take up twenty minutes, explain nothing, and worst of all, aren't the least bit funny. Of course, several million viewers might disagree with me.",2,Star power can't save romanitc comedy,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,3015,"['did', ""n't"", 'like', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'fair', 'say', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'entertained', 'lot', 'moviegoers', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'critics', 'Sometimes', 'reviewer', 'anybody', 'else', 'odds', 'majority', 'opinions', 'are', 'published', 'months', 'movie', 'initial', 'release', 'least', 'know', 'when', 'mine', 'minority', 'Women', 'Want', 'satirical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guy', 'named', 'Nick', '[', 'Mel', 'Gibson', ']', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'women', 'minds', 'night', 'Nick', 'attired', 'panty', 'hose', 'slips', 'falls', 'hairdryer', 'holding', 'bathtub', 'full', 'water', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'dressed', 'way', ']', 'Stunned', 'mighty', 'electric', 'shock', 'out', 'new', 'psychic', 'ability', 'revealed', 'following', 'morning.Nick', 'hot', 'commodity', 'big', 'advertising', 'agency', 'quite', 'charmer', 'women', 'objects', 'Now', 'can', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'however', 'surprise', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'rational', 'intelligent', 'beings', 'quickly', 'ex-wife', 'thinks', 'idiot', 'daughter', 'lousy', 'father', 'work', 'girls', 'opinions', 'range', 'indifference', 'outrage', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'new', 'boss', 'Darcy', '[', 'Helen', 'Hunt', ']', 'now', 'position', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'People', 'rarely', 'change', 'overnight', 'conniving', 'Nick', 'use', 'new', 'talent', 'own', 'advantage', 'will', 'use', 'seduce', 'women', 'get', 'Darcy', 'job', 'artfully', 'stealing', 'ideas', 'making', 'own', 'Too', 'bad', 'Nick', 'also', 'Darcy', 'so', 'attractive.What', 'Women', 'Want', 'Gibson', 'first', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nearly', 'decade', 'Ms.', 'Hunt', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'As', 'Good', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'small', 'parts', 'best', 'character', 'Nick', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'who', 'undergoing', 'major', 'teen', 'angst', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'remarkable', 'job', 'playing', 'her.Why', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'movie', 'part', 'producer', 'director', 'Nancy', 'Myers', 'work', '[', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'Love', 'Trouble', ']', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'much', 'charge', 'story', 'idea', 'be', 'too', 'clever', 'abilities', 'Also', 'woman', 'helm', 'might', 'expect', 'female', 'characters', 'would', 'think', 'interesting', 'thoughts', 'Sadly', 'what', 'women', 'have', 'minds', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'mundane', 'wind', 'up', 'learning', 'nothing', 'new', 'what', 'women', 'want', 'Certainly', 'thoughts', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'anticipated', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'fresh', 'insights', 'Lastly', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'silly', 'pseudo-Freudian', 'flashback', 'used', 'explain', 'why', 'Nick', 'way', 'women', 'unnecessary', 'pointless', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'Nick', 'female', 'file', 'clerk', 'who', 'everyone', 'scenes', 'take', 'up', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'explain', 'nothing', 'worst', 'are', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'funny', 'course', 'several', 'million', 'viewers', 'might', 'disagree']",N/A

It starts off on a high, goes right down about an hour into the film, and then goes back up, but never goes up quite as high as the beginning.Mel Gibson is great as Nick, although you can see he's really beginning to lose his looks - the shopping bags under his eyes really began to distract me. Up against Helen Hunt, who positively shines, Mel Gibson has really met his match.

Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.

533068,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00003CXQR,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[0, 0]","First off let me say that I've always liked Mel Gibson ever since I saw Gallipolli. I loved The Year Of Living Dangerously, Maverick, Ransom, the Lethal Weapon series, Conspiracy Theory, even some of his less successful movies such as Mrs Soffel, The Bounty, Hamlet and The River. I think he is a fine, often underused and under-rated actor. I also really like Helen Hunt. However, this is the point where I say BUT (and this is the point where most people reading this review will move to the bottom of my review and click on no) I think this is up there with Air America as one of the worst movies Mel Gibson has ever made. I just thought it was dull, uninspired, unimaginative and worse still, clich&eacute;d.If you want a movie that perpetuates the myth that all men are male chauvinist pigs (I thought that idea went out with the 80's)then this is the one for you. Mel Gibson who regularly tops polls as the man all women want, stars here as an advertising executive (Nick) in this unimaginative, high concept low inteliigence movie about a man who can hear what women are thinking and discovers they don't all love him as much as he believed.Essentially this is a romantic comedy with the plot centring around Nick's attempts to undermine his new boss (Helen Hunt) when she gets the job and the promotion he thought were his. Using his ability to read her thoughts, he steals her ideas and just as his plan is beginning to work, would you believe it he falls in love with her and develops a conscience? Not exactly the most inspired, original or imaginative plot twist me thinks.To my mind this was a movie with a good premise and it could have been a good movie had they avoided the schmaltz and the stereotypes. They didn't. It's not all bad though, Mel Gibson is his usual charming self and Helen Hunt makes a sympathetic, intelligent and attractive love interest, even if the lighting throughout this movie does her no favours. The movie does have some good moments but if you've seen the promotional ad's you've pretty much seen all the best bits. I hope this review doesn't come over as a male taking offence to a bit of male bashing.

At firs he abuses this newfound power to bed them, but soon figures out how to help women with their problems.

533082,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXQR,Reviewer,"[5, 5]","Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call ""What Women Want,"" directed by Nancy Meyers, ""just"" a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well.  Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the ""fluff"" piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the ""cute"" stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of ""Friends.""  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on ""A Christmas Carol,"" with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life.  The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the ""Man's man"" he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat ""overly"" established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, ""All right I get it!"" Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice.  Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the ""Man's man"" theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength--  and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film.  And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the ""Tiny Tim"" role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by ""What Women Want,"" you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.

I watched this movie, and how I missed the old Mel, the funny Mel, the guy who could laugh at himself.What Women Want is a battle of the sexes movie, but its also a very funny movie about the change that came to advertising when the retail world woke up and realized that women really did control a whole lot of the money.  What to do? What to do?  Things had progressed beyond Mad Men, of course but agencies still had a whole lot of men sitting around trying to imagine what women wanted--instead of hiring them to handle the problem.In What Women Want, one dinosaur of a man, Mel Gibson (yeah, I know)  gets to hear what is going on in women's heads.  Its quite a shock because even though this guy has lived a charmed life--he never suspected that so many of the women around him were thinking that he was a Class A jerk.  Furthermore, he found he deserved it.  Gibson doesn't turn into Mister-Sensitive-Man but he does begin to understand that the opposite sex seems to be made up of human beings.  And he is really really funny as he finds out.Helen Hunt is great in this movie, but there are lots and lots of well known actresses in small roles.

533086,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXQR,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2  In &#65533;What Women Want,&#65533; Mel Gibson plays an ad exec so misogynistic in his outlook that he makes Henry Higgins look like Richard Simmons.  A confirmed bachelor, he basically sees women as little more than sex objects to be wooed, made love to and discarded at his own convenience and pleasure.  Suddenly one day a freak accident occurs, allowing Nick the ability to overhear what women are thinking.  First he is stunned to discover that many of the women around him find him to be a crass, obnoxious male chauvinist.  Then he realizes that knowing what women want beforehand might come in very handy in helping him in his conquests.  Finally, he comes to empathize with the struggles women face in their lives, particularly having to deal with boorish oafs like him.Like most movies based on a gimmick, &#65533;What Women Want&#65533; offers both good and bad elements in about equal measure.  On the positive side, the gimmick itself is a clever one &#65533; as long as it remains fresh that is.  It&#65533;s fun watching Nick get his comeuppance as he comes to learn that what he thinks is attractive behavior to women is actually the very thing that turns many of them off.  However, as is usually the case in these films, the gimmick eventually begins to wear thin, and when Nick starts going the reform route, becoming, in effect, a &#65533;sensitive man,&#65533; the film loses its satirical bite and becomes soft and squishy.  (Actually, this theme was explored to much sharper and more hilarious effect in &#65533;Tootsie&#65533; almost 20 years ago).  This kind of plotting was a staple in the TV series &#65533;Bewitched,&#65533; but there it was forced to wrap itself up in less than 30 minutes, thus avoiding the problem of diminishing returns.  This film, which runs a needlessly long 126 minutes, ends up exhausting the possibilities of the premise quite early on.  We always know where the story is headed so we simply wait around for the events to play themselves out.  Moreover, the filmmakers want to cover far more ground than they are able to in one film.  Time and again, we find ourselves deflected from the core element of the film &#65533; Nick&#65533;s romance with a fellow advertiser played by the always wonderful Helen Hunt &#65533; by side forays involving his teenaged daughter, a coffee shop employee, and even a suicidal clerk at his office.  I suppose this is an admirable attempt to give a fuller dimension to Nick&#65533;s life and character, but the strands are never very fully developed and they end up attenuating the romance at the film&#65533;s core.Gibson does a very fine job parodying his macho tough-guy image and Helen Hunt brings her unique glow to a woman who, though she finds herself at the top of the corporate world, still yearns for the peace and serenity that only a life of casual simplicity can bring.  In an amusing casting coup, Alan Alda, long associated with &#65533;sensitive man&#65533; roles in the 1970&#65533;s and &#65533;80&#65533;s, appears as Nick&#65533;s boss.&#65533;What Women Want&#65533; offers some excellent performances and a few funny moments &#65533; but the limitations imposed on it by its gimmicky nature ultimately do it in.",2,uneven and a bit stretched out,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,3229,"['**1/2', '65533', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '65533', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'ad', 'exec', 'so', 'misogynistic', 'outlook', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'look', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'A', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'basically', 'women', 'little', 'more', 'sex', 'objects', 'be', 'wooed', 'made', 'love', 'discarded', 'own', 'convenience', 'pleasure', 'Suddenly', 'one', 'day', 'freak', 'accident', 'occurs', 'allowing', 'Nick', 'ability', 'overhear', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'thinking', 'First', 'stunned', 'discover', 'many', 'women', 'find', 'be', 'crass', 'obnoxious', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'Then', 'knowing', 'what', 'women', 'want', 'beforehand', 'might', 'come', 'very', 'handy', 'helping', 'conquests', 'Finally', 'empathize', 'struggles', 'women', 'face', 'lives', 'particularly', 'having', 'deal', 'boorish', 'oafs', 'him.Like', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'gimmick', '65533', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '65533', 'offers', 'good', 'bad', 'elements', 'about', 'equal', 'measure', 'positive', 'side', 'gimmick', 'clever', 'one', '65533', 'as', 'long', 'fresh', '65533', 's', 'fun', 'watching', 'Nick', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'learn', 'what', 'attractive', 'behavior', 'women', 'actually', 'very', 'thing', 'many', 'off', 'However', 'usually', 'case', 'films', 'gimmick', 'eventually', 'wear', 'thin', 'when', 'Nick', 'going', 'reform', 'route', 'becoming', 'effect', '65533', 'sensitive', 'man', '65533', 'film', 'satirical', 'bite', 'soft', 'squishy', 'Actually', 'theme', 'was', 'explored', 'much', 'sharper', 'more', 'hilarious', 'effect', '65533', 'Tootsie', '65533', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'kind', 'plotting', 'was', 'staple', 'TV', 'series', '65533', 'Bewitched', '65533', 'was', 'forced', 'wrap', 'up', 'less', '30', 'minutes', 'thus', 'avoiding', 'problem', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'film', 'needlessly', 'long', '126', 'minutes', 'up', 'exhausting', 'possibilities', 'premise', 'quite', 'early', 'always', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'headed', 'so', 'simply', 'wait', 'around', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'Moreover', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'cover', 'far', 'more', 'ground', 'are', 'able', 'one', 'film', 'Time', 'again', 'find', 'deflected', 'core', 'element', 'film', '65533', 'Nick', '65533', 's', 'romance', 'fellow', 'advertiser', 'played', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Helen', 'Hunt', '65533', 'side', 'forays', 'involving', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'coffee', 'shop', 'employee', 'even', 'suicidal', 'clerk', 'office', 'suppose', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'give', 'fuller', 'dimension', 'Nick', '65533', 's', 'life', 'character', 'strands', 'are', 'never', 'very', 'fully', 'developed', 'end', 'up', 'attenuating', 'romance', 'film', '65533', 's', 'core.Gibson', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'parodying', 'macho', 'tough-guy', 'image', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'unique', 'glow', 'woman', 'who', 'top', 'corporate', 'world', 'still', 'peace', 'serenity', 'only', 'life', 'casual', 'simplicity', 'can', 'bring', 'amusing', 'casting', 'coup', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'long', 'associated', '65533', 'sensitive', 'man', '65533', 'roles', '1970', '65533', 's', '65533', '80', '65533', 's', 'Nick', '65533', 'boss.', '65533', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '65533', 'excellent', 'performances', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', '65533', 'limitations', 'imposed', 'gimmicky', 'nature', 'ultimately', 'do']",N/A

533091,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00003CXQR,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[1, 1]","Movie Summary:  Man's man Nick Marshall doesn't understand women. Oh like all men he thinks he does, but he doesn't. Nick's life isn't so hot. He's never had a good relationship with any of the women in his life including his 15 year old daughter. But Nick Marshall is going to get the opportunity to change all that. One evening while waxing his legs, trying out mascara and hair mouse, Nick gets the shock of his life. He wakes up with the ability to hear women's thoughts. Now Nick can either learn from his new gift, or use it for his own selfish reasons.My Opinion:  This movie looks so good. The premise of Mel Gibson hearing the thoughts of women is really intriguing. The trailers are awesome. It's even really funny and interesting in the film. Until they have to wrap everything up and end the movie. That's when everything falls apart. The ending is terribly weak. It steals all the energy and laughter that it had going up until that point. It takes what should have been a really fun and entertaining movie and leaves it flat. It's still very much worth seeing once, but it could very easily have been lots better; a classic even.

533092,A3FTUUMASW740H,B00003CXQR,"Shawna ""story lover""","[0, 0]","This is an interesting, entertaining movie that DOES show what woman think or imagine.  On one side it's what we imagine and on the other it's about what we want.  We imagine single men alone in their apartment with a glass of wine entertaining themselves and perhaps musing that they are still single and congratulating themselves that they have avoided the commitment trap and still get what they want.Mel does a sexy dance with grace.  I was quite surprised that this hard playing action character displayed a vulnerable side.  You will laugh at seeing him in womans nylons in the bathroom while he's trying to figure woman out.This had to be directed by a woman because I can't see any man actually displaying that sort of depth that does not exist outside of baseball or action films.  Which is one of the points of the film.  He gets to a point where he is more in tuned with his feminine side and avoids more of the hard hitting action on tv. (he does a great impression of Sean Connery)You often hear men grumbling that they wish they knew what women wanted.  The director gives him and the audience a chance by providing a stream of outspoken thoughts, worries, fear, happiness by women and showing their reactions to being discovered.  Mel was so amazed by what women thought that he drenched himself in a room full of women just to get their perspective.  It was very new to him.  Bette Midler's character took the opportunity.  She became more himself when she realized Mel could hear her thoughts.  A psychiatrist having a toke.  I wonder how many women would be different if men could hear our thoughts.  And isn't Mel Gibson worth wanting.  ;-)I highly recommend this movie if you are open to looking at both sides and what men can do about vulnerability.",4,male/female,989193600,"05 7, 2001",2001,1770,"['interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'show', 'what', 'woman', 'think', 'imagine', 'one', 'side', 'what', 'imagine', 'other', 'what', 'want', 'imagine', 'single', 'men', 'alone', 'apartment', 'glass', 'wine', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'musing', 'are', 'still', 'single', 'congratulating', 'have', 'avoided', 'commitment', 'trap', 'still', 'get', 'what', 'want.Mel', 'sexy', 'dance', 'grace', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'hard', 'playing', 'action', 'character', 'displayed', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'will', 'laugh', 'seeing', 'womans', 'nylons', 'bathroom', 'trying', 'figure', 'woman', 'out.This', 'had', 'be', 'directed', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'man', 'actually', 'displaying', 'sort', 'depth', 'not', 'exist', 'baseball', 'action', 'films', 'Which', 'one', 'points', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'more', 'tuned', 'feminine', 'side', 'avoids', 'more', 'hard', 'hitting', 'action', 'tv', 'great', 'impression', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'often', 'hear', 'men', 'grumbling', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'women', 'wanted', 'director', 'audience', 'chance', 'providing', 'stream', 'outspoken', 'thoughts', 'worries', 'fear', 'happiness', 'women', 'showing', 'reactions', 'being', 'discovered', 'Mel', 'was', 'so', 'amazed', 'what', 'women', 'thought', 'drenched', 'room', 'full', 'women', 'just', 'get', 'perspective', 'was', 'very', 'new', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'character', 'took', 'opportunity', 'became', 'more', 'when', 'realized', 'Mel', 'could', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'psychiatrist', 'having', 'toke', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'men', 'could', 'hear', 'thoughts', ""n't"", 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'wanting', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'open', 'looking', 'sides', 'what', 'men', 'can', 'do', 'vulnerability']",N/A

I am the type who likes some mysteries, romantic comedies, cute little movies that entertain me but that do not make me think too much.  This movie accomplished just that.I enjoyed watching Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson side by side as they had the kind of chemistry to make a romance feasible.  Mel Gibson's character starts out as the typical ladies man who uses all kinds of lines to get women into bed with him and thinks that he is god's gift to women.  After a life changing experience, he is able to actually hear what women are thinking and it leads him to realize that every woman doesn't want him.  It makes him a little more sensitive in some situations, although he uses this newfound ability to manipulate his new boss.I actually found myself laughing out loud at this cute little movie, but it may be funnier when rented on video/DVD.

533094,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00003CXQR,Stephen A. Haines,"[2, 3]","A prime example of how good casting can redeem an insipid plot idea.  Mel Gibson is a senior executive in an advertising agency.  Not senior enough for his ambitions, however.  He aims for a loftier position, but is displaced by a new arrival pirated from another agency.  Helen Hunt enters with all the conflicting emotions of the new hire but seasoned professional.  Hunt perfectly assumes the stereotyped role of today's woman manager.  She's lovely, she's assertive, she's vulnerable, but keeps it hidden, and, of course, she's recently divorced.  Her assumption of the Director's post reflects the agency's need to reach the women's market.  Gibson is unable to achieve that because he's more interested in bedding women than selling to them.  He's not aware of what women want.His awareness expands with a jolt - an electric jolt that provides him with the ability to receive women's thoughts [Do women really operate on a different mental wavelength?  A dangerous proposition to consider these days.].  Confused with the inundation of information, often about himself, Gibson turns his new abilities to discredit Hunt.  Corporate ambition knows no limits and he undercuts her role using this rather blunt instrument.  His own emotions crowd his intent to gain the Directorship, however.  This is inevitable in a romantic fantasy-comedy.  The finale is also inevitable, but carried off with the panache Hunt and Gibson bring to this story.There's little novelty in this film, but the stunning performances overcome that limitation.  Besides Gibson, who can assume nearly any role cloak and Hunt, whose abilities almost transcend criticism, the film is nearly stolen away by Ashley Johnson.  As Gibson's teenage daughter, she parachutes into his already complicated life while her mother honeymoons. The father-daughter conflicts and stresses parade through the film, but Johnson brings a special, subtle sensitivity to the role.  Alan Alda as the ad agency's president was an interesting choice.  He conveys a sense of dignity that another actor might fail to impart.This film is worth a view, if for no other reason than seeing Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson in yet another guise.  Whether it's worth repetitive watching is another question.  Unless you're a die-hard Gibson or Hunt fan, once may be enough.  Johnson may be an actress to watch and future roles may suggest coming back to this one as she develops.  At this point, a single viewing was enough.",4,Shocking revelation,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2460,"['prime', 'example', 'how', 'good', 'casting', 'can', 'redeem', 'insipid', 'plot', 'idea', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'senior', 'executive', 'advertising', 'agency', 'Not', 'senior', 'enough', 'ambitions', 'however', 'loftier', 'position', 'displaced', 'new', 'arrival', 'pirated', 'agency', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'enters', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'new', 'hire', 'seasoned', 'professional', 'Hunt', 'perfectly', 'stereotyped', 'role', 'today', 'woman', 'manager', 'lovely', 'assertive', 'vulnerable', 'hidden', 'course', 'recently', 'divorced', 'assumption', 'Director', 'post', 'agency', 'need', 'reach', 'women', 'market', 'Gibson', 'unable', 'achieve', 'more', 'interested', 'bedding', 'women', 'selling', 'not', 'aware', 'what', 'women', 'want.His', 'awareness', 'expands', 'jolt', 'electric', 'jolt', 'ability', 'receive', 'women', 'thoughts', '[', 'Do', 'women', 'really', 'operate', 'different', 'mental', 'wavelength', 'dangerous', 'proposition', 'consider', 'days.', ']', 'Confused', 'inundation', 'information', 'often', 'Gibson', 'new', 'abilities', 'discredit', 'Hunt', 'Corporate', 'ambition', 'limits', 'role', 'using', 'rather', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'own', 'emotions', 'crowd', 'intent', 'gain', 'Directorship', 'however', 'inevitable', 'romantic', 'fantasy-comedy', 'finale', 'also', 'inevitable', 'carried', 'panache', 'Hunt', 'Gibson', 'bring', 'little', 'novelty', 'film', 'stunning', 'performances', 'overcome', 'limitation', 'Gibson', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'nearly', 'role', 'cloak', 'Hunt', 'abilities', 'almost', 'transcend', 'criticism', 'film', 'nearly', 'stolen', 'away', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'Gibson', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'already', 'complicated', 'life', 'mother', 'honeymoons', 'father-daughter', 'conflicts', 'stresses', 'parade', 'film', 'Johnson', 'special', 'subtle', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'ad', 'agency', 'president', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'conveys', 'sense', 'dignity', 'actor', 'might', 'fail', 'impart.This', 'film', 'view', 'other', 'reason', 'seeing', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'yet', 'guise', 'worth', 'repetitive', 'watching', 'question', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Gibson', 'Hunt', 'fan', 'once', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'Johnson', 'may', 'be', 'actress', 'watch', 'future', 'roles', 'may', 'suggest', 'coming', 'back', 'one', 'point', 'single', 'viewing', 'was', 'enough']",N/A

It is so good I got completely absorbed in it and could not suspend my attention at all !!! First of all, the cast is fantastic, especially Mel Gibson and Helen Hunter, both of them at their very best, absolutely fabulous !!! Helen Hunt is really perfect in the role of the highly successful career woman, yet so very inspiring, so very sincere, so very deeply feminine, and so moving. Then all the emotion, all the ideas contained in this movie are absolutely great and to the point. Finally, the story itself is interesting. The whole movie is really nice entertainment. It is also fast-paced, very dense, full of humor, and it is also a movie about truth versus illusion, truth against wrong. On top of all that, it is also a very deep and very rich movie, and it raises plenty of questions, and not only the easy ""Are women really superior to men ?"". The beginning of the movie is great, with Nick (Mel Gibson) born and raised in Las Vegas, among many women. As an adult, he is a kind of excited extrovert executive who is divorcing real-time ; Darcy (Helen Hunter) is a wonderful, newly appointed Product Manager in his company, and she puts the focus on female customers. She organizes a fantastic brainstorming session and gives samples of women's products to all the participants: lipstick, bath beads, panty hose, depilatory wax etc.  After that, Nick tries all the products that Darcy distributed during the meeting; he wants to know what a ""broad"" feels, and distributes common sense remarks...  One of the best scenes of the movie is when Darcy brings Nick into her wonderful state house. Then there is another great scene when Nick gets to his daughter during a party; she is so upset she hides in the toilets.  Helen Hunt is great, dazzling and the final kiss is absolutely wonderful. Like the whole movie, this scene is very rich in messsages. Finally the movie ends to the music of ""Night and Day""...The movie contains great sentences like: ""men, not women, suffer from penis envy"", ""no games, just sport"", etc. The music is great, carefully selected and plays at the proper time. However, the original English version is much better than the french translation, which is not always properly conveying all the ideas and feelings.",5,"Excellent, perfect, fabulous !!!

I believe that I think clearly, that is, in real sentences and coherent sequence of thoughts only rarely, and only when I am alone - driving or walking outside.

My thoughts are even harder to categorize when I am in the middle of a conversation with another person. I do not have coherent thoughts coming in long clear sentences but something which is more like images, notes I make to myself about the other person, short words.

However, this very long preface only leads to what I really want to say: I understand that this movie has several flaws, amongst which the way ""thinking"" (a central theme in the movie) is presented, but in spite of this and other flaws and the light easy nature of the movie, it is very entertaining and is able to touch, several quite serious subjects. My best part actually is when the male character, played by Mel Gibson talks about what he learned about women. ""They worry all the time..."", he says, and this sentence alone is worth watching the movie. Oh so true and such a real (very satisfying) moment.Story is a little banal with all the right elements falling down at the right moment with our hero learning his lesson and being at the right place to save the day -- however men women relationship at the workplace are very nicely presented, all stereotypes included  (I loved the moment when Mel Gibson looks at his two secretaries and asks ""that's all""? after he gets no reaction from their brain.Bette  Midler is hilarious in a small psychologist part that does justice to her comic abilities.",4,Several real important moments in this comedy,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,2089,"['Did', 'ever', 'take', 'time', 'think', 'way', 'think', 'believe', 'think', 'clearly', 'real', 'sentences', 'coherent', 'sequence', 'thoughts', 'only', 'rarely', 'only', 'when', 'am', 'alone', 'driving', 'walking', 'Even', 'then', 'mind', 'jumps', 'one', 'association', 'like', 'crazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'bother', 'always', 'verbalize', 'thoughts', 'do', 'only', 'when', 'think', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'someone', 'thoughts', 'are', 'even', 'harder', 'categorize', 'when', 'am', 'middle', 'conversation', 'person', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'coherent', 'thoughts', 'coming', 'long', 'clear', 'sentences', 'something', 'more', 'images', 'notes', 'make', 'myself', 'other', 'person', 'short', 'words', 'am', 'therefore', 'quite', 'sure', 'mind', 'other', 'people', 'mind', 'matter', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'presented', 'movie', 'more', 'disorganized', 'sack', 'lots', 'items', 'most', 'irrelevant', 'subject', 'matter', 'main', 'idea', 'movie', 'little', 'wrong', 'However', 'very', 'long', 'preface', 'only', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'say', 'understand', 'movie', 'several', 'flaws', 'amongst', 'way', 'thinking', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'presented', 'spite', 'other', 'flaws', 'light', 'easy', 'nature', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'able', 'touch', 'several', 'quite', 'serious', 'subjects', 'best', 'part', 'actually', 'when', 'male', 'character', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'talks', 'what', 'learned', 'women', 'worry', 'time', 'sentence', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'Oh', 'so', 'true', 'such', 'real', 'very', 'satisfying', 'moment.Story', 'little', 'banal', 'right', 'elements', 'falling', 'down', 'right', 'moment', 'hero', 'learning', 'lesson', 'being', 'right', 'place', 'save', 'day', 'however', 'men', 'women', 'relationship', 'workplace', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'presented', 'stereotypes', 'included', 'loved', 'moment', 'when', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'two', 'secretaries', 'reaction', 'brain.Bette', 'Midler', 'hilarious', 'small', 'psychologist', 'part', 'justice', 'comic', 'abilities']",N/A

Sir Baio acquires a psychic mind-over-matter capability (i.e. he can blink like Jeanie) and how does he use his powers? Solving world hunger? Saving lives in surgery? Nope, he pops girls blouses off, and the film was shallow enough to spare us the burden of how a real girl would be humiliated, and cry alone in her room while her parents anguished over what was wrong.Was this movie to be Zapped II?It was clear early on that something delightful was in store due to the production values, and the subtle almost unnoticeable artful rocking of the camera. The supporting cast was excellent. I mean REALLY excellent.Mel Gibson initially is definitely a microwave-quick, get-to-the-point, predatory male. Every nuance of the character paints that picture.When he acquires his Big Trick, the film gets somewhat annoying. In hindsight I think it was smart to annoy the audience at that part of the film since it's clearly a plot twist that is disturbing to the character.With his new powers, Nick (Mel's character) first tries to use them in a predatory way. This didn't work, and as the film progresses he uses his powers in another way. SWITCHING TACTICS! A character is THINKING if they switch tactics. It is very enjoyable to watch a film with believable characters who come across as &quot;thinking&quot;.Also, Nick becomes more of an emotion-based decider, and his mannerisms clearly display that. I have to equate the believability of his new mannerisms with Dustin Hoffman's character growth in Kramer vs Kramer. Further, as Nick understands women better, he exudes a Tom Hanks-like empathy that is very likeable. (Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks in the same paragraph. Mel really shines in this movie.)I would have done this and that scene a little differently, and this film isn't the end-all best film ever made, but when it was over I had this good feeling, happy I had watched it.I would call this movie a smart romantic comedy and highly recommend it.",5,A film that considers its audience to be intelligent,989366400,"05 9, 2001",2001,2074,"['bought', 'film', 'little', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'Anybody', 'remember', 'film', 'quot', 'Zapped', 'quot', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'Sir', 'Baio', 'psychic', 'mind-over-matter', 'capability', 'i.e', 'can', 'blink', 'Jeanie', 'how', 'use', 'powers', 'Solving', 'world', 'hunger', 'Saving', 'lives', 'surgery', 'Nope', 'girls', 'blouses', 'film', 'was', 'shallow', 'enough', 'spare', 'burden', 'how', 'real', 'girl', 'would', 'be', 'humiliated', 'cry', 'alone', 'room', 'parents', 'anguished', 'what', 'was', 'wrong.Was', 'movie', 'be', 'Zapped', 'II', 'was', 'clear', 'early', 'something', 'delightful', 'was', 'store', 'due', 'production', 'values', 'subtle', 'almost', 'unnoticeable', 'artful', 'rocking', 'camera', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'mean', 'REALLY', 'excellent.Mel', 'Gibson', 'initially', 'definitely', 'microwave-quick', 'get-to-the-point', 'predatory', 'male', 'nuance', 'character', 'paints', 'picture.When', 'Big', 'Trick', 'film', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'hindsight', 'think', 'was', 'smart', 'annoy', 'audience', 'part', 'film', 'clearly', 'plot', 'twist', 'disturbing', 'character.With', 'new', 'powers', 'Nick', 'Mel', 'character', 'first', 'tries', 'use', 'predatory', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'powers', 'way', 'SWITCHING', 'TACTICS', 'character', 'THINKING', 'switch', 'tactics', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'believable', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'quot', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Nick', 'more', 'emotion-based', 'decider', 'mannerisms', 'clearly', 'display', 'have', 'equate', 'believability', 'new', 'mannerisms', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'growth', 'Kramer', 'vs', 'Kramer', 'Further', 'Nick', 'women', 'better', 'Tom', 'Hanks-like', 'empathy', 'very', 'likeable', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'same', 'paragraph', 'Mel', 'really', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'scene', 'little', 'differently', 'film', ""n't"", 'end-all', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'had', 'good', 'feeling', 'happy', 'had', 'watched', 'it.I', 'would', 'call', 'movie', 'smart', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Ashley Johnson is also on hand as his daughter, who is shocked when she sees her distant father showing signs of really caring.The ending gets a little too mushy, but ""What Women Want"" is consistently entertaining throughout.
