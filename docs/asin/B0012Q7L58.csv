1138689,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0012Q7L58,bookloversfriend,"[7, 16]","This movie has its moments, but there is more to regret than to like in this effort.The first third of the movie is a washout with four unprepossessing characters not relating to each other.  The second third picks up occasionally, and the last third is better.But the movie looks like the work of someone just learning to write a screenplay.  New characters seem to be made up as we go along and thrown in to prop up a sagging story.The big plus, of course, is Lea Thompson, but she is only on for a few short bursts and plays a less-than-sympathetic character.The big minus is the preteen girl--and she's the central character.  She seems incapable of producing any but one face.  This wax, expressionless face is worn in every scene and in every situation.  On a scale of 1 to 10, her acting is 0.  She seemed to have an amused detachment from the movie as though she found the whole thing, like, you know, too much.There are some touching moments toward the end as characters begin to get it together.  I had no problem with them, but others might find them unconvincing.",3,a nonpartisan review,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1075,"['movie', 'moments', 'more', 'regret', 'like', 'effort.The', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'washout', 'four', 'unprepossessing', 'characters', 'not', 'relating', 'other', 'second', 'third', 'up', 'occasionally', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'work', 'someone', 'just', 'learning', 'write', 'screenplay', 'New', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'thrown', 'prop', 'up', 'sagging', 'story.The', 'big', 'course', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'only', 'few', 'short', 'bursts', 'less-than-sympathetic', 'character.The', 'big', 'minus', 'preteen', 'girl', 'central', 'character', 'incapable', 'producing', 'one', 'face', 'wax', 'expressionless', 'face', 'worn', 'scene', 'situation', 'scale', '1', '10', 'acting', '0', 'seemed', 'have', 'amused', 'detachment', 'movie', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'know', 'too', 'are', 'touching', 'moments', 'end', 'characters', 'begin', 'get', 'together', 'had', 'problem', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'unconvincing']",N/A

1138697,A33MB7QXL119C5,B0012Q7L58,Neb42,"[0, 1]","This movie attempts to follow a familiar story line:  an annoying young girl from a big city is sent to the boonies to spend the summer with a relative.  In this rural setting she becomes less annoying, and finally actually lovable.  Usually a horse plays a part in this transformation.  There is no horse in this movie and the girl remains annoying for a long long time after she gets to the country.  When her doddering Grandpa enters his bathroom and accidentally sees the girl wrapped in a towel, she screams at him.  When he averts his gaze and retreats, she screams at him to come back and close the door.  When the poor old guy comes back, she screams at him again.  Later, she falls out of a motorboat, trashes around screaming until finally she sinks underwater and loses consciousness.  When she comes to, she screams at the guy who saved her.  By that time I was sort of disappointed that she hadn't drowned.  Eventually she does get less annoying, but for me the transformation took much too long.  I usually enjoy &#34;family&#34; type movies, even the sappy ones, even the really corny ones.  But I could not enjoy this film.
