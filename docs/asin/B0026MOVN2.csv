I could discern no bias here as the editors did not sugarcoat the government's (the SEC in particular) role in the Bernie Madoff fiasco. They were given every clue and every lead regarding his corruption yet still found the charges against him to be unfounded. This documentary did a magnificent job of highlighting the fashion by which ordinary people become contaminated by greed along with the need to maintain a beneficial status quo.

1251845,APQB2FOMSBMAL,B0026MOVN2,Doctor A.,"[8, 9]","Perhaps the most fact-based documentary available on this quintessential Ponzi scheme. Madoff is a master con artist to be sure, but he is only the tip of a glacial mass on Wall Street. From reviewer comments here and elsewhere, it seems most folks just don't recognize the larger economic, social and ethical context in which this scam took place. Since Reagan, the waves of federal deregulation and the ill-conceived withdrawal of oversight literally created an incubation chamber for greed and abuse. The casino capitalism of Bush/Cheney opened the gates to outright fraud and rampant corruption.If we look back just a few years, Enron, Tyco and WorldCom were simply the prelude to Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie, Freddie, AIG -- and Madoff. Sadly, America is becoming a nation that knows the price of everything... and the value of nothing. From corporate debt that is reported as assets, to fantasy home mortgages that are expected to default, to the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"" mentality that is so widely promoted by the media and embraced by the public, it is abundantly obvious that this nation has lost it's moral compass. To quote Justice Louis Brandeis, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",5,Shame On Bernie...

1251846,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0026MOVN2,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 13]","Madoff committed the largest investment scheme in American history.  Folk lost $65 billion dollars because of him.  This work gives some of the facts behind the tragedy.Newspapers have continually said they suspect Madoff could not have accomplished this on his own.  Althought some close to Madoff refused to be interviewed here, others spoke.  This program lists names from which I imagine that prosecutors could find more info.This felt like Titanic in which multiple small errors added to something large and devastating.  Dahmer could have been stopped earlier in his murder spree, but police let him go.  Similar here, the SEC looked toward Madoff once but never dug further.  The 1986 Challenger tragedy happened in part because NASA wanted to launch the spaceship no matter what.  This work says SEC didn't have enough staff to go after Madoff.  That may be a credible excuse, but they sho' should have egg on their face.This work speaks infrequently of Madoff's biography.  Some audience members may want a psychological profile of the man and they will be disappointed not to receive it here.  You never get a sense of what made this guy tick.This work touches upon something: Madoff shows no remorse.  I don't want to be insensitive, but buyer beware!  If someone says to you, ""I can make you lots of money, but never tell anyone I'm the person doing it"" then that should tell you something is fishy!The work doesn't touch upon something: I wonder if the far-right push to deregulate the business sector played a role in this.  In the same way that it destroyed the housing market, perhaps the laziness that conservative politicians and voters adore caused this mess.  Take that, I-worship-the-free-market goons!

It unravels the true story and mechanics behind the world's first global Ponzi scheme--a scheme ""that lasted longer, reached wider, and cut deeper than any other business scandal in history!""(A Ponzi scheme is a pyramid type swindle in which very high returns are promised to early investors, who are paid off with money put up by later investors.  Generally a hedge fund hedges (reduces) some of the risks inherent in investments using a variety of methods.)This documentary was televised on May 12, 2009 and explains everything up until one month before the mastermind behind this scheme was sentenced.Who was the mastermind?  ANSWER:  Bernard ""Bernie"" Madoff.  Madoff (pronounced ""Made Off"") was a former stockbroker, financial advisor, and chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange.The fact is that billions of dollars were channelled to Madoff's investment firm.  He and his ""feeders"" became wealthy--fabulously wealthy.  All this ended when Madoff's con was discovered on Dec. 11, 2008.  Madoff himself confessed that it was all ""one big lie.""This documentary answers many key questions such as:(1) How did Madoff pull it off?(2) Who helped him?(3) When did it all begin?(4) With all the suspicions and many red flags, just where were the regulators?(5) How was Madoff able to pull his con off for so long?(6) Why did he finally get caught?There are brief comments about what happened made by journalists, business people, lawyers, bilked investors, etc.  As well, there is lots of archival footage shown.Be aware that this documentary does not stop to define terms.  There are a few terms (like the two defined above) that the average viewer may not be familiar with.  When you come across such terms, it's best to pause the documentary, and look them up.  Doing this will aid in understanding and enjoyment of this program.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  Not mentioned is that this DVD has closed captioning.  It has no extras.In conclusion, this is an extremely interesting and well-done documentary that seems to me illuminates two lessons:(1) It's YOUR money.  YOU have to look after it (not someone else).(2) Don't give your money to people named Madoff.  They just might MAKE OFF with it.(2009;  55 min;  first televised on the PBS program ""Frontline;""  wide screen;  8 chapters)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,"It was all ""one big lie""",1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2662,"['XXXXX', 'was', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'ask', 'questions', 'small-time', 'investors', 'sophisticated', 'hedge', 'fund', 'managers', 'where', 'were', 'regulators', 'above', 'what', 'narrator', 'beginning', 'revealing', 'documentary', 'true', 'story', 'mechanics', 'world', 'first', 'global', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'scheme', 'lasted', 'longer', 'reached', 'wider', 'cut', 'deeper', 'other', 'business', 'scandal', 'history', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'pyramid', 'type', 'swindle', 'very', 'high', 'returns', 'are', 'promised', 'early', 'investors', 'who', 'are', 'paid', 'off', 'money', 'put', 'up', 'later', 'investors', 'Generally', 'hedge', 'fund', 'hedges', 'reduces', 'risks', 'inherent', 'investments', 'using', 'variety', 'methods', 'documentary', 'was', 'televised', 'May', '12', '2009', 'everything', 'up', 'one', 'month', 'mastermind', 'scheme', 'was', 'sentenced.Who', 'was', 'mastermind', 'ANSWER', 'Bernard', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'Madoff', 'pronounced', 'Made', 'Off', 'was', 'former', 'stockbroker', 'financial', 'advisor', 'chairman', 'NASDAQ', 'stock', 'exchange.The', 'fact', 'billions', 'dollars', 'were', 'channelled', 'Madoff', 'investment', 'firm', 'feeders', 'became', 'wealthy', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'ended', 'when', 'Madoff', 'con', 'was', 'discovered', 'Dec.', '11', '2008', 'Madoff', 'confessed', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'lie', 'documentary', 'answers', 'many', 'key', 'questions', 'such', '1', 'How', 'did', 'Madoff', 'pull', 'off', '2', 'Who', 'helped', '3', 'When', 'did', 'begin', '4', 'suspicions', 'many', 'red', 'flags', 'just', 'where', 'were', 'regulators', '5', 'How', 'was', 'Madoff', 'able', 'pull', 'con', 'off', 'so', 'long', '6', 'Why', 'did', 'finally', 'get', 'caught', 'are', 'brief', 'comments', 'what', 'happened', 'made', 'journalists', 'business', 'people', 'lawyers', 'bilked', 'investors', 'etc', 'well', 'lots', 'archival', 'footage', 'shown.Be', 'aware', 'documentary', 'not', 'stop', 'define', 'terms', 'are', 'few', 'terms', 'two', 'defined', 'average', 'viewer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'When', 'come', 'such', 'terms', 'best', 'pause', 'documentary', 'look', 'up', 'Doing', 'will', 'aid', 'understanding', 'enjoyment', 'program.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2009', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Not', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'closed', 'captioning', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'well-done', 'documentary', 'two', 'lessons', '1', 'YOUR', 'money', 'have', 'look', 'not', 'someone', 'else', '2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'money', 'people', 'named', 'Madoff', 'just', 'might', 'MAKE', 'OFF', '2009', '55', 'min', 'first', 'televised', 'PBS', 'program', 'Frontline', 'wide', 'screen', '8', 'chapters', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",FRONTLINE: The Madoff Affair
