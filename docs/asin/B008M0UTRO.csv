1570240,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008M0UTRO,C. Sawin,"[8, 19]","It has been three to five years (depending on if you go by the Japanese or US release of the film) since Goro Miyazaki's last film ""Tales From Earthsea."" Studio Ghibli released ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" in US theaters last year and while Hayao Miyazaki was involved with contributing to the screenplay (which he also did for ""From Up on Poppy Hill""), his last animated film as director was ""Ponyo"" back in 2009 (""The Wind Rises"" was released in Japan earlier this year and looks to be Hayao Miyazaki's final film before retirement). Studio Ghibli is to anime what Pixar is to computer animation; they tend to have a reputation for producing and distributing exceptional animated films that take pride in affecting your emotions and capturing your imagination in ways live-action films only dream of. Unfortunately, and this seems to be the opinion of only a small few, but ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" doesn't live up to Studio Ghibli's marvelous back catalog.The animation in ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" is just as fluid and crisp as other Studio Ghibli films and it features some magnificently vibrant colors. Satoshi Takebe's music is the film's biggest asset as it absolutely establishes the animated film's intimate yet somewhat troubled atmosphere. The music leans on the eccentric side as it has hints of Chopin and swing music, is heavy on piano, flute, and jazz influences, and even seems to have shades of show tunes at times.While the film is incredibly pretty to look at, ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" is extremely boring. The entire film is mostly watching Umi eat, do chores, cook, and go to school. In between gossip among schoolmates, Umi still raises the flags every morning in hopes of seeing her father return home from the supply ship he captained during the war. The concept is kind of interesting, but after you learn what comes between Umi and Shun you will never look at flagpoles the same again after viewing the film.When ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" isn't following Umi and her errands, it revolves around the three storey Latin Quarter building which everyone wants to renovate and save from demolition. As Shun begins to get popular after jumping off the building, the film also introduces a few songs to make it feel like a musical. This isn't in the enchanting or Disney movie sense. It's more of an awkward cramming that makes you wonder why people are singing at such a desperate time.""From Up on Poppy Hill"" has drama, romance, and focuses on the importance of family, but it does so in a really roundabout way that fails to be absorbing or trigger any sort of emotions whatsoever. It doesn't have the sensational fantasy elements that other Studio Ghibli films like ""Spirited Away"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro"" have to capture your imagination and isn't nearly as captivating or heartbreaking as ""Grave of the Fireflies."" ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" may be able to boast about its outstanding music and smooth animation, but it's far too flat to leave much of an impression.The Two-Disc special edition of the film includes both the Blu-ray and DVD and over 3 hours of bonus features including the Japanese version of the film, Feature-length Storyboards (meaning you can watch the entire film in storyboard format), Director Goro Miyazaki on Yokohama (17:37), Yokohama - Stories of the Past and Present (22:36), ""Summer of Farewells"" Music Video, an English Voice Cast Featurette (21:48), Press Conference - Theme Song Announcement (39:33), Hayao Miyazaki's Speech After the Staff Screening (6:14), Japanese Trailers and Teasers, and the US trailer.",2,Studio Ghibli at its most lifeless and ordinary,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,3561,"['been', 'three', 'five', 'years', 'depending', 'go', 'Japanese', 'US', 'release', 'film', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'last', 'film', 'Tales', 'Earthsea', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'released', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'US', 'theaters', 'last', 'year', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'was', 'involved', 'contributing', 'screenplay', 'also', 'did', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'last', 'animated', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'Ponyo', 'back', '2009', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'was', 'released', 'Japan', 'earlier', 'year', 'be', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'final', 'film', 'retirement', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'anime', 'what', 'Pixar', 'computer', 'animation', 'tend', 'have', 'reputation', 'producing', 'distributing', 'exceptional', 'animated', 'films', 'take', 'pride', 'affecting', 'emotions', 'capturing', 'imagination', 'ways', 'live-action', 'films', 'only', 'dream', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'opinion', 'only', 'small', 'few', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'marvelous', 'back', 'catalog.The', 'animation', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'just', 'fluid', 'crisp', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'magnificently', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'Satoshi', 'Takebe', 'music', 'film', 'biggest', 'asset', 'absolutely', 'animated', 'film', 'intimate', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'eccentric', 'side', 'hints', 'Chopin', 'swing', 'music', 'heavy', 'piano', 'flute', 'jazz', 'influences', 'even', 'have', 'shades', 'show', 'tunes', 'film', 'incredibly', 'pretty', 'look', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'extremely', 'boring', 'entire', 'film', 'mostly', 'watching', 'Umi', 'eat', 'do', 'chores', 'cook', 'go', 'school', 'gossip', 'schoolmates', 'Umi', 'still', 'flags', 'morning', 'hopes', 'seeing', 'father', 'return', 'home', 'supply', 'ship', 'captained', 'war', 'concept', 'kind', 'interesting', 'learn', 'what', 'Umi', 'Shun', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'flagpoles', 'same', 'again', 'viewing', 'film.When', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'following', 'Umi', 'errands', 'three', 'storey', 'Latin', 'Quarter', 'building', 'everyone', 'renovate', 'save', 'demolition', 'Shun', 'get', 'popular', 'jumping', 'off', 'building', 'film', 'also', 'few', 'songs', 'make', 'feel', 'musical', ""n't"", 'enchanting', 'Disney', 'movie', 'sense', 'more', 'awkward', 'cramming', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'singing', 'desperate', 'time', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'drama', 'romance', 'importance', 'family', 'so', 'really', 'roundabout', 'way', 'be', 'absorbing', 'trigger', 'sort', 'emotions', ""n't"", 'have', 'sensational', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'have', 'capture', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'captivating', 'heartbreaking', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'boast', 'outstanding', 'music', 'smooth', 'animation', 'far', 'too', 'flat', 'leave', 'much', 'impression.The', 'Two-Disc', 'special', 'edition', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', '3', 'hours', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film', 'Feature-length', 'Storyboards', 'meaning', 'can', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'storyboard', 'format', 'Director', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'Yokohama', '17:37', 'Yokohama', 'Stories', 'Past', 'Present', '22:36', 'Summer', 'Farewells', 'Music', 'Video', 'English', 'Voice', 'Cast', 'Featurette', '21:48', 'Press', 'Conference', 'Theme', 'Song', 'Announcement', '39:33', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Speech', 'Staff', 'Screening', '6:14', 'Japanese', 'Trailers', 'Teasers', 'US', 'trailer']",N/A

That said. I like the story, which is a character piece more than any other Ghibli anime I've seen. I agree with some of the critics that it needs a plot driver... to drive or push the story along with more of a goal or purpose, and it ended a little too abruptly IMO. I agree with those that say to watch the original Japanese cast with the english dubs... not sure why, but there are a couple of times that, in key moments, what is said is different than the english cast and it is a WTF?! reaction, not that it really changes anything, but it's different than the original, which let's face it, is better because the feel of the anime is Japanese, so obviously the Japanese cast relates the feel of the characters in their voices, sometimes in silence, which seems to be feared here in the States and like a radio host, any silent moment must be filled, even if with nonsense. I would recommend English peaking viewers watch the English cast then the next day watch the original Japanese cast with the English dubs, that way you know the characters and storyline and can better appreciate the original, which like in any anime, is better in the language the characters are visually expressed in... it does make a difference, whether or not you understand any of the history etc... though I would recommend watching the interviews first as well to get a little bit of a feel for the background... though that IMO should have been inserted into the background with a little dialogue etc.. it really doesn't take much, a few words here or there, as I would think even a modern Japanese viewer might not have a feel for this time from after the war to the Olympics, which could have been used as a background for the society's transition better. Overall, it's a good story, love that ending theme song, very atmospheric but with a story behind it unlike many such songs by Enya, as the words give it a destination and a better feel.A line by the surviving captain about the similarity of two old friends in looks would have settled another issue that's used in the story's plotting... as they did look like brothers if not twins in that photo. The story just needs a little tweeking to bring it up to the par of many other Ghibli products.

1570250,A11AZG938XL5UU,B008M0UTRO,Greg Polansky,"[30, 36]","Set in the early 1960s in Yokohama, From Up on Poppy Hill details the story of 16yo Umi Matsuzaki. Umi's father is dead. Her mother, a doctor,  is away in the United States. Living at home, Umi remains the dutiful young Japanese female teenager. She wakes early to set the rice cooking. She prepares lunches. She takes care of her grandmother (loved seeing her still in her traditional kimonos) and her younger sisters while her mother is away. She raises the signal flags outside her home, because that's what her father and she used to do together before he was killed in the Korean War. She goes to school and is a good student. One day at school she finds herself the subject of a poem. A poem that is romantic! Who could have written it? As if that were not enough trouble, Shun Kazama, the local heartthrob, jumps down from high up on a building. Right in front of her!! This causes the entire school to focus on her.Suddenly Umi finds herself taken to Quartier Latin, a local club housed in an old worn-down building, by her younger Sora who wants an autograph from Umi. It is there that she encounters Shun again. This charming building is the subject of much fierce debate about its usefulness and its future. The governing body of the school wish it to be torn down and so do the majority of the students of the school. Umi finds herself caught between the battling philosophies waging war against Japan. As Japan throws itself headlong into the future while readying itself for the 1964 Olympics that will be held in Tokyo, people are everywhere tearing down old buildings, forgetting the past, and distancing themselves from the culture of their parents. Others resist this movement and try to preserve as much of the past as they can. Here is a Studio Ghibli film that you will find in many other films - the idea of balance. While elsewhere that balance is between the human world and the environment, here Studio Ghibli explores the idea of balance between the past and present and future. The character of Umi suggests that the building could be spruced up and maybe that would sway popular opinion. And so Umi, Shun, and the students of the school find themselves racing to battle ""progress"".The secondary story line concerns the relationship between Umi and Shun. To describe it in detail would be to ruin certain surprises that add a certain degree of drama to the movie. This relationship is a poignant, quiet one and as beautifully done in any Studio Ghibli film.I have now watched every single Studio Ghibli film (and if you click on my name you can see my reviews of those films). From Up on Poppy Hill is in the spirit of Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, and Ocean Waves. Most Americans are familiar with the more fantastical Studio Ghibli films - think Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, but I tend to find that films like From Up on Poppy Hill touch both my heart and mind more than the fantastical films. That's just my opinion and my favorite Studio Ghibli film still remains the fantastical My Neighbor Totoro. From Up on Poppy Hill is a worthy addition to the Studio Ghibli cannon and shows greater maturity from Gor&#333; Miyazaki (the directory of the terrible Tales From Earthsea). Now I am looking forward to Takahata's The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, which will be released sometime in 2013.",5,A Perfect Studio Ghibli Film,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,3336,"['Set', 'early', '1960s', 'Yokohama', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'details', 'story', '16yo', 'Umi', 'Matsuzaki', 'Umi', 'father', 'dead', 'mother', 'doctor', 'away', 'United', 'States', 'Living', 'home', 'Umi', 'dutiful', 'young', 'Japanese', 'female', 'teenager', 'wakes', 'early', 'set', 'rice', 'cooking', 'lunches', 'care', 'grandmother', 'loved', 'seeing', 'still', 'traditional', 'kimonos', 'younger', 'sisters', 'mother', 'away', 'signal', 'flags', 'home', 'what', 'father', 'used', 'do', 'together', 'was', 'killed', 'Korean', 'War', 'school', 'good', 'student', 'One', 'day', 'school', 'subject', 'poem', 'poem', 'romantic', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'trouble', 'Shun', 'Kazama', 'local', 'heartthrob', 'jumps', 'down', 'high', 'up', 'building', 'Right', 'front', 'entire', 'school', 'focus', 'her.Suddenly', 'Umi', 'taken', 'Quartier', 'Latin', 'local', 'club', 'housed', 'old', 'worn-down', 'building', 'younger', 'Sora', 'who', 'autograph', 'Umi', 'there', 'Shun', 'again', 'charming', 'building', 'subject', 'much', 'fierce', 'debate', 'usefulness', 'future', 'governing', 'body', 'school', 'wish', 'be', 'torn', 'down', 'so', 'do', 'majority', 'students', 'school', 'Umi', 'caught', 'battling', 'philosophies', 'waging', 'war', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'headlong', 'future', 'readying', '1964', 'Olympics', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'Tokyo', 'people', 'are', 'everywhere', 'tearing', 'down', 'old', 'buildings', 'forgetting', 'past', 'distancing', 'culture', 'parents', 'Others', 'resist', 'movement', 'try', 'preserve', 'much', 'past', 'can', 'Here', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'idea', 'balance', 'elsewhere', 'balance', 'human', 'world', 'environment', 'here', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'idea', 'balance', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'character', 'Umi', 'building', 'could', 'be', 'spruced', 'up', 'maybe', 'would', 'sway', 'popular', 'opinion', 'so', 'Umi', 'Shun', 'students', 'school', 'find', 'racing', 'battle', 'progress', 'secondary', 'story', 'line', 'relationship', 'Umi', 'Shun', 'describe', 'detail', 'would', 'be', 'ruin', 'certain', 'surprises', 'add', 'certain', 'degree', 'drama', 'movie', 'relationship', 'poignant', 'quiet', 'one', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film.I', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'single', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'click', 'name', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'films', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'spirit', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'Only', 'Yesterday', 'Ocean', 'Waves', 'Most', 'Americans', 'are', 'familiar', 'more', 'fantastical', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'think', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Ponyo', 'tend', 'find', 'films', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'touch', 'heart', 'mind', 'more', 'fantastical', 'films', 'just', 'opinion', 'favorite', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'still', 'fantastical', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'cannon', 'greater', 'maturity', 'Gor', '333', 'Miyazaki', 'directory', 'terrible', 'Tales', 'Earthsea', 'Now', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Takahata', 'Tale', 'Bamboo', 'Cutter', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'sometime', '2013']",N/A

Poppy Hill is a drama that just so happens to be animated, a relatively common thing in Japan, which takes its anime very seriously.The film is mostly about Umi - her role in saving the clubhouse, her heartbreak over the death of her father, and the reconciliation of that pain through Shun entering her life. Poppy Hill is very much a ""slice of life"" film, one that shines in the small spaces, the usual meticulous attention to detail we come to expect from Ghibli, but is rather bland in the way of plot. There are touching moments, too, but nothing in the way of dramatic twists or emotional impact.I suspect that this film has far more relevance to people in Japan, as there are references to the Korean War, which had a much different impact there than in the West, and to the 1964 Olympics, which was hosted in Tokyo to much national pride. For those not steeped in Japanese culture and history - as I am not - there is not much *to* Poppy Hill, except to enjoy the gorgeous animation and to peer through a small window into a very specific time in Japanese history.",3,A Slice of Life Within a Small Window,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1187,"['film', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'usual', 'fantasy', 'magical', 'realism', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'drama', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'animated', 'relatively', 'common', 'thing', 'Japan', 'anime', 'very', 'seriously.The', 'film', 'mostly', 'Umi', 'role', 'saving', 'clubhouse', 'heartbreak', 'death', 'father', 'reconciliation', 'pain', 'Shun', 'entering', 'life', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'very', 'much', 'slice', 'life', 'film', 'one', 'small', 'spaces', 'usual', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'come', 'expect', 'Ghibli', 'rather', 'bland', 'way', 'plot', 'are', 'touching', 'moments', 'too', 'nothing', 'way', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'emotional', 'impact.I', 'suspect', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'relevance', 'people', 'Japan', 'are', 'references', 'Korean', 'War', 'had', 'much', 'different', 'impact', 'there', 'West', '1964', 'Olympics', 'was', 'hosted', 'Tokyo', 'much', 'national', 'pride', 'not', 'steeped', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'history', 'am', 'not', 'not', 'much', '*to*', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'enjoy', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'peer', 'small', 'window', 'very', 'specific', 'time', 'Japanese', 'history']",N/A
1570268,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008M0UTRO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[28, 31]","The arrival of any animated feature from the esteemed Studio Ghibli is of note to movie lovers everywhere! With a screenplay by the venerable Hayao Miyazaki, ""From Up On Poppy Hill"" is no exception. As you would expect, the movie is beautifully drawn and its sweeping images look terrific in this Blu-ray presentation. Originally released in 2011, I've been awaiting an official North American debut and the GKIDS label has done a fine job with this introduction. One of my biggest complaints in recent years is when companies dub a foreign masterpiece with an American cast and present that English language version as the definitive DVD/Blu-ray release. While I understand that may broaden the appeal of the movie to a wider audience, it saddens me not to have access to the original vision in subtitles. Thankfully, GKIDS has taken this into consideration. So here, we get the dubbed version with an impressive array of vocal talent including Gillian Anderson, Sarah Bolger, Beau Bridges, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bruce Dern, Christina Hendricks, Ron Howard, Chris Noth, Aubrey Plaza, and Anton Yelchin. But for purists, the original Japanese edition is presented intact as well. I never understand why that isn't just a standard!As not much in the way of actual DVD/Blu-ray information is presented, let me just cover some of the impressive extras on the release. There are over three hours worth of material which include:1) The Aforementioned Japanese Release2) Feature Length Storyboards3) Celebrity Cast Recording Featurette4) Interview with director Goro Miyazaki5) Music Video6) Yokohama Featurette7) Original Japanese Trailers and TV SpotsIf you get the Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack, you also get a 16 page booklet (only with this specific combo) that has both illustrations and text with excerpts from the original treatment that got the movie greenlit and a letter from the director. It's a nice addition, of particular interest to Studio Ghibli enthusiasts.As for the movie itself, it is a sweetly nostalgic piece set shortly before the arrival of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. While the country invites newness and a fresh public image, a group of concerned students battle to maintain a link to the heritage that built modern Japan. The primary revolution surrounds the proposed destruction of a student hall (Latin Quarter) that has become an educational landmark. Idealism, passion, and hope are written across every frame of the film as the kids yearn for a promising tomorrow. The lead is Umi, a young girl who lost her father in the Korean War. While her mother is in America, she is charged with running a boarding house for her grandmother's tenants, looking after her siblings, and being a full time student. She has a lot on her plate! I felt sorry for her, especially when she meets a cute boy (Shun) and is then enlisted to do additional tasks (transcribing, cleaning) for the student revolt as well. She maintains a sweet optimism even in the face this grueling workload!The movie has a lot to do with the burgeoning friendship of Shun (Yelchin) and Umi (Bulger). As they grow closer, it seems that they might have more in common than they first think. And certain past ties will either tear them apart or bring them closer together. Staged as a mini-mystery, the two must come to terms with a family history that includes both loss and sacrifice. I'm not sure that I was completely enthralled with this principle story thread, and its conclusion felt exceedingly rushed. Overall, though, ""From Up On Poppy Hill"" is a gentle and lovely experience that was well worth the investment. For me, it might not be a Ghibli classic that I'll revisit with frequency, but it's a solid tale that should appeal to fans of traditional Japanese animation. But the movie is certainly enhanced by the great Bonus additions!

While taking care of her family&#8217;s boarding house and its residents in the mornings and evenings, she takes an interest in helping fellow student Shun Kazama work to save her school&#8217;s dilapidated clubhouse from demolition.Working together soon draws them closer to each other until a surprising past is revealed that momentarily puts a stop to the feelings they have developed for each other.And while that little tidbit sounds very soapy, especially for an animated film from Studio Ghibli, it is only one small part of the greater narrative.And that narrative is one that evokes a dream-like nostalgia very much present in the previous works of Miyazaki, the senior. The signature hand-drawn animation beautifully brings to life a more idyllic, yet at the same time tensely transitional period in Japan&#8217;s history.Serving as a window to the country and its people after World War II and the Korean War and before the successful 1964 Tokyo Olympics, From Up on Poppy Hill is a nostalgic and warm slice of life drama. It paints the picture of a bustling, but hometown feeling port city during a much simpler time, making it relatable to people of any culture or ethnicity. Specifically, it touches on the quickly developing country, eager to recover from the painful decades before.Thinking of Studio Ghibli and the master that is Hayao Miyazaki, one immediately thinks of such fantastical films as Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro or fiercely thought provoking films like Princess Mononoke and pre-Ghibli Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And while it shares many of the same qualities, From Up on Poppy Hill is a much simpler story.But it is in its simplicity that From Up on Poppy Hill draws its best, unique qualities. It is at times a heartwarming story of friendship and young love and at others, a fun look at childhood and youth. The film subtly, but effectively conveys that poignant nostalgia that can make even a 26-year old youngin like me can get teary eyed at the thought of a much simpler time.The film takes care to point out how important the past is in our present and future. For the characters, it is their holding on to their pasts that help get them through to their futures. That&#8217;s a philosophy I personally subscribe to as well, making it that much more meaningful to me.So yes, the film does have plenty of MaGMCMs, including right at the end when everything just sinks in. And that may just be a trademark of a Hayao Miyazki written screenplay.While the younger Miyazaki, Goro, drew a tepid response to his directorial debut, the uneven Tales from Earthsea, he recovers very well here and shows that he does have a promising future following in his father&#8217;s very big footsteps.From Up on Poppy Hill may not have the grand, fantastical adventure of other Studio Ghibli films, but it is just as engaging and contains just as much magic thanks to its beautifully breathtaking visuals, likeable characters and sincerely nostalgic story.",5,Beautifully and Sincerely Nostalgic,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,3538,"['Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'names', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Miyazaki', 'might', 'come', 'expect', 'Oscar-winning', 'blockbuster', 'studio', 'director.But', 'film', 'written', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Keiko', 'Niwa', 'directed', 'Hayao', '8217', 'son', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'may', 'be', 'opposite', 'more', 'fantastical', 'films', 'are', 'known', '8217', 'less', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'less', 'emotionally', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'story', 'Umi', 'Matsuzaki', '16-year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', '1963', 'Yokohama', 'taking', 'care', 'family', '8217', 'boarding', 'house', 'residents', 'mornings', 'evenings', 'interest', 'helping', 'fellow', 'student', 'Shun', 'Kazama', 'work', 'save', 'school', '8217', 'dilapidated', 'clubhouse', 'demolition.Working', 'together', 'soon', 'draws', 'closer', 'other', 'surprising', 'past', 'revealed', 'momentarily', 'stop', 'feelings', 'have', 'developed', 'other.And', 'little', 'tidbit', 'very', 'soapy', 'especially', 'animated', 'film', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'part', 'greater', 'narrative.And', 'narrative', 'one', 'dream-like', 'nostalgia', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'previous', 'works', 'Miyazaki', 'senior', 'signature', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'life', 'more', 'idyllic', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'tensely', 'transitional', 'period', 'Japan', '8217', 's', 'history.Serving', 'window', 'country', 'people', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Korean', 'War', 'successful', '1964', 'Tokyo', 'Olympics', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'nostalgic', 'warm', 'slice', 'life', 'drama', 'picture', 'bustling', 'hometown', 'feeling', 'port', 'city', 'much', 'simpler', 'time', 'making', 'relatable', 'people', 'culture', 'ethnicity', 'Specifically', 'quickly', 'developing', 'country', 'eager', 'recover', 'painful', 'decades', 'before.Thinking', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'master', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'one', 'immediately', 'such', 'fantastical', 'films', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'fiercely', 'thought', 'provoking', 'films', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'pre-Ghibli', 'Nausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'shares', 'many', 'same', 'qualities', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'much', 'simpler', 'story.But', 'simplicity', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'best', 'unique', 'qualities', 'times', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'friendship', 'young', 'love', 'others', 'fun', 'look', 'childhood', 'youth', 'film', 'subtly', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'poignant', 'can', 'make', 'even', '26-year', 'old', 'youngin', 'can', 'get', 'teary', 'eyed', 'thought', 'much', 'simpler', 'time.The', 'film', 'care', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'important', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'characters', 'holding', 'pasts', 'help', 'get', 'futures', '8217', 's', 'philosophy', 'personally', 'subscribe', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful', 'me.So', 'yes', 'film', 'have', 'plenty', 'MaGMCMs', 'including', 'right', 'end', 'when', 'everything', 'just', 'sinks', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'trademark', 'Hayao', 'Miyazki', 'written', 'screenplay.While', 'younger', 'Miyazaki', 'Goro', 'drew', 'tepid', 'response', 'directorial', 'debut', 'uneven', 'Tales', 'Earthsea', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'have', 'promising', 'future', 'following', 'father', '8217', 'very', 'big', 'footsteps.From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'grand', 'fantastical', 'adventure', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'just', 'engaging', 'contains', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'magic', 'thanks', 'beautifully', 'breathtaking', 'visuals', 'likeable', 'characters', 'sincerely', 'nostalgic', 'story']",N/A

1570277,A1DL822FZZQA00,B008M0UTRO,"Michael E. Hill ""Major Rassendyll""","[1, 1]","""From Up on Poppy Hill"" was definitely under my radar.  I am a Miyazaki fan and I eagerly await anything from this illustrious studio.  Yet somehow I missed the US theatrical release of this film.  I only discovered this Japanese language DVD on Amazon.  It is a film by Goro Miyazaki son of Hiyao Miyazaki the world's greatest animator.  The elder Miyazaki did contribute to the story but Goro is the director.One thing a viewer should understand, Japanese animation is not necessarily a child's medium.  This film touches on things your six year old will not understand.  This is a `PG' film not `G'.This is a period piece set in Yokohoma, Japan.  The year is 1963. World War II has been over for almost twenty years.  The current generation is coming of age.  With the Olympics coming to Japan in 1964, there is a huge push to show the world a new Japan.  It's time to set old things aside and usher in the new era.Umi  Matsuzaki is 16 years old.  She lives in an old hospital owned by her family overlooking the harbor.  Her medical professor mother is training in the US.  She lives with her grandmother, three borders and her younger brother and sister.  Despite the presence of the grandmother, Umi is the true head of household, preparing meals, doing laundry, keeping the books, etc.  Her one eccentricity is each morning, she raises maritime signal flags in a ritual honoring her late father, a supply ship officer killed during the Korean War.At her school, Konan Academy, she finds out someone has been watching her morning ritual when she reads an anonymous poem in the school paper.  It seems she has an anonymous admirer. On the campus of the school is a large old building called the Latin Quarter.  It is used by the boys of the school as a club house for their various extracurricular activities including the school paper.  The school's board is considering demolishing the building a move objected to by the Student Body President Shiro Muzunuma and his best friend Shun Kazama, son of a tugboat captain.  At lunch, the Shun performs a daring stunt seen by most of the students to promote their protest.In the instant he jumps his eyes connect with Umi.  While this can't possibly be the first time they see each other, it is the first time they really see each other.  A connection is made and it is the beginning of their romance.  But Shun is adopted and the story of his origin could derail this relationship before it really gets started.....This is a Japanese film done in traditional hand-drawn animation.  It is absolutely beautiful. I really wish I'd seen this on a big screen.  Being forced to read the subtitles do not take away from the cinematic experience.There are cultural as well as temporal differences.  Remember this is a period piece.  The children wear uniforms to school.  The amount of detail is incredible. Light and shadow in the animation imitates life.  Shun's father stands at the wheel of his tugboat erect (like the former naval petty officer he'd been).  His eyes miss nothing and he turns the wheel with confidence and no wasted motion.Shiro is a subtle character.  He is a brilliant student academically as well as socially.  He runs the student body and misses nothing. Shun is his best friend and partner in all his endeavors.  The boys complement each other.  Shiro is cool, calm, caring but calculating.  Shun is bold, dashing and courageous.This relationship is best illustrated during a spirited student debate over whether or not to demolish the Latin Quarter.  It's also the most hilarious scene in the film.  Don't worry I won't spoil it for you.....The romance between Umi and Shun is the centerpiece of the film.  These are high school students in 1963.  There is latent sexual tension but that is not the point of this relationship.  This is the love we feel when we are happy just being together.  They are afraid to touch each other. But they hate to be apart.  Goro Miyazaki has his father's talent for romantic scenes.  Randomly meeting Umi on the street, Shun gives her a ride on his bicycle.  I know that does not sound like much but when you see it in the movie you will understand the emotional impact of this scene.Anyway I think I have written enough.  If you are looking for space aliens, car crashes or alien invaders this is not the movie you want.  However, if you want to see quality animation, intelligent characters that you grow to know and love and a great film, this is something you should see.",5,Beautiful Animation and Story,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,4481,"['Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'was', 'definitely', 'radar', 'am', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'eagerly', 'await', 'anything', 'illustrious', 'studio', 'somehow', 'missed', 'US', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'only', 'discovered', 'Japanese', 'language', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'film', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'son', 'Hiyao', 'Miyazaki', 'world', 'greatest', 'animator', 'elder', 'Miyazaki', 'did', 'contribute', 'story', 'Goro', 'director.One', 'thing', 'viewer', 'should', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'not', 'necessarily', 'child', 'medium', 'film', 'things', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'PG', 'film', 'not', ""G'.This"", 'period', 'piece', 'set', 'Yokohoma', 'Japan', 'year', '1963', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'been', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'current', 'generation', 'coming', 'age', 'Olympics', 'coming', 'Japan', '1964', 'huge', 'push', 'show', 'world', 'new', 'Japan', 'time', 'set', 'old', 'things', 'aside', 'usher', 'new', 'era.Umi', 'Matsuzaki', '16', 'years', 'old', 'old', 'hospital', 'owned', 'family', 'overlooking', 'harbor', 'Her', 'medical', 'professor', 'mother', 'training', 'US', 'grandmother', 'three', 'borders', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'presence', 'grandmother', 'Umi', 'true', 'head', 'household', 'preparing', 'meals', 'doing', 'laundry', 'keeping', 'books', 'etc', 'one', 'eccentricity', 'morning', 'maritime', 'signal', 'flags', 'ritual', 'honoring', 'late', 'father', 'supply', 'ship', 'officer', 'killed', 'Korean', 'War.At', 'school', 'Konan', 'Academy', 'out', 'someone', 'been', 'watching', 'morning', 'ritual', 'when', 'anonymous', 'poem', 'school', 'paper', 'anonymous', 'admirer', 'campus', 'school', 'large', 'old', 'building', 'called', 'Latin', 'Quarter', 'used', 'boys', 'school', 'club', 'house', 'various', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'including', 'school', 'paper', 'school', 'board', 'considering', 'demolishing', 'building', 'move', 'objected', 'Student', 'Body', 'President', 'Shiro', 'Muzunuma', 'best', 'friend', 'Shun', 'Kazama', 'son', 'tugboat', 'captain', 'lunch', 'Shun', 'daring', 'stunt', 'seen', 'most', 'students', 'promote', 'protest.In', 'instant', 'eyes', 'connect', 'Umi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'see', 'other', 'connection', 'made', 'beginning', 'romance', 'Shun', 'adopted', 'story', 'origin', 'could', 'derail', 'relationship', 'really', 'started', '..This', 'Japanese', 'film', 'done', 'traditional', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'really', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'Being', 'forced', 'read', 'subtitles', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'cinematic', 'are', 'cultural', 'as', 'well', 'temporal', 'differences', 'Remember', 'period', 'piece', 'children', 'wear', 'uniforms', 'school', 'amount', 'detail', 'incredible', 'Light', 'shadow', 'animation', 'life', 'Shun', 'father', 'wheel', 'tugboat', 'erect', 'former', 'naval', 'petty', 'officer', ""'d"", 'been', 'eyes', 'miss', 'nothing', 'wheel', 'confidence', 'wasted', 'motion.Shiro', 'subtle', 'character', 'brilliant', 'student', 'academically', 'as', 'well', 'socially', 'student', 'body', 'nothing', 'Shun', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'endeavors', 'boys', 'complement', 'other', 'Shiro', 'cool', 'calm', 'caring', 'calculating', 'Shun', 'bold', 'dashing', 'courageous.This', 'relationship', 'best', 'illustrated', 'spirited', 'student', 'debate', 'not', 'demolish', 'Latin', 'Quarter', 'also', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'romance', 'Umi', 'Shun', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'students', '1963', 'latent', 'sexual', 'tension', 'not', 'point', 'relationship', 'love', 'feel', 'when', 'are', 'happy', 'just', 'being', 'together', 'are', 'afraid', 'touch', 'other', 'hate', 'be', 'apart', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'father', 'talent', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Randomly', 'meeting', 'Umi', 'street', 'Shun', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'know', 'not', 'sound', 'much', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'understand', 'emotional', 'impact', 'scene.Anyway', 'think', 'have', 'written', 'enough', 'are', 'looking', 'space', 'aliens', 'car', 'crashes', 'alien', 'invaders', 'not', 'movie', 'want', 'However', 'want', 'see', 'quality', 'animation', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'grow', 'know', 'love', 'great', 'film', 'something', 'should', 'see']",N/A

I admit that I wasn't too excited for it at first as I usually prefer fantasy movies, but every minute of it was an absolute joy to watch.The setting is Yokohama, Japan, 1963. High school students Umi Matsuzaki and Shun Kazama, along with many of their classmates, are in a struggle to protect their clubhouse from demolition in favor of a new one. This rather small issue reflects bigger changes all over the country as people strive to move into the future and leave the past behind. The movie is full of humorous moments as well as the serious ones as it presents both the good and painful effects of the past on the present.The soundtrack is one of my favorite aspects of the movie, as it includes not only soft, beautiful pieces, but also ones with the Jazzy style of the time-period. The animation is wonderful just to look at, and the sound effects really create the atmosphere perfectly. I watched the movie in Japanese with subtitles the first few times, but when I watched it in English I was very pleased. The sound was mixed so well. Sometimes I think the voices in anime dubs are a bit too loud, but the English language actors' voices blended in so well with the other sounds. Also, the acting was very well done. Sarah Bolger as Umi had the perfect amount of energy while still sounding reserved. Anton Yelchin as Shun did surprise me, his voice being very different from that of the Japanese actor, but overall I think he had a good understanding of the character.Don't hesitate to give this one a shot; you won't regret it.",5,One of my favorites,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1589,"['Studio', 'Ghibli', 'more', 'delivers', 'film', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'first', 'usually', 'prefer', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'minute', 'was', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'setting', 'Yokohama', 'Japan', '1963', 'High', 'school', 'students', 'Umi', 'Matsuzaki', 'Shun', 'Kazama', 'many', 'classmates', 'are', 'struggle', 'protect', 'clubhouse', 'demolition', 'favor', 'new', 'one', 'rather', 'small', 'issue', 'bigger', 'changes', 'country', 'people', 'strive', 'move', 'future', 'leave', 'past', 'behind', 'movie', 'full', 'humorous', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'ones', 'good', 'painful', 'effects', 'past', 'present.The', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'soft', 'beautiful', 'pieces', 'also', 'ones', 'Jazzy', 'style', 'time-period', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'just', 'look', 'sound', 'effects', 'really', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'watched', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'watched', 'English', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'sound', 'was', 'mixed', 'so', 'well', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'voices', 'anime', 'dubs', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'loud', 'English', 'language', 'actors', 'voices', 'blended', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'sounds', 'Also', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'Umi', 'had', 'perfect', 'amount', 'energy', 'still', 'sounding', 'reserved', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Shun', 'did', 'surprise', 'voice', 'being', 'very', 'different', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'overall', 'think', 'had', 'good', 'understanding', 'character.Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

1570285,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B008M0UTRO,Oscar L. Colombo,"[1, 1]","The English-dubbed soundtrack plays flawlessly, but the original Japanese one has a problem: parts of it can be inaudible except, perhaps, with a top-of-the-line sound system.I watched with my PC hooked-up to a large-screen monitor with a simple stereo two-channel audio output. Parts of the soundtrack were clearly missing: a voice-over at the very beginning, and a song after the end titles; who knows what else, as well. I could tell, because the words appeared in the English sub-titles, but there was no sound. I have never encountered this sort of problem before, even though I have a fairly large collection of movies and TV shows.Now, my take on the movie:It is meant for older teens and adults; it will be probably boring for children.A film mostly about the details and patterns of daily life, thoughtfully and carefully shown in a mostly plain, but now and then gorgeous, animation style. Unlike the most famous movies from the Ghibli study, there are no magical characters. The characters are engaging enough, and the main plot is good enough to keep things moving. But, at least for me, it is the details that have magic.The place and time is Japan in the early sixties, but most of the domestic scenes - some cultural details aside -- resemble more family life in the West back in the fifties, because Japan was still catching up, after the devastation of the war.As someone who was a young man in the fifties, even in a different culture, I find that such ordinary things as turning on the gas to heat water first thing in the morning, do really take me back. And most of the street and high school scenes are full of people, each one doing something recognizable and interesting, even when glimpsed at for just a second.A previous Ghibli movie, in some ways similar, ""Whisper of the Heart"", shows contemporary Tokyo in a way that is both realistic and engaging. ""Poppy Hill"" shows the place at a moment of transition to its present form, still with much of the old Japan that is no longer there, and much that is still recognizable in the present day metropolis. For me Tokyo is a dear city, and the way it is shown gives this movie an added attractive.As many other Ghibli movies, this one is mostly about a serious, smart, thoughtful, self-possessed, and determined young lady, here seen at her turning point from girl into woman.The film has been characterized by some, including the late Roger Ebert, as bland, slow, even boring. In my opinion, it is not so much slow as unhurried, and watching it can be a good, refreshing experience - when approached in the proper spirit. It is the right movie for those that like to see, now and then, something worth watching just for what is shown: for every perfect vignette of daily life, however small and trivial, because they are satisfying enough already, so a highly dramatic, action-filled plot is not needed. (If looking for something well done, but dark, gritty and disturbing, one can always watch ""Breaking Bad""; give this one a chance.)",4,Good movie; DVD has a sound problem,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,3008,"['English-dubbed', 'soundtrack', 'flawlessly', 'original', 'Japanese', 'one', 'problem', 'parts', 'can', 'be', 'inaudible', 'perhaps', 'top-of-the-line', 'sound', 'system.I', 'watched', 'PC', 'hooked-up', 'large-screen', 'monitor', 'simple', 'stereo', 'two-channel', 'audio', 'output', 'Parts', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'clearly', 'missing', 'voice-over', 'very', 'beginning', 'song', 'end', 'titles', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'well', 'could', 'tell', 'words', 'appeared', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'was', 'sound', 'have', 'never', 'encountered', 'sort', 'problem', 'even', 'have', 'fairly', 'large', 'collection', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows.Now', 'take', 'movie', 'meant', 'older', 'teens', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'probably', 'boring', 'children.A', 'film', 'mostly', 'details', 'patterns', 'daily', 'life', 'thoughtfully', 'carefully', 'shown', 'mostly', 'plain', 'now', 'then', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'style', 'most', 'famous', 'movies', 'Ghibli', 'study', 'are', 'magical', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough', 'main', 'plot', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'least', 'details', 'have', 'magic.The', 'place', 'time', 'Japan', 'early', 'sixties', 'most', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'cultural', 'details', 'aside', 'resemble', 'more', 'family', 'life', 'West', 'back', 'fifties', 'Japan', 'was', 'still', 'catching', 'up', 'devastation', 'war.As', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'fifties', 'even', 'different', 'culture', 'find', 'such', 'ordinary', 'things', 'turning', 'gas', 'heat', 'water', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'do', 'really', 'take', 'back', 'most', 'street', 'high', 'school', 'scenes', 'are', 'full', 'people', 'one', 'doing', 'something', 'recognizable', 'interesting', 'even', 'when', 'glimpsed', 'just', 'second.A', 'previous', 'Ghibli', 'movie', 'ways', 'similar', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'contemporary', 'Tokyo', 'way', 'realistic', 'engaging', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'place', 'moment', 'transition', 'present', 'form', 'still', 'much', 'old', 'Japan', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'much', 'still', 'recognizable', 'present', 'day', 'metropolis', 'Tokyo', 'dear', 'city', 'way', 'shown', 'movie', 'added', 'attractive.As', 'many', 'other', 'Ghibli', 'movies', 'one', 'mostly', 'serious', 'smart', 'thoughtful', 'self-possessed', 'determined', 'young', 'lady', 'here', 'seen', 'turning', 'point', 'girl', 'woman.The', 'film', 'been', 'characterized', 'including', 'late', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'bland', 'slow', 'even', 'boring', 'opinion', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'slow', 'unhurried', 'watching', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'refreshing', 'experience', 'when', 'approached', 'proper', 'spirit', 'right', 'movie', 'like', 'see', 'now', 'then', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'what', 'shown', 'perfect', 'vignette', 'daily', 'life', 'however', 'small', 'trivial', 'are', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'already', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'action-filled', 'plot', 'not', 'needed', 'looking', 'something', 'well', 'done', 'dark', 'gritty', 'disturbing', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'watch', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'give', 'one', 'chance']",N/A

This is a nice, well structure slice of life and coming of age tale with small but potent mystery at its heart. It's also a brave film, beautifully told with ample wit, lovable characters and emotional core that really delivers in the end. At times it's a little heart breaking but it's also ideally suited to the serious drama that's underlying the premise.It deals with history and assumptions that arise from that history and how it affects the survivors when the details get lost. It also addresses change and it's constant flow forward, and how to hang on when those changes prove troubling.I will say this is a story about a young woman in school and boy she gradually grows fond of, and he also falls for her. As time grows and their fondness is realized the secret histories they know little about begins to affect their relationship in profound ways. The only way to resolve these issues is to dig into their families' pasts.

1570290,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008M0UTRO,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Based on a serial graphic comic from the 1980s, ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" is a sweet and gentle Japanese anime drama set in 1963, right on the eve of that nation's hosting of the Tokyo Olympics.Voiced by Sarah Bolger in the English version, Umi is a high school girl whose mother is studying in America and whose father has apparently died in the Korean War. She currently lives in a boarding house run by her grandmother where she cooks the meals for the residents and her two younger sisters. Umi also raises flags everyday in the hope that her father, whose body has never been found, will find his way to her. Umi has also fallen for a cute boy, the publisher of the school newspaper, and, through him, she becomes instrumental in helping to save a clubhouse the philosophy geeks use for their meetings and which has been threatened with demolition by the higher-ups who are more interested in modernizing war-ravaged Japan than in holding onto relics of the past.Directed by Goro Miyazaki, ""Poppy Hill"" is an old-fashioned, no-fuss movie that deliberately avoids the CGI effects and hectic style of most modern animated movies. The use of cell-drawn animation yields an uncluttered palette that nicely matches the storyline. The characters' movements are fairly stiff and the facial expressions virtually nonexistent, but the background has a lovely watercolor appearance that captures the visual simplicity of an earlier era.The screenplay by  Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa lacks focus at times, but that actually adds to the movie's charm since we don't feel as if we're watching an overly contrived narrative designed to make points. As such, it's a movie that youngsters in particular will find reflective of their own concerns and lives, regardless of nationality.",4,Refreshingly simple anime film,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1772,"['Based', 'serial', 'graphic', 'comic', '1980s', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'drama', 'set', '1963', 'right', 'eve', 'nation', 'hosting', 'Tokyo', 'Olympics.Voiced', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'English', 'version', 'Umi', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'mother', 'studying', 'America', 'father', 'apparently', 'died', 'Korean', 'War', 'currently', 'boarding', 'house', 'run', 'grandmother', 'where', 'meals', 'residents', 'two', 'younger', 'sisters', 'Umi', 'also', 'flags', 'everyday', 'hope', 'father', 'body', 'never', 'been', 'found', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'Umi', 'also', 'fallen', 'cute', 'boy', 'publisher', 'school', 'newspaper', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'save', 'clubhouse', 'philosophy', 'geeks', 'use', 'meetings', 'been', 'threatened', 'demolition', 'higher-ups', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'modernizing', 'war-ravaged', 'Japan', 'holding', 'relics', 'past.Directed', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'old-fashioned', 'no-fuss', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'CGI', 'effects', 'hectic', 'style', 'most', 'modern', 'animated', 'movies', 'use', 'cell-drawn', 'animation', 'yields', 'uncluttered', 'palette', 'nicely', 'storyline', 'characters', 'movements', 'are', 'fairly', 'stiff', 'facial', 'expressions', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'background', 'lovely', 'watercolor', 'appearance', 'visual', 'simplicity', 'earlier', 'era.The', 'screenplay', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Keiko', 'Niwa', 'focus', 'times', 'actually', 'movie', 'charm', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'overly', 'contrived', 'narrative', 'designed', 'make', 'points', 'such', 'movie', 'youngsters', 'particular', 'will', 'find', 'reflective', 'own', 'concerns', 'lives', 'regardless', 'nationality']",N/A
1570291,A7FZ9X0B6QBS3,B008M0UTRO,Ronald E. Olivier,"[0, 0]","I was very unimpressed with the storyline after I watched this for the first time.  Fortunately, the second viewing was MUCH more rewarding.  Set in Japan after the 1964 Olympics (hard to believe that was 50 years ago),the film is about so much more than a budding romance.  As a group of students try to save an old frat house called 'The Latin Quarter' from destruction, the storylines weave together seamlessly at a relaxed pace that stresses development of the main characters, Umi and Shun.Along with the story, the film has a lot to say about the importance of history in culture.  There is a tension in the film surrounding the progress and renovation brought about by the Olympics, and the value of keeping our past alive, symbolized by the Latin Quarter.One other thing that stood out in my mind was how enjoyable the soundtrack was, really lending a nostalgic feel to the film.  In some cases, the music was more reminiscent of a time prior to 1964, but it served the film well nonetheless.  And, as has come to be expected from Studio Ghibli, the animation is absolutely breathtaking.  With the upcoming release of 'The Wind Rises' being supposedly Hayao Miyazaki's last feature film, one can only hope that his son Goro (who directed this film) will continue to make anime movies worthy of the Miyazaki name..  .  .  .",4,"Beautiful Ghibli film, but treads a bit close to being a 'chick flick'.",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1330,"['was', 'very', 'unimpressed', 'storyline', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'Fortunately', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'MUCH', 'more', 'rewarding', 'Set', 'Japan', '1964', 'Olympics', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'budding', 'romance', 'group', 'students', 'try', 'save', 'old', 'frat', 'house', 'called', ""'The"", 'Latin', 'Quarter', 'destruction', 'storylines', 'weave', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'Umi', 'Shun.Along', 'story', 'film', 'lot', 'say', 'importance', 'history', 'culture', 'tension', 'film', 'surrounding', 'progress', 'renovation', 'brought', 'about', 'Olympics', 'value', 'keeping', 'past', 'alive', 'symbolized', 'Latin', 'Quarter.One', 'other', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'mind', 'was', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'really', 'lending', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'film', 'cases', 'music', 'was', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'time', 'prior', '1964', 'served', 'film', 'well', 'nonetheless', 'come', 'be', 'expected', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'upcoming', 'release', ""'The"", 'Wind', 'Rises', 'being', 'supposedly', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'son', 'Goro', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'anime', 'movies', 'Miyazaki', 'name..']",N/A

1570301,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B008M0UTRO,Steven Aldersley,"[5, 10]","Fans of Studio Ghibli won't have had much chance to see From Up on Poppy Hill. It enjoyed a brief limited release in theaters a few months ago, but the Blu-ray release on September 3rd will allow many other fans to check it out. I've seen it twice over the past two days and I urge Ghibli fans to buy the Blu-ray.From Up on Poppy Hill looks like a Studio Ghibli film, and packs quite an emotional punch, but don't expect to see the fantasy element present in most of the studio's classics. This is more like Whisper of the Heart than Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The film is populated by good people doing good things, and there's not a villain in sight. It will appeal to anyone who remembers their childhood, school, young love, and friendship. Like most Ghibli films, it's full of great messages for us and our children.Umi Matsuzaki (Sarah Bolger) is an eleventh-grader, living in 1963 Yokohama; she takes care of her family and a few boarders while her mother is away studying in the US. She cooks and cleans while trying to maintain her good grades, and is a responsible young woman. One day in school, she meets Shun Kazama (Anton Yelchin). He performs a daredevil stunt to try to gain support for his campaign to save a clubhouse used by him and his friends. Umi and Shun form a friendship that is the heart of the film, but the story isn't quite so simple. This is not just a tale of teen romance; it's the story of a group of young people pulling together to achieve a common goal. Some of the twists are unexpected, and considerably more complicated than those found in typical animated fare.One of Umi's habits is to raise flags on the pole on her balcony to signal to ships passing in the harbor. I had better not reveal the reason for that, but it's far from trivial and will help you to empathize with her situation. Umi's world is constantly changing. Her small town has a real community feel, and it's common for people to be friendly and help one another in their daily lives. The bigger picture shows Tokyo preparing for the 1964 Olympics, so there's constant pressure to join modern society and leave behind some of the antiquated life that Umi is used to.One of the high points is seeing how the students work together to renovate their dirty old clubhouse, and the daring way in which Shun, Umi, and a friend attempt to get their message heard by someone who is actually in a position to make a difference.Some of the themes in From Up on Poppy Hill are pretty serious. I know that I have probably failed to capture the interest of many readers, because this is another Studio Ghibli film without significant conflict. Instead of an evil villain, we are shown some of the problems young people might face while growing up. One twist is heartbreaking, and I won't dare reveal it here. However, I will say that by the end of the film, the mood is extremely positive. Like all good dramas, there must be some challenges and heartbreak in order for us to appreciate the good things in life. When the film ended, I was smiling. I wish my world could be as idyllic and charming.I'm sure some of you are wondering about Goro Miyazaki's direction, and whether the future of Studio Ghibli is in good hands with Hayao Miyazaki's (72) retirement announced, and Toshio Suzuki (65) probably approaching the end of his career. Goro Miyazaki received plenty of criticism for Tales of Earthsea (2006), and openly admitted that he played it safe and didn't try to extend himself. From Up on Poppy Hill is a much stronger effort, and I hope it enables him to produce works of similar quality in the future. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay with Keiko Niwa, and I'm sure that it helps make the film feel familiar, and as warm as other Studio Ghibli entries.Many of the established Ghibli traits are present. I love that the female characters are so strong; something that Pixar could learn from. The importance of family, friendship, and mutual respect is always on display. The young and the old both have a place in the world, and they care about one another. Notice also the scenes involving food. I can remember so many similar scenes from other Ghibli films. Perhaps they are present to remind us how good something as simple as a pleasant meal can be? There's also an umbrella; it's amazing how often they appear in Ghibli's other worlds.Before I close, I must mention the Blu-ray special edition. Unlike most US Ghibli releases, this one is released by GKids and Cinedigm. The picture quality is wonderful, and the audio features both US and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 mixes. I was startled a couple of times by the immersive output from the rear speakers. The package includes a DVD, so you can introduce a new fan to Ghibli, and a rather informative 16-page booklet. Hayao Miyazaki talks about how the project originated, and Goro talks about his work on the film. The special features total more than three hours, and include the film in storyboard form, plus interviews with Goro Miyazaki and Hayao Miyazaki. For those who like to watch the film in the original language, the subtitles are white and unobtrusive.Ghibli fans, or anyone who cares about life, people, and good storytelling, should not miss this release.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Goro Miyazaki delivers a heartwarming tale,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,5267,"['Fans', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'much', 'chance', 'see',

This time Haiyo Miyazaki's son Goro takes the directors chair for the second time to bring us 'From Up On Poppy Hill'. You could probably think of it as a long lost follow up to 'Grave of the Fireflies'. While that film took place during World War 2, 'From Up On Poppy Hill' takes place in the early 1960's the time when Japan had finally been set free from American occupation and was taking its first steps towards being the powerful democracy it is today.The film takes place when Japan is about to host it's first of many Olympic games and to do so the city of Tokyo has to tear up a piece of its past to make way for the future. However that may not be so easy as almost an entire high school does not want to let go of a historical landmark they have been using as their after school club house. It is also the way that two young people discover a deep love for one another and uncover a few links to their own pasts as well. Some of which can shake the very fabric of their friendship.'From Up Poppy Hill' is not one of those epic films, but it makes you feel good and young again.

Based on other reviews, I would advise potential buyers to be cautious about the quality of the specific DVD being sold.)From Up on Poppy Hill (Kokuriko-zaka Kara) is nothing less than the best Studio Ghibli film since 2004's Howl's Moving Castle, possibly even since 2001's Spirited Away. Directed by Goro Miyazaki from a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa, From Up on Poppy Hill is based on a 1980 serialized Japanese graphic novel of the same name, illustrated by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsuro Sayama. The animation is lush and lovingly detailed, and the story an engaging tale of two high school students dealing with first love and with the importance of the past, both on a cultural and institutional level, and, as it turns out, on an intimately personal level as well.The story is set in 1963 in the port town of Yokahama in Japan in 1963 against the backdrop of the country getting ready to host the 1964 Olympic Games. Umi Matsuzaki is a sixteen-year-old high school girl living with her family and a couple of boarders in a house on top of a hill that overlooks the harbor. Her mother Ryoko, a medical professor, is currently away, studying abroad in the United States. In her mother's absence, Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings, Sora and Riku, and her grandmother, Hana. The boarders, both women, are an artistic college student named Sachiko Hirokouji and a doctor-in-training named Miki Hokuto. Umi's father, we learn, died many years ago when Umi was quite young, killed when his cargo ship hit a mine during the Korean War. As a kind of ritual to his memory, each morning Umi raises a set of naval signal flags up a flagpole outside the house with the message ""Safe Voyage"" to the ships out in the harbor.One day, an anonymous poem about the flags appears in the school newspaper. Curious, Umi decides to visit the school newspaper to ask who wrote the poem. The school paper is published out of an office located in a delapidated old building on the school grounds nick-named ""the Latin Quarter"" which houses all of the school clubs and has done so for as long as anyone can remember. But the Latin Quarter is now endangered by a plan to tear it down and replace it with a brand new building as part of Japan's modernization program to put on its best face for the upcoming Olympics, a move that has the students divided between those who want everything to be new and those who have an emotional attachment to the old and traditional, which they see embodied by their beloved Latin Quarter.On the way to visit the paper's office, Umi, accompanied by Sora, witness another student, Shun Kazama, performing a daredevil stunt to get publicity for the paper's ""Save the Latin Quarter"" drive. Umi is somewhat less than impressed by Shun's feat, but when she reaches the school paper office, she discovers that Shun, along with his friend Shiro Mizunuma who is the student government president, is the publisher of the school paper (and also, as she learns later, the author of the poem about her flags). Before she knows it, Umi is volunteering to help, first with the paper, preparing stencils, and then soon with their drive to save the Latin Quarter. She suggests that the best way to start would be to give the building a complete facelift, first with a thorough cleaning and then with much needed repairs and a fresh paint job. In this cause, Umi enlists the school's female student population, which in turn gets the male students guickly - and enthusiastically - on board.As they work together, Umi and Shun start feeling a growing attraction to each other. But the path of young love is rarely smooth, and theirs is thrown for a bigger curve than most when Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men, one of whom is her deceased father. But Shun has seen this photograph before, and suddenly a past neither of them were previously aware of begins to assert itself, complicating their budding relationship before it's properly begun. From that point on, the twin plot threads - of Umi and Shun and their pasts and of the students' crusade to save the Latin Quarter - are subtly intertwined. To say more would be to spoil the story.The animation in From Up on Poppy Hill is wonderfully detailed and executed in so many ways it would take a long time to properly describe them. The Latin Quarter clubhouse is a marvel of clutter, completely believable as the sort of old place whose every corner would be filled with incredibly varied bric-a-brac due to the myriad kind of clubs it houses (and going for years without a proper cleaning because that's not typically a high priority with most boys).Another thing I particularly liked were the subtle changes in the backgrounds as evening approached in some scenes; you could feel the sun slowly beginning to set with the ever-so-slight lengthening of shadows and changes in the hue of the sky. Equal detail was given to the way the characters moved and the things they did. In one scene, when Umi is preparing dinner, she pours the rice into a square box, then carefully runs a flat edge over the top to level it so that the amount measured out is exact. It's a minor detail not dwelled upon, but one of many similar ones that give the film a depth of reality rarely found in most animated films.Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful animation, engaging characters and truly first-class story-telling that never condescends to its audience.",5,A masterpiece of Miyazaki-style animation with an engaging story that transcends culture

1570309,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B008M0UTRO,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","Although ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" was not directed by renowned Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki (it was his son, Goro Miyazaki), he was responsible for the storyboards and screenplay, and as my nine-year-old daughter and I (both great Miyazaki fans) watched this yesterday, we could not help comparing this to ""Whisper of the Heart"" with its theme of teen angst and searching for one's identity. There's so much to appreciate here in terms of animation and storytelling.The story is set in Yokohama in 1963. Japan, after the devastation of WW II is preparing to host the Olympics. High schooler Umi lives with her grandmother who runs a boarding house. Umi's mom is in the US pursuing her studies, and Umi is depicted as a hardworking and dutiful daughter and granddaughter, going about her chores and attending to her studies. Umi misses her father, a naval officer whose supply ship sank during WW II. Every day, she puts up the flags to see if there will be some kind of response (the flags send messages). Unbeknown to Umi, another high schooler Shun, has noticed the flags and has even written a poem about it. This sets the stage for a meeting between the two and a friendship blossoms which turns into love. However, there is a family secret that might tear the two apart. The rest of the story deals with how Shun and Umi learn to come to terms with their circumstances.Having watched ""Whisper of the Heart"", I feel there are quite a few similarities here. Shun has a gift for writing, and in ""Whisper of the Heart"", the female character loves to compose song lyrics and also write. Through their writing, both characters are shown to evolve and get a sense of self-identity. In both stories, the young couples face challenges that they must overcome in order to strengthen their ties with each other. I think these stories with their themes of teen angst, alienation, and self-actualization, will appeal to mature tweens and young adults alike.The DVD set by Studio Ghibli comes with 2 DVDs: the first features the animated feature and the second contains bonus features that include the original Japanese version, feature length storyboards, celebrity cast recording featurette, interview with director Goro Miyazaki, music video, Yokohama featurette, and the original Japanese trailers and TV spots.",5,A poignant and engaging coming of age story by Studio Ghibli,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2309,"['From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'was', 'not', 'directed', 'renowned', 'Japanese', 'animator', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'was', 'son', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'was', 'responsible', 'storyboards', 'screenplay', 'nine-year-old', 'daughter', 'great', 'Miyazaki', 'fans', 'watched', 'yesterday', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'comparing', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'theme', 'teen', 'angst', 'searching', 'one', 'identity', 'so', 'much', 'appreciate', 'here', 'terms', 'animation', 'storytelling.The', 'story', 'set', 'Yokohama', '1963', 'Japan', 'devastation', 'WW', 'II', 'preparing', 'host', 'Olympics', 'High', 'schooler', 'Umi', 'grandmother', 'who', 'boarding', 'house', 'Umi', 'mom', 'US', 'pursuing', 'studies', 'Umi', 'depicted', 'hardworking', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'going', 'chores', 'attending', 'studies', 'Umi', 'father', 'naval', 'officer', 'supply', 'ship', 'sank', 'WW', 'II', 'day', 'up', 'flags', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'response', 'flags', 'send', 'messages', 'Unbeknown', 'Umi', 'high', 'schooler', 'Shun', 'noticed', 'flags', 'even', 'written', 'poem', 'stage', 'meeting', 'two', 'friendship', 'blossoms', 'love', 'However', 'family', 'might', 'tear', 'two', 'apart', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'how', 'Shun', 'Umi', 'learn', 'come', 'terms', 'circumstances.Having', 'watched', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'feel', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'similarities', 'here', 'Shun', 'gift', 'writing', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'female', 'character', 'loves', 'compose', 'song', 'lyrics', 'also', 'write', 'writing', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'evolve', 'get', 'sense', 'self-identity', 'stories', 'young', 'couples', 'face', 'challenges', 'must', 'overcome', 'order', 'strengthen', 'ties', 'other', 'think', 'stories', 'themes', 'teen', 'angst', 'alienation', 'self-actualization', 'will', 'appeal', 'mature', 'tweens', 'young', 'adults', 'alike.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', '2', 'DVDs', 'first', 'animated', 'feature', 'second', 'contains', 'bonus', 'include', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'feature', 'length', 'storyboards', 'celebrity', 'cast', 'recording', 'featurette', 'interview', 'director', 'Goro', 'Miyazaki', 'music', 'video', 'Yokohama', 'featurette', 'original', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots']",N/A
