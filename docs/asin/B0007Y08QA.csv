894609,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007Y08QA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 4]","I would like to say that I hated the film Monster.  You are probably wondering what that has to do with the film The Machinist?  Let me tell you.  In Monster, Charlize Theron goes ""ugly"" in attempt to capture the character that she is trying to portray.  She wins an Oscar, not because her acting was good, but because people could not believe that was Theron so ""ugly"".  From that point on I was a strong believer that you could dress up the actor all you want, but deep inside it is still the same actor.  Charlize Theron ugly is still Charlize Theron.  So, needless to say, I was skeptical at first to see how Christian Bale would do with dropping 65 pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik, an insomniac factory worker with a forgotten secret.  Was it going to be like Monster and spend two hours watching Christian Bale play a skinny Christian Bale?  I my utter surprise, it was not.  Bale, by dropping the weight, accomplished what so many ""physical"" actors can only dream about.  He gave depth, a physical persona, and a very frightening image to this character that took us away from Bale the actor.  Throughout the entire film, I could only see Trevor Reznik.  Perhaps it was a trick.  Perhaps Bale couldn't do the character otherwise, but for me, a viewer of the film, it helped create the dark ambiance that shook me to the core until the very end.My first applaud goes to director Brad Anderson for his simplistic, yet chaotic filming of this story.  Throughout the entire viewing, you are given this impression that something is going over your head.  You know that you are missing something and that the ending will shock and amaze you.  For anyone that has grown up in the Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense era, you can smell this film coming from a mile away, but it is the way that Anderson provides the story to you that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  After a vast array of ""shock-ending"" films, it is hard to come up with a new, original, and tactful idea that will keep audiences talking long after the credits roll.  Anderson has done a brave new job with The Machinist in providing that chatter after the film.  He showed us his darker side in Session 9 and he doesn't go too commercial in this film.  It is haunting, riveting, and challenging all at the same time ... to say that about a director's work is rare today.The acting is superb.  Jennifer Jason Leigh again gives us the beauty of grime and the ability to transform this very small character into a powerhouse role.  She gives so much emotion and humility to her character, which makes you forget (or perhaps not notice) what her true ""profession"" is.  There are also so many secrets about her that you cannot help but sit around after the film and think of her story outside of how she reacts with Reznik.  I don't know if anyone else did this, but I couldn't keep her out of my mind.  She was amazing.  Then you have John Sharian playing the polar opposite of Bale in such a frightening way that he nearly steals every scene away from Bale.  He is huge, bulky, and rather transfixing as perhaps the living conscious of Bale.  Following Leigh's feminine role is that of Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n playing Marie.  This very unknown character that seems to be the only smiling face in the film.  She gives comfort to not only Reznik, but also to us.  She is our guiding light at the end of this dark tunnel that surprises you to the very end.  Then you have everyone that is around Reznik like his co-workers, his landlady, and even himself.  A powerful cast that is accentuated with a bold and original story.Finally, I would like to say that outside of the talented acting and bold direction, you actually have an amazing story.  I know I have mentioned this several times, but you cannot walk away from this story without discussing it thoroughly with friends and family afterwards.  It is like a cinematic drug that you cannot get enough of.  I thought that with my second viewing that I would have already seen all that I could, but instead I was provided with moments, mere glimpses of truth, that I just completely missed during the first viewing.  It was inspirational to see such dark, yet powerful storytelling to come from a nearly recycled Hollywood.  Sure, there are elements of Fight Club, Sixth Sense, and Usual Suspects all mixed into this film, but Anderson gives it his own flare.  Bale goes to a new extreme proving that he can manage both big box office hits, and these itty-bitty gems.  The Machinist is a refreshing moment for both you and your DVD player.Overall, I really thought this was one of the most powerful films to come out of Hollywood this year.  I would love to see Bale take home a golden statue for his portrayal in this film, but I noticed that Charlize Theron is going to be ""ugly"" again in North Country, so I think he will be passed up again.  Bale is becoming such a strong actor because he is constantly working with the quintessential directors in Hollywood.  Not the Bruckheimers, not the Bays, but with these smaller directors that are not afraid to take a leap of faith with Bale.  I have not been disappointed with his work, and I think all that watch this film are going to walk away and see Bale as more than just the ""man in a bat suit"", but instead a strong voiced actor that can tackle any role.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,I'd like to report a hit-and-run.,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,5390,"['would', 'like', 'say', 'hated', 'film', 'Monster', 'are', 'probably',

Who is he really? And who keeps leaving those sticky notes on his fridge?

Anyone with a weak heart would die of fright on that ride.The horror of this character's deathly thin appearance sets the scene for the horrors of his encounters.

894612,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0007Y08QA,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[3, 3]","""The Machinist"" is not an easy film to watch, as one sees Trevor Resnik (Christian Bale) descend into hell, plagued by visions we don't know the source of, until the pieces fit together in the final section of the film. There are ""signposts"" along the way...an intersection with a water tower, a coffee shop at the airport, a red car...and many roads that end in right/left choices. He keeps turning left (sinistro) as he goes down the rabbit hole of madness. Rather like Dostoyevsky's Roskolnikov in ""Crime and Punishment,"" we are watching his mental state affect his physical world, as the phantoms of his conscience become real.Another reason this film is not easy viewing is looking at Christian Bale, who lost 63 Lbs. for the part of Trevor. He is skeletal, and no other actor has gone to such lengths to change his physical appearance for a film. His performance is excellent, and his reptilian look adds to the mystery of the plot, which includes his claim that he has not slept in a year. Famous in her native land, Spanish actress Aitana Sanchez-Gij&oacute;n is wonderful as Marie the waitress, and Jennifer Jason Leigh is superb as Stevie, a ""heart of gold"" prostitute who befriends Trevor. In smaller parts there is Michael Ironside as Miller, who works in the machine shop, and John Sharian as the bizarre Ivan.The cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez, mostly in steely shades of blue and gray, is extremely effective. Shot in Barcelona (for financial reasons, because no US studio would put up money for the film), the story by first-time scriptwriter Scott Kosar is supposed to take place in a West Coast city. By keeping most of the action in an old machine shop and a warehouse, the film's locations have the look of any dilapidated part of town, anywhere in the world.Directed by Brad Anderson, this strange but sometimes oddly beautiful film is not going to appeal to everyone, but is sure to become a cult favorite. It needs more than one viewing, so that one can see it after having put the puzzle together, and appreciate it for its cinematic skill, which is almost deserving of a 5 star rating. The score by Roque Ba&ntilde;os has the necessary eerie quality, and total running time is 102 minutes. DVD extras include audio commentary by director Anderson, ""The Machinist: Breaking the Rules,"" 8 deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.

Yeah, it's cheap, I know, but I saw it with pretty much a blank slate and I think that's absolutely the best way to do. You must see this movie. Then come back and read some of these reviews, like I did (some of the reviewers give away WAY too much, I felt).This movie is a feast for all the senses. Christian Bale plays a frighteningly emaciated industrial worker lives like an apparition in a washed out, grimy world. This reminds me of Orwell's vision of postwar England as portrayed in ""1984"" - grim, bleak, washed-out, bleary-eyed, ephemeral and unreal, like being stuck in a perpetual hangover in an old war zone. For a while this movie was billed as a ""horror"" movie but it's really psychological horror that manifests itself in a few conventionally horrific ways. It does have similarities to ""Sessions 9"" as others have pointed out, by the same director. Internal angst and self-discovery juxtaposed against a decaying old backdrop.This movie is like what Henry James might have written if he were alive today! The cinematography is great, the settings are excellently done and quite creepy and unsettling, even as they are familiar. And the music! The music is great, it's about time someone gave some love to the theremin again. The acting is top-notch from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale. A scene-grabber for sure.Every facet of the movie was executed in a professionally frightening and somewhat hallucinatory manner. But don't be fooled by that term. There really is very little David Lynch and such style in this movie, in my opinion. It does more showing and less telling, yes, but it does so in a more straight-ahead approach with less cloying. If the movie has a weakness, which it may very well not, it's the ending; however, I congratulate the writers, because this was an extraordinarily difficult movie to write a conclusion to that doesn't cheat the audience or leave things too open-ended (the famous ""draw your own conclusions"" ending that give critics something to rave about and writers and easy out).In conclusion, ""The Machinist"" deserves 5 stars on virtually every level, and as a whole. Watch it as soon as possible, I don't think you'll be disappointed, and I'd be surprised if anyone feels ""cheated"" like you do with some ambitious movies.",5,Stop reading reviews and just watch the movie!,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2401,"['so', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'write', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'away', 'Yeah', 'cheap', 'know', 'saw', 'pretty', 'much', 'blank', 'slate', 'think', 'absolutely', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'Then', 'come', 'back', 'read', 'reviews', 'did', 'reviewers', 'give', 'away', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'felt', '.This', 'movie', 'feast', 'senses', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'frighteningly', 'emaciated', 'industrial', 'worker', 'lives', 'apparition', 'washed', 'out', 'grimy', 'world', 'Orwell', 'vision', 'postwar', 'England', 'portrayed', '1984', 'grim', 'bleak', 'washed-out', 'bleary-eyed', 'ephemeral', 'unreal', 'being', 'stuck', 'perpetual', 'hangover', 'old', 'war', 'zone', 'while', 'movie', 'was', 'billed', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'psychological', 'horror', 'few', 'conventionally', 'horrific', 'ways', 'have', 'similarities', 'Sessions', '9', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'same', 'director', 'Internal', 'angst', 'self-discovery', 'juxtaposed', 'decaying', 'old', 'backdrop.This', 'movie', 'what', 'Henry', 'James', 'might', 'have', 'written', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'cinematography', 'great', 'settings', 'are', 'excellently', 'done', 'quite', 'creepy', 'unsettling', 'even', 'are', 'familiar', 'music', 'music', 'great', 'time', 'someone', 'gave', 'love', 'theremin', 'again', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'everyone', 'involved', 'especially', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'scene-grabber', 'sure.Every', 'facet', 'movie', 'was', 'executed', 'professionally', 'frightening', 'somewhat', 'hallucinatory', 'manner', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'term', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'David', 'Lynch', 'such', 'style', 'movie', 'opinion', 'more', 'showing', 'less', 'telling', 'yes', 'so', 'more', 'straight-ahead', 'approach', 'less', 'cloying', 'movie', 'weakness', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'ending', 'however', 'congratulate', 'writers', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'difficult', 'movie', 'write', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'audience', 'leave', 'things', 'too', 'open-ended', 'famous', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'ending', 'give', 'critics', 'something', 'rave', 'about', 'writers', 'easy', 'out', '.In', 'conclusion', 'Machinist', '5', 'stars', 'virtually', 'level', 'whole', 'Watch', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'anyone', 'cheated', 'do', 'ambitious', 'movies']",N/A

You know the drill - lots of black, white, gray and blue, steel, concrete, chrome, and glass, no natural materials, no warmth, no light, only the suffering protagonist.The Machinist falls neatly into this category, but unlike so many of them, it has a point, it is going somewhere, there is an ""aha"" moment that makes sense of this descent into hell.  That's worth knowing because the world you enter is dark indeed.  Trevor, the Machinist, cannot sleep, and it is killing him.  As has been reported elsewhere, Christian Bale shed 63 pounds to play this part, 63 pounds he didn't have to spare.  He looks cadaverous, haunted.As we are drawn into his private and desperate existence we wonder, as he does, if he is really losing his mind completely or just having a terribly difficult time.  Both Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon are wonderful, offering tantalizing glimmers of hope.  Part of the intrigue of this movie is that we experience Trevor's struggles as he does, and we begin to suspect some undercurrent just as he does, our level our understanding never gets ahead of his.  We wonder, as he does, if he is the victim of some truly devious conspiracy, there seems to be so much evidence.Then we wonder, as he does, if the truth might be something less spectacular, but far more chilling, much closer to home.  Trevor's world is so extreme, and so relentlessly painful, that it can only be explained by something ghastly, something unthinkable.  It is.  There is nothing funny or warm to be found here, but The Machinist is a brilliant film featuring an astounding performance by Christian Bale.

Christian Bale literally put his life on the line for this role as he shed 65 pounds and looks like he is about to die at any moment. Even more startling that his gaunt appearance is how believable he is as a man tormented by what he does and doesn't know about himself.--WHY IT STAYS WITH YOU: Because underneath the stark, ugly colors and clever departures from reality is a gritty, brutal truth about what guilt can do to a person. Even though part of me  doesn't think it's a good idea for an actor or actress to lose so much weight, I can't see how it could have been done any other way.

So, of course, critics and viewers seem to be lukewarm or downright critical of it.  Maybe it was too dark for them.  Maybe it was too confusing.  Maybe a protagonist that looks like a walking skeleton was too much for them to handle.  Still, the main criticisms I've read about 'The Machinist' are the very reasons people like myself love it.  The 2-star review from ""A. Vegan"" says it all:""The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on. The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over.""That's not really a valid criticism since that was kind of the point: to figure out what is going on.  You truly are immersed into the shoes of the protagonist (Christian Bale, in a career defining performance.)  The viewer feels just as lost, confused, and helpless as sleepy, skinny Trevor Reznik does.  Which, as my vegan friend didn't quite grasp, is part of the point of this film and is the main storytelling device.  You are supposed to feel the pain and anguish of a man who has not slept in a year and is slowly but surely losing his mind.  You may or may not enjoy the plot and subject matter, but you cannot deny that the film succeeds wonderfully in what it is attempting.Throughout the film, I found myself asking many of the same questions Reznik was asking himself: Why can't he sleep?  What's the deal with the mysterious Ivan?  Are his co-workers really messing with him or is Trevor just paranoid?  Why is it always 1:30 when he looks at a clock?  How do the hooker and the waitress fit into everything?  Above all else....what's in the fridge?  Thankfully most, if not all, of your questions are answered in the spectacular ending that makes all of the puzzle pieces fit together nicely.  It will surprise you, but not in the typical Hollywood gimmicky ""Gotcha!"" kind of way (M. Night Shamalyan, I'm looking at you.)  It is both surprising and satisfying.If you can't handle movies where the plot isn't spoon fed to you and you're pretty much in the dark until the last 5 minutes, then you probably won't enjoy 'The Machinist'.

894619,A1X1N1RHFIOCRF,B0007Y08QA,arthistoryguy,"[1, 1]","The first 15 minutes of Brad Anderson's dark dissension into the inexplicable realm of psychosis, called ""The Machinist,"" will intoxicate you with shear disbelief... disbelief that actor Christian Bale has whittled his already lean frame down 63 pounds to become a true walking skeleton (weighing in at just 120 pounds).  Never before has an actor gone to such lengths to fill a role -- most recently Ren&eacute;e Zellweger gained weight for her role as Bridget Jones, and Tom Hanks gained and lost 50 pounds for 2000's ""Cast Away,""  but Bale takes the cake (or rather, passed on the cake).The film itself is as dark and grim as Bale's body.  His withered body represents what can happen to a man that hasn't slept for a year.  It's the film's driving ambition to keep the reasons for Trevor Reznik's (Bale's) physical and mental declivity a secret, until the very end when all the strange behavior becomes clear.Director Anderson does a fine job depicting a boundless downfall with intriguing support and detail.  As a factory machinist, Trevor Reznik's fatigued mind and body is a means for trouble to happen and an invitation for catastrophe.  When a fellow worker is maimed by fault of Reznik, the dark playing field of paranoia rears itself as he finds his fellow workers closing in on him... or so it seems.  The film loses its fluidity and becomes more ridged and seamed-together (like a patchwork quilt of images) that make less and less sense as it rolls on, until the culmination and climax gives way to the truth.  With such a pristine and tightly controlled climax, we don't mind the discombobulating that precedes it.The score is catchy and similar to Hitchcock films of old -- and Anderson points out such on the DVD's extras.  In fact, the whole film screams Hitchcock, but in small enough doses that the movie avoids becoming a pastiche.  Rather, this film is what Hitchcock may have evolved into creating today if he were immortal (and in many ways he is).The film, though strong, has its flaws, like lack of supporting character development.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a convincing prostitute (I mean this as a compliment), Stevie, who is strong and nimble though vulnerable.  She doesn't transcend being a casual acquaintance when she could have played a more pivotal role, perhaps advancing the plot that seems to lull at times and focus only on our leading man.  Some back-story could have been expanded upon to better elevate the expectations that build, and truly depend, on the final climax.  In the end, Anderson and Bale do well to include all the ingredients for a wallop of an ending.Grade: B-",4,Bale Goes Rail Thin With Big Results,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2622,"['first', '15', 'minutes', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'dark', 'dissension', 'inexplicable', 'realm', 'psychosis', 'called', 'Machinist', 'will', 'intoxicate', 'shear', 'disbelief', 'disbelief', 'actor', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'whittled', 'already', 'lean', 'frame', 'down', '63', 'pounds', 'become', 'true', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'weighing', 'just', '120', 'pounds', 'Never', 'actor', 'gone', 'such', 'lengths', 'fill', 'role', 'most', 'recently', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'gained', 'weight', 'role', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'gained', 'lost', '50', 'pounds', '2000', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Bale', 'cake', 'rather', 'passed', 'cake', '.The', 'film', 'dark', 'grim', 'Bale', 'body', 'withered', 'body', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'man', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'film', 'driving', 'ambition', 'keep', 'reasons', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Bale', 'physical', 'mental', 'declivity', 'secret', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'strange', 'behavior', 'becomes', 'clear.Director', 'Anderson', 'fine', 'job', 'depicting', 'boundless', 'downfall', 'intriguing', 'support', 'detail', 'factory', 'machinist', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'fatigued', 'mind', 'body', 'means', 'trouble', 'happen', 'invitation', 'catastrophe', 'When', 'fellow', 'worker', 'maimed', 'fault', 'Reznik', 'dark', 'playing', 'field', 'paranoia', 'rears', 'fellow', 'workers', 'closing', 'film', 'fluidity', 'more', 'ridged', 'seamed-together', 'patchwork', 'quilt', 'images', 'make', 'less', 'less', 'sense', 'culmination', 'climax', 'way', 'truth', 'pristine', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'discombobulating', 'it.The', 'score', 'catchy', 'similar', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'old', 'Anderson', 'points', 'out', 'such', 'DVD', 'extras', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'screams', 'Hitchcock', 'small', 'enough', 'doses', 'movie', 'becoming', 'pastiche', 'Rather', 'film', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'may', 'have', 'evolved', 'creating', 'today', 'were', 'immortal', 'many', 'ways', '.The', 'film', 'strong', 'flaws', 'lack', 'supporting', 'character', 'development', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'convincing', 'prostitute', 'mean', 'compliment', 'Stevie', 'who', 'strong', 'nimble', 'vulnerable', ""n't"", 'transcend', 'being', 'casual', 'acquaintance', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'more', 'pivotal', 'role', 'perhaps', 'advancing', 'plot', 'lull', 'times', 'only', 'leading', 'man', 'back-story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'better', 'elevate', 'expectations', 'build', 'truly', 'depend', 'final', 'climax', 'end', 'Anderson', 'Bale', 'do', 'well', 'include', 'ingredients', 'wallop', 'ending.Grade', 'B-']",N/A

In my case... well, I was lost by the conclusion because I didn't understand what actually happened. I didn't understand the ending.To put it another way- throughout the film you witness unusual events, and eventually the puzzle pieces slowly unravel a little bit at a time.Christian Bale's character is really convincing and delivers perfect edge of your seat suspense. You keep wondering if he's losing his mind because of his evergrowing refusal to eat any food resulting in his body growing skinnier and alarmingly weaker by the day, and where the hangman parts of the storyline are heading (you'll understand what I mean when you watch it). You see, Bale's character would return home from work and constantly see hangman drawing on his refrigerator door, and he'd need to fill in the letters and put the body parts on the hangman in order to solve the clues.I have to admit, I really didn't get the ending. I don't want to spoil the puzzle pieces leading up to the conclusion because it's inappropriate to ruin storylines for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask a question in the next paragraph pertaining to the storyline, and I warn everybody who hasn't seen the movie yet- do NOT read this next part of my review because it's a spoiler-My main question is- who WAS that bald headed guy (John Sharian's character) who'd occasionally make an appearance?

To say that he is ""thin"" is an understatement.  Even when you're prepared for it, it's still shocking.Trevor works a blue collar job as a machinist.  He's the kind of guy who knows all the rules and regulations and everyone is a little annoyed with him for that.  Things are going okay until he causes an accident at work that leaves one of his colleagues without an arm.At this point, Trevor meets a mysterious character named Ivan, another worker at the plant, who nobody else seems to have met or even seen.  Is Trevor just hallucinating from his lack of sleep?  Or is there a consipiracy among everyone to try to mess with his head?  Trevor suspects (not unreasonably) that the other workers want to get rid of him due to his moment of negligence.  Could they be lying about not knowing Ivan?The film does a good job of leaving clues for Trevor and the audience to figure out.  Little Post-It notes show up on Trevor's refrigerator, the most mysterious of which is a game of ""hangman"" with six letters.  Solving this puzzle is a big part of finding out what's going on.Beneath Trevor's desire to find out about Ivan is the ""big question"" of why Trevor can't sleep or eat, and Ivan seems to be a key to finding that out as well.All in all, this is a pretty well-made suspense thriller.  It loses steam at parts, mainly because when the audience suspects that Trevor is, beyound a doubt crazy, we don't identify with him as much as when we believe he could be right.  Still, the original screenplay, combined with good directing make this a great film to look at.

894637,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007Y08QA,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","This performance by Christian Bale would be hard to match. His acting is superb as he plays the role of Trevor, a machinist who has not been able to sleep for year and is only beginning to put the pieces together to understand why he is mentally falling apart. I found this performance superior to his great work in American Psycho. In the Machinist he msut play a mentally ill man, unable to remember much of his past, unable to remember some trama that has resulted in his inability to sleep for over a year. His ability to transform his body to play this part was incredible.The plot is excellent in that as Trevor begins to sort out hallucination from reality and to sort out memories from living nightmares, so too is the audience trying to make sense of the film and the trama that may have stimulated Trevor's inability to sleep. Gradually we learn what is one of Trevor's waking dreams and what is reality starting to break through. However, even a series of waking dreams give clues to Trevor's true state of mind and the possible underlying reasons as to why he is paranoid and can't sleep for over a year. In other words, every hallucination, though it may be frighful, leads Trevor and the viewer toward some deeper truth about his condition.In the end, the viewer is not left hanging, the pieces do come together. It is a super psychological thriller.Before ending this review, I must comment on the superb cinematography and art direction in the film. When filming a psychological drama, camera angle, the interplay of dark and light, the framing of scenes to create anxiety or disqust are all part of the cinematographer's art.

The first scene of the movie makes no sense until the end of the movie, but everything finally does come together.Faced with a terrible event, Trevor develops into an hallucinatory, pathetic character in trying to deal with his guilt.  He starts off as a pleasant, intelligent guy, and his steady girl is also a likable, sympathetic person.  But when he steps out with a waitress and her son, we begin to see that something is wrong.  His weight issues, where he is 130 and losing day by day is also a flag that something has to be wrong.He manufactures people and occurrences that at first seem real, but he finally realizes that they are anything but real.Christian Bale gives an excellent performance in this movie and at its conclusion I found that I could feel for him in his torment.

Middleton,"[4, 4]","Christian Bale's performance as Trevor Reznik, a somnambulist with the appearance of a concentration camp refugee, defies criticism and deserves all the acclaim he has received across the world.Trevor Reznik is a character that is reminiscent of the strange characters of great literature, such as Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin in the novel, The Idiot, the saintly epileptic, Christ-like figure whose hallucinatory visions haunt the entire novel. Franze Kafka's Gregor Samsa also comes to mind in the novella, Metamorphosis, where he awakes one morning to find that he has transformed into a giant insect. All these characters move in and out of reality, as the line has blurred, existing in a world of sickness and suffering, struggling to attain some kind of insight, as to who they are and what is happening to them.The Machinist unfolds through the eyes of Reznik, a man who hasn't slept in a year, and whose only real friend is a prostitute, (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and as the story propels forward, the nightmare becomes more complicated, much more intense, as we the audience attempt to decipher Reznik's situation: are these hallucinations due to lack of sleep or something more sinister?A new character enters the scene - a dangerous looking man who claims to be working at Reznik's machine shop. The man appears on the shop floor one day and a terrible accident occurs because Reznik is distracted, a co-worker's arm is mutilated and severed in one of the machines. We discover later that this new character doesn't exist, however, Reznik later spots his car, and chases him through the streets of the city. (This scene reminded me of Dostoevsky's novel, The Double) Who is this strange man and why does he seem to know more about Reznik than Reznik himself?This film is a well-constructed psychological thriller, scattering clues throughout, where only at the end, do we discover the cause of Reznik's unique nightmare.One should also mention the soundtrack, an eerie, at times intense piece that underpins the tale, creating the desired, lingering effect. The film's images should remain with you long after its surprise ending.The Machinist would have to be one of the best films produced in 2004.",5,Dostoyevskian,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,2208,"['Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'somnambulist', 'appearance', 'concentration', 'camp', 'refugee', 'defies', 'criticism', 'acclaim', 'received', 'world.Trevor', 'Reznik', 'character', 'reminiscent', 'strange', 'characters', 'great', 'literature', 'such', 'Dostoyevsky', 'Prince', 'Myshkin', 'novel', 'Idiot', 'saintly', 'epileptic', 'Christ-like', 'figure', 'hallucinatory', 'visions', 'haunt', 'entire', 'novel', 'Franze', 'Kafka', 'Gregor', 'Samsa', 'also', 'mind', 'novella', 'Metamorphosis', 'where', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'transformed', 'giant', 'insect', 'characters', 'move', 'reality', 'line', 'blurred', 'existing', 'world', 'sickness', 'suffering', 'struggling', 'attain', 'kind', 'insight', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'happening', 'them.The', 'Machinist', 'unfolds', 'eyes', 'Reznik', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'prostitute', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'story', 'propels', 'forward', 'nightmare', 'more', 'complicated', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'audience', 'attempt', 'decipher', 'Reznik', 'situation', 'are', 'hallucinations', 'due', 'lack', 'sleep', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'new', 'character', 'scene', 'dangerous', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'working', 'Reznik', 'machine', 'shop', 'man', 'shop', 'floor', 'one', 'day', 'terrible', 'accident', 'Reznik', 'distracted', 'co-worker', 'arm', 'mutilated', 'severed', 'one', 'machines', 'discover', 'later', 'new', 'character', ""n't"", 'exist', 'however', 'Reznik', 'later', 'spots', 'car', 'streets', 'city', 'scene', 'reminded', 'Dostoevsky', 'novel', 'Double', 'Who', 'strange', 'man', 'why', 'seem', 'know', 'more', 'Reznik', 'Reznik', 'film', 'well-constructed', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'scattering', 'clues', 'where', 'only', 'end', 'do', 'discover', 'cause', 'Reznik', 'unique', 'nightmare.One', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'eerie', 'times', 'intense', 'piece', 'tale', 'creating', 'desired', 'lingering', 'effect', 'film', 'images', 'should', 'remain', 'long', 'surprise', 'ending.The', 'Machinist', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'produced', '2004']",N/A

While not a great film it certainly is loads better than the usual bilge Hollywood feeds the public. That director Brad Anderson (who directed Session 9) had to go to Barcelona, Spain to finance and film the picture says it all. The film stars Christian Bale (who lost over 60 lbs. for the role) as Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has not slept in a year and is wasting away physically. His only sources of comfort seem to be a prostitute named  Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he sleeps with, and an airport caf&eacute; waitress named Maria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), whom he confesses to. Then, one day, on a break at work, Trevor meets Ivan (John Sharian)- a bald biker dude with a Cajun accent, red sportscar, and a claw for a hand- after his left hand was mangled in an accident. Not long after Trevor accidentally causes the dismemberment of a co-worker named Miller (Michael Ironside) and is shunned at work. He seems to be losing his mind when no one believes him that the reason the accident occurred was because he was looking at Ivan- whom his bosses claim is not on the payroll....  Perhaps the only downsides to the film are Leigh's hooker with a heart of gold (although she does what little she can with the role) and the ending. As Trevor sleeps he dreams of the first few moments after the accident and then we get a fade out. There should have been something more definitive and climactic than merely Trevor's getting shuteye. The end feels almost tacked on, as if Kosar had no idea how to get out of the corner he painted his character into. Still, were this a Hollywood film there would have been car explosions, pedophilia, and many other overblown elements. The best thing for this screenplay was that it had to be made overseas. There are a number of excellent little points in the film, such as scattered Dostoevsky and Kafka references, Trevor's looking eerily like his Nine Inch Nails namesake Trent Reznor, Trevor's choosing to turn left, in the Route 666 kid's ride with Nicholas, and in the sewers, when he encounters forks in a road, until the end, where he turns himself in and turns right on the highway, which picks up on the mangled left hands of Miller and Ivan and other left aligned things in the film.

894650,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0007Y08QA,Cubist,"[2, 2]","After seeing Christian Bale all buff and beautiful in American Psycho, it comes as quite a shock to see the physical transformation he underwent for The Machinist. No trickery was done with CGI or make-up to convey his gaunt, emaciated appearance. It's a film that beautifully captures that timeless feeling when you can't sleep and yet are exhausted. His character is so desperate to sleep but is haunted by a past trauma that he can never escape no matter how hard he tries.Bale's physical transformation is so astonishing that it's almost distracting. He reportedly lost 63 lbs. for the role and it shows dramatically in his sunken eyes and skin stretched taunt over his rib cage and spine - he is literally skin and bones. It takes the first 30 minutes of the movie to get acclimatized to his presence. Bale does a great job of showing Reznik unraveling and becoming paranoid. All he wants to do is sleep but his mind won't let him. The actor brings his trademark intensity as he plays a man coming apart at the seams.Like Lost Highway, The Machinist features a protagonist who is not to be trusted because he could be imagining everything, creating his own reality featuring a mystery right out of a film noir. Like Lynch's film and Memento, The Machinist is a fascinating whodunit about perception, a cinematic jigsaw puzzle that we must put together along with the protagonist, someone who can't or is unwilling to accept reality and chooses to remember things his own way.There is an audio commentary by Brad Anderson. He talks at length about the challenges of shooting an independent film in Barcelona, Spain. Anderson comes across as well-spoken and intelligent in this solid commentary.""The Machinist: Breaking the Rules"" is not your typical press kit fluff featurette. Bale saw his weight loss as a victory because he completely resembled his character as written. This is an excellent look at the making of this movie done in the same style and manner of pacing that mirrors the motion picture itself.Also included are eight deleted scenes. While they would have added to the overall atmosphere of the movie, it is pretty obvious why they were cut as they really don't add anything terribly significant to the picture.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",4,A cinematic jigsaw puzzle,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2271,"['seeing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'buff', 'beautiful', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quite', 'shock', 'see', 'physical', 'transformation', 'underwent', 'Machinist', 'trickery', 'was', 'done', 'CGI', 'make-up', 'convey', 'gaunt', 'emaciated', 'appearance', 'film', 'beautifully', 'timeless', 'feeling', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'yet', 'are', 'exhausted', 'character', 'so', 'desperate', 'sleep', 'haunted', 'past', 'trauma', 'can', 'never', 'escape', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'tries.Bale', 'physical', 'transformation', 'so', 'astonishing', 'almost', 'distracting', 'reportedly', 'lost', '63', 'lbs', 'role', 'dramatically', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'skin', 'stretched', 'taunt', 'rib', 'cage', 'spine', 'literally', 'skin', 'bones', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'get', 'acclimatized', 'presence', 'Bale', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'Reznik', 'unraveling', 'becoming', 'paranoid', 'do', 'sleep', 'mind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'actor', 'trademark', 'intensity', 'man', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams.Like', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'Machinist', 'protagonist', 'who', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'could', 'be', 'imagining', 'everything', 'creating', 'own', 'reality', 'featuring', 'mystery', 'right', 'film', 'noir', 'Lynch', 'film', 'Memento', 'Machinist', 'fascinating', 'whodunit', 'perception', 'cinematic', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'must', 'put', 'together', 'protagonist', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'unwilling', 'accept', 'reality', 'remember', 'things', 'own', 'way.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'length', 'challenges', 'shooting', 'independent', 'film', 'Barcelona', 'Spain', 'Anderson', 'across', 'well-spoken', 'intelligent', 'solid', 'commentary', 'Machinist', 'Breaking', 'Rules', 'not', 'typical', 'press', 'kit', 'fluff', 'featurette', 'Bale', 'saw', 'weight', 'loss', 'victory', 'completely', 'resembled', 'character', 'written', 'excellent', 'look', 'making', 'movie', 'done', 'same', 'style', 'manner', 'pacing', 'mirrors', 'motion', 'picture', 'itself.Also', 'included', 'are', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'terribly', 'significant', 'picture.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
894651,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B0007Y08QA,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 5]","It's a shame to me that this film didn't turn out any better.  Christian Bale's performance alone deserves a better all around film.  As Trevor Reznik, Bale delivers a knock out performance as a man at the end of his rope.  Having not slept in over a year Trevor has lost extreme amounts of weight, his weight now down to nearly 120lbs.  Not only is his weight shedding but his mind is fleeting him as well.  He's seeing things, believing things, being haunted by things that may or may not even exist and Christian portrays this perfectly.The problems (in the film) start to spring up with the introduction of Ivan (John Sharian), a man who claims to work at the factory in which Trevor works himself, yet no one else appears to know him.  It's not just the inclusion of such a character but the overall horrific acting on the part of John Sharian that ruins this film immensely.  It's the breed of overacting that makes an adult-film look like `Brokeback Mountain'.Trevor's life rapidly derails and falls apart from every angle, from his doomed relationship with call-girl Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh in a very convincing performance) to his flittering romance with Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), a young single mother who works in the diner he frequently visits.  His weight continues to drop and his paranoia continues to grow until he's convinced that everyone is trying to destroy him.  Watch this for Bale's performance and his performance alone, for while it promises a surprise ending it comes off more of a ""oh, figured they pull that trick"" and less of a ""wow, never saw that coming.""",3,Aside from Bale (and I'll add Leigh) this film is a disapointment of sorts...,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1595,"['shame', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'alone', 'better', 'film', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Bale', 'knock', 'out', 'performance', 'man', 'end', 'rope', 'Having', 'not', 'slept', 'year', 'Trevor', 'lost', 'extreme', 'amounts', 'weight', 'weight', 'now', 'down', 'nearly', '120lbs', 'Not', 'only', 'weight', 'shedding', 'mind', 'fleeting', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'things', 'believing', 'things', 'being', 'haunted', 'things', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'Christian', 'perfectly.The', 'problems', 'film', 'start', 'spring', 'up', 'introduction', 'Ivan', 'John', 'Sharian', 'man', 'who', 'work', 'factory', 'Trevor', 'yet', 'one', 'else', 'know', 'not', 'just', 'inclusion', 'such', 'character', 'overall', 'horrific', 'acting', 'part', 'John', 'Sharian', 'film', 'immensely', 'breed', 'overacting', 'adult-film', 'look', 'Brokeback', ""Mountain'.Trevor"", 'life', 'rapidly', 'derails', 'falls', 'apart', 'angle', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'call-girl', 'Stevie', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'flittering', 'romance', 'Marie', 'Aitana', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'young', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'diner', 'frequently', 'weight', 'drop', 'paranoia', 'grow', 'convinced', 'everyone', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Watch', 'Bale', 'performance', 'performance', 'alone', 'surprise', 'ending', 'more', 'oh', 'figured', 'pull', 'trick', 'less', 'wow', 'never', 'saw', 'coming']",N/A
894652,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007Y08QA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","If you like your movies dark, depressing, eerie, mysterious, and borderline insane, The Machinist should definitely be on your ""to see"" list.  In these days of sequel- and remake-itis, it's always a treat to find a movie that dares to be original and to walk a dark line all its own.  Director Brad Anderson and Christian Bale definitely get an A+ for effort here, but I don't think the ending is quite as effective as it could have been.  It's easy to cross the line when you're dancing in a dark and narrow place, and the movie went just a little too far into ""the whole world's crazy and everyone's out to get me"" (which, on a completely unrelated point, is my personal motto) territory before bringing everything into focus.  (That doesn't stop me from giving the film five stars, however - The Machinist is worlds better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days.)  Speaking of effort, I don't know what to say about Christian Bale - no Fat Albert to begin with - dropping 63 pounds in order to play the character of Trevor Reznik in this film.  He is painfully thin here; a few less pounds, and you could zoom him right through your copy machine and have all the Christian Bales you could want.  Why is his character so thin?  Well, he hasn't slept in a year, and that kind of wears on a fellow after a while.Trent is - you guessed it - a machinist.  It doesn't look like a great job, but he obviously makes a killing, as he leaves $20 tips every night at the diner and enjoys many an evening with a call girl who sort of becomes his girlfriend.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is about the only pretty thing you'll see in the 102 minutes of the film.  We first meet Trevor when he's approaching his breaking point.  The job of machinist can be quite hazardous, especially if you work with Trevor.  When a guy punches in with two arms and punches out with only one, the co-workers get a little restless.  Technically, it's Trevor's fault, but he was distracted by this seriously weird co-worker he had just recently met - a guy who, according to everyone else in the shop, doesn't even exist.  As you might expect, Trevor becomes rather obsessed about finding out who the guy is and what he wants.  As he goes increasingly cuckoo for cocoa puffs, his only links with sanity are Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the call girl and Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), his regular waitress at the airport caf&eacute;.The best way I can describe The Machinist is to suggest that it must be a lot like one of Tim Burton's dreams.  There's an oppressive pallor over the whole thing that seems to drain every single image of any color or vitality, and Trevor moves around rather wraith-like in his emaciated form.  The mystery of it all starts out with great strength, but I think the director just overplayed his hand a tiny bit - and, by doing so, made the ultimate ending somewhat (but not completely) predictable.  It's still a five-star effort all the way.  If you just want to forget the world and be entertained for an hour and a half, seek your pleasure elsewhere.  When you're ready to indulge the dark side of your personality and engage your mind at the same time, though, you could do much worse than settling yourself into a cocoon and entering the surreal world of The Machinist.

Cain and kin were dispatched to the East of Eden, and mankind has been adept at following their example in bringing the lash and levy against the cruel, the calculating, the wicked, the insolent, and the criminally stupid ever since.We have exiled our felons deep beneath the Earth, to toil in the Stygian darkness of mines or languish in the bone-littered dungeons of dank and hungry oubliettes. We have built towering prisons to hold the unwanted on forlorn spits of rock in the sea: hark the names of the most notorious---Rikers, Alcatraz, Devil's Island, the Chateau D'If.The Convict will suffer, yes, and pay his debt to Society, all in due course: but first we will confine and isolate him.And for all the stone, and sweat, and blood, and steel, iron portcullises and electric mag-lock gates, the Hole and Death Row and the Green Mile, the ultimate prison is still born of our own design: the human mind.Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) has one problem too many: he hasn't slept in a year. He's shucking off the pounds at a rate that would boggle Jenny Craig; he's drifting down to 120 and dropping, dropping, dropping.And it gets worse: he can't trust his own thoughts, his senses, the things he glimpses, the horror he fancies he sees. He is pursued---but by whom? He remembers dragging a body, shoving it rudely down into a drainage ditch---but whose? And to what end? He claims that his shadowy watchers would come for him, if only they knew who he was.But who is he?And as if to underscore his wild fancies, a series of post-it notes now appear on his refrigerator door, scribbled with odd, cryptic little messages, and---more menacingly---a rapidly progressing game of Hangman.Oh, and then there's Ivan, his ghoulish, portly, evilly jocular new co-worker on the machine line. Ivan, with two toes affixed to missing finger-joints (""...and the ladies love it!"" he chortles, wiggling the outsized digits in Reznick's horrified face). Ivan, the new co-worker who no one else sees.Is it any wonder he can't sleep?Director Brad Anderson proved his skills at plumbing and twisting the intricate workings of the tortured human mind with ""Sesson 9"": ""The Machinist"" shows Anderson has only honed his craft with time. ""Machinist"" is in some ways a more ambitious effort, a bracing, brooding, menacing jaunt into dark territory Kafka would recognize and Dostoevsky would understand.To divulge any more of ""The Machinists"" secrets would be criminal: 90% of the fun of this creeper lies in following close on the tormented Reznick's heels, and drinking the mystery into the pores.The acting is superb: Bale turns out an astonishing performance that goes far beyond the physical sacrifice he made for ""The Machinist"". Bale displays a ghastly, measured restraint---he is wondrously attentive, rapturously alert, to all the little changes in his circumscribed existence. Bale serves up a mesmerizing picture of a warped, fragile, and doggedly curious soul determined to plumb the depths of the horrors taking place inside his skull and---more ominously---on the the factory floor.John Sharian (the mysterious Ivan)is 360-degrees of hulking, drawling menace, insultingly, ominously, unctuously oily and affable at once: he dominates every scene like some depraved, hungry, joking ogre at dinner---and you can be sure the joke's on you. And the dinner, as well.The still-gorgeous Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Stevie) and Italian beauty Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Marie) round out a stellar cast as Reznick's precarious anchors of sanity in a world increasingly gone mad---precarious as one is a call-girl and the other a short-order waitress in a dingy, flickeringly-lit diner where even Time itself seems in peril. And Michael Ironside (Miller)growls and grunts and snarls in fine Ironside fashion, and proves he really should keep his hands away from sharp objects (first in ""Starship Troopers"", and now this? Mind the pointy things, Mike!).The cinematography is well-lashed to the paranoid creepiness: the film sprawls out, and slithers around, its industrial slagscape, a twilight land of blues and greys, dingy factories spiked by smokestacks, dotted with dive bars that stink of stale cigarettes and regret. And interiors---the interior of a machinery-clogged and blood-hungry factory line, the interior of a dirty apartment, the interior of a diseased and terrified mind.Prison.JSG",5,"He did a bad, bad Thing...",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,4547,"['Prison.Since', 'Cain', 'painted', 'fields', 'Abel', 'blood', 'race', 'Man', 'favored', 'exile', 'criminal', 'swift', 'separation', 'society', 'transgressed', 'Cain', 'kin', 'were', 'dispatched', 'East', 'Eden', 'mankind', 'been', 'adept', 'following', 'example', 'bringing', 'lash', 'levy', 'cruel', 'calculating', 'wicked', 'insolent', 'criminally', 'stupid', 'ever', 'since.We', 'have', 'exiled', 'felons', 'deep', 'Earth', 'toil', 'Stygian', 'darkness', 'mines', 'languish', 'bone-littered', 'dungeons', 'dank', 'hungry', 'oubliettes', 'have', 'built', 'towering', 'prisons', 'hold', 'unwanted', 'forlorn', 'spits', 'rock', 'sea', 'hark', 'names', 'most', 'notorious', '-Rikers', 'Alcatraz', 'Devil', 'Island', 'Chateau', ""D'If.The"", 'Convict', 'will', 'suffer', 'yes', 'pay', 'debt', 'Society', 'due', 'course', 'first', 'will', 'confine', 'isolate', 'him.And', 'stone', 'sweat', 'blood', 'steel', 'iron', 'portcullises', 'electric', 'mag-lock', 'gates', 'Hole', 'Death', 'Row', 'Green', 'Mile', 'ultimate', 'prison', 'still', 'born', 'own', 'design', 'human', 'mind.Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'one', 'problem', 'too', 'many', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'shucking', 'off', 'pounds', 'rate', 'would', 'boggle', 'Jenny', 'Craig', 'drifting', 'down', '120', 'dropping', 'dropping', 'dropping.And', 'worse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'own', 'thoughts', 'senses', 'things', 'horror', 'pursued', '-but', 'whom', 'dragging', 'body', 'shoving', 'rudely', 'down', 'drainage', 'ditch', 'what', 'end', 'shadowy', 'watchers', 'would', 'come', 'only', 'knew', 'who', 'was.But', 'who', 'underscore', 'wild', 'fancies', 'series', 'post-it', 'notes', 'now', 'appear', 'refrigerator', 'door', 'scribbled', 'odd', 'cryptic', 'little', 'messages', '-more', 'menacingly', '-a', 'rapidly', 'progressing', 'game', 'Hangman.Oh', 'then', 'Ivan', 'ghoulish', 'portly', 'evilly', 'jocular', 'new', 'co-worker', 'machine', 'line', 'Ivan', 'two', 'toes', 'affixed', 'missing', 'finger-joints', 'ladies', 'love', 'wiggling', 'outsized', 'digits', 'Reznick', 'horrified', 'face', 'Ivan', 'new', 'co-worker', 'who', 'one', 'else', 'wonder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'proved', 'skills', 'plumbing', 'twisting', 'intricate', 'workings', 'tortured', 'human', 'mind', 'Sesson', '9', 'Machinist', 'Anderson', 'only', 'honed', 'craft', 'time', 'Machinist', 'ways', 'more', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'bracing', 'brooding', 'menacing', 'jaunt', 'dark', 'territory', 'Kafka', 'would', 'recognize', 'Dostoevsky', 'would', 'understand.To', 'divulge', 'more', 'Machinists', 'secrets', 'would', 'be', 'criminal', '90', '%', 'fun', 'creeper', 'following', 'close', 'tormented', 'Reznick', 'heels', 'drinking', 'mystery', 'pores.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'Bale', 'out', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'far', 'physical', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'Machinist', 'Bale', 'ghastly', 'measured', 'restraint', '-he', 'wondrously', 'attentive', 'rapturously', 'alert', 'little', 'changes', 'circumscribed', 'existence', 'Bale', 'up', 'mesmerizing', 'picture', 'warped', 'fragile', 'doggedly', 'curious', 'soul', 'determined', 'plumb', 'depths', 'horrors', 'taking', 'place', 'skull', '-more', 'ominously', '-on', 'factory', 'floor.John', 'Sharian', 'mysterious', 'Ivan', '360-degrees', 'hulking', 'drawling', 'menace', 'insultingly', 'ominously', 'unctuously', 'oily', 'affable', 'once', 'scene', 'depraved', 'hungry', 'joking', 'ogre', 'dinner', '-and', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'joke', 'dinner', 'well.The', 'still-gorgeous', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'Stevie', 'Italian', 'beauty', 'Aitana', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'Marie', 'round', 'out', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Reznick', 'precarious', 'anchors', 'sanity', 'world', 'increasingly', 'gone', 'mad', '-precarious', 'one', 'call-girl', 'other', 'short-order', 'waitress', 'dingy', 'flickeringly-lit', 'diner', 'where', 'even', 'Time', 'peril', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Miller', 'growls', 'grunts', 'snarls', 'fine', 'Ironside', 'fashion', 'really', 'should', 'keep', 'hands', 'away', 'sharp', 'objects', 'first', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'now', 'Mind', 'pointy', 'things', 'Mike', '.The', 'cinematography', 'well-lashed', 'paranoid', 'creepiness', 'film', 'out', 'slithers', 'around', 'industrial', 'slagscape', 'twilight', 'land', 'blues', 'greys', 'dingy', 'factories', 'spiked', 'smokestacks', 'dotted', 'dive', 'bars', 'stink', 'stale', 'cigarettes', 'regret', 'interiors', '-the', 'interior', 'machinery-clogged', 'blood-hungry', 'factory', 'line', 'interior', 'dirty', 'apartment', 'interior', 'diseased', 'terrified', 'mind.Prison.JSG']",N/A

Director Brad Anderson (writer of ""Transsiberian"" and directed ""Session 9' and ""Happy Accidents"") enjoyed Kosar's dark storyline so much but unfortunately, no American film studio was interested in picking the film up.Fortunately, the film was picked up by Fantastic Factory of Filmax and Castelao Productions in Spain and the film known as ""El Maquinista"" was released and won multiple ""Best Film"" awards.  The film although seems to take place in America was all shot in Barcelona, Spain and Director Brad Anderson who suffered a back injury during filming, directed the film while lying on a gurney.""THE MACHINIST"" would eventually gain momentum in the US and received rave reviews due to its dark storyline but most of all, the performance by Christian Bale who literally starved himself for four months going from 182 pounds down to 120 pounds.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE MACHINIST"" gets its High Definition treatment via 1080p on Blu-ray.  The film showcases the world of Trevor Reznick in a dark, muted pallete and showcasing a brooding, dark monochromatic life that he is living.  This is quite important because we know that there is something odd with Reznick and it was important to showcase the film without its vibrant colors.  In fact, you'll feel that you watching a film that is focused on more of the blacks, the grays and the darker side of the color spectrum.As for picture quality, you do see a bit of spots and speckles on some parts of the film but you will also notice that the transfer to HD also brings out the grain.  Overall, this is probably one of the few films where vibrancy of colors is not what I wanted to see.  And the depressing shades of darkness is what is more pronounced.As for audio, The film is featured in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (Also, French and Spanish 5.1) the majority of the film is all dialogue based.  Front channel, clear and understandable.  The musical score by Roque Banos definitely highlights the eeriness of certain scenes of the film.  There are some scenes where you do notice sound effects especially during the scenes shot at the amusement park and then at a scene that displayed thunder.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""THE MACHINIST"" comes with the following extras:* Commentary: Audio Commentary by Director Brad Anderson - A very informative commentary by Brad Anderson as he goes into what he wanted to accomplish with the film, shooting in Barcelona, talking about the various talens and really dissecting the certain scenes.  In fact, he's a brutally honest director that is not afraid to pick apart his film not for the positive but also some of the negative.  Overall, informative.* Manifesting the Machinist - (23:00) This featurette is exclusive to the Blu-ray release and is in HD.  We learn more about the narrative of the film, the performance by the cast including interviews with cast and crew and more!* The Machinist: Hiding in Plain Sight - (13:58) This featurette is exclusive to the Blu-ray release is in HD and features the major twist of the film and how they wanted to put enough twists that would fool the audience.* The Machinist: Breaking The Rules - (25:19) This featurette from the original DVD release features interviews with writer Scott Kosar, Director Brad Anderson and the cast.  We learn about how the film came about, shooting in Spain and making people think it's America and a lot of informative information of the behind-the-scenes making of the film.* Deleted Scenes - (12:05)  The following are eight deleted scenes.  These are actually solid scenes that could have changed the emotional impact of the film.  The deleted scenes are in standard definition.* 1) Trevor Visits Mysterious Grave* 2) Alternate Intersection Crosscut with Burning Paper* 3) Pensive Trevor (Alternate Transition to Airport)* 4) Stevie's Mysterious ""John""* 5) Alternate Chase Ending Revealing Chimneys* 6) Trevor Tries To Skip Town* 7) Trevor Confronts Mother at Cemetery* 8) Alternative Version of Holding Cell* Theatrical Trailer - (2:32) The original theatrical trailer in standard definition.JUDGMENT CALL:""THE MACHINIST"" is one of those films that you can look at it as quite a unique story.  The film is a psychological thriller that has you on the edge of your seat at times, especially when you start to explore the psyche of Trevor Reznick and the dark and dreary world that he lives in.  But what made this film believable was Christian Bale and what he put himself through to making his character seem real and odd.Before the Batman films and ""Terminator Salvation"", we have always learned about how intense an actor, how dedicated Christian Bale was to character role.  There are not many films that have featured an actor losing weight (the last major film which an actor had to gain and lose a lot of weight was ""CAST AWAY"" starring Tom Hanks) but for Bale to lose so much and look quite skeletal was shocking.Having gone down to 120 pounds from 160+ pounds in four months is shocking and the pain and inconvenience he put himself to achieve the look for this role and still wanting to go down to 100 pounds is just amazing (and gaining it back with muscle for the following year with ""Batman Begins"").  And also a big applause to the make up crew who made Bale's character so eery with its dark shade around the eyes, knot on his forehead and blood scars throughout his face.As for the Blu-ray release, although this is not a film that you want to show off for its picture and audio quality, the solid commentary and even for its few Blu-ray special features definitely make this Blu-ray release worth owning.  If you owned the previous DVD release and enjoy the film, I can definitely recommend going for the double dip.Overall, this is quite an intense psychological thriller that fans of films by Alfred Hitchcock can probably give a nod to.  It's cleverly written and the challenges that the cast and crew had to go through (especially trying to make Barcelona, Spain look like a town in the US) to make this film possible was well-done.  It may be a bit dark and eery for some but it was a film that definitely caught me by surprise at the end.""THE MACHINIST"" is definitely recommended.",5,"Blu-ray: THE MACHINIST' is disturbing, dark

I was totally prepared for it to knock me off of my feet.  I was also a little worried because I am not a fan of scary movies.  I was going to be watching this all by myself in the dark, and I didn't want to have any nightmares.  On both counts I would have to say that The Machinist didn't live up to its billing.  The ending didn't blow me away.  I can't claim that I was expecting that exact ending, but it surely didn't suprise me at all.  I felt the movie was a little anticlimactic.  There was a lot of suspense, a lot of building tension and then the end just didn't do it for me.  I did like how it kept me on edge almost the entire time, but really wasn't scary.  I don't like gory movies, but I do like suspense, and this movie did an excellent job with that.  Immediately after watching the movie I felt a little let down. I thought that it was good, but didn't deserve any more than 3 stars.  The next day I reevaluated my opinion and decided that it was actually a really good movie.  We get to see Bale give a great performance, and not just because he lost so much weight.  It takes more than that to be a good actor.  Although I do agree his apperance made the movie more ""real"".  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is old enough to watch it.  It was really well executed.  I felt it was very similar to the movie The Jacket.  Both movies have a similar feel and tone.  Ironically Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a pretty major role in both movies.  I do feel that The Machinist is the better of the two movies.  In conclusion, yes, I was slightly dissapointed by this movie because I was expecting some shocking and crazy ending.  However, looking back on it, I am very satisfied with the ending.  It is truly a movie about how one man deals with tragedy, and how his life can never be the same again.",4,Pretty Good Movie,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1928,"['Going', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'heard', 'many', 'friends', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'prepared', 'knock', 'feet', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'worried', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'scary', 'movies', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'dark', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'nightmares', 'counts', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Machinist', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'was', 'expecting', 'exact', 'ending', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'suprise', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'anticlimactic', 'was', 'lot', 'suspense', 'lot', 'building', 'tension', 'then', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'kept', 'edge', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gory', 'movies', 'do', 'suspense', 'movie', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Immediately', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'little', 'let', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'next', 'day', 'reevaluated', 'opinion', 'decided', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'Bale', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'not', 'just', 'lost', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'more', 'be', 'good', 'actor', 'do', 'agree', 'apperance', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'real', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'executed', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'movie', 'Jacket', 'movies', 'have', 'similar', 'feel', 'tone', 'Ironically', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'pretty', 'major', 'role', 'movies', 'do', 'feel', 'Machinist', 'better', 'two', 'movies', 'conclusion', 'yes', 'was', 'slightly', 'dissapointed', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'shocking', 'crazy', 'ending', 'However', 'looking', 'back', 'am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'truly', 'movie', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'tragedy', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again']",N/A

In true Hitchcock style. Trevor Reznick, played by Christian Bale, plays an American Machinist, where the film is intended to take place in LA. (Which is actually filmed in Spain.) A definate Film Noir. Special care was made in making this film as a classically beautiful one. Even though the story line is just the opposite in story and some horrific scenes. The music score was marvelous. The cinematography was superb! This movie reminds me deeply of the movie ""Jacobs Ladder"". Things that are real, are really not real and so forth. Yet, they are all real in Trevors mind. This is definately a psychological thriller! I cannot wait to watch it a few more times. Peace DJ Todd",5,The Best  Indie Mystery Movie I have seen in Years!

Nothing like going sleepless for an entire year while operating heavy, slicing-and-dicing equipment.  Yet zombie-like Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) does just that as he stumbles through a hazy, macabre existence in the skin-crawling film THE MACHINIST.It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out Trevor has got some skeletons in his closet (not to mention a skeletal appearance).  Is there something from his past trying to clamor (or even squirt) to the mercurial forefront, or is Trevor merely seeing things as he collects a one-way ticket to Looney Land?  The story is bizarre, creepy, and a tad uneven, yet director Brad Anderson (interviewed extensively in the DVD special features) delivers an eery, tacky tale.For his role as a stressed out insomniac, Christian Bale shriveled to corpse-like dimensions; heck, my left leg (make that my left thigh) weighed more than this guy.  Watching him is uncomfortable to say the least, but his gaunt appearance is effective.  Equally good is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie, a compassionate lady of the evening who befriends Trevor; John Sharian, a Marlon Brando look-a-like, grins and giggles wickedly as Ivan, a surreal coworker and tormentor of Trevor's.  Augmented by a spooky woodwind soundtrack as restless as a spider on a hot stove, THE MACHINIST excels in giving out a plethora of the weebie-geebies.

From it's quirky characters, to it's unusual settings (including a lot in Bale's blue collar worker's place of employment: a machine shop), to it's visual look and direction, this is very close to being called a true, one of a kind film.  It is a dark film, with some dark scenery, but I was actually surprised to find that the overall look was nowhere near as bleak as one would be led to believe from the film's promotion and reviews.  It's kind of like Anderson's film Session 9, which set in an abandoned mental institution, you would think it would be a dark looking film, but it really isn't.Christian Bale, Michael Ironside, and Jennifer Jason Leigh all give top notch performances and make you forget about it being a slow moving film, shot in hotel rooms, dingy apartments, and a grungy machine shop.  The actor who plays Bale's psychological nemesis is also excellent.  He is the one Bale keeps seeing show up at work, while no one else does.The film is strong enough to keep your interest thorughout, with interesting dialog, character development, and the mystery element.

Luckily, I didn't find that to be the case. ""The Machinist"" expertly portrays a character that, due to a year without sleep, lives in a world somewhere in between reality and la-la land. He's not so much insane as he is half asleep, and so he's constantly being bombarded with surreal symbols, clues and characters that are trying to push him towards coming to terms with what's causing his self-imposed sleep (and food) deprivation.Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale's weight loss for the role, and for good reason: he looks shockingly emaciated. Aside from his physical transformation, his performance is also pitch perfect.

Why did Bale do this exactly, was he so overpowered by the screenplay that he said, "" I must dedicate myself to this role as a method actor with no reservation whatsoever! "", is that it? Should we blame Robert De Niro and his Oscar winning turn in "" Raging Bull "", for such nonsensical acting decisions? De Niro gained like 60 pounds and turned into fat boy Jake LaMotta, so now the new generation of young actors aspire to De Niro's over the top antics? Good for Bale that he got back to his healthy weight very quickly, but the question I ask is, I'm aware of suffering for your art but is the art worth suffering for?The short answer as regards The Machinist, is no. This is not a great film, it might be a good film, maybe even an effective tale of what guilt and conscience can do to a human being, but it's not a masterpiece in any sense. This isn't Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment for god's sake! Did Bale just assume that this film was worth the experience he put himself through by reading the screenplay or did Bale just want to shock people and get easy publicity? I don't care what his intentions were, I care about the finished work. The Machinist is a fairly standard psychological study and who couldn't see the ending coming from a mile away? How many recent movies have we had with protoganists fighting against the forces of their imaginations? Seems like a whole bunch.I recommend this movie for the overall fine performances and the well-crafted direction, it has some good scenes no doubt about it.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Christian Bale is one of those rare actors whose devotion to his craft goes way beyond the usual ""I gained/lost ten pounds, so give me an Oscar!"" stuff.No, this guy whittled himself down to the bone for ""The Machinist,"" a movie where nothing can be trusted and nobody is what they seem. This is one of the movies that convincingly depicts what it's like to lose your mind, little by little, and director Brad Anderson fills the entire movie with a bleak, industrial feeling that makes you feel like you're locked in a dystopian nightmare.Trevor Reznik (Bale) works in a factory in Los Angeles. He hasn't slept in a whole year, and barely eats anything. He's only able to keep his life organized with post-it notes. Clocks are stuck. His sole comfort comes from the nurturing prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and his nightly visits to a restaurant to speak with the beautiful waitress Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n).But strange things are happening in his life. Someone leaves a hangman game on his fridge. A coworker (Michael Ironside) loses his arm in an accident. And a mysterious new worker named Ivan (John Sharian) seems to be following Trevor everywhere -- but everyone else claims that Ivan doesn't exist. Trevor becomes convinced that a conspiracy is being built up around him, but the only way he can get to the truth is if he remembers the past...Christian Bale is the key to ""The Machinist"" working as a movie. He gives a brilliant performance as a man whose life and sanity have been slowly chiseled away over a year, yet he doesn't seem to realize that anything is wrong with HIM. It's painful to see an essentially nice, ordinary guy degenerate into a wild, forgetful maniac convinced that everybody is working against him.He also lost sixty pounds to do this movie, and his emaciated body and sunken eyes are just PAINFUL to watch. But you have to admire the dedication of a man who does this sort of thing for his art -- especially if he's playing Batman next.But Brad Anderson's direction is important in making that performance shine. Everything is bleak and industrial, with lots of steel, concrete and glaring fluorescent lights. Everything is filmed in a sickly grey-green color that leaves everybody looking washed out and dirty, and everything we see and hear seems slightly ""off.""In fact, everything has a feeling of profound WRONGNESS. Everything feels surreal and off, and the world sometimes seems to warp as Trevor drifts through it. Trevor's increasingly erratic behavior begins to reveal that the madness all centers on him, and it's only at the end that things finally snap into clarity.And yes, it's crammed with symbolism, but it's not immediately clear what some of it means. The most shocking example is when Trevor rides into the ""highway to hell"" funhouse, and is confronted by demons, corpses, fire and severed limbs.""The Machinist"" is not an easily movie to watch, but it is a brilliant one -- a bleak, bizarro film revolving around one man's guilt and madness.

894665,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0007Y08QA,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[0, 0]","I'll just start by saying that Christian Bale was amazing in this role. What an amazing transformation as well. I read that he lost sixty pounds for the role, and alot of the characters keep comments that if ""he was any thinner he wouldn't exist."" At the same time as I saw this film, I am reading ""Crime and Punishment"" written by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Christian Bale was reading ""The Idiot,"" also by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Now that I am more chapters in ""Crime and Punishment"" I am noticing how that book and ""The Machinist"" are similiar. They are both strong character studies. This movie is saved by it's great study of Trevor Reznick, a man who has not slept in over a year. Throughout the movie, we are wondering why he is going through this, but the big problem is that the ending has been used before in other movies, and books for  that matter, and I didn't feel like I was seeing anything new. Jennifer Jason Leigh co-stars, but she is such a great actress, but is always in small parts. With this and ""In the Cut"" she was on the scene for about forty-five minutes combined.Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznick, who is thin, tired, and through with the people at work. He works at a big factory, working with machines. He then starts to see Ivan, a co-worker that nobody can see. He watches Ivan one day, and then gets invovled in an accident that ends up with a fellow co-worker losing a hand. From then on, the locker room is filled with workers making snide remarks towards him, and telling him that he should quit because nobody likes him. His only confidence is in his ""girlfriend"" Stevie, who is a prostitute that will quit hooking if Trevor is ready to commit to a relationship. He also likes to go to the airport cafe everyday to talk to Marie, the beautiful French single mother, who Trevor is able to talk to easily. Eventually, he does to his kitchen one day to find a Post-It on his fridge.-----lll------_ _ _ _ _ _Trevor throws it away, but eventually gets curious, especially when he sees a Mother's Day card with the same kind of handwriting, saying Mother. Mother fits into the six spaces of the hangman game. Eventually, a new Post-It appears, this time with the last two spaces filled in saying ER, and the clues begin to all fit together. Trevor finds out that Ivan is not who he seems, all leading to a finale that will come as a shock, but feel old and retired.The ending of ""The Machinist"" stopped it from being a five star film, but see this movie for the other hour and a half. It is a grim story, but at the same time darkly comic. The humor is very dark, including a trip to the amusement park where Trevor rides Route 666, and is amazed with the amounts of blood and disturbing images he sees. Bale is fascinating to watch, and I couldn't keep my eyes of him. He hasn't slept in a year, so he is a gaunt, always tired, and it's amazing to watch him keep himself busy during the night. I heard that if you see this movie after not sleeping for a day, because it has a much bigger effect, and it makes it watch in awe to the fact that this man hasn't done that in a year. I spotted the Fyodor Dostoevsky connection a few weeks after seeing the movie, but I have a feeling alot of what director Brad Anderson wrote was inspired by that author. I could see an Oscar nomination for Bale, and this gritty tale wouldn't have been the same without him. It's shame this doesn't have a wider release, because a dark thriller is perfect for this time, when the only other good thriller is ""Saw,"" and that is more on disturbances rather than character. You might like ""The Machinist"" better if you leave before the last ten minutes, unless you want everything to make sense, but I would have liked it better if everything was connected in a different way. If you see it for any reason, make Bale the number one.ENJOY!Rated R for violence and disturbing images, sexuality and language.",4,A Fascinating Character Study!,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,3924,"[""'ll"", 'just', 'start', 'saying', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'amazing', 'role', 'What', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'as', 'well', 'read', 'lost', 'sixty', 'pounds', 'role', 'alot', 'characters', 'keep', 'comments', 'was', 'thinner', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'same', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'am', 'reading', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'written', 'Russian', 'author', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevsky', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'reading', 'Idiot', 'also', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevsky', 'Now', 'am', 'more', 'chapters', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'am', 'noticing', 'how', 'book', 'Machinist', 'are', 'similiar', 'are', 'strong', 'character', 'studies', 'movie', 'saved', 'great', 'study', 'Trevor', 'Reznick', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'slept', 'year', 'movie', 'are', 'wondering', 'why', 'going', 'big', 'problem', 'ending', 'been', 'used', 'other', 'movies', 'books', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'seeing', 'anything', 'new', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'co-stars', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'always', 'small', 'parts', 'Cut', 'was', 'scene', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'combined.Christian', 'Bale', 'plays', 'Trevor', 'Reznick', 'who', 'thin', 'tired', 'people', 'work', 'big', 'factory', 'working', 'machines', 'then', 'see', 'Ivan', 'co-worker', 'nobody', 'can', 'see', 'Ivan', 'one', 'day', 'then', 'invovled', 'accident', 'up', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'losing', 'hand', 'then', 'locker', 'room', 'filled', 'workers', 'making', 'snide', 'remarks', 'telling', 'should', 'quit', 'nobody', 'only', 'confidence', 'girlfriend', 'Stevie', 'who', 'prostitute', 'will', 'quit', 'hooking', 'Trevor', 'ready', 'commit', 'relationship', 'also', 'go', 'airport', 'cafe', 'everyday', 'talk', 'Marie', 'beautiful', 'French', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'Trevor', 'able', 'talk', 'easily', 'Eventually', 'kitchen', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'Post-It', 'fridge.', '-lll', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_Trevor', 'away', 'eventually', 'curious', 'especially', 'when', 'Mother', 'Day', 'card', 'same', 'kind', 'handwriting', 'saying', 'Mother', 'Mother', 'six', 'spaces', 'hangman', 'game', 'Eventually', 'new', 'Post-It', 'time', 'last', 'two', 'spaces', 'filled', 'saying', 'ER', 'clues', 'begin', 'fit', 'together', 'Trevor', 'out', 'Ivan', 'not', 'who', 'leading', 'finale', 'will', 'come', 'shock', 'feel', 'old', 'retired.The', 'ending', 'Machinist', 'stopped', 'being', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'see', 'movie', 'other', 'hour', 'half', 'grim', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'darkly', 'comic', 'humor', 'very', 'dark', 'including', 'trip', 'amusement', 'park', 'where', 'Trevor', 'Route', '666', 'amazed', 'amounts', 'blood', 'disturbing', 'images', 'Bale', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'gaunt', 'always', 'tired', 'amazing', 'watch', 'keep', 'busy', 'night', 'heard', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'sleeping', 'day', 'much', 'bigger', 'effect', 'watch', 'awe', 'fact', 'man', ""n't"", 'done', 'year', 'spotted', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevsky', 'connection', 'few', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'feeling', 'alot', 'what', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'wrote', 'was', 'inspired', 'author', 'could', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Bale', 'gritty', 'tale', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'shame', ""n't"", 'have', 'wider', 'release', 'dark', 'thriller', 'perfect', 'time', 'when', 'only', 'other', 'good', 'thriller', 'Saw', 'more', 'disturbances', 'rather', 'character', 'might', 'like', 'Machinist', 'better', 'leave', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'want', 'everything', 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'everything', 'was', 'connected', 'different', 'way', 'see', 'reason', 'make', 'Bale', 'number', 'one.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'images', 'sexuality', 'language']",N/A

Christian Bale lost a lot of weight for this role and the director took good advantage of this, using lighting to highlight every bone in his ribcage.  Nicely done, although probably not good for Bale's health!The color scheme in this movie lends a hand in illustrating how bleak this man's world has become.  All the scenery around him is in bland gray tones.  The only things in vivid color are the things he needs to pay attention to -- like the red car that keeps popping up out of nowhere, the red route 66 sign, the blue car that hits him.But instead of paying attention to these signs, he instead chooses to see them as a threat...becoming paranoid with each encounter, thus driving away the people who care for him and driving himself crazy in the process.The lighting in this movie also lent a hand in illustrating mood.  I perceived the lighting to be too harsh -- especially at the machinery and at the airport -- and likened this to the sensation of being asleep and suddenly having the lights turned on.  The blinding light shocks you awake...just like every time he tries to sleep, something keeps him staying awake.And for good reason.This is a strange movie that I don't see appealing to a wide audience.  I know there were some parts that still confuse me, but overall, I still liked it.  I enjoyed Christian Bale's performance as well as the overall mood of the film.

It's a dark, moody psychological mind-bender that had me riveted from the first minute to the last. In my opinion, The Machinist is certainly one of the best suspense thrillers of the last few years. In an era of tired, formula thrillers (e.g. most of Ashley Judd's filmography), Brad Anderson's The Machinist is a breath of fresh air: a deep, complex, layered film that could be deemed to be about any number of things. The story itself is certainly not the most original. As I mentioned earlier, it resembles work by Hitchcock (North By Northwest), David Fincher (The Game and Fight Club) and Christopher Nolan (Memento). That is no slight against the film, though. Brad Anderson and screenwriter Scott Kosar take these elements and weave them into a stunning whole that truly stands apart. The Machinist works best as a dark, twisted psychological experience in which the audience is brought into Trevor Reznik's (Christian Bale) disturbed state of mind. It is truly intense and  at times, frightening.Of course, if you know anything about The Machinist, you probably know that Christian Bale lost a lot of weight to play the role of Trevor Reznik. By now, this fact should be pretty well known and there is really nothing more to say about it. Having just seen Christian Bale recently in American Psycho as well, I am truly impressed with him as an actor. He obviously devotes himself thoroughly to his performances even at the risk of his own health. I look forward to seeing Bale's take on Batman next.If you are tired of bland Hollywood thrillers and are looking for something to give you a truly unique (if not necessarily pleasant) experience, I would highly recommend The Machinist. It is certainly not a movie for everyone though. A lot of people will find it disturbing and horrifying, and understandably so. It is a dark, twisted somewhat demented film.

894670,ANMFFCVZ3KM81,B0007Y08QA,"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[3, 8]","This is another dark and disturbing motion picture, which centers on Christian Bale (Trevor Reznik), a lathe-operator in some machine shop somewhere. He suffers from insomnia and by his words, ""has not slept in over a year"". His insomnia has directly affected his physical appearance as well, coming across as some sort of crystal meth junkie. His employer is concerned, and drug screens him regularly. He only has two personal contacts throughout the picture, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a hooker; and some waitress at the airport coffee show which he frequents at 1:25 A.M every morning.Christian Bale's physical transformation in this film is frightening. He's a walking skeleton, a virtual bag of bones. Part of his morning routine is the act of weighing himself, which he records on sticky note pads and posts to his bathroom wall. The first weight posting we see is 107 pounds, and he resembles the Donnie Wahlberg character in the beginning of the Sixth Sense. Figuring his normal weight is probably 165 -170 pounds, how he's lost all the weigh for this role just boggles the mind.... and of course, pivotal to the plot of this film.Jennifer Jason Leigh also looks pretty bad. Of course if she's going for that burnt out trashy street walker look, then she's succeeded in spades. Not to mention that the weight Christian lost, somehow found its way to Leigh must have been an added bonus for the director.Besides the massive weigh lost, Reznik has also started to hallucinate, and paranoia is beginning to set in. He's unable to keep his mind on his job at work, which leads to a fellow employee losing his arm. A pretty cool scene by the way......The beginning of the film is well paced and keeps you on the edge of you seat. You find yourself trying to decipher what is real, and what's not. This leads you on a rollercoaster ride through the thoughts and dreams of Reznik, all escalating to the pinnacle of the film..... which turns out to be just the opposite, a very anti-climactic ending. For me anyways.Except for the ending, I found the film quite intriguing; though a letdown, the ending does answer all the questions that you may have of Reznik. I just felt it could have been so much more, and that it just missed its mark by a hair. I, however, do recommend seeing this film, and leave you to surmise your own conclusions.[...]",3,Wait for the Video,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,2349,"['dark', 'disturbing', 'motion', 'picture', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'lathe-operator', 'machine', 'shop', 'somewhere', 'insomnia', 'words', 'not', 'slept', 'year', 'insomnia', 'directly', 'affected', 'physical', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'coming', 'across', 'sort', 'crystal', 'meth', 'junkie', 'employer', 'concerned', 'drug', 'screens', 'regularly', 'only', 'two', 'personal', 'contacts', 'picture', 'Stevie', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'hooker', 'waitress', 'airport', 'coffee', 'show', '1:25', 'A.M', 'morning.Christian', 'Bale', 'physical', 'transformation', 'film', 'frightening', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'virtual', 'bag', 'bones', 'Part', 'morning', 'routine', 'act', 'weighing', 'sticky', 'note', 'pads', 'posts', 'bathroom', 'wall', 'first', 'weight', 'posting', 'see', '107', 'pounds', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'beginning', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Figuring', 'normal', 'weight', 'probably', '165', '-170', 'pounds', 'how', 'lost', 'weigh', 'role', 'just', 'mind', 'course', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'film.Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'also', 'pretty', 'bad', 'course', 'going', 'out', 'trashy', 'street', 'walker', 'look', 'then', 'succeeded', 'spades', 'Not', 'mention', 'weight', 'Christian', 'lost', 'somehow', 'found', 'way', 'Leigh', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'bonus', 'director.Besides', 'massive', 'weigh', 'lost', 'Reznik', 'also', 'started', 'hallucinate', 'paranoia', 'beginning', 'set', 'unable', 'keep', 'mind', 'job', 'work', 'fellow', 'employee', 'losing', 'arm', 'pretty', 'cool', 'scene', 'way', 'beginning', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'edge', 'seat', 'find', 'trying', 'decipher', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'thoughts', 'dreams', 'Reznik', 'escalating', 'pinnacle', 'film', '..', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'opposite', 'very', 'anti-climactic', 'ending', 'ending', 'found', 'film', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'letdown', 'ending', 'answer', 'questions', 'may', 'have', 'Reznik', 'just', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'missed', 'mark', 'hair', 'however', 'do', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'leave', 'surmise', 'own', 'conclusions.', '[', ']']",N/A

894672,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0007Y08QA,General Zombie,"[3, 3]","Now, 'The Machinist' is my kinda movie.  Plot and character are important, but I find the thing that really draws me into films are the mood and the visual style.  Before watching this, I supposed it was going to be a 'weird sh*t' movie, meaning a film with a lot of odd visuals and scenes and ideas simply proceeding one after another, but with farily little in terms of plot.  I was correct.  Yeah, it tries to tie it all together at the end, and more or less succeeds, but that isn't the point of the film.  The explanation is acceptable, though certainly not remarkable, but the film doesn't play to the revelatory angle.  The final explanation is needed to justify all the strange stuff going on before hand, not the other way around.  And, this is the way it should be.  No twist can redeem a lousy, boring movie.This film is the story of Trevor Reznik an insomniac machine shop worker, who is clearly disturbed, as he's pretty much wasting away into nothingness, and displays some obsessive-compulsive tendencies.  One day, he's distracted during the job by a coworker, the big, rough-looking Ivan, which causes a fellow worker, Miller, to lose his arm.  While investigating the  accident, Reznik's employer's deny that any Ivan works there, and Reznik's supposes there must be some sort of conspiracy.  The rest of the film is simply his looking into what's really going on, and our peering into Reznik's troubled world and mind.Visually, this film comes across as a mix of two David's: Fincher and Lynch.(`Mulholland Drive' , specifically.  I'm not familiar with Lynch's work, as a whole)  The colors are muted, and it's all shot in a calm and elegant, yet distant fashion.  Lynchian surrealism comes up, via the bizarre, mysterious character Ivan, who is menacing but not altogether unfriendly, along with some of the visual aspects, particularly the otherworldly, staggeringly pristine airport diner which Trevor frequents, and a nightmarish and violent `house of horrors' sort of carnival ride he goes through.  And there are just lotsa images that are strangely effective and obscure: Ivan's pantomiming a throat slitting while sparks fly about him in the factory pit, his bright, fiercely red car in the  otherwise muted world, a strangely menacing fishing photo,  a blood-oozing refrigerator, the mysterious post-it notes, and Reznik's hollow, desiccated body.  The film just has so many strange, interesting things in it.`The Machinist' is interesting in that it is shown from Reznik's perspective, yet we can't hope to identify with him entirely.  The audience is bound to find out pretty quickly that Reznik is not a reliable source, and though we sees things as he does, we assume that he's pretty nuts and that there's no conspiracy, so that, in the end, the closing scenes of the film are far more revelatory to Trevor than they are to us.  (And this is, indeed, deliberate, as director Anderson explains in the commentary.)  So, it's just a sorta interesting perspective, as we spend a film watching a character unravel a mystery that  we're pretty sure doesn't exist.  (Well, he does find the real truth, eventually, but he's not really looking for it)Performances are all excellent.  Bale, obviously, dominates the  screen as Reznik, and is the only person who really has that big of a role.  I think he is perhaps ever so slightly over-hyped, simply because he lost so much weight for the film, but he really is great.  He plays a withdrawn man, but doesn't make him completely flat, allowing him some humor and humanity, and he plays the few scenes where he's out of control very convincingly.As much as I like this film, I think some people seem to be heaping excess praise onto it with regards to how it insinuates the evidence of what's really going on.  The thing is, that's all there is to the film, when you get right down to it.  It's just a bunch of hints, and a bunch of red herrings stuck together.  It's made up of details, rather than filled with them.  I don't think it's to tough to fill your film with hints as to it's true nature when that's all there is to it.  The truly ingenious twists come when the entire film seems to be about something else, has a whole other plot, yet is still filled with clues that'll change the way you look at everything.  I don't criticize the film for not working this way, it's not trying to, but lotsa people aren't bothering to make the distinction, which I think matters, if just a little bit.God, it's just tough to say exactly what I mean about.  I just like the mysterious and surreal.  Real life is always so mundane, films should show us something more interesting. Screw realism, I want spectacle, something different.

However, the film itself is not quite as deserving and it's a shame.There is no doubt that Christian Bale completely transformed himself for this film. The well-built but lean actor reportedly lost 63 pounds for this film, quite literally starving himself for his craft! We've certainly heard about DeNiro's famous weight gain to play LaMotta and many others' weight gains to play parts, but NEVER before has any actor transformed himself so drastically as Bale did for this part. There is little doubt in my mind that Bale has quite probably damaged his kidneys and liver by such drastic weight loss. Not to mention the muscle loss and constant pain he must have been enduring at the time.Watching Bale as Reznick on screen in this film is very painful. Two characters refer to him, ""If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."" Photos I've seen of Holocost survivors are the only ones that can compare to his physical transformation.All that praise aside, the film itself doesn't quite live up to the devotion that Bale provided. Could it be that shock at his appearance distracts from really becoming involved in the film? Possibly yes. However, the build up in the film is somewhat satisfactory if not too much on the ""we want to confuse you"" side. Ultimately, the outcome of the film is believable, but more than just a bit of a let down.Bale is a machinist in a factory (making what we don't know). He is horribly thin and apparently this is due to his lack of eating and his not having slept in a year. Why? We don't know and he seems not to know either. Something is amiss and he can't figure it out. He tries to keep himself together by visiting his prostitute girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and half hearted dating of a waitress from the airport, but he doesn't succeed.As the audience only knows just a bit more than he, we want him to realize for himself that if he would only sleep, he would surely begin to be able to connect the dots and start finding answers to his questions. However, Reznick doesn't do this. Why?In the end, we realize why. It's a solution that is satisfying, because it is believable, but it's also too little too late. I don't want to give away the film because it is good and warrants a closer look.I wanted to praise the film itself more than I have, but it ultimately is the lead for whom I can praise more than the film itself.",3,Shocking potboiler that makes you keep guessing along with the lead character,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2449,"['virtue', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'devotion', 'craft', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'deserving', 'shame.There', 'doubt', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'completely', 'transformed', 'film', 'well-built', 'lean', 'actor', 'reportedly', 'lost', '63', 'pounds', 'film', 'quite', 'literally', 'starving', 'craft', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'heard', 'DeNiro', 'famous', 'weight', 'gain', 'play', 'LaMotta', 'many', 'others', 'weight', 'gains', 'play', 'parts', 'NEVER', 'before', 'actor', 'transformed', 'so', 'drastically', 'Bale', 'did', 'part', 'little', 'doubt', 'mind', 'Bale', 'quite', 'probably', 'damaged', 'kidneys', 'liver', 'such', 'drastic', 'weight', 'loss', 'Not', 'mention', 'muscle', 'loss', 'constant', 'pain', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'enduring', 'time.Watching', 'Bale', 'Reznick', 'screen', 'film', 'very', 'painful', 'Two', 'characters', 'refer', 'were', 'thinner', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Photos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Holocost', 'survivors', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'can', 'compare', 'physical', 'transformation.All', 'praise', 'aside', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'devotion', 'Bale', 'provided', 'Could', 'be', 'shock', 'appearance', 'distracts', 'really', 'becoming', 'involved', 'film', 'Possibly', 'yes', 'However', 'build', 'up', 'film', 'somewhat', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'want', 'confuse', 'side', 'Ultimately', 'outcome', 'film', 'believable', 'more', 'just', 'bit', 'let', 'down.Bale', 'machinist', 'factory', 'making', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'horribly', 'thin', 'apparently', 'due', 'lack', 'eating', 'not', 'having', 'slept', 'year', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'know', 'either', 'Something', 'amiss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'keep', 'together', 'visiting', 'prostitute', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'half', 'hearted', 'dating', 'waitress', 'airport', ""n't"", 'succeed.As', 'audience', 'only', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'want', 'realize', 'would', 'only', 'sleep', 'would', 'surely', 'begin', 'be', 'able', 'connect', 'dots', 'start', 'finding', 'answers', 'questions', 'However', 'Reznick', ""n't"", 'do', 'Why', 'end', 'realize', 'why', 'solution', 'satisfying', 'believable', 'also', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'film', 'good', 'warrants', 'closer', 'look.I', 'wanted', 'praise', 'film', 'more', 'have', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'whom', 'can', 'praise', 'more', 'film']",N/A
894675,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0007Y08QA,Ghoulie Guru,"[1, 3]","WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...With the Machinist, director Brad Anderson has created a love sonnet to Hitchcock. If the fact that it has Christian Bale in it rather than Jimmy Stewart throws you off the scent, all you have to do is listen to the music. The soundtrack to the Machinist sounds like Bernard Herman's greatest hits. This purposeful tip of the hat to Hitchcock, and Christian Bale's immersive portrayal of a man who is slowly losing his mind make the Machinist worth watching, despite the fact that it boasts one of my least favorite twist endings.Bale plays a tortured man who hasn't been able to sleep for a year. The cause of his insomnia is unknown, but it's taking a toll on his health. To say that he's lost a lot of weight is an understatement. Bale is positively skeletal in this movie. As he struggles to maintain his sanity and keep his job at the machine shop, Bale tries desperately to understand why he can't sleep.Things take a turn for the worst when Bale meets the new guy at work. He's a bald-headed, leering man who lost his hand in some kind of unfortunate circumstance, and now has two of his toes sewed on his hand in place of fingers. This guy has a weird way of showing up just when something bad is going to happen, and pretty soon Bale thinks that Baldy has got it in for him. If you've seen SECRET WINDOW, HAUTE TENSION or even HIDE AND SEEK, the big twist of this movie will come as no surprise. Typically, I think this revelation is overused and cheap, which is the only reason that I didn't give this movie a higher rating, but at least the Machinist is done with some style.Taking into account the undeniable Hitchcock style that Brad Anderson gave this movie, and the remarkable acting from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale, I would recommend this movie to horror fans who are interested in thrillers that move a little slower but are thick with atmosphere. The ending is a bit of a letdown, but as with HAUTE TENSION, the telling of the tale justifies at least one viewing.",3,"Lean, Mean Thriller Machine",1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2034,"['WARNING', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Machinist', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'created', 'love', 'sonnet', 'Hitchcock', 'fact', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'rather', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'off', 'scent', 'have', 'do', 'listen', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Machinist', 'Bernard', 'Herman', 'greatest', 'hits', 'purposeful', 'tip', 'hat', 'Hitchcock', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'immersive', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'losing', 'mind', 'make', 'Machinist', 'worth', 'watching', 'fact', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'twist', 'endings.Bale', 'tortured', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'sleep', 'year', 'cause', 'insomnia', 'unknown', 'taking', 'toll', 'health', 'say', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'understatement', 'Bale', 'positively', 'skeletal', 'movie', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'keep', 'job', 'machine', 'shop', 'Bale', 'desperately', 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep.Things', 'take', 'turn', 'worst', 'when', 'Bale', 'new', 'guy', 'work', 'bald-headed', 'leering', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'hand', 'kind', 'unfortunate', 'circumstance', 'now', 'two', 'toes', 'sewed', 'hand', 'place', 'fingers', 'guy', 'weird', 'way', 'showing', 'up', 'just', 'when', 'something', 'bad', 'going', 'happen', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Bale', 'Baldy', 'got', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'SECRET', 'WINDOW', 'HAUTE', 'TENSION', 'even', 'HIDE', 'AND', 'SEEK', 'big', 'twist', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'Typically', 'think', 'revelation', 'overused', 'cheap', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'least', 'Machinist', 'done', 'style.Taking', 'account', 'undeniable', 'Hitchcock', 'style', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'gave', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'especially', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'thrillers', 'move', 'little', 'slower', 'are', 'thick', 'atmosphere', 'ending', 'bit', 'letdown', 'HAUTE', 'TENSION', 'telling', 'tale', 'justifies', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A
894676,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0007Y08QA,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 2]","Usually young director Brad Anderson writes the scripts for all his films--but after reading Scott Kosar's script in 2001, he made an exception. He could see a stunning and frightening film in his mind's eye, something unique and completely off-center; perhaps too much so. They had to shop around for two years before finally finding a quadrate of producers -but they were Spanish. The solution, of course, was to shoot the film in Spain, using mostly a Spanish crew. Anderson was careful with the settings, casting, and art design, creating a world of the story to reside in ""Anywhere, U.S.A.""; pushing a little to resemble the seedier sides of Los Angeles -which was indeed tricky considering he filmed mostly in Barcelona.Brad Anderson has directed 12 films since 1995, one of the most notable being NEXT STOP WONDERLAND (1998). He has taught film classes in Boston, and directed a lot of episodes for various television series. He shot THE MACHINIST (2004) from the main character's POV, and he kept teasing us with set ups, camera angles, lighting, and intentional echoes from Hitchcock and David Lynch. To deepen the comparisons, he had composer Roque Barios emulate strains of Bernard Herrmann; punctuated with electronic music that sounded like pieces of the theme from THE OUTER LIMITS.This film has already achieved cult status. Most viewers are taken aback by the raw intensity of the action, the macabre point of view, and the deep emotions -unstable, angry, and explosive, along with the rampant paranoia. Actually Anderson does build this film to a point where we are offered complete closure for all the plot conflicts and mysteries -but even so a lot of audience members are left in a dark theater feeling still perplexed and confused. Roger Ebert wrote, ""We see Trevor's world so clearly from his eyes that only gradually does it occur to us that every life is seen through a filter."" I would add to that that every viewer watching every film is filtering that experience through their perceptions, experiences, random prejudices and predispositions. That is the primary thing that makes film discussion and criticism so visceral and engaging.Christian Bale was brilliant as Trevor Reznik, reducing his beautiful body to an almost unrecognizable state, a rib-bulging cadaver, one of the walking dead, an Ausweis victim. It was fascinating to watch Bale twist and turn, bob and weave, posing for several skeletal tableaus -knowing just how to present those jutting bones for maximum effect. John Sharian played co-worker Ivan, reminiscent of Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) -a lethal smile with horsy teeth and deadly eyes; mysterious, flashy, and dangerous, but possessed with a wicked sense of humor; a twinkle in one eye and a drop of blood in the other, often hidden behind black sunglasses. Jennifer Jason-Leigh added another hooker with a heart of gold to her role charm bracelet, doing a bang up grand job as Trevor's call girl/girlfriend, Stevie.  Leigh is so comfortable in the nude we forget she is acting, bringing both sensuality and matronly affection to the table. She dared to like, maybe even almost love that oddball; that starved bird with the broken wing -and dared to hope he could build a life with her beyond prostitution. During their final scene together when Trevor goes over the emotional edge -the sadness and pain turning to anger on her face was hard to forget; with marked simplicity, just Leigh living in that terrible moment with us watching.THE MACHINIST transcended genres. It transcended time and space, and even place; filmed in Andalusian limbo to thrust us into a nightmare world that bends and twists like a dragon's tail -spiked and murderous -peopled with dark characters and darker deeds, suggesting demons lurking unseen in the shadows; permeated with that deep feeling of despair, or anger toward the unknown and the unknowable. It requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate the acting, the art design, the psychology, and the writing. An audience member must be at the top of their cognitive game to successfully negotiate the twisted journey within the mind of a tortured soul.",5,Hangman's Hysteria,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,4144,"['Usually', 'young', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'scripts', 'films', 'reading', 'Scott', 'Kosar', 'script', '2001', 'made', 'exception', 'could', 'see', 'stunning', 'frightening', 'film', 'mind', 'eye', 'something', 'unique', 'completely', 'off-center', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'had', 'shop', 'around', 'two', 'years', 'finally', 'finding', 'quadrate', 'producers', '-but', 'were', 'Spanish', 'solution', 'course', 'was', 'shoot', 'film', 'Spain', 'using', 'mostly', 'Spanish', 'crew', 'Anderson', 'was', 'careful', 'settings', 'casting', 'art', 'design', 'creating', 'world', 'story', 'reside', 'Anywhere', 'U.S.A.', 'pushing', 'little', 'resemble', 'seedier', 'sides', 'Los', 'Angeles', '-which', 'was', 'indeed', 'tricky', 'considering', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'Barcelona.Brad', 'Anderson', 'directed', '12', 'films', '1995', 'one', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'NEXT', 'STOP', 'WONDERLAND', '1998', 'taught', 'film', 'classes', 'Boston', 'directed', 'lot', 'episodes', 'various', 'television', 'series', 'shot', 'THE', 'MACHINIST', '2004', 'main', 'character', 'POV', 'kept', 'teasing', 'set', 'ups', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'intentional', 'echoes', 'Hitchcock', 'David', 'Lynch', 'deepen', 'comparisons', 'had', 'composer', 'Roque', 'Barios', 'emulate', 'strains', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'punctuated', 'electronic', 'music', 'sounded', 'pieces', 'theme', 'THE', 'OUTER', 'LIMITS.This', 'film', 'already', 'achieved', 'cult', 'status', 'Most', 'viewers', 'are', 'taken', 'aback', 'raw', 'intensity', 'action', 'macabre', 'point', 'view', 'deep', 'emotions', '-unstable', 'angry', 'explosive', 'rampant', 'paranoia', 'Actually', 'Anderson', 'build', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'offered', 'complete', 'closure', 'plot', 'conflicts', 'mysteries', '-but', 'even', 'so', 'lot', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'left', 'dark', 'theater', 'feeling', 'still', 'perplexed', 'confused', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'see', 'Trevor', 'world', 'so', 'clearly', 'eyes', 'only', 'gradually', 'occur', 'life', 'seen', 'filter', 'would', 'add', 'viewer', 'watching', 'film', 'filtering', 'experience', 'perceptions', 'experiences', 'random', 'prejudices', 'predispositions', 'primary', 'thing', 'film', 'discussion', 'criticism', 'so', 'visceral', 'engaging.Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'reducing', 'beautiful', 'body', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'state', 'rib-bulging', 'cadaver', 'one', 'walking', 'dead', 'Ausweis', 'victim', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Bale', 'twist', 'turn', 'bob', 'weave', 'posing', 'several', 'skeletal', 'tableaus', '-knowing', 'just', 'how', 'present', 'jutting', 'bones', 'maximum', 'effect', 'John', 'Sharian', 'played', 'co-worker', 'Ivan', 'reminiscent', 'Brando', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', '1979', '-a', 'lethal', 'smile', 'horsy', 'teeth', 'deadly', 'eyes', 'mysterious', 'flashy', 'dangerous', 'possessed', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'twinkle', 'one', 'eye', 'drop', 'blood', 'other', 'often', 'hidden', 'black', 'sunglasses', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'added', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'role', 'charm', 'bracelet', 'doing', 'bang', 'up', 'grand', 'job', 'Trevor', 'call', 'girl/girlfriend', 'Stevie', 'Leigh', 'so', 'comfortable', 'nude', 'forget', 'acting', 'bringing', 'sensuality', 'matronly', 'affection', 'table', 'dared', 'like', 'maybe', 'even', 'almost', 'love', 'oddball', 'starved', 'bird', 'broken', 'wing', '-and', 'dared', 'hope', 'could', 'build', 'life', 'prostitution', 'final', 'scene', 'together', 'when', 'Trevor', 'emotional', 'edge', '-the', 'sadness', 'pain', 'turning', 'anger', 'face', 'was', 'hard', 'forget', 'marked', 'simplicity', 'just', 'Leigh', 'living', 'terrible', 'moment', 'watching.THE', 'MACHINIST', 'transcended', 'genres', 'transcended', 'time', 'space', 'even', 'place', 'filmed', 'Andalusian', 'limbo', 'thrust', 'nightmare', 'world', 'twists', 'dragon', 'tail', '-spiked', 'murderous', '-peopled', 'dark', 'characters', 'darker', 'deeds', 'suggesting', 'demons', 'lurking', 'unseen', 'shadows', 'permeated', 'deep', 'feeling', 'despair', 'anger', 'unknown', 'unknowable', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'art', 'design', 'psychology', 'writing', 'audience', 'member', 'must', 'be', 'top', 'cognitive', 'game', 'successfully', 'negotiate', 'twisted', 'journey', 'mind', 'tortured', 'soul']",N/A
894677,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007Y08QA,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","THE MACHINIST is a mesmerizing film, a journey through the interstices of a mind deprived of sleep, of nourishment, and a mind that struggles to untangle the chaos of a past of guilt and terror. And the journey is terrifying.When the film opens we meet Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) or at least the emaciated, tortured remains of a man who hasn't slept for a year.  We don't know why this worker in a machine factory is in such condition: the story unwinds slowly so that by the end we accompany Reznik in his shock to his moment of discovery.  It is the getting there that is the tough beauty of this amazingly rich film as written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.The setting is always dark as though the state of mind is a nightmare.  Reznik's meager existence is challenged when he is involved in an industrial accident in which a fellow worker Miller (Michael Ironside) loses an arm.  Shocked by the accident (for which Reznik feels responsible) the various few people in his life seem supportive: a hooker named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a waitress in an airport all night diner Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n), and an ambiguous bald man Ivan (John Sharian) who appears to Reznik in strange ways.Reznik's mind slowly disintegrates into paranoid delusions, the only way he can hold his life together is by post-its reminding him first of his documented progressive weight loss, then of his needs, then of his secret mystery.  To say more would be a great disservice to the extraordinary plot.Christian Bale delivers one of the most committed performances on film.  He not only physically inhabits Reznik with his skeletal appearance, he also mentally nurtures all the nuances of fear, pain, pleasure and madness that build as his character's reason for a year of insomnia is revealed at the very end.  We stand in suspense with him and his fall is as powerful as any Dante ever devised.  The entire cast is superb but special kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress.  Not an easy film, this, but a very important one.  Highly recommended - but not to see alone!

He is the thinnest man you might ever see for two odd hours. You might wonder if that is reason enough for you to watch this film and that is precisely why I took me a while to finally watch it. I like films that are based solely around one character but The Machinist is something else. I thought it would be easy to write a review for this film. Well, it's about time I start mine.I liked ""Fight Club"" but didn't like ""Memento"" too much and I thought ""Seven"" was good while I thought ""Lucky Number Slevin"" insulted movies. Some of these films werent as good as the others. The more popular ones had one or two characters to keep you interested. I liked Machinist because it had everything a character should be and more. In Trevor Reznik's heart resides a man of much mystery, intrigue and forgetfulness.I mean, 11 minutes into the film I knew I was going to love it. It is a masterpiece because it has to be watched again to be appreciated and understood. Some might argue and find faults - too bad for them.

I was amazed by the way Christian Bale literally destroyed himself for this role. His performance is unforgetable and will leave you stunned.Christian Bale plays the insomniac Trevor Reznik, who has not slept in a year. Trevor has forgotten why he has trouble sleeping and starts to doubt his sanity when he meets a co-worker that he has never seen before and no one else seems to see. Trevor works in a machine shop with very dangerous equipment. His work place becomes even more dangerous as he continues to see this co-worker and continues not to sleep. Determined to find out more about this man, Trevor goes to the extremes. The more he tries to find out about this co-worker the more he starts to remember what caused his insomnia.This movie will keep you guessing until the very end. Having seen many movies like this one, I have gotten pretty good at figuring out what is going to happen in the end, but not with this film. Once I thought I had this movie figured out, but it kept taking unexpected turns and I had no idea what was going to happen.

Even if you dissliked the movie, how about Christian Bale's performance? In American Psycho, he was all buff and tough but in this one he's so skinny it's disgusting. You can literally see all of his bones! So, you know what? For his performance and his effort, he deserves an oscar! Where is it? I thought he deserved one for American Psycho! You think I'm crazy? Well, you know what, this man has the right tone, facial expressions, and everything! In American Psycho, he was a mean, freaky guy who could also be funny. In this, he's troubled and you never quite know what's up with him. Also, I've had enough of everyone giving away the endings of movies! For all of you saying that it copied off a certain movie gives away the whole movie. Why do you people have to ruin the whole movie for us? Thankfully, I didn't come across any of those reviews before watching it! But, reviewers like you guys ruined Hide and Seek for me!Oh, and this movie was not very predictable! Come on! Like any of you knew the exact ending! James Bond movies are predictable. Why? Because you know what's going to happen! James Bond is going to kill everyone and be alive in the end! No! This movie isn't like that at all! And it's not predictable!Now for the actual movie. It's about Trevor Rezneck (Christian Bale), a guy who hasen't slept in over a year and who weighs barely anything. It's frightening to see him shirtless! Well, anyway, he's a solid worker, working with machines but he is a troubled man haunted by a mysterious man that no one else can see. And when Trevor causes an accident at work, things get more awry! Why can't he sleep? Who is this mysterious guy that no one else can see? All of this will be resolved in the end with a horrifying twist. The movie was very suspensful and intriguing and had me entertained all the way. It makes you think a little and it's memorable.

As soon as you see Christian Bale's skeletal body, and how emaciated he became just to play the part, you know there's something special here.The main character is Trevor Reznik, a machinist who lives a lonely life and suffers from chronic insomnia that's destroying his life (he hasn't slept in over a year). He's lost an incredible amount of weight because of his illness, and he's also developed compulsions (soaking his hands in bleach and scrubbing his bathroom floor with a toothbrush, for example). His insomnia, as well as a series of freakishly odd happenings, quickly leads to paranoia. When an accident happens at the workplace, Trevor is thrown into not only confusion, but guilt, as well, as he tries to work out who is leaving strange sticky notes in his apartment. Without giving out any spoilers (and there are plenty to give), the ending is not what you expect... and it's this ending that make or breaks you as a fan of psychological thrillers. Frankly, you'll either love the twist or feel cheated. I loved it.If you enjoy phsych movies, then ""The Machinist"" simply will not dissapoint you. Period. I feel that this movie is way underrated, especially given Bale's performance. But one thing that is misrepresented is the movie's own description of itself as outright ""horror."" I would never classify it as horror - it's definitely creepy, and it is way ""out there,"" but don't let the idea of HORROR turn you off. It's not.

One is struck, in watching ""The Machinist"", by what separates sanity from madness, what is real and what is unreal, and by the tenuous curtain that separates guilt from perpetrator.The mood of the film is dark; it has a texture like bitter sandpaper and oil-stained steel. The dialogue is in turns brusque and tender, and the relationships within the film are never static. When speaking with his prostitute girlfriend who sees Trevor (the character played by Christian Bale) as her way out of a life she is desperate to escape, Trevor is surprisingly malleable and almost tender. With his workmates, he is increasingly confused, suspicious, terrified. With the mysterious figure that no one but he can see, he is insistent, somehow aware that this man knows why he has not slept in over a year, why strange things are happening, what is happening...It's a tour de force of a performance. Many reviewers have already commented on the way in which Christian Bale starved himself to become skeletally thin to play this role. I've never seen anything like it - one is terrified for the health of Trevor, drawn into his awful sleepless suffering, not least because he looks like a man who's reaching the end of the road.The ending is indeed a shocker, a surprise that can scarcely be anticipated. It is the perfect, the most satisfying, ending I've seen in quite a while.

That quote is not an exaggeration: Trevor is six feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. He claims that he hasn't slept in a year, which is especially dangerous since he works in a factory operating heavy machinery, where appendages can abruptly find themselves devoid of a body if the equipment is not used correctly.Something is obviously wrong with Trevor. He goes to the same airport restaurant every night for coffee and pie and a little flirting session with a cute waitress (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n). He slums around his dingy apartment and the gray-tainted industrial streets of the city with dark circles under his eyes. Everyone, from his co-workers to a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who happens to be the only one he trusts, ask him if he's okay. ""It's nothing I can't handle,"" Trevor says, a quote that lingers in infamy throughout the film.Trevor's physical condition, slowly but surely, begins to wage a relentless war on his psyche, particularly when he meets a mysterious co-worker named Ivan, a man with two of his toes implanted on his fingerless hand and whom nobody else sees. This sets off a chain of events that lead Trevor to believe that there is a conspiracy against him, and that everyone is in on the plot. Either this is true and Trevor is a victim of a very cruel game or he is on the verge of losing his mind. Or maybe, just maybe, he already has.""The Machinist"" is a curious project, in that it's secrets are interconnected and seem to overlap one another. And the secrets themselves are revealed at moments where director Brad Anderson seems to be shying away from the material. This is just my guess, but ""The Machinist"" is probably an attempt to top ""One Hour Photo,"" a superior film in which a man's obsession with a family nearly drives him over the edge. When you watch Brad Anderson's atmospheric creeper, you realize that Trevor gives leeway to the old saying that says you are your worst enemy.Funny how Christian Bale dropped sixty pounds to play the role of Trevor and still managed to go through ""Batman Begins"" without pulling up his Batbelt. When you watch Trevor look into the mirror, all you see is a skeleton with skin, but that skeleton sure knows what he's doing. Bale apparently had to go through a lot to play this role, almost as much physical torture as Trevor endures. But watch how Bale plays his role with a no-nonsense attitude, and how he immerses his character in a nightmare that he can not wake up from.The supporting roles are fine, Leigh as the sympathizing hooker, S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n as the supportive waitress. Both women know that something is seriously wrong with Trevor, that something is plauging his mind. They want to help, but what they don't realize is that Trevor just wants their company. Still, in the end, when numerous surprises are unwrapped, the realities of the two women are redefined, and the women are revealed to have fresh meaning to Trevor's tormented mind.Exactly what is bugging Trevor seems somewhat contrived, albeit thoroughly convincing. It takes a lot of thought to imagine the pain that Trevor experiences day-in and day-out. You can conjure at least some amount of sympathy for this poor creature who lies awake at night, counting sheep, and reaching number 1,000,000 just before the sun rises and curses him with another day of life.Rated R; 101 minutes; Directed by Brad Anderson",4,The Machinist,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3534,"['were', 'thinner', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'someone', 'Trevor', 'Reznick', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'Machinist', 'quote', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'Trevor', 'six', 'feet', 'tall', '120', 'pounds', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'especially', 'dangerous', 'factory', 'operating', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'where', 'appendages', 'can', 'abruptly', 'find', 'devoid', 'body', 'equipment', 'not', 'used', 'correctly.Something', 'obviously', 'wrong', 'Trevor', 'same', 'airport', 'restaurant', 'night', 'coffee', 'pie', 'little', 'flirting', 'session', 'cute', 'waitress', 'Aitana', 'S', 'aacute', 'nchez-Gij', 'oacute', 'dingy', 'apartment', 'gray-tainted', 'industrial', 'streets', 'city', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'Everyone', 'co-workers', 'prostitute', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'ask', 'okay', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Trevor', 'quote', 'infamy', 'film.Trevor', 'physical', 'condition', 'slowly', 'surely', 'wage', 'relentless', 'war', 'psyche', 'particularly', 'when', 'mysterious', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Ivan', 'man', 'two', 'toes', 'implanted', 'fingerless', 'hand', 'whom', 'nobody', 'else', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'lead', 'Trevor', 'believe', 'conspiracy', 'everyone', 'plot', 'true', 'Trevor', 'victim', 'very', 'cruel', 'game', 'verge', 'losing', 'mind', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'already', 'Machinist', 'curious', 'project', 'secrets', 'are', 'interconnected', 'seem', 'overlap', 'one', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'moments', 'where', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'be', 'shying', 'away', 'material', 'just', 'guess', 'Machinist', 'probably', 'attempt', 'top', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'superior', 'film', 'man', 'obsession', 'family', 'nearly', 'edge', 'When', 'watch', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'atmospheric', 'creeper', 'realize', 'Trevor', 'leeway', 'old', 'saying', 'are', 'worst', 'enemy.Funny', 'how', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'dropped', 'sixty', 'pounds', 'play', 'role', 'Trevor', 'still', 'managed', 'go', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'pulling', 'up', 'Batbelt', 'When', 'watch', 'Trevor', 'look', 'mirror', 'see', 'skeleton', 'skin', 'skeleton', 'sure', 'what', 'doing', 'Bale', 'apparently', 'had', 'go', 'lot', 'play', 'role', 'almost', 'much', 'physical', 'torture', 'Trevor', 'watch', 'how', 'Bale', 'role', 'no-nonsense', 'attitude', 'how', 'character', 'nightmare', 'can', 'not', 'wake', 'up', 'from.The', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'fine', 'Leigh', 'sympathizing', 'hooker', 'S', 'aacute', 'nchez-Gij', 'oacute', 'supportive', 'waitress', 'women', 'know', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'Trevor', 'something', 'plauging', 'mind', 'want', 'help', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Trevor', 'just', 'company', 'Still', 'end', 'when', 'numerous', 'surprises', 'are', 'unwrapped', 'realities', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'redefined', 'women', 'are', 'revealed', 'have', 'fresh', 'meaning', 'Trevor', 'tormented', 'mind.Exactly', 'what', 'bugging', 'Trevor', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'lot', 'thought', 'imagine', 'pain', 'Trevor', 'day-in', 'day-out', 'can', 'conjure', 'least', 'amount', 'sympathy', 'poor', 'creature', 'who', 'awake', 'night', 'counting', 'sheep', 'reaching', 'number', '1,000,000', 'just', 'sun', 'rises', 'day', 'life.Rated', 'R', '101', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Brad', 'Anderson']",N/A

The story follows Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a machinist (natch) who hasn't slept for a year.  He also apparently hasn't eaten, as Reznik looks like he spent some serious time in a concentration camp (Taking method acting perhaps a step too far, Bale actually lost a dangerous amount of weight to play the role).  We follow Reznik's life as he moves from his job to his apartment, to the hooker (Jennifer Jason Lee) he visits, to the airport diner where his favorite waitress Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n) works.  As the film progresses, Reznik's world begins to degenerate into a surreal paranoia, beginning when a co-worker (Michael Ironside) loses an arm in a machine Reznik accidentally activates after being distracted by a another co-worker, Ivan, whose existence is repeatedly denied by the other characters in the film.  As Reznik searches for clues to this mystery, the answers threaten to shatter his perception of reality.The principle actors in the film all are very convincing, especially Christian Bale, who looks seriously haunted in this picture.  His Reznik is a walking bruise on the screen.  John Sharian as Ivan, the mystery man with the disfigured hand is also a compelling screen presence.

894692,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0007Y08QA,Jack E. Levic,"[3, 11]","I am surprised by the huge number of people who rate this movie very highly. It appears I am one of the minority who wanted to turn off this film after a few minutes. It's a very dark and unnerving film. There is little to like or appreciate about THE MACHINIST and it falls into the ""What were they thinking?"" category.There is one point to be made in favor of the film. It's clear that Christian Bale is a fine actor and he put his all into his role as Trevor Reznik. Reznik is literally wasting away from lack of sleep. He claims not to have slept in a year. He has lost a dangerous amount of weight and looks like a walking skeleton. It is shocking to see Christian Bale in his boxer shorts with absolutely no body fat and seriously underweight. Yes, he does remind one of WWII Concentration Camp victims. It is beyond unnerving.Because of his lack of sleep, Reznik is becoming a liability in his job as a machinist. He works in some type of machine shop but I don't think we are ever told what they are making. It's clear that the job is dangerous and any lack of concentration can and does lead to accidents. Reznik causes a serious accident and soon he thinks his coworkers are conspiring against him. A mysterious man named Ivan follows up. Strange messages are posted on his refrigerator door. Can anyone be trusted?Here is the pyschological thriller portion of the film. Are his coworkers conspiring against him or is lack of sleep driving Reznik insane? We know from the beginning of the film that a crime has been committed and I was determined to watch the film to the end to learn what had happened. THE MACHINIST is long and tedious and painful to watch. Despite his skeletor looks, Reznik knows a lovely waitress who fancies him. Also, the prostitute he visits regularly, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is clearly falling for him. Buy why? Reznik looks so seriously ill that he should be encouraged to get to a doctor.THE MACHINIST does improve slightly the last 3/4 of the film as things begin to fall into place--even is ever so slightly.I watched the extra features on this DVD and Christian Bale admits to literally stopping eating to ""starve"" himself for this role. The cast and crew seem to be impressed by his dedication. There is lots of talk about this movie never had a chance to be made because of its story. Finally a Spanish film company made THE MACHINIST with filming done in Spain. Barcelona doubled as Los Angeles--How they turned Barcelona into Los Angeles is interesting enough. The point is Bale risked his life and health for this film and why? Did it earn him an Academy Award or acclaim? He says he believed in this film and it was a film he would want to see so he was eager to play the role of Reznik.THE MACHINIST hit me on a personal level as someone who two years ago had a medical emergency where I could not eat or drink for two weeks. The extreme weight lost and medical problems that arose make me very unnerved that Christian Bale would INTENTIONALLY starve himself for this role. It was not worth the risks but I guess that is a dedicated actor for you.Here was film that unnerved me in every sense of the word. Clearly, lots of people liked it but this is definitely not a ""date night"" for ""family movie night"" film.",1,"DARK, DISTURBING AND UNNERVING FILM",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,3268,"['am', 'surprised', 'huge', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'rate', 'movie', 'very', 'highly', 'am', 'one', 'minority', 'who', 'wanted', 'turn', 'off', 'film', 'few', 'minutes', 'very', 'dark', 'unnerving', 'film', 'little', 'like', 'appreciate', 'THE', 'MACHINIST', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'category.There', 'one', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'favor', 'film', 'clear', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fine', 'actor', 'put', 'role', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Reznik', 'literally', 'wasting', 'away', 'lack', 'sleep', 'not', 'have', 'slept', 'year', 'lost', 'dangerous', 'amount', 'weight', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'shocking', 'see', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'boxer', 'shorts', 'absolutely', 'body', 'fat', 'seriously', 'underweight', 'Yes', 'remind', 'one', 'WWII', 'Concentration', 'Camp', 'victims', 'unnerving.Because', 'lack', 'sleep', 'Reznik', 'becoming', 'liability', 'job', 'machinist', 'type', 'machine', 'shop', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'ever', 'told', 'what', 'are', 'making', 'clear', 'job', 'dangerous', 'lack', 'concentration', 'can', 'lead', 'accidents', 'Reznik', 'serious', 'accident', 'soon', 'coworkers', 'are', 'conspiring', 'mysterious', 'man', 'named', 'Ivan', 'up', 'Strange', 'messages', 'are', 'posted', 'refrigerator', 'door', 'Can', 'anyone', 'be', 'trusted', 'Here', 'pyschological', 'thriller', 'portion', 'film', 'Are', 'coworkers', 'conspiring', 'lack', 'sleep', 'driving', 'Reznik', 'insane', 'know', 'beginning', 'film', 'crime', 'been', 'committed', 'was', 'determined', 'watch', 'film', 'end', 'learn', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'MACHINIST', 'long', 'tedious', 'painful', 'watch', 'skeletor', 'Reznik', 'lovely', 'waitress', 'who', 'Also', 'prostitute', 'regularly', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'clearly', 'falling', 'Buy', 'why', 'Reznik', 'so', 'seriously', 'ill', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'get', 'doctor.THE', 'MACHINIST', 'improve', 'slightly', 'last', '3/4', 'film', 'things', 'begin', 'fall', 'place', 'even', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly.I', 'watched', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'literally', 'stopping', 'eating', 'starve', 'role', 'cast', 'crew', 'seem', 'be', 'impressed', 'dedication', 'lots', 'talk', 'movie', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'made', 'story', 'Finally', 'Spanish', 'film', 'company', 'made', 'MACHINIST', 'filming', 'done', 'Spain', 'Barcelona', 'doubled', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'How', 'turned', 'Barcelona', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'interesting', 'enough', 'point', 'Bale', 'risked', 'life', 'health', 'film', 'why', 'Did', 'earn', 'Academy', 'Award', 'acclaim', 'believed', 'film', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'so', 'was', 'eager', 'play', 'role', 'Reznik.THE', 'MACHINIST', 'hit', 'personal', 'level', 'someone', 'who', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'medical', 'emergency', 'where', 'could', 'not', 'eat', 'drink', 'two', 'weeks', 'extreme', 'weight', 'lost', 'medical', 'problems', 'arose', 'make', 'very', 'unnerved', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'would', 'INTENTIONALLY', 'starve', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'risks', 'guess', 'dedicated', 'actor', 'you.Here', 'was', 'film', 'unnerved', 'sense', 'word', 'Clearly', 'lots', 'people', 'liked', 'definitely', 'not', 'date', 'night', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'film']",N/A

Typically, after we are introduced to these people, the viewer gets to watch their descent. The movie ends, the credits roll  and we wonder why we bothered.  Yet, we seem to gravitate to these anti-heroes. There are tons of movies like this: Grizzly Man, The Door in the Floor, Love Liza and Kiss of the Vampire to name only a few. So what separates the good movies from the bad? Story? Cast? Screenplay? Acting? All of the above. And the Machinist hits the bull's eye in all of these categories.In The Machinist, the acting and casting is top notch; starting with Bales incredible performance as the skeletal Trevor Reznick and right down to the management stooge that runs the grimy machine shop he works in. Both actor and director understand Trevor Reznick emotionally and physically.  We are shocked as this walking corpse's presence fills the screen. See Batman Begins first for the real Christian Bale. It's a fine movie, too and it will give you a pretty good idea of how hard this actor worked to create his character.The Machinist is a complicated, psychological study of the holistic nature of the human experience. Reality and fantasy are explored on all levels. But, in the end, we are treated to a gratifying conclusion as everything falls into place and finally the character makes sense to us. For me, this movie has a happy ending as Trevor is finally released. In Love Liza, the main character finally overcomes his fear.

When compared to Trevor Reznick (Bale), a man whose guilt and paranoia has caused multiple years of a schizophrenic insomnia, those exhausting days are child's play.Finding slight camaraderie from a factory co-worker, Miller (Michael Ironside), comfort in the bed of a hooker named Stevie (Leigh), and friendship from an airport waitress (Sanchez-Gijon), Reznick drags his emaciated skeleton throughout the day, almost embracing the starvation and insanity, ignoring his hunger and sleep deprivation.  When Miller loses an arm in a work-related accident - a direct result of Reznick's hallucination-filled negligence - the world begins to crumble amidst habitual post-it notes, the disposal of a dead body, and a mysterious game of hangman.Revealed through flashbacks and sleep distractions, the cause of Trevor's increasing alienation and withdrawal from reality receives a twist when he sees Ivan (John Sharian), a creepy colleague who nobody else can see.  Convinced he's being plotted against, Trevor grows crazier until the very end.  The clever blend of repressed memories and psychotic conceptions, it'sMementoandFight Clubrolled into one.First and foremost, this is a vehicle for Christian Bale's dedication to character acting.  Literally destroying his own body, Bale looks like a concentration camp victim throughout the movie, and is completely believable as a person who hasn't slept in over a year.  A growing self-awareness and guilt oozes from Bale's pores, as he absolutely nails the role.  When a beautiful woman destroys her looks, she receives an award (Theron inMonster).  When a man goes much further, he's overlooked.  It's almost as disturbing as Bale's appearance in this film.I, like Reznick, just want to find peace within this movie.  On one hand I admire the dedication and bizarre storyline; conversely, however, there are several moments in which this movie drags.  With the eerie cinematography, music, and dedication involved, this is an original movie deserving of praise.  The only downfall is that it's a tad monotonous and boring at times, and the viewer ends up finding a slight insomnia cure from which Reznick suffers.Jason Elin",3,Half of Christian Bale is still better than most,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2311,"['know', 'days', 'where', 'are', 'dog-tired', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'bed', 'go', 'zombie', 'mode', 'lunch', 'break', 'not', 'tired', 'When', 'compared', 'Trevor', 'Reznick', 'Bale', 'man', 'guilt', 'paranoia', 'caused', 'multiple', 'years', 'schizophrenic', 'insomnia', 'exhausting', 'days', 'are', 'child', 'play.Finding', 'slight', 'camaraderie', 'factory', 'co-worker', 'Miller', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'comfort', 'bed', 'hooker', 'named', 'Stevie', 'Leigh', 'friendship', 'airport', 'waitress', 'Sanchez-Gijon', 'Reznick', 'emaciated', 'skeleton', 'day', 'almost', 'embracing', 'starvation', 'insanity', 'ignoring', 'hunger', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'When', 'Miller', 'arm', 'work-related', 'accident', 'direct', 'result', 'Reznick', 'hallucination-filled', 'negligence', 'world', 'crumble', 'amidst', 'habitual', 'post-it', 'notes', 'disposal', 'dead', 'body', 'mysterious', 'game', 'hangman.Revealed', 'flashbacks', 'sleep', 'distractions', 'cause', 'Trevor', 'increasing', 'alienation', 'withdrawal', 'reality', 'twist', 'when', 'Ivan', 'John', 'Sharian', 'creepy', 'colleague', 'who', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'Convinced', 'being', 'plotted', 'Trevor', 'crazier', 'very', 'end', 'clever', 'blend', 'repressed', 'memories', 'psychotic', 'conceptions', ""it'sMementoandFight"", 'Clubrolled', 'one.First', 'foremost', 'vehicle', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'dedication', 'character', 'acting', 'Literally', 'destroying', 'own', 'body', 'Bale', 'concentration', 'camp', 'victim', 'movie', 'completely', 'believable', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'growing', 'self-awareness', 'guilt', 'oozes', 'Bale', 'pores', 'absolutely', 'role', 'When', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'looks', 'award', 'Theron', 'inMonster', 'When', 'man', 'much', 'further', 'overlooked', 'almost', 'as', 'disturbing', 'Bale', 'appearance', 'film.I', 'Reznick', 'just', 'want', 'find', 'peace', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'admire', 'dedication', 'bizarre', 'storyline', 'conversely', 'however', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'movie', 'eerie', 'cinematography', 'music', 'dedication', 'involved', 'original', 'movie', 'deserving', 'praise', 'only', 'downfall', 'tad', 'monotonous', 'boring', 'times', 'viewer', 'up', 'finding', 'slight', 'insomnia', 'cure', 'Reznick', 'suffers.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

Christian Bale is almost unrecognizable in the lead role of Trevor Reznik, a lonely machinist. Bale supposedly lost over 60 pounds for this role and believe me that's on the conservative side. The sheer horror of Bale's body alone is creepy enough to sustain the suspense in this movie. I have never seen an actor take his body to the absolute extreme like Bale does in this film. The story centers around Reznik's increasingly slippery grip on reality. Trevor Reznik has not slept for over a year and the effects on his physical and mental state are obvious. He can't eat and drinks only black coffee. Then, one day he accidently maim's a fellow worker and his tenuous grip on reality slides away. There are some nagging questions presented by director Brad Anderson throughout The Machinist. Why can't Trevor sleep? Who is leaving those notes on his refrigerator? Who is Ivan and why is he following Trevor? What is in Trevor's freezer? The Machinist creeps along at an almost glacial pace but it wraps up very neatly in the end. At it's core The Machinist comes down to the struggle for a man's soul. It will inevitably draw comparisons to David Fincher's Fight Club but without the social commentary. Bale's performace carries the film and will go down as one of the most haunting performances of the past decade.

894702,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0007Y08QA,J from NY,"[0, 0]","Brad Anderson has the potential to be that rare breed of artist: a great horror movie director.  This breed is even rarer nowadays, when the temptation of big budget Hollywood crapfests like ""Scream"" and ""The Exorcist III:The Beginning"" loom so large, promising millions for anyone involved just as long asthe blood flows aplenty, the actresses are well known and have bra sizes exceeding the standard, and some reference to great horror flicks of old are contained in the title/dialogue.""The Machinist"", when all the desperate illusions are stripped away, is essentially about a man in denial.  Christian Bale's performance as Trevor Reznick, a not-so-generic industrial worker, is so good that at times he is actually frightening.  Not having slept in a year, his ghostly existence is punctuated only by moments of hope.  He looks like he just escaped from a Nazi death camp, and becomes more pale and impoverished as the film rolls on.  The observant viewer will notice more than a little of Dostoevsky in this film: at one point we catch Trevor reading ""The Idiot"" at home, a book which in fact is entirely inappropriate for his real situation.  Later on, in a very fleeting moment, we see ""Crime and Punishment"", which is much more appropriate.  This film could easily be seen from a religious angle, although I think this would be wrong: Trevor is an ascetic of the most dementedly enthusiastic sort, throwing himself in front of cars and immolating his life in a thousand ways in order to atone for an act which can can never be really forgiven.The meaning of the movie aside, everything about it is so Kafka-esque, laced with paranoia of the most dreadful kind, and hallucinatory that one is hooked from the moment the film begins.  During the course of it a man loses his arm due to Trevor's ""negligence"": he goes on a Halloween carnival ride which quickly becomes an excrutiating peek into his tortured subconscious:and above all, he engages in a strange pursuit of Ivan, a tall, bald, recklessly honest figure, the one factor in his life he desperately wants to be rid of.Far better than ""Memento"", which I believe it is patterned after somewhat, this is yet another horror masterpiece by Brad Anderson.

I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting a masterpiece that would get me thinking in the way it did.  The thing that most impressed me was (second from the acting) the way it sort of re-created the mood and feel of an old Alfred Hichcock movie, the soundtrack was even reminiscent of Psycho's a few times.  I bet it also wouldn't be much different of a movie if you switched your TV to B&W.  I wish I could, but I can't really rave about the story without giving too much away, so I'll go ahead and rave about Christian Bale.  I first saw him in Reign of Fire, and he didn't really impress me, just sort of the average British actor, but when I saw him in Equilibrium and American Psycho I was stunned.  I love the way he speakes in an American accent if you want to call it that.  If you've seen American Psycho, than you know how buff and perfect his body was for the roll of Patrick Bateman.  Well, imagine everything about his appearence in that movie, only opposite.  He dropped his weight down to 120 something pounds, that is dedication.  Another actor who I was glad to see was Michael Ironside who is able to play so well a terrifying villain, or a intimidating, yet really nice guy.  I can't say I knew any of the other actors, but they all did a great job.

Trevor Reznik lives a lonely and withering life.  Every day he works as a machinist at a factory, he goes out of his way to eat at the airport's diner just to converse with the waitress that works there, and he has befriended a hooker whom he still pays for sex even though their relationship is more than that.  Trevor tries to figure who he is and where his life is going, but it only seems as if it's withering away like his body.  He meets a guy named Ivan who distracts him and causes Trevor to trip the machine that cuts his co-worker's arm off, but apparently this man doesn't exist.  Different clues are given to the audience as this tense thriller unfolds.  Trevor tries to make sense of things that couldn't possibly have happened, while he starts losing trust of everybody around him.  This smartly crafted thriller has all the right ingredients and everything connects, but in the end it falls short of making a lasting impact.  You have to look at more as a character study of Trevor Reznik rather than a tense psychological thriller.  This man is basically dead inside and has no life to live or people to care for him except a prostitute.  Now he believes that a plot of revenge is placed on him for the accident he caused.  The ending connects with everything in the movie, but the movie does not have as much depth as it should have.  It is however one of the better attempts at this genre because the last hundred movies that tried a thriller failed miserably such as Twisted, Taking Lives, and the recent crapfest that is Saw.ACTING: Christian Bale gives an amazing performance and once again shows us that he is one of the most talented young actors out there.  He also shows us that he is a dedicated actor.  Bale lost 63 Pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik, and just stopped eating to accomplish this.  I salute Christain Bale.  The rest of the cast is composed of mostly unkown actors.  One person who people might recognize is Michael Ironside, voice of Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell game series, he also starred in Starship Troopers and The Perfect Storm.  The weight of the movie lies on Bale and he carries it through like any veteran would, and may I add that  probably no veteran actor would agree to lose that much weight.BOTTOM LINE: This movie is a ""what you see is what you get"" and unfortunetly doesn't go deeper.  The movie is tense and very well made.  The cinematography was excellent and the color tones were very creepy.

894716,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0007Y08QA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Having seen two recent films that challenge the notion of reality, I'm starting to question my own life. How much of what I've experienced is real and how much can be attributed to the workings of my lunatic mind. ""The Machinist"" and ""Stay"", films with very dissimilar plots, share the same themes and stylistic conventions. In both, the viewer is asked to put his faith in a story that doesn't necessarily make sense in the rational world. I have an enormous fear of this type of picture--because often times, in the end, what doesn't make sense simply doesn't make sense. And what a let down, after having sat through a complex and narratively challenging film--to be left with nothing to show for it.Both films share the same deliberate pacing. Both were marketed in the realm of pshycological thriller--but, in truth, fall squarely in the drama category. Both films boast great performaces. In ""The Machinist"", Christian Bale, having lost a third of his body weight for this film, is exemplary. As a man who hasn't slept for a year, he is hauntingingly believable as he struggles to make sense of his surroundings and what is happening to him. In ""Stay"", we've got Ryan Gosling and Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist and his patient. Both are terrific, as each is somehow displaced from the real world.Both films tip their hat early on that all is not as it seems. With deja vu, disjointed editing, overlapping plot points--you know you've entered into a puzzle, a pshychological mindgame. You either buy into the story or not and you try to understand what is real and what's in the mind. And all along, you hope for the payoff--that you will ultimately be rewarded for your intellectual effort.And here's where the films diverge...""The Machinist"" pays off. I let out a huge sigh of relief, empathized and understood the ending. The film by Brad Anderson (director of a great little thriller ""Session 9"") is a rich and emotional journey--one well worth taking. ""Stay"", however, is another story. While the ending isn't difficult to comprehend--it is far too simplistic for all that has transpired previously. It's a big let down for someone hoping for something clever or original--the picture becomes a fantasy upon fantasy construct and a bit of a cheat.Neither film is perfect--but ""The Machinist"" is an intriguing film made by talented people. It's worthy of a 4 star rating. ""Stay"" is, ultimately, an exercise in futility--but I'd give it 2 stars for its performances.

894717,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007Y08QA,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 0]","The obscure world of insomnia dilutes the life of protagonist Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) whose very existence seems to slowly fade into nothingness.  His is an existence where sleeplessness, melancholy, and loneliness seem to rule, and his appearance supports this notion that gives the impression of either being a victim of the Nazi concentrations camps, or a dope fiend.  It is painful to watch the skinniness of Trevor when he dresses himself or moves around without a shirt.  His bones protrude his skin in such a manner that it is almost possible to use him for a skeletal anatomy lesson.  Trevor writes down his continual weight loss on small notes that he places on the wall while it becomes possible to see his weight loss.  A prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whom he frequently visits even tells him that if he would be any thinner he would not exist.In the opening scene Trevor rolls up a carpet with much difficulty while a pair of feet stick out the end of the carpet.  After he has rolled up the carpet Trevor walks up to the window where a close up of him confirms that he has gone through some physical abuse.  He drives off to some remote location on the seaside with the carpet in the back of his pickup truck.  There he prepares himself to throw the carpet into the sea when a stranger who asks him, ""Who are you"", interrupts him.  Later at home Trevor washes his hands in bleach while the camera angle from the bedroom reveals a flashlight on the bed.  It looks like the flashlight that the stranger might have used a scene earlier.Trevor is a machinist at a small factory.  It is a dirty, greasy, and dangerous job, but his foreman does not seem to care when he only continues to urge them to work harder and faster.  The camaraderie is close between the workers who frequently play poker together, or tell each other jokes to liven up the atmosphere.  However, Trevor always avoids his coworkers even when they ask him to join them for poker, as he always has other plans.  His plans consist of three things while struggling with his yearlong insomnia.  Trevor frequently visits the call girl Stevie, which was already mentioned, and he spends his late nights at an airport cafeteria to drink coffee and talk to the waitress that works the graveyard shift, but he always leaves at 1:30 AM.  The rest of the time he spends at home where he reads and watches TV, as he endures the power of his insomnia.  One of the novels that he read is Fyodor Dostoevski's The Idiot.Eventually things begin to catch up with Trevor.  It all starts when he meets Ivan (John Sharian) during one of his breaks after a troublesome meeting with his boss.  On a later occasion, Ivan distracts him when he is supposed to help one of his coworkers who ends up in a severe accident.  Consequently, the plot begin to thicken, as Trevor's coworkers express their contempt for him, Ivan continues to put him in danger, and someone leaves a secret code in form of hangman on his refrigerator.  Amidst the hazy consciousness Trevor begin to feel the affects of his sleep deprivation while he also feels that someone is on his tail.  The question is who and why is someone following him, as his life begins to get more and more muddled by continuing complex problems.The Machinist presents an intriguing tale where the main character finds himself in a paranoid world and the twilights of insomnia grab his awareness.  The director Brad Anderson provides a stunning effort framing several of the scenes in wonderful compositions enhanced with the cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez and Charlie Jiminez.  These three filmmakers succeed in a brilliant way to capture the perception of Trevor, as he finds himself in a complicated situation.  Another captivating facet of the film emerges through the mise-en-scene, which offers much detail to what takes place in the story.  Lastly, the performance by Christian Bale is tremendous who went through a rough diet to perform the part, as he lost some 60 pounds.  Altogether, the Machinist will keep the audience in thoughts while the ominous world of Trevor comes into sight, which will leave them thinking for some time after the film.",4,An Ominously Dark and Hauntingly Terrific Thriller...,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,4192,"['obscure', 'world', 'insomnia', 'life', 'protagonist', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'very', 'existence', 'slowly', 'fade', 'nothingness', 'existence', 'where', 'sleeplessness', 'melancholy', 'loneliness', 'seem', 'rule', 'appearance', 'notion', 'impression', 'being', 'victim', 'Nazi', 'concentrations', 'camps', 'dope', 'fiend', 'painful', 'watch', 'skinniness', 'Trevor', 'when', 'moves', 'shirt', 'bones', 'protrude', 'skin', 'such', 'manner', 'almost', 'possible', 'use', 'skeletal', 'anatomy', 'lesson', 'Trevor', 'down', 'continual', 'weight', 'loss', 'small', 'notes', 'wall', 'possible', 'see', 'weight', 'loss', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Stevie', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'whom', 'frequently', 'even', 'would', 'be', 'thinner', 'would', 'not', 'exist.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'Trevor', 'up', 'carpet', 'much', 'difficulty', 'pair', 'feet', 'stick', 'out', 'end', 'carpet', 'rolled', 'up', 'carpet', 'Trevor', 'window', 'where', 'close', 'gone', 'physical', 'abuse', 'remote', 'location', 'seaside', 'carpet', 'back', 'pickup', 'truck', 'throw', 'carpet', 'sea', 'when', 'stranger', 'who', 'Who', 'are', 'Later', 'home', 'Trevor', 'hands', 'bleach', 'camera', 'angle', 'bedroom', 'flashlight', 'bed', 'flashlight', 'stranger', 'might', 'have', 'used', 'scene', 'earlier.Trevor', 'machinist', 'small', 'factory', 'dirty', 'greasy', 'dangerous', 'job', 'foreman', 'not', 'seem', 'care', 'when', 'only', 'urge', 'work', 'harder', 'faster', 'camaraderie', 'close', 'workers', 'who', 'frequently', 'play', 'poker', 'together', 'tell', 'other', 'jokes', 'liven', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'However', 'Trevor', 'always', 'coworkers', 'even', 'when', 'ask', 'join', 'poker', 'always', 'other', 'plans', 'plans', 'consist', 'three', 'things', 'struggling', 'yearlong', 'insomnia', 'Trevor', 'frequently', 'call', 'girl', 'Stevie', 'was', 'already', 'mentioned', 'late', 'nights', 'airport', 'cafeteria', 'drink', 'coffee', 'talk', 'waitress', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'always', '1:30', 'AM', 'rest', 'time', 'home', 'where', 'watches', 'TV', 'power', 'insomnia', 'One', 'novels', 'read', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevski', 'Idiot.Eventually', 'things', 'begin', 'catch', 'up', 'Trevor', 'when', 'Ivan', 'John', 'Sharian', 'one', 'breaks', 'troublesome', 'meeting', 'boss', 'later', 'occasion', 'Ivan', 'when', 'supposed', 'help', 'one', 'coworkers', 'who', 'up', 'severe', 'accident', 'Consequently', 'plot', 'begin', 'thicken', 'Trevor', 'coworkers', 'express', 'contempt', 'Ivan', 'put', 'danger', 'someone', 'secret', 'code', 'form', 'hangman', 'refrigerator', 'hazy', 'consciousness', 'Trevor', 'begin', 'feel', 'affects', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'also', 'someone', 'tail', 'question', 'who', 'why', 'someone', 'following', 'life', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'muddled', 'continuing', 'complex', 'problems.The', 'Machinist', 'intriguing', 'tale', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'paranoid', 'world', 'twilights', 'insomnia', 'grab', 'awareness', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'stunning', 'effort', 'framing', 'several', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'compositions', 'enhanced', 'cinematography', 'Xavi', 'Gim', 'eacute', 'Charlie', 'Jiminez', 'three', 'filmmakers', 'succeed', 'brilliant', 'way', 'capture', 'perception', 'Trevor', 'complicated', 'situation', 'captivating', 'facet', 'film', 'mise-en-scene', 'much', 'detail', 'what', 'place', 'story', 'Lastly', 'performance', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'tremendous', 'who', 'went', 'rough', 'diet', 'perform', 'part', 'lost', '60', 'pounds', 'Altogether', 'Machinist', 'will', 'keep', 'audience', 'thoughts', 'ominous', 'world', 'Trevor', 'sight', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'time', 'film']",N/A
894718,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0007Y08QA,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[24, 26]","no accident that the main character's named Trevor Reznik; the filmmaker, Brad Anderson, is a fan of Nine Inch Nails, fronted by Trent Reznor: the same dark gloomy kinda thing spills over from the Nine Inch Nails music into this film, with its dark gray washed out interiors and just as dank cloudy exteriors (but they appear only when Trevor's by himself--watch how, for example, when he meets other people, like his co-worker Miller and Miller's wife, the sky is a lot clearer).Trevor, the ever-insomniac, not only evokes Trent Reznor but also Cesare from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari--the ever-present sleepwalker. Trevor is more of a walksleeper than a sleepwalker; he hasn't copped any zees in a year (not very credible, actually; if that were really true, he'd be dead a few times over), moving around in a paranoid daze with a number of flashes of rationality, and solace provided by either a friendly hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) or a comely waitress (a beautiful Spanish actress whose name escapes me).The film is uncompromising and because of that no American production company would finance it. It was paid for and shot in Barcelona, Spain--which not too many people know about--and the director did everything he could to make the Spanish exteriors and interiors look American.Trevor is played by Christian Bale, he of the formerly smarmy demeanor in American Psycho, but here reduced by 63 pounds from his former self to the aforementioned Cesare-like walking skeleton resemblance kinda thing. Watching him without his shirt on is truly painful. Disturbing. Which, of course, is the point.Accidents follow Trevor wherever he goes. This is the core of the film. He's also followed by his own personal demon, Ivan, who's invisible to everyone else. Ivan has a severly deformed hand, like that of a thalidomide-afflicted person, and a grin that could slice your ear off. Bald, thickset, and a Southern accent to boot. Just as creepy as Trevor. Maybe more.So what is this film about? It's really about guilt. That's it in a nutshell. Guilt, fear, and the persistence of memory, as our friend Salvador Dali would say. Not exactly a bouncy piece of work. Not something to watch with old Aunt Millie sitting next to you, hoping for Cary Grant to come on and say something utterly and stupidly charming.Trevor's life is grit; he works in a machine shop factory kinda thing where the workers are all union members who live life day to day and stick up for each other and resent anyone who isn't just like them. So naturally, that leaves our anti-hero out of the picture. He forgets to pay his utility bill at home and his lights go out. Post-Its keep appearing on his refrigerator with a game of Hangman he never started but there's no way of knowing who's leaving those Post-Its there. Is there?Not only is this about guilt, but also about karma. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. What goes around comes around. Stuff like that. You can't escape the past. You can try...but you can't. Ever.That's what this is about. Dark, disturbing, deranged. The three D's.

Boring and predictable are not the makings of a good suspense movie. When the guy's arm gets cut off?--C'mon, everybody saw that from a mile away. Too bad the movie ignores some other things too. Like the fact that there really aren't any ""machinist"" jobs in the United States anymore (they've mostly been moved to 3rd world nations to exploit the slave labor); also, it isn't likely that the kind of a guy who would be a machinist would also be the kind of a philosophical guy who'd be reading ""The Idiot"" by Dostoevsky. Then again, you never actually ""see"" the protagonist reading Dostoevsky; you just see him handling the book. A pretentious little move by the moviemaker, kind of like name-dropping in a conversation, since the message of ""The Idiot"" has really nothing to do with the message of this movie, unless the moviemaker simply meant the title of that Dostoevsky book, which is a pretty shallow, un-learned, un-read metaphor. Geez. And this is, after all, a movie which tries to be like a Dostoevski novel, in terms of guilt and conscious-strickenness, good and evil, yada-yada-yada. But where Dostoevsky compelled you turn the page, where Dosto fascinated, this movie simply makes you feel lousy. I think the difference is this: Dostoevsky knew there was an actual Good which should be striven for, and this was his message. This movie, however, too steeped in the existentialist zeitgeist of nowadays, offers nothing in the way of an absolute Good, an absolute Right to counter all that is wrong in this world. So it leaves you with no hope, something Dostoevsky, whose hope was Jesus Christ, would never have done.So if you don't want to feel lousy, don't bother with this flick.At least a comparably dark work of fiction (though infinitely better constructed), the movie and novel ""1984"" had a purpose to being so bleak--that work was a warning to people. This movie had no warning, because it had no message.In terms of filming methods, the choppy, time-jumbled method with which this film was made--well, ""Memento"" did it a heckuva lot better.",1,Stop the Dostoevsky Comparisons Already,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,2185,"['shame', 'Mr.', 'Bale', 'lost', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'likely', 'expense', 'own', 'health', 'doubleplusungood', 'flick', 'Boring', 'predictable', 'are', 'not', 'makings', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'When', 'guy', 'arm', 'cut', 'off', ""C'mon"", 'everybody', 'saw', 'mile', 'away', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'other', 'things', 'too', 'fact', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'machinist', 'jobs', 'United', 'States', 'anymore', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'been', 'moved', '3rd', 'world', 'nations', 'exploit', 'slave', 'labor', 'also', ""n't"", 'likely', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'machinist', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'kind', 'philosophical', 'guy', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'reading', 'Idiot', 'Dostoevsky', 'Then', 'again', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'protagonist', 'reading', 'Dostoevsky', 'just', 'see', 'handling', 'book', 'pretentious', 'little', 'move', 'moviemaker', 'kind', 'like', 'name-dropping', 'conversation', 'message', 'Idiot', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'message', 'movie', 'moviemaker', 'simply', 'meant', 'title', 'Dostoevsky', 'book', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'un-learned', 'un-read', 'metaphor', 'Geez', 'movie', 'be', 'Dostoevski', 'novel', 'terms', 'guilt', 'conscious-strickenness', 'good', 'evil', 'yada-yada-yada', 'where', 'Dostoevsky', 'compelled', 'turn', 'page', 'where', 'Dosto', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'simply', 'feel', 'lousy', 'think', 'difference', 'Dostoevsky', 'knew', 'was', 'actual', 'Good', 'should', 'be', 'striven', 'was', 'message', 'movie', 'however', 'too', 'steeped', 'existentialist', 'zeitgeist', 'nowadays', 'offers', 'nothing', 'way', 'absolute', 'Good', 'absolute', 'Right', 'counter', 'wrong', 'world', 'hope', 'something', 'Dostoevsky', 'hope', 'was', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'done.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'lousy', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'flick.At', 'least', 'comparably', 'dark', 'work', 'fiction', 'infinitely', 'better', 'constructed', 'movie', 'novel', '1984', 'had', 'purpose', 'being', 'so', 'bleak', 'work', 'was', 'warning', 'people', 'movie', 'had', 'warning', 'had', 'message.In', 'terms', 'filming', 'methods', 'choppy', 'time-jumbled', 'method', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'Memento', 'did', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

I mean he started as a boy in Speilberg's ""Empire Under the Sun"" (watch it and be amazed at his acting skills even then) and starred in such groundbreaking roles as ""American Pyscho"", and yet he is often overlooked when great actors are mentioned.  This movie should move him up to the top of the list.  Here he delineates a character to such a powerful degree that sometimes I simply stared at the screen in disbelief.  I hardly recognized him at first, he was so skinny that every bone showed......please let that be the product of some Hollywood magic?  The storyline is eerie and compelling and recounted so many times here that I will leave it alone.  The dialogue is smart and every character is well played (even if Jennifer Jason Leigh has the downtrodden prostitute role down to a science).  Although I loved this movie and gave it 5 stars, I do have one complaint.  I felt this movie reminded me too much of another film (not going to name it outright & make you think the same thing other to say a Ed Norton vehicle) which affected my initial viewing to a point.

894729,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B0007Y08QA,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[2, 2]","""The Machinist"" is a film about guilt and innocence; its central character is obsessed with rules and regulations, cleanliness, the proper assignation of responsibility and blame. He says once that ""a little guilt goes a long way,"" and we believe him; it seems central to his existence. ""The Machinist"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is a very good one. It centers on the emotional unravelling of one man, Trevor Reznik, who is told several times in the movie ""If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."" It is not something one needs to be reminded of; Trevor calls to mind the haunted skeletal forms of Holocaust victims. In a way this is fitting; he is the victim of his own private torture, trapped in a world of bleak gray and cold steel-blue. The grief that torments him - and has rendered him sleepless for a year - has literally eaten away at him, body and soul.Trevor is a machinist, a particularly astute one who knows every rule and keeps them all punctiliously. The job and his associates hold little in the way of comfort or pleasure; one senses that Trevor could use quite a lot of both. Once we see him reading, the closest thing to leisure time he seems to afford himself; he is reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot,"" and one wonders if it is an ironic comment on his own existence, a lonely man adrift in a sea of cold hypocrisy. He is not an innocent, as is ultimately revealed, but he is definitely a victim.He has a standing arrangement with Stevie, a hooker who has apparently decided that this broken-down wreck of a man is worth her Heart of Gold. They do have sex - though one worries about him even then; his wraithlike form threatens to break if handled less than delicately - but their connection is more emotional than physical; he turns to her more than once to help him maintain the thin shreds he retains of his sanity. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a subtle and touching performance here, conveying sympathy without condescension and kindness without treacle.He has another engagement, of sorts, with Marie, a kind-hearted waitress at the airport just outside town. He spends every night with her there, going out of his way to see her, drinking coffee and not eating the pie she serves him. She regards him, one senses, with the same sort of tenderness and nurturing that she does her young son. He certainly needs it. Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n, a virtual unknown in the States but deservingly respected elsewhere, gives another of the film's outstanding performances, as a woman kind-hearted but always just slightly intangible.There are several layers of metaphor at work in the film, particularly in the emphasis on ""left,"" which carries with it implications of the sinister and ominous. The hangman game progresses right to left; the Other Man in the photo appears on the left. Thrice Trevor encounters a Fork in the Road, and each time the left represents the more dangerous path. It is a small but lovely touch on the part of director Brad Anderson that only the third and final time Trevor is faced with such a choice does he choose the Right.The film's plot consists mostly of psychological games; strange post-it notes that resemble incomplete games of Hangman, a grimly dripping refrigerator, and a menacingly bald and grinning Man in Black are only a few of its elements. In some ways, particularly stylistically, it reminded me of ""Memento,"" although ""The Machinist"" is not as non-linear as that film. These elements are interesting the first time through, and gain even more meaning the second, when the reason for Trevor's disintegration is understood.And what a disintegration it is. Trevor makes a complete descent into Hell, which for him is the darkness of his own tormented soul. It is made believable by his cadaverous appearance, ghastly skin, eerily bright eyes; he is a man who looks not only as if he has seen Death, but keeps him constant company.Much has been made of the fact that the usually-buff Christian Bale lost 63 pounds - almost a third of his normal body weight - to play this role. One barely recognizes him here, particularly in contrast to his extremely well-cut physique in films like ""American Psycho"" or ""Batman Begins."" Here his every move, every facial expression reveals the movement of bone beneath sallow, paper-thin skin. His clothes hang from his frame. Bale's normally attention-grabbing eyes gain an almost spectral intensity here, as they bulge glittering from their darkened hollows. His appearance is indeed so haggard that even the film's admittedly dramatic punchline almost fails to explain it, and at times it even distracts from the action as one begins to worry about him. Severely. One winces frequently, and I never quite got accustomed to his skeletal presence onscreen.Bale's performance, however, is complex and nuanced, and, like the drastic weight loss, goes far beyond the call of duty. Like his performance in ""American Psycho"" (also documenting a man's distancing himself from humanity) Bale here shows no shred of self-preservation, no hint of holding back anything from the role. He not only looks the part but inhabits it, bringing all the weight of his impressive talent to bear. It is this single-minded dedication to the character, and his virtuoso performance, that elevates an otherwise engaging but not mind-blowing psychodrama to a gloomy but impressive work of art.",4,"""A

894731,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0007Y08QA,Michael Crane,"[101, 108]","I have to say that ""The Machinist"" is easily the most unsettling, disturbing and bizarre film I have seen so far this year.  I mean, you can tell from reading the back of the DVD cover and seeing how disturbingly thin Christian Bale in pictures from the movie that this is not going to be a very happy time.  Yet, last night I was in the mood for something dark and uncompromising.  I got it and then some with this cleverly haunting film that is unforgettable.Bale plays ""Trevor Reznik,"" a troubled and fatigued machinist who hasn't slept for a year.  He lives his life in isolation, with the few minor exceptions such as a friendly prostitute who takes a liking to him and an airport coffee shop waitress he visits every night.  Things take a turn for the worst when he meets a fellow machinist for the first time... but nobody knows who this guy is.  They tell Trevor that he doesn't exist.  The paranoia and confusion leads to a horrific accident on the job that involves his co-worker.  And that's when he gets the strange notes in his apartment.  Either Trevor is completely delusional and has lost his mind... or somebody really is out to get him.What's really intriguing about the movie is that just like Trevor, we do not know exactly what is real or what is made up.  There are times when we're doubtful of what we're seeing, and then we get roped in and second-guess ourselves.  The movie is a non-stop dread fest that just speaks of loneliness and paranoia, and that's why it works.  It looks and feels exactly like it should.  From the very first few minutes, it's easy to realize that this is going to be one unsettling and dark experience.  It is one that you may want to re-watch after you see it all.  You'll definitely think about it for a while after it's all said and done, but personally I didn't think it was that hard to piece together after it was over.  It made sense, and it made even more sense on the second viewing.  Christian Bale is fantastic in this.  I can't believe he dropped down to around 100 pounds for the role.  Yes, you should be warned that Bale looks EXTREMELY skinny in this... almost like a walking skeleton, as was intended in the script.  I think the movie was very well written and directed.This isn't a movie for those who get easily disturbed or freaked out.  It's a pretty uneasy movie to watch.  Let's just say you won't feel extremely cheerful after you get done watching this.  You may want to put on something funny after you're done, otherwise you're going to have this movie stuck in your head while you try to sleep.  The DVD has a little to offer in the extra features department, such as commentary from the director, a making of feature, 8 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.I really enjoyed ""The Machinist.""  It surprised me and kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I have to say that I kind of missed watching dark movies like this.  Seems like there's too many ""cutesy-wutesy"" movies for the family, so it's good to see something so brutal, so raw and so in your face like this.  If you want to be disturbed and see something that isn't your typical thriller, ""The Machinist"" is something to put down on your list of movies to see.  As depressing and dreadful as this movie can get... I'm ready to see it again. -Michael Crane",5,"""I just want to sleep...""",1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3299,"['have', 'say', 'Machinist', 'easily', 'most', 'unsettling', 'disturbing', 'bizarre', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'mean', 'can', 'tell', 'reading', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'seeing', 'how', 'disturbingly', 'thin', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'pictures', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'mood', 'something', 'dark', 'uncompromising', 'got', 'then', 'cleverly', 'haunting', 'film', 'unforgettable.Bale', 'plays', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'troubled', 'fatigued', 'machinist', 'who', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'life', 'isolation', 'few', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'such', 'friendly', 'prostitute', 'who', 'liking', 'airport', 'coffee', 'shop', 'waitress', 'night', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'worst', 'when', 'fellow', 'machinist', 'first', 'time', 'nobody', 'knows', 'who', 'guy', 'tell', 'Trevor', ""n't"", 'exist', 'paranoia', 'confusion', 'horrific', 'accident', 'job', 'co-worker', 'when', 'strange', 'notes', 'apartment', 'Trevor', 'completely', 'delusional', 'lost', 'mind', 'somebody', 'really', 'out', 'get', 'him.What', 'really', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'just', 'Trevor', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'made', 'up', 'are', 'times', 'when', ""'re"", 'doubtful', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'then', 'get', 'roped', 'second-guess', 'ourselves', 'movie', 'non-stop', 'dread', 'fest', 'just', 'speaks', 'loneliness', 'paranoia', 'why', 'exactly', 'should', 'very', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'easy', 'realize', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'unsettling', 'dark', 'experience', 'one', 'may', 'want', 're-watch', 'see', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'think', 'while', 'said', 'done', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'hard', 'piece', 'together', 'was', 'over', 'made', 'sense', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'sense', 'second', 'viewing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fantastic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'dropped', 'down', '100', 'pounds', 'role', 'Yes', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'Bale', 'EXTREMELY', 'skinny', 'almost', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'was', 'intended', 'script', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed.This', ""n't"", 'movie', 'who', 'get', 'easily', 'disturbed', 'freaked', 'out', 'pretty', 'uneasy', 'movie', 'watch', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'extremely', 'cheerful', 'get', 'done', 'watching', 'may', 'want', 'put', 'something', 'funny', ""'re"", 'done', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'movie', 'stuck', 'head', 'try', 'sleep', 'DVD', 'little', 'offer', 'extra', 'features', 'department', 'such', 'commentary', 'director', 'making', 'feature', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'trailer.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Machinist', 'surprised', 'kept', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'kind', 'missed', 'watching', 'dark', 'movies', 'too', 'many', 'cutesy-wutesy', 'movies', 'family', 'good', 'see', 'something', 'so', 'brutal', 'raw', 'so', 'face', 'want', 'be', 'disturbed', 'see', 'something', ""n't"", 'typical', 'thriller', 'Machinist', 'something', 'put', 'down', 'list', 'movies', 'see', 'depressing', 'dreadful', 'movie', 'can', 'get', ""'m"", 'ready', 'see', 'again', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. He works in a machine shop and drives all the way to the airport for coffee and pie, served by a striking waitress named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), every night after work. Trevor's confidant and only friend is Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a prostitute whom he visits for conversation and sex. Trevor has become dangerously distracted by an unsettling new coworker named Ivan (John Sharian). But no one else believes that Ivan exists. Cryptic notes that Trevor doesn't remember writing keep turning up in his apartment. Is he going crazy? And why can't he sleep? Trevor's addled mind tries to cut through the haze of sleeplessness to figure out what it all means.""The Machinist"" is essentially a dark detective story in which Trevor is investigating his own psyche, trying to make sense of what he has become with only an unsure grasp on reality to guide him. It's an interesting premise, and Trevor is an interesting character. Christian Bale's appearance is shocking. The normally well-built actor lost 63 pounds to transform himself into a pale, skeletal creature. His very appearance is disturbing. Let us hope he didn't do himself cardiac damage to achieve it. Bale's performance is tremendous. With the help of director Brad Anderson's dark visuals, Bale creates an intense impression of decay and uncertainty. At a few points, the audience may be ahead of Trevor in comprehending his situation, but we generally don't know what is real and what is not any more than Trevor does. In these things ""The Machinist"" succeeds. Unfortunately, the film feels a bit like insomnia itself. It is plodding, monotonous, and simply fails to engage. That might be a suitable tone for the material, but I doubt audiences will appreciate having to fend off sleep themselves. Christian Bale's performance is one of the most interesting of 2004, so have a look if you enjoy thespian virtuosity.The DVD (Paramount 2005 disc): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, an audio commentary, 8 deleted or alternate scenes -2 with commentary, and a theatrical trailer. ""The Machinist: Breaking the Rules"" (25 minutes) features interviews with director Brad Anderson, the cast, screenwriter Scott Kosar, and the film's Spanish producers, as well as some footage of filming in Barcelona, Spain. In the audio commentary, director Brad Anderson talks about his vision for the film, characters, story, locations, and his decisions. This commentary is reasonably informative and without many lulls.

I agree with most of the reviewers here, Reznick is a distrubed, distraught man, slipping daily into his man made hell. But, I think there is another component here, how we enteralize guilt and other emotions. How do we accept our role in incidents, things we have caused, if on purpose, or by accident?  Several times in the movie, Reznick is confronted with making choices, paths that diverge in two seperate directions. I believe he is a kind and good hearted man, but he chose to run away from a situation  than to confront it.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","Christian Bale's jaw dropping performance in the Machinist is reason enough to see this film, which is undoubtadly one of the most haunting and unforgettable films to hit mainstream America in quite some time.  Bales' transformation from the buff, he-man-esque physique that those expect from seeing him in Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, or American Psycho, to the incredibly gaunt, emaciated Trevor Reznick is on par with the transformations that Robert De Niro went through in Raging Bull, and more recently Charlize Theron in Monster.  Reznick is a factory worker who hasn't slept in over a year, and feels a nagging sense of guilt.  His links to reality include a hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whom he frequents, and an airport waitress (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n); and his relationships with both take a nose dive soon after there is a crippling accident involving a co-worker (Michael Ironside) that Reznick is responsible for, and a mysterious man named Ivan (John Sharian) who is following Reznick around and can't be seen by anyone else but him.  As the Machinist unfolds and it's secrets are gradually revealed, it's clear that not all is going to end well for Reznick, and as he spirals towards his breaking point, it's one hell of a trip going down with him.  Director Brad Anderson gives the film a gray/blue-ish, almost metallic look, masterfully weaving the lonely world Reznick lives in with little to no human contact.  Bale is masterful in both his performance and getting into his character, and the man well deserves an Oscar nomination.

The closest thing he has to a girlfriend, a sympathetic hooker in the form of Jennifer Jason Leigh, says to him early on ""If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist,"" and it's true -- he's looks like a walking skeleton, every bone visible under a layer of skin, tightly stretched over his frame. Mentally, Reznik seems to be slowly losing it. He gets easily distracted at work, and an accident caused by his distraction costs a co-worker an arm. He begins to see things and people who don't seem to actually exist...or do they? Increasingly, as the story unfolds, we see that Trevor can't trust his own senses. Is this a by-product of the insomnia, or something deeper than that?Bale's performance is incredible, probably the best of his career. The fact that his bony frame isn't digital effects -- he really lost all that weight for the film -- is impressive enough, but Bale's portrayal of the perpetually exhausted, edgy, increasingly paranoid Reznik is even better. In every scene, even when Trevor is in good humor, you can see exhaustion in his eyes, the tattered edges of his conciousness showing through. He looks and acts like a man who hasn't slept in a long time. But it's not a one-dimenaional performance at all, as we see that Reznik can be a charming and friendly man, even underneath all the layers of sleeplessness. His emotional responses to different scenes are right on the money, and his growing confusion is clear throughout. It's a perfect performance and it drives the movie.The other essential aspect of the film is the mood it sets. The early visuals of Reznik's wasted body are enough to make even the most jaded viewer wince, and sets the movie on an off-kilter stance right from the start, which only gets worse as it continues. The lighting is stark and grainy, and the colors are washed-out, often either too bright or too dark than what you'd normally expect. Lots of little details add to the growing feeling of unease in the film, the overall sense that something is seriously wrong here...why is it always 1:30 when Trevor sees a certain waitress from an airport cafe, what do the six letters mean in the Hangman game that appears on a Post-It note in Trevor's apartment, why does he pay the rent early but forget the utilities, and was that just blood leaking out of the fridge?!There are several surprises waiting at the end of ""The Machinist,"" and to say much more would ruin it. Suffice it to say that this is a film which gets it all right. It tells a compelling story, it sets a definite mood, and it cements itself in the brain even when its over. For those willing to brave the deepest chambers of the human heart and see what waits there in the darkness, this is not a film you'll soon forget.",5,Sleepless in Hell,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,3300,"['What', 'would', 'happen', 'had', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'basic', 'premise', 'Machinist', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', ""n't"", 'slept', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'finding', 'having', 'pretty', 'deletirious', 'effects', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'reasons', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'so', 'strangely', 'are', 'brought', 'gradual', 'focus', 'story', 'progresses.Christian', 'Bale', 'plays', 'Trevor', 'Reznik', 'who', 'movie', 'been', 'suffering', 'insomnia', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'Physically', 'wasting', 'away', 'closest', 'thing', 'girlfriend', 'sympathetic', 'hooker', 'form', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'early', 'were', 'thinner', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'true', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'bone', 'visible', 'layer', 'skin', 'tightly', 'stretched', 'frame', 'Mentally', 'Reznik', 'be', 'slowly', 'losing', 'easily', 'distracted', 'work', 'accident', 'caused', 'distraction', 'co-worker', 'arm', 'see', 'things', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'actually', 'exist', 'do', 'Increasingly', 'story', 'unfolds', 'see', 'Trevor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'own', 'senses', 'by-product', 'insomnia', 'something', 'deeper', 'Bale', 'performance', 'incredible', 'probably', 'best', 'career', 'fact', 'bony', 'frame', ""n't"", 'digital', 'effects', 'really', 'lost', 'weight', 'film', 'impressive', 'enough', 'Bale', 'portrayal', 'perpetually', 'exhausted', 'edgy', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'Reznik', 'even', 'better', 'scene', 'even', 'when', 'Trevor', 'good', 'humor', 'can', 'see', 'exhaustion', 'eyes', 'tattered', 'edges', 'conciousness', 'showing', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'slept', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'one-dimenaional', 'performance', 'see', 'Reznik', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'friendly', 'man', 'even', 'layers', 'sleeplessness', 'emotional', 'responses', 'different', 'scenes', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'growing', 'confusion', 'clear', 'perfect', 'performance', 'movie.The', 'other', 'essential', 'aspect', 'film', 'mood', 'early', 'visuals', 'Reznik', 'wasted', 'body', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewer', 'wince', 'movie', 'off-kilter', 'stance', 'right', 'start', 'only', 'worse', 'lighting', 'stark', 'grainy', 'colors', 'are', 'washed-out', 'often', 'either', 'too', 'bright', 'too', 'dark', 'what', ""'d"", 'normally', 'expect', 'Lots', 'little', 'details', 'add', 'growing', 'feeling', 'unease', 'film', 'overall', 'sense', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'here', 'why', 'always', '1:30', 'when', 'Trevor', 'certain', 'waitress', 'airport', 'cafe', 'what', 'do', 'six', 'letters', 'mean', 'Hangman', 'game', 'Post-It', 'note', 'Trevor', 'apartment', 'why', 'pay', 'rent', 'early', 'forget', 'utilities', 'was', 'just', 'blood', 'leaking', 'fridge', 'are', 'several', 'surprises', 'waiting', 'end', 'Machinist', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'right', 'compelling', 'story', 'definite', 'mood', 'brain', 'even', 'when', 'over', 'willing', 'brave', 'deepest', 'chambers', 'human', 'heart', 'see', 'what', 'there', 'darkness', 'not', 'film', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A

894757,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007Y08QA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 6]","[note: approximately one hundred words cut from review due to Amazon length requirements.]The Machinist (Brad Anderson, 2004)I have never been as blown away, and as ultimately satisfied, by a film as fundamentally flawed as El Maquinista.Forget the one-hit thriller wonders. There are guys wandering around the planet who managed to direct one truly great thriller, and them immediately began a downhill slide. But they've traded on that one great thriller for a multi-hundred-million-dollar Hollywood career. (M. Night Shyamalan, please pick up the white courtesy phone.) In some cases, it's not even a downward spiral, it's a plunge off a cliff. (There's a Mr. Christopher Nolan calling for you.) It's gotten to the point where I see a truly great thriller from a director I have not previously encountered, I leave the theater both amazed at how wonderful a film I just saw and immediately thinking that the next film the guy directs is going to suck rocks.Ladies and gentlemen of the world, Brad Anderson is back with the next film. And it blows the competition away.Anderson, who was responsible for what may be the creepiest piece of atmospheric horror in the past decade-- Session 9-- met with such resounding apathy in Hollywood upon its release that he ended up packing his bags and heading off to Spain to make film #2, El Maquinista. It is a mark of Hollywood's continuing resounding apathy, and perennial stupidity, that the similarly Spanish-financed and American-acted Jaume Balaguero film Darkness, which was, to be blunt, a completely un-scary piece of dreck, was released on Christmas Day 2004 in America on thousands of screens, while El Maquinista toured the U. S. film festival circuit, then opened in painfully limited release (at its height, it played on a paltry seventy-two screens two weeks before Darkness opened on seventeen hundred) and slid back into the obscurity that, in the world of American mainstream film, is reserved only for truly great cinema. In this film, Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznik, who is, not surprisingly, a machinist. His co-workers have noticed a change in his personality. His landlady still seems to like him, but is somewhat nervous in his presence.  Trevor's life, we begin to realize, is really a tightrope, and the slightest nudge could send everything spiralling out of control. A new worker, Ivan (John Sharian, recently of Calendar Girls) starts at the plant, and Trevor gets nudged. The question we're left with is-- what is it that's caused everything to go so horribly wrong for Trevor?Before we get to the movie's many, many strengths, I'll get the one weakness out of the way. The first (roughly) thirty minutes or so of the movie are horribly paced, the work of a rank amateur rather than a guy who directed the pitch-perfect Session 9. If you find yourself getting bored by the setup, persevere. Fast-forward if need be, though you're likely to miss a few important details if you do. That's the unfortunate thing about the awful pacing in the first segment of the movie; there's way too much going on for you to just skip it. El Maquinista will put the viewer in mind of such movies as The Usual Suspects, Jacob's Ladder, or, of course, Session 9 in that the visual cues will be coming at you hard and fast, but you'll have no idea what they're about until you finally get to the big twist at the end, where that question above in answered. And, like the three movies mentioned in the last sentence, it's a devastating twist. The whole thing starts to fall into place, and the viewer is left either utterly confused (in which case, keep watching it over and over until you get it) or stunned at the audacity, and the brilliance, of Anderson's vision (one wonders whether it's also scriptwriter Scott Kosar's vision, as Kosar's other three released/in production movies are all remakes, so we've really no way of knowing). This is why I'm more than willing to forgive some crappy pacing, but really, I thought to myself more than once, ""this is from the guy who directed Session 9?""I stopped after things picked up, though (things pick up when Trevor and Ivan have their first meeting).Something like this can't be carried off without the actors. You don't have The Usual Suspects or Session 9 without those great ensembles. Here, the whole batch turn in excellent performances. Bale's has gotten a great deal of attention for his record-setting loss of sixty-three pounds for the role (if you pay attention to the Post-It notes in the movie, you'll note he probably lost a few more pounds during filming), which is all well and good, but it tends to overshadow the subtlety and excellence of various other members of the cast. Michael Ironside is his usual scenery-chewing ham-handed self, but Ironside has a deft eye for choosing his spots, and like most of the other places he appears, he makes his character work here. Jennifer Jason Leigh turned in a performance that should probably have been worth an Oscar nomination. The always-reliable Reg E. Cathey doesn't get much screen time, but what he has smolders. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (I'm Not Scared) is not a familiar name to American moviegoers, but is a heavy hitter in her native Spain, and it's entirely possible you'll be seeing a lot more of her over here in the near future.There is a great deal more to be said about how brilliant certain aspects of this movie are-- the cinematography, the sound mix, other technical details that enhance the atmosphere perfectly-- but I'm already at a thousand words (the magic Amazon limit), and thus I'll just say ""see this movie. If you get bored in the first half-hour, keep watching. 'Better' does not even begin to describe what this movie gets."" **** ",4,Marred only by bad pacing at the beginning.,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,5726,"['[', 'note', 'approximately', 'one',

894760,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0007Y08QA,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 2]","The screenplay for ""The Machinist"" called for a ""walking skeleton."" Christian Bale achieved the look all right.Thin? No. Anorexic would be the place to start.The weight loss in itself is a reason to watch the film, a meditation on the tricks a guilty mind can play. But ""The Machinist,"" directed by Brad Anderson, is also an effective little psychothriller, fueled by Bale's wry humor as Trevor Reznick, who works the second shift at a parts plant and has been steadily losing weight for months. He's down to 120 pounds. His kinda-girlfriend Stevie(Jennifer Jason Leigh) is an aging call girl. His friends talk about how he ""used to be all right."" He hasn't slept in a year.And now he's won a stalker named Ivan (John Sharian) a big, bald, creepy dude who distracts Trevor into causing a co-worker (Michael Ironside) to lose his arm in a plant accident. The men he used to fish and play poker with want him gone; his boss wants him fired. And somebody, maybe Ivan, is leaving Post-It Notes in Trevor's apartment with a hangman on it.The only respite comes in waitress Marie (Aitana Gijon-Sanchez) at the airport cafe who serves Trevor coffee and pie after his shift. Marie is warm and friendly. She has a son and, a bit inexplicably, a heart for Trevor, who spoils her with big tips. Her character holds a key to Trevor's past, which he only begins to understand when he joins Marie on Mother's Day, at the amusement park.Scott Kosar's script cleverly explains the root of Trevor's warped reality - a scene in Marie's apartment, looking back on the film, doesn't make much sense - but the mood of the film is effective whether the loose ends are all tied up or not.Bale's performance rachets up the insanity bit by bit, accompanied by the same black humor he employed in ""American Psycho."" Equally comic and macabre, Bale's very appearance is performance. At that weight, there's probably a cockeyed clarity about the world kicks in. What sustains you? What nurtures you? Severe anorexics talk of an emptiness more comforting that whatever could fill it. Trevor is at that point. He just wants to know why.Anderson goes for a drab, despairing look. Long nights, dark skies, empty fields, a cold ocean. He avoids theatrics; the film isn't a series of smash cuts, freeze frames and double exposures.

Bale is brilliant in his role as Trevor Reznik, an insomniac tormented by guilt and anxiety. Reznik has not slept nor eaten for days and everyone at his work detests him for no apparent reason. Bizarre things are frequently happening to Reznik and his behavior becomes increasingly erratic. Unable to explain why these strange things keep happening to him, Reznik grows increasingly desperate. Is everyone conspiring against him or is everything that is happening to him simply a fragment of his imagnination? Why has he lost his apettite and why has not he slept for days?All interesting questions but I am not giving away any answers. What I will tell you, however, is that this movie provides a momentous insight into such powerful emotions as anxiety, shame and guilt. This is a powerful story of a man who has found his own unique way to handle his guilt and anxiety. Another highly interesting yet controversial topic raised in this movie is that of the faulty memories. Will we ever be able to reach a consensus as to which memories are real and which are created? I doubt it. I believe that people have a propensity to ""create"" memories when reality becomes too difficult to cope with.Although skeptical at first, I was stunned by Bale's unprecedented performance for which he should have been awarded an Oscar.

894774,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B0007Y08QA,Suzanne,"[7, 8]","Making good psychological thrillers is hard. It seems too many are so contrived now days. Since Hitchcock there've only been a few contenders to the throne, perhaps David Lynch has come closest to succeeding him. But the Machinist was definitely a pleasant surprise and a film that can take its place as one of the best in recent memory.The film itself is very reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder, both in atmosphere and thematic elements. Both were about a man going on an inner quest to discover something important about himself and his past. Both are very disturbing films that puts the viewer in the place of the protagonist himself, allowing you to feel the same confusion and fear that they feel throughout the film.The same also carries through to the lead actors. Tim Robbins gave perhaps his best performance of his career in Jacob's Ladder and I can say with full confidence that Christian Bale gives an equally startling and awe inspiring performance here. Much has been said about his weight loss for the movie - some 60+ pounds, down to 120-100 to where he really looks like a walking skeleton. While his physical tranformation was nothing short of extraordinary, his acting peformance equals it. Giving a great performance as Trevor Reznick - the insomnia stricken machinist who begins having one strange, possibly delusional experience after another.The people in Trevor's life includes Stevie, a call girl, played beautifully and subtly by Jennifer Jason Leigh, a true friend and confidant to Trevor throughout the film. Marie, a waitress at a diner whom Trevor visits every night for coffee and conversation.  Ivan, a strange man with a deformed hand who has just shown up at Trevor's work. Nobody even seems to know he exists besides Trevor which leads to much of Trevor's fear and confusion throughout the film. And the people at the machinery where Trevor works including his boss, Tucker, and co-worker Miller.The atmosphere the film gives off is wonderful. Very reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder again. It's dark, grey, and haunting. There are moments where the viewer feels helpless as to what's happening to Trevor which adds to the eerie feeling. It's not an easy film to watch all of the time. As with Jacob's Ladder, there are those memorable scenes that stay with you long after it's over. Jacob's Ladder had the hospital scene, The Machinist has the carnival ride. Both work wonderfully within each film.The thematic elements was nearly identical to Jacob's Ladder but The Machinist approached it in a completely different way (which was smart). It's hard to discuss without giving too much away, but it's safe to say that the main theme is the cause of all Trevor's problems including his insomnia and weight loss. Trevor basically goes through hell and back before he comes face to face with his (metaphorical) demons and confronts what's been causing his suffering.When all is said and done The Machinist was a very good but not perfect film. With all the simularities to Jacob's Ladder it wasn't entirely original. The music was also a downside. It sounds like it was ripped off an old B-movie and it really detracts from the tense scenes. There's also not nearly as much depth to The Machinist as there was in other films like Jacob's Ladder or Mulholland Drive (which has seemingly endless depth and complexity) that warrant and reward many repeat viewings.Not to say The Machinist doesn't have some depth, but there isn't enough in the film to watch it over and over. There are a few reoccuring ideas though - notice the liscense plate on Trevor's truck when he exits the tunnel after chasing Ivan and the left/right path motif from the carnival ride and near the end of the movie.Also, the many Fight Club references made in the reviews here about this movie are highly unwarranted. These were two VERY different films other than the unsuspected endings. The themes and atmosphere were entirely different as well. If you want to find out where a large portion of this film's inspiration came from, go watch Jacob's Ladder, NOT Fight Club.If you love psychological thrillers, The Machinist is certainly worth a rent. It's also worth seeing just for Bale's performance. It's dark and certainly not a happy movie, but sometimes that's what you're in the mood for.",4,The Best Psychological Thriller in Recent Years...,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,4288,"['Making', 'good', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'hard', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'so', 'contrived', 'now', 'days', 'Hitchcock', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'few', 'contenders', 'throne', 'perhaps', 'David', 'Lynch', 'come', 'closest', 'succeeding', 'Machinist', 'was', 'definitely', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'best', 'recent', 'memory.The', 'film', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'atmosphere', 'thematic', 'elements', 'were', 'man', 'going', 'inner', 'quest', 'discover', 'something', 'important', 'past', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'films', 'viewer', 'place', 'protagonist', 'allowing', 'feel', 'same', 'confusion', 'fear', 'feel', 'film.The', 'same', 'also', 'lead', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'gave', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'can', 'say', 'full', 'confidence', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'equally', 'startling', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'performance', 'here', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'weight', 'loss', 'movie', '60+', 'pounds', 'down', '120-100', 'where', 'really', 'walking', 'skeleton', 'physical', 'tranformation', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'peformance', 'equals', 'Giving', 'great', 'performance', 'Trevor', 'Reznick', 'insomnia', 'stricken', 'machinist', 'who', 'having', 'one', 'strange', 'possibly', 'delusional', 'experience', 'another.The', 'people', 'Trevor', 'life', 'Stevie', 'call', 'girl', 'played', 'beautifully', 'subtly', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'true', 'friend', 'confidant', 'Trevor', 'film', 'Marie', 'waitress', 'diner', 'whom', 'Trevor', 'night', 'coffee', 'conversation', 'Ivan', 'strange', 'man', 'deformed', 'hand', 'who', 'just', 'shown', 'up', 'Trevor', 'work', 'Nobody', 'even', 'know', 'Trevor', 'much', 'Trevor', 'fear', 'confusion', 'film', 'people', 'machinery', 'where', 'Trevor', 'including', 'boss', 'Tucker', 'co-worker', 'Miller.The', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'off', 'wonderful', 'Very', 'reminiscent', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'again', 'dark', 'grey', 'haunting', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'viewer', 'helpless', 'what', 'happening', 'Trevor', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'time', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'are', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'stay', 'long', 'over', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'had', 'hospital', 'scene', 'Machinist', 'carnival', 'ride', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'film.The', 'thematic', 'elements', 'was', 'nearly', 'identical', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'Machinist', 'approached', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'smart', 'hard', 'discuss', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'safe', 'say', 'main', 'theme', 'cause', 'Trevor', 'problems', 'including', 'insomnia', 'weight', 'loss', 'Trevor', 'basically', 'hell', 'back', 'face', 'face', 'metaphorical', 'demons', 'confronts', 'what', 'been', 'causing', 'suffering.When', 'said', 'done', 'Machinist', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'simularities', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'downside', 'was', 'ripped', 'off', 'old', 'B-movie', 'really', 'tense', 'scenes', 'also', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'Machinist', 'was', 'other', 'films', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'depth', 'complexity', 'warrant', 'reward', 'many', 'repeat', 'viewings.Not', 'say', 'Machinist', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', ""n't"", 'enough', 'film', 'watch', 'over', 'are', 'few', 'reoccuring', 'ideas', 'notice', 'liscense', 'plate', 'Trevor', 'truck', 'when', 'tunnel', 'chasing', 'Ivan', 'left/right', 'path', 'motif', 'carnival', 'ride', 'end', 'movie.Also', 'many', 'Fight', 'Club', 'references', 'made', 'reviews', 'here', 'movie', 'are', 'highly', 'unwarranted', 'were', 'two', 'VERY', 'different', 'films', 'other', 'unsuspected', 'endings', 'themes', 'atmosphere', 'were', 'entirely', 'different', 'as', 'well', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'inspiration', 'came', 'go', 'watch', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'NOT', 'Fight', 'Club.If', 'love', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'Machinist', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rent', 'also', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'Bale', 'performance', 'dark', 'certainly', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'what', ""'re"", 'mood']",N/A

894778,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007Y08QA,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 3]","You know something isn't right when the first scene of the movie is Christian Bale's Trevor Reznik (a name that constantly has me thinking of NIN) is rolling up someone in a rug before taking the rug to the ocean and dumps it.  Trevor, looking feverish, beat up, and deathly thin gives a striking image and makes us wonder, what is going on?Normally, it annoys me when people credit actors with gaining weight (Bridget Jones' Diary), using prosthetics (Nicole Kidman) or losing weight (Christian Bale in this movie).  It annoys me not that the actors are doing it but that the simple act of doing it should give them credance that they are Great Actors.  I think diminishing their acting skills to a prosthetic or weight loss/gain as the reason for applause is as phony as the prosthetic.  So of course here we knew that Christian Bale lost 63 pounds to play the gaunt character.  And while it adds a lot to his role, and is quite a thing to do, it's his acting as the lost Trevor that makes this movie the excellent noir it is.Director Brad Anderson imbues his dark movie with shades of grays and blues.  The majority of the movie is filmed in an almost black and white color scheme.  Everything is washed out, just like Trevor's life.  Trevor has been suffering from insomnia and hasn't slept in a year.  He keeps track of his weight loss as well.  The only comforts in his life are two women, one a prostitute and the other a waitress at an airport cafe.  These two women basically provide the only company Trevor gets in his life.  To compound this situation even more, a man named Ivan shows up, bringing with him a lot of trouble.  Which leads to the question of why?  Why is all of this happening?  This question is central to the whole movie.In fact, what makes this movie work really well is that it's a puzzle.  It gives the viewers a situation and a problem, and then takes us on a crazy ride through one man's life.  Little pieces of the puzzle become clear to those paying attention, and by the end of the movie every little thing you've seen or thought you saw makes sense.  Mostly, it's a very clever movie.  There are a few puzzle pieces that are too blatantly obvious.  In fact, I will bet that a good majority of the people watching this movie will catch the first ""twist.""  Right from the beginning it is hinted at, and not all that subtly.  But by the end where the central question to the movie is answered, I was taken by surprise.  By that time I was so invested into the story that it just surprised me but made so much sense.And that is the highest praise I can give this movie: it makes sense.  It's mysterious and involves ""twists"" but the twists make perfect sense.  By the end of the movie, you can see why the entire film took place.  It's realistic in that aspect.  I very highly recommend this movie.  It's interesting and can be suspenseful.  It moves slowly, but it's a slow build that continually rachets up the tension and suspense.  Very well done.

Now, after re-watching it recently, I found out that this film isn't that hard follow, and above all, it is very good. Like everyone else who has viewed the film, I was shocked by the looks of Christian Bale. Ha, everyone thinks that Tom Hanks did a great job of losing weight for the role he played in ""Castaway"", well Bale's weight loss blows that right out of the water! As far as the story, it is very well written, and it keeps you guessing what exactly is going to become of his man who claims he ""hadn't slept in a year""..Yes,that's physically impossible, but the character that Bale plays really believes this (watch the Director's commentary during that scene, and you'll know what I'm talking about)Anyway, I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone that might not have watched it, so all I'm going to say that the movie is about a man that suffers from extreme insomnia  that cause him to have feelings of confusion, paranoia, guilt, and anxiety to the point that he doesn't know what's real and what's not. This film does have a sorta ""Hitchcock"" feel to it, combined with something out an old Twilight Zone episode. It's a very dark and slow paced film, and the performance by Christian Bale is riveting. And what many people might not know is that the film was filmed entirely in Barcelona, Spain, and a lot of the exteriors had to be changed to make it look like it was filmed in America.

But when cryptic notes turn up in his apartment and he has visions of a co-worker nobody else can see, is it reality or the next level of his sleeplessness that's to blame? good cinematic thriller with strong writing. The incredible directing drew the best of performances out of the actors. A+ work all around. Bale proved his dedication to his role and also did a stellar performance. Leigh was mesmerizing. Ironside did great work in a supporting role. The story kept me in suspense to the end.

THE MACHINIST lifts from all the right styles, borrows from all the right moods, takes its musical cues from all the right films, and the performances hit all the right notes - while visually it slides into homeplate with plenty of time before the ball hits the glove.  It's not MEMENTO - but I kept half expecting Carrie Ann-Moss to show up.  It's not THE SIXTH SENSE or THE OTHERS or THE RING or anything else really - but it does fit in with the style of each film.  We open in the present and are presented with a mystery that we then work towards backwards... not too far back, but far enough back to set the stage, have all the right clues layered into the narrative and then stumble and fall towards the final payoff which you see coming long before the end.  While not a bad thing, the final payoff is not explosive but simple. Clean. Direct.  And where the plot may fail to ignite debate, visually it helps to sell the point home.Guilt can consume souls as well as flesh - and Bale (BATMAN BEGINS) literally takes us there.  He's the hardest thing to watch in this film, and yet you can't take your eyes off him.  He's too thin.  To brittle.  To close to the edge - his eyes sunken - shadows break out like sores all over his face.  He's almost literally turning himself inside out over what he refuses to remember, but can't forget.  But not even his performance and dedication to the part can really pull the film up from just being a modest, often mild, mystery.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives her best as well - but she barely makes a dent in the story.  She's not in it enough for her to warrent her actually being there, so I'm not sure why she was.Director Brad Anderson provides running commentary, and while good, doesn't stray too far from the text or the message of the film.  There are intresting asides to what was cut from the original script, and what was changed durning production.  His woes of location shooting are insightful and sometimes funny (listen for and look for two real junkies shooting up in one of the shots that made it into the film).But in the end the film is mostly icing and no cake.  Bale gets top honors for selling it - and the visuals create the world around him, but the story is as thin as Bale.",3,YOU DRIVE,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,2341,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'before.Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'already', 'head', 'MACHINIST', 'lifts', 'right', 'styles', 'borrows', 'right', 'moods', 'musical', 'cues', 'right', 'films', 'performances', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'visually', 'homeplate', 'plenty', 'time', 'ball', 'glove', 'not', 'MEMENTO', 'kept', 'half', 'expecting', 'Carrie', 'Ann-Moss', 'show', 'up', 'not', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'THE', 'RING', 'anything', 'else', 'really', 'fit', 'style', 'film', 'open', 'present', 'are', 'presented', 'mystery', 'then', 'work', 'towards', 'backwards', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'back', 'far', 'enough', 'back', 'set', 'stage', 'have', 'right', 'clues', 'layered', 'narrative', 'then', 'stumble', 'fall', 'towards', 'final', 'payoff', 'see', 'coming', 'long', 'end', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'final', 'payoff', 'not', 'explosive', 'simple', 'Clean', 'Direct', 'where', 'plot', 'may', 'fail', 'ignite', 'debate', 'visually', 'sell', 'point', 'home.Guilt', 'can', 'consume', 'souls', 'as', 'well', 'flesh', 'Bale', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'literally', 'there', 'hardest', 'thing', 'watch', 'film', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'too', 'thin', 'brittle', 'close', 'edge', 'eyes', 'sunken', 'shadows', 'break', 'out', 'sores', 'face', 'almost', 'literally', 'turning', 'what', 'remember', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'not', 'even', 'performance', 'dedication', 'part', 'can', 'really', 'pull', 'film', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'modest', 'often', 'mild', 'mystery', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'best', 'as', 'well', 'barely', 'dent', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'warrent', 'actually', 'being', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was.Director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'running', 'commentary', 'good', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'text', 'message', 'film', 'are', 'intresting', 'asides', 'what', 'was', 'cut', 'original', 'script', 'what', 'was', 'changed', 'durning', 'production', 'woes', 'location', 'shooting', 'are', 'insightful', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'listen', 'look', 'two', 'real', 'junkies', 'shooting', 'up', 'one', 'shots', 'made', 'film', '.But', 'end', 'film', 'mostly', 'icing', 'cake', 'Bale', 'top', 'honors', 'selling', 'visuals', 'create', 'world', 'story', 'as', 'thin', 'Bale']",N/A

He works at a factory, on a machine, making parts for other parts. During the night, he fills his hours with the attentions of Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a prostitute, and Marie (Aitana Sanchez Gijon), the Graveyard shift waitress at a local caf&eacute;. One day, a co-worked has an accident, which may have been caused by Trevor. Feelings of guilt join his paranoia and send him into a tailspin.""The Machinist"" was made long before ""Batman Begins"" and the most striking thing about the film is what Bale did to his body to become Trevor. He lost 70 pounds, causing his body to become emaciated, bones showing through pallid skin. The physical transformation is amazing and painful to watch.Looking past the physical, Bale has once again created a believable, interesting, three dimensional character. Trevor moves through his life as if walking through a thick fog, a condition of his exhaustion. Many times, he is about to fall asleep when some sound, some disturbance jolts him awake. He also begins to imagine things, adding to his paranoia. Bale keeps the performance very low key adding elements of realism to the character. It would be completely unbelievable to watch a character who is physically exhausted start screaming and jumping around hysterically at any point. His pain and guilt, after his co-worker's accident, are also very low key, until he begins to suspect that someone may be plotting something against him. As the paranoia begins to take hold, his performance becomes a little more manic, but Bale still keeps it low key.Directed by Brad Anderson (""Session 9"", ""Happy Accidents""), the film's cinematography is almost monochromatic. Virtually all color has been drained from the screen. Some scenes have a touch of green or a touch of red, but everything is predominantly black, white and gray. Imagine if you haven't slept for a year. How screwed up would everything appear in your eyes? As we are watching the film through Trevor's POV, it is necessary for us to see his world as he views it. Anderson accomplishes this beautifully through this cinematic style.As the story progresses, we begin to sense that something may be underlying Trevor's paranoia. The film is a mystery of sorts, as Trevor works to uncover what this is. This element of is interesting and well-done, worked throughout to seem believable.""The Machinist"" is an interesting, involving, well-made film starring one of the better actors working in film today.

But the things that make this film memorable, isn't the plot or the general synopsis of the film. Remarkably , it's the dedicated acting and the excellent directing. Jennifer Jason Leigh ,Aitana Sanchez Gijon, Michael Ironside ,and John Sherian provide  the perfect supporting cast. However the dedication of Christian Bale , to his character (Trevor Reznik) , transports this simple film , to cult classic status. As with the other reviews , I'll reintereate that Bale's performance was outstanding , by simply underplaying his character. His brilliant performance is also highlighted by his appearance. I've seen alot of movies. However , I've never seen any actor go through such a physical transformation. It took atleast 30 min. to get over the fact that Bale lost so much weight for this film. After that initial distraction , the film took on unexpected hieghts and emotional depths , that I'm sure I'll remember for years. This is a definate film , for Bale fans , to watch.

The film is actually a Spanish/American product, and this fact reminds me of other thrillers like 'The Others.'  And like any other Spanish thriller (which are getting more deserved attentions from all over the world), 'The Machinist' is not so much about the plot itself as the spooky atmosphere.[THIN MAN] BIGGEST SHOCK comes from Christian Bale, who lost more than 60 pounds for the role of the machinist Trevor, who has not slept a moment for a year.  Look at his gaunt face, and the upper part of his breast, where you can see the bones under his skin.  Usually, 'method' actors put weight to be in character; his method is tatally the other way around.Anyway, Trevor cannot sleep, and starts to think that he is haunted by someone, or something, that might be related to his past.  Strange memos arrive, with a weird 'hangman game' on them.  Rude and somewhat creepy 'Ivan' (John Sharian, 'Love Actually') shows up before Trevor, and his guy may or may not hold the key to Trevor's mystery.  Or sympathetic prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) could be the one, or someone else?  The only solace he can get is the worker at airport, compassionate Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), but she also seems to be involved in the entire nightmare in the way he can never dream of.  As he tries to find the answer, Trevor is driven to the edge of madnessAs in such thrillers as 'Open Your Eyes' and 'The Others,' the logics of 'The Machinist' themselves cannot hold together if they are looked at with scrunity.  The plot of this film is after all more about the mental states of the tormented hero, than about the solution of the mystery, but most things fit in the right places when the film ends.  Why can't Trevor sleep for 365 days?  It's not just insomnia, and when you know the answer, you understand the meaning hidden in this unusual condition.The photography (by Xavi Ginemez, equally creepy 'Intacto') captures the protagonist's gradual psychological changes, or Trevor's downward trip towards hell, and the images themselves are often spooky with the metalic gray of the subtle lighting in the factory. But it is Bale's unbelievably thin body that renders to the film considerable amount of very ominous atomosphere -- in short, you instantly see something is wrong with the world of Trevor, and definitely with Trevor himself.I don't say the film is perfect.  One horrible incident happens to one guy Miller, co-worker of Trevor (played by Michael Ironside), but it looks irrelevant to the whole mystery.  The answer (the true answer) to the mysterious 'game' is in fact nothing hard to detect -- I found it out before Trevor, and you will, too.

In his commentary, director Brad Anderson calls it ""cool and creepy . . . a parable about guilt,"" and no one who sees ""The Machinist"" will argue with that. It holds your interest without engaging your mind or emotions because nothing in it makes sense until the end when some (not all) of the mystery is resolved. But by then it's too late. We already have concluded that Anderson could have found a less convoluted and just as interesting way of telling a story that is not really that strange.Christian Bale, an intelligent young actor whose choice of roles is unusually varied, lost 63 pounds to play a machinist who causes an industrial accident and ends up consumed with insomnia, guilt, paranoia and, finally, maybe as puzzled as the audience. For this is one of those movies in which characters, locations, even entire scenes, are figments of the imagination. You may or may not realize this afterwards, chatting over coffee with friends, but certainly not while watching the movie.The Los Angeles locations are rather captivating until you realize that the entire film was shot in Barcelona and Andorra using Spanish and English actors to support Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh, playing (another!) gold-hearted hooker who helps him. As the only American on the Spanish crew, Anderson says it fell to him to ""Americanize"" everything; any anachronisms you spot (there are a few) he hopes you will excuse as the ""surrealism"" he says is inherent in the script, a sort of poor man's ""Memento,"" and his approach to it.Bale, always a brave actor, is the real reason to watch ""The Machinist""; his skeletal body is unnerving to see, and his relentlessness carries the narrative. But skip Anderson's self-serving commentary. He likens his film to those of Alfred Hitchcock, even uses an ersatz Bernard Hermann score. He fills it with symbols (the Pieta is invoked) and incident that his commentary has to explain, and tells us what a terrific movie he has made. Don't worry.

I'd seen previews before that seemed quite interesting, but I was sort of wondering why I'd not heard of this when it came out. It looked creepy, but in a good way. But on the other hand previews can be deceiving, especially when they get all the good stuff into that sixty seconds. But this is stellar.Scene by scene, minute by minute this is engaging, eerie, troubling filmmaking. You're never sure what's going to happen next, and for me, at least, I was kept on the edge the whole time.I worried that the ending wouldn't be satisfying, or that it would just descend into cheap horror. It doesn't, though. The ending is solid. It makes sense out of most of what came before and wraps it all up in a way that's ultimately revealing, reasonable and almost uplifting.

Mainly because i had never really seen him in a lot until the whole Batman Begins deal. I really enjoyed him in that and a few other films, but this just for one, doesnt seem like him, and two, doesnt feel like a movie he should or would play in. Losing an alarming 63lbs for a role in a film is just plain crazy, and for a long time you really forget who you are watching, sometimes he looks more like an mal-nutrition(ed) Ethan Hawke than himself. So i really just couldnt get into it, that being one of the reasons. It just didn't feel right. Also the story is very mixed up, and doesnt mesh together well. First off he never really says why he hasn't slept in a year, or the cause of his weight loss, only towards the end of the film do you (sort of) get a taste of a possible reason. A lot of the set up scenarios, notes, accidents, hallucinations of a man not there, and several other details really leave you wondering through most of the film, scratching your head saying ok, what in the world is going on? I love good twist's and also movies that go in a weird direction, but this film just veers off from side to side to much and has no real consistency.As much as i wanted to like the film i got about an hour or so into and just started to become uninterested, and at some points down right bored. As i scanned through the last half hour or so, i just wanted to see what this all added up to. Well i was seriously disappointed that it really just didn't come together for me, like a lot of lose ends throughout. Christian Bale is a fine actor, and he really did a good job for what this movie was(is). I just prefer him in other films, not so, well(twisted) would be a good word. So if you watch the film, i guess you had to be more objective than myself, i for one really like these kinds of movies, but this one was an exception. Mainly because of a really convoluted plot, and mixed pot storyline. So sorry i have to give this such a low rating, i had high hopes, sad to say the movie is as thin as the character himself.",2,"Clever concept, poor excecution.",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2152,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'browsing', 'IMDB', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'what', 'movies', 'starred', 'Mainly', 'i', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'lot', 'whole', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'deal', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'one', 'seem', 'two', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'would', 'play', 'Losing', 'alarming', '63lbs', 'role', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'forget', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'sometimes', 'more', 'mal-nutrition', 'ed', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'So', 'i', 'really', 'just', 'couldnt', 'get', 'being', 'one', 'reasons', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'Also', 'story', 'very', 'mixed', 'up', 'doesnt', 'mesh', 'together', 'well', 'First', 'never', 'really', 'why', ""n't"", 'slept', 'year', 'cause', 'weight', 'loss', 'only', 'end', 'film', 'do', 'sort', 'get', 'taste', 'possible', 'reason', 'lot', 'set', 'up', 'scenarios', 'notes', 'accidents', 'hallucinations', 'man', 'not', 'there', 'several', 'other', 'details', 'really', 'leave', 'wondering', 'most', 'film', 'scratching', 'head', 'saying', 'ok', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'love', 'good', 'twist', 'also', 'movies', 'go', 'weird', 'direction', 'film', 'just', 'veers', 'off', 'side', 'side', 'much', 'real', 'consistency.As', 'much', 'i', 'wanted', 'film', 'i', 'got', 'hour', 'so', 'just', 'started', 'become', 'uninterested', 'points', 'down', 'right', 'bored', 'i', 'scanned', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'i', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'added', 'up', 'Well', 'i', 'was', 'seriously', 'disappointed', 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'lot', 'lose', 'ends', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fine', 'actor', 'really', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'prefer', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'twisted', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'word', 'So', 'watch', 'film', 'i', 'guess', 'had', 'be', 'more', 'objective', 'i', 'one', 'really', 'kinds', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'exception', 'Mainly', 'really', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'mixed', 'pot', 'storyline', 'sorry', 'i', 'have', 'give', 'low', 'rating', 'i', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'sad', 'say', 'movie', 'as', 'thin', 'character']",N/A

The lead character has no idea what's reality and nightmare. It's a pretty original story and certainly not commercially entertaining like most mainstream films. It's a film that requires a lot of attention and thinking in order to follow through. Ultimately, the most disturbing thing in this movie is the body of Christian Bale who had lost 63lbs for the role that made it more convincing along with his very best performance.So Christian Bale plays a machine engineer who hasn't slept for a year, because something traumatic happened that caused him to be insomniac. His hooker/girlfriend(Jennifer Jason Leigh) tells him that he wouldn't exist if he were any thinner. He started seeing things and a guy supposedly unseen by others. He unintentionally caused the machine to malfunction and his co-worker lost his arm. He thinks some psycho is out there with a plot to mess with his life and mind, and trying to figure out how to stop him. Nobody believes his story, and thought he was insane.It took him a lot of running around and losing his job before he figured out that he was hallucinating and eventually remember reality.Again, I didn't find this film to be entertaining, because it was a psychological journey. It was captivating because Christian Bale was incredibly convincing. I think he literally disappeared into this movie.

That is exactly the conundrum portrayed in ""The Machinist"".For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale), a machine worker who is having trouble sleeping.  As the movie unfolds, the mystery of his insomnia is slowly revealed, with the overall outcome (complete craziness or vast conspiracy) in doubt all the way up to the final scene.If you like movies that have a ""big reveal"" in the end, then this should volt up near the top of your ""must see"" list.  The action may not be all that apparent in the middle portions of the film, but it is the process of the ""slow reveal"" that will keep you interested in seeing how it all turns out.Along the way, the acting will also keep you emotionally tuned in.  While Bale may be a bit one-dimensional (at least so far) in terms of choosing his roles, but what he does (the intense, brooding type) always turns out excellent.  Without his stunning performance physically, emotionally, and psychologically, this film would be little more than a ""hook flick"" (where the hook of the plot is the only thing that ends up mattering).  Instead, you'll actually care about the fate of Reznick when all is said and done.Thus, I could easily give ""The Machinist"" a 4.5 rating, but opt for 4 in this format due to the fact that it really isn't an ""instant classic"".
