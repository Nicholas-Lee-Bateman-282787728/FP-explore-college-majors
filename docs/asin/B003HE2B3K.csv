The DVD showcases concerts from a half-dozen different cities and runs 99 minutes.  There is some brief commentary mixed in, and still photo shots from time to time too.The first few songs are very upbeat and rousing, such as Live These Songs, Summertime, and Beer in Mexico. There's more than a couple `beer drinking' songs featured too.  The middle of the presentation has some more serious songs such as There Goes My Life and Old Blue Chair. But the `fun/party' theme soon returns with Living In Fast Forward and later She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy.  The DVD wraps up with a tearful performance of Better As A Memory.The DVD showcases Chesney's Country/Rock spectacle with many great shots of the crowds, his band, and of course Chesney himself.  As usual he's dressed pretty casual in well-worn jeans, a sleeveless shirt, cowboy hat, and boots.  His band gets some well-deserved attention in some numbers too.

Also, you can see depth in Kenny being at one part of the stage and other musicians being behind him.

The glamorous sounds, lights, and humongous size of the stadiums did not minimized my distraction with the lousy jeans and cheap sleeveless shirts in addition to the primitive and ungraceful body motions.  Even though Country Music by definition deals with mundane daily feelings, here, Kenny relied solely on his special voice to present fragmented and many boring songs.  If the same songs were sung by, say, Michael Jackson, a totally different outcome would be characterized by Jackson's well calculated body motions, on every angle and every contour of his body.  To the contrast, Kenny Chasney's only assets are his Cowboy hat's contours and his kyphotic spine, from the neck to his feet.  With slim and shaky limbs, Kenny's voice is no match to Jackson's 110 lb bodyweight energized by highly sophisticated esthetics.  Jackson's obsession with his dress and appearance elevated his art above the ordinary, compared to Kenny's cheap clothes and condescending appearance.Even though the main singer introduced another two male sounds, it appeared very condescending since one of the two had to wait for double signaling to kick into singing and the other was totally unfit to sing.  The rest of the band of Kenny Chesney are no different from him is terms of relying on narrow musical skill out of the context of the whole show aesthetics.  Leaving the main singer to run lengthy and demanding concert did disservice to the band.  The fear of other talented partners, to step forward and show their best, restricted the main singer within his own limited skills of special voice that lacks structured contents or calculated body motions.Scanning through the spectators, thousands of whom stood on their feet in crowded stadium, I could not conclude any good reason to be there other than yearning for excitement. Whether they got what they paid for and expected is hard to tell.  For me, a band of all white boys from Tennessee, with no single female participant, with improvised and random songs, casual and improper attire, and body contours and motions that are totally deformed, did not cut muster.What entirely lacking was the artistic maestro who could match all pieces together other than the main singer who seemed to do-it-all sort of manager.  The end of the movie was filled with unnecessary tears and red eyes that made no meaning to a crowd interested in music. Kenny made it clear that his Summer concert are about music, church, girls, beer, and sport since the world was full of troubles, his songs mean a lot to a lot of people. But, Kenny shot himself in the foot by cutting classes of art and history that should have taught him how Michael Jackson avoided the pitfalls of having poorly organized concert or appearing condescending to the millions who paid to enjoy his art. A lesson in body aesthetics and some decent dress would go the long way.",3,"If you like singing about a blue plastic chair with hundreds of mosquitos bites, you would enjoy the Tennessee's Country music.",1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,2968,"['Kenny', 'Chasney', '3D', 'Summer', 'Concert', 'must', 'admit', 'own', 'prejudice', 'towards', 'improvised', 'country', 'music', 'glamorous', 'sounds', 'lights', 'humongous', 'size', 'stadiums', 'did', 'not', 'minimized', 'distraction', 'lousy', 'jeans', 'cheap', 'sleeveless', 'shirts', 'addition', 'primitive', 'ungraceful', 'body', 'motions', 'Even', 'Country', 'Music', 'definition', 'deals', 'mundane', 'daily', 'feelings', 'here', 'Kenny', 'relied', 'solely', 'special', 'voice', 'present', 'fragmented', 'many', 'boring', 'songs', 'same', 'songs', 'were', 'sung', 'say', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'totally', 'different', 'outcome', 'would', 'be', 'characterized', 'Jackson', 'well', 'calculated', 'body', 'motions', 'angle', 'contour', 'body', 'contrast', 'Kenny', 'Chasney', 'only', 'assets', 'are', 'Cowboy', 'hat', 'contours', 'kyphotic', 'spine', 'neck', 'feet', 'slim', 'shaky', 'limbs', 'Kenny', 'voice', 'match', 'Jackson', '110', 'lb', 'bodyweight', 'energized', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'esthetics', 'Jackson', 'obsession', 'dress', 'appearance', 'elevated', 'art', 'ordinary', 'compared', 'Kenny', 'cheap', 'clothes', 'condescending', 'appearance.Even', 'main', 'singer', 'introduced', 'two', 'male', 'sounds', 'appeared', 'very', 'condescending', 'one', 'two', 'had', 'wait', 'double', 'signaling', 'kick', 'singing', 'other', 'was', 'totally', 'unfit', 'sing', 'rest', 'band', 'Kenny', 'Chesney', 'are', 'different', 'terms', 'relying', 'narrow', 'musical', 'skill', 'context', 'whole', 'show', 'aesthetics', 'Leaving', 'main', 'singer', 'run', 'lengthy', 'demanding', 'concert', 'did', 'disservice', 'band', 'fear', 'other', 'talented', 'partners', 'step', 'forward', 'show', 'best', 'restricted', 'main', 'singer', 'own', 'limited', 'skills', 'special', 'voice', 'structured', 'contents', 'calculated', 'body', 'motions.Scanning', 'spectators', 'thousands', 'whom', 'stood', 'feet', 'crowded', 'stadium', 'could', 'not', 'conclude', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'there', 'other', 'yearning', 'excitement', 'got', 'what', 'paid', 'expected', 'hard', 'tell', 'band', 'white', 'boys', 'Tennessee', 'single', 'female', 'participant', 'improvised', 'random', 'songs', 'casual', 'improper', 'attire', 'body', 'contours', 'motions', 'are', 'totally', 'deformed', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'muster.What', 'entirely', 'lacking', 'was', 'artistic', 'maestro', 'who', 'could', 'match', 'pieces', 'together', 'other', 'main', 'singer', 'who', 'seemed', 'do-it-all', 'sort', 'manager', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'filled', 'unnecessary', 'tears', 'red', 'eyes', 'made', 'meaning', 'crowd', 'interested', 'music', 'Kenny', 'made', 'clear', 'Summer', 'concert', 'are', 'music', 'church', 'girls', 'beer', 'sport', 'world', 'was', 'full', 'troubles', 'songs', 'mean', 'lot', 'lot', 'people', 'Kenny', 'shot', 'foot', 'cutting', 'classes', 'art', 'history', 'should', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'avoided', 'pitfalls', 'having', 'poorly', 'organized', 'concert', 'appearing', 'condescending', 'millions', 'who', 'paid', 'enjoy', 'art', 'lesson', 'body', 'aesthetics', 'decent', 'dress', 'would', 'go', 'long', 'way']",N/A

Even worse than the new Blu-ray 3D release of Tron.The 2D viewing of this disk was great and the sound was fantastic. However, I didn't purchase the Blu-ray 3D version to watch a regular DVD version.At first I thought the problem could be with my main Blu-ray 3D player and 3D HDTV. So I played it in 3D mode on my other 3D set-up, same problem. Went to my neighbor who just bought a new high-end Panasonic set-up and was welcomed with the same unwatchable 3D effect.I have contacted IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT BUT HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM.I pre-ordered this a very long time ago when it was first listed on Amazon for pre-order. Was then notified late last year that the release of the Blu-ray 3D was being pushed out with no new release date. Finally made available this past March.There has been a lot of confusion regarding this Kenny Chesney 2D DVD and Blu-ray 3D release. I don't fault Amazon for this confusion because the supplier of the product, in this case IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT, supplies the script and marketing data to the sales outlets. Usually the sales outlet, in this case Amazon, prints and displays whatever the supplier of the product gives them to market the product.For some reason IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT hid the Blu-ray 3D logo on the bottom back of the case. When viewing the front of the case it only had printed, 3D & 2D ON ONE DISK, NO Blu-ray 3D logo. This led to the question. ""what 3D format is this Blu-ray disk""?
