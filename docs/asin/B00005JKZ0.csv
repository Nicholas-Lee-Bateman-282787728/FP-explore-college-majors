592827,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKZ0,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","I turned Adam Sandler's remake of ""The Longest Yard"" off after twenty minutes, vowing only to watch it again when the world's collided.  I have never seen Burt Reynold's original ""Longest Yard"", though I have just added it to the films that I am eagerly awaiting to see - so with that said, I went way beyond my typical style of cinema viewing and chose to watch ""Mean Machine"" first and foremost.  Obviously I didn't read the reviews close enough to know that it is simply a remake of Reynold's work, so I went in blindly ... very blindly.  This is probably one of the only times that I will watch a film out of sequential order (i.e. what was meant to be released first and second), but I am extremely happy with my decision.  ""Mean Machine"" was a crisp, ""thud""-packed film that didn't fight with clich&eacute;s, but instead gave us an action-comedy that only the British can conquer.  While most will complain that this film doesn't do justice to the original, I must ask if Sandler's did either?  ""The Longest Yard"" wasn't a groundbreaking piece of cinema, and to see a British team remake the film, it is almost like a smile on our American faces.  How often does that happen?  So, without seeing much of the other two films, I went into ""Mean Machine"" with a clean slate, and enjoyed every moment of it.  This was a fresh film, commercial in every since of the word, but fresh for what we decided to remake and slaughter.I hate sports films.  With this film I thought I would watch and return, without giving it a second thought.  I thought it would be another clich&eacute; moment of the underdogs beating out at the last moment without anyone skipping a beat and winning the female lead at the end.  We have all seen these before, and it is the clich&eacute; ride that most sports films seem to fall.  While ""Mean Machine"" was similar in nature, what lead to those final moments was really what transformed this film to above average.  Vinnie Jones is tolerable.  Actually, he is better in this film and shows more range with ""Mean Machine"" than I have seen him grapple in years.  Sure, he was fun in the Guy Ritchie films, but it was fun to see him play the lead this time, while Jason Statham played the muscle.  I loved, and in fact love his body of work, David Kelly.  He was phenomenal as the older mentor in this film.  What made ""Mean Machine"" stand out was the cast, the trouble I had with Sandler's film was that everyone was fighting to get the best joke in, everyone wanted to be in a scene with Sandler or Rock, but in this one, everyone had their own voice and logic.  There were actual characters in this film, ones that stood beyond themselves and created the world we were viewing.  With any sports film, there is that inconsistency that could transform the film into a very flat picture.  That was never the case here.  Jones and his crew gave us direction from point A to point B without missing a beat.  Doc, Burton, Massive, Monk, Ratchett, and Sykes brought the prison alive and made us root for a game we have nearly disregarded in America.The weakest part of this film had to be the story.  While the characters gave the story a voice as well as characters to root for, there was just something lacking with the story.  It was strong, much stronger than most sports films of the same nature, but there was just that level of punch missing that you would expect from any typical British film.  The direction may have had something to do with it, but not completely.  I can't put my finger on the issue, and I think it has to do with the ability to recycle films - there is always something missing from each carbon copy.  I need to see the original, but alone, ""Mean Machine"" was directed eagerly, but lacked the depth in the story.  I wanted to see Danny's downfall in the beginning, I wanted to know more about him prior to his jail time, the idea of him fixing games seemed minimal in the overall scope of what Danny had to do with playing the guards.  I needed that knowledge of whom he was and the struggles that he was facing.  Sure, it wasn't meant to be this grand bio-pic, but something (as short as it was needed) had to be there.  Maybe I am pulling at straws, but as I look at this picture as a whole, it was a stand-alone film that prided laughs (intelligent ones) as well as hard hitting action, but it needed something more.  I could watch this film again, and I would go through the motions, but something was missing.  It was like having the best piece of pie in the county, but realizing later that a scoop of ice cream would have been nice as a side.  Unknown director Barry Skolnick places this film together well, but I feel as if he could have done more.  I didn't need another ""Lock, Stock"", but I needed something that grabbed me further into.Will I buy this film?  Yep, I think I will just because I loathe the 20-minutes of the Sandler version and prefer to give others a taste of what decent remakes are like, but I cannot say that it is the best film watched.  My review seems scattered at best, and as I read through it again, I don't think I have quite the grasp on this film as I hoped.  I liked it, not loved it, and I could watch it again, but not too often.  Bubbles have more consistency than I do with ""Mean Machine"".  Maybe it was Charlie Fletcher's screenplay, but honestly I think I am just grabbing at air.  I think what could have toppled me with this film would have been some special features.  Something to show me how it was made, an audio commentary to give me a voice for the director, something that would have made me look deeper into this film.  ""Mean Machine"" isn't bland, but I needed a better flavor.Overall, I liked it.  I am growing tired of this review and think it will throw others off the trail of this invitingly fresh film, so I am going to stop.  I think everyone should watch this.  Sure, it doesn't have the bathroom humor of Sandler's version, but it does provide the Brits an opportunity to demonstrate that their ""football"" is just as exciting as ours.Grade: *** out of

I haven't seen the original but this wasn't bad.In a brilliant piece of casting ex-pro footballer turned tough guy actor Vinnie Jones plays Danny &quot;Mean Machine&quot; Meehan, an ex pro-footballer who is jailed for three years on assault charges.  But the prison warden (David Hemmings) happens to be a soccer nut, so he offers Meehan the opportunity to assemble a team of inmates and train them for a soccer game against the prison officers.Executive produced by Guy Ritchie, MEAN MACHINE is a formulaic but entertaining movie. The meshing of the sports/prison movie genres may make you see these guys as being right 'ard geezers or limp-wristed nancy boys, depending on your opinion of soccer. Well, there's a Robbie Williams song near the end of the movie so I'll leave that open to viewers to make their own judgments. MEAN MACHINE's still a good movie. If you're a soccer fan it's probably a five star movie.

592831,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JKZ0,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 4]","The formula is familiar but enjoyable. A group of British tough guys are assembled for an enterprise that combines violence with humor, while cherishing their peculiar personalities and even finding goodness where none should grow. We've had prisoners winning a gardening competition, pot dealers helping little old ladies, and crooks leaving crime for life as real estate agents. Now here is ""Mean Machine,"" about a corrupt British soccer champion, jailed for rigging an important match, and ordered by the prison governor to coach the inmates' team. The big match will be against the guards' team.If this premise rings a faint, far-off bell, you may be remembering Robert Aldrich's ""The Longest Yard"" (1974), with one of Burt Reynolds' best performances, that told the same story, more or less, in terms of American football. Barry Skolnick's ""Mean Machine"" is more than inspired by ""The Longest Yard;"" it's based on the same Tracy Keenan Wynn screenplay, and indeed ""Mean Machine"" was even the original title of ""The Longest Yard."" The movie stars Vinnie Jones, a real-life footballer so tough he didn't even play for England, he played for Wales. He was known for dirty football, just like Danny Meehan, his character in the film. You may recognize Jones' Fearless Fosdick features from ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" directed by Guy Ritchie, who produced this film. And he has appeared as a fearsome background presence in ""Snatch,"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Swordfish."" In his first lead role, he handles the dialogue like meat and potatoes, one line at a time, chewed carefully.The deal: The prison governor (David Hemmings) has a gambling problem, and is crazy about football. He orders his new celebrity prisoner to coach the team. This does not sit well with the head guard, who coaches the guards' team, but what can he say? Danny doesn't much want to enter the coaching profession, but the governor makes him a threat he can't ignore.The most enjoyable passages are some of the most predictable, recycled out of countless other movies where a leader has to pick his men. Danny finds himself with the prison contraband retailer, Massive (Vas Blackwood), as his right-hand man, and a violent, feared con named Monk (Jason Statham) as his star player. He gets a lot of valuable prison lore and advice from the ancient convict Doc (David Kelly, who you will remember from his naked scooter ride in ""Waking Ned Devine""). Kelly has had a whole late flowering while playing twinkly geezers, clouded only by the distressing tendency of his characters to end up in sentimental death scenes.All leads up to the big match, which of course involves hard play and dirty tricks, and dovetails neatly with the governor's gambling problem. ""Mean Machine"" lacks the social satire of ""The Longest Yard,"" which was a true early 1970s film and therefore anti-establishment. ""Mean Machine"" is only interested in the characters and the game. Guy Ritchie, who started out as such an innovator in ""Lock, Stock, etc.,"" seems to have headed directly for reliable generic conventions as a producer. But they are reliable, and have become conventions for a reason: They work. ""Mean Machine"" is what it is, and very nicely, too.",4,Mean Machine (A PROPER game of footy),1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,3219,"['formula', 'familiar', 'enjoyable', 'group', 'British', 'tough', 'guys', 'are', 'assembled', 'enterprise', 'violence', 'humor', 'cherishing', 'peculiar', 'personalities', 'even', 'finding', 'goodness', 'where', 'none', 'should', 'grow', ""'ve"", 'had', 'prisoners', 'winning', 'gardening', 'competition', 'pot', 'dealers', 'helping', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'crooks', 'leaving', 'crime', 'life', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'Now', 'here', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'corrupt', 'British', 'soccer', 'champion', 'jailed', 'rigging', 'important', 'match', 'ordered', 'prison', 'governor', 'coach', 'inmates', 'team', 'big', 'match', 'will', 'be', 'guards', 'team.If', 'premise', 'faint', 'far-off', 'bell', 'may', 'be', 'remembering', 'Robert', 'Aldrich', 'Longest', 'Yard', '1974', 'one', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'best', 'performances', 'told', 'same', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'terms', 'American', 'football', 'Barry', 'Skolnick', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'more', 'inspired', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'based', 'same', 'Tracy', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'screenplay', 'indeed', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'was', 'even', 'original', 'title', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'movie', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'real-life', 'footballer', 'so', 'tough', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'England', 'played', 'Wales', 'was', 'known', 'dirty', 'football', 'just', 'Danny', 'Meehan', 'character', 'film', 'may', 'recognize', 'Jones', 'Fearless', 'Fosdick', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'directed', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'appeared', 'fearsome', 'background', 'presence', 'Snatch', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'Swordfish', 'first', 'lead', 'role', 'dialogue', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'one', 'line', 'time', 'chewed', 'carefully.The', 'deal', 'prison', 'governor', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'gambling', 'problem', 'crazy', 'football', 'orders', 'new', 'celebrity', 'prisoner', 'coach', 'team', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'head', 'guard', 'who', 'guards', 'team', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Danny', ""n't"", 'much', 'want', 'enter', 'coaching', 'profession', 'governor', 'threat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore.The', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'passages', 'are', 'most', 'predictable', 'recycled', 'countless', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'leader', 'pick', 'men', 'Danny', 'prison', 'contraband', 'retailer', 'Massive', 'Vas', 'Blackwood', 'right-hand', 'man', 'violent', 'feared', 'con', 'named', 'Monk', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'star', 'player', 'lot', 'valuable', 'prison', 'lore', 'advice', 'ancient', 'convict', 'Doc', 'David', 'Kelly', 'who', 'will', 'remember', 'naked', 'scooter', 'ride', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'Kelly', 'had', 'whole', 'late', 'flowering', 'playing', 'twinkly', 'geezers', 'clouded', 'only', 'distressing', 'tendency', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'sentimental', 'death', 'scenes.All', 'up', 'big', 'match', 'course', 'hard', 'play', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'neatly', 'governor', 'gambling', 'problem', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'social', 'satire', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'was', 'true', 'early', '1970s', 'film', 'therefore', 'anti-establishment', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'only', 'interested', 'characters', 'game', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'such', 'innovator', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'etc.', 'have', 'headed', 'directly', 'reliable', 'generic', 'conventions', 'producer', 'are', 'reliable', 'have', 'become', 'conventions', 'reason', 'work', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'what', 'very', 'nicely', 'too']",Mean Machine

Luckily, he cuts a deal with the warden and begins coaching a flashy and undisciplined group of cons for a game against the prison guards. The game is riddled with under-the-table bets and blackmailing, and has an interesting lead-up.There is much heated violence in this film, but nothing too graphic. In fact, when Danny has the prison's resident pyscho show the boys how to play dirty on the pitch you will be laughing uncontrollably.The finale is the big game makes for a gripping piece of viewing. Add to this, the flashy moves, brilliant camera angles, the hilarous play-by-play commentary of two cons each named Bob, and cheap tactics employed, and you have a very good ending to a very good film.Mean Machine is a highly entertaining British film, and is certainly worth a look if you enjoy soccer or good action and jokes.In the words of Danny Meehan, ""Stick this one in your trophy cabinet"".",4,A tough-nut British winner,1057104000,"07 2, 2003",2003,1193,"['Mean', 'Machine', '2001', 'remake', ""'The"", 'Longest', 'Yard', 'rough-and-tumble', 'story', 'prison', 'struggles', 'soccer', 'field.When', 'disgraced', 'England', 'captain', 'Danny', 'Meehan', 'ex-soccer', 'star', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'sent', 'prison', 'assault', 'cops', 'drunk', 'target', 'everyone', 'inside', 'Luckily', 'deal', 'warden', 'coaching', 'flashy', 'undisciplined', 'group', 'cons', 'game', 'prison', 'guards', 'game', 'riddled', 'under-the-table', 'bets', 'blackmailing', 'interesting', 'lead-up.There', 'much', 'heated', 'violence', 'film', 'nothing', 'too', 'graphic', 'fact', 'when', 'Danny', 'prison', 'resident', 'pyscho', 'show', 'boys', 'how', 'play', 'dirty', 'pitch', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably.The', 'finale', 'big', 'game', 'gripping', 'piece', 'viewing', 'Add', 'flashy', 'moves', 'brilliant', 'camera', 'angles', 'hilarous', 'play-by-play', 'commentary', 'two', 'cons', 'named', 'Bob', 'cheap', 'tactics', 'employed', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'very', 'good', 'film.Mean', 'Machine', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'British', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', 'enjoy', 'good', 'action', 'jokes.In', 'words', 'Danny', 'Meehan', 'Stick', 'one', 'trophy', 'cabinet']",Mean Machine
592840,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKZ0,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 8]","Vinnie Jones is Danny ""Mean Machine"" Meehan, former star soccer player, who was once hired to promote the sports goods of first-rate company Umbro.  But now drunk and disgraced, he is in jail, doing his time of three-year sentence.  But the governor there, himself deep in debt, wants him to go back to the game (between wards and prisoners), AND lose it on purpose, just like Danny did in the international match between England and Germany.Sounds familiar?  Sure, the film's opening credits show that ""Mean Machine"" is actually based on Burt Reynolds's film ""The Longest Yard.""  You may say, or groan, ""Not again!,"" but be assured, this new one is surprisingly good, considering that Vinnie Jones's career as actor has just got started.  And his fans, be proud; though he may not be nominated for BAFTA awards, his turn as the first-time lead is really good, and convincing.The virtue of ""Mean Machine"" is that the film looks very authentic.  That's no surprise, you say, because Vinnie Jones was a professional soccer player, but keep in mind that he had to shape up his body again to fit in the role as it has been pretty long since he had retired.  As I'm a huge soccer fan, and watch Euporean games live on cable TV in Japan, I can tell you this, but the players of ""Mean Machine"" team are good at playing soccer, and the most remarkable thing is that they play so well  that their movements in the game is authentic (except for the goal keeper, who likes keep the ball too much), and look very real, if not as good as those you see in English Premier games.  On top of that, most scenes are shot in real prison, The Oxford Prison, now disused for years.But the greatest find is Vinnie Jones, who is natural and sometimes even humorous.  He is much better than ill-used role in ""Swordfish,"" and the director knows how to use his tough-guy persona on the screen.  The film keeps a good speed, and the supports are also effective, such as veteran actor David Kelly (""Greenfingers,"" another prison drama, and ""Waking Ned Divine"").  And for the soccer fans (and players), Vinnie's lecture on ""How to Commit Foul Plays"" is very funny, alarmingly.Overall the film is a drama, and some of the scenes are very serious, but the film doens't stop there too long.  Predictable you may call it, but I still find it fun to watch.
