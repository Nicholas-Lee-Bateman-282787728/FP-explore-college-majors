It really didn't focus too much on the history of marijuana usage and didn't analyze the prospects of future legalization (they're dim). But being a non-Californian I really had no idea of what some of the medical dispensaries looked like before watching this video. From what I saw what's going on there is pretty intriguing. Further, one of the reasons we should treasure federalism is because of situations like the one highlighted here (in the film) where the DEA overrides the local civic authorities and starts busting up shops. Those scenes were a disgrace. I hope people see this film and realize the necessity of decreasing the size of the federal government in the hopes of preserving all of our liberties.

I think he got stoned beyond the point of being funny most of the 30 days he was high.  Most of the content about legislation was common knowledge so I didn't learn anything knew.  The most interesting part to me was the closing of legal, medical cannabis stores in California due to discrepancies between federal and state laws regarding marijuana.  In the movie they show cannabis stores in California being shut down by the DEA (federal officials) despite the state law which has legalizing it.  It was very shocking to see stores get closed down at random and have their patient records as well as their supply of marijuana confiscated and never returned even after they were legally allowed to reopen.

Paff,"[9, 14]","This dvd is about a man (Douglas Benson, a comedian) who is normally a pot smoker who agrees to smoke ABSOLUTELY NO POT FOR 30 DAYS & then to smoke pot ALL DAY EVERYDAY FOR 30 DAYS and document the differences in these 2 time periods in his mood, his health (overall health as well as lung function & sperm count), mental fucntion, & even psychic ability. The results are tabulated by a medical doctor, a pyshciatrist & someone overseeing the ""psychic"" testing.Dispersed throughout the movie are snippets from his various stand-up comedy shows. I found this documentary to be very comical, entertaining, interesting, informative & honest. It validates what I already knew to be true: THAT POT IS NOT BAD FOR YOU!!!!! True you shouldn't smoke & drive or smoke & operate heavy machinery but basically this guy suffered NO ILL EFFECTS FROM BEING HIGH FOR A MONTH STRAIGHT! I found his comedy to be much better during the ""high"" month & he seemed much happier during that month as well.I learned a lot watching this documentary that I never knew before as well as having other things that I did already know re-affirmed. I don't reccomend this documentary for kids or anyone under the age of 17. But other than that I *HIGHLY* RECCOMEND IT! (Pun intended!)

1156918,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0017INRFO,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","""Super High Me"" portrays standup comedian Doug Benson's experiment to see what would happen to him if he, a regular smoker of marijuana, went 30 days without smoking it and then go on a continuous binge of marijuana smoking for the next thirty days. Benson makes it no secret that he was at least in part inspired to do this by Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me' in which Spurlock discovers that the effects of 30 days of fast food aren't exactly all that great--it's unhealthy for you. Benson wants to learn if 30 days of abstinence immediately followed by 30 days of marijuana ""immersion"" would have any effects on his mind and body. Doug also knows that the effects of smoking marijuana can be distinctly different for different people. Some tolerate it well and others don't. Doug will try to continue his work as a standup comedian while he goes through the entire two month experiment. All in all, Doug's trial remains really interesting; I never felt bored or itchy for the movie to end. It all flows well and the cinematography is terrific. We get brief comments from other comedians who know Doug, too.Predictably, it was tough for Doug to take himself off marijuana as he is a routine smoker; we see him driving down the street in his car and he not so jokingly states that everything reminds him of marijuana--even the green traffic lights at intersections! However, Doug does an admirable job of holding it all together and he doesn't cheat--he's committed to his experiment. Doug also takes a trial SAT; a test to see if he's a psychic and he meets with both a psychologist and his internist to get tested once while he's completely sober and another time when he's rather stoned indeed.The outcome is rather interesting; and I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave a good deal of that part out. We do get a basic introduction to how Californians were able to vote their way into the legal use of medical marijuana within the state; although we also see conflicts arising when federal agents and federal law enforcement step in to close a store that sells marijuana legally in California because the government at the federal level does not allow marijuana to be legally sold. We also lean that the stores selling marijuana, which are called ""dispensaries,"" are growing in number at a fairly good pace in California at the time this film was made. We get a brief look at the first legal dispensary in California; and I really like that we meet a couple of people who use marijuana for legitimate medical reasons when their doctors have given them a special type of prescription that they can fill at a dispensary.Unfortunately, the DVD comes with no extras--unless you count the theatrical trailer as a bonus extra. I would have liked a running commentary from the director and/or Doug Benson himself; but this is lacking and that's a disappointment.If you want to study the effects of marijuana on people and the history of marijuana, this film is probably one of the better places to start. I commend Doug Benson for putting his experiment on film for us to watch and ponder. The footage of Doug doing his standup routines gives the movie extra flavor that works well, too.",4,"interesting, funny and insightful",1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,3194,"['Super', 'High', 'Me', 'standup', 'comedian', 'Doug', 'Benson', 'experiment', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'regular', 'smoker', 'marijuana', 'went', '30', 'days', 'smoking', 'then', 'go', 'continuous', 'binge', 'marijuana', 'smoking', 'next', 'thirty', 'days', 'Benson', 'secret', 'was', 'least', 'part', 'inspired', 'do', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'Spurlock', 'discovers', 'effects', '30', 'days', 'fast', 'food', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'great', 'unhealthy', 'Benson', 'learn', '30', 'days', 'abstinence', 'immediately', 'followed', '30', 'days', 'marijuana', 'immersion', 'would', 'have', 'effects', 'mind', 'body', 'Doug', 'also', 'effects', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'can', 'be', 'distinctly', 'different', 'different', 'people', 'tolerate', 'well', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'Doug', 'will', 'try', 'continue', 'work', 'standup', 'comedian', 'entire', 'two', 'month', 'experiment', 'Doug', 'trial', 'really', 'interesting', 'never', 'felt', 'bored', 'itchy', 'movie', 'end', 'well', 'cinematography', 'terrific', 'get', 'brief', 'comments', 'other', 'comedians', 'who', 'know', 'Doug', 'too.Predictably', 'was', 'tough', 'Doug', 'take', 'off', 'marijuana', 'routine', 'smoker', 'see', 'driving', 'down', 'street', 'car', 'not', 'so', 'jokingly', 'everything', 'marijuana', 'even', 'green', 'traffic', 'lights', 'intersections', 'However', 'Doug', 'admirable', 'job', 'holding', 'together', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'committed', 'experiment', 'Doug', 'also', 'trial', 'SAT', 'test', 'see', 'psychic', 'psychologist', 'internist', 'get', 'tested', 'once', 'completely', 'sober', 'time', 'when', 'rather', 'stoned', 'indeed.The', 'outcome', 'rather', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'so', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'good', 'deal', 'part', 'out', 'do', 'get', 'basic', 'introduction', 'how', 'Californians', 'were', 'able', 'vote', 'way', 'legal', 'use', 'medical', 'marijuana', 'state', 'also', 'see', 'conflicts', 'arising', 'when', 'federal', 'agents', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'step', 'close', 'store', 'marijuana', 'legally', 'California', 'government', 'federal', 'level', 'not', 'allow', 'marijuana', 'be', 'legally', 'sold', 'also', 'lean', 'stores', 'selling', 'marijuana', 'are', 'called', 'dispensaries', 'are', 'growing', 'number', 'fairly', 'good', 'pace', 'California', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'get', 'brief', 'look', 'first', 'legal', 'dispensary', 'California', 'really', 'meet', 'couple', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'marijuana', 'legitimate', 'medical', 'reasons', 'when', 'doctors', 'have', 'given', 'special', 'type', 'prescription', 'can', 'fill', 'dispensary.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'extras', 'count', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'bonus', 'extra', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'and/or', 'Doug', 'Benson', 'lacking', 'disappointment.If', 'want', 'study', 'effects', 'marijuana', 'people', 'history', 'marijuana', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'places', 'start', 'commend', 'Doug', 'Benson', 'putting', 'experiment', 'film', 'watch', 'ponder', 'footage', 'Doug', 'doing', 'standup', 'routines', 'movie', 'extra', 'flavor', 'well', 'too']",N/A

More importantly, it provided insight on the movement to expand Medical Marijuana in California and the DEA repression they face.  This film could've easily become a documentary on the Medical Marijuana movement, and hopefully some filmmakers will make a movie that focuses on that struggle.Benson's 30 days of smoking and eating herb was inspired by the 30 miserable days Morgan Spurlock spent eating fast food inSuper Size Me(another film I'd highly recommend).I especially enjoyed Benson's visits to places like the ""420 Temple"", and a trip he made to Vancouver to visit the ""Prince of Pot"" - Marc Emery.  Emery is a former seed distributor and the editor of the excellent ""Cannabis Culture"" magazine (which isn't available through Amazon, but can be found at most bookstores).""Super High Me"" also introduces us to some Medical Marijuana patients, including a young woman who first started using it at the age of 17 when she was going through her cancer treatments.  It's a crime that cannabis isn't legally available to anyone who wants it for medicinal, spiritual, or recreational reasons.

1156923,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0017INRFO,Sid the Elf,"[4, 7]",In 2004 Morgan Spurlock created a documentary about the effects eating McDonalds has on your body. He spent an entire month consuming 3 square meals of nothing but McDonalds fast food and opened up everyone's eyes to the damage they can do to their body. Fast forward 3 years and we get another documentary only this time it's with comedian Doug Benson as he tokes for 30 days straight. Even if you aren't a pot smoker you may still want to check this one out for a hilarious yet informative journey into the world of canibus.Doug Benson prior to this film was a pot smoker for 17 years. The idea came all as part of a joke in one of his stand-up acts where he said he should create a movie called Super High Me after the success of Super Size Me. Upon further thought he decided it was more then a joke and an actual idea. He gathered some friends and made it happen to expose pot use in a more enjoyable comedic light then previous documentaries in the past. Aside from just laughs the film really touches on making people aware of the benefits of medical marijuana use in many sick patients. You also get a look at the dispensaries in California and the fight they go through with law enforcement.Super High Me is really a solid documentary on a serious debate going on in our country today. It doesn't focus too much on the current state of making it legal but does provide a lot of information you may not be aware of. This one will definately rank high among smokers but those who don't smoke would still find it really funny and insightful.,4,"Hey Hey Hey, smoke weed everyday",1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1547,"['2004', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'created', 'documentary', 'effects', 'eating', 'McDonalds', 'body', 'spent', 'entire', 'month', 'consuming', '3', 'square', 'meals', 'nothing', 'McDonalds', 'fast', 'food', 'opened', 'up', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'damage', 'can', 'do', 'body', 'Fast', 'forward', '3', 'years', 'get', 'documentary', 'only', 'time', 'comedian', 'Doug', 'Benson', '30', 'days', 'straight', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'pot', 'smoker', 'may', 'still', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'informative', 'journey', 'world', 'canibus.Doug', 'Benson', 'prior', 'film', 'was', 'pot', 'smoker', '17', 'years', 'idea', 'came', 'part', 'joke', 'one', 'stand-up', 'acts', 'where', 'said', 'should', 'create', 'movie', 'called', 'Super', 'High', 'Me', 'success', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'further', 'thought', 'decided', 'was', 'more', 'then', 'joke', 'actual', 'idea', 'gathered', 'friends', 'made', 'happen', 'expose', 'pot', 'use', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'comedic', 'light', 'then', 'previous', 'documentaries', 'past', 'Aside', 'just', 'film', 'really', 'making', 'people', 'aware', 'benefits', 'medical', 'marijuana', 'use', 'many', 'sick', 'patients', 'also', 'get', 'look', 'dispensaries', 'California', 'fight', 'go', 'law', 'enforcement.Super', 'High', 'Me', 'really', 'solid', 'documentary', 'serious', 'debate', 'going', 'country', 'today', ""n't"", 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'current', 'state', 'making', 'legal', 'provide', 'lot', 'information', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'one', 'will', 'definately', 'rank', 'high', 'smokers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'would', 'still', 'find', 'really', 'funny', 'insightful']",N/A

However, don't let the title ""documentary"" confuse you, this is sheerly for entertainments sake, which there's nothing wrong with. The comedian goes 30 days sober, then 30 days of being high for roughly 18 hours a day; how could it not be funny? However, the film does deal with some more serious issues regarding what is a very serious debate. The intersection between state and federal law is most dramatic portion of the film, with several scenes of raids conducted by the DEA of California marijuana dispensaries. But the ""tests"" that Benson subjects himself to (the SAT, physicals, even psychic analysis) are much more entertaining than anything. Most of the results are to be expected, like his loss of lung capacity and weight gain. It would surprise some to see he did better on the SAT while high, but most people score better the more times they take the test, regardless of mental state. In the end the film is sure to become a cult classic.

1156925,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B0017INRFO,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[12, 29]","Morgan Spurlock perhaps did the world a bit of a service when he released his film  Super Size Me . The film sought to show the negative effects upon the body a thirty day diet of fast food would cause in an effort to show the somewhat obvious effects of the fast food that society consumes on an amazing level.Though perhaps the outcome was already known, the film did open some viewers' eyes to different aspects of the fast food nation that we live in and sought to provide information as well as humor all in one.Just as music has Weird Al Yankovich belting out spoofs of pop music lyrics and songs, the world now has a Weird Al of the documentary industry. And I am pretty sure you were all just hoping for just that.Thanks to Doug Benson, a stand up comedian who is perhaps best known for his title as Stoner of The Year, we now have a spoof of Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me in Benson's release Super High Me .Appropriately released on 4/20 of 2008, Super High Me is Benson's attempt to provide a humorous look not at fast food but instead marijuana. While Spurlock's documentary attempted to detail for the masses that eat fast food the effects on the body that fast food has, Benson instead decides to try and convince those perhaps that do not smoke pot into believing that the effects of pot really are not all that bad.But aside the issue of whether it is right or wrong to take a little toke here and there, what Benson does is live thirty days completely marijuana free and then go on a thirty day binge of smoking marijuana again.Benson, who for years has sort of been a cult favorite amongst stoners across America, is no stranger to marijuana so perhaps a mere thirty day purge and then binge for him would be completely different than someone who has never smoked pot before and then they went on a binge. One would imagine that perhaps the results might be different.There is not much scientific evidence supporting the film and most of the experts that are interviewed are all familiar with Benson. The doctor that performs a post-purge and post-binge evaluation is an admitted former pot smoker and familiar with Benson's medical history so one might be left wondering whether or not an impartial doctor might have been a better selection.Much of the film shows Benson doing stand up comedy while under the influence of marijuana. Maybe it is just me, but a guy doing the same jokes over and over again about his daily run in with marijuana simply seems to lose its appeal after about 5 minutes. Most of the humor that is highlighted is more reminiscent of that stoner kid in middle school no one hung our with rather than being solid comedy of a national stand up comedian.Directed by Michael Blieden, one can assume that most of the brainpower, or lack thereof that went into this film came from either Benson or a room full of hippies blowing pot smoke in one another's faces. While certainly the premise was present for a potentially interesting documentary take on the marijuana fad that has swept the nation, the film all in all leaves the viewer more with a feeling of the munchies for another, better film to watch.Super High Me is nothing more than a bunch of smoke being blown in your face while you are being told that, ""...this is a really good movie."" Super High Me certainly is not the good stuff.
