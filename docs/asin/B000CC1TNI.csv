Second best was ""The Kennel Murder Case"", which had little to do with dogs but was an interesting murder in a locked room problem.  This gave William Powell the chance to show what he could do as the detective he would play in the successful Thin Man series later on.  ""The Spy in White"" was a quaint old show with an especially repulsive bad guy derived from the book ""The Eunuch of Stamboul.""

It has all the elements of oriental deception, murder, and sinister characters.  This one shows its age more than the others.

956077,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B000CC1TNI,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[5, 7]","I recently discovered these series of Mystery Films made by Echo Bridge Entertainment.  I'm not sure how many volumes of DVDs they've created, but they really whet the appetite for these types of classic film noir gems.I watched Volume 5 since it has my favorite actor William Powell, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  I thought the best way to review this DVD is to give a mini review of each film.  Also, the set sadly does not have any kind of features, no trailers, and not even any chapters where you can pick up where you left off! A star is subtracted due to this odd development!""Eyes In The Night"" was a very interesting film.  A blind detective and his dog Friday solve a murder which leads to a den of Nazi spies out to get plans to a new American weapon.  Though the film does not reveal much about the secret weapon, and there is a bit of overacting, it's fun to watch.  Edward Arnold is the detective and he uses his senses of smell and touch and his own blindness to put one over on the spies.  Donna Reed plays the snarky daughter in law who falls for the guy who is murdered early in the film.  Keeps my interest throughout -- 5 out of 5!  This film had a sequel a few years later, ""Hidden Eyes"" which I need to find.""The Kennel Murder Case"" with William Powell continues the Philo Vance films that were popular at the time, based on the books of the same name.  Philo and others enter a dog show and though he loses the show, he gets a fascinating locked-room murder that everyone thinks is a suicide but in fact is a murder!  The murder of Archer Coe is difficult to solve since he had several enemies who all would love to see him dead.  Dapper Powell and his well-dressed manner and always witty repartee is really fun to watch.  5 out of 5 stars!  Of course this film has been sequeled as well, including Basil Rathbone as Philo Vance in one of the series.""The Spy In White"" was interesting, but the quality of the film was fairly bad in several spots to where you miss some of the words and action.  A complex ring of ""revolutionaries"" that want to overthrow the Turkish government are gun-running and using a tobacco company as a front, which is little suspected by their new manager, Captain Larry, played by a very young James Mason, does a little spy work and falls in love with a girl or two in the process.  Slow in parts, but not bad.  4 out of 5 stars.""The Limping Man"" with a very young Lloyd Bridges starts out as an American coming to Britain on a nice propeller plane.  In an hour he will touch down in London, see a woman he has not seen in six years and hopes to rekindle an old romance with her, little knowing that the girl is being blackmailed.  Several other characters are out to get Lloyd's character and seem pretty bent on stopping him.  The police have a few good scenes too, especially the detectives who quickly (perhaps too quickly and conveniently) put the clues together.  Several things I do not like about this film -- the musical numbers that add nothing to the plot and a long drawn-out dubbed song that is simply awful.And the end is such a cheat!  It's like a plot where a guy goes along, the viewer invests all this time into the film and then ""I got hit by a truck"" the end (as example).  Hated that, despite a few well-done scenes.  2 out of 5 stars.I do recommend Mystery Classics as a great way to be introduced to the world of Mystery fiction as presented during the glory days of Tinseltown!",4,"Good Collection But ""Limping Man"" is a Cheat!",1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3455,"['recently', 'discovered', 'series', 'Mystery', 'Films', 'made', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Entertainment', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'volumes', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'created', 'really', 'whet', 'appetite', 'types', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'gems.I', 'watched', 'Volume', '5', 'favorite', 'actor', 'William', 'Powell', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'thought', 'best', 'way', 'review', 'DVD', 'give', 'mini', 'review', 'film', 'Also', 'set', 'sadly', 'not', 'have', 'kind', 'features', 'trailers', 'not', 'even', 'chapters', 'where', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'star', 'subtracted', 'due', 'odd', 'development', 'Eyes', 'Night', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'blind', 'detective', 'dog', 'Friday', 'solve', 'murder', 'den', 'Nazi', 'out', 'get', 'plans', 'new', 'American', 'weapon', 'film', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'secret', 'weapon', 'bit', 'overacting', 'fun', 'watch', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'detective', 'senses', 'smell', 'touch', 'own', 'blindness', 'put', 'one', 'spies', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'snarky', 'daughter', 'law', 'who', 'guy', 'who', 'murdered', 'early', 'film', 'Keeps', 'interest', '5', '5', 'film', 'had', 'sequel', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Hidden', 'Eyes', 'need', 'find', 'Kennel', 'Murder', 'Case', 'William', 'Powell', 'Philo', 'Vance', 'films', 'were', 'popular', 'time', 'based', 'books', 'same', 'name', 'Philo', 'others', 'enter', 'dog', 'show', 'show', 'fascinating', 'locked-room', 'murder', 'everyone', 'suicide', 'fact', 'murder', 'murder', 'Archer', 'Coe', 'difficult', 'solve', 'had', 'several', 'enemies', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'dead', 'Dapper', 'Powell', 'well-dressed', 'manner', 'always', 'witty', 'repartee', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', '5', '5', 'stars', 'course', 'film', 'been', 'sequeled', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'Philo', 'Vance', 'one', 'series', 'Spy', 'White', 'was', 'interesting', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'bad', 'several', 'spots', 'where', 'miss', 'words', 'action', 'complex', 'ring', 'revolutionaries', 'want', 'overthrow', 'Turkish', 'government', 'are', 'gun-running', 'using', 'tobacco', 'company', 'front', 'little', 'suspected', 'new', 'manager', 'Captain', 'Larry', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'James', 'Mason', 'little', 'spy', 'work', 'love', 'girl', 'two', 'process', 'Slow', 'parts', 'not', 'bad', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Limping', 'Man', 'very', 'young', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'out', 'American', 'coming', 'Britain', 'nice', 'propeller', 'plane', 'hour', 'will', 'touch', 'down', 'London', 'see', 'woman', 'not', 'seen', 'six', 'years', 'rekindle', 'old', 'romance', 'little', 'knowing', 'girl', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'Several', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'seem', 'pretty', 'bent', 'stopping', 'police', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'too', 'especially', 'detectives', 'who', 'quickly', 'perhaps', 'too', 'quickly', 'conveniently', 'put', 'clues', 'together', 'Several', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'musical', 'numbers', 'add', 'nothing', 'plot', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'dubbed', 'song', 'simply', 'awful.And', 'end', 'such', 'cheat', 'plot', 'where', 'guy', 'along', 'viewer', 'time', 'film', 'then', 'got', 'hit', 'truck', 'end', 'example', 'Hated', 'few', 'well-done', 'scenes', '2', '5', 'stars.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'Mystery', 'Classics', 'great', 'way', 'be', 'introduced', 'world', 'Mystery', 'fiction', 'presented', 'glory', 'days', 'Tinseltown']",N/A

It contains such classic mysteries as ""Eyes in the Night"", ""The Kennel Murder Case"", ""The Limping Man"", and ""The Spy in White"".The films are typically 73-85 minutes in length on average.  The directors include Robert N. Lee, Walter Summers, Andrew Martan, and Fred Zinneman.The mysteries have great plots, twists, surprise endings, and spoilers.
