Olmedo,"[3, 3]","I own all Everybody Loves Raymond (Seasons 1-7) on DVD so far, and watched the final seasons of this show quite religiously when it was on the air. While some sitcoms are uneven, this one really delivered consistently, and actually got better as the characters developed and the ensemble became more familiar with one another.While all episodes are very funny, I found the one where Robert's new girlfriend Angela eats a fly at the dinner table when she thinks no one is looking (and Ray sees her do it) is fall-on-the-floor-and-hurt-yourself laughing funny!! Also of note are the episodes about Robert purposely mucking up his and Amy's wedding invitation (when Debra screams at Raymond over his faking incompetence throughout their marriage just to get out of doing things, giving examples such as folding shirts, making beds, and diapering the kids, etc., I thought I'd die laughing), the episode in which Ray and Debra have a standoff about moving a suitcase they both used on a trip (Ray puts smelly cheese in it before leaving on his next business trip, and carries his clothing in a plastic supermarket bag rather than be the one to move the suitcase), and the episode in which Ray and Debra try to pick ""replacement spouses"" for each other in the event that one of them should die (Ray, Debra, Robert, Amy, Frank, Marie, Bernie, and Linda ALL make quite a scene at a funeral in that one).What is remarkable about this show is not only how it got better and better, but how I can see these episodes over and over and still get quite a belly laugh each time! Luckily, you can also see these shows quite a bit in syndication, but there's nothing like having the DVDs to see an episode that you'd like to re-watch whenever you want to... also, I find watching on DVD very enjoyable because you end up catching jokes that you missed watching the show on TV (either because you were distracted or laughing too hard from the LAST joke).This is one series I was really sad to see come to an end... in terms of family sitcoms, nothing has come on the air since that has been nearly as good.",5,This is a show that actually got better and funnier with each season,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2089,"['own', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Seasons', '1-7', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', 'watched', 'final', 'seasons', 'show', 'quite', 'religiously', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'uneven', 'one', 'really', 'delivered', 'consistently', 'actually', 'got', 'better', 'characters', 'developed', 'ensemble', 'became', 'more', 'familiar', 'one', 'another.While', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'found', 'one', 'where', 'Robert', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Angela', 'fly', 'dinner', 'table', 'when', 'one', 'looking', 'Ray', 'do', 'fall-on-the-floor-and-hurt-yourself', 'laughing', 'funny', 'Also', 'note', 'are', 'episodes', 'Robert', 'purposely', 'mucking', 'up', 'Amy', 'wedding', 'invitation', 'when', 'Debra', 'Raymond', 'faking', 'incompetence', 'marriage', 'just', 'get', 'doing', 'things', 'giving', 'examples', 'such', 'folding', 'shirts', 'making', 'beds', 'diapering', 'kids', 'etc.', 'thought', ""'d"", 'die', 'laughing', 'episode', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'have', 'standoff', 'moving', 'suitcase', 'used', 'trip', 'Ray', 'smelly', 'cheese', 'leaving', 'next', 'business', 'trip', 'clothing', 'plastic', 'supermarket', 'bag', 'rather', 'be', 'one', 'move', 'suitcase', 'episode', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'try', 'pick', 'replacement', 'spouses', 'other', 'event', 'one', 'should', 'die', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'Robert', 'Amy', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'Bernie', 'Linda', 'ALL', 'make', 'scene', 'funeral', 'one', 'remarkable', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'how', 'can', 'see', 'episodes', 'still', 'get', 'quite', 'belly', 'time', 'Luckily', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'shows', 'quite', 'bit', 'syndication', 'nothing', 'having', 'DVDs', 'see', 'episode', ""'d"", 'like', 're-watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'also', 'find', 'watching', 'DVD', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'up', 'catching', 'jokes', 'missed', 'watching', 'show', 'TV', 'were', 'distracted', 'laughing', 'too', 'hard', 'LAST', 'joke', '.This', 'one', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'sad', 'see', 'come', 'end', 'terms', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'nothing', 'come', 'air', 'been', 'nearly', 'as', 'good']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 7

1006516,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000GRUMQY,MollyRK,"[40, 45]","In the case of many television series that last as long as ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" did (nine outstanding seasons, to be exact), a considerable slump in the writing and a decrease in passionate acting are to be expected some time after the youthfulness of the first few seasons have passed. With this groundbreaking show, however, Season 7 contains as much momentum as any previous year in its run, and an entertaining crop of episodes are available for fans in this upcoming DVD set.""Raymond's"" seventh season maintains the similar low-key, hilarious formula without going overboard for ""better"" ratings--an impressive trait that has left the series as one of the classiest contemporary shows you can hope to find. This 2004-2005 year opens with the Barones taking drastic actions to clear up the Debra/Marie feud that left everyone hanging at the end of Season 6. From there, Robert starts dating a girl who seems perfect until the family learns about some of her strange snacking habits, and Frank has a heart-to-heart with little Ally after an incident at the supermarket finally shows him how his behavior impacts his grandchildren. There is a special wedding proposal (complete with lots of squad cars and Marie-style shrieks), a few important invitations get botched (compliments of guess who?), one of the Barones lands in jail (here's a clue: it's the very last person you'd expect), a suitcase on the stairs temporarily interrupts the flow of daily life, and the Robert/Amy relationship finally receives its overdue glory in a humorous and equally touching 2-hour season finale. Oh, and don't forget that this is the year that we meet Amy's family for the first time--which, in itself, is more than enough said for fans :)With this DVD set, the same side-splitting bloopers will be available, as well as select-episode commentaries for ""Counseling,"" ""Meeting the Parents,"" ""Baggage,"" and ""Just a Formality."" (I was surprised they didn't do a commentary for ""Robert's Wedding,"" since that was such a special landmark episode, but the ones they picked were still good.) Some new voices on those commentaries will include Anna Romano (none other than Ray's real-life wife) and Monica Horan, whose priceless facial expressions and sweet demeanor make Amy McDougal a welcome new regular in the show's star lineup. Be sure to listen also for Fred Willard and Chris Elliot, who portray Amy's hilarious know-it-all father and weird-as-sin younger brother.  That being said, Season 7 is the typical entertainment that you would expect from Raymond. An impeccable script, brilliant acting, and that on-the-nail connection with real life make this what it is--top-notch quality that you will want to remember forever with these DVD releases. And the best news of all? Some of the best is still to come with Seasons 8 and 9, both equally wonderful and well-written. The entire series should undoubtedly be out within the next year, and that is some of the greatest television you could ever preserve.Note: As another reviewer here has already pointed out, the classic ""Robert's Wedding"" episode (and the first season finale of the series that isn't a flashback sequence) does NOT include the short epilogue that shows all the main characters joining Robert and Amy on the dance floor. It's a very short scene but an important one, and I was disappointed to see that they left it out. Aside from that, though, everything on the DVD looks pretty good. As always, the commentaries are one of the best reasons to purchase the DVD's. Not many television series offer this option on their DVD releases, and ""Raymond"" does this for about 4 episodes every season. Ray Romano and Phil Rosenthal have had consistent enthusiasm with every commentary track they've done, and they're a pleasure to listen to.",5,"classic ""Raymond"" momentum fuels this well-written Season 7",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,3794,"['case', 'many', 'television', 'series', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'did', 'nine', 'outstanding', 'seasons', 'be', 'exact', 'considerable', 'slump', 'writing', 'decrease', 'passionate', 'acting', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'time', 'youthfulness', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'have', 'passed', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'however', 'Season', '7', 'contains', 'much', 'momentum', 'previous', 'year', 'run', 'entertaining', 'crop', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'fans', 'upcoming', 'DVD', 'set', 'Raymond', 'seventh', 'season', 'similar', 'low-key', 'hilarious', 'formula', 'going', 'overboard', 'better', 'ratings', 'impressive', 'trait', 'left', 'series', 'one', 'classiest', 'contemporary', 'shows', 'can', 'hope', 'find', '2004-2005', 'year', 'Barones', 'taking', 'drastic', 'actions', 'clear', 'up', 'Debra/Marie', 'feud', 'left', 'everyone', 'hanging', 'end', 'Season', '6', 'there', 'Robert', 'dating', 'girl', 'who', 'perfect', 'family', 'strange', 'snacking', 'habits', 'Frank', 'heart-to-heart', 'little', 'Ally', 'incident', 'supermarket', 'finally', 'how', 'behavior', 'grandchildren', 'special', 'wedding', 'proposal', 'complete', 'lots', 'squad', 'cars', 'Marie-style', 'shrieks', 'few', 'important', 'invitations', 'get', 'botched', 'compliments', 'guess', 'who', 'one', 'Barones', 'jail', 'here', 'clue', 'very', 'last', 'person', ""'d"", 'expect', 'suitcase', 'stairs', 'temporarily', 'flow', 'daily', 'life', 'Robert/Amy', 'relationship', 'finally', 'overdue', 'glory', 'humorous', 'equally', 'touching', '2-hour', 'season', 'finale', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'year', 'meet', 'Amy', 'family', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'enough', 'said', 'fans', 'DVD', 'set', 'same', 'side-splitting', 'bloopers', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'as', 'well', 'select-episode', 'commentaries', 'Counseling', 'Meeting', 'Parents', 'Baggage', 'Just', 'Formality', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'commentary', 'Robert', 'Wedding', 'was', 'such', 'special', 'landmark', 'episode', 'ones', 'picked', 'were', 'still', 'good', 'new', 'voices', 'commentaries', 'will', 'include', 'Anna', 'Romano', 'none', 'other', 'Ray', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Monica', 'Horan', 'priceless', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sweet', 'demeanor', 'make', 'Amy', 'McDougal', 'welcome', 'new', 'regular', 'show', 'star', 'lineup', 'Be', 'sure', 'listen', 'also', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'who', 'portray', 'Amy', 'hilarious', 'know-it-all', 'father', 'weird-as-sin', 'younger', 'brother', 'being', 'said', 'Season', '7', 'typical', 'entertainment', 'would', 'expect', 'Raymond', 'impeccable', 'script', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'on-the-nail', 'connection', 'real', 'life', 'make', 'what', 'top-notch', 'quality', 'will', 'want', 'remember', 'forever', 'DVD', 'releases', 'best', 'news', 'best', 'still', 'come', 'Seasons', '8', '9', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'well-written', 'entire', 'series', 'should', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'out', 'next', 'year', 'greatest', 'television', 'could', 'ever', 'preserve.Note', 'reviewer', 'here', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'classic', 'Robert', 'Wedding', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'series', ""n't"", 'flashback', 'sequence', 'NOT', 'include', 'short', 'epilogue', 'main', 'characters', 'joining', 'Robert', 'Amy', 'dance', 'floor', 'very', 'short', 'scene', 'important', 'one', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'left', 'out', 'Aside', 'though', 'everything', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'always', 'commentaries', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'reasons', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Not', 'many', 'television', 'series', 'offer', 'option', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Raymond', 'about', '4', 'episodes', 'season', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Phil', 'Rosenthal', 'have', 'had', 'consistent', 'enthusiasm', 'commentary', 'track', ""'ve"", 'done', ""'re"", 'pleasure', 'listen']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 7

1006518,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000GRUMQY,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[6, 6]","I enjoy watching all the seasons of Raymond.  In Season 7, some of the episodes became a little more serious and the fighting a little more heavy (""Pet the Bunny,"" ""Robert Needs Money,"" ""Marie's Vision""), which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of the usual 5 stars I give for this excellent series.  The first episode concludes the storyline began in Season 6 where Debra and Marie stop talking that I think was a little overly petty and silly even for them!  There are still, as always, excellent episodes here; my favorites being the ones with Amy's parents. Also Robert and Amy finally get hitched, so it is an important season.  What was up with the theme song and segment?  Yuck!  Too much repetition and stupid scenes!  Fortunately, it's not shown on every episode.Disc 1""The Cult"": This episode concludes the ""Mother's Day""/""The Bigger Person""/ ""The First Time"" issue from Season 6 where Debra and Marie stop talking to each other because Marie got bent out of shape when Debra wouldn't drop everything to let her kids tell knock-knock jokes in front of her friends.  Robert can't handle the tension between his mom and sister-in-law, so he joins a group called ""The Inner Path."" This phase doesn't last long, so they use it to bring together the bickering broads.  The whole 4-episode-long storyline was really reaching and the ending lame.""Counseling"": Raymond and Debra have an even more heated argument than usual over cleaning the house and then they find out their friends are seeing a therapist. When they make an appointment, Raymond knows all the right things to say which exasperates Debra.  Then Raymond makes a shocking confession.""Homework"": Raymond goes on a crusade against the mountains of homework Ally's getting since Debra is making him help her.""Pet the Bunny"": Another emotionally charged episode.  Raymond gets a head start on his father's eulogy and Frank goes mental over a story about him petting a bunny.""Who Am I?"": Raymond isn't having fun hanging around the guys anymore and Debra is hopeful he's finally growing up.  Then she thinks he may have grown up too much when he starts going to his father's lodge.Disc 2""Robert Needs Money"": Robert is down on his luck so Raymond and Debra give him $1,000 and then regret it when he decides to use the money to go to Vegas.  Boy do Ray and Deb get mad at him!""The Sigh"": Debra guilt trips Raymond into giving her their bathroom and Ray begins to think he has no place of his own.""Annoying Kid"": A couple Raymond and Debra are friends with have a son who drives Ray crazy with his robot games.  The guy who plays Neil the father (Craig Anton) is really hot!""She's the One"": Robert thinks he has found the perfect woman until Raymond finds out something very peculiar about her.  This one was weird!""Marie's Vision"": Marie gets glasses and notices flaws in everybody.  Then she gets in a fight with Frank and calls what they have a ""loveless marriage"" which really sets Frank off.  I'm not sure what triggered Marie into saying something that would ignite such an emotional outburst, but the story gets very serious very fast.Disc 3""The Thought That Counts"": Robert gives Raymond the perfect idea for a birthday present for Debra and takes all the credit in typical Raymond fashion.  Very strange how well Robert knows Debra yet gives his girlfriend stupid ice show tickets.  Hmmmmm.""Grandpa Steals"": Ally sees Frank making a scene in the grocery store after he was caught eating bulk trail mix and is uncomfortable around him.""Somebody Hates Raymond"": Raymond finds out a famous radio personality hates him and it's eating him up as to why.  Robert gloats over it until he meets the jerk. I like how Robert sticks up for his brother in this one.""Just a Formality"": Robert wants to marry Amy but the task of asking her father for permission proves more than a formality.""The Disciplinarian"": Debra is angry at Raymond because he always makes her be the bad guy when it comes to setting boundaries for the kids.  Raymond is afraid that, no matter what they do, their kids are going to do crazy things like they did.  I like the Jethro Tull concert mention (I love that band!).  When the family gathers to discuss important issues (i.e. ""Talk to Your Daughter"" from season 6) is usually when the episode fizzles for me as their conversations are often so silly.Disc 4""Meeting the Parents"": Amy and Robert are having brunch for Frank and Marie.  Surprise! Amy's parents show up.  Good one!""Sweet Charity"": Debra gets Raymond to volunteer at the hospital and Ray is angry when Robert takes Traffic Cop Timmy and makes fun of him.""The Plan"": Ray convinces Robert to screw up his wedding invitations so Amy won't ask him to do anymore work.  Unfortunately, they get mailed.  Another good one!""Sleepover at Peggy's"": Ally is spending the night at Peggy's-the Girl Scout Nazi--and a fanny-touching incident makes him think she has the hots for him.""Who's Next?"": Ray and Deb have a discussion as to who they'd pick for each other if they died.  The infamous Harriet Lichmann makes an appearance.  It ends up being an argument at the funeral.Disc 5""The Shower"": Debra drinks too much at Amy's bridal shower and is picked up for DUI when she's found napping in her car.  I didn't know you could be arrested if your keys are in the ignition and you're not driving.""The Baggage"": Deb and Ray have an argument over who should unpack a suitcase that's been sitting on the staircase for three weeks.""The Bachelor Party"": Ray throws a bachelor party for Robert that is lame so his family makes him organize a second party that may prove disastrous thanks to Amy's brother.""Robert's Wedding Parts I & II"": Robert's wedding is almost ruined by a little speech courtesy of mother dearest (what a surprise).",4,"""Oh my God, she finally killed

1006521,A1CEGUI0SR7ULF,B000GRUMQY,"Philip S. Mann ""The Professor""","[0, 0]","There are two sitcoms that I consider to be the last great sitcom.  I make two choices because one is animated (King of the Hill), and the other is live action (Everybody Loves Raymond).  This review concerns the latter.  The cast alone justifies my opinion, plus the writing is on the same level as that of the original Dick Van Dyke Show.  The characters are so well deliniated, that few, if any, will not find someone identifiable for themselves, or people they know.  The physical humor between Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton can be breathtaking at times, and the chemistry between Romano and Brad Garrett is often identical to that of Art Carney and Jackie Gleason.  All that said, there can be no greater period in the shows history and dramatic arc, than the seventh season.  The season begins with an episode that closes the feud between Ray's wife and mother, by using a cult Robert and his nebbish cousin (Fred Stoller) join.  Watch Sherri Shepard's performance in this episode.  A brilliant episode where Ray gives Robert a sizeable chunk of money to help him during tough times, but when Robert uses it to book a Vegas vacation, a fracas flares up.  Robert, in another episode has a one-time date with a woman with a frog obsession, Ray finds out that not everybody loves Raymond in another classic episode, and the outstanding ""Baggage"" episode is in this box set; notable for Marie's anecdote about the ""big fork and spoon"", which everybody says a few too many times.  Watch for the scene when Ray and Debra fight over being the one to move the suitcase, that had been left on the landing for weeks; creating what Frank called a Mexican standoff.  Best of all, is the story arc of Robert and Amy's wedding.  My favorite episode in this arc is ""The Plan"", where Ray cons Robert into purposefully screwing up the wedding invitations and sends them out by mistake.  The ballistic reaction from all the women is comic gold.  (Amy:  I could'nt read anymore because someone was screaming, and I realized IT WAS ME!!!!) or (Amy: 'N' Pat?, 'N' Pat???

These include ""Homework"" where Ray thinks Ally is getting too much homework and delivers a speech to the school board, and ""The Plan"" where the three men deliberately produce lousy invitations for Robert and Amy's wedding to get Robert out of having to do any work for the wedding.",4,Another funny season,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,622,"['someone', 'who', 'sitcoms', '70', '80', 'were', 'making', 'having', 'resort', 'simply', 'being', 'crude', 'one', 'few', 'recent', 'sitcoms', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Season', '7', 'episodes', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'always', 'nice', 'end', 'long', 'stressful', 'days', 'include', 'Homework', 'where', 'Ray', 'Ally', 'getting', 'too', 'much', 'homework', 'speech', 'school', 'board', 'Plan', 'where', 'three', 'men', 'deliberately', 'produce', 'lousy', 'invitations', 'Robert', 'Amy', 'wedding', 'get', 'Robert', 'having', 'do', 'work', 'wedding']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 7

Another classic involves the kid from hell that the twins befriend who only shows his true colors to Ray, threatening his and Deborah's friendship with the little monster's parents.  When I first saw that, I was getting so angry, my wife said the veins were popping out of my neck.  But when it ended with Marie seeing ""MARIE STINKS"" on her fridge....all I can say is that I woke my son with all the laughing I was doing for about 20 minutes afterward.I think one of the reasons I love this show so much is the fact that my wife and I are around Ray and Debra's ages and all our parents are still alive and still married to each other, a rarity.  Even though our folks are nothing like Frank and Marie, we can see some universal similarities with the situations that arise between the generations.  I think that explains the phenominal success of this series.My only grievance with the set is the cover.  This jacket does not have the most flattering mugshot of our beloved Ray Romano.

Anyone who checks the time of the two-part episode will verify this - it runs barely 31 minutes when it should run at least 40-42.
