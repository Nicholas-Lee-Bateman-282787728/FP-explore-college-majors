I always think that the next season cannot be as good as the last, but somehow the story, the characters and the plot continue to grow and evolve. Season eight was my favourite season so far. I think the running plot of the port to port killer really added an extra element to the series, especially when he seems to have focused his attention upon Gibbs. Some of my favourite episodes happen in this series and I think one of the most shocking episodes that rivals, Kate's Death, happens in this series. I cannot find enough words to say all the good things I want to say about this series. I hope that Season Nine continues in the same direction as Season Eight.

1350569,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B003L77G2E,Ben Milton,"[0, 0]","I have to agree with a previous reviewer, season one through six are incredibly strong. But starting in season seven, things kind of went alittle south. We have the season opening up with Gibbs killing Paloma and her brother, and then the season kind of meanders. One thing I did notice, when Ziva first came to NCIS, she was built up as this lean mean unstoppable killing machine. But in season eight, she becomes a U.S. citizen. And then is just there, Ziva is no longer Ziva. She's a shell of her former self, Mcgee's the same way. I'll put it this way, everybody almost looks bored in this season. And the only episode that really sparks anything, is the one with Abigale Bourne. Personally I'd like to see more episodes of her in NCIS, even the ending arc story didn't feel real thought out. The port-to-port killer story seemed way to drawn out to me, and then they tried to shove too much into it. While it was nice to see how Dinozzo got NCIS, it took away from the season ending story itself. And it felt like they didn't know how to end it, so it just ends. Hence the weak opening to season nine, E.J Barret and her team brought nothing to the story. It juuust didn't have that NCIS spark, don't get me wrong.

A midseason multi-episode segment reveals the complicated backstory of NCIS Director Leon Vance and his Israeli counterpart, while bringing Ziva face to face with her estranged father.  In the case of a missing nuke, Robert Wagner makes a priceless return appearence as Tony's father.  Veteran comedian Bob Newheart has a sobering guest role as Ducky's predecessor.  And, we find out how Tony and Gibbs first met.The highlight of the season may be the five episode story arc concerning the Port-to-Port Killer, a serial killer who preys on members of the Navy.  Director Vance brings in a competing team from Rota, Spain, headed by Special Agent E.J. Barrett, to lead the investigation.  The case will involve the CIA, some Navy secrets, and Gibbs' mentor Mike Franks, while complicating the personal lives of Ziva and Tony.  The final episode suggests the presence of an unknown traitor within the ranks of NCIS.The ""NCIS: Season Eight"" DVD set is very highly recommended to fans of NCIS.",5,New Mysteries To Solve...,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1800,"['NCIS', 'continued', 'superb', 'run', 'network', 'TV', 'top-ranked', 'drama', 'series', 'eighth', 'season', 'blessed', 'return', 'outstanding', 'core', 'cast', 'fun', 'team', 'chemistry', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lines.Mark', 'Harmon', 'crusty', 'Senior', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Leroy', 'Jethro', 'Gibbs', 'leader', 'NCIS', 'Major', 'Case', 'Response', 'Team', 'assisted', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'wise-cracking', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Tony', 'DiNozzo', 'Cote', 'de', 'Pablo', 'former', 'Mossad', 'agent/newly-minted', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Ziva', 'David', 'Sean', 'Murray', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Tim', 'McGee', 'backed', 'Pauley', 'Parrette', 'unique', 'forensic', 'tech', 'Abby', 'Sciuto', 'David', 'McCallum', 'venerable', 'medical', 'examiner', 'Ducky', 'Mallard.The', 'season', 'opener', 'resolves', 'last', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'team', 'deadly', 'confrontation', 'drug', 'cartel', 'targeting', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Gibbs', 'midseason', 'multi-episode', 'segment', 'complicated', 'backstory', 'NCIS', 'Director', 'Leon', 'Vance', 'Israeli', 'counterpart', 'bringing', 'Ziva', 'face', 'face', 'estranged', 'father', 'case', 'missing', 'nuke', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'priceless', 'return', 'appearence', 'Tony', 'father', 'Veteran', 'comedian', 'Bob', 'Newheart', 'sobering', 'guest', 'role', 'Ducky', 'predecessor', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Tony', 'Gibbs', 'first', 'met.The', 'highlight', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'five', 'episode', 'story', 'concerning', 'Port-to-Port', 'Killer', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'members', 'Navy', 'Director', 'Vance', 'competing', 'team', 'Rota', 'Spain', 'headed', 'Special', 'Agent', 'E.J', 'Barrett', 'lead', 'investigation', 'case', 'will', 'involve', 'CIA', 'Navy', 'secrets', 'Gibbs', 'mentor', 'Mike', 'Franks', 'complicating', 'personal', 'lives', 'Ziva', 'Tony', 'final', 'episode', 'presence', 'unknown', 'traitor', 'ranks', 'NCIS.The', 'NCIS', 'Season', 'Eight', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'NCIS']",N/A

Because previous seasons have been pressed on dual layer DVDs, with twice the data capacity. More data means a smoother, cleaner picture, all other things being equal. Season Eight, I imagine for reasons of cheapness and utter lack of respect for the quality-conscious video consumer, was pressed on single layer DVDs. To do this requires more filtering and data compression, which in my opinion was very poorly implemented. It all leads to a fuzzy and smeared image with pixelation problems. If you're watching these episodes on a quality monitor and you have any sense of what the image ought to look like, you will be appalled.I recorded my own Season 8 of NCIS in DVD quality (720x480) from our local digital broadcast CBS affiliate. Obviously I like the series very much. The only reason I resorted to the official box set is for subtitles for a family member who is hard of hearing. It is frustrating that the quality of the commercial product is much worse than the episodes I recorded myself.There is no excuse for this shoddy presentation. Sure, people want to see the shows, and this is the easiest way to buy them. My advice -- do not pay a high price for this set. It just sucks.

I'd catch an occasional repeat on some unnamed network and even purchased the first season though I never watched much of it. I think it was in part because I'd grown tired of the whole number of series that revolved around the forensics that began with CSI and spawned 2 spin off series of it's own as well as this one with it's own spin off. I keep waiting for a new show called CSI:RFD about a team that uses forensics to investigate barnyard animal killings.When this set arrived I decided that I'd try it out, to see what it had to offer and to discover if it was as good as my family kept trying to tell me it was. After the first few episodes I was sorry I didn't get aboard sooner. Thank goodness that boxed sets and Hulu exists for me to get the chance to catch up.The NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the primary security, counter terrorism and law enforcement agency for the United States Department of the Navy.  More than half of it's employees are civilians and they work alongside their armed forces comrades to solve crimes around the globe. But in the case of this show, its more about crimes in this country.The NCIS team in question here is led by Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), a straight laced apparently humorless leader who's drive and determination make him a formidable opponent should you decide to commit a crime on his turf. Gibb's right hand man is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) and his opposite in charm and humor. DiNozzo is fond of movie quotes and flirtatious behavior and often on the receiving end of slaps upside the head from Gibbs. Next up is Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), ex-Mossad agent and a physical presence to take down criminals. Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) is the teams computer whiz. Abbey Sciuto (Pauley Parette) is the teams forensics and scientific genius and rounding out the team is Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum), their resident doctor and coroner.This team takes on all sorts of cases but for the most part murderers. The season opens by finishing the cliff hanger from season 7 where Gibbs took on a Mexican cartel who then marked him and his family for death. Rather than face him head on, they send a team to kill his father played by Ralph Waite. You should be able to guess the results since Harmon continues with the series to this day.Other episodes in this season seemed to reveal a thread to me that might or might not have been intentional. That thread was an involvement of fathers. One episode features a story that involves DiNozzo's dad played by Robert Wagner. A two episode set revolved around Ziva's father Eli (Michael Nouri), the head of the Mossad and an attempted assassination on him while he's visiting Washington. Yet another episode involved an ex-covert agent whose granddaughter is kidnapped to try and get him to reveal himself. This idea of fathers in stories just seemed to resonate with me while watching season 8.So what makes the series so good? As with most ensemble series it's a combination of the cast and their interplay that makes it stand out. They gel well together, combining to make a family type group where they may joke and tease one another, but deep down they truly care what happens to each other. You know that every character here put into a bad situation would be willing to get the back of any of the others. And that's a comforting thought to have in a field like this.The acting is so great yet so subtle here for the most part. But even the over the top characters fit well into the entire situation displayed. Abbey may appear to simply be a Goth chick but she knows her stuff. And while DiNozzo may be a huge yet seemingly unsuccessful flirt, his charm still shines through.The stories also help by presenting us interesting tales that hold our interests from start to finish. And like most good mysteries, they give us enough clues that if we're paying attention we should be able to solve the puzzle along with the characters at about the same time.Jumping on to this series by picking up season 8 won't hinder you from enjoying it or leave you wondering where it all began. You'll catch up quickly and enjoy the show on its own. And perhaps you'll join the thousands already watching weekly and then go back to pick up previous seasons. Owning this one would just be a treat for your collection.",5,CONTINUING TO DO WHAT WORKS BEST,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4495,"['members', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'fans', 'series', 'began', 'never', 'quite', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', ""'d"", 'catch', 'occasional', 'repeat', 'unnamed', 'network', 'even', 'purchased', 'first', 'season', 'never', 'watched', 'much', 'think', 'was', 'part', ""'d"", 'grown', 'tired', 'whole', 'number', 'series', 'revolved', 'forensics', 'began', 'CSI', 'spawned', '2', 'spin', 'series', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'own', 'spin', 'keep', 'waiting', 'new', 'show', 'called', 'CSI', 'RFD', 'team', 'forensics', 'investigate', 'barnyard', 'animal', 'killings.When', 'set', 'arrived', 'decided', ""'d"", 'try', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'offer', 'discover', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'family', 'kept', 'trying', 'tell', 'was', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'aboard', 'sooner', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'boxed', 'sets', 'Hulu', 'get', 'chance', 'catch', 'up.The', 'NCIS', 'Naval', 'Criminal', 'Investigative', 'Service', 'primary', 'security', 'counter', 'terrorism', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'United', 'States', 'Department', 'Navy', 'More', 'half', 'employees', 'are', 'civilians', 'work', 'alongside', 'armed', 'forces', 'comrades', 'solve', 'crimes', 'globe', 'case', 'show', 'more', 'crimes', 'country.The', 'NCIS', 'team', 'question', 'here', 'led', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Jethro', 'Gibbs', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'straight', 'laced', 'apparently', 'humorless', 'leader', 'who', 'drive', 'determination', 'make', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'should', 'decide', 'commit', 'crime', 'turf', 'Gibb', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Anthony', 'DiNozzo', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'opposite', 'charm', 'humor', 'DiNozzo', 'fond', 'movie', 'quotes', 'flirtatious', 'behavior', 'often', 'receiving', 'end', 'slaps', 'head', 'Gibbs', 'Next', 'up', 'Ziva', 'David', 'Cote', 'de', 'Pablo', 'ex-Mossad', 'agent', 'physical', 'presence', 'take', 'down', 'criminals', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Timothy', 'McGee', 'Sean', 'Murray', 'teams', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Abbey', 'Sciuto', 'Pauley', 'Parette', 'teams', 'forensics', 'scientific', 'genius', 'rounding', 'out', 'team', 'Dr.', 'Donald', 'Ducky', 'Mallard', 'David', 'McCallum', 'resident', 'doctor', 'coroner.This', 'team', 'sorts', 'cases', 'most', 'part', 'murderers', 'season', 'finishing', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'season', '7', 'where', 'Gibbs', 'took', 'Mexican', 'cartel', 'who', 'then', 'marked', 'family', 'death', 'Rather', 'face', 'head', 'send', 'team', 'kill', 'father', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'results', 'Harmon', 'series', 'day.Other', 'season', 'seemed', 'reveal', 'thread', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'thread', 'was', 'involvement', 'fathers', 'One', 'episode', 'story', 'DiNozzo', 'dad', 'played', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'two', 'episode', 'set', 'revolved', 'Ziva', 'father', 'Eli', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'head', 'Mossad', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'visiting', 'Washington', 'episode', 'involved', 'ex-covert', 'agent', 'granddaughter', 'kidnapped', 'try', 'get', 'reveal', 'idea', 'fathers', 'stories', 'just', 'seemed', 'resonate', 'watching', 'season', '8.So', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'most', 'ensemble', 'series', 'combination', 'cast', 'interplay', 'stand', 'out', 'gel', 'well', 'together', 'combining', 'make', 'family', 'type', 'group', 'where', 'may', 'joke', 'tease', 'one', 'deep', 'truly', 'care', 'what', 'other', 'know', 'character', 'here', 'put', 'bad', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'get', 'back', 'others', 'comforting', 'thought', 'have', 'field', 'this.The', 'acting', 'so', 'great', 'yet', 'so', 'subtle', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'top', 'characters', 'fit', 'well', 'entire', 'situation', 'displayed', 'Abbey', 'may', 'appear', 'simply', 'be', 'Goth', 'chick', 'stuff', 'DiNozzo', 'may', 'be', 'huge', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'unsuccessful', 'flirt', 'charm', 'still', 'through.The', 'stories', 'also', 'help', 'presenting', 'interesting', 'tales', 'hold', 'interests', 'start', 'finish', 'most', 'good', 'mysteries', 'give', 'enough', 'clues', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'characters', 'same', 'time.Jumping', 'series', 'picking', 'up', 'season', '8', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'enjoying', 'leave', 'wondering', 'where', 'began', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'up', 'quickly', 'enjoy', 'show', 'own', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'join', 'thousands', 'already', 'watching', 'weekly', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'pick', 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Owning', 'one', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'treat', 'collection']",N/A

1350640,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B003L77G2E,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[0, 1]","The best quality of NCIS has always been its ability to retain a narrative specific to a season.  Shane Brennan has retained Don Bellisario's quality of creating a storyline for the season, going away from the storyline, but going back and letting the storyline heat back up in the second part of the season.  Such is the case with Season 8.  In this case, the story doesn't focus on any particular member of the MTAC but rather the relationships NCIS carries with Intelligence organizations, both domestic and foreign; as well as the relationships with their extended family of revolving characters--the Gibbs/Fornell relationship, Jethro and Abagail Borin (The CGIS Investigator)--as well as new characters either needing reminding of the good they did or looking for resolution to dearly departed members of the MTAC.I won't rehash the performance of the regulars, simply because Mark, Michael, Cote, Pauley, Sean, Rocky, David, and Brian NEVER TAKE A SHOW OFF.  There are never any phoned-in performances here.  Because the regulars always bring their best, the recurring characters and the guest shots don't phone it in.  Joe Spano's Tobias Fornell never seems less than stellar, and over the course of the series the banter between Fornell and Gibbs has become less agency-adversarial and much more family-like (After all, they do share an ex-wife...).  Diane Neal's Borin--introduced in Season 7--continues to play out humorously as a ""female Gibbs""--in short, there will be no romantic connection between Jethro and Abagail because they're too much alike.  It's always good to see Ralph Waite as Gibbs' father, Jackson--though we only get him in the season opener--and Robert Wagner's Anthony DiNozzo the Elder is becoming a treasure when he shows.  I'd like to talk about Muse Watson here...but he deserves his own paragraph.We know how Season 8 starts--the completion of the Hernandez/Reynosa/Rivera storyline from last season; Jethro's revenge murder of Paloma Reynosa's father--the starting point of Gibbs joining NCIS--and Reynosa's attempt to avenge her father's death along with her brother, the corrupt Mexican police official Alejandro Rivera.  Loved Jacqueline Obradors and Marco Sanchez as the brother and sister, figuring that they were intimidating and outsmarting NCIS...all the way up to the climax of that episode.  As always, the season opener left a clue as to the path of the season because the children of Pablo Hernandez thought they had Gibbs fooled and controlled...and much to their dismay, they found out they didn't.After the opener, the first part of the season starts the examination of how NCIS relates to other agencies with ""Short Fuse"" and ""Royals And Loyals"".  Continuing a trend this series has shown the last few years, NCIS casts featured players from recently cancelled CBS series for guest slots--""Short Fuse"" brings Abby Brammell from ""The Unit"" in as a tough Marine EOD expert having an affair with an FBI Director, and the complications that arise for Gibbs and Fornell in investigating a shooting at the EOD expert's house--with the FBI Director there.  ""Royals And Loyals"" brings Daniel Gilles in as a British Royal Marine with a lot below the surface, an episode which begins the look at NCIS' work with the Intel sections.  Wagner is brilliant in ""Broken Arrow"", flirting with Ziva (Making Tony uncomfortable in the process--Weatherly is every bit R.J.'s equal here), but also calling up a little bit of Alexander Mundy in the end of the episode.This brings us to the ""Enemies Foreign/Enemies Domestic"" two-parter.  This is the crux of the season, the jumping-off point to the second-half; and two episodes which uniquely tie together many parts of the NCIS history.  Michael Nouri returns as Ziva's father, the Mossad Director Eli David; Arnold Vosloo comes back as Amit Hadar, and T. J Ramini returns as Malachi Ben-Gedon, the Mossad agent who left Ziva out to dry in her ""Aliyah"".  The core of this story--Eli's appearance in Washington, and the discussion of a botched mission in Amsterdam in the early 1990s; how this assignment brought Vance to the attention of NCIS, how Vance met Eli for the first time, and the direction NCIS took in time; plus that the Amsterdam failure led to Gibbs working with Jenny Sheppard and completing the mission--was unique, never felt forced.  Michael O'Neill--another alumni from ""The Unit""--has a key role as former NCIS agent.  This two-parter was great in terms of story, and is also highly noted because of the makeup work--both Rocky Carroll and Michael Nouri were made to look twenty years younger in ""Enemies Domestic"".Among the one-shots in the back end of the season is ""Recruited"", a parallel storyline of the investigation of the murder of a gay Navy recruiter with an introduction to Ducky Mallard's predecessor as NCIS Medical Examiner, Walter Magnus.  Bob Newhart is brilliant as Magnus, who has become frustrated that Alzheimer's is taking away the memories of the good that he did.  The other one-shot of note is the brilliant ""A Man Walks Into A Bar...""  Wendy Makkena is introduced as Dr. Rachel Cranston, tasked with doing a psychological evaluation of Gibbs' team--and also bringing up the memory of a lost friend to the team.  This is a jewel of an episode that gives the viewer a character in Cranston that we won't mind having visit again.The core story of the second half of the season is the ""Port-To-Port Killer"" storyline--not just the mystery of why and who he is, but his specific connection to the CIA, the Secretary of The Navy...and to Leon Vance.  Of course, the complication here is that Gibbs' team ISN'T the lead team investigating this case--bringing up the issue that started this season, many believing that Gibbs is out of the loop or can be overmatched; only to find out that Jethro has more on the ball than realized.  Of course, anyone who has followed this series knows that once Trent Kort shows up, a situation is really much more complicated than believed since the slightly uncontrollable Company operative is involved.  David Dayan Fisher returns, and brings the ominous nastiness of Kort back with him.  Sarah Jane Morris' E.J. Barrett--the Special Agent in charge of the Rota, Spain NCIS Field Office (The position DiNozzo turned down in Season 4)--brings her team over in the hunt for ""P2P""--including Alimi Ballard (Recently of ""NUMB3RS"", and following Dylan Bruno's guest shots from Season 7), and the MTAC is forced into a back-seat position...all the more complicated by E.J. starting a relationship with Tony.  Plus, Ziva's current boyfriend is revealed to be Ray Cruz (Enrique Murciano from ""Without A Trace""), a CIA operative who knows more about ""P2P"" than he's letting on...as well as knowing E.J. Special in this arc is ""Baltimore""--an episode which could also be called ""When Jethro Met Tony"", since it details the first time Gibbs and DiNozzo met.  Unique to this episode is a cameo from Tim Kelleher, reprising Special Agent Christopher Pacci; and speaking a line that chillingly portends Pacci's future.  This is a brutal, punch-in-the-mouth storyline; maybe the series' most violent arc since the Ari Haswari episodes.Which brings us to Muse Watson.  It was unusual--and somewhat telling--that we didn't get the two-to-three Mike Franks stories in this season.  But there were clues--that Mike was beat to the draw in ""The Spider And The Fly"" (Mike NEVER got beat in a shootout situation previously), and his impatience in that episode is telling.  ""Swan Song"" and ""Pyramid"" give us the sad end to a great character--of course, that we didn't realize that Watson had Mike in ""ghost"" mode until late in ""Swan Song""...which gives us who were huge fans of that character hope that Mike might come back in Gibbs' mind at various points.  If he doesn't...thank you, Muse.  We will miss Mike's ""Shoot First, Ask Questions, Then Shoot Again"" nature.Obviously, ""Pyramid"" wraps up the ""P2P"" story...and opens up the story for Season 9.  Kerr Smith's turn as Jonas Cobb, the Bourne-like operative (Created due to a white paper that Vance wrote while at the Naval War College...where NCIS recruited him in ""Enemies Domestic"") that the Company (Specifically, Kort) has lost control of and has a personal vendetta against Jude Ciccolella's Phillip Davenport--the SecNav--manifesting through Cobb's atacks against E.J. (Davenport's niece, as it turned out) and her team...leading to Davenport's resignation and replacement by Matt Craven's Clayton Jarvis--and Jarvis opening up with an assignment specifically requiring DiNozzo...gets the ball rolling to the next season.All in all--a telling storyline in the season; revealing Vance's personal ties to the Intelligence community, Ziva's latest boyfriend having ""ties"", McGee's continuing Abby issues...and how many who consider themselves superior to him continually underestimate Leroy Jethro Gibbs--at least until they need him.Highly recommended set.",5,NCIS Season 8--Intelligence And Relationships...and Ghosts...,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,8949,"['best', 'quality', 'NCIS', 'always', 'been', 'ability', 'retain', 'narrative', 'specific',

The episodes were authored onto the DVD in low resolution.  That means that on a big screen the images are VERY BLURRY with serious JPEG artifacts.  I would love to give this back to the company that made it and request a better DVD set.  This is not a problem with one episode or just one disk; this is a problem on every episode and every disk in this series season.  I would have given this product 1 star if it wasn't a TV series I love.[I added the following subsequent to my original review.]I contacted Paramount Home Entertainment and submitted a claim that the product was inferior.  After a few weeks, I found a new NCIS:S8 in the mail.  This one was authored in the proper resolution for DVDs.  Long story short, they fixed it.The UPC on the good NCIS:S8 and the bad NCIS:S8 are identical, but packaging is different.  The bad one is in paper cardboard case with 3 small plastic DVD covers containing all the disks.  The good one has a plastic case that houses all the disks in a smaller unit, about the size of a standard DVD movie case.",2,Unacceptable DVD Authoring,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1146,"['enjoy', 'NCIS', 'quite', 'bit', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'series', 'However', 'product', 'piece', 'crap', 'episodes', 'were', 'authored', 'DVD', 'low', 'resolution', 'big', 'screen', 'images', 'are', 'VERY', 'BLURRY', 'serious', 'JPEG', 'artifacts', 'would', 'love', 'give', 'back', 'company', 'made', 'request', 'better', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'problem', 'one', 'episode', 'just', 'one', 'disk', 'problem', 'episode', 'disk', 'series', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'product', '1', 'star', 'was', ""n't"", 'TV', 'series', 'love', '[', 'added', 'following', 'subsequent', 'original', 'review', ']', 'contacted', 'Paramount', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'submitted', 'claim', 'product', 'was', 'inferior', 'few', 'weeks', 'found', 'new', 'NCIS', 'S8', 'mail', 'one', 'was', 'authored', 'proper', 'resolution', 'DVDs', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'fixed', 'it.The', 'UPC', 'good', 'NCIS', 'S8', 'bad', 'NCIS', 'S8', 'are', 'identical', 'packaging', 'different', 'bad', 'one', 'paper', 'cardboard', 'case', '3', 'small', 'plastic', 'DVD', 'containing', 'disks', 'good', 'one', 'plastic', 'case', 'houses', 'disks', 'smaller', 'unit', 'size', 'standard', 'DVD', 'movie', 'case']",N/A
