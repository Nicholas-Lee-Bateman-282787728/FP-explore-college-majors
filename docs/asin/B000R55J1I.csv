Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[4, 4]","This tense French thriller kept me riveted.Alex, a doctor, suffers a terrible tragedy when his wife is murdered at a lake where they had been skinny-dipping at twilight. Alex himself was beaten unconscious and the crime was attributed to a known serial killer.Now, eight years later, Alex receives a mysterious email suggesting his wife, Margot, is alive after all. And the police have dug up two bodies on his property suggesting they got the wrong man for the murder. They reopen their investigation -- with Alex as the prime suspect.To say too much more would be to give away a tightly-constructed plot that twists and turns unexpectedly, continually keeping the viewer off guard.One highlight is a superb chase scene -- but instead of the usual highspeed auto chase, this one takes place on foot.The movie succeeds in painting a hero who is compassionate and sane and irretrievably wounded by the loss of his wife, whom we see was also his childhood sweetheart and the love of his life. Once he gets wind that she may be alive, he's not going to be deterred by anyone or anything in finding her.We also meet some truly creepy villains.Highly recommended.",5,A taut thriller,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,1158,"['tense', 'French', 'thriller', 'kept', 'riveted.Alex', 'doctor', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'when', 'wife', 'murdered', 'lake', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'skinny-dipping', 'twilight', 'Alex', 'was', 'beaten', 'unconscious', 'crime', 'was', 'attributed', 'known', 'serial', 'killer.Now', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Alex', 'mysterious', 'email', 'suggesting', 'wife', 'Margot', 'alive', 'police', 'have', 'dug', 'up', 'two', 'bodies', 'property', 'suggesting', 'got', 'wrong', 'man', 'murder', 'reopen', 'investigation', 'Alex', 'prime', 'suspect.To', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'tightly-constructed', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'unexpectedly', 'continually', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'guard.One', 'highlight', 'superb', 'chase', 'scene', 'instead', 'usual', 'highspeed', 'auto', 'chase', 'one', 'place', 'foot.The', 'movie', 'painting', 'hero', 'who', 'compassionate', 'sane', 'irretrievably', 'wounded', 'loss', 'wife', 'whom', 'see', 'was', 'also', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'love', 'life', 'Once', 'wind', 'may', 'be', 'alive', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'deterred', 'anyone', 'anything', 'finding', 'her.We', 'also', 'meet', 'truly', 'creepy', 'villains.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1079073,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000R55J1I,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","""Tell No One"" is a very impressive adaptation by screenwriter/director Guillaume Canet of a Harlan Coben novel.  The film was so successful that Miramax and Focus films have bought the English language rights and plan a re-make (target release date: 2010).  Do yourself a favor and see Canet's version.  It's doubtful it can be topped.The movie's plot is airtight.  Its suspense percolates slowly.  Its care with the detail demands your full attention.  Do so and you'll be rewarded in the end.  Canet's direction is masterful.  He's more than just a pretty face.Canet is better known as one of France's leading actors.  Fans of French cinema will recall him opposite Marion Cotillard in the dark (like in pitch black) comedy,Love Me If You Dare.  He appears briefly here under his own direction as Philippe Neuville, a character short on screen time, but not inconsequential to the plot's developments.I've not seen any work by Franois Cluzet before, even though - yes - he's got the pedigree of being a major star.  But - with the exception of a couple of small roles in the mid-nineties in things like Altman'sReady to Wear- Cluzet has worked almost exclusively in French cinema.  His character's integrity carries the movie.  Many accusations are cast his way during the course of the film.  As an audience member, I believed in his honesty and decency.  I believed his version of the events to be the truth.Personal favorite Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze plays Cluzet's wife, Margot. Like countless others, I was taken with this excellent actress after her head-turning appearance inThe Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions Barbares).

A man and wife are having a late night swim at a lake, they briely quarrel and she swims to shore ahead of him, and shortly after both are assaulted and the wife murdered.  It is 8 years after we witness these events and the husband, a doctor, still grieving for the lost wife he has known since childhood, gets a hint that she somehow, incredibly,  might be alive.With the discovery of some buried bodies near the lake, however, suspicion has now fallen on the husband as being the orchestrator of his wife's murder.  This, as in Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, North By Northwest, the Saboteur et al, is just the prelude that sets the clock, for we are off  with our protaganist on-the-run, beset by malevolent and murderous strangers and dogged cops, following one false lead after another, as red herrings weave in and out of the story.Well done in all departments, this French import keeps all the plates spinning in the air adroitly, and when all the bogus trails finally converge and we learn the answer to the mystery, it works as a very gratifying conclusion to all that has lead to it.

Tell No One, even without the quotes, is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long, long time.Alexander Beck and his wife, Margot, both much in love, have gone for a bit of evening skinny-dipping in the country. There's a minor disagreement and she dives back in from the float and heads to the shore. He hears her cry out and swims as swiftly as he can after her. When he reaches the small dock and starts to pull himself out, he's met by a baseball bat. While he's in a coma for three days his wife is found dead with severe bruising and cuts, the marks of a known serial killer. But who pulled Beck out of the water? Who called for emergency medical help?Eight years later Dr. Alex Beck, a pediatrician, is told by the police that the remains of two unidentified male bodies have been found in the vicinity of where his wife was murdered. Then he receives an e-mail on his computer. The attachment shows a woman leaving a crowded exit. She pauses and looks at the security camera. The picture is fuzzy. The scene ends. Beck has never remarried and still is haunted by the memory of his wife. He is almost sure this woman is she. The message in the e-mail says, ""Tell no one. They're watching.""The director and co-screenwriter Guillaume Canet has taken the novel by Harlan Coben and, working with Coben, has fashioned a film at least as good as the novel. The film has been crafted with care. You'd best pay attention to every moment. Irrelevant items turn out to be relevant. Assumptions based on how a scene opens turn out often to be not what they seem, but just as reasonable. Canet (and Coben) don't shy away from violence -- there is a memorable woman you don't ever want to displease -- but the violence isn't just for gee whiz show biz purposes. When violence happens, it reminds us to stay alert. Canet takes us all over the place, from Paris slums to society horse events. He has Beck dancing across a highway filled with speeding cars and then hiding out in a dumpster sharing space with garbage and a large rat. The story is just as complicated as Coben's novel (as all his novels are), but -- if you've been paying attention -- all becomes clear. If the cops are after Beck because they think he may have had something to do with his wife's death, it also may be true that others are after him because they think she might be alive. But why?Helping immeasurably with the interest and speed of the film are the actors. Francois Cluzet plays Dr. Beck, a capable, resourceful man, but no buff Hollywood hero. Cluzet is not an especially handsome lead actor, and that's all to the good. Surrounding him are such fine French actors as Andre Dussollier as his wife's father, a grieving retired senior cop; Francois Berleand as a sympathetic and smart police officer; Nathalie Baye as a lawyer who knows how to deal with district attorneys; and a fine Jean Rochefort, as well as Kristin Scott Thomas speaking impeccable French as his best friend, a wealthy woman having an affair with his equestrienne sister.Tell No One is an excellent movie. And I hope you'll pick up of a few of Harlan Coben's mysteries while you're at it. He started out with several books featuring Myron Bolitar (whose best friend, Win Lockwood, is not a person to irritate). Try the first one first,Deal Breaker (Myron Bolitar Mysteries). Coben lately has moved into darker themes, such asTell No One. His latest isThe Woods. Coben knows how to create intricate but logical plots and strong characters. He's a first-class writer. His books are much better than the usual thriller-every-year bestseller that some authors churn out regularly.",5,"One of the finest thrillers on film, from an equally fine book.

1079085,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B000R55J1I,C.Wallace,"[1, 2]","This is a great French film. It's about an Everyman, Dr. Alexandre Beck(Francois Cluzet), a pediatrician, whose wife, Margot (Marie-Josee Croze) was brutally murdered. Eight years after Margot's murder, Beck receives an e-mail, apparently from his wife! At almost the same time, the bodies of two men are uncovered near the site of Margot's presumed death along with evidence incriminating Beck. Beck then engages in an epic struggle to prove his innocence in the face of police detectives who have long suspected him even though substantial evidence pointed to a convicted serial killer, and Beck was never charged.Before the earth-shaking e-mail, Beck had been grieving the loss of his wife, often recalling their loving relationship, which went back to their childhoods, when they were close friends. The movie focuses on Beck's desperate attempt to find out if his wife is indeed still alive and also prove his innocence, for it appears that there are those other than the police who have an interest in the case. These others, brutal people with substantial resources, want to insure that Margot does not...resurface, so to speak.I particularly enjoyed the mad dash of Beck through the streets and alleys of Paris and across a busy eight-lane freeway as he eludes a squadron of police. Also fascinating was the help provided by a gangster whom Beck had befriended. Beck had once proven that the gangster's young son's bruises were caused by hemophilia and not by his loving father.The suspense is intense. The acting is powerful. Cluzet's Beck reminded me a lot of Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man.

Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Two hours and 5 minutes, is a long time to draw out this &#34;mystery.&#34; This film meanders around, running time backward and forward, replaying scenes, subtracting and adding details, until the audience is finally shown the whole story. I love French film, I love mysteries, I love the odd chase scene, and I really love mixed up time lines, unfortunately this film mostly strikes out on most accounts.Dr. Alex Beck and his wife Margot drive out to a country house on the lake. We realize this is a childhood romance that has continued to blossom, and that they both love eachother deeply. Margot is murdered and Alex is knocked out trying to save her. This is all revealed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Then the director fast forwards to eight years later. From here the film just wanders all over the place with Alex trying to figure out who done it?No spoliers here. The plot seems obvious for about an hour. Then it gets complicated. Then it goes simple. The mystery sort of comes and goes, is the wife still alive or not. Then in roughly the last 15 minutes, the mystery is solved, then refuted and resolved. It just wasn't interesting the fourth solving time around.The acting is not that great. Francois Cluzet is robotic throughout the film (well at least he was consistent) looking a bit like Dustin Hoffman. Franois Berl&eacute;and plays the likeable police inspector, who is actually intelligent and soft spoken here compared to his idiot / savant role in the Transporter series. The rest of the cast, aside from Bruno, look like they are just phoning in the performances.Visually, the film was reasonably well done. There were some very poor handheld camera moments. Bad because they were butted up to solid vibration free filming. The huge accident / pile up on the peripherique was well done, actually scary. The chase scenes on foot were well edited. Although the police cars kept showing up at the last second, and then Alex could out run the cars.A mystery, thriller, who done it, has to have all the details perfect, if it is to succeed. The viewer is trying very hard to solve the mystery, and details help point to the solution. This film just bombed with the details, things just were not right a lot of the time.There is no second viewing possible with this film. Once it's been seen, that's it. Knowing the surprise ending, ruins the whole film. No, what may have been said in other reviews is simply wrong, there is no replay value here.In French with English subtitles (can be turned off). Translation is not great, it's just passable. The film would be rated R, there's a bit of full frontal male and female nudity. The murder victim is shown in pretty graphic detail - nothing too much worse than CSI or Law And Order. So anyone that doesn't mind about 2 or 3 minutes of nudity, and CSI kind of violence, this film will work.The DVD includes deleted scenes and outtakes. After watching the first three deleted scenes and seeing no difference between what was in the film and these scenes, I stopped watching. Outtakes was equally bad, basic laugh because I can't say my line type outtakes.The film is long, the mystery not that intriguing, the acting cardboard, and it's a formula that is tired (the Columbo replaying the murder over and over again until it's solved).",2,Too Long,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,3306,"['Two', 'hours', '5', 'minutes', 'long', 'time', 'draw', 'out', '34', 'mystery.', '34', 'film', 'meanders', 'running', 'time', 'backward', 'forward', 'replaying', 'scenes', 'subtracting', 'adding', 'details', 'audience', 'finally', 'shown', 'whole', 'story', 'love', 'French', 'film', 'love', 'mysteries', 'love', 'odd', 'chase', 'scene', 'really', 'love', 'mixed', 'time', 'lines', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'mostly', 'out', 'most', 'accounts.Dr', 'Alex', 'Beck', 'wife', 'Margot', 'drive', 'out', 'country', 'house', 'lake', 'realize', 'childhood', 'romance', 'continued', 'blossom', 'love', 'eachother', 'deeply', 'Margot', 'murdered', 'Alex', 'knocked', 'out', 'trying', 'save', 'revealed', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'Then', 'director', 'fast', 'forwards', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'here', 'film', 'just', 'wanders', 'place', 'Alex', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'done', 'No', 'spoliers', 'here', 'plot', 'obvious', 'hour', 'Then', 'complicated', 'Then', 'simple', 'mystery', 'sort', 'wife', 'still', 'alive', 'not', 'Then', 'roughly', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'mystery', 'solved', 'then', 'refuted', 'resolved', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'fourth', 'solving', 'time', 'around.The', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'Francois', 'Cluzet', 'robotic', 'film', 'well', 'least', 'was', 'consistent', 'looking', 'bit', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Franois', 'Berl', 'eacute', 'likeable', 'police', 'inspector', 'who', 'actually', 'intelligent', 'soft', 'spoken', 'here', 'compared', 'idiot', '/', 'savant', 'role', 'Transporter', 'series', 'rest', 'cast', 'aside', 'Bruno', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'phoning', 'performances.Visually', 'film', 'was', 'reasonably', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'very', 'poor', 'handheld', 'camera', 'moments', 'Bad', 'were', 'butted', 'up', 'solid', 'vibration', 'free', 'filming', 'huge', 'accident', '/', 'pile', 'up', 'peripherique', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'actually', 'scary', 'chase', 'scenes', 'foot', 'were', 'well', 'edited', 'police', 'cars', 'kept', 'showing', 'up', 'last', 'second', 'then', 'Alex', 'could', 'out', 'run', 'cars.A', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'who', 'done', 'have', 'details', 'perfect', 'succeed', 'viewer', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'solve', 'mystery', 'details', 'help', 'point', 'solution', 'film', 'just', 'bombed', 'details', 'things', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'right', 'lot', 'second', 'viewing', 'possible', 'film', 'been', 'seen', 'Knowing', 'surprise', 'ending', 'whole', 'film', 'No', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'simply', 'wrong', 'replay', 'value', 'here.In', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'Translation', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'passable', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'bit', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'murder', 'victim', 'shown', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'detail', 'nothing', 'too', 'much', 'worse', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'mind', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'nudity', 'CSI', 'kind', 'violence', 'film', 'will', 'work.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'watching', 'first', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'seeing', 'difference', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'scenes', 'stopped', 'watching', 'Outtakes', 'was', 'equally', 'bad', 'basic', 'laugh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'line', 'outtakes.The', 'film', 'long', 'mystery', 'not', 'intriguing', 'acting', 'cardboard', 'formula', 'tired', 'Columbo', 'replaying', 'murder', 'over', 'again', 'solved']",N/A

The plot involves a man whose wife was declared dead after a mysterious attack and abduction, who finds himself a suspect eight years later, when two more bodies are found near the same remote rural location as the original murder. In classic Hitchcock-ian fashion, this well-to-do professional soon finds himself on the lam, chased by almost the entire police department of Marseilles, and able to find protection only by trusting some surprisingly affable members of the city's criminal underworld.

Dr. Beck, Francois Cluzet (think French Dustin Hoffman) is swimming, with his wife, on their private lake one night. Wifey swims to shore and begins screaming. Doc swims to shore and is knocked cold. Wife is found dead and eight years later the whole story opens again but grave questions of the entire case, and doc is the prime suspect.This is very Hitchcockian in that an innocent man is thrust into a situation that makes him look really guilty. The evidence builds to the point where you wonder if he'll ever claw his way out. This is very cleverly written in that regard. The viewer is given the set up early on but all these odd things keep happening that make the doctor look worse and worse. You see the police in on the investigation but then some others, unknown, enter into things and you're really scratching your head. Who are these people?One nice note is that there is one detective with OCD who questions the doctor's guilt and becomes somewhat of a confederate within the police ranks.At two hours twenty one, the director was in no hurry to finish this off. I did think this could have used some script editing in that regard. But it's shot well, cut well and has a nifty (very american bluesy) music score. The actors all do a stand-up job. I also could have used a better punchline. For all the twists, turns and emotional hand-wringing, the source of all this misery could have been more severe.

1079097,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000R55J1I,Galina,"[5, 6]","I should thank Roger Ebert for the pleasure of discovering and watching Tell no One. I was reading his review about another European thriller/mystery, the Danish film Just Another Love Story, and Ebert mentioned the French film Tell No One directed by Guillaume Canet and adapted from International bestselling novel by Harlan Coben, as an example of how a thriller should be made.  Two hours long, the Fugitive: French style is everything I look for in a thriller/mystery/crime/drama/love story. Yes, it is a thriller filled with twists, turns, surprises, chases, darkest hidden secrets all the way but now after it is over, I realize that it is in the equal part, the story of love, one of the most beautiful love stories told on screen and also few, not just one, stories of fatherly love and what is it capable of.The strength of the film is in letting the viewers identify with the main character, pediatrician Alexandre Beck (Francois Cluzet who is a spitting image of Dustin Hoffman in his early 40s). From the first episode, we see that he is a good, decent man who tragically lost his beloved wife Margot, but never stopped to love and to miss her. We also learn that he is a dedicated doctor whom his young patients and his parents trust completely. When Alex finds himself as a suspect in the re-open investigation of his wife's murder and the target of the band of the dangerous criminals, and on the top of all he receives the series of e-mail that indicate that his wife may not be dead, we are already totally involved in his predicament and wish him to find out the truth and to survive. And be happy again.I found the film simply great. It does not surprise me that this French gem received over 90% positive reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and it has made several ten top critics lists. Based on the novel by the same title from Harlan Coben, the film is a non-stop wild ride for all two hours it plays. Moving the plot to France, to the dreamy and deadly country side and to the mean streets of Paris, provides the perfect setting for this story and gave the film this uniquely French look and feel that I personally enjoy very much.The elements of the plot left some questions unanswered and I am still puzzled about some of them but the movie is so good that I am more than willing to forget about unsolved puzzles. Clever, harrowing, gripping, not rushing but getting exactly where it heads, the film has the most satisfying bitter sweet happy ending I've seen in a long time. I most likely would have hated this ending in a lesser movie but Tell No One deserves and owns romantic and beautiful final act. Besides, the book's author was quoted in an interview that the movie's ending was better than his original ending. I am not the one to argue with him.The cast is first class and includes Canadian Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze whom we remember from The Barbarian Invasions (2003), English born but living in France for the major part of her life, Kristine Scott Thomas; Francois Cluzet, the winner of Cesar for Best Actor for the role of Dr. Beck; Andre Dissolier, nominated for Best supporting Cesar playing Margot's father;  Acting legends Nathalie Baye and one of my favorite actors since the day of youth, Jean Rochefort, and the director/writer Guillaume Canet himself in a small but important role of Philippe Neuville.

I will admit that I was not a big fan of the book to begin with, I found the story to be somewhat contrived and all of the characters to be either sickeningly good or so bad that you're happy when they die. The movie of ""Tell No One"" fixes some of the problems that I had with the book, specifically, the characters are more three-dimensional in the movie. However, in the process it manages to create more problems.In spite of the fact that I have read many reviews that say what a brilliant movie this is (one reviewer described it as the ""best French film ever""), I personally had to struggle to stay awake for its duration, and my father, who watched it with me, fell asleep. To me, this was one of the dullest movies that I have seen in a long time. Although there are some action scenes, they are few and far between and padded out by a lot of scenes of dull, emotionless people just standing around and talking, none of whom really had much of interest to say. The film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel, so if you did like the novel, this might appeal to you. However, the ending is simplified, resulting in a number of loose ends not being properly tied off and a number of events not being properly explained.

We are not only kept in the dark, but led along many misleading paths as to who killed who and what really happened in the first place!

Based on Harlan Coben's novel and adapted for the screen and directed by Guillaume Canet, this is one of those intricately complex French films that is much in the same mode as the 1955 film LES DIABOLIQUE.  Nothing is as it appears at first and even when the mystery is explained in what appears to be a systematic, cohesive manner, the 'real story' remains a conundrum.  It is a brilliant little film well worth multiple viewings to fully appreciate all of the aspects of the fine acting, cinematography, direction and musical scoring.In a misty opening we discover Alexandre Beck (Franois Cluzet) and his beautiful wife Margot (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze) only to abruptly be drawn into the murder of Margot and the beating of Alexandre.  The incidents are shrouded in mystery and remain so for eight years when suddenly the now pediatrician Alexandre receives an email from the 'deceased' Margot.  Alexandre's world is topsy turvy and he begins to share the strange incident with his family - his sister Anne (Marina Hines) and her lover H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (a radiant Kristin Scott Thomas), his father, Margot's family...and the police who begin to discover evidence that implicates Alexandre as the perpetrator. Alexandre's lawyer (Nathalie Baye) pits evidence against the police investigators while Alexandre's chief ally in his run from the accusers is Bruno (Gilles Lellouche), the father of a hemophiliac patient whom Alexandre has treated and befriended. The chase is on and the clues become increasingly puzzling until at last the truth of the now eight year old murder and all of the implications of that event unfold.If there are seemingly holes in the story it is because we, the audience, are never quite sure about the twists and turns of the plot.  The acting is superb from this cast of some of France's finest artists, and one of the best performances in the film comes from British actress Kristin Scott Thomas, reminding us that she is one of the most talented and beautiful actors on the screen today!  This is a tough little film to follow, but the quality of both the story and the production is first rate. Highly Recommended.

The main character, Dr. Beck, is an incredibly sympathetic guy (played wonderfully by Francois Cluzet) and I really felt his sadness and terror and shock as he worked to unravel the mystery of who killed his beloved wife. There were good plot twists, scary villains, great chase scenes, and a variety of good roles for women, which is always welcome. Some viewers have complained of plot holes and lack of characterization; it all seemed pretty clear and compelling to me. If necessary, a simple rewinding to the climactic scenes should help everyone get all the details down.All in all, I thought ""Tell No One"" was stylishly done and a very satisfying entertainment.

This French (with English subtitles) movie is still in first-run houses, the release date for the DVD hasn't been announced. The director, Guillaume Canet, has been around for awhile, but I am not familiar with him or his work.On the other hand, Francois Cluzet (&#34;French Kiss&#34; and &#34;Ready to Wear&#34;), the wonderful actor who portrays a busy pediatrician, is a more familiar face, as is Kristin Scott Thomas (&#34;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&#34; &#34;The Horse Whisperer,&#34; and &#34;The English Patient&#34;) who has a principal role -- and speaks French fluently, as she is married to a Frenchman and lives there.Our story begins with the pediatrician and his much-loved wife on an outing at a lakeside cabin. After skinny dipping with him one night, she climbs out to go to their cabin, while he prepares to follow. She cries for help from the underbrush and he is brutally whacked on the head with a baseball bat. After three days in a coma, he awakens to discover that her corpse has been found, the victim of a serial killer.Eight years later, still single, he is quietly involved in his medical practice when he receives a mysterious e-mail advising him to &#34;tell no one&#34; about the attached video clip which is a film of a woman who appears to be his long-dead wife. Naturally he is vitally concerned and step by step we watch him become more and more deeply embroiled in a tangled web of lies, deception and violence.This film has NO wasted dialogue, NO unnecessary scenes, NO careless editing. It is exciting, involving and leaves no questions unanswered. It sweeps us along as our man, still in love with his long-deceased wife, tries with dogged determination and uncommon intelligence to untangle an eight-year-old (closed) murder case. His task is complicated by a Colombo-like police detective, played by Francois Berleand (&#34;The Transporter&#34; and &#34;The Chorus&#34;), who reopens the case and is convinced that our hero is somehow implicated.There are a number of plot twists but each makes sense and is consistent with the character of the person doing the twisting. There are a number of beautifully staged chase and street scenes that are brilliantly executed, along with high caliber acting every single minute. Cluzet's pediatrician is a person you WILL root for and this satisfying movie is one you will remember for a long time.I will watch for other movies by this director!

I may forget the title, but I seldom forget a film as good as, TELL NO ONE.The music selections are quite interesting, often not what I would have chosen, but perfect in so many instances.  The photography is beautiful but some times the cuts didn't make sense to me -- jarring, inappropriate for the emotion, or leading me to think something was edited out.  Camera movements flowed well for the most part with some intriguing approaches.  Audio editing was done well, with a couple instances which were actually a part of the plot.  I have no criticism of the acting and found the casting to be right on, particularly with the female thug who scares me to this day.  I get queasy and flinch when thinking about her scenes and don't recall her speaking a single word.The plot.  Well, the plot is layered and not very predictable at all, but this film lost one star from me for not having all the layers fused.  I watched the deleted scenes and outtakes but still found sections where maybe a train couldn't drive through, but a little vehicle could pass through without difficulty.  When watching the first time and the last, I didn't get the finale without it being fed to me as it was in the end.  I watched to see if there were subliminal messages but found none, so that's a definite asset to the film, or was it?

The doctor is knocked out cold as he attempts to rescue his distressed wife and recalls nothing. Her murder is pinned on a serial killer. Case closed. Eight years later two bodies are discovered by the lake, and the doctor receives a bizarre email with a video attached of his wife looking forlornly into the camera and then going up an escalator. Case reopened. Twists, turns, intrigue, drama, and brilliant plotting begin.I strongly recommend this movie to all mystery and cinema fans. Your satisfaction is virtually guaranteed.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 1]","Tough, intricate French-language suspense thriller adapted from the American thriller novel by Harlan Coben, author of the popular ""Myron Bolitar"" mystery series.  The story involves a widower who receives- eight years after his young wife's violent death (a death many think he had something to do with)- a cryptic e-mail that suggests that his wife may indeed still be alive.  Dare he hope?  Soon, several shadowy parties take notice of the case, as they have vested interests in the widower's investigations into the e-mail.The puzzle pieces of the plot are entertaining to watch as they come together to form revelations, but ultimately don't have much to do with the personalities and motivations of the characters (for example, near the end we're made to think everything happened one way, but then big parts of the solution are cleverly tossed aside with a few, final ""now HERE'S what really happened"" explanations).  But that's okay... an intriguing puzzle can be its own justification.Top-notch acting and direction are the high points here, but there's also some very good action, including a foot chase that's up there with the car chase in ""Bullitt"".  The collateral damage of the foot chase is amazing to see, ultimately including a scary highway pile up as speeding cars try to avoid our sprinting hero and his police pursuers (yes, the cops get involved in the case, too).""Tell No One"" looks and sounds great on the standard DVD I watched, which offers both the original French-language version and a version dubbed in English.

Things are not as they seem. Something is amiss.Based on a novel by American Thriller writer, Harlan Cohen much of the film plays like a classic American Thriller (""D.O.A"" and ""Chinatown"") but filtered through the intelligence of screenwriters Canet and Philippe Lefebvre). In fact the tone of ""Tell No One"" feels very much like a Roman Polanski film: as in the aforementioned ""Chinatown"" or ""Knife in the Water"": all complex stories which involve big mysteries and bigger love stories as well.In a scene involving murder and mayhem, Margot is killed. For a short period of time the Police suspect Alexandre but this is soon dispelled and life goes on for Alex, who eventually becomes a Pediatrician but never marries: he pines and mourns for Margot even 8 years after the fact. Then one day he gets an e-mail showing a very much alive Margot...or so it seems.Perhaps there are a few too many plot upheavals here but Canet and Lefebvre keep the business of the film moving along coherently. On hand are a number of French actors who contribute, in small roles, to the truthfulness and humanity of this film: Nathalie Baye, Jean Rochefort and Kristin Scott Thomas (who speaks beautiful idiomatic Parisian French).Harlen Cohen has said that he is a fan of ""stories that move you, that grab hold of your heart and do not let it go.""

Alexandre Beck (Francois Cluzet) is a doctor still grieving for his wife Margot (Marie-Josee Crozel), who was murdered 8 years ago as the couple was enjoying a romantic interlude at their favorite lake. Her death was blamed on a serial killer, but now two more bodies have been found at the lake. Alex had always been a suspect in his wife's death, and the new bodies rekindle the police's interest in him. Detective Levkowitch (Francois Berleand) and his younger, hot-headed partner seem to want to reopen the case. But someone is sending Alex e-mails that imply that Margot may not be dead.This is an overplotted thriller whose twists and turns are likely to loose some of the audience along the way. Margot's behavior and that of the villain don't make sense, so the story is built on shaky premises. Then the plotting strains credibility. But this is probably a better French film than it would have been made in Hollywood. Its romanticism and emphasis on character partly compensate for a plot constructed of more clich&eacute;s and revelations than it can support. Alexandre Beck becomes a classic existential character: a man wrongly accused, plunged into chaos where no one is what they seem and nothing makes sense. It starts out pretty well but goes off the rails. ""Tell No One"" has a fine cast but is headache-inducing and nonsensical.

It is certainly darker (and funnier) than The Fugitive, but it is no accident that there is an American feel, since it is based on a book by Harlan Coben.Eight years after his wife's brutal murder, new clues emerge that lead police to once again suspect that Alexander Beck may have killed her.  At the same time, he begins to think she may be still alive, and is frantic to find her before he is arrested as a suspect for another related homicide.  Director Guillaume Canet keeps you guessing as the plot thickens, revealing bits and pieces of the past as new circumstances help Beck to see that he didn't know his wife as well as he had thought.The film looks great, with editing and camera work that helps to achieve a perfect balance of subtle tension and intensity.  The performances are all very strong -- and there is a surprisingly intense performance by a bit player, a determined and remorseless tall and skinny female assassin/torture expert, that still haunts me.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that her performance created one of the most frightening villians I've seen on the screen in a long time -- even more than the performance of Javier Bardem as Chigurh inNo Country for Old Men-- because it was just as intense but more plausible.

When he regains consciousness three days later, he is told his wife has been murdered and is cremated. Suspected but cleared of the crime, he tries to rebuild his life as a doctor without her. On the anniversary of her death, he receives cryptic emails and a video suggesting she is still alive.This is a splendidly crafted movie that gives no hint of what actually happened until the very end. It keeps you constantly guessing and trying to determine the motivations behind the crimes (other dead bodies are discovered).  If she is indeed alive, why has she not communicated with her husband? If she is dead, who killed her and why?  When photographs of her replete with severe bruises, are discovered in a secret deposit box, under a false name, one wonders if she led a secret life, and who was responsible for the beating?Throughout the movie Alexandre is the police's prime suspect and evidence seems to point in his direction.

(I don't keep specific notes on duration, but I believe twenty-five of them were features and three were shorts/two-reelers) It is now two years later&#8212;two years!&#8212;and the last of those films I have yet to review is Tell No One. (It is currently the oldest thing sitting on the review queue, and I think this is the longest I have ever let anything go without reviewing it.) The odd thing is that I have no idea why it has taken me this long. Two movies I watched that month got four and a half start ratings (The Turin Horse and Metropolis) and one got four stars (Army of Shadows); three and a half is next down the list, and Tell No One sits solidly in the three-and-a-half star category. It's a very competent adaptation of a book I was quite fond of, made all the more impressive that it was the first feature-length script from an actor (not to mention the third feature directed by Canet, also best known as an actor); well-acted, well-presented, and a great deal of fun...and yet I never managed to find a blessed thing to write about it.Plot: in the opening scene, Alex Beck (The Intouchables' Franois Cluzet) and his wife Margot (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly's Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze) are celebrating their anniversary at a secluded lake. After a minor tiff, Margot swims off. Alex dozes off, only to be startled by hearing Margot scream. He swims back to land to find her and is knocked unconscious. Fast-forward eight years. Alex has been exonerated, though he was the prime suspect in his wife's still-unsolved murder. He is getting along day to day, but today is different. Two things happen that threaten to send Alex's world spinning out of control. First, the police contact him. They have discovered two bodies that had been buried at the lake. With them is a bat spattered with blood that matches Alex's; they believe it to be the bat with which he was knocked unconscious. Second, he gets a mysterious email...that may be from Margot. Is she trying to point Alex to her killer from beyond the grave? Or, since Alex never saw the body, is it possible the whole thing was an elaborate hoax?I got the feeling throughout of Prime Suspect. That's not a derogatory statement; to me Prime Suspect was one of TV's best mystery shows. The commonality between them, to me, is that both are able to put together very solid characters without sacrificing pace. And, as a side note, understanding that the pace of something like this doesn't have to be breakneck 100% of the time to keep the tension ratcheted. Tell No One is not a slow film by any means, but it is deliberately-paced for most of its length. Every once in a while Canet uncorks the heavy stuff, but more as an exclamation point than a plot point. It all works, it's not predictable (at least I didn't find it so), and it's a very good time.

1079157,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000R55J1I,Stephanie De Pue,"[10, 13]","""Tell No One,"" (""Ne le dis a personne""), a French film, a crime/drama/ mystery/suspense/thriller, is based, as is well-known, on a novel written by esteemed American mystery author Harlan Coben.  It was first released in Belgium in 2006.  It achieved 2008 theatrical release in art houses in the United States, probably because of the presence in the cast of one of everyone's favorite English actresses, Kristin Scott Thomas (Four Weddings and a Funeral).  (And what a year 2008 was for Scott Thomas, now based in France, and French-speaking; what with ""Tell No One,"" and its close companion feature,I've Loved You So Long, also French, and triumphantly released here.) Anyway, Guillaume Canet directed ""Tell,"" as well as writing the script; he has transposed it, critics agree, seamlessly to France.  Most critics also agree that the story has been made into an extraordinarily beautiful film, making France's rural and urban areas vivid on the screen; and that it benefits from extraordinarily good acting, too.  And most everyone agrees that it is a good solid thriller that grabs a viewer's full attention and keeps it.  As a DVD, the film also offers, wonderfully enough, either subtitles, or dubbed English dialog.Margot Beck, (Marie-Josee Croze), wife of pediatrician Alexandre Beck (Francois Cluzet), has disappeared during a midnight skinny-dip in a peaceful, lovely country lake eight years previously; she was soon found murdered, the presumed victim of a serial killer operating locally.  Yet suddenly Alexandre is getting emails that seem to indicate that she's alive.  Scott Thomas, whom, I understand, married a French citizen and took up residence there, plays Helene Perkins, ""husband"" of Alexandre's sister.  Also notable in the cast are veteran French character actor Jean Rochefort (""Mr. Bean's Holiday"") as Gilbert Neuville, local bigwig; and the lovely Nathalie Baye (Catch Me If You Can) as Maitre Elysabeth Feldman.  Screenwriter/director Canet plays Philippe Neuville, Gilbert's unpleasant son.  Cluzet won a Cesar (the French Oscar equivalent) for his role, as did Canet for his direction.Well, one reason for the very close attention the film received around here is that we frequently didn't know who was doing what to whom, let alone why.  A second viewing might, indeed, have helped.  However, the film opens with a country dinner party, of which, I imagine the function was to introduce the characters.  And, indeed, of the maybe ten people sitting around that table, five, maybe, were to be major players in the action: five, we were never to see again.  Had we had another minute or two with the dinner party, and a word or two of explanation as to whom exactly the characters were, we'd have been a lot happier.

But this one is at the forefront to share with someone who appreciates a great film and an awesome hidef presentation.To further preface this review, I have tried to read a volume of the negative and slanderous reviews out there, and I found myself wondering where so much dislike can originate for such an incredible product. Skip this review if you did not like the film as the following will be a glowing dialogue.Picture: The BD cover states the film runs 125 minutes, but in actuality the span is 132 minutes. The clarity, color palette, lens filters, and a variety of boom/elevated shots all made for an outstanding presentation. Everything seemed to be dissected in each scene to make the most out of what they were putting onto the screen. Even the moving vehicle/dialogue scenes were done for real, so once preserved onto the hidef format, it makes the viewer appreciate each sequence even more. Right from the opening evening sequence, one can see things were being done just right.Audio: Granted, the 5.1 does not get utilized much throughout the film, and the first sub test does not hit until 22 minutes into this long story. But the eclectic mix of music through the front two (side) channels adds a nice touch to hold one over until the primary foot chase sequence. That run in itself probably holds the only test with the freeway sounds and the crashes. Even with that, I was fine with there not being more usage, the story just didn't call for it.Extras: Wow, this reminds me of a Tarsem/Toulsanakis piece with the amount of time put into the main documentary, which runs a nicely paced 55 minutes. I have to be very favorable here as there are minimal talking heads, nicely edited split screen stories, no narration, color mixed with black and white, and so on. Plenty of material to delete with a film like this but the 35 minutes of removed/changed footage was still enjoyable. And for a movie this serious, having the 6 minutes of gag reel footage was a nice touch; It gives one an appreciation for what Cluzet had to go through in filming the lake scene, which didn't even get used.Film: A long story of love, betrayal, secrets, conspiracies, and a story reminiscent of the Fugitive, but told in an artistic, yet believable way. There will be characters who do not get closure, but react realistically to the consequences of their actions. There will be longer sequences that some will feel should be cut to help those with short attention spans. But once you reach that final scene (another great boom shot onto a water reflection perfect for a 1080p screen frame) I think one will feel good about the hours they just spent.A worthwhile addition to the library.

SPOLIERS It's not really a 'mind-bender' or 'puzzler' if there are no clues or few clues through the film.  It's a guy on the run followed by the explanation of why he's on the run. Stylish and well-acted and the plot's a zero.  When you explain at the end, who cares what the explanation is 'ah, she was abducted by aliens and only recently replaced', 'ah, Al Qaida!', 'ah, drug deal gone bad!', they all work because there's nothing to fit to.

Reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" with a touch of ""The Usual Suspects"" and a generous helping of ""The Fugitive"" tossed in for good measure, ""Tell No One"" is a riveting, fast-paced mystery/action/drama.Alexandre Beck (Francois Cluzet) is a Paris pediatrician who was a suspect in the murder of his wife, Margot -- a murder eventually pinned on a serial killer.  Eight years later, two bodies are found near the spot where Margot's corpse was discovered.  The police reopen her case, and once again Alexandre becomes a suspect.  The recent arrival of a mysterious e-mail seems to prove that Margot (Marie Josee-Croze) is still alive and includes the message ""Tell no one.""  Kristin Scott Thomas plays Helene Perkins, the only friend of the increasingly isolated Alexandre.As in all carefully written mysteries, there are several interesting characters besides the main ones.  These include Alexandre's sister Anne (Marina Hands), Margot's father (Andre Dussollier), a police lieutenant eager to pin Margot's murder on Alexandre (Phillippe Lefebvre), the scary Bruno (Gilles Lellouche), who has questionable connections outside the law, and a wealthy aristocrat (Jean Rochefort) who may have information that can clear or condemn Alexandre.  These characters are used almost like chess pieces, each move, each appearance designed to counter a previous appearance or take the film in a new, unexpected direction.  Rarely in film are supporting characters used so deftly.Cluzet's Alexandre Beck is an innocent man who finds himself on the run from the Paris police because he knows he is the only one who can unravel the convoluted circumstances that point to his guilt.  This is a theme mined again and again by Alfred Hitchcock, most famously in ""North By Northwest.""  We root for Alexandre and believe that devotion to his dead wife is the driving force that propels him through a chase, the dredging up of old information, and his perception of relatives.  He is fighting the clock to solve a mystery.  If he fails, he will be jailed.  If he succeeds, he has no idea what he will discover.""Tell No One"" is a superb film.  It has an intriguing story, excellent performances, beautifully staged action sequences, and a roster of complex characters.The unrated Blu-ray edition contains both French and English audio tracks.  There are also English and French subtitles.

It's a &#34;man-on-the-run&#34; action mystery in the tradition of Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and it's very nearly as good as those classics, thanks to a great new director (Guillaume Canet) and a terrific cast.

1079165,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000R55J1I,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Tell No-One turns out to be a rather good French thriller and a distinct improvement on actor-director Guillaume Canet's first directorial effort Mon Idole. The early overhead shots of a couple driving through the countryside summon up echoes of Red Lights, Harry, He's Here to Help and The Vanishing in particular (though the film doesn't really match up to them, at least his influences are impeccable) as it sets up the back-story that sees Francois Cluzet's wife murdered. Fast forward eight years and the good doctor is still suspected by the police, especially when two bodies are unearthed near the murder scene that threaten his alibi. And then there's an email he receives with what looks like live footage of his very much alive wife...There's a good supporting cast - a mostly excellent Andre Dussolier as the antagonistic father-in-law, Jean Rochefort showing once again that he's a much better actor when he doesn't dye his hair to look younger, Nathalie Baye as a razor-sharp lawyer, 36 Quai des Orfevres director Olivier Marchal as a vicious killer and even a less-autopilot-than-usual Kristin Scott-Thomas (maybe she should just stick to French-language parts?) - and it's a surprise to see Luc Besson's Europa Films making something so bourgeois that doesn't involve free-running or martial arts for a change, although there is one excellent chase sequence and a vicious female thug to keep his core constituency happy.If it has a problem - apart from one credulity-straining moment near the end regarding motivation that isn't so much a plot-hole as the Channel Tunnel - it's that at the end of the day, it's JUST a thriller. There aren't enough lingering questions throughout the movie or any real attempt to create doubt as to whether the hero may really have murdered his wife as the police and media still suspect. The twists are satisfying enough but no great revelations, and it's a disappointment that it finds itself forced into an Irving-the-Explainer ending where the plot is explained at gunpoint. Yet despite the lack of depth, it's a satisfyingly well-executed thriller, and if that's enough for you, you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time.

Alexandre, who was also severely injured then by the mysterious culprit, still cannot shake off the memories of the tragedy, in spite of advice from Alex's well-meaning sister Anne (Marina Hands). The opening part is slow and quiet, introducing the characters' back stories, but be patient.The story of a French thriller picks up the pace when more bodies are discovered near the crime scene. This coincides with Alex getting an email with a link, a strange video that suggests Margot is still alive.

Unless you have an attentive friend who comes along with you to the movie theater and who you're counting on to tell you who's who and what's what, then I suggest seeing the film one more time. The question remains, is it worth seeing a second time? Yes but only if you're willing to accept all the contrived goings-on.Dr. Alexandre Beck and his beautiful wife, Margot, go up to their summer house where she is murdered. Flash forward to eight years in the future when two bodies are discovered near the crime scene and the case is reopened. Meanwhile, Dr. Beck receives an email with an attached video that suggests his wife is still alive. I'm not going to go into all the details of the plot since it would take too long to explain everything that happens. But it seems to me that the problem with the film is that there are too many scenes that don't add up.One big problem is the identification of Dr. Beck's wife. Her father, a former police inspector, is called upon to identify the body. They take his word for it and no further inquiries are made regarding the the true identity of the victim. As far as I'm aware, eight years ago, DNA testing was in existence so why wasn't a DNA test conducted on the body right then and there? The father's blood could have been used and they would have seen right away that the victim was in fact a prostitute and not Dr. Beck's wife.Even if you buy that, there's the whole issue of Dr. Beck's pal from the other side of the tracks. He owes the good doctor after Beck diagnoses his son as a hemophiliac and saves him from mistreatment at the hospital. Wherever Dr. Beck goes, his hip-hop friend is there to save him; even at the point where some professional assassins have kidnapped Dr. Beck and tied him up inside a van. Out of nowhere he's plucked from certain doom and some of the assassins are easily dispatched.Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief again, there's the whole matter of Margot disappearing for eight years and then suddenly deciding to contact her husband after so much time. We're told that Margot's father tells her that Alexandre is dead. Even if she's in another country (presumably Brazil), is it likely that she never once decided to google information about her husband or the murder case? She would have found out right away that her husband was still alive and that her father had lied to her. Thus she certainly would have then attempted to contact her husband soon after the murder.While I liked the mogul Neuville as the main antagonist, his character needed a lot more development. That goes double for the shadowy assassins he hires to bump off anyone connected with the murder of his son.Tell No One is an absorbing film and keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.
