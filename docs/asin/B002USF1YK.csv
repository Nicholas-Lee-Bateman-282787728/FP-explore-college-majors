Later, in our family, we picked up on one of the trademarks that set the series apart from others; &#34;Goodnight John Boy&#34; was repeated often in our house, only substituted with real names. What it meant for us was a way to end our day, a kind of &#34;don't let the sun go down on your anger&#34; type of thing.

Then I would record them on the VCR and watch when I got home from work.  When the DVD's came out, it was like Christmas for me!  Each volume was so refreshing to watch.
