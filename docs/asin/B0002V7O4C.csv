He likes having fun with Snoopy and so he decides that it would be great if he had a dog of his own. But his mother won't let him have one and so he has to settle with hanging out with Snoopy's brother Spike, who comes down for a visit.Rerun is a great character and very endearing, so even though this Peanuts special focuses a lot of screen time on him, you won't be missing the other characters too much--and all the main ones make appearances throughout IWADFCCB anyway.The extras include a bonus TV special and a featurette:***BONUS SHOW***--- Happy New Year, Charlie Brown ---Fun episode that has the Peanuts gang celebrating New Year's Eve and Charlie Brown misses an opportunity to get a midnight kiss from the red-haired girl. The only thing that bothered me about this episode was that ""Peppermint Patty's"" voice was a little high for my taste. Here, she actually sounds like a girl rather than an ambiguous character like inA Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (Remastered Deluxe Edition).***FEATURETTE***--- Sibling Rivalry: Growing Up Van Pelt ---11:09-minutesThe featurette has Lee Mendelson (executive producer), Jeannie Schulz (wife of the late Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz), Nat Gertler (Peanuts historian), and Dana Chidekel (author) discuss the intro of the character ""Rerun,"" who made his debut in the comic strip in 1972. They talk about the character's appearance throughout the years and how this cartoon was made after Schulz's death, etc. and they talk about how ""I Want A Dog..."" was basically taken right from the comic strip.***TRAILERS***Trailers forPeanuts: 1970's Collection, Vol. 1 (It's a Mystery Charlie Brown / Play It Again / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / It's the Easter Beagle / There's No Time for Love / You're Not Elected),It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (Remastered Deluxe Edition), andPeanuts: Snoopy's Reunion.Anyway, this is another great episode from Peanuts and would make a great addition to your Charlie Brown collection.",5,"*Sweet* Addition To ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""",1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2359,"['course', 'WANT', 'DOG', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'PEANUTS', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'je', 'ne', 'sais', 'quoi', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'Remastered', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'yearly', 'holiday', 'favorite', 'many', 'still', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'Peanuts', 'collection.The', 'story', 'Linus', 'Lucy', 'Van', 'Pelt', 'baby', 'brother', 'Rerun', 'who', 'title', 'states', 'dog', 'Christmas', 'having', 'fun', 'Snoopy', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'had', 'dog', 'own', 'mother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'one', 'so', 'settle', 'hanging', 'out', 'Snoopy', 'brother', 'Spike', 'who', 'down', 'visit.Rerun', 'great', 'character', 'very', 'endearing', 'so', 'even', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'other', 'characters', 'too', 'much', 'main', 'ones', 'make', 'appearances', 'IWADFCCB', 'anyway.The', 'extras', 'include', 'bonus', 'TV', 'special', 'featurette', '***BONUS', 'SHOW***', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '-Fun', 'episode', 'Peanuts', 'gang', 'celebrating', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'opportunity', 'get', 'midnight', 'kiss', 'red-haired', 'girl', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'episode', 'was', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'voice', 'was', 'little', 'high', 'taste', 'Here', 'actually', 'girl', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'inA', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Thanksgiving', 'Remastered', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '***FEATURETTE***', 'Sibling', 'Rivalry', 'Growing', 'Up', 'Van', 'Pelt', '-11:09-minutesThe', 'featurette', 'Lee', 'Mendelson', 'executive', 'producer', 'Jeannie', 'Schulz', 'wife', 'late', 'Peanuts', 'creator', 'Charles', 'M.', 'Schulz', 'Nat', 'Gertler', 'Peanuts', 'historian', 'Dana', 'Chidekel', 'author', 'intro', 'character', 'Rerun', 'who', 'made', 'debut', 'comic', 'strip', '1972', 'talk', 'character', 'appearance', 'years', 'how', 'cartoon', 'was', 'made', 'Schulz', 'death', 'etc', 'talk', 'how', 'Want', 'Dog', 'was', 'basically', 'taken', 'right', 'comic', 'strip', '***TRAILERS***Trailers', 'forPeanuts', '1970', 'Collection', 'Vol', '1', 'Mystery', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '/', 'Play', 'Again', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Thanksgiving', '/', 'Easter', 'Beagle', '/', 'Time', 'Love', '/', ""'re"", 'Not', 'Elected', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Remastered', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Snoopy', 'Reunion.Anyway', 'great', 'episode', 'Peanuts', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'collection']",N/A

As the smallest child he feels left out of playing around with the other kids and wishes for a dog for Xmas. He starts a great friendship with Snoopy but Charlie Brown is reluctant to let him go. I felt so sorry for Rerun. He's just so desperate for attention, to be taken seriously. He's got a lot of love inside him and needs a best friend to let it all out. Jimmy Bennett's voice acting is spot-on and makes him so real.It's all harmless fun, if not completely in-disposable. I've made it a Xmas tradition already as well as the other seasonal Charlie Brown specials. Though the DVD is where the real worth comes in. Included is a decent documentary on the original Charlie Brown Christmas, with interviews with cast members and the filmmakers. Also included is Happy New Year, Charlie Brown in which Old blockhead gets nothing right. And nothing goes right for him either. This New Year themed special is no exception. All Chuck wants to do is prepare for a New Year's Eve party and ask out the little red-headed girl he's long had a crush on. Only his luck would land him with the task of reading War and Peace in just a few days with a book report due as soon as he goes back to school.While the others are having fun, dancing, drinking root beer, and counting down to midnight Chuck can do nought but slave away through the pages of a Russian epic. You can't help but feel sorry for him. His bad luck doesn't end there though, or ever come to think of it.Makes for a perfect double-bill with any of the Peanuts Xmas specials in the week between Dec 25th and Dec 31st.The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn, with Dolby 2.0 sound.",4,Cute DVD for Xmas,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,1806,"['40-minute', 'TV', 'special', 'story', 'Rerun', 'Linus', 'Lucy', 'very', 'cute', 'younger', 'brother', 'loved', 'scenes', 'stuck', 'back', 'mother', 'bicycle', 'smallest', 'child', 'left', 'playing', 'other', 'kids', 'wishes', 'dog', 'Xmas', 'great', 'friendship', 'Snoopy', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'reluctant', 'let', 'go', 'felt', 'so', 'sorry', 'Rerun', 'just', 'so', 'desperate', 'attention', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'got', 'lot', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'let', 'out', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'voice', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'so', 'real.It', 'harmless', 'fun', 'not', 'completely', 'in-disposable', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Xmas', 'tradition', 'already', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'seasonal', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'specials', 'DVD', 'where', 'real', 'worth', 'Included', 'decent', 'documentary', 'original', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'filmmakers', 'Also', 'included', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Old', 'blockhead', 'nothing', 'right', 'nothing', 'right', 'New', 'Year', 'themed', 'special', 'exception', 'Chuck', 'do', 'prepare', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'ask', 'out', 'little', 'red-headed', 'girl', 'long', 'had', 'crush', 'Only', 'luck', 'would', 'land', 'task', 'reading', 'War', 'Peace', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'book', 'report', 'due', 'as', 'soon', 'back', 'school.While', 'others', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'dancing', 'drinking', 'root', 'beer', 'counting', 'down', 'midnight', 'Chuck', 'can', 'do', 'nought', 'slave', 'away', 'pages', 'Russian', 'epic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'bad', 'luck', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'ever', 'come', 'think', 'it.Makes', 'perfect', 'double-bill', 'Peanuts', 'Xmas', 'specials', 'week', 'Dec', '25th', 'Dec', '31st.The', 'DVD', '1.33:1', 'full', 'frame', 'drawn', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'sound']",N/A

845545,A1HTO5COXAY1NQ,B0002V7O4C,Skippy the Skeptic,"[4, 4]","The last of the three Charlie Brown Christmas specials, ""I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown"" was made 38 years after the original ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and is composed almost entirely of gags lifted directly from 1990s ""Peanuts"" strips.  It's not an awful Christmas special by any means, but it's not nearly as good as the original. (I'd say it's about on par with 1992's ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"".)  My main gripe with it is how disjointed it feels.  Most of the film is made of 60-second vignettes pasted end-to-end into a loose plot.  It really is just a string of animated versions of the daily strips played one after the next.  At times it isn't too noticeable, but during some sequences (especially the two scenes wherein Rerun is riding on the back of his mom's bike) it's painfully obviously and quite distracting.  Some viewers may also be somewhat put off by the focus on Rerun as opposed to more familiar characters from the Peanuts brand.  To be fair, some of the jokes are funny, and it's fun to see Snoopy's brothers depicted in animation, but overall the experience (while not unpleasant per se) is rather forgettable.If ""I Want a Dog for Christmas"" was the only show on the disc then I probably wouldn't be able to recommend it, but one of the bonus features is a second full TV special, 1986's ""Happy New Year Charlie Brown"".  It's far superior to the main feature in that it not only showcases the more iconic Peanuts characters but that it has a far more engaging plot and much better pacing.  I'm aware even as I type this that using words like ""plot"" and ""pacing"" in reference to a children's holiday special sounds kind of silly, but I really cannot over-emphasize how cobbled together ""I Want a Dog for Christmas"" seems.  The New Year's special actually feels like a coherent whole equipped with bona fide characters rather than just talking heads.  In short, it's got the good ol' Peanuts charm.In summary, if you're considering purchasing this disc, I'd recommend considering the New Year's Special to be the main feature and the Christmas special to be the bonus.  If you're looking for great Christmas special I'd recommend picking up the original 1965 ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" instead, but if you're interested in getting a charming New Year's special (with a so-so Christmas special tossed in as a bonus) then this disc may be for you.",3,Get it for the New Year's Special,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2395,"['last', 'three', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'Want', 'Dog', 'Christmas', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'was', 'made', '38', 'years', 'original', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'composed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'gags', 'lifted', 'directly', '1990s', 'Peanuts', 'strips', 'not', 'awful', 'Christmas', 'special', 'means', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', ""'d"", 'say', 'par', '1992', 'Christmastime', 'Again', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'main', 'gripe', 'how', 'disjointed', 'Most', 'film', 'made', '60-second', 'vignettes', 'pasted', 'end-to-end', 'loose', 'plot', 'really', 'just', 'string', 'animated', 'versions', 'daily', 'strips', 'played', 'one', 'next', 'times', ""n't"", 'too', 'noticeable', 'sequences', 'especially', 'two', 'scenes', 'Rerun', 'riding', 'back', 'mom', 'bike', 'painfully', 'obviously', 'quite', 'distracting', 'viewers', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'somewhat', 'put', 'off', 'focus', 'Rerun', 'opposed', 'more', 'familiar', 'characters', 'Peanuts', 'brand', 'be', 'fair', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'fun', 'see', 'Snoopy', 'brothers', 'depicted', 'animation', 'experience', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'se', 'rather', 'forgettable.If', 'Want', 'Dog', 'Christmas', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'disc', 'then', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'recommend', 'one', 'bonus', 'second', 'full', 'TV', 'special', '1986', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'far', 'superior', 'main', 'feature', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'iconic', 'Peanuts', 'characters', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'pacing', ""'m"", 'aware', 'even', 'type', 'using', 'words', 'plot', 'pacing', 'reference', 'children', 'holiday', 'special', 'kind', 'silly', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'over-emphasize', 'how', 'cobbled', 'together', 'Want', 'Dog', 'Christmas', 'New', 'Year', 'special', 'actually', 'feels', 'coherent', 'whole', 'equipped', 'bona', 'fide', 'characters', 'rather', 'just', 'talking', 'heads', 'short', 'got', 'good', 'ol', 'Peanuts', 'charm.In', 'summary', ""'re"", 'considering', 'purchasing', 'disc', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'considering', 'New', 'Year', 'Special', 'be', 'main', 'feature', 'Christmas', 'special', 'be', 'bonus', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'Christmas', 'special', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'original', '1965', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'instead', ""'re"", 'interested', 'getting', 'charming', 'New', 'Year', 'special', 'so-so', 'Christmas', 'special', 'tossed', 'bonus', 'then', 'disc', 'may', 'be']",N/A

One of them is a brief documentary on the creation of the original 1965 Christmas special with rarely-seen animation from the early sixties, making it a must-see for Peanuts historians.There's no underlying religious theme here - just a string of family-friendly gags recycled from strips dating back to the sixties. The only thing here that might confuse your pre-schooler is why any parent would name their kid ""Rerun"". (It's actually a nickname; Lucy felt alienated when Linus was born, and she experienced a ""rerun"" of those feelings when her new baby brother joined the family. The kid's real name has never been revealed.)Long-time Peanuts fans are making unflattering comparisons between this special and the 1965 holiday classic, but I think there's room on your shelf for both of them.

The special first aired in 2003 (after Schulz's death) and features Rerun van Pelt, Linus & Lucy's younger brother. Rerun desperately wants a dog, but his mother doesn't think he's up to the task. Rerun seeks to live vicariously by asking Charlie Brown if he can play with Snoopy. Snoopy agrees, but only temporarily. Then Snoopy's brother Spike comes to visit and Lucy agrees with Rerun that Spike should stay with them until he can find another home. This special is somewhat note-worthy because Charlie Brown breaks the fourth wall right before the credits roll.The other television special on this Deluxe Edition DVD is ""Happy New Year, Charlie Brown."" This special first aired on television in 1986. The day before school lets out for Christmas Vacation, Charlie Brown's teacher assigns his class the assignment of reading WAR AND PEACE and writing a report on it. Charlie Brown does his best to read the massive volume, but Peppermint Patty is hosting a New Year's Eve party which all of his friends will be attending. In order to get through the main points of the book, he goes to a store and tries to find a copy of the book in comic book form, on cassette, as a computer game, or on a film strip. Charlie Brown decides that even though he won't have finished WAR AND PEACE, he will attend the New Year's Eve party. He attempts to invite the Little Red-Haired Girl, but never hears a response from her. New Year's Eve comes and the party doesn't go as anyone planned. As a side note, WAR AND PEACE was one of Schulz's favorite books. Also, this is one of the few television specials where the Little Red-Haired Girl actually appears.Other than some trailers, the only special feature on the DVD is a featurette entitled ""Sibling Rivalry: Growing Up Van Pelt,"" that explains how Schulz came to create the character of Rerun.As far as Peanuts DVDs go, this is about average. Unlike many Peanuts fans, I actually like the character of Rerun. He's like a smaller version of Linus, but with more wisdom and innocence. I remember watching ""Happy New Year, Charlie Brown"" when it first aired on television and because of that, it's a Peanuts special that holds a special place with me. I also found the ""Sibling Rivalry"" special featurette interesting and it's better than some of featurettes found on other Peanuts Deluxe Editions, such as the one about the  Redwood Empire Ice Arena on HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN.",4,Featuring Rerun and a Classic Piece of Literature,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2690,"['Deluxe', 'Edition', 'WANT', 'DOG', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'two', 'television', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'special', 'featurette', 'how', 'Charles', 'Schulz', 'came', 'create', 'Rerun.The', 'title', 'special', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Want', 'Dog', 'Christmas', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'special', 'first', 'aired', '2003', 'Schulz', 'death', 'Rerun', 'van', 'Pelt', 'Linus', 'Lucy', 'younger', 'brother', 'Rerun', 'desperately', 'dog', 'mother', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'task', 'Rerun', 'live', 'vicariously', 'asking', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'can', 'play', 'Snoopy', 'Snoopy', 'only', 'temporarily', 'Then', 'Snoopy', 'brother', 'Spike', 'visit', 'Lucy', 'Rerun', 'Spike', 'should', 'stay', 'can', 'find', 'home', 'special', 'somewhat', 'note-worthy', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'fourth', 'wall', 'right', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'other', 'television', 'special', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'special', 'first', 'aired', 'television', '1986', 'day', 'school', 'lets', 'out', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'teacher', 'class', 'assignment', 'reading', 'WAR', 'PEACE', 'writing', 'report', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'best', 'read', 'massive', 'volume', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'hosting', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'order', 'get', 'main', 'points', 'book', 'store', 'tries', 'find', 'copy', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'form', 'cassette', 'computer', 'game', 'film', 'strip', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'finished', 'WAR', 'AND', 'PEACE', 'will', 'attend', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'invite', 'Little', 'Red-Haired', 'Girl', 'never', 'response', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', ""n't"", 'go', 'anyone', 'planned', 'side', 'note', 'WAR', 'AND', 'PEACE', 'was', 'one', 'Schulz', 'favorite', 'books', 'Also', 'one', 'few', 'television', 'specials', 'where', 'Little', 'Red-Haired', 'Girl', 'actually', 'appears.Other', 'trailers', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Sibling', 'Rivalry', 'Growing', 'Up', 'Van', 'Pelt', 'how', 'Schulz', 'came', 'create', 'character', 'Rerun.As', 'far', 'Peanuts', 'DVDs', 'go', 'about', 'average', 'many', 'Peanuts', 'fans', 'actually', 'character', 'Rerun', 'smaller', 'version', 'Linus', 'more', 'wisdom', 'innocence', 'remember', 'watching', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'special', 'place', 'also', 'found', 'Sibling', 'Rivalry', 'special', 'featurette', 'interesting', 'better', 'featurettes', 'found', 'other', 'Peanuts', 'Deluxe', 'Editions', 'such', 'one', 'Redwood', 'Empire', 'Ice', 'Arena', 'HE', 'YOUR', 'DOG', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN']",N/A
