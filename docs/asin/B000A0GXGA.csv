918013,A1166FE81ADOUR,B000A0GXGA,50s sci-fi Fan,"[25, 26]","I first saw ""Maverick"" the year after TV came to Adelaide and I had just entered my teens; in other words there were two reasons that might have influenced my high opinion of the show - TV was a novelty and I was very young. Decades later when the episode, ""Full House"" (25 October 1959; Season 3, Episode 7) was shown on the ""Golden Years of Television,"" I was delighted to find ""Maverick"" just as fresh and intelligent as I did at first. Brett was ""still"" that cowardly, opportunistic, but somehow lovable gambler aways blundering into scrapes.Brett cleans out a man at poker, but when the loser can't pay-up, Maverick takes his diamond horse-shoe stick-pin as collateral. The loser was reluctant to hand the diamonds over but NOT for the obvious reasons! You see, the man had a secret appointment to lead some of the worst outlaws in the West on a robbery; an ""ensemble"" of none other than Cole Younger, Sam Bass, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr! Of course, in the best Maverick tradition the only way these desperadoes can recognise the man was... you guessed it, the diamond stick-pin!Brett's sense of triumph over the hapless loser turns to horror when he realises what the stick-pin means. Ever the coward, Maverick hurriedly comes up with the most preposterous plan he can think of to discourage the outlaws  - robbing the Denver Mint.To Brett's consternation, the outlaws think he's brilliant and can not wait to get on with the robbery. The plan works, as it only could in the Maverick world, and Brett, ever the opportunist, says he'll meet them all at a given time and location to divide the spoils ~ then he telegraphs the Marshall's Office with the details of the meeting and where to send him the reward money for their capture.Earlier in the story, the local sheriff sees dubious characters arrive in town and decides to lock up the most suspicious looking of all - naturally this is Brett - while he sends for information. Brett is bored laying in his cell and reads the graffiti on the ceiling to entertain himself. He is startled by a limerick saying the cell door will lift free of its hinges. Brett is naturally doubtful, but scornful of ""hicktown"" ineptitude when it works.The outlaws are very impressed by his ""daring"" escape, which only serves to increase their trust in him and confidence in his robbery plan.I went into all of the above detail for the sake of people who don't know much about the Maverick format. Maverick, especially in the hands of James Gardner, had a unique, but above all INTELLIGENT, suspension of disbelief guaranteed to keep the show fresh.",5,Bret was the best Maverick,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,2589,"['first', 'saw', 'Maverick', 'year', 'TV', 'came', 'Adelaide', 'had', 'just', 'entered', 'teens', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'two', 'reasons', 'might', 'have', 'influenced', 'high', 'opinion', 'show', 'TV', 'was', 'novelty', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Decades', 'later', 'when', 'episode', 'Full', 'House', '25', 'October', '1959', 'Season', '3', 'Episode', '7', 'was', 'shown', 'Golden', 'Years', 'Television', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'Maverick', 'just', 'fresh', 'intelligent', 'did', 'first', 'Brett', 'was', 'still', 'cowardly', 'opportunistic', 'somehow', 'lovable', 'gambler', 'aways', 'blundering', 'scrapes.Brett', 'out', 'man', 'poker', 'when', 'loser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay-up', 'Maverick', 'diamond', 'horse-shoe', 'stick-pin', 'collateral', 'loser', 'was', 'reluctant', 'hand', 'diamonds', 'NOT', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'see', 'man', 'had', 'secret', 'appointment', 'lead', 'worst', 'outlaws', 'West', 'robbery', 'ensemble', 'none', 'other', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'Sam', 'Bass', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Belle', 'Starr', 'course', 'best', 'Maverick', 'tradition', 'only', 'way', 'desperadoes', 'can', 'recognise', 'man', 'was', 'guessed', 'diamond', 'stick-pin', 'Brett', 'sense', 'triumph', 'hapless', 'loser', 'horror', 'when', 'what', 'stick-pin', 'means', 'Ever', 'coward', 'Maverick', 'hurriedly', 'up', 'most', 'preposterous', 'plan', 'can', 'think', 'discourage', 'outlaws', 'robbing', 'Denver', 'Mint.To', 'Brett', 'consternation', 'outlaws', 'think', 'brilliant', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'robbery', 'plan', 'only', 'could', 'Maverick', 'world', 'Brett', 'ever', 'opportunist', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'given', 'time', 'location', 'divide', 'spoils', '~', 'then', 'Marshall', 'Office', 'details', 'meeting', 'where', 'send', 'reward', 'money', 'capture.Earlier', 'story', 'local', 'sheriff', 'dubious', 'characters', 'arrive', 'town', 'decides', 'lock', 'up', 'most', 'suspicious', 'looking', 'naturally', 'Brett', 'information', 'Brett', 'bored', 'laying', 'cell', 'graffiti', 'ceiling', 'entertain', 'startled', 'limerick', 'saying', 'cell', 'door', 'will', 'lift', 'free', 'hinges', 'Brett', 'naturally', 'doubtful', 'scornful', 'hicktown', 'ineptitude', 'when', 'works.The', 'outlaws', 'are', 'very', 'impressed', 'daring', 'escape', 'only', 'increase', 'trust', 'confidence', 'robbery', 'plan.I', 'went', 'above', 'detail', 'sake', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Maverick', 'format', 'Maverick', 'especially', 'hands', 'James', 'Gardner', 'had', 'unique', 'INTELLIGENT', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'show', 'fresh']",N/A

As of the beginning of 2010, they have moved it to an early morning time slot in favor of showing The Virginian and Cheyenne on the late afternoon/early evening slot which Maverick occupied for 18 months. If you've never seen this show or missed some of them, be sure to set your DVR if you have one. *****************************************************************This is the role that made James Garner, and as much as I like his later work, for me he would never be this much fun to watch again (exception: Support Your Local Sheriff, but that was unquestionably written to capitalize on his Maverick role).I remembered liking Maverick when I was a kid, but after 40 odd years I didn't remember a single episode or plot line. I can't tell you what a pleasure it was to find this series resurrected on Good Life (Now American Life) TV. Sadly, after a few years ALTV abandoned the excellent B&W; series they had been showing, and began airing very inferior color series from later years. Yep, I'll take Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip over Time Tunnel and Lost in Space .... EVERY time.However, when it aired on ALTV, discovering each episode's charm brought my wife and I months of entertainment, and expectation for the next week.Among some classic episodes to look for are:* ""War of the Silver Kings"", this is the first episode and unquestionably one of the best* ""Gun Shy"", an absolutely hilarious take off on Gun Smoke (on this DVD)* ""A Fellow's Brother"", an entertaining story throughout that made me fall out of my chair laughing when presented with the twist that resolved the crises* ""Shady Day at Sunny Acres"", in which Bret Maverick spends the majority of the episode in a rocking chair on the town's boardwalk, whittling and uttering the line, ""I'm workin' on it"" (on this DVD)* ""Pappy"", wherein you meet the originator of all of Bret's ""My old Pappy used to say ..."" lines. Garner of course plays dual roles in the episode and does a great job. (So the movie is only the 2nd time he got to play Bret's father!)

Consequently, I was disappointed by this collection because of the heavy presence of Bart.  3 Stars because the selection of episodes does not reflect my recollections of the charm of this series.I was prepared for certain other disappointments - recollections are of the improvement/innovation, and not of the absolute quality itself.  Thus the innovations of a show such as Maverick can get swamped by decades of other shows building on and improving what made Maverick so special.The episode ""Shady Deal..."" stood up surprisingly well.  I had expected the subsequent ""big con"" movies (eg The Sting) and TV shows to make it seem trite and/or amateurish.  While there weren't the big surprise twists of successors, it was emotionally satisfying (Bad guy get his...).The episode ""Gun shy"" was cute enough but the comedy was badly muted because ""Gunsmoke"" had become an ancient memory for me (and I wasn't a fan of Gunsmoke).I found the episode ""Pappy"" disappointing and flat.Biggest of what is missing is the genesis of the heroic coward character that James Garner perfected in subsequent movies and TV series.My other strong recollection of Bret Maverick was the ""small con"" and the cool demeanor but frantic calculating and maneuvering to keep the bad guy from winning.

C'mon Warner, this audience isn't getting any younger; the longer you wait only decreases the potential number of customers willing to buy this!That being said, I'll talk about what's on this disc. It has three episodes & they are among the best episodes of Maverick. The three episodes are ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"", ""Pappy"" & ""Gun-Shy"". There are probably another 20 to 25 episodes of Maverick that are just as good as these. The only one I felt shouldn't have been here is ""Shady Deal..."" because it includes all the semi-regulars in small roles that are assisting Maverick in the con. Unless you're a big fan of Maverick & have seen most (or all) the episodes, this cast of semi-regulars doesn't come across with the same impact because you don't know of their previous history with the Maverick brothers. So, the inside joke of this cast is lost upon any viewer that's not familiar with the other shows. The three episodes featured here include the humor & satirical bite of the traditional Maverick episodes. These are indicative episodes of Maverick, representing the entire series. These elements are well showcased & these are the things that made Maverick so popular in its day as well as making it standout among all the more traditional Westerns of the fifties.If you're a fan of Maverick I would highly recommend buying this single DVD issue.

Demand was so great that it quickly sold out, and continuing demand naturally bid up the prices being sought by dealers who still had unsold, unopened, original copies.  Amazon, I believe, has always listed it as a single disk totaling 149 minutes, and if purchasers outraged at paying through the nose for a single disk totaling 149 minutes bought their copies ELSEWHERE, it would be sporting to note in their Amazon reviews that they were not victims of ""outright fraud with malice"" on THIS site. If they paid what they consider an exorbitant price for this item EVEN THOUGH Amazon has always CLEARLY LISTED it as a single disk totaling 149 minutes, it would be only fair for them, while cautioning others not to make the same mistake, to acknowledge that culpability lies with their own inattention rather than non-existent fraud and malice on the part of others.  That being said, the two key points to made about this DVD are: (1) It contains three irresistible episodes in the series' comic vein, all starring James Garner, though Jack Kelly is also nicely represented.  (2) Now that the complete first season of ""Maverick"" has finally been released and is available on Amazon for under $30, you will probably not want to pay TOO much more than the original $10 price for these second- and third-season episodes while waiting for those sets to be released--though ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" and ""Gun Shy"" in particular are so wonderful that I can see why you might be tempted to jump the gun.",4,"A wonderful bargain sampler, at the original price",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1603,"['memory', 'serves', 'DVD', 'listed', 'about', '10', 'certainly', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'originally', 'released', 'Demand', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'quickly', 'sold', 'out', 'continuing', 'demand', 'naturally', 'bid', 'up', 'prices', 'being', 'sought', 'dealers', 'who', 'still', 'had', 'unsold', 'unopened', 'original', 'copies', 'Amazon', 'believe', 'always', 'listed', 'single', 'disk', 'totaling', '149', 'minutes', 'purchasers', 'outraged', 'paying', 'nose', 'single', 'disk', 'totaling', '149', 'minutes', 'bought', 'copies', 'ELSEWHERE', 'would', 'be', 'sporting', 'note', 'Amazon', 'were', 'not', 'victims', 'outright', 'fraud', 'malice', 'THIS', 'site', 'paid', 'what', 'consider', 'exorbitant', 'price', 'item', 'EVEN', 'THOUGH', 'Amazon', 'always', 'CLEARLY', 'LISTED', 'single', 'disk', 'totaling', '149', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'fair', 'cautioning', 'others', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'acknowledge', 'culpability', 'own', 'inattention', 'rather', 'non-existent', 'fraud', 'malice', 'part', 'others', 'being', 'said', 'two', 'key', 'points', 'made', 'DVD', 'are', '1', 'three', 'irresistible', 'episodes', 'series', 'comic', 'vein', 'starring', 'James', 'Garner', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'also', 'nicely', 'represented', '2', 'Now', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Maverick', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'available', 'Amazon', '30', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'want', 'pay', 'TOO', 'much', 'more', 'original', '10', 'price', 'second-', 'third-season', 'episodes', 'waiting', 'sets', 'be', 'released', 'Shady', 'Deal', 'Sunny', 'Acres', 'Gun', 'Shy', 'particular', 'are', 'so', 'wonderful', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'jump', 'gun']",N/A

Gunfights were few and far between here. And if any cattle showed up, it was probably a mistake.Bret and Bart Maverick (James Garner, Jack Kelly) were gamblers with a strange moral code. They were usually out for a con. But if it didn't work out for them, they'd make sure that it worked out for someone else... and never for the bad guy. All the while, they spouted life's little lessons as taught to them by their beloved Pappy.While Garner and Kelly would trade off episodes during the series, sometimes the brothers Maverick would come together for a little bit of fun. Two of those episodes are featured here. On occasion, they would bump into their British cousin, Beau (Roger Moore)... just an FYI as he's nowhere to be seen on this disc.""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" starts out as a Garner episode and turns into a Kelly episode as the brothers team to take down a crooked banker (John Dehner).""Pappy"" brings the brothers together again as an old friend (Troy Donahue) warns them that their Pappy intends to wed an 18-year old. This was the only appearance by their Pappy in the series. It also features a cameo by their Uncle Bentley.""Guy Shy"" (my personal favorite on the set) is a parody of the day's number one western, ""Gunsmoke"". With a painfully earnest performance by Marshal Mort Dooley (instead of Matt Dillon). Maverick has done nothing wrong, yet is booted out of Elwood by the good Marshal.

So, by taking a limited marketing approach, Warners (or whoever made this decision) has corrupted the information they probably hoped to acquire about the potential for a more robust - full seasons - release.As much as I like Clint Walker, for example, Clint is not James Garner. Garner has such a strong track record with ""Maverick"" and ""Rockford Files"", plus his extensive film career, that holding back on a robust release of ""Maverick"" is the mark of a wimp, not a cautious marketing scheme.I also bought almost everything that Columbia House offered for the 30 minute episodes of ""Gunsmoke""... and I see that ""Gunsmoke"" is being sold not as seasons but as 'volumes' with selected episodes from the first 9 seasons. That may well work better for marketing purposes, but Columbia House released the episodes in chronological order, and I can tell you that to see ""Gunsmoke"" in order of release is VASTLY preferable to seeing the episodes selected using any other rule of thumb. To fully appreciate ""Gunsmoke"" you have to transport yourself back in time, into the homes across the country which were being lighted by B&W; TV so powerful that ""Gunsmoke"" was truly the first ""must see TV"" series.Anything less than a release of the seasons of Gunsmoke in order of release, is a cheat of not only the consumer but also to demean the brilliant efforts of the cast. I understand that ""Gunsmoke"" has epsiode commentary by James Arness and Dennis Weaver as well as other guest stars, so I will probably buy Volume 1 just for that, but personally, I want to experience this groundbreaking series as close to the way it was originally presented as possible.
