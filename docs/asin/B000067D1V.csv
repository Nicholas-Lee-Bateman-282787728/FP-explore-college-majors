702035,A1TFNBZUP5RTY7,B000067D1V,Catfish,"[7, 7]","Most reviews of this movie say it misses the mark, that it isn't all that funny, etc.  I like it. Caan and Gould play excellent buffoons; in fact, few play a complete airhead like James Caan can (Tommy Smothers of course comes to mind).  This movie contains a real historical figure in the form of Adam Worth, an actual 19th century criminal mastermind who is the subject of an upcoming movie starring Christian Bales.  And, Shang Draper's really DID exist.  That historicity in itself makes it very unique. Anyway, the acting is first-rate in this show, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I laughed out loud several times.  The story is easy to follow and allows all involved to exercise their comic abilities.  So, get a copy and enjoy some really good actors in a light comedy that is really unique.",4,"Actually, it's pretty funny",1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,804,"['Most', 'reviews', 'movie', 'say', 'mark', ""n't"", 'funny', 'etc', 'Caan', 'Gould', 'play', 'excellent', 'buffoons', 'fact', 'few', 'play', 'complete', 'airhead', 'James', 'Caan', 'can', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'course', 'mind', 'movie', 'real', 'historical', 'figure', 'form', 'Adam', 'Worth', 'actual', '19th', 'century', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'who', 'subject', 'upcoming', 'movie', 'starring', 'Christian', 'Bales', 'Shang', 'Draper', 'really', 'DID', 'exist', 'historicity', 'very', 'unique', 'Anyway', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'involved', 'exercise', 'comic', 'abilities', 'So', 'get', 'copy', 'enjoy', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'light', 'comedy', 'really', 'unique']",Harry and Walter Go to New York
