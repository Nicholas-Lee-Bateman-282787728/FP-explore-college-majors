258508,A3W3RX6IVRQNZG,6301627024,Bureau,"[1, 10]","Let me say, first off, that I don't like chick flicks.  Didn't care for Beaches.  Hated Ever After.  This does not make chick flicks, as a genre, bad; it simply means that, as a genre, I don't care for it.  This is the core difference between a preference and a value judgement.  Breaking down a movie like Beaches, I could still find good aspects like pacing, acting, or cinematography.  I could still say, value wise, that there was some merit in them.  Not so much with Shirley Valentine.The cinematography, with its awkward jump-cuts, feels right out of the 70's, which is puzzling as the movie was released in 1989.  The scripting is so ham-handed and so riddled with cliches that even a talented actor would have trouble rising above it to flesh out a three dimensional character.  Do you remember how Ian McKellen made Gandalf lovable, or how Ewan McGregor almost made the Star Wars prequels tolerable?  That's not going to happen here.  Collin's idea of nuanced acting is staring blankly into the camera while delivering some of the most awkward attempts at fourth wall breaking I've ever seen.  Bernard Hill's ""We always have steak on Thursdays"" was probably the pinnacle of the film's acting, and as that happens about ten minutes in, you know you're in for it.My key objection to the film is its double-standard of a purported moral or message (warning: spoilers to follow)... that it was morally correct for the titular character to ditch her mundane life, run off the Greece, and have an affair with a Greek stereotype complete with stock mustache.  I have a problem with this as if we reverse the roles, and have her husband Joe get sick of working 8 hour days to provide food to a wife that gives it away from dogs; if we had Joe go off to Sweden and have an affair with some a stock blonde complete with bursting bust line, the same people who praised this movie would get on their soapboxes and insist the film was misogynist rubbish.  Why?  I mean aren't we just taking the same role and swapping the main character's gender?  Well, yes.  But the woman is allowed to blow her end of the social contract, while the man is not.Let's break this down.  A marriage is a contract, and there are as many flavors of contract as there are marriages.  Shirley's particular flavor was, let's say, vanilla; her husband goes out to make the money, while she takes care of the home and the children.  Does she have the right to redefine that contract, even leave it? Definitely.  Running off to Greece isn't a redefinition; it's not even formally leaving.  It's an escape - a midlife crises.  The female equivalent of getting hair plugs, buying a sports car, and ditching the wife for a 19-year-old waitress.  This isn't feminist or empowering; it's cowardly, irresponsible, and a blatant double standard.If the story had been delivered in anything resembling an even manner, if Shirley's actions would have had consequences, I would have been fine with this film.  What would Joe tell his family?  How would the kids react?  How will the couple come to grips with the trust issues surrounding Shirley's infidelity, and the original issues around which she abandoned their relationship?  Any of these would have been interesting angles to explore, but sadly director Lewis Gilbert (like the original writer Willy Russel) wasn't anywhere near that insightful.  Shirley behaves in a reckless fashion and has an affair, and, because she happens to be female, everything turns up Shirley.  This film is less an exploration into the issues surrounding a contemporary housewife, and more the sort of propagandistic fairy tale I'd expect from your average Riki Lake audience member.",1,A Grand Exercise in Double Standards,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3679,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'chick', 'flicks', 'Did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Beaches', 'Hated', 'Ever', 'not', 'make', 'chick', 'flicks', 'genre', 'bad', 'simply', 'that', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'core', 'difference', 'preference', 'value', 'judgement', 'Breaking', 'down', 'movie', 'Beaches', 'could', 'still', 'find', 'good', 'aspects', 'pacing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'could', 'still', 'say', 'value', 'wise', 'was', 'merit', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Shirley', 'Valentine.The', 'cinematography', 'awkward', 'jump-cuts', 'feels', 'right', '70', 'puzzling', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1989', 'scripting', 'so', 'ham-handed', 'so', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'even', 'talented', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'rising', 'flesh', 'out', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'Do', 'remember', 'how', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'made', 'Gandalf', 'lovable', 'how', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'almost', 'made', 'Star', 'Wars', 'tolerable', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'here', 'Collin', 'idea', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'staring', 'blankly', 'camera', 'delivering', 'most', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'fourth', 'wall', 'breaking', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'always', 'have', 'steak', 'Thursdays', 'was', 'probably', 'pinnacle', 'film', 'acting', 'ten', 'minutes', 'know', ""'re"", 'it.My', 'key', 'objection', 'film', 'double-standard', 'purported', 'moral', 'message', 'warning', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'was', 'morally', 'correct', 'titular', 'character', 'ditch', 'mundane', 'life', 'run', 'off', 'Greece', 'have', 'affair', 'Greek', 'stereotype', 'complete', 'stock', 'mustache', 'have', 'problem', 'reverse', 'roles', 'have', 'husband', 'Joe', 'get', 'sick', 'working', '8', 'hour', 'days', 'provide', 'food', 'wife', 'away', 'dogs', 'had', 'Joe', 'go', 'off', 'Sweden', 'have', 'affair', 'stock', 'blonde', 'complete', 'bursting', 'bust', 'line', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'praised', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'soapboxes', 'insist', 'film', 'was', 'misogynist', 'rubbish', 'Why', 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'taking', 'same', 'role', 'swapping', 'main', 'character', 'gender', 'Well', 'yes', 'woman', 'allowed', 'blow', 'end', 'social', 'contract', 'man', 'not.Let', 'break', 'down', 'marriage', 'contract', 'are', 'many', 'flavors', 'contract', 'are', 'marriages', 'Shirley', 'particular', 'flavor', 'was', 'let', 'say', 'vanilla', 'husband', 'out', 'make', 'money', 'care', 'home', 'children', 'have', 'right', 'redefine', 'contract', 'even', 'leave', 'Definitely', 'Running', 'off', 'Greece', ""n't"", 'redefinition', 'not', 'even', 'formally', 'leaving', 'escape', 'midlife', 'crises', 'female', 'equivalent', 'getting', 'hair', 'plugs', 'buying', 'sports', 'car', 'ditching', 'wife', '19-year-old', 'waitress', ""n't"", 'feminist', 'empowering', 'cowardly', 'irresponsible', 'blatant', 'double', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'delivered', 'anything', 'resembling', 'even', 'manner', 'Shirley', 'actions', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'consequences', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'film', 'What', 'would', 'Joe', 'tell', 'family', 'How', 'would', 'kids', 'react', 'How', 'will', 'couple', 'come', 'grips', 'trust', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'Shirley', 'infidelity', 'original', 'issues', 'abandoned', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'angles', 'explore', 'sadly', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'original', 'writer', 'Willy', 'Russel', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'insightful', 'Shirley', 'reckless', 'fashion', 'affair', 'be', 'female', 'everything', 'up', 'Shirley', 'film', 'less', 'exploration', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'contemporary', 'housewife', 'more', 'sort', 'propagandistic', 'fairy', 'tale', ""'d"", 'expect', 'average', 'Riki', 'Lake', 'audience', 'member']",N/A
258509,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301627024,Byron Kolln,"[14, 16]","SHIRLEY VALENTINE is a gentle charmer of a comedy, based on the acclaimed play by Willy Russell.  Pauline Collins (of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS fame) plays the title character, a role she received much acclaim for on the London and New York stage.Shirley Valentine is a sparky and charming yet downtrodden woman in suburban London.  Her husband thinks she's ""gone `round the pipe"", her children have left the nest,  and she leads a mostly-solitary life talking to her kitchen wall.  In the throes of what can only be described as a ""no-life mid-life crisis"" , Shirley takes off with her best friend (Alison Steadman) for a two-week holiday in Greece.  There, she has a fling with a smooth-talking bar owner (Tom Conti) and comes to know the real pleasures that life has to offer.  And, more importantly, Shirley Valentine comes to know herself.Pauline Collins turns in a fabulous performance as Shirley (she was nominated for the 1989 `Best Actress' Oscar but lost to Jessica Tandy in DRIVING MISS DAISY).Tom Conti bravely plays the thankless role of Costas, with Joanna Lumley, Sylvia Syms and Julia McKenzie all offering top performances in well-written supporting roles.

258514,AAE2DUEMTR30I,6301627024,DAVID BRYSON,"[3, 3]","This film was made in 1989, and it shows. It is about Women's Lib as personified in the story of Shirley herself, but this was the tone and idiom of much of the campaign at that time. These days the principle at least of equality of the sexes is largely recognised in theory, although I do not wish to suggest that the battle has been won by a long way. The characters in this film, even Shirley, are personified attitudes rather than real people drawn in the round. That is no criticism at all, it is just the style of the film, and in my opinion it is done very successfully. Shirley's husband and daughter are particularly insufferable, although the long-suffering Shirley puts up with them until the opportunity of a free trip to Greece gives her the chance to get away from them and her whole Liverpool environment and be her own woman for a while.The plot is very amusing at times. Don't believe anything you might read about a `relationship' between Shirley and the waiter played by Tom Conti. He has the funniest seduction line I ever heard, but he is just another animated attitude like the rest of them. If anyone comes over as a real person, it is perhaps Shirley's friend who invites her on the trip to begin with, and that is only because the part is 2-dimensional in the first place. The episode with the waiter is only an episode. It has had a lot of comment and quite understandably so, but the vignette I myself like best is the appearance of the goddess Joanna Lumley as the grown-up version of Shirley's schoolmate who had had the elocution lessons.It is very entertaining, often quite touching, and although it may have dated slightly I can recommend it wholeheartedly as an evening's home viewing. The acting by Pauline Collins, Tom Conti, the divine Ms Lumley and most of the rest of them is really very good, and the story hangs together rather well. There is one thing that I have seen emphasised in other reviews, but which I don't understand. It appears that at least one of the versions on release tries to Americanise the Scouse idiom, to the understandable horror of viewers. I myself was entertained to the show in America, and I noticed nothing of the kind, so either I missed a lot (which I don't believe) or there are versions available that have been spared this outrage. Apart from anything else, it all has some nostalgic charm, reminding me of those dear dead days 20 years ago. If you are thinking of buying the DVD I should check out the point about the Americanised dialogue first, as it certainly sounds rather appalling.

I always wanted to go but the film ""Shirley Valentine"" (1989) directed by Lewis Gilbert and written by Willy Russell (also play) with Pauline Collins has added to my desire to see the magic country.Pauline Collins reprises her Broadway's role as the hilariously charming and unpredictable 45 (or so) year old Liverpool housewife Shirley Valentine - Bradshaw whose life is the humorist Sam Levinson's lament: ""When I was a kid, they told me to do what my parents wanted. When I became a parent, they told me to do what my kids wanted. When do I get to do what I want?"" until one day she proves to herself that it is never too late to try to make your dream come true. When a friend wins the paid trip to Greece for two, Shirley joins her and finds that Greece is her dream because she always wanted to see the sunset over a blue sea. She says yes to the romance with a handsome Costas Caldes (Tom Conti) who likes her in spite her extra weight, saggy boobs and the stretch marks. She began to like herself, too. Sounds like your typical sloppy romantic comedy, ah? Wait until you see it. This is a wonderful and delightful film - clever, witty, funny, and thought-provoking.

Collins is so endearingly charming that by the time Shirley learns to love herself, the rest of us already adore her.  Whether in a plain-walled flat or an idyllic Greek Island, It is a pleasure to spend time in her company.  It's a wonderful vacation, which is why I've seen this film enough times to know nearly all the dialogue, and I've developed a fondness for chips 'n' egg.Tom Conti, effectively masking his Englishness with a greek accent, leads a perfect supporting cast.  The actors who play Shirley's son and daughter, her uppity neighbor, and the young girls who play Shirley and Marjorie Majors as teenagers, all hit the right notes.  Joanna Lumley gives a nicely understated performance (in contrast to her over-the-top comedy turns elsewhere) and Alison Steadman makes a good enough impression here that she is a welcome presence in subsequent roles like the recent CONFETTI.  Keep an eye out for Bernard Hill as Shirley's thoughtless husband - after ignoring Shirley, it seems only fitting that he go down at the helm of the TITANIC...I wish Paramount had made the effort to include some extras, like a commentary with Collins, or a followup on the girl who so perfectly played young Shirley...  at least they've included the original soundtrack with the British brand names and vernacular that were overdubbed for America.  Paramount has again ignored very attractive original key (poster) art that effectively conveyed the spirit of the film, in favor of a bland cover that looks like a People magazine - and about a million other DVDs.

Now she's Shirley Bradshaw, a 42-year-old housewife with 2 grown kids and a husband she feels doesn't love her anymore.

I was young and did what I thought I was expected to do, got married to a ""nice, dependable guy"" had a very good job but, I felt trapped and getting out of bed to fulfill that expected life was almost too much to handle.  One day, this movie happened to come on and I watched it, just because I didn't have anything else to do.  After I heard her say, ""Why does God give us all of these feelings?....I've lived such a little life...""  I determined it was time to make a change.  I used to drive home from work and consider suicide.  That was more than twenty years ago.  I really needed to hear what Shirley had to say and I am amazed that a movie had such a powerful effect on my life.This movie is WONDERFUL!  Pauline Collins, Bernard Hill and Tom Conti are superb and give a depth to these characters that I can't imagine other actors approaching by half.  The story is whimsical, wicked and heartbreaking at times.  I think almost every woman and most men will be able to relate to this story.  We all begin our adult lives with dreams, goals, and wishes.  For most people, as life happens, we settle for what we have instead of what we really want.  This story is about finally saying, I want more, I've done what's necessary, now it's my turn again.Take the time to watch this movie, it will open your eyes to the life you still have.
