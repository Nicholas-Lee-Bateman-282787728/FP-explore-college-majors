1361251,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B003S1UNYQ,Baberufus,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed watching most of this video, as it reminds me of the Tom Dowd biopic, where a ""behind the scenes"" guy finally gets some recognition of his own! I used to cover my walls with guitar player posters, and I remember seeing how so many of them listed ""Robert Knight"" as the credited photographer. It intrigued me, causing me to think, ""Man, this guy got around!"" Well, this video tells his story!However, I agree with other reviewers in that a little too much focus in this video is placed on Robert's ""new finds."" Actually, I didn't really mind seeing the in-depth story of his discovery of Tyler Dow Bryant, especially considering that Tyler's mom is incredibly hot, but I too am disappointed that there wasn't more storytelling about how he came about snapping his more legendary photos of Hendrix, Vaughan, Zeppelin, etc. Also, it must be disappointing for Mr. Knight that Tyler Dow Bryant has not exactly exploded onto the scene. Sure, he's a talented musician, but I couldn't even find one album of his for sale on Amazon--just an mp3 single, that's all. What happened? This was about 2 years ago, right? Within another couple of years, he'll no longer be a teenager, and there goes his ""teenage prodigy"" marketing moniker right out the window. Too bad.I get my feathers ruffled when I hear ""THE NEXT STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN""...there is NEVER going to be the next Stevie Ray Vaughan. But of course, some things said in the video in reference to Bryant make that implication. In fact, SRV's legendary ex-Road Manager Cutter Vandenberg makes an appearance in the film with Tyler, and claims that Tyler's fingers are just like Stevie's...I haven't seen Tyler's or Stevie's hands in person like Cutter has, but I nevertheless wonder if all this talk is just a lot of hoopla for the film. Knight meets with a couple of high-profile producers to sell them on Tyler (one of whom is Kevin Shirley, Joe B.'s producer). They both act (no pun intended) highly interested...well, where is the album either one of them has produced? I can't find it.Personally, I don't hear too much of Stevie in Tyler's playing, anyway. He's really good, sure, but his style on the electric seems to lean more to rock than blues, and from what I've heard so far, he's nowhere near the league of Satriani or Vai. Is he going to turn the guitar world (especially the blues guitar world) on its ear like Stevie did? I highly doubt that. Knight then goes onto cite Joe Bonamassa as a previous teenage guitar prodigy who faced career decisions early in life similar to Tyler's. Good point, and may I say, Joe Bonamassa has come closer to matching SRV's impact on the music world than Bryant (so far, anyway), and even Joe is not exactly the ""next SRV"". And again, no one is! If Robert Knight thinks he's going to top--or even come close to equalling--the importance of his success with Hendrix and Vaughan, then I think he's up in the Knight! Sorry, couldn't resist! :-)But anyway, complaints aside, I did enjoy this documentary, and was glad I could finally ""meet"" this name captioned on all those famous photos!",4,Robert Knight gets his deserved attention...,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,3085,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'most', 'video', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'biopic', 'where', 'scenes', 'guy', 'finally', 'recognition', 'own', 'used', 'cover', 'walls', 'guitar', 'player', 'posters', 'remember', 'seeing', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'listed', 'Robert', 'Knight', 'credited', 'photographer', 'intrigued', 'causing', 'think', 'Man', 'guy', 'got', 'around', 'Well', 'video', 'story', 'However', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'video', 'placed', 'Robert', 'new', 'finds', 'Actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'seeing', 'in-depth', 'story', 'discovery', 'Tyler', 'Dow', 'Bryant', 'especially', 'considering', 'Tyler', 'mom', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'too', 'am', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'storytelling', 'how', 'came', 'snapping', 'more', 'legendary', 'photos', 'Hendrix', 'Vaughan', 'Zeppelin', 'etc', 'Also', 'must', 'be', 'disappointing', 'Mr.', 'Knight', 'Tyler', 'Dow', 'Bryant', 'not', 'exactly', 'exploded', 'scene', 'Sure', 'talented', 'musician', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'one', 'album', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'just', 'mp3', 'single', 'What', 'happened', 'was', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'right', 'couple', 'years', ""'ll"", 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'teenager', 'there', 'teenage', 'prodigy', 'marketing', 'moniker', 'right', 'out', 'window', 'Too', 'bad.I', 'get', 'feathers', 'ruffled', 'when', 'hear', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'STEVIE', 'RAY', 'VAUGHAN', 'NEVER', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'course', 'things', 'said', 'video', 'reference', 'Bryant', 'make', 'implication', 'fact', 'SRV', 'legendary', 'ex-Road', 'Manager', 'Cutter', 'Vandenberg', 'appearance', 'film', 'Tyler', 'claims', 'Tyler', 'fingers', 'are', 'just', 'Stevie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Tyler', 'Stevie', 'hands', 'person', 'Cutter', 'nevertheless', 'wonder', 'talk', 'just', 'lot', 'hoopla', 'film', 'Knight', 'couple', 'high-profile', 'producers', 'sell', 'Tyler', 'one', 'whom', 'Kevin', 'Shirley', 'Joe', 'B', 'producer', 'act', 'pun', 'intended', 'highly', 'interested', 'well', 'where', 'album', 'one', 'produced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'it.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'too', 'much', 'Stevie', 'Tyler', 'playing', 'anyway', 'really', 'good', 'sure', 'style', 'electric', 'lean', 'more', 'rock', 'blues', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'far', 'nowhere', 'league', 'Satriani', 'Vai', 'going', 'turn', 'guitar', 'world', 'especially', 'blues', 'guitar', 'world', 'ear', 'Stevie', 'did', 'highly', 'doubt', 'Knight', 'then', 'cite', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'previous', 'teenage', 'guitar', 'prodigy', 'who', 'faced', 'career', 'decisions', 'early', 'life', 'similar', 'Tyler', 'Good', 'point', 'may', 'say', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'come', 'closer', 'matching', 'SRV', 'impact', 'music', 'world', 'Bryant', 'so', 'far', 'anyway', 'even', 'Joe', 'not', 'exactly', 'next', 'SRV', 'again', 'one', 'Robert', 'Knight', 'going', 'top', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'equalling', 'importance', 'success', 'Hendrix', 'Vaughan', 'then', 'think', 'up', 'Knight', 'Sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'anyway', 'complaints', 'did', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'was', 'glad', 'could', 'finally', 'meet', 'name', 'captioned', 'famous', 'photos']",Rock Prophecies

1361253,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B003S1UNYQ,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","The film ends with Knight being honored for his decades of work and being feted by Slash, the guitarist from Guns-N-Roses and Velvet Revolver. It's a nice contrast to such dour rock documentary as that seen in The Mayor Of The Sunset Strip, wherein another middle aged hanger-on to the stars is featured. In that film, the main subject is a deluded and sad DJ, Rodney Bingenheimer, barely clinging on to fame, and whose life is portrayed as lonely and sad, and he, too, has to deal with an aging and dying mother. But that film is more predictable, and plays off of stereotypes that it almost goes out of the way to embody. By contrast, this film does not do that, even though, in an online interview director Chester claims he had so much footage he could have made another film; one wherein Knight's obsessions with UFOs and conspiracies (augmented with footage of Knight at the infamous Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada) could have been the focus. I, however, am glad the film did not go there. First, it would have made Knight look wackier than he already is- an old man still going to rock concerts. Second, it would have just fed the same sorts of stereotypes that abound about obsessive folks, and those involved in the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle, as total lunatics. The emphasis on a son's desire to care for his mother, and seeing footage of the two of them together, is far more powerful, especially when seeing how contently oblivious his mother is. Alzheimer's is a disease that does not pain, only destroys.Having said that, Knight is a bit of an oddball, as he recounts the last day of his friend Stevie Ray Vaughn's life, in 1990, before the famed guitar hero died in a plane crash: `If anything ever happens, you'll know me when you hear me.' Hence, Knight's pursuit of the gifted Tyler Dow Bryant, who, himself, longs to be the greatest guitarist that ever lived. But, he's still several steps above Rodney Bingenheimer, or any of the other social misfits that populate typical rock documentaries, and which were so brilliantly skewered in Rob Reiner's This Is Spinal Tap. Other musicians that appear and/or are interviewed in the film include Aerosmith, Jeff Beck, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana, ZZ Top, Def Leppard, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Joe Bonamassa. The film is a straightforward look at the life and dilemma that befalls Knight, so don't expect any great cinematography, not editing tricks. Do expect a satisfying look into the rock world, but an even more interesting look away into the real world at its edges. Robert Knight is not a great photographer, but he is an interesting human being, and this film's success relies on the latter, because the former, while it might be interesting to learn the finer points of the craft, would likely have been an exercise in tedium. What this film gives us is the medium. And with that you get the man.",3,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2876,"['film', 'Knight', 'being', 'honored', 'decades', 'work', 'being', 'feted', 'Slash', 'guitarist', 'Guns-N-Roses', 'Velvet', 'Revolver', 'nice', 'contrast', 'such', 'dour', 'rock', 'documentary', 'seen', 'Mayor', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'middle', 'aged', 'hanger-on', 'stars', 'featured', 'film', 'main', 'subject', 'deluded', 'sad', 'DJ', 'Rodney', 'Bingenheimer', 'barely', 'clinging', 'fame', 'life', 'portrayed', 'lonely', 'sad', 'too', 'deal', 'aging', 'dying', 'mother', 'film', 'more', 'predictable', 'stereotypes', 'almost', 'way', 'embody', 'contrast', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'even', 'online', 'interview', 'director', 'Chester', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'wherein', 'Knight', 'obsessions', 'UFOs', 'conspiracies', 'augmented', 'footage', 'Knight', 'infamous', 'Area', '51', 'Groom', 'Lake', 'Nevada', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'however', 'am', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'there', 'First', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Knight', 'look', 'wackier', 'already', 'is-', 'old', 'man', 'still', 'going', 'rock', 'concerts', 'Second', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'fed', 'same', 'sorts', 'stereotypes', 'abound', 'obsessive', 'folks', 'involved', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'lifestyle', 'total', 'lunatics', 'emphasis', 'son', 'desire', 'care', 'mother', 'seeing', 'footage', 'two', 'together', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'especially', 'when', 'seeing', 'how', 'contently', 'oblivious', 'mother', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'not', 'pain', 'only', 'destroys.Having', 'said', 'Knight', 'bit', 'oddball', 'last', 'day', 'friend', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughn', 'life', '1990', 'famed', 'guitar', 'hero', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'anything', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'Hence', 'Knight', 'pursuit', 'gifted', 'Tyler', 'Dow', 'Bryant', 'who', 'longs', 'be', 'greatest', 'guitarist', 'ever', 'lived', 'still', 'several', 'steps', 'Rodney', 'Bingenheimer', 'other', 'social', 'misfits', 'populate', 'typical', 'rock', 'documentaries', 'were', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'skewered', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Other', 'musicians', 'appear', 'and/or', 'are', 'interviewed', 'film', 'include', 'Aerosmith', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'ZZ', 'Top', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'Kenny', 'Wayne', 'Shepherd', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'film', 'straightforward', 'look', 'life', 'dilemma', 'Knight', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'cinematography', 'not', 'editing', 'tricks', 'Do', 'expect', 'satisfying', 'look', 'rock', 'world', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'look', 'away', 'real', 'world', 'edges', 'Robert', 'Knight', 'not', 'great', 'photographer', 'interesting', 'human', 'being', 'film', 'success', 'relies', 'latter', 'former', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'learn', 'finer', 'points', 'craft', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'exercise', 'tedium', 'What', 'film', 'medium', 'get', 'man']",Rock Prophecies

I was so pleased to view this documentary of the photography of Robert Klein (photographer of the last concert of Vaughan).

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[18, 21]","I'm not sure who came up with the title of this rock music documentary but it will certainly confuse folks. The 80-minute film will be shown on many PBS stations during the fall. Even reading the press description I wasn't sure what to expect and even while watching it, the film changed directions a lot. But that's a good thing. There are really three different focuses to Direct John Chester's 2009 film - which won audience awards at a number of regional film festivals.On its surface the film is a documentary about 60-year-old rock photographer Robert Knight. This is the guy who, not only took the last concert photos of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn, but also shot many iconic photos for album covers and the Guitar World instrument stores. As he self-narrates the film, you begin to feel the guy has one heck of an ego. He takes us to visit rock guitar icons (he specializes in guitarists) like Jeff Beck, Slash and Carlos Santana. Next we hear how he loves to ""discover"" bands and we see how he took an unknown band from Australia, Sick Puppies, and, by using his contacts in the music industry got them a record contract and a Top 10 hit.  This, and the story of a 16-year old electric guitar prodigy who  Knight makes connections for, form the middle part of the film. But there's a non-musical undertone to the story as we meet Knight's mother who has Alzheimer's Disease and is running up huge medical bills. Why this part of the story is important forms the third ""act"" in the film's story arc. And I'll leave that for you to discover. Its much more interesting if you don't know in advance.If you are a guitar player you will definitely want to see this film. If you are a music fan, you'll probably to as well. But even the casual record collector will find himself or herself drawn in to the story. And there's a unique Jimi Hendrix connection that will interest Hendrix fans.The bonus features are well done as well. I did not listen to the director's commentary so I can't judge that but the ""Deleted scenes"" offer even more insightful comments from Beck, Santana, Steve Vai and some delicious stories from the recently deceased photographer Jim Marshall. I guess they were deleted because of length but they are wonderful.This film is certainly a departure from normal PBS shows but it may help them reach a new generation.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Don't let the title confuse you.

I didn't think either performer brought anything new or particularly interesting to the table.  Knight seems like a good guy, but there is a more interesting story here (with regard to his iconic photos) that simply wasn't told.
