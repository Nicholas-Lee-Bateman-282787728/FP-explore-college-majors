968187,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B000E5KQNM,Aryael de Kaprii,"[1, 1]","I am really not sure what this movie is about. It starts out talking about this boy who lives in a shack (I guess) with his mother -there seems to be only one room in this whole shack and there is a bed. The boy sleeps in the bed with his mother. Through out the movie the only part of his mother that is shown is her long fingernails. She apparently sleeps all day all the time. The story never fully developes around that particular, odd issue but instead moves on with the boy hanging out with a rough bunch of surfers and skaters. He tags along with one of his friends to pick up the friend's brother who he seems to have a small crush on, but it isnt obvious.  So basically this movie revolves around this relationshp and the secrets that are revealed regarding a relationship the brother had with his highschool teacher.  I dont know what it is about this movie I like, the ending really bothered me.  Still I couldnt help but to want to watch it again and again -so I bought it. There is something gripping about it.

I still wasnt quite sure whether i should take the plunge and purchase it.  I did and i will say that while it wasnt the best gay themed movie i've seen.  It is still pretty good in its own rights.  With the lead character falling for his best friends brother Cass.  Who's just come back into after being away for four years.  You find out why later on in the film and it made me understand a bit better why dude bolted the way he did.  His parents are a mess and i couldn't help but feel for not only Cass but his younger brothers that still has to live with them as well.The lead guy has some issues of his own...sleeping in the same bed with your mom, might be cool when your 3 or 4.  But he's 16/17 years old thats all kinds of creepy to me.  But he likes Cass a lot and they have their thing going on.  But he has this little side job that he describes as ""gardening"", i'll leave it at that and you'll find out exactly what's really going on with that job of his.  Plus their is a girl interest in the movie as well whom the lead guy rebuffs time after time..but then suddenly changes his mind on getting with her.  Don't quite understand that myself but again i dont want to give everything about the movie away.  But for the most part the story centers around him, Cass, his younger bro, a couple friends and the professor at the school Cass went to.Thats a whole different thing in of itself but also fits into why Cass rolled out of town in a hurry.  I can't even lie after seeing this movie.  Also check out the ending as well that offers a nice little surprise and twist that i didnt see coming.I know that i made the right choice picking this one up...don't let them fool you.  Tan Lines has more to offer than even i thought..be on the lookout and at the very least give it a rent to see.  If its the movie that you want to put your hard earned cash on.Either way, hope you enjoy the movie and that the review helped you make a choice one way or the other.

People seem to have trouble growing up and leaving their idyllic seaside surfer village.  ""Where else would you find the waves""?Midget admires Cass, who has returned briefly after a mysterious absence, and hopes that by becoming Cass' lover, he and Cass might leave together.  When Cass disappoints Midget, the latter tries alternatives.The results are unexpected and romantically satisfying.  Midget's encounters with a young woman are surreal and surprising, to say the least. Gayness seems natural and honest in this world, and nothing either to fuss over and extol, or to fear.Of course, nobody seems to need to earn a living in this world, so people can focus on how they feel, and how they look.I say 4 stars not 5 because there has to be some room for films like Memento and Road Warrior to merit 5.
