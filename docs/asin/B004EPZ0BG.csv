1404255,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPZ0BG,A kids review,"[0, 2]","Some fuss was made earlier this year when the two stars of Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed Black Swan separately appeared in two films with identical themes and equally obvious titles: first, Natalie Portman starred in No Strings Attached, and a few months later, Mila Kunis starred in Friends with Benefits. Both explored the inevitable complications that arise in sex-only relationships, but while the former was not very good, Friends with Benefits impressed me to the tune of 3 stars. Here, Kunis plays a corporate headhunter who recruits a hotshot art director from California for a job at GQ magazine in New York. The two immediately hit it off and agree to engage in a no-strings-attached relationship of pure sex until they begin to realize they're both falling for each other. So what made this film so much better than the Natalie Portman flick? The chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake is natural and immensely effective, almost carrying the movie by itself.

1404284,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B004EPZ0BG,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[53, 63]","""Friends with Benefits"" has a lightning fast, very smart script, it moves like a limousine, and it features another stunningly moving character turn by Richard Jenkins. It's good enough that it revives hope for that troubled genre, the Romantic Comedy. It's worth seeing, more than once.""Friends with Benefits"" surprised me. I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is famous - what is remarkable about him, really? - and Mila Kunis does nothing for me. We live in the age of decline of the Romantic Comedy. ""Friends with Benefits"" was not the forgettable, rote, mass-produced studio product I expected. It was actually really good.""Friends with Benefits"" began really fast, and I found myself bobbing along on the script's energy. I noticed how much I was enjoying it and I kept waiting for the film to drop the ball, to let me down, to betray itself, to fall into predictable clich&eacute;d traps. That didn't happen for quite a while, and the film's failings were slow in coming, minor, and didn't ruin the film.What ""Friends with Benefits"" does right it does very, very right. The script is amazing. There are jokes that you'd need some literacy and maturity to understand. They fly right by, no pause for the viewer to laugh, or to google the references, before the next one-liner or trenchant observation rolls down the chute. Our culture has been so dumbed down that hearing a joke that one would have to have some knowledge of history or culture or even just the front page of the newspaper to understand amazed and gratified me.The movie's strong point is that it is so fast; that's also a bit of a weak point. Legendary director Frank Capra said that ""sometimes your story has to stop and you just let your audience look at your people. You want your audience to like them...these scenes are quite important to a film. When the audience rests and they look at the people, they begin to smile."" ""Friends with Benefits"" is so frenetic, it never creates a memorable screen moment where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin.Richard Jenkins works some powerful mojo. He's a character actor, older, bland-looking and bald, but in every movie I've seen him in lately, especially so in ""Eat Pray Love,"" he seems to be visiting from a different, better movie, and I want, after the movie I'm watching is over, to watch the superior film from which Jenkins has visited. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Jenkins plays Dylan's father who is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's. He is funny, profound, arresting and truly lovable. What is Jenkins doing? Whatever it is, more actors should do it.Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Nolan Gould and Masi Oka are all very, very good in supporting roles. Clarkson, as Jamie's mother, delivers a liner about Jamie's father that made me laugh out loud.On the surface, ""Friends with Benefits"" looks like too many other, lesser movies. It's not. It's a really good, worthwhile film.",5,Surprisingly Good.

1404292,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004EPZ0BG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","Filmmaker Will Gluck (""Easy A"", ""The Loop"") is back with a romantic comedy titled ""Friends With Benefits"".Featuring a story by Harley Peyton, Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, the film would feature an all-star ensemble cast starring Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"", ""That '70s Show"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), Justin Timberlake (""In Time"", ""Bad Teacher"", ""The Social Network""), Bryan Greenberg (""Bride Wars"", ""The Perfect Score""), Jenna Elfman (""Dharma & Greg"", ""Keeping the Faith"", ""Edtv""), Woody Harrelson (""Cheers"", ""Zombieland"", ""Natural Born Killers""), Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"", ""Step Brothers"", ""Burn After Reading"") and Patricia Clarkson (""The Green Mile"", ""Shutter Island"").The film was well-received by film critics and the $35 million film would go on to make $149 million in the box office.VIDEO:""Friends with Benefits"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The picture quality of the film is very good.  Shot digitally, it is obvious that the goal of cinematographer Michael Grady (""Easy A"", ""Notorious"", ""Faster"")  was to capture the beauty of New York City and Los Angeles.  These scenes are absolutely beautiful and really capture the life of the city through the details of the city and the vibrant colors.Skin tones are natural, black levels are deep and I detected no banding, artifacts or any problems.  ""Friends with Benefits"" looks fantastic in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Friends with Benefits"" is presented in English, French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish, English - Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue and musically driven as one would expect from a romantic comedy.  There are moments such as the airport scene giving more ambiance to the film but for a romantic comedy, this film sports crystal clear dialogue and bass thumping music ala Kriss Kross' ""Jump"" and Foster the Parents ""Pumped Up Kids"".But for the most part, the lossless soundtrack works for this romantic comedy and the dialogue and music are crystal clear!SPECIAL FEATURES""Friends with Benefits"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Writer/Director Will Gluck, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis - A fun and hilarious audio commentary with the two main stars and director Will Gluck.  Both have fun telling jokes, cussing and just having fun discussing the film.Bonus Benefits: A Pop-Up Trivia Track - A Blu-ray exclusive.  While watching the film, you can have various trivia showing onscreen while watching the film.Deleted Scenes - (8:49)  Featuring ten deleted scenes (Superheroes on Hollywood Blvd, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Creative Meeting, GQ Party, Let's Stay Friends, Shower Cap, Hollywood Tour, Princess and the Pony, Dylan Tries to Call Jamie, and Twin Pythons) with optional writer and director commentary.Outtakes - (6:40) Featuring outtakes from ""Friends with Benefits"".On Set With FWB - (5:39) A Blu-ray exclusive featurette featuring an interview with the cast and crew about working on the set of ""Friends with Benefits"", shooting in New York City and Los Angeles.In A Flash: Choreographing A Mob - (5:48) A Blu-ray exclusive featurette on how the flash mob scenes were created.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to romantic comedies, especially sex comedies...sometimes the storyline features bad breakups, rebound relationships but for the most part, comedies that you can sense how things will end right from the beginning.And while the ending for this film fit the banality of other romantic comedies, its how the two protagonists get to that final point.  And for a film title such as ""Friends with Benefits"", you expect a film to showcase quite a bit of sex.  For the most part, you get a lot of good scenes with both Timberlake and Kunis in bed (note: Justin Timberlake does do his first rear nude scene while Kunis used a body double) and experimenting with each other and having fun!  But fortunately, this is not the dominating factor of the film.The film focuses on their emotional attachment to each other, knowing that they have feelings for each other but they are so scared about how their relationships have ended in the past, that being ""friends with benefits"" would alleviate them from having any emotional attachment.  And instead of rushing into those emotions that the two have with each other, we see the journey as the two try to have flings with other people and then of course, when Jamie (Kunis) goes to Los Angeles to meet with his family, things happen that separates the two.And the chemistry between both Timberlake and Kunis was very well done!  In fact, I found the two much more believable onscreen than Timberlake had with Cameron Diaz on ""Bad Teacher"".  The two looked right for each other and I was quite pleased to see how Timberlake has evolved as an actor and the same for actress Mila Kunis.  Both did a wonderful job!And the supporting cast were also just as good, especially Patricia Clarkson as Lorna, the mother of Jamie but also a woman who has had a problematic sexual past.  Woody Harrelson as the gay co-worker named Tommy who is constantly asking Dylan if he is really gay, Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father who has alzheimer's and has a habit of pulling down his trousers and Jenna Elfman as Dylan's sister Annie.  Even the short appearances by Jason Segel and Rashida Jones (who star on a cheesy Hollywood romance story), as well as Andy Samberg and Emma Stone were fun to watch!But one thing I love about romantic films is when they can capture the city the characters talk so much about.  If you talk about New York City, I want to see New York City as much as they can show on the film.  The same with Los Angeles and the film manages to showcase both cities quite well. I also liked how the film's storyline took a jab at the usual Hollywood romantic comedy and showing that although Hollywood romantic comedies tend to have the fairytale story, not all are realistic and ""Friends with Benefits"" is a film that tries to keep things real!  I dig that!As for the Blu-ray release, there are two available on release date.  One with a DVD and Ultraviolet copy and the regular Blu-ray release with no DVD and UV copy.  The special features were entertaining especially the audio commentary which was hilarious as well as the included outtakes.  Also, it was interesting to learn about the challenges of shooting in NYC and Los Angeles and also choreographing the flash mob scenes.  The picture quality was vibrant and the on-location scenery shots of NYC and LA were awesome and audio quality was appropriate for this film.Overall, ""Friends with Benefits"" is a charming, sexy and fun romantic comedy featuring a wonderful performance by Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a romantic comedy capturing both the beauty of love in New York City and Los Angeles by keeping things real!""Friends with Benefits"" is recommended!",4,Blu-ray: A romantic comedy capturing both the beauty of love in New York City and Los Angeles by keeping things real!,1323993600,"12 16,

It's good date night material being primarily a romantic comedy. Of course you basically know what you're going to get with this sort of thing.And really there were no great surprises. Mainly the thin plot is carried by the charisma of the two leads, who did a good job I thought of making you want to like them.In the early stages it was a bit _edgier_ than the average romcom which was fun, but that did rather fizzle out later on. Leaving me to feel it could have been something more than it ended up being. The depictions of their frank sexual discussions early on about what they like or don't like probably rang more true than anything else in the movie.The dialogue was snappy too. More so than your average romcom and it makes a change from the endless parades of _dumb comedy_ movies. There were even some nice pop culture digs slipped in unobtrusively.But of course it ended up playing safe. They didn't stay as FWB. We knew they weren't going to. They felt something deeper. Etc. etc.That's fine. I enjoy sappy happy endings for this sort of movie anyway.

I think I just threw up in my mouth. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have landed some good roles to distance themselves from the banal and overtly commercial. They then did this movie. Keep these two apart from now on, please!Without giving away too much, this movie has one of best and one of the worst sex scenes. The first sex scene is funny, realistic in the awkwardness and that is truly sexy. The second is smarmy, over-the-top stylized psuedo-porn. This is important because it at the end of the first sex scene that the two lovers joke about Rom-Coms and the use of too many indie songs. The second scene is just plain insulting to the audience, showing us no respect.So what does the Director do? Overload the soundtrack with wall-to wall wishy-washy indie songs that you are now conscious of it the entire time. It is unbarable in the extreme! Any charming aspect to characters is out the window, as this movie sinks into monotony and stereotypes. The humour goes out the window, and the ending was unapologetically vapid and cliche. Another way this movie robs the characters of sympathy, is by placing them in the upper-middle to upper class. ""Oh, I've got too much money to be happy in a committed relationship"".If you like 90 minutes of upper class twit self-pity wrapped in an unfunny Rom-Com.

And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman  and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate.  Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy  Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping.

Here, both characters are on the rebound, which in most movies would have them avoiding relationships.  In this instance they decide to have a sexual relationship without entanglements.  Woody Harrelson plays a humorous gay character, and of course in many ways what the main characters are doing is having a gay relationship, since the idea of pregnancy or any other serious consequences never comes up.  A lot of historic characters had such relationships:  Don Juan comes to mind.  Baron Von Munchausen even flirted with the Queen of The Moon, and turned down the hand of Catherine The Great.  But those were love affairs of men.It's the 21st Century, so  Hollywood has given us two young adults (four if you count ""No Strings Attached"") where the man is everything polls tell us women want, yet the woman doesn't want anything more from him than sex.  Well, of course, they fall in love by the end of the film and everything gets messed up, but what can I say?  No spoilers here.Fast moving, at times scenic, quite contemporary (meaning that in the future it will be interesting to watch for it's depiction of our times, flash mobs and the like) and sexy without being erotic, it's no ""Sex and Lucia"", not by a long shot.

Aside from being absolutely predictable, it didn't move me in the least.  I found it hard to sympathize or root for any of the characters, which is sad because it was not as though one was opposing the other, so ideally I should have been rooting for them as a couple.  Their inexcusable immaturity and poor decisions made it difficult for me to feel bad for them.Also, I know the little bit about Dylan's father (and mother) was supposed to be heart-wrenching and compelling, and it really was not.  I couldn't help rolling my eyes because it was obviously put in there by the writer(s) to make Dylan less 1-dimensional--so we could see where he's coming from.  Honestly, I couldn't see past the beachfront view and his job at GQ.  All I got from this movie was that (1) ""my life is not perfect"": rich, attractive people have problems too--duh and (2) sex is never just sex--even if it starts off not meaning anything, it'll always means more.  Now, I'm really being generous as far as saying that's what I got from the movie when really I should say that that's what the movie attempted to convey in more time than it really needed to.

Honestly!It's almost like Hollywood has ran out of ideas when it comes to making Romantic Comedies or Chick Flicks. It's always the same exact formula. Boy meets Girl, Boy hates/dislikes Girl, Girl hates/dislikes Boy, Boy + Girl get to spend some unwanted quality time together. Boy + Girl hook up/date whatever. Boy + Girl fight/quarrel. Boy + Girl end the relationship and then in the last 10 minutes of the movie one or the other realizes they just can't do without that person, runs back to them, declare their undying love, apologizes for being a total jerk etc.... The other forgives them and then....Booom They live happily ever after. The End !How many times, do we need to see the same story but with different actors/leading roles ?

1404324,A211TYB51TIZ6Q,B004EPZ0BG,"J. McQueen ""Anti-Charisma""","[3, 3]","Let's cut to the chase. This film has 3 things going for it that makes it a pretty good romantic comedy --(1) Chemistry:  Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake interact with each other so well on-screen that at the end of the film you wonder if they ever were a couple in real-life. Their flirtations don't seem forced; their body language is in sync and they seem, at times to be oblivious to the rest of the world (or at least the cameras) in their scenes together.(2) A Strong Supporting Cast: This movie has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to its supporting cast. Richard Jenkins is phenomenal in his role as Timberlake's on-screen dad. And it's a difficult part. He is asked to play a man who is struggling mightily with a life-altering situation but is trying to live with it with all the grace and wit that he can still muster.  Patricia Clarkson, was excellent as well as Mila Kunis's wildly inappropriate mom. (In fact, her character helps the audience understand why her daughter grew up to be such a tightly-wound, Type- A adult.) But, all of the supporting actors, Woody Harrelson was the star. Playing a sexually-aggressive sports editor, he slyly murmurs off-color lines with fantastic comedic timing but also manages to be the film's thought-provoking voice of reason.(3) A Real Script:  At their worst, romantic comedies are mind-numbingly predictable. Many recycle the same plot, plug-in random actors and actresses and simply expect audiences to flock to the theatres. Hollywood seems to be saying ""hey, I know you have seen `50 First Dates' but we are rolling out a new version starring Luke Wilson and (whoever the `It- Girl of the Moment' is) that you must see."" While we may never be able to escape the same ol' storyline (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy eventually wins girl back by doing something both ludicrous and sweet), this film does its best to try a few new things and it deserves credit for that.In conclusion, does this movie rival the 90s classics like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Pretty Woman"" or even Mila Kunis's prior outstanding film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""?

1404326,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B004EPZ0BG,John's Horror Corner,"[9, 11]","The story follows Dylan, an artistic web designer turned GQ artistic director by Jamie, a NY head hunter, as he moves to NY and they form a friendship...and then some.  The first few minutes gave the writers a chance to prove that you weren't wasting your time with this movie.  We are monsooned by a clever mix of classic and rather risqu&eacute; anecdotal break-up quips as both Dylan (the ever-charming Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (the saucy Mila Kunis) both find themselves single again via synchronous break-ups.  They both make the same claim: that they'll essentially be sexually aloof and just enjoy themselves.For some reason the movie depicts LA folks like they're from some kind of cow town--extra cautious about crossing the street, mild-mannered, socially nave, non-confrontational and claustrophobic in the skyscraper-rich concrete jungle.  Likewise, New Yorkers come off as more in-your-face and edgy.  I really think of LA as sort of a drier NY with a tan, but otherwise city folks are city folks.  Despite the constant flinging of pro-NY propaganda both actors are their naturally charismatic, audience-pleasing selves.The first (sex) scene that lives up to the movie's title is a hilariously endearing and very chatty session which seems like a rehearsal before filming a how-to instructional video on sex.  Great moments of this movie include a sex scene montage with a lot of well-placed and relatable dialogue, Woody Harrelson thinking JT is gay, every single Shaun White cameo scene, JT rapping and busting out some old school Criss Cross, and Woody Harrelson choosing Shaun White over Barrack Obama for a GQ cover.  Yup, that's what America has been reduced to.With small roles, the brilliantly cast Jenna Elfman (Dharma & Greg), Nolan Gould (TV's Modern Family), and Richard Jenkins (HBO's Six Feet Under, Burn After Reading) are the sister, nephew and father you want to bring a girl home to meet.  All actors do a perfect job of showing us that they see what Dylan and Jamie don't.  It reminds me of my own friends waving their hands at me saying ""it's nothing serious"" or ""we're just friends"" and then getting a wedding invitation a year later.  It's so cute when they don't see it yet, isn't it?Kunis and Timberlake's on screen chemistry is so strong that it just made me feel good whenever they were interacting with one another.  The movie gets tactfully real a bit towards the end, but it should come as no spoiler alert that you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end.

1404327,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPZ0BG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Friends with Benefits is the second romantic-comedy of 2011 to cover the topic of the title and is directed and co-written by Will Gluck, whose previous film Easy A was a charming and genuinely funny high-school movie that pushed Emma Stone into the big leagues overnight. Debuting in theatres only six months after the Ivan Reitman's No Strings Attached, both movies deal with the subject of young characters wanting to enjoy a sexual relationship without any emotional attachment or commitment. Comparing and contrasting the two are inevitable. There's no denying that both films are similar and coincidentally the female leads in the separate films are played by Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, co-stars in last year's Black Swan. The similarities are a forgivable transgression since every rom-com that comes out of Hollywood is essentially cut from the same cloth anyway. So, in case the plot isn't completely obvious from the title, here's the synopsis:In Los Angeles, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is dumped by his girlfriend (a brief appearance by Emma Stone) because he's ""emotionally unavailable."" In New York, Jamie (Mila Kunis) is dumped by her boyfriend (Andy Samberg) because she's ""emotionally damaged."" Soon after, Dylan is on a flight to New York where Jamie, an Executive Recruiter, has secured a job interview for him at GQ. Dylan accepts the job and quickly becomes friends with Jamie. One night the two launch into a diatribe about how sex is necessary but seemingly impossible without emotional involvement. The two come to a mutual conclusion and make a deal; they will have sex with each other with no commitment, just as friends. You can imagine where the story goes from here. The film boasts an impressive cast that includes Woody Harrelson as Tommy, a gay sports editor for GQ as well as Richard Jenkins, Patricia Clarkson, and Jenna Elfman. There are also cameo appearances by Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, and Shaun White.Being released in such close proximity with each other, comparisons between this and No Strings Attached are inevitable. Having seen both movies, I give this one the upper hand. Neither makes any profound statements about relationships or sex, neither are great movies, but Friends with Benefits has more going for it than No Strings Attached, beginning with the chemistry between the two leads. Timberlake and Kunis have far more convincing and striking chemistry than Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher possibly due to Gluck working with Timberlake and Kunis to help shape the characters and the script. Putting more work into this kind of film than necessary, this effort does not go unnoticed onscreen. Romantic comedies live and die by the chemistry shared by the two leads and Timberlake and Kunis have chemistry in spades. They are effortlessly charming with one another and skillfully play off each other's comedic strengths. I was immensely impressed by Timberlake's performance in The Social Network, but found myself underwhelmed by his awkward performance in Bad Teacher. He redeems himself here with his boyish charm and wit. It's easy to accept him as the successful, sensitive young man he portrays.Harrelson's flamboyant and plain-spoken gay character provides some laughs, but the joke is dragged out longer than necessary. Clarkson, a tremendous actress, brings a quirky sense of humor to her part, although the personality of her character isn't too far separated from her character in Easy A. I'd guess that the character was adjusted to suit her simply because Gluck enjoyed working with her previously. Clarkson and Harrelson do not elevate the material, but they do make it a little livelier.Friends with Benefits doesn't push the romantic comedy genre too far from its comfort zone. The studio allowed it to be rated R and, with this subject matter, I respect the decision to not cop out with a PG-13. Even with the rating, the sex talk is much more graphic than the sex actually portrayed onscreen. If you take any PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedy and add some dry humping, you'll end up with Friends with Benefits. If Gluck really wanted people to differentiate between his film and Reitman's, he could've been a little more fearless in what he chose to show. The most maddening thing about the movie is that characters openly discuss how every romantic-comedy is the same, following the same meet, fall in love, break up, and get back together pattern. They even discuss the way these films use obnoxiously obvious musical cues to illustrate the tone of a particular scene. Despite how self-aware this movie seems to be, it ends up doing the same thing by following the exact same template. Granted, Friends with Benefits does try to get a bit more serious by introducing a dramatic subplot about Dylan's father (Jenkins) suffering from Alzheimer's and with an actor as capable as Jenkins this subplot is more effective than it should be, but it neither adds to the film nor takes away from it. The dramatic, medical disorder angle worked much better in Love and Other Drugs.It's totally generic, but has enough charm and wit to keep your attention. There are so many movies like this released each year and such light, forgettable fluff can never be criticized too harshly. I admit to having a soft spot for even the most forgettable romantic comedies, so please read my words with caution. Friends with Benefits is neither a great romantic comedy nor a particularly memorable one, but the charisma of the two leads and the existence of real talent in front of and behind the camera make it worth watching to some degree. It's sappy, clich&eacute;d, and far from surprising but it put a big, stupid smile on my face and I couldn't have asked a movie like this for anything more.GRADE: B",4,"A Harmless and Generic, But

Initially this approach to their sexual relationship frees up the two protagonists (in some quite comic love scenes) to openly inform each other, in the middle of sex, what they do and don't want in bed. Since we are two generations beyond the sex revolution of the 1960's with nudity in movies for some time now casually accepted, be prepared for a lot of it in this film. Fortunately, we are spared full, frontal nudity, and both stars are in great shape, so it's not a complete ordeal sitting through endless shots of their comely backsides.This is the first movie I've seen Justin Timberlake in. I was extremely impressed with his comic chops when he hosted Saturday Night Live, and I figured he would be ideal as a romantic comedy lead. He did not disappoint my expectation. He is charmingly vulnerable, witty, and quite attractive in this film.I had not previously seen Mila Kunis in anything. She does an excellent job as a snarky, clever, ambitious New Yorker, and I enjoyed the way she believably revealed, over the course of the film, her character's soft, romantic underbelly.What delighted me the most about this film is its lack of raunchy slapstick. The humor comes primarily from the witty repartee between the protagonists, which is my favorite kind of comedy. The pacing is excellent, and there are some wonderful supporting actors, including Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Jenna Elfman is Dylan's sister.

Oh, but emotion inevitably shows up and rears its ugly head.  This movie examines all this in a fun, light and entertaining way.

Either way, we decided we needed to view a double billing ofNo Strings Attachedand Friends with Benefits.All four lead actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake) were charming. Portman's Emma was my favorite character. She's brilliant, driven, and the movie doesn't make her sacrifice her career for true love. Justin Timberlake's Dylan was probably my least favorite, for reasons explained later. Therefore, No Strings Attached wins the leads.Both films have terrific supporting casts. I loved the side characters in No Strings Attached - Emma's neurotic med student roommates, Adam's friends with bad advice, coworker Lucy, and Kevin Kline as one of the worst parents ever. Then Friends with Benefits's came along with Woody Harrelson as a manly, openly gay coworker and Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father with Alzheimer's. Plus, there's tons of brilliant cameos. Friends with Benefits wins secondary characters.Final category: story. In No Strings Attached, Emma and Adam have been casual acquaintances for years. After beginning a casual sex relationship, Adam clearly wants something more while Emma isn't ready to make an emotional commitment. While both of them come close to screwing things up, neither makes a truly awful mistake. Friends with Benefits's Dylan and Jaime become friends first, then decide to sleep together. They obviously become something more, but Dylan isn't ready to admit it - which causes him to say some very hurtful things about Jaime. She, of course, overhears them. That scene felt cliche and made me dislike Dylan, but overall Friends with Benefits was funnier, more realistic, and had a truer emotional core. Thus, Friends with Benefits wins, by a hair, the better storyline.I slightly preferred No Strings Attached and R felt the same about Friends with Benefits. But both of us agree that if you're going to watch a 2011 romantic comedy, it should beCrazy, Stupid, Love (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy). Also, Thor had a terrific trailer.

This movie is phenomenal.  The director throws viewers right into the film with a whimsical dual scene in which both Timberlake and Kunis portray the rejected partners of separate relationships.  Quickly, the plot develops and it is no quickie.  Character development and relationships feel natural and genuine. This movie will definitely be a trans generational hit despite the unconventional ideas behind it.I am impressed with Timberlake as an actor, performer, and musician.  ""What do you know about women anyway,"" is more than Dylan's impression of life.  In this film, Timberlake becomes Dylan.  I could see other actors in the role, but I doubt they could have pulled it off with the same style and memorable charisma.  Of course, his trademark sexuality also makes for a great draw for many.Mila Kunis is incredibly sexy in this too.  She plays the independent professional woman well, but reminds me that there is a little princess deep down inside who wants her romance to be magical.  ""Why don't they ever make a movie about what happens after the kiss,"" Jamie wonders.  Kunis's Jamie also defies the stereotypical hero by being just as charismatic, controlling, and heroic as her male counterpart is.Woody Harrelson makes a great-unexpected wise man in this too.  His skewed vision and outrageous portrayal of a metrosexual plays perfectly into the chemistry of the film.  He also contrasts Timberlake's strutting and boasting effectively.  There is definitely no overacting in his work.I also love Jenna Elfman, and her portrayal as the wise sister and alert girlfriend is sensational.  She is genuine, charismatic, and does not upstage either Timberlake or Kunis despite her super-star skills.I would not recommend this for anyone under 18 though.  The content is very sexy, and though it comes clean as a romantic comedy, there is just enough sultry fun to make it adults only.  I am not sure how it rates at the box office, and I am positive America's modern teens dug their teeth into this eyes-wide-open.  Despite that, there is a culture in America of sexual propriety.  Rated R movies are one of the benefits of getting older.The soundtrack for this movie is also incredible.

However, I've seen a lot of movies that I expected to be awful, but ended up being really good. Thus, ""Friends With Benefits"". Romantic comedies are always awful for me. I love them, but they make me feel like crap. The reason why this is, is because most of them are dishonest, and make you feel like only in the movies, things work out in love. ""Friends With Benefits"" is refreshingly honest, kind of sad, yet hopelessly optimistic. Its dialogue is fast and quick, kind of ""Juno""-esque.Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are both coming off Oscar roles. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in ""The Social Network"", as was Kunis in ""Black Swan"". Maybe it was a fluke that both of them were so good in those movies, but this is the kind of movie they belong in. Their characters, Dylan and Jamie, have personalities, and characteristics that mesh with each other in a really awesome way, which doesn't come very often in romantic comedies.The story, as for most romantic comedies, isn't surprising at all. It's two people who are coming out of bad relationships, who meet in a classic cute romantic comedy way, and decide that relationships don't work out, and to remain ""friends with benefits"", or friends who (constantly) have sex. As you could imagine, this doesn't work out the way they had hoped. There was a similar movie released this January, with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher called ""No Strings Attached"", which, clearly will be referenced in most, if not all reviews for ""Friends With Benefits"". I, admittedly, didn't hate that movie. But it's a piece of dreck compared to this one.It's a typical hour-and-forty-five minute romantic comedy. However, it's kind of this generation's ""When Harry Met Sally"". It's ""When Dylan Met Jamie"". The two leads are so great with each other, one the yin to the other's yang. You can tell that they would be conceivable as a real couple. They aren't the perfect, immediately compatible couple that usually headlines a movie such as this. Justin Timberlake keeps proving that he's a better actor than a lot of pop stars. He's insanely likable in this movie. Mila Kunis had a smaller, haunting kind of role in ""Black Swan"", where I thought she was above average. She's really allowed to shine in this one, bringing life to a character that could have been much less. The attitude of this movie is sometimes gritty, always quick, witty, and urban. It makes good use of the time it's given. It acknowledges the ridiculous romantic comedies that it could have been. Jamie and her friend, at one point, walk by a poster for Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"", and says ""Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!"". A fake in-movie-movie, with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, is meant to emphasize how ridiculous most romantic comedies are. Great stuff.Another thing this one has that ""No Strings Attached"" didn't have is a great supporting cast. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's mother, a hippie lush who is really damn funny. Woody Harrelson also does a good job as Dylan's unapologetically bold and hilarious gay boss. He gets kudos for not making a gay character a stereotype. Richard Jenkins plays Dylan's Alzheimer's stricken father, and Jenna Elfman plays his sister. They add to the quick and zippy feel of the movie. Cameos by Emma Stone and Andy Samberg are always welcome, too.While some probably won't like this one as much as I did, I liked all of its characters. I felt like each character was well-developed and interesting. The quick writing is what makes it better than a lot of similar movies, but when everything in it is mashed together, the whole package is very good. I look forward to watching it again.Grade: A-",5,"At least ten times better than ""No Strings Attached""",1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,3805,"['been', 'magical', 'summer', 'movies', 'lot', 'movies', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lousy', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'expected', 'be', 'awful', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'Thus', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'always', 'awful', 'love', 'make', 'feel', 'crap', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'are', 'dishonest', 'make', 'feel', 'only', 'movies', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'love', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'refreshingly', 'honest', 'kind', 'sad', 'yet', 'hopelessly', 'optimistic', 'dialogue', 'fast', 'quick', 'kind', 'Juno', '-esque.Mila', 'Kunis', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'are', 'coming', 'off', 'Oscar', 'roles', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Social', 'Network', 'was', 'Kunis', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fluke', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'movies', 'kind', 'movie', 'belong', 'characters', 'Dylan', 'Jamie', 'have', 'personalities', 'characteristics', 'mesh', 'other', 'really', 'awesome', 'way', ""n't"", 'come', 'very', 'often', 'romantic', 'comedies.The', 'story', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'bad', 'relationships', 'who', 'classic', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'way', 'decide', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'remain', 'friends', 'benefits', 'friends', 'who', 'constantly', 'have', 'sex', 'could', 'imagine', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'similar', 'movie', 'released', 'January', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'called', 'No', 'Strings', 'Attached', 'clearly', 'will', 'be', 'referenced', 'most', 'not', 'reviews', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'piece', 'dreck', 'compared', 'one.It', 'typical', 'hour-and-forty-five', 'minute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'However', 'kind', 'generation', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'When', 'Dylan', 'Met', 'Jamie', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'other', 'one', 'yin', 'other', 'yang', 'can', 'tell', 'would', 'be', 'conceivable', 'real', 'couple', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'immediately', 'compatible', 'couple', 'usually', 'movie', 'such', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'proving', 'better', 'actor', 'lot', 'pop', 'stars', 'insanely', 'likable', 'movie', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'had', 'smaller', 'haunting', 'kind', 'role', 'Black', 'Swan', 'where', 'thought', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'really', 'allowed', 'shine', 'one', 'bringing', 'life', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'attitude', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'gritty', 'always', 'quick', 'witty', 'urban', 'good', 'use', 'time', 'given', 'ridiculous', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Jamie', 'friend', 'one', 'point', 'walk', 'poster', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'Shut', 'up', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'stupid', 'liar', 'fake', 'in-movie-movie', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'meant', 'emphasize', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'Great', 'stuff.Another', 'thing', 'one', 'No', 'Strings', 'Attached', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Jamie', 'mother', 'hippie', 'lush', 'who', 'really', 'damn', 'funny', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'Dylan', 'unapologetically', 'bold', 'hilarious', 'gay', 'boss', 'kudos', 'not', 'making', 'gay', 'character', 'stereotype', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Dylan', 'Alzheimer', 'stricken', 'father', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'sister', 'add', 'quick', 'zippy', 'feel', 'movie', 'Cameos', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'are', 'always', 'welcome', 'too.While', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'liked', 'characters', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'well-developed', 'interesting', 'quick', 'writing', 'what', 'better', 'lot', 'similar', 'movies', 'when', 'everything', 'mashed', 'together', 'whole', 'package', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again.Grade', 'A-']",Friends with Benefits

Both, however, have their sexual needs, so they agree to become ""friends with benefits""; sex partners without any emotional commitment.

Patricia Clarkson plays Mila's wandering mother, a fugitive from the 1970s who has not changed her ways and is unsure as to which of her myriad lovers fathered her daughter.  Richard Jenkins is Justin's father, suffering from Alzheimer's, and Woody Harrelson is Timbelake's openly gay co-worker.  Also in the cast is Emma Stone, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman.Director Will Gluck co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Merryman and David A.

Not saying that doesn't happen in reality, but it doesn't happen enough for this to be a movie for realistic people.The best part of this movie is the relationship JT's character has with his Dad, and the best scene (in my opinion), is the one in the airport.  If you have ever known someone, or known of someone, who has suffered (or is suffering) from Alzheimer's, then this scene should hit you in the feels.As I wrote, all-in-all, a slightly above average take on things we've seen before.

You go to New York ( and you're a guy ) and a hot girl meets you there cause she's the recruiter :  Unrealistic.  It would either be a guy or an unattractive woman meeting you......likely a guy.  I get called by recruiters all the time and they're 20 - 30 somethings guys headhunting for commisions.  2. The hot girl is totally forward, friendly, waits all day for you to finish your interview so she can take you for a drink:  UNREALISTIC - in reality hot women are getting texts and phone calls on their cell phones 24 hours a day from all her male suitors she would already have because she's been living in that town for a while. So, tons of guys would be birdogging her and she wouldn't wait around for you ( a guy from out of town ) for any reason.  In the real world, hot women,like Mila Kunis are a commodity and highly sought after and usually already taken.  Also, in real life, men are the aggressors and women are more demure.  Men are like dogs and women are like cats....ie cats scare easy.  Men have to convince women to do things with them....get coffee or date.  In this movie, Justin t. has a dont give a $##$ attitude and is the one being pursued after by the hot girl.  Unrealistic....it's the other way around.  That's human nature.Justin Timberlake is so much more talented than John Mayer that he has seeming disdain for him in this movie:  UNREALISTIC - In reality John Mayer has more talent in one of his fingers than Justin T. has in his whole body.  John Mayer writes his own stuff....plays guitar like Jimmy freaking Hendrix and sings good.  Mayer's lyrics often have deep meaningful insights to life ( except for some of that obvious made for radio stuff....which I don't care for either )  Meanwhile what does TImberlake do?  Jump around on stage.....playing NO instrument....dressed in Shiny outfits and sing along to boy band songs.  Big freakin whup.  Mayer having disdain for Timberlake.....would make more sense.OK....there were some funny parts.....but the lack of what the real world is like in terms of human nature and the way women and men interact......blew it for me.",3,"Kinda funny, Kinda unrealistic.",1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,2142,"['First', 'unrealistic', 'parts', '1', 'go', 'New', 'York', ""'re"", 'guy', 'hot', 'girl', 'meets', 'cause', 'recruiter', 'Unrealistic', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'guy', 'unattractive', 'woman', 'meeting', 'likely', 'guy', 'get', 'called', 'recruiters', 'time', ""'re"", '20', '30', 'somethings', 'guys', 'headhunting', 'commisions', '2', 'hot', 'girl', 'totally', 'forward', 'friendly', 'waits', 'day', 'finish', 'interview', 'can', 'take', 'drink', 'UNREALISTIC', 'reality', 'hot', 'women', 'are', 'getting', 'texts', 'phone', 'calls', 'cell', 'phones', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'male', 'suitors', 'would', 'already', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'town', 'while', 'So', 'tons', 'guys', 'would', 'be', 'birdogging', 'would', ""n't"", 'wait', 'around', 'guy', 'town', 'reason', 'real', 'world', 'hot', 'women', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'are', 'commodity', 'highly', 'sought', 'usually', 'already', 'taken', 'Also', 'real', 'life', 'men', 'are', 'aggressors', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'demure', 'are', 'dogs', 'women', 'are', 'cats', '.ie', 'cats', 'scare', 'easy', 'Men', 'have', 'convince', 'women', 'do', 'things', '.get', 'coffee', 'date', 'movie', 'Justin', 't.', 'dont', 'give', 'attitude', 'one', 'being', 'pursued', 'hot', 'girl', 'Unrealistic', '.it', 'other', 'way', 'human', 'nature.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'talented', 'John', 'Mayer', 'seeming', 'disdain', 'movie', 'UNREALISTIC', 'reality', 'John', 'Mayer', 'more', 'talent', 'one', 'fingers', 'Justin', 'T.', 'whole', 'body', 'John', 'Mayer', 'own', 'stuff', 'guitar', 'Jimmy', 'freaking', 'Hendrix', 'sings', 'good', 'Mayer', 'lyrics', 'often', 'have', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'insights', 'life', 'obvious', 'made', 'radio', 'stuff', '.which', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Meanwhile', 'what', 'TImberlake', 'do', 'Jump', 'stage', '..playing', 'NO', 'instrument', '.dressed', 'Shiny', 'outfits', 'sing', 'along', 'boy', 'band', 'songs', 'Big', 'freakin', 'whup', 'Mayer', 'having', 'disdain', 'Timberlake', '..would', 'make', 'more', 'sense.OK', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'lack', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'terms', 'human', 'nature', 'way', 'women', 'men', 'interact', 'blew']",Friends with Benefits

The movie is fast paced and both Kunis and Timberlake are perfect for their roles, there is plenty of laughs a long the way and features a strong supporting cast. Woody Harrelson is Hilarious in his role as Tommy, the head sports writer for GQ who happens to be gay and is convinced that Timberlake is also gay. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis hippy loving mother who can't recall what nationality Kunis dad is. Richard Jenkins plays Timberlake's dad who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Emma Stone(who could probably have done a good job playing Kunis role if chosen) has a very small role as Timberlakes girlfriend who happens to be obsessed with John Mayer!While the movie never strays too far from the usual romcom rules it is a funny movie that is well held together by it's lead characters.",4,TIMBERLAKES & KUNIS CHEMISTRY THE KEY TO THIS ROMCOM,1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,1309,"['lot', 'time', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'romcom', 'will', 'leave', 'movie', 'down', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'roles', 'can', 'seem', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'however', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'change', 'trend', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'what', 'very', 'enjoyable.The', 'main', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'Timberlake', 'Kunis', 'are', 'unlucky', 'love', 'Timberlake', 'moves', 'L.A', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Kunis', 'job', 'GQ', 'two', 'quickly', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'Kunis', 'Timberlake', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'long', 'way', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Hilarious', 'role', 'Tommy', 'head', 'sports', 'writer', 'GQ', 'who', 'be', 'gay', 'convinced', 'Timberlake', 'also', 'gay', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Kunis', 'hippy', 'loving', 'mother', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'nationality', 'Kunis', 'dad', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Timberlake', 'dad', 'who', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Kunis', 'role', 'chosen', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'Timberlakes', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'be', 'obsessed', 'John', 'Mayer', 'movie', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'usual', 'romcom', 'rules', 'funny', 'movie', 'well', 'held', 'together', 'lead', 'characters']",Friends with Benefits

I guess the reviews made this sound like it would be okay--a love story for a modern age. The story involves two people choosing to have a sexual partner/friend relationship without any actual love involved, and quite predictably, that doesn't last. On their journey to togetherness, these characters prove very unlikeable as they are both very crude (the really crass language throughout is very off-putting), they offer viewers little more than a constant view of their need for lots and lots of sex, and by the time they finally seem to be maturing a little (when they have to deal with issues of aging parents and actual intimacy), they have proved so unappealing (all along) that the viewer doesn't have much to root for in the relationship that is finally developing.The dvd cover shows what looks like a cute couple, but in the end these two characters seem really shallow and damaged. I wouldn't want to know people like this and they seem like they are destined for lives of emptiness and self-destruction. Be aware that this has a lot of very, very crude language and many overt sexual acts (not always seen, but always described and viewed from above). I really wish I had the time back that I spent watching this very mediocre movie.The only scenes worth watching involved the aging father, his daughter and grandson, and how difficult it is to have a family member with Alzheimer's.

1404397,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B004EPZ0BG,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","Romantic comedies have been done so much, and using the same, typical formulaic story that frankly, I had been wondering if there was anything left in the tank.  I like romantic comedies, but in recent years, they haven't offered much.We all know the formula.  Boy meets girl or girl meets boy.  Usually, they click right off, or it is one of those typical ""worship"" comedies where one of them dreams of being with the other, and it takes most of the film for them to get together.  If they click right off, then they start off well until some kind of conflict arises that threatens to put the relationship in jeopardy.  Of course, in the end of either scenario, things work out.  Sometimes, great exaggeration is used in the ""working out"" process.  It's ironic how much people view romantic scenarios like a movie.  And why not?  Things always work out in the movies, right?Two things make this film work better than your typical romantic comedy: the actors and the story.  Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are very believable in their respective roles as Dylan and Jamie.  Sure, they are both coming off of relationships that didn't work out, they meet in NYC, and before you know it, they click.  The irony here, is that neither of them is looking for anything romantic.  So, we can dispense with the typical ""wooing"" stage of the formula.  Despite the fact that we all know that they will end up together in the end doesn't matter as much because the journey is interesting.  Both are playing real people to the extent that neither is demonstrating that they are somehow better than anyone else.  In other words, they could be anyone.  Both of them know that neither one of them is perfect, and frankly, neither one is striving to be.  They come with baggage as does anyone with their relationship and personal history.There are some aspects of the story that we can easily say, ""okay, seen it a million times already.""  However, these are two characters who are very real, and I think one of the things that endeared me to both of them is that neither one is trying at all to be someone they are not.  The only movie that I can think of where this was done so well was ""When Harry Met Sally,"" which for my money, is still the best romantic comedy done in the last 30 years.Now, the story is interesting as it takes an idea that I am sure many people have either tried to do themselves or have wondered about.  Can two people have a sexual relationship without any kind of emotional attachment?  It is funny that the gay man in Dylan's life (wonderfully played by Woody Harrelson) and the dysfunctional mother in Jamie's life (equally impressive by Patricia Clarkson) in a sense let Dylan and Jamie know that it really isn't possible.  Of course, we know that at some point, one of the characters is going to ""fall for"" the other.  What makes the story work as that we see BOTH characters fall for each other at relatively the same time rather than one pursue the other until the other finally comes around from some kind of epic point of realization.Dylan knows he loves Jamie, even if he doesn't say it, and it's clear that Jamie loves Dylan as well.  The conflict comes into play when both characters are trying to admit it, not only to each other, but also to themselves.  Everyone can relate, to some degree, with two characters who love each other but are afraid to say it.  Sound familiar?  This happens on practically a daily basis.  Isn't it ironic how petrified we become to say three words to someone: I love you.Michael Landon may have expressed this  best when he said, ""You know we have a lot of funny notions born inside of us. The funniest is that we're supposed to hide the way we feel about people. Let me tell you, everybody wants to know that they are loved, or needed, or cared about. Anybody who doesn't want to know that has something wrong with them.""Now, the challenge of a film like this is how to end it.  How to come up with a type of emotionally satisfying climax that works and also hasn't been done several hundred times already.  The climax is satisfactory.  It does work, even if it is fairly typical.  This was the only part of the film that I was hoping might be different.So, if you are looking for another romantic comedy to watch, and you have almost given up on the entire genre, like I practically did, then you can be glad that there is at least one more that is definitely worth watching.  Timberlake and Kunis have the chemistry that really helps to make this film work.  The comedic part of the film works too as neither character is ""trying"" to be funny, but instead we find the humor in real, every-day life situations.",4,Finally a Really Good Romantic Comedy That Works,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,4669,"['Romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'using', 'same', 'typical', 'formulaic', 'story', 'frankly', 'had', 'been', 'wondering', 'was', 'anything', 'left', 'tank', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'offered', 'much.We', 'know', 'formula', 'Boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy', 'Usually', 'click', 'right', 'off', 'one', 'typical', 'worship', 'comedies', 'where', 'one', 'dreams', 'being', 'other', 'most', 'film', 'get', 'together', 'click', 'right', 'off', 'then', 'start', 'off', 'well', 'kind', 'conflict', 'arises', 'put', 'relationship', 'jeopardy', 'course', 'end', 'scenario', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'Sometimes', 'great', 'exaggeration', 'used', 'working', 'out', 'process', 'ironic', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'view', 'romantic', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'Things', 'always', 'work', 'out', 'movies', 'right', 'Two', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'better', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actors', 'story', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'respective', 'roles', 'Dylan', 'Jamie', 'Sure', 'are', 'coming', 'relationships', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'meet', 'NYC', 'know', 'click', 'irony', 'here', 'looking', 'anything', 'romantic', 'So', 'can', 'dispense', 'typical', 'wooing', 'stage', 'formula', 'fact', 'know', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', ""n't"", 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'journey', 'interesting', 'are', 'playing', 'real', 'people', 'extent', 'demonstrating', 'are', 'somehow', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'know', 'one', 'perfect', 'frankly', 'one', 'striving', 'be', 'come', 'baggage', 'anyone', 'relationship', 'personal', 'history.There', 'are', 'aspects', 'story', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'okay', 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'already', 'However', 'are', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'think', 'one', 'things', 'endeared', 'one', 'trying', 'be', 'someone', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'money', 'still', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'done', 'last', '30', 'years.Now', 'story', 'interesting', 'idea', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'tried', 'do', 'have', 'wondered', 'Can', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'kind', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'funny', 'gay', 'man', 'Dylan', 'life', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'dysfunctional', 'mother', 'Jamie', 'life', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'sense', 'let', 'Dylan', 'Jamie', 'know', 'really', ""n't"", 'possible', 'course', 'know', 'point', 'one', 'characters', 'going', 'fall', 'other', 'What', 'story', 'work', 'see', 'characters', 'fall', 'other', 'relatively', 'same', 'time', 'rather', 'one', 'pursue', 'other', 'other', 'finally', 'around', 'kind', 'epic', 'point', 'realization.Dylan', 'Jamie', 'even', ""n't"", 'say', 'clear', 'Jamie', 'Dylan', 'as', 'well', 'conflict', 'play', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'admit', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'also', 'Everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'degree', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'afraid', 'say', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'practically', 'daily', 'basis', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'how', 'petrified', 'become', 'say', 'three', 'words', 'someone', 'love', 'you.Michael', 'Landon', 'may', 'have', 'expressed', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'know', 'have', 'lot', 'funny', 'notions', 'born', 'funniest', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'hide', 'way', 'feel', 'people', 'Let', 'tell', 'everybody', 'know', 'are', 'loved', 'needed', 'cared', 'Anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'Now', 'challenge', 'film', 'how', 'end', 'How', 'come', 'up', 'type', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'also', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'several', 'hundred', 'times', 'already', 'climax', 'satisfactory', 'work', 'even', 'fairly', 'typical', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'might', 'be', 'different.So', 'are', 'looking', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'watch', 'have', 'almost', 'given', 'up', 'entire', 'genre', 'practically', 'did', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'glad', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Timberlake', 'Kunis', 'have', 'chemistry', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'comedic', 'part', 'film', 'too', 'neither', 'character', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'instead', 'find', 'humor', 'real', 'every-day', 'life', 'situations']",Friends with Benefits

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","I purposely did not go see this film because it came out around the same time as a bunch of romantic comedies that all sounded like the same film. I kept thinking, ""What's the difference between this movie and ""No Strings Attached""? Did somebody run out of plots? Now as funny as I think Ashton Kutcher is and as much as I liked his role, it wasn't until after this film (while watching Justin Timberlake on ""Lopez Tonight"") that I realized how funny he is. I just knew Justin Timberlake as the guy who can dance his butt off and who is quite possibly the best person to team up with Timbaland (outside of Missy Elliot). I didn't know a thing about Mila Kunis besides getting asked out by a soldier. But I figured the film finally came to DVD. Why not watch it?I loved this film. They had the best chemistry for a comedic couple, and even when the scenes were serious, they were just as good there, too. It's difficult to take a couple seriously after they've been THIS goofy with each other through the first half of the film. I don't think anybody thought they weren't going to eventually have some serious scenes, but even if this film wasn't a comedy, it was good enough to be a drama. I thought the two of them were an adorable couple, and Justin Timberlake is sexy as hell anyway. But he had an equally beautiful partner who cracked me up as much as he did.I'd already seen him rapping with Jimmy Fallon so I knew he had a rap library in his head. The scene with Kris Kross didn't even make me bat an eye, and I know the lyrics he mumbled his way through. Anyway, the film's plot is predictable (minus the father, I never really knew what he was going to do next), but the way the actors pulled off the comedy was not. I give them a loud round of applause for making a romantic comedy that was equal parts romantic as it was comedy.

That being said, I was completely wrong and surprised by this film. Starring Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson, ""Friends With Benefits"" is, well, exactly about what it sounds. Timberlake, upon moving to New York to take a new job, has as his only friend Kunis, who lured him to New York for the job to begin with. As the two develop as friends, so does their relationship develop. While the ending may be predictable, the storyline of the friendship, a character with Alzheimer's, and the ""realness"" of the film lend reality to comedy.ACTING: AJustin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson all shine in this film, with Timberlake and Kunis taking charge of the lead roles and producing a sense of positive interaction and giving believability to the plot and the humor. Harrelson, as a side character (Timberlake's gay co-worker/friend), is flamboyantly gay and unafraid to show it: creating many entertaining moments in his own right.PLOT: B+Sure, the plot is believable. Most plots of romantic comedies are. This film, for me, was different in that it was also about Timberlake's film-dad suffering from Alzheimers, about Kunis' mommy-issues, and about the development of the characters as adults. This is far from a rote comedy along the lines of every other script, making it enjoyable!COMEDY: AAt points, I couldn't stop laughing, particularly in the interaction in the bedroom between Kunis and Timberlake as well as due to Harrelson's character. To be sure, the humor is crude and sexual most of the time, but you could probably guess that from the title.FINAL REVIEW: BUY ITThis film is definitely one to purchase. I will be doing so as soon as it leaves theaters. It was more than a romantic comedy, for me, just as it was more than a raunchy, sexual comedy. If you like Kunis and Timberlake, they are at the top of their games in this film.

1404409,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004EPZ0BG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[104, 117]","Both Timberlake and Kunis have recently broken up with their partner. Kunis plays a recruiter for GQ magazine, and Timberlake is someone she ""stalked"" to head up their Art department. Timberlake's ex-gf is Emma Stone. What is interesting is that Kunis' character is the laid back type of person we would expect Emma Stone to play, while Stone (what little we see of her) plays an emotional character we would expect Kunis to play. I don't know if the producers did this by design, or they just lucked into it, but knowing this made the movie funny on a different level. Kunis is savvy enough to realize she has been ruined by romantic movies as she awaits her Prince to sweep her off her feet. You know at the end of the movie, come running to her as she is about to leave, and pour his heart out to her.Kunis gives Timberlake a fast paced tour of NY, perhaps one of the best sells for Manhattan I have seen in a long time. The movie verbally condemns Hollywood's romantic comedies while ironically creating one identical to it. With some quick character build up, the film goes to a scene where Timberlake and Kunis decide that they will have sex without the emotional baggage while swearing on a Bible app.  No complications, just sex. Guess how that turns out?Woody Harrelson plays a gay sports editor who is not shy about being gay. Woody gives Timberlake love advice, ""It's not who you want to spend Friday night with, but who you want to spend all day Saturday with.""The sex scenes between Kunis and Timberlake are more comical than romantic. Timberlake likes to keep his socks on and sneezes after an orgasm, and Kunis is a screamer. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis' super hip mother, who has never really told her daughter who her father was. In her first few minutes he was Greek, Puerto Rican, or Russian...she is sure he was Eurasian.The dialoge is fast and witty. Kunis did a background check on a guy she dated.Timberlake responds: ""Did you do a background check on me?""Kunis:""How could you possibly max out an Old Navy card?""Timberlake: ""I was just out of college and really into cargo pants.""In spite of the adult themes, the movie has a lighthearted chick flick Disney quality to it.

1404415,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EPZ0BG,Turfseer,"[1, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5Jamie is an executive recruiter who recruits Dylan, a young, up and coming art director for a small internet company in Los Angeles, to come to NYC and work for the much more high powered GQ Magazine. Before this happens, there's a prologue showing their back story: both are going through another unsuccessful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. When Jamie and Dylan meet each other for the first time, they're both jaded, as they've been burned one too many times, in their quest for 'true romance'.While getting to know each other, they watch a parody of a romcom (romantic comedy) on TV, both bemoaning the pitfalls of traditional courtships and wondering perhaps how they can circumvent all the complications associated with traditional romance. They forge an unlikely friendship where they can avoid any kind of commitment in the relationship and simply enjoy sex for its own sake. Hence, the 'benefits' is the satisfaction of having the sexual relationship without the commitment.Soon, the film's scenarists strategy of setting us up for an old fashioned morality tale, becomes clear. The 'friends with benefits' program--that is, sex without commitment, is only part and parcel of a larger overall problem with the personalities of our protagonists. Jamie and Dylan are unfortunately narcissistic, coarse and immature.The film's scenarists would like us to laugh at Jamie and Dylan, as they expose their foibles in the first thirty minutes or so. Jamie, the perennial go-getter, obnoxiously puts down Dylan, who extols the virtues of wide-open, west coast living as opposed to what he regards as the cramped living style of New Yorkers (the put-down becomes clear when Jamie sarcastically cracks, ""What are you, a Gazelle?).If Jamie's coarseness is off-putting, it pales in comparison to Dylan's complete cluelessness. Dylan is so narcissistic that he simply can't understand why he's so wrong about Captain Sully. People rightly perceive that he's stubborn and ignorant when he claims 'planes fly themselves'. In reality, Captain Sully's plane was almost completely disabled due to the bird strike and could not possibly fly itself. So he's wrong on that count and 'tunes out' all those who are justifiably angry with him.Dylan's myopic 'Sully stance' is indicative of what's wrong with the first third of the film. By trying to 'humanize' the characters, exposing them as deeply flawed human beings, the film's scenarists have gone too far and made them out to be decidedly unlikeable. Somehow the Sully joke needed to be lighter and not cast Dylan in such a negative light. That way, we would care more about him at the end, when he finally does redeem himself. The same goes for Jamie whose constant use of expletives coupled with her overreaching competitiveness, also casts her in a negative light, during the expository sequences.The failed comedy of exposing the two 'losers' who adopt the self-defeating 'friends with benefits' program becomes a much more traditional romance in Act II and III, not unlike the 'film within a film' parody of the romcom the two lovers watch and disparage early on. It doesn't take long for Jamie to have true feelings for Dylan, after he invites her to California to meet his family and they have an intimate tryst. But Dylan remains locked in his fear of commitment and after Jamie overhears him putting her down while talking with his sister, the third act crisis is precipitated.It takes a little while longer before Dylan redeems himself by realizing how selfish he's been, but with the aid of two key allies, he finally sees the light. The allies who counsel Dylan are of course, Tommy, his gay co-worker, delightfully played by Woody Harrelson and Dylan's Alzheimer's afflicted father, Mr. Harper (solidly and convincingly played by Richard Jenkins).Couldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together. I only wish their characters were a little less alienating and a little more gregarious in the first thirty to forty minutes.In the end, 'Benefits' can only live up to its billing for its romance and not its comedy. Simply put, there's nothing funny about obnoxious, clueless people. But once these protagonists are transformed, they do become a bit more likable. Still, is this rather predictable 'love-fest', a film you'll remember for a long time? I doubt it quite a bit.As an old fashioned morality tale, where a misguided couple realizes the error of their ways and finds 'true love' in the process, 'Benefits' fits in well with the pantheon of mediocre romcoms, populating our movie theaters today.",1,Clueless commitmentphobes transformed in old fashioned morality tale masquerading as urban comedy,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,4925,"['***',

First off, I loved this movie; comparatively it was better than No Strings Attach with Portman and Kucher.  The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis seems very real and believable.  It was so believable that it led me to believe that they might have had a real relationship while working together.  Both are funny, energetic and sexy(Mila Kunis)characters that carry the whole movie, from beginning to end.  You know a movie is good when you're rooting for their relationship to work out as you're watching it.  Very good romantic comedy.

1404424,AP3B615GM191G,B004EPZ0BG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","In 1989, Meg Ryan faked an orgasm, Billy Crystal droned about ""sex getting in the way"" of male-female friendship, and the basis for nearly every romantic comedy since was formed ""When Harry Met Sally"".  This film follows the same basic premise...but at the same time turns it completely on its head.For a basic plot summary, ""Friends with Benefits"" sees ""headhunter"" (or business recruiter) Jamie (Mila Kunis) meet Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and try to convince him to move to New York City to work for GQ.  After seeing the sights and getting to know each other a bit, Jamie & Dylan (in order to avoid all the ""complications"" of a normal relationship) decide to engage in a ""just sex"" type of mutual agreement.  From there, of course, things begin to veer off course and get a bit tenuous between the two.Considering that this type of film has been done to death, ""Friends With Benefits"" is actually pretty good.  Justin & Mila have great on-screen chemistry, the plot is a good mix of sappy & serious, and (at times) it will make you laugh (although many of those will be uncomfortable chuckles if watching with an audience).Besides the irreverent fare (which would probably prevent this movie from being a ""classic"" anyway), the only problem I had with this film was how strange it was for the two leads to be playing against type.  Usually, Timberlake is the ""crazy guy"" and Kunis is the ""uptight witchy girl""...that is how we are accustomed to seeing those actors.  Here, however, Timberlake is a bit more reserved while Kunis goes through a gambit of emotions from beginning to end.  The chemistry between the two, as I mentioned, was great, but it was awkward seeing them against type.Overall, though, this is a decent rom-com that provides (in equal parts): sexual escapades, tongue-in-cheek humor, character development, & an engaging plot.  It may not be an all-time great, but ""Friends with Benefits"" most definitely has its moments.",3,When Justin Met Mila,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1943,"['1989', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'faked', 'orgasm', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'droned', 'sex', 'getting', 'way', 'male-female', 'friendship', 'basis', 'nearly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'was', 'formed', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'film', 'same', 'basic', 'premise', 'same', 'time', 'completely', 'head.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'headhunter', 'business', 'recruiter', 'Jamie', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'meet', 'Dylan', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'try', 'convince', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'work', 'GQ', 'seeing', 'sights', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'bit', 'Jamie', 'Dylan', 'order', 'avoid', 'complications', 'normal', 'relationship', 'decide', 'engage', 'just', 'sex', 'type', 'mutual', 'agreement', 'there', 'course', 'things', 'begin', 'veer', 'off', 'course', 'get', 'bit', 'tenuous', 'two.Considering', 'type', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Justin', 'Mila', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'plot', 'good', 'mix', 'sappy', 'serious', 'times', 'will', 'make', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'chuckles', 'watching', 'audience', 'irreverent', 'fare', 'would', 'probably', 'prevent', 'movie', 'being', 'classic', 'anyway', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'strange', 'was', 'two', 'leads', 'be', 'playing', 'type', 'Usually', 'Timberlake', 'crazy', 'guy', 'Kunis', 'uptight', 'witchy', 'girl', 'how', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'actors', 'Here', 'however', 'Timberlake', 'bit', 'more', 'reserved', 'Kunis', 'gambit', 'emotions', 'beginning', 'end', 'chemistry', 'two', 'mentioned', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'awkward', 'seeing', 'type.Overall', 'though', 'decent', 'rom-com', 'equal', 'parts', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'character', 'development', 'engaging', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'all-time', 'great', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'most', 'definitely', 'moments']",Friends with Benefits
