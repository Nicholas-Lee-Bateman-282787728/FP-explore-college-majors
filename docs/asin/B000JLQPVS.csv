At the end of her program she called me up on stage and while I stood there with my knees knocking...she sang ""Stand by your man"". I adored her and that moment will always be with me.

The other DVD is the best of Dottie West and it has some of the same full length song clips that were filmed live at Church Street Station in Orlando. This DVD also has Tom Wopat ( you might remember him from the Dukes of Hazzard TV show) singing. It also features Freddie Weller.Dottie West never got the recognition she deserved. She was way ahead of her time...and reinvented herself. I still remember when she first appeared in the Glam outfits, skin tight spandex and knee high boots and heels. Her songs with Kenny Rogers were also some of my favorites. And I really wish Country Sunshine would have been on the DVD.I keep wondering where Dottie would be today had she not been taken from us in that tragic car crash on the way to the Grand Ole Opry.
