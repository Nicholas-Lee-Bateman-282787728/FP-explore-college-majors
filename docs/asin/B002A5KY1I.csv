Rubbo""","[4, 6]","[BRAINSTORM - (1965) - Directed by William Conrad - B+W Widescreen presentation]  After watching 'My Blood Runs Cold' from the same year, also directed by William Conrad (later the star of  TV's 'Cannon'), I jumped on this film immediately, also being a fan of Anne Francis (star of 'Honey West' and numerous appearances on 'Burke's Law', 'Route 66', etc.). Though I did enjoy it for what it was, what it wasn't didn't leave me feeling similarly to 'My Blood Runs Cold', which I considered to be a better overall viewing experience (read my review). But in the William Conrad canon (no pun intended), it fares considerably better than 'Two On a Guillotine'.Personally, I found Jeff Hunter's portrayal of the moody scientist a trite overdone; there's nothing subtle about his acting here, it borders on over-the-top once he gets romantically involved with Anne Francis' character. And the scheme he cooked up to get away with murder was rife with probable outcome nightmares from the get-go, so when things don't go as planned there's no surprise to be had, weakening the film's conclusion considerably. Forget about playing nuts, he had to have a good head start to believe this scheme was even remotely feasible. And Anne Francis suddenly disappears mid-point through the movie, returning for two minutes near the end to say what you knew she would say fifteen minutes into the proceedings. Though the film was released in 1965, it looks, feels and plays out like a film noir from the mid 50's - it has absolutely nothing to do with the 60's in any way, so it comes off somewhat dated all around. It's reminiscent of Sam Fuller's 'Shock Corridor' with a bigger budget, but not as good or as forward thinking. Again, I did enjoy it to a point, but its predictability left me flat. A 3 star flick some might consider worthy of a fourth, but never a fifth. A bit campy and certainly a guilty pleasure for me, but it should have been better, or at least had a twist somewhere to keep things interesting - it's not exactly a 'Brainstorm'.",4,"Good, But Dated Even When It Was Initially Released...",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2034,"['[', 'BRAINSTORM', '1965', 'Directed', 'William', 'Conrad', 'B+W', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', ']', 'watching', ""'My"", 'Blood', 'Runs', 'Cold', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'directed', 'William', 'Conrad', 'later', 'star', 'TV', ""'Cannon"", 'jumped', 'film', 'immediately', 'also', 'being', 'fan', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'star', ""'Honey"", 'West', 'numerous', 'appearances', ""'Burke"", 'Law', '66', 'etc.', 'did', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'similarly', ""'My"", 'Blood', 'Runs', 'Cold', 'considered', 'be', 'better', 'overall', 'viewing', 'experience', 'read', 'review', 'William', 'Conrad', 'canon', 'pun', 'intended', 'considerably', 'better', ""'Two"", ""Guillotine'.Personally"", 'found', 'Jeff', 'Hunter', 'portrayal', 'moody', 'trite', 'overdone', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'acting', 'here', 'over-the-top', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'character', 'scheme', 'cooked', 'up', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'was', 'rife', 'probable', 'outcome', 'nightmares', 'get-go', 'so', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'surprise', 'be', 'had', 'weakening', 'film', 'conclusion', 'considerably', 'Forget', 'playing', 'nuts', 'had', 'have', 'good', 'head', 'start', 'believe', 'scheme', 'was', 'even', 'remotely', 'feasible', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'suddenly', 'mid-point', 'movie', 'returning', 'two', 'minutes', 'end', 'say', 'what', 'knew', 'would', 'say', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'proceedings', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1965', 'feels', 'out', 'film', 'noir', 'mid', '50', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', '60', 'way', 'off', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'around', 'reminiscent', 'Sam', 'Fuller', ""'Shock"", 'Corridor', 'bigger', 'budget', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'forward', 'thinking', 'Again', 'did', 'enjoy', 'point', 'predictability', 'left', 'flat', '3', 'star', 'flick', 'might', 'consider', 'worthy', 'fourth', 'never', 'fifth', 'bit', 'campy', 'certainly', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'least', 'had', 'twist', 'somewhere', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'not', 'exactly', ""'Brainstorm""]",Brainstorm

I am really glad someone brings these hidden treasures to the light. The main subject of the story is the question whether the main character - a truly great performance by Jeffrey Hunter - is insane or not. The cinematography and the set design pull the viewer down into the same state of confusion as the main character. We share his insecurity as life seems to play tricks on him and everybody seems to be opposed to his view of events. Very interesting is the stark contrast between the ultra modern industrial complex in which the main character works and the Gothic interior of the residence of the owner of that corporation (small part but convincing under acting by film noir veteran Dana Andrews). Also great performance by Anne Francis as a kind of femme fatale - isn't she a vastly underrated actress who could have had a career like Ellen Burstyn? Anyway, after watching this I felt compelled to purchase the Honey West TV series in which Francis stars - another great delight in black and white.",5,Late film noir,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,1089,"['Watching', 'stylish', 'nightmarish', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'delight', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'someone', 'hidden', 'treasures', 'light', 'main', 'subject', 'story', 'question', 'main', 'character', 'truly', 'great', 'performance', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'insane', 'not', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'viewer', 'down', 'same', 'state', 'confusion', 'main', 'character', 'share', 'insecurity', 'life', 'play', 'tricks', 'everybody', 'be', 'opposed', 'view', 'events', 'Very', 'interesting', 'stark', 'contrast', 'ultra', 'modern', 'industrial', 'complex', 'main', 'character', 'works', 'Gothic', 'interior', 'residence', 'owner', 'corporation', 'small', 'part', 'convincing', 'acting', 'film', 'noir', 'veteran', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Also', 'great', 'performance', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'kind', 'femme', 'fatale', ""n't"", 'vastly', 'underrated', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'career', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Anyway', 'watching', 'felt', 'compelled', 'purchase', 'Honey', 'West', 'TV', 'series', 'Francis', 'great', 'delight', 'black', 'white']",Brainstorm

Hunter is so attractive in his naivete I felt desperate to protect him from the dangerous woman.  I had seen him in other movies and as the first captain of the Enterprise, but always the nice young man....boring.  So seeing him in this movie was a total shock where I discovered what an incredible actor he is.  He first plans madness by studying everything about it.  But at some point I began to wonder if he studied too well.  His performance is so good he will keep you wondering.  All this is done with an incredible level of tension as Andrews, his boss and the lady's husband starts actually setting him up as a mad man, pulling many diabolical tricks on him.

1257978,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B002A5KY1I,William Amazzini,"[6, 6]","Actor William Conrad directed a trilogy of films in the mid sixties which this 'BRAINSTORM' emerges as his most accomplished work.  Actor Jeffrey Hunter is involved in a nightmare when he unwittingly saves actress Anne Francis in one of her best roles from suicide. She turns out to be the wife of his employer Dana Andrews who puts a game of cat and mouse in motion utilizing Hunter's passed mental problems as the macguffin.  When Hunter and Francis become lovers, Hunter realizes he is another one of the past knights in shining armor trying to save Francis but this time Andrews pulls out all stops in a relentless deadly mind game.  Conrad directs a flawless nightmare with crisp photography by Sam Leavitt to give it a sixties film-noirish look that trancends the James Bond/Hitchcockian films around at that time.  Warner Archive releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen DVD-R transfer making it an important find in this modern day mundane film world of sequels and remakes.  The great George Dunning gives us a beautiful jazzy music score and you'll see blink or you'll miss performances by great character actors such as Michael Pate, Steve Ihnat, Strother Martin, Richard Kiel, and an important cameo by actress Viveca Linfors.  A film worthy of rediscovery, 'BRAINSTORM' is actor/director William Conrad's masterpiece and should be seen by every lover of mystery/psych puzzle films.  Jeffrey Hunter and Anne Francis alone are worth the price of the purchase.
