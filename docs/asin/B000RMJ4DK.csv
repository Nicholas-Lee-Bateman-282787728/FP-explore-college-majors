1082586,A38QCOK7NAWOGP,B000RMJ4DK,Lisa Gaudiosi,"[4, 4]","I have a couple of DVDs that deals with Princess Diana, I have to say this one gives her justice as to who she is! The acting is great and tells how her last days were and the great person she was! The only downfall of the DVD is the details said its 120 minutes and fullscreen, but its only 90 minutes and widescreen, at least the one I have is! I highly recommend this one because it shows how she felt and what she went through the last few moments of her life!",5,Princess Diana Movie that gives justice!,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,464,"['have', 'couple', 'DVDs', 'deals', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'justice', 'who', 'acting', 'great', 'how', 'last', 'days', 'were', 'great', 'person', 'was', 'only', 'downfall', 'DVD', 'details', 'said', '120', 'minutes', 'fullscreen', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'widescreen', 'least', 'one', 'have', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'how', 'felt', 'what', 'went', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'life']",Diana: Last Days of a Princess
1082587,A1PV7LMABA0D62,B000RMJ4DK,Margaret Yim,"[29, 29]","I highly recommend this docu-drama to anyone who is even remotely interested in the late Diana, Princess of Wales.  I've read over 20 biographies about Diana (carefully avoiding what I'd consider to be the really gossipy renditions of her life) and I feel this DVD accurately portrays the characters and events that finally led to the tragedy in an objective, unbiased manner.  I really enjoyed all of the actors' potrayals, but I especially liked the way the actor who portrayed Mohammed Al Fayed played his part.  He did it beautifully, just as I have imagined this colorful character to be.",5,Diana:  Last Days of a Princess,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,593,"['highly', 'recommend', 'docu-drama', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'late', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales', ""'ve"", 'read', '20', 'biographies', 'Diana', 'carefully', 'avoiding', 'what', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'really', 'gossipy', 'renditions', 'life', 'feel', 'DVD', 'accurately', 'characters', 'events', 'finally', 'led', 'tragedy', 'objective', 'unbiased', 'manner', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'potrayals', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Mohammed', 'Al', 'Fayed', 'played', 'part', 'did', 'beautifully', 'just', 'have', 'imagined', 'colorful', 'character', 'be']",Diana: Last Days of a Princess
