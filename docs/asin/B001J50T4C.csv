I won't lie...this was mindless torture for the first 20 minutes of the film. Also talk about some serious loose ends. Why hadn't any police come? I mean two or three people were kidnapped by this couple. Since the guy was friends with &#34;dad&#34; that's even more weird there was no police scene. Also it never really explained Lena's real family at all. And it would have been so much more climatic if the boy would have talked in the end and stood up against the parents with Lena. Plus I think the director or whoever was too obsessed with the sex appeal.The porn on the TV at breakfast was extremely overkill, even though they were showing how nuts the family is...that seemed obvious already.Plus maybe its just me because my best friend is British but I found the film slightly racist against British people. Not saying people are only psychos in America, there's plenty of psychos in England but I just hated how they used all the British terms by these psychos and made the british terms sound...i don't know, horrifying.If I had to choose between this and &#34;The Woman&#34; as a fave disturbing flick, I'd choose The Woman because at least The Woman had a story and not so many loose ends. Plus this was just...difficult to watch and just awful. I think if it would have had more of a story to it then I would like it more...but for the most part it was mindless torture throughout the entire film.No story as to WHY this couple torture kids (yea ok their nuts but still), no story why the British girl seems so happy with living with too lunatics. Yeah okay she's nuts to but at her AGE there should at least be some kind of fear or something.I only give it three stars instead of 1 because it was good enough for me to watch till the end but honestly its not worth buying at all...or even renting.",3,Disturbing....Plotless torture film,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1905,"['normally', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'horror', 'flicks', 'also', 'find', ""'torture"", 'ones', 'be', 'interesting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'was', 'mindless', 'torture', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Also', 'talk', 'serious', 'loose', 'ends', 'Why', 'had', ""n't"", 'police', 'come', 'mean', 'two', 'three', 'people', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'couple', 'guy', 'was', 'friends', '34', 'dad', '34', 'even', 'more', 'weird', 'was', 'police', 'scene', 'Also', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Lena', 'real', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'climatic', 'boy', 'would', 'have', 'talked', 'end', 'stood', 'up', 'parents', 'Lena', 'think', 'director', 'whoever', 'was', 'too', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'porn', 'TV', 'breakfast', 'was', 'extremely', 'overkill', 'even', 'were', 'showing', 'how', 'nuts', 'family', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'already.Plus', 'maybe', 'just', 'best', 'friend', 'British', 'found', 'film', 'slightly', 'racist', 'British', 'people', 'Not', 'saying', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'psychos', 'America', 'plenty', 'psychos', 'England', 'just', 'hated', 'how', 'used', 'British', 'terms', 'psychos', 'made', 'british', 'terms', 'sound', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'horrifying.If', 'had', 'choose', '34', 'Woman', '34', 'fave', 'disturbing', 'flick', ""'d"", 'choose', 'Woman', 'least', 'Woman', 'had', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'was', 'just', 'difficult', 'watch', 'just', 'awful', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'story', 'then', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'mindless', 'torture', 'entire', 'film.No', 'story', 'WHY', 'couple', 'torture', 'kids', 'yea', 'ok', 'nuts', 'still', 'story', 'why', 'British', 'girl', 'so', 'happy', 'living', 'too', 'lunatics', 'nuts', 'AGE', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'kind', 'fear', 'something.I', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'till', 'end', 'honestly', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'even', 'renting']",Mum And Dad 2008

1205248,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B001J50T4C,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","This sick and twisted flick is one of the first Exploitation films out of England in decades. Clearly influenced by the works of Pete Walker, Tobe Hooper, and Wes Craven, MUM & DAD tells the tale of a poor Polish immigrant that is kidnapped and tortured by a perverted family led by mum and dad, who take pleasure in inflicting pain and sexual torments on the new family 'pet.' The film encompasses all of the same qualities and standards that would have had it banned under the Video Nasties act in the 1980s, depicting disgusting and brutal acts of violence in a downward degenerative spiral without tapping in to any sort of social commentary or redeeming moral consequence. It is purely Exploitation for the sake of Exploitation. It also provides critics with a perfect example used to justify their demeaning term ""Torture Porn,"" since the film blends elements of both within its perverse framework. While all of this would seem to belittle the film, it actually has quite the opposite effect. MUM & DAD is one of the few films to achieve the same disgusting and unsettling moods generated in the first wave of true Exploitation films since the early 80s. In all of its nastiness, it provides two powerful and hated villains that are sure to draw an immediate emotive response from the viewer. The exclusion of any musical score leaves the audience defenseless as they are forced into uncomfortably close and intimate quarters with the events unfolding on screen. It often recalls the stronger elements of FRIGHTMARE, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and even THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS, and provides great technical work, design, and acting for a film that was made for under $100,000'. MUM & DAD is not a perfect film, however it does its best to recreate an era of film sleaze that is rarely recaptured in recent Horror efforts.

Shot like a kitchen sink drama but with the mean spirited nature that is prevalent in the horror genre at the moment - ''Mum and Dad'' is one sick puppy that like others who venture down this road, fails in comparison to the 70s homegrown horror big hitters like ''Texas Chainsaw'' and ''Halloween'' which it is so desperately trying to emulate.The story has Lena (played well by Olga Fedori), a young polish cleaner working the nightshift at an airport in London. There, she unwittingly befriends brother and sister duo Birdie and Elbie. Enticing Lena back to their home, she is then tortured for the rest of the movie by the pseudo siblings' monsterous parentage, the mum and dad of the title.Essaying 'Dad' is 1980s British comedy actor and Shane Meadows regular Perry Benson. His portrayal is ugly and off putting, and a million miles away from his comedic roles such as 'You Rang M'Lord'. 'Mum' played by Dido Miles, is another abomination and her deviant nature is depicted in graphic detail.Across the board, the movie is well acted and observed in a usual british, gritty reality. Sheils' direction is paced well and he has an eye for the bizarre, however his screenplay is nothing more than what you have already seen before in other movies of this ilk which have used their obvious budgetary limitations to a much better use. The film does feel in parts like an overlong episode of the UK TV series 'The Royal Family' if uncle leatherface came to stay. I assume the main characters were modeled after recent tabloid british serial killers and this seeps through into the atmosphere and feel of the film and does add a sense of authenticity to the proceedings - however, from my old man and jaded point of view, it all feels a little stale and I really wish this 'toture porn' cycle would come to it's end soon. It really is a shame as this could have been a contender, but again the hype surrounding the film is inaccurate and only there to give the film notoriety. Just a shame it doesn't warrant it.

1205261,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B001J50T4C,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 3]","Reading the reviews for this movie made me excited to see this film, they say it was pretty sick and twisted, and I like that sort of thing. But this failed to get my blood pumping at all.The plot is of a girl from Poland who starts working in the U.K as a cleaner in an airport and she makes friends with a co-worker and her brother. She misses her bus ride home and the new friends offer to let her stay at there place for the night. Once at the home, things go bad for her, as she finds the co-workers are psychos and there parents are even worse. She becomes there hostage and they make her call the parents mum and dad. Dad likes to kill and torture people I guess, and mum I think liked to cook them up, or something like that. She spends her time as a hostage either exploring the house, or trying to find a way to escape. The outcome of the movie is pretty predictable.What the movie made me think was it is kind of an adaption of the Addams Family, only not mysterious and cookey, but more like the family of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Adams Family gone psycho I guess I'm trying to say. A lot of things make little sense in the movie, or at least if they where explained, I didn't care enough to pay attention to understand it. At times it seemed like two different filmmakers where making he same movie, but not collaborating on what their ideas where.I give the movie 2 and a half stars. It's watchable, it isn't boring, but it's not really the sort of thing I would watch again. Not from fear or anything like that, just that once you have seen it, it doesn't have much of a replay value-esq to it.As for what the reviewers called sick and dark... it's nothing really. It was more funny some of the scenes they're talking about. but to me, the filmmaker needed to expand more on those things. The things the father does, or even the family do, just needed to be expanded, as it just felt out of place in some areas of things that happen and are seen. The balance just wasn't quite right.

Something of an understatement here when given the kind of 'family' involved.Polish immigrant worker at an airport finds herself stranded for the night in her work colleague's home and ends up staying much longer than expected, being held captive and made to live as part of the mad family set-up, with ma and pa and the work colleague and her brother, whom never speaks a word throughout the entire movie. (No doubt he's been too traumatised by the goings-on to ever find his voice again!).Apparently the director wanted a British version of a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" type movie, but in my view he succeeds in making a far superior film to that old cult classic, which I found myself quickly bored with owing to the tedious, nonstop screaming of Marilyn Chambers, the 'heroine' of TCM.In fact, in my opinion, ""Mum and Dad"" is better than all of the TCM movies (including the remake) and Hostel movies put together. It is far more interesting, and believable. It has realistic and credible effects, nothing OTT silly like the hanging eyeball sequence in the first ""Hostel"" film, an effect that was frankly ludicrous and destroyed any credibility the movie had had up until then.  I had found myself soon bored with ""Hostel"" anyway.  Not so with ""Mum and Dad"" which managed to keep my interest absorbed throughout.Unlike the tiresome screaming of Chambers in TCM, which only served to make the movie irritating, our heroine in ""Mum and Dad""  makes you root for her all the way. This girl used her intelligence to think of cunning ways to extricate herself from the horrendous situation, instead of resorting to mindless screaming like Chambers did in ""Chainsaw"". (Though admittedly, this one would not have been able to make much of a noise, as she'd been injected to silence her voice, at least at first).The movie also has a great theme tune, a haunting. traditional song called ""900 Miles"" sung by Gemma Ray. You get to hear it a lot on the DVD's menu.The DVD also boasts some interesting extras, including the director's admission that the movie only cost 100,000 to make. Which, in my estimation makes this film even more of an achievement.There are interviews with most of the leading cast, though strangely minus one with our heroine, making me wonder if perhaps she had declined to be interviewed, as it seemed a little odd that the main character was not asked to give some input into the interviews.To sum up, a great effort, and well done to all concerned.

The story is simple: a lonely girl meets another girl while cleaning toilets on an airport. She misses her bus and accepts help from the colleague. So lonely girl goes to other girl's home and - bang! - she is imprisoned by the family. A sadistic family beyond limits.The good things about this film:It's all beautifully made. The violence is top notch and everything is made to get your worst reaction. There's one scene, where Dad is masturbating with the help of ""some piece of meat cut from someone"" and when he finishes and puts the meat down, you can see the semen oozing from it... yes, it's shocking! So the extreme violence IS extreme. The Christmas party is another chocking moment with victims as deco.Interesting that this film is one of a handful of projects (ten) produced by Microwave... all made under $200.000 that are supposed to discover new directing talents. And that is surprising because they did an excellent job with such a budget. And in fact, this film looks like it cost much more than just that - which is amazing.The bad things about this film:I don't know... I think those torture films are so boring. You can do the laundry and leave the film playing and there's almost no story to miss... except that when the next torture set piece begins the screams will alert you that something is going on. You stop what you're doing (laundry) for five minutes, take a look, get shocked, say ""ok, next!"" and resume laundry until more screams.What can I say, I miss story. I miss a great screenplay - something that's very rare in horror movies nowadays[...]But that's MY opinion... If you want to be shocked, get this film ASAP... and I DO admit that this film is very good on the ""torture/cruelty/visceral/exploitation"" horror sub-genre, miles above the 90% of what is produced today.It is recommended IF you love the said genre.I used to like it in 2005...Now...

Written and directed by Steven Sheil, this low budget movie has good production values, and features some impressive, even chilling acting performances.Lena (Olga Fedori) is a Polish emigrant working the night shift at Heathrow Airport, as part of a janitorial crew that includes Birdy (Ainsley Howard), and her mute brother Elbie (Toby Alexander).  After work, Lena misses her bus, and goes along with Birdy to her home, which is located next to a remote part of the runway.  Upon entering the darkened home, Lena is hit on the head, injected with a drug, and awakens unable to speak.  A prisoner in a darkened room, she sees Birdy's bloodstained ""Dad"" (Perry Benson), emerge from another room carrying a bloody hammer.  Lena learns that she belongs to ""Mum"" (Dido Miles), and later Dad informs her that she must abide by his rules.While Lena's arms are tied up over her head, Mum proceeds to torture her, piercing her belly, and then using a scalpel to make a series of cuts on her back.  After this initiation to ""the family"", Lena is given menial chores during the day, and tied to her bed at night.  Showing no compassion, Birdie cruelly teases Lena and tries to make things hard for her.Observing severed human remains being disposed of, a terrified Lena is constantly looking for an opportunity to escape.  When one such attempt fails, a business associate of Dad's earns a kiss from Lena, who is bundled up in a suitcase, and beaten with a mallet.  As cruel as that is, she actually appears to get off lightly, surviving the ordeal without having her head caved in, or any bones shattered.Lena's wrists are customarily tied together, with a metal cable which is attached to her bed or some other object, to keep her from escaping.  Still, she manages to sneak out of her room, and investigating, finds another girl also tied to a bed, and in another room, a young man tied to the floor.  Lena returns to her room with a weapon, and the realization that her time in the family may be coming to a close.  The situation becomes critical at Christmas, when the man she saw earlier has been transformed into a macabre holiday ornament.  As she waits in her room for Dad's arrival, Lena knows that she must act if she is to live.Although she is cowering in fear at the beginning, perhaps feeling that she has nothing left to lose, Lena is openly defiant towards Dad at the end.  Remarkably, once Lena springs into action, she doesn't let anything, or anyone get in her way.  Only when freedom is achieved, does her raw emotion pour out.The story is pretty solid, although there is an issue concerning the way Lena is restrained.  Metal cable and leather bindings are used, with a simple threaded link used to join one section of cable to another.  Instead of trying to work the link loose with physical pressure, several times an agitated Lena dramatically yanks on the cable struggling to escape.  Plainly, being cinematic triumphs over reality, but it is a weak point.  A threaded link is even shown becoming separated, which allows Lena to have her hands free at the crucial moment that Dad arrives with his Christmas surprise.Mum And Dad was shot in just 17 days, and while it is a bit rough in spots, it maintains a pretty macabre tone and suspenseful atmosphere throughout, although the timeline isn't well defined.  While the story could easily have been more brutal and explicit, Steven Sheil's film still delivers some shocks, and plenty of gross perversions.  All the acting performances are outstanding, and spot on.  Olga Fedori is excellent, even though at times Lena is unable to speak, Fedori is able to convey exactly what is required.  Perry Benson is delightfully wicked, as the demented and belligerent Dad, Dido Miles is eerie and cold as Mum, and Ainsley Howard is terrific, as the snotty and bitchy Birdy.  If you enjoy twisted British horror, give this sick ""family feature"" a watch.",4,sick tale of abduction and abuse...,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,4112,"['British', 'have', 'long', 'had', 'rather', 'quirky', 'dark', 'sensibilities', 'when', 'horror', 'Mum', 'Dad', '2008', 'rather', 'harsh', 'tale', 'abduction', 'abuse', 'well-established', 'tradition', 'Written', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Sheil', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'impressive', 'even', 'chilling', 'acting', 'performances.Lena', 'Olga', 'Fedori', 'Polish', 'emigrant', 'working', 'night', 'shift', 'Heathrow', 'Airport', 'part', 'janitorial', 'crew', 'Birdy', 'Ainsley', 'Howard', 'mute', 'brother', 'Elbie', 'Toby', 'Alexander', 'work', 'Lena', 'bus', 'along', 'Birdy', 'home', 'located', 'next', 'remote', 'part', 'runway', 'entering', 'darkened', 'home', 'Lena', 'hit', 'head', 'injected', 'drug', 'unable', 'speak', 'prisoner', 'darkened', 'room', 'Birdy', 'bloodstained', 'Dad', 'Perry', 'Benson', 'emerge', 'room', 'carrying', 'bloody', 'hammer', 'Lena', 'Mum', 'Dido', 'Miles', 'later', 'Dad', 'must', 'abide', 'rules.While', 'Lena', 'arms', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'head', 'Mum', 'torture', 'piercing', 'belly', 'then', 'using', 'scalpel', 'make', 'series', 'cuts', 'back', 'initiation', 'family', 'Lena', 'given', 'menial', 'chores', 'day', 'tied', 'bed', 'night', 'Showing', 'compassion', 'Birdie', 'cruelly', 'Lena', 'tries', 'make', 'things', 'hard', 'her.Observing', 'severed', 'human', 'being', 'disposed', 'terrified', 'Lena', 'constantly', 'looking', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'When', 'one', 'such', 'attempt', 'fails', 'business', 'associate', 'Dad', 'kiss', 'Lena', 'who', 'bundled', 'up', 'suitcase', 'beaten', 'mallet', 'As', 'cruel', 'actually', 'get', 'off', 'lightly', 'surviving', 'ordeal', 'having', 'head', 'caved', 'bones', 'shattered.Lena', 'wrists', 'are', 'customarily', 'tied', 'together', 'metal', 'cable', 'attached', 'bed', 'other', 'object', 'keep', 'escaping', 'Still', 'sneak', 'room', 'investigating', 'girl', 'also', 'tied', 'bed', 'room', 'young', 'man', 'tied', 'floor', 'Lena', 'room', 'weapon', 'realization', 'time', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'close', 'situation', 'critical', 'Christmas', 'when', 'man', 'saw', 'earlier', 'been', 'transformed', 'macabre', 'holiday', 'ornament', 'room', 'Dad', 'arrival', 'Lena', 'must', 'act', 'cowering', 'fear', 'beginning', 'perhaps', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'Lena', 'openly', 'defiant', 'towards', 'Dad', 'end', 'Remarkably', 'once', 'Lena', 'springs', 'action', ""n't"", 'let', 'anything', 'anyone', 'get', 'way', 'Only', 'when', 'freedom', 'achieved', 'raw', 'emotion', 'pour', 'out.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'solid', 'issue', 'concerning', 'way', 'Lena', 'restrained', 'Metal', 'cable', 'leather', 'bindings', 'are', 'used', 'simple', 'threaded', 'link', 'used', 'join', 'one', 'section', 'cable', 'Instead', 'trying', 'work', 'link', 'loose', 'physical', 'pressure', 'several', 'times', 'agitated', 'Lena', 'dramatically', 'cable', 'struggling', 'escape', 'Plainly', 'being', 'cinematic', 'triumphs', 'reality', 'weak', 'point', 'threaded', 'link', 'even', 'shown', 'becoming', 'separated', 'Lena', 'have', 'hands', 'free', 'crucial', 'moment', 'Dad', 'Christmas', 'surprise.Mum', 'Dad', 'was', 'shot', 'just', '17', 'days', 'bit', 'rough', 'spots', 'pretty', 'macabre', 'tone', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere', 'timeline', ""n't"", 'well', 'defined', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'brutal', 'explicit', 'Steven', 'Sheil', 'film', 'still', 'shocks', 'plenty', 'gross', 'perversions', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'spot', 'Olga', 'Fedori', 'excellent', 'even', 'times', 'Lena', 'unable', 'speak', 'Fedori', 'able', 'convey', 'exactly', 'what', 'required', 'Perry', 'Benson', 'delightfully', 'wicked', 'demented', 'belligerent', 'Dad', 'Dido', 'Miles', 'eerie', 'cold', 'Mum', 'Ainsley', 'Howard', 'terrific', 'snotty', 'bitchy', 'Birdy', 'enjoy', 'twisted', 'British', 'horror', 'give', 'sick', 'family', 'feature', 'watch']",Mum And Dad 2008
