I absolutely recommend this for every aspect of the production. Top cast, top directing, top action, top for historical content, top for costumes, top for locations. I just can't find anything in this series that I did not like. I am amazed at how inexpensive the series has become, but it might be almost out of stock. If you haven't seen it, it is a must. If you have thought of purchasing, with these prices, I would not hesitate. There is another series that came later which has Jumong's grandson and son as lead roles. This is wonderful history combined with a very attractive cast and great action. Will definitely keep you watching and hungry for the next chapters. I am very glad I made this purchase. Many top actors appear in this production. Again, these are the prime dvd's to own. They are so well produced with clarity and the best sub-titles written with no errors and easy to read. I treasure productions like this as there was no time sparred in producing a wonderful series. I hope all Korean drama companies, learn from the pain staking practice of Ya Entertainment. I can't say enough about the quality of that company and the saddness I feel as I will no longer be able to depend on them for the confidence I feel in purchasing their many series. I wish there was a way to keep Ya from leaving us. I thank you, at Ya, for the many productions I own. I thank Amazon for making them available for purchase.",5,First series I purchased,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,1508,"['thought', 'had', 'reviewed', 'series', 'tied', '1', 'favorite', 'series', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'aspect', 'production', 'Top', 'cast', 'top', 'directing', 'top', 'action', 'top', 'historical', 'content', 'top', 'costumes', 'top', 'locations', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'inexpensive', 'series', 'become', 'might', 'be', 'almost', 'stock', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'purchasing', 'prices', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'series', 'came', 'later', 'Jumong', 'grandson', 'son', 'lead', 'roles', 'wonderful', 'history', 'combined', 'very', 'attractive', 'cast', 'great', 'action', 'Will', 'definitely', 'keep', 'watching', 'hungry', 'next', 'chapters', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'made', 'purchase', 'Many', 'top', 'actors', 'appear', 'production', 'Again', 'are', 'prime', 'dvd', 'own', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'produced', 'clarity', 'best', 'sub-titles', 'written', 'errors', 'easy', 'read', 'treasure', 'productions', 'like', 'was', 'time', 'sparred', 'producing', 'wonderful', 'series', 'hope', 'Korean', 'drama', 'companies', 'learn', 'pain', 'staking', 'practice', 'Ya', 'Entertainment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'quality', 'company', 'saddness', 'feel', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'depend', 'confidence', 'feel', 'purchasing', 'many', 'series', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'keep', 'Ya', 'leaving', 'thank', 'Ya', 'many', 'productions', 'own', 'thank', 'Amazon', 'making', 'available', 'purchase']",N/A

Bears wisely hibernate away long, miserable winters and now so could webut unlike them we could be utterly engaged and delighted.Did anyone notice the way our heroine reached out her hand and pulled a strand of Chumong's hair as he was laying on the ground fromhis fight just before he made his beyond exquisite I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU speech to her. Notice the perfect "" choreography"" of their faces and facial expressions as he tries to tell herwho he really is and she in this budding love scene is half amused and half intrigued with this bold, ""off the wall"" stranger.Notice how the romantic violins come in just after he approaches herand utters those magnificently charged words, ""I have something to tell you."" Pure genius on the part of the director and the two actors. A Korean glance, a Korean look can often replaceand ""outmean"" thousands of our own English words.

I enjoyed it so much that when I started the last cd I got back on line to Amazon and ordered the remaining 3 Volumes (2-4). Expensive? Yes! But for me, it was well worth it. Fact is, it was very hard to stop once I got started, but getting up way before dawn, I had to force myself to stop each night. Needless to say, a few weekends not much got done around the house. Well, I did take a putt over to my HD dealer for morning coffee on Saturday mornings b'fore starting up the day watching more episodes.A few days later I started back at Volumn 1 and since I knew the characters, things made more sense (to me). I'll be watching this series completely through again in the future. Oh yeah, one nice thing is that there are a couple of booklets provided. I read part of them at first, but read them through once I completed the last volumn. One other item I really appreciated is that the captions in English were on long enough for me to read. I've never like captions in the past, but I've enjoyed the Korean dramas so much that I've gotten used to and appreciate them being there (wouldn't understand a thing otherwise).If you like these types of dramas, you will not be disappointed with this one.",5,Great,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1337,"['Started', 'watching', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'TV', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'one', 'buy', 'Checked', 'reviews', 'Jumong', 'purchased', 'Volume', '1', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'started', 'last', 'cd', 'got', 'back', 'line', 'Amazon', 'ordered', 'remaining', '3', 'Volumes', '2-4', 'Expensive', 'Yes', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'Fact', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'stop', 'once', 'got', 'started', 'getting', 'up', 'way', 'dawn', 'had', 'force', 'stop', 'night', 'Needless', 'say', 'few', 'not', 'much', 'got', 'done', 'house', 'Well', 'did', 'take', 'putt', 'HD', 'dealer', 'morning', 'coffee', 'Saturday', 'mornings', ""b'fore"", 'starting', 'up', 'day', 'watching', 'more', 'episodes.A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'started', 'back', 'Volumn', '1', 'knew', 'characters', 'things', 'made', 'more', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'series', 'completely', 'again', 'future', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'nice', 'thing', 'are', 'couple', 'booklets', 'provided', 'read', 'part', 'first', 'read', 'once', 'completed', 'last', 'volumn', 'One', 'other', 'item', 'really', 'appreciated', 'captions', 'English', 'were', 'long', 'enough', 'read', ""'ve"", 'never', 'captions', 'past', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'appreciate', 'being', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'thing', 'otherwise', '.If', 'types', 'dramas', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one']",N/A
