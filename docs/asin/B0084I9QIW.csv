That's a real lie. Come on! Blu-Ray SUCKS! The imagery and picture quality are just FINE! I bought this DVD of the concert at Wal-Mart and I don't usually buy a lot of entertainment (CDs/DVDs) from Wal-Mart. I may not have a flat screen HD TV in my bedroom but I have two downstairs in my home and all of them produce great visual quality with this Concert DVD. My old Tube TV also has ""high quality"" even though it's not an HD TV. It doesn't matter what type of TV you have or what the Quality is that the DVD was produced with. People need glasses. There's nothing wrong with the quality. The images are crystal clear as if you're right there in the audience seeing the King of Pop live.I would definitely recommend this concert DVD to any MJ die hard fan. Or even someone who just likes watching him dance and sing on stage making magic wherever he is. Whatever the case of what type of Fan you are, I'd still tell the world to buy this DVD. I know I absolutely love it. Who needs HD and Blu-Ray? Not me for one. Some things are just better watched in it's almost original formats.

1546077,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B0084I9QIW,Georgio Alfani,"[95, 95]","First things first. I've been wanting this Bad tour for so long that I felt the day would never come and it finally has. I woke up at 7:30Am just to be at Target at 8am when they opened to buy this thing. Now that I finally have it I'm in disbelief.Over the period when this DVD wasn't available I searched the internet, high and low, to the farthest corners of the world wide web just to find footage of this epic concert and I can't tell you how many horrible bootlegs of this tour I've had to endure. The only one worthy of viewing as far as quality wise was the Bad in Japan tour September 12, 1987 at the Krokuen Stadium, which is available on youtube. It is an actual edited and directed show and the quality was like a worn out VHS tape at best. I dreamed of when an official copy would come out.Now we got this! This show is exceptional! The quality is super VHS with a good job at converting it to DVD. It looks way better than how it would look on your VCR but don't expect for it to be high definition or anything. I'm pretty sure some technical freaks are going to complain, claiming a better transfer could have been done but I doubt it. I've transferred VHS to DVD before and in my opinion this is one of the best jobs I have ever seen. You also have to remember this VHS tape is 25 years old! And yes, this is far far far better than youtube quality, trust me. I've seen all those youtube concerts this is way better.AND DON'T LISTEN TO THAT REVIEWER WHO SAYS THAT THE PRODUCERS FORMATTED THIS INTO WIDESCREEN AND THAT IT STRETCHES THE IMAGE TO MAKE MJ LOOK AWKWARD!! THAT PERSON IS A FOOL WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE FEATURES OF THEIR OWN TV! This dvd is formatted in the 4:3 aspect ratio, not 16:9 letterbox!!! To the person who said that: check your remote or TV manual to fix that, man!The real gem is the 5.1 Dolby sound and the fact that it is one of the greatest concerts of all time. A concert MJ performed for Princess Diana.My only gripe was how some of the show's theatrics were missing when compared to the Japan one. Like the guitarist with the crazy hair when she does her ""Beat It"" guitar solo, no laser shoots out from her guitar like in the Japan one which was so awesome! Also on this DVD there is a 10 minute interlude where MJ's band jam out while MJ takes a break/changes wardrobe. This was okay (Snack/Bathroom break) but I'd rather have seen a performance of a song that was excluded from this show and was performed in the Japan one, such as songs like ""Shake Your Body"" and ""My Lovely One"" but I guess even the King deserves a 10 minute break, ha ha! I also noticed that the directing in the Japan one was just a tad more creative and innovative. All this is not a bad thing just an observation. Nevertheless this DVD has the better set of songs and is a 100% MJ, no footage of fans (I'll elaborate more on this later) and I can't be any more happier!The performances of ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Man in the Mirror"" were the the best in my opinion. they literally gave me chills. It's hard to believe just how much energy MJ has! He just keeps dancing and movinglike a machine. It's simply amazing. Another great thing about this performance in contrast to the Japan one is that it included way more singles off the ""Bad"" album. The only tracks from the ""Bad"" album in the Japan one were ""Bad"" and ""i can't Stop Loving You."" This DVD has all the hit singles from the ""Bad"" album except ""The Way You Make Me Feel,"" but the producers of this DVD were smart  and caring enough to put a performance of ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" as a bonus feature and it is an excellent performance that is in slightly lesser visual quality than the main feature. THANK YOU TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS DVD FOR THAT!!!Another great special feature is the fact that they have two songs from the actual Japan tour i mentioned and when you see them you'll notice that the visual quality is way better than this main feature. The reason why they chose to give the London performance the special treatment is because the sound quality is way better because it was recorded on a multi-track. Nevertheless it was awesome of the producers to include some footage from the Japan tour that i mentioned.In comparison with the previously released ""Dangerous tour"" DVD, the directing of this concert was way better! The problem and only problem with the ""Dangerous"" recording was that for the first half of the DVD they show too much footage of the fans passing out when they should have focused on MJ and his performance. I'm glad to say that this DVD is 100% MJ!!!! There's no footage of fans passing out every 20 seconds like in the ""Dangerous"" tour or cuts to poorly lit and underexposed footage of fans like in the Japan version. The directing for this concert focuses all it's energy on MJ and the stage, as it should. This is the real gem of this DVD and why I would choose this over all the other performances available, be it bootleg or an officially released DVD. This is ""the one.""As far as the packaging goes, it is a cardboard case with pictures of fans, MJ, and Princess Diana all over. It comes with a beautiful picture book that lists every single concert date for this famous and legendary tour. my only problem with the case is that it doesn't include a snap case for the actual DVD, instead you have to slide it in and out of a cardboard sleeve. Honestly every time I take it out I'm afraid I'll scratch it, so be careful when you pull it out and check to see if taking it out or putting it in actually does scratch it. The jury is still out on this aspect of the case.This is an amazing DVD. Buy it. You won't regret it. For the price it is an absolute bargain. You'll get chills, you'll dance and you'll cry. I know I did. Thank you for finally getting it right Sony (never thought I'd ever say that!)",5,FINALLY!

The good news is that MJ is on top of his game here and gives a great performance, but the video quality is absolutely not up to par. I think it stinks, compared to todays standards. As a perfectionist, my guess is that he would not have wanted this released, because of this. This is ""clearly"" a money grab...The video quality is VHS like and there's no debating that. IMO, this release should be purchased by only the hardest core MJ fans or ""completists"". I regret my purchase. It was an impulse purchase at a big box store. Because of the poor video quality, even two stars is kind...I don't think I'll be watching again. Overall, Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest, is a far superior DVD. It's video quality is night & day compared to this one. Also, I suggest buying some ""pro shot"" bootlegs of his more recent concerts if you want HD or modern quality. There are many, if you look...I wish reviewers would give honest, non biased reviews/critiques...Update, Interesting how people are (still)giving this 5 stars while admitting the video quality stinks...? Most of us prefer that people rate the product, not the film itself...Objective vs. subjective...Many of us rely on ratings when making purchases but so many somehow blindly look past the poor picture quality. They're rating MJ, not the DVD...and that doesn't make much sense. I guess thats where the term 'fanatic' comes into play. This DVD is actually made from a VHS tape and it shows.

Growing up listening to MJ, the Bad era was and still by far my favorite and ever since I watched his Bucharest concert when it first aired I always wondered if we would see any older concerts at all. All I can say that it's a shame they kept this locked up for so long, but now that we have it all I can say now is FINALLY!I am very happy with this release. I feel this performance exceeded that of the Dangerous concert. The entire focus was MJ and the band and if there was anything that defined the art of music and performance this is it. MJ performed songs in this concert that he has not performed since like ""This Place Hotel"", ""Dirty Diana"", ""Rock With You"". Plus, we still get the good stuff like, ""Beat It"", ""Billie jean"", etc. You see MJ was having fun in this concertas he smiled a lot more and was very energetic. Every performance was high energy. MJ is a prime example of being one with music. Also the band gets some time to shine as they have a little jam session in mid-show which I think was pretty cool.I see many people complained about the video qulaity. Well we get what we can get. Besides, this was ripped from the original VHS recordings so the footage can only be restored so much. Considering what we have in this release it's really not bad. I just think many of us have been spoiled with HD we expect everything in HD. This is a good release so don't let that get you down.

And of course the Rock With You and Man in the MIrror performances as well.Not thrilled about the I Just Can't Stop Loving You performance, but it's not because of Michael, but because of Sheryl. Her voice leaves A LOT to be desired.His dancing is mesmerizing and I thoroughly enjoyed the musical break when musical director Greg Phillinganes and Co. were rocking out!!I was smiling from ear-to-ear when he introduced the backup singers, musicians and his dancers at the very end.

I actually went to the Dangerous concerts but never got to see the Bad concerts apart from some of the unofficial ones on tape which were poor quality so I waited a long time for this DVD.To say this DVD is earth-shattering is an understatement, the concert is raw, dynamic and totally exhilarating.  The best thing about it are the close-ups of Michael, you will never see him up-close like this ever.  Of course we are used to seeing his energy which always lights up a stage but in this concert you see him at his very best, his movement is amazing and you see a happy Michael who is at the top of his game musically and dance-wise.  The vocals are incredible, the sound from this DVD is sharp, clear - almost electric and it pierces through the speakers.This is taken from Michael's personal tapes which were Super VHS.  In case you don't know Super VHS is almost equivalent in quality to DVD so the quality overall is excellent.  No it is not HD but lets be honest, if you really want to see a 'raw' concert then you don't need it.  This fits in with the time of the concert which was in 1988.I am not going to speak about all the individual songs, every one is incredible and shows the different dimensions of Michael but I will say that Dirty Diana is my favorite.  Michael is known for his ballads but he is the perfect live Rock musician and Jennifer Batten with her distinctive mane of bright white hair is a brilliant accompaniment to MJ.  The performance is awesome, the singing, the guitar, the energy - he blasts you out of the stadium!I can't recommend this concert enough, if you want to see Michael as we were always supposed to see him then this is the concert to watch.  In my opinion it is better than Dangerous and even History which I also saw live.Last note: Michael Jackson is a genius and one the best live performers ever, we should respect his legacy and this is a part of it that should not be missed.Track Listing as follows:Live at Wembley Stadium July 16, 19881.
