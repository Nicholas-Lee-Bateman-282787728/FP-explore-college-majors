374910,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303443222,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","In besmirching the memory of Ty Cobb, whether intentionally or not, the producers of the cable TV movie COBB (1994) as proxies for sportswriter Al Stump, have actually added to the Georgia Peach's legend. It happens early in the story.Right after Al Stump (played wonderfully by Robert Wuhl) meets with Cobb (Tommy Lee Jones in one of his finest performances) at the ex-ballplayer's Nevada manse, there's a scene where the old man takes one shot with a long barreled revolver at a buck that has wandered onto his property. He does so from a second floor window and fires into a pitch dark night. The deer bolts away as Ty announces proudly that he's shot the animal's throat out. Of course Stump scoffs at this, but later he finds the dead buck on Cobb's snow-covered lawn, bloody fur near its throat.By inference, Cobb's keen eye and hand coordination are undiminished, even at age 72. I've read in several biographies that Ty quit baseball at age 42 because his knees were wrecked and his reflexes had slowed. So this story is apocryphal, but it helps to cue us that what's ahead is a piece of fiction about the arguably greatest player to ever set foot on a diamond.So, I enjoy this movie for what it is: sports-related entertainment. It's a personal favorite.Ty, ""Stumpy"" and Cobb's baseball cronies are all presented here as very flawed human beings. The other players publicly honor his career at a Cooperstown dinner but in private they tell Tyrus to go to hell. Even Mickey Cochrane, whom Cobb supported for years, gives his benefactor the thumb when Ty attempts to crash a hotel room party being attended by other Hall of Famers.Comic relief kudos go to Lou Myers as Willie, the great man's outspoken ex-servant. In a hilarious moment while Cobb, Stump and Willie are careening down a snow-clogged twisty mountain road on their way to Reno, Will sits in the car's back seat and trashes Cobb's ballplaying, naming --his-- choices for the best in every category that Ty excelled in. Not surprising, none of Willie's preferences are white. His story of Cool Papa Bell is the movie's funniest moment.Louis Prima and Keely Smith lookalikes, entertaining a late-night Reno audience, are another highlight. Ty manages to co-opt their show, and brings it to a screeching halt with his racism and vulgarities.Lolita Davidovich also gets a nod as casino cigarette girl Ramona. Her encounter with Stump and Cobb has a general ring of truth to it. Trying to bed an attractive but shy fellow (Stump), Ramona gets too drunk. Just as they're becoming friendly in Al's room, Cobb comes crashing in, totally out of control. He knocks the sportswriter unconscious and drags ""his girl"" back to his own room. It's the sort of dangerous situation that has probably occurred untold times. This actress handles a very tough scene like a pro. Our sympathies are with Ramona as she flees half-naked from Ty and Al, cursing them both, clearly sobered and perhaps wisened up.At story's end, we don't like Al Stump nearly as much as we did at its beginning. Ty Cobb is dead, in his own words, ""misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is."" He died rich in money yet destitute for lack of friends. The great tragedy is, on-field acheivements, and they are considerable, were all that mattered to the universally despised Tyrus Raymond Cobb. As he stated in the autobiography ghosted by Stump: ""Baseball was everything to me.""It's too bad people didn't matter, even a tiny bit, to this man.",4,"""A prince and a great man has fallen.""",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3474,"['besmirching', 'memory', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'intentionally', 'not', 'producers', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'COBB', '1994', 'proxies', 'sportswriter', 'Al', 'Stump', 'have', 'actually', 'added', 'Georgia', 'Peach', 'legend', 'early', 'story.Right', 'Al', 'Stump', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'Cobb', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'ex-ballplayer', 'Nevada', 'manse', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'man', 'one', 'shot', 'long', 'barreled', 'revolver', 'buck', 'wandered', 'property', 'so', 'second', 'floor', 'window', 'pitch', 'dark', 'night', 'deer', 'away', 'Ty', 'announces', 'proudly', 'animal', 'throat', 'out', 'course', 'Stump', 'later', 'dead', 'buck', 'Cobb', 'snow-covered', 'lawn', 'bloody', 'fur', 'throat.By', 'inference', 'Cobb', 'keen', 'eye', 'hand', 'coordination', 'are', 'undiminished', 'even', 'age', '72', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'biographies', 'Ty', 'quit', 'baseball', 'age', '42', 'knees', 'were', 'wrecked', 'reflexes', 'had', 'slowed', 'So', 'story', 'apocryphal', 'cue', 'what', 'ahead', 'piece', 'fiction', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'player', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'diamond.So', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'sports-related', 'entertainment', 'personal', 'favorite.Ty', 'Stumpy', 'Cobb', 'baseball', 'cronies', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'very', 'flawed', 'human', 'beings', 'other', 'players', 'publicly', 'honor', 'career', 'Cooperstown', 'dinner', 'private', 'tell', 'Tyrus', 'go', 'hell', 'Even', 'Mickey', 'Cochrane', 'whom', 'Cobb', 'supported', 'years', 'benefactor', 'thumb', 'when', 'Ty', 'crash', 'hotel', 'room', 'party', 'being', 'attended', 'other', 'Hall', 'Famers.Comic', 'relief', 'kudos', 'go', 'Lou', 'Myers', 'Willie', 'great', 'man', 'outspoken', 'ex-servant', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'Cobb', 'Stump', 'Willie', 'are', 'careening', 'down', 'snow-clogged', 'twisty', 'mountain', 'road', 'way', 'Reno', 'Will', 'car', 'back', 'seat', 'trashes', 'Cobb', 'ballplaying', 'naming', 'choices', 'best', 'category', 'Ty', 'excelled', 'Not', 'surprising', 'none', 'Willie', 'preferences', 'are', 'white', 'story', 'Cool', 'Papa', 'Bell', 'movie', 'funniest', 'moment.Louis', 'Prima', 'Keely', 'Smith', 'lookalikes', 'entertaining', 'late-night', 'Reno', 'audience', 'are', 'highlight', 'Ty', 'co-opt', 'show', 'screeching', 'halt', 'racism', 'vulgarities.Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'also', 'nod', 'casino', 'cigarette', 'girl', 'Ramona', 'encounter', 'Stump', 'Cobb', 'general', 'ring', 'truth', 'Trying', 'bed', 'attractive', 'shy', 'fellow', 'Stump', 'Ramona', 'too', 'drunk', 'Just', ""'re"", 'becoming', 'friendly', 'Al', 'room', 'Cobb', 'crashing', 'totally', 'control', 'sportswriter', 'unconscious', 'girl', 'back', 'own', 'room', 'sort', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'probably', 'occurred', 'untold', 'times', 'actress', 'very', 'tough', 'scene', 'pro', 'sympathies', 'are', 'Ramona', 'half-naked', 'Ty', 'Al', 'cursing', 'clearly', 'sobered', 'perhaps', 'wisened', 'up.At', 'story', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Al', 'Stump', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'beginning', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'dead', 'own', 'words', 'misunderstood', 'genius', 'genius', 'always', 'died', 'rich', 'money', 'yet', 'destitute', 'lack', 'friends', 'great', 'tragedy', 'on-field', 'acheivements', 'are', 'considerable', 'were', 'mattered', 'universally', 'despised', 'Tyrus', 'Raymond', 'Cobb', 'stated', 'autobiography', 'ghosted', 'Stump', 'was', 'everything', 'too', 'bad', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'even', 'tiny', 'bit', 'man']",Cobb VHS

Really, in the movie, the director portrayed Tommy Lee Jones's Cobb as the meanest son of a b***h that ever lived, and that's that. Whoopeee....not much of a fun. As a matter of fact, Tommy Lee Jones was actually good in his performance, and it was him that made two hours of the film to go by that fast. He was compelling and interesting at the same time, but too bad there wasn't much of substance throughout the movie. Robert Wuhl is the kind of a guy that doesn't blend in well with movies due to the naked obviousness through his face, but he did just fine for me. Ron Shelton is a guy who makes too many sport films, and most of them bad, but in this one, he did all right. And from now on, no more films from him again...thank you. The life of Ty Cobb is actually interesting when his biography is searched for and reveals a lot more information than you'll see in the film. By the way, the image of the sportswriters debating who is the greatest in a category is pathetic and sorry.

374914,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,6303443222,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[18, 23]","To me, this movie is a dark comedy.  Ty Cobb is obviously a racist, abusive mean spirited human being who also happens to be a baseball legend.  This movie is about Cobb off the field during his last days as he plans an autobiography on his baseball career.  Throughout the movie, he is verbally and physically abusive to those around him. Tommy Lee Jones manages to make his character, at times, sympathetic towards the end of the film as he gets sicker and sicker from one of his many illnesses.  This does not change the fact that Ty Cobb was a vicious human being and writer/director Ron Shelton writes the character in a way that makes him funny in some ways. I can't imagine this movie being what it is without Tommy Lee Jones.  Jones tends to play arogant know-it-all characters in movies and this one tops them all.  This movie was not a hit because of limited release(40 theaters instead of the planned 400 according to Shelton's commentary) but it is easily one of the best movies made about baseball and the people who play the game.

374917,ARWMX9M71ILUI,6303443222,Donald,"[0, 0]","The movie is entertaining and every baseball fan will enjoy the film. The question that we must ask is whether the nut created by Tommy Lee Jones was really like Ty Cobb?My Grandfather&#8217;s favorite ball player was Ty Cobb and Cobb has the highest lifetime batting average (.367) of all time. Ty Cobb stole home more than anyone else (54 times). Well written reviews of this movie have pointed out the films strengths and weaknesses. I am more interested in the story of the ballplayer my grandfather most admired.Both Ty Cobb and grandfather were born just prior to the turn of the twentieth century. A tough time when survival of the fittest wasn&#8217;t a text book theory, it was the harsh law of  working class America. Ty Cobb is quoted as having said, &#34;Every great batter works on the theory that the pitcher is more afraid of him than he is of the pitcher.&#34;Ty Cobb was tough and hated many things, but second-place was at the top of his hate list. Cobb is portrayed as a man ready to fight with anyone at the slightest grievance and Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job developing that film character.The movie is harsh on Cobb and probably exaggerates his insane aggressiveness, but it gives a sense of the devils that drove the man.  Still, in the end, Cobb&#8217;s humanity shown through. In his will, Cobb,  left a quarter of his estate to the Cobb Educational Fund, and the rest of his reputed $11 million he distributed among his children and grandchildren.One of the many investments that contributed to his early financial success was the purchase of stock in a little-known Southern beverage company called Coca-Cola. Cobb's financial prosperity eventually allowed him to establish a scholarship program that has assisted thousands of Georgians to attend college.",4,Tommy Lee Jones portrays the Ty Cobb character of Al Stump&#8217;s biography.,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,1792,"['movie', 'entertaining', 'baseball', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'question', 'must', 'ask', 'nut', 'created', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'My', 'Grandfather', '8217', 'favorite', 'ball', 'player', 'was', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'Cobb', 'highest', 'lifetime', 'batting', 'average', '.367', 'time', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'stole', 'home', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', '54', 'times', 'Well', 'written', 'reviews', 'movie', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'films', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'am', 'more', 'interested', 'story', 'ballplayer', 'grandfather', 'most', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'grandfather', 'were', 'born', 'just', 'prior', 'turn', 'twentieth', 'century', 'tough', 'time', 'when', 'survival', 'fittest', 'wasn', '8217', 'text', 'book', 'theory', 'was', 'harsh', 'law', 'working', 'class', 'America', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'quoted', 'having', 'said', '34', 'Every', 'great', 'batter', 'works', 'theory', 'pitcher', 'more', 'afraid', 'pitcher.', '34', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'was', 'tough', 'hated', 'many', 'things', 'second-place', 'was', 'top', 'hate', 'list', 'Cobb', 'portrayed', 'man', 'ready', 'fight', 'anyone', 'slightest', 'grievance', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'excellent', 'job', 'developing', 'film', 'character.The', 'movie', 'harsh', 'Cobb', 'probably', 'insane', 'aggressiveness', 'sense', 'devils', 'drove', 'man', 'Still', 'end', 'Cobb', '8217', 'humanity', 'shown', 'will', 'Cobb', 'left', 'quarter', 'estate', 'Cobb', 'Educational', 'Fund', 'rest', 'reputed', '11', 'million', 'distributed', 'children', 'grandchildren.One', 'many', 'investments', 'contributed', 'early', 'financial', 'success', 'was', 'purchase', 'stock', 'little-known', 'Southern', 'beverage', 'company', 'called', 'Coca-Cola', 'Cobb', 'financial', 'prosperity', 'eventually', 'allowed', 'establish', 'scholarship', 'program', 'assisted', 'thousands', 'Georgians', 'attend', 'college']",Cobb VHS

374921,AKON7YTSYRU2Y,6303443222,"J. Conrad Guest ""J. Conrad Guest""","[3, 4]","Make no mistake: this is Tommy Lee Jones' vehicle. Cobb was a larger than life icon both on and off the field, the first superstar in American sports, and Jones plays him larger than life.This movie, based on Al Stump's second biography of Tiger great Tyrus Raymond Cobb, is the biography Stump didn't release after Cobb's death in 1961 - that was the cleaned up version, the version Cobb wanted published, that talked of the nuts and bolts of baseball: how to steal second base, how to hit to the opposite field - all the things Cobb felt the public wanted to read about from one of the game's ""immortals.""It wasn't until the 1990s, shortly before Stump's own death, that his second biography of Cobb was released, the one that painted the darkest depths of Cobb's very complex character. He was a man driven by inner demons who, only in the end, revealed to Stump, the highest paid sports writer of that era, some of what haunted him. Stump spent several months with Cobb shortly before his death to write the story as Cobb wanted it written, but late at night he wrote the other version.Cobb was a monster, but the viewer is unable to look away, which only serves to peel away another layer of this movie: our fascination with greatness, our inability to look away, to deny ugliness in an effort to glimpse or brush up against greatness. When Stump threatens to quit before the book is finished, the result of Cobb's constant abuse and manipulation, Cobb tells him: ""You won't quit. You've never been this close to greatness.""Jones' performance in Cobb is nothing short of brilliant: some of his expressions reveal more about Cobb's character than many other, less accomplished actors, could reveal even with a page of dialogue. When Cobb pulls up in front of his daughter's home (he hasn't seen her in 15 years), she looks out the window, recognizes her father, and pulls down the shade and closes the curtains, and the viewer aches for the pain Jones reveals in his simple expression.We see Cobb as the consummate showman: ""Do you know what it's like to have 50,000 fans boo and throw things at you?"" he asks Stump. ""It's the greatest feeling in the world."" We see him at his worst: at a Reno nightclub, where he walks onstage to a cheering crowd enamored with seeing a living legend of the game, only to, within minutes, clear the room with racist slurs. We see him beat his wife and pistol whip to death in an alley a man he would later claim tried to rob him (he was later acquitted, largely in part because of his celebrity status - shades of O.J. and Kolbe Bryant). We watch him jump into the stands to beat up a fan who had no hands.And still we are unable to look away. What causes a man to act in such a way?We get a glimpse of some of Cobb's goodness: he left the largest portion of his fortune - yes, he was immensely wealthy, not so much from his playing days but from his investments in General Motors (ground floor) and Coca Cola (""Invest in Coke, Stumpy, it's coming out in cans."") - to be used to build a children's hospital, and for years he supported Mickey Cochrane, one of the game's all-time greatest catchers, and many other destitute players - ""You won't put that in the book,"" he tells Stump. ""But why not?"" Stump asks. ""Because it would embarrass Mickey.""Yet the good cannot justify the many monstrous acts; but Jones' riveting performance brings to mind another well-known monster, this one fictional, and the viewer realizes that monsters are not so much born but created, as was the Frankenstein monster, who, like Cobb, only sought to be loved and accepted. Yes, Cobb's monstrous behavior was due in part to our acceptance of that behavior, our willingness to look the other way in the presence of greatness. A telling moment in Cobb has him confessing to Stump: ""You're the best friend I have.""Only in the end do we get a glimpse of what fueled Cobb's demons, a glimpse into a childhood that left him marked for a lifetime, that both drove him to greatness on the ball field while at the same time prevented him from achieving intimacy with anyone - wife, lover, team mate: ""But a man must defend his mother at all times, shouldn't he, Al?""Cobb was a pathetic man, worse than a curmudgeon, unable to give up his past achievements on the field, a feared and hated competitor, unable, even in his 70s, to allow another man to best him, loathed even by his own children; yet thanks to Jones' portrayal, Stump's book and Ron Shelton's brilliant screenplay, we find that he is also pitiable.Robert Wuhl is cast as Al Stump and his performance is good, while Lolita Davidovich is the Reno cigarette girl to whom the impotent Cobb, on medication for high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer and half a dozen other ailments, gives $1,000 to tell everyone that she slept with ""the great Ty Cobb."" Roger Clemens, the real-life pitcher, makes a cameo appearance as an opposing pitcher in a flashback to a game played during Cobb's prime, and Ernie Harwell, Hall of Fame announcer for the Detroit Tigers, also makes a cameo appearance in a scene at a Hall of Fame banquet.If you're looking for a baseball movie, a how to steal second base or hit to the opposite field movie, look elsewhere, but for the human drama of a real life monster and a glimpse into the dark side of the human psyche, both the monster's as well as our own, Cobb is highly recommended.",5,A Tour de Force,1169337600,"01

374922,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6303443222,Jeffrey Leach,"[7, 13]","I don't know why, but I usually love watching films about sports. Give me ""Rudy,"" ""The Natural,"" ""Major League,"" ""The Longest Yard,"" or a host of other similarly themed movies any day. Oh, there are a few exceptions, such as John Goodman's pathetic ""The Babe,"" but I even like Penny Marshall's femfest ""A League of Their Own."" It's surprising that I enjoy watching these sorts of films; I don't play sports and, with the exception of seeing Nebraska's college football team routinely trounce all opponents (Yeah, it's been a tough few years, but we got rid of Frank Solich so watch out for the Huskers in the future), I never go to games or watch them on television. Perhaps I like films dealing with this topic because the pictures use sports as a metaphor for more important themes in life. ""Rudy,"" for example, served as an excellent lesson on the value of perseverance and hard work. This 1994 film, the wonderfully bombastic ""Cobb,"" gives us a different sort of message. The movie spends a lot of time showing that talent and character are often mutually exclusive terms. Should we idealize a man as unpleasant as Ty Cobb simply because he could hit a ball with a bat better than nearly everyone else? And since we often do turn monsters into icons, what does that tell us about our society and ourselves?""Cobb"" is a film version of a book written about the legendary ballplayer by a sportswriter named Al Stump. In the movie, Stump (Robert Wuhl) thinks he's on easy street when he learns that Ty Cobb (Tommy Lee Jones) has chosen him to pen his biography. Think about it! You're a sportswriter and the greatest athlete in the history of the game decides he wants you to stay with him for a period of several months so you can write his story. Think of all the secrets you'll learn, the great anecdotes about some of the legends of baseball, the intricacies of the game and how the greats played it. Unfortunately, Stump meets Cobb when the former player is an alcoholic, pill popping old crank nearing the end of his days. Al learns the hard way that working closely with Ty Cobb means routinely putting your life on the line. The sports legend likes to randomly fire his gun inside his house, and his driving skills leave a lot to be desired (especially on ice packed mountain roads). Stump quickly tires of Cobb's reckless disregard for life, the endless streams of profanity, the racism against blacks and other minorities, and the insults. The two men spend more time sparring with each other than working on the book, but when they do get around to writing there's a problem. Cobb wants the book to focus on his exploits as an athlete, and Stump wants to write about the man's personal life.Stump decides to write two books, the one Cobb wants and the one he wants. But finishing the books takes great persistence. The sportswriter soon becomes more of a confidante and health care worker to the aging legend than his biographer. Cobb's diabetes requires daily injections of insulin, which Stump soon administers. When the Baseball Hall of Fame plans to induct Cobb, the two must go through a whole series of tiresome preparations. And then there's the endless recollections of the player's early life, a life full of heartache and triumph that Stump desperately wants to put in the book but which Cobb rejects for fear of looking bad. To muddy the waters, Ty lies about his private life by changing stories on a routine basis so Stump never knows what is real and what is fantasy. For example, there's the mystery surrounding the ballplayer's parents. The former athlete tells the writer that his father died violently, but continually changes the specifics of the story. First, his father perished accidentally. Then we learn that he died as the result of finding his mother cheating with another man. Then there's a final story twist. What really happened and how did it affect Ty Cobb's early years? Stump must sift through what he learns to reach an approximation of the truth.""Cobb"" is a great movie filled with convincing performances, unpleasant situations, and even humor. A diehard sports fanatic might not like the picture since it focuses more on personality and not the game itself. We do see flashbacks to Ty Cobb bullying his way through a few games, but the movie uses these scenes as elaboration on the man's character and not as a way to show his talent. According to the film, this guy beat a crippled fan, assaulted his wife, bet on games, and possibly murdered a man in a back alley. Nice chap, huh? At the same time, the movie tries to show that even the worst characters possess endearing traits. For instance, we learn that Cobb financially supported at least one of his former teammates. Which one of these men is the real Ty Cobb? Both of them. Jones plays the character with a gusto that leaps off the screen, easily overshadowing Robert Wuhl's restrained portrayal of Al Stump. The sultry Lolita Davidovich shows up as a woman who falls into the wily clutches of an elderly Ty Cobb and thus exposes another facet of the man's complex personality.The DVD edition contains two commentary tracks, a trailer, a look at the real Al Stump, a few additional scenes, and a short bit with Roger Clemens. I must have seen ""Cobb"" a dozen times back in the mid 1990s when pay television aired the film around the clock. My recent viewing of the movie only served as a reminder of the film's greatness. Clocking in at over two hours, ""Cobb"" is wonderful cinematic exploration that asks several penetrating questions about the men who play professional sports and the society that idolizes them.",5,Wonderful,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,5620,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'usually', 'love', 'watching', 'films', 'sports', 'Give', 'Rudy', 'Natural', 'Major', 'League', 'Longest', 'Yard',

374923,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6303443222,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[5, 5]","This great movie chronicles the life of Ty Cobb, one of baseball's all-time greatest players and one of the original members of baseball's hall of fame.  Ty Cobb played baseball during the ""deadball era"", when the baseball wasn't wound as tight as it is today.  Home runs came at a premium back then, and one season, Cobb led the league in home runs with nine.  He has the highest lifetime batting average of any player to play the game at .367, and he hit over .400 three times.  He also stole 892 bases and scored over 2,000 runs in his career.  Babe Ruth may have been the greatest home run hitter of all-time, but Ty Cobb was the best all-around player.Tommy Lee Jones stars as Cobb.  The year is 1960, and he is now 72 years old and battling cancer.  He calls on Al Stump (Robert Wuhl) to write his autobiography.  Stump was recognized as one of the greatest sportswriters of his time, having published atricles in many national newspapers and magazines, but he jumped at the chance to write about the great Ty Cobb.  He accepts the job.Al drives to Nevada to meet Cobb at his hunting lodge.  Upon enetring, he hears gunfire from upstairs.  The houseman tells him its Cobb shooting off his pistol.  Unsure, Stump heads upstairs.  There' he meets Cobb for the first time.  Their initial meeting is shaky at best, but Al accepts Ty's offer of writing the autobiography.  This sets off a series of events that last well over a year.  During this time, Al becomes Ty's only true friend and nursemaid by administering Ty's numerous medicines to him.  They drink together, fight with each other, chase the same women, and shoot at each other, but something more important develops; a sense of trust and friendship.  Ty loses some of his toughness around Al, and Al learns to accept Ty for who he really is and not who Al wants him to be.During his writing, Al decides to write two different manuscripts; one strictly about Ty's baseball life which he allows Ty to see, and another about Ty's secret life, which he keeps hidden away in his suitcase.  As the film progresses, Ty becomes more and more impressed with Al's work, but he still doesn't know anything about the other manuscript, until one day, he discovers a piece of paper hanging from Al's suitcase.  It is then that he discovers the hidden manuscript.  Shortly thereafter, Ty checks himself into the hospital because his medical condition has gotten much worse.  He died on July 17, 1961 at the age of 73.  He will probably be remembered for sharpening his spikes before games, starting fights with opposing players, hating blacks, women, and Jews, and even going into the stands and fighting with a fan, but he should also be remembered as one of the greatest players to ever play the game of baseball.This is a teriffic baseball movie.  Tommy Lee Jones delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Ty Cobb, and Robert Wuhl is equally good as Al Stump.  Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens even has a cameo as an opposing pitcher.  He even knocks Cobb down in one scene.  The story is excellent.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  I'm a huge fan of baseball movies, and this film ranks with the greatest ever made.  I only wish that there would have been more game footage.

Because despite his greatness, Cobb was a very sick man.""Cobb"" is not about baseball, but a film about ""greatness"" and America's need for heroes. While anyone can be a drunken SOB, not everyone can hit .367 lifetime.Through an Oscar-caliber performance by Tommy Lee Jones, we see the tortured life of ""The Georgia Peach"" through the eyes of Al Stump, the sportswriter Ty Cobb hired to write his autobiography. The few scenes on the diamond include a cameo by Roger Clemens as he and Cobb trade insults while Cobb aloofly takes two strikes, then doubles, mowing down three infielders en route to the plate.Robert Wuhl plays the naive Stump who cannot believe he's being paid by the wealthy Cobb to elaborate on such topics as how to steal second base, when the despised Cobb's real story is much more fascinating. Did he sharpen his spikes before games? Did he beat a heckling cripple and kill another? Disruptive, bigoted and mean, Cobb alienated his family and teammates throughout his life, allegedly due to a tragedy he witnessed as a boy.As Stump drives Cobb from California to his native Georgia, he secretly compiles a second book about Cobb's ugly side and, has to wonder if he himself is emulating Cobb. When the dying Cobb finds Stump's scribbled notes, he realizes he's been betrayed. Still, the odd friendship between these two men continues with Cobb on his deathbed and Stump pondering which version of the biography to publish.",5,"Baseball's First ""Charlie Hustle""",1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,1547,"['Ty', 'Cobb', 'were', 'playing', 'today', 'would', 'receive', 'finest', 'counseling', 'support', 'team', 'could', 'provide', 'greatness', 'Cobb', 'was', 'very', 'sick', 'man', 'Cobb', 'not', 'baseball', 'film', 'greatness', 'America', 'need', 'heroes', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'drunken', 'SOB', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'hit', '.367', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'see', 'tortured', 'life', 'Georgia', 'Peach', 'eyes', 'Al', 'Stump', 'sportswriter', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'hired', 'write', 'autobiography', 'few', 'scenes', 'diamond', 'include', 'cameo', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'Cobb', 'trade', 'insults', 'Cobb', 'aloofly', 'two', 'strikes', 'then', 'mowing', 'down', 'three', 'infielders', 'en', 'route', 'plate.Robert', 'Wuhl', 'naive', 'Stump', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'being', 'paid', 'wealthy', 'Cobb', 'elaborate', 'such', 'topics', 'how', 'steal', 'second', 'base', 'when', 'despised', 'Cobb', 'real', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Did', 'sharpen', 'spikes', 'games', 'Did', 'beat', 'heckling', 'cripple', 'kill', 'Disruptive', 'bigoted', 'mean', 'Cobb', 'alienated', 'family', 'teammates', 'life', 'allegedly', 'due', 'tragedy', 'witnessed', 'boy.As', 'Stump', 'drives', 'Cobb', 'California', 'native', 'Georgia', 'secretly', 'second', 'book', 'Cobb', 'ugly', 'side', 'wonder', 'emulating', 'Cobb', 'When', 'dying', 'Cobb', 'Stump', 'scribbled', 'notes', 'been', 'betrayed', 'Still', 'odd', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'Cobb', 'deathbed', 'Stump', 'pondering', 'version', 'biography', 'publish']",Cobb VHS

I don't know but I'm sure he also had good points but not in this movie. Actually the allegations that Cobb was a racist were never proved from what I've read so this movie is pure propaganda. The reporter that made all the claims actually had his veracity questioned. Cobb was very violent and he had deep opinions but in fact many people had the same opinions but does not mean he was a racist.

374927,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,6303443222,Joker,"[1, 2]","Cobb (1994) is a fascinating look at Ty Cobb's life after baseball.  Sportswriter Al Stump acted as a ghostwriter for an autobiography of Ty Cobb back in 1960-1961.  Cobb felt he was misunderstood as a person and a player, so his goal was to set the record straight.  This movie provides an in-depth look at Ty Cobb the man in his final days.  The accuracy of the information gathered by Stump on Cobb is open to speculation, but this movie is entertaining, and that's the bottom line.  This movie stars Tommy Lee Jones as The Georgia Peach and Robert Wuhl as Al Stump.Tommy Lee Jones looks NOTHING like Ty Cobb, but then what actor does?  His performance is good and above all, entertaining.  He was good at playing a drunken, pill-popping, sick, foul-mouthed, gun-toting, racist Cobb.  Be warned, this movie has very little to do with Ty Cobb's baseball career.  You won't see very much of his playing days.  Instead, it concentrates on the period of 1960-1961, just before Cobb died.  Cobb talks about his life and career and gives Stump a huge sampling of his personality.Robert Wuhl is pretty good in the role of Al Stump.  Also making appearances are Crash Davis, Roger Clemens, Ernie Harwell, and Jimmy Buffett.If you're a fan of The Georgia Peach, I think you'll find this movie interesting, even with it not having much to do with Cobb's playing and managing career.  Cobb is a controversial and fascinating baseball figure, and this movie is fascinating as well.

This man was Ty Cobb, one of the most spectacular athletes in the sport of baseball.  Hailed as one of the greatest of all time, Cobb's ability to steal bases was just as good as his inability to be a gentleman.  Cobb's personality flaws were well known and brought out well in this film by the actor Tommy Lee Jones.  The film swirls around a man interviewing Cobb for a spell in which there would be no tomorrow.  Cobb is a man who is dying of cancer and is just as ornery and blunt in nature as he was during his playing days.  Jones is great as Cobb, and the direction of this film is haunting, with some very, very poignant if not extremely sad moments that are shown.  A woman looking through a window at a man she knows is her father, but does not speak to is one of them.  The look on Cobb's face as the car drives off for this scene is one of those sad ones.  The sometimes hateful, irritable disposition is replaced by a look of somber sorrow as he realizes some of the most important things in his life are gone.The prophetic statements about the stock market were interesting, as Cobb was an avid investor up to the end.  ""They are going to start putting coca cola in these cans made out of aluminum"" he says.  Remember, the 60s had just started so even at that time for Cobb to have the open mind to accept a progressive future in technology was incredible, considering the film shows his final years spent in a large, dark house out in the middle of nowhere.

COBB is just that.Baseball great Tyrus Raymond Cobb, by his own admission, was a prick his entire life. Ron Shelton, in his written and directed biopic of the ""Georgia Peach"" does nothing to dispel this claim. Tommy Lee Jones attacks this role with such ferociousness that I doubt that anyone could like this character. Cobb was arguably the best ball player of his time. He was generally hated by all that came in contact with him. Jones plays him to a tee. Cobb is totally repelling and there is not but possibly a half ounce of sympathy for him in this film. This is the film's biggest problem: who can sit and watch total narcissistic behavior for 129 minutes??? Even amidst his totally insane and irrational behavior, there are some brilliant comic moments, but not enough to lift this film from the relentless heavy-handedness. After a while you have simply seen enough and want to walk out, never to return. There is nothing that made me respect or care for Ty Cobb in the slightest. Cobb was a bully, a manipulator, a cheat, a liar, a carouser, a drunk, a wife-beater who was forsaken by his five children and more. No excuse can be given for this kind of behavior no matter how ""great"" the man.This film did strike a very personal chord in me. My own father was a ""Ty Cobb."" My father did all and was even more than Cobb was. He, like Cobb, died alone,rejected by his family and friends in his old age. After 84 years, only six people attended his funeral, and only out of some weird obligatory feeling. So, in brief, COBB reflected much of what I knew to be true in my own experience from my life. NOT A PLEASANT WATCH FOR SOME!Elliot Goldenthal's original soundtrack is appropriately riveting and truly is an asset in the fast moving scenes!Is COBB a well done film?

Let me start by saying, Mr. Jones is a Wonderful actor and no surprise, he is Magnificent! But, surprisingly' you also get a good performance from Robert Wuhl, and Ron Shelton, may have done his finest directing(which doesn't say too much). I found it to be sort of like Citizen Kane, this Great dying figure, having his very private story be pried from him. There is some very strong language, and some uncomfortable moments that seem unnecessary,. Also some ""drama"" that really weighs down the ending.Now, for the people who hate this movie for it's ""inaccuracies"", remember they are adapting a book, not making a biography. So if it is in the book, it should be on the screen. It is VERY unfortunate that they chose a book written by an opportunistic fame hungry hack, but HELLO it's a Sports ""writer"", and that is the bottom of the barrel, media wise.  I would love to see a more accurate picture about Cobb, because he was so Great.  However, that is the reason I won't give this film a negative review, because when I saw it, It I thought, Jones was Great, Cobb was Great, as for Wuhl/Stump, I thought he came off as a self righteous Schmuck, and I thought, good for Shelton, making a grown up picture, too bad he didn't get a better writer.So in closing, a film can be enjoyable even when they distort the truth a LOT, Braveheart, Catch Me if You Can, Men of Honor,  Murder in the 1st, no wait that movie sucked!

374935,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303443222,Linda Linguvic,"[31, 40]","Ty Cobb was called &quot;the greatest baseball player of all time&quot; and he enjoyed the spotlight.  He was also known as &quot;difficult person&quot; to put it mildly.  He drank hard, was prone to violence, insulted everybody, beat his wife, alienated his children, was a racist, beat a man to death and was accused of fixing games. In 1960 he had his biography written by a sportswriter named Al Stump.  At the time Al Stump wrote a flattering portrait.  Later, Stump wrote another book, telling the &quot;real&quot; story about Cobb.  And this 1994 film is based on this second book.The film is set in 1960 when Cobb, then 72 years old, engages Al Stump to write his biography.  Stump's a young sportswriter who's flattered by the assignment.  At first he hates the arrogant Cobb, but later finds himself admiring him for his &quot;bigger than life&quot; personality.  And so he winds up being Cobb's only friend, traveling with him, drinking with him and playing nursemaid to his wild rages and need for constant medication.Tommy Lee Jones is cast as Cobb, in a larger-than-life performance that humanizes the aging Cobb in spite of his raging racism and generally obnoxious behavior.  Robert Wuhl is cast as Al Stump and his performance is equally good as we see him starting to have sympathy for the aging man.  Lolita Davidovich is cast as a Reno cigarette girl who is pursued by both Al Stump and Cobb.  She gives a good performance but I think the main reason she's in the film is to liven it up with a bit of flesh.  There's also a small role played by Roger Clemens, the real-life pitcher in a scene of a baseball game played around 1916. Wisely, the camera doesn't stay too long on Tommy Lee Jones for this scene because he just can't look like a very young man.The screenplay was ambitious but it lacked something.  It was overlong and tended to be boring.  Once the general situation was set, there was just one kind of outrageous behavior after another to prove the point that Cobb was difficult and that Stump was starting to admire the old man.  In my opinion, the whole film could have been condensed to a one-hour television movie.  As I'm interested in baseball, I did enjoy the film.

The source for the material, Al Stump, has become known in recent years as a notorious producer of false Cobb sports items. He forged signitures, he forged entire  documents, he forged a diary that was brought into the baseball hall of fame, he forged multiple copies of the same documents, he even sold what he claimed was the ""shotgun"" that killed Cobb's father. The whole sorded tale of this person was documented in ""The National Pastime"", official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research in 2010. Nearly ever story Stump told that formed the basis for this film has been contradicted by other people around him. That includes the doctors and nurses who cared for him at the end of his life.The accusations about Cobb being a murderer presented in the film are absolutely false. The accusations made against Cobb related to gambling on baseball in the 1920s were ultimately rejected, not because of secret scandals, but because the source of the accusations, Dutch Leonard, hated Cobb and had been feuding with him for years. And while Leonard was willing to kick dirt in the newspapers, he wasn't willing to say anything under oath when the time came. The way the film makers use that particular incident can't be blamed on Stump. With even a little bit of research, they could have discovered the truth.The stories of Cobb shooting guns wildly in the air in hospitals were rejected by the doctors and nurses who treated him. The story of Al Stump tending to the medical needs of Cobb are rejected by the medical student Cobb had working for him in that capacity in the year Stump knew him.And the story of Cobb's father's death in the film can't be trusted. Stump produced a variety of lured versions of that story from the early 1960s onward. He even tried to sell what he alleged to be the gun used in the shooting. But he didn't even bother to get the type of gun used in the shooting correct.The shame of the movie is that Tommy Lee Jones puts in a good performance and its generally a well made film. But whatever the good qualties of the film, its ultimately a giant slander on a real person. The baseball scene withRoger Clemens is probably the most fun bit in the film but it doesn't last long.The shame is that the real Ty Cobb, his many faults and all, has probably been hidden from history forever now by the legends that Al Stump created.",1,A completely false story,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2443,"['None', 'what', 'presented', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'source', 'material', 'Al', 'Stump', 'become', 'known', 'recent', 'years', 'notorious', 'producer', 'false', 'Cobb', 'sports', 'items', 'forged', 'signitures', 'forged', 'entire', 'documents', 'forged', 'diary', 'was', 'brought', 'baseball', 'hall', 'fame', 'forged', 'multiple', 'copies', 'same', 'documents', 'even', 'sold', 'what', 'claimed', 'was', 'shotgun', 'killed', 'Cobb', 'father', 'whole', 'sorded', 'tale', 'person', 'was', 'documented', 'National', 'Pastime', 'official', 'publication', 'Society', 'American', 'Baseball', 'Research', '2010', 'Nearly', 'ever', 'story', 'Stump', 'told', 'formed', 'basis', 'film', 'been', 'contradicted', 'other', 'people', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'who', 'cared', 'end', 'life.The', 'accusations', 'Cobb', 'being', 'murderer', 'presented', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'false', 'accusations', 'made', 'Cobb', 'related', 'gambling', 'baseball', '1920s', 'were', 'ultimately', 'rejected', 'not', 'secret', 'scandals', 'source', 'accusations', 'Dutch', 'Leonard', 'hated', 'Cobb', 'had', 'been', 'feuding', 'years', 'Leonard', 'was', 'willing', 'kick', 'dirt', 'newspapers', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'say', 'anything', 'oath', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'way', 'film', 'makers', 'use', 'particular', 'incident', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'blamed', 'Stump', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'research', 'could', 'have', 'discovered', 'truth.The', 'stories', 'Cobb', 'shooting', 'guns', 'wildly', 'air', 'hospitals', 'were', 'rejected', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'who', 'treated', 'story', 'Al', 'Stump', 'tending', 'medical', 'needs', 'Cobb', 'are', 'rejected', 'medical', 'student', 'Cobb', 'had', 'working', 'capacity', 'year', 'Stump', 'knew', 'story', 'Cobb', 'father', 'death', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'Stump', 'produced', 'variety', 'lured', 'versions', 'story', 'early', '1960s', 'onward', 'even', 'tried', 'sell', 'what', 'alleged', 'be', 'gun', 'used', 'shooting', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'get', 'type', 'gun', 'used', 'shooting', 'correct.The', 'shame', 'movie', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'good', 'performance', 'generally', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'good', 'qualties', 'film', 'ultimately', 'giant', 'slander', 'real', 'person', 'baseball', 'scene', 'withRoger', 'Clemens', 'probably', 'most', 'fun', 'bit', 'film', ""n't"", 'last', 'long.The', 'shame', 'real', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'many', 'faults', 'probably', 'been', 'hidden', 'history', 'forever', 'now', 'legends', 'Al', 'Stump', 'created']",Cobb VHS

So with that statement, there should be many sports fans and historains who would want to check this movie/DVD out (though it's a little light on actual baseball *playing* - too bad, because the photography/camera work is terrific).Tommy Lee Jones plays the part as if he's auditioning for the part of Mephistofolies; or Sweeney Todd; it's surely ""over the top"" but he dominates every single scene he's in, actually over-running (with no sharpened spikes) Mr. Rhul, playing the (now) legendary sports writer Al Stump. In ""real life"", it seems Stump had to deal with a relatively tame but decidedly moody lion, in motel rooms, in banquet halls, in lounges, all over the place.The movie portrays a somewhat self-righteous writing genuis, as it constantly refers to his own personal troubles - the more he yells at his employer, who ultimately he does befriend, albeit cautiously, the more the very perceptive, though dying 72 year old man, reminds him of his own mess as a  filanderer and failed husband. There's a rather unconvincing scene towards the end of the picture, when at some motel Stump is presented with Divorce papers and he begins to fire Cobb's gun in the direction of this guy who's been chasing him around the country for this purpose. The script is very strong throughout but here the scene ends on a depressing note. What was needed was for Cobb to simply convey through his eyes ""Wanna throw any more ""stones"" at *me*, son?"" Well, maybe that's a bit trite, but the scene closes as Lee says that he saw nothing - just a coupla bad boys.Lolita Davidovitch has some good scenes, but her 1960 Vegas Cocktail Waitress has the look but not the ""feel"", meaning Shelton probably had to make her a milennium feminist to fit the quasi-political contemporary movie industry demands. Keeping the character more to the period would have worked.Another concession to the male-female spirit of today, not 1960, is in a deleted scene: Stump watches, through his office window, and in the company of his Secretary, a shapely lady ascend a staircase. In the midst of his confusion and disorientation, he tells his exasperated co-worker to tell his wife, who has just called, well, tell her something. I wonder what the ""real"" Al Stump thought of that kind of stuff.Tyrus Raymond Cobb surely fought death...and life. In his profession, he reached high, refusing to be taken lightly or be beaten. As his violent world finally came crashing in, and his health was in free-fall, he still refused to acknowledge his vulnerability, his mortality. Maybe that's the only real lesson to be learned by all of this: even a wicked man can sustain by calling up his reserve of strength and courage; maybe even artfulness.Mr. Shelton delivers a very interesting narrative of the back story,  though he sounds very subdued - perhaps the memory that the kind of numbers the Georgia Peach drew out to the old ball park did not exactly compare to this movie about his last days.",4,For BB fans a strong 4; casual sports fans a 3.,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3158,"['people', 'consider', 'Cobb', 'greatest', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'name', 'higher', 'Mr.', 'Ruth', 'book', 'list', 'exception', 'one', 'book', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'top', 'So', 'statement', 'should', 'be', 'many', 'sports', 'fans', 'historains', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'check', 'movie/DVD', 'out', 'little', 'light', 'actual', 'baseball', '*playing*', 'too', 'bad', 'photography/camera', 'work', 'terrific', '.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'part', 'auditioning', 'part', 'Mephistofolies', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'surely', 'top', 'single', 'scene', 'actually', 'over-running', 'sharpened', 'spikes', 'Mr.', 'Rhul', 'playing', 'now', 'legendary', 'sports', 'writer', 'Al', 'Stump', 'real', 'life', 'Stump', 'had', 'deal', 'relatively', 'tame', 'decidedly', 'moody', 'lion', 'motel', 'rooms', 'banquet', 'halls', 'lounges', 'place.The', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'self-righteous', 'writing', 'genuis', 'refers', 'own', 'personal', 'troubles', 'more', 'employer', 'who', 'ultimately', 'befriend', 'cautiously', 'more', 'very', 'perceptive', 'dying', '72', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'own', 'mess', 'filanderer', 'failed', 'husband', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'scene', 'end', 'picture', 'when', 'motel', 'Stump', 'presented', 'Divorce', 'papers', 'fire', 'Cobb', 'gun', 'direction', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'chasing', 'country', 'purpose', 'script', 'very', 'strong', 'here', 'scene', 'depressing', 'note', 'What', 'was', 'needed', 'was', 'Cobb', 'simply', 'convey', 'eyes', 'Wan', 'throw', 'more', 'stones', '*me*', 'son', 'Well', 'maybe', 'bit', 'trite', 'scene', 'Lee', 'saw', 'nothing', 'just', 'coupla', 'bad', 'boys.Lolita', 'Davidovitch', 'good', 'scenes', '1960', 'Vegas', 'Cocktail', 'Waitress', 'look', 'not', 'feel', 'meaning', 'Shelton', 'probably', 'had', 'make', 'milennium', 'feminist', 'fit', 'quasi-political', 'contemporary', 'movie', 'industry', 'demands', 'Keeping', 'character', 'more', 'period', 'would', 'have', 'worked.Another', 'concession', 'male-female', 'spirit', 'today', 'not', '1960', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Stump', 'watches', 'office', 'window', 'company', 'Secretary', 'shapely', 'lady', 'ascend', 'staircase', 'midst', 'confusion', 'disorientation', 'exasperated', 'co-worker', 'tell', 'wife', 'who', 'just', 'called', 'well', 'tell', 'something', 'wonder', 'what', 'real', 'Al', 'Stump', 'thought', 'kind', 'stuff.Tyrus', 'Raymond', 'Cobb', 'surely', 'fought', 'death', 'life', 'profession', 'reached', 'high', 'refusing', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'be', 'beaten', 'violent', 'world', 'finally', 'came', 'crashing', 'health', 'was', 'free-fall', 'still', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'vulnerability', 'mortality', 'only', 'real', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'even', 'wicked', 'man', 'can', 'sustain', 'calling', 'up', 'reserve', 'strength', 'courage', 'maybe', 'even', 'artfulness.Mr', 'Shelton', 'very', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'back', 'story', 'very', 'subdued', 'perhaps', 'memory', 'kind', 'numbers', 'Georgia', 'Peach', 'drew', 'out', 'old', 'ball', 'park', 'did', 'not', 'exactly', 'compare', 'movie', 'last', 'days']",Cobb VHS

Yes, the acting is perhaps a bit over the top at times, but somehow those excesses fit well into the overarching story. Cobb was, after all, larger than life, even in his later years. The film is quite faithful to Al Stump's biography (""Cobb""), even to the point of Stump's presence throughout the production as a character who receives at least as much screen time as Cobb himself. Few biographies, to my knowledge, place the author in such close proximity to the subject. Baseball action is nicely portrayed, mixing old footage with black-and-white recreations and often (Zelig- or Gump-like) placing Tommy Lee Jones among actual ballplayers and managers of the past. Watch for Roger Clemens as an opposing pitcher. It should be said that both the movie and the book concentrate much more heavily on the present day than Cobb's career with the Detroit Tigers.

Obviously he was a shrewd business man with his investments, but if the story is to believed, he was also generous with his money to help some that were less fortunate. Unfortunately, he never did have a good relationship with his children, which is sad but understandable to some degree since he didn't have a good relationship with his own parents.

374952,ABLBRUT8DALNN,6303443222,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Ty Cobb is in the top five of the greatest players in Baseball history. In fact, he was the first man elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, but there has never been a film about his life. While Cobb was a great baseball player and one the toughest men to ever live, he was also an outspoken racist, who was quick to fight anyone, including his wife and kids. In 1960, a dying Cobb contacted sportswriter, Al Stump to ask him to tell his story. That is what I thought this critically acclaimed film would be, but it wasn't. While the title is Cobb, the film is really about Al Stump and what it was like to spend time with the great Ty Cobb, after he'd completely lost his faculties. While it wasn't the film I'd hoped it would be, Tommy Lee Jones gave the performance of a lifetime. What can you say about Jones that hasn't already been said? He is the best actor in Hollywood and can play absolutely anyone. Jones was very convincing, showing Cobb as a deeply troubled man who covered his shame with outrageous behavior. In recent years, since the passing of Al Stump, many people who knew Cobb have come out saying the book and film were overly exaggerated, but even so, the facts about Cobb are well documented. Cobb is not the film most people expected it to be and it ranks among the biggest flops in box office history. The story however is one you haven't heard before and is performed admirably by an all-star cast. This is not your typical baseball movie, but rather a moving look at a man who was destine to either be a legend or an inmate.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1550,"['Ty', 'Cobb', 'top', 'five', 'greatest', 'players', 'Baseball', 'history', 'fact', 'was', 'first', 'man', 'elected', 'Baseball', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'there', 'never', 'been', 'film', 'life', 'Cobb', 'was', 'great', 'baseball', 'player', 'one', 'toughest', 'men', 'ever', 'live', 'was', 'also', 'outspoken', 'racist', 'who', 'was', 'quick', 'fight', 'anyone', 'including', 'wife', 'kids', '1960', 'dying', 'Cobb', 'contacted', 'sportswriter', 'Al', 'Stump', 'ask', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'thought', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'title', 'Cobb', 'film', 'really', 'Al', 'Stump', 'what', 'was', 'spend', 'time', 'great', 'Ty', 'Cobb', ""'d"", 'completely', 'lost', 'faculties', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'gave', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'best', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'play', 'absolutely', 'anyone', 'Jones', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'showing', 'Cobb', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'man', 'who', 'covered', 'shame', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'recent', 'years', 'passing', 'Al', 'Stump', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Cobb', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'saying', 'book', 'film', 'were', 'overly', 'exaggerated', 'even', 'so', 'facts', 'Cobb', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'Cobb', 'not', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'expected', 'be', 'biggest', 'flops', 'box', 'office', 'history', 'story', 'however', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'performed', 'admirably', 'all-star', 'cast', 'not', 'typical', 'baseball', 'movie', 'rather', 'moving', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'destine', 'either', 'be', 'legend', 'inmate']",Cobb VHS
374953,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,6303443222,Utah Blaine,"[6, 6]","Ty Cobb was certainly one of the greatest ballplayers to ever put on cleats, but this film does not him justice.  As a historical biopic it falls far short.  Cobb comes across without a shred of humanity and is dislikeable from his first appearance.  This really isn't a baseball story per se, it's more of a character study with a baseball backdrop.  The story starts near the end of Cobb's life as reporter Al Stump is summoned to Cobb's Tahoe hunting lodge to write the life story of the great ball player (all of which is based on a true story and you can find Stump's books on  Amazon).  The vast majority of the movie is spent on the interplay between Stump and Cobb as Stump (and the audience) discover what kind of man Cobb really is (and it ain't pretty).  Throughout the film we get a few vignettes of Cobb's life, his career in baseball, his early upbringing, the accidental (?) slaying of his father by his mother, but we basically learn that Cobb was a drunken, racist pig.  Stump is torn as to whether to write the hero-worship story that Cobb wants, or whether to write the true-to-life story that presents Cobb to the public as he really is, warts and all.There is a lot to like about this film.  The performances of both Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Wuhl (who is the main character in the tale in spite of the title and billing) are outstanding.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is probably one of Tommy Lee Jones' best performances in his long and varied career.  He convincingly makes Cobb dislikable from the get go.  Roger Clemens makes a guest appearance as well.  In this film, Cobb represents everything that is wrong with professional athletes.  The arrogance, the sense of self-indulgence and self-aggrandizement.  They are only baseball players, and batting titles in the grand scheme of things aren't that important.  Cobb may be rich and famous, but I wouldn't want to have lived his life.  If even half this film is true, he must have been a pretty sorry man.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge baseball fan, but some (many) pro athletes lose perspective, and the man presented in Cobb took this to the extreme.The faults of this film are many, however.  The story bounces along as Cobb commits one outrageous, druken, racist act after another, becoming more despicable to the audience.  In fact, the story is essentially the same series of scenes repeated throughout the film.  Stump/Wuhl is torn about the story he wants to write, Cobb commits another self-indulgent, offfensive act, Stump and Wuhl argue about it, then patch things up and it happens again.  The film really drags at times.  Additionally, for a film purportedly about one of the early stars of baseball, you'll learn almost nothing about Cobb as a player, and even less about the dead-ball era in baseball more generally.  This film is largely a character study, and I would have liked to know more about Cobb's baseball days.  Don't be misled thinking that this film is largely about Cobb's playing days, because it isn't.  This is a decent film that even a non-baseball fan can enjoy as a rental.  No need to add this to your collection though, even a hardcore baseball aficiando isn't likely to be watching this over and over.",3,Dark and unsympathetic biopic of baseball great Ty Cobb,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,3234,"['Ty', 'Cobb', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'greatest', 'ballplayers', 'ever', 'put', 'cleats', 'film', 'not', 'justice', 'historical', 'biopic', 'far', 'short', 'Cobb', 'shred', 'humanity', 'dislikeable', 'first', 'appearance', 'really', ""n't"", 'baseball', 'story', 'se', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'baseball', 'backdrop', 'story', 'end', 'Cobb', 'life', 'reporter', 'Al', 'Stump', 'summoned', 'Cobb', 'Tahoe', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'write', 'life', 'story', 'great', 'ball', 'player', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'find', 'Stump', 'books', 'Amazon', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'spent', 'interplay', 'Stump', 'Cobb', 'Stump', 'audience', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'Cobb', 'really', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'film', 'get', 'few', 'vignettes', 'Cobb', 'life', 'career', 'baseball', 'early', 'upbringing', 'accidental', 'slaying', 'father', 'mother', 'basically', 'learn', 'Cobb', 'was', 'drunken', 'racist', 'pig', 'Stump', 'torn', 'write', 'hero-worship', 'story', 'Cobb', 'write', 'true-to-life', 'story', 'Cobb', 'public', 'really', 'warts', 'all.There', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'performances', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Robert', 'Wuhl', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'tale', 'spite', 'title', 'billing', 'are', 'outstanding', 'fact', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'probably', 'one', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'best', 'performances', 'long', 'varied', 'career', 'convincingly', 'Cobb', 'dislikable', 'get', 'go', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'guest', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Cobb', 'everything', 'wrong', 'professional', 'athletes', 'arrogance', 'sense', 'self-indulgence', 'self-aggrandizement', 'are', 'only', 'baseball', 'players', 'batting', 'titles', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'Cobb', 'may', 'be', 'rich', 'famous', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'lived', 'life', 'even', 'film', 'true', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'sorry', 'man', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'huge', 'baseball', 'fan', 'many', 'pro', 'athletes', 'lose', 'perspective', 'man', 'presented', 'Cobb', 'took', 'extreme.The', 'faults', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'however', 'story', 'bounces', 'along', 'Cobb', 'one', 'outrageous', 'druken', 'racist', 'act', 'becoming', 'more', 'despicable', 'audience', 'fact', 'story', 'essentially', 'same', 'series', 'scenes', 'repeated', 'film', 'Stump/Wuhl', 'torn', 'story', 'write', 'Cobb', 'self-indulgent', 'offfensive', 'act', 'Stump', 'Wuhl', 'argue', 'then', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'again', 'film', 'really', 'times', 'Additionally', 'film', 'purportedly', 'one', 'early', 'stars', 'baseball', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'almost', 'nothing', 'about', 'Cobb', 'player', 'even', 'less', 'dead-ball', 'era', 'baseball', 'more', 'generally', 'film', 'largely', 'character', 'study', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'Cobb', 'baseball', 'days', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'thinking', 'film', 'largely', 'Cobb', 'playing', 'days', ""n't"", 'decent', 'film', 'even', 'non-baseball', 'fan', 'can', 'enjoy', 'rental', 'No', 'need', 'add', 'collection', 'even', 'hardcore', 'baseball', 'aficiando', ""n't"", 'likely', 'be', 'watching', 'over', 'over']",Cobb VHS

Cobb pulls it off, wins his $100, and starts an on-field brawl in the process.

Stump soon finds out all that he needs to know about Cobb.

Suffice it to say, though, that none of his roles are demonstrably better than his turn as Ty Cobb here.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Cobb&#34; tells the story of famous old-time ballplayer Ty Cobb (Jones), who hires sportswriter Al Stump (Robert Wuhl) to write his biography in his advanced age.  While trying to wade through the legends and get to the facts about Cobb's life both in and out of baseball, Stump begins to discover just how crazy of a character Cobb was (and even is in his final years!).What makes this movie such a classic for me is that though clearly made for a baseball-themed audience (if you don't like baseball, you probably won't care a ton about Cobb), the movie contains relatively few scenes of actual baseball action.  It does enough to establish what Cobb was like on the field, but other than that it is much more of an &#34;off the field&#34; biography story.That is where Tommy Lee Jones comes in.  Without his energy, this could have been a very depressing, lifeless sort of movie.  However, I don't think I've ever seen Jones throw himself into a role quite like Ty Cobb.  Who knows what Cobb was really like (besides Al Stump himself) in those final years/interviews, but Jones does his best based on what was known to capture the fiery essence of perhaps the greatest player to ever step on a baseball diamond.If you have no interest in the national pastime, &#34;Cobb&#34; might not be for you, as it is filled with many baseball themes that are integral to understanding the whole story.  If you are a baseball fan who hasn't stumbled across this somewhat-rare gem, though, boy are you ever in for a treat!

It is, after all, a game, folks.The movie, in general, is well done. No technical complaints, no complaints on any performance by any actor, no complaints about how the life of this man Cobb was portrayed - may the truth be told. ""Prince among men,"" says Cobb of himself. ""A great who is misunderstood."" Hardly. I have rarely seen a portrayal of a man with so little to redeem him. His only excuse, achingly lame, is that there was an ugly scene in his childhood, adulterous parents gone mad with rage. Okay. Anyone out there without a dysfunction in your childhood, raise your hand! Thought so. Albeit, Cobb's childhood contains some doozies, but as he himself admits: ""I was a prick even before my father was murdered."" He begs the nature versus nurture debate, but personally, I don't care. Anyone who so defies any accountability for himself throughout his 72 years, eschews all responsibility, gains no compassion from me. He beat his many wives, attempted rape, regularly frequented prostitutes, abused his children, was racist to the bone, purposefully aimed to injure other athletes on the field, exhibited only brutality and rudeness to others, and topped it all off with an incredible arrogance. At least justice reigns: Cobb has not a single friend in the world, knows only hatred, and must deal with his own demons to the very end.And he is in the baseball Hall of Fame? Why? I struggle to respect the game if it honors such as Cobb, regardless of his stats.Yes, that's right, that's five stars I gave this movie.
