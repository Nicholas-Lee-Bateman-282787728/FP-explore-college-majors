Using his pension, she set up a community center in his name. They feed the homeless and offer after school activities for children. While Mom is serving the homeless, her own son, now 10, spends many of his after school hours with the kind man in the apartment across the hall--the closest thing to a father he has ever known. Her son decides she needs a husband and he enters the ""All I Want For Christmas"" contest sponsored by a toy company trying to boost sales. His entry is a sincere plea for a husband for his mom. He wins, of course, and his mom is none too thrilled, but decides to go along with it when she convinces the toy company that she will do it on the condition that they donate the 1/2 million dollars she needs to buy the building her community center is in before it is sold out from under them. As the story unfolds several people experience the ""maybe-what-I-wanted-isn't-really-what-I-want"" feeling .Parents may want to know that there are a couple of incidents of profanity and one common swear word. The neighbor's girlfriend does make one comment that could be taken as slightly suggestive. The son is disrespectful in his attitude toward his mother's boyfriend on more than one occasion. Those are the only things I can think of that may bother anyone.I may have given this 3 1/2 stars if that was an option because it is quite predictable. It has the common ""single parent dating the wrong person"" theme of so many Christmas movies, but the lead characters are people you can care about and it is nice to see a story about good people who aren't concerned with success as the world defines it, but want to make a difference in the lives of those who need help.",4,Not a bad way to pass a snowy evening.,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,1797,"['Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'woman', 'husband', 'was', 'policeman', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'two', 'Using', 'pension', 'set', 'up', 'community', 'center', 'name', 'feed', 'homeless', 'offer', 'school', 'activities', 'children', 'Mom', 'serving', 'homeless', 'own', 'son', 'now', '10', 'many', 'school', 'hours', 'kind', 'man', 'apartment', 'hall', 'closest', 'thing', 'father', 'ever', 'known', 'son', 'husband', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'contest', 'sponsored', 'toy', 'company', 'trying', 'boost', 'sales', 'entry', 'sincere', 'plea', 'husband', 'mom', 'course', 'mom', 'none', 'too', 'thrilled', 'go', 'along', 'when', 'toy', 'company', 'will', 'do', 'condition', 'donate', '1/2', 'million', 'dollars', 'buy', 'building', 'community', 'center', 'sold', 'out', 'story', 'unfolds', 'several', 'people', 'experience', ""maybe-what-I-wanted-isn't-really-what-I-want"", 'feeling', '.Parents', 'may', 'want', 'know', 'are', 'couple', 'incidents', 'profanity', 'one', 'common', 'swear', 'word', 'neighbor', 'girlfriend', 'make', 'one', 'comment', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'slightly', 'suggestive', 'son', 'disrespectful', 'attitude', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'are', 'only', 'things', 'can', 'think', 'may', 'bother', 'anyone.I', 'may', 'have', 'given', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'option', 'quite', 'predictable', 'common', 'single', 'parent', 'dating', 'wrong', 'person', 'theme', 'so', 'many', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'care', 'nice', 'see', 'story', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'success', 'world', 'want', 'make', 'difference', 'lives', 'who', 'need', 'help']",All I Want for Christmas
