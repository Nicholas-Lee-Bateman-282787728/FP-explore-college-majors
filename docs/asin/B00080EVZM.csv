You hear some of the same stuff you hear in other stand up's but nobody can compare to his unique delivery. Bruce also speaks on some subjects dealing with his family and this is stuff that the old school can really relate to but the younger crowd can't do anything but crack up at it. The jokes he told I couldn't really tell on Amazon.com but trust me you haven't heard this before. If you want to see some original stand up comedy then get this. What he does on comic view doesn't even compare to what's on this DVD. Maybe this will help, Bruce's platinum series is almost as good as Chappelles platinum Killin Them Softly.",5,He's funny on comic view but he's hilarious in stand up,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,689,"['Bruce', 'Bruce', 'went', 'work', 'when', 'was', 'working', 'stand', 'up', 'hear', 'same', 'stuff', 'hear', 'other', 'stand', 'up', 'nobody', 'can', 'compare', 'unique', 'delivery', 'Bruce', 'also', 'subjects', 'dealing', 'family', 'stuff', 'old', 'school', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'younger', 'crowd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'crack', 'up', 'jokes', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'Amazon.com', 'trust', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'before', 'want', 'see', 'original', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'then', 'get', 'What', 'comic', 'view', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'what', 'DVD', 'Maybe', 'will', 'help', 'Bruce', 'platinum', 'series', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Chappelles', 'platinum', 'Killin', 'Them', 'Softly']",N/A
