I don't hate it it's just not my taste. I like one or two songs here and there. A friend of mine bought one of his CD for me (Modern day drifter). She knew that I thought he was the cutest. I started listening to it in my car. After couple times I started to get into it and I eventually ended up liking it alot. I went out and bought his first CD and ended falling in love with couple songs on that CD. When his third CD came out I bought it right away without hesitation. I was really surprised that he's  just getting better on every CD that he puts out. It's even better than Modern day drifter CD.When I found out that he will have his DVD out I put in preorder right away. Now I fell in love with him even more. In special behind the scenes on the DVD was very good. We get to see the real him. He seems so normal, not acting like he was a big superstar and that's made him more unique than everybody else. He looks like someone who live next door to you that just love to sing and make good music.If you don't have his third CD. Get it. You'll love it.",5,Looks can sell.,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,1170,"['OK', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'was', 'got', 'music.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'country', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'just', 'not', 'taste', 'like', 'one', 'two', 'songs', 'here', 'there', 'friend', 'mine', 'bought', 'one', 'CD', 'Modern', 'day', 'drifter', 'knew', 'thought', 'was', 'cutest', 'started', 'listening', 'car', 'couple', 'times', 'started', 'get', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'alot', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'first', 'CD', 'ended', 'falling', 'love', 'couple', 'songs', 'CD', 'When', 'third', 'CD', 'came', 'out', 'bought', 'right', 'away', 'hesitation', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'CD', 'out', 'even', 'better', 'Modern', 'day', 'drifter', 'CD.When', 'found', 'out', 'will', 'have', 'DVD', 'out', 'put', 'preorder', 'right', 'away', 'Now', 'fell', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'so', 'normal', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'big', 'superstar', 'made', 'more', 'unique', 'everybody', 'else', 'someone', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'just', 'love', 'sing', 'make', 'good', 'music.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'third', 'CD', 'Get', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A
