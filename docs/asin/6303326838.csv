369341,ASAJYJAHUJO54,6303326838,Adel Andersen,"[0, 0]","Karol ( Zbigniew Zamachowski ) is disposed by his wife, Dominique ( Julie Delpy ) and forced to go back to his home country, Poland. Then, he thinks of and begins to plan the revenge to her, supported by his friend, Mikolaj ( Janusz Gajos ). When he becomes a successful businessman, it's the time to carry out his PLAN to acquire equality...White implies purity and innocence, but also means equality. This film tells how a man acquires the equality with his wife.Oscar nominee and the star of ""Before Sunset"", Julie Delpy portrays Dominique as icy beauty. Zamachowski plays a clueless man well. The story is depicted as somewhat comedic but serious touch. The friendship between Karol and Mikolaj is interesting. This movie received the winner of the best director award at the Berlin Film Festival.Director Kieslowski is prominent in the unique expression. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music. These effects give deep impression. For instance, some funny moments are depicted by serious touch in this film. Also, an old lady appears through the three colors trilogy. It is interesting that Julie( Blue ), Karol( White ), and Valentine( Red ) react differently toward the old lady.The three colors trilogy is the masterpiece of Kieslowski and consists of three films ("" Blue"", ""White"", and ""Red"" ) . The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity. Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies.

369342,A1DOUKV8D3TTD5,6303326838,A. R. Greenlee,"[2, 3]","The first flash of white in this movie is the runny droppings falling from a pigeon onto the overcoat of Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowiski) as he enters a Parisian courthouse.  The next time we distinctly see white, it is a porcelain toilet into which Karol is vomitting.  With these two scenes occuring so early, you know that white, in this film, represents not purity, but pure cra-.  However, if that is true of the color, it is definitely not true of the movie, which is pure gold.White, in the three-colored French flag, represents equality, and ""White"" is Kieslowski's second film in the ""Three Colors"" trilogy -- ""Blue"" (for liberty) being the first, and ""Red"" (for fraternity) being the third.  And it is our Polish protaginist  Karol Karol (a redundancy, a duplicate, even in name) who brings up the issue of equality as ""Julie"" from ""Blue"" appears briefly in the rear of the court where Karol's French wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) is divorcing him for his inability to consummate their marriage -- on the wedding night or since.Karol is a relatively short man with a boyishly charming face, which, alternately smiling and yearning, carries us through the movie.  Dominique (in French, ""dominer"" means ""dominate"") is blonde, taller than Karol, and says she no longer loves him, although, in a strange conversation with him about ""understanding,"" she says, ""You don't understand that I want you, that I need you . . .""  He implores her to come with him to Poland, but she refuses.The rest of the movie may be ""understood"" as his attempt to get her to come . . . to Poland.  I think this, rather than revenge, is his real motive. In the entire movie, the word ""revenge"" is used only once, and that is on the lips of Dominique in that conversation about ""understanding,"" where we all understand that he is not interested in revenge.  Instead, he tells a stranger that he still loves Dominique.When Karol returns to Warsaw, Poland (Kieslowski's birthplace),  his first view is of a city dump.  ""Home at last!"" he says.  When he later has to acquire two items on the black market, he learns that his home has become a place where ""These days, you can buy anything.""  The blessings of capitalism!  It is also a place where he continues to miss Dominique. One night, in his bedroom, he approaches a white, plaster bust of a woman as he listens to a casette tape conjugating French verbs, the last verb being ""to please,"" and the last conjugation being ""would that I had pleased.""What makes ""White"" such a delight to watch is not just the cleverly dark humor or the plot twists or the relational turmoil or the numerous interesting characters or even the lovely face of Julie Delpy.  (Zbigniew Zamachowski's face is every bit as fascinating to watch.)  It is all of these plus the number of sly details, both visual and verbal, that Kieslowski slips into his film that makes it rewarding to view -- and view again.  The details make viewing this movie more than a casual stroll in the park.  They make viewing it an outing for ""naturalists"" on the hunt for any significant sight or sound.The movie, however, is not just fun and games, though those are present. Nor, I think, is it really about ""getting even,"" though that would be a perverse kind of equality.  It is, essentially, a love story.  And that is why, at the end, when Karol cried, so did I.PS  Once again, if you see all of the flms in the ""Colors"" trilogy, you will note some recurring items.  Each film features a courthouse, a street-side recycling bin, and a fictitious composer named Budenmayer.  Why?

Movies about ""the human condition"" are, for me, almost invariably obvious. While this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love, impotence and the power of performance, revenge and a circling back to love, I thought it was handled with such off-hand, dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film. In a way, it struck me as an amuse-bouche, one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses. The movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness.Zbigniew Zamachowski does a masterful job as Karol, a sad sack if there ever was one, who gradually shows determination as well as obsession. I suppose one must just accept obsession as an unexplainable plot device in a movie, but Dominique got off to a very unsympathetic start. She'd wilt most men. Karol's obsession with her seemed a bit unreal. I found Karol developing into a resourceful, intelligent guy whom I began to admire. Dominique, though, didn't seem to change much. After all she put Karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most of the time -- I couldn't empathize much with Karol, but simply accepted things as the reason why I was enjoying the movie. I couldn't help thinking that if Karol had just had a few Viagra handy, none of his troubles would have begun. But then I thought about Dominique's essential characteristics, and I think that Karol would be better off with somebody new. I don't see a future for them.One of the things I liked a lot about this movie is that it kept me guessing. Was it going to be a romantic comedy, or a black comedy or some kind of excruciatingly dull exploration of sexual inadequacy? Was Karol really just a sad loser when he seemed sort of resourceful in a sad, funny way? What was he trying to do with his property purchase? Where did Dominque fit in or was this just a cameo with Delpy? Was something sad going to happen after I'd figured out it seemed to be a combination black/romantic comedy? I like a movie that I can't quite see the end to.People have said that this movie is the equality part of the trio. I saw this movie as a clever, bittersweet struggle for dominance, not equality, and laced with a little revenge.

369346,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303326838,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","The middle film of Polish-French film director Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy of Blue, White, and Red is a very black comedy, and generally considered the weakest of the three films. This is true, although, given the high quality of the tercet, White (Blanc) is still an excellent film, and compared with the mind-numbing comedies that Hollywood regularly cranks out, it is exceptional. And, at a mere hour and a half, this 1994 film never drags on too long. However, one of the major misconceptions about the film and its hero, Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski)- literally Charley Charley, is that he is a Chaplinesque figure. I believe that the many critics who use this term intend it as a high compliment, as they reference the greatest of the silent era screen stars, Charlie Chaplin, and his character of The Tramp. But, in doing so, they show how little they understand of the character and its portrayer.There is a range of emotion that The Tramp shows in both the short subjects and feature films he appears in that none of the actors whose performances have subsequently been compared with his have displayed. There have never been moments the equal of the roll dance in The Gold Rush, nor the ending of City Lights, where the blind girl realizes her seemingly rich benefactor is The Tramp, nor the scenes of modernity run amok in Modern Times, nor the dance with the globe in The Great Dictator. This is not to demean any of the later performances, for some, such as Giulieta Masina's role as Gelsomina in Federico Fellini's La Strada, or that of Zamachowski in White are excellent, but none rally come close to that Chaplinesque mix of lightheartedness and dark pathos. Karol, as example, is a far more dismal and dark character than any played by Chaplin. Right from the start there is something `off' about him. In Hollywood a character like his might end up a serial killer or child molester.That all said, White is a delightful if flawed comedy, and had it been a Hollywood film it would probably rank much higher in critical opinion worldwide. It's merely because American minds have been so cauterized by bad art that a film like this has to be judged against its superior European counterparts, and its own siblings in the Three Colors trilogy, rather than the minor leagues that American cinema represents. Were it judged against the standard fart comedy mindset, or that of the tired `romantic comedy' formulae, it would be seen in a far greater light. Regardless, it is well worth seeing, and a good way to spend an evening. When was the last romantic comedy from America that such a claim could be made for?",4,Good,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2661,"['middle', 'film', 'Polish-French', 'film', 'director', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Three', 'Colors', 'Trois', 'Couleurs', 'trilogy', 'Blue', 'White', 'Red', 'very', 'black', 'comedy', 'generally', 'considered', 'weakest', 'three', 'films', 'true', 'given', 'high', 'quality', 'tercet', 'White', 'Blanc', 'still', 'excellent', 'film', 'compared', 'mind-numbing', 'comedies', 'Hollywood', 'regularly', 'out', 'exceptional', 'mere', 'hour', 'half', '1994', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'long', 'However', 'one', 'major', 'misconceptions', 'film', 'hero', 'Karol', 'Karol', 'Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', 'literally', 'Charley', 'Charley', 'Chaplinesque', 'figure', 'believe', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'use', 'term', 'intend', 'high', 'compliment', 'reference', 'greatest', 'silent', 'era', 'screen', 'stars', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'character', 'Tramp', 'doing', 'so', 'show', 'how', 'little', 'understand', 'character', 'portrayer.There', 'range', 'emotion', 'Tramp', 'shows', 'short', 'subjects', 'feature', 'films', 'none', 'actors', 'performances', 'have', 'subsequently', 'been', 'compared', 'have', 'displayed', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'equal', 'roll', 'dance', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'ending', 'City', 'Lights', 'where', 'blind', 'girl', 'seemingly', 'rich', 'benefactor', 'Tramp', 'scenes', 'modernity', 'run', 'amok', 'Modern', 'Times', 'dance', 'globe', 'Great', 'Dictator', 'not', 'demean', 'later', 'performances', 'such', 'Giulieta', 'Masina', 'role', 'Gelsomina', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'La', 'Strada', 'Zamachowski', 'White', 'are', 'excellent', 'none', 'rally', 'come', 'close', 'Chaplinesque', 'mix', 'lightheartedness', 'dark', 'pathos', 'Karol', 'example', 'far', 'more', 'dismal', 'dark', 'character', 'played', 'Chaplin', 'Right', 'start', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'character', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'serial', 'killer', 'child', 'molester.That', 'said', 'White', 'delightful', 'flawed', 'comedy', 'had', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'rank', 'much', 'higher', 'critical', 'opinion', 'worldwide', 'merely', 'American', 'minds', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'cauterized', 'bad', 'art', 'film', 'be', 'judged', 'superior', 'European', 'counterparts', 'own', 'siblings', 'Three', 'Colors', 'trilogy', 'rather', 'minor', 'leagues', 'American', 'cinema', 'Were', 'judged', 'standard', 'fart', 'comedy', 'mindset', 'tired', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formulae', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'far', 'greater', 'light', 'Regardless', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'America', 'claim', 'could', 'be', 'made']",White VHS

Hamlow,"[0, 0]","Equality-the state or instance of being equal;  especially, the state of enjoying equal rights, as political, economic, and social.""What about equality?"" demands Polish &eacute;migr&eacute; and hairdresser Karol Karol to the judge during his divorce hearings.  Was the judge not hearing his case just because he couldn't speak French?  Karol's French wife, the lovely Dominique, has filed divorce charges against him because he can't perform in bed.  This leaves Karol in a pinch, as Dominique has tossed him and his suitcase out into the street, having been awarded the house and bank account.  Furthermore, it does fit the theme of equality in the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Tricoleurs trilogy, Blanc (French), or Bialy (Polish).  Dominique has the advantage of knowing French and French law.  Karol doesn't.  The only thing is for him to return back to Poland, which he does, in a suitcase!Fortunately, he has his brother Jurek, running his hairdressing salon, and Mikolaj (pron. Mikolai), a fellow Pole who has promised him a job, to kill someone who wants to take his own life but can't, for which he'll pay handsomely.  Yet Karol tells his target that we all want less pain in our lives and the technique he uses to dissuade his target is ingenious.  I mean, can one see Karol, who's a nice, maybe too nice a guy, as a killer?The colour symbolism of white works here as did blue for the first film in the trilogy.  Karol and Mikolaj run around in the snow as if they were kids.  From that point on, the white symbolizes a clean slate, where Karol's comeback begins.  Much of the scenery in Poland is against an overcast gray-white sky, but that provides the backdrop for his rejuvenation.  He's back home, where he becomes knowledgeable about the new post-Communist Poland and other things he learns to make it as a businessman.  And it is there that he decides to get back at his ex-wife.  Personally, I thought he was too lenient with her.Zbigniew Zamachowski shines as Karol, as does Janusz Gajos as the gloomy Mikolaj.  Julie Delpy is pretty but unsympathetic as Dominique, which was the point of the movie.  The vicious way she humiliates Karol that drives him back to Poland, most men would consider unforgivable.  Yet she's like a bookend, figuring in the beginning and final parts of White.  Oh, and Juliette Binoche, star of Blue, has a brief wordless cameo in the beginning, where she can be seen at the rear of the court chambers talking to the guards while Karol's hearing is in progress.To the extent that being at home in one's country and knowing the laws and people there makes people equal to one another, but only within the confines of their borders, which is a stark contrast to Blue, where one of the subplots involved a concerto for European unification.A good film to be sure, with a protagonist to root for, but Libertie, Revanche, Fraternite?",4,Equality in terms of knowledge in one's own country,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2879,"['Equality-the', 'state', 'instance', 'being', 'equal', 'especially', 'state', 'enjoying', 'equal', 'rights', 'political', 'economic', 'social', 'What', 'equality', 'Polish', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'hairdresser', 'Karol', 'Karol', 'judge', 'divorce', 'hearings', 'Was', 'judge', 'not', 'hearing', 'case', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'French', 'Karol', 'French', 'wife', 'lovely', 'Dominique', 'filed', 'divorce', 'charges', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'bed', 'Karol', 'pinch', 'Dominique', 'tossed', 'suitcase', 'out', 'street', 'having', 'been', 'awarded', 'house', 'bank', 'account', 'Furthermore', 'fit', 'theme', 'equality', 'second', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Tricoleurs', 'trilogy', 'Blanc', 'French', 'Bialy', 'Polish', 'Dominique', 'advantage', 'knowing', 'French', 'French', 'law', 'Karol', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'return', 'back', 'Poland', 'suitcase', 'Fortunately', 'brother', 'Jurek', 'running', 'hairdressing', 'salon', 'Mikolaj', 'pron', 'Mikolai', 'fellow', 'Pole', 'who', 'promised', 'job', 'kill', 'someone', 'who', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'pay', 'handsomely', 'Karol', 'target', 'want', 'less', 'pain', 'lives', 'technique', 'dissuade', 'target', 'ingenious', 'mean', 'can', 'one', 'see', 'Karol', 'who', 'nice', 'maybe', 'too', 'nice', 'guy', 'killer', 'colour', 'symbolism', 'white', 'works', 'here', 'did', 'blue', 'first', 'film', 'trilogy', 'Karol', 'Mikolaj', 'run', 'around', 'snow', 'were', 'kids', 'point', 'white', 'clean', 'slate', 'where', 'Karol', 'comeback', 'Much', 'scenery', 'Poland', 'overcast', 'gray-white', 'sky', 'backdrop', 'rejuvenation', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'knowledgeable', 'new', 'post-Communist', 'Poland', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'businessman', 'there', 'get', 'back', 'ex-wife', 'Personally', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'lenient', 'her.Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', 'Karol', 'Janusz', 'Gajos', 'gloomy', 'Mikolaj', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'pretty', 'unsympathetic', 'Dominique', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'vicious', 'way', 'Karol', 'back', 'Poland', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'consider', 'unforgivable', 'bookend', 'figuring', 'beginning', 'final', 'parts', 'White', 'Oh', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'star', 'Blue', 'brief', 'wordless', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'rear', 'court', 'chambers', 'talking', 'guards', 'Karol', 'hearing', 'progress.To', 'extent', 'being', 'home', 'one', 'country', 'knowing', 'laws', 'people', 'there', 'people', 'equal', 'one', 'only', 'confines', 'borders', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Blue', 'where', 'one', 'subplots', 'involved', 'concerto', 'European', 'unification.A', 'good', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'protagonist', 'root', 'Libertie', 'Revanche', 'Fraternite']",White VHS
369348,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6303326838,darragh o'donoghue,"[10, 13]","'White' is a refreshing improvement on its portentous predecessor 'Blue', a dazzling tragicomedy about an impotent Polish hairdresser, Karol, who is unceremoniously divorced by his Parisian wife, thrown out onto the streets without a sou, a possport or much French.  Busking on the Metro, he meets a fellow Pole, the lugubrious Mikolaj, who smuggles him back to their home country.  Determined to exact revenge on his wife, Karol begins to trade very profitably on the black market.Maybe it's because Kieslowski is back in Poland, but 'White' is a much 'lighter' film than its predecessor, not in the sense of insubstantial, but in the director's relaxing the grip of his elaborate style, allowing his effects emanate from his story, his wonderful characters and the Polish landscape overlooking the post-communist embrace of (crooked) Western capitalism.  Though still glossy compared to his earlier films, the relentless striving for poetic preciosity that marred 'Blue' is checked.  Perhaps the return to Poland allowed Kieslowski to make an authentically East European film, a kind of absurdist shaggy dog story, its black comedy aching with anguish.  The almost-ridiculous, little-man clown-hero could have bumbled from Gogol or Kafka (or silent cinema?), rumpled, besuited, a bit roly-poly, self-important despite being victim to a fate with a very sick, humiliating sense of humour - his admiring gaze at one of the film's many pigeons ends with dirt sliming down his shirt, just before a court appearance; the bank teller who cuts his frozen credit card is suitably, bureaucratically, inexorably faceless.The film's comic tension emerges from the disparity between the character's unintentional individuality, his being made seem eccentric because of the unfortunate things inflicted on him, and others' reaction to him; and his dehumanisation, both comically, as he is smuggled by suitcase to Poland, a devalued commodity fetish, only to be purloined by airport thieves, and, more bleakly, in the hardening of his soul as he becomes more successful at being a capitalist - the ironic message of 'White' seems to be that money and power is the key to sexual potency.  Karol's natural self was deemed a social failure, so he has to play a part, even if it risks killing his soul, even if he must play a corpse, become his own ghost though he tries to assert the primacy of his body.  His progress is symbolised in the film by the importance of language (translating, interpreting and misunderstanding), with epiphany only possibly with its transcendence in a physical, non-verbal communication, perhaps the human equivalent of what Kieslowski tried to do in his films, reach viewers through pure cinema.Like 'Blue', and all his films, 'White' is structured around recurring and reconfigured imagery - birds, suitcases, glass, statues, combs, 'lucky' coins, snow etc., - but, again, because they  belong to the story's world, rather than being imposed on it by a style, they seem much more effective.'White' isn't perfect - the plot is damaged by nagging implausibilities, and the film certainly dips in the second half, but that's inevitable after the fleet comic energy preceeding it, swept along by the tango melodies of Zbigniew Preisner's score, a welcome contrast to the bombast of 'Blue', and again more rooted to place.  Once again, Kieslowski's irony, his play with viewpoint and fantasy, suggests we don't take his images or plot developments at face value.",4,The most under-rated of the 'Three Colours' trilogy.,1022198400,"05 24, 2002",2002,3473,"['refreshing', 'improvement', 'portentous', 'predecessor', ""'Blue"", 'dazzling', 'tragicomedy', 'impotent', 'Polish', 'hairdresser', 'Karol', 'who', 'unceremoniously', 'divorced', 'Parisian', 'wife', 'thrown', 'out', 'streets', 'sou', 'possport', 'much', 'French', 'Busking', 'Metro', 'fellow', 'Pole', 'lugubrious', 'Mikolaj', 'who', 'back', 'home', 'country', 'Determined', 'exact', 'revenge', 'wife', 'Karol', 'trade', 'very', 'profitably', 'black', 'market.Maybe', 'Kieslowski', 'back', 'Poland', ""'White"", 'much', ""'lighter"", 'film', 'predecessor', 'not', 'sense', 'insubstantial', 'director', 'relaxing', 'grip', 'elaborate', 'style', 'allowing', 'effects', 'emanate', 'story', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'Polish', 'landscape', 'overlooking', 'post-communist', 'embrace', 'crooked', 'Western', 'capitalism', 'still', 'glossy', 'compared', 'earlier', 'films', 'relentless', 'striving', 'poetic', 'preciosity', 'marred', ""'Blue"", 'checked', 'Perhaps', 'return', 'Poland', 'allowed', 'Kieslowski', 'make', 'authentically', 'East', 'European', 'film', 'kind', 'absurdist', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'story', 'black', 'comedy', 'aching', 'anguish', 'almost-ridiculous', 'little-man', 'clown-hero', 'could', 'have', 'bumbled', 'Gogol', 'Kafka', 'silent', 'cinema', 'rumpled', 'besuited', 'bit', 'roly-poly', 'self-important', 'being', 'victim', 'fate', 'very', 'sick', 'humiliating', 'sense', 'humour', 'admiring', 'gaze', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'pigeons', 'dirt', 'sliming', 'down', 'shirt', 'just', 'court', 'appearance', 'bank', 'teller', 'who', 'frozen', 'credit', 'card', 'suitably', 'bureaucratically', 'inexorably', 'faceless.The', 'film', 'comic', 'tension', 'disparity', 'character', 'unintentional', 'individuality', 'being', 'made', 'seem', 'eccentric', 'unfortunate', 'things', 'inflicted', 'others', 'reaction', 'dehumanisation', 'comically', 'smuggled', 'suitcase', 'Poland', 'devalued', 'commodity', 'fetish', 'only', 'be', 'purloined', 'airport', 'thieves', 'more', 'bleakly', 'hardening', 'soul', 'more', 'successful', 'being', 'capitalist', 'ironic', 'message', ""'White"", 'be', 'money', 'power', 'key', 'sexual', 'potency', 'Karol', 'natural', 'self', 'was', 'deemed', 'social', 'failure', 'play', 'part', 'even', 'killing', 'soul', 'even', 'must', 'play', 'corpse', 'become', 'own', 'ghost', 'assert', 'primacy', 'body', 'progress', 'symbolised', 'film', 'importance', 'language', 'translating', 'interpreting', 'misunderstanding', 'epiphany', 'only', 'possibly', 'transcendence', 'physical', 'non-verbal', 'communication', 'perhaps', 'human', 'equivalent', 'what', 'Kieslowski', 'tried', 'do', 'films', 'reach', 'viewers', 'pure', 'cinema.Like', ""'Blue"", 'films', ""'White"", 'structured', 'recurring', 'reconfigured', 'imagery', 'birds', 'suitcases', 'glass', 'statues', 'combs', 'coins', 'snow', 'etc.', 'again', 'belong', 'story', 'world', 'rather', 'being', 'imposed', 'style', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'effective', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'plot', 'damaged', 'nagging', 'implausibilities', 'film', 'certainly', 'second', 'half', 'inevitable', 'fleet', 'comic', 'energy', 'preceeding', 'swept', 'along', 'tango', 'melodies', 'Zbigniew', 'Preisner', 'score', 'welcome', 'contrast', 'bombast', ""'Blue"", 'again', 'more', 'rooted', 'place', 'Once', 'again', 'Kieslowski', 'irony', 'play', 'viewpoint', 'fantasy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'images', 'plot', 'developments', 'face', 'value']",White VHS

She is unhappy with him, VERY unhappy.

And &quot;White&quot; is also the second volume of Krzysztof Kieslowski's &quot;Three Colors Trilogy,&quot; a witty and sharp tragicomedy about revenge. It's also the weak point hanging between the melancholy &quot;Blue&quot; and vibrant &quot;Red,&quot; with its less likable characters and more unbelievable plotline.Hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him. She also strips him of his money and possessions, leaving him playing pitiful music at the subways. What's more, she rubs it in his face that she's now having sex with other men.Things can't get worse, right? Wrong: Karol goes back to Poland and ends up getting beaten up and robbed. Via some not-so-legal methods, Karol builds himself an impressive fortune and becomes determined to get back at his cold, manipulative ex-wife. Amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, Karol finds the perfect method to bring Dominique down...&quot;White&quot; is certainly a successful black comedy -- it's sort of weirdly, freakily funny. Unfortunately, it's also the weakest of Kieslowski's &quot;Colors&quot; movies -- some of the plot devices seem too unbelievable (like Karol shipping himself in a trunk), and the tricks and twists of the plot are a little too much to swallow. However, the twisted love/hate relationship between Dominique and Karol is fascinating, and Karol's revenge is devilishly clever for what seems like a nice, goofy little man.White is the color of wedding dresses and various other marriage-related things. But here, it's nothing so nice: an anti-color, a space where color isn't. It's snow, it's emptiness, it's colorless, it's passionless. Kieslowski's black comedy is sprinkled with white -- white cars, white skies, white marble, white snow. There's less grace in Kieslowski's direction, but the images he creates are still breathtakingly pretty and subtle. (The &quot;sign language&quot; scene is evidence enough)Zamachowski has an underrated turn as Karol Karol. He seems like a nice, sweet guy who takes one kick in the teeth after another, kind of like a lost puppy. In a word: Loser. In another word: Wimp.Then he shows his dark side -- one that, on the outside, nobody would think Karol had. And Delpy does a lovely job making Dominique into a malicious schemer, without making her two-dimensionally nasty.This droll dark comedy is a bit flawed, but it shows Kieslowski's unmistakable style and wit, and the acting is nearly impeccable.

I guess I just should not get my hopes up! First of all Julie Delpy is one of the two stars of this film which naturally creates a need for me not to like it. And she did not disappoint. Her cruel character is horrible in this film, which was of course deliberate, but somehow I just did not like her in the role even if she was effective. She divorces her Polish hairdresser husband, played very convincingly by Zbigniew Zamachowski, because he is supposedly impotent. She also drives him out of France and taunts him with her other sexual exploits. He eventually returns to his native Poland after he has by chance met another fellow Polish national who offers him a job. All he has to do is kill a man who is too weak to commit suicide and he will receive a large sum of money. In the meantime, Zamachowski works during his days and eventually steals some business plans from someone and becomes a very wealthy man. He and the Polish man he met before leaving France are in business together. Then the day comes that the man tells Zamachowski that the man wants to die. When Z. arrives to do the deed he discovers that the man wanting to commit suicide is one and the same man as his business partner and friend. He agrees to shoot him, but he shoots him with a blank in case the man changes his mind. In the end, Zamachowski decides to stage his own death and leave all the money to his former wife. Delpy arrives for the mock funeral and then Zamachowski meets her in her hotel room, has sex with her and leaves her in the morning. The police arrive the following morning and arrest her for his murder. Perfect revenge, but overall it seemed a bit... petty.

369356,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6303326838,Joseph Haschka,"[4, 4]","Mouse's revengeWHITE is one in a trilogy of French films also comprising BLUE and RED.As the film opens, Polish emigre Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) arrives in a Parisian court for his divorce hearing. His wife, the ravishing Dominique (Julie Delpy), is giving him the toss because he no longer satisfies her sexually, although she admits he was hot stuff when they first met in Warsaw.After the dissolution of the marriage is decreed, Dominique dumps Karol's possessions, all contained in a large trunk, into the car park and drives off. Karol soon discovers that she's also cut off his access to their joint bank account. Karol, now down and out and soliciting handouts in the Paris Metro, absorbs the abuse without any overt sign of anger, even after his ex figuratively pushes his nose into the fact that she's copulating with another man. Karol is the meekest and most inoffensive of men. Let's not mince words; he's a wimp.With the help of another Pole, Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), Karol returns to Warsaw by an unusual route. Once arrived, he literally ends up in a ditch. Rock bottom is a hard place.Karol is an award-winning hairdresser, and he begins working in his brother's beauty shop. Through good luck and a series of shrewd moves unrelated to the hair trade, he becomes rich. And it's also clear that he remains obsessed with Dominique.WHITE is somewhat less subtle than BLUE, and therefore demands less cerebral exercise on the part of the viewer; BLUE tries too hard to be obscure. Karol is an enormously endearing character, much like a puppy that's been kicked. And, though we don't know what his grand strategy is, we recognize that he has a plan that he's clearly implementing. The lovely Juliette Binoche in BLUE is a more aloof figure as she struggles to recover from a family tragedy, and it's only from close-ups of her face that the audience can infer what's going on inside. WHITE is thus, to this viewer, the more satisfying of the two.Zamachowski's performance is solid, and Mikolaj is the friend that anybody could hope for. And Delpy's Dominique is eye candy that would drive any sober man on a fevered quest.It's said that revenge is a dish that's best eaten cold, and WHITE suggests such a meal. The very last scene strongly implies, however, that Karol ultimately lacks the requisite dispassion.",4,Mouse's revenge,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,2331,"['Mouse', 'revengeWHITE', 'one', 'trilogy', 'French', 'films', 'also', 'comprising', 'BLUE', 'RED.As', 'film', 'Polish', 'emigre', 'Karol', 'Karol', 'Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', 'Parisian', 'court', 'divorce', 'hearing', 'wife', 'ravishing', 'Dominique', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'giving', 'toss', 'no', 'longer', 'sexually', 'was', 'hot', 'stuff', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'Warsaw.After', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'decreed', 'Dominique', 'Karol', 'possessions', 'contained', 'large', 'trunk', 'car', 'park', 'off', 'Karol', 'soon', 'also', 'cut', 'off', 'access', 'joint', 'bank', 'account', 'Karol', 'now', 'down', 'soliciting', 'handouts', 'Paris', 'Metro', 'abuse', 'overt', 'sign', 'anger', 'even', 'ex', 'figuratively', 'nose', 'fact', 'copulating', 'man', 'Karol', 'meekest', 'most', 'inoffensive', 'men', 'Let', 'not', 'mince', 'words', 'wimp.With', 'help', 'Pole', 'Mikolaj', 'Janusz', 'Gajos', 'Karol', 'Warsaw', 'unusual', 'route', 'Once', 'arrived', 'literally', 'up', 'ditch', 'Rock', 'bottom', 'hard', 'place.Karol', 'award-winning', 'hairdresser', 'working', 'brother', 'beauty', 'shop', 'good', 'luck', 'series', 'shrewd', 'moves', 'unrelated', 'hair', 'trade', 'rich', 'also', 'clear', 'obsessed', 'Dominique.WHITE', 'somewhat', 'less', 'subtle', 'BLUE', 'therefore', 'demands', 'less', 'cerebral', 'exercise', 'part', 'viewer', 'BLUE', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'obscure', 'Karol', 'enormously', 'endearing', 'character', 'much', 'puppy', 'been', 'kicked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'grand', 'strategy', 'recognize', 'plan', 'clearly', 'implementing', 'lovely', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'BLUE', 'more', 'aloof', 'figure', 'recover', 'family', 'tragedy', 'only', 'close-ups', 'face', 'audience', 'can', 'infer', 'what', 'going', 'inside', 'WHITE', 'thus', 'viewer', 'more', 'satisfying', 'two.Zamachowski', 'performance', 'solid', 'Mikolaj', 'friend', 'anybody', 'could', 'hope', 'Delpy', 'Dominique', 'eye', 'candy', 'would', 'drive', 'sober', 'man', 'fevered', 'quest.It', 'said', 'revenge', 'dish', 'best', 'eaten', 'cold', 'WHITE', 'suggests', 'such', 'meal', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'strongly', 'however', 'Karol', 'ultimately', 'requisite', 'dispassion']",White VHS

I find myself surprised to say this, since ""Blue"" is a masterpiece, but ""White"" is as well and happens to be funny, entertaining, well-acted, sad, and moving. What else could you ask for? While the protagonist in ""Blue"" was a cold woman (played by Juliette Binoche) reeling from the loss of her husband and child, ""White"" has a man as a protagonist despite the fact that it is Julie Delpy who graces the cover of the film. The movie stars Zbigniew Zamachowski as Karol, a Polish immigrant who has lost everything to his wife Dominique (Delpy) in divorce court. Desperate to get out of Paris and back into post-Communist Poland, he befriends a man named Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos) who happens to be heading to Poland himself. In one of the films great scenes, they hatch a plan to get Karol back into Poland by having him hide himself inside his suitcase and be shipped there. Problem is, when Mikolaj gets off the plane and goes to retrieve his ""luggage"" he finds that the suitcase is not there. It has been stolen by thieves, who break the lock and (finding only Karol) beat him and leave him there. When he wakes up, he looks around and yells ""home at last!"" As the movie continues, Karol tries to get his life back together by making lots of money with one goal in mind...Get revenge on Dominique.This leads to a touching, terrific climax that is truly the perfect way to end the film. The more films I see by Kieslowski (I've seen 2/3 of ""The Decalogue"" and ""Blue), the more I appreciate him and begin to agree with Roger Ebert that he was one of the best filmmakers. His films are so well made and so well written, and they all seem so real. While ""Blue"" was, essentially, a tragedy; ""White"" could fall into the category of ""dark comedy."" So it's a film that might appeal to a broader audience. As for the acting, it's superb. Gajos and Zamachowski are superb; I really can't imagine better actors in the roles. Delpy has limited screen-time, but eats up this role. The DVD has a lot of interesting Bonus Features, including Delpy reflecting on Kieslowski. If you haven't seen the Three Colors Trilogy, I recommend you rent/buy ""Blue"" now. These are films that shouldn't be missed.GRADE: A",5,A Fantastic Movie.

The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.

I slept thru the day and subsequently wa sup teh night with nothing to do so I dug out my video tapes that I hadn't seen yet.  First Blue and then White. White is amazing.  Little Karol is heartbreaking adorable and ... and as he progresses through the film becomes almost dynamic, ..., charismatic with the power he soon weilds.  He's a simple man, simply in love with a woman who may or not have married him to bilk him---I wa snever quite clear if she saw an opportunity with this renowned Polish hairdresser or if he truly failed her in the marriage.  She makes much of his impotence but it seems to stem from his worship and adore for her that he doesn't want to sully her with carnmal passions.  Unfortunately she's a carnal woman.  Finally Karol gets himself sent back to Poland in a suitcase (hilarious by itself) and goes to work for the quasi-Polish mob and eventually tricks them.  What I appreciated most about this film was that Karol is not a dumb man, nor is he a loser, he's simply a man too far in love with someone who doesn't appreciate the depth of that love.  Yet what make sthe film a masterstroke is the otherside that love comes out to---there is indeed a thin line between love and hate.  The way the plot itself meanders, self aware of it's destination with only vague hints as to its' intentions also make this a triumph.  Karol's love-revenge at the end is so subtle, so devilishly simple and yet a true, true comeuppance to this woman that it realizes itself as giving her what she wants, what she needs and then makes her ask for what he wants.  If you love someone you set them free but if you adore someone you create a huge White space within their consciousness about ones self.  Domonique will never, ever forget not truly begin to fathom Karol and how he loved her.  It just occured to me that perhaps certain peopel don't understand love and must be put away for teh sake of those who love too much---another meditation on this film.

The pigeon defecating on him certainly symbolizes that even the symbolic has termed him worthy only of excrement (as the image of his wedding appears, his beautiful wife running and the pigeons flying away, allowing the horizon to shine light on the newly-born couple).  Excrement breeds excrement, he is returned to Poland and emerges in a dump, where he is unceremoniously reminded that the world rejects him, even without any good reason.  The tone of the film shies away from just perpetuating silliness and wanton punishment, which makes a lot of sense.  The only friend he finds has his own fatalistic journey chiseled in mud (...), the responsibility of which is too overbearing to deal with alone.  Clearly Karol, despite being able to encounter wealth, is still completely enamored with his ex-wife; again, their communication was always based on primitive grounding... she said herself that any words of connection / affection would fall on deaf ears, so to speak.  The reason for the marriage to end and the manner in which she cruelly punishes him on the phone do indeed sink to the utmost nonverbal level, and in this universe, intelligence is not even ballast.  It is these primordial noises that transcend all forms of logic that indeed define his value as not only a husband but a human being.  The unwanted wretch he represented to her could not sustain himself despite material gain.  Regardless of the denouement and its perverse connotations, Karol did indeed need to destroy his former self in order to create a sense of desire in Dominique; she became attracted to the born-again, fully verbal, sexually potent man, and the climax during the sex scene radiates white light in a demonstration of a new unity being forged.  However, he cannot look at her in the aftermath.  When his fantasy fell apart in the materialization of his libidinal wishes, he could not maintain himself in this new life in its purest sense, he had to pervert it.  In doing so, fantasy and libido are recreated, in a haphazard and messy way.

369365,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,6303326838,Richard J. Brzostek,"[0, 0]","""Blanc"" (White) is part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy of French films with the names of colors of the French flag.  It is a deep movie that with a lot of symbolism.  From items that are the same color as the title and may have deeper meaning (such as pidgins, bird droppings, and even toilets) to reoccurring themes (such as the main character Karol using his binoculars thought the film), there are more than a few things in here to make film watchers wondering for a long time.The premise of the story is a bit depressing.  It starts out with a man getting divorced.  Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) doesn't want a divorce, but is pushed into this new life by his mean wife who torments him.Karol transforms himself from a hairdresser to a business savvy man.  With his newfound skills, he cooks up a plot to get the attention of his ex-wife.  I found his determination to be the most enjoyable part of the film.  It may be debatable whether he was motivated by revenge or love, but regardless of his motivation, the story is compelling.Although the film has a French title, the language of the film is a mix of French and Polish, with Polish being spoken more than French.  Besides Zamachowski, ""White"" also stars three other highly talented Polish actors (Jerzy Stuhr, Janusz Gajos, and Cezary Pazura).  Overall, I thought the film was well cast and is sure to entertain, albeit in a black humor type of way.",5,Karol transforms himself from a hairdresser to a business savvy man,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,1413,"['Blanc', 'White', 'part', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'trilogy', 'French', 'films', 'names', 'colors', 'French', 'flag', 'deep', 'movie', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'items', 'are', 'same', 'color', 'title', 'may', 'have', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'such', 'pidgins', 'bird', 'droppings', 'even', 'toilets', 'reoccurring', 'themes', 'such', 'main', 'character', 'Karol', 'using', 'binoculars', 'thought', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'make', 'film', 'watchers', 'wondering', 'long', 'time.The', 'premise', 'story', 'bit', 'depressing', 'out', 'man', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Karol', 'Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', ""n't"", 'want', 'divorce', 'pushed', 'new', 'life', 'mean', 'wife', 'who', 'him.Karol', 'transforms', 'hairdresser', 'business', 'savvy', 'man', 'newfound', 'skills', 'up', 'plot', 'get', 'attention', 'ex-wife', 'found', 'determination', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'debatable', 'was', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'love', 'regardless', 'motivation', 'story', 'film', 'French', 'title', 'language', 'film', 'mix', 'French', 'Polish', 'Polish', 'being', 'spoken', 'more', 'French', 'Zamachowski', 'White', 'also', 'stars', 'three', 'other', 'highly', 'talented', 'Polish', 'actors', 'Jerzy', 'Stuhr', 'Janusz', 'Gajos', 'Cezary', 'Pazura', 'Overall', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'sure', 'entertain', 'albeit', 'black', 'humor', 'type', 'way']",White VHS
369366,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303326838,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","White (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994)When I mentioned to people that I was in the midst of watching Three Colours, Kieslowski's celebrated film trilogy, for the first time, to a person, I got the same reaction: ""oh, Blue is my favorite of the three, but the other two are really good as well!"" Of course, if you've been following along, you know me: if there's a sacred cow around, I have an overwhelming urge to turn it into shish-kebab, and that may be part of the reason that, now that I've given myself a few weeks' perspective from all three films, I've landed on White as my favorite of the three. But it could also be that White is the film that, in some odd way that I can't quite put my finger on, most reminded me of Dekalog, my favorite Kieslowski offering. Even though Blue has the most surface connection to Dekalog, White has a great deal of that same mindset going on under the hood. Kieskowski's masterful morality play would have fit right in with Dekalog, I think.The wonderfully-named Karol Karol (The Call of the Toad's Zbigniew Zamachowski) is a Polish expatriate barely getting by in Paris. His lovely young wife Dominique (Killing Zoe's Julie Delpy) has just divorced him after only six months, and he finds himself homeless. While playing a comb in the metro to pick up spare change, he meets Mikolaj (Aquarium's Janusz Gajos), a wealthy Polish businessman who wants Karol to come back to Poland with him to perform a service (saying what would be a spoiler). Things turn out unexpectedly in Poland, and Karol, who has never forgotten Dominique's betrayal, alternately tries to go on with his life without her and concocts absurd schemes to win her back.I think one of the reasons I liked White more than the other two films is that, of the Kieslowski works I've seen (all the major films at this point, and a few of the shorts-- not nearly as many as I'd like), it's the out-and-out funniest; it requires a warped sense of humor, to be sure, but Karol is without doubt meant to be a comic figure, and Zamachowski's hapless portrayal is spot-on. Karol never feels entirely comfortable in his skin, whether he's on top of the world or at the bottom of the trash heap, and it's Zamachowski's excellent portrayal of Karol that makes this film a success as much as it is Kieslowski's impressive directorial skills. Whereas Juliette Binoche's character in Blue was never less than self-assured, even when she was entirely lost, Karol is her opposite; he's never self-assured even when he's most found. And yet neither Zamachowski nor Kieslowski ever overplay their hands; Karol is usually at least sympathetic, if not outright pathetic, but Zamachowski does it so well that even the well-worn clich&eacute; that forms the final movement of the film comes off as fresh and inviting.White is Kieslowski at his finest, easily on a par with episodes five and seven of Dekalog. I cannot recommend the films of Kieslowski highly enough, if you haven't already experienced them; while I'd suggest starting with Dekalog, it does represent a serious chunk of time, and Three Colours gives you a taste of the genius without having to invest eleven hours and change. **** ",5,Utterly brilliant,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,3177,"['White', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', '1994', 'When', 'mentioned', 'people', 'was', 'midst', 'watching', 'Three', 'Colours', 'Kieslowski', 'celebrated', 'film', 'trilogy', 'first', 'time', 'person', 'got', 'same', 'reaction', 'oh', 'Blue', 'favorite', 'three', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'well', 'course', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'along', 'know', 'sacred', 'cow', 'have', 'overwhelming', 'urge', 'turn', 'shish-kebab', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'now', ""'ve"", 'given', 'few', 'weeks', 'perspective', 'three', 'films', ""'ve"", 'landed', 'White', 'favorite', 'three', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'White', 'film', 'odd', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'most', 'reminded', 'Dekalog', 'favorite', 'Kieslowski', 'offering', 'Even', 'Blue', 'most', 'surface', 'connection', 'Dekalog', 'White', 'great', 'deal', 'same', 'mindset', 'going', 'hood', 'Kieskowski', 'masterful', 'morality', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'Dekalog', 'think.The', 'wonderfully-named', 'Karol', 'Karol', 'Call', 'Toad', 'Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', 'Polish', 'expatriate', 'barely', 'getting', 'Paris', 'lovely', 'young', 'wife', 'Dominique', 'Killing', 'Zoe', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'just', 'divorced', 'only', 'six', 'months', 'homeless', 'playing', 'comb', 'metro', 'pick', 'up', 'spare', 'change', 'Mikolaj', 'Aquarium', 'Janusz', 'Gajos', 'wealthy', 'Polish', 'businessman', 'who', 'Karol', 'come', 'back', 'Poland', 'perform', 'service', 'saying', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'Things', 'turn', 'out', 'unexpectedly', 'Poland', 'Karol', 'who', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Dominique', 'betrayal', 'alternately', 'go', 'life', 'absurd', 'schemes', 'win', 'back.I', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'liked', 'White', 'more', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'Kieslowski', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'major', 'films', 'point', 'few', 'shorts', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', ""'d"", 'like', 'out-and-out', 'funniest', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'be', 'sure', 'Karol', 'doubt', 'meant', 'be', 'comic', 'figure', 'Zamachowski', 'hapless', 'portrayal', 'spot-on', 'Karol', 'never', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'top', 'world', 'bottom', 'trash', 'heap', 'Zamachowski', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Karol', 'film', 'success', 'as', 'much', 'Kieslowski', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'skills', 'Whereas', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'character', 'Blue', 'was', 'never', 'less', 'self-assured', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'entirely', 'lost', 'Karol', 'opposite', 'never', 'self-assured', 'even', 'when', 'most', 'found', 'yet', 'Zamachowski', 'Kieslowski', 'ever', 'overplay', 'hands', 'Karol', 'usually', 'least', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'outright', 'pathetic', 'Zamachowski', 'so', 'well', 'even', 'well-worn', 'clich', 'eacute', 'final', 'movement', 'film', 'off', 'fresh', 'inviting.White', 'Kieslowski', 'finest', 'easily', 'par', 'episodes', 'five', 'seven', 'Dekalog', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'films', 'Kieslowski', 'highly', 'enough', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'experienced', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'starting', 'Dekalog', 'represent', 'serious', 'chunk', 'time', 'Three', 'Colours', 'taste', 'genius', 'having', 'invest', 'eleven', 'hours', 'change', '****']",White VHS

""White"" is actually a revenge-tale that has an underlying mean streak in addition to its more comical elements.  It is a film that revels in the idea that a man scorned can be just as dangerous as a woman scorned.""White"" traces the journey of Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), a hairdresser from Poland.  Karol is a simple man who has become despondent over his upcoming divorce in France.  Unable to reconcile with his former wife, Dominique (Julie Delpy), Karol returns home curled up in a suitcase and sets into motion a series of events that culminates with him becoming a successful businessman.  He uses his newfound wealth and power to reignite Dominique's interest in him, but when she arrives in Poland, Karol exacts his revenge when she unwittingly falls into his trap.Zamachowski's performance in ""White"" is a treasure.  His Karol is a lovable character whose darkness comes as a bit of a shock when it emerges because of the disarming effect of his more charming side.  Yet, this does not mean Karol is sinister.  Calling him complicated would be more accurate as the film makes clear that he has mixed feelings over his actions.  While he wants to get even with Dominique, he is still deeply in love with her as she continuously fills his thoughts long after they are separated.  Such a complicated characterization is a welcome sight amongst the one-dimensional stock figures that inhabit many current films.

369370,A17B9MOP3FIJUF,6303326838,"The Loved One ""curiouser and curiouser!""","[8, 10]","In downtown Warsaw, where so much of &quot;White&quot; is set, there was an electric sign celebrating Poland's recent release from the Iron Curtain of communism by praising Bill Clinton and splashing around an American  flag. The electric sign, though, was not like the monumental Panasonic sign  in New York's Times Square. Rather it was more comparable to the signs  composed of light bulbs that can be found in major league baseball  stadiums.  I thought of that sign many times throughout &quot;White,&quot;  how meager it looked in a nation already so deprived.  &quot;White&quot;  deals with the disillusionment and failure of one man who represents the  disappointment of a nation. When the protagonist, Karol, returns to Warsaw  from Paris, after being rejected and betrayed by his French wife,  Dominique, through divorce and infidelity, and by the French court, whom  Karol believes has cheated him in the divorce by giving him nothing because  he cannot speak French (both a clear metaphor for the West's disregard of  Poland), he is greeted by a city where bands of thieves roam the land like  the Middle Ages, and gangster capitalists own everything and can buy  anything. Karol then aspires to become part of this amoral ruling class,  thereby becoming more equal than anybody else. In &quot;White,&quot;  besides the inequitable wealth between Karol and his fellow Polish  countrymen,  there is an intricate interplay between the affluence of the  West and the lowered expectations of Poland. In Paris, Karol and is wife  owned a clean well-lit salon, but back in Warsaw, his brother's salon has  little more than a gaudy electric sign to distinguish it from the days of  communist rule, and it is located along a muddy, unpaved road. A loan  shark, who hires Karol to protect him, gives Karol what amounts to a cap  gun as his weapon. And even an expensive office building in downtown Warsaw  only has a few phone jacks. This comparison is perhaps Kieslowski's message  that there is no perfect equality, either within a nation (as demonstrated  through both Karol's amassed wealth and influence, and the discrimination  against his at the hands of the French judicial system) or between nations.  Kieslowski also suggests, through the relationship between Karol and  Dominique, that perhaps love can bridge this gap.",5,First Among Equals,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,2333,"['downtown', 'Warsaw', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'quot', 'White', 'quot', 'set', 'was', 'electric', 'sign', 'celebrating', 'Poland', 'recent', 'release', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'communism', 'praising', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'splashing', 'around', 'American', 'flag', 'electric', 'sign', 'was', 'not', 'monumental', 'Panasonic', 'sign', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Square', 'was', 'more', 'comparable', 'signs', 'composed', 'light', 'bulbs', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'stadiums', 'thought', 'sign', 'many', 'times', 'quot', 'White', 'quot', 'how', 'meager', 'looked', 'nation', 'already', 'so', 'deprived', 'quot', 'White', 'quot', 'deals', 'disillusionment', 'failure', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'disappointment', 'nation', 'When', 'protagonist', 'Karol', 'Warsaw', 'Paris', 'being', 'rejected', 'betrayed', 'French', 'wife', 'Dominique', 'divorce', 'infidelity', 'French', 'court', 'whom', 'Karol', 'cheated', 'divorce', 'giving', 'nothing', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'French', 'clear', 'metaphor', 'West', 'disregard', 'Poland', 'greeted', 'city', 'where', 'bands', 'thieves', 'roam', 'land', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'gangster', 'capitalists', 'own', 'everything', 'can', 'buy', 'anything', 'Karol', 'then', 'become', 'part', 'amoral', 'ruling', 'class', 'thereby', 'becoming', 'more', 'equal', 'anybody', 'else', 'quot', 'White', 'quot', 'inequitable', 'wealth', 'Karol', 'fellow', 'Polish', 'countrymen', 'intricate', 'interplay', 'affluence', 'West', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'Poland', 'Paris', 'Karol', 'wife', 'owned', 'clean', 'well-lit', 'salon', 'back', 'Warsaw', 'brother', 'salon', 'little', 'more', 'gaudy', 'electric', 'sign', 'distinguish', 'days', 'communist', 'rule', 'located', 'muddy', 'unpaved', 'road', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'Karol', 'protect', 'Karol', 'what', 'cap', 'gun', 'weapon', 'even', 'expensive', 'office', 'building', 'downtown', 'Warsaw', 'only', 'few', 'phone', 'jacks', 'comparison', 'perhaps', 'Kieslowski', 'message', 'perfect', 'equality', 'either', 'nation', 'demonstrated', 'Karol', 'amassed', 'wealth', 'influence', 'discrimination', 'hands', 'French', 'judicial', 'system', 'nations', 'Kieslowski', 'also', 'relationship', 'Karol', 'Dominique', 'perhaps', 'love', 'can', 'bridge', 'gap']",White VHS

I had to rewind the tape because I didn't understand Delpy's  &quot;sign language&quot; the first time.  However, once I did, it just  touched me in a way no that other movie scene ever has.  To people who will  watch this movie for the first time; watch the last scene with all your  attention!  You'll be richly rewarded!  One last thing; WARNING, this  is not a happy movie.  Don't be fooled by critics claiming it's a  &quot;comedy&quot;.  It's an incredibly sad and poignant movie.",5,Subtley Brilliant,963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,1309,"[""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'foreign', 'films', 'decided', 'watch', 'one', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'enraptured', 'quot', 'Sunrise', 'quot', 'was', 'must', 'admit', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'quot', 'what', 'hell', 'quot', 'However', 'more', 'thought', 'what', 'saw', 'more', 'understood', 'lot', 'movie', 'very', 'subtle', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'claiming', 'dark', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'funny', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'single', 'time', 'not', 'point', 'even', 'understanding', 'humor', 'could', 'see', 'raw', 'emotion', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'rave', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'should', 'GREATEST', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'emotional', 'poignant', 'scene', 'HISTORY', 'motion', 'picture', 'had', 'rewind', 'tape', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Delpy', 'quot', 'sign', 'language', 'quot', 'first', 'time', 'However', 'once', 'did', 'just', 'touched', 'way', 'other', 'movie', 'scene', 'ever', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'last', 'scene', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'be', 'richly', 'rewarded', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'WARNING', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'critics', 'claiming', 'quot', 'comedy', 'quot', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'poignant', 'movie']",White VHS
