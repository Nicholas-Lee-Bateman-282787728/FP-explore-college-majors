715868,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00006HAWU,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[53, 57]","""Faithless"" is a film that explores love, infidelity, guilt, pain, and humanity. The film was written by world-renowned director, Ingmar Bergman, and directed by Liv Ullman, an accomplished Swedish actress who is also Bergman's former wife.The film begins with an old, retired film director named Bergman (Erland Josephson) who summons his muse in order to write a screenplay. At first invisible and reluctant to show herself, Bergman's muse eventually appears as Marianne (Lena Endre) his former wife. Marianne slowly discusses her previous marriage to a famous composer, Markus (Thomas Hanzon), and the subsequent events that resulted in her leaving him for his friend and artistic collaborator, David (Krister Hendriksson) who is also the younger Bergman. The conversation takes place over several days in Bergman's seaside house and assumes the form of flashbacks. The story is not a happy one, and exploring it is clearly a painful experience for Marianne, and for Bergman who for, perhaps the first time, is able to empathize with her and is able to view his own role from the perspective of detached wisdom and sorrow.Faithless remains a penetrating and honest psychological exploration from start to finish and closely resembles Bergman's earlier films in style and temperament (although this one is directed by Liv Ullman). This film contains its share of difficulties, but if viewers, especially American viewers can get past them they will find it enormously rewarding. Some of the difficulties of this film are:LENGTH""Faithless is ""142"" minutes of largely dialog with subtitles. Even if you're into idea-oriented films, it takes a lot of commitment and stamina to pay close attention to this one.STYLEThis film is almost like a cinematic play. The plot unfolds almost completely through dialog. While it has its share of symbols and devices, they are very restrained. There is no slick action, or special affects, and there are no obvious heroes or villains.SUBTLETYBergman and Ullman are not trying to pound blunt ideas into our heads with obvious characters and a simple plot. Many of the ideas in this film are subtle and even paradoxical. It raises many disturbing questions and provides practically no obvious answers. One thing that might help is to think of this film as an exploration, or an important conversation that we get to overhear, but not as a product designed to gratify and amuse us (that's what ""Star Wars"" is for).The powerful and rewarding thing about ""Faithless"" is that it relentlessly explores universal emotional and psychological truths that apply to all of us. Many of the terrible things we do in life have no concrete material or circumstantial justification but they do have a powerful emotional one that is almost impossible to explain. Marianne has no immediate justification for leaving Markus, who is a good husband and who pleases her in bed. Yet at the same time she feels no choice but to succumb to the emotional change that slowly and inexorably draws her to David. One day she simply sees him as a different person altogether, and her life takes on a drastic new momentum.If you can accept the lengthy, conversational nature of this film and are not phased by the parts of it that may seem incomprehensible or alienating, you will recognize yourself in much of it. It is unlikely that the characters, all leading members of Swedish artistic circles, resemble any of us. But we will see bits of ourselves in their emotions, their actions, and in their struggle to explain the incompressible workings of the human soul. Stick it out and see it twice if you can.

Also, it is flawed in that the old man who the story is told to never surprises us by having a role where he himself was involved in those events when he was younger. The narrative points where the actress comes back to the room to describe the next part of her story gets monotonous and very difficult to finish.

715871,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B00006HAWU,Kerry Walters,"[3, 3]","Throughout his career, Bergman resisted ending his films with pat resolutions that tied up all loose ends.  They almost always end ambiguously, darkly but with a hint of fragile hope.In ""Faithless,"" written by Bergman and directed by Liv Ullmann, this pattern continues.  Confessional as are all his movies, ""Faithless"" is a merciless self-examination on Bergman's part of his numerous past infidelities and the pain they caused to both himself and others.  In an astoundingly insightful move, Bergman structures the film as a memory.  The aged dramatist (Erland Josephson) invokes his ""muse,"" the memory of a past lover named Marianne (played by Lena Endre), and she retells the story of her adulterous involvement with the young dramatist (played by Krister Herriksson).  The scenes switch between Lena speaking directly to the old dramatist in his study and dramatizations of the story Lena is telling--perhaps the play the old dramatist himself is writing (that's just how wonderfully multi-layered the script is).Both the script and the acting are so powerful that the film--really more theatrical than cinema, one of Bergman's famous ""chamber pieces""--at times is almost too painful to watch.  Endre's range of emotions is astounding--giddy love, crushing guilt, maternal despair.  Erland Josephson, the veteran Bergman ensemble actor, actually has very few lines.  But his facial expressions as he listens to his muse communicate perfectly the character's guilt, nostalgia, and need to find some kind of closure on his past.  Herriksson as the young dramatist is a pathetic neurotic who preys on women--as damning a self-portrait as Bergman ever wrote.Ullmann's directing style is in the classic Bergman mode:  focus on faces, long silences, spartan sets.  And the film ends as it must:  the old dramatist, after remembering and reliving the details of the past infidelity, is shown walking by himself on a solitary beach.  Has he reached closure, or is he still haunted by the past?  There's really no indication one way or the other, probably because the question offers too simple an either-or.  Life is ambiguous.",5,"As in film, so in life...",1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2124,"['career', 'Bergman', 'resisted', 'ending', 'films', 'pat', 'resolutions', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'almost', 'always', 'end', 'ambiguously', 'darkly', 'hint', 'fragile', 'hope.In', 'Faithless', 'written', 'Bergman', 'directed', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'pattern', 'Confessional', 'are', 'movies', 'Faithless', 'merciless', 'self-examination', 'Bergman', 'part', 'numerous', 'past', 'infidelities', 'pain', 'caused', 'others', 'astoundingly', 'insightful', 'move', 'Bergman', 'film', 'memory', 'aged', 'dramatist', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'muse', 'memory', 'past', 'lover', 'named', 'Marianne', 'played', 'Lena', 'Endre', 'story', 'adulterous', 'involvement', 'young', 'dramatist', 'played', 'Krister', 'Herriksson', 'scenes', 'switch', 'Lena', 'speaking', 'directly', 'old', 'dramatist', 'study', 'dramatizations', 'story', 'Lena', 'telling', 'perhaps', 'play', 'old', 'dramatist', 'writing', 'just', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'multi-layered', 'script', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'theatrical', 'cinema', 'one', 'Bergman', 'famous', 'chamber', 'pieces', 'times', 'almost', 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'Endre', 'range', 'emotions', 'astounding', 'giddy', 'love', 'crushing', 'guilt', 'maternal', 'despair', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'veteran', 'Bergman', 'ensemble', 'actor', 'actually', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'facial', 'expressions', 'muse', 'communicate', 'perfectly', 'character', 'guilt', 'nostalgia', 'need', 'find', 'kind', 'closure', 'past', 'Herriksson', 'young', 'dramatist', 'pathetic', 'neurotic', 'who', 'preys', 'women', 'damning', 'self-portrait', 'Bergman', 'ever', 'wrote.Ullmann', 'directing', 'style', 'classic', 'Bergman', 'mode', 'focus', 'long', 'silences', 'spartan', 'sets', 'film', 'must', 'old', 'dramatist', 'remembering', 'reliving', 'details', 'past', 'infidelity', 'shown', 'walking', 'solitary', 'beach', 'reached', 'closure', 'still', 'haunted', 'past', 'really', 'indication', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'probably', 'question', 'too', 'simple', 'either-or', 'Life', 'ambiguous']",N/A

715873,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B00006HAWU,S. Spilka,"[2, 2]","Some viewers complained that the movie is boring. I was so mesmerized by it that although I caught it on one of my Fio channels at 1:00 a.m., I had to watch it to the end, at 3:30 a.m. This is one of the most compelling of Bergman's scripts. Although he had often dealt with remorse before, I don't remember him focusing with such intensity on a young girl--Marianne's daughter--the innocent victim of her mother's faithlessness. Whenever Marianne remembers how she wrecked her daughter's life through her reckless affair with the director Bergman, her anguish is so searing and visceral that it seems the world has just stopped breathing. It is here that Lena Endre's riveting performance transcends even its excellent self, reaching a spiritual depth (or is it height?) that holds us captive in her and our own humanity. The wages of sin is a cliche that doesn't begin to unpack the poignancy of the mother's regret, always mixed with a devilish sense of irresponsibility which sweeps her along to further exploits of adultery. She is helplessly trapped in her affair while her daughter is left alone and irreparably damaged.  It is the painful rift between mother and daughter that gives this drama its profound tragic sense, akin to the relentless familial devastations of Greek tragedy.Bergman's script surprises not only in its insight into a mother-daughter relationship, but also in its articulation of a woman's emotional world. As far as I can remember, no other work of his puts the woman's inner world front and center and explores it with lucidity, detail, and eloquence. The only question I have for Bergman--wherever he is now--concerns his view of infidelity as human fate, sealed within our human DNA. There is no Bergman without betrayal. Moreover, his betraying husbands and wives commit their betrayals almost thoughtlessly. Yes, they are often portrayed in anguished and tragic conflicts, but these conflicts kick in after the betrayal, not before. Although in our cynical culture many view adultery as trivial, I do not and neither does Bergman, but he doesn't explain it. Was she unhappy with her husband? Was she ""addicted"" to her lover? Was she attracted to ""sin"" and the inevitable suffering it brings? Betraying a husband or a wife seems to me the mother of all betrayals, and I usually want to know why people deceive their loved ones. However, I am certainly not going to get the answer from Bergman who sees betrayal as a given, an essential human element, inseparable from love.Ullman's direction is wonderful! It illuminates this script from within and adds warmth and color to the typically bare Bergman's setting. It furthermore rounds Bergman's harsh corners without sacrificing depth or intensity.  The wind-shaped trees are so fine! And so is every piece of furniture in that room, especially the window sill where Marianne starts her astonishing story. The old director's mostly wordless reactions to Marianne's story are as artistically accomplished and moving as her shimmering verbal waterfalls. The two are  thirstily drinking each other's utterances, whether in silence or in speech, for the intimate understanding and reckoning which had heretofore escaped them.This is a masterpiece, any way you look at it.",5,Penetrating exploration of feelings,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,3252,"['viewers', 'complained', 'movie', 'boring', 'was', 'so', 'mesmerized', 'caught', 'one', 'Fio', 'channels', '1:00', 'a.m.', 'had', 'watch', 'end', '3:30', 'a.m', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'Bergman', 'scripts', 'had', 'often', 'dealt', 'remorse', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'focusing', 'such', 'intensity', 'young', 'girl', 'Marianne', 'daughter', 'innocent', 'victim', 'mother', 'faithlessness', 'Whenever', 'Marianne', 'how', 'wrecked', 'daughter', 'life', 'reckless', 'affair', 'director', 'Bergman', 'anguish', 'so', 'searing', 'visceral', 'world', 'just', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'here', 'Lena', 'Endre', 'riveting', 'performance', 'transcends', 'even', 'excellent', 'self', 'reaching', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'height', 'captive', 'own', 'humanity', 'wages', 'sin', 'cliche', ""n't"", 'begin', 'unpack', 'poignancy', 'mother', 'regret', 'always', 'mixed', 'devilish', 'sense', 'irresponsibility', 'along', 'further', 'exploits', 'adultery', 'helplessly', 'trapped', 'affair', 'daughter', 'left', 'alone', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'painful', 'rift', 'mother', 'daughter', 'drama', 'profound', 'tragic', 'sense', 'akin', 'relentless', 'familial', 'devastations', 'Greek', 'tragedy.Bergman', 'script', 'not', 'only', 'insight', 'mother-daughter', 'relationship', 'also', 'articulation', 'woman', 'emotional', 'world', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'other', 'work', 'woman', 'inner', 'world', 'front', 'center', 'lucidity', 'detail', 'eloquence', 'only', 'question', 'have', 'Bergman', 'wherever', 'now', 'concerns', 'view', 'infidelity', 'human', 'fate', 'sealed', 'human', 'DNA', 'Bergman', 'betrayal', 'Moreover', 'betraying', 'husbands', 'wives', 'commit', 'betrayals', 'almost', 'thoughtlessly', 'Yes', 'are', 'often', 'portrayed', 'anguished', 'tragic', 'conflicts', 'conflicts', 'kick', 'betrayal', 'not', 'before', 'cynical', 'culture', 'many', 'view', 'adultery', 'trivial', 'do', 'not', 'neither', 'Bergman', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Was', 'unhappy', 'husband', 'Was', 'addicted', 'lover', 'Was', 'attracted', 'sin', 'inevitable', 'suffering', 'Betraying', 'husband', 'wife', 'mother', 'betrayals', 'usually', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'people', 'deceive', 'loved', 'ones', 'However', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'answer', 'Bergman', 'who', 'betrayal', 'given', 'essential', 'human', 'element', 'inseparable', 'love.Ullman', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'script', 'warmth', 'color', 'typically', 'bare', 'Bergman', 'setting', 'furthermore', 'Bergman', 'harsh', 'corners', 'sacrificing', 'depth', 'intensity', 'wind-shaped', 'trees', 'are', 'so', 'fine', 'so', 'piece', 'furniture', 'room', 'especially', 'window', 'sill', 'where', 'Marianne', 'astonishing', 'story', 'old', 'director', 'mostly', 'wordless', 'reactions', 'Marianne', 'story', 'are', 'artistically', 'accomplished', 'moving', 'shimmering', 'verbal', 'waterfalls', 'two', 'are', 'thirstily', 'drinking', 'other', 'utterances', 'silence', 'speech', 'intimate', 'understanding', 'reckoning', 'had', 'heretofore', 'escaped', 'them.This', 'masterpiece', 'way', 'look']",N/A
