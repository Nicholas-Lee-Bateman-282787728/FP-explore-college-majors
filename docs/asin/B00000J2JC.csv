505582,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,B00000J2JC,"Bonnie Sayers ""autismfamily""","[4, 7]","This video is a composite of three stories that make up seventy minutes. This starts off with many coming attractions for theatre (February 2000) and video, so they are kind of old now and we usually fast forward through them.The difference with Winnie The Pooh - Seasons of Giving and the other collections is the stories go together, when one ends it leads into the next making it flow smoother. There are five new songs brought to this video that are delightful to hear year round.The movie begins with Tigger, Piglet and Pooh on a windy day trying to figure out if it is winter yet. They head to Rabbit's house since he has a calendar, but they are all unaware that pages flew off the calendar making it seem like Groundhog's Day. The gang wants to make sure there is no more winter so they go in search of a Groundhog. Gopher is not up for this task so Piglet is recruited, but cannot see a thing because his hat is over his head. No one else knows that and assumes since he cannot see he means no shadow, so winter is over.Everyone now goes to their home for their spring-cleaning and wake up to mounds of snow. Rabbit is upset and storms over to Piglet's house to protest on his Groundhog duties. Piglet is sad when Rabbit leaves so off he goes to find a real Groundhog. A lot of silliness happens with Rabbit thinking Piglet melted in the snow and Rabbit finds the missing calendar pages alerting his friends that it is only November.Here is the opening line for the next story when Tigger announces he must get his hot chocolatey ice cream ready for Thanksgiving. Now it is Thanksgiving day with all the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood bringing their favorites to a table set up for their Thanksgiving dinner. When Rabbit arrives it all changes when he informs them Thanksgiving is all about Tradition.They are all glad to have learned this and ask Rabbit what they can do. It just so happens Rabbit came with a list of chores for each to do in preparation of their Thanksgiving Feast.You have to wonder why Rabbit would send Pooh and Piglet to get a turkey and not do it himself, but he is in charge of decorations leaving Owl for china and Gopher for pie. Eeyore and Tigger are paired up to hunt berries but get stuck in a trap Pooh and Piglet make to catch a turkey.When they all get back to the table around noon disaster strikes and everything is ruined so the dinner is called off. While sitting at home eating his honey Pooh decides he should share what little he has and heads over to Piglet's House. They all gather again with their favorites they made earlier to the table in the Hundred Acre Wood. They all go to Rabbit's house asking him to come to the Thanksgiving Feast and they enjoy themselves.Next a note arrives from Kessie so Roo asks who that is which leads into the repeated story of how they rescued the bird one winter. Rabbit took care of Kessie, read to her and taught her about gardening. Rabbit was not happy when Owl started teaching Kessie to fly so she could go south for the winter. It is apparent that Rabbit has fond feelings for Kessie and does not want to see her get hurt. The rest of his friends are eager to assist in learning to fly, which makes Rabbit upset.After Kessie leaves Piglet is asking Pooh why Rabbit did not like Kessie, so Pooh explains to Piglet that sometimes people care too much, I think it is called Love. Then Piglet is surprised to hear this and wants to see if Rabbit knows about this, but they show Rabbit alone on the hill saddened by Kessie's departure. Pooh tells Piglet that Rabbit already knows and this is the end of the story to Rue on how Rabbit saved Kessie.This leads into the story of decorating the Christmas tree. Christopher Robbin is in the story as well and they all work together until Rabbit realizes they forgot a star for the top of the tree. They look into the sky thinking they see a falling star but it turns out to be Kessie wishing Rabbit a Merry Christmas. Piglet states that Rabbit did get his wish after all.My almost five-year old watches this video over and over again no matter what the time of year is. He likes to dance around when the songs are playing and I know most of the words to the songs by heart. This video will show how the friends make their holidays brighter by sharing stories and favorites for their meal.They learn to overcome their defeats and continue with new traditions while enjoying the season. This is a video that is great to watch any time of the year but especially when fall starts and you might be waiting for winter to arrive.",3,Every season there is a reason to be thankful,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,4561,"['video', 'composite', 'three', 'stories', 'make', 'up', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'off', 'many', 'coming', 'attractions', 'theatre', 'February', '2000', 'video', 'are', 'kind', 'old', 'now', 'usually', 'fast', 'forward', 'them.The', 'difference', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Seasons', 'Giving', 'other', 'collections', 'stories', 'go', 'together', 'when', 'one', 'next', 'making', 'smoother', 'are', 'five', 'new', 'songs', 'brought', 'video', 'are', 'delightful', 'hear', 'year', 'round.The', 'movie', 'Tigger', 'Piglet', 'Pooh', 'windy', 'day', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'winter', 'yet', 'head', 'Rabbit', 'house', 'calendar', 'are', 'unaware', 'pages', 'flew', 'calendar', 'making', 'seem', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'gang', 'make', 'sure', 'more', 'winter', 'go', 'search', 'Groundhog', 'Gopher', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'so', 'Piglet', 'recruited', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'thing', 'hat', 'head', 'one', 'else', 'assumes', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'shadow', 'so', 'winter', 'over.Everyone', 'now', 'home', 'spring-cleaning', 'wake', 'up', 'mounds', 'snow', 'Rabbit', 'upset', 'storms', 'Piglet', 'house', 'protest', 'Groundhog', 'duties', 'Piglet', 'sad', 'when', 'Rabbit', 'so', 'find', 'real', 'Groundhog', 'lot', 'silliness', 'happens', 'Rabbit', 'thinking', 'Piglet', 'melted', 'snow', 'Rabbit', 'missing', 'calendar', 'pages', 'alerting', 'friends', 'only', 'November.Here', 'opening', 'line', 'next', 'story', 'when', 'Tigger', 'must', 'get', 'hot', 'chocolatey', 'ice', 'cream', 'ready', 'Thanksgiving', 'Now', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'residents', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'bringing', 'favorites', 'table', 'set', 'up', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'When', 'Rabbit', 'changes', 'when', 'Thanksgiving', 'Tradition.They', 'are', 'glad', 'have', 'learned', 'ask', 'Rabbit', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'Rabbit', 'came', 'list', 'chores', 'do', 'preparation', 'Thanksgiving', 'Feast.You', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Rabbit', 'would', 'send', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'get', 'turkey', 'not', 'do', 'charge', 'decorations', 'leaving', 'Owl', 'china', 'Gopher', 'pie', 'Eeyore', 'Tigger', 'are', 'paired', 'up', 'hunt', 'berries', 'get', 'stuck', 'trap', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'make', 'catch', 'turkey.When', 'get', 'back', 'table', 'noon', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'everything', 'ruined', 'so', 'dinner', 'called', 'off', 'sitting', 'home', 'eating', 'honey', 'Pooh', 'should', 'share', 'what', 'heads', 'Piglet', 'House', 'gather', 'again', 'favorites', 'made', 'earlier', 'table', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'go', 'Rabbit', 'house', 'asking', 'come', 'Thanksgiving', 'Feast', 'enjoy', 'note', 'Kessie', 'so', 'Roo', 'asks', 'who', 'repeated', 'story', 'how', 'rescued', 'bird', 'one', 'winter', 'Rabbit', 'took', 'care', 'Kessie', 'read', 'taught', 'gardening', 'Rabbit', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'when', 'Owl', 'started', 'teaching', 'Kessie', 'fly', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'south', 'winter', 'apparent', 'Rabbit', 'fond', 'feelings', 'Kessie', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'hurt', 'rest', 'friends', 'are', 'eager', 'assist', 'learning', 'fly', 'Rabbit', 'upset.After', 'Kessie', 'Piglet', 'asking', 'Pooh', 'why', 'Rabbit', 'did', 'not', 'Kessie', 'so', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'sometimes', 'people', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'called', 'Love', 'Then', 'Piglet', 'surprised', 'hear', 'see', 'Rabbit', 'show', 'Rabbit', 'alone', 'hill', 'saddened', 'Kessie', 'departure', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'Rabbit', 'already', 'end', 'story', 'Rue', 'how', 'Rabbit', 'saved', 'Kessie.This', 'story', 'decorating', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Christopher', 'Robbin', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'together', 'Rabbit', 'forgot', 'star', 'top', 'tree', 'look', 'sky', 'thinking', 'see', 'falling', 'star', 'out', 'be', 'Kessie', 'wishing', 'Rabbit', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'Piglet', 'Rabbit', 'did', 'get', 'wish', 'all.My', 'almost', 'five-year', 'old', 'watches', 'video', 'over', 'again', 'matter', 'what', 'time', 'year', 'dance', 'around', 'when', 'songs', 'are', 'playing', 'know', 'most', 'words', 'songs', 'heart', 'video', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'friends', 'make', 'holidays', 'brighter', 'sharing', 'stories', 'favorites', 'meal.They', 'learn', 'overcome', 'defeats', 'continue', 'new', 'traditions', 'enjoying', 'season', 'video', 'great', 'watch', 'time', 'year', 'especially', 'when', 'fall', 'might', 'be', 'waiting', 'winter', 'arrive']",Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving VHS

505587,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00000J2JC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","Since 1926, ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" has been a staple in American pop culture as a family friendly character and stories that many children for generations have grown up with.  And adults who have continued to share that with their own children.With the holiday season coming up soon, the 10th Anniversary Edition of the third direct-to-video Winnie the Pooh animated feature ""Seasons of Giving"" from 1999 is re-released on DVD (note: the original DVD was released back in 2003) and comes with a mini Christmas stocking.This feature revolves around Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit and friends celebrating Thanksgiving, Christmas and the winter season!""Seasons of Giving"" is broken down into several arcs.  The first arc is ""Groundpiglet Day"" (from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"") as Rabbit and the group think the day is February 2nd, Groundhog Day (when actually, the calendar hasn't been changed) and thus they feel as they missed out on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  So, in order to find out if there will be a cold front, they look at Piglet to be a groundhog and determine if Spring is coming soon.The second arc features Winnie the Pooh inviting Christopher Robbin to join the group at Hundred Acre Wood and hoping for a fantastic Thanksgiving.  This segment is from an actual special.The third arc features the group celebrating Christmas and Rabbit receiving a Christmas card from Kessie, a blue bird that rabbit rescued years ago.  With Roo wondering who is Kessie is, Rabbit tells his story of how he met Tessie (replaying the cartoon ""Find her, Keep Her"" from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"").VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is featured in Widescreen (1:33:1) and for the most part, animation differs at times as some animation is from the TV series, another from a special.  For the most part, the animation is from 1999 and the transfer shows its age a little and there are some dust and scratches on ""groundpiglet day"" while ""A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving"" features a more cleaner animation.  And for the Christmas episode, the animation seems much more cleaner and vibrant but when Rabbit reminiscences of Tessie, then it goes back to older animation.  You can tell which is the older animation as Rabbit is greyish, while in the newer animation he is yellow.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound and is featured in English, French and Spanish language tracks.  Audio is dialogue and music driven and for the most part is clear and understandable.  For home theater owners, I felt that the best setting was to have audio set at stereo on all channels.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with a small Christmas stocking included in the slipcase.  As for special features, the following is included:JUDGMENT CALL:* The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Earmuffs - (11:09) Piglet doesn't take part in the winter games because he feels he can't skate.  But when Christopher Robbin gives him his ear muffs, Piglet thinks he can now ice skate.* The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - The Wishing Bear - (22:42) Christopher Robbin teaches Winnie the Pooh how to wish upon a star.  When he does...he believes his wish to get honey comes true. Now, he wants to teach the others how to wish but unfortunately, it seems Pooh has forgotten what Christopher had taught him.* Decorate Your Own Christmas Tree - Using your remote, you can  decorate different Christmas trees* Coloring with Piglet - Using your remote, you can play a game of memorization and try to color up to three pictures with the correct color.Just in time for the holidays, ""Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving"" is released on DVD.  I have pretty much grown up with ""Winnie the Pooh"" and the Christmas shows have always been a yearly ritual of watching and to say the least, my VHS tape is no longer watchable and with a six-year-old, I have been waiting for a DVD release of this title.If there was one thing that may be difficult for some people is the different styles of animation between the segments from the animated television series ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and the special.  As you go from not so good picture quality, to very good picture quality, to even better picture quality and back to not so good picture quality. In other words, newer animation versus older animation, you get a mix of both.So, for those who are looking for the quality of an animation such as ""Pooh's Heffalump Halloween"" (released in 2005, re-released this month) which has cleaner animation, your not going to get that consistency as the TV episodes from 1999 are mixed with the special.With that being said, despite the animation inconsistency, the only one who will probably be bothered are mostly the adults.  Frankly, children are probably not going to balk at it and for the most part, this is a family feature that will entertain the kids during the holiday season.Overall, my six-year-old son enjoyed watching this feature and I can imagine that it's lighthearted, fun and heartwarming stories will also entertain other children as well.  Also, you get two more cartoons as from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" included on this DVD, two interactive games plus a mini-Christmas stocking.  So, overall...this is a solid release.For its low price and for its holiday entertainment factor, ""Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is definitely recommended!",4,"Still has the varying animation quality but overall, an enjoyable family, holiday DVD that comes with a mini-stocking!",1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,5497,"['1926', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'been', 'staple',

While searching for Winter, the four friends begin a wild search to find the perfect ingredients for the greatest Thanksgiving feast, which eventually leads to the Christmas holidays, and a surprise visit from a very special friend.In the first story, GROUNDPIGLET DAY, we meet up with the gang from the Hundred Acre Wood, as they ring in Spring.The second story, starring Rabbit, A WINNIE THE POOH THANKSGIVING, we find the beloved Rabbit rushing about, which ultimately defeats the true meaning of the holiday season all together.The third, and final story, again starring Rabbit, FIND HER, KEEP HER, features Rabbit showing his soft, and caring side, instead of his often grumpy side, when he finds, and adopts a wayward baby bird.Featuring gorgeous animation, five brand new songs on this straight-to-video release, and everyone's favorite characters, Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, Piglet, Owl, Rabbit, Beaver, Roo, Kanga, and Christopher Robin, this film is sure to be a pleaser for the entire family to gather around the TV, and watch during this enchanting season.

505595,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00000J2JC,Monty Moonlight,"[41, 42]","If you are looking for big budget Winnie the Pooh entertainment, you have two choices. First there are the original classics, available seperately on VHS, or together in both VHS and DVD under the title: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Second choice is their more recent theatrical feature, The Tigger Movie. Both are WONDERFUL films! Anything else you get however, at the time of this review that is, is going to be much lower quality, made for TV stuff.What we have here is not truthfully a NEW feature. There's been a lot of false advertising by the direct to video market about NEW Disney features. This, as was the case with Hercules:Zero to Hero, and some others, is really just a compilation of TV series episodes, linked together with some badly done new footage.So how can I give this video 5 stars you ask? Well, the second story is reason enough! But I'm getting ahead of myself. This video links 3 stories. The first is an average episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series, originally entitled &quot;Groundpiglet's Day,&quot; in which the Hundred Acre Wood family gets rather confused, thinking that Winter is over when in fact, it's just about to start. This, like most episodes of the TV series, is a charming little story, though nothing spectacular. The second story is what makes this film so wonderful. This is not actually an episode of the TV series, but a Holiday Special originally called, A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving. It's a wonderful story with great songs and higher quality animation than you'll see in the rest of the video. As I said before, this story is enough to earn the video 5 stars. After that one, we see the Pooh characters preparing for Christmas. This part is a little hard to watch, because the voices sound nothing like those in the other segments, but there is little continuity throughout this video anyway, considering it has so many different sources. Here we find Rabbit telling the story of how he came to raise a baby bird named Kessie. The original name for the episode this leads into is &quot;Find Her, Keep Her,&quot; a very popular and touching episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. So popular in fact, that Kessie had a sequel episode, and ended up a regular character in the more recent series, The Book of Pooh.The final comment: If you like the TV show, or if you liked the Thanksgiving special, get this video, it's great if you know what to expect!",5,"Once again, with direct to video movies, Get the Facts first",1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2447,"['are', 'looking', 'big', 'budget', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'entertainment', 'have', 'two', 'choices', 'First', 'are', 'original', 'classics', 'available', 'seperately', 'VHS', 'together', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'title', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Second', 'choice', 'more', 'recent', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'Tigger', 'Movie', 'are', 'WONDERFUL', 'films', 'Anything', 'else', 'get', 'however', 'time', 'review', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'lower', 'quality', 'made', 'TV', 'stuff.What', 'have', 'here', 'not', 'truthfully', 'NEW', 'feature', 'been', 'lot', 'false', 'advertising', 'direct', 'video', 'market', 'NEW', 'Disney', 'was', 'case', 'Hercules', 'Zero', 'Hero', 'others', 'really', 'just', 'compilation', 'TV', 'series', 'episodes', 'linked', 'together', 'badly', 'done', 'new', 'footage.So', 'how', 'can', 'give', 'video', '5', 'stars', 'ask', 'Well', 'second', 'story', 'reason', 'enough', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'video', '3', 'stories', 'first', 'average', 'episode', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'TV', 'series', 'originally', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Groundpiglet', 'Day', 'quot', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'family', 'rather', 'confused', 'thinking', 'Winter', 'over', 'when', 'fact', 'just', 'about', 'start', 'most', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'charming', 'little', 'story', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'second', 'story', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'wonderful', 'not', 'actually', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'Holiday', 'Special', 'originally', 'called', 'A', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Thanksgiving', 'wonderful', 'story', 'great', 'songs', 'higher', 'quality', 'animation', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rest', 'video', 'said', 'before', 'story', 'enough', 'earn', 'video', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'see', 'Pooh', 'characters', 'preparing', 'Christmas', 'part', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'voices', 'sound', 'nothing', 'other', 'segments', 'little', 'continuity', 'video', 'anyway', 'considering', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'sources', 'Here', 'find', 'Rabbit', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'raise', 'baby', 'bird', 'named', 'Kessie', 'original', 'name', 'episode', 'quot', 'Find', 'Her', 'Keep', 'Her', 'quot', 'very', 'popular', 'touching', 'episode', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'So', 'popular', 'fact', 'Kessie', 'had', 'sequel', 'episode', 'ended', 'up', 'regular', 'character', 'more', 'recent', 'series', 'Book', 'Pooh.The', 'final', 'comment', 'like', 'TV', 'show', 'liked', 'Thanksgiving', 'special', 'get', 'video', 'great', 'know', 'what', 'expect']",Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving VHS
