I saw this on sale at Pamida and got it for my then 3 yr old daughter. There was SOMETHING about the voices that I couldn't quite put my finger on ... Gusty's voice is the same as Bart Simpsons, Cupcake is Martin Prince, Honeysuckle is Sherrie, Morning Glory is Terry. It is kind of eerie watching the student body from Springfield Elementary as pink ponies.That being said, as an adult, a few parts are truly annoying (conversations between Morning Glory and Sting) and I had trouble sitting through. The only part that I really have a problem with as a parent is Megan playing Matador to distract an angry bull. We have livestock and we've spent the last several years ingraining our daughter with the message ""Don't go in the corral with bulls, stallions, rams or buck goats"" so I cringe every time I watch that part as non-farm kids think that they can play matador with dangerous intact bulls. But my daughter now age 5 loves it and I'm adding more MLP stuff to her collection.",3,Do not watch if you a fan of The Simpsons,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,1099,"['Really', 'grew', 'up', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'got', 'older', 'MLIP', 'went', 'air', 'began', 'watch', 'Simpsons', 'saw', 'sale', 'Pamida', 'got', 'then', '3', 'yr', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'SOMETHING', 'voices', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'Gusty', 'voice', 'same', 'Bart', 'Simpsons', 'Cupcake', 'Martin', 'Prince', 'Honeysuckle', 'Sherrie', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'Terry', 'kind', 'eerie', 'watching', 'student', 'body', 'Springfield', 'Elementary', 'pink', 'being', 'said', 'adult', 'few', 'parts', 'are', 'truly', 'annoying', 'conversations', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'Sting', 'had', 'trouble', 'sitting', 'only', 'part', 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'parent', 'Megan', 'playing', 'Matador', 'distract', 'angry', 'bull', 'have', 'livestock', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'ingraining', 'daughter', 'message', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'corral', 'bulls', 'stallions', 'rams', 'buck', 'goats', 'so', 'cringe', 'time', 'watch', 'part', 'non-farm', 'kids', 'think', 'can', 'play', 'matador', 'dangerous', 'intact', 'bulls', 'daughter', 'now', 'age', '5', ""'m"", 'adding', 'more', 'MLP', 'stuff', 'collection']",N/A

925258,A36MU91XEQNRO,B000AAP7LC,Mary,"[10, 16]","You can't beat My Little Pony.  It's pretty much the best series ever for little girls.  It is TRUE that this DVD is part of the Season 1 DVD, but if you are just looking for a good DVD to give to your two-six year old daughters, look no more!  This has everything - good vs. evil, singing, and magic.  The plot is GREAT for anyone with half a mind!  The Little Ponies have to rescue the Sunstone from Bumble (Who has stolen it from the Flutter Ponies) before Flutter Valley becomes a wasteland.  In their struggle to defeat the Witches the Ponies learn about friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and sharing.  They learn that good will always triumph over evil in the end.  The Ponies are bright and beautiful, and, unlike most children's TV programming today, My Little Pony won't treat your kids like they are mindless, weak, retarded zombies.That said, if your kid seriously gets scared from watching My Little Pony there is a serious problem in the home.  I watched this series as young as two years old and had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever! That's the problem in America.  We are raising a generation of weak-ass wimps.  It's almost like Cobra Commander really did take over the TV stations (remember that episode of GI Joe people?).If you want some ""Educational"" bull crap for your kids to watch, don't buy this DVD.  We wouldn't want them to grow up to be able to think.  If you want weak-ass kids, keep them tuned onto Nick Jr. or the Little Einsteins and don't even bother tainting the good name of My Little Pony.If you want your kids to have creativity and imagination, (which, I might add, is what stimulates intelligence) then buy this DVD for your daughter and let her enjoy!  Not everything has to be educational, in fact, it's good for kids to just have fun and use their imagination! If you are a person who doesn't want your child to ever be exposed to anything ""evil"", just save your money.  Poor kid.I'd bet ten to one that these negative reviews about ""OMG my daughter heard numb-skull!"" etc... are from Christians.

I LOVE My Little Pony, no doubts there. However, I found this particular story kind of boring. It wasn't bad, it just felt out of place and was kind of silly. The original piolet special and ""Escape From Catrina"" were excellent, however I was really bored trying to watch this one. The witches were absolutely ridiculous and their voiceovers bothered me more than anything. The bees were stupid (sorry), especially the one they made to look kind of like a biker punk.Sorry, but My Little Pony has a lot better to offer out there.
