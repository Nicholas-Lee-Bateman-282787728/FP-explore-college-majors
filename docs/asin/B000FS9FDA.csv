I like to see how they work the art into the story, he likes to go pat,pat,pat,pat ... blast off!  Also, I am learning more about music, and I think he is too, kind of indirectly.  I downloaded the pieces from Instrument Fairies (Puppet March, etc.) and played them on the car stereo ... and he made the connection ... he shouted Little Einsteins!  I like how they select very distinctive pieces.In more recent Little Einsteins they have the titles of the pieces written next to the composers name.  In this DVD, the characters say the names of the pieces ... and I can't understand what the character is saying for the Bizet piece - Suite L ... No. 2Can anyone tell me the name of that piece?The question of character stereotyping is interesting, and I am sometimes shocked by how much of that one sees in children's ""educational"" entertainment (especially the helpless girls) ... but I have to disagree about Quincy being the ""funny musician.""  He plays the violin, and that really means a lot, being the most difficult musical instrument to play.  If he's funny, I guess he's also really talented.  I didn't realize June was Asian ... if I think about it, I guess I thought she might be Italian or Arab American.Anyway, if anyone can help me out with the title of that Bizet piece, I'd much appreciate it!",5,Titles of the musical pieces please,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,1407,"['3', '1/2-year-old', 'son', 'enjoy', 'Little', 'Einstein', 'DVDs', 'lot', 'Maybe', 'different', 'reasons', 'like', 'see', 'how', 'work', 'art', 'story', 'go', 'pat', 'pat', 'pat', 'pat', 'blast', 'Also', 'am', 'learning', 'more', 'music', 'think', 'too', 'kind', 'indirectly', 'downloaded', 'pieces', 'Instrument', 'Fairies', 'Puppet', 'March', 'etc', 'played', 'car', 'stereo', 'made', 'connection', 'shouted', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'like', 'how', 'select', 'very', 'distinctive', 'pieces.In', 'more', 'recent', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'have', 'titles', 'pieces', 'written', 'next', 'composers', 'name', 'DVD', 'characters', 'say', 'names', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'character', 'saying', 'Bizet', 'piece', 'Suite', 'L', 'No', '2Can', 'anyone', 'tell', 'name', 'piece', 'question', 'character', 'stereotyping', 'interesting', 'am', 'sometimes', 'shocked', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'children', 'educational', 'entertainment', 'especially', 'helpless', 'girls', 'have', 'disagree', 'Quincy', 'being', 'funny', 'musician', 'violin', 'really', 'lot', 'being', 'most', 'difficult', 'musical', 'instrument', 'play', 'funny', 'guess', 'also', 'really', 'talented', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'June', 'was', 'Asian', 'think', 'guess', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'Italian', 'Arab', 'American.Anyway', 'anyone', 'can', 'help', 'out', 'title', 'Bizet', 'piece', ""'d"", 'much', 'appreciate']",N/A

994733,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B000FS9FDA,Traveler,"[3, 7]","As of this writing I can see that I'm a lone dissenter in bashing the Little Einstein series, this DVD specifically.We have this DVD.  I've watched parts of multiple times.  I've also seen multiple episodes of the Magic School Bus.  Einsteins was made by Disney, School Bus by PBS.  What I saw was exactly what I expected - Einsteins is full of fluff that offers a tiny tiny teaspoon of education.  There is no science or logic to any of it.  Sure, it teaches a few musical terms, but how does that help someone learn music?  Knowing the meaning of adagio does not a music education make.One of the episodes on this DVD is about the ""birthday machine.""  If you watch most kids you'll see that they derive excitement and interest about the idea of a machine that makes gifts, balloons etc. for everyone as if it's their birthday any day they want.  This episode really illustrates why I hate this show so much - it appeals to the typical base nature of kids (wanting things) while dressing it up as ""education"" with classical music and a few tidbits about culture or geography.  Most kids are not learning anything about music or culture in that episode. But oh yeah, they're thinking how great it would be to a have a birthday machine.  And this machine makes no sense, as typical of this series.Magic School Bus, on the other hand, is chock full of educational bits.  Every episode, a dozen different things are talked about or depicted.  It's based on fact and science, not made up magical machines that foster greed and want.Disney vs. PBS.  Think about it.I don't care if the kids like Little Einsteins.  Kids like donuts, candy and cake, doesn't mean that's what they need.  Magic School Bus is better.
