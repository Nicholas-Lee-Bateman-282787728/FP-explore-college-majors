41903,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0782011179,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""In Old California"" is a 1942 western starring John Wayne with Binnie Barnes and Albert Dekker, featuring Helen Parrish, Patsy Kelly and Edgar KennedyJohn Wayne (1907-79) was a bankable box office draw at the time. He made more than 100 films by 1942, although most of them had been forgettable B westerns.  Then in 1939 he made ""Stagecoach"" with John Ford, and his career took an upturn.  Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with ""Dark Command"" (1940) directed by Raoul Walsh, and ""Old California"" was just about the last of the B films he would be handed.  Wayne went on to make a series of war movies (e.g.,  ""Flying Tigers"" in 1942, ""The Fighting Seabees""  in 1944, ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"" in 1945) and his classic westerns including ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).FWIW - Wayne was excited about his role as a Pharmacist in this film since this was his father's profession, and he had passed away just a few years earlier. Yet his performance is less than expected, probably due to all the marital problems he was having at the time - his separation had just been announced.Binnie Barnes (1903-98) plays a dance hall girl with a golden heart, who is romanced by evil Albert Decker but in love with Wayne. Barnes was a major star of the 30s, appearing in ""Private Life of Henry VII"" (1933) with Charles Laughton (won the Oscar), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934) with Douglas Fairbanks (his last film role), ""Diamond Jim"" (1935), ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1936) with Randolph Scott and ""3 Musketeers"" (1939) with Don Ameche. Her philosophy was - ""I'm no Sarah Bernhardt. One picture is just like another to me as long as I don't have to be a sweet woman.""Albert Dekker (1905-68) played the bad guy in more than 50 films such as Big Jim Colfax in ""The Killers"" (1946), the evil Dr. Thorkel in ""Dr. Cyclops"" (1940), the evil Dr. Soberin in ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) and the evil railroad man Pat Harrigan in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). Occasionally he played a hero (e.g., ""Wake Island).Patsy Kelly (1910-81) provided comic relief in nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1979, including ""Freaky Friday"" (1976), ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"" (1960), and ""Topper Returns"" (1941).Edgar Kennedy (1890-1948) was a comic foil in more than 400 films between 1911 and 1949, including ""Duck Soup"" (1933), ""Lil Abner"" (1940), and ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945). He was one of the original Keystone Cops and was called ""the king of the slow burn"".William McGann (1893-1977) directs. He had an undistinguished career from 1930 to 1944 directing more than 50 films. ""In Old California"" is the best of his films.The NY Times Bosley Crowther called the film ""plain horse-opera in store-bought clothes"" and bemoaned that ""it stumbles and gets all mixed up in its own plot."" He said - ""If John Wayne and Binnie Barnes weren't in it, it would be down with the usual run of strays.""1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"",  and ""Road to Morocco""All things considered the film is OK. Wayne fans might watch it for nostalgia, but he did so much better work that it seems wasteful to spend time on this film. Both Kennedy and Kelly are OK but they gave such better performances that this film offers nothing special. Decker's villain in this film is among his weakest portrayals, and Binne Barnes looks a little tired.

Turns out John Wayne's father was adruggist, which is why DUKE wanted to play the role.Although hedoes engage in some gunplay, for the most part, DUKE is not the centerof action in this one.

41911,A1DZSBTVCJ883,0782011179,W. Walker,"[1, 2]","Yep, Wayne starts out in both these Republic offerings in a tophat! But, he soon trades them in for more conventional western wear. The DVD is a good quality transfer, with maybe just a momentary sound skip or two in each. No extras in the ""Dakota"" DVD, but a reading commentary included in the ""In Old California ""DVD.In the latter film, Wayne, an easterner pharmacist, arrives in a primitive Sacramento, just before the Gold Rush.(The fact that Sacramento didn't exist, except in the form of Sutter's Fort, before the Gold Rush, seems not to have bothered the script editor).  He chose this script because his father was a pharmacist. Wayne immediately gets on the bad side of the ""boss"" of Sacramento, Britt Dawson, by carrying his longtime girlfriend across a muddy street, despite her initial protests.  By the end of this event, we are pretty sure who she will eventually end up with. Wayne proceeds to become an ever  bigger thorn in Dawson's side and they have occasional altercations. Meanwhile, Wayne and a prim young society lady become engaged for marriage. Lacey keeps dropping hints that she might dump Dawson for Wayne, but the Duke plays dumb, as he doesn't want to further antagonize Dawson.  The story starts getting very fanciful when Wayne is saved from a hanging by a loudmouth who yells ""gold"".  Disgusted with both Dawson and Wayne, Lacey leaves and ends up in a gold camp with a typhoid epidemic. Wayne incredibly convinces fleeing prospectors to turn around and take his medicines to the gold fields(How many wagons does it take to transport a few boxes of medicines?!). Dawson's gang ambushes the wagon train to trade medicines for gold in the miner camps.(The fact that there were no useful medicines or vaccines for typhoid until the 20th century seems to have escaped the attention of the script editor).You can check out the film to see the details of how you know things are going to eventually turn out. The problematic developing relationship between Wayne's sidekick,Edgar Kennedy, and Lacey's maid,Patsy Kelly, while humorous at times, is merely distracting at other times. According to the production notes, ""The Spoilers"", which was made at nearly the same time, has a basically similar plot, involving a gold rush and Wayne caught between a heartless society lady and a dancehall girl with a heart of gold. This is a much better known film, made by another studio, withWayne getting only third billing!In ""Dakota"", many reviewers complain about Vera Ralston's acting. I thought this failed ice skating queen did an OK job playing her role. She is supposed to be the elegant daughter of an immigrant father who struck it rich in railroads. This explains her foreign accent and the fact that she is not like the sexy dancehall girls of Fargo. She is determined to call the shots when it comes to deciding where they will live, both near the beginning  and at the end of the film. When they run away from her disapproving father, Wayne tells her to buy tickets for CA, but she buys tickets for St. Paul. She knows her father's railroad is soon planning to build an extention to Fargo. She hopes to buy land from the farmers cheap and sell it to her father's railroad expensive. The trouble is Ward Bond and gang have the same idea. Bond assumes the railroad is coming to Fargo because he saw their surveyors. He also assumes that Wayne is a land buying agent for the railroad. Bond hammers out a contract with  most of the farmers whereby he gets their land if they can't repay his loan to help harvest and market their crops. He plans to burn their crop, a variation of a similar scene in ""The Westerner"", where the cattlemen are trying to burn out the sod busters. But, Wayne threatens to pressure the railroad to build to Grand Fork rather than Fargo, unless Bond signs over this contract with the farmers to Wayne(and thus presumably the railroad) for a big discount compared to what Bond was planning to sell the contract to the railroad for. Wayne then plans to share the profit with the farmers. But Bond hopes to steal this contract back from a deceased Wayne and delete the bit about Wayne being the new owner of the  contract. Bond then burns the wheat crop. See the movie to find out how things turn out.Walter Brennan plays a goofy old riverboat captain who mostly talks to his boat or himself or shouts at his assistant, Nichodemis. Nick Stewart, as Nickodemis, plays his stock character: a sleepy very slow witted ""darkie"".
