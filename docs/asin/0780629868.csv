37149,AO1TOG5CBJW9I,0780629868,Alucard,"[0, 0]","I rented this movie because It was from the screenwriter of American History X. American History X was one of the deepest, shocking, and terrifyingly relistic movies I've ever seen. I was looking into this film for a bit, but I never did rent it, one night though, I did, and went into it with very high hopes. However, right off at the first five minutes of the film, I could tell that this was not going to be half as good. When the film ended, I was extremely dissapointed. From someone who wrote American History X and went on to write this, I can't believe it. Not only does this film pale in comparision, it's altogether sloppily made, full of shallow situations and undeveloped characters. I still can't believe this screenwriter. American History X was one of those films that stays with the viewer for many days after viewing. This film is so forgetable that I don't even remember the character's names.The movie dosen't exactly start out very smoothly either. In the opening scene, we are shown a girl's aftermath after she got raped. The movie then abandons this for the next 45 minutes and goes to the night before, breifly introducing the characters. When I say breifly, I mean it. We only get segments of each of the characters here, there is barely, if any character development. American History X built up it's characters extremely well. Here, there is pretty much nothing behind any of the characters. We only get to hear their inane comments about sex, and that's about it.The movie then shows the characters going to a club. There's about four girls, four guys, etc. They all meet, seem to know each other, and one of the girls goes with the craziest guy, and (gasp!) she gets raped. However, the film drags so much and barely gets into any of the characters, that it doesn't even give a sense of reality to the viewer. You can't feel sorry for undeveloped characters. The movie then goes on to a he said she said portrayal, leaving the viewer to want to turn the movie off.I still can't believe this is from the screenwriter of American History X. The fact that this is his follow up to it is so underwhelming, that it's unbelieved. He even knows he's running into trouble with the script, so he puts in things to try and keep the viewer's attention. He includes a fist fight between one of the characters and a bouncer over a pushing dispute, and he even includes unneeded sex scenes including handcuffs and other various &quot;tie ups&quot;. This feels unneeded and only bogs the pace of the film from actually having a main plot. The end result is a bunch of segments not leading to anything at all. Just a waste of time and a disapointed viewer.This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, so i'll give it two stars, however, it is probaly the most underwhelming movie i've ever seen. From a really promsing screenwriter too, it's such a shame..........",2,Empty and Shallow,1009756800,"12 31, 2001",2001,2876,"['rented', 'movie', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'American', 'History', 'X.', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'was', 'one', 'deepest', 'shocking', 'terrifyingly', 'relistic', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'looking', 'film', 'bit', 'never', 'did', 'rent', 'one', 'night', 'did', 'went', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'However', 'right', 'off', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'half', 'good', 'When', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'extremely', 'dissapointed', 'someone', 'who', 'wrote', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'went', 'write', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'pale', 'comparision', 'altogether', 'sloppily', 'made', 'full', 'shallow', 'situations', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'screenwriter', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'viewer', 'many', 'days', 'viewing', 'film', 'so', 'forgetable', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'character', 'names.The', 'movie', 'dose', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'start', 'out', 'very', 'smoothly', 'either', 'opening', 'scene', 'are', 'shown', 'girl', 'aftermath', 'got', 'raped', 'movie', 'then', 'next', '45', 'minutes', 'night', 'breifly', 'introducing', 'characters', 'When', 'say', 'breifly', 'mean', 'only', 'get', 'segments', 'characters', 'here', 'barely', 'character', 'development', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'built', 'characters', 'extremely', 'well', 'Here', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'characters', 'only', 'get', 'hear', 'inane', 'comments', 'sex', 'it.The', 'movie', 'then', 'characters', 'going', 'club', 'four', 'girls', 'four', 'guys', 'etc', 'meet', 'seem', 'know', 'other', 'one', 'girls', 'craziest', 'guy', 'gasp', 'raped', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'barely', 'characters', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'sense', 'reality', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'movie', 'then', 'said', 'said', 'portrayal', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'want', 'turn', 'movie', 'off.I', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'screenwriter', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'fact', 'follow', 'up', 'so', 'underwhelming', 'unbelieved', 'even', 'running', 'trouble', 'script', 'things', 'try', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'fist', 'fight', 'one', 'characters', 'bouncer', 'pushing', 'dispute', 'even', 'unneeded', 'sex', 'scenes', 'including', 'handcuffs', 'other', 'various', 'quot', 'ups', 'quot', 'unneeded', 'only', 'bogs', 'pace', 'film', 'actually', 'having', 'main', 'plot', 'end', 'result', 'bunch', 'segments', 'not', 'leading', 'anything', 'Just', 'waste', 'time', 'disapointed', 'viewer.This', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'i', ""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'however', 'probaly', 'most', 'underwhelming', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'promsing', 'screenwriter', 'too', 'such', 'shame']",N/A

We all know what that's like, right?  And let's be honest here, more than a few of us know what's on the mind at this point.  And, in fact, we're right:  People - *gasp* - have sex.Then the tricky twists arise.  Well, too many for there to be any real resolution to any of them.By far, of course, the ""date rape"" plot line is the most powerful and socially relevant.  Did she consent?  Was she even capable of consenting?  Or, to the contrary, did she actually scream ""NO"" repeatedly?Now THAT would have been a good plot line to follow.  We're interested.  We see the conflicting points of view, and it's fascinating to know that there is NO other witness, and it's his word against hers.  While the movie does take this plot line adequately through -- including to its less-than-satisfying conclusion -- it muddies up the progression of this situation with a HUGE slew of otherwise irrelevant and horribly uninteresting sex twists.Of the four or five couples who end up having sex that night, we really do only really care about the one, right?  I mean, in terms of plot line develpment, I don't think we really care about the particular kinky perversions of Batgirl.  And yet we're told about it anyway.All in all, it seems to me that this movie spends too much of its time trying to work ""sex sex sex"" into its reels -- probably in an effort to draw viewers who really don't care about the meaty date rape plot line -- and the end product suffers as a result.",2,"Interesting idea, TERRIBLE execution",1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1603,"['can', 'say', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'What', 'heck', 'So', 'group', 'guys', 'out', 'bar', 'meet', 'up', 'group', 'girls', 'know', 'what', 'right', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'more', 'few', 'know', 'what', 'mind', 'point', 'fact', ""'re"", 'right', 'People', '*gasp*', 'have', 'sex.Then', 'tricky', 'twists', 'arise', 'Well', 'too', 'many', 'be', 'real', 'resolution', 'them.By', 'far', 'course', 'date', 'rape', 'plot', 'line', 'most', 'powerful', 'socially', 'relevant', 'Did', 'consent', 'Was', 'even', 'capable', 'consenting', 'contrary', 'did', 'actually', 'scream', 'NO', 'repeatedly', 'Now', 'THAT', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'plot', 'line', 'follow', ""'re"", 'interested', 'see', 'conflicting', 'points', 'view', 'fascinating', 'know', 'other', 'witness', 'word', 'hers', 'movie', 'take', 'plot', 'line', 'adequately', 'including', 'less-than-satisfying', 'conclusion', 'up', 'progression', 'situation', 'HUGE', 'slew', 'otherwise', 'irrelevant', 'horribly', 'uninteresting', 'sex', 'twists.Of', 'four', 'five', 'couples', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'night', 'really', 'do', 'only', 'really', 'care', 'one', 'right', 'mean', 'terms', 'plot', 'line', 'develpment', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'care', 'particular', 'kinky', 'perversions', 'Batgirl', 'yet', ""'re"", 'told', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'work', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'reels', 'probably', 'effort', 'draw', 'viewers', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'meaty', 'date', 'rape', 'plot', 'line', 'end', 'product', 'suffers', 'result']",N/A

In much the same way people who only listen to bad commercial pop music will find fault in any movie about a jazz or classical musician, people who secretly nurture immature and antequated notions about sex, truth, love, criminality, men, women and American culture's relationship with them will find fault with this film--because of its ability to make you question their validity.With that said, this is not Citizen Kane.  But a movie does not have to be a multi-Oscar winning piece of transcendent artistry to make an artistic impact, the likes of which pulls people, kicking and screaming, out of their judgemental complacency on a topic.What is rape? What is sex? What is consensual sex?  Where does personal responsibility and conduct begin and end with a man?  Where does it begin and end with a woman? What do women like, sexually; what do they believe is and isn't sex; and do those beliefs change when they are exposed to judgemental eyes? How can the fog of sexual attraction, fun, the wilful abandonment of responsibility in the name of an impulse or a  fantasy, and alcohol (or other drugs taken willingly) lead to a clear cut definition of a sexual act that only the people involved actually ""saw""?These questions are so disturbing to both men and women in our society that we are far more comfortable discussing things that allow us to mentally default to easy, clear cut, often mythological (if not childish) conclusions.  But does ignoring their disturbing nature with wilful naivete (an oxymoron if there ever was one) or impotent cynicism serve the cause of justice in our society?  Or women?Or love?This movie was successful in making me look at these questions again, where most movies, even finely made romantic comedies or dramas with a love subtext, lull me to sleep on these issues.  America needs any little thing that can wake us up that we can get our hands on.  Consider this movie a finely made alarm clock, with its lackluster quality in some areas of dramatic construction being the snooze bar.I recommend after seeing this: A QUESTION OF CONSENT, a documentary by Billy Corben.",4,"A disturbing look at a banal, amoral core of our society, and its existential consequences",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2331,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'looking', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'were', 'responding', 'discomfort', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'how', 'was', 'artistically', 'executed', 'film', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'bad', 'commercial', 'pop', 'music', 'will', 'find', 'fault', 'movie', 'jazz', 'classical', 'musician', 'people', 'who', 'secretly', 'nurture', 'immature', 'antequated', 'notions', 'sex', 'truth', 'love', 'criminality', 'men', 'women', 'American', 'culture', 'relationship', 'will', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'ability', 'make', 'question', 'validity.With', 'said', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'multi-Oscar', 'winning', 'piece', 'transcendent', 'artistry', 'make', 'artistic', 'impact', 'likes', 'people', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'judgemental', 'complacency', 'topic.What', 'rape', 'What', 'sex', 'What', 'consensual', 'sex', 'Where', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'conduct', 'begin', 'end', 'man', 'Where', 'begin', 'end', 'woman', 'What', 'do', 'women', 'like', 'sexually', 'what', 'do', 'believe', ""n't"", 'sex', 'do', 'beliefs', 'change', 'when', 'are', 'exposed', 'judgemental', 'eyes', 'How', 'can', 'fog', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'fun', 'wilful', 'abandonment', 'responsibility', 'name', 'impulse', 'fantasy', 'alcohol', 'other', 'drugs', 'taken', 'willingly', 'lead', 'clear', 'cut', 'definition', 'sexual', 'act', 'only', 'people', 'involved', 'actually', 'saw', 'questions', 'are', 'so', 'disturbing', 'men', 'women', 'society', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'comfortable', 'discussing', 'things', 'allow', 'mentally', 'default', 'easy', 'clear', 'cut', 'often', 'mythological', 'not', 'childish', 'conclusions', 'ignoring', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'wilful', 'naivete', 'oxymoron', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'impotent', 'cynicism', 'serve', 'cause', 'justice', 'society', 'women', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'successful', 'making', 'look', 'questions', 'again', 'where', 'most', 'movies', 'even', 'finely', 'made', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'love', 'subtext', 'lull', 'sleep', 'issues', 'America', 'little', 'thing', 'can', 'wake', 'up', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Consider', 'movie', 'finely', 'made', 'alarm', 'clock', 'lackluster', 'quality', 'areas', 'dramatic', 'construction', 'being', 'snooze', 'bar.I', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'QUESTION', 'OF', 'CONSENT', 'documentary', 'Billy', 'Corben']",N/A

37157,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0780629868,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 4]","This film flounders by taking the serious subject of date rape and trying to mix it with the twenty-something licentious overdrive of ""Sex in the City"".  Written by David McKenna (""American History X"") and directed by Michael Cristofer (""Original Sin""), this screenplay has potential that is dissipated by trying to make it too sexy and hip.The story starts with Sara (Tara Reid) coming to a friend's house in the middle of the night in her nightgown with face bloodied, claiming to have been raped by her date.  We then shift to the events that preceded the alleged attack, as we meet our eight yuppies whose raging hormones are searching desperately for release by means of drunken stupefaction.  Interspersed, we receive asides from each of the characters giving their honest and somewhat immature views on sex and relationships.  This part of the film is utterly vapid and self indulgent, full of gratuitous sex and nudity, seemingly just to impress us with how shallow and hedonistic these young people are.After a night of wild and lascivious dancing, everyone gets blotto and hooks up with someone for meaningless flesh pounding.  Sara, who has been involved all night in dancing that can only be described as coital pantomime with pro football player Mike Penorisi (Jerry O'Connell), decides to take him home in a taxi after he finishes beating up a guy who bumped into him in the bar.Fast forward to the present and each participant gives a flashback description of the events, Sara describing being forcibly raped despite her protestations, and Mike describing an nymphomaniac using him to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend and who became infuriated when he called her by the wrong name.  The evidence supports both views, with Sara's behavior before the incident clearly provocative and slutty, and her emotional and physical state afterward extremely sincere and convincing.  The picture is further clouded by the fact that both were extremely drunk and the reliability of their statements is questionable.The rape storyline is fertile ground for an excellent drama, but Cristofer draws away abruptly just when the story gets interesting and returns to soliloquies of the various characters giving their reflections on the events that just occurred.  The film thus leaves the viewer extremely unsatisfied with the outcome.Ultimately, the film seems to be trying to make the point that this event was inevitable given the dangerous and irresponsible behavior of the characters.  Cristofer tries to infuse the story with the moral that loving relationships are better than promiscuous drunken encounters, but his final scenes are too abstruse to make the argument with any power.This is a good showcase for some young talent.  Most impressive is Tara Reid, best known as Vicki in ""American Pie"".  Reid gives a gut wrenching performance, sexy when she needs to be and utterly devastated after the incident.  Sean Patrick Flannery is also good as the nice guy who feels that he has to act like a sex obsessed jerk to fit in with his friends.  He has a couple scenes with Amanda Peet that are heartfelt and touching.  Peet gives a surprisingly good dramatic performance that is a far cry from the ditzy parts for which she is getting known lately.  Jerry O'Connell does well as the jock with the untamed libido.  Ron Livingston is outrageously abrasive and droll as Trent, the obnoxious dweeb with an overblown sense of self importance.This could have been a good film, but it takes the wrong approach to a serious contemporary subject.

37162,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780629868,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","If ""Body Shots"" did not start with scenes of a young woman bruised and bleeding, obviously the victim of a sexual assault, the abrupt shift that this 1999 movie takes would have been similar to those who went to see ""Million Dollar Baby"" thinking it was just a boxing film.  Indeed, even having been shown what is going to happen to one of these characters and knowing that we are seeing the events that lead up to the incident it is easy to forget that is what lies ahead in the first half of ""Body Shots,"" which was written by David McKenna (""American History X,"" ""Blow"") and directed by Michael Cristofer (""Gia"").  That is because the early part of this film involves lots of direct to camera statements by the characters, and then after the pivotal incident the fourth wall is slammed back up in our faces.The scope of the film is basically 24 hours in the lives of eight young, attractive people trying to live and have sex in L.A.  The four women are Jane (Amanda Peet), Sara (Tara Reid), Whitney (Emily Procter), and Emma (Sybil Temchen), and the four men are Rick (Sean Patrick Flanery), Michael (Jerry O'Connell), Trent (Ron Livingston), and Shawn (Brad Rowe).  The two quartets meet at a club, engage in heavy drinking and end up pairing up for the night.  Jane and Rick seem to be the smartest of the bunch so they end up together, while Sara leaves with Micheal, who plays for the Raiders.  The thing is, Sara has been dating Shawn, who responds to this affront by taking Emily out to the alley.  That leaves Trent to end up spending the night with Whitney, who turns out to have another side to her sweet disposition.There is a strong documentary-like element to the first part of the film, where most of the characters get to weigh in on various matters, usually sexual, that are under discussion.  This allows us to get lots of views about everything from what constitutes ""sex"" to whether or not teeth are a good thing to bring into play during a particular endeavor.  However, given what is going to happen in this film these exchanges of personal philosophies are not simply an opportunity to run the gamut of viewpoints but an opportunity to judge the characters.  This will become critical in trying to make any judgment as to what really happened between Sarah and Michael.Sara says that she was raped by Michael and he denies it.  When he hears the news Trent says he could totally see that happening.  What we see is first his version of what happened and then her version of the same events.  The obvious cinematic reference point would seem to be to ""Rashomon,"" but ""Body Shots"" does not get that far.  In Akira Kurosawa's film we had three different versions of the same story, each of which revealed something about the character once you established their motive for distorting what happened.  Here we have only two versions, the basic ""she said/he said"" dilemma.  But at the end of ""Rashomon"" we do get the ""truth,"" as the woodcutter confesses he saw what ""really"" happened, an understanding that allows us to go back and reconsider the other three stories a second time.  But ""Body Shots"" does not get to the ""truth"" and we do not know what really happened.This will drive some viewers to distraction, and obviously has.  However, it is significant that Jane and Rick, who are the two smart ones, do not have to decided whether they believe Sarah or Michael, because they do not hear both stories.  Jane only hears what Sarah has to say, and Rick, as Michael's attorney, only hears his side.  But even without hearing the other side, each has to decide whether at face value they believe their friend.  The chilling part of this story is that since both sides are believable (Michael is truly amazed and outraged while Sarah is really bruised and bleeding) who we decide to believe could be based entirely on our gender.  Guys will believe Michael and women will believe Sarah, and what implications are we to draw from that rather chilling impasse?Ultimately, the problem with ""Body Shots"" is not that we are left to construct our own meaning from these events and render our own personal judgment as to whom we believe (with an emphasis on being able to explain why so that there is an actual articulation of reasons as opposed to going on a gut instinct based on gender), but that the approach of the first half of the film contrasts too much with the second.  These characters are glib when it comes to talking about sex, but is this just a stylistic approach of the film, a way for the writer to show off with all the outrageous topics and thoughts he can have come out of the mouths of these characters, or is it a lesson in itself?  Because if the second part of the film does not teach a clear lesson, perhaps the first half does.  Maybe the second part is not the wake up call, maybe it is the first half and that when Sarah assures us that sex is ""just sex"" she has doomed her character to her fate.",3,If you can figure out

We'll probably never know, given that the twisted, uncomfortable mess that we got is probably not on anyone's remake slate in the foreseeable future. Nor should it be. While the main story seems to revolve around the question of whether a famous football player (Jerry O'Connell, whose post-Sliders career has just kept going farther and farther down the tubes) raped a party girl (Tara Reid, whose career has never gotten out of those same tubes), the story is no more than a sidelight in the examinations of the lives of eight people whose relationships with one another come to be defined by the alleged event. And it's here that the nugget of that potentially decent film resides; who cares about the plot when you've got interesting characters? And to their credit, Cristofer and screenwriter David McKenna (American History X) do try to make the characters interesting. I have little doubt, actually, that they are interesting, at least to [...] twelve-year-old boys. To anyone out of adolescence, however, they're likely to be boring. There's a minor point of debate to be had as to whether McKenna meant to show these characters as juvenile and emotionally stunted, but there's no evidence that McKenna doesn't see them as mature adults, and it's that evidence that would have gone partway towards making them worthwhile.But I'm spending far too much time talking about this movie, when I could be doing something more productive.

Well unfortunatly thats what they did.Body Shots is about a group of eight adults, four men and four women who all have different opinions on sex.  It's Friday so they all decide to go clubing.  The next day all of them got some, but unfortunatly some not in the way they wanted.  After the initial club scene where they got drunk they wake up the next day.  The latter part of the film ends up focused on the incidenet between Jerry O'Connell and Tara Reid as she claims he raped her.  However they were both so drunk they don't remember what happened.Overall the movie is Ok at best.  The only really redeeming value is that we got to see some of Tara Reids Naughty Parts.  Past that the movie features a lame been there done that plot, weak sex, poor acting, and overall not what was expected from what seemed like an interesting idea.",2,"Interesting Idea, poorly created",1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1047,"['Body', 'Shots', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Mix', 'reality', 'tv', 'time', 'Real', 'World', 'fill', 'hot', 'young', 'actors', 'make', 'sure', 'movie', 'plot', 'make', 'sure', 'lot', 'sex', 'watch', 'fly', 'Well', 'unfortunatly', 'what', 'did.Body', 'Shots', 'group', 'eight', 'adults', 'four', 'men', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'sex', 'Friday', 'decide', 'go', 'clubing', 'next', 'day', 'got', 'unfortunatly', 'not', 'way', 'wanted', 'initial', 'club', 'scene', 'where', 'got', 'drunk', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'up', 'focused', 'incidenet', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Tara', 'Reid', 'raped', 'However', 'were', 'so', 'drunk', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'movie', 'Ok', 'best', 'only', 'really', 'redeeming', 'value', 'got', 'see', 'Tara', 'Reids', 'Naughty', 'Parts', 'Past', 'movie', 'lame', 'been', 'done', 'plot', 'weak', 'sex', 'poor', 'acting', 'overall', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'what', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'idea']",N/A
