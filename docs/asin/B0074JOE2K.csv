1526343,A10BWW5GU19AD,B0074JOE2K,Jeff Wiley,"[5, 5]","After a tour of duty with the Army overseas, Kelli returns to Ohio to her family and the expectation of re-assimilating back into the life that she knew prior her deployment.  Reality trumps her expectations, however, and so begins a narrowing journey to find solid ground again.  This is the crux of 'Return'.Make no mistake : Linda Cardellini puts this movie on her back, and carries it the entire way.  She turns in the best performance of her career to date as the young soldier struggling with life as she once knew it.  Michael Shannon somewhat steps outside of his comfort zone in his role as her husband, Mike.  While often playing quirky, left-of-center characters with strong personalities, he opts for a reserved, soft-spoken approach to play Mike.  His performance is as solid as any that he's ever given, and his ever-expanding resume continues to make him one of the more reliable actors working today.Evenly paced, 'Return' is a character study of a life removed from balance, and the endeavor to restore what once was.",4,A search for solid ground,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1034,"['tour', 'duty', 'Army', 'overseas', 'Kelli', 'Ohio', 'family', 'expectation', 're-assimilating', 'back', 'life', 'knew', 'prior', 'deployment', 'Reality', 'expectations', 'however', 'so', 'narrowing', 'journey', 'find', 'solid', 'ground', 'again', 'crux', ""'Return'.Make"", 'mistake', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'movie', 'back', 'entire', 'way', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'date', 'young', 'soldier', 'struggling', 'life', 'once', 'knew', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'somewhat', 'comfort', 'zone', 'role', 'husband', 'Mike', 'often', 'playing', 'quirky', 'left-of-center', 'characters', 'strong', 'personalities', 'reserved', 'soft-spoken', 'approach', 'play', 'Mike', 'performance', 'as', 'solid', 'ever', 'given', 'ever-expanding', 'resume', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'reliable', 'actors', 'working', 'today.Evenly', 'paced', 'character', 'study', 'life', 'removed', 'balance', 'endeavor', 'restore', 'what', 'once', 'was']",Return
1526344,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0074JOE2K,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","I've followed Linda Cardellini's career ever since the wildly entertaining days of ""Freaks & Geeks"" (a great show that never had the audience it deserved, but everyone loves in hindsight). She has matured in interesting ways as an actress, and brings a surprising gravitas and a world weary appeal to the indie drama ""Return."" In many ways, it is Cardellini that is the primary selling point of Liza Johnson's introspective look at a soldier's homecoming. ""Return"" is not the first film to delve into this subject, nor will it be the last. It does, however, have a unexpected matter-of-factness that serves the piece well. The screenplay isn't populated by big dramatic moments. Instead, it is filled with quietness, regrets, things left unsaid, disappointments. Cardellini brings a tremendous amount of depth to this believable role without ever resorting to grandstanding. Every emotion is simply etched across her weathered face.Cardellini plays a wife and mother returning to her small town existence after a deployment overseas. The film never tells you much about her experiences (she was more support personnel than involved in action), but it is clear that she is having trouble settling back into her old ways. At first, there is a simple bliss but things start to erode as she becomes more and more disconnected. This puts a strain on her relationship with her husband (the always welcome Michael Shannon), her co-workers, and her former friends. She simply feels like she no longer fits, and most of the film deals with this struggle.""Return"" is an intimate picture that gets the audience up close and personal. You may not always like or understand Cardellini, but what was fascinating (to me) was that I think she felt the same way about herself. It's not a movie with a big plot or a dramatic character arc. For that reason, some may find it slow or too open-ended. It is simply a slice-of-life glimpse at an all-too-common phenomenon, and it seems both timely and relevant for that reason. As an added bonus, Mad Men's John Slattery has a small, but great, role. But mostly, this is Cardellini''s show. She expresses a lot without saying a lot. If this is any indication, I hope to see her expand into bigger projects (and not of the Scooby-Doo variety, hopefully those days are behind her). ""Return"" may not, in the end, be for everyone--but it's a solid little film for a patient adult audience.

1526349,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B0074JOE2K,Tony Heck,"[3, 4]","""This is just a giant waste of time. I can't do it anymore."" After Kelli (Cardellini) returns home from the war she finds it much harder to adjust then expected. Finding life mundane and pointless she begins to drift. When her husband Mike (Shannon) leaves with the kids she is forced to deal with her problem. There have been many, many movies made about problems returning soldiers experience when trying to adjust to day-to-day life. ""Home Of The Brave"" is one of the more recent great ones. Like that movie this one deals with how she feels that life is so mundane and boring it begins to affect her relationships with others. The main problem with this one is that it seems to take forever to go anywhere. The acting is great and the story is good but again it is very slow and sometimes hard to stay interested in. I would compare this to the recent ""Take Shelter"" movie in its pacing and feel. If you liked that movie you will probably like this one too. Overall, a very OK movie that could have been better. I give it a B-.",3,Great acting and good story about a returning soldier. The main problem is that it is very slow.
