I love that Jo finds someone who she is compatible with. No offense to Laurie, but she is better off with the professor. Great female movie. It made me proud to be a female. I also love that it is family-oriented. It was made very well, and will stand the test of time. One more thing, in addition to the main characters who clearly also loved their mother, there's a small father-daughter theme--the man who dashed Beth his daughter's piano, which is terrific. Two more things, they have good manners in this film, which is wonderful and they dressed them up really well.

Wynona Ryder, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado, and Kirsten Dunst, play four sisters(Joe, Beth, Meg, and Amy) that live the role's of fantasy within a hardened reality.  Due to the tumultuous force of the Civil War, their family has fallen from a pedistol in society to the grand standing heights of togetherness and warmth within the means of their own spirits. Their father rages on the battle-front while Marmee (Susan Sarandon) keeps tight her little women from the casualties of daily life. Little Women inspired me in all ways that my emotions would allow, while all the while Thomas Newman's soundtracks gently guides you through the steps of their failures, triumphs, and hysteric's.  After countless viewings (35-55) it has stood against the test of time that sometimes fades the impact a movie creates. After 7 years Little Women still fascinates me as much as it did on my first viewing. Love, distrust, death, and creativity, within these, their bond's of family strength hold them.  There are lesson's to be learned if we are willing to open our own hearts to them. To our friends, Loves, and families, there is something to be gathered from these little women. That lesson is the importance of togetherness.  ~S.A.O.S.~",5,Orchard House,996969600,"08 5, 2001",2001,1457,"['Deep', 'heart', 'Women', 'lie', 'secrets', 'men', 'will', 'no', 'more', 'discover', 'treasure', 'chest', 'back', 'yard', 'yet', 'fact', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'new', 'understanding', 'jewels', 'women', 'possess', 'internally', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Trini', 'Alvarado', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'play', 'four', 'sisters', 'Joe', 'Beth', 'Meg', 'Amy', 'live', 'role', 'fantasy', 'hardened', 'reality', 'Due', 'tumultuous', 'force', 'Civil', 'War', 'family', 'fallen', 'pedistol', 'society', 'grand', 'standing', 'heights', 'togetherness', 'warmth', 'means', 'own', 'spirits', 'father', 'rages', 'battle-front', 'Marmee', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'tight', 'little', 'women', 'casualties', 'daily', 'life', 'Little', 'Women', 'inspired', 'ways', 'emotions', 'would', 'allow', 'while', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'soundtracks', 'gently', 'guides', 'steps', 'failures', 'triumphs', 'hysteric', 'countless', 'viewings', '35-55', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'sometimes', 'impact', 'movie', '7', 'years', 'Little', 'Women', 'still', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'first', 'viewing', 'Love', 'distrust', 'death', 'creativity', 'bond', 'family', 'strength', 'hold', 'are', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'are', 'willing', 'open', 'own', 'hearts', 'friends', 'Loves', 'families', 'something', 'be', 'gathered', 'little', 'women', 'lesson', 'importance', 'togetherness', '~S.A.O.S.~']",N/A

Despite some very nice performances and some beautiful imagery, there is little impact made by the glossy film.  It just kind of sits there.  The story is one full of drama and tension and yet none of that is effectively conveyed.  It just feels so rudimentary, with no real life blood.  Still, the central performances are nice, especially the supporting turns by Claire Danes (my one moment of tear induced connection) and Christian Bale (so loose and relaxed and energetic).  The sad thing is that the film carries a veneer of stiffness or mugginess.  I have not read the book, so I cannot compare there (although devoted fans of the book have claimed this film veers.

So I of course started out with an additude to begin with, muttering that the book was always better. In this case, I was so wrong. The characters portrayed in this film are the same ones I met in 5th grade when I first read ""Little Women"". The actors shine in their roles and truly embody everyone one of the literary creations they represents.Playing the March matriarch, Susan Sarandon is great! She is able to maintain the feel of the period while bringing to Marmee an empowering bout of women's rights thoughts. Sarandon gives off warmth and knowledge wiht the apparent ease of someone completely familiar with the material.Wynona Ryder is another standout here. She is the raging bundle of emotion that we have all come to know as Jo March. Playing down her usually unique features, Ryder plays the part with spunk and earnestness.My favorite here is Christian Bale as the oft put uopn Theodore ""Laurie"" Lawrence. Quite a jump from his ""Newsies"" days, Bale is the best Laurie I have seen on screen to date. He has the mannerisms and lines down to perfection, while still maintaining the spontanaity that really is a huge part of Laurie's character. He also handles the age jump incredibly well.Not until my most recent viewing of the movie did I realize Gabriel Byrne was Professor Bhaer. The native irishman does a great job of bringing Frerdrick to life, right down to his physical bumbling and poetic heart.In my opinion, this movie was a complete triumph and a complete success from novel to film. All actors are fine in their roles, most exceptional, and it is such a joy to see an old favorite and all-time classic brought to life which such enthusiasm and talent.

Unlike some earlier versions, it is robust, deeply engaging and fully satisfying.  This movie delivers Louisa May Alcott's novel to new generations.  Roger Ebert was right when he praised the film as &#34;surprisingly sharp and intelligent.&#34;  This is absolutely the case.  Winona Ryder's radiant and appealing portrayal of Jo is the very heart of the film, but all the cast is superb.  Susan Sarandon is flawless as the mother of the family; Kirsten Dunst is delightful as little Amy; Claire Danes gives a heartrending portrayal of Beth; but all the sisters are marvelously portrayed; Christian Bale as the neighbor Laurie is lovable and endearing; Eric Stolz is memorable as Laurie's tutor, and Gabriel Byrne is perfect, absolutely perfect,  in his role as the wise and gentle German professor Jo meets in New York, who becomes a a mentor and friend.  This is a wonderful film to watch during the holiday season.  If you've been disappointed in overly sweet Christmas films, take a chance on this one.

22818,A358XP3X4U0X45,0767851013,bookloversfriend,"[14, 19]","One thing you all should know: There was a ""novelization"" of this Armstrong movie.  Yes, a ""book"" of about 110 pages, which followed the movie exactly.  Many people bought this ""book"", thinking they were getting Alcott's Little Women!  No wonder so many reviewers here think this movie followed the book!All four movie versions have their advantages.  The Hepburn version has, well, Hepburn.  Everything else about that movie was bad.The same filmmakers had another go at it in 1949 with an all-star cast, in color with the superb Mervyn Leroy directing and delightful music.  And most importantly, it is true to the spirit of the Alcott novel.The BBC took a whack at it in 1973.  Three and a half hours, so it has more of the book, but even they couldn't abide the homespun wisdom of Marmee and substituted feminist advice circa 1970 for the advice Marmee gives Meg (very different from the feminist advice in the present version).  (Too bad.  Read the book's advice someday.  It could save many a modern marriage.)And now, this version.

22820,A2LLWO2030A41A,0767851013,Brittany,"[0, 0]","Most everyone who knows me knows that I am obsessed with Little Women.  It is my favorite book (I don't dare to review THAT because I know I will rant on and on about its awesomeness and bore everyone to tears), I wrote all my college essays about its impact on me and I've read it about three or four times a year since I was nine, so I may be a bit biased in saying this is the best film I've ever seen, but hear me out...First of all, I think the casting was almost perfect, especially with Winona Ryder as Jo, Christian Bale as Laurie, and Susan Sarandon as Marmee (though I was somewhat traumatized after I saw her in the Rocky Horror Picture Show a few years after I first viewed this film): they were very believable in their roles and they made me laugh, listen carefully to their words of wisdom, and cry when they experienced hardship.  Secondly, the plot moves fast but doesn't miss capturing the spirit of the scenes that echo those from the book (ex: Jo's anger after discovering Amy has burned her manuscript).  Thirdly, the necessity of deleting some of the book's content carried out by the film makers didn't seem off-putting at all to me -- very few scenes that I really admired were passed over. Fourth, the edition of new content was enjoyable (Ex: couples kissing tenderly or passionately rather than hinting darkly of romance in such a way that the reader doesn't always know how far the feelings run -- one thing that always bothered me was the lack of courtship between John and Meg before she accepted his proposal: she seemed to enjoy rejecting him too much at first to have feelings rooted too deep at that point): Louisa May Alcott's book was largely autobiographical and she based Jo off of her own experiences, so the idea of having this Jo write her experiences into a novel entitled Little Women seemed perfect in my eyes.I see that some reviewers seem to prefer the earlier adaptations of the novel: personally this is the only one I've ever seen, though if I had a chance (or the funds) to get my hands on the others I'd snap them up in a second: hard to imagine the film any better, but I am totally open to possibilities.",5,My favorite :),1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,2157,"['Most', 'everyone', 'who', 'am', 'obsessed', 'Little', 'Women', 'favorite', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'review', 'THAT', 'know', 'will', 'rant', 'awesomeness', 'bore', 'everyone', 'tears', 'wrote', 'college', 'impact', ""'ve"", 'read', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'year', 'was', 'nine', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'biased', 'saying', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hear', 'First', 'think', 'casting', 'was', 'almost', 'perfect', 'especially', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jo', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Laurie', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Marmee', 'was', 'somewhat', 'traumatized', 'saw', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'few', 'years', 'first', 'viewed', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'roles', 'made', 'listen', 'carefully', 'words', 'wisdom', 'cry', 'when', 'experienced', 'hardship', 'Secondly', 'plot', 'moves', 'fast', ""n't"", 'miss', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'scenes', 'echo', 'book', 'ex', 'Jo', 'anger', 'discovering', 'Amy', 'burned', 'manuscript', 'Thirdly', 'necessity', 'deleting', 'book', 'content', 'carried', 'out', 'film', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'off-putting', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'really', 'admired', 'were', 'passed', 'Fourth', 'edition', 'new', 'content', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Ex', 'couples', 'kissing', 'tenderly', 'passionately', 'rather', 'hinting', 'darkly', 'romance', 'such', 'way', 'reader', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'feelings', 'run', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'bothered', 'was', 'lack', 'courtship', 'John', 'Meg', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'rejecting', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'have', 'feelings', 'rooted', 'too', 'deep', 'point', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'book', 'was', 'largely', 'autobiographical', 'based', 'Jo', 'own', 'experiences', 'idea', 'having', 'Jo', 'write', 'experiences', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Little', 'Women', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'eyes.I', 'see', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'adaptations', 'novel', 'personally', 'only', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'chance', 'funds', 'get', 'hands', 'others', ""'d"", 'snap', 'up', 'second', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'better', 'am', 'totally', 'open', 'possibilities']",N/A
22821,A2HPIZ11ZUTIBI,0767851013,Caroll A. Flanery,"[5, 7]","I saw this version on ""Little Women"" shortly after reading the book, and was pleased with how well it followed the book.  True, the screenplay did invoke a little modern feminism, but there was a feminist movement during the 1860's; it was called the suffragette movement.  The Marches were transcendentalists, and as such, were greatly involved with all of the social issues of the day including child labor and rights of women and blacks.  Knowing this, I did not have a problem with some of the liberties taken by the screenwriter.  I feel this adaptation of ""Little Women"" was much more faithful to the book than the Katharine Hepburn/Janet Leigh version.  That version seemed to center mostly on the girls fighting for the affections of Laurie, which was really a minor plot line in the book.  The older version also made Marmee into a fretting, hand-wringing worrywart instead of the truly courageous woman that she was.  This version of ""Little Women"" was beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, and beatifully scored.  I can't pick a favorite performance, although I am a bit partial to Winona Ryder and Christian Bale, the latter playing a flawless Laurie, and the former inhabiting the very spirit of Jo March.

22823,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0767851013,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","Little Women is based on the 1868 book by Louisa May Alcott, that was in turn based on her own family and sisters. Alcott was a daughter of noted Transcendentalist Amos Bronson Alcott and Abigail May Alcott. She had three sisters: one elder (Anna Alcott Pratt) and two younger (Elizabeth Sewall Alcott and Abigail May Alcott Nieriker). The family moved to Boston in 1834 or 1835 where her father established an experimental school and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.Transcendentalism was a group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that emerged in New England in the early to middle 19th century. Transcendentalism began as a protest against the general state of culture and society at the time. Among transcendentalists' core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions. The best known work coming out of this movement was Thoreau's Walden; or Life in the Woods. Walden Pond itself is shown in Little Women in a scene where young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) is ice skating and falls in it. Talk about your skating on thin ice...Jo March (Winona Ryder) is the second oldest sister, and she is clearly the one modeled after Louisa May Alcott herself. She is an aspiring writer who writes stories and plays that the sisters act out. This is a perfect vehicle for Winona Ryder, whose own unconventional upbringing and alternative views on private property are mirrored by the March family:Josephine 'Jo' March: If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement, then I say the Marches must be the most elegant family in Concord!Amy March is played by two actresses, as in the first part she is just a child (a young Kirsten Dunst), but later she grows up to be a painter (Samantha Mathis). The young Amy is quite a scene stealer, and like Sheridan's Mrs. Malaprop, she sometimes makes up or misuses words, to comic effect:Younger Amy March: We've been expectorating you for hours!Meanwhile, scion of the prosperous Laurence family, and therefore known as Laurie (Christian Bale), wonders aloud to his tutor (Eric Stolz) what exactly transpires within the neighbors' cloistered household:John Brooke: Over the mysteries of female life there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.But young Laurie can't really leave the veil undisturbed, try as he might:Jo: [as Jo and Laurie dance awkwardly at Belle Gardner's ball] I'm sorry! Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home! It's a shame you don't know the lady's part!At one point, there is an epidemic of scarlet fever, and Amy is sent away to live with relatives to escape exposure:Amy: I don't wanna die. I've never even been kissed. I've waited my whole to be kissed, and what if I miss it?Laurie: I tell you what. I promise to kiss you before you die.Though he becomes very close to them all, he is in love with Jo. But it is complicated, as she has him firmly ensconsed in the friend bag.Laurie: I have loved you since the moment I clamped eyes on you. What could be more reasonable than to marry you?Jo March: We'd kill each other.Laurie: Nonsense!Jo March: Neither of us can keep our temper-...Laurie: I can, unless provoked.Jo March: We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you. We'd only quarrel!Laurie: I wouldn't!Jo March: You can't even propose without quarreling.He isn't going to take that without a fight, or a quarrel, more like it:Laurie: Someday you'll find a man, a good man, and you'll love him, and marry him, and live and die for him. And I'll be hanged if I stand by and watch.Jo is unsatisfied with her life and so Marmee March (Susan Sarandon) (and who better to play such a role?), marvelous matriarch of the March menangerie, sends her off:Marmee March: Oh, Jo. Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts; how can you expect to lead an ordinary life? You're ready to go out and - and find a good use for your talent. Tho' I don't know what I shall do without my Jo. Go, and embrace your liberty. And see what wonderful things come of it.In New York she meets a lot of interesting people foremost of whom is a handsome professor from Germany, Friedrich Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne). He takes her to see Georges Bizet's opera The Pearl Fishers, and while sitting in their vantage point perched high in the rafters backstage he translates for her:Friedrich: Your heart understood mine. In the depth of the fragrant night, I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice. Your heart understood mine.Of course though he is merely translating the opera, the words are also meant for Jo as well. He is a professor of philosophy, and he encourages her writing, but he feels like she is capable of more. When shown some of her work intended for a commercial audience he tells her so:Friedrich: [having read Jo's latest book] There is *nothing* in this of the woman I am privileged to know.He may be on to something. Jo is quite bursting with inspiration:Jo: Late At night my mind would come alive with voices and stories and friends as dear to me as any in the real world. I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.More professorial advice:Friedrich Bhaer: You must write from the depths of your soul!Meanwhile Amy goes off to Europe with Aunt March to study painting. Laurie is also there, studying music, and the two meet:Amy: Have you heard from Jo? She has befriended a German professor.Laurie: I envy her happiness. I envy his happiness. I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg. I hate Fred Vaughn. And if Beth had a lover I would despise him too. Just as you have always known that you would never marry a pauper, I have always known that I belong to the March family.Amy: I will not be loved for my family...It is complictated, isn't it? As Professor Bhaer tells Jo while watching the opera:Jo: What's going to happen?Friedrich: The inevitable.I thought I wasn't going to be able to enjoy this movie as it is intended for children, and female ones at that, but it was very entertaining. I wondered if some of the political issues had been shoehorned in by Winona and Sarandon, but looking into the background of author Alcott, those elements would have been there in the original book if Alcott had the freedoms we enjoy today. It is a prime example of where a story works on two levels simultaneously, with something for the kids, but also something for adults to ponder. Great period costumes and lush cinematography, especially the winter New England tableau. Interesting to see a young Kirsten Dunst, before Spiderman, as well as Christian Bale before he donned the Batman cape and cowl. As an interesting aside, there is a movie of the next book in the March family saga, Little Men. Here the character of Friedrich Bhaer was played by Christopher Sarandon, who divorced Susan but she kept his last name since then.The Alcott family reminded me a bit of The Bront sisters, who used to write their own little books and dramas, and then went on to produce such classic works of fiction as Charlotte Bront's Jane Ayre and Emily Bront's superb Wuthering Heights.The film is dedicated to two persons, one of whom is Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped from her Petaluma, California, home in 1993 and later found murdered. Winona Ryder, much of whose youth was spent in Petaluma, joined in the highly publicized search effort and made a number of emotional appeals for the child's safe return. Little Women was Polly's favorite book.Films of Susan SarandonDead Man Walking(1995) .... Sister Helen PrejeanThelma & Louise(1991) .... LouisePretty Baby(1978) ....

22825,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,0767851013,Char,"[0, 0]","Some flaws in casting choices perhaps: As a character study of Jo's development as a writer, Winona's portrayal is not very plausible.  A girl with a just ordinary personality, she seems like  ""the girl nextdoor.""  The actress who plays Beth doesn't look right for the delicate frailty of facial features that would give more appropriate impression of sensitive and shy Beth's character.  As acted here, adult Amy turns out to be the strongest and deepest character emotionally and the most likely candidate for star (or main character) of the show--which, really, Jo is supposed to be.Whether or not Winona Ryder or Katherine Hepburn (in an older version of the story) was most truly like the real-life Louisa Alcott is beyond my knowledge, but I find Katherine Hepburn's past portrayal of ""Jo"" to be more memorable and deeper than Winona's.  I remember the Hepburn movie as having greater dramatic unity, probably because of the stronger focus upon the character of Jo (and less on her sisters) in the unraveling of the plot.  The same was true in the 1942 version of the movie which starred June Alyson and Liz Taylor.  Jo was definitely the main focus there, too.I thought that I'd seen but forgotten that 1942 version so I decided to view it again for comparison purposes just after watching this new version.  (I soon realized I'd never seen it at all because what I vaguely remembered was a black-haired young Liz Taylor in it, not blonde!)  It became clear to me that the new 1994 version made an attempt to find modern actors who resembled several of the actresses in the movie of 1942 (the facial features of Marme and Beth especially, and to a certain extent Amy; also the appearance and manner of the German professor was very similar.).  Scenically, the two movies were similar, too.  Some details in the two movies were handled differently.  Both had some agreeable features and were emotionally moving.  One of the improved treatments in the newer version was in the portrayals of both Aunt March and Amy; the new treatment offered greater depth of character and relationship, thus was more satisfying.  (Senior aunts viewing the movie would feel a bit more gratified to identify with the newer version of Aunt March and her ability to bring blessings to the family despite being a difficult personality!)This newer version of Little Women (and the older two versions that I've seen) all are very excellent movies with good things to offer.  They're each different and can stand alone as separate creations of worth in their own right.  And it's fun to compare and contrast all the versions.  (Now, I'd like to refresh my experience of the Hepburn version in order to examine it in the light of the other two.)I find no better way to briefly express my perception of a certain amount of failure in this new version than just to use the phrase ""poorly realized.""  It seemed a  ""jumble"" of focuses upon all the daughters' developments as differing personalities and their fates; it somehow felt fragmented because it didn't handle the many characters well.  For instance, very unsuccessful glimpse of father March and nothing more.  But, by comparison with the 1942 movie, I felt a greater appreciation of the way that the 1994 version did go into more detail about Meg's and Amy's love stories as well as Jo's.  After having experienced them just previously in the 1994 version, I missed the details of their stories while watching the 1942 version.  There was added depth, warmth, and richness in this newer version because of the additional focus on Meg's and Amy's fates in love.",4,"Jo is just ""the girl nextdoor""",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,3596,"['flaws', 'casting', 'choices', 'perhaps', 'character', 'study', 'Jo', 'development', 'writer', 'Winona', 'portrayal', 'not', 'very', 'plausible', 'girl', 'just', 'ordinary', 'personality', 'girl', 'nextdoor', 'actress', 'who', 'Beth', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'delicate', 'frailty', 'facial', 'features', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'appropriate', 'impression', 'sensitive', 'shy', 'Beth', 'character', 'acted', 'here', 'adult', 'Amy', 'out', 'be', 'strongest', 'deepest', 'character', 'emotionally', 'most', 'likely', 'candidate', 'star', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'really', 'Jo', 'supposed', 'be.Whether', 'not', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'older', 'version', 'story', 'was', 'most', 'truly', 'real-life', 'Louisa', 'Alcott', 'knowledge', 'find', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'past', 'portrayal', 'Jo', 'be', 'more', 'memorable', 'deeper', 'Winona', 'remember', 'Hepburn', 'movie', 'having', 'greater', 'dramatic', 'unity', 'probably', 'stronger', 'focus', 'character', 'Jo', 'less', 'sisters', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'same', 'was', 'true', '1942', 'version', 'movie', 'starred', 'June', 'Alyson', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Jo', 'was', 'definitely', 'main', 'focus', 'there', 'too.I', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'forgotten', '1942', 'version', 'decided', 'view', 'again', 'comparison', 'purposes', 'just', 'watching', 'new', 'version', 'soon', 'realized', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'what', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'was', 'black-haired', 'young', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'not', 'blonde', 'became', 'clear', 'new', '1994', 'version', 'made', 'attempt', 'find', 'modern', 'actors', 'who', 'resembled', 'several', 'actresses', 'movie', '1942', 'facial', 'features', 'Marme', 'Beth', 'especially', 'certain', 'extent', 'Amy', 'also', 'appearance', 'manner', 'German', 'professor', 'was', 'very', 'similar.', 'Scenically', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'similar', 'too', 'details', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'handled', 'differently', 'had', 'agreeable', 'features', 'were', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'One', 'improved', 'treatments', 'newer', 'version', 'was', 'portrayals', 'Aunt', 'March', 'Amy', 'new', 'treatment', 'offered', 'greater', 'depth', 'character', 'relationship', 'thus', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Senior', 'aunts', 'viewing', 'movie', 'would', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'gratified', 'identify', 'newer', 'version', 'Aunt', 'March', 'ability', 'bring', 'blessings', 'family', 'being', 'difficult', 'personality', 'newer', 'version', 'Little', 'Women', 'older', 'two', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'very', 'excellent', 'movies', 'good', 'things', 'offer', ""'re"", 'different', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'separate', 'creations', 'worth', 'own', 'right', 'fun', 'compare', 'contrast', 'versions', 'Now', ""'d"", 'like', 'refresh', 'experience', 'Hepburn', 'version', 'order', 'examine', 'light', 'other', 'two', 'find', 'better', 'way', 'briefly', 'express', 'perception', 'certain', 'amount', 'failure', 'new', 'version', 'just', 'use', 'phrase', 'poorly', 'realized', 'seemed', 'jumble', 'focuses', 'daughters', 'developments', 'differing', 'personalities', 'fates', 'felt', 'fragmented', 'did', ""n't"", 'handle', 'many', 'characters', 'well', 'instance', 'very', 'unsuccessful', 'glimpse', 'father', 'March', 'nothing', 'more', 'comparison', '1942', 'movie', 'felt', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'way', '1994', 'version', 'did', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'Meg', 'Amy', 'love', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'Jo', 'having', 'experienced', 'just', 'previously', '1994', 'version', 'missed', 'details', 'stories', 'watching', '1942', 'version', 'was', 'added', 'depth', 'warmth', 'richness', 'newer', 'version', 'additional', 'focus', 'Meg', 'Amy', 'fates', 'love']",N/A

I have also own both the Kathern Hepburn and the June Allison versions.  I saw this movie in the theater and I just finished watching it again today, 1/3/08 and I still think it is the best film adaptation.Over all, I think that this version has the best actors, the highest production values, and was  beautifully portrayed. It was like they were really those people. True, there were some scenes that weren't in the book but over all it was a faithful adaptation.Some of the things I especially liked was that the scene were Amy falls in the pond was included.  This was a very dramatic event in the book, and was left out of the other 2 versions. I also enjoyed the inclusion of Pickwick  papers.  I thought all the actresses were close in appearance to the characters and often posed like the engravings of the book. Christian Bale was a very good Laurie. Kirsten Durst was amazing as Amy.There were 4 things I really didn't like and wondered why they were included in this version. One, Susan Sarandon's portrayal of Marmie.  Marmie was not a feminist.  I'm guessing Armstrong felt Alcott was somewhat of a feminist in her own right and that's how she justified Sarandon's acting.  Meg always wanted a silk dress and for some reason she objected to it in this version.  Prof Bhaer did take Jo to the theater,but they had regular seats not ones backstage. Jo drinking and talking to men.  This is a very small thing and they do this in all period movies but all the kissing that Jo and Prof Bhaer did while they were in New York- We know that didn't happen.I don't think that there were ever be a better version, because of the quailty of the actors.",5,I love this  version,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,1734,"['Little', 'Women', 'was', 'favorite', 'book', 'growing', 'up', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'also', 'own', 'Kathern', 'Hepburn', 'June', 'Allison', 'versions', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'again', 'today', '1/3/08', 'still', 'think', 'best', 'film', 'think', 'version', 'best', 'actors', 'highest', 'production', 'values', 'was', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'was', 'were', 'really', 'people', 'True', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'book', 'was', 'faithful', 'adaptation.Some', 'things', 'especially', 'liked', 'was', 'scene', 'were', 'Amy', 'falls', 'pond', 'was', 'included', 'was', 'very', 'dramatic', 'event', 'book', 'was', 'left', 'other', '2', 'versions', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'inclusion', 'Pickwick', 'papers', 'thought', 'actresses', 'were', 'close', 'appearance', 'characters', 'often', 'posed', 'engravings', 'book', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Laurie', 'Kirsten', 'Durst', 'was', 'amazing', 'Amy.There', 'were', '4', 'things', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'wondered', 'why', 'were', 'included', 'version', 'One', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'portrayal', 'Marmie', 'Marmie', 'was', 'not', 'feminist', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Armstrong', 'felt', 'Alcott', 'was', 'somewhat', 'feminist', 'own', 'right', 'how', 'justified', 'Sarandon', 'acting', 'Meg', 'always', 'wanted', 'silk', 'dress', 'reason', 'objected', 'version', 'Prof', 'Bhaer', 'did', 'take', 'Jo', 'theater', 'had', 'regular', 'seats', 'not', 'ones', 'backstage', 'Jo', 'drinking', 'talking', 'men', 'very', 'small', 'thing', 'do', 'period', 'movies', 'kissing', 'Jo', 'Prof', 'Bhaer', 'did', 'were', 'New', 'York-', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'ever', 'be', 'better', 'version', 'quailty', 'actors']",N/A

Pasterjak ""Dana""","[1, 7]","When remaking a classic and staying within the time period that the novel was written in, the film makers should stay within the author's intentions as well. Now had they updated the movie and changed it to a more modern time period, then I would understand the undertones of feminism or activism so prevalent, but in my opinion, it's not completely appropriate in this version.Costuming was great, the &quot;look&quot; of the movie was dead-on and spectacular. It was the over-tones of feminisism I take issue with. Sure the March family is &quot;ahead of it's time&quot; and &quot;different.&quot; The movie expertly captures that on the screen. But some of the speeches didn't ring true to the original. Once again, had they updated the tale to a more modern time period I would have believed it more having read the novel and knowing the characters and their intentions.Casting was great. Some reviewers had a problem with the actresses who played the roles of both Amy and Beth. Well, I tend to agree. Kristen Dunst did a great job portraying Beth, but she was too tall for the part! That is OK for stage and you can get past such minor annoyances, but on the big screen it is hard to get around visual appearances. Dunst did a great acting job though, her Beth made me cry harder than all the rest of them. Very believable and heart renching. The dual-Amy bit was irritating. One actress would have been preferable over splitting it between two actresses.

22836,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,0767851013,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[3, 5]","I was a little anxious before the projection of Australian director Gillian Armstrong's LITTLE WOMEN. I vaguely remembered the 1949 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Amy and that was about all I could say about that classic of American literature. Two hours later, everybody was happy, my wife and my daughter had their share of emotions and Kleenex and I had at least understood why such a smart director as Gillian Armstrong who directed MY BRILLIANT CAREER and MRS. SOFFEL, two movies about strong women characters, got interested in directing LITTLE WOMEN.In my opinion, the director wished, by describing the lives of these four sisters, to portray four historical phases of the status of the women in the western society. Claire Danes as Beth is the model of these women who, for centuries, waited that their family chose a husband for them and, often, didn't marry because they were too poor or because they had to take care of their aging parents. Meg portrays the woman who has the chance to marry the man she's in love with, a man accepted by the family even if he doesn't give to Meg the possibility to rise socially : it's the classic marriage who's gained more and more popularity from the mid XIXth century. The third phase of this allegory is portrayed by Amy, a woman who knows from the start on that she will marry a wealthy man who'll support her and, at least, we have Jo who doesn't care to marry a poor man as long as this man won't stop her doing what she wants during her life. In this perspective, LITTLE WOMEN can provide some pleasure even to those of us who don't specially like this kind of classic family movie.A DVD zone use your head.",4,THE  MOVIE  BEHIND  THE  MOVIE,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,1664,"['was', 'little', 'anxious', 'projection', 'Australian', 'director', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'vaguely', 'remembered', '1949', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Amy', 'was', 'could', 'say', 'classic', 'American', 'literature', 'Two', 'hours', 'later', 'everybody', 'was', 'happy', 'wife', 'daughter', 'had', 'share', 'emotions', 'Kleenex', 'had', 'least', 'understood', 'why', 'smart', 'director', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'directed', 'MY', 'BRILLIANT', 'CAREER', 'MRS.', 'SOFFEL', 'two', 'movies', 'strong', 'women', 'characters', 'got', 'interested', 'directing', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN.In', 'opinion', 'director', 'wished', 'describing', 'lives', 'four', 'sisters', 'portray', 'four', 'historical', 'phases', 'status', 'women', 'western', 'society', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Beth', 'model', 'women', 'who', 'centuries', 'waited', 'family', 'chose', 'husband', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'marry', 'were', 'too', 'poor', 'had', 'take', 'care', 'aging', 'parents', 'Meg', 'woman', 'who', 'chance', 'marry', 'man', 'love', 'man', 'accepted', 'family', 'even', ""n't"", 'give', 'Meg', 'possibility', 'rise', 'socially', 'classic', 'marriage', 'who', 'gained', 'more', 'more', 'popularity', 'mid', 'XIXth', 'century', 'third', 'phase', 'allegory', 'portrayed', 'Amy', 'woman', 'who', 'start', 'will', 'marry', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', ""'ll"", 'support', 'least', 'have', 'Jo', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'marry', 'poor', 'man', 'as', 'long', 'man', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'doing', 'what', 'life', 'perspective', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'can', 'provide', 'pleasure', 'even', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'specially', 'kind', 'classic', 'family', 'movie.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'use', 'head']",N/A

22840,AE12AEJFCOGGY,0767851013,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[14, 16]","There is an old maxim in Hollywood that good books make bad movies.  It's only in filming lousy books that you have a chance to make a good picture.  Nowhere has the lie been put to that old saw better than with this picture,  the fourth (and best) film adaptation of Lousia May Alcott's beloved novel.  This is one good book that has made a great film, one of the most charming  and delightful I have seen in a long time.The story revolves around the  four March girls, all of them bright, beautiful and talented.  Jo (Winona  Ryder) is the narrator-and the author of the story-and the primary focus of  the plot.  She is an aspiring writer who is afraid to give voice to her  heart.  Rather than write about her innermost thoughts and feelings, she  squanders her talent writing lurid melodramas and purple tales of romance  and intrigue.  It is only when she gives in to her muse and puts her true  passion into her work that she finds fulfillment.Next in age is Beth  (Clare Danes), a quiet girl plagued by ill health.  When she sits at the  piano, you forget her frailty, captivated by the beautiful music she makes.  She is  a lonely girl, not as ambitious as her sisters.  The only thing  she wants from life is to stay home, protected by the loving embrace of her  family, especially her beloved mother Marney (Susan Sarandon).Youngest  is Amy (Kirsten Dunn as a child, Samantha Mathis later), a charming little  child who grows into a lovely young woman and a promising artist.  She is  the one who has the clearest picture of her future.  No matter what, she is  going to marry a man with money.The oldest girl, Meg (Trini Alvarado)  is the odd one out.  She is not as pretty, smart or gifted as the others.  She is, though, the most refined and proper sister, always concerned with  the girls' behavior.  She is also the one who finds happiness the  quickest.On no fewer than half a dozen occasions while watching  &quot;Little Women,&quot; I found myself on the brink of tears.  It is  certainly a story that evokes strong emotions.  They are emotions, though,  that are genuinely earned.  I was so moved because I cared so much about  the March girls.  When they felt love or joy or sorrow or pain, I felt it  along with them.  That is a tribute to the fine work done by director  Gilian Armstrong, screenwriter Robin Swicord and, especially, these five  wonderful young actresses.It is rare to see a film that deals so  honestly and thoughtfully with the love shared between siblings, especially  if they are women.  These are girls who share a bond that is more important  than marriage or wealth or anything else.  To watch them together, to see  the casual intimacy and obvious affection they share for each other is to  witness something really special.  It is a treat to be allowed, even for  such a short period of time, to be part of their family.  &quot;Little  Women&quot; is an exquisitely beautiful film, and one that I shall not soon  forget.",4,Beautiful Film of a Classic Story,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,2968,"['old', 'maxim', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'books', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'only', 'filming', 'lousy', 'books', 'have', 'chance', 'make', 'good', 'picture', 'Nowhere', 'lie', 'been', 'put', 'old', 'saw', 'better', 'picture', 'fourth', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Lousia', 'May', 'Alcott', 'beloved', 'novel', 'one', 'good', 'book', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'delightful', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'story', 'four', 'March', 'girls', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Jo', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'narrator-and', 'author', 'story-and', 'primary', 'focus', 'plot', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'who', 'afraid', 'give', 'voice', 'heart', 'Rather', 'write', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'talent', 'writing', 'lurid', 'melodramas', 'purple', 'tales', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'only', 'when', 'muse', 'true', 'passion', 'work', 'fulfillment.Next', 'age', 'Beth', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'quiet', 'girl', 'plagued', 'ill', 'health', 'When', 'piano', 'forget', 'frailty', 'captivated', 'beautiful', 'music', 'lonely', 'girl', 'not', 'as', 'ambitious', 'sisters', 'only', 'thing', 'life', 'stay', 'home', 'protected', 'loving', 'embrace', 'family', 'especially', 'beloved', 'mother', 'Marney', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', '.Youngest', 'Amy', 'Kirsten', 'Dunn', 'child', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'later', 'charming', 'little', 'child', 'who', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'promising', 'artist', 'one', 'who', 'clearest', 'picture', 'future', 'matter', 'what', 'going', 'marry', 'man', 'money.The', 'oldest', 'girl', 'Meg', 'Trini', 'Alvarado', 'odd', 'one', 'out', 'not', 'pretty', 'smart', 'gifted', 'others', 'though', 'most', 'refined', 'proper', 'sister', 'always', 'concerned', 'girls', 'behavior', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'happiness', 'quickest.On', 'fewer', 'dozen', 'occasions', 'watching', 'quot', 'Little', 'Women', 'quot', 'found', 'brink', 'tears', 'certainly', 'story', 'strong', 'emotions', 'are', 'emotions', 'though', 'are', 'genuinely', 'earned', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'March', 'girls', 'When', 'felt', 'love', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'pain', 'felt', 'along', 'tribute', 'fine', 'work', 'done', 'director', 'Gilian', 'Armstrong', 'screenwriter', 'Robin', 'Swicord', 'especially', 'five', 'wonderful', 'young', 'actresses.It', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'honestly', 'thoughtfully', 'love', 'shared', 'siblings', 'especially', 'are', 'women', 'are', 'girls', 'who', 'share', 'bond', 'more', 'important', 'marriage', 'wealth', 'anything', 'else', 'watch', 'together', 'see', 'casual', 'intimacy', 'obvious', 'affection', 'share', 'other', 'witness', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'treat', 'be', 'allowed', 'even', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'quot', 'Little', 'Women', 'quot', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'film', 'one', 'shall', 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",N/A

As Jo's sisters, Trini Alvarado (Meg), Claire Danes (Beth) and Kirsten Dunst (the young Amy) give strong, if sometimes uneven, performances.

22843,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0767851013,Deborah Earle,"[2, 3]","This 1994 retelling of the Louisa May Alcott classic glows with a warmth and radiance of a terrific cast. This production was lovingly dedicated to kidnap-murder victim Polly Klass, who had considered the novel to be her favorite, and on whose behalf, as it is well-known, Winona Ryder, a former resident of Klaas' neighborhood, helped in the search.The flaws of the film are that it occassionally goes out of sequence; those familiar with the book know that Beth does live to become an aunt, and it doesn't go into full detail on the subject of Amy's will, although that topic is beautifully covered in one short sequence.Susan Sarandon's Marmee has a staid, dignified charisma as a free-thinking woman dealing with many tribulations but who does a superb job of bringing up her four girls alone while their father is at war.Trini Alvarado is a surprising choice for the part of the older sister, Meg. But she is very much up to the challenge. We see her as a fine, strong, principaled young woman who craves the things girls traditionally crave, but who is tempered by the moral guidance of her mother.Winona Ryder is perfect as the tomboyish writer, Jo. Her spunk and cheerfulness are sheer delight as she portrays a young woman ahead of her time in so many ways. She is plucky and rescourceful in some pretty unconventional ways at times as she helps the family through its hardships.Clare Danes' Beth, the quiet, ill-fated sister, is warm and generous as a middle child who honors the strenghth and nobility of her mother and sisters during her short time on Earth.Effervescent little Kirsten Dunst, gives spark to young Amy March, and Samantha Mathis who has the acting genes of her talented grandmother, Gusti Huber, lends a graceful maturity and radiant beauty to the older Amy.In one of her final roles, Mary Wilkes, ia a rather crotchety Aunt March, who seems to enjoy the company of her young nieces, but who refuses to overindulge them with her wealth despite their poverty. Florence Patterson is the March's wise and emotional housekeeper, Hannah. Christian Bale's Laurie is impish and understated, John Neville is his reserved, but ultimately generous grandfather. Eric Stolz provides a pleasant presence as John Brook. Matthew Walker isn't given much to do as Mr. March, but somehow, it doesn't seem to matter. Gabriel Byrne is much more handsome than Alcott's description of Professor Bhaer, and his portrayal, like that of the principal characters, is one of effortless warmth.The sets and colors seem authentic, and the film's appeal is that the cast really brings them alive. We can easily share the laughter and tears of this family and we don't feel that they are some archaic prudes from a very different time. The fact that I can see a bit of myself in each of the sisters makes this story as relevant today as it was a century ago.",5,A Warm and Loving Recreation of A Classic,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,2855,"['1994', 'retelling', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'classic', 'glows', 'warmth', 'radiance', 'terrific', 'cast', 'production', 'was', 'lovingly', 'dedicated', 'kidnap-murder', 'victim', 'Polly', 'Klass', 'who', 'had', 'considered', 'novel', 'be', 'favorite', 'behalf', 'well-known', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'former', 'resident', 'Klaas', 'neighborhood', 'helped', 'search.The', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'occassionally', 'sequence', 'familiar', 'book', 'know', 'Beth', 'live', 'become', 'aunt', ""n't"", 'go', 'full', 'detail', 'subject', 'Amy', 'will', 'topic', 'beautifully', 'covered', 'one', 'short', 'sequence.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Marmee', 'staid', 'dignified', 'charisma', 'free-thinking', 'woman', 'dealing', 'many', 'tribulations', 'who', 'superb', 'job', 'bringing', 'up', 'four', 'girls', 'alone', 'father', 'war.Trini', 'Alvarado', 'surprising', 'choice', 'part', 'older', 'sister', 'Meg', 'very', 'much', 'challenge', 'see', 'fine', 'strong', 'principaled', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'things', 'girls', 'traditionally', 'crave', 'who', 'tempered', 'moral', 'guidance', 'mother.Winona', 'Ryder', 'perfect', 'tomboyish', 'writer', 'Jo', 'spunk', 'cheerfulness', 'are', 'sheer', 'delight', 'young', 'woman', 'ahead', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'plucky', 'rescourceful', 'pretty', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'times', 'family', 'hardships.Clare', 'Danes', 'Beth', 'quiet', 'ill-fated', 'sister', 'warm', 'generous', 'middle', 'child', 'who', 'strenghth', 'nobility', 'mother', 'sisters', 'short', 'time', 'Earth.Effervescent', 'little', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'spark', 'young', 'Amy', 'March', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'who', 'acting', 'genes', 'talented', 'grandmother', 'Gusti', 'Huber', 'graceful', 'maturity', 'radiant', 'beauty', 'older', 'Amy.In', 'one', 'final', 'roles', 'Mary', 'Wilkes', 'ia', 'rather', 'crotchety', 'Aunt', 'March', 'who', 'enjoy', 'company', 'young', 'nieces', 'who', 'overindulge', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'Florence', 'Patterson', 'March', 'wise', 'emotional', 'housekeeper', 'Hannah', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Laurie', 'impish', 'understated', 'John', 'Neville', 'reserved', 'ultimately', 'generous', 'grandfather', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'pleasant', 'presence', 'John', 'Brook', 'Matthew', 'Walker', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'Mr.', 'March', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'much', 'more', 'handsome', 'Alcott', 'description', 'Professor', 'Bhaer', 'portrayal', 'principal', 'characters', 'one', 'effortless', 'warmth.The', 'sets', 'colors', 'seem', 'authentic', 'film', 'appeal', 'cast', 'really', 'alive', 'can', 'easily', 'share', 'laughter', 'tears', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'archaic', 'prudes', 'very', 'different', 'time', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'bit', 'sisters', 'story', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', 'century', 'ago']",N/A

22848,A1CUQT847I9NHB,0767851013,Donna Hill,"[0, 0]","When I watched this remake of Little Women for the first time I remember that I was a bit disappointed. Artistic license was taken throughout the movie downplaying religion, inserting feminism, and changing characters in various ways, so that one might very well ask, ""Is this really Little Women?"" But the movie remains in my library and I can't tell you how many times I've watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I cry every time. Each time I wonder do I have another tear left for this movie? And sure enough, before I know it I'm a basket case--what a catharsis! One downside--soft voices and subtitles--I prefer voices I can hear and no subtitles!The cinematography is breathtaking, the music haunting and lovely, and the characters grow on you. So what if they made Marmee into a feminist or that Winona Ryder, as Jo, is far too pretty so that one must almost laugh when she laments that she's ugly and awkward. So what if Claire Danes as Beth is a healthy-looking girl or that Kirsten Dunst as young Amy is childish? Somehow you grow to love these characters. And you'll cry when Beth dies whether you feel that she looks frail enough for the part or not. And, oh, don't tell me that Gabriel Byrne as Mr. Bhaer doesn't make a wonderful suitor! He knocks this 66-year-old lady's socks off! He's handsome and yet European enough to make you believe, whether he has the German accent right or not, that he's a professor, a bit different, someone whom our free-thinking Jo can love.So although artistic license is taken, this movie still resembles the book and adults and children of all ages can enjoy it. I have one criticism of a small detail which seems important to the story. It's not made at all clear as to why Jo is trying to hide out at the dance--no mention is made of the fact that the back of her dress is scorched from standing too close to the fireplace. And when Laurie looks at the back of her dress, one wonders why unless one, of course, has read the book. I loved the book as a child and read it many times, but I'm well aware that some of our young people may not have read the book. They have added things to the movie that aren't in the book and taken things out. But, still, the bottom line is that the moral values are excellent, the story is heartwarming, the characters are endearing, and it will tug at your heartstrings.I tried to do a review of the 1949 Little Women and the powers that be stated that I'd already done a review, so I don't think it's possible to do separate reviews for the various versions of Little Women. So I'll just state here that all the versions have something good to offer. I can't say much about the TV movie with Meredith Baxter Birney and Susan Dey because I saw it just once many years ago. I remember that it was hard for me to really get into that movie, though, because the actors were so familiar to me. I am one of those rare individuals who hasn't seen Winona Ryder in other productions and I will even admit that I'm not much of an old movie buff or even a movie buff at all so I haven't seen a lot of Katherine Hepburn. Katherine Hepburn is the perfect Jo, I feel; she is a wonderful Jo. In fact, she is my favorite part of the 1933 version, with the women who play Beth and Amy tying for second place. The 1933 version overdoes the playacting. The singing is atrocious and it's just not the type of thing you want to watch over and over. You tend to want to fast forward. I think the 1949 version is almost perfect and would perhaps be even more so if Katherine Hepburn were Jo. June Allyson is wonderful. But Hepburn is quintessential Jo even though she is almost too beautiful for the part. But she can make the funniest faces which compensate for her overall beauty. She can actually make herself look very homely just by mugging for the camera. The 1949 and 1933 versions stick more closely to the book which, let's face it, makes more sense especially when you have read the book. I loved the book, and I think that if I would have seen the 1994 version as a child I would have been rather disappointed--I would have wondered what happened to Little Women. But I will admit that as an adult I really enjoy the cinematography and the music of the 1994 version. It never grows old. It's just a feast for the eyes and ears. Little Women is a beautiful story for children and adults and I just can't say enough about how wonderful it is that it has been brought to the screen so many times--each time in a slightly different way.",5,A Beautiful Remake of Little Women,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,4502,"['When', 'watched', 'remake', 'Little', 'Women', 'first', 'time', 'remember', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Artistic', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'movie', 'downplaying', 'religion', 'inserting', 'feminism', 'changing', 'characters', 'various', 'ways', 'one', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'ask', 'really', 'Little', 'Women', 'movie', 'library', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'cry', 'time', 'time', 'wonder', 'do', 'have', 'tear', 'left', 'movie', 'sure', 'enough', 'know', ""'m"", 'basket', 'case', 'what', 'catharsis', 'One', 'downside', 'soft', 'voices', 'subtitles', 'prefer', 'voices', 'can', 'hear', 'subtitles', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'music', 'haunting', 'lovely', 'characters', 'grow', 'So', 'what', 'made', 'Marmee', 'feminist', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jo', 'far', 'too', 'pretty', 'so', 'one', 'must', 'almost', 'when', 'ugly', 'awkward', 'So', 'what', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Beth', 'healthy-looking', 'girl', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'young', 'Amy', 'childish', 'Somehow', 'grow', 'love', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'when', 'Beth', 'feel', 'frail', 'enough', 'part', 'not', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Mr.', 'Bhaer', ""n't"", 'make', 'wonderful', 'suitor', '66-year-old', 'lady', 'socks', 'handsome', 'yet', 'European', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'German', 'accent', 'right', 'not', 'professor', 'bit', 'different', 'someone', 'whom', 'free-thinking', 'Jo', 'can', 'love.So', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'movie', 'still', 'book', 'adults', 'children', 'ages', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'one', 'criticism', 'small', 'detail', 'important', 'story', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'why', 'Jo', 'trying', 'hide', 'out', 'dance', 'mention', 'made', 'fact', 'back', 'dress', 'scorched', 'standing', 'too', 'close', 'fireplace', 'when', 'Laurie', 'back', 'dress', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'one', 'course', 'read', 'book', 'loved', 'book', 'child', 'read', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'well', 'aware', 'young', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'added', 'things', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'book', 'taken', 'things', 'out', 'still', 'bottom', 'line', 'moral', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings.I', 'tried', 'do', 'review', '1949', 'Little', 'Women', 'powers', 'be', 'stated', ""'d"", 'already', 'done', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'do', 'separate', 'reviews', 'various', 'versions', 'Little', 'Women', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'state', 'here', 'versions', 'have', 'something', 'good', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'TV', 'movie', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'Birney', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'saw', 'just', 'once', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'was', 'hard', 'really', 'get', 'movie', 'though', 'actors', 'were', 'so', 'familiar', 'am', 'one', 'rare', 'individuals', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'other', 'productions', 'will', 'even', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'old', 'movie', 'buff', 'even', 'movie', 'buff', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'perfect', 'Jo', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'Jo', 'fact', 'favorite', 'part', '1933', 'version', 'women', 'who', 'play', 'Beth', 'Amy', 'tying', 'second', 'place', '1933', 'version', 'playacting', 'singing', 'atrocious', 'just', 'not', 'type', 'thing', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'tend', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'think', '1949', 'version', 'almost', 'perfect', 'would', 'perhaps', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'were', 'Jo', 'June', 'Allyson', 'wonderful', 'Hepburn', 'quintessential', 'Jo', 'even', 'almost', 'too', 'beautiful', 'part', 'can', 'make', 'funniest', 'compensate', 'overall', 'beauty', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'herself', 'look', 'very', 'homely', 'just', 'mugging', 'camera', '1949', '1933', 'versions', 'stick', 'more', 'closely', 'book', 'let', 'face', 'more', 'sense', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'loved', 'book', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'seen', '1994', 'version', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'would', 'have', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'Little', 'Women', 'will', 'admit', 'adult', 'really', 'enjoy', 'cinematography', 'music', '1994', 'version', 'never', 'old', 'just', 'feast', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Little', 'Women', 'beautiful', 'story', 'children', 'adults', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'wonderful', 'been', 'brought', 'screen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'time', 'slightly', 'different', 'way']",N/A

Afterwards, I immediately polished off the novel, and saw the subsequent film adaptations.  This 1994 production, directed by Gillian Armstrong (MY BRILLIANT CAREER), is a beautifully acted, lusciously filmed and engaging film triumph.  We watch the trials and triumphs of the March family, through the eyes of the four March sisters.  Meg (Trini Alvarado), Jo (Winonah Ryder), Beth (Claire Danes) and Amy (Kirsten Dunst) live with their mother in a little town in Pennsylvania and are awaiting the return of their father's return from war, where is he is serving as a chaplain in the Union Army.  All four girls have very distinctive personalities that vary greatly from one another, and their mother (Susan Sarandon) is nothing short of their rock, in the face of many, many hardships the family must face together.For all of you Louisa May Alcott fans, I would say that this film stayed very true to the novel and the actresses truly embody the beautiful characters from the story.  Winonah Ryder earned a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal of Jo March, the headstrong tomboy with a hot temper and a passion for writing.  This character was actually based on Louisa May Alcott, during her formative years.  What's more, the plot is based largely on vignettes from Alcott's life as a young girl, growing up in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

However Gillian Armstrong's film is a charming piece - beautifully photographed with a strong sense of seasonal change and how the March family react to such changes.  The lighting - both natural and artificial - is soft yet atmospheric, the use of music unobtrusive yet significant.  Yet Armstrong does not want to produce a heritage film, prompting viewers to admire the historically accurate sets and costumes; on the contrary, her approach remains strongly character-focused, with the attention paid to nuances of performances.  Winona Ryder gives perhaps the best performance of her entire career as Jo; her command of gesture and facial expression is impeccable, especially at those moments of extreme disappointment (for example, when she is told that her first book manuscript is actually no good).  A young Kirsten Dunst is both childlike yet mature as Amy; someone who wants to act grown-up yet yearns for her father to be around.  Susan Sarandon turns in a winning performance as the matriarch of the family; someone who is incredibly fond of her offspring, yet well aware of their individual faults.  The ending might be sentimental, but Armstrong is nonetheless well aware of the economic hardships experienced by the March family as they struggle to survive while their father is away fighting.

22855,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,0767851013,Einsatz,"[2, 2]","Previous film versions of Little Women carefully avoided all mention of Alcott's political interests as an abolitionist and a feminist.  This version, however, shoves them right in your face and never lets you forget them.  When Marmee (Susan Sarandon) delivers her first feminist lecture it comes off sounding more like a commercial than anything you're likely to hear during the course of a normal conversation.  In fact, all of Sarandon's speeches sound like formal addresses one might hear in some lecture hall as opposed to one's home where all of Marmee's views would certainly have been known by rote.  Nothing about these rants is subtle.  Unfortunately, long after they've made their point, they're still relentlessly hammering home their single-minded message, just in case a viewer might have missed or forgotten them.  I found this approach jarring and unwelcomed.  As for the rest of the story, they touch on the same events as all the other adaptations but in a roundabout fashion, adding things, misplacing other key elements.

Many of the traits that gave Louisa May Alcott's characters their charm were either played down or eliminated entirely.Several other reviewers have amply treated the artificial, excessive feminism, and I agree with their viewpoints - in fact, it would have been annoying even in a film set in the year 2001. As well, it seemed that the vaguely bitter, obligatory feminism ruined the depiction of the girls themselves.One of Louisa's most clever, concise parts of her book was the opening, wherein the conversations between the four sisters give the reader an excellent introduction to each of their characters. This scene, for reasons unknown, was eliminated - and, as later action would show, the girls, from tomboy Jo to forgivably vain Meg, are not to be permitted any traits that detract from a perfectly politically correct image.For example, as a child reading the Alcott book, I most identified with Meg without having her prettiness - enjoying fine things, rather vain, envious of wealthier friends. When we first &quot;meet&quot; her in the book, she is pining for a silk dress (which her mother will not allow her until she is 18), and, in the later &quot;party&quot; sequence, Meg greatly enjoys being prettied until she overhears an elder acquaintance saying she'd been made a fool of. The film's Meg is an odd combination of Puritan and political activist - wanting to be pretty or well-dressed must be pass&eacute;, she feels dreadful guilt about the (innocent) party, and she cannot wear silk because of the treatment of workers in China!Though I myself am far from puritanical, and found some of the book's depictions of sacrifice to be puzzling (for example, how does denying one's self a small Christmas gift do anything for the soldiers?), one of the book's strongest themes is religious - witness the constant references to Pilgrim's Progress. One wonders, with this film, just why the sisters are so apparently deprived.The photography is excellent, and sometimes stunning, and I imagine that those unfamiliar with the book will want this video on their shelves because it is &quot;for the whole family.&quot; But don't obtain this one for anyone who has ever loved the original Little Women.",2,I'll admit the photography was lovely...,1008633600,"12 18, 2001",2001,2251,"['barely', 'recognised', 'story', 'Many', 'traits', 'gave', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'characters', 'charm', 'were', 'either', 'played', 'down', 'eliminated', 'entirely.Several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'amply', 'treated', 'artificial', 'excessive', 'feminism', 'agree', 'viewpoints', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'annoying', 'even', 'film', 'set', 'year', '2001', 'well', 'seemed', 'vaguely', 'bitter', 'obligatory', 'feminism', 'ruined', 'depiction', 'girls', 'themselves.One', 'Louisa', 'most', 'clever', 'concise', 'parts', 'book', 'was', 'opening', 'wherein', 'conversations', 'four', 'sisters', 'give', 'reader', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'characters', 'scene', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'was', 'eliminated', 'later', 'action', 'would', 'show', 'girls', 'tomboy', 'Jo', 'forgivably', 'vain', 'Meg', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'permitted', 'traits', 'detract', 'perfectly', 'politically', 'correct', 'image.For', 'example', 'child', 'reading', 'Alcott', 'book', 'most', 'identified', 'Meg', 'having', 'prettiness', 'enjoying', 'fine', 'things', 'rather', 'vain', 'envious', 'wealthier', 'friends', 'When', 'first', 'quot', 'meet', 'quot', 'book', 'pining', 'silk', 'dress', 'mother', 'will', 'not', 'allow', '18', 'later', 'quot', 'party', 'quot', 'sequence', 'Meg', 'greatly', 'being', 'prettied', 'elder', 'acquaintance', 'saying', ""'d"", 'been', 'made', 'fool', 'film', 'Meg', 'odd', 'combination', 'Puritan', 'political', 'activist', 'wanting', 'be', 'pretty', 'well-dressed', 'must', 'be', 'pass', 'eacute', 'dreadful', 'guilt', 'innocent', 'party', 'can', 'not', 'wear', 'silk', 'treatment', 'workers', 'China', 'am', 'far', 'puritanical', 'found', 'book', 'depictions', 'sacrifice', 'be', 'puzzling', 'example', 'how', 'denying', 'one', 'small', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'do', 'anything', 'soldiers', 'one', 'book', 'strongest', 'themes', 'religious', 'witness', 'constant', 'references', 'Pilgrim', 'Progress', 'One', 'wonders', 'film', 'just', 'why', 'sisters', 'are', 'so', 'apparently', 'deprived.The', 'photography', 'excellent', 'sometimes', 'stunning', 'imagine', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'will', 'want', 'video', 'shelves', 'quot', 'whole', 'family.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'obtain', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'loved', 'original', 'Little', 'Women']",N/A

This results in many small but enjoyable scenes being cut or compressed, and some characters (Laurie's grandfather, for instance) all but ignored.  Moreover, the second book, Good Wives, is more uneven and less enjoyable than Little Women--too sprawling and pat--which drags the second half of the film down.Generally the performances are quite good.  I like Winona Ryder's fiestiness and humour as Jo, although I feel that she was physically a little too pretty and delicate.  Claire Danes was a disappointment, although she's usually very reliable.  Her Beth was properly shy, but not soft and capable as she should be. Her retincence seemed almost like a mental handicap.  Trini Alvarado was great as Meg, she really seemed like a product of that era, and Kirsten Dunst had Amy pretty much down pat.  Samantha Mathis, playing the older Amy was all wrong though, too old to be only four years older (she looked older than Ryder) and far, far too stilted.  Gabriel Byrne's professor was the perfect antidote to Christian Bale's Laurie, too.

The four sisters are a pleasure to watch and view as they develop into young ladies who experience both the pleasures and pains of growing into adulthood. The film depicts the changes in each character from adolescence and the growing pains associated with making independent decisions based on their personalities and values. As young ladies with education who grew up in a household where their opinions were heard and mattered, they stand in direct contrast with the majority of girls growing up at that time ...In the attic, the sisters enact all the parts of a play which Jo had written ... it was a great moment when they invited Theodore Lawrence into their circle of friends. The individuality of each sister is quite evident. The film does a fine job of presenting each character, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy as unique individuals who blossom, each into her own personality, when they are forced to make choices and deal with building their own lives. The film shows the flow of everyday life around the time of the Civil War, when their father was serving as a soldier. The film does a wonderful job of showing the social structure and class differences of the era. The language, speech and manners of the times are well acted ...The close bonds of sisterhood are threatened by Beth's illness, and eventual death. The film presents Jo, Meg and Amy as they develop into responsible adults with independent lives and interests apart from the cocoon of the family. Meg's courtship and eventual marriage to a school teacher/tutor is done well, especially the birth of their twins. Amy's ambitions of marrying into wealth and becoming a lady, and the value conflicts associated with this desire when she meets Theodore Lawrence in Paris is superbly done. Jo's move to live in New York at a boarding house, broadens her life experiences as she is challenged by Frederick, a German professor she bumps into by chance. Her wings are spread as she learns to fly solo within this new and challenging environment. Despite their differences, the sisters are forever connected by the bonds of family and love which makes the book and film an enduring classic.

Times are tough, money is scarce, and needs are many. But these women valiantly work hard at continuing their studies while trying to survive.Louisa May Alcott wrote about young women overcoming character flaws. The March girls are: Meg, who is vain, Jo who is hot tempered and stubborn, Beth who is introverted and shy, and the youngest, Any who is selfish and vindictive.Jo, played by Winona Ryder, is an outspoken, vivacious, playful dreamer, who wants to become a writer. A very young Kirsten Dunst plays the part of the younger daughter, so selfish and vindictive that because she does not have a ticket to go to the theatre with her sisters, she destroys a story her sister Jo was writing.The movie is set in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the scenic beauty of this film is magnificent.

22863,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,0767851013,Frodo,"[3, 4]","""Little Women"" has been a personal favourite of mine for many years now. It is a beautiful reflection on the simple, yet equally important things in life, like love, family and ambition. Featuring wonderful performances from a star-studded cast, beautiful cinematography and tranquil music, ""Little Women"" has remained one of my favourite films of all time.Based on the novel by Louisa May Aclott, ""Little Women"" follows the lives of the four March sisters: Amy (Kirsten Dunst and Samantha Mavis), Beth (Claire Danes), Meg (Trini Alvarado) and the main character Jo (Winona Ryder). Following the absence of their father, who is serving in the war, the March sisters stick together, their bond strong. The story takes us on the individual journeys of each sister, especially Jo, an apsiring writing who wants nothing more to make it in the world dominated by men. Through boy-trouble, peer pressure, and a personal tragedy that rocks the family, Jo and her sisters try their best to stick together as a family. ""Little Women"" shows us the bittersweet transition from childhood to adulthood.The performances in the film are inspired. Susan Surrandon stars as the girls' kind and loving mother, and as usual portrays her character beautifully. Winona Ryder gained an Oscar nomination for this film, but the true star of the film, in my opinion is Claire Danes. Her role in the film, although being the least explored of the four girls, is so powerful and evokative, coming from just a 14-year-old Danes. A somewhat younger Kirsten Dunst is flawless as the young Amy March, though I must say that I disaproved of the casting of the older Amy, Samantha Mavis. Her performance was unbelievable, let alone the fact that she did not look anything like her younger self. Despite this the acting was very well done.The scenery is absolutely stunning! I simply love the images of the heavy snow, the golden Fall, the cosiness of the candle-lit living room. The scenery really draws you into this 18th century world, and gives you a wonderful fuzzy feeling inside.The music, personally is one of my favourite movie scores ever. Composer Thomas Newman blends tranquil string meleodies, with elements of oboe and a particularly heart-wrenching piano-solo (to name a few highlights), to really bring out the pureness of this movie and its morals. The music adds character and feeling to every scene, as every score does, and its simply gorgeous!My only reservations for this film would be that its final forty-minutes or so does not evoke that ""magicalness"" of the rest of the film. However, there are nevertheless some shining scenes, one of which I cry in every single time I watch it! (I shall not say what it is, or I will spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it!)So in conclusion, the acting, cinematography and music combined make this film one of my favourites. Despite some mismatches in role-casting and editiing, I believe this is a near-flawless film, and certainly one of the best adaptations of a classic novel there's ever been.",5,A truly beautiful film,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3026,"['Little', 'Women', 'been', 'personal', 'favourite', 'mine', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'beautiful', 'reflection', 'simple', 'yet', 'equally', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'love', 'family', 'ambition', 'Featuring', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'tranquil', 'music', 'Little', 'Women', 'remained', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', 'time.Based', 'novel', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Aclott', 'Little', 'Women', 'lives', 'four', 'March', 'sisters', 'Amy', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Samantha', 'Mavis', 'Beth', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Meg', 'Trini', 'Alvarado', 'main', 'character', 'Jo', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Following', 'absence', 'father', 'who', 'serving', 'war', 'March', 'sisters', 'stick', 'together', 'bond', 'strong', 'story', 'individual', 'journeys', 'sister', 'especially', 'Jo', 'apsiring', 'writing', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'make', 'world', 'dominated', 'men', 'boy-trouble', 'peer', 'pressure', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'family', 'Jo', 'sisters', 'try', 'best', 'stick', 'together', 'family', 'Little', 'Women', 'bittersweet', 'transition', 'childhood', 'adulthood.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'inspired', 'Susan', 'Surrandon', 'girls', 'kind', 'loving', 'mother', 'usual', 'character', 'beautifully', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'gained', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'true', 'star', 'film', 'opinion', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'role', 'film', 'being', 'least', 'explored', 'four', 'girls', 'so', 'powerful', 'evokative', 'coming', 'just', '14-year-old', 'Danes', 'A', 'somewhat', 'younger', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'flawless', 'young', 'Amy', 'March', 'must', 'say', 'disaproved', 'casting', 'older', 'Amy', 'Samantha', 'Mavis', 'performance', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'let', 'alone', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'anything', 'younger', 'self', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'simply', 'love', 'images', 'heavy', 'snow', 'golden', 'Fall', 'cosiness', 'candle-lit', 'living', 'room', 'scenery', 'really', '18th', 'century', 'world', 'wonderful', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'inside.The', 'music', 'personally', 'one', 'favourite', 'movie', 'scores', 'ever', 'Composer', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'tranquil', 'string', 'meleodies', 'elements', 'oboe', 'particularly', 'heart-wrenching', 'piano-solo', 'name', 'few', 'highlights', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'pureness', 'movie', 'morals', 'music', 'character', 'feeling', 'scene', 'score', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'only', 'reservations', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'forty-minutes', 'so', 'not', 'evoke', 'magicalness', 'rest', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'shining', 'scenes', 'one', 'cry', 'single', 'time', 'watch', 'shall', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'So', 'conclusion', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'music', 'combined', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'favourites', 'mismatches', 'role-casting', 'editiing', 'believe', 'near-flawless', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'novel', 'ever', 'been']",N/A

22875,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,0767851013,JJ,"[7, 11]","This movie is horribly written, horribly cast, horribly directed and poorly acted. It seems that they just took several young actresses popular at the time and dumped them into the movie with no thought at all about whether or not they fit the part or were capable of playing the roles. I think it is interesting to note that none of the actresses playing the sisters have had successful careers. None of them became big stars. The movie leaves out some of the best scenes in the book completely. One of the most touching things in the book is the relationship between Beth and Mr. Lawrence - totally ignored here. And, Beth is just too big for the role, not gentle enough. There is no really clearly drawn difference in the sisters. For several scenes I couldn't tell Meg and Jo apart. Now, if you never read the book I guess you might enjoy this movie but if you have read the book, many times as I have, then you are going to be horrified. Winona Ryder is a joke as Jo and all the other sisters are also terrible casting. There was no narrative by Jo in the book so why have they dragged it in here. I won't even mention Eric Stoltz as Mr. Brook. Somebody must have been on drugs when they cast him in that role. The movie skips over a lot of things that are important to character development and to the story. It's like a caricature of the story made to sell tickets to young people who have never read any book much less this one.  The scenes where Jo kisses Professor Baer at the opera and in the boarding house are ridiculous. No well brought up young woman in that time would dream of doing such a thing.  A kiss would have been permitted only if they were formally engaged. And, if the children's mother caught a glimpse of a romantic relationship between the governess and one of the roomers, Jo would have been out of the house in record time and so would he. Who on earth writes this crap. The nondescript father of the family finally shows up in a couple of scenes but I don't recall him ever saying anything. If you want to see ""Little Women"" then get the original with June Allison as Jo and Peter Lawford as Laurie. Margaret O'Brien just IS Beth. Elizabeth is a really ""dead on"" Amy and Janet Leigh is just right as the very proper Meg.

Winona Ryder does a good job as the independent Jo, the other actresses are also very good in their roles. Susan Sarandon is, alas, wasted in the role of Marmee but pretty much any good actress would be-- Marmee is a 2-dimensional character, all kindliness and charity.  Marmee is not much of a role, and Ms. Sarandon does not try to make it any more than it is because it would not add anything to the story to try to find additional dimensions.  Excellent actress that Ms. Sarandon is, she also knows what an ensemble cast is supposed to be and she does what is needed without upstaging anybody or anything.  If I wanted to go looking for problems in this rendition, I would have to say that the only one would be with Winona Ryder as Jo.  She was really too young to be playing that part, which is more than that of simply a tom-boyish girl awkwardly trying to find herself an identity as a woman.  Winona has done some really fine work in several films, and she certainly isn't bad at all in this one [especially in the beginning of the movie], but she is out of her depth in 1994 playing a young woman in love with a much older man.  Gabriel Byrne is as close to perfect as you can possibly get in his role as Professor Behr, but Winona is hardly more than a teenaged girl and her responses to him are a bit &quot;off&quot;.  I think it's because she was so young here and life experience was working against her for the latter part of the film.  Otherwise, the film was tastefully and artfully done.

22887,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0767851013,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[4, 7]","Jarring Note #1: The screenplay does a disservice to Alcott's book by including many references to women's rights and feminism. Sorry, it's just not in the original work, and you lose a large part of the point of Alcott's message that way: the little women are being taught how to be proper mothers and supports to their husbands, which requires them to work constantly on self-improvement--that's why there are so many references to &quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot; in the novel. If the writers wanted to flesh out Marmee's character more, they might have done what none of the other writes had done yet, which is focus on the curbed volatile temper of Marmee--indeed, Marmee sees Jo as the daughter most like herself.  Jarring Note #2: Beth. I know many reviewers praised this actress's work, but I couldn't get past her height. Beth is usually thought of as fragile and slight; that's why it's not hard to imagine that she might die. This Beth looks like a strapping farm lass; I half expected her to go out and clear a field of heavy rocks. I remember when I saw this in the movies, one of the attending doctors makes a comment about &quot;the child&quot;, to which  one of my companions responded, &quot;Child? What child?&quot; She was completely mystified as to the person being identified. So this Beth has physical volume working against her. Jarring Note #3: Changing Amys. For all the crucial scenes building characters in the first half of the movie, we have one Amy, and then another Amy shows up at Meg's wedding, takes the Grand Tour with Aunt March, and marries Laurie. Huh?  This completely undercuts everything that has gone before. Why not hire just one actress and be done with it? Here also we lose Alcott's intention that  the four sisters are each on a journey of self-improvement. That first Amy didn't get her rightful reward of going to Europe and marrying a rich man. The second Amy says hard things to Laurie in Europe, sitting in judgement on him--well, since you get the impression that they've only just met, who is she to say all those things? He didn't grow up with HER! Bad idea all around.  Still in all, it is a beautifully filmed movie, which included some scenes from the book not in the other movies, like when Meg goes to a society party and is persuaded to act the flirt, only to be horribly embarrassed by Laurie's stern reproof. This is important  in particular because Meg gets short shrift most of the time, and is the least developed cinematically of the sisters.

The question is then, ""Why did we need a new one?""  Although, I am certain the world would not have ended if this version were not made, it is so rich and beautiful to watch it would have made my life a lot more boring without it.I admit, I have not yet read the book, my friend has, and admits that there are some significant differences in this version as compared to the novel (as in the way that Beth passes away), but that they do not detract from the movies enjoyment.The most interesting thing about this film is that if you have watched the commentaries (which are farely decent) and have watched the film close to as much as I have (50+ times), you begin to appreciate it more and more.  The richness in the performances by all of the actors, especially Christian Bale as Laurie and Trina Alvarado as Meg.  Besides the performances, the visuals are a feast to the eyes!  The costume designs are georgeous and the sets are lush and recall a time that was less complicated by housing developments.Even if you cann't enjoy the acting or the costumes the story itself is beautiful.  It tells a tale of the bonds of family, especially between sisters.  Jo is the most spirited of the bunch, and as she says in the beginning of the movie ""Longs for transofrmation"", but at the same time fears change, and does not wish her family to be broken of up her sisters being married off.  She enjoys her fellowship with her sisters as it is; they put on theatricals in their attic and print a periodical with male psuedonyms for themselves where Jo publishes her scandolous stories.  It is the first half of the film that is such a joy to watch, the girls all really feel like they are sister and you feel their pain and their sorrows as if you were there with them.If there is one complaint I have about the film, it is how even when their father returns (and they had been missing him dearly), he feels as though he is not there and as though he lived in the shadows. Also, it does downplay the religious apects (according to my friend) in favor of a more femministic spirit which at times can be somewhat over the top (such as with Marmee's statements about restrictive corsets and nedle work). However, these are my only major qualms with the film.""Little Women"", however, with its timeless celebration of the bonds of family and the fear of change speaks to us today even in a startingly different society with little or no social restrictions.

I had to go out and buy the soundtrack the moment I finished seeing the film! By and large I like the performances, although I didn't think Christian Bale was as convincing as Laurie grew older. Two things that did bother me: Jo saying &quot;you're dead&quot; to Amy after the burning of her book and Marmee being the one to cure Beth. You didn't say &quot;you're dead&quot; and &quot;I'll kill you&quot; in those days as flippantly as we do now.

22892,A2CON4GD056OGB,0767851013,Louisa the Lemming,"[7, 11]","Gillian Anderson's LITTLE WOMEN attempts not so much to capture the essense of Louisa May Alcott's original story as to use it as a springboard.  It might have been better if she had transferred the story to a different time, or otherwise re-framed it so as to give herself more liberty to change things around.  I myself would not have minded a version of LITTLE WOMEN where Laurie and Jo DO run away, Beth sneakily brings in much needed cash as dance hall pianist, and Professor Bhaer finally learns to mind his own business.  But instead, screenwriter Robin Swicord drains the drama and momentum from the original by pointless alteration, but is still required to hit major plot points, and so cannot create anything new and satisfactory.What made Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN, despite the moralizing, something children have wanted to read for one and a half centures now was its vivid portrait of passionate adolescence: Jo's famous temper, Laurie's rebelliousness, Amy's spite, Meg's longings - even what lurked beneath Beth's shyness.  Anderson jettisons this anger and passion for a genteel and straight-laced Art-House flick about ladylike little feminists.  Alcott famously disparaged her books for children as ""moral pap for the young"", but LITTLE WOMEN had honesty and substance.  Anderson ignores the substance in favor of ""moral pap"" - albeit politically correct and feminist pap - washed down with tony sentimentality.  The only notes of truth are struck by the performances.The girls are just not the same girls, with mixed results.  Kirsten Dunst - fresh from INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE - is a superb child-Amy, but is written as a sly vixen with designs on Laurie, which ruins the honest connection between them that was so important later.  Adult Samantha Mathis plays Amy as a dense zombie.  Trini Alvarado brings tremendous grace and womanliness to Meg, which is really nice actually, except that Meg is supposed to be an unsure adolescent.  Winona Ryder's Jo is interestingly different, which is to say she isn't a rebellious tomboy with a wild temper and a burning literary passion, but a thoughtful-if-pouty wannabe Liberal Arts Major.  Beth is supposed to be a frail girl struggling mightily with her timidity: Claire Daines gives us a sturdy lass placidly devoid of inner conflict.  Thus we must lurch through the plot of LITTLE WOMEN, without getting the Little Women themselves as compensation.Christian Bale, as boy-next-door Laurie, does a good job of suggesting caged wildness, and makes the most of the few poignant lines which are all that is left of Laurie's tempestuous relationship with his grandfather.  But he is just a little too old, too smug, and too smarmy.  Alcott's lonely, emotionally-deprived teenager is barely hinted at.  Rather, he has become a representative of ""Men"", which you know is just not good.  In the book, Laurie's reaction to seeing Meg dolled up like a sexpot was sudden bashfulness and defensive rudeness.  Here he is a suave sexist oaf who sees Meg's new finery as the opportunity for a spot of sexual harassment.  Ew!  Why?  The point of Laurie and Jo's dance, in the book, was to convey the pleasure of meeting a soulmate one could show one's real self to without worrying about being ""presentable"" or ""proper"".  Here, their dance is rendered somewhat awkward by the fact that Jo only knows how to lead.  This alters the whole meaning of the scene, implying Anderson sees it as a power struggle rather than a moment of connection.  And it's so dismally clich&eacute;.  ""Oh, they are both too strong-willed so . . ..""  You know something?  Being weak-willed and knowing how to dance backwards have NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with one another.In the directors's commentary, Anderson describes Alcott's Marmee as the ""perfect"" mother.  She was not!  Anderson obviously doesn't think the March parents were perfect either, as her version replaced Marmee with Susan B. Anthony, and shuts Father up completely.  But instead of admitting it and portraying Marmee as a flawed human being, she simply replaces her own PC notion of perfection for that supposedly offered by Alcott.  Susan Sarandon does as amazing a job as one could possibly wish, considering that she's being asked to play a marble statue instead of a woman.  Some have suggested that Saradon's portrayal would have been more convincing in another era, but I disagree.  Her Marmee says nothing feminists didn't say at the time - in essays and speeches.  Alcott's trashy adventure-potboiler A LONG FATAL LOVE CHASE has quite a few feminist speeches, and as ALFLC is scarcely attempting naturalistic realism, they fit in just fine.  No, it is Marmee's cardboard-cutout supermom-hood which rings false - in any era.There is inherent feminism to be found in Alcott's work, to those interested in Alcott's work.  But those people do not include Anderson and Swicord.  Scene after scene is rewritten to ignore and replace the actual story rather than intepret or illuminate it.  John Brooke takes Meg to the theatre, only to spout stock rubbish about how sinful, immodest and unladylike actresses are.  Writer Jo faces sexist discrimination from New York publishers, and discusses female sufferage with Herr Professor.  Meg and Sally Moffat argue over child silk laborers.  The doctor throws in a line about bleeding, and throws in the towel on a patient who is promptly saved by Super-Marmee.  Amy's doting schoolmaster who very reluctantly struck her for disobedience is now The Sexist Educational Establishment, and is given that line comparing female students to female cats which is scarcely what a poor man who earned his living educating young ladies would say.  Thus generic Victorian clich&eacute;s gleaned from speed-reading a few history books replace the situations created by a woman who was actually THERE, and incidents borrowed from Alcott's life are thrown in without context or point.  I'm surprised nobody found a runaway slave in the oven.  Or did I blink?The script is so ham-handed that on the occasion we do get something of Alcott's, it no longer makes sense.  Take the skating accident.  In the book, Jo is so furious with Amy that she refuses to speak to her, even to warn her of thin ice.  Then she freezes in shock when Amy falls through, leaving the rescue to Laurie.  The line ""How could I be so horrible?  Thank God for Laurie!"" would therefore make perfect sense.  In the FILM, Jo knows nothing about rotten ice, is blameless for Amy's accident, and is as quick to the rescue as Laurie.  But Swicord includes the now-senseless line anyway.  This book chapter ended with Jo's realization that ""perfect"" Marmee had as fiery a temper as Jo herself.  This liberated Jo from her self-loathing and despair, permited her to forgive both herself and Amy, and the chapter ended on a kiss.  The subtextual message is that we manage our darker feelings better when we acknowledge them, that we strangle our ability for love when we don't acknowledge our anger, and that there is no such thing as the perfect woman or mother who lacks the full range of human feelings.  That is more feminist and timeless than whining about corsets, and even has something to do with the plot and characters.  So of course it's not included.Another chapter that would have rewarded feminist interest was when unfashionable Meg allows herself to get nicely dolled up at Moffat's, only to find she has ruined herself in the eyes of conservative acquaintances.  But in the film, Meg looks EXACTLY like all the other girls present, and never hears any censure for crossing an invisible line of modesty.  She merely seems dressed for the occasion.  Yet she allows herself to be thoroughly shamed by Laurie, and (in an even creepier scene) cries repentantly while taking off her makeup.  What could easily have been a commentary on the eternal feminine double-bind instead comes across as a Puritanical slam against femininity itself.  Marmee's advice on modesty, in the BOOK, addressed Meg's need to protect her self-respect and the integrity of her relationships with men in the face of the ""marriage market"" mentality, but she specifically defended Meg's desire for prettiness and admiration as right and harmless.  Anderson's message amounts to ""Men are Beasts, girls!  So COVER UP!"" which doesn't seem terribly progressive somehow.  Still, the scene where Meg, Jo, and Marmee discuss the incident is among those where the actresses transcend their material.This movie is not BAD, mind.  It is at it's best showing the girl's at play, doing the Pickwick Club, or putting on amateur theatricals written by Jo.  But some scenes are too stupid for words.  Bale and Mathis deserve awards for professionalism for enacting the lamest screen courtship ever allowed to succeed.  I don't expect Mr. March to get any LINES, but an award winning director should make the actor look line a man in his own home, rather than an Alzheimer's patient who wandered onto the set.  A character in England reads a letter from America, throws it aside UNFINISHED when he gets to the dramatic part, and rushes out the door to catch a boat to Vienna.  Meg doesn't tell her own sister she's pregnant in private letter because ""One doesn't speak of such things"".  Amy doesn't burn Jo's novel in the heat of anger, then grow fearful and repentant by the time Jo comes home.  She burns the novel AND acts fearful and repentant all in the same 60 second period.  Then there is the skating scene, wherein the ""rotten ice"" is clearly ROCK SOLID as though the hole were sawed out by a cartoon character, and which bears the weight of two fully grown rescuers who suicidally throw themselves down side-by-side next to the edge.  They then wave a oar around just because there was an oar in the book, and not because they are using it to any purpose.  If Anderson ever directs an action film, I'm not seeing it.Last but not least, ""strong-minded"" Jo doesn't come up with the idea for Plumfield on her own.  She does it because Super-Marmee TOLD her to.

22896,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0767851013,Michael Butts,"[2, 5]","One has to ask, did we really need another version of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel?  Well, even if we didn't, we have to give director Gillian Armstrong a big round of applause for her beautifully filmed and acted LITTLE WOMEN.  Winona Ryder as Jo was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar and is exquisite in her role as the wanna be writer who chronicles the adventures of her family, particularly her relationship with her three sisters.  Susan Sarandon does a nice turn as Marmee, the girls devoted mother, whose husband is off at war and rules the family with a smooth assuredness and grace.  Mary Wickes is fine as Aunt March; this late actress who was so memorable in the SISTER ACT films brings a naughty edge to her role.  The casting is perfect:  Trini Alvarado as Meg, the rather bashful sister who ends up marrying a poor tutor (Eric Stoltz); Claire Dane is the quiet and doomed Beth, who feels ""left behind"" when her sisters go off on their own; Kirsten Dunst plays Amy as a youngster and her joyful youth and innocence is marvelous; Samantha Mathis does well in taking over Amy's role as a young woman.  Christian Bale (our new Batman) does a nice job as Laurie, the young man who woos Jo to no avail, and ultimately ends up with Amy.  I think the most disappointing aspect of this rendition is Gabriel Byrne's Professor Baer.  It is ironic that his relationship with Ryder is the movie's weakest and although it doesn't totally diminish its quality, I think a different actor might have made it a perfect version.  As it stands though, LITTLE WOMEN is an enjoyable movie, filled with the richness of the time and the familial love Alcott so delicately portrayed.",4,JO MARCHES ON,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1679,"['One', 'ask', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'version', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'classic', 'novel', 'Well', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'director', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'big', 'round', 'applause', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'acted', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jo', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'exquisite', 'role', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'writer', 'who', 'adventures', 'family', 'particularly', 'relationship', 'three', 'sisters', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'nice', 'turn', 'Marmee', 'girls', 'devoted', 'mother', 'husband', 'off', 'war', 'rules', 'family', 'smooth', 'assuredness', 'grace', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'fine', 'Aunt', 'March', 'late', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'memorable', 'SISTER', 'ACT', 'films', 'naughty', 'edge', 'role', 'casting', 'perfect', 'Trini', 'Alvarado', 'Meg', 'rather', 'bashful', 'sister', 'who', 'up', 'marrying', 'poor', 'tutor', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Claire', 'Dane', 'quiet', 'doomed', 'Beth', 'who', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'sisters', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Amy', 'youngster', 'joyful', 'youth', 'innocence', 'marvelous', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'well', 'taking', 'over', 'Amy', 'role', 'young', 'woman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'new', 'Batman', 'nice', 'job', 'Laurie', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Jo', 'avail', 'ultimately', 'up', 'Amy', 'think', 'most', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'rendition', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Professor', 'Baer', 'ironic', 'relationship', 'Ryder', 'movie', 'weakest', ""n't"", 'totally', 'diminish', 'quality', 'think', 'different', 'actor', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'version', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'filled', 'richness', 'time', 'familial', 'love', 'Alcott', 'so', 'delicately', 'portrayed']",N/A

Throughout the movie there is a feeling that the most important parts of the book pop out of nowhere, for two minutes, and then talentlessly cut-off for some invented event.In addition the movie is filled with 20th century values, which are completely anachronistic to the time when the plot happenes. For example, there is a protest against Child Labor in China, which makes you wanna shout that even in the U.S and China there was child labor these days, so what's the point of putting it in. It feels as if the writer insults the viewer's intelligence by making his messages as clear as can be, and the credibility of the plot pays for it.The design of the characters is another problem. Jo is very feminine in this movie and hardly remind the book. Her famous exclamation ""Christopher Colombus!"" is replaced here by a weak ""By Jehosafat""(?). The mother is presented like a hard person. The movie gets lost between the sisters and there is a feeling that none of the sisters get, eventually, enough attention.In conclusion, I think it's a badly written and talentlessly directed movie. I think it's a misinterpretation of the book, caused by a desparate try to be original and a lousy attempt to make the book ""understood"" for the modern person, as if anything that was written before 1990 is beyond our grasp.

22902,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0767851013,Only-A-Child,"[2, 2]","The most interesting thing about the three film versions of ""Little Women"" is comparing them to each other or comparing each of them to Alcott's book.What makes them so difficult to choose between is that the casting of the four title characters is the critical element, and each film featured at least one actress whose performance was clearly superior to her character's portrayal in the other two films.This all star cast would include Jean Parker (Beth) in the 1933 version, Janet Leigh (Meg) in the 1949 version, and Winona Ryder (Jo) in the 1994 version. The 1994 version also had the best Amy, if only because they wisely split the role into a younger Amy (Kirsten Dunst) and an older Amy (Samantha Mathis).Since Jo is pretty clearly the most important of the four sisters (to the story), the 1994 version gets my nod as the best of the three films. The 1933 version pulls in as a close second as Joan Bennett and Katherine Hepburn are the second best Amy and Jo; and Francis Dee's Meg is as good as Trini Alvarado's. Neither Margaret O'Brien nor Claire Danes come even close to Parker's portrayal of Beth.The biggest casting problem all the productions had was in the age of the actresses. With the exception of Beth, all three characters must span a five year period. The casting process typically addressed this by selecting older actresses and getting them to play (with varying degrees of success) much (June Allyson was 32 years old) younger versions of themselves during the first half of the film.At least the 1994 versions managed to get the birth order right. The 1933 version had some problems in this area, as Hepburn was two years older than Dee and Bennett five years older than Parker. While this still causes many Alcott fans to cringe, it is nothing compared to the 1949 version where Allyson was ten years older than Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor was five years older than O'Brien.Taylor should have played Jo, which would have saved viewers from Allyson's embarrassing portrayal and from Taylor's attempt to pass as a blonde. Few actresses (even in black and white) were less suited to a light hair color. While Taylor's portrayal of Amy is painful, she would have been well suited to the Jo role.Critics frequently point out that both Hepburn and Allyson were much like Jo in real life, so there is a certain irony that Ryder's portrayal of the character (one so dissimilar to herself) was far superior. But Ryder and Jo have a similar level of intensity so maybe it was not as much a stretch as it seems.Then again, what do I know?

So I was a little hesitant to see this up-date, lest it spoil the memories for me.I was basically pleased. The cinematography was terrific---I was glad to see the beautiful snowy Christmas scenes, still old-fashionedly wonderful!  I didn't care for the update in terms of the feminist lingo. Why?  Don't we already know these things?  Well, when they put it in terms of Transcendentalism, it made more sense.The cast was uniformly good.  Susan Sarandon brought warmth to the character as well as principle.  The young Kirsten Dunst was totally delightful and stole every scene she was in.  The actress who played her older version looked a great deal like her but had none of her bubbly joyfulness---had living in Paris dulled her spirit?  Unlikely!  I found Claire Danes' performance quite remarkable and wished that we had seen more of her.Christian Bale seeme a little too smart for his age but he was a suitable companion for Winona Ryder as Jo.  Her performance as the young Jo was more bratty than high-spirited, which I found dismaying. I was actually glad when her manuscript was thrown in the fire!  When she got to New York, though, she seemed to sweeten up and was more sympathetic. She certainly looked good. The German professor was charming but seemed so much older than she was that I found it hard to believe that she'd fall in love with him.However, in sum, this is a very nice, old-fashioned, heart-felt movie, certainly worth watching.",4,Pretty good remake of a wonderful classic,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,1594,"['saw', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'version', 'when', 'was', 'litle', 'woman', 'fell', 'love', 'magic', 'was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'see', 'up-date', 'lest', 'spoil', 'memories', 'me.I', 'was', 'basically', 'pleased', 'cinematography', 'was', 'terrific', '-I', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'beautiful', 'snowy', 'Christmas', 'scenes', 'still', 'old-fashionedly', 'wonderful', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'update', 'terms', 'feminist', 'lingo', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'things', 'Well', 'when', 'put', 'terms', 'Transcendentalism', 'made', 'more', 'sense.The', 'cast', 'was', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'brought', 'warmth', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'principle', 'young', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'totally', 'delightful', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'older', 'version', 'looked', 'great', 'deal', 'had', 'none', 'bubbly', 'joyfulness', '-had', 'living', 'Paris', 'dulled', 'spirit', 'Unlikely', 'found', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'performance', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'wished', 'had', 'seen', 'more', 'her.Christian', 'Bale', 'seeme', 'little', 'too', 'smart', 'age', 'was', 'suitable', 'companion', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jo', 'performance', 'young', 'Jo', 'was', 'more', 'bratty', 'high-spirited', 'found', 'dismaying', 'was', 'actually', 'glad', 'when', 'manuscript', 'was', 'thrown', 'fire', 'When', 'got', 'New', 'York', 'seemed', 'sweeten', 'up', 'was', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'certainly', 'looked', 'good', 'German', 'professor', 'was', 'charming', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'was', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', ""'d"", 'fall', 'love', 'him.However', 'sum', 'very', 'nice', 'old-fashioned', 'heart-felt', 'movie', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

22910,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0767851013,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[6, 9]","Deep down inside many women, there is a person who wishes she lived in a simpler time. When people tied letters in ribbons, took cooking, sewing, knitting and quilting seriously and men brought women flowers. Yes, that still all happens today, but somehow some of us dream of the romance of the era. A time, long gone, as we rush towards the future.No time for a tea party, dressing up in lace, wearing gloves. How about finding time to sit on a park bench and steal a kiss? Then there are those wonderful attics, filled with mementos and treasures, just waiting to be discovered. Well, at least we can find time to escape into a movie and live the daydream through the characters. I have never had a sister, but when watching this movie, I always think how wonderful it would have been to have had a sister.To provide some background for this movie: Little Women was written in 1868 and the story takes place during the early 1860's. Many Americans were moving Westward and women like Jo March in this story, embraced the changes as they rode the wave into the new future. Because men had to go off to war (Civil War 1861-1865), women became more self-reliant and Marmee (Jo's Mother) represents a woman who faces the challenge with dignity and resolve. She is determined to make life wonderful for her family.Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was ahead of her time. Her main ambition in life was to relieve her family of financial heartache and Jo also strives for this in Little Women. Her writing talents eventually did help to support her family. When her Boston publisher suggested she should write a story for girls, she decided to try the experiment. The girls she knew best were herself and her three sisters, so she based her book on her family and created Jo March as her own fictional counterpart.Like Louisa, Jo struggles to conceal her strong-willed nature in a time when women were much more docile. She is the real Jo march. Anna (Meg) is Louisa's older sister. Elizabeth (Beth) was ill for two years before she died in 1858. May (Amy) became a painter in Paris and actually illustrated the first edition of Little Women in 1868. Abba (Marmee) is Louisa's mother who understood her daughter and encouraged her to be all she could be.Bronson Alcott, Louisa's father had a vision for an ideal world, but often he tended to ignore the realities of life. In this movie, he goes off to war and is injured.In Concord, Massachusetts, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne helped to kindle Louisa's ambitious nature. She was the first woman registered to vote in Concord, Massachusetts. The March family home in the story is actually the Alcotts Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts where the family lived for 20 years.There are two versions of this story that have been brought to the screen most wonderfully, in my own opinion. I have not seen all the movies made, but think perhaps if they were all combined into one, the perfect movie will have been created. There are quite a few details left out of this one that I really missed. Some should be in this movie to give it more depth and were included in the 1949 movie.This version of 1994 and the 1949 movie are my absolute favorites. To know the full story, you must watch both. If you also read the book, you can fill in the tidbits that are not included.The story begins in winter when there are to be no presents for Christmas and a family in need is blessed by the March family giving them their entire breakfast. The women in this story are like angels, they strive to be good and have such great character.This movie is delightfully filled with kittens, fall leaves, books, lace gloves, romantic letters, snow, opera, art and tea parties. It is truly the most beautiful adaptation of the classic story. The New England countryside around Concord is incredible in the Autumn. The seasons change as the characters lives evolve and as life moves on.Jo is the main character and has a mind of her own, we follow her story as she finds out who she really is and what she wants from life. She occasionally seems to burst from her quietness with such exuberance for life. She would have been quite happy running off to war and is a bit of a tomboy, but seems just quite modern to women today. She is so unaware of her own deep desires (except wanting to be published) until she experiences losses that bring her to a new understanding of her own need for love.The four sisters have such fun at home acting out the stories Jo writes, that their neighbor Laurie wants to join their society. He is infatuated with Jo, but she only feels a love of friendship for him.When Jo leaves to go to N.Y. she meets a more mature man who intrigues her. She shares her love of writing with him until one day he slightly criticizes her work and deeply hurts her when he says: ""There is more to you than this, if you have the courage to write it."" We think that perhaps Jo will never grow up and find love.Will Jo ever find what she is looking for and will she be a successful writer? If you are looking for a movie that is perfect for winter viewing, this will warm your heart! If you love this movie, you must also see Gone with the Wind.Watch this movie at night with candles. Oh, and have some oranges close by. ;>~The Rebecca Review",5,Heartwarming Story of Four Sisters,1004486400,"10 31, 2001",2001,5309,"['Deep', 'down', 'inside', 'many', 'women', 'person', 'who',

My sisters and I watched it over and over, and never got tired of it. I agree with some of the more critical reviewers that some of they key relationships and ideas from Miss Alcotts novel were definately missing in this movie, however. There are, I believe, two reasons for this: 1) A two hour show can only show so much (epsecially if your priority is to get the kissing scenes in there), and 2) Some of the main ideas (i.e. Christianity as the MAIN reason for the developing of one's charactor, ect;) were basically left out so as not to make the people's thinking seem outmoded to modern viewers.

What was this film about? These women love each other? Well, we knew that after the first four minutes, and left after was pretty sets, period costumes, and an oscar quality score.It's all very nice and wrapped in a pretty bow, but Jo's speeches about feminism and women's place in the world seem like frayed edges someone forget to trim.I can't help wondering whether in the early production stage, an associate remembered the cheering crowd at Cannes in 1979, after the unexpected film My Brilliant Career, and thought &quot;Jo March is an American Sybylla Melvyn,&quot; then convinced the team to hire the director of My Brilliant Career to come to America and make Jo March's Brilliant Career.The parallels are really there; they are not imagined: the seemingly obvious and perfect marriage turned down. The autobiographical manuscript bundled and mailed with those small feminine hands. To defy or not to defy; to be born homely and clever... the actress who seems striking by our standards, but homely by the standards of the time of the film.And the undeniable talent of the starring actress. Winona Ryder has more than proved herself in the market, and among the critics.I have no idea why it didn't work. I can't help thinking that most of the blame rests squarely on the head of Gillian Armstrong, who seems to sleepwalk her way through the film. This picture has no stamp of art on it. The actresses are all working very hard, and in many cases rise so high above a merely adequate script, that it is too bad there is not a special Academy Award for this.It is unfortunate, but with so much potential, so much material to work with, the binding thread in this picture ends up being the pretty sets, and the well-designed period costumes. It is as though there is no director at all, but the actors memorized their lines at home in their bedrooms, came to the set, dressed, and made up the rest as the cameras rolled.Read the book instead.",2,Gillian Armstrong's Career Tarnishes,1003449600,"10 19, 2001",2001,2226,"['One', 'star', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'one', 'star', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'one', 'star', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'subtract', 'one', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong.Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'title', 'expectations', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'high', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'What', 'was', 'film', 'women', 'love', 'other', 'Well', 'knew', 'first', 'four', 'minutes', 'left', 'was', 'pretty', 'sets', 'period', 'costumes', 'oscar', 'quality', 'score.It', 'very', 'nice', 'wrapped', 'pretty', 'bow', 'Jo', 'speeches', 'feminism', 'women', 'place', 'world', 'seem', 'frayed', 'edges', 'someone', 'forget', 'trim.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'early', 'production', 'stage', 'associate', 'remembered', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'Cannes', '1979', 'unexpected', 'film', 'My', 'Brilliant', 'Career', 'thought', 'quot', 'Jo', 'March', 'American', 'Sybylla', 'Melvyn', 'quot', 'then', 'convinced', 'team', 'hire', 'director', 'My', 'Brilliant', 'Career', 'come', 'America', 'make', 'Jo', 'March', 'Brilliant', 'Career.The', 'parallels', 'are', 'really', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'imagined', 'seemingly', 'obvious', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'turned', 'down', 'autobiographical', 'manuscript', 'bundled', 'mailed', 'small', 'feminine', 'hands', 'defy', 'not', 'defy', 'be', 'born', 'homely', 'clever', 'actress', 'who', 'striking', 'standards', 'homely', 'standards', 'time', 'film.And', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'starring', 'actress', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'more', 'proved', 'market', 'critics.I', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'most', 'blame', 'squarely', 'head', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'sleepwalk', 'way', 'film', 'picture', 'stamp', 'art', 'actresses', 'are', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'many', 'cases', 'rise', 'so', 'high', 'merely', 'adequate', 'script', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'special', 'Academy', 'Award', 'this.It', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'work', 'binding', 'thread', 'picture', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'sets', 'well-designed', 'period', 'costumes', 'director', 'actors', 'memorized', 'lines', 'home', 'bedrooms', 'came', 'set', 'dressed', 'made', 'up', 'rest', 'cameras', 'rolled.Read', 'book', 'instead']",N/A

It is a timeless tale of the March family, brought closer together by their father off fighting in the Civil War. Jo, Beth, Amy and Meg are unusual for their time: they are liberal. Jo is a writer and an amateur actress and would &quot;kill to go to Havard.&quot; Amy is an artist who later studies in Europe. Meg stays close to home, as does Beth, the angelic, sickly saint, always concerned with the welfare of the poor and disadvantaged, thinking of others first and herself last.The cinematography is beautiful in &quot;Little Women,&quot; although only a few scenes were shot in Massachussetts, the majority of the film actually being shot in British Colombia. The costumes, habits of the time (corsets, sleeping with rags in the hair to keep curls in, baked potatoes as pocket warmers) and houses take us back to a distant time when life was simpler in some ways. The story of the &quot;little women&quot; is a timeless classic that teaches love, tolerance, and the importance of following dreams.The DVD comes packed with a making-of documentary, commentary by director Gillian Armstrong, deleted scenes with director's commentary, isolated music score (the soundtrack to &quot;Little Women&quot; is simply gorgeous and worthy of many listens), a costume and production design gallery, two trivia games and a historical timeline.

The scenery and costumes were gorgeous and the movie is definitely loaded with plenty of emotion and heartfelt family moments. On top of this, the soundtrack is beautiful and entirely appropriate for the unfolding events.I will admit that I didn't like this movie much the first time I watched  it, and it was definitely something that grew on me. I think this is because the movie was not really an accurate depiction of the book. Other than the overly feministy nature of the movie, I also felt like some of the casting just didn't seem to be quite right. I think the character of Meg was okay because she was physically pretty and was accurately depicted as being somewhat vain (although she could have been more so), and the character of Beth was also accurately depicted as being shy and sickly, however I don't think Claire Danes was physically dainty/fragile enough for the role. As for the other two sisters, I felt like Amy was depicted very well by Kirsten and also by the other actress; she was selfish and wanted to be pampered. The character of Jo is the one I'm most unsure of. While Winona's Jo did have a temper and was a little fiesty, I felt that she could have been fiestier and more tomboy-ish. She also seemed to be a bit too reserved at times as well.Also, I was a little disappointed with the way character growth was portrayed in this movie; it felt rushed and sporadic, not like character growth should be. For example, Amy starts out as a selfish little girl but becomes a better person as she gets older and we see none of this transition in the movie. One day she's one way, and the next day she's a completely different person. Maybe they should have made the movie longer to do this better and maybe a longer movie would have prevented the omission of certain critical scenes in the book that were left out of the movie (like the first conversation the sisters have which really emphasizes the differences in their personalities).So overall, I would say this is a good movie if you don't compare or expect it to be too much like the book. Accept that it's different and you just might grow to like it like I did.",4,"A good movie, as long as you don't expect it to be like the book...",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2229,"[""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'give', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'was', 'flawed', 'yet', 'did', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'definitely', 'loaded', 'plenty', 'emotion', 'heartfelt', 'family', 'moments', 'top', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'unfolding', 'events.I', 'will', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'grew', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'book', 'Other', 'overly', 'feministy', 'nature', 'movie', 'also', 'felt', 'casting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'right', 'think', 'character', 'Meg', 'was', 'okay', 'was', 'physically', 'pretty', 'was', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'being', 'somewhat', 'vain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'so', 'character', 'Beth', 'was', 'also', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'being', 'shy', 'sickly', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'physically', 'dainty/fragile', 'enough', 'role', 'other', 'two', 'sisters', 'felt', 'Amy', 'was', 'depicted', 'very', 'well', 'Kirsten', 'also', 'other', 'actress', 'was', 'selfish', 'wanted', 'be', 'pampered', 'character', 'Jo', 'one', ""'m"", 'most', 'unsure', 'Winona', 'Jo', 'did', 'have', 'temper', 'was', 'little', 'fiesty', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fiestier', 'more', 'tomboy-ish', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'reserved', 'times', 'well.Also', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'way', 'character', 'growth', 'was', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'felt', 'rushed', 'sporadic', 'not', 'character', 'growth', 'should', 'be', 'example', 'Amy', 'out', 'selfish', 'little', 'girl', 'better', 'person', 'older', 'see', 'none', 'transition', 'movie', 'One', 'day', 'one', 'way', 'next', 'day', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'longer', 'do', 'better', 'maybe', 'longer', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'omission', 'certain', 'critical', 'scenes', 'book', 'were', 'left', 'movie', 'first', 'conversation', 'sisters', 'have', 'really', 'differences', 'personalities', '.So', 'overall', 'would', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'expect', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'book', 'different', 'just', 'might', 'grow', 'like', 'did']",N/A

It is not a faithful adaptation, and a rather modernized version. But having said that, I love this adaptation all the same because of the wonderful acting by the ensemble cast.The movie tells the story of a New England family during the Civil War - there's Marmie [Susan Sarandon, my favorite Marmie of all the adaptations],Meg, Jo [Winona Ryder who actually really shines in this role], Beth [Claire Danes], and Amy. Dad is a Union Army Chaplain and away on the battleground and so the band of women fend for themselves. Their lack of material comforts is never seen as much of a problem [they portray a once-prosperous family fallen on hard times] and then there's next door neighbor Laurie [an utterly charming Christian Bale]who becomes infatuated with the strong-willed Jo.The acting is this movie adaptation is perhaps one of the finest if taken as an ensemble performance - all the actors shine in their roles, especially Sarandon as Marmie, Ryder as Jo, Danes as the ethereal and fragile Beth, Bale as Laurie, and of course, Gabriel Byrne as Prof. Bhaer. The sets, costumes and cinematography are absolutely beautiful and so is the beguiling score.I make it a point to watch the movie adaptations of Little Women once a year - these movies just make me feel good and happy, especially during the holidays.
