733083,A3LWC833HQIG7J,B000083C7X,austin_Larry,"[18, 19]","I have become a big fan of buying concert DVDs as opposed to movie DVDs. Yes everyone should buy the 4 or 5 DVD version of Fellowship of the Ring because it is to date the masterpiece and standard for what DVD movie releases can be. But really how many times can you watch a movie? How many movies are even worth watching more then once? Isn't a good movie best seen in a theatre anyway?Concert DVDs are a different story all together. They can be viewed multiple times, shared at friends' houses, used as background or foreground. They are by far the best value for your DVD money. And this DVD is one of the better concert DVDs I have seen. The track Covered in Rain is almost worth the price by itself, where John's musicianship really shines through. As a whole, this DVD displays his voice, guitar playing, his band, and his personality. There is enough just plain good music on display that you will hear something new every time you listen. If you have a halfway decent sound system, for sure by this DVD if you even like Mayer's music a little. If you like his music more then a little, no matter what sound system you have, this will be a fun acquisition. The extras are quite nice. I have yet to listen to the commentary but the interview was interesting and the photos are surprisingly well done. The photos are shown in slideshow presentation and are a combination of color and black and white. They are a lot of fun. For the price this is a great value that you will enjoy again and again.

Is there really a bad song on here....NO... but with all the great songs I still go back to listening to 83 and John talking about his previous life and his brother. This is not one for glitter and glitz on the stage although John does get animated at times which is a plus. And of course ""Your body is a Wonderland"" will go down as a all time favorite. I did not like his version of this on the Grammys but who am I to judge. I always have a few songs in the am as I go to work if I am not listening to talk radio that get me going and ""No Such Thing"" will always get you going.. There is no disappointment in this DVD and I highly recommend it for the pure pleasure.. I can't give a 5 because for me ""Hell Freezes Over"" to this day has set the current benchmark for me.

733090,AEUT66ISTZ1H8,B000083C7X,who cares,"[4, 6]","I'd listened to a couple of CD's by John Mayer but wasn't too thrilled until I heard ""Continuum"". It grabbed my ears immediately and I thought every song was very good if not great. That's what motivated me to buy the DVD ""Any Given Thursday"". The songs sounded good but after a while they started to sound very similar...so much so that we decided to watch the rest some other time and opted for ""The Dance"" with Fleetwood Mac which we've seen countless times. Some concerts are just more watchable time after time. I'm sure you have your favorites. There were a few things that made John's concert less than thrilling for me. Granted... the guy is mega-talented, both as a singer - (I'm assuming songwriter) and guitar player. And from the noises of approval coming from the crowd I suppose you'd have to crown him stud-muffin. There were just enough young ladies in the audience that couldn't stop squealing long enough to take a breath that might make you want to scream ""please stop"" at your TV. I think I used different words. Anyway, if you can get past that its still a good concert. Where he started to really lose me is when it became clear to me that I couldn't understand what he was singing about unless he stopped to explain it. Great voice, but please, give me a coherent word or two so I can get into the song. He sounded clear as a bell on ""Continuum"" CD. Just something he could work on. Last point to throw at you is that I felt I wasn't so much seeing a band but a solo performance with backup. Maybe that wouldn't matter to anyone else but I think if you're on the same stage you don't need quite so much separation. I know, picky, picky. If you're a John Mayer fan you're probably looking for that review that will validate your purchasing impulse. I'm not sure if this review would have helped me either. For the rest of you I'd suggest borrowing someone else's DVD before taking the plunge. In the meantime, buy the CD ""Continuum"".
