782027,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0000JAV0A,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","Between Strangers is the sort of film that never gets made in America- not in Hollywood big budget films nor in independent films, because it is a film that takes its own sweet time in conveying its ideas to the viewer. That's not to say that it's a great film, nor even a pretty good one, but watching this 2003 Canadian-Italian film on DVD, shot in Toronto, gives a viewer an insight into how other people enjoy the same basic forms of art.This film follows the lives of three different women, each of whom has issues surrounding a trauma involving a little girl, and their own troubles relating to the men in their lives. That the film makes heavy-handed usage of a little girl (Sydney Pearson) that appears to each of them once, as a symbol, is a flaw, since there was no need for symbolism in an otherwise realistic film. The cast is loaded with international film heavyweights, not the least of whom is Sophia Loren, whose son Edoardo Ponti (whose father is Carlo Ponti), in his first time at a film's helm, wrote and directed this film. She plays Olivia, a woman who works in a Toronto supermarket, and years earlier married an ex-athlete, now wheelchair bound invalid, John, played by Pete Postlethwaite, a man whose rage at the world is directed like a laser at his masochistic wife. Her secret is that she had a daughter out of wedlock, as a teenager, and was forced to give her up for adoption by her father. Now, the daughter (Wendy Crewson) is a famed sculptress, whose fame seems to coincide with Olivia's own rediscovery of her drawing talent, unused since her pregnancy, of works of art eerily similar to her daughter's, and encouraged by Max (Gerald Depardieu), her gardener friend at a local park. The second woman lead is Natalia Bauer, a photojournalist played by Mira Sorvino, whose photos from the war in Angola have landed her a cover of Time magazine, much to the delight of her father, Alexander (Klaus Maria Brandauer), himself a legendary photojournalist, who both encourages and discourages her passive-aggressively. Yet, she is guilt-ridden by the girl in her photo, because she could have saved the child's life, rather than gotten the photo. The third woman is Catherine (Debra Unger), a famed cellist who is stalking her ex-convict father, Alan Baxter (Malcolm McDowell), after he is released from prison after twenty-two years. She blames him for her mother's death, and this crisis has made her leave her marriage and daughter, who leaves plaintive messages on her answering machine.That's the set up. Little overtly occurs in the film.... Sophia Loren gives a magnificent performance in what is reputedly the hundredth film of her career. Those who have chided her as building a career on her sexuality have never seen this woman's eyes. She is one of those rarities who acts with every square inch of her body. Postlethwaite, as her husband, is also very good, and it should not surprise that the best story in the film is the one the filmmaker accorded his mother.Yet, I felt, to a degree, as if I were watching a slightly better than average telefilm from the 1970s, at times, but one that never quite gels into something first rate nor substantial. This is the screenplay's fault, and thus the burden lies with Ponti. It is one of those rare works of art that doesn't terribly move you, but you are better for having seen it, even though it will not haunt you. If that seems like a very mixed reaction, then I have succeeded in recapitulating my experience in watching it, and- for reasons that elude me, and despite all its flaws, I think you should watch it, too.",3,Solid film,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3604,"['Between', 'Strangers', 'sort', 'film', 'never', 'made', 'America-', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'independent', 'films', 'film', 'own', 'sweet', 'time', 'conveying', 'ideas', 'viewer', 'not', 'say', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'watching', '2003', 'Canadian-Italian', 'film', 'DVD', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'viewer', 'insight', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'enjoy', 'same', 'basic', 'forms', 'art.This', 'film', 'lives', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'whom', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'trauma', 'involving', 'little', 'girl', 'own', 'troubles', 'relating', 'men', 'lives', 'film', 'heavy-handed', 'usage', 'little', 'girl', 'Sydney', 'Pearson', 'once', 'symbol', 'flaw', 'was', 'need', 'symbolism', 'otherwise', 'realistic', 'film', 'cast', 'loaded', 'international', 'film', 'heavyweights', 'not', 'least', 'whom', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'son', 'Edoardo', 'Ponti', 'father', 'Carlo', 'Ponti', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'helm', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'Olivia', 'woman', 'who', 'Toronto', 'supermarket', 'years', 'earlier', 'married', 'ex-athlete', 'now', 'bound', 'invalid', 'John', 'played', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'man', 'rage', 'world', 'directed', 'laser', 'masochistic', 'wife', 'secret', 'had', 'daughter', 'wedlock', 'teenager', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'adoption', 'father', 'Now', 'daughter', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'famed', 'sculptress', 'fame', 'coincide', 'Olivia', 'own', 'rediscovery', 'drawing', 'talent', 'unused', 'pregnancy', 'works', 'art', 'eerily', 'similar', 'daughter', 'encouraged', 'Max', 'Gerald', 'Depardieu', 'gardener', 'friend', 'local', 'park', 'second', 'woman', 'lead', 'Natalia', 'Bauer', 'photojournalist', 'played', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'photos', 'war', 'Angola', 'have', 'landed', 'cover', 'Time', 'magazine', 'much', 'delight', 'father', 'Alexander', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'legendary', 'photojournalist', 'who', 'encourages', 'passive-aggressively', 'guilt-ridden', 'girl', 'photo', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'child', 'life', 'rather', 'gotten', 'photo', 'third', 'woman', 'Catherine', 'Debra', 'Unger', 'famed', 'cellist', 'who', 'stalking', 'ex-convict', 'father', 'Alan', 'Baxter', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'released', 'prison', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'mother', 'death', 'crisis', 'made', 'leave', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'who', 'plaintive', 'messages', 'answering', 'machine.That', 'set', 'up', 'Little', 'overtly', 'film', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'what', 'reputedly', 'hundredth', 'film', 'career', 'who', 'have', 'chided', 'building', 'career', 'sexuality', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'woman', 'eyes', 'one', 'rarities', 'who', 'square', 'inch', 'body', 'Postlethwaite', 'husband', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'should', 'not', 'surprise', 'best', 'story', 'film', 'one', 'filmmaker', 'accorded', 'mother.Yet', 'felt', 'degree', 'were', 'watching', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'telefilm', '1970s', 'times', 'one', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'something', 'first', 'rate', 'substantial', 'screenplay', 'fault', 'thus', 'burden', 'Ponti', 'one', 'rare', 'works', 'art', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'move', 'are', 'better', 'having', 'seen', 'even', 'will', 'not', 'haunt', 'very', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'then', 'have', 'succeeded', 'recapitulating', 'experience', 'watching', 'and-', 'reasons', 'elude', 'flaws', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'too']",Between Strangers

782029,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000JAV0A,Grady Harp,"[16, 17]","BETWEEN FRIENDS is a tough story told with unrelieved intensity, acted with underplayed angst,  and directed with quiet strength by Eduardo Ponti. The &quot;Strangers&quot; are three unrelated women, each of whom has a burden that grows until it must be lifted.Mira Sorvino is a media photographer, daughter of Klaus Maria Brandauer (who has multiple awards for his own news photography, who has just had one of her images appear on TIME magazine - an image of a little girl from Angola  who we gradually learn died in the fire Mira was photographing.  She is haunted by the fact that the time she spent photographing the child could have been used to save the child's life.Deborah Unger is a concert cellist whose wife-abusing father (Malcolm McDowell) is released from prison despite her conviction that he should die for his cruelty, forcing her to leave her own family in the attempt to end her father's existence.Sophia Loren is a haggard housewife who has devoted her sad life to caring for her wheelchair-bound past athlete husband (Pete Postlethwaite) until she sees her illegitimate daughter she was forced to abandon becoming the sculptor artist she herself always wanted to be.  Each of these women have visions of the same small girl at moments when they are forced to confront their pain and each finds a way back to salvation through 'living out a dream'.Some may find the story saccharine, but the actors deliver these sad folk in such an honest way that together they manage to capture our hearts.  It is a true pleasure to see Sophia Loren act again and even the makeup she dons for her dowdy role cannot hide the fact that she remains one of the most beautiful women the screen has known - and one of the best actresses.  All cast members are superb.  Just be aware of the fact that this is a bleak story that requires much from the viewer.

782036,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000JAV0A,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Set in modern-day's Toronto, 'Between Strangers' follows the lives of three women loosely connected to each other, played by Sophia Loren, Mira Sorvino, and Deborah Kara Unger.  The film's director Edoardo Ponti is the son of Ms. Loren.Mira Sorvino is a successful journalist Natalia, whose recent photo shot in Angora is nationally praised, and was even used for the cover of Time maganize.  But Natalia is still tormented by the sense of guilt, for she thinks she could have done something to the little girl instead of taking photos, even though she was in the war.Deborah Kara Unger is renowned cellist Catherine, who has run away from her husband and daughter, and keeping herself aloof from others, she is thinking about plans that have something to do with one aged male (Malcolm McDowell) who has just come out of the jail.  And Catherine is holding a loaded gun.And Sophia Loren is a timid housewife Olivia, who works at a grocery store, and is married to John, a grim-faced man in wheelchair (Pete Postleswaite).  One day, as you and her friend Max (Gerald Depardieu) will find in the nearby park, Olivia has been seeing in her dreams the dark figures coming out of rocks, and is drawing the pictures of them on paper.  Later, as you know, we come to realize the real meaning of them.The three stories are interwoven deftly, and the characters including the supporting ones are memorable.  The acting is unanimously good, but the most impressive is naturally Sophia Loren, who has literally become an ordinary wife.  Olivia has buried her own dream in the past, decided to live a stiflingly dismal life with her husband, and is still aware that her life is lacking something vital, and as the other two women do, she finally finds what to do in the end.Sadly, however, the ingredients themselves in this film -- like journalist's ethics, troubled relations with father, or anything else -- are all nothing new to me, and though the script about sins and forgiveness is well-crafted, and eveything goes smooth and fits in the right place, I for one needed something more, something unique.Maybe I have complaints about the film because I have seen films like 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her.'
