This was the adult Seinfeld show going on.  I didn't have HBO at the time, but this was THE show that everyone who was in the know talked about.  Garry Shandling's Larry Sander's Show was so subversive, but so mature and sophisticated.  This show was the template for everything not only HBO did, but just about every network as well.  With its wry take peeking behind the curtain of show business, it was just delightful.  From Jeremy Piven making his pre-Entourage appearance as one of Shandling's comedy writers to Shandling's portrayal of the insecure, neurotic star of a late-night talk show, to Rip Torn's no-nonsense producer who will do anything as long as the show will go on, to the great, egotistical but totally clueless Hank Kingsley (Hey now!).  It is a cornucopia of truly great comedic talent.  You are doing yourself an injustice if you don't check this show out if you love sophisticated, adult comedy.  Immature teenagers beware, there are not a lot of fart jokes.  Just dry commentary of the absurdity and artificiality of show business, and how much we, God help us, love it.",5,See the great HBO show you missed,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1186,"['Wow', 'finally', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'adult', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'time', 'was', 'THE', 'show', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'know', 'talked', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Larry', 'Sander', 'Show', 'was', 'so', 'subversive', 'so', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'show', 'was', 'template', 'everything', 'not', 'only', 'HBO', 'did', 'just', 'network', 'as', 'well', 'wry', 'take', 'peeking', 'curtain', 'show', 'business', 'was', 'just', 'delightful', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'making', 'pre-Entourage', 'appearance', 'one', 'Shandling', 'comedy', 'writers', 'Shandling', 'portrayal', 'insecure', 'neurotic', 'star', 'late-night', 'talk', 'show', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'no-nonsense', 'producer', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'as', 'long', 'show', 'will', 'go', 'great', 'egotistical', 'totally', 'clueless', 'Hank', 'Kingsley', 'Hey', 'now', 'cornucopia', 'truly', 'great', 'comedic', 'talent', 'are', 'doing', 'injustice', 'do', ""n't"", 'check', 'show', 'out', 'love', 'sophisticated', 'adult', 'comedy', 'Immature', 'teenagers', 'beware', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'fart', 'jokes', 'Just', 'dry', 'commentary', 'absurdity', 'artificiality', 'show', 'business', 'how', 'much', 'God', 'love']",N/A

Without this program Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office might not have existed in the form they do today. It was (I'm pretty sure) the first HBO non-standup comedy series and it pioneered the uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges that Ricky Gervais took to the nth degree in The Office. It also created the device of celebrities playing unpleasant versions of themselves which Gervais used in Extras and Larry David uses in Curb. It's a shame that it took 12 years to finally get all of the episodes released.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[1, 1]","I never got to see the entire series when it first ran on HBO, so to have the entire series (and the multitude of bonus features) on DVD is a delight.Many of the episodes that were collected for the ""Best of"" set a few years ago look a tiny bit different here:  on my widescreen TV those episodes have a tiny bit of what looks a VHS tracking glitch at the top of the frame.  That glitch is on several episodes but ONLY episodes that were in the ""Best of"" set.  Curious.And one can see a slight change in picture quality between those ""Best of"" episodes and the others, most noticeable on the title card.  It isn't enough to get one's underwear in a twist, but it is noticeable nonetheless.Does all that diminish the enjoyment of the series set?  Heck no.For a great many years, my all-time favorite movie or TV character was sales manager Herb Tarlek from ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".  He was a lovable loser.  Jeffrey Tambor's ""Hank Kingsley"" character from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is posed to bump Tarlek down to second place  (Robert De Niro's ""Rupert Pupkin"" from ""The King of Comedy"" sits at third place and Daffy Duck at fourth.)The writing on ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is as sharp as it gets.  The line between reality and parody/satire can get very blurry sometimes.  They also take the occasional dig at Leno now and again, and that was back when he was still brand new at his ""Tonight Show"" gig and he wasn't very good at it.  The jokes are still relevant though because not much has changed since then.One of the staff writers (and occasional actors) on the show was John Riggi.  Riggi was a club comic for many years before getting the ""Sanders"" gig.  I saw him perform several times at a club in Memphis back in the 1980's.  I can even still remember some of his routine.  One was about caulk.Buy this DVD set.  As mindless as TV has largely become in the past several years, it is important to have something of quality in one's video library to remind you of how good TV can sometimes be when the right elements mix together.If you have this set and the complete set of HBO's ""The Wire"" in your home library, then you can stake a legitimate claim to having the best library on your block.Other reviewers here have complained of a glitch in a season 4 episode.

Better still, even more goodies?My Season One Set will go to a good home once this is released.I give this stunningly hilarious series 5 stars just for the episodic quality (Special Features or no).  A Brilliantly Funny Series from beginning to end.I agree completely with the reviewer singing the praises of Jeff Tambor's Hank. An incredibly complex and multi-layered character. I never knew if I was rooting for him, against him, or just felt pity for a guy who was simply born to be a second banana. A very shallow and superficial man with unexpected depths of loyalty, sentiment, and pathos.Rip Torn as Artie? Powerful and funny as hell. A Force of Nature. I can't imagine anyone being able to play that part with more gusto.Shandling as Larry himself? Well, (like Seinfeld) it takes a lot of confidence to let his co-stars steal so much of the limelight. It takes courage to play a character so fundamentally weak and cowardly (yet, strangely charming and REAL). He was the center of a whirlwind of dramatic events which he wasn't even aware of half the time.The core triumvirate bounced beautifully off each other. The outstanding supporting cast (many gone on to other shows with great success) kept things moving like clockwork.The Camera work which went from Slick Production to a Documentary Behind-The-Scenes Feel and back again...kept making me wish for an ACTUAL Larry Sanders Show....and kept blurring the line between reality and fiction. Very Meta.The writing for this series is superb. I have a thing about the episode with Hank's Birthday Tape. Artie's line ""Well, you know the camera adds about ten pounds"" possibly my favorite line from a sitcom ever (I darn near choked to death from laughing)...until the last line in that very same episode topped it!And it is SO fun to see celebrities playing themselves as jerks (or at least very human).

1355327,A1KDUQ2HU0WD68,B003NHMYJW,M. Fulkerson,"[6, 7]","At long last, the Larry Sanders Show, in its entirety, has been unleashed upon us.  It's about damn time.  I know I am simply echoing all of the other fans of this show, but the Larry Sanders Show, quite simply, is one of the greatest television comedies of all time.  HBO always showcased different series since its inception, but the Larry Sanders show made it a possibility for cable programming to be taken as seriously as any network show, and it proved that the constraints of the networks would only make unedited cable programs that much more powerful.Many characters come and go with this show, but the heart and soul lies with Garry Shandling, Jeffrey Tambor, and Rip Torn.  These three are so funny, so moving, so interesting, so neurotic, and so lovable that it's simply impossible to not get drawn in to their highly original and always inspired acting.  What makes the Larry Sanders Show such a rarity is its willingness to attack anything with no sense of hesitation or remorse.  Whether its the absurdity of show business, the fallibility of individual fears, or just being flat-out p****-whipped, this show will embrace the truth in all of its pimple ridden glory.  No other show before or after it has touched the flawless writing and hilarity that was always presented with a truly unique fluidity.  You'll get sucked in with this 17 disc set with ease, and before you know it, an entire weekend will fly by before you realize that you're nearly done with all six seasons.  The only negative to this box set is that it has to come to an end!What makes this set even more special are the outstanding bonus features.  It includes a documentary, deleted scenes, random commentaries, and a few other things that are standard to releases like this, but what really stands out amongst the extras are the personal visits that Garry Shandling partakes in with members of the cast and crew.  They are truly enlightening, sometimes emotional, and always fascinating.  By far the best interview Shandling performs is with Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin and Shandling decide to lace up the boxing gloves and chat about the show while they spar and dance around the ring.  Before you know it, the last thing on their minds is the show, and Baldwin reminds us of why we all love the guy so much.  One of the best lines in this box set is when Baldwin ignores a question from Shandling, sweaty and out of breath, and says ""why don't we get my ex-wife's lawyer on speakerphone, and let's rumble?"".There is an interesting sit down with Shandling and Sharon Stone where they flirt and talk about marriage.  It's very telling and sweet, yet the distance between them makes for a very compelling viewer experience.  Perhaps the most intriguing sit down is with Linda Doucett.  Doucett sheds a few tears, clearly missing Shandling after all these years of being apart, and Shandling earnestly offers his apologies for her sadness.  It's truly fascinating stuff.The only slight disappointment with these ""sit downs"" is when Shandling meets with Tambor and Torn to discuss the show.  Torn barely has a word to say, and Tambor just has a few very general remarks to make.  It would have been great to see them yucking it up more, and offering more insights to their characters and process, but the brevity of their meeting is hardly a deal breaker.I also realize that most of these interviews and ""sit downs"" were available on an earlier box set released in 2007, but I never owned or saw that set, so hopefully these revelations will be new to you as they are to me.I can't recommend this box set enough.

1355333,A93LCEKKTMG7Q,B003NHMYJW,R.D. Monsoon,"[6, 7]","""The Larry Sanders Show"" is easily the most requested TV show on DVD. Despite having gone off the air in 1998, episodes of the show have been piecemealed out on DVD over the last decade due to ongoing legal disputes. Finally, those issues have been resolved allowing the complete series to be released.I could spend hours praising ""The Larry Sanders Show,"" but perhaps the best thing I can say, is that even though I haven't seen most of the episodes since they first aired in the 1990s, I still remember almost all of the freeze frame endings -- it made that much of an impression on me. It's been a riot rewatching the whole series. The show consistently had me laughing out loud more than most shows on today. I forgot just how outstanding Rip Torn and Jeffry Tambor were.For those unfamiliar with the show, if Larry David were to ever make a workplace comedy, this is what it would be. On the surface the show skewers Hollywood vain and vapid culture, but at its core it's a workplace situational comedy. And the showbiz aspect of the show lets it explore situations that most workplace sitcoms never dare to go, such as sex tapes and drug addiction.I was surprised how little ""The Larry Sanders"" has aged. Between the edgy humor, unsentimental tone, and its innovative visual style, it feels like the episodes could have been made this year. In fact, most of the celebrities featured on it are still active, and comedians are still making jokes about the Clintons, OJ Simpsons and Michael Jackson. In a few episodes even ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" is joked about -- talk about a timely release of those episodes.I was also impressed with how in the first season it felt like the show had already been on the air for a few years. It didn't take them a year to hit their rhythm -- they hit it immediately. The extra features include Jeffry Tambor's screen test, and the performance he gives in it is pretty much identical to what's in the show. Everyone knew everything about who these characters were before the first episode.The video quality of the episodes is fair, but a lot of it has to do with the source material. The show was shot on both 16mm film and video -- film for the ""real life"" behind the scenes portions, and video for ""The Larry Sanders Show"" within the show. To create as much of a contrast between the two, and to give the film portions a documentary feel, a very grainy film stock with muted colors was used. The video portions are low resolution -- it looks like video form the 1980s. As a result, the MPEG compression causes the film grain to look like noise with artifacting. None of this detracts from the show -- just be aware that it's meant to look like this. In seasons 5 and 6 they switched to a much less grainy film stock and higher resolution video cameras. As a result, the last two seasons look much better than the rest of the series.Almost all of the extra features are recycled from theNot Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Showbox set. I never bought that box because I've always been holding out for the complete series, so all the features are new to me. There are endless interviews with virtually the entire cast and many of the guest stars. While Garry Shandling is surprisingly candid in them, even bringing up his romantic relationship with one of his co-stars, on the whole I found the actors to be pretty fatiguing to listen to.What was much more interesting were the commentaries and interviews with the shows directors and crew. ""The Larry Sanders"" show was actually a technically complicated to show to shoot. Despite having sets with four walls, instead of using a single camera the show was shot with three cameras simultaneously. And the show had so much physical movement that its DP skated around on rollerblades while holding the camera.In some of the outtakes you can see how carefully choreographed all the scenes were -- there's footage of the actors and camera crew missing their marks and banging into each other. This is yet another genius aspect of the show. Despite its workplace setting, it features lots of movement, which gives the show energy and keeps things visually interesting. I think a lot of people failed to appreciate the complexity of the continuous shots that would begin on the show set, move down a hall way, into the production office, and then into Larry's office.The crewmembers also go into depth about how ""The Larry Sanders Show"" show within a show was shot. The show was performed as if it was an actual live talk show with both the film and TV cameras running. Apparently Shandling was very insistent that that the film crews never intrude and break the reality of the talk show.This box set is an absolute must for fans of ""The Larry Sanders Show."" We've waited over a decade to have it on DVD -- there's no need to hesitate in buying. And if you've never watched it, it's worth discovering this series -- I envying people who will get to experience it for the first time.",5,One of the Most Brilliant TV Comedies,1294099200,"01 4,

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[0, 0]","Gary Shandling was a standup comedian who became Johnny Carson's regular guest host and was heir to the Tonight Show.  However, the backroom machinations and the shallowness eventually got to him and he left.  The Larry Sanders Show is his way of exposing what he hated about Hollywood.The show is a brilliant mockumentary, in the vein of This is Spinal Tap.  You have to pay close attention, because even the small details, such as ""live from tape"" or the sign with ""Larry Sanders - Host"", are all part of the parody.  Some of the episodes, particular early ones, are somewhat uneven, but even the mediocre episodes are still quite funny.  The viewer gets the sense that much of what is portrayed is not very far from the truth, but it is done in a way that makes you laugh.The ensemble cast is brilliant.  In fact, much of the humor is provided not by Larry, but by his surrounding cast, such as his producer Artie (played by Rip Torn) and his Ed McMahon-like sidekick Hank (played by Jeffrey Tambor).  Artie is a ruthless producer who knows how to keep everyone happy while keeping the show running.  Artie has the best lines, by far.  Tambor's portrayal of Kingsley as someone who constantly lives in the shadow of Larry Sanders is also excellent.This boxed set includes a booklet and bonus material, including deleted scenes, on the DVDs.  My main gripe is about the ridiculously bad video quality.  I have rented and viewed many HBO shows and movies on DVD and have never seen such horrible video quality until this boxed set.  Heck, I bet VHS recordings of the show probably look better than the quality of the DVDs in this set.  The show deserves a much better transfer.

I'm in my 30's and didn't really like the show when I was younger. The themes are adult and the general tone is likewise. But after putting on a few years, not to mention pounds...  This show now sparkles.Mine was a backwards introduction I must admit. I enjoyed Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm more and more as the years went on. Now Curbed is a ritual in our house. Why does this matter you may ask...  They were the result of the brilliance that is The Larry Sanders Show. It was the trailblazer that began the comedy style shown in todays most popular shows (The Office, etc.)Based on my love of these shows I decided to give this another chance some 20 years after I first had the opportunity and passed.  The show is built for an adult audience. This is mature humor and can be subtle in most instances. But that is what makes it truly brilliant. Instead of standing in a room and screaming out ""look at me"" the comedy is crafted. Rip Torn, Janeane Garofolo, Jeremy Piven, and Jeffrey Tambor highlight the supporting cast in this show devoted to late night talk shows and the stars that inhabit them. The stars range and include a who's who of todays stars. Just on that point alone the set is valuable. It's great to see the character interaction as Larry steps into problem after problem.In short it is a great building block for the comedies of today. The set is nice and well put together with no packaging issues as you would expect for the price. There has been a price reduction which I think makes it an easier grab. Being someone who did not watch any of it.... It's well worth the price of admission. A solid bet for the comedy fan.Thank you for reading.",5,How can you go wrong on this?
