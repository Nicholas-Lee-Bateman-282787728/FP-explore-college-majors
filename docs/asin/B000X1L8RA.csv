1112866,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000X1L8RA,A. Estes,"[1, 1]","A decade after their breakthrough into the mainstream with ""Make Yourself"", Calabasas California's Incubus chronicle their continued success with the release of ""Look Alive"". Part concert, part documentary, the film follows the group as they rehearse, travel the globe, take in various cultures and, of course, perform to thousands of fans who seemingly know every lyric in their songbook. Through it all, we see the band interact with each other, seemingly as chummy with one another as ever -- with the relationships between founding members Brandon Boyd (vocals), Mike Einziger (guitar) and Jose Pasillas (drums) being particularly strong -- which translates into their dynamic and colorful live performances.Longtime fans may grumble a bit, as the set focuses mostly on material from 2006's ""Light Grenades"" -- the album which they were touring on at the time -- and chooses to ignore even their biggest hits such as ""Drive,"" ""Pardon Me"" and ""Wish You Were Here"". Never fear, though, as the band packs a strong enough punch with the new material that you'll barely miss the tried and true tunes (side note: there are several other live releases from the band that may quench your old-school thirst). Not only do tracks like ""Rogues"" and ""Love Hurts"" spring to life in a live setting much better than on record, but older, more obscure cuts such as ""Nebula"" and ""Redefine"" are given make-overs, with the latter track transforming into a completely different tune altogether. Overall, the band sounds great, with guitarist Mike Einziger being the star of the set. Not only has he shown increased talent and range with each successive album, but he has stepped into his own as a modern guitar hero of sorts. Watching him bust out the Chinese Pipa on ""Aquaeous Transmission"" and noodle away on ""Sick, Sad Little World"" is about as awe-inspiring as today's modern rock gets, folks.Overall, the sound and picture quality of the DVD are top-notch. Presented in widescreen and sporting a 5.1 soundtrack, this is certainly the most impressive Incubus DVD to date. Through the film, we get to live vicariously through the band and see the wonderful landscapes of Iceland as if we were there while a score composed by Einziger pulses in the background. It just doesn't get much better than that. While it may not serve as an accessible, crowd-pleasing affair, ""Look Alive"" is at the very least an honest and inspiring portrait of a band in love with their craft. Not only does the newer material hold up live, but the band seems as honest and down to Earth as the day they started. It's definitely geared more towards the hardcore fans, so keep that in mind. For more of their hits, look towards ""Alive At Red Rocks"" or ""The Morning View Sessions"".",4,Dig It.,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,2741,"['decade', 'breakthrough', 'mainstream', 'Make', 'Calabasas', 'California', 'Incubus', 'chronicle', 'continued', 'success', 'release', 'Look', 'Alive', 'Part', 'concert', 'part', 'documentary', 'film', 'group', 'rehearse', 'travel', 'globe', 'take', 'various', 'cultures', 'course', 'perform', 'thousands', 'fans', 'who', 'seemingly', 'know', 'lyric', 'songbook', 'see', 'band', 'interact', 'other', 'seemingly', 'chummy', 'one', 'ever', 'relationships', 'founding', 'members', 'Brandon', 'Boyd', 'vocals', 'Mike', 'Einziger', 'guitar', 'Jose', 'Pasillas', 'drums', 'being', 'particularly', 'strong', 'dynamic', 'colorful', 'live', 'performances.Longtime', 'fans', 'may', 'grumble', 'bit', 'set', 'mostly', 'material', '2006', 'Light', 'Grenades', 'album', 'were', 'touring', 'time', 'chooses', 'ignore', 'even', 'biggest', 'hits', 'such', 'Drive', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Never', 'fear', 'though', 'band', 'strong', 'enough', 'punch', 'new', 'material', ""'ll"", 'barely', 'miss', 'tried', 'true', 'tunes', 'side', 'note', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'live', 'releases', 'band', 'may', 'quench', 'old-school', 'thirst', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'tracks', 'Rogues', 'Love', 'Hurts', 'spring', 'life', 'live', 'setting', 'much', 'better', 'record', 'older', 'more', 'obscure', 'cuts', 'such', 'Nebula', 'Redefine', 'are', 'given', 'make-overs', 'latter', 'track', 'transforming', 'completely', 'different', 'tune', 'altogether', 'Overall', 'band', 'great', 'guitarist', 'Mike', 'Einziger', 'being', 'star', 'set', 'Not', 'only', 'shown', 'increased', 'talent', 'range', 'successive', 'album', 'stepped', 'own', 'modern', 'guitar', 'hero', 'sorts', 'Watching', 'bust', 'out', 'Chinese', 'Pipa', 'Aquaeous', 'Transmission', 'noodle', 'away', 'Sick', 'Sad', 'Little', 'World', 'about', 'as', 'awe-inspiring', 'today', 'modern', 'rock', 'folks.Overall', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Presented', 'widescreen', 'sporting', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'certainly', 'most', 'impressive', 'Incubus', 'DVD', 'date', 'film', 'get', 'live', 'vicariously', 'band', 'see', 'wonderful', 'landscapes', 'Iceland', 'were', 'there', 'score', 'composed', 'Einziger', 'pulses', 'background', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'may', 'not', 'serve', 'accessible', 'crowd-pleasing', 'affair', 'Look', 'Alive', 'very', 'least', 'honest', 'inspiring', 'portrait', 'band', 'love', 'craft', 'Not', 'only', 'newer', 'material', 'hold', 'up', 'live', 'band', 'honest', 'down', 'Earth', 'day', 'started', 'definitely', 'geared', 'more', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'so', 'keep', 'mind', 'more', 'hits', 'look', 'Alive', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'Morning', 'View', 'Sessions']",Incubus: Look Alive

1112869,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000X1L8RA,Brett Corkins,"[5, 6]","I'll get my complaint out of the way first...WHY WOULD YOU PASS ENTIRELY OVER MAKE YOURSELF AND ALMOST ALL OF MORNING VIEW?!I love Incubus, that'll never change, but those two albums have some of their best material and they completely shunned it. Aqueous Transmission was great (I'd never heard it live before), but come on, they played almost every song off of Light Grenades. And as much as I truly love that CD I wanna hear a collection of new and old songs, not all new with a couple old songs sprinkled in.That being said, Look Alive, Incubus' newest DVD offering, is yet another winner. Taking a page from their first DVD, When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2, it's more of a clip show. It's primarily set in Chicago (the shots where they pull back so you get a view of the skyline too are incredible), but there's clips from a wide variety of their winter tour. Mixed in is home video footage from around the world of the guys merely having fun.I've clearly stated my grief with them passing over my two favorite releases, aside from that though I don't have a lot of complaints. Quicksand leading into A Kiss To Send Us Off still gives me goosebumps...they capture the energy of that song perfectly. Let's be honest though, Incubus is at their best when their adding to their songs, and they do that more than a few times here. The complete overhaul they did of Redefine, contrary to what one reviewer said, is amazing. I heard it at the show I was at but feared I'd never hear it again...not so! The extended jam session in Pistola was great, as was the addition to Sick Sad Little World. The one song that truly surprised me, and probably will most fans, is the fact that they played Nebula. What's more impressive is that Brandon nails every lyric.Overall, Incubus scores again in the DVD category, once again proving how great they are live. I just hope they wise up with their next one and put songs they clearly love playing live (ahem, Under My Umbrella) on the DVD. Past that, any fan of Incubus is sure to find comfort in this release...if only to have the b-sides Punchdrunk and Look Alive.",5,Disconnect and let me drift,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,2100,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'complaint', 'way', 'first', 'WHY', 'WOULD', 'YOU', 'PASS', 'ENTIRELY', 'OVER', 'MAKE', 'YOURSELF', 'AND', 'ALMOST', 'ALL', 'OF', 'MORNING', 'VIEW', 'love', 'Incubus', ""'ll"", 'never', 'change', 'two', 'albums', 'have', 'best', 'material', 'completely', 'shunned', 'Aqueous', 'Transmission', 'was', 'great', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'live', 'before', 'come', 'played', 'almost', 'song', 'Light', 'Grenades', 'as', 'much', 'truly', 'love', 'CD', 'wan', 'hear', 'collection', 'new', 'old', 'songs', 'not', 'new', 'couple', 'old', 'songs', 'sprinkled', 'in.That', 'being', 'said', 'Look', 'Alive', 'Incubus', 'newest', 'DVD', 'offering', 'yet', 'winner', 'Taking', 'page', 'first', 'DVD', 'When', 'Incubus', 'Attacks', 'Vol', '2', 'more', 'clip', 'show', 'primarily', 'set', 'Chicago', 'shots', 'where', 'pull', 'back', 'so', 'get', 'view', 'skyline', 'too', 'are', 'incredible', 'clips', 'wide', 'variety', 'winter', 'tour', 'Mixed', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'world', 'guys', 'merely', 'having', 'fun.I', ""'ve"", 'clearly', 'stated', 'grief', 'passing', 'two', 'favorite', 'releases', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'complaints', 'Quicksand', 'leading', 'A', 'Kiss', 'Send', 'Us', 'Off', 'still', 'goosebumps', 'capture', 'energy', 'song', 'perfectly', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'Incubus', 'best', 'when', 'adding', 'songs', 'do', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'here', 'complete', 'overhaul', 'did', 'Redefine', 'contrary', 'what', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'amazing', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'feared', ""'d"", 'never', 'hear', 'again', 'not', 'so', 'extended', 'jam', 'session', 'Pistola', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'addition', 'Sick', 'Sad', 'Little', 'World', 'one', 'song', 'truly', 'surprised', 'probably', 'will', 'most', 'fans', 'fact', 'played', 'Nebula', 'What', 'more', 'impressive', 'Brandon', 'lyric.Overall', 'Incubus', 'again', 'DVD', 'category', 'once', 'again', 'proving', 'how', 'great', 'are', 'live', 'just', 'hope', 'wise', 'up', 'next', 'one', 'put', 'songs', 'clearly', 'love', 'playing', 'live', 'ahem', 'My', 'Umbrella', 'DVD', 'Past', 'fan', 'Incubus', 'sure', 'find', 'comfort', 'release', 'only', 'have', 'b-sides', 'Punchdrunk', 'Look', 'Alive']",Incubus: Look Alive
